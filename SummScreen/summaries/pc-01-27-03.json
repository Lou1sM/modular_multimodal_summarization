When Kevin announces that he and Lucy have been having marital problems, Gail admits that Lucy told Gail that Lucy was taking some time to get away for a retreat at a cabin in the mountains.  But Gail reports to Kevin that, when Gail tried to contact Lucy to find out when Lucy would be home, Gail discovered that the phone at the cabin was out of order and Lucy's cell phone was out of range. Kevin decides that he should drive up to the cabin to check on Lucy.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Ian's cabin, Ian and Lucy are amazed that their bedroom liaison had made Ian feel like he has never been bitten.  Lucy wonders momentarily if someone might have bumped  Caleb off while Ian and Lucy were in bed, but decides she probably is NOT going to be THAT lucky!  Ian and Lucy decide that it must have something to do with Lucy OR Lucy and Ian together that has wrought the transformation in Ian.  Ian suggests that they take a shower and heads up to start the water.  After Ian leaves, Kevin arrives at the cabin and knocks on the door.  \n\n\nIn Capri, Elizabeth realizes that she has just killed Joshua and that Alison now knows Elizabeth's terrible secret - that her mother is, indeed, a vampire!  Elizabeth tearfully begs Alison not to hate her for the monster she has become and Alison assures her mother that Elizabeth did NOT kill Joshua!  Rather, Elizabeth SAVED Alison!  \n\n\nMeanwhile, in the woods, Tess is amazed when Caleb produces a horse-drawn sleigh and invites Tess to take a ride with him. Tess agrees and Caleb takes her to a Scenic Overlook above the city.  At the Scenic Overlook, Caleb apologizes to Tess again for the extremes he went to in his efforts to try to draw Livvie out of Tess.  And Caleb promises that it will NOT happen again.  Tess declares to Caleb that she does NOT believe that he is bad - only that his way of showing love hurts other people.  As Caleb and Tess look at the city lights and the twinkling stars above, Tess sees a shooting star and Caleb urges her to make a wish.  Then Caleb guesses that Tess wished for everyone to be happy.  Tess protests that she truly believes that everyone CAN be happy!  Caleb suggests that maybe Tess could help him begin to see the world through her eyes!  However, Caleb is disappointed when Tess announces that she must get home to Jack - and Tess leaves!  After Tess leaves, Caleb reminds himself:  \"It is OLIVIA that you want - NOT Tess!  You were just this part of Olivia that I had to get rid of, and  I never gave you a second thought, Tess.  Alert!  Focus!  Focus!  Don't forget about what is going on in the other half of the world!'  Caleb decides to call Joshua to see what kind of progress Joshua is making with Alison and Elizabeth in Capri.  In the meantime, Tess returns to Jack's River House, snuggles back into bed with Jack and told him that she loves him.    \n\n\nWhen Lucy hears a knock at Ian's Cabin Door, she hurriedly gets dressed to answer the door and is shocked to find Kevin standing there.  Lucy hesitantly explains that her car broke down and the phones didn't work, so she was planning to hike down the mountain to get help in the morning.  But Kevin insists that everyone in town, including Lee, Gail and the girls, are worried about Lucy and, since Kevin IS already there, Kevin insists on giving Lucy a ride down the mountain.  Lucy suddenly decides to go along with Kevin and hustles Kevin out the door with a bag of groceries, all the while, insisting that she just needs to turn off the water in the shower and get her boots.  After Kevin leaves the cabin, Ian emerges from the shower, complaining that the water is getting cold.  When Lucy admits to Ian that Kevin is there and is offering her a ride back to town, Ian angrily pulls on his trousers and shirt and went outside, insisting on confronting Kevin, over Lucy's protests.  Kevin is surprised when he sees that Ian is WITH Lucy at the cabin!  \n\n\nIn Capri, Elizabeth warns Alison that, now that Elizabeth has killed someone, Alison is no longer safe and that 'Stephen' will find out all about Joshua's death.  Alison admits that she has ALWAYS known that Elizabeth was a vampire and is NOT afraid of Elizabeth, but, instead, wants to help her mother.  When Alison assures Elizabeth that they WILL be able to keep Stephen from finding out about Joshua's death, Elizabeth insists that Stephen always knows about everything.  But Alison insists that she will NOT let her mother deal with this situation alone!  Alison and Elizabeth decide they need to hide Joshua's body until it is dark enough to move the body out of the Hotel and make it appear that Joshua just vanished!  Alison informs Elizabeth that her mother can NOT go back to Port Charles or even talk to Stephen any more.  But Elizabeth protests that it is impossible to hide -  or hide anything -  from Stephen.  Elizabeth finally agrees that she will tell Stephen that she wants out of the marriage and pretend that she does NOT know where Joshua is.  As Alison and Elizabeth try to find a way to get rid of Joshua's body, Joshua's cell phone went off in his pocket and Alison realizes that Caleb is the caller.  Alison decides NOT to answer the phone, but Joshua's silence makes Caleb all the more suspicious on the other end.  Alison and Elizabeth decide to hide Joshua's body in the armoire until later in the evening.  But, as they begin to move the body, Caleb comes to the door of Elizabeth's hotel room and knocks, calling to Elizabeth to open the door.\n\n\n",
