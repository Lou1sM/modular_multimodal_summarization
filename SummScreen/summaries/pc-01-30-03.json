Kevin declares that he plans to keep Lucy driving around in circles until she listens to him but Lucy accuses Kevin of kidnapping her.  Kevin reminds Lucy that - once upon a time - Lucy would have thought this was a romantic gesture on Kevin's part - rescuing her before she made a serious romantic mistake.  But Lucy coldly orders Kevin to turn her loose.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, Elizabeth and Alison arrive home at Rafe and Alison's Place and Elizabeth admits to being depressed by the roller-coaster turns of events that have become her life in past weeks.  As Alison tries to remind her mother that Elizabeth saved Alison by killing Joshua, Elizabeth suddenly confesses that she enjoyed sinking her fangs into Joshua's neck. Then Elizabeth suddenly begins to have visions of Joshua, angrily accusing Elizabeth of murder - and Elizabeth screams.  When Alison sees no one, Alison tries to calm her mother but Elizabeth only grows more agitated.  Finally, Alison slaps Elizabeth and Elizabeth tearfully admits that she is being haunted by Joshua.  As Alison assures her mother of her love, Elizabeth sees another vision of Joshua but, this time, does NOT tell Alison about it.  Declaring that she is tired, Elizabeth announces to her daughter that she is headed to her room for some rest.\n\n\nIn the Park, Rafe wonders if he is spinning his wheels down here and Caleb suddenly arrives.  Caleb announces that Caleb KNOWS that Joshua is gone and the evil monster accuses Rafe of being the one who is responsible for Joshua's demise.  Rafe tries to convince Caleb that maybe one of Caleb's creepy  cohorts in Europe offered Joshua a better gig, but Caleb refuses to buy into Rafe's notion. Caleb declares that, since Rafe broke their agreement, Caleb WILL retaliate and promises that:  \"All hell is about to break loose!'  Caleb suggests that, since Alison was the last to see Joshua, maybe Caleb should go after Alison to make Rafe pay for Joshua's death.  When Rafe suggests that Caleb just troll for a new lackey, Caleb declares that he is never alone for long, then disappears.  After Caleb leaves, Rafe calls Jack and warns Jack that Caleb MIGHT be headed to the River House - and Tess!\n\n\nIn Kevin's limousine, Lucy secretly  worries that her absence will drive Ian back to his craving for blood. But, the more Lucy tries to convince Kevin to take her back to the Cabin, the more determined Kevin becomes that the only RIGHT thing for Kevin to do is hang on to Lucy.  When Lucy grabs her phone on the pretense of calling Christina, Kevin grabs Lucy's phone out of her hand and informs his wife that Kevin has already called Christina and announces that he suspects that Lucy is attempting to call her lover-boy!  Lucy finally admits that she is worried about Ian because Ian did NOT feel well and is now stranded alone at the Cabin, but Kevin remains unmoved, pointing out that Ian is a doctor, who can surely handle his own bout with the flu!  As Kevin demands to know how their great love became so badly derailed, Lucy claims that she never stopped loving Kevin, but reminds Kevin that he has turned into a stranger she no longer recognizes.  Kevin asks for only a few hours to be with Lucy and try to reclaim their relationship - but Lucy insists that she can NOT do that.  Meanwhile, alone at the Cabin, Ian begins to unravel.  Ian becomes convinced that Lucy did NOT leave on her own - but was taken away.  And Ian suspects that it was Kevin who snatched Lucy!  Ian vows to kill Kevin if Kevin harms Lucy in any way.  Later, Kevin ushers Lucy into a Motel room, stocked with all of Lucy's favorite things!\n\n\nAt the same time, back in Port Charles, as Alison sleeps in her room, Caleb suddenly appears and bares his fangs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

After some romantic time alone, Rafe and Alison strategize about how to do battle with Caleb. Jamal is puzzled by the behavior of the woman he assumes is his girlfriend.

A catfight breaks out when Reese sees the way Casey looks at her little drummer boy. Although Ricky and Jamal pull the women apart, it's a furious Caleb who actually breaks up the fight.
