    "tvmega_recap": "Lucy tries to talk Kevin into letting her go, but it's no use. He's determined to hold onto his wife and keep her away from Ian. Despite her protests, he insists that they still have a chance at happiness. The limo takes them to a hotel, where Kevin has booked a suite and arranged a romantic dinner, but Lucy's eyes are on the phone. As Ian looks all over for Lucy, his symptoms return.

Rafe and Caleb have a confrontation in the park, where Caleb warns the slayer that killing Joshua was a declaration of war. If Rafe didn't do it, Alison did, and he has no qualms about going after her. Rafe phones Jack to warn that Caleb may be on his way. Elizabeth bitterly complains about what Caleb did to her.
