Shortly after Lucy arrives to check on Ian's progress, she receives a chilling call from Kevin.  When Lucy announces that she believes she needs to confront Kevin in jail, Ian insists that she let him accompany her.    But Lucy reminds Ian that, if Ian should lose his temper with Kevin, there is no telling what might happen if Ian's fangs and red eyes were to reappear.  Ian finally agrees that Lucy should visit Kevin alone.  When Lucy arrives at the jail to see Kevin, Lucy announces that she has obtained a restraining order against Kevin, that she plans to press charges against Kevin for kidnapping her and that she wants Kevin to stay away from Lucy and her daughters until Kevin gets serious about getting the help he needs.  But Kevin shocks Lucy when Kevin proclaims that, after Lucy's latest betrayal, Kevin is no longer interested in salvaging their relationship.  Kevin declares that he no longer has any loving feelings left for Lucy - but he is NOT finished with Lucy yet!  Lucy defiantly reminds Kevin that making threats seems to come easier for Kevin all the time, but that there is no way that Kevin can hurt her any more than he ever has.  Kevin warns Lucy not to be so sure and vows that, one day, Kevin will be out of jail and will be planning to pay Lucy back with interest for the way she betrayed him with Ian and kept locking Kevin away, first in a mental institution and now in the jail.  Shaken by Kevin's cold threats, Lucy takes off her wedding ring and leaves it with Kevin, stating that their relationship is over!   A light suddenly flashes in Kevin's jail cell. \n\n\nAt Rafe's Loft, Jamal and Alison watch on Rafe's hidden camera monitor as  Caleb attacks Jack.  Rafe and Tess bust into Stephen's apartment, just as Caleb is preparing to administer a lethal bite to Jack.  Rafe points out to Tess that she is seeing the REAL Stephen Clay, in all of his blood-thirsty glory!   Tess is horrified by what she sees and runs away.  Jack warns Caleb that Caleb will NEVER be able to reach Tess now, and then Jack runs after Tess.  When Jack catches up with Tess in the alley, Tess apologizes for the foolish way she believed in Caleb and truly believed that Caleb had been turned into an evil monster against his will and that Caleb truly wanted Tess to help him change.  Jack assures Tess that many people have been fooled by Caleb for centuries, but, Jack points out, Caleb is really a DEAD soul.  Tess admits that what shocked her most when she saw Caleb about to bite Jack was that Tess could see for herself that Caleb truly enjoyed the prospect of murdering someone.  Jack urges Tess to go away with him, so they will have a chance for a 'normal' life.  Tess finally agrees to go with Jack.   \n\n\nMeanwhile, back at Caleb's apartment, Caleb brazenly informs Rafe that Tess will \"get over\" the shocking revelation she just witnessed.  But Rafe retorts that Tess is NOT like Livvie!  Rafe confidently declares that Caleb will NEVER have what the evil monster came to Port Charles to have - Caleb has lost Livvie, and now Caleb has turned Tess against him.  Rafe offers Caleb a deal: Rafe promises that IF Caleb leaves Port Charles and NEVER returns, Rafe will agree NOT to make Caleb's life any more miserable than it already is.  But, after Rafe leaves, Caleb arrogantly announces: \"All deals are off!\" \n\n\nRafe returns to his loft, where Alison and  Jamal are waiting and continuing to watch Caleb on the monitors.  Caleb flashes back to his encounter with Tess and remembers how Tess gently told Caleb that she believed Caleb had a good heart.  Then Caleb remembers the look on Tess' face when Tess saw Caleb preparing to take a bite out of Jack.  Caleb angrily proclaims:  \"You will pay for that!'  Then Caleb finds the hidden camera!  Caleb angrily declares into the camera that he is declining the offer to leave Port Charles, because he has some unfinished business.  Then he crushes the camera.  Once the camera is out of operation, Caleb opens a secret compartment in the wall of his apartment and takes out a book, decorated by a Pentagram on the cover.  \"This is going to be a massacre,\" Caleb declares!   Then Caleb begins an incantation:  \"Your master calls!\" \n\n\nThe lights suddenly go out in the jail.  Jack and Tess are shocked when the lights go out in the alley where they are standing.  And, when the lights go back on, Jack realizes with horror that Tess is gone!  The lights go out at Rafe's Loft as well.  Rafe informs Jamal and Alison that this is the beginning of Caleb's revenge!  \n\n\nThen Caleb suddenly materializes in the fog enshrouded woods as lightning flashes.  Reese shows up and Caz soon follows her.  Hidden in the bushes is Ian - with his fangs bared! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Jack takes his new bride to the Recovery Room for their first official date, hoping that being in public will keep Caleb away from her. He's unnerved when she selects Livvie's favorite song on the jukebox. Chris arrives at the pub with strange news for his brother. Contrary to past findings, the results of the latest lab tests show that Tess now has DNA. As Caleb prepares to bite the sleeping Alison, he's suddenly thrown across the room by an invisible force: Rafe. Caleb had no intention of biting Alison; he knew that Rafe would take the bait. Rafe admits that he and Alison have discovered the truth about how he set them up. Caleb is astonished when Elizabeth admits to killing Joshua to protect her daughter. He warns her that she did a very bad thing and will be punished, but instead of biting her neck, he kisses her.

Her attempt to make a call is stopped by Kevin, who grabs her cell phone and hurls it against the wall.
