After he sings the song about Casey, she kisses him but stops when thunder rumbles. Tess meets Caleb and asks how he became a vampire.

Tess returns and says she's been out with Caleb.",
    "tvmega_recap": "At the overlook, Tess persuades Caleb to tell her what he was like before becoming a vampire. This is the first time he's ever been asked that question. Having been born into vampire royalty, he was always expected to fulfill his destiny, but he rebelled and had a huge falling-out with his father. He found love and peace with the first Olivia, but his attempt to use his deceased mother's wedding ring to protect her was his downfall. He went to retrieve the ring from his stepmother, unaware that she had been turned. She tricked him and sank her fangs into his neck. When he went back to Olivia, he mistakenly thought they could work it out together. His attempt to turn her into a vampire resulted in her death. Jack fills Jamal in on the situation with Tess and Livvie. Since he's not strong enough to take Caleb on physically, he intends to love Tess so much that Livvie won't be able to get any stronger. After Jamal leaves, Tess informs Jack that she was with Stephen. Ricky and Casey share a park bench as they work on some lyrics for the band. Unaware that \"Marissa\" is actually her angelic sister, Ricky admits that he's never stopped loving Casey. This makes her cry, but she tells him that she loves hearing about his relationship with Casey. She persuades him to play and sing \"Hey, Sister\" for her, spontaneously kissing him. Ricky thinks the kiss feels right and very familiar. Their next kiss is interrupted by the sound of thunder, which Casey takes as a warning from Ed. Elizabeth has another encounter with Joshua, who mocks her from beyond the grave. Alison thinks her mother simply needs water, and when she goes to get a bottle from the refrigerator, Elizabeth shoots herself. Shocked that the bullet had no effect, she becomes more upset when Rafe informs her that a full-fledged vampire can only be killed by a slayer, and that's something he won't do."
