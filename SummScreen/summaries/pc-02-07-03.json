Tess runs off after seeing Caleb attack Jack. Jack runs after her and she apologizes for trying to save Caleb. Jack urges her to leave town with him right away, but then the lights go out and when they return, Tess is gone! Rafe urges Caleb to leave town, but later tells Alison and Jamal he fears Caleb's revenge. Caleb discovers the hidden camera in his loft. Caleb then calls all vampires to his aid. Reese and Caz respond to Caleb's call- as does Ian, who hides in the bushes.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ian tells Lucy that he might be able to fix the problem with their blood cells, but it could take some time. Kevin phones Lucy, so she goes to his jail cell and says she took out a restraining order. Kevin tells her that he no longer loves her but he's not through with her; he intends to pay her back for what she's done to him. She gives him back her ring before leaving in tears. As Jamal & Alison watch on the monitor, Tess yells at Stephen not to bite Jack. She is horrified and runs out, so Jack follows her. He tells her that there is no good to save in Stephen. She agrees to go away with him. Rafe suggests to Caleb that he has nothing left in Port Charles so he should just leave town. Stephen/Caleb remembers Tess saying he has great love and how she looked at him when he was holding Jack. He swears that they will all pay. Then he spots the hidden camera and tells Rafe through it that he's not leaving Port Charles because he has some \"unfinished business\". He takes out some dusty, mystical-looking book from a hidden place in the wall and opens it, saying \"Forget the war, Rafe...this is gonna be a massacre\". The lights flicker and go out all over town. When they come back on, Tess is gone from Jack's side. He tells Rafe and the rest what happened. Rafe tells them that Caleb's revenge is beginning. Caleb prays to the devil and calls out all the vampires. He is transported to the park (or some clearing) where the two band members appear. Ian is in the bushes. They all chant \"Against the righteous, condemn the blood.\""
