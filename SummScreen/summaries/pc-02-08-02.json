But Kevin insists, 'I won't let you go.'\n\n\nAs Ian is driving Amy to see the house-bound patient she asked him to\nhelp her  with, Amy observes that she is sorry to see that Ian is\nhaving a hard time - especially in his relationship with Eve.\n\n\nAt the Recovery Room, Jack and Livvie are saddened when Jamal\ncontinues to tell them that he thinks it is time to 'leave Dodge,' and\nthat he will sign the Bike Shop ownership over to them.  Livvie\nadamantly insists that Jamal is 'not going anywhere.'\n\n\nIn the barn, Rafe has started a fire in the potbelly stove and Rafe\napologizes to Alison for getting her cold and wet when he shoved her\nhand in the snow.  But Alison told him that she realizes now that she\nDOES have the rest of her life ahead of her and that, if she does NOT\nmake the most of it - it will be like a slap in the face to people who\ndo NOT have much time left.  Rafe asks:  'Like me?'\n\n\nAlison asks Rafe how much time he DOES have left and when he says\n'Seven weeks by the clock,' she asks him what he means 'by the clock.'\nSo Rafe shows Alison the watch with 13 weeks marked on it, and\nexplains to her that, each week, the hand moves backward one notch.\nRafe explains that EVERY angel who gets a 'pass' back to earth gets\njust 13 weeks to complete their journey and has a watch to remind them\nof the time they have left.  Rafe told Alison that, when his time is\nup - this time he will be 'gone for good' and will 'NEVER come back\nagain.'\n\n\nAlison asks:  'Was it worth it?'\n\n\nRafe admits that there have been times when he wished he had NEVER\nreturned and that 'loving you and knowing I could never have\nyou...sometimes hurt more than dying.'\n\n\nAt the Hospital, at Paige's suggestion, Kevin tries to remember his\nexperience in the 'tunnel of white light,' and says that it was like\nbeing lost between two worlds.  Kevin mentions that he remembers\nseeing Paige there:  'You were trying to help me cross over to a\nbetter place.'  However, Paige becomes agitated when Kevin observes\n'you looked like an angel.'  Paige quickly told Kevin that he should\nNOT say that.\n\n\nAt the barn, Alison admits to Rafe that she read his journal and KNOWS\nthat he loves her.  Then Alison told Rafe that she believes she was\nNOT only running from Rafe's feelings for her - but... And Rafe\nfinishes her sentence:  'And your feelings for me?'\n\n\nRafe reminds Alison that NO ONE ever really knows HOW much time they\nhave left, then Alison begins to kiss him.\n\n\nAt the Recovery Room, Jack and Livvie remind Jamal how miserable he\nwould be if Valerie HAD succeeded in her original plan and it had been\nALISON who died instead of Valerie - Jamal would be taking flowers to\nALISON'S grave and feeling like hell.  Jack asks Jamal:  'What is the\nONE thing that has changed your life?'  And Jamal admits that it WAS\nAlison who turned his life around for him.\n\n\nMeanwhile, back at the barn, as Rafe and Alison kiss, Alison admits\nthat 'I've been hiding my feelings for you.  I WANT to be MORE than\njust friends.'\n\n\nAt the Hospital, Paige insists to Kevin that he should NOT think of\nher as an angel and repeats that she HAS to leave Port Charles.  Kevin\nasks her to stay and told her that he didn't mean to upset her.\nKevin says 'Sit with me for a while,' and Paige returns.  Then Kevin\nobserves that no one believes in out-of-body experiences any way -\nexcept maybe Lucy.  Kevin then told Paige that painting her portrait\nhas become important to him -- that it seems Paige has brought\nsomething vital back to him -- something he believed he had lost\nforever years ago.  Then Kevin begs Paige to stay and let him finish\nher portrait.  Paige agrees.\n\n\nIn the car, Amy observes that the problem between Eve and Ian seems to\nrevolve around trust issues.  When Ian told her that it is not\nsomething anyone can do anything about, Amy suddenly insists that Ian\nstop the car. When Ian asks what is wrong, Amy says:  'Me - I've been\nlying to you.'\n\n\nWhen Ian stops the car, Amy admits to Ian that she only said yes to a\ndate with Chris in order to distract herself from.....Ian! Amy admits\nthere is NO patient who lives outside of town; that she lied so she\ncould spend time with Ian - alone.\n\n\nAt the Hospital, Paige promises Kevin that she will stay in Port\nCharles until Kevin is well again.  But when she takes off her coat,\nKevin appears shocked and told her that the dress she has on is the\nSAME dress he saw her wearing when he was in the 'tunnel of light.'\n\n\nAt the Recovery Room, Livvie implores Jamal to let Alison be there for\nhim and Jack urges Jamal to at least TALK to Alison before he leaves\ntown.  Livvie suggests that, even if they can NOT patch things up, at\nleast talking things out could 'make the ending gentler to swallow.'\nJamal thanks them for their advice but, as he leaves, he does NOT\npromise that he will talk to Alison before leaving.\n\n\nAt the barn, Rafe asks Alison what she means when she says that she\nwants to be MORE than just friends - and Alison kisses him again.\n\n\n",
