Amy went on to say that she has nothing to lose - that she will be leaving in six weeks to take a new job - her 'dream' job - and that she could NOT leave without telling Ian how she REALLY felt about him.\n\n\nWhen Ian asks Amy what she wants, Amy responds:  'A passionate, grand affair with you.'\n\n\nAt the Hospital, Kevin angrily insists to Paige that he saw her in the 'white light' tunnel wearing the SAME dress she is wearing right at that moment.  However, Colleen comes in just then to get Kevin's stats.  'There is nothing worse,' Colleen mutters, 'than a patient whose first name is doctor!'\n\n\nWhen Colleen leaves, Kevin insists to Paige that he wasn't having a dream or a hallucination - that he REALLY saw her in the tunnel.  As Paige continues to urge Kevin to believe he is mistaken, Kevin says: 'In every case I have ever studied - the people that describe the tunnel with the white light say the people they find inside the tunnel are people they've known before - people that they LOVED when they were still alive.  But the people that turn up in the tunnel, who are supposed to help you get to 'the other side' - are ALREADY dead!'\n\n\nAt the barn, Alison and Rafe are STILL kissing and Alison admits:  'I fought my feelings for so long,' while Rafe observes that he had SO many arguments with himself but can NOT remember a time when he was NOT loving Alison and wanting her.   Then Rafe says 'No more words,' picks her up and gently deposits her on a bed of fresh hay. \n\n\nMeanwhile, back by the side of the road with Ian and Amy, Amy presumes that Ian is going to say that he MERELY wants to be friends, and is mildly surprised when Ian told her, that, under different circumstances, IAN would be the one suggesting a mad, passionate affair!\n\n\nBack at the barn, Rafe and Alison make love for the first time.  [The first stanza of the song played on the ABC version was:  'OOH, Baby, I give my all or not at all, there is no in-between, I'll give my best, won't second guess.'  On SoapNet, the first stanza of the song was:  'I've seen stars in the night, too many to count, and Days when the sun never went down, I've seen thunder and lightning and countless silvery moons. But I've never seen Nothing like you.']\n\n\nWhen they come up for air, Rafe says:  'You're my angel.'\n\n\nAnd Alison replies: 'This is so magical.'\n\n\nBut Rafe told her:  'No, it's better than that. It's REAL!'\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Paige says to Kevin, 'Maybe it WAS me that you saw in the tunnel.   But maybe it was because I had the SAME kind of experience after MY accident!.'\n\n\nBack in the car, Amy told Ian that she wants him to promise that he won't let her candor ruin the short time they have left together. And Ian assures her that it will NOT ruin anything, then suggests that they head home.\n\n\nBack at the barn, Alison told Rafe that 'everything is perfect,' and Rafe agrees that it is 'glorious, wondrous, miraculous.'\n\n\nAlison told Rafe that no matter how much or how little time they have left together, she plans to make EVERY second count. As they are cuddling together, Alison suddenly notices a scar and asks Rafe if that is 'where you got killed?'\n\n\nRafe urges her NOT to think about anything unpleasant just then, but Alison says that she WANTS him to be alive.  And Rafe assures her that, at THAT moment, he feels MORE alive than ever before.\n\n\nBack at the Hospital, as Kevin dozes, he says to Paige: 'I know you're real,' and Paige encourages him to sleep and told him that everything will seem different tomorrow.  As Paige prepares to leave, Kevin whispers:  'Tomorrow, we'll finish your painting.' Then Kevin flashes back to his experience in the tunnel and remembers that, when he asked Paige what was going on, Paige replied that THIS was their destiny - together!  And Kevin drifts off, saying:  'It was SO real - like she was an angel!'\n\n\nAs Ian and Amy are driving back to town, Ian sees a shooting star and Amy says she has made a wish on it.  But, as Ian tries to get Amy to tell him WHAT she wished for, the car suddenly hits a patch of black ice and slides off the road.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "After telling Ian she'll be leaving town soon, Amy asks Ian to have an affair with her.  Although he's flattered and admits she's attractive, he kindly rejects her offer.  Driving back to town, their car skids out of control.  Despite his insistence, Paige tries to convince Kevin that he was only hallucinating when he recalls seeing her in the afterlife.  While drifting off to sleep, Kevin remarks that Paige looked like an angel in the tunnel of light.  In the barn, Rafe and Alison give in to their  desire and make love for the first time.  They vow to make every second together count as Rafe will soon be returning to Heaven.",
