Ian is amused as an embarrassed Lucy quickly pays the Dancer to leave before he strips down to his Lucky Charms.  After the Dancer leaves, Ian gives Lucy a special gift of a four-leaf clover he found when he was a boy. Then Ian suggests that they go OUT for dinner!  \n\n\nAt Stephen's Studio, Elizabeth coldly informs Joshua that the thought of satisfying her cravings with Joshua is too repulsive for her to even consider it.    Joshua reminds Elizabeth that he is the only choice she has - unless she has a hidden lover somewhere.  Mrs. Clay insists that her husband is her only passion but it is obvious that Caleb has moved on.  Joshua brightens, as he observes:  \"So - I DID stir something in you, didn't I?\"\n\n\nELIZABETH:  \"You certainly did!  Utter disgust!\"\n\n\nJoshua reminds Elizabeth that Joshua plans to take Caleb's place and that Elizabeth has promised to help Joshua take Caleb down.  But Elizabeth retorts that that does NOT mean that Elizabeth would allow their relationship to become anything other than a business arrangement.  Joshua urges Elizabeth to just give in to her cravings but Elizabeth storms out of the room.  After Elizabeth leaves, Joshua chuckles to himself as he assures himself  that Elizabeth will come around eventually.\n\n\nAt Rafe's Loft, Rafe assures Jack that Lucy and Rafe will need to take care of eliminating Caleb.  Alison objects to the possibility of Rafe and Lucy doing away with Caleb in front of Tess.  Alison notices that Jack bought a replacement of Tess's doll for Tess's Valentine's Day gift and blasts Jack because it looks like Jack prefers to treat his new wife as a child!  Alison points out that Jack wants the sweet, innocent, untouched side of Tess while Caleb wants the evil, manipulative side of Livvie - but what Livvie AND Tess both need is a chance to become one whole, complete, integrated person!  Jack argues that Tess IS a complete person, just the way she is!  When Alison appeals to Rafe for Rafe's opinion, Rafe replies:  \"I think, given the chance, Caleb is going to turn Tess into something we do not even recognize.  And, if it were me, I would do anything to stop that!\"  Alison continues to warn Jack and Rafe that using Tess to get rid of Caleb could backfire and TESS could end up being the one who ends up VERY hurt by their plan!\n\n\nCaleb calls Tess up to the Scenic Overlook that he introduced her to and plays \"Newborn Heart\" for her, claiming that he wrote the song just for her.  Caleb informs Tess that he now believes that he is no longer destined to keep repeating the same mistake.  Caleb kisses Tess and told her that it is because he is grateful to her for the new life she has opened up for him.  Caleb then gives Tess a music box, claiming that Livvie was very fond of the music box and that the music from the box will bring Tess closer to Livvie.  Tess prophesies that Caleb WILL love again, even though Caleb can NOT have Livvie!    But, after Tess leaves, Caleb vows to himself:  \"Don't worry about me, Tess!  I WILL find love again!\"\n\n\nElizabeth arrives at Ian's Loft but arrives after Ian and Lucy have gone to dinner.  Elizabeth lets herself in to wait for Ian and makes herself comfortable by stripping down to almost nothing.  As she waits, Elizabeth spots Ian's research notes and reads:  \"Vampire symptoms are relieved when a vampire makes love with a slayer!\"  Elizabeth guesses that Ian is referring to his relationship with Lucy.  Meanwhile, Lucy and Ian are enjoying dinner out when someone sends a complimentary bottle of wine to their table.  When Lucy and Ian look around for their benefactor, they spot Kevin, who lifts his glass in salute!  Meanwhile, back at Rafe's Loft, Rafe gives Alison some pink roses and they promise each other that they will  forget about all of the evil lurking around Port Charles for a little while.  They promise that they will always talk through their differences of opinion.  Then they hit the sheets. At the same time, at the Scenic Overlook, Caleb affirms his belief that Livvie will find her way back to him, because Livvie has ALWAYS found her way back to Caleb.    Meanwhile, Tess sets a romantic mood for Jack at the River House.  But, as Tess writes a love letter for Jack, she opens Caleb's music box and begins to listen to the music and then begins to dance.  By the time that Jack returns home, Tess has turned into Livvie!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Thinking it's too dangerous for Tess, Ali suggests letting Tess heal Caleb, then goes to Tess and says she believes she can save Caleb.  Joshua reveals to Elizabeth that he's now a vampire and wants to be more powerful than Caleb.  He convinces her to help destroy Caleb after he tells her of Caleb's alleged infidelities.

While he and Tess enjoy a lazy morning at home, the others meet at Ian's loft to strategize. Alison and Rafe both believe that Tess is the key, but their goals are very different. Rafe wants to use Tess to make Caleb vulnerable enough to be killed, but Alison believes that Tess can heal him and make him a good person. The others give them some privacy to argue, and Lucy shocks Ian by speculating about how having sex with a slayer might affect Caleb. Despite Rafe's assurances, Alison is afraid that Tess will get hurt by his plan. She visits Tess and expresses confidence in her friend's ability to help \"Stephen.\" When Elizabeth struggles to understand how Joshua can be standing in the same room with her after she killed him, he answers her question by revealing a brand new set of fangs. He's grateful to her for doing what Caleb was never willing to do. Now he wants to take Caleb down, and he wants Elizabeth's help. She refuses until Joshua convinces her that her husband has had many affairs in the short time they've been married. Meanwhile, when Reese complains to Caleb about his behavior, he assures her that he knows exactly what he's doing. The Stephen Clay Experience plays \"Newborn Heart\" in its entirety as they make a live recording. Afterward, Caleb listens to the track and fantasizes that Livvie comes back to him.",
