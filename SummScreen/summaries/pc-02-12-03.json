    "tvmega_recap": "Lucy offers words of encouragement to a very discouraged Ian. When she surprises him with a visit from Tim and Danny, Ian gets to spend some time with his little boy. At Kevin's request, Caleb visits his jail cell. Kevin wants his help getting out of jail. Caleb agrees to help, with two conditions. The first one is that Kevin has to keep Lucy out of the Caleb's hair. As for the second condition, Caleb will ask a favor of Kevin at some point in the future, and Kevin must comply. Reese and \"Marissa\" face off in the park, and the angel uses her powers to knock her adversary off her feet. Jamal witnesses this and later confronts her about it. He knows that she's really Casey, not Marissa. Casey is upset about blowing her cover, but she's relieved by Jamal's offer to teach her how to be Marissa. Home again, Kevin thinks about his plans for his wife and her lover, and they're not pretty. Alison explains why she's changed her mind about letting Tess try to heal Caleb. Grateful for Alison's belief in her, Tess goes to try to find \"Stephen\" so that she can heal him. When Jack finds out, he's furious with Alison for talking her into this and endangering her life. At the studio, Joshua informs Tess that they have some unfinished business. Alarmed, Tess tries to get away, but Joshua insists on straightening things out. He apologizes for trying to kill her, then says that he doesn't want her to stay away from \"Stephen\" after all. Jack and Alison come to her rescue, and Alison is stunned to see the man her mother killed. Caleb is very angry with Joshua and asks for a reason not to kill him."
