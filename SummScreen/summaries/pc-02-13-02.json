Rafe wakes up and hears Alison's prayer. She told Rafe that what she feels for him is unlike anything she's ever felt before. They have so little time that they vow to take advantage and enjoy every moment they have left. Alison asks Rafe to close his eyes and think of a place he would like to go. Rafe decides on a beach. Alison then begins to paint a picture of what a tropical beach would look like. As they lay together, lost in their imaginations, Ed appears. In the next scene, Alison and Rafe open their eyes to discover that fantasy has become reality. They are on the same beach that Alison described.

After taking down one of the members, Jamal is ready for more action until Gabby unexpectedly appears.

Before he can take on the rest of the gang, one of them kicks Gabby to the ground. Jamal helps Gabby to her feet. She told him she is ok, but it is obvious that she is in pain. Jamal decides to take her to the hospital.\n\n\nIan's leg is stuck under the dashboard of his car so Amy is forced to drive. She works the pedals as Ian steers. Amy assures Ian she will be fine as long as he has his arms around her. At that moment, Ian jerks the wheel as he swerves to avoid a branch. The car comes to rest on the side of the road where Ian spots a call box. Before he can call for help, Eve is there at the car door, frantic with worry.\n\n\nAmy is ready to confess as to what they were really doing in the middle of nowhere, when Ian jumps in with Amy's original story that they were going to see one of Amy's patients. Eve suspiciously asks for the patient's name. Amy is taken aback by the question, but Ian explains that they were supposed to meet a patient, but they never showed up. Eve accepts the explanation then informs Amy that from now on, a car and driver will be made available to her when she needs to visit patients outside the hospital. Amy apologizes for causing trouble then allows Chris Ramsey to drive her home.\n\n\n",
