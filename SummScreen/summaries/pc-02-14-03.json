    "tvmega_recap": "Lucy's Valentine's Day gift to Ian goes hilariously wrong when the Taste of Ireland romantic dinner she thought she ordered turns out to be an adult entertainer who tries to strip for her. Instead of being offended or jealous, Ian is amused and grateful to have a reason to laugh again. He takes her out to dinner, and Kevin sends a bottle of champagne to their table. Elizabeth is sickened by the thought of feeding on Joshua, who insists that he's her only option. In his opinion, the special water is nothing like the real thing. Elizabeth vows that she'll never feed on him, but Joshua is confident that she'll soon find it necessary. Letting herself into Ian's loft, Elizabeth is disappointed to find that he's not there. She waits around impatiently, glancing at his research notes. She's not happy to realize that he may be sleeping with Lucy. Rafe informs Jack that he and Lucy will deal with Caleb. Alison is appalled to hear how they plan to use Tess, and she's even more disgusted to learn that Jack plans to give his wife a doll for Valentine's Day. She insists that Jack and Caleb are pulling her in two directions, never giving her a chance to be a complete person. At the overlook, Caleb plays \"Newborn Heart\" for Tess. After tenderly kissing her cheek, he also presents her with Olivia's music box, and the music has a subtle effect on her. Tess promises that he will find love again. Rafe gives Alison a dozen pink roses for Valentine's Day. She's still upset with him but agrees to let it go for now. They promise to always talk things out in the future. As Tess prepares for a romantic evening with Jack, she finds her eyes drawn to the music box. Unable to resist, she opens the lid. As the music plays, a change comes over her. She signs the card to Jack with Livvie's name."
