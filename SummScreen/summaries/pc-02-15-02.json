Kevin arrives and told them that Lucy left to pick up Serena and bring her back from a slumber party. In the meantime, it will be Kevin who puts Christina to bed tonight.  But Christina says:  'No. I don't want you!'\n\n\nAt the hospital, as Colleen and Eve talk about Eve's emergency patient, Eve told Colleen that she plans to meet Ian in the On-Call room - then Jamal brought  Gabriela in and explains that Gabriela has been in pain all night after being accidentally kicked during Jamal's fight.  Eve immediately calls for a wheelchair and told Gabriela that she has to be careful, since she DOES have only one kidney left.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the darkened On-Call room, Ian's button is caught on Amy's hair after Ian mistook Amy for Eve.\n\n\nIAN:  I thought you were Eve.\n\n\nAMY:  Did you, Ian?  Did you, really?\n\n\nMeanwhile, back in the Storage Room, Ricky says:  'I never met anyone like you before.'\n\n\nAnd Casey replies:  'You got that right.'\n\n\nSuddenly, Ricky's beeper went off.  Ricky is sure that it will be Mrs. Barrington, and since Ricky has designs on Amanda's diamond and emerald necklace, Ricky insists that he should answer the beeper in order to keep his boss happy.  But, when Ricky looks at the beeper, he announces that it's his sister and that there is some kind of emergency involving her.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Colleen told Eve that all the exam rooms are full but they can put Gabriela in the Luxury Suite, which is available. As she heads Gabriela toward the luxury suite, Eve asks Colleen to go to the On-Call room and tell Ian that it will be a little while before Eve will be able to join him.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the darkened On-Call Room, Ian says to Amy:  'I don't know what you're implying.'\n\n\nAMY:  I think you do.  You came here looking for Eve.  You saw the shape of a woman and assumed it was your wife.  Don't you know your own wife in the dark?\n\n\nWhen Ian argues and says he made a mistake, Amy observes that Ian ALWAYS seems to be saying that he is sorry and that he has made a mistake!  Then she lists the incidents - When she was staying at his place and he walked in on her while she was getting dressed.  Then, in the stalled car, when his hand just mistakenly wandered as he was trying to steer the car...\n\n\nJust then, Colleen enters the darkened on-call room and told Ian that Eve will be a bit longer.\n\n\nWhen Colleen leaves, Amy says:  \"I'm sorry if I unnerve you.'\n\n\nAnd Ian replies:  You do - and I think you enjoy it!'\n\n\nAt the Lighthouse, Paige told Christina how great Kevin really is and promises Christina that Kevin will draw her picture.  But as Paige and Christina settle down for Kevin to sketch, Christina begins playing with Paige's watch. Kevin suggests that he will put the watch out of Christina's reach, but , when Paige hesitates, Kevin adds: 'Unless there is some reason you don't want me to.'\n\n\nPaige observes that the watch has sentimental value to her.  But Kevin assures her:  \"I'm not going to hock it - just put it out of reach.'\n\n\nChristina remains interested in the watch as Kevin finally takes the watch and saying:  'lest we tempt her,' puts it over on a shelf.\n\n\nThen Kevin thanks Paige for helping Christina feel more secure around Kevin, observing that this is the FIRST significant breakthrough he has has with Christina since she arrived.  Kevin went on to observe that Paige is good with kids and that she would make a wonderful mother.\n\n\nHowever, Paige observes that she believes it is 'too late' for her. But Kevin assures her that EVEN a miracle like that COULD happen! Then Christina puts her head on Paige's lap and Paige decides it really is time for Cristina to go to bed. And Kevin picks up the watch!\n\n\nAt the hospital, Ricky and Casey arrive and Jamal immediately gets into an argument with Ricky.  When Colleen arrives to take Gabriela out for some more tests, Ricky and Jamal BOTH want to go along, but Eve says no.  Ricky told Jamal that he believes that Jamal conned Gabriela into donating her kidney to save Jamal's kid, and now there appears to be damage to Gabriela's  remaining kidney as a result of a fight Jamal was in!  As Jamal pushes away, Ricky picks up a scalpel from a nearby cart, but Casey sees him do it.\n\n\nIn the On-Call room, Amy admits to Ian that she DOES find his discomfort amusing - but she certainly did NOT plan it.\n\n\nIAN:  Not plan it per se.  BUT, you ARE the one who wants to have an affair.\n\n\nAmy moves away and told Ian that she is 'making room for his ego,' and reminds Ian that she ALSO told him she would NEVER act on her feelings and that she has respect for his marriage.  Then she adds: 'I'm sorry I told you. I should have known you would get all weird.'\n\n\nAs Ian observes that they got very close in a short period of time, Amy insists that she would never put Ian in a compromising situation. Of course, Amy suggests, they could ALSO 'go for it' and get it over with  -- have one big juicy kiss and get it out of their systems!\n\n\nBack in the Hospital Hall, Jamal and Ricky continue to argue and then Jamal abruptly leaves and Casey told Ricky she saw him take the scalpel.  But, when she urges Ricky to not be an idiot, Ricky told her to stay out of it.\n\n\nIn the On-Call room, Amy remembers Ed telling the angels that the Fifth Chair will be filled by someone close to them and the angel will help that person 'cross over.'  Amy suddenly says:  'NO!  It was a mistake.  A kiss would be a mistake.'  But, as Amy turns to leave, Ian briefly grabs her wrist and the cover to her watch suddenly flips open and Ian says, 'But I have a question for you,' as Amy pulls away and rushes out of the room.\n\n\nIan remembers Victor talking about finding the watch and mutters: 'It was the SAME watch!'\n\n\nAt the Lighthouse, as Paige puts Christina to bed, she told the little girl, 'This feels SO right - just like family.  This is where I'm meant to be,' and Christina agrees with her.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the studio, Kevin looks at Paige's watch, and concludes that it's just an ordinary watch until a vibrating alarm went off, and the watch pops open as there is a flash of light and the watch moves back one more number. Kevin says 'this is the watch that Victor found -- PAIGE took it!'\n\n\n",
