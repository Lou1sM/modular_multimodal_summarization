But Casey reminds Ricky that if he kills Jamal, he will go back to jail for good. Then Casey went on to tell Ricky, \"I agree with you,' that this situation calls for some serious payback, but that Ricky can't be stupid about it. 'If you GO after him, you need to PLAN it so NO ONE can tie it to you.'  They kiss and Casey promises to come up with a plan to get even with Jamal for putting Gabriela's life in danger.\n\n\nAt the Light House, Paige returns to Kevin's studio but finds that Kevin has left a note, saying he had been called away.  Paige quickly retrieves her watch and reassures herself that 'there is no way he could have seen underneath.'\n\n\nAt the Recovery Room, Ian arrives looking for Victor and is followed shortly by Kevin, who is ALSO looking for Victor.  Ian and Kevin begin to compare notes and realize they are BOTH looking for Victor to ask some questions about the watch that Victor found in the woods. Ian says that Amy has it, while Kevin is saying that PAIGE has it!\n\n\nIan and Kevin conclude that they have TWO strange watches, owned by TWO women who SAY they have never met before, but they obviously HAVE met somewhere before.  The watches BOTH have fake covers on them. Amy panicked when her watch set off Victor's machine.  And BOTH Amy and Paige arrived in Port Charles on New Year's Eve.\n\n\nIn the Alley, Paige and Amy secretly meet.  When Paige scolds Amy for being unavailable, Amy explains that she was in a car accident with Ian.  Paige notices immediately that Amy's watch case is open and asks Amy how long the watch has been that way and Amy replies:  \"How would I know?  I'm blind - remember.'  When Paige asks if Amy thinks Ian saw the watch, Amy reassures her friend that she is POSITIVE that Ian would have confronted her about it if he HAD seen it, 'because he is such a direct person.'  Then Paige describes HER close call with HER watch, which Kevin took off while he was sketching her.\n\n\nThen an agitated Amy begins to talk about her experience with Ian in the stranded car, saying that she has been 'trying to keep things under control, but he keeps messing things up.'  When Paige asks what it was that Ian did, Amy replies: 'He's been wonderful!'\n\n\nPAIGE:  And that's a problem, because...?\n\n\nAmy replies it is a problem because Ian is getting too close.  'You should have seen how amazing he was when we were stranded in the car.'\n\n\nWhen Paige asks what happened, Amy explains how Ian's leg got caught under the dashboard and that Amy drove because Ian could NOT do it. As Amy explains what it was like when Ian had his arms around her, she suddenly says:  \"It's not supposed to be like this -- Not supposed to be like this with him.'\n\n\nPAIGE:  What do you mean, it isn't supposed to be like this?  I thought you said you did NOT know Ian before you came here.\n\n\nAt the Recovery Room, Ian and Kevin realize that the watches must be counting down for thirteen weeks.  Kevin told about Lucy's investigation into Paige's youthful skin.  Then Ian asks:  'What if Victor is right?  What if these two women ARE...'\n\n\nKEVIN:  Extraterrestials?\n\n\nKEVIN:  Paige is STILL Paige\n\n\nIAN:  Or someone pretending to be her!\n\n\nKevin insists that that could NOT be possible because Paige knows intimate details about their time together that ONLY the real Paige could know.  But Ian points out that everyone made the same argument with AnneMarie.  Ian observes that they KNOW that Paige came to Port Charles to see Kevin.  But when Kevin asks how Amy might be connected to Ian, Ian insists that he does NOT know her and that Amy IS the kind of woman that he WOULD remember. Ian and Kevin then theorize that, since both women disappeared at the same time, maybe they were together?\n\n\nBack in the Alley, Amy covers by saying that 'being back isn't what I expected.' But Paige observes that it sounds like Amy was talking about Ian.  But Amy insists that she never met Ian while she was alive, although she wishes she HAD met him.  Paige observes that 'We all wish we could have the life we were meant to have.'  Amy then asks what Ian looks like and Paige describes him to her.  'I have a reason to be here,' Amy insists, 'and it does NOT include caring about Ian Thornhart.'\n\n\nPaige assures her friend that the BEST solution is to just stay away from Ian but then adds:  'Sometimes you just have to give in to your feelings.'  When Amy quizzes Paige about HER resolve to stay away from Kevin, Paige insists that she TRIED to leave, but Kevin WANTED her to stay and observes that the painting seems to mean a great deal to Kevin, 'It's as if the painting is re-awakening something for him.'\n\n\nAMY:  And for you!\n\n\nPaige went on to enthuse about how perfect it is to be able to be at the Light House with Kevin and his step-daughter.\n\n\nThen Amy reminds Paige to remember that there IS a Mamma Bear in the fairy tale that Paige is creating for herself with Kevin's step-daughter, Christina. When Amy observes that it is time for her to get back to the hospital, Paige says:  'And time for me to go HOME!'\n\n\nIn Gabriela's hospital room, Karen told her that her kidney is compromised and that Karen wants to put her on dialysis until they know for sure the extent of the damage.\n\n\nJamal offers to donate a kidney, blood or whatever it takes to get Gabriela well again. When Jamal suggests to Gabriela that she would be better off if they had NEVER learned that they were related, Gabriela reminds that KNOWING they were related WAS what helped save Hope's life.  Then Gabriela told him that she wants to see no more 'being down' about the accident -- that it truly WAS an accident and Jamal should NOT continue to blame himself about it. When Ricky asks if there would be anything HE could get for Gabriela, she asks for her rosary, which is at her apartment.  When Ricky admits he does not have 'wheels' to get there, Jamal hands him the keys to his bike and told him to take that.\n\n\nUnfortunately, in the alley, Casey has found Jamal's bike and cuts the brake line.\n\n\nAt the Recovery Room, Kevin and Ian continue to compare notes and Ian says:  \"I'm done guessing.  I'm going to ask Amy point blank.'  But Kevin told Ian that, since they do NOT know what the purpose of Amy and Paige's visit is, it probably would NOT be a good idea for either of them to realize that Ian and Kevin have found out about the watches.  Ian and Kevin conclude that 'something's going to happen in 13 weeks -- but what?'\n\n\nIn the alley, alone, Amy talks to 'Papa!' :  'Ian's been wonderful. He's trying to get to me.  And I let him, for a moment.  But it won't happen again, Papa. I won't be fooled!'\n\n\nAt the Light House, Paige returns and is greeted by Christina.  Paige says that she has something to show Christina and brought  out a sweater and Paige told Christina that Paige bought a matching sweater for herself.\n\n\nAt the hospital, as Karen leaves Gabriela's room, she calls Frank and says 'There is something we need to do for Gabriela.'\n\n\nCasey returns to Gabriela's room and learns from Jamal that Ricky just left to get something for Gabriela - and that Ricky will be taking Jamal's bike.  As Casey rushes out, Ricky finds Jamal's bike in the alley, revs up the bike and takes off.\n\n\n",

However, Amy privately vows to her father she won't allow herself to get close to Ian.
