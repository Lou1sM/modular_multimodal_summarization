    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Elizabeth's hotel room, Elizabeth told herself that going to bed with her daughter's fianc\u00e9 would not count because Elizabeth would only be doing that in order to save her life. However, Elizabeth was disappointed when she answered her door and discovered that it was Alison, rather than Rafe, who was standing there. Alison explained that she was there because Rafe had had something to do, but Alison had felt it was important to check on her mother. Elizabeth explained that she had some questions about her \"condition\" that Elizabeth believed she needed to discuss with Rafe. \n\n\nAs Elizabeth and Alison talked, Elizabeth changed her mind about seducing Rafe and, instead, agreed to go apartment hunting with Alison later. Alison dropped a hint that Rafe had a plan that would end Caleb's reign of terror in Port Charles soon, but Alison clammed up when Elizabeth asked for more details about Rafe's plan. After Alison left the hotel room, Elizabeth congratulated herself for deciding that she could resist the temptation to bed Rafe in order to get rid of her \"symptoms.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Jack's river house, Jack filled Jamal and Rafe in on the way that Caleb's music box had turned Tess into Livvie -- just like flipping a switch. When Rafe pointed out that whoever controlled the box could control when Livvie would appear and asked Jack for the box, Jack admitted that he had already smashed the music box into a million pieces. Rafe warned Jack that smashing the box had not been a smart move. Rafe went on to explain that, if they opened the box and Livvie appeared, Caleb would let his guard down, and while Caleb was distracted, they would be able to deliver a death blow to the evil monster. \n\n\nRafe told Jack and Jamal that Caleb would not have let the box out of his hands if Caleb had known the box would produce Livvie, so Rafe declared that Rafe was presuming that Caleb did not know that the box had the power to turn Tess into Livvie. Rafe suddenly remembered Caleb informing him that the balance between good and evil had to be maintained so that, when Rafe returned to earth, Caleb got to return as well. When Jack, Jamal, and Rafe went to look in the trash for the smashed music box, they were surprised when they discovered that the box was not in the trash any longer. \n\n\nAs Jack, Jamal, and Rafe decided to continue looking for the music box, Jamal asked how many times Caleb would have to die before that evil monster really died. Rafe declared that \"this time\" would be different because a slayer would kill Caleb. Rafe also suggested that they find a way to keep Caleb off his water, so Caleb would become more vulnerable. Rafe assured Jack that everything would be done to protect Tess. \n\n\nAs Jack, Jamal, and Rafe got ready to go look again for the music box, Alison arrived, and Jack, Jamal, and Rafe tried to evade Alison's questions about their plans. But Alison told them that she knew they were evading and asked to speak to Rafe alone. After Jack and Jamal left, Alison told Rafe that she had just seen Elizabeth, and it had appeared that her mother had been freaking out, so Alison asked Rafe to visit Elizabeth and answer some of her mother's questions. Rafe agreed to go and asked Alison to stay at the river house to be with Tess. \n\n\nAt Stephen's studio, Ricky spotted Casey, still posing as Marissa, and told the angel that her on-again, off-again routine had him confused. Meanwhile, inside the studio, Reese and Caz complained to Joshua about the changes in Caleb since he had written the song \"Newborn Heart.\" Caleb suddenly appeared and announced that they were getting rid of \"Newborn Heart\" and returning to their traditional form of music. Caz and Reese were enthusiastic about the changes Caleb had announced. \n\n\nLater, as the band practiced, Caleb admitted he liked some of the changes Ricky had made in one of the songs. When the band took a break after rehearsal, Reese approached Caleb and reminded the boss that they still had a problem with Ricky. Caleb gave Reese permission to nibble on Ricky, but Joshua listened in on Reese's plan. Reese later went to Ricky and told him that The Stephen Clay Experience was planning a big party and asked Ricky to go with her to the big bash. \n\n\nCasey overheard Ricky agreeing to go with Reese and later tried to warn Ricky not to go with Reese. Ricky angrily ordered Casey to butt out of his life and quit ruining his good time. Meanwhile, Caleb remembered Kevin's warning that the longer Caleb was around humans, the more Caleb became like the humans he so despised. Just then, Reese reported back about her plans for nibbling on Ricky. As Reese told Caleb how grateful she was, Caleb began to kiss Reese, and Reese jumped into Caleb's lap and returned his kisses.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in her hotel room, Elizabeth wondered what she should do to get rid of her symptoms if she did not hop into bed with Rafe. Elizabeth was pleasantly surprised when Rafe showed up at her door, and Elizabeth welcomed her daughter's fianc\u00e9 with open arms. At the same time, Joshua left an urgent message on Elizabeth's phone, informing his partner that he needed her -- immediately.\n\n\nAfter Rafe left Jack's river house, Tess walked out of the next room, holding the music box. As Jack and Jamal searched through the trash on the front porch, looking for the music box, Tess showed the music box to Alison and told her that Jack had said he was throwing the box away but had to have changed his mind. Alison observed that the music box looked familiar. Tess opened the music box and, when the music began to play, Tess turned into Livvie in front of an astonished Alison. \n\n\n",

Rafe worries when Jack reveals that he smashed the offending box to smithereens. He thinks they need the music box to get to Livvie, and ultimately to Caleb. They decide to retrieve it from the trash and try to put it back together, but it's gone. Rafe thinks they still have a chance, but having the music box would help. Jamal wants to know how to kill Caleb and actually make him stay dead. Rafe is confident it will work this time because a slayer will be the one to kill him. Alison stops by the house and asks Rafe to pay her mother a visit. Ricky confronts \"Marissa\" about her \"bipolar\" behavior. Caleb informs the band that from now on they'll be playing rock music instead of songs like \"Newborn Heart.\" He finally gives Reese permission to turn Ricky, and she shows her gratitude by letting Caleb feed on her. Ricky accepts Reese's invitation to be her date to the band's party, and he won't listen when \"Marissa\" tries to talk him out of it. Elizabeth regrets calling off the visit from Rafe, and she's pleasantly surprised when he shows up at her room anyway. After hearing Caleb give Reese permission to turn Ricky, Joshua tries unsuccessfully to reach Elizabeth. Jack and Jamal sift through the trash again but eventually give up. Tess carries the music box into the living room and shows it to Alison. When Tess allows the music to play, Livvie returns.",
