Rafe explained that Jack had finally agreed to let them use Tess to con Caleb into dropping his guard and that, in fact, Jack would be the one who would set Tess up. Lucy was shocked when Rafe declared that Rafe could not be the one to exterminate Caleb -- Lucy would have to do the job. When Ian was suspicious of the reason why it had to be Lucy who took Caleb out, Rafe answered that he would explain all of that to Lucy -- alone. \n\n\nAfter Ian left, Rafe reminded Lucy that Rafe could not eliminate Caleb because of the balance between good and evil -- when Rafe had gotten a pass back to earth, Caleb had also gotten the same kind of pass. Rafe explained a slayer had to make the kill if they ever wanted to be rid of the evil monster, and Lucy was the only one left who could take Caleb out. Lucy asked whether, if Lucy terminated Caleb, that also meant that Rafe would have to return to the hereafter, as well, but Rafe confessed that he did not know the answer to her question. When Ian returned, Lucy fibbed that Caleb would suspect Rafe of trying to eradicate Caleb but would not suspect Lucy because Caleb was too arrogant to realize that Lucy might be strong enough to face Caleb. \n\n\nAt Jack's river house, Jack reminded Tess that Jack was supportive of Tess's mission to \"heal\" Caleb. However, Jack convinced Tess that Caleb hid behind a wall, and that was the reason why it was so difficult for even Tess to reach down far enough to be able to awaken the goodness that Tess believed was buried deep inside Caleb. Jack explained to Tess that Jack believed that the water that Caleb drank provided a \"mask\" that Caleb could hide behind. Jack suggested that Tess was the only one who could successfully get Caleb to quit depending on the water long enough for Caleb to drop his mask and allow Tess to heal the evil monster. \n\n\nA delighted Tess sweetly thanked Jack for understanding Tess's mission and thinking about getting rid of the water as a way to reach Caleb. Tess announced that she would go out to find Caleb right away and take Caleb to the scenic overlook to convince Caleb to give up drinking the water. When Tess rushed out to meet Caleb, Jack followed her.\n\n\nCaleb's party was in full swing at Stephen's studio, and Joshua guardedly congratulated Caleb for recovering Caleb's former evil persona. Reese reported to Caleb that she was prepared to feast on Ricky before the night was finished, and Reese greeted Ricky enthusiastically when the drummer made an appearance. Joshua asked Caleb if he planned to move on and forget all about Olivia -- and Tess. Caleb insisted to his suspicious band manager that Caleb had already forgotten.\n\n\nAs Jamal sauntered through the park, Jamal was surprised when angel Casey sprang out at him and demanded Jamal's immediate help in protecting Ricky from getting bitten by Reese. Casey explained that she was not allowed to interfere to rescue Ricky -- but Jamal could interfere. After Casey explained her plan, Jamal rushed to Caleb's party. When Jamal arrived at the party, he found Ricky and slugged Ricky for kissing Jamal's girl -- \"Marissa.\"  However, as Casey watched in horror from a hidden corner, Caz showed up and threatened to teach Jamal some \"manners\" for Caz's \"good friend,\" Ricky. \n\n\nBack at Ian's loft, Rafe explained that the plan was for Tess to convince Caleb to quit drinking the water. Then, when Caleb had grown weakened from being without the water, they would open the music box when Tess and Caleb were together, and Livvie would appear. Lucy would pull the trigger while Caleb was distracted with the phenomena of seeing Livvie again. \n\n\nLucy assured Rafe that Lucy believed they would all be there to celebrate their victory over Caleb. Rafe returned to the car to get Lucy's silver slayer gun. While Rafe was gone, Ian assured Lucy that Ian believed that she would be successful in eradicating Caleb. Rafe returned with the gun and showed Lucy how to use it. \n\n\nCaleb took a break from his party and saw Joshua as Joshua left. After Joshua was gone, Caleb remembered that Kevin suspected that Caleb was becoming human. Caleb also remembered Tess announcing that she could feel the goodness inside Caleb. Tess suddenly arrived, but Caleb rudely brushed her off and told Tess that they would not be talking again -- ever. \n\n\nAs Jack watched from hiding, Jack silently willed Tess to just take Caleb at his word and leave. However, Tess suddenly reminded Caleb that she truly believed that there was good inside Caleb. Before leaving, Tess confessed that, in her own way, she did love Caleb. Caleb suddenly asked Tess to wait. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Rafe tells Lucy it's time to kill Caleb, gives her a pistol and says she must do the deed. He explains the balance of good and evil and says once Caleb's destroyed, his life might end too. Jack lies to Tess that he thinks she can heal Caleb.  He tells her to get rid of Caleb's \"\"water\"\" to get to his true feelings. Caleb holds a party to celebrate the return of the \"\"real\"\" Stephen Clay. Casey tells Jamal he has to stop Ricky from becoming a vampire as she can't interfere. Jamal goes to the party and punches Ricky out but Caz interferes. Tess shows up but Caleb asks her to leave- until she says she loves him.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Casey enlists Jamal's help to protect Ricky. At the party, Caleb celebrates being himself again. Reese prepares to bite Ricky, but Jamal picks a fight with him to get him away from the vamp. Casey worries when Caz steps in to help Ricky. Ian is frustrated about the failure his antidote. Rafe informs Lucy and Ian that it's time to go after Caleb, adding that Lucy is the one who has to actually slay the vampire. Lucy doesn't like this, but Rafe convinces her that she's the only one who can do the job. Lucy worries about what will happen to her cousin when she kills Caleb, but Rafe really doesn't know what will happen. They just have to hope for the best. Lucy is encouraged by Ian's belief in her, and when Rafe hands her a silver gun, she feels confident that she can use it. Jack tells Tess that the only way to help Caleb is to make him stop drinking the water. Tess is happy to be working with her husband on this, but he feels very guilty about his deceit. Tess finds Caleb, but he doesn't want to talk to her now or ever again. It hurts Tess that he could turn his back on her so easily. She tells him that she does love him in her own way. This clearly has an effect on him.",
