Caz remained determined to make it about Caz. Jamal pretended to be willing to take the disagreement outside, but, as Caz followed Jamal, Jamal suddenly turned around and slugged Caz. Reese angrily warned Jamal that Jamal would be sorry for punching Caz. \n\n\nAlison panicked when she discovered that she could not reach Rafe. When Alison confided her worry to her mother, Elizabeth could offer little to allay her daughter's fears. Alison declared that she was positive that Rafe had gone to face Caleb. Elizabeth tried to assure Alison that if Rafe had gone to eliminate his evil adversary then Rafe would succeed in his plan to eliminate the evil monster who had destroyed all of their lives. Alison flashed back to Rafe's explanation about the balance of good and evil and how it had enabled Rafe to gain a second chance at life on earth to be with Alison. Alison fell asleep and found herself in the midst of a horrible dream in which she learned that  Rafe had to leave her because Caleb was dead. \n\n\nAt Ian's loft, Ian made a cup of soothing tea for Lucy to help calm her nerves before she left for her first solo attempt to rid the world of Caleb's evil. Rafe also tried to assure Lucy that she would succeed in destroying their evil enemy, but Lucy began to worry that Rafe might never see Alison again if Rafe was yanked back to the hereafter as soon as Caleb landed in hell. Rafe insisted that they needed to just concentrate on the job at hand. \n\n\nJack called to report that Tess was still working on Caleb but appeared to be making some headway. Lucy encouraged Rafe to call Alison before they headed out to face Caleb, but Rafe refused. Lucy grabbed the silver gun and announced that it was time for them to destroy Caleb. However, as Rafe, Lucy, and Ian left the building, Kevin noticed them leaving and followed. \n\n\nOutside Caleb's party, Caleb stopped Tess from leaving and asked how Tess could still have faith that there was goodness inside Caleb that was worth saving when Tess knew that Caleb was ruthlessly using Tess to get to Livvie. Tess declared that she believed that Caleb was only trying to create someone who could love him as he really was. Tess knocked the blue bottle of water out of Caleb's hand, proclaiming that Caleb did not need the water. \n\n\nWhen Caleb picked up the bottle, Tess accused Caleb of hiding behind the water because it masked the real Caleb. Tess announced that, in order to heal Caleb's heart, Tess needed to get close to the real man, not the persona that had been forced upon him by his evil family in centuries past. Caleb confessed that he regretted that he had ever shared his shameful family secrets with Tess. Tess stroked Caleb's cheek and invited Caleb to accompany her so that she could heal his wounded heart. \n\n\nWhen Tess extended her hand, Caleb gratefully accepted it. Tess kissed Caleb's fingertips and led him away. Jack was thrilled when he realized that Tess was on the verge of success. However, when Jack stepped out of the shadows to follow Tess and Caleb, he discovered that two toughs were blocking his path. Jamal ran up and reported to Jack that ghouls were pursuing Jamal. When the thugs caught up with Jack and Jamal, the goons knocked Jack unconscious. \n\n\nWhen the police officers arrived, the fight began to break up. A panic-stricken Casey desperately looked for Ricky, but did not find the drummer and was afraid that Reese might still follow through on her plan to feast on Ricky. At the same time, Reese finally cornered her tasty drummer boy and promised to give Ricky the \"gift that keeps on giving.\"   \n\n\nMeanwhile, Jamal picked Jack up off the ground and revived him. As Jack and Jamal headed off to catch up with Tess, the police officers noticed them and decided to arrest Jack and Jamal. When the police put handcuffs on Jack, Jamal began to pretend that he was falling-down drunk and took his car keys out. As Jamal screamed for his mama, the police handcuffed Jamal. While the police were distracted by Jamal's antics, Jack freed himself and ran away to catch up with Caleb and Tess.\n\n\nAs Caleb and Tess approached the scenic overlook, Lucy confessed to Ian that she was afraid she would not succeed in destroying their evil adversary. Ian assured Lucy that Ian was confident that Lucy would succeed in saving the world from Caleb, and they would all soon have a reason to celebrate. Rafe, Lucy, and Ian hid in the shadows and waited for Tess and Caleb to appear. When Caleb arrived with Tess, Caleb admitted that he was not surprised that Tess had taken him to the scenic overlook. Tess gently encouraged Caleb to let himself go so he could open himself up to his feelings. \n\n\nCaleb complained that he needed his water, but Tess insisted that Caleb's water would only stand in the way of Caleb discovering his human emotions. Tess proclaimed to Caleb that it was meant to be and urged Caleb not to be afraid because Tess was convinced that that moment was the reason why Caleb had created Tess in the first place. Caleb announced that he only wanted Livvie back. Caleb did not want love and did not want to be healed. Caleb suggested that it was Tess who needed to look inside and find the woman inside of herself whom Caleb desired. Tess vowed that she would never allow Livvie to return.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rafe, Lucy, and Ian lurked in the shadows and wondered why Jack had not yet appeared. However, Kevin spotted the group and moved closer to discover what their mission was. \n\n\nMeanwhile, as Caleb angrily demanded to see Livvie, Tess valiantly continued to stand her ground and gently urged the evil monster to tell her what was in his heart. Caleb declared that there was only darkness in his heart. At the same time, Jack slipped close and quietly opened the music box. When Caleb heard the music, he stopped dead in his tracks. But the tune also enticed Livvie to emerge from within Tess. Kevin witnessed the emergence of his daughter and happily started toward the couple. However, Lucy drew her gun, aimed, and shot.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Casey found Ricky alone, with Reese poised behind the drummer, ready to sink her teeth into Ricky's neck.\n\n\n\n",

Caleb doesn't understand how Tess could say that she loves him, considering what she knows about him. Tess believes that he created her to love him for who he is. She knocks the water out of his hand, saying that it keeps her from reaching the man inside. She persuades him to go with her to the overlook. As soon as they're gone, Jack comes out of hiding but is immediately stopped by the band's security guards. He assures them that he doesn't want to crash the party. Casey watches nervously as Jamal throws Caz a sucker punch and runs out of the building. Jack is still there when Jamal gets outside. Suddenly, Caz swings, Jamal ducks, and Jack ends up on the ground. When the police arrest Jack, Jamal creates a diversion to let him get away. Reese prepares to give a clueless Ricky \"the gift that keeps on giving.\" Casey arrives in time to see the vamp bare her fangs, but she doesn't know what to do about it. At the overlook, Tess continues to work on Caleb, but he doesn't want her help. Despite her insistence to the contrary, all he wants is to have Olivia back. Tess vows that she'll never let that happen. Caleb is puzzled when he hears the familiar sounds of the music box. When Livvie surfaces, he is absolutely thrilled.
