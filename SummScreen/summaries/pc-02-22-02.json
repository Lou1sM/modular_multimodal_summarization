Amy asks if he is referring to the talk about their mutual but harmless attraction to one another.  OR Amy's mysterious past.\n\n\nAmy is intrigued when Ian admits to her that it is a little of both and  that there are a few things HE has NOT been honest about with HER. When Ian suggests that they need to talk about it, Amy says she is ready.  But Ian says 'not here.'  When Amy asks WHERE Thornhart DOES want to go - Ian told Amy that he has a place he'd like to show her and asks if she would go with him.  Amy puts out her hand and says 'lead the way,' as Ian remembers the fingerprint expert telling him that 'no human hand has touched that coffee cup.'\n\n\nAMY:  May I ask where we're going?\nIAN:  You'll know when we get there.\n\n\nAt the Lighthouse, as Paige kisses Kevin passionately, she insists that she is so happy to know that he feels the same way that she feels.  But Kevin told her - NO - that his heart belongs with Lucy.\n\n\nAt Lucy's place, Alison is trying to convince Rafe that it would be a good idea for them to have a child together.  Alison is convinced that it was 'our destiny to find each other and fall in love.' And a baby would be a way that she could always have a little bit of Rafe with her.  'Our having a child is what is meant to be,' Alison insists.\n\n\nIn Casey's room (we presume at the Scanlons, although we never did see her move in there), Casey is contemplating the key around her neck and listening to loud music.  Ricky suddenly comes in and Casey immediately leaps to the conclusion that Ricky's sister Gabriela has died and is 'in the fifth chair.'  Ricky once again asks her what she means by the Fifth Chair, and Casey covers up by saying it's a local expression where she grew up that means the same as 'bought the farm,' etc.  Ricky told her that the reason he has come is to ask her why she ran away when they were getting hot and heavy in the alley the other day.  Casey at first says it's because she didn't think an Alley was a good place for what she had in mind.  But Ricky insists that it is more likely that Casey is a virgin - but when he makes that suggestion, Ricky turns up the volume on the stereo to drown him out.\n\n\nAt the Lighthouse, Kevin insists to Paige that he DOES care about the memories they share together, but they ARE only memories of a great time in their lives when they were kids.  But Paige insists that Kevin is NOT the sort of person who would say ANY of the things he HAS been saying to her UNLESS he meant them.  Then Paige reminds Kevin that 'you can't let me go.' Paige then went on to insist that she and Kevin know each other 'inside out.'  But Kevin quickly told Paige that there IS a LOT he does NOT know.\n\n\nPAIGE:  I have nothing to hide.  Admit your love for me and I'll tell you everything - Everything you want to know.'\n\n\nAt that point, Lucy and Christina arrive and Lucy says: 'Doc?'\n\n\nMeanwhile, down in Casey's room, Casey insists to Ricky that she HAS been around a lot, but Ricky told her he thinks it is 'awesome' that Casey is a virgin and he ALSO told her she should drop the tough chick act.  Ricky insists that he showed up because he likes her and Casey and Ricky decide they will be friends again.\n\n\nAt Lucy's place, Rafe told Alison that her plan for a family 'blows me away,' but told Alison that she does not understand because, when he went back into heaven, she will not really be losing him, whether there is a baby or not.  Rafe went on to remind Alison that having a baby is a pretty big thing and that it is not something she should think about taking on all by herself.  Rafe emphasizes that it would not be fair to Alison OR to the child.  What, for example, would Alison be able to tell the baby about his (or her) dad?  That he was an angel who blew into town for a few weeks and then disappeared? Alison responds that she would tell the baby that his father was the most amazing, gentle, kind, fun person who ever lived, who was here for TOO short a time and now is up in heaven.\n\n\nAlison insists that she believes they were 'made to keep this connection.'\n\n\nWhen Rafe told Alison that he believes that SHE is the true miracle, Alison reminds him that she told him she wanted to see all his dreams come true - but one of those dreams was to have a family with Alison. 'Soon,' Alison observes, 'that dream - it will be lost to both of us.'  'What if,' Alison continues, 'we were MEANT to do this?'\n\n\nAt the Lighthouse, Kevin hastily says:  'Lucy -- you're back?' As Lucy explains that Christina wasn't feeling well, Christina went over to Paige and asks Paige if she would read her a story.  Paige says that, of course,  she will read a story to Christina, but when she went to pick up Christina, she notices how warm she is.  But Paige leaves with Christina.\n\n\nAs soon as Paige is out of earshot, Lucy says:  'Start talking because I am VERY upset. '\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ian and Amy have arrived in an alley in Manhattan, which is the alley where Amy was shot and killed.  Amy remembers being shot and then begins to insist to know WHY Ian has brought her to this particular place.\n\n\nIAN:    'You match a Jane Doe the police discovered in this alley.'\n\n\nAmy becomes flustered, saying she thought he cared and that was the second time she had made that mistake.   In the ensuing argument, Amy blurts out: 'You want to know what I am?  What I am is an....'As she says those words, there is a clap of thunder and Amy vanishes.\n\n\nAt Casey's room, as Ricky and Casey are just about to indulge in some passionate love-making, there is a clap of thunder and Casey disappears.\n\n\nAt the Lighthouse, Kevin admits to Lucy that he was pumping Paige for information because Paige has, well, 'secrets.'  Paige is upstairs, reading a bedtime Story to Chrisina when the thunder bolt ALSO causes Paige to disappear.\n\n\nAt Lucy's place, Alison is on the brink of getting Rafe to agree with her plan when the same thunder clap whisks Rafe away as well. Alison says:  'Oh, My God - What DID I do?'\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Alison explains why she wants Rafe's baby.  Although he's hesitant, she asks him to think about it.  Paige kisses Kevin, thinking he loves her, but he sets her straight.  Lucy interrupts and Kevin explains he was trying to discover Paige's secret.  After Ricky tells Casey it's cool she's a virgin, she asks him to make love to her.  Ian takes Amy to the alley where she was murdered and asks her who she really is.  Upset, Amy almost admits the truth.  In a flash of light, Amy vanishes; Paige disappears while reading to Christina; Casey disappears before making love to Ricky; and Rafe vanishes from Ali's arms.",
