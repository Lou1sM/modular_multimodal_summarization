Alison explained that she and Rafe had just been talking about having a baby when he'd disappeared, and Alison had no way to know where he had gone. Alison was shocked when her friend told her she should be glad Rafe was gone.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the Manhattan alley, a surprised Ian searched for Amy but found only one old homeless man.\n\n\nAt the lighthouse, Lucy and Kevin entered the studio and were shocked to find Christina alone. When they asked where Paige had gone, Christina replied, \"She was right here, and then she wasn't there anymore.\"\n\n\nIan called Kevin and told him that Amy had literally vanished right before his eyes just as she had been about to tell him what had been going on with her. Kevin admitted that Paige had also disappeared. Ian asked if Kevin meant that she had left the house, but Kevin told Ian she had vanished.\n\n\nMeanwhile, \"Upstairs,\" Angel Boss Ed admonished Rafe, Amy, Paige, and Casey for their unangelic behavior. As Ed listed the angels' various misdeeds, he began by reminding Rafe that it was not wise to be thinking about starting a family with his pretty blonde girlfriend. Turning to Paige, Ed pointed out that Kevin was not strolling down memory lane for the exercise -- rather, Kevin was fishing to find out who Paige was and where she was from.\n\n\nPaige hotly protested that that simply was not true, insisting that Kevin loved her. Ed continued, saying Amy was just about to spill everything to Ian. When Casey pointed out that she was not talking, Ed reminded Casey that she was all set to lose her virginity to someone she'd just met. \"You four delinquents are making me look bad, very bad,\" Ed informed them, \"and it leaves me no choice except to put an end to it.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile as Ian and Kevin spoke on the phone, they discovered there had been a flash of lighting in both places when Amy and Paige had disappeared. Ian asked whether or not Paige had touched anything before she'd disappeared, and Kevin mentioned the book Paige had been reading to Christina. Ian suggested that Kevin dust for fingerprints and further suggested that Kevin wouldn't find anything, and it would be as if she hadn't even existed.\n\n\nLucy returned and was very angry that Paige had left Christina alone, especially since Christina was not feeling well.\n\n\nIn Heaven, Ed admonished Paige for playing games with \"the white light,\" as Paige insisted that Kevin was not stringing her along. Ed told them bluntly, \"You four have broken the rules, big time.\"\n\n\nAmy admitted that Ian had almost tricked her into revealing the truth about herself but said she was onto him. Ed continued, as he pointed out to Casey that it was okay for her to like Ricky, and Casey quickly observed that Ricky would be a total pain up in Heaven, so it should be okay for Ed to leave Ricky alone. Ed said he could see what was inside Casey's heart. Casey asked how he could know what was in her heart when she didn't. Ed told her not to give away something that was precious to her until it meant something.\n\n\nEd went on to point out that Rafe should know better than any one of them that he had no business discussing starting a family with Alison. \"How many angels do you see carrying diaper bags?\" Ed asked, answering his own question, \"Zero!\" Ed pointed out that who did and who did not have children was decided in Heaven, so Rafe's plans for a family with Alison would not get very far without heavenly assistance.\n\n\nAs Paige angrily insisted that they were tired of being scolded like schoolchildren, she asked what their punishment could be. Amy pointed out that they were already dead, and Casey asked what she would be waiting for -- and asked if she'd find another angel. Casey insisted that her decisions about Ricky were her private business and that Ed had no business talking about that in front of everyone.\n\n\nWhen Paige said, \"Everyone who is tired of the unending criticism should raise their hands,\" all the angels raised their hands. Amy pointed out that they were doing the best they could, and if Ed didn't like it, he could just go to hell. Rafe said, \"Oh, oh,\" and then urged Ed to stop, as Amy continued saying, \"We're capable of taking care of ourselves.\" Ed clapped his hands, and the women disappeared. Rafe asked where they had gone, and Ed said, \"Amy saying 'go to hell' gave me an idea.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, back at the lighthouse, Lucy ranted to Kevin about what an improper houseguest Paige had turned out to be, Kevin admitted that he had been trying to figure out Paige and insisted that he was going to find out what her purpose was.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Lucy's place, Alison was insisting to Livvie that Rafe was not like Caleb. \"Rafe is good and gentle and kind, and he loves me, and now he is gone.\" Livvie admitted that she did like Rafe but that Caleb and Rafe both shared one thing in common, and that was that they were fantasy men who used magic to dazzle. Livvie said, \"It's magic -- a trick -- that does not last.\"\n\n\nAlison reminded her friend that if Rafe was not an angel -- but a mortal with only a couple of weeks left to live -- Livvie would see nothing wrong with loving someone who would be gone in a few weeks. Livvie pointed out that maybe it had been Rafe's last noble act, and that was why he was gone. Alison insisted that Rafe had not wanted to leave and wanted to spend every possible moment with Alison that he could. Alison then told Livvie that Rafe had been worried that he would be \"called back\" if anyone figured out about there being angels in Port Charles then asked whether or not Livvie had told someone else about Rafe being an angel.\n\n\nMeanwhile, up in Heaven, Rafe told Ed that he believed Ed had played a \"cheap trick\" on Casey, Amy, and Paige, so Ed clapped his hands again, and the not-so-angelic angels returned, indicating it had been a bit warm where they had just been. Ed then told them all that he needed to remind them that their journey could end up in one of two ways, and it was amazing what a little field trip could do.\n\n\nWhen Amy asked if their blunders meant they would all be pulled back, Ed admitted that it was too late, because they had started things down below that had to be finished. So, Ed told them that he would have to clock out and go down to try to straighten out the mess they had made of things. When Rafe asked about the Fifth Chair, Ed told him that he would find out when the time arrived -- and not before.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Lucy's place, Livvie insisted to Alison that she had never told anyone about Rafe, adding that, if she'd wanted to blow the whistle on Rafe, she would have done it a long time before. As she prepared to leave, Livvie told Alison, \"This can only end badly for you, Alison. Trust me!\"\n\n\nAfter Livvie left, Alison continued to cry alone until she felt a pair of arms around her and realized that Rafe had returned as mysteriously as he had disappeared. Clutching him fiercely, Alison sobbed, \"Don't ever leave!\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the lighthouse, Lucy was in Kevin's studio, studying Paige's portrait, when Christina arrived and asked, \"Is Paige back yet?\" When Lucy admitted that their guest was still away, Christina asked, \"Did Paige go to heaven like my other Mommy? Lucy assured Christina that Paige was fine and took Christina out to tuck her back into bed and read her another story.\n\n\nDownstairs, Ian arrived, and he and Kevin discussed whether they thought Paige and Amy were ghosts, space aliens, or maybe even vampires. As they compared notes, they discussed how both Amy and Paige had shown up at the same time, both had identical watches, and both of them had left at the same time, Their discussion was interrupted by the doorbell. As he went to answer the door, Kevin suggested to Ian that he should fix him a drink -- he thought they were going to need one. But when Kevin answered the door, Amy and Paige walked in, followed by Ed.\n\n\nIan asked Ed who he was. Ed said, \"Someone with answers for you about Amy and Paige. It's time you knew the truth.\"\n\n\n",
