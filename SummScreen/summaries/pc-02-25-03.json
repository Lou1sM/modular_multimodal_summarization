Rafe, Ian, Alison and Lucy move Caleb's corpse and Rafe performs a slayer ritual on the body, drives a stake in his heart, then leaves Caleb alone for solitude. Alison's upset she almost lost Rafe again, but he's able to calm her by getting her to focus on them. Ian thanks Lucy for saving him and helps her wash away the bad memories of kiling Caleb with a shower, where they make love. Tess is furious Jack lied to her to kill Caleb. Tess goes to Caleb's body to heal him and removes the stake. When she thinks she's failed, Caleb opens his eyes and smiles at her.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Alison panics at the thought that Rafe could be gone, while Lucy tries to explain why he didn't call her. They're both relieved when Rafe returns; he was just trying to call Alison. Tess begs Caleb to open his eyes. She just needs some time to heal him. Jack drags her home to keep her from getting that chance. Rafe and the others gather around Caleb's body to prepare it for the ceremony. They take it to a crypt. Rafe begins the vampire burial rite, which ends when he drives a wooden stake through Caleb's heart. At home, Tess is inconsolable. Jack's attempts to explain why he did this don't help. He goes outside for more firewood, and when he returns, she's gone. Lucy is thankful that Ian is back to normal, but she wishes there were a way to wash off what they did. Ian has a way; they take a shower together and make love. Rafe admits that he didn't know what would happen to him. However, instead of dwelling on that, he decided to focus on Alison and their love for each other. Alison can't stop thinking about how Tess was trying to bring Caleb back to life, but Rafe is looking forward to a nice, sunny day tomorrow. They make love. Tess knows exactly where to find Caleb's body. She pulls out the stake and cries about her failure to help him. Laying her head down on his chest, she says that she should have let him have Livvie. Standing up, she tells him that she would save him if she could. A tear falls from her face and lands on Caleb's cheek. The wind howls and blows through the crypt. Caleb opens his eyes and smiles at Tess, who smiles back."
