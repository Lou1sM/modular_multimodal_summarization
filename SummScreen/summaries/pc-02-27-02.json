Casey left but not before needling Jamal about being \"kicked to the curb\" by Alison. Ricky and Jamal decided they should just stay out of each other's way. As they were talking, two men approached looking for a game of dice. While the men were setting up the game, Ricky switched the dice for a pair of his own.\n\n\nAlison wondered if Rafe had something on his mind. He told her he did, but he couldn't talk about it. Alison begged him to talk; she couldn't take any more secrets. Rafe was adamant. There were some things he just couldn't discuss with her. Alison said Rafe's disappearance had made her realize what it would be like when he was gone. Rafe assured her they had a love that would never die.\n\n\nAlison wouldn't let the subject drop. She wanted to know if she'd caused Rafe to be called back when she'd started talking about the possibility of having a baby. He told her that a baby was not in the cards for them. Alison accepted that then told Rafe that when his time on earth was up, she didn't want him to disappear, but she wanted to have time for a proper goodbye.\n\n\nAs Alison went to the kitchen to finish up her baking, Casey walked through the door. She whined that her second life was turning out to be worse than the last one. Then she went on about the problems she was having with Ricky. Alison overheard and figured out that Casey had to be the other angel in town. Casey freaked out when she realized she had let out the secret, and she took off. Alison also overheard Casey refer to the Fifth Chair. She demanded to know who was going to die.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Eve confronted Ian and Amy. She was angry that he had run off with Amy, once again leaving her to find a babysitter for Danny. Her anger boiled over as she snapped at Ian, \"How long have you been sleeping with this bitch?\" Ian tried to calm Eve down by saying that it wasn't what it looked like. Eve wasn't listening. She told Amy that she wasn't the first woman for Ian and mentioned Lucy and Arianna. Next, Eve told Amy that she knew Chris Ramsey was digging up her secret. Eve vowed to help Chris, and when she found out what Amy was hiding, Eve planned to shout it from the rooftop. \n\n\nIan stood up for Amy and asked Eve to stop. It made Eve even angrier to know that Ian was cheating and taking Amy's side. Ian's beeper went off, leaving Eve and Amy alone. Eve turned on Amy, telling her that the only reason Ian was interested in her was because she was a poor little blind girl who was helpless and needy. Eve left to go to the roof for some fresh air. Amy followed, wanting to finish their conversation. The conversation turned heated, and as Eve and Amy struggled, the railing broke.\n\n\n",
