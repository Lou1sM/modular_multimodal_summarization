Then Alison speculated about why there would be a Fifth Chair and decided it had to mean there were four angels instead of just Rafe and Casey.\n\n\nAlison wondered if she would be going back with Rafe. Rafe insisted that Alison was going to have a long and happy life. But Alison immediately wondered how happy her life could be if it would be a life without Rafe there to share it with her. Rafe begged her, \"Don't go there.\"\n\n\nAt the lighthouse, Paige told Kevin that she was packed and ready to go as Kevin held Christina, who was still not feeling well. When Kevin went to answer the phone in the kitchen, he put Christina in Paige's lap, and Paige told Christina, \"I love you as if you were my own little girl.\"\n\n\nLucy overheard Paige and jumped all over Paige, telling her she did not want Paige talking to her daughter that way, since Christina had just lost her own mother, and Paige was going away as well.\n\n\nOn the hospital roof, as Amy and Eve struggled with each other, the railing gave way, and both of them fell over. However, Ian arrived in time to grab Eve, but Eve told Ian that Amy had fallen.\n\n\nAt Casey's room at the Scanlons', Casey complained about the state of her life since Ricky had brushed her off, and she looked at the key around her neck.\n\n\nIn the Emergency Room, Eve and Ian were both astonished to learn that Amy was okay -- there were some cuts and bruises, but nothing more serious. The attending doctor remarked that it was as if \"someone upstairs had their eye on her.\" However, when Ian asked Amy what had happened, Amy said that she had grabbed Eve and then Eve had grabbed her, and the next thing she'd known, she had been flying. When Ian asked Eve if that was what had happened, Eve leaped to the conclusion that Ian was implying that Eve had actually attempted to kill Amy by throwing her off the roof.\n\n\nAt the Scanlons', Casey decided she would find her tightest outfit and go find a \"fine man,\" but her britches ripped, and she ended up staying home instead.\n\n\nAt the lighthouse, Lucy grabbed Christina away from Paige while Kevin demanded to know what was going on. Paige defended herself by saying she had merely told Christina she loved her, and that was all. Lucy angrily grabbed Christina and carried her off to bed.\n\n\nWhen Lucy left, Kevin suggested to Paige that it would be easier if he could tell Lucy about the witness protection program. Paige said the more Lucy knew, the more likely it would be that Lucy would end up in danger herself. Kevin once again promised Paige that they would get a chance to finish Paige's portrait. Lucy returned and suggested that they all go to bed. Paige agreed and told Lucy she'd never meant any harm. Lucy replied that she hoped her visitor found whatever it was she was looking for.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Ian and Eve continued to argue, and Eve said, \"If you think I could throw Amy off the roof, you don't know me,\" and stormed out. As Amy urged Ian to go after Eve, Ian told Amy that he was just glad she was alive. Amy laughed at that remark and suggested to Ian that maybe they should go ahead and have an affair, since they appeared to be taking the heat for it already.\n\n\nAs everyone settled into bed, Ed visited each of his angels and tuned in on their dreams. Casey was dreaming about a perfect wedding to Ricky. Rafe dreamed he was back with Alison for good, and they were planning a regular life, with babies, growing old together, and rocking chairs.\n\n\nEd reminded Paige that, \"A dream is a wish your heart makes,\" and saw that Paige was dreaming that, before she went, Kevin told her he loved her, and Lucy handed Christina over to Kevin and Paige and told them she was going to be getting out of their lives. Christina said, \"God bless us all, every one.\" Amy was dreaming of being able to see and having a chance to actually \"see\" Ian. They kissed passionately.\n\n\nEd said, \"Nothing has changed. Your dreams seem so romantic and sweet. But you can't fool me. I know that one of you is hiding a dark seed down deep in your soul. One of you is a Dark Angel, with a Dark Purpose. You've fooled everyone. If the people around you could only know what your real plan is! There is nothing I can do. As much as I'd like this to play out a different way, all I can do is watch and feel how much evil is lurking there in your hearts. Dark Angel. Dark Angel. Dark Angel. Dark Angel.\" As Ed's naming of a Dark Angel echoed, each of the angels was suddenly startled awake.\n\n\n",
