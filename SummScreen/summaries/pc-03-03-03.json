    "tvmega_recap": "When Ian refuses to turn off the music, Rafe attacks him. Alison arrives just in time, and Ian tells her to turn off the music. Rafe is confused about what just happened. When he hears those five notes, he's filled with anger and hatred for vampires. In contrast, Ian sees a vision of a cold, white place and feels himself being called to go there. Ian also hears voices and the sound of muskets. Alison insists on listening to the music herself. The music clearly has a rapturous effect on Alison, who tries to seduce Rafe in front of Ian. Ian stops the music, and Alison explains how it made her feel. She felt very connected to Rafe and to their life together. She also felt alive and loved. Ian rushes out to fill Lucy in on what they've learned. Alison still wants to be with Rafe, but he turns her down. He doesn't want to be with her now, because the feelings inside her were caused by Caleb's music. Kevin persuades Tess to go to his house, where they can talk. He takes her back to the lighthouse, and after gaining her trust, he pulls out the music box and opens it. As the music plays, Livvie emerges. Meanwhile, Caleb and Lucy get hot and heavy, but when he puts his lips to her neck, she can't keep up her act anymore. She tries to cover, but it doesn't do any good. Caleb has no intention of sleeping with someone who has tried repeatedly to kill him. Lucy warns that if he kills her, he'll blow his chances of getting Livvie back, because Tess won't want anything to do with him. He informs her that he doesn't want Livvie anymore. Seeing an opportunity, Lucy grabs her silver arrow and points it at him. Sensing that Tess is in trouble, Caleb vanishes. Although thrilled her see her dad, Livvie can't stop talking about Caleb. When he suddenly appears in the living room, she runs to him. Caleb stuns Kevin by closing the music box and bringing Tess back. Kevin can't believe this. He assumes that Caleb saved the wrong person, but the vampire knew exactly what he was doing. Smashing the music box, he informs Kevin that it's over. Kevin accuses him of abandoning the love of his life, adding that he'll just corrupt Tess the way he does everything else. Caleb warns him not to push it, but Kevin intends to get his daughter back. Caleb takes Tess home with him. Lucy fills Ian in on Caleb's attempt on her life--and how she attempted to stop him. Ian wants to know how far she would have gone."
