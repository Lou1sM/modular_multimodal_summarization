    "tvmega_recap": "After observing \"Marissa\" and Jamal, Ricky decides to confront them about their so-called relationship. He's clearly suspicious that \"Marissa\" isn't who she claims to be. Jamal tries to cover for Casey by kissing her, but this only fuels Ricky's suspicions. Casey takes Ricky aside to tell him the truth, but before she can confess, he kisses her. The kiss confirms what he thought. He knows exactly who she is. They share a few more joyful kisses before thunder roars and she vanishes. Jamal explains that Ricky blew her cover, which can't be a good thing. Reese pouts about being blown off by Ricky, but she perks up when Jack informs her that he's tired of sweetness and ready for someone who's bad to the bone. Reese asks whether he really wants to be a vampire again, and for right now, he can't think of a reason not to. Caleb takes Tess to his place, where he assures her that she'll be safe. They talk about what happened with Jack, including his accusation that she has feelings for Caleb. He asks whether Jack could be right about that. Tess insists that she although she does love Caleb in her own way, it isn't the way he wants her to love him. Caleb admits that he had the chance to kill Lucy but instead chose to rescue Tess from Kevin. He hopes that she'll stay with him, but it's her choice. Tess chooses to go to Jack. When she gets to the house, she's stunned to see Jack allowing Reese to kiss his neck. Ian and Lucy fight about her tactics in handling Caleb. Ian admits that he's jealous. When Lucy orders him to get out of her house, she knocks over some boxes. Ian notices that a book opened when it hit the floor. He takes it as a sign from God, because it opened to a page illustrating his vision of \"The Healing Pool,\" where the dead return to life. On his guitar, Caleb plays the five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" over and over."
