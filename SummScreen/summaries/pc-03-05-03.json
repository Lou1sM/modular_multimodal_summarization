    "tvmega_recap": "Joshua pays Elizabeth a visit. He wants her to keep tabs on what Alison and Rafe are up to and report back to him. Elizabeth doesn't like the idea of spying on her daughter, but Joshua convinces her that it's all part of getting sweet revenge on Caleb. He also tries to talk her into a mutual feeding, but Elizabeth doesn't want to do that with him. He ignores her and sinks his fangs into her neck anyway. Jack runs after Tess. He's sorry that she saw him with Reese, but he's not sorry that he did it. They argue about her relationship with Caleb, and Jack informs Tess that he wants to live his life without her. After she leaves, Reese informs Jack that he's too complicated, and she doesn't need that right now. Tess returns to her cave, where she concludes that she doesn't belong anywhere. Lucy apologizes for the way she treated Ian earlier. Ian thinks the Healing Pool is another piece of the puzzle. They go to Victor for help, and it's a very awkward situation. Lucy apologizes, but Victor explains that when he sees her with Ian, he thinks about Kevin, and it's hard. He's lost his son, and he doesn't know why. As they talk, Ian finds something about the Battle of Putnam's Field in one of Victor's books. Victor now remembers where he's heard of the Healing Pool. According to legend, soldiers who bathed their wounds in the spring were healed. The book doesn't give any additional information, but Victor pulls out some old maps. Although they don't find any pools or springs on the maps, there is a reference in Dutch to a \"place of healthy waters.\" The problem is that they can't tell where it's located, because a piece of the map is missing. Meanwhile, Rafe takes some staff paper and writes out the first five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" repeatedly. Alison is angry with him for rejecting her advances. She doesn't think it matters that the music made her want him. Just as Rafe charms his way back into her good graces, Kevin stops by the warehouse to volunteer his services in bringing Caleb down. He wants to get Livvie back as a whole person, and he finally acknowledges that Tess is part of her. Rafe doesn't trust him. Kevin becomes excited when he sees the staff paper, because he sees a message in the notes. He connects the notes into a diagram, but he doesn't know what it means. \"The notes just jumped into my head, and I saw this,\" he states."
