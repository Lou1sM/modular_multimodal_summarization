    "tvmega_recap": "Elizabeth flirts with Frank at the Recovery Room. Frank places a cryptic phone call in which he assures someone that he's good for the money. Joshua advises Elizabeth to start spying on Alison and Rafe now. Frank intervenes when he sees Joshua grab her arm. Joshua is impressed with Frank, but the feeling is far from mutual. Assessing what he's observed, Joshua believes that Frank could be quite an asset to him. Caleb comforts a very sad Tess in the cave where she used to live. She wishes that Jack had never taken her away and taught her about love. She blames Caleb for creating her in the first place. Caleb explains that all the time he was pining for Olivia, he never took the time to look at Tess. When he finally opened his heart, he realized that she was the one he longed for. He is her destiny, not Jack. Tess looks into his eyes and realizes that he really does love her. Rafe and Alison are still trying to decipher Kevin's drawing when Ian and Lucy burst with maps of Port Charles and news about the healing pool. Ian and Lucy lay the drawing over one of the maps and discover that it points to Caleb's building by the docks. However, when they learn that Kevin supplied the drawing, they become suspicious that it's a trap. Despite his apparently good intentions, Kevin is asked to leave the premises. Elizabeth stops by the warehouse just before Ian and Lucy leave. When Alison and Rafe can't get their stories straight, Elizabeth informs them that she knows they're up to something that has to do with her husband. Caleb and Tess walk to his place, where he promises to protect her from her nightmares. As Ian and Lucy snoop around the docks, they find the same pattern on a padlocked door. To their chagrin, Kevin joins them. When they hear Caleb approaching, they open the lock and hide inside. Caleb notices the open padlock and closes it before continuing his walk with Tess. Inside, Ian stifles Lucy's urge to scream. She's normally claustrophic anyway, but it doesn't help that Kevin is in there with them."
