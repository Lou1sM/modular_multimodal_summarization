    "tvmega_recap": "Elizabeth is convinced that Alison and Rafe are up to something, and she wants to be included. She insists that Caleb no longer has any power over her, but they don't believe that's possible. Rafe asks her to listen to the first five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" and tell them what happens. As she listens, a change comes over her face, but she removes the headphones and claims to have felt nothing. She rushes out on the pretense of having a previous engagement, unaware that Alison and Rafe are following her. Alison realizes that her mother still loves the vampire who sired her. Caleb sleeps on the couch while Tess lies awake in his bed. After a nightmare about the night he became a vampire, he wakes up with a jolt and sees Tess looking at him with concern. Tess believes that Caleb longs to be the man he used to be, before he was turned into a vampire against his will. Now believing that they were meant to be together, she asks him to make love to her. Elizabeth lets herself into Caleb's loft and is stunned to see her husband making love to Tess. Meanwhile, Lucy blames Kevin for making her claustophobia worse. Kevin demands to know where they are and what they're looking for, but his questions go unanswered. When Lucy panics and says that she can't breathe, Kevin's suggestion to whistle calms her down. As they crawl through the cave, they see a light. It becomes much brighter as they approach it, and they hear the sound of running water. Ian breaks through into a cavern. The hot spring lies in the middle. To Ian, it feels as if there are answers there, but Lucy has a very different feeling, as if something is a little bit off. The cavern fills with the sound of moaning, and something odd is happening in the water. Lucy can't explain what's happening, but she doesn't think they're alone."
