Lucy tells them the legend of the healing pool and Ian takes a sample of the water to analyze it.  He discovers Caleb's \"\"water\"\" is a combo of the healing pool water mixed with Chris's vampire serum. They wonder if the healing pool water without the serum could cure a vampire. While making love, Caleb tells Tess he feels human again. Caleb then bares his fangs but doesn't bite her. Later, Caleb goes to the hot spring, staring into the water.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Elizabeth goes to deliver her news to Caleb, but she is stunned to discover her husband in bed with Tess. When she returns to her room, she and is annoyed to find Joshua waiting at her. He reminds her that they had a deal, and she resolves to help him destroy the \"bloodsucking bat.\" She fills him in on what happened when she listened to the first five notes of \"Naked Eyes.\" Joshua believes that Rafe wanted confirmation of what he already knew. Elizabeth admits that she's prepared to keep spying on her daughter if it will lead to pain and suffering for Caleb. Rafe and Alison join the others at the healing pool. Kevin finally manages to convince them that his own connection to the spring makes him valuable to them. Ian believes that the screams are coming from the ghosts of the wounded. Rafe stops Alison from touching the water, pointing out that they don't really know what it is. He believes they should get out of there before Elizabeth leads Caleb right to them. At Lucy's suggestion, Ian dips a bottle into the spring so that he can study the water, and they all head to his loft. Tess is happy that she just made love to a man, not a vampire. It's been a very long time since Caleb has thought of himself as a normal man. Later, Caleb tells Tess that he wants all of her. He prepares to bite her neck, but the feeling subsides, and he kisses her lips. Back at his loft, Ian mixes the water sample with the formula that Chris came up with during his experiment. The result is the special water contained in the blue bottles. They speculate about what would happen if a vampire were to drink the spring water straight, without the special ingredient. They wonder whether it could completely cure a vampire. After waking up with a jolt, Caleb quietly gets out of bed and goes to the healing pool."
