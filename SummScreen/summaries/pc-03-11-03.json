    "tvmega_recap": "Ian gets an idea when Lucy uses romance, a bath, and soothing music to take his mind off his troubles. He thinks that if he listens to \"Naked Eyes\" while soaking in the hot spring, he will be healed. A hangover causes Jack to hallucinate that Livvie is taunting him about his latest failed attempt at \"happily ever after.\" Caleb hands out some new music and informs Joshua that many changes are in store. From now on, the band will be known as The Experience, Featuring Caleb Morley. Joshua objects, but Caleb puts him in his place. Ricky is thrilled by Casey's return and her inadvertent confession that she's his guardian angel. When Casey explains that the band is made up of vampires, Ricky shocks her by saying that he's known that for a long time. He doesn't care, because being a rock star has always been his dream. Casey is prepared to leave so that she doesn't have to watch the man she loves destroy himself. Ricky points out that if he plays it safe, she'll have to go back, but as long as he keeps walking into trouble, she'll be there to watch his back. Casey realizes he's right, but she's not comfortable with it. A drunken Jack shows up at the studio to see Reese. After reading a note, Caleb goes home to Tess, who has prepared a romantic evening for the two of them. Jack tells Reese to bite him now, and she lowers her mouth onto his neck. Lucy and Ian try to return to the healing pool, but the entrance is gone."
