    "tvmega_recap": "Inspired by a magazine article about how to make a man happy, Tess has arranged a special meal for Caleb. He's touched by this but assures her that she doesn't have to do anything special for him. Angry with Caleb for changing the band's name and the type of music they'll be doing, Joshua throws a tantrum in Elizabeth's hotel room. Elizabeth turns on some mood music, and just as Joshua is about to sink his fangs into her neck, Alison lets herself into the room. Alison's shock causes her to drop the casserole she brought for her mother's dinner. Alison vows to send Rafe after Joshua if he ever touches her mother again, but Elizabeth tells her that she'll do nothing of the kind. They have a huge argument in which Alison accuses her mother of being a professional victim with no morals, decency, or scruples. After she storms out, Elizabeth wants to go after her, but Joshua talks her out of it. He reminds her of the need to stay focused on bringing down Caleb. Instead of honoring Jack's request to become a vampire, Reese tells him that she doesn't do mercy bites. She doesn't believe that Jack is truly ready to be a vampire. He tells her that he used to be nothing but trouble before hitting town. Reese tells him about her life back in England, with a drunk for a mother and a father she never knew. Caleb found her playing at a club in Bristol one night. As they talk, Alison storms up to them. She grabs Reese by the shoulder, turns her around, and punches her in the stomach. Jack holds Reese back, and he and Alison get into an argument about his behavior. Alison is furious with him for hanging around with a filthy vampire. When she leaves, Reese vows to get even for the sucker punch. Caleb cuts his finger, and when Tess tries to heal it, she finds that she can't. Upset at first, she realizes that her gift served its purpose when she brought Caleb back to life and showed him the goodness inside him. Now she doesn't need it anymore. She believes that they have discovered their purpose together because they're soul mates. Caleb mouths the words, \"I love you,\" and they kiss."
