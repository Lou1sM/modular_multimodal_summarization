As an invisible Amy showers, Ian goes to confront her and is stunned when she re-emerges in front of his eyes.  In London, Lucy, Kevin and Paige hang Paige's portrait in her family home.  Reading Paige's family scroll, Lucy realizes a relative's portrait is missing, then shows Kevin a name which connects Paige to Port Charles.  Alison takes Rafe to \"\"meet\"\" her great-great-great-grandmother Rebecca (or rather her portrait).  Rafe's stunned to see Rebecca looks exactly like Paige!"
