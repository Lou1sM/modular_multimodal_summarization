    "tvmega_recap": "Kevin uses blackmail to try to force Lucy to go back to him. He's prepared to make her lose custody of Christina over her belief in vampires.

After going off alone to drink the blood that Lucy brought him, Ian returns to the healing pool. The first five notes of \"Naked Eyes\" begin to play as he submerges himself in the water. Rafe runs from the Recovery Room when he senses that something is wrong. Alison tries to follow, but a fanged Reese stops her. Caleb tells Tess that he was wrong to separate her from Livvie.

Caleb believes that nothing can stop them now."
