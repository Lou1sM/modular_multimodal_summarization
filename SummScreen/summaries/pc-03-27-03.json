They make love but then Kevin calls and pressures Lucy into leaving, so she lies that Christina's sick and they say their goodbyes. Rafe tells Alison he feels a negative shift in the balance of good and evil. They speculate that something's happened to Tess and Livvie's back and teaming up with Caleb. When Livvie says she's ready to be a turned, Caleb bites her and she dies but is reborn as a vampire. After Caleb and Livvie make love, Livvie sprouts fangs of her own."
