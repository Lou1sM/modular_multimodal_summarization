    "tvmega_recap": "After coming home from the hospital, Lucy continues to vent her anger about Ian's deadly plan. Casey's concern for Lucy arouses Alison's suspicions that the angel has inside information. Karen confronts Frank about his gambling problem after hearing him promise to come up with the money. Frank explains that he's trying to help his mother keep the restaurant afloat, and he turns down Karen's offer to help. After making love to Lucy, Ian promises to fight for his life. Alison is somewhat embarrassed but unapologetic when confronted by her mother, who spent a very long time locked in the bathroom before removing the doorknob to escape. Alison fills Elizabeth in on Caleb's newfound humanity and Joshua's treachery. Elizabeth believes that Caleb needs her now that he's human again, but she doesn't believe that Joshua poses any threat to her. Rafe stops Joshua from making another murder attempt on Caleb. When three young hospital volunteers come to Caleb's room for an autograph, Joshua takes one of the girls hostage, releasing her only to give himself the chance to flee. Caleb has the other girls release him from his restraints. After making a show of being unable to defend himself should Joshua return, Caleb slips out of the restraints and sneaks out of his room. Unaware that Caleb is lurking nearby, Alison informs Rafe that her mother is still obsessed with Caleb. Kevin is overjoyed by Livvie's return, but he's stunned to learn that she willingly became a vampire. He promises to help his daughter, who is devastated by her loss and terrified for her safety. Joshua goes to the lighthouse and orders Kevin to let him see Livvie."
