Joshua is pleased that he has ensnared Caleb in the silk curtains and begins to torment him by telling him that he and Livvie will live happily ever after together.  Caleb tells Joshua he is fooling himself if he thinks Livvie will turn to him.  Ian attempts to figure out Joshua's password to gain access to his computer.  After many failed attempts, Ian types in the correct password--\"\"Ring\"\".  Joshua locks Caleb in a jail cell where he continues to torment him. Rafe takes Ali to Lucy for safekeeping.  Rafe discovers Livvie on his doorstep and she asks him to kill her.",
    "tvmega_recap": "After finding the disturbing photos in Joshua's hideout, Ian and Rafe arrange for a very frightened Alison to stay with Lucy. Alison shows Rafe the black rose, which was pink until she touched it, and Rafe assumes that it's a warning from Joshua. Lucy suspects that there's more to her weakened condition than merely stress. Livvie feels that something is happening, but she doesn't suspect that Joshua has trapped her lover at the villa. Joshua taunts Caleb with ideas of getting close to Olivia, but Caleb knows it's all talk. After trying several passwords, Ian finally breaks into Joshua's computer with the word \"ring.\" Joshua moves Caleb to a cell, where he continues his tall tales of getting close to Olivia. He admits that she would look for him if she hadn't been assured of his death. Caleb expresses the opinion that if the slayers don't kill Joshua, Olivia will. After knocking out her father with a bookend, Livvie waits outside Rafe's apartment, where she presents the slayer with a hand-carved stake and asks him to kill her."
