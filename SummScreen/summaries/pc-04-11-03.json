Casey and Jamal tell Ricky about the explosion and that the vampires have lost their \"\"mojo.\"\" As a result, Ricky wants to use the information to further his music career.  Joshua demands Kevin tell him where Livvie is.  As Rafe raises a stake to drive it through Livvie's heart, his instincts tell him to stop.  Rafe tells Livvie that Joshua was the one who set the explosives that \"\"killed\"\" Caleb and that he wants to take over Caleb's position as top vampire.  Livvie and Rafe decide to work together to bring down Joshua.  Joshua turns Frank.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ricky returns from New York with the big news that he landed a VH1 documentary for the band. Hearing about the latest events surrounding the band members, he immediately thinks in terms of the publicity that will ensure a platinum CD. He lets Jamal and Casey think that Jamal's attempt at reverse psychology worked, but he really intends to pursue fame now, no matter what it takes. Kevin has a disappointing encounter with Victor, who refuses to tell him where Christina is. Victor is angry with Frank for showing up late for work when he knew that his boss/stepfather had a meeting at the bank. Joshua's attempt to push Kevin around is halted by Frank, who's looking for a fight. Frank takes Joshua outside. Joshua has a proposal for Frank, who turns his potential benefactor down flat for not immediately stating the amount. Joshua prepares to bite Frank. Kevin continues working on the painting that Joshua found so fascinating. Livvie begs Rafe to kill her, but he stops himself from going through with it, not wanting her death to be based on a lie. He informs her that he didn't kill Caleb, and that Joshua was the one who blew up the hot spring. Livvie wants to help Rafe get Joshua, on the condition that she gets to tear the new vampire's throat out after Rafe gets the answers he needs."
