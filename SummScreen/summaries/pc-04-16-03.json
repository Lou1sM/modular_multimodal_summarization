    "tvmega_recap": "Stunned to learn that Caleb is alive, Livvie vows to take revenge on both Joshua and Rafe for lying to her about his fate. Ashamed of his new life as a mortal, Caleb asks Livvie to turn him back into a vampire. Before Livvie can feed on him through the bars, Joshua's thug pulls her away. Lucy fills Ian in on what happened to Alison. She doesn't understand why she was unable to protect her friend against new vampire Frank. Ian insists on taking Lucy in for some tests. Still worried about her vision of a dead Lucy, Casey goes to the hospital to look for her. Jamal and Casey learn that Lucy hasn't been admitted, but their relief is short-lived when they see Ian help Lucy off the hospital elevator. As Frank awaits Joshua's order to bite Alison, Joshua warns Rafe to put the stake down. Lucy worries about Ian's ability to cope with taking a blood sample. Lucy's test results show nothing more than a slight anemia. Rafe's attempt to protect Alison backfires when Joshua jabs him in the neck with a needle. Joshua assures Alison that he won't hurt her. At Jamal's suggestion, Casey prays for answers, but they realize that she has to figure this out on her own. When Joshua tries to persuade Alison to sit down to tea with him, she accuses him of turning on his sleazy charm again. Joshua informs her that Rafe's fate depends on her cooperation, and he's confident that the two of them will have become much closer by the end of the night. Rafe opens his eyes to discover that he and an angry Livvie share the cell next to Caleb's."
