Caleb cuts his arm so Livvie can feed.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Lucy takes offense at Elizabeth's sincere compliment that they are very much alike. While trying to gain Frank's trust over a beer, Ian sets a trap to force the new vampire to reveal his true nature. Smelling the blood in Ian's bag, Frank follows him to the alley, where he \"catches\" Ian preparing to drink the blood. Surprised to learn that Ian is also a vampire, Frank strongly advises the doctor to accept it. Joshua calls with a new assignment for Frank. Ian provokes Frank into an attack and gains the upper hand. Livvie's blood hunger leaves her in agony. Alison is forced to share Caleb's cell. Joshua amuses himself with the current living arrangements in the dungeon. Livvie vows not to give Joshua the ring. Joshua informs her that sex with a slayer will relieve the pain. Elizabeth finds a set of vampire wedding rings belonging to Joshua. Lucy hides when Joshua shows up, but Elizabeth pretends to believe the ring is for her, and to Joshua's disbelief, she accepts the proposal he had no intention of making. Although Livvie and Rafe vow to never sleep together, the pain is too much for the hungry vamp. His lip quivering, Caleb forces himself to allow her to do whatever it takes. When Rafe continues to refuse, Caleb manages to get his arm within range of Livvie's mouth, and she feeds on him."
