Lucy forces Ian to admit that making love with her no longer helps curb his appetite for blood. Ian then informs her that some type of toxin is depleting her red blood cells. He promises to figure it out. A personal message to Rafe on Joshua's computer screen prompts the slayer to flee the secret room just as it blows up. Joshua has Livvie taken to the patio, where he again tries to persuade her to give him the ring. Livvie falls into her father's arms for protection, but Kevin is even less himself than ever. A trail of blood leads out the door where Rafe apparently dragged himself out of Joshua's hideout. Just as Caleb finally persuades Alison to let him go, Elizabeth shows up at the apartment. Elizabeth sees Caleb's predicament and tells him off for mistreating her at the hospital. In turn, Caleb tells Elizabeth what he thinks of her incessant whining about herself after everything Alison has been through. He and Alison are stunned to hear about the discovery of wedding bands in Joshua's hideout. Alison pushes her mother out the door and sets Caleb free. Under Joshua's influence, Kevin tricks Livvie and breaks the chain that hangs around her neck. Kevin gives Joshua the ring and then returns to his painting. The ring on his finger, Joshua offers Livvie a glass of red liquid so that she doesn't have to starve."
