Fearing that Joshua intends to make Alison his bride, Rafe comes up with a plan to keep her safe. Although Alison resists, Rafe insists that they are getting out of town. Frank watches them leave the apartment and then reports back to Joshua. Olivia tells Caleb that Joshua added something to the blood she drank. It poisoned her fangs, and anyone she bites will die.

Olivia is devastated when the man dies, because it means that she is poison to Caleb."
