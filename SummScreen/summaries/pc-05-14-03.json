Joshua awaits the arrival of a special guest whom he intends to recruit. Rafe returns to the catacombs and finds that Caleb and Alison are gone. He immediately assumes that Caleb screwed him over and took Alison. While Livvie feeds on blood acquired by her father, Kevin injects himself with the drug that Joshua provided. After assuring his daughter that he loves her more than anything, Kevin informs her that it is his duty to punish her. Livvie takes advantage of her new strength and pushes Kevin away. In a moment of clarity, Kevin urges his daughter to run. After a fit of rage, Kevin prepares to give himself another injection. Caleb stops Alison from going to the villa alone. After fleeing the lighthouse, Livvie runs into Rafe and fills him in on what just happened. Believing that Caleb stabbed him in the back, Rafe lies to Livvie about the antidote, claiming that he doesn't have it. Alison bursts into the villa, with Caleb right behind her. They hide when they hear a noise, but Joshua senses that someone is there, and he orders Frank to take care of the intruder after greeting the surprise guest. As Joshua sings a tune about victims who won't be missed, Frank greets Amanda Barrington as she steps out of the limo."
