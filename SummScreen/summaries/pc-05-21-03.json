    "tvmega_recap": "Angry about the way Caleb treated him in his own club, Joshua vows to teach everyone in town a lesson. Ian and Lucy hope they can keep up the pretense of mourning someone who isn't really dead. Elizabeth blames Lucy for not protecting her daughter. Alison can't handle seeing her loved ones grieve over her. She's determined to let them know the truth, but Caleb stops her. Alison spills the beans to Olivia about the kiss Caleb planted on her. This leads to Olivia taking a tumble out into the open, where the grief-stricken Elizabeth and Jamal are ready to attack. Claiming the sole right to avenge Alison, Rafe intervenes and surreptitiously gives her the chance to get away before chasing after her. Jamal goes off alone to grieve his \"Spunky.\" Caleb carries Alison back to the catacombs, where she accuses him and all other males of being macho idiots. After the memorial service, Frank reports to Joshua that everyone was truly in mourning. Joshua informs Frank that all the key people have been turned. Since they need a few more bodies, Joshua declares tonight to be open season on humans. Karen learns that several DOA's have come into the morgue drained of blood.

Since Elizabeth is so determined to kill Olivia, Ian and Lucy decide to tell her the truth.

Olivia informs Rafe that Alison kissed Caleb. Jack and the others make plans to hang out at Jamal's place, but Jamal is nowhere to be found. When John Doe #5 fights his way out of the body bag, he is revealed to be a confused Jamal, who has bite marks on his neck."
