Casey finds Jamal wandering through the park with his head covered by the hood of his sweat jacket. Reese and Jack are suspicious of Jamal's strange behavior. Deciding to stay and help Jamal, Casey sends everyone else away. When Jamal reluctantly reveals the marks on his neck, Casey blames herself for being too wrapped up in guarding Ricky to look out for him. At the club, Reese admits that Jamal was acting like a vampire but doesn't think it makes sense for him to have been turned.
