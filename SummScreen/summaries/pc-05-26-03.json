Having decided to do things her way instead of playing by the rules any longer, Casey goes to Ricky for sympathy. After Casey takes him up on his offer to spend the day together, Ricky informs Joshua that the plan is in motion. When Joshua has a talk with Jack about loyalty, Jack informs him that he isn't a yes man. Reese is excited about how well her VH1 interview went, but Jack thinks that they're more interested in Stephen Clay. Reese accuses Jack of ruining a good thing for her and the other band members. Jamal demands to speak to Frank, who considers himself much too busy to deal with his new recruit. Ian is disturbed by a nightmare in which he sinks his fangs into Lucy's neck. Jack asks Jamal to talk to him as if they're still friends. Sick of the tension in the catacombs, Alison announces her intention to leave and let Joshua see that she's alive. When Rafe tries to stop her, she informs him that his insistence on making Caleb out to be the enemy makes him an even bigger problem to her than Caleb and Olivia are. Caleb and Rafe get into a brawl while the women let them get it out of their systems. After the fight, Caleb and Rafe reach an uneasy truce so that they can bring down Joshua."
