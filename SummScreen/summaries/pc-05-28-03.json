    "tvmega_recap": "Lucy's attempt to seduce a reluctant Ian is interrupted by the arrival of her cousin. Asking for the antidote back, Rafe stuns Ian and Lucy by announcing his intention to allow Caleb to become a vampire if it will mean vanquishing Joshua. Maintaining that no vampire can be trusted, Ian refuses to cooperate until Lucy steps in and voices her own opinion. After Rafe leaves, Lucy again tries to seduce the man she loves, unaware that his vampire nature is rising to the surface. Caleb takes care of Alison, who is grateful to him for saving her life. Realizing that Olivia must have been her attacker, she confronts Caleb with her suspicion. He persuades her not to tell Rafe despite their pact not to have any secrets. In an attempt to ward off yet another unwarranted attack by her former best friend, Alison tries to leave, but Caleb persuades her to stay. Olivia offers to lead Joshua to Alison--who is very much alive-- in return for the antidote. Joshua learns that it's missing and accuses her of playing games. Olivia informs him that Rafe must have stolen it. Joshua goes after her with a stake until she begs for mercy. He lets her go, because he can find Alison without her help. Fleeing the villa, Olivia worries about how to tell Caleb what she's done. Joshua arranges for Alison to be delivered to him. Caleb blames himself for Olivia's behavior, since he shouldn't have admitted to liking Alison as a person. When he returns from investigating a noise, Alison is gone. Rafe returns to the catacombs and admits to having the antidote. Learning that Alison is gone, he looks at Olivia accusingly. Frank delivers Alison to Joshua, who presents her with a pre-wedding gift in the form of Jamal."
