    "tvmega_recap": "Lucy's attempt to seduce Ian brings out his fangs. He stops himself before it's too late, but Lucy is upset about her inability to help him. Ian always knew this day could come, which is why he has to move out. They say some tearful goodbyes before Ian finally walks out the door. Jamal blames Rafe for leaving the whole town to become bat food while bothering to save Alison and no one else. His assertion that he's happy to be a vampire shocks Alison, who reels when he bares his fangs and attacks her. Her screams bring Joshua and Frank back to the room, and they hold Jamal at bay. Joshua tells Alison that he's been turning her friends and relatives into vampires so that she will be surrounded by her loved ones once they're married. He summons two female vamps, who drag her to another location. At the catacombs, Rafe refuses to hand over the antidote until he finds out what happened to Alison. Although admitting that Joshua found out the truth because of her, Olivia refuses to actually take the blame, stating that this is Rafe's fault for holding back the antidote. Caleb offers to help get Alison back once he becomes a vampire again, but Rafe informs him that he's doing this alone. Olivia manages to take the vial out of Rafe's back pocket, but he knocks it out of her hand and stomps on it before leaving to rescue Alison. Caleb is furious with Olivia, who doesn't seem to have a clue as to the damage she's done. Rafe storms into the villa but finds that the furniture is covered and the property is no longer occupied. Joshua informs a horrified Alison that he has big plans for her."
