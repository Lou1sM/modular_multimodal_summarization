    "tvdb": "Jamal and Jack head back to the darkroom to develop the last set of photos from the candle shop. Alison warns Kate she'll fire her on the spot if she ever again tries to drag Ian and Lucy's names through the mud. On a sudden whim, Rafe decides to surprise Livvie with a bouquet of pink roses. Jamal complains bitterly to Jack about the way Rafe is still monopolizing Alison's every waking thought. Alison finds herself confiding in Kate about her special angel. Livvie returns home to find the place filled to the brim with dozens and dozens of pink roses. Kate catches Jack and Jamal with the new Polaroids and cautions them to keep their wild stories to themselves when they're on the witness stand. Later, Kate does an apparent about-face and asks the young men to take her to the Pink Rose to see further evidence of the supernatural. Meanwhile, Alison is stunned to discover that Livvie sanded away the heart-enclosed initials Rafe carved on the barn post."
