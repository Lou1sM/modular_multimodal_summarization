Caleb gives Chris a fragment of the shattered vial in the hope that he can identify and duplicate the antidote. When Chris returns from the lab, he regretfully reports that the substance was sugar water. Casey and Ricky take Rafe to Ian's loft for medical assistance. Ian doesn't want to help, but Casey insists. Becoming queasy at the sight of the deep knife wound, Casey flees to the hall, where Ricky informs his stunned guardian angel that he's getting back to his music now that he's done his good deed for the day. Ian wants Rafe to go to the hospital for stitches, but Rafe insists on being treated on the spot. He explains how Alison fell into Joshua's hands, and he attributes the loss of the antidote to an accident. Ian informs him that he switched the antidote with sugar water in a plan to get rid of Caleb. Therefore, the antidote isn't really gone. Rafe is angry with Ian, who considers the slayer to be too naive to survive in Port Charles. Believing that Jamal will help her escape Joshua's clutches, Alison lets down her guard. Jamal reminds her of the time when they all pretended that Jack was her new boyfriend in an attempt to fool her grandmother. Realizing what he's saying, Alison begins to yell at him just before Joshua walks into the room. Alison informs Joshua of her intention to become his worst possible nightmare. Joshua goes to Jamal for advice about how to deal with her. Jamal tells him to try backing off, since she doesn't like pressure, and opening up to her. Joshua gives it a try, and after leaving her alone, he laughs heartily about his performance."
