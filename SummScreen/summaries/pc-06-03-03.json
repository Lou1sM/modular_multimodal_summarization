Elizabeth assures her that even if she's no longer a slayer, she's still very much in tune with the universe. Taking this to heart, Lucy gets out her crystal ball, but she collapses before being able to use it. Elizabeth takes her to the hospital for help. Determined to get more of his wonder drug, Kevin tries to con Karen into helping him, but as a former junkie, she's onto him. She offers to help him beat this with real treatment, but she won't do anything to enable him to get more of the drug. Desperate for blood, Ian goes to Chris, who is stunned by Ian's marked increase in blood consumption. Although Ian doesn't want to give a reason for the change, Chris reminds his colleague that he's putting a lot on the line for him. Realizing that Ian is terrified that he will lose control and bite Lucy, Chris agrees to supply as much blood as he needs. Rafe intervenes just as Jamal prepares to participate in his first feeding with a vampire named Stacey. Surprised to see that Jamal has been turned, the slayer demands to know where Alison is, and he turns violent when Jamal refuses to cooperate. A young nurse finds Jamal on the ground, but he gets up and rushes away without allowing her to help. When Joshua tells Alison that he and her father were childhood best friends, she accuses him of lying. She comes up with her own idea of his past, which Joshua admits is painfully true. After leaving her, Joshua makes a mental note to praise Jamal for his help with her. Alison is stunned when Rafe appears in her room."
