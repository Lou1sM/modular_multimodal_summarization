Ian threatens to kill Caleb, who strongly advises him to decide whether it would be worth Lucy's life. Meanwhile, Olivia snipes about Lucy's poor treatment of her and her father. Lucy is confused by Olivia's claim that Ian handed over a fake antidote, but Olivia thinks she's putting on an act. Lucy informs her that she no longer cares what she and Caleb do because there are more important things to worry about. When Caleb and Ian arrive at the Lucy's house, no one is there. Ian finds her hospital ID bracelet on the floor and assumes that Olivia did something to her. Alison lays out the terms under which she will fully cooperate with Joshua as his bride, including no more involuntary recruitment, but the head vampire finds the terms unacceptable. Reminding her that that she isn't the first bride to enter a marriage for strategic reasons, Joshua reiterates his belief that she will eventually grow to love him. A drunken Rafe causes a scene at the Elixir, where he officially announces his retirement as a slayer. Frank struggles with his strong urge to kill Rafe in defiance of Joshua's orders, but Jack hovers protectively to fulfill a promise he made to Alison. As Rafe begins to sober up, Jack states his belief that Rafe hasn't really given up on the woman he loves. Rafe claims that he has indeed given up on Alison, who is clearly going over to the dark side. He further claims that this is fine with him, because he has finally wised up and is now moving on with his life."
