After hours at the Elixir, Jack helps himself to about $1000 from the cash register, informing Reese that it gets easier all the time. Reese shyly admits that she planned a surprise meal for him. Although she's very insecure about it, Jack is very pleased with her surprise. After waiting anxiously for a call from Joshua or Frank, Kevin is angry to learn that Elizabeth tied up the line with a call to Alison. He calls Karen, who expresses concern because of the way he sounds. As Elizabeth tries to take his mind off his problems by seducing him, Karen arrives at the lighthouse to check on her friend. She gives him a bottle of pills to help take the edge off, but Kevin knows they won't do anything for him. Karen finally agrees to help him obtain enough of the drug to get him off it permanently. Ian is stunned to hear that Lucy handed over the antidote, while Lucy is angry with him for keeping the truth from her. Lucy tells him that she's tired of fighting this, and she finally realizes that Caleb and Olivia are much easier to deal with than Joshua. Since Caleb wants to get rid of Joshua as much as they do, she firmly believes that she did the right thing. She also believes that she and Ian can safely make love, despite his protests. Ian succumbs to her advances but flees when his fangs come out. Back at the catacombs, Caleb worries that they may have been tricked again, but as he tries to reason it out, Olivia confidently chugs the liquid behind his back. Worried at first, Caleb decides to trust her instincts the way he has always trusted his own. He urges her to make him the vampire he once was, gasping as she sinks her fangs into his neck."
