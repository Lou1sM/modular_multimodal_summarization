He assures her that he's perfectly happy as a vampire, but he wonders whether she's ready to become one herself. Alison refuses to think that far ahead, preferring to take things one step at a time. She admits that Joshua has granted her requests and that he seems to want her to be happy. Jamal suggests that she could surprise herself and fall in love with Joshua, but Alison knows that her love for Rafe will last forever. Jamal promises never to abandon Alison, and after a chaste kiss, he leaves her to her thoughts. Joshua confronts him outside her room. Under threat of extreme torture and suffering for both of them, he orders Jamal never to touch Alison or give her false hope again. Stepping outside, Alison talks to her absent soul mate. As she wishes for his presence, the wind begins to blow. Meanwhile, Rafe returns to the barn, where he reminisces about the love he and Alison share. He doesn't understand how he could have been so wrong in his belief that nothing could come between them again. He decides not to return to the barn anytime soon because of the intense pain it causes him. Before leaving, he hears Alison's voice telling him \"goodbye\" and saying that she loves him. In the catacombs, Olivia waits anxiously for proof that her bite succeeded in returning Caleb to his former glory. When Caleb eventually opens his eyes, he is overjoyed to discover that he's himself again. He magically transports the two of them out of the catacombs to a more romantic place, where they make love. Caleb confesses his brief notion that he could learn to be happy as a mortal. Although Olivia believes that nothing can hurt them now that they're together, Caleb warns that they're still vulnerable, and he wants her to learn to use her strength and power. Caleb vows never to lose this life again."
