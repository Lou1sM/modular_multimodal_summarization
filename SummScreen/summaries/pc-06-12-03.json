She points out that if Frank plays his cards right, he may be able to get a job with them when Joshua's reign is history. Unimpressed, Frank has his own ideas. Rightfully distrustful, Caleb refuses to let Rafe leave the apartment alone. He wants them to work together to bring down Joshua, get the ring, and rescue Alison. Finally coming to an agreement, they start to head out, but Frank is at the door, threatening to snap Olivia's neck. Working together, Caleb distracts Frank while Rafe sets his sights on a potential weapon. They attack. Rafe belts Frank with a baseball bat. Caleb sets Olivia free and spills acid in Frank's face, causing him to flee the apartment. Caleb realizes that Rafe has also left. Casey tells Ian about her visions, and while he doesn't want to believe them, she insists that they're real. With a heavy heart, Ian tries to explain to Lucy that he's out of ideas, but he can't go through with it. Instead, he claims that he and Chris are working on something better than transfusions. Casey worries that Lucy will figure out the truth when she's all alone, but she and Ian suddenly realize that Rafe's slayer blood may be able to save her. Ian tracks down Rafe and orders him to go to the hospital for Lucy's sake. Rafe promises to go after he takes care of important business, but Ian refuses to wait any longer. Meanwhile, Lucy has a surprise visitor she hopes can help her. Alison denies trying to steal Caleb's ring from Joshua's hand, but he doesn't believe her. Ordering her not to lie to him again, he states that it's time to do things his way. Alison breaks loose and ends up in Jamal's angry grip. Jamal lashes out about her blind devotion to Rafe. He urges Joshua to do what any ordinary vampire would do and just bite her, since she's obviously not worthy to be his queen. Joshua has no intention of doing any such thing. He intends to make her wish that he had only bitten her. Out of his earshot, Alison strikes out at Jamal for putting insane ideas into Joshua's head. Jamal urges her to trust him and not give up on herself or Rafe. Retrieving a vial of the drug that he used on Kevin, Joshua prepares to force Alison to honor and obey him."
