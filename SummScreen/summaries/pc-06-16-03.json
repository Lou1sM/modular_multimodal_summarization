After ordering Jamal to find the slayer, Joshua's hackles rise when he suspects his recruit of working against him. Rejoining his bride, Joshua locks the door behind him and continues his efforts to undermine both her free will and her confidence in Rafe. Still under the influence of the drug, Alison repeats Joshua's words back to him to his satisfaction. Unable to bear the thought of spending eternity with her lecherous new husband, Alison adamantly refuses allow him to bite her. Ricky voices his frustration with Joshua, who has been neglecting his responsibilities to the band. When Jack suggests that Joshua must have a reason for ignoring him, Ricky realizes that it's because of his failure to fulfill his end of the bargain. He puts an end to a scene that Casey is making and then drags her outside, where she tells him about her inability to help the dying Lucy. Ricky's words of sympathy and reassurance eventually lead to an argument about his continued association with Joshua and the club. After witnessing the end of their argument, Karen tries to talk some sense into Ricky, who has fooled himself into believing that his plan can't possibly hurt the woman he loves. Reese and Casey chat about the men in their lives. Jamal looks for the missing Rafe at the club. Jack is relieved to hear that Alison is still human. When Jamal tells Jack that Rafe didn't show up to rescue Alison as planned, Casey overhears and directs him to the hospital. Jack scoffs at Casey's assertion that Reese is in love with him. Pretending to give in, Ricky agrees to get away from the club, but he wants Casey to go out of town with him. Upset by the invitation, Casey turns him down and flees. Ricky is disappointed in himself for what he's doing but doesn't feel that he has a choice. Lucy's unseen visitor returns to her hospital room. Still uncomfortable with subjecting Rafe to a medical procedure he obviously knows nothing about, Chris points out that the transfusion is a long shot. Ian is aware of that, but he feels compelled to try. While Chris preps Rafe for the procedure, Ian informs a surprised Lucy that she'll be receiving a direct transfusion from her cousin. While the transfusion is under way, Jamal bursts into the room, and he's stunned by what he sees. Ian and Chris spring into action when Lucy goes into cardiac arrest."
