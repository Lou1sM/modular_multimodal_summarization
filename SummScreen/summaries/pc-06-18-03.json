    "tvmega_recap": "Christina and Serena give their mom a very happy homecoming, complete with a pajama party, but Lucy's heart breaks as she realizes that she won't be around for important moments in her daughters' lives. After the girls go to bed, Ian comforts Lucy as she cries about the lost future with her daughters. Seeing no other solution, Ian tells her that she can always be with them if she becomes a vampire. With Karen's professional--and personal--help, Kevin fights his way through a rough patch of his recovery. He complains bitterly about the way Lucy walked out on him as soon as things got tough. He's managed to turn everyone against him, and he has nothing left to live for, but Karen insists that she considers him worth saving. Kevin lays his head in her lap as she dabs a wet compress on his head. After rescuing Alison from Joshua's lecherous clutches, Rafe takes her to the barn, where he thinks she'll be safe. Alison assures him that Joshua would never hurt her. She accuses Rafe of abandoning her at Joshua's place because he no longer loves her. Stunned, Rafe tries to explain why her rescue didn't go as planned. He's curious about why she keeps looking at her watch, but she really doesn't know why she feels it's important. Rafe reminds her of the love they share, and he promises to keep her safe from Joshua. Looking into his eyes, Alison remembers. She tells him that she's right where she belongs; she loves him and always will. They share a sweet kiss. Immediately, she begins to shiver, but she doesn't know why. Rafe assumes that she's tired and hungry, and he asks what time it is. The question triggers the brainwashing. When Rafe goes to the car for supplies, Alison takes off. Caleb is amused by Joshua's failure to get his new bride into bed. Joshua accuses him of taking her, but Caleb convinces him that it was the slayer who rescued her. He insults Joshua about his many inadequacies, including a pitiful lunge that Caleb's thousand-year-old grandmother could beat. Joshua in turn taunts Caleb about his failure to protect the ring and therefore his heritage. Not to be outdone, Caleb ridicules him for his inability to make a woman fall in love with him. He further points out that Joshua is incapable of leadership. He challenges him to remove the ring and find out whether his loyal subjects still feel the same way about him. As Joshua stares at the ring and contemplates what to do, Alison returns. Absolutely stunned, Caleb asks what she's doing there, and she replies that it was time to come home."
