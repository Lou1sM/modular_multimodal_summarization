It would allow her to be with him and the girls until he could find a cure for the curse. Lucy tells him that she simply can't do something like that. Unlike him, she has a choice, and she doesn't want to watch her children and all their descendents grow old and die. Being a parent himself, Ian understands her position. Lucy decides to fill her last days with wonderful memories for Ian. Caleb is stunned to see Alison, who states that it was time for her to leave Rafe and return home to Joshua. Caleb accuses Joshua of using drugs to control her. Joshua admits to having been ready to throw in the towel and return the ring until his bride came home to him. Now that she's home, he will never relinquish possession of the ring. Caleb is confident that it won't take long to beat his sworn enemy. He tracks Rafe down at the barn and fills him in on what happened, but the slayer doesn't believe him. Caleb wants to prove that he's telling the truth by going back for both Alison and his ring. Meanwhile, Alison submissively waits for Joshua to tell her how to please him. Joshua tells her to go back to Rafe, but with specific instructions. He intends to set her watch so that the alarm will go off at various times. When she hears the sound, she is to use whatever means necessary to reassure Rafe of her love. He whispers one last command in her ear before letting her go. Back at the barn, Caleb urges Rafe to head out with him now. His plan is thwarted when Alison returns. Although she lies about where she's been, Rafe believes every word she says."
