He goes to the car to get the radio so that they can dance, and while he's gone, the alarm on Alison's watch goes off. When Rafe returns, Alison informs him that it's time to make love--right now. Olivia is puzzled to find that Caleb left during the night. When he comes home, he fills her in on what happened.
