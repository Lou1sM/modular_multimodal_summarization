    "tvmega_recap": "After finding the wounded slayer, Caleb gloats about being right again while Rafe was wrong. He takes Rafe back to the loft, where he and Olivia tend to the slayer's stab wounds. Rafe believes that Caleb is only helping him in order to maintain the balance of good and evil, since they're not certain what will happen if one of them dies. He tries to go to Alison, but he doesn't make it past the door before collapsing. Caleb advises him to help himself first, because if he dies, there won't be anyone to save Alison. Although Joshua tries to convince her otherwise, Alison maintains that she never wanted to hurt Rafe. Joshua gives her some time alone with Jamal, expecting to be notified when she's ready to take full responsibility for the slayer's death. As she tries to explain what happened, her watch alarm sounds again, causing her to see Joshua's face instead of Jamal's. Confused by Alison's strange behavior, Jamal suspects that Joshua is behind what happened to Rafe. He removes her watch and tries to get her out of there immediately, but Joshua catches them before they can leave. After ordering Frank to get rid of Jamal, Joshua informs Alison that she will spend eternity knowing that she is responsible for the deaths of the two men who loved her most--other than him. Chris tranquilizes Kevin to get him out of the way more safely than anything Ian would do. He promises to continue helping Ian but points out that they don't happen to have any angel blood on hand. Elizabeth tracks Kevin down at the hospital and finds him in restraints. She completely misinterprets the situation, thinking that he and Karen are up to something kinky. She refuses to set him loose until he informs her that he needs to get to his dying wife. Devastated over losing Casey a second time, Ricky goes to talk to Karen about it. He is shocked when a battered and bleeding Karen tells him that a car came out of nowhere. Colleen pulls Chris and Ian away when Karen is brought to the hospital. Despite their best efforts, Karen flat lines and can't be revived. Devastated, Chris spends a few moments alone with his friend. He tells her that she was very special and that he always wanted to be more like her. While Ian is with Lucy, a smiling Karen appears at the foot of the bed. Only Lucy can see her angel, whom she now realizes is Karen."
