    "tvmega_recap": "The grieving Ricky regrets not getting Karen to the hospital sooner, but Chris assures him that there was nothing he could have done differently. Although they both suspect that she was running from someone she feared, they understand that knowing exactly what happened won't bring her back. While Lucy has a conversation with Karen's spirit, Ian realizes that their friend is the angel he's been seeking. He persuades a very reluctant Chris to do a transfusion using Karen's blood. Now realizing why Karen's spirit has been coming to her, Lucy is desperate to find another way to save her life. Stating that she's already dead, Karen urges Lucy not to be sad, because she isn't. While Ian and Chris prepare for the transfusion, Karen gives Lucy one last smile and fades away. Chris soon becomes uncomfortable with the way the procedure is affecting Lucy's vital signs, but Ian insists on giving it a chance. Meanwhile, Frank takes Jamal out to kill him, but Jamal keeps him talking in an attempt to save his own life. Evoking Karen's name, Jamal asks how she will feel if Frank murders a friend in cold blood. Before Frank can go through with it, he's interrupted by a phone call from Karen, who urges him not to do it. When the connection goes dead, Frank tries to call her back. He's confused when Ricky answers the phone and tells him to get to the hospital right away. In heaven, Karen is met by Casey, and they watch events unfold in Port Charles together. After the transfusion, Lucy feels that she's completely cured. As she tells Ian and Chris about her crazy dream that Karen healed her, Ian gently fills her in on what happened. Ricky hears this and puts it all together. Realizing that it all makes sense now, he congratulates Casey on a job well done. Just arriving, Frank can't believe the reports of Karen's death, since he just talked to her on the phone. He goes to look at her body, needing to see for himself that she's really gone. Casey lovingly assures Karen that she will have a special place in heaven and that she has given her loved ones a new start. Jamal unties the rope around his feet and thanks Karen for his second chance. Devastated by her death, Frank is bathed in white light as Karen encourages him to let her love guide him until they meet again. After being summoned to the hospital, Scott tracks down Lucy and Ian to find out how badly Karen was hurt in the accident. Throwing her arms around him, Lucy tells him repeatedly that she's sorry. Scott finally seems to understand what happened to his daughter. Karen doesn't want her father to be sad. She's glad to know that she was able to help Lucy. She's also happy to be able to truthfully say that she has no regrets. From heaven, she gives Lucy a final kiss on the cheek, which Lucy feels. Lucy is grateful to her angel for saving her life. Her work done and her goodbyes said, Karen walks with Casey toward her new life in the afterlife."
