After learning Rafe went to the hospital, Livvie races over there to stop him from running into Alison.  At the hospital, Ali awakens after Rafe kisses her and they continue kissing.

Ian declares Alison miracously cured and phones Lucy and learns Kevin's alive.  Rafe, meanwhile, claims he has amnesia.  Alison tries to help him remember, but he tells her he's married.  Livvie then enters and announces she's Rafe's new bride!  Elsewhere, an ominous shadowy figure enters Port Charles."
