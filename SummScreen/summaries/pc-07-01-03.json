    "tvmega_recap": "Several of Karen's loved ones gather in the hospital chapel for an impromptu memorial service. After Ricky and Chris each say a few words praising their friend, Kevin disrupts the service with his bitter accusations that everyone used her. He then attacks Elizabeth for her insecurities about Karen's role in his life. When he goes too far with his remarks to Ian, an outraged Scott shoves him and then steps outside to cool off. Kevin leaves, and Lucy follows to have a talk with him. She learns about his addiction and Karen's sacrifice to help him beat it. Lucy urges Kevin to prove Karen right and show that he's someone worth saving, but Kevin sees himself as a lost cause. Lucy assures Scott that it's okay if he can't stand to be around her anymore, but Scott doesn't feel that way about her. Chris advises Elizabeth to get a dog for a companion instead of hanging around with Kevin. After leaving the hospital, Frank goes to the accident site and lays down a flower, promising Karen that she'll always be his girl. At Caleb's loft, Olivia takes care of Rafe, worried that his death would result in the death of her lover. Reassuring her that he will be fine, Caleb reminds her that this is a big night for them. When he leaves, Rafe has another nightmare about the stabbing. He and Olivia engage in their usual antagonistic dialogue until Caleb returns. Caleb assures Rafe that his plan to rescue Alison is already under way. He turns on the TV special about the band and says to watch closely. Believing that she deserves no joy for the rest of her life, Alison writes a goodbye letter to her mother and then tells Joshua to go ahead and make her his vampire bride. Although her mind was controlled by Joshua, she feels ultimately responsible for Rafe's death, since she was the one who actually stabbed him."
