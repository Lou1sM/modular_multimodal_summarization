She speaks to Christina on the phone and promises to see her in a little while, but her plans change when Ian becomes feverish with blood hunger. Dissuading him from having a packet of blood, Lucy proposes finding out whether her slayer powers have returned. In the interest of \"science,\" they make love on the living room couch. Joshua prepares to settle down with Alison and watch the MV-3 special. Alison reiterates her desire to be turned as punishment for causing the deaths of two of the best men she's ever known. Forcing the watch back onto her wrist, Joshua resumes the mind control. When the alarm goes off, Alison kisses him. A crowd gathers at the Elixir to watch the MV-3 special on the Stephen Clay Experience. Ricky, Caz, Elizabeth, Reese, and Joshua are all interviewed, as well as musician Angela McClosky. The band members hint at the possibility that their former frontman is a vampire, and Elizabeth, as his estranged wife, confirms that he does bite. The special is filled with the band's music, as well as images of blood packets, magazine covers, and newspaper headlines. They also show footage of the concert, including Rafe's attention-grabbing scene on the stage. During a commercial break, Ricky sees Casey smiling at him from across the room, but she vanishes before he can reach her. Ricky isn't into the high life anymore after losing Casey and watching Karen die. In the special, Joshua takes full credit for the band's success and blames Stephen for its ultimate failure. Jack predicts that things are about to fall down around Joshua's head, and he's right. Everyone is stunned when Stephen Clay himself gives an interview on the special. He describes Joshua as a liar, a cheat, and a thief, and he blames the manager for the problems with the band. \"Stephen\" also announces his plan to reunite the group. Hearing this, Reese becomes excited, but Ricky is finished with the band. Watching from home, Joshua is apoplectic. He calls the club and orders Jack to turn the TV off. Jack instead cranks the volume for everyone's pleasure. Joshua is livid to find Caleb and Olivia in his home. They have possession of the remote, and they turn the TV back on for the big news. The announcement states that as they were putting together the final cut, they received word that Joshua Temple had been found dead of unknown causes."
