    "tvmega_recap": "After the MV-3 narrator announces the news of Joshua's death, Caleb taunts the stunned vampire leader. Since the ring will protect Joshua from all vampires, the slayer makes his entrance. Alison is both stunned and relieved to see Rafe alive, albeit bandaged and wearing a sling. Rafe attacks Joshua with a vengeance and soon emerges victorious; Joshua's body lies on the floor with the stake through the heart. The body vanishes, and when Caleb goes to get his ring, it isn't there. He accuses Rafe of reneging on his end of the bargain, but Rafe denies the accusation. He tries to take Alison and leave, but Caleb uses his powers to lock the doors. Rafe removes his shirt and sling to prove that he doesn't have the ring. From the way Alison is dressed, it's already obvious that she can't be hiding it. Olivia urges Rafe to see what Alison has become, cattily pointing out that she clearly wasn't planning to play chess in her red lace dress and stiletto heels. Overcome with remorse and humiliation, Alison begs Caleb to let her go. He does, and Alison flees, with Rafe right behind her. Olivia confronts Caleb for letting them go, but he points out if Rafe had his ring, he would have handed it over to save Alison. Rafe follows Alison as she flees barefoot through the woods, finally catching up with her. Alison sobs as she confesses how close she came to giving Joshua everything he wanted and becoming his bride. Fights break out at the Elixir in the wake of the news of Joshua's death. Jack is surprised to hear that Jamal is still a vampire, but Reese explains that since Joshua wasn't born into a vampire family, all his recruits will stay the way they are. Drowning his sorrows in shots of tequila, Jamal laments not being able to have the simple life he dreamed of. When he rejects Stacey's advances because she's a vamp, she informs a belligerent male vampire that Jamal doesn't think she's good enough for him. Glad to have a reason to fight Jamal, the vampire announces to the crowd that Jamal considers himself too good for them. Jack stops the anticipated brawl by getting everyone's attention and announcing that he has some new rules for the club. After making love, Ian reports that all his vampire symptoms are gone. Suddenly feeling a major shift in the forces of good and evil, Lucy realizes that her powers are back. Gail surprises them by bringing Christina home, but at least she warned them with a call from the car. Lucy gives Ian the news that Tim will be bringing Danny home to stay. Ian doesn't like this idea at first, but Lucy changes his mind. She wants them all to be a family, and she's going to make Kevin understand that their marriage is truly over. Meanwhile, Kevin is at the Elixir, looking at a photo of himself with Lucy. After running into a mysterious person lurking outside the club, Elizabeth joins Kevin and talks about how to get back what they've lost. Agreeing, Kevin walks out the door. Back at the loft, Olivia vows to get the ring back, no matter what it takes. She's afraid that Caleb will stop loving her if she doesn't."
