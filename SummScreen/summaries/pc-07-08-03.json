    "tvmega_recap": "Lucy and Ian are optimistic about their future together. After Kevin places a call to Children's Social Services about a child in an unsafe environment, Lucy receives a visit from a social worker, who refuses to confirm Lucy's assumption that Kevin is behind the allegations. Elizabeth tries to get a doctor to look at her injured ankle, but Chris signs out and tells her to just put some ice on it. When Jamal goes to the bank to place Caleb's ring in a safe deposit box, he runs into Imani, the young woman who crashed through his ceiling. While they are there, two armed, masked men attempt to rob the bank. Using the ring, Jamal takes charge, forcing the men to drop their guns and flee the bank. Imani is very upset about the violence, which is something she had hoped to escape by coming to Port Charles. Jamal realizes that he has no future with her because of his life as a vampire. After dropping off his reinstatement papers, Ian tracks down Chris, who is pleased to announce that he is close to creating the perfect synthetic blood. Ian's request that Kevin make the divorce easy is met with sarcasm. Chris has his traditional martini with Eve and pours a diet cola for Karen, who has now joined Eve in heaven. Elizabeth tracks him down, annoyed that he ignored her request for treatment. To get rid of her, Chris takes a quick look at her ankle and then gets back to his deceased friends. Not wanting him to drink alone, Elizabeth joins him. Although he's not thrilled about it, Chris allows her to stay as long as she doesn't sit in one of the chairs reserved for his departed colleagues. Lucy informs Ian that Children's Social Services is trying to take Danny away."
