Thinking he's getting mixed signals, Jamal wishes that he knew what she was thinking. Kevin informs the social worker that he filed a false report against Ian and would like to withdraw it. He wants to do whatever is necessary to make things right, and he's willing to accept the consequences for his vindictiveness. Ian assumes that this is another act, but Lucy doesn't quite know what to believe. Praying for forgiveness for everything he's done, Kevin breaks down and cries. When Rafe orders Olivia to stay away from him and Alison, she accuses him of being in denial about the dark side that has awakened in Alison. Denying that his fianc\u00e9e has a dark side, Rafe in turn accuses Olivia of still being jealous of Alison. After watching the fireworks display on the docks, Caleb realizes that something isn't quite right with Alison, who explains that she's still feeling the effects of Joshua's drugs. She turns down Caleb's offer to see her home safely, but when she stands up, her knees give out. Caleb catches her and helps her sit down. They have a friendly talk about her relationship with Rafe, as well as how Caleb felt when Olivia drove the silver arrow through his heart. Noticing that Alison isn't doing well, Caleb insists on taking her home. She doesn't think she can make it, so he picks her up. As he starts to carry her home, Rafe and Olivia show up and glare at them accusingly."
