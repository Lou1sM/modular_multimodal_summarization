While he can't be certain that the change in him is forever, he wants to use this time to try to make things right. Lucy tells him about her wish that he could be the man he once was. Jamal is stunned to realize that he can hear Imani's thoughts. Thinking that the ring must be responsible, he tests it out by wishing for snow--which he sees when he looks out the window. Jack informs him that he is the new owner of the Elixir, thanks to a contract that he allegedly signed before Joshua's death-- which he's actually about to write now. At Jack's insistence, Jamal asks Imani out on a date, but when he hears her thought about how they will never hook up, he cancels. Thinking that they can never be together as long as he's a vampire, Jamal considers wishing to be mortal again. On the docks, Rafe wrongly assumes that Caleb was trying to hurt Alison, while Olivia is convinced that her enemy is trying to destroy her happiness again by going after Caleb. Concerned about Alison, Caleb wants her to get to a doctor. He and Alison maintain that they are just friends, but Olivia and Rafe hold onto their own theories about what's going on. Rafe is hurt to find out that Alison confided in his worst enemy about their personal life. After giving Caleb the silent treatment all the way home, Olivia issues an ultimatum. Not appreciating being told what to do, Caleb gives his answer by storming out of the loft."
