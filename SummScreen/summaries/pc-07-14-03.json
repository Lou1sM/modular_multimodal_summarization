Testing it out with a wish for money, he turns around and finds a large bag filled with hundred-dollar bills. Imani stops by to let him know that he forgot to pay his bill at the Elixir. She finds the bag, which Jamal tried unsuccessfully to stuff inside his refrigerator. Assuring her that he's not a criminal, he gives her $100 to pay for the bill and her tip. Hoping that she had another reason for stopping by, he's disappointed by her reaction but decides not to push her. Instead, he makes another wish and instantly hears her thoughts. He spooks her by echoing her thought that someone is expecting her. Rafe takes Alison back to the warehouse after having her checked out at the hospital. He promises to focus on getting her well and opening their new gym. They find that the warehouse has been vandalized, and the vandal is still there. Attacking the terrified kid with a stake, Rafe demands to know whether Caleb put him up to this. Alison believes the kid's claim that he doesn't know anyone named Caleb--and that he didn't know anyone was living there. She pulls Rafe away, and the kid bolts. Realizing that he almost killed someone who didn't deserve it, Rafe promises to end his obsession with Caleb. At the Elixir, Caleb dances with Stacy and two other vamps. Unhappy with the potential for feeding and unable to prevent it himself, Jack calls Olivia. Seeing Casey yet again, Ricky demands to know why she appears only to him. When she suggests that this is all in his mind, Ricky tries to prove his point by showing her the earring she left behind, but he can't find it. Reese is disappointed by Jack's reminder that their relationship is supposed to be simple. When Olivia arrives at the Elixir and does a sexy dance for Caleb, he excuses himself from the others and takes her outside, where he kisses her passionately."
