When Ian goes out for pizza, Lucy picks up the phone and finds that Christina has called her daddy. At the warehouse, Jamal intervenes in the argument. When Imani shows up to look at the apartment Alison and Rafe have for rent, Jamal shows her around the apartment.

They return to find Alison and Olivia in a full-blown paint fight. Deciding that it's not a good idea to rent from Alison, Imani leaves.
