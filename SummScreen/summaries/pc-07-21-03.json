He belligerently opposes Kevin's suggestions for times when he can see his own daughter. Kevin leaves without anything having been resolved. To prove that Ian is the only man she wants, Lucy signs the divorce papers. Realizing his mistake, Jamal laughs off the idea that he's really a vampire, but Imani has heard enough about Port Charles to believe that it's possible. Jamal finally admits that it's true. When he apologizes for barging into the church, Imani speaks about God's unconditional love and the fact that everyone has secrets. Jamal misinterprets her reaction as pity, because he expected and even encouraged her to run. He turns down her invitation to go out for a smoothie, and they agree to go their separate ways. Outside, Jamal asks the ring what good it is if it won't give him what he wants most. When Rafe storms into Caleb's loft to look for Alison, they realize that their lovers seem to have exchanged personalities. Worried that Olivia will hurt Alison, they head out to find the two women. Alison attacks Olivia on the docks, and when she won't back down, Olivia hisses and bares her fangs as her natural defenses surface. Caleb and Rafe arrive in time to stop anything bad from happening, but their efforts to keep the two apart fail. Alison breaks free and tries to attack her enemy again, but the two women become frozen in their tracks as church bells ring. When the ringing stops, they are themselves again--and wearing their own shoes. After Rafe leaves with Alison, Caleb tells Olivia that someone is obviously using his ring."
