Frank admits to seeing her loving face at home everywhere he looks, which is why he started sleeping at the cemetery. Stating that Karen is watching Frank, Ricky urges him to stop trying to destroy the only man she truly loved. Casey congratulates Ricky, who is frustrated to see her vanish before his eyes yet again. Alison and Rafe prepare for the grand opening of Body and Soul, their new gym. After assuring Alison that they won't be bothered by their respective enemies anymore, Rafe is annoyed by the unwanted arrival of Caleb and Olivia. After gushing over what her daughter has done with the place, Elizabeth can't keep from insulting her estranged husband's latest \"concubine.\" Alison apologizes to Imani for her behavior the day before and asks whether she's still looking for an apartment, but Imani has already found one. Rafe tells Caleb that the ring is obviously responsible for the personality switch. In spite of what happened, Rafe would prefer that the ring stay where it is--out of Caleb's hands. Alison teases Jamal about his interest in Imani. After witnessing Elizabeth's attempt to convince Caleb that she's doing great without him, Chris informs her that her game needs some work. Elizabeth rewards him for his unwanted input by pouring her martini on the front of his pants. After hearing Imani's thoughts again, Jamal persuades Alison to offer her free membership for a year. Convinced that he knows Imani from somewhere, Rafe approaches Jamal for information about her. After telling Caleb that Imani must be the one using the ring, Olivia sends Imani to look for another Elixir employee. When Imani goes outside, Caleb corners her."
