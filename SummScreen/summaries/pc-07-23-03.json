    "tvmega_recap": "Although glad to have signed the divorce papers, Lucy is also sad that things things didn't work out after almost ten years with Kevin. Alison is pleasantly surprised when Kevin asks for a membership application to the gym. After cattily criticizing the decor in the gym and therefore angering Jack, Reese asks for an explanation of his relationship with Alison. Informing Jack that he says nicer things about Alison than he says about her, Reese says that he can make it up to her by handing over the key to his house. Jack reluctantly gives it to her, specifying that they are not living together. He knows he's in trouble when she states that she'll see him \"at home.\" Elizabeth apologizes to Chris for pouring her martini on the front of his pants. Chris firmly believes that Georges is a fictional character she made up for Caleb's benefit, but Elizabeth insists that her European designer friend agreed to design a sports line for the gym. She's upset by the realization that he's probably not going to show up, which will simply humiliate her in front of her daughter. Getting an idea, Chris dashes off without an explanation. Olivia informs Kevin that his return to his former self isn't working for her. She hates seeing him this way, and she urges him to fight for Lucy if he really loves her. Reminding his daughter that he accepts her choices in life, he asks her to return the favor and mind her own business. Hearing her mother mention Chris Ramsey's name, Alison demands to know whether they're sleeping together, and Elizabeth states that she would rather be a nun. When Chris returns in a disguise, he seems to fool everyone but Elizabeth into believing that he's her famous designer friend from Europe. Jamal assures Rafe that Imani doesn't have Caleb's ring, and he doesn't want the slayer to screw things up for him by wrongly accusing her. Outside with Caleb, Imani maintains that she doesn't have his ring, and she doesn't appreciate being called a thief. When Caleb grabs her wrist, Jamal appears and orders him to back off. After Imani goes back inside, Jamal finally admits to both Caleb and Rafe that he has the ring."
