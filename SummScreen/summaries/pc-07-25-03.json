Casey sadly informs him that she wishes he hadn't said that. After she vanishes before his eyes, Ricky immediately regrets his words, but it's too late. Jamal swears that he had the ring in his pocket, but it's not there now. He claims to have stolen it in an effort to keep Rafe and Caleb from killing each other, because he just wants peace. As for how he got his hands on it, he was there when Rafe killed Joshua, and the smoke was his cover as he grabbed the ring. Claiming him as one of his own tribe, Caleb grabs Jamal and vows to make him pay for losing his family ring. Rafe responds by grabbing Olivia in the same manner and threatening her life if Jamal isn't released. Not willing to risk her life, Caleb releases Jamal. At home, Jack is dumbfounded when Reese sees him with the ring and assumes that it's for her. Her answer is an ecstatic \"yes!\" When Jack claims that he's holding the ring for his brother, Reese tries unsuccessfully to cover her disappointment. After making love, Reese is excited about living with Jack and wonders where to put her clothes. Near panic, Jack gets the ring and wishes that Reese would focus on someone else. Reese immediately decides to go home. She finds Ricky outside the house and fixates on him. Alison informs Rafe that she is glad that Jamal took the ring. When she begs him to choose her for once, he does, and he claims that he always will. Caleb informs Olivia that he has to go \"home\" to take care of this problem, and it's not a place she can go as well. After putting the ring in the armoire for safekeeping, Jack is confronted by Jamal, who wants the ring back immediately."
