Alison has a fun time with Jack and, later, after laying back against him tells him he's just \"\"what the doctor ordered.\"\"  Chris accuses Ian of being jealous of the \"\"Shadow\"\" because Ian's not the hero anymore.  After talking with Nurse Colleen, Frank and Rafe, Ian becomes suspicious that Chris might be The Avatar's host body.  Livvie tries to hide her disappointment when she learns that her baby's heartbeat is unusually strong, despite her fall down the stairs.
