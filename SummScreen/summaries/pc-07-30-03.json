Caleb offers to have the band play at her fashion show in a mutually beneficial arrangement that would bring business to the gym and give the band a chance to try out a new song. Lucy is dumbfounded by Rafe's determination to stay out of whatever Caleb is planning. She doesn't understand how he can do it, but Rafe explains his promise to Alison that they will have a normal life. Because of what she's sensing in the universe, Lucy intends to cancel plans for a picnic, but Rafe urges her to go on the picnic and give Christina the normal life that Lucy won't give herself. At the hospital, Ian pages Chris to broach the subject of dealing with the aging process. Kevin overhears and agrees to keep the secret if it will benefit his daughter, who is also a vampire. When Lucy and Christina arrive to take Ian on the picnic, Christina invites Kevin to go with them. At Body and Soul, Reese tells Jack that she's been too busy to even think about returning his calls. After talking about their families, Ricky invites Reese over for some arroz con pollo that his mother gave him. Jack tells Jamal about his girlfriend's abrupt change of heart, and when he mentions making a wish involving her, Jamal fills him in on the ring's powers. Unconvinced, Jack tests Jamal's theory by asking Reese what would have happened if he really had proposed. Contrary to last night, Reese isn't interested in a long-term relationship with him. Jack is annoyed with Jamal for not telling him about the ring's powers sooner, because he would have made his wishes count. Pointing out that the ring is dangerous, Jamal says that he's glad it's at the bottom of the river. When Alison takes Caleb to see Rafe, she's surprised when her fiance agrees to let the band play."
