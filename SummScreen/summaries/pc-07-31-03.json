    "tvmega_recap": "For Christina's benefit, Ian officially invites Kevin to join them on the picnic, and Kevin accepts the invitation. Jamal asks Imani out for pizza, and she agrees on the condition that he let her treat him. Alison is annoyed with Rafe for giving Caleb the go-ahead to play at their fashion show. Olivia doesn't like the idea either, but Caleb assures her that everything will be all right. Alison becomes angrier to hear Rafe talk about the necessity of finding the ring, but Rafe maintains that no one can have a normal life unless he can keep the ring out of Caleb's hands. Alison doesn't want Caleb's band at their show, and she would rather not have the show at all. She reluctantly agrees not to cancel it, since so many people are looking forward to it. Caleb takes Olivia to the Pizza Shack, where he explains that his father's voice validated much of what he already knew. The music is the key to getting his ring back, which is why he wants to play the gig at the fashion show. He will use his new song to ensure that whoever has the ring will bring it to him, and he intends to make that person pay a heavy price. Christina thoroughly enjoys the outing with her mommy, daddy, and Ian. She takes pictures of them and runs off to see a bunny that passed by earlier. As Christina sits alone by the edge of the river, she reaches into the water and pulls out Caleb's ring."
