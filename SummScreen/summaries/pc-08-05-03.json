When Lucy admits that she kissed Kevin, Ian goes into denial, thinking that it couldn't possibly have happened. He fills her in on the research to restore his mortality. When Kevin arrives with Christina, Ian takes the little girl outside so that Kevin and Lucy can speak privately. Although Lucy denies that the kiss meant anything, Kevin knows that something is happening between them. Alison is appalled to see that she and Caleb made the front page of the morning paper. Olivia seems to take the photo better than expected, but Caleb doesn't know that she's plotting her revenge against Alison. Against her better judgment, Alison agrees to let Olivia be a model in the fashion show. She asks Caleb not to hurt anyone, but he is prepared to do what it takes to get his ring back."
