    "tvmega_recap": "With the show scheduled to begin in an hour, Caleb wonders where Olivia is, unaware that she's outside, paying a man to do something at exactly 10:30. Caleb prepares to exact his own revenge on the person who has his ring. As \"Georges,\" Chris seems to come into contact with almost everyone present. Fretting about one missing model, he tries unsuccessfully to recruit various people to fill in. Reese apologizes to Ricky for her behavior and reiterates her desire to meet his mother. Olivia bosses the other models around to keep everything on schedule. Jack apologizes to Reese, who can't forget his hurtful accusation about her willingness to sleep around. To Jamal's amusement, Imani destroys the film belonging to a photographer who took her picture. Ian figures out that \"Georges\" is really Chris in disguise. After the band plays their new song, Christina tries to get to Caleb, but Kevin holds onto her. Watching the clock, Olivia worries that Alison won't be in place in time. Christina makes a wish that her daddy could live with her and Lucy again. Kevin's friendly offer to introduce Alison at the end of the show goes horribly wrong when a light crashes down on his head at exactly 10:30, as he stands where Olivia expected Alison to be. Olivia's actions further backfire on her when the \"accident\" causes Christina to drop the ring."
