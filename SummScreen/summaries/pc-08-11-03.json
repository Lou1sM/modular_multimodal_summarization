Before they can leave for the gym, Caleb appears, taunting them with the fact that he is wearing his ring. Although Jamal wants to take it away from him, Rafe reminds him that the ring protects Caleb from all other vampires. Rafe grabs a scalpel to use against his enemy, but Alison shows up and inadvertently stops Rafe from making his move before Caleb vanishes. Alison is disgusted to hear that Rafe intended to cut the ring off Caleb's finger. She's also glad to hear that Caleb has his ring back. Her words stun Rafe, who can't believe that she trusts Caleb not to use the ring against them. He vows to do whatever it takes to get the ring back. When Chris and Ian fill Kevin in on his condition, Kevin realizes that he may be facing permanent paralysis. He asks Ian to remove himself from his case, and although Lucy objects, Ian agrees that it would be for the best. When Kevin asks for Christina, Ian goes to get her. Lucy assures Kevin that he will be all right. Christina requests that Kevin go home with her and Lucy. Although Imani turns down Jamal's offer to stay at his place for safety, she asks him to walk her to work, and they leave the hospital hand in hand. After leaving Rafe, Caleb goes to Olivia, who is crying her eyes out in the stairwell. He holds her responsible for what happened to her father, because he knows that she was trying to hurt Alison. He is furious with her for sabotaging his plans, as well as for lying about how she felt about the photo of him with Alison. Olivia notices his ring and begs him to use it to help her father, but he refuses. He leaves Olivia in the stairwell alone after she refuses to go home with him."
