    "tvmega_recap": "Jack apologizes to Reese and tries to explain the ring's role in their relationship problems, but it just makes things worse. After Ricky denies that he still sees Casey, Reese finds him with his invisible girlfriend and orders her to leave Ricky alone. Lucy finds herself incapable of denying Christina's request to have Kevin live with them, but Ian doesn't like the idea at all. After hearing Lucy's reasons for wanting to grant Christina's wish, Ian agrees to go along with it. Olivia informs Kevin that he will be staying with her and Caleb, making it clear that she wants his help with Caleb in return. Sick of her egocentrism, Kevin calls her on her behavior and declines her offer to stay at the loft. Horribly offended by his accusation that she's only thinking of herself, Olivia runs out, crying. Lucy and Ian officially invite Kevin to stay with them. After spontaneously kissing Chris, Elizabeth slaps the bewildered man and warns him never to take advantage of her that way again."
