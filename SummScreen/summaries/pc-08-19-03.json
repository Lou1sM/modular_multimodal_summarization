She believes that he never cared about her and that their friendship meant nothing to him. After sharing a long, slow kiss with Jamal, Imani admits that it was wonderful--and a big mistake.

Jack goes to meet Rafe, who attacks him for using Alison as bait. Jack tells him to do this himself, but it's too late. Olivia confronts them, saying that she knew that something was up."
