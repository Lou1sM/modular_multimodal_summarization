Unwilling to take a break, Lucy turns down Ian's invitation to lie down with him for a little while. Feeling guilty, she goes to Ian and lies down with him. Before they can make love, Kevin cries out in frustration from the living room, causing Lucy to push Ian away. Pleased to have caught Jack and Rafe conspiring against her, Olivia rejects Jack's explanation and calls him a liar. Jack makes up a story about Rafe's attempts to keep him from getting involved with her again. Rafe goes along with this and accuses Jack of having no pride. Olivia regrets giving Jack a hard time. Jack says that he simply refuses to let Rafe control him the way Caleb tries to control the vampires, but Olivia is convinced that he still cares about her. Jack tells her to pick up the things she left at his house before he tosses them out, encouraging her to use her key if he's not there. When he has to leave, she assumes that he's meeting a woman. She calls home, but Caleb is gone again. Meanwhile, Caleb laughs at the idea of caring about what Alison thinks of him. Alison believes it irritates him to know that she isn't swayed by his charms. She boasts that Rafe is superior to him. Rafe appears and reminds the vampire that he's supposed to stay away from Alison. Although she tries to stop him, Caleb starts dropping hints about their meeting. This forces Alison to come clean about what happened the night before. When Rafe and Caleb argue about the women in their lives, Caleb advises Rafe to love Alison now, because as mortals, they don't have eternity. Rafe fills Alison in on his plan to get the ring back, and Alison insists on allowing Jack to use her as bait. When Caleb returns home, Olivia isn't there. She lets herself into Jack's house and starts looking for her things. Fresh from the shower and wearing only a towel, Jack greets her."
