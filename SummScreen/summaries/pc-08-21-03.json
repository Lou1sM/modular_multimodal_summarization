Lucy becomes optimistic when Kevin claims to have felt pain in his left arm, but Kevin doesn't feel anything during Ian's examination. When he lashes out at Lucy, Ian sends her out for some air and refuses to let Kevin take out his anger on her. At this, Kevin reminds Ian of the many reasons he has to be angry, including the fact that his wife is making love to another man. Ian informs him that Lucy is no longer his wife. Jack's state of undress embarrasses Olivia, who offers to come back later. Jack insists that she stay and go through the things she left behind. Despite Rafe's best attempts to talk her out of it, Alison insists on being the bait they need to get the ring. While talking to Lucy, Rafe realizes that the ring is responsible for both Kevin's abrupt change of heart and his paralysis. When Jamal goes to pick Imani up for their date, he becomes alarmed. Kicking the door in, he finds that the room is a wreck. Imani is nowhere in sight, and there are some strange scratch marks on the sill by the open window. Alison visits Caleb to apologize for judging him, but he accuses her of making another attempt to get his ring. Denying any such thing, she turns to leave, and Caleb makes an apology of his own. Lucy is stunned to think that Christina's wish is responsible for paralyzing Kevin. She wonders whether the ring could be used for good, but Rafe reminds her that it belongs to the evil Caleb. While going through her things nostalgically with Jack, Olivia lets her guard down with her old lover. Caleb and Alison shake hands in friendship."
