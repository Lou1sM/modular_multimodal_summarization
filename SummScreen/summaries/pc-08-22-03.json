Before leaving, she plants a charm from her bracelet at the loft. Feeling challenged, Jack kisses Olivia. Jamal attacks an intruder in Imani's room, who turns out to be Rafe. Jamal wants Rafe's help finding her, but the slayer insists that Jamal forget ever having met her. He alleges that every wish made on the ring is turning dangerous. Jack uses Olivia's jealousy of Alison to plant more seeds of doubt about her future with Caleb. Searching for Imani, Jamal finds a paw print and a scrap of cloth. The \"photographer\" quits his assignment, informing Rafe that he's not being paid enough for such a dangerous job. Jack tapes the box of Olivia's things closed.
