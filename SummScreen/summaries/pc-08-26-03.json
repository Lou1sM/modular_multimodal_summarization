When Ian good-naturedly describes himself as a natural-born hero, Chris points out that he's kicking poor old Kevin out in the cold. Caleb wakes up as Olivia tries to remove his ring. Olivia worries that Caleb is bored with her now that he has everything he has ever wanted. Lucy gently wakes Christina and sends her off to clean her room. She tries to broach the subject of getting Kevin to move out, but he has already made the decision to do just that. He wishes that he could turn back the clock to their wedding day. If he weren't trapped in a wheelchair, he would fight for her. Lucy tells him that it would be a losing battle, because she loves Ian. When Ian tells Kevin that everything has been taken care of, Kevin realizes that they had intended to kick him out. He asks to speak with Christina alone. Christina asks Kevin to stay. Caleb finds Alison's charm and moves it out of sight with his foot so that Olivia won't see it. Chris is stunned to hear that Elizabeth has turned his penthouse into the clothing production center. Still angry about Jack's accusations, Rafe asks Alison for her honest opinion as to whether he has a God complex. After initially laughing at the question, Alison carefully tells him what might give people that idea. Insulted, Rafe accuses her of thinking he's a world-class ass. After apologizing for not taking her feelings into account, Rafe asks Alison to tell him when he's being a jackass. When Alison tells him about planting her charm at Caleb's loft, Rafe loudly tells her that it was a dumb thing to do. While Jack observes form the bar, Alison complies with Rafe's request and informs him that he is being a jackass. Rafe worries that Caleb will know what she's up to, and he doesn't like the prospect of dealing with an out-of-control Caleb. Caleb examines the charm and knows exactly what Alison was trying to do."
