When he asks about the guy who's been chasing her, Imani says that he obsessed over her to the point where she had to run, and she's never stopped. Jamal promises to take care of her now, and Imani is touched to have someone to turn to for the first time. Alison is confident that Caleb won't hurt her, but Rafe isn't so sure. He comes up with a plan to get her charm back. Alison calls Caleb to ask him to the club so that she can tell him about a proposition she has for him. Believing she's up to something, Caleb agrees and takes Olivia with him. Alison enlists Jack's help distracting Olivia from her conversation with Caleb. When Reese tells Ricky about the busted light, he immediately suspects Casey but doesn't let on. Reese confides that she's changed quite a bit since becoming mortal again, and she would like to know whether he felt something when they kissed. Ricky warns her that they can't have a relationship, since every woman he becomes involved with goes away permanently. Thinking he's blowing her off, Reese tries to leave, but Ricky invites her inside for a drink. Over a beer, Reese apologizes for losing it, and Ricky invites her to a Garza family barbecue. When she goes home to change for the event, Ricky orders Casey to leave her alone. Casey laughs and doesn't bother to appear to him. Ricky wants her to leave him alone as well. Alison asks Caleb to play at her next fashion show, and he agrees. Olivia approaches Jack while they work out the details. Jack fantasizes about a happy ending with the old Livvie. Alison tells Caleb that she lost her charm at his loft, and Caleb tells her that he found it. They go outside, where Caleb places it in her hand and closes her fingers around it. Olivia looks outside and believes they are holding hands. Although Rafe's search of the loft doesn't produce Alison's charm, the slayer is quite pleased to find Caleb's hidden book."
