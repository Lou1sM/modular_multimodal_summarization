Kevin promises to let her visit him every day but says that he really does have to go home now. Putting her little head down on his arm, Christina begs her daddy to stay. Lucy tries to come to terms with Kevin's departure. Although she wishes that Kevin had never changed into the horrible person he was for so long, she knows that she and Ian would still be together now, no matter what. With Christina's wish coming apart, Kevin finds that he can move his left hand. Rafe is excited to stumble on Caleb's book. When Olivia confronts them outside the club, Caleb and Alison explain why they are together. Fighting her insecurities and jealousy, Olivia asks Caleb not to make her struggle any hard than it already is. Rafe fills Alison in on his discovery at Caleb's loft and tells her of his intention to go to hell, just as Caleb did. He silences Alison's protestations with kisses. Back at the loft, Caleb senses something amiss but sees nothing suspicious. Olivia finds a ring in the jewelry box and assumes it's the fake that Caleb used to fool Alison. Getting an idea, she keeps it for an opportune moment. Giving Caleb a relaxing massage, Olivia removes his ring and replaces it with the one she found. She tells Caleb that she wants to be the only one to ever touch him this way. Caleb opens his eyes in awareness. Believing the coast is clear, Rafe calls on Caleb's father as if he himself is the vampire's son. Alison is horrified to witness him vanish before her eyes."
