    "tvdb": "On the hospital roof, Caleb strangles Jack while Eve calls for \"\"Michael,\"\" who emerges.  Gabriela arrives before Lucy can shoot Caleb with a stake.  Pushing Gaby out of the way, Ian gets shot instead.  Caleb grabs Eve and Livvie offers herself as a sacrifice.  Eve again appeals for Michael, who's confused by the voices in his head.  Pleading with God, Michael/Caleb is struck by lighting and turns to dust.  Jack, Livvie and Gaby return to normal and Chris has no vampire symptoms.  Everyone prays in the chapel.  Eve weeps for Michael, then goes into premature labor.  Livvie hears Caleb's voice and his ring appears in her hand."
