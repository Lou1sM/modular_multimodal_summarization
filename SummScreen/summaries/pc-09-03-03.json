Keeping himself unseen and unheard, Caleb follows her around the barn as she berates herself for going to the vampire and forces herself to have faith. Rafe learns that he is in hell, and that he's not wanted there. An unseen force knocks him around and warns that he has made a very big mistake. Realizing that Alison may be in danger, he begs for her safety. Alison decides to go to hell and bring him back. Her plan is unsuccessful until she manages to remember Rafe's exact words and actions. The barn door flies open as she completes the incantation. To test the ring, Olivia wishes for a glass of lemonade, which immediately appears on the table beside her. Returning home early, Caleb gives her the ring from his hand and urges her to make a wish, but she refuses. To keep him from making one for her--and finding out that his ring doesn't work--Olivia gives in and wishes for him to make love to her. Afterward, Caleb accuses her of giving his ring to the slayer. Although she protests that he's crazy, Caleb raises a stake over her, prepared to destroy her. Olivia wakes up screaming; it was a nightmare. Angry and disappointed that she still hasn't told him the truth, Caleb commands her to sleep. He removes the ring from her pocket but then decides to put it back. He's giving her one final test, and it will determine her fate."
