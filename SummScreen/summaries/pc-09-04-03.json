Wrongly assuming that the doctors have made a breakthrough, Lucy worries when she learns that her lover is a guinea pig and that Chris isn't at all comfortable with the situation. Chris decides to throw out the serum after it fails. Telling Lucy that he can't continue to depend on her for relief, Ian takes off. When the barn door flies open, Caleb steps inside. Alison assumes that he returned to help her bring Rafe back, but he has no intention of doing any such thing. Alison hatefully tells the vampire that she could drive a stake through his heart and not blink an eye. She grabs Caleb's hand and touches the ring, wishing for Rafe's return. She doesn't understand why it doesn't work until she realizes that he is wearing the fake. After waking up alone, Olivia frantically checks her pocket to ensure that the ring is still there. Relieved to find it, she sets out to think of the perfect wish. She tracks down Kevin at the hospital and apologizes for her selfishness, admitting that it's taken a long time to get her priorities straight. After taking out the ring without his knowledge, she urges him to help her come up with a way to help him feel better, but Kevin really doesn't know what she can do for him. After Kevin stresses the importance of family, Olivia decides exactly what her wish will be."
