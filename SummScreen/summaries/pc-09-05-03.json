When Jamal accidentally drops the newspaper clipping that he took from Imani's things, his angry roommate picks it up. She reluctantly tells him a little about her past. The murdered man was her professor, who was a very nice man. She didn't kill him, but Jamal's actions may end up getting her killed. Now knowing exactly what she wants from the ring, Olivia orders a lobster dinner as part of the romantic evening she's planning. After an argument with Jack prompts Olivia to wish that he didn't hate her anymore, Jack watches her through the window, buys a single red rose from a flower vendor, and takes off early. A man with a gun looks through a folder about Imani. Rafe is informed that being stuck in hell is the price he must pay for his arrogance. The slayer learns that he has changed the future by violating a sacred code. Choosing to go to hell was the defining moment of his life. He is responsible for what happens now, and he will have to live with the consequences for all eternity. Filled with remorse, Rafe finally admits that he was wrong to put his desire to fight vampire before Alison. He was sent back to earth specifically to be with her, and that's exactly what he will do if he gets another chance. Amused by the imminent consequences of Rafe's actions, the speaker sends him back home. Overjoyed to be home at last, Rafe waits for Alison and vows not to fight Caleb anymore.

She wishes for him to feel the kind of passion he's only dreamed of. She wants this to be a night of intense love that Caleb will never forget, and she wants him to always know that she is the one who made it happen.
