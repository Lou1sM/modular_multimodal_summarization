When Jamal insists on knowing what's really going on, Imani says that her obsessive stalker is the one who killed her professor. Since the man is a cop, he managed to implicate her in the crime, and now he's free to hunt her like an animal. Jamal agrees to let her leave but states that he's going with her. When his back is turned, she takes off without a word. Meanwhile, the man who is after Imani refuses to give up on finding her. Alison tries to tell Rafe about what happened at the barn, but he is determined to put his slaying days behind him forever and forget that Caleb even exists. From now on, his only mission in life is to make sure that Alison is happy. Rafe and Alison are both ready to erase the past and start fresh. Alison stops before letting him make love to her, asking him to hold her instead. Pointing to her hand, she expresses the desire to get married as soon as possible, and Rafe has no problem with that. After Olivia claims that she would never hurt Caleb, he demands the immediate return of his ring. When she asks how he spent the night, Caleb taunts her with the idea that he was with Alison. He retracts this when she begs him to say it's not true, and Olivia swears that she's learned her lesson. After making love to Caleb, Olivia is stunned by his order to get out. Although she screams and clings to him, Caleb pushes her out and then closes the door in her face."
