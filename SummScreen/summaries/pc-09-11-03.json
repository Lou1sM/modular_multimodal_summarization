Olivia ducks out of sight so that Jack can answer the door. Filling Jack in on the situation with Imani, Jamal urges him to pack a bag and help him find her. Jack is prepared to go until Olivia returns and begs him not to leave her. Jack assures Jamal that it's not what it looks like, and he fully intends to help look for Imani. When Jamal refers to Olivia as \"psycho,\" she advises him to take a good look at Imani before tossing that word around. Seeing that Jack is prepared to leave her there alone, she decides to accompany the guys in their search, but Jamal would rather do this alone than have her along. After he leaves, Olivia reluctantly fills a skeptical Jack in on her strange encounter with Imani. Meanwhile, at a diner, Imani rejects a potential suitor and calls Jamal, but she can't bring herself to speak. Convinced that it was Imani who called, Jamal thinks hard about where she could be, and he decides to start with her grandmother in Alabama. After leaving Kevin, Lucy runs into Chris, who is frantically looking for Ian. When Chris explains that Ian took a super dose of the serum, Lucy tries to blame him for this, but Chris informs her that she is the reason her lover stole the serum. A crazed Ian confronts Kevin at the hospital. After alternating between uncontrolled rage and tearful pleas for help, he gives in to his dark side. As Ian bares his fangs to kill his wheelchair-bound rival, Kevin throws a pot of hot coffee on him. Lucy arrives just as Ian prepares to smash a chair down on his enemy. While she distracts him and tries to talk him down, Chris manages to jab a needle into the raging vampire's neck."
