After she admits to wishing that he no longer hated her, Jack tells her that she left him defenseless, because his hatred of her was the only thing standing in the way of his love for her. A crazed look on his face, Jack chases Olivia around the room, proclaiming his undying love and devotion. He smothers her face with kisses and asks her to marry him and have his babies. Scared, Olivia runs to the door, only to learn that Jack was teasing her. Unamused, she leaves Jack laughing about his little joke. Alison demands that Caleb somehow undo what they did at the barn, but Caleb informs her that he can't change the past. Caleb realizes that she still hasn't told Rafe the truth. Alison feels that she's in a no-win situation, since she can neither tell Rafe the truth nor keep it from him. Caleb understands that she's being tormented for something that isn't her fault; they are both paying the price for their lovers' obsessions. When he accuses Alison of having the hots for him, she slaps him hard. Caleb says that he is moving on, and he advises her to do the same. Alison vows to live happily ever after with Rafe. After she storms out, Caleb lingers at the door, confident that he's right about her feelings. When there's a knock at the door, he assumes that Alison has returned, but it's Olivia. Confused by Alison's behavior, Rafe comes home to an empty apartment and is soon joined by Elizabeth, who realizes that something is wrong.
