    "tvmega_recap": "After Jamal tracks down Imani's grandmother's restaurant in Silverhill, Alabama, he leaves a partial message for Jack before losing the signal on his cell phone. Recognizing the woman from the photo Imani showed him, he places an order and tries to establish a rapport so that he can get some information. After all his questions about family arouse her suspicions, she drugs his food. When he passes out, she confiscates his phone, draws the shade, and calls someone to take out the \"trash.\" Elizabeth tracks down Chris at the hospital for a nice surprise, but he is tired of her bothering him at work all the time. He goes to Ian's room, where Lucy again states that this is all his fault. Chris refuses to take the blame for any of this, because he shouldn't have had to play babysitter while Ian stole the serum and then went after Kevin. He blames Lucy, since Ian did this to try to live a normal life for her. After waking up in restraints, Ian is relieved to hear that Kevin is all right. Although Lucy accuses him of having gone too far this time, Ian intends to keep doing it until they find a cure. Chris informs him that it's over; he destroyed the rest of the formula and all the research. Furious, Ian says that he had no right, but Lucy tells her lover that he had no right to put everyone through hell. Ian still intends to continue, at least to find a way to control his dark side. He asks her not to stop him from leaving. After Chris was so mean to her, Elizabeth cancels the dinner reservations she had made as a surprise. Chris overhears and tries to apologize. Elizabeth informs him that she had noticed his anxiety about Ian and thought a nice dinner would cheer him up. His attempts to apologize don't quite placate her, but she agrees to go to dinner anyway--as long as he pays. Meanwhile, Caleb isn't pleased to see Olivia. Telling him that she came by to pick up a few of her things, she removes her coat and states that she has nothing to wear. Caleb appreciates her beauty but orders her to get out. Olivia responds by trying to seduce him. As they kiss, Caleb makes it a point to note that she hasn't stolen his ring again. Accusing him of being unable to forgive one mistake, she tells him to use the ring to wish that she had never stolen it from him. Caleb laughs, amused by the similarity to Alison's request. Olivia still wants to get him into bed, but Caleb points out that it wouldn't make a difference, because he still wouldn't be able to believe a word she says. Olivia refuses to ever let him go. She leaves, confident that he will never be free of her. Caleb is equally confident that she's fooling herself."
