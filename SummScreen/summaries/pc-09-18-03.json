When Ian tries to apologize for the attack, Kevin kindly tells him to forget about it. Ian says his goodbyes to Lucy and Danny. Kevin's offer to order dinner for the kids further upsets Lucy, who doesn't consider him part of her family anymore. Casey convinces Ricky that she is real and that he's been conjuring up a nasty version of her. She wants him to straighten up and let go of the past, because she can't come back to him anymore. Casey assures Ricky that he will find love again, and she wants that for him--just not with Reese. After a goodbye kiss, Casey returns to heaven. Ricky tries to let go of the past and accept things as they are. After some initial hesitation, Olivia accepts Jack's invitation to the opening of a photo gallery tonight. While Jack takes off to run some errands, Olivia is approached by Caleb, who was looking for her."
