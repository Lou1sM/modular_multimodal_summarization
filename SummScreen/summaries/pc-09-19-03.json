Madea strongly advises Imani to reconsider her decision to let Jamal stay, saying that he is a distraction that could prove dangerous if Imani lets her guard down. She also points out that Imani may pose a danger to the man if he is truly on her side. Jamal realizes that Imani is having second thoughts about having him around, but he assures her that absolutely no one knows where he is. Back in Port Charles, the sheriff who has been tracking Imani stands outside the Elixir. Unbeknownst to Rafe, Alison arranges pre-wedding counseling for them both with a minister. In her counseling session, Alison acknowledges her fear of losing Rafe because of her actions. When she asks why God let this happen if she and Rafe are meant for each other, the minister advises her to learn and become stronger from this particular test. Rafe admits to often placing more importance on his work than on the woman he loves. He also admits to never feeling worthy of Alison's love, but he promises to work on that. After their individual sessions, the minister sees them together, and she states her belief that God had a hand in bringing them together. She counsels them to learn to forgive themselves and each other if they want their relationship to last. Alison and Rafe return home, confident that everything will be all right. Although Olivia has a date with Jack, Caleb refuses to let her go. Claiming to be embarrassed about kicking her out, he tells her that being apart simply doesn't make sense. Taking Olivia back to the loft, Caleb goes to bed with her while thinking about his own agenda of revenge against her, Rafe, and Alison."
