    "tvdb": "Livvie proclaims Caleb dead and explains away her evil deeds as a way to get close to him and destroy him. Everyone seems skeptical until Lucy enters, saying Livvie saved her life and helped her fake her death. Caleb's youthful body turns into an old man and everyone's free from the steel walls Caleb used to trap them. A rapidly aging Karen lies to Frank that she has a \"\"bug\"\" and leaves with Chris. The men bury Caleb's body in the woods, and when the sun rises, everyone's in awe at the sight of the miracle. With Caleb destroyed, Ed gives Rafe a new mission- reunite all the couples Caleb broke up by Christmas Eve."
