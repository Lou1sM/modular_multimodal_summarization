When they found her under a pile of debris, they noticed a substantial cut on her head. Joe and Gabriela managed her wound and Jamal was relieved to see that she was ok when she asked if her cut would leave a scar because she didn't want to have to wear bangs.\n\n\nAt first, Lucy's main concern was Livvie because she didn't know that she had left the  party much earlier. Lucy was relieved when Kevin gave her the news.\n\n\nJoe had recognized Ian's car as the source of the explosion. Lucy struggled with the knowledge that Eve and Ian were outside the Recovery Room when the explosion went off. She didn't want to worry Kevin if there was nothing to be concerned about, but he overheard her telling someone else. He didn't believe that that could be a possibility because he knew that Eve had been on the way to the hospital. He wouldn't even accept that it was Ian's car outside because he knew that Ian was supposed to have left town earlier.\n\n\nLivvie remembered that Estelle had no idea what had happened to Rachel, so Jack took her over to see her.

In the process they discovered that Alison's health insurance had been cancelled. Gabriela came over and took care of the situation, but it didn't calm Jamal down that much.\n\n\nKevin and Lucy went to the hospital to look for Eve. They only found disappointment though when one of the nurses told them that they had called Eve to come in but she had never made it. When they arrived back at the scene of the explosion, Mac was trying to investigate. Kevin was beginning to realize that Eve could have been in the car when Mac admitted that they had found Eve's wedding ring in the car.\n\n\nBack at the hotel, Livvie started to ask Jack questions about why he had come to Port Charles. He started to tell her that there is only one thing that she needs to know about him, but quieted the conversation with a  kiss instead.\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, out in the parking lot, a vehicle fills with flames in the wake of the bombing. Jamal panics to find a groggy Alison lying beneath the overturned pinball table but Mary assures the young man that his girlfriend has only suffered some cuts and bruises. Fearing the worst when Joe reports that Dr. Thornheart's car is on fire, Lucy hesitantly reveals to Kevin how she spotted Ian and Eve talking outside the Recovery Room just seconds before the explosion. Jack offers to take a grateful Livvie to visit her grandmother. Unwilling to believe Lucy's tale, Kevin rushes to the hospital to search for his wife. Livvie explains to a confused Estelle why Rachel had to go away for some badly needed \"\"rest\"\". Later, Livvie watches admiringly as Jack easily manages to soothe her grandmother.
