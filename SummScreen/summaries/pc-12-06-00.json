Then, Lucy broke down saying that she just\ncouldn't believe that Ian and Eve were dead. Just as the words \"Eve is dead\" came out,\nSerena walked in the door.\n\n\nLivvie went to see Kevin. Once she got there, all she could say was how sorry she was.\nKevin started to tell Livvie how much she would've liked Eve if she had gotten to know\nher better. Eventually, Livvie was ready to leave because she couldn't come up with any\nwords to soothe Kevin's pain. When she prepared to go, Kevin stopped her and asked her\nto stay.\n\n\nEve and Ian woke up in their dungeon-like surroundings and managed to untie their hands.\nBefore they had a chance to try for an escape, their captor showed up with his goons to\nsay hello. When Ian tried to attack them, he was knocked out almost instantly and they\nleft. \n\n\nScott and Lucy did their best to break the news to Serena gently. After a bit of sadness,\nSerena's first concern was for Kevin. She asked if they could stop at the firehouse on their\nway to go see him and Lucy and Scott agreed.\n\n\nJoe and Gabriela tried to comprehend the loss of two friends. Gabriela expressed how the\nevent made her feel that she hadn't really grown up yet. She was remembering how in love\nEve had been with Kevin and was grateful that Eve had had that opportunity. Gabriela\nsaid how she wished that Ian had had the same chance...Joe admitted that he thinks that\nIan had found someone, but he wouldn't tell Gabriela who it was. \n\n\nWhen Ian awoke, Eve drilled him with questions about the man in charge of their\nabduction. Ian said that his name was Harris and that he thought that he had killed him\nyears ago. Apparently, Harris was a businessman who got in the way of a shipment of\ncures for a virus that was on its way to a village that Ian was working in. Ian was\ndevastated that he had promised a bunch of children that they would get better, but\ncouldn't make it happen, because of Harris.\n\n\nKevin was happy to see Serena, Lucy and Scott. Scott made an attempt to express his\nsympathy to Kevin and told Livvie that he was glad she was with Kevin. Serena gave\nKevin the stuffed elephant that Eve had given her back when she was blind. She said that\nall Kevin needs to do is hug the elephant and Eve would appear in his dreams.\n\n\nGabriela told Joe that the accident had made her realize something else..that she didn't\nwant to waste anymore time. Again, she told him how much she wanted to make love and\nJoe still said that there was too much of a risk. With pleading, Joe admitted that he had\nthought about it though and eventually he gave in and they started to make plans.\n\n\nHarris returned and Ian asked him to get right down to what he wanted. Harris said that\nsince Ian had tried to take his life, he was going to pay for it with human life. Ian assumed\nthat Harris was referring to Eve and tried to jump Harris, but the guards put a quick stop\nto that and took Ian from the room. Eve begged Harris not to hurt Ian. Harris seemed to\nto enjoy her pleading and said that he would be back for more.\n\n",
