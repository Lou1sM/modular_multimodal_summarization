    "tvdb": "Rafe helps a bitter woman realize her love for her husband, then asks Victor for advice about his growing feelings toward Alison.  Victor advises him not to break up her relationship if he's not going to stay in town.  Jack and Livvie offer to rent the abandoned house from its owner, but he refuses because he's selling it.  However, his wife (the woman Rafe helped) convinces him to let Jack and Livvie have the house.  Jamal gets jealous when he learns Ali's been spending time with Rafe.  After learning the Hartmans' whereabouts, Jamal tells Valerie he's going to give up his parental rights.  Val blames Ali and, after they argue, Jamal tells Ali to leave so he can talk to Val alone.  Ali goes to Rafe, but he abruptly shoos her away.  Frank tells a dying Karen that Chris refuses to help her.  Chris shows up and gives Karen a temporary anecdocte to the vampire serum, but tells Frank his price for more of the anecdote- Frank must stay away from Karen."
