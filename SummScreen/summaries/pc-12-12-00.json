However,\n\nChris was not as happy as a long lost brother should have been. In an effort to impress\n\nLivvie, he invited Jack over to his place to catch up.\n\n\n\nLucy found Kevin in the burning lighthouse and used all her power to wake him up. When\n\nhe did wake up, he was in such a rotten state of mind that he just sat around with the fire\n\nin front of him and didn't want to leave. Lucy tried to persuade him that life was still\n\nworth living, but it wasn't until Lucy said that if he wouldn't leave, neither would she, that\n\nKevin came to his sense and got both of them out.\n\n\nWhen Eve asked Ian what had been so important before the explosion, he lied and said\n\nthat he had only wanted to give her a disk with Rachel's formula's on it. Eve bought the\n\nstory and was furious that Ian had thought that that was a big deal. She wanted to blame\n\nhim for putting her in the wrong place at the time they were kidnapped, but Ian wasn't\n\nhaving it. Ian pointed the finger in Eve's direction by saying that he was trying to leave her\n\nalone, but she was the one who came out of the Recovery Room and stopped him. Ian\n\nexplained how he wished that she wouldn't have come out and how it's drives him crazy\n\nthat it's his fault that she is stuck with him wherever they are.\n\n\nAlison and Livvie bonded over their encounters with Jack. Livvie told Alison all about the\n\nfirst time she met Jack and how he makes her feel. She also let Alison in on how Jack and\n\nChris are brothers and she is torn because they aren't getting along. Alison was intrigued\n\nby the stories of her mysterious Chandler and advised Livvie to take a break from the\n\ndynamic duo to clear her head and decide what she wants to do next.\n\n\nChris and Jack started to discuss their situation. Still, Chris thought that Jack only wanted\n\nto get something from him. Jack told Chris that their mother's dying wish was that he find\n\nhis older brother. Chris was upset that they hadn't tried to find him when his mother was\n\nalive, but Jack explained that they didn't have enough money to handle that sort of search.\n\nChris offered Jack money to leave Port Charles. Jack refused the money and left Chris'\n\napartment, but said that he had no intentions of leaving PC. Later, Chris made a phone call\n\nto someone and explained that he had a problem from his past that he needed to remove as\n\nsoon as possible.\n\n\nKevin was at Johnny La La's remembering he and Eve's good times there. He was\n\ndrinking again and seeing visions of Eve singing to him on stage when Lucy came in. Lucy\n\ndid her best to control the drunken, mourning Kevin, but he wasn't having it. He insisted\n\nthat she dance with him so she complied. Then, Kevin started to remember what he and\n\nLucy had together years ago. Lucy managed to pry herself away and decided to take\n\nKevin home for some food and rest.\n\n\nHarris came in to pay Ian and Eve a visit. Eve took it upon herself to tell Harris that if he\n\nexpected them to get any work done, he should improve the conditions they are working\n\nunder by possibly getting them two beds. Then, Harris startled Ian and Eve by expressing\n\nhis surprise that a whore was requesting separate beds. Ian blew up at the accusation and\n\ntook Harris by the neck. Eve tried to calm him by telling him that Harris was telling the\n\ntruth, but Ian didn't back off that easy. Ian threatened Harris by letting him know that if he\n\ndidn't stop speaking to Eve that way, he would make sure he was dead. When Harris left,\n\nEve told Ian that she could tell from the look in his eyes that Harris is going to find a way\n\nto get what he wants....her. \n\n\nBack at Lucy's suite, Kevin again insisted that they dance. Lucy went along with him\n\nagain, but Kevin was even worse. He asked Lucy to remember how good they were\n\ntogether. When Kevin stumbled and fell back on the bed with Lucy on top of him, Lucy\n\nused all her will power to stop Kevin from kissing her, but did not succeed. \n\n\n",
