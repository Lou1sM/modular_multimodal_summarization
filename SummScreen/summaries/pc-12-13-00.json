She was\n\nso excited that she took a quick break to go celebrate with him in the bedroom.\n\nAfterwards, Jamal received a phone call where he told the caller that he didn't want them\n\ncalling because he didn't want Alison to know what he was doing.\n\n\nLivvie was furious at Kevin when she caught him trying to kiss Lucy. After making sure\n\nthat Lucy was alright, Livvie waited for an explanation from Kevin. Livvie was disgusted\n\nto learn that Kevin was drunk, but Lucy defended the situation to the best of her ability.\n\nThen, Kevin decided to speak for himself. He told Livvie that it was about time she realize\n\nthat he's just a man and that he doesn't have the answers anymore. Livvie was not swayed\n\nso she left Lucy and Kevin alone together.\n\n\nJoe told Gabriela that he wouldn't be able to make a weekend getaway. Gabriela was\n\ndisappointed, but came up with another solution - a night at her apartment - Joe agreed.\n\n\nLivvie ran into Victor who was very happy to see his granddaughter. Livvie wasn't so\n\nthrilled thought. She told Victor that she wasn't sure that she wanted to be a part of the\n\nCollins family anymore. Livvie explained that she didn't think that she could handle having\n\ntwo crazy relatives. She told Victor about the state Kevin was in when she saw him.\n\nVictor defended Kevin by saying that he is flawed just like everyone else, but Livvie was\n\nstill wishing that she had one person in her life that wasn't.\n\n\nEve and Ian were hard at work on a cure for Harris' disease. They did seem to come up\n\nwith something that was making progress, but decided that they would have to do some\n\nmore tests before they could be sure. At this point, they decided to take a break and Ian\n\ngave Eve the massage of a lifetime. Eve started to ask Ian to tell her more about himself\n\nso he started to share the things he enjoys most in life. When things started to get a\n\nlittle too close, Ian stopped and told Eve to take a nap while he went back to work.\n\n\nLucy tried to give Kevin advice that he had once given her - get a grip. Kevin said that he\n\nwas torn because he wanted to mourn his wife, but he was too angry because of the note\n\nthat he found at Ian's. Lucy tried to tell Kevin that Eve loved him and only him, but he\n\nwouldn't agree. Then, Lucy started to agree with him and told Kevin how she thought that\n\nEve was a horrible person. That was all it took to turn Kevin around. He immediately\n\nstarted to defend Eve and tell Lucy what a wonderful woman she was. Lucy was glad to\n\nsee that Kevin had changed his tone and told him that he needed to fight for Eve's\n\nmemory.\n\n\nSomeone had a dream about Eve and Ian making love, but this time it wasn't Ian, it was\n\nEve. She awoke yelling for Ian who came running in to comfort her after her \"bad dream\".\n\n\n",
