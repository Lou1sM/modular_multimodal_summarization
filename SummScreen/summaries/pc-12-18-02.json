She's surprised when Kevin doesn't seem remorseful and vows to do whatever he has to do to fight for their marriage.  Stephen tells a horrified Elizabeth that even though she's a vampire, she can lead a normal life due to his liquid.  He also claims he is no longer Caleb the vampire who once terrorized the town and tells her he loves her (even though he secretly thinks of Livvie).  Rafe asks Livvie to team up with him to destroy Caleb, but when she declines, he accuses her of wanting Caleb back.  Ricky gives Rafe some of Stephen's \"\"water.\"\""
