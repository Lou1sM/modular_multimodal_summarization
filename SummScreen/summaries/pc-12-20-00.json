Meanwhile, Livvie makes it clear to Jack how much she wants him to make love to her. A flustered Lucy asks Kevin how he can possibly think of leaving Port Charles now that he knows he has a daughter. Eve steps out of her bath to find Ian staring at her. When Harris returns to claim his \"prize\", Eve covers by assuring a worried Ian that she's only going out to explain the next medical procedure to their captor. Kevin is forced to bodily remove Lucy from the lighthouse but she stubbornly refuses to let go of his arm. Chris interrupts a moment of passion between Jack and Livvie. Kevin admits to Lucy how tempted he is to lose himself in her but must resist before he ruins her life as well. Chris informs a surprised Livvie that there is a warrant out for Jack's arrest because he broke probation following a conviction for grand larceny. As Harris begins pawing Eve, Ian barges in and claims he needs his lab partner back at once because he's close to locating a cure. Lucy manages to talk Kevin into sticking around long enough to celebrate the holidays with family and friends. Chris warns Jack he won't let him exploit Livvie for his own twisted devices. Eve lets it slip to Ian how she made a deal with the devil. \n\n\n",
