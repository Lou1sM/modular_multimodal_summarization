        "Rose: These \r\nthings used to belong to me. This was my place, Rosie\u2019s Roller Palace. We \r\ncatered to an upscale crowd -- which means the tips were lousy, the customers \r\nwere a pain in the butt, and every so often one of 'em would get busted for tax \r\nevasion. Or murder. But the gossip was great. All in all, I did okay for a girl \r\nfrom A.C. This is where I used to live. And, no, the decor is not done to my \r\ntaste. It's a long story. Let's just say this place used to belong to my grandpa \r\nCal. Like these high heels used to belong to Cher. I swear to God -- I stole 'em \r\nfrom her hotel room at a famous casino that shall remain nameless. Hey, I'm a \r\ndomestic goddess, what can I tell ya? And this is where I live now. In a \r\ncemetery in New Jersey next to my mom. That's my pop, by the way. I shouldn't be \r\nhere, not yet. I had years left -- places I\u2019d never seen, babies I never had, a \r\nhusband I never -- more on him later. Just know -- I'm not gonna rest till I \r\nfigure out who put me here. And when I do? Watch out. Was it Paul? My fianc\u00e9? \r\nWho cursed me at the altar on my wedding day? You think you're sufferin' now, \r\nPaul -- just wait. Or was it Dusty? My lover -- jealous 'cause I was gonna marry \r\nPaul. What did you expect, carryin' on with Molly? That I would put up with \r\nthat? Speak of the devil -- there she is. Right next to Dusty, as usual. Was it \r\nyou, Molly? Did you put that poison in my champagne? Worse luck for you, 'cause \r\nDusty is never gonna get over me. Now this one really bothers me. Mitzi. My \r\nso-called best friend. I trusted you. I gave you a job. I brought you into my \r\nhome. I didn't expect perfect, but to rip me off! You shoulda just asked me. I \r\nwoulda given you anything. And I never woulda called the cops. But you had no \r\nfaith, did ya? Here we go. My favorite. Barbara. My future mother-in-law. \r\nWouldn't be the first time you tried to nix me and Paul. Did you poison me, \r\nBarb? 'Cause I wasn't good enough for your son? Not talkin'? Ooh, that's a \r\nfirst. Get outta here. All of you's -- listen up. This is a warning. Nobody \r\nmurders Rose D'Angelo and gets away with it. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Tell me \r\nyou figured this out. ",
        "Hal: Who killed \r\nRose? Not yet. But I will. ",
        "",
        "Holden: So \r\nLily's okay? She can go home? ",
        "Bob: The \r\nhypothermia was mild, her vitals are back to normal -- we'll release her later \r\ntoday. ",
        "Holden: Thanks, \r\nBob. ",
        "",
        "Mitzi: Mr. \r\nSnyder? Your wife called -- left me a message saying she wanted to see me?\r\n",
        "Holden: Well, \r\ngo on in. ",
        "Mitzi: So she's \r\nokay? ",
        "Holden: Just go \r\nsee what she wants. ",
        "Hal: What about \r\nMitzi Matters? Mitzi stole money from Rose's business. Rose found out about it, \r\nkicked Mitzi out of the wedding party and threatened to go to the police. Where \r\nI come from, we call that motive. ",
        "Jack: There's \r\none thing about Mitzi, Hal -- ",
        "Hal: What?\r\n",
        "Jack: She -- \r\nshe's a sweet girl. ",
        "Hal: Hmm -- \r\nMitzi high-tailed it back to Atlantic City and then sneaked back into town on \r\nthe day of the wedding -- ",
        "Jack: We don't \r\nknow that for a fact. ",
        "Hal: She had \r\nmotive, she had opportunity, and poison is a woman's game, Jack. You know that \r\nas well as I do. ",
        "",
        "Mitzi: I'm on \r\nthe board as a suspect -- it just makes me sick to my stomach, that they could \r\nthink that. ",
        "Lily: I don't \r\nthink that. And I don't want you to worry. That's why I called you. I'd like you \r\nto take your things from the hotel and move back into Cal\u2019s. 'Cause Rose thought \r\nof you as family. And family takes care of family. Look at me. It's okay. Look, \r\nlook. You're going to help me make sure that Rose isn't forgotten. ",
        "Holden: \r\nEverything okay in here? ",
        "Lily: Yeah. \r\nEverything's okay. Look, don't let anything happen to Rose's things. Promise me.\r\n",
        "Holden: Lily, \r\nyou need to try and get some rest. ",
        "Mitzi: Yeah. \r\nWhatever Lily wants. ",
        "Lily: Holden, \r\ncould you help Mitzi move her things back to Cal\u2019s? ",
        "Holden: Yeah. \r\nSure thing. ",
        "Mitzi: You two \r\n-- I'm never gonna forget how kind you are. You're the greatest. ",
        "Mitzi: That \r\nwent better than I thought. ",
        "",
        "Hal: You know, \r\nmaybe your wife was onto something when she said you had a thing for Mitzi.\r\n",
        "Jack: Oh, come \r\non, I did not have a thing for Mitzi! She's a friend, Hal, and nothing more. And \r\nI can tell you this. She didn't kill Rose. She doesn't have it in her. \r\n",
        "Hal: Uh-huh? \r\nAnd since you've known her, has she ever paid her own way? She stayed with \r\nLucinda, she stayed with you, and she stayed with Rose. And when she wore out \r\nher welcome, she even hit you up for a ticket outta town. She's an opportunist, \r\nJack. People like her do whatever it takes to survive. ",
        "",
        "Mitzi: Those \r\nare Rose's things? ",
        "Holden: A man \r\nfrom the church is comin' by. He's gonna pick all this stuff up and take it over \r\nto the thrift shop. Make sure he takes everything. ",
        "Lily: Don't let \r\nanything happen to rose's things. Promise me. ",
        "Holden: Mitzi? \r\nDid you hear me? It's important. I want all this stuff gone before Lily comes \r\nhome. ",
        "Mitzi: Yeah, I \r\nheard you. But I wasn't listening. ",
        "",
        "Hal: I know you \r\nlike her, Jack. But this woman is a real operator. Now if we find her anywhere \r\nnear the scene, I'm gonna pick her up, friend or no friend. ",
        "Jack: Be my \r\nguest. But explain this. In Atlantic City, when Lily was dressed as Rose, Mitzi \r\nbought it. Now, if Mitzi thought she'd killed Rose -- ",
        "Hal: Maybe she \r\nthought she failed. Maybe she was gonna try again. Maybe she would've tried \r\nagain if the sheriff's department hadn't picked her up. ",
        "Jack: You're \r\noverthinkin' it, Hal. ",
        "Hal: And you're \r\nletting your logic get clouded by your feelings for this woman. ",
        "Jack: I'll \r\nremind you of that when we get to Barbara. Yeah. ",
        "Hal: How's \r\nLily? ",
        "Jack: She's \r\nokay -- physically. And luckily, the kids are at Emma\u2019s. But Holden\u2019s scared \r\nshe'll never be able to move on. I mean -- if she tried to kill herself --\r\n",
        "Hal: Well, at \r\nleast somebody got to her in time. ",
        "Jack: I guess \r\nDusty Donovan\u2019s good for something. ",
        "Hal: Dusty \r\nDonovan, now there's a walking contradiction. Lily's hero -- Rose's on-again, \r\noff-again lover -- ",
        "Jack: And if \r\nyou think Mitzi had motive, if you think she had an agenda, this guy -- this guy \r\ncame to town solely to break up Rose and Paul\u2019s relationship. He was paid for \r\nit, Hal. And then he had the nerve to claim he had feelings for her. ",
        "Hal: Did he \r\nlove her? Did he hate her? ",
        "Jack: Did he \r\nkill her? ",
        "Hal: The \r\nquestion is just how bad he is. I mean, we know he'll break the law for a buck. \r\nWe know he's connected. But is he a cold-blooded killer? ",
        "Jack: Dusty? I \r\ndon't know. If he's angry enough, hurt enough -- ",
        "Hal: But this \r\nis poison, remember, Jack? It takes planning, procuring, hiding. There's lots of \r\ntime to change your mind. Whoever put the poison in Rose's glass was clever, \r\ncalm, controlled -- ",
        "Jack: There's \r\nhis best friend. ",
        "Hal: Molly?\r\n",
        "Jack: She's all \r\nof the above and very angry. ",
        "",
        "Molly: R.D.?\r\n",
        "Dusty: Rose \r\ngave 'em to me. ",
        "Molly: This is \r\na first. I'm usually rippin' your clothes off; not helping you put 'em on. So \r\nwhere're you going? Big date? ",
        "Dusty: No, I'm \r\ngoing to the hospital. To see Lily. ",
        "Molly: Don't \r\nyou think you should call Holden first? ",
        "Dusty: I don't \r\nneed permission. ",
        "Jack: Molly \r\nplanted evidence on Dusty -- ",
        "Hal: Yeah, \r\nwhich is a cryin' shame 'cause it only gonna make him look innocent. ",
        "Jack: Innocent? \r\nHell, Hal, he looks like a hero. He's all over the papers. Dusty Donovan saves \r\nthe life of one of Oakdale\u2019s best-loved citizens. ",
        "Hal: And you \r\nknow he's gonna play it to the hilt. ",
        "",
        "Dusty: It's \r\ngood to see you on dry land. How're you feelin'? ",
        "Lily: Holden's \r\ngetting the discharge papers. ",
        "Dusty: Good. \r\nI'm sure your family misses you. ",
        "Lily: Look, I \r\nknow I should be grateful to you right now. But I'm not really up for it. \r\n",
        "Dusty: I don't \r\nwant you to thank me. ",
        "Lily: Then why \r\nare you here? ",
        "Dusty: I wanna \r\nmake sure you're okay. ",
        "",
        "Molly: Lily \r\nlooks like Rose. That's what this is all about. And you should've seen him, \r\nCraig. He's all slicked up in a new suit. He had on the cufflinks that Rose gave \r\nhim, for cryin' out loud. Like he knows, in his head he thinks that he's going \r\non a date with a dead woman. And that is just sick. ",
        "Craig: Molly, \r\nwhy don't you drown your sorrows in something a little cheaper? ",
        "Molly: Rose is \r\ngone. She's finally gone. And, yes, I wanted her gone. No, I didn't want her \r\ndead. But I wanted her gone, and she's finally gone -- right? Only she's not. \r\nBecause Dusty has this all-new fixation, and this one's safe. It's right up his \r\nalley. Because it's a woman he can love from now to next Christmas, and she's \r\nnot gonna want a thing from him. ",
        "Craig: Molly, \r\nMolly, you're a smart, attractive, rich woman. Why are you wasting your time on \r\nsomeone -- ",
        "Molly: That's \r\nin love with a dead woman? It's pathetic. Right? I know. And I've tried \r\neverything. Everything from 25-year-old scotch to 25-year-old yoga instructors. \r\nNothing works. It's not funny. Because God help me, Craig, but I love him.\r\n",
        "Craig: You love \r\nhim? So you framed him for murder? What are you going to give him for \r\nValentine\u2019s Day? A guillotine? ",
        "",
        "Dusty: You \r\nnever have to be Rose because you already have so much of her inside you. You're \r\nboth smart, loving, stubborn women. ",
        "Lily: Only \r\nshe's dead. When I was under the water -- and I saw her face. She was so close.\r\n",
        "Dusty: The way \r\nyou get close to Rose is by doin' what she wants. Right now she wants us to find \r\nthe killer and bring him to justice. ",
        "Holden: The \r\npolice are going to find out who did it. And right now Lily needs to get home to \r\nher family. But thanks for stoppin' by, Dusty. I'll give you a call. I'll let \r\nyou know how Lily's doing. ",
        "Mitzi: I found \r\nsome of that tea you like in the cabinet. ",
        "Holden: Lily, \r\nthe kids are expecting you home. ",
        "Lily: I'll be \r\nthere later. ",
        "Holden: Well, \r\ncan I tell them you'll be there for dinner? ",
        "Lily: I'll be \r\nthere for dinner. ",
        "Holden: Did \r\nthey pick up those boxes? ",
        "Mitzi: Yeah, \r\nthe guy came by. ",
        "Holden: Good. \r\nDo me a favor. Just keep an eye on her. I need to go over to my mother's and \r\npick up the kids. If she starts acting weird again, gimme a call. ",
        "Mitzi: Sure \r\nthing, no problem. We'll just have a cup of tea. ",
        "Lily: Is he \r\ngone? ",
        "Mitzi: He went \r\nto pick up the kids. ",
        "Lily: What was \r\nhe saying by the door? ",
        "Mitzi: Just \r\nthat -- to tell you the truth, Lil, when I got here? He'd packed up all of \r\nRose's stuff. He was trying to send it to the church. ",
        "Lily: No! He \r\ncan't -- ",
        "Mitzi: No, no, \r\ndon't worry about it. Don't worry about it. I unpacked everything, and I hid it \r\nall in my room. So you can look at Rose's things anytime you want. ",
        "",
        "Jack: Donovan's \r\npersistent, I'll give him that. For weeks he wouldn't stop yappin' about \r\nsomething terrible happening to Rose. And lo and behold, he was right. Something \r\nterrible happened. Now what're the odds of that? ",
        "Hal: Slim to \r\nnone. ",
        "Jack: He had \r\nmotive. ",

        "Jack: Did \r\nanything come up from that search of his room other than what Molly wanted us to \r\nfind? ",
        "Hal: I'll go \r\nover the list again, but I doubt it. ",
        "Jack: Maybe \r\nhe's right. If he's innocent, maybe he's right about who killed her. ",

        "Lily: You \r\nshouldn't be here. If Holden finds out -- ",
        "Dusty: If you \r\nreally cared what Holden thought, you wouldn't be here. And I like Holden, you \r\nknow that. He just doesn't understand. You and I are the only ones who can do \r\nwhat needs doing here. ",
        "Lily: The \r\npolice will figure out what happened to -- ",
        "Dusty: No, we \r\nknow who killed her. Don't we? He met her at the altar, and he poisoned her --\r\n",
        "Lily: I just \r\ncan't hear it. I really can't listen to -- ",
        "Dusty: You \r\ncan't hear it? What are you gonna do, hide out in this house and hope it goes \r\naway? Your sister was murdered. And it was our fault! ",
        "Lily: Don't say \r\nthat -- ",
        "Dusty: Yes, it \r\nwas! We failed to protect her, don't you see that? As much as we loved her, we \r\ndidn't keep her safe. And we owe it to her -- we owe it to her to make Paul Ryan \r\npay. ",

        "Paul: But \r\nbefore they got there, you found something. And you used that something to try \r\nand set me up. Mother, please, just tell me the truth, finally. You killed the \r\nonly woman I ever loved. You did it. You poisoned Rose. ",

        "Jennifer: I \r\nwish I was back in Europe. I know -- I was miserable. But at least everything \r\nthere was fairly simple. Everyone here is pulling me apart. Everybody wants \r\nsomething different -- ",
        "Paul: Everybody \r\nmeaning Barbara. ",
        "Jennifer: Look, \r\nPaul, I know you think you've solved this problem by calling her Barbara and by \r\nhating her, but you haven\u2019t. Mom is -- ",

        "Molly: It's \r\nworse than that. Say he does forgive me, he's gonna have to come visit me at \r\nJoliet. ",

        "Jennifer: No. \r\nNo, but Mom didn't want to take a chance. So she went back to the church, and \r\nshe found the bottle and the glasses, and she hid them. And eventually, she \r\nplanted them in Molly's room. ",
