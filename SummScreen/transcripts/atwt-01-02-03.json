        "Lily: She's sweet.",
        "Luke: Natalie? Hi, Natalie. Do you think she knows I'm her big brother?",
        "Lily: Oh, I don't know. Let's ask her. Let's see. What was that? She \r\nsaid an angel told her, if she had a big brother, say like you, she would always \r\nbe safe, no matter what. Isn't that nice?",
        "Faith: Does she know me?",
        "Lily: I know she's thrilled to have a big sister. Look at how happy she \r\nis. But let's see. What does she say? Yeah. An angel told her, if she has a big \r\nsister like you, she'll never be alone and she'll always have great clothes to \r\nborrow. Right?",
        "Faith: Does she love us?",
        "Lily: She loves us. Are you kidding? Every single one of us. Right? \r\nHey, Aaron, what about you? Don't you have a question for your little sister?",
        "",
        "Alison: Where's Hal?",
        "Emily: He's up with Will, trying to get him to sleep. Poor Will's \r\nscared to death about having to go to the hospital.",
        "Alison: Do you think Hal would mind if I went with you guys? Maybe I \r\ncould help keep Will's mind off things.",
        "Emily: You'd do that?",
        "Alison: Of course.",
        "Emily: Yeah. I think they would both love it if you came along.",
        "Alison: Oh, well, I'd better get moving.",
        "Emily: Where to?",
        "Alison: I'm going to the hospital to meet \r\nMom. And I want to get there \r\nearly so I can see Lucy.",
        "Emily: How's she doing?",
        "Alison: Aaron says she still doesn't remember me.",
        "Emily: Oh, that poor kid.",
        "Alison: I just wanted to find out for myself.",
        "Emily: Are you sure it's not too late? I don't want you intruding on \r\nfamily time.",
        "Alison: Don't worry. These are my best behavior clothes. I'll see you \r\nlater.",
        "Emily: See you later. Hey, how's Will?",
        "Hal: I haven't had to do so much reassuring since there were monsters \r\nand bogeymen under his bed. At least then I could show him there was no such \r\nthing as monsters and bogeymen. Emily, what do you do when everything a kid is \r\nafraid of is real?",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? Alison said she wants to come with us to \r\nthe hospital to support Will.",
        "Hal: That's great seeing how those two get along. I'm sure he'll feel \r\nbetter knowing that she's there.",
        "[Doorbell rings] I'll get it. Barbara?",
        "Barbara: So you do remember me. When the hell were you planning on \r\nletting me know that you have our son back here, Hal?",
        "",
        "Sierra: Can I get you anything?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Actually, Dr. Harris said maybe that I could get out of bed \r\nand sit in a chair for a while now that I'm out of ICU.",
        "Sierra: Well, he should be here soon. So --",
        "Craig: Hi. Sorry I'm late. Hello, sweetness.",
        "Lucy: Hi, daddy.",
        "Sierra: Where've you been?",
        "Craig: I had some business. Hey. Dr. Harris come by yet?",
        "Lucy: No. The nurses keep saying he's on his way. Then I can finally \r\nsit up like a normal human.",
        "Sierra: Well, don't get your hopes too high. I mean, he did say it all \r\ndepends on your latest MRIs and your x-rays.",

        "Craig: Yeah?",
        "Ben: Hey. Sorry to keep you waiting.",

        "Lucy: Hi, Dr. Harris.",
        "Ben: Hey, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: I was afraid you'd forgotten about me.",
        "Ben: Now, come on, how could I forget my favorite patient? Just give me \r\nfive minutes with your parents, and we'll get you situated.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Sierra: I'll be right back.",
        "Craig: How is she, doc?",
        "Ben: Well, Lucy is responding very well to upper body stimulus. But \r\nbecause of the way her spinal cord was contorted during the accident, there's \r\nmore nerve damage and residual swelling than we had initially thought.",
        "Sierra: What does that mean?",
        "Ben: Well, Lucy -- she can't walk right now, and she probably won't for \r\nquite some time.",

        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: So how's J. J.?",
        "Jack: He's feeling a little cooler.",
        "Carly: Good.",
        "Jack: Remind me to listen to you the next time you tell me don't worry, \r\nit's no big deal, babies get fevers all the time.",
        "Carly: I can do that. It sounds like everybody's sleeping.",
        "Jack: Daddy's magic touch.",
        "Carly: So -- maybe that'll give us some time to talk about what \r\nhappened at the hospital today.",
        "Jack: What's there to talk about? J. J. had a fever, I overreacted, \r\nhe's sleeping peacefully now. End of story. Do you think Parker will notice if I \r\nsteal one of his chocolate Santas?",
        "Carly: Definitely. Get me one, too. We don't have to talk about it. \r\nJack -- do you think maybe you got so mad at John Dixon when he started \r\nquestioning J. J.'s paternity because you're afraid he's right? ",
        "",
        "Barbara: No matter what you may think of me, Hal, I am still Will's \r\nmother. When were you planning on letting me know you were back?",
        "Hal: I was going to call you and tell you that Will and I were back.",
        "Barbara: Thankfully, I ran into Margo. Answer my question. When were \r\nyou going to call me?",
        "Hal: I was going to call you tonight!",
        "Barbara: You know what? I feel like you're denying me access to my son.",
        "Emily: He's sleeping, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I want to see him, Hal.",
        "Hal: Well, like Emily said, he's asleep. And it took me about an hour \r\nof sitting with him and reassuring him to get him that way. And I'm not going to \r\nwake him up for anybody. Besides, I wanted to get him settled before I told you \r\nthe news.",
        "Barbara: What news?",
        "Hal: Maybe you better have a seat.",
        "Barbara: No, no, I'm not sitting down. You tell me what you're talking \r\nabout.",
        "Hal: Will needs to be observed by a court-appointed psychiatrist for 30 \r\ndays.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Hal: We need to take him to Memorial the day after tomorrow to the \r\npsych ward.",
        "Barbara: They're gonna lock him up in that place for a month?! They \r\ncan't do that!",
        "Hal: Barbara, none of us wants it this way.",
        "Barbara: Then you stop it, Hal!",
        "Hal: Barbara, I talked to Tom to see if he could petition the court. He \r\nsays it's out of our hands.",
        "Barbara: Then you find another lawyer. That's our little boy up there! \r\nDo something, Hal!",

        "Craig: Our daughter's a paraplegic?",
        "Ben: As I said before, there's an excellent chance that her nerves will \r\nregenerate. But it is going to take more time than we initially thought.",
        "Alison: Hey. Sorry to bust up the party.",
        "Craig: Not now, Alison. No, not now. Alison, please --",
        "Alison: I'd only be like five minutes.",
        "Sierra: It's fine. It's fine. Just go on in. Go on in. It's fine.",
        "Craig: You were saying?",
        "Ben: Look, I've been over Lucy's films with a fine-tooth comb. I've \r\nconsulted an expert in spinal cord injury, and nobody thinks that her condition \r\nis going to be permanent.",
        "Craig: Thank God.",
        "Sierra: But what does that mean? She'll be in a wheelchair? For how \r\nlong?",
        "Ben: Well, it depends on how she responds to physical therapy. The \r\nmuscles have sort of a built-in memory, so it's important to get them working \r\nagain as soon as possible. Now, I can get a therapist to come to your suite, if \r\nthat's more convenient than bringing Lucy back here to Memorial for her \r\nsessions.",
        "Sierra: No, that really won't be necessary. I am taking Lucy back to \r\nMontega with me as soon as it's safe to move her.",
        "Craig: Is that safe? That can't be safe.",
        "Ben: Well, of course, we'd have to discuss the necessary precautions. \r\nAnd she'd probably need a nurse. But whether or not she should travel, that's -- \r\nthat's really for you two to decide. Look, why don't you discuss this. And you \r\ncan talk to Lucy. And then I'll come back, and I'll answer any questions that \r\nyou might have.",
        "Sierra: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Thank you, doctor. I thought you understood how important it was \r\nthat Lucy not be moved, at least until she's able to walk.",
        "Sierra: I've made my decision.",
        "Craig: Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Sierra: This has nothing to do with you, Craig. I am trying to protect \r\nour daughter. And I have come to the unfortunate conclusion that you cannot be \r\ntrusted, especially since you've been involved with Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Craig: Leave Rosanna Cabot out of this. She is off limits.",

        "Alison: So -- is there anything about me that rings a bell?",
        "Lucy: Your face makes me remember something, but I can't remember what \r\nit is. Hey. Maybe when I get out of here, we could hang out at the places we \r\nused to go together. Maybe that will help.",
        "Alison: When are they setting you free?",
        "Lucy: Dr. Ben said it won't be long.",
        "Alison: So that means you'll be hanging out with Aaron again, too, \r\nright?",
        "Lucy: I hope so. I like him. Hey, can you keep a secret?",
        "Alison: That's what I do best.",
        "Lucy: He stopped by to see me on Christmas eve, and he kissed me.",
        "Alison: He did?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. It was like, all of a sudden, I was sure I was going to \r\nremember all this stuff about him. But, every time I got it, it slipped away. \r\nMaybe I need to kiss him more.",
        "Alison: Right. Your father would slice and dice him if he walked in and \r\nsaw Aaron slobbering all over his little princess.",
        "Lucy: Why?",
        "Alison: Well, you know, fathers and daughters.",
        "Lucy: My dad likes Aaron a lot. He actually wants me to keep seeing \r\nhim. Every time I see Aaron, I remember a little bit more. Some reason I think \r\nAaron's gonna be the one who helps me find my way back.",
        "Alison: Or we could all just start over, couldn't we?",
        "Lucy: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: Well, like with you and me -- I mean, do you really think it's \r\nnecessary to remember every little detail that went on between us for you to \r\nlearn to become friends with me again? I mean, couldn't we just start now and \r\nnot obsess about the past?",
        "Lucy: Well, sure. But -- you don't know what it's like to have these \r\nhuge gaps in your mind. It's like walking into a dark room and trying to turn on \r\nthe lights, but there's only a little flash and then you're back in the dark. I \r\nneed to remember, Alison. I need to remember everything, or I'll never feel like \r\nme again.",

        "Aaron: Okay. Ask Natalie if it's okay for me to hold her.",

        "Carly: Honestly, Jack, I don't know what to think anymore. All I know \r\nis that when you add Julia into any equation, you've got to ask a lot of \r\nquestions. Isn't there a chance, even the slightest chance, that J. J -- that J. \r\nJ. might be somebody else's son?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: Jack, think about it. You know Julia. She's smart. And she's \r\ndangerous. And if there was some way to skew the results of that paternity test, \r\nshe would have done it.",
        "Jack: We were all there, Carly! We were all there. We all saw the lab \r\ntech put the swabs and those little plastic tubes of blood in the cart and wheel \r\nit away.",
        "Carly: All I'm saying is that with Julia's history -- with all of her \r\nthreats about how this baby would destroy us, shouldn't we at least consider the \r\npossibility that she might've orchestrated this whole thing from the beginning?",
        "Jack: Do you know what my life has been like every time I walked into \r\nthat garage for the last two years? Seeing that little sled that I made for the \r\nbaby that Julia and I lost? Every time I see it, Carly, it's like a knife in my \r\nheart. It hurts like it was yesterday.",
        "Carly: I know. I do know what that feels like. I know how it hurts, \r\nJack. And I know for how long.",

He's a part of my life. He even looks like me. All you got to do \r\nis take one look at the kid, and I know -- I know that he's my son.",

Not to a hotel, not to Fairwinds, but a home, with a real bedroom, a place \r\nwhere he can take his friends, a place that he is not afraid to visit. No more \r\nshuffling him from hotel to hotel.
