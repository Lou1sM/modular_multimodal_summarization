        "Aaron learns that the truth is about to come out, envisions how it would be if he could have his way and misreads a situation. Alison fears that she may be hurt if she reveals the truth, tries to confess but is interrupted by a beeper, finds an abandoned baby's mother going into the Intensive Care, grants the woman 5 minutes with her baby and is pushed in a scuffle. Barbara can't tell the truth as that will get her son in trouble for sure, is hurt that her son would say she was involved in trying to frame him, knows that her son would be okay if he had never agreed to marry and loses sympathy for her son. Chris finds the rules have been broken and is angry that a hospital worker doesn't understand what is really going on in a child case.",
        "Dusty tells that a suspect is going down and convinces a twin to work for justice. Holden comes to get his wife to spend time with the children, recognizes a familiar piece of clothing and sees that his family seems back on track. Lily is sure that she can take care of her family by herself, is confused when asked to come and make cookies, changes her mind about going out when she speaks with her son, gets a babysitter, demands that a suspect be arrested or she will go to the tabloids and swears vengeance. Lucy sees no reason to talk of what would be if things were different, but would be willing to talk if things were different. Mitzy misses a chance to get an ally as she broaches a subject and is interrupted, is accused of defying an order and realizes that the jig is up. Paul can't make the others see that he is being framed, finds the cops lazy, is booked, puts his mother in the spotlight and says again that he is being framed."

        "Alison: Do you think that that little guy's life is really ruined?",
        "Katie: No, of course not. Why would I?",
        "Alison: Because his mother messed up so bad.",
        "Katie: Oh, Ali, you just have to give a little baby like that enough care, and they can bounce back from anything.",
        "Alison: Katie --",
        "Katie: Oh, Alison, which baby are you talking about? That one or yours?",
        "[Alison crying]",
        "Alison: I'm just so scared. I haven't slept in weeks. I just never meant for my life to get so out of control. I -- I just don't know --",
        "Katie: Calm down. Just relax a little bit, okay? This stress is not good for you or for the baby. You know what I think you need to do to make yourself feel better? Would you please just bite the bullet and tell the guys the truth?",
        "Alison: I told Aaron, and now he hates me.",
        "Katie: Did you tell Chris?",
        "Alison: Not yet. But I'm going to tell him. And when I do, he'll hate me, too. And then he'll try to take away my baby.",
        "Katie: No -- Alison, please. I can't see Chris being that mean. Think about this, he might be excited at the thought of being a Dad. And now that Aaron knows, it's gonna get out, and it's gonna get to Chris, and you need to be the one to tell him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: What a mess. Sorry.",
        "Clark: No, you look great. But next time I get to take you out, okay? Silverware, or at least chopsticks.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Aaron: Hello?",
        "Alison: Hi, Aaron, this is -- it's me.",
        "Aaron: Alison -- you know, if I knew it was you callin', I wouldn't have picked up. I really hope you know that.",
        "Alison: I know that you're still mad at me, but I just wanted you to know that I'm about to tell Chris the truth about the baby.",
        "Aaron: Really? You want me to be there?",
        "Alison: No. I'll handle it. But thank you for asking.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, sure.",
        "Alison: Aaron? I just want you to know that I'm -- I'm really sorry about everything.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, you said.",
        "Alison: Well, at least you're off the hook, right? Free to do -- whatever.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, okay. Gotta go. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well.",

        "Mitzi: I always loved Rose in this dress. I hope you don't mind me wearin' it. I mean, they snatched me outta A.C. So fast, I didn't have time to pack.",
        "Lily: Don't worry about it. You know, if you want to send for your things in Atlantic City to bring them here, I'll pay for that.",
        "Mitzi: Really?",
        "Lucy: Sure, yeah. Sure.",
        "Mitzi: That'd be great. I mean, I was kinda thinkin' about stickin' around for a little while longer. As a matter of fact, I went by the Roller Palace today and --",
        "Lily: Oh, here it is. This is the one. Here's the one I was looking for.",
        "Mitzi: You're -- you're Lily today, right?",
        "Lily: Yeah. I'm me. I just like wearing Rose's things. It just makes me -- I smell her perfume, it makes me feel closer to her.",
        "Mitzi: Kinda like me in this dress. Your husband, he's a little freaked out about you holdin' on to Rose's stuff, you know? He even asked me to keep an eye on you.",
        "Lily: Can I blame him? What I've been going through is absolute torture on him.",
        "Mitzi: You're okay, now, right?",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm not gonna walk into the pond again, if that's what you're saying. I'm gonna go home, and I'll talk to Holden, and I'll tell him that he has nothing to worry about.",
        "Mitzi: Oh -- can I talk to you about something first?",
        "Lily: Sure.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Holden: Mitzi! It's Holden. Lily in there?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lily: I'm here. See that. I was just about to go home.",
        "Mitzi: That's true. She was just leaving, God as my witness.",
        "Holden: Lily, the kids keep asking for you.",
        "Lily: I'm leaving. I'm coming. Right now. Oh, I'll talk to you later?",
        "Mitzi: Oh, uh, hope so.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Mitzi: Damn. I almost had her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Is it true they can't trace the call that Paul Ryan allegedly got? The one instructing him to come to the mausoleum?",
        "Jack: Whoever called used one of those disposable phones. Probably in a dumpster somewhere.",
        "Hal: But we do have some news. The lab ran the evidence that we found Paul with.",
        "Tom: And?",
        "Jack: Traces of methanol on the goblet.",
        "Tom: Well, then. What are you waiting for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mm. Hey, Dad. Do you want to join us?",
        "Hal: Paul, I need you to come with me.",
        "Paul: Am I under arrest?",
        "Hal: No, but I need you down at the station for questioning.",
        "Dusty: Questioning for what? Why don't you put this punk on lockdown?",
        "Hal: Take a hike, Donovan. This doesn't concern you.",
        "Dusty: No? Rose D'Angelo was the only woman I ever loved. And this piece of trash killed her, and he deserves to fry for it.",
        "Paul: I didn't kill her, Dusty. And if I find you're the one who's settin' me up, I will kill you.",
        "Hal: Don't make it worse on yourself, Paul. Let's go.",
        "Jennifer: It was you, wasn't it?",
        "Dusty: It was me what?",
        "Jennifer: Who arranged it so that the police would find Paul with the champagne glasses.",
        "Dusty: They found a murder weapon on Paul?",
        "Jennifer: Like you didn't know that. Like you didn't plant them and then arrange it so that the cops and Paul showed up at the same time.",
        "Dusty: The cops found a murder weapon on Paul, and they're still playing 20 questions? Your brother's going down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: The Snyder secret popcorn is all popped and ready. Lily? Luke?",
        "[Shouts]",
        "Holden: Hey!",
        "Lily: Gotcha!",
        "Luke: You're our prisoner now!",
        "Holden: Wait, stop! Oh, man.",
        "Lily: This was fun, wasn't it? Hey?",
        "Holden: You guys did it. You got me. I thought you disappeared.",
        "Lily: No, no, no.",
        "Holden: All right, come on. Let's go back in the house, come on.",
        "Luke: No, we're winning.",
        "Holden: No, no, it's cold out here. Come on, you shouldn't be out here now, especially so soon after --",
        "Lily: It's okay. I'd love some hot chocolate. How about you guys?",
        "Luke: I do.",
        "Faith: I do.",
        "Lily: Yeah, yeah, yeah? Okay, come on in.",
        "Luke: With marshmallows!",
        "Holden: All right, kids, let's go. Come on.",
        "Lily: Sure, whatever you want. Whatever you want. Go ahead. Go in the kitchen. Hurry up.",
        "Holden: I have to tell you, it's nice to see you having fun again. The kids have missed having fun with you. So have I.",
        "Lily: It's been a while, I know. But maybe this is just the beginning of a lot more fun.",
        "Holden: Where'd you get this? Is this Rose's?",
        "Lily: Rose gave this to me. It was in the drawer. I just -- you're lookin' at me like I'm gonna go over the edge or something.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I -- I just worry. I don't want you to forget where home is.",
        "Lily: I won't. I won't. I know I lost my bearings there for a while. But I promise, it's you and the kids first. I'm sorry that I worried you.",
        "Luke: Where's the cocoa?",
        "Faith: I want the first marshmallow!",
        "Lily: How about two marshmallows for you because you're so cute? I guess you didn't find them 'cause you'd eat them all.",
        "Holden: Lily, I need to head over to our accountant's and take care of some things.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Holden: I'm gonna call my mother and have her come over.",
        "Lily: Why? Why do you have to have Emma?",
        "Holden: Why -- I just thought maybe you know -- you could use the help with the kids right now.",
        "Lily: It's okay. I think we have a lot to occupy our time. Come on guys, let's go find the cocoa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So how's this one go?",
        "Jack: I'm gonna lay it out for you, Paul. We found traces of methanol on the goblet you gave Rose. It doesn't look too good for you.",
        "Paul: I didn't put methanol or anything else in that goblet.",
        "Hal: Well, somebody did.",
        "Paul: Well, somebody is going to great lengths to make it look like I killed Rose. You guys are falling for it. You should be out there looking for the real killer, instead of wasting your time talking to me.",
        "Tom: We're bringing a killer to justice. None of which is a waste of time, including talking to you.",
        "Jack: We know that you brought the champagne and the goblet to the church.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that's no secret. But when I left the church, the champagne, the goblet, and the glasses were all still there.",
        "Jack: So you say. But you had plenty of time to circle back and grab them while everyone was focused on Rose.",
        "Paul: So you think that what I did to Rose on the altar was some kind of diversion so I could move the evidence? I'm not that clever. Or sick.",
        "Jack: Really? Sick? Wouldn't you call faking your own death sick? Owning your own crypt, which just so happens to be a pretty handy place to stash evidence?",
        "Paul: I did not see the champagne glasses, the goblet or the champagne after I gave them all to Rose and her bridesmaids. Someone's setting me up and you're falling for it hook, line and sinker. You want to talk to who did this? Talk to Barbara.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: When did they take him in?",
        "Jennifer: A little while ago.",
        "Barbara: Did he say anything about me and the glasses?",
        "Jennifer: Uh, I don't know -- not while he was here.",
        "Barbara: Thank God.",
        "Jennifer: But Mom, I did say something, I think, that I shouldn't have.",
        "Barbara: You sold me out to your father?",
        "Jennifer: No. No. But Dusty was here and I accused him of making the anonymous tip that made the police bring him in for questioning and -- he said he didn't know anything about it and he left here yelling --",
        "Barbara: You know, you know, forget about Dusty. We've got to get down there and make sure your brother doesn't say too much.",
        "Jennifer: You're worried about yourself?",
        "Barbara: No, I am worried that your brother is going to make things worse -- for himself, for you, for Will, for me, for all of us.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then you'd better tell the police that you were the one who took the evidence from the church.",
        "Barbara: If your father knows that I did that, he will think that I suspected my own son and that will make things worse for your brother.",
        "Jennifer: Well, at least they didn't arrest him.",
        "Barbara: We better make sure it stays that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh. You're just in time for -- oatmeal cookies. The kids and I have been in the kitchen all day. Very, very busy. You wanna, come in?",
        "Dusty: No, I didn't come to have any cookies. I want to talk to you about Paul Ryan.",
        "Lily: Okay. I watched the tape -- and I couldn't believe it. I was looking at it and I couldn't believe it. I mean, that was -- that was supposed to be the happiest day of Rose's life.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Paul made it the last day of her life. He's an animal.",
        "Lily: Look, Dusty. If he killed her --",
        "Dusty: No --",
        "Lily: Then the police will if --",
        "Dusty: There is no \"if.\" The cops know he killed her. They're putting on kid gloves for this kid.",
        "Lily: Wait a minute. You know something about this investigation?",
        "Dusty: The cops found the champagne bottle and the glass that rose drank from. Guess where? Right in Paulie's little hands.",
        "Lily: They caught him?",
        "Dusty: And they didn't even charge him. Now, I'm afraid -- I'm afraid if you and I don't step up to the plate here, that guy is not going to pay for what he did.",
        "Lily: I can't do it. I'm so -- I'm just so tired. And I miss her so much, and I just don't have it in me for some revenge crusade right now. I just don't.",
        "Dusty: Do you have it in you -- do you have it in you to see some justice served, you know? To make sure that people understand the value of your sister's life -- and the consequences for taking it. What if the situation was reverse? God forbid, you got murdered. Someone just took your life. What would Rose do?",
        "Lily: She wouldn't give up until that person suffered the way that I would have suffered. She -- my God, oh my God. I just -- I feel -- I do -- I feel it. I want him to pay. I want him to hurt. I want him to feel -- to suffer and feel that powerlessness that she felt and that -- how frightened she was that day. I want him to feel that. I have that in me, I do.",
        "Dusty: And he will. So, please, come down to the station with me right now, and make it clear. Make it very clear to these cops what they need to do. All right?",
        "Lily: Okay, yeah. Okay.",
        "Luke: Mom? Aren't we going to make the oatmeal cookies?",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Luke: The cookies? Are you okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Hi, Luce. What's up, man?",
        "Clark: Hey, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: How's it going?",
        "Clark: Great. Soon as you get that feeling run to me",
        "Aaron: God, Lucy -- that night I slept with Alison was the biggest mistake of my life. I just thought that -- I thought that you and me -- I thought we were finished --",
        "Lucy: I thought we were finished, too. But I can't get over you, Aaron. I never will. I think about you all the time. I can't stop.",
        "Aaron: So what's up with this Clark dude? I mean, he's sure got the perfect pedigree. Everything your Dad ever wanted for you. Is he everything you've always wanted?",
        "Lucy: He's okay. Mostly I just spend time with him to keep from thinking about you. What about Alison?",
        "Aaron: No. No, I'm not in love with Alison. You know that.",
        "Lucy: Well, you're married now -- and you have a baby on the way.",
        "Aaron: But that's the thing, Luce -- the baby? It's not mine.",
        "Lucy: Really? Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Aaron: I just didn't think it'd make a difference. I mean, I still hurt you. I still slept with her.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah, you did hurt me. Pretty badly. But I just can't hate you, Aaron. I still love you.",
        "Aaron: Oh, Luce, I love you so much. All I want is to be with you.",
        "Lucy: Me too.",
        "Aaron: So now that you know how it really is, we could fix this. We can do this, we can be together again. We can.",
        "Clark: Well, we should get going. We gotta catch that matinee in Chicago.",
        "Lucy: Right. Um, you know, could you bring the car out front?",
        "Clark: As you wish.",
        "Lucy: Thanks. Well, I guess I'll see ya 'round.",
        "Aaron: No, wait, Lucy -- let me ask you a question, please. What if -- what if everything that happened to us, hadn't happened? Would we still be together?",
        "Lucy: But it did happen, Aaron. Didn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How's the Anderson baby?",
        "Chris: He's good. He's due to be released to his father today. That poor kid's been through a lot.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but babies bounce back, right?",
        "Chris: That's what we tell ourselves, anyway. You okay? You look flushed.",
        "Alison: I do?",
        "Chris: Yeah, why don't you go to the lounge on your break and put your feet up? Make sure you're drinking plenty of water -- sorry.",
        "Alison: No, no. It's okay. It almost sounded like you cared.",
        "Chris: I do care, Alison. Okay, even though we might not be together anymore, I want the best for you and your baby.",
        "Alison: Do you really mean that?",
        "Chris: Sure.",
        "Alison: Because I -- [Beeper goes off] I have something that I --",
        "Chris: Sorry, Alison, that's the E.R.",
        "Alison: Can it wait?",
        "Chris: No. No, I gotta go.",
        "Alison: No, but it's really important. I'm afraid that if I don't tell --",
        "Chris: We'll talk later, okay?",
        "Alison: Maybe -- just maybe everything will work out. Oh, excuse me! I'm sorry, but this is intensive care. Didn't you read the sign? Nobody is allowed in here --",
        "Woman: That's my son -- I just want to see him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You remember my friend, Dusty Donovan, right?",
        "Dusty: How's it going?",
        "Luke: Hi. Are you okay, Mom? Are we going outside again?",
        "Lily: No. Just hanging my coat up.",
        "Luke: Good. 'Cause Faith was trying to take the flour out and it fell all over the floor.",
        "Lily: Okay, uh, can you go help her for a second? I'll be right in there in a minute.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Lily: I promise, I've just got to -- finish up here -- with Dusty Donovan. I am not doing this. I can't go. I cannot leave -- I am not leaving my kids --",
        "Dusty: No disrespect to your kids, but we're talking about making cookies --",
        "Lily: Excuse me. Do you know -- do you have any idea the hell that I've put my family through lately?",
        "Dusty: Yes. Paul Ryan put all of you through hell, he -- he murdered your sister, Lil.",
        "Lily: What do you want me to do? Beat a confession out of him?",
        "Dusty: You're the daughter of Lucinda Walsh. You sit on every council in this town. You can lean on these guys. You can pressure them into handling the situation the way they're supposed to handle it. Don't forget, you own a TV station -- and your mother owns the \"City Times.\"",
        "Lily: Okay, all right. I'll make some calls --",
        "Dusty: I think its better we go down there in person. You know, while they got Paul on ice. We can make sure that guy doesn't walk away a free man.",
        "Lily: I am not leaving those kids. I can't leave them here alone.",
        "Dusty: Call somebody.",
        "Lily: Hi, Mitzi?",
        "Mitzi: Lily! I was just thinking about you.",
        "Lily: I was wondering if you could do me a favor. I'm -- could you come and watch Luke and Faith for a little while? I have to go out.",
        "Mitzi: Sure. I'll be there in a snap. Great. I do you a favor, Lil, and you do me a favor.",
        "Lily: Okay, we can go as soon as Mitzi gets here.",
        "Dusty: Now we're talking. We'll make sure that Paul Ryan does not leave this town unless he's on a bus to Joliet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Paul, no one here wants to believe that you planned to murder Rose.",
        "Paul: Really? 'Cause it seems to me you guys are bending over backwards to try and pin this on me. I've got nothing else to say.",
        "Hal: Oh, damn it, Paul! I'm on your side.",
        "Paul: Not if you're trying to coax a confession out of me. I did not kill Rose -- and I am not the one who moved the evidence.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. Your story of Barbara playing musical chairs with the evidence is laughable. Now you want us to believe that someone stole it back and set you up?",
        "Barbara: You told them?",
        "Hal: Are you saying that it's true?",
        "Barbara: I'm familiar with the story. And I cannot believe that my son is telling such vicious, scandalous lies about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Shut up!",
        "Chris: Hey, man, what are you --",
        "Alison: No, Aaron \u0096 ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Tell them, Mother. Tell them how you admitted to me that you tampered with the evidence.",
        "Barbara: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jennifer: Mom? What are you doing?",
        "Paul: Ask her, Hal. Ask her to sit down and have a nice, long chat with you about how she moved the glasses from the church and tried to plant them on Molly McKinnon. She's already confessed it to me. Ask Jennifer, she was there. Tell them, Jen.",
        "Barbara: Stop trying to drag your sister into this. You can't make her your accomplice. It's bad enough that you've already dumped this in my lap.",
        "Jennifer: Mom!",
        "Barbara: Jennifer, please, I know what I'm doing.",
        "Tom: Okay. I've had enough of this circus.",
        "Jack: Yeah, me too.",
        "Paul: If this is a circus, you guys are the ones who are jumping through hoops. I guess it's easier to pin a murder on the jilted fianc\u00e9 than it is to go out there and dig for the real evidence.",
        "Jack: No, we found the real evidence, Paul. It came back pointing to you!",
        "Paul: Planted evidence! The real evidence is still out there, Jack. Go dig.",
        "Barbara: Why couldn't you just listen to me? If had taken my advice maybe none of this would have happened. Oh, yeah, maybe Rose would end up with somebody else, but at least she would be alive.",
        "Lily: For once, I have to agree with you, Barbara.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Luce, wait.",
        "Lucy: Aaron, why are you doing this? I mean, don't you think I've asked myself a million times \"what if\"? It doesn't solve anything. You still slept with Alison, the two of you are still pregnant and you're still married. How am I supposed to get past all that?",
        "Aaron: Look, I know it's hard. I know it's hard, okay? It's probably not even fair for me to ask, but please, just for one second, Luce, one second, try to picture things differently. What if -- what if somehow I can erase what happened? Would we still have a chance?",
        "Lucy: If you could prove this was just one huge nightmare then yeah, maybe. Maybe we would have something to talk about.",
        "Clark: Car's out front. We should get going if we want to make the curtain on time. See you around, Aaron.",
        "Lucy: See you.",
        "Aaron: Um, waitress? Check, please?",
        "Waitress: You didn't like the food?",
        "Aaron: Um, I need to be somewhere.",
        "Waitress: She must be someone special.",
        "Aaron: Oh, she's amazing. Now I gotta make sure somebody holds up their end of the bargain. Have a good day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, but if you don't leave right now, I'm supposed to call security.",
        "Woman: Look, I messed up really bad. Don't you think I know that? But I'm getting myself straight now.",
        "Alison: You walked out on him. That's terrible. Who just leaves a tiny baby alone in an apartment?",
        "Woman: I'm not asking anybody to understand. But it's not so easy when you're alone and you need diapers and you need food and you need -- well, it's not so easy. Do you know where he's going?",
        "Alison: They'll put him in a good home.",
        "Woman: That's probably better for Timothy -- that's his name -- it's better for him to be with somebody who can be good to him until I get myself together. But I'm going to make this up to him. He looks so little in there. Is he okay?",
        "Alison: Well, at least well enough to be released today.",
        "Woman: That means I got here just in time. Can I just hold him and tell him I still love him?",
        "Alison: I don't know --",
        "Woman: Please. I don't know when I'll get to hold him again. This program that they're sending me to -- I don't know when they're going to let me out of it. Please. He's my little boy. Just -- just five minutes?",
        "Alison: Okay -- just five minutes. And don't get any ideas about running off with him or anything.",
        "Woman: I won't. Thank you.",
        "Chris: What the hell is going on in here? Get your hands off that baby. Now.",
        "Alison: She just wanted to hold him, Chris. She wasn't going to hurt him.",
        "Chris: Alison, you shouldn't have let her in the first place. Okay, I don't even know how you let her near that baby.",
        "Alison: She knew that she messed up. She just wanted to say good-bye. She is still his mother.",
        "Chris: No, she doesn't deserve to call herself that. Okay, her parental rights, they're being revoked. All right? There's no excuse for what she did.",
        "Alison: No, I didn't say that what she did was okay. It was horrible, but people make mistakes. And she's going to a treatment center. She's trying to get herself together.",
        "Chris: You know how many times I've heard that story, Alison? The time to get her life together was before she brought a child into it. Okay? She put that baby's life at risk and so did you by letting her near it. You, of all people should know, Alison -- babies are precious. You can't take risks like that with babies. Okay, you were way out of line.",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, buddy. You have no right to talk to Alison that way. All right, I don't like what she did any more than you do --",
        "Alison: No, Aaron --",
        "Aaron: That's okay -- but she's owning up to it.",
        "Alison: Aaron, please don't say anything else.",
        "Chris: No, you know what, Alison? The man's got something to say? I want to hear him say it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily -- I'm home. Sol said to say, \"hello\" and that he misses you very much. Where's Lily?",
        "Mitzi: Um, I don't know. Something came up; she called me to watch the kids.",
        "Holden: She called you?",
        "Mitzi: You know, you come from a big family like me; you're used to watching kids at a moment's notice. And, uh, I was happy to do her a favor. But, now you're here, so I'll just skedaddle.",
        "Holden: Where are the kids?",
        "Mitzi: Um, Luke's in the family room working a puzzle and Natalie and Faith are upstairs napping.",
        "Holden: What's your game, Mitzi?",
        "Mitzi: Excuse me?",
        "Holden: I asked you to make sure that Rose's things were picked up and taken to the thrift shop at the church, and here you are wearing one of Rose's dresses. And this morning I saw Lily was wearing a scarf that I know I packed in a box.",
        "Mitzi: Well, you know, I needed to borrow a dress. I mean, all my stuff is in Jersey.",
        "Holden: Mitzi, Mitzi, I went to see if the pickup was made. And it wasn't. You're lying to me. Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: What's going on here? Was Paul found with evidence?",
        "Jack: Let's go outside.",
        "Lily: Jack?",
        "Jack: We found the bottle of champagne and the goblet on him. They tested positive for methanol.",
        "Lily: What? That's the poison that killed Rose.",
        "Jack: Listen, interfering with an interrogation, that's not okay.",
        "Lily: What are Barbara and Jennifer doing in here?",
        "Jack: That's a good question.",
        "Paul: So is this all still part of your brilliant plan, Barbara? Is this you still helping me?",
        "Jennifer: Mom, do something!",
        "Paul: Jennifer. Stop talking.",
        "Barbara: It breaks my heart to see you digging yourself in deeper and deeper -- and it kills me that you think that I'm involved somehow. Because Paul, you have no one to blame but yourself.",
        "Jennifer: How are you going to explain this to Will? Paul, don't worry, okay? I'm going to get you a lawyer. Just don't answer any more questions.",
        "Hal: Jennifer -- Jennifer!",
        "Cop #4: Lieutenant? Sorry, you wanted to see the evidence.",
        "Hal: Yes. Thank you.",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Lily: I saw her -- I watched my sister drink that poison. I want -- I want you to -- I want you to arrest him. I want you to arrest him now! Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Aaron is done talking with you and so am I.",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't exactly know what the hell is going down here, okay? But you, my friend, should not be yelling at Ali like that.",
        "Chris: You know what she did? She let an unfit mother into a secured area to take possession of a baby that she abandoned!",
        "Alison: She was not taking possession of him, she was holding him and I was right in the room with her the whole time. I just felt sorry for her, that's all.",
        "Aaron: All right. So Alison proved she has a heart. Cut her some slack. All right? She felt bad for another mother that was in a jam, that's all.",
        "Chris: You know what? If this is even a hint of the kind of mother that she's going to be, I feel sorry for your kid. And you -- you -- if you think that what she did is okay, then you don't have a clue either.",
        "Aaron: All right, you're out of line, buddy. Watch your mouth.",
        "Chris: No, no, no. You know what your two guys problem is? You don't think anything through. You jumped into bed. You jumped into marriage. And now you think just because you made a baby, that you know how to raise one. It's a joke!",
        "Aaron: Shut up!",
        "Chris: Hey, man, what are you --",
        "Alison: No, Aaron -- ow!",
        "Aaron: Are you okay? Move, man!",
        "Alison: I'm okay. Honest. I'm okay. I'm okay.",
        "Aaron: Just stay the hell away from her!",
        "Alison: I was gonna -- I was gonna tell him. He got paged and -- then when he came back, the Mom was there -- I was going to tell him.",
        "Aaron: I believe you. I believe you were going to tell him. Don't worry, okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?",
        "Alison: I just felt sorry for her, that's all -- and just -- he just went off.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, he shouldn't be treating you like that. All right? Let's get out of here. Come on. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: So Lily just wants to wear some of Rose's stuff. I mean, what is the big deal?",
        "Holden: The big deal is that she's very fragile right now. Pulling out little reminders of Rose and parading around in them is not good for her. In fact, it could be very damaging.",
        "Mitzi: Listen, she just wants to find a way so that Rose won't seem so far away, all right? I get that, don't you? I mean, Lily and I were Rose's two closest friends in the whole world and we both miss her like the dickens.",
        "Holden: Cut the crap. You may have Lily fooled, you may even have Jack fooled, but you do not fool me.",
        "Mitzi: I am not trying to fool anybody.",
        "Holden: Bull! You're an opportunist and an embezzler and I don't know why you're here, but you did come back here for a reason.",
        "Mitzi: I just need a place to stay until I can get back on my feet. Honest.",
        "Holden: Well, you better do it fast. Because if you think I'm going to let you use my wife like you used her sister, think again. I'm going to be watching you, Mitzi.",
        "Mitzi: Go ahead. [Door closes] You won't see me coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I want him arrested. I want him arrested now.",
        "Paul: Lily, if you could just calm down for a minute.",
        "Lily: Why aren't you going to arrest him? He's got the motive. He has the evidence in his possession!",
        "Tom: I'm the district attorney, Lily, and Hal is the head of this department. Are you presuming to tell us when and how to do our job?",
        "Lily: I'm just telling you if you don't arrest him, I'm going to call the \"City Times\" and this whole fiasco is going to be the subject of every editorial. And then if you don't arrest him, then I'm going to make sure that you're indicted, your office, the police department, and the entire administration.",
        "Tom: Given the fact that we all feel a great deal of compassion for you and your recent loss, Hal could have you escorted you out of here by uniform right now, and I could bring charges against you for interfering with an investigation and threatening an official, so why don't you bring it down a notch? It's time. Book him.",
        "Jack: Paul Ryan Stenbeck, you're under arrest for the murder of Rose D'Angelo.",
        "Paul: Lily, I didn't --",
        "Dusty: Finally.",
        "Paul: I didn't do this.",
        "Jack: You have the right to remain silent.",
        "Paul: I loved her, you know that.",
        "Jack: Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.",
        "Paul: I mean, I was angry. I wanted to hurt her.",
        "Jack: You have the right to an attorney.",
        "Paul: I don't deserve to be lied to, and I don't deserve to be treated like this. I think I'm the biggest idiot on the face of the earth for ever thinking that I could make this work. I'll leave you alone now, Rose. Do you really think I'm ever gonna believe any word out of your lying mouth? I hope that you're alone for the rest of your miserable -- with this ring -- I'm the biggest idiot -- I want no part of it. I don't deserve to be lied to, and I don't deserve to be treated like this. I hope that you are alone for the rest of your miserable -- with this ring I do not thee wed. I think I'm the biggest idiot on the face of the earth for ever thinking that I could make this work.",
        "Dusty: You made sure he was arrested. That's what's important. You're gonna be okay now.",
        "Lily: Its not gonna be okay until he pays. And I want him to pay.",

        "Mike: Don't go anywhere.",
        "Katie: I mean, I wouldn't \u0096",
        "Lily: You help set a monster free. He poisoned my sister, and he denied it, and you fell for it.",
