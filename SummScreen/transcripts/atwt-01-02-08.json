        "Craig has a bad dream that Meg went back to Paul when she realized the baby was his. Will and Gwen prepare for Hallie Jennifer's Christening. Barbara receives bad news from her doctor. Aaron bumps into Allison shopping and asks her to go to the Christening, but Allison wonders if there would be room for her since he is probably taking Sophie. Carly is sick, but Rosanna passes along a gift from her to Gwen \u0096 Parker and Sage's Christening gown. Meg finds Craig trying to bandage his cut back up and sees that it is infected. Craig fights going to the hospital, but Meg wins out. Aaron explains that Sophie isn't going, but Allison still turns him down. Barbara calls Paul, but he is about to leave for the Christening; Barbara pleads that it is important, as Paul doesn't want to admit where he is until Barbara hears a baby cry. She changes her tune and immediately tells him that he is where he should be and she will talk to him later. Barbara asks the doctor to keep her test results quiet. Chris sees Craig and confirms he has an infection. He gets back the test results and asks to speak with Craig alone where he tells him that he had a trace amount of a drug that causes miscarriages in his cut; where did he get a hold of that? Craig pretends that he must have put his hand in something at another lab they were considering if the Memorial deal fell through. Craig asks Chris not to mention this to Meg so she won't worry. Will and Gwen ask Allison and Aaron to be Godparents, and they happily agree. Meg goes to lunch with some friends, as Craig goes home and starts drinking. Barbara sadly wanders downtown alone. Gwen and Will baptize Hallie Jennifer, and just at the end of the ceremony Sophie shows up. Aaron and Allison are a bit uncomfortable when Sophie asks who Hallie's godparents are? Meg calls Craig and asks him to join her at the lunch. Aaron stays with Sophie after everyone leaves to go back to Will and Gwen's even though Allison suggests Sophie might want to be alone. Craig overreacts angrily when he sees Meg and her friends joking with a fake baby. Sophie talks with a minister about her decision. As she is about to leave the church, she sees Barbara talking to herself and asking for a favor. Meg is confused by Craig's behavior. She is irate though when he talks bout Lucy taking away Johnny. After her friends leave, Meg and Craig fight. Craig is talking strangely about the fake baby looking like him? Gwen wonders if Allison is ok with being Godparents with Aaron and them not being together? She is fine; they are just friends. Gwen teases that is all she wanted from Will and now he is her life. Sophie listens as Barbara pleads for simply more time with her kids to see them happy and for them to forgive her before it is too late. Gwen and Will are thrilled, as they lie on their bed with their new baby in between them. Craig babbles on about whom the baby looks like, as Meg is furious that he is drinking on the medication. Craig won't be deterred with his inquiries as if the fake baby looks like its father, and when he sees Rosanna and Paul, he races over to ask them the same question."

        "[Craig dreaming]",
        "Craig: Meg? Meg? Meg? Oh, there you are. I have been looking all over for you. I woke up and you were gone.",
        "Meg: We spent the night here.",
        "Craig: What? What are you talking about? Who's we? What are you doing with my son?",
        "Paul: Come on, Craig. We all know better than that.",
        "Craig: That is my son. You tell him, Meg.",
        "Meg: I wish I could but I can't. It's not true.",
        "Craig: Of course it is. Why are you doing this?",
        "Meg: Craig. Come on, the first moment I looked into his eyes I knew -- this is Paul's baby.",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Meg: A mother knows, Craig.",
        "Paul: See for yourself. Little guy looks just like his old man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Thanks for coming today.",
        "Paul: It's my niece's christening. I wouldn't miss it, it's a once-in-a- lifetime experience.",
        "Will: I feel bad about some of the stuff I said --",
        "Paul: Will, stop. Don't even think about it.",
        "Will: I was angry at Mom for lying to us about the adoption, and I took it out on you. So I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: Okay, fine, apology accepted. What about Mom? Does she know about Hallie?",
        "Will: Yeah. She came by. She wanted to see her. I wasn't going to let that happen.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Will: You're gonna judge me for that? You gonna make me feel guilty?",
        "Paul: No, it's your call. I mean, if that's you think you have to handle it.",
        "Will: I'm not trying to make her feel bad. I -- I'm really not. I just -- I think that she takes things too far, and I'm not gonna let that happen to my daughter.",
        "Paul: So you're gonna throw Mom out of your life forever?",
        "Will: If that's what it takes to protect my Hallie. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Hearn: How are you feeling, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Why don't you tell me?",
        "Dr. Hearn: I have the results of your tests.",
        "Barbara: Good. I'm perfect as usual, right?",
        "Dr. Hearn: Why don't you sit down?",
        "Barbara: Before I fall down? What? What is it?",
        "Dr. Hearn: Barbara --",
        "Barbara: Tell me what's wrong with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Wow, looks like you bought out the whole store.",
        "Alison: I tried not to. It's just -- it's not fair, everything they sell for babies is so cute.",
        "Aaron: You going to the christening?",
        "Alison: Yes. You?",
        "Aaron: I am. I bought a little card.",
        "Alison: You're such a guy.",
        "Aaron: Hey, I'll make a deal with you. If you put this card on one of those little presents of yours, I'll -- I'll take you to the church.",
        "Alison: Oh gee, that's really tempting.",
        "Aaron: Maybe we'll go for some hot chocolate later. What do you say?",
        "Alison: Are you sure there's gonna be room in your truck?",
        "Aaron: Ali, I don't think those presents are that big.",
        "Alison: I was talking about Sofie. Aren't you taking her to the christening?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hey. Hey Em, it's me -- I'm sorry I didn't make it home last night, but I just thought it was a good idea to stay close to my dad. Call me when you get this, okay? I miss you.",
        "Nurse #2: This should help with the pain and swelling. If the pain persists, give us a call.",
        "Sofie: Thank you.",
        "Chris: Let me guess -- c-section, right?",
        "Sofie: How did you know?",
        "Chris: Doctor's eye. But uh, the way you just sat down was actually a dead giveaway. But what really gave it away is you have that new mom look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh.",
        "Paul: This was in the car.",
        "Rosanna: Great. Um, we stopped by Carly's on the way over here.",
        "Gwen: Yeah? She gonna meet us at the church?",
        "Rosanna: Um no, Sweetie, I'm sorry. She woke up with a bit of a sore throat, and she didn't think it would be a good for the baby.",
        "Paul: But she made us promise that we would take lots of pictures.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and to make sure that you got this.",
        "Gwen: Oh, wow, that's a big box. Oh, wow, it's a christening gown.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, yes, and there's a card. Read the card.",
        "Gwen: \"Dear Will and Gwen -- this is the gown Parker and Sage wore when they were baptized. I hope it's a tradition you'll carry on with your own family. Love, Carly.\" That's amazing. I don't know, it's just really hitting me. You and me -- we have -- we have a baby.",
        "Will: All we really do is change Hallie, and play with Hallie, and stare at Hallie, and everything, but it hasn't sunk in yet that she's ours. You know, it still feels -- really amazing.",
        "Paul: You guys have been parents for a few days. It's understandable that you'd be a little blown away.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I mean she's already changed our lives so much.",
        "Rosanna: Well, babies have a way of changing everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What are you doing?",
        "Craig: I'm trying to re-bandage the damn hand.",
        "Meg: Here, let me help you with that.",
        "Craig: I've got it. I've got it. I got it.",
        "Meg: Would you stop? Let me take care of it.",
        "Craig: Ow.",
        "Meg: Craig, this looks infected. What was in that glass? This isn't right. I'm getting dressed. I'm taking you to the hospital.",
        "Craig: I am not going to the hospital.",
        "Meg: Craig.",
        "Craig: Look, its fine. It's just a little cut.",
        "Meg: If it was a little cut, it would've healed by now, and it hasn't.",
        "Craig: In a couple of days, it will be fine.",
        "Meg: Or it'll worse than now. Look, from the looks of it, you're need antibiotics.",
        "Craig: Can we not make this into a big production?",
        "Meg: Do you remember when you handed the corporation over to me?",
        "Craig: Oh, you gonna pull the boss card?",
        "Meg: I stayed up with you night after night in that board room, not understanding or having any idea of what I was doing, listening to everything you had to say about divisions and all that stuff, and do you know why?",
        "Craig: Because I'm fascinating?",
        "Meg: Because you knew what you were talking about. Just like I know what I'm talking about now. That cut, it needs to be treated.",
        "Craig: Fine. I will get it looked at.",
        "Meg: Good, thank you. I'm coming with you.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Meg: Because I wanna make sure that you really go, and that you're not humoring the pregnant lady.",
        "Craig: Fine, fine, let's get it over with right away, okay?",
        "Meg: God help me if our son inherits that stubborn streak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie's not going to the christening, Alison.",
        "Alison: Are you sure? Will and Gwen invited her.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but she said no. I mean she just went through a lot, you know? She just gave Hallie up.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I can understand that. You know, um, sometimes I wonder if -- the whole in vitro procedure had worked, if I would feel the same way Sofie does right now. About seeing, you know, Will and Gwen with the baby --",
        "Aaron: You would've handled it just fine.",
        "Alison: You do?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Ali, I think you're a lot stronger than you give yourself credit for.",
        "Alison: So I've been told.",
        "Aaron: Yes. So, what do you say? Can I give you a ride?",
        "Alison: I would like that.",
        "Aaron: Good, so let's go.",
        "Alison: But I'm going to pass.",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Alison: I think I need to listen to everyone who's been telling me I have all of this strength, and get there on my own. I'll see you at the church, Aaron.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I'm --I'm forgetting manners. I'm Dr. Chris Hughes, chief of staff here at Memorial.",
        "Sofie: Aren't you a little young for chief of staff?",
        "Chris: Yeah -- I get that a lot.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.",
        "Chris: No, no, no, you didn't. So, was I right? You just had a baby? Guessing about a week ago?",
        "Sofie: Just um -- just before Christmas.",
        "Chris: Boy or girl?",
        "Sofie: A little girl.",
        "Chris: It's something else, isn't it? It's that new baby smell that gets me. I don't know what it is, but if you ask me, it's pretty close to perfect. So, what did you name her?",
        "Sofie: They -- her name is Hallie.",
        "Chris: Pretty name. I'm sorry. I forgot to ask your name.",
        "Nurse Jan: Uh, Dr. Hughes? We just got a call at the nurse's station. There's a patient coming in who's requested to see you.",
        "Chris: Okay. Set up in exam two. I'm sorry I just \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Maybe they made a mistake.",
        "Dr. Hearn: I want to make sure you understand your options. Do you have questions?",
        "Barbara: Um, I'm sure that I will, I -- I just need to take all this in, to consider all of it.",
        "Dr. Hearn: I understand. If you need help with anything --",
        "Barbara: I know what my next step is. I just have to take it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Okay, that's it. I think we're ready to go.",
        "Paul: Hey, that looks good on you.",
        "Rosanna: Oh yes, very stylish.",
        "Will: Yeah, very stylish Dad, that was the look I was going for.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Paul: That's me. It's Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Meg was right, this cut is definitely infected.",
        "Craig: Oh, no I told you so's?",
        "Meg: I'm saving them up.",
        "Chris: I put a rush on your labs, that'll give us a better idea of what we're dealing with here. You really cut this on a piece of glass?",
        "Craig: Hey, how's your father doing?",
        "Chris: He's about the same. He woke up for while around Christmas time, but we had to sedate him again to keep him calm.",
        "Meg: I'm so sorry.",
        "Chris: Thank you. It's been rough. Mostly on my mom, and my grandma. They're here practically around the clock.",
        "Craig: At least business is good though, right?",
        "Chris: I suppose.",
        "Craig: And now Montgomery Enterprises has financed this brand new research lab here at Memorial. All because the young Dr. Hughes has taken over chief of staff in his father's place.",
        "Chris: Should've warned you that was going to sting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Will: Pick it up, you should pick it up.",
        "Paul: I can let it go to voicemail.",
        "Will: You do, and she's just going to keep calling.",
        "Paul: Hey, Mom.",
        "Barbara: You answered. Honey, I need to see you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, look, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now.",
        "Barbara: Well, whatever it is, it can wait. I really need to see you right now, it's important.",
        "Paul: Yeah, can I -- can call you back later.",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "Barbara: Are you with your brother?",
        "Paul: Mom, can I call you back later?",
        "Barbara: No, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. You don't -- it's okay. Stay right there with them. That's what I want you to do.",
        "Will: I'm sorry to put you in the middle of this.",
        "Paul: Oh no, please. Saying no to Mom? I live for that.",
        "Will: She was okay though?",
        "Paul: You don't need to worry about Mom. Today's a really important day. You worry about you. Come on. Your girls are waiting.",
        "Will: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Hearn: My nurse will call the day before to confirm the appointment.",
        "Barbara: I don't think I'll forget it.",
        "Dr. Hearn: Barbara, do you have anyone you can talk to about this? Any family or friends?",
        "Barbara: Well yes, of course I do -- and I will. Later.",
        "Dr. Hearn: I don't think you should wait too long. Mentally, it could help you quite a bit.",
        "Barbara: I don't want anyone to know about this right now. Not 'til I'm ready. And I don't want you to talk to anyone about this, Doctor.",
        "Dr. Hearn: You have my word.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. I'll see you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse Jan: Oh, hi Meg! I didn't know you were here.",
        "Meg: Jan, hey. It is so good to see you.",
        "Nurse Jan: Oh, it's so good to see you. You look great.",
        "Meg: Thanks.",
        "Nurse Jan: You should come out and say hi to everybody. They would be so happy to see you.",
        "Meg: You know, I will. I just need to find out what's wrong with my husband.",
        "Craig: There's nothing wrong. It's just a little cut.",
        "Meg: He's not a big fan of hospitals.",
        "Chris: Well then let's try to expedite things. Uh, Jan, are those Mr. Montgomery's test results?",
        "Nurse Jan: Uh, yes, they are, sorry.",
        "Chris: It looks like nothing more than a mild infection. Meg, why don't you go outside and say hi to your friends while we finish up in here?",
        "Meg: Okay. I'll be right outside.",
        "Craig: Okay. So, I'm fine.",
        "Chris: No, you're not. That infection was exacerbated by trace amounts of a drug that induces miscarriages in pregnant women. How did you come in contact with that?",
        "Craig: I can't imagine.",
        "Chris: Well, we need to find the source. Xyphorex can be very dangerous for Meg and the baby. Maybe we should ask Meg how that drug got in your home.",
        "Craig: This infection -- can it be treated?",
        "Chris: Very easily. I can give you a shot now and write you up a prescription for some antibiotics.",
        "Craig: Okay, let's do that.",
        "Chris: I will. As soon as I find out where the Xyphorex came from.",
        "Craig: Okay, you know, actually, Chris, I took a tour of a facility earlier in the week. A different lab that we're considering doing business with.",
        "Chris: Outside of Memorial?",
        "Craig: I must've touched something I shouldn't have. That's all I can think of. Oh, come on, Chris, let's not get your stethoscope all in a twist. I needed to make sure that your lab was competitive. And it is.",
        "Chris: I could've told you that. Can you roll up your sleeve for me, please?",
        "Craig: Sure. Listen, also, I really appreciate the tact that you showed with Meg.",
        "Chris: Well considering Xyphorex can induce miscarriages in pregnant women and your wife is pregnant, I didn't want to alarm her unnecessarily.",
        "Craig: I appreciate that. It hasn't gone unnoticed. I'm just hoping that we can -- well, I can continue to count on that discretion.",
        "Chris: You can. But if you're telling me the truth, why would you worry about that?",
        "Craig: We're partners, you and I, in the research that we're doing here at Memorial. I'd like to think I can trust you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that looks so great. Just tilt her head up a little bit, okay?",
        "Will: Is my arm okay?",
        "Paul: You want to be in the picture, too, Will?",
        "Will: Very funny.",
        "Gwen: No, come on, we need take one good picture that we can frame.",
        "Aaron: A picture frame. That would've been a good present. How come we didn't think of that?",
        "Alison: And again, I'm going to have to say because you're a guy.",
        "Gwen: Hey, you guys made it!",
        "Alison: And on time.",
        "Gwen: Would you excuse us for just a minute?",
        "Rosanna: Sure, sure.",
        "Alison: Oh, hi. She gets more and more adorable every day.",
        "Will: You mean every second.",
        "Alison: I stand corrected.",
        "Gwen: We're really glad that the two of you came together.",
        "Aaron: Well, we didn't --",
        "Alison: What's up?",
        "Gwen: Well, there's that something we want to ask the two of you.",
        "Will: Yeah. We've been thinking about this day for a long time. And we're really happy that we're here. You know, we feel really lucky, because having a baby a few weeks ago didn't seem even possible.",
        "Alison: And we're really happy for you guys.",
        "Aaron: Sounds like you're leading up to something.",
        "Will: A favor. A big favor.",
        "Aaron: Name it.",
        "Gwen: Will and I want the two of you to be Hallie's godparents.",
        "Will: That's the part where you say yes or no --",
        "Alison: Are you sure you want us? I mean, we're not even together anymore.",
        "Gwen: That doesn't matter at all.",
        "Alison: What about Paul and Rosanna? And Carly? I mean, they're your family.",
        "Will: So are you.",
        "Gwen: And before Hallie was even born, you guys were looking out for her, trying to protect her. And we're just hoping that the two of you might still want to do that.",
        "Aaron: I'd be honored.",
        "Alison: More than honored.",
        "Gwen: Is that a yes?",
        "Alison: Yeah, you bet!",
        "Will: That's great.",
        "Gwen: I think we need a photo over here.",
        "Rosanna: We're your people. All right, everybody just stay close together. That's great. Oh, perfect.",
        "Paul: Wait, one more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, how are you?",
        "Craig: I'm going to be fine.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Chris: Yeah. You have nothing to worry about. I'm going to go check on my dad. See you guys later.",
        "Meg: So, listen -- Jan and Lynn want to take us out for lunch to celebrate the pregnancy. You up for it?",
        "Craig: I don't think I want to intrude.",
        "Meg: What are you talking about? You're the baby's father, you're my husband -- you won't be intruding.",
        "Craig: Still, I think I do just want to take a pass.",
        "Meg: You're not feeling 100% yet, are you?",
        "Craig: No, you know, I just didn't sleep well last night. I think I really need to just go home, get some -- go, have fun with your friends, okay?",
        "Meg: Okay, okay, all right. Well, if you feel better, come down and join us. I would love to have you there. I know how much the baby means to you --",
        "Craig: Look, I'll see you later, okay? Take care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: Today, we're gathered together for a very special and sacred occasion. The baptism of this beautiful little girl. Welcoming her into our community of faith. And from what I understand, this day has been a long time coming for the Munson family.",
        "Will: Yeah, just a little.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Gwen: Come on, Will.",
        "Minister: Its okay -- laughter through love, through your faith and commitment in one another is a wonderful thing to see, and to teach your child. Will and Gwen, do you desire for your child to be baptized? If so, please answer, \"We do.\"",
        "Will/Gwen: We do.",
        "Minister: It will be your duty to teach your child, so that she may not be led astray. To restrain her from evil associates and habits. Nurturing a child is not only the duty of the parents, but the responsibility of the entire family.

        "Gwen: We just -- we didn't think that you would come.",
        "Sofie: Well, I wasn't going to. But you guys were so sweet to invite me and want to include me, I didn't feel right not being here.",
        "Gwen: We would've understood. Really.",
        "Sofie: That's a beautiful christening gown.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah, it's the same one her cousins wore when they were baptized.",
        "Rosanna: Hello.",

        "Paul: Hi.",

        "Paul: Rosanna and I don't have any children.",
        "Sofie: Oh, but you said the gown --",
        "Gwen: It was my sister. It was her kids.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry. So, does that mean you're Hallie's godparents?",
        "Paul: No, we weren't asked. Unless you were asked. Were you asked?",
        "Rosanna: No, I don't think so.",
        "Paul: Which means I get to give you a hard time about it for a long, long time.",
        "Will: Or you could just take it out on Hallie by spoiling her rotten.",
        "Paul: I could do that, too.",

        "Meg: Jan!",
        "Nurse Jan: I'm just trying to live vicariously. And besides, all I know about Craig Montgomery is what I hear with hospital gossip.",
        "Meg: Yeah, which -- none of it is very flattering, right? Please don't base your opinion on that. Craig -- well, let's just say there's more to Craig than people see.",
        "Nurse Jan: Well, I want to see it. Give him a call and tell him to come down.",

        "Nurse Jan: Meg's getting Craig to join us.",
        "Nurse #2: Excellent.",
        "Meg: Please come.",
        "Craig: Meg.",
        "Meg: Listen, I have been talking you up to the girls, and they really want to meet you. And besides, I kind of miss you. Craig, you okay? Do you want me to come upstairs?",
        "Craig: No. No, I'm fine. I'll be down in a couple minutes.",

        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah. We didn't even know they were going to ask us until we got here.",

        "Sofie: That's -- that's great.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Will and I are headed back to the house now. Do you guys want to come?",
        "Alison: You bet. I have like a trunk full of gifts to give my goddaughter. Wow. That really sounds weird to say.",
        "Gwen: Sofie, you want to come?",
        "Sofie: Oh, that's really nice of you, but I still feel kind of wiped out. I think I'm just going to go back to my motel and lie down for awhile.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Will and I still think that you should stay at the Lakeview. So whenever you want to do that, you just let us know. We'll make it happen.",
        "Sofie: I will. I will, definitely. Thank you.",
        "Aaron: Are you okay getting back to the Wagon Wheel? Can I maybe give you a ride?",
        "Sofie: No, no, I'm fine. Go. Have a good time.",
        "Alison: Hey, Godfather -- are you coming? Aaron, she might just want to be left alone right now.",

        "Meg: Okay, I was wondering what that was.",
        "Nurse Jan: Well, wonder no more. [Laughter] We snuck it out of the maternity ward.",
        "Meg: You stole a training doll from the hospital?",
        "Nurse Jan: We didn't really steal it. We're just letting you borrow it for awhile.",

        "Craig: Is that supposed to be funny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: What are you doing here? You're supposed to be going back to the house with Will and Gwen.",
        "Aaron: The party will go on without me.",
        "Sofie: You are the godfather, you're part of the celebration.",
        "Aaron: I saw your face when you heard about me and Ali being her godparents. Are you okay with this?",
        "Sofie: Of course. Of course, I am, Aaron, I think it's -- I think it's great. You've always been there for me and my -- for Hallie. I don't think they could've picked a better guy for the job. Not that my opinion matters.",
        "Aaron: Why would you say that?",
        "Sofie: 'Cause it's the way it is. Hallie's not my little girl anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What is wrong with you?",
        "Craig: Nothing is wrong with me. What kind of a question is that?",
        "Meg: A very reasonable one, considering the way you're acting.",
        "Craig: I am fine. I am never better. I have seen more clearer than ever before.",
        "Meg: Oh, so you are well aware that everybody is staring at you?",
        "Craig: Yeah, they're looking at me. Do you know why? Because they know what I have, and they're envious. I have a beautiful wife and she's pregnant with my child. Who wouldn't want to be me?",
        "Meg: The way you just said that, it doesn't sound like you do.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's -- that's silly talk. I love my life. Ladies, you are looking at the man who has it all, and this -- this is the gorgeous woman who gave it to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Where should I put this?",
        "Will: Ali, you went overboard. You brought too much stuff.",

        "Gwen: I love her. I love who Will and I are now that we have her.",
        "Rosanna: I mean, do you feel more comfortable about adopting? I know you were worried about is because of your own experiences.",
        "Gwen: You know what? I actually -- I didn't tell Will this, but I was worried that it wouldn't feel the same, that she would feel like somebody else's, not mine. But, I know the first time I held her in my arms in this house, I knew that she was ours, that she was the baby that Will and I had been waiting for all along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Was it a nice ceremony?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, it was.",

        "Sofie: More than anything.",
        "Aaron: But?",
        "Sofie: I don't know -- in my head, I know I made the right decision -- giving her up for adoption. I know that, I know that. When she's right there in front of me, every bone in my body is screaming, \"That's your little girl. Look at her, hold her.\"",
        "Aaron: That must've been tough.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, that's why I'm not going back to the house. It's hard enough being here.",
        "Aaron: Do you wish you hadn't come here?",
        "Sofie: No, no, no. You know, I can't keep doing this -- showing up, trying to be part of her life, at least not right now, for my own sake.",
        "Aaron: Let me give you a ride home, please?",
        "Sofie: No. No, I want to -- I want to stay here for a little while, by myself.",
        "Aaron: Okay, okay.",
        "Sofie: Aaron? If I can't watch over my little girl, I am so glad that she has you.",

        "Meg: Hey, maybe we should go up to the room.",
        "Craig: No, we haven't even had dessert yet. Maybe the baby is hungry?",
        "Meg: The baby's fine.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's right. Mama always knows best. Hey, you know, I had a baby born in Memorial a few years ago named Johnny.",
        "Meg: Craig.",
        "Craig: Were either of you working there back then?",
        "Nurse Jan: No.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's too bad, 'cause all the nurse's -- they just loved him. He was a handsome little fella, looked just like his father. That would be me, his dad. Anyway, you would know him if you saw him. I haven't seen him in a while. My daughter, Lucy, took Johnny from me, and then she just ran off with him.",
        "Meg: You know, I think they've heard enough. We all have.",
        "Nurse Jan: You know, Meg, it's okay.",
        "Nurse #2: Oh, we really should be getting back to the hospital.",

        "Nurse Jan: Anytime.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Bye.",
        "Craig: That was pretty rude. They invite you to lunch and then they stick you with the bill.",
        "Meg: Are you happy now?",
        "Craig: Me?",
        "Meg: You made a fool out of the both of us, and you chased my friends off.",
        "Craig: You're saying that they left because of me?",
        "Meg: Oh, I think that's pretty much an understatement at this point. And will you stop playing with this thing!",
        "Craig: What is that, Meg? Practice? For when you take my baby away from me?",
        "Meg: I don't know what has gotten into you, but it's got to stop now.",
        "Craig: Are you gonna yell at me like this in front of the baby?",
        "Meg: This is not your child! Why are you trying to pick a fight with me?",
        "Craig: This is very nice of your friends to give you this. Is this so we can practice being a family?",
        "Meg: I'm not gonna do this.",
        "Craig: No, no, 'cause I think that we can pull it off. Seriously, I mean, look at this little fella. Is he the spitting image of his father or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Thank you for listening to me.",
        "Minister: Sofie, I think what you've done is remarkably kind and selfless. Very few people can say they helped create a family for somebody else.",
        "Sofie: Will my little girl think of it that way when she's older? If she thought I didn't want her, it would break my heart.",
        "Minister: Knowing Will and Gwen -- what kinds of things do you think they'll say to Hallie about you?",
        "Sofie: They'll tell her that I loved her.",
        "Minister: What you need to do is find comfort in the fact that you made the right decision for everyone involved, including yourself.",
        "Will: Ali, thank you again for agreeing to be the godmother.",
        "Alison: Oh, it was the best and easiest decision I've ever made.",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "Will: I got her.",
        "Gwen: Yeah?",
        "Will: See you later.",
        "Gwen: Hey, are you okay doing this with Aaron?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I think it'll be a nice change to share something happy with him. You know?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I mean, you guys were getting along really well at the church. I don't know, are you having second thoughts about ending things with him?",
        "Alison: No. What we had is definitely over. But we'll always be friends. Good friends.",
        "Gwen: Ooh, careful. That's all I thought Will and I would be. Now he's my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I've never been very good at asking for help or for guidance -- but you know that. I've gone down the wrong path too many times. And I've hurt the people that I love in the process. I spent so many nights praying for their forgiveness, or understanding. This is different. I'm not being selfish this time. I'm not here for me. I'm here for my children. And so I'm asking you -- in the only way that I know how to -- just give me a little more time. I just want to see them happy. I want them to find a way to forgive me before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Who is the cutest little girl in the whole world? You are. Yes, you are. Look. She's smiling at me.",
        "Gwen: Yeah? Oh, no Sweetie. That's just gas.",
        "Will: You know how I said that I only had room for one woman in my life?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Because I am that woman.",
        "Will: Well, I think I'm going to have to amend that.",
        "Gwen: And I'll let you. Just this once.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You are being ridiculous. Did you take your medication? You feel warm.",
        "Craig: I asked you a question. Does the baby look like his father? Because I think he does.",
        "Meg: You've been drinking. You're not supposed to drink with that medication.",
        "Craig: Oops. There's something wrong with the hair, but I think we can fix that. I definitely think that we could pass for father and son.",
        "Meg: It's a doll. He doesn't have a father. So let's put it down and let's go upstairs, all right? Come on.",
        "Craig: Oh. Oh, no, no. I know. Oh, let's ask Paul and Rosanna. Let's see what they have to say.",
        "Rosanna: Paul, let's go -- I don't want a scene.",
        "Craig: Pauly, Pauly, I am so glad that you're here. I need your opinion on something, all right? Would you take a look at this?",
        "Meg: Craig, Craig, please don't.",
        "Paul: Get that out of my face!",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no, seriously. I just want to know. I mean, do you think that this baby looks like me or what? Because I think it looks like a chip off the old block. Don't you?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Craig: I want to hear you say that the doll --",
        "Rosanna: Stop it! This has gone far enough.",
        "Chris: I'm not letting that guy get near anyone I care about.",
        "Dusty: If you tell me you love Chris, I'll tell you you're lying.",
        "Emily: What do you want me to say? I love you, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: I was with Emily.",
        "Lily: Did you run into her?",
