        "Carly is none too happy to see Craig at her door. He comes bearing a gift for Parker's birthday. She quips that Craig should have saved his money. Parker hasn't even opened his Christmas one yet, so she doubts he will want this one either. And trying to buy her son's attention isn't going to score any points with her either. Take a hint! Jack nixes Parker practicing his driving today now that he is 16 and has a license. Jack warns the weather is bad and a lot of black ice out there. He tells him the only ice they are going to deal with is at the hockey rink. So go get his gear and meet him. Parker returns home and also is nonplussed by Craig being there even with a gift. But frowns turn to an almost smile when Craig hands him the keys to his car so Parker can drive to practice. Lucy tells Alison they found a match for Johnny. It's Katie. They must tell Katie the truth that it is for Johnny, but swear her to secrecy. Lucy will not let her father get his hands on Johnny. Dusty is cool to Josie as he sees her buying into Paul's garbage. She tells him it's not bunk; she has seen Johnny and he's in Oakdale. Carly actually offers Craig some food and they head for Metro. He knows she does nothing for free. He offers advice that if she really put her mind to it, she could turn this club into something more than a cafeteria. She admits she put too much focus on her kids and trying to get Jack back and it didn't work out. He says he could help her with some of those long, lonely nights. He reminds her that when she is hit, she hits back. She's a prize fighter and doesn't give up until she's won the title. Dusty asks questions at the Lakeview and although Lucy is not registered there, Alison is and he pounds on her door until she answers. She denies everything, but finally has to produce Johnny. Dusty is happy to see his son, though the little boy wants nothing to do with him. He wants Alison to explain more about the bone marrow transplant. He knows it is for Johnny. Alison tells him they have found a donor. Dusty wants to take Johnny and run, but Lucy spells out the risks. He wants all the details and says he is Johnny's dad and he is calling the shots now. Parker takes Liberty along on his joy ride. When they stop, the car won't start up again. They rely on the good old make-out session of kissing to keep warm. Both Jack and Carly are furious at Craig for loaning the car to Parker. He's going to put out an APB for the car and tells Craig to stay away from his kid. Jack gets Parker on his cell phone and tells him he is in a heap of trouble. Now walk home ASAP. Then he gives him a lecture of not going behind his back to get what he wants from Craig. He'll be lucky to see the inside of a car before spring. Craig checks with the hospital to see if any new accident victims have come in. While there he spots Alison with Katie and has suspicions of why they are huddled together and Katie is giving blood. Lucy, Dusty and Johnny head to the hospital. Dusty thanks Josie and says he did not believe her, but she came through for him and he owes her."

        "Craig: The part where I'm supposed to believe you mean it.",
        "Carly: I do mean it. Go away.",
        "Craig: But you haven't asked why I'm here.",
        "Carly: Because I don't care.",
        "Craig: I have a gift.",
        "Carly: I don't want anything from you.",
        "Craig: It's not for you. It's for Parker.",
        "Carly: Parker?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. Didn't he just turn 16? My gosh, they grow up so fast, don't they?",
        "Carly: You should've saved your money. He hasn't even opened your Christmas present. You should take that as a hint.",
        "Craig: He'll come around.",
        "Carly: You know, trying to buy my son's affection is not going to score you any points with me.",
        "Craig: But this has nothing to do with you. I happen to like Parker. It's his birthday, I wanted to do something to mark the occasion.",
        "Carly: Okay, well I will tell him that you stopped by, and that you left.",
        "Craig: What are you afraid of? That he might actually remember that he and I were friends at one point?",
        "Carly: He was 8. He didn't know any better.",
        "Craig: Well now he's 16. Why don't we let him make up his own mind about me?",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, I'd like to. But honestly, Craig, he's not here.",
        "Craig: Oh, I don't mind. I can wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: No, I traded shifts. Parker has hockey practice. Yeah, I know, yesterday. 16. Can you believe it? Don't worry, I can still skate circles around him.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: All right, Margo. Oh, here he is. All right, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Where's your stuff?",
        "Parker: Forget about hockey.",
        "Jack: Forget about -- forget about hockey?",
        "Parker: Well, you want to skip practice, and go driving instead?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Parker: Why not? I have my license now.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know, I know. And I'm very proud of you, it's a very exciting time for you. Unfortunately, the weather's taken a turn for the worse. There's a lot of black ice out there.",
        "Parker: So? Aren't I supposed to learn how to drive in all different kinds of conditions?",
        "Jack: Not tonight. The only practicing you're gonna be doing on any kind of ice is that rink. Now go home and grab your stuff. I'll meet you there.",
        "Parker: Fine. But don't get mad at me if I'm late. It's a long walk to the rink.",
        "Jack: Oh, I know. Poor Parker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I really don't have time for this, okay?",
        "Craig: Oh, you have things to do? Clothes to wash, counters to scrub?",
        "Carly: I have no interest in being your friend.",
        "Craig: I sure would love a cup of coffee.",
        "Carly: You can go to Java. Its five minutes away.",
        "Craig: Boy, you changed. You used to be so much more hospitable.",
        "Carly: Forgive me. I forget, do you like your coffee with one scoop of drain cleaner or two?",
        "Craig: Surprise me.",
        "Carly: And then you'll go?",
        "Craig: Unless you can find a good reason for me to stay.",
        "Carly: I sincerely doubt that'll happen.",
        "Craig: Well, there's the birthday boy!",
        "Parker: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: I came by to give you this.",
        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Craig: You're not going to open it now?",
        "Parker: I sure will. But later.",
        "Craig: You know, you might actually like it. I'm not completely clueless about what might appeal to your generation.",
        "Parker: You know what would appeal to me? Having the same privileges as all the other kids my age.",
        "Craig: Privileges, such as?",
        "Parker: Driving. But my dad won't let me.",
        "Craig: Ah, the freedom of the open road. Do you have your license?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I just got it.",
        "Craig: Okay, then. There you go.",
        "Parker: Are you serious?",
        "Craig: Wear the seat belt, use the turn signals, and obey the speed limit.",
        "Parker: Yeah, of course. Thank you, Craig.",
        "Craig: Any time. Parker? Happy birthday.",
        "Carly: Was that Parker?",
        "Craig: Yeah, he just stopped by to pick something up.",
        "Carly: Oh.",
        "Craig: Is it safe?",
        "Carly: Ah. Only one way to find out. Here's to your health.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: How's Johnny?",
        "Alison: He's been down for about a half hour.",
        "Lucy: Does he still have a fever?",
        "Alison: No. Lucy, the studio keeps getting calls about people who want to be tested. What are we going to do?",
        "Lucy: Nothing. I just got off the phone with the lab. We found a match for Johnny.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God -- who? Who is it?",
        "Lucy: It's Katie.",
        "Josie: I've been trying get in touch with you. Didn't you get my messages?",
        "Dusty: I did.",
        "Josie: Why didn't you call me back?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause you made your choice, and I made mine.",
        "Josie: Okay, what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Dusty: You bought into Paul's garbage. I let it go.",
        "Josie: That's what I need to talk to you about. It's not garbage.",
        "Dusty: Don't defend your boss to me, all right?",
        "Josie: I'm not here for Paul. I'm here for Johnny. I know where he is.",
        "Dusty: Lions, parachutes, and airplanes -- let me guess. He's skydiving into Africa?",
        "Josie: Would you just listen to me, Donovan? They're here. Lucy and Johnny -- they're in Oakdale.",
        "[Clock ticking]",
        "Dusty: Lucy and Johnny are in Oakdale. When did Paul say that?",
        "Josie: He didn't. I saw them. I spoke to them, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: You spoke to them?",
        "Josie: Yes. In Old Town. They're here. They're hiding in plain sight.",
        "Dusty: Here we go, another Ryan set-up.",
        "Josie: No, he didn't do this. It's real. It's them.",
        "Dusty: You don't even know what Lucy looks like.",
        "Josie: After they left, I went to the hospital. And I looked up her photograph in a staff directory. It's her.",
        "Dusty: And Johnny was with her?",
        "Josie: Yes.",
        "Dusty: No. Why would they be here?",
        "Josie: Because Johnny's sick.",
        "Dusty: How do you know that?",
        "Josie: I'm only telling you what Lucy told me.",
        "Dusty: No, she wouldn't offer that kind of information to a stranger.",
        "Josie: Do you remember the little boy that came up to me at the Lakeview, the one that called me mommy? That's him, that's Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Why should I believe you?",
        "Josie: Because it's the truth. He had a lion, Dusty. A little stuffed animal that he brings with him everywhere.",
        "Dusty: And you think that's the lion Paul was talking about.",
        "Josie: Maybe. If he's right about this, then he might be right about Johnny being in danger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: It's going to be okay, Johnny. We found someone who's going to make it all better.",
        "Alison: Lucy, just because Katie's a match, that doesn't mean she'll do it.",
        "Lucy: No, she will. She knows better than anyone what a transplant can do. She donated part of her liver to Margo.",
        "Alison: But, can you trust her to keep who she's doing it for a secret?",
        "Lucy: Maybe we could get her to consent to the procedure without telling her who the recipient is.",
        "Alison: She already knows who it is, or thinks she does. Remember that whole story about my friend's little girl? If she thinks she's doing it for her, there's no way she's not going to want to talk about it on her show.",
        "Lucy: We can't let her do that, Alison. It would ruin everything we've been trying to accomplish.",
        "Alison: I have an idea. But you're not going to like it.",
        "Lucy: No, it's okay, tell me. I'll do anything.",
        "Alison: I think we have to tell Katie the truth. I think we have to tell her the transplant is for Johnny, and that she has to keep that from Craig at all costs.",
        "Lucy: But what if she won't agree to that?",
        "Alison: Then we'll tell her that it's the only way to save Johnny's life. Then she won't have a choice. I know it's a risk, because Craig is her brother --",
        "Lucy: I can't let my father get his hands on Johnny.",
        "Alison: That won't happen. Katie will understand, I know she will. Do you want me to talk to her?",
        "Lucy: No. No, I'll do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker didn't want this, huh?",
        "Craig: Sure, but you know kids today. They're in such a hurry. He'll open it later.",
        "Carly: I know what you're trying to do. And it's not going to work.",
        "Craig: I'm not doing anything.",
        "Carly: Just don't mess with my kids, Craig. You won't know what hit you.",
        "Craig: Ooh. This mama lion thing is kind of a turn-on.",
        "Carly: Oh God, why do you do that? Why do you have to turn everything into some kind of game?",
        "Craig: Oh, you want me to say it? Okay, fine. I have no one left to care about except a 16-year-old boy who, like everyone else, can barely tolerate me.",
        "Carly: Whose fault is that?",
        "Craig: Oh, I know. I brought it on myself. I have reaped what I have sown. I buried one child, I ran the other two off. But you know what, Carly? Since the moment Lucy took Johnny, my life, my very existence, has been about finding them, and finding ways to make up for the things I've done to them, and their mothers.",
        "Carly: You mean, in between marrying Meg and trying to blow up Paul?",
        "Craig: I have spent the last year of my life trying to track them down, but for what? Because with each passing day, the whole quest only seems to grow more pointless. They don't want to be found. Not by me -- their father. I am exactly what everyone wants me to be. Alone. So, if giving some stupid video game in a fleeting attempt to have some connection with another human being -- if that's a bad thing, then tell me. Because I'll stop. Well, thank you for the coffee. It was very neighborly.",
        "Carly: Hey. Would you like some food to go with that coffee?",
        "Craig: I could eat.",
        "Carly: It's on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Damn it, Parker.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Pretty cool, huh?",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Liberty: Yep, you've got some pretty cool driving skills.",
        "Parker: Better than you, that time in the woods.",
        "Liberty: Oh, brag about it why don't you. Just keep bragging.",
        "Parker: Just admit it -- you're impressed.",
        "Liberty: By the car, maybe. So -- what do we do now?",
        "Parker: I don't know. What do people usually do in parked cars?",
        "Liberty: I don't know.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Liberty: Hey, they put their cell phones on vibrate?",
        "Parker: What phone?",
        "Liberty: What phone, what? Hey, you have to pick that up, don't you?",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Parker: Nope.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: This boy that you saw --",
        "Josie: Johnny.",
        "Dusty: How does he look? Does he look sick?",
        "Josie: No, he looks happy. Tired, maybe. A little frail.",
        "Dusty: No. Nope, I'm not buying into this.",
        "Josie: Why would Lucy bring him back here if he weren't sick? Think about it, Dusty, it makes sense.",
        "Dusty: Where are they?",
        "Josie: I saw Johnny in the elevator at the Lakeview. I took him to the front desk, the clerk made a call, and then he took him back upstairs.",
        "Dusty: No. If she was here, I would know.",
        "Josie: Not necessarily. After all of this time, don't you think that Lucy has learned a few things about keeping a low profile?",
        "Dusty: She wouldn't risk it.",
        "Josie: She would if she really had to. And I think she really had to. Dusty, he looks just like her. He looks just like Jennifer.",
        "Dusty: That's enough. That's -- enough.",
        "Josie: I get it that you don't want to believe me. But there's a very easy way to find out if I'm right about this.",
        "Dusty: There'd better be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So, how is the old Metro doing? You know, when I owned this joint, it was a pretty happening place.",
        "Carly: Uh, it's -- its okay.",
        "Craig: Just \"Okay?\"",
        "Carly: Well, to be honest, business is not that great. And whatever I do make, I have to split 50/50 with Henry, because we're partners here. So --",
        "Craig: Would you like a little advice?",
        "Carly: From -- you?",
        "Craig: Well, I have been known to be a fairly sharp businessman.",
        "Carly: Among other things.",
        "Craig: Do you want it or not? At least it's free.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig. I know you better than that. You don't do anything for free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I thought you wanted to go driving.",
        "Parker: This is better.",
        "Liberty: We have to stop.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Liberty: Because it's freezing and I'm cold. And I'm kind of starting to think, if we stay here a little longer, a murderer is going to come out of the woods and hack us into little pieces.",
        "Parker: That actually happened for real a few summers ago.",
        "Liberty: What -- what -- what did?",
        "Parker: The whole slasher-in-the-woods thing. It happened.",
        "Liberty: Oh, shut up.",
        "Parker: I'm serious.",
        "Liberty: Start the car now. I'm cold. Please.",
        "[Starter revving]",
        "Liberty: Oh, funny. Wow. \"Car won't start, ha-ha.\" Good one.",
        "Parker: I'm not trying to be funny. It won't start.",
        "Liberty: You're such an amateur. Let me try.",
        "Parker: Fine, have at it. You were saying?",
        "Liberty: Damn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What do we have here?",
        "Carly: Gourmet ham and cheese.",
        "Craig: Mmm. With potato chips. Do I get a glass of milk with that, too?",
        "Carly: If you behave.",
        "Craig: You know, Carly, if you applied yourself, you could turn this club into something more than a cafeteria.",
        "Carly: I guess, honestly, my focus has not been on business lately.",
        "Craig: You don't say. Don't get defensive. I'm just having a civilized conversation over cheddar and pork. So, where has your focus been?",
        "Carly: My kids.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Carly: It hasn't been easy for them lately, you know? They -- they really had their hearts set on things working out between Jack and me. And -- the reality of accepting it was difficult.",
        "Craig: Difficult for them, you mean? Because it was so final?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Craig: And for you too, I would imagine.",
        "Carly: What are you getting at?",
        "Craig: I think you would feel a lot better if you just came out and said it.",
        "Carly: Okay. I wanted things to work out with Jack even more than they did. Okay, I've said it. Do you -- do you feel better? Are you happy?",
        "Craig: I'm never happy if you're sad.",
        "Carly: It's just, some nights, after the children go to bed, that house can be so quiet.",
        "Craig: I could help with that, if you want. Do away with some of those long, lonely nights.",
        "Carly: You know, Craig, when you come onto me like that --",
        "Craig: Yeah?",
        "Carly: You make me feel worse.",
        "Craig: This isn't you, Carly. When you get hit, you hit back. And you're a prize fighter. You don't give up until you've won the title.",
        "Carly: I had the title -- I relinquished it. Maybe there's just nobody left to fight, you know?",
        "Craig: There's always someone. Don't let Jack walk away with what was so extraordinary about you.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Excuse me. Oh. Hello, Jack.",
        "Jack: Hey. Is Parker with you?",
        "Carly: I thought he had hockey practice this afternoon.",
        "Jack: Yeah, he does. And I'm freezing my tail off waiting for him to show up.",
        "Carly: I know he was just at the house. So, he can't be far.",
        "Jack: Where are you?",
        "Carly: At Metro.",
        "Jack: Call me if you hear from him.",
        "Carly: I sure will. Hmm. What is that look for?",
        "Craig: You should know -- Parker may be a little further away than you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Katie?",
        "Katie: Oh, my God -- Lucy?",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry for showing up like this.",
        "Katie: How -- where have you been? Are you okay?",
        "Lucy: I'm fine.",
        "Katie: Did anyone see you?",
        "Lucy: No, no. I was careful.",
        "Katie: What are you doing here? Where's Johnny? Is he with you?",
        "Lucy: I'll explain everything. But first, I really need you to listen to me. I know you're probably very angry with me --",
        "Katie: No. No, of course I'm not angry with you. I'm worried and scared, we all were. But now you're back. Oh, that's all that matters.",
        "Lucy: No, you don't understand, this isn't homecoming. Johnny's sick, Katie.",
        "Katie: Sick, how?",
        "Lucy: That child, that Alison was trying to find a bone marrow match for -- its Johnny.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Lucy: Katie, you can't tell anyone.",
        "Katie: Hold on -- have you found a donor?",
        "Lucy: We did. It's you.",
        "Katie: Me?",
        "Lucy: You're his aunt. Please Katie, I'm begging you, you have to help him.",
        "Katie: By donating my bone marrow?",
        "Lucy: Johnny needs this transplant or he's going to die. Will you do it?",
        "Katie: Wait, hold on. Hold on a second. Does Craig know about this?",
        "Lucy: No. And if you agree to do this, you can't tell him. Johnny's life depends on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hotel clerk: There's no Lucy Montgomery registered here. There's a Craig Montgomery.",
        "Dusty: Mm -hmm. May I take a look? Thank you.",
        "Josie: Anything?",
        "Dusty: Alison Stewart has a room here.",
        "Josie: Wait, wait, I met her. And I saw her on TV. She was talking about a sick child. She was looking for a bone marrow donor.",
        "Dusty: That's how Lucy managed to stay off the radar. Alison has my son.",
        "[Knocks at the door]",
        "Dusty: Alison, it's Dusty. Let me in.",
        "Alison: Oh, God. Okay. Johnny, I need you to do something for me. It's very important, okay? I need you to go in the bathroom, and I need you to stay there, no matter what. Okay? Can you do that?",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Dusty: Alison, I'm going to break the door down.",
        "Johnny: Where's Lulu?",
