        "Jack: Mmm. \r\nThat's a hell of a way to bring in the New Year. Making out with my wife. \n",
        "Carly: Over \r\ncoffee. You are a wild man, Jack Snyder. I think you should've gone to the \r\nhospital, honey. ",
        "Jack: No, it's \r\njust a flesh wound. ",
        "Carly: Hey, \r\nwhen a bullet plows into my husband, there is no \"just\" about it. ",
        "Jack: Hey, come \r\non. It's okay, really. ",
        "Carly: You're \r\nwounded. Arm in a sling, and you're smiling. ",
        "[Jack laughs]\r\n",
        "Jack: Tonight \r\nwas amazing. What can I say? I did what I was trained for. Got to B.J. before he \r\ncould shoot Mike. That was awesome. ",
        "Carly: Getting \r\nshot yourself. ",
        "Jack: Hey, I \r\njust did what I had to do, you know? Margo said she was going to stop by here \r\nlater. Maybe we can kick around some ideas about how we're going to catch this \r\nguy. You don't mind if we stick around, do you? ",
        "Carly: No. I \r\ndon't mind. It's been a long time since I've seen you so excited. ",
        "Jack: I would \r\ngive anything if I could help bring in B.J., I'll tell you that. Oh, Katie\u2019s \r\nhere. Maybe Margo\u2019s with her. ",
        "Carly: Can't I \r\njust be happy you're in one piece? ",
        "Jack: Hey, \r\nwife, when it comes to you being happy, there's no \"just\" about it. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Barista: You're \r\nthat guy from WOAK. The one that got rid of the bomb and everybody. This guy is \r\na hero! ",

        "Jennifer: Go \r\nsleepy so Mommy can take a shower and brush her teeth. ",
        "[Knock at the \r\ndoor] ",
        "Barbara: Hi, \r\nhoney. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nJohnny just fell asleep. ",
        "Barbara: My \r\ngrandson is so adorable. ",
        "Jennifer: You \r\nlook pretty adorable yourself. Oh, that's right. I caught the first half hour of \r\nthe telethon. You were fantastic. ",
        "Barbara: \r\nPartial. ",
        "Jennifer: No, \r\nplease, you heard the applause. They loved you. And I bet Aunt Kim was very \r\nproud of you. Did you guys go out and celebrate? ",
        "Barbara: \r\nActually I was out celebrating with someone else. ",
        "Jennifer: A guy \r\nsomeone? ",
        "Barbara: I \r\nfinished my song, walked backstage, suddenly had a date. ",
        "Jennifer: Mom! \r\nThat's fantastic. Tell me about it. ",
        "Barbara: Nigel. \r\nStockbroker. Very nice. Fabulous kisser. ",
        "Jennifer: On \r\nthe first date? ",
        "Barbara: We \r\nwere bringing in the New Year. Everybody was kissing. Oh, did I mention he was \r\nyounger? ",
        "Jennifer: How \r\nmuch younger? ",
        "Barbara: A \r\nlittle bit older than you. Would you like to meet him, Jen? ",
        "Jennifer: I \r\nthink you're trying to fix me up with your date. ",
        "Barbara: Well, \r\nthat wasn't the plan, but now that you've mentioned it. ",
        "Jennifer: Oh, \r\nmy God. You didn't go out with him for you, you were auditioning him for me.\r\n",
        "Barbara: Honey, \r\nwhat is wrong with finding a wonderful man who is good looking? ",
        "Jennifer: No, I \r\nam not going out on a date with someone -- eww -- that you kissed. ",
        "Barbara: I'm \r\nsure there's someone around who's wonderful and good looking who would love you \r\nand love to be with you. ",
        "Jennifer: Okay, \r\nwell, when you find him, will you send him to me first? ",
        "Barbara: Why \r\ndon't you call him? ",
        "Jennifer: Who?\r\n",
        "Barbara: Do you \r\nreally think I'm blind? Dusty Donovan. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Meg: It was a \r\nfew bad months, that's all. In Jen's whole life, in the baby's life. We can make \r\nit up to her. ",
        "Dusty: We?\r\n",
        "Meg: Me, okay. \r\nI'll make it up to her. I had a few weak moments and I let Paul manipulate me. \r\nBut I made it right in the end. I mean, doesn't that count for anything? \n",
        "Dusty: Get out. \r\nDid you hear me? Get out. ",
        "Meg: No. Not \r\nuntil I make you understand. ",
        "Dusty: I'm \r\ntelling you, you gotta get out of my way now. ",
        "Meg: The only \r\nway out of here is through me. And I know you won't do that, Dusty. I know you \r\nwon't hurt me. ",
        "Dusty: Hurt \r\nyou? You're giving me way too much credit now. ",
        "Meg: You'd \r\nnever hurt me. I know it! By the way you touch me. The way you hold me when we \r\nsleep. ",
        "Dusty: The \r\nwoman I thought I was holding -- the woman I moved in here with -- was kind, \r\nhonest, she told the truth. What you did to Jennifer -- ",
        "Meg: It was \r\nwrong. I know it was wrong. I know that. But come on, Dusty. Haven't you ever \r\ndone anything? Anything in your life where you were ashamed of it? Something you \r\nwould give your right arm for to change? ",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I \r\nwish I never got started with you again. Does that count? ",
        "Meg: I know it \r\nwas wrong to keep the truth from Jennifer. She should have had her baby, and he \r\nneeded her. She had every right to know that her baby was alive. ",
        "Dusty: You kept \r\nit a secret. ",
        "Meg: But I \r\ncouldn't live with the secret. I'm not like Paul and Emily. It kept eating at \r\nme. Even though she never would have known, I couldn't see Jennifer suffer \r\nanymore. And that's why I had to do something. Because of me, Jennifer has her \r\nbaby back. ",
        "Dusty: Months \r\nlater! This went on for months, Meg. Why did you lie to me? Why'd you lie to \r\nme?! ",
        "Meg: I didn't \r\nset out to. I set out to tell you the truth. Both of you. ",
        "Dusty: But you \r\ndidn\u2019t. So whose fault is it? Whose fault is it that you didn't tell the truth?\r\n",
        "Meg: Yours.\r\n",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emily: That's \r\nit? You just walk away? ",
        "Paul: Emily, \r\nthere isn't anything I can say or do now that'll make this any better. \n",
        "[Gun shot]\r\n",
        "Emily: Son of a \r\n-- I don't know! I don't know! I don't know what I just did! I'm -- you were \r\nwalking away from me and I didn't want you to walk away! Please tell me I didn't \r\nhurt you! Turn around and tell me you're okay! Please, Paul! Oh, God. Oh, no! \r\nNo, no, no, no! Oh, God! ",
        "[ Emily sobbing \r\n]\u00a0 ",
        "Emily: No! Open \r\nyour eyes. Oh, please! Thank God, thank God. Look at me, please. Don't ever \r\nclose your eyes again, because I couldn't stand it if anything ever happened to \r\nyou. Please don't leave me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. \r\nPaul, please! Yes, my love. I'm right here. I'm here! ",
        "Paul: Why?\r\n",
        "Emily: You are \r\nmy perfect one. ",
        "Paul: Why?\r\n",
        "Emily: You are \r\nmy perfect one and I thought that's what I was to you. I thought I was your \r\neverything. I thought you loved me. Oh, God. Oh, God, no. Oh, God. Paul? Paul? \r\nOh, God, look at me! No, God no! Look at me! Please open your eyes! Oh, God, \r\nopen your eyes! Please! Oh, God! Oh, God! ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Jennifer: Mom, \r\nthere is only room for one person in my life right now, and that's my son. \r\nBesides, you don't even like Dusty. ",
        "Barbara: Well, \r\nit's true he can be cold, distant. ",
        "Jennifer: He is \r\nnot. There was a time where I wasn't sure if I could go on, and Dusty, he would \r\njust show up and he would let me talk and cry. And he would just be there for \r\nme. ",
        "Barbara: A man \r\nof few words. Don't you find that unnerving? ",
        "Jennifer: He \r\nhelped me find Johnny. And he believed in me when no one else would. What do you \r\nmean \"of few words\"? We can talk for hours. ",
        "Barbara: So \r\ncall him. ",
        "Jennifer: No.\r\n",
        "Barbara: Can \r\nyou hear yourself here? You're telling me you care about him. You know that he \r\ncares about you, so just pick up the phone and call him. ",
        "Jennifer: I \r\ncan\u2019t. I told him we couldn't be together. ",
        "Barbara: Well, \r\ntell him that you changed your mind. Tell him that you were crazy or blind. Or \r\ncry, for Pete\u2019s sake. That doesn't work under certain circumstances. ",
        "Jennifer: You \r\nwould know. ",
        "Barbara: Call \r\nhim, Jennifer. ",
        "Jennifer: No, \r\nMom. I'm not doing it. Dusty belongs with someone else now. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Dusty: How did \r\nI stop you from telling the truth? Look at me. How? ",
        "Meg: I saw you.\r\n",
        "Dusty: You \r\nwhat? ",
        "Meg: In \r\nFlorida, when I went down to Tampa to tell you that Jennifer -- her baby was \r\nalive and that I had proof. I wanted to give you that so badly. And then --\r\n",
        "Dusty: You saw \r\nme. ",
        "Meg: In Jen's \r\nhotel room. I was going to knock on the door. Then I heard you with her. \n",
        "Dusty: You were \r\nspying on me. ",
        "Meg: I told you \r\nwhy I came down there. To give you what you've both been searching for. I didn't \r\nexpect to see what I saw. You both were -- ",
        "Dusty: Right. \r\nWell, you should've stuck around. You took off too soon. Nothing happened.\r\n",
        "Meg: I know. I \r\nknow. I heard Jennifer say she couldn't until she had her baby. She didn't feel \r\nlike a whole person. And she couldn't be with you. I know how it sounds. \n",
        "Dusty: So \r\nbecause of that, you buried the proof? Because you were afraid that Jennifer was \r\ngoing to steal me away from you? ",
        "Meg: I didn't \r\nknow what to think. Especially after everything that Paul said. ",
        "Dusty: I don't \r\ncare what that loser said! Admit what you did! You knew for months about \r\nJennifer\u2019s baby. For months! You had the proof in your hands! ",
        "Meg: I love \r\nyou! I wanted us to have a chance! ",
        "Dusty: What \r\nabout Jennifer and her baby? ",
        "Meg: She has \r\nwhat she wants. She has her baby. ",
        "Dusty: What \r\nabout me? Do you understand? What about me?! The way I wanted things to go down!\r\n",
        "Meg: We're \r\ngood, Dusty. We're good. I mean, with Jennifer, you were her protector. It was \r\nall about the baby. With us, it's the total package. We made a home here \r\ntogether. We've been happy here. ",
        "Dusty: Yeah, \r\nyou're right. ",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "[Applause]\r\n",
        "Nick: Thanks, I \r\nreally appreciate this. ",
        "Carly: Like he \r\ndid it all himself. ",
        "Nick: It's not \r\nlike I saved the TV station all by myself. ",
        "Jack: You see, \r\nit's not as bad as you thought. ",
        "Carly: He's \r\ngoing to talk about what you did. ",
        "Nick: This \r\nlovely lady right here can attest to the fact that she and everybody else \r\ncould've been blown to bits if not for the help of someone else. Someone we \r\nshould all give thanks to. Who risked everything. ",
        "Carly: Get \r\nready to take your bow. ",
        "Jack: Honey, \r\nit's not about that. ",
        "Nick: The real \r\nhero tonight is my cousin Mike. He got himself out of a hospital bed, ignored \r\nthe pain of his busted up ribs, to save his true love. Miss Katie Peretti.\r\n",
        "[Applause]\r\n",
        "Jack: I'm going \r\nto go wash my hands. ",
        "Carly: You \r\npompous moron. Jack may be too nice to tell you off, but I'm certainly not.\r\n",
        "Carly: You \r\nreally think you're something else, don't you? ",
        "Nick: The lady \r\nwith the flat tire. Did you ever get to where you wanted to go? ",
        "Carly: No \r\nthanks to you. ",
        "Nick: I offered \r\nto give you some help. You sent me away. ",
        "Carly: You were \r\nobnoxious. You may as well have called me a bimbo. ",
        "Nick: Didn't I \r\napologize for that? ",
        "Carly: You \r\nought to apologize for being the kind of guy who even thinks such a thing.\r\n",
        "Nick: Then I \r\napologize for being the kind of guy who thinks that kind of things. ",
        "Carly: Are you \r\nalways this incredibly irritating? ",
        "Nick: You \r\nmisjudge me. ",
        "Carly: Do I? \r\nNo. No, you were a jerk when I met you and you've done nothing to prove me \r\nwrong. ",
        "Nick: You are \r\nsuch a tough lady to impress, but I like that. I prefer a woman with a little \r\nspunk. ",
        "Katie: Look at \r\nall this free stuff. I guess heroes get whatever they want. ",
        "Nick: Not \r\nnecessarily. ",
        "Katie: Hi \r\nCarly. ",
        "Carly: Hi \r\nKatie. ",
        "Katie: Do you \r\ntwo know each other? ",
        "Carly: No.\r\n",
        "Nick: Yes. \r\nWell, we haven't formerly been introduced. ",
        "Katie: Okay. \r\nCarly Snyder, this is Nick Kasnoff. ",
        "Carly: Right, \r\nthat's Mike's cousin. I think I've heard something about that. ",
        "Nick: Are you \r\nrelated to Jack Snyder? ",
        "Carly: I'm his \r\nwife. ",
        "Nick: Wife, \r\nright. You mentioned you were married. ",
        "Katie: Well, \r\nyou must know Jack, right. You're a cop and he's a -- ",
        "Nick: Yeah, I'm \r\nJack's replacement. ",
        "Katie: Didn't \r\nrealize that. Sorry. ",
        "Nick: Yeah, but \r\nhe's a good guy, Jack. And he was a great cop. ",
        "Carly: He's not \r\njust a great cop. He's the best cop. And there is no way a green, arrogant \r\nhotshot like you could ever take his place. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Dusty: I was \r\nhappy here. ",
        "Meg: Because \r\nit's been wonderful. We've had so much fun putting this whole place together. \r\nBuying things. Making it our own. We laugh all the time. You bring me coffee in \r\nbed. You rub my shoulders. You smile when I walk in a room. I wish I had \r\nbelieved from the very beginning that you could love me. I believe it now.\r\n",
        "Dusty: It's too \r\nlate now. ",
        "Meg: No, come \r\non, don't say that. Everything's out in the open. We could start again. Come on, \r\nDusty. Just give me a second chance. ",
        "Dusty: You \r\nthink you deserve a chance? ",
        "Meg: I could've \r\nkept my mouth shut. Let the baby stay with Gwen. Kept you with me. But I didn't \r\nwant to see Jen suffer anymore. And I didn't want our life together to be based \r\non a lie. ",
        "Dusty: So you \r\nwaited. It didn't matter to you that Johnny was getting older by the minute, \r\nbeing raised by some woman who wasn't even his mother? ",
        "Meg: But in the \r\nend -- ",
        "Dusty: At the \r\nend, you figured out a plan to give Jennifer back her baby and keep me. It was \r\nall a bunch of lies. ",
        "Meg: Why can't \r\nyou understand, I did it because I love you! ",
        "Dusty: I'm \r\ngoing to pack up my stuff, all right? And I don't want you around when I do \r\nthat. ",
        "Meg: No, Dusty, \r\ncome on, please. ",
        "Dusty: Come on!\r\n",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm \r\nsorry. I just wanted -- this is your place now, okay? Your home. I'll go to \r\nMom\u2019s. You could just call me whenever. You know, at every point, every decision \r\nI made, I always asked myself, \"If Dusty did this, could I forgive him?\" The \r\nanswer was always yes. ",
        "Dusty: I can't \r\nforgive myself. You know why? I'm a street guy. Nobody puts one over on me. \r\nNobody but you. ",
        "Meg: Dusty.\r\n",
        "Dusty: Do you \r\nknow why? Because I had you pinned as a nice girl. Nice home. Nice life. So \r\nfinally, finally, I could be a nice guy. Now get out of here! ",

        "Jack: Okay, so \r\nhe's a showoff, so what? He took a risk. It could have ended his life and the \r\nlives of a lot of people, but it didn't happen, honey. He deserves the applause \r\nand everything that goes with it. ",
