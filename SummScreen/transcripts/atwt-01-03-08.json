        "Craig's meltdown continues in front of Meg, Paul and Rosanna. Dusty wants he and Emily to move forward, but she has other plans that don't involve him. Lily and Holden talk about New Years, as he knows that Dusty never showed up, but Lily claims he was working, and then she admits to seeing Holden with Bonnie. Meg is able to wrangle Craig upstairs after he embarrasses himself and her some more. Paul is thrilled with Craig's break, but Rosanna looks less thrilled. Emily tells Dusty that she is not leaving Chris for him and if he is looking for her to admit she loves him, it isn't going to happen. Susan and Chris talk about Bob and his impact on Bob's recovery and treatment. Dusty tells Emily that he knows she loves him deep down and he loves her. He won't give up on her because she doesn't belong with Chris. Dusty calls Lily in front of Holden and she does nothing to hide this. He asks to meet with her, as she tells him that she can't wait. Meg wonders how much Craig drank on his medication, which is dangerous, as Craig continues to babble only somewhat lucidly about not taking a medication while pregnant. Meg doesn't understand what he means. Meg thinks it is because Craig is worried about their baby possibly being sick, but Craig lets it slip that he is still mad about Paul. Meg and Craig have it out and both of them agree they don't know if it is going to continue to work if he can't get past it. Craig wants Meg to leave. Rosanna lies to Paul to go see Craig. Dusty meets with Lily and admits that he slept with Emily when he was supposed to meet her. Rosanna unleashes on Craig about almost giving up their secret. Craig admits to almost giving Meg something to cause a miscarriage. Rosanna is horrified, but reminds him that biology isn't the only factor in considering a baby one's own. Craig doesn't know if he can raise his enemy's baby. Rosanna suggests he find a way if he wants to keep Meg. Meg seeks out advice and ends up getting it from an unlikely source. Chris and Emily talk about Dusty's vendetta; Emily hides her guilty. Lily is upset to hear Dusty's confession. She is devastated that she believed they were good together, but Dusty explains that they both knew that their hearts were elsewhere, but Lily is getting more angry with him and Emily. She believed he would not abandon her and that he would always be there for her; she gave up fighting for her marriage because of him and now she has no one, as he goes back to Emily. Meg goes back to see Craig when she gets his message, but runs into Rosanna, who is forced to admit that she was visiting Craig after lying to Paul about it. Rosanna claims it was to protect Paul from Craig's relentless attacks. Lily leaves heartbroken and furious to go face Holden. Dusty admits to Emily that he told Lily the truth. Emily is furious and worries that Lily will tell Chris. She tells him again she is not going to leave Chris for him. When Lily is noticeably flustered, Holden asks what is wrong? Lily is forced to admit that she and Dusty are over. She knows how much of a mistake she made and how much she destroyed her marriage because of that. She doubts he will ever forgive her? Holden admits that he doesn't know if he can, as a tearful Lily leaves. Rosanna is worried why Paul is so obsessed with Craig's bizarre behavior. Paul promises it has nothing to do with Meg; he promises Rosanna that she is his future. Meg is confused when Craig says something strange about Rosanna and secrets. She wants their marriage to work, but he has to as well. Craig breezes by her and tells her that he is going to sleep. Meg knows there is something else going on with Craig other then the obvious and she is going to find out."

        "Craig: Look at the baby! Now, do you think he looks like the daddy? Oh, come on, Paulie, don't be shy! I really want your opinion this time.",

        "Dusty: Emily, it's me. Still not picking up, huh? I just wanted to tell you how much New Year's Eve meant to me. I just left you six messages.",
        "Emily: Well, I haven't checked my voice mail. It's been a busy day.",
        "Dusty: How about a coffee?",
        "Emily: No thanks. I'm working on a story.",
        "Dusty: About what?",
        "Emily: How people get on with their lives after New Year's.",
        "Dusty: It sounds good.",
        "Emily: Dusty, what happened between us happened.",
        "Dusty: We made love. Call it what it is.",
        "Emily: It's over. And I'm moving on.",
        "Dusty: I'm with you. Let's go to my room and do it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Holden: Oh, hey. I was just about to take down the mistletoe.",
        "Lily: Ah, yes. Another New Year's Day tradition in the Snyder family.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, it can wait. Come on in.",
        "Lily: I'm just here to pick up Ethan. And I wanted to thank your mother for watching him last night.",
        "Holden: Right, well, he's still napping. And she's at the neighbor's.",
        "Lily: Oh. So, how was your new year's?",
        "Holden: It was good. It was good.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Holden: Yours?",
        "Lily: Great. Luke told you, didn't he?",
        "Holden: Ah, yeah, he mentioned that he ran into you.",
        "Lily: He ran into me. Also that Dusty stood me up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm not going anywhere with you, Dusty. It's done. Now I have a deadline.",
        "Dusty: No, you don't.",
        "Emily: Excuse me, I'm the one who to tried to get out of my contract with the paper, and you're the one who insisted I go back to work.",
        "Dusty: We were so good together, you know? Don't deny it.",
        "Emily: Fine, I won't. But that doesn't change anything. Now I really do have to go back to work.",
        "Dusty: I got a headline for you. \"Dusty Donovan loves Emily Stewart.\"",
        "Emily: Well, see, you forgot to read the small print. \"Emily Stewart still with Chris Hughes.\" And that's where I'm going to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Listen to me. This is just a doll, okay? It doesn't look like anybody. So, could we just go upstairs now?",
        "Craig: No, I'm not done yet! You are trying to make a fool out of me!",
        "Paul: No, we are trying to have dinner. Don't bother us again.",
        "Craig: No, you didn't say good-bye to the baby!",
        "Paul: Tell me something, 'cause I'd really like to know. Could you tell me, please, how the proudest papa on the planet has turned into a raving lunatic?",
        "Craig: You think I'm a lunatic? I'm just a man in love. And love can sometimes make you crazy. It can make you see things even though you know what the truth is.",
        "Meg: He is running a fever. He doesn't know what he's saying. Can we please go upstairs and get you into bed? Please, Craig, for me?",
        "Craig: Oh, for you, my loyal wife, anything, yes. A little bundle of joy.",
        "Paul: Okay, freak show's over. Now maybe you and I can have some dinner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're staying with Chris even after last night?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I am.",
        "Dusty: What about what he did to his father?",
        "Emily: You know what? I don't want to hear anymore accusations from you about my boyfriend.",
        "Dusty: What you had with your boyfriend's a lie. He doesn't know the real you.",
        "Emily: Maybe I like the fact that he doesn't know about my past. I mean, why would he want to be with me knowing I'm damaged goods?",
        "Dusty: Is that how you think I see you?",
        "Emily: I don't know. Maybe it's the damsel in distress thing. You know, ripe to mess up, ready to save. Isn't that why you're with Lily? Because you live to rescue people, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: That doesn't even deserve a response.",
        "Emily: Good, because I gotta get going.",
        "Dusty: You are a sexy woman who's wasting her time with a kid.",
        "Emily: Chris is a man, okay? He's a good man.",
        "Dusty: Unlike me, huh? We've been through a lot of rough times. That's what love is.",
        "Emily: Not for me.",
        "Dusty: Not for you, huh? If you tell me you love Chris, I'll tell you you're lying.",
        "Emily: What do you want me to say? \"I love you, Dusty\"? Well, forget it, because you will never hear me say those words to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: It's all over the hospital. Bob had a relapse? What happened?",
        "Chris: Well, Dad woke up, he said \"Merry Christmas,\" we were monitoring him, but I was very optimistic about his progress and then Dusty showed up. And Dad got so agitated we had to sedate him.",
        "Susan: I don't understand. What do you think Dusty did?",
        "Chris: I don't know, I wasn't in the room. But my guess would be he would be grilling Dad.",
        "Susan: About what?",
        "Chris: Dusty is sure that I did something to hurt Dad. Get rid of the chief of staff so I can rise in the ranks.",
        "Susan: That's crazy. Bob had a stroke. How could you have caused that?",
        "Chris: Dusty tends to reject modern medicine in favor of conspiracy theories.",
        "Susan: I'm no fan of Dusty's, but I don't think he'd harm your father. He's always been very grateful to him for what he did for Johnny and Jennifer. And he's worked very closely with your father on Jennifer's foundation.",
        "Chris: Well, that may be, but I'm not going to chance it. I'm not letting that guy get near anyone I care about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I don't need you to tell me you love me. I already know you do, and I love you, too.",
        "Emily: You're so sure of yourself. Why would I want to be with you after you burned me so badly?",
        "Dusty: Because I'd never do it again.",
        "Emily: Wanna tell me another?",
        "Dusty: Okay, if something happens in the future that is hurtful, we'll get past it. Just like we did last night.",
        "Emily: I'll admit -- we have an intense connection.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Emily: But that kind of passion for me is a recipe for disaster, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I don't think so. I think it's a recipe for happiness. Just give it a shot. I'll prove it to you.",
        "Emily: I don't want to learn the same lesson twice. I already have enough proof you're no good. You're no good for me. I'm gonna go with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Truth is, Dusty had some work to do at the Lakeview, so I went to Metro to support Carly. Noah and Luke saw me there looking like a little wallflower.",
        "Holden: Kinda hard to look cool when you're clubbing alone, huh?",
        "Lily: Yeah, that's true. And you, rumor has it the \"Twilight Zone\" marathon didn't work out with the girls.",
        "Holden: Who ratted me out? Faith or Nat?",
        "Lily: Neither. I saw you at the Lakeview with Bonnie. She looked pretty.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, that was -- what happened was, the girls, they bailed on me last minute, so --",
        "Lily: Oh, right. Didn't want to spend New Year's Eve alone. Who can blame you?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Hey, I think we should meet.",
        "Lily: I'd really like that. Hold on one second. Could you watch Ethan for a little longer?",
        "Holden: Sure, no problem.",
        "Lily: Thanks. Can we meet at Old Town?",
        "Dusty: I'm headed there right now.",
        "Lily: Can't wait to see you. Bye. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Here you go. Here's some coffee. It'll sober you up. How many drinks did you have?",
        "Craig: Two, maybe three. Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Meg: The way you're acting. Is there something else going on?",
        "Craig: Maybe I poisoned my mind. The infection went straight to my brain.",
        "Meg: Okay, where's the medication Chris give you to take for your hand?",
        "Craig: Right there.",
        "Meg: I knew it. Didn't Chris tell you that you're not supposed to drink when you take these?",
        "Craig: It's been a busy day. Who remembers?",
        "Meg: Well, you need to read the warning labels, Craig. That's what they're there for.",
        "Craig: Danger. Danger, warning. Do not take medication if you're pregnant.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Craig: I took my pills. I'll feel better in the morning.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I doubt you'll remember any of this in the morning.",
        "Craig: Will it help me forget the rest of my troubles?",
        "Meg: What troubles? Craig? You're not still worried that our baby's gonna have Gaucher's Disease, are you? Is that why you started drinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I can't believe how drunk Craig was. What do you think got into him?",
        "Rosanna: Do we have to talk about him?",
        "Paul: He really got to you, huh?",
        "Rosanna: Well, yes. I hated seeing him attack you. That was horrible.",
        "Paul: Oh no, no, no. I thought the whole thing was funny. \"Who's the doll look like? Who's the doll look like? Tell me! Tell me!\"",
        "[Paul chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: I thought Meg and Craig were a closed subject.",
        "Paul: Well, they are, but -- I just thought that you would think it was funny, too. Okay, all right. Look, I'm sorry. Whatever Craig and Meg are going through, thank God it's got nothing to do with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Why should I be worried the child has Gaucher's disease?",
        "Meg: You're his father. It's normal to worry. Please try and remember there's a 75% chance the baby will be fine. And even then, it is treatable.",
        "Craig: Now I feel really sick.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? You'll feel better after you get some sleep. Here, let me help you undress.",
        "Craig: Ouch. Ouch!",
        "Meg: Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Didn't mean to hurt you.",
        "Craig: Little late for that, Sweetheart.",
        "Meg: So that's what this is all about? Paul and me. I thought we were past that.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, we get married. You slept with Paul. And now you're pregnant.",
        "Meg: With your son! And we have the DNA tests to prove it. Craig, I want our marriage to work. But we're never gonna make it if you can't forgive me. When you found out that I had been with Paul, I was really afraid of what you were gonna do. But you told me that you loved me, and that you wanted to have a family with me more than anything, and I believed you.",
        "Craig: Look, I meant every word. I just -- I didn't fully understand the Paul factor.",
        "Meg: But I'm done with Paul. I am fully committed to you, Craig. Why don't you believe me?",
        "Craig: Because I hate him! I hate him for what he's done to me, to us.",
        "Meg: So when you said that we never have to talk about Paul again, was that just until you were drunk or angry?",
        "Craig: All right, just please, Meg, please, just leave it alone.",
        "Meg: No, no. You know what? I will if you will. But I will not be blindsided like this, Craig. You know, it's bad enough now when I'm pregnant. What is it going to be like when the baby is here? Are you going to tear into me in front of our son? Because if that's what's going to happen, I don't think this is worth it.",
        "Craig: Actually, I am starting to think the same thing.",
        "Meg: What are you saying? I thought you wanted a second chance at being a father more than anything.",
        "Craig: No, actually, you know what? What I need right now is just to be alone, okay?",
        "Meg: No, Craig. I want to know what started this.",
        "Craig: Look, no, I am sick and I'm tired, Meg. So why don't you just leave me alone?",
        "Meg: Because I want to help you.",
        "Craig: Oh, you want to help me? Please! Then why don't you just go? Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're not eating. Is there something wrong with your food?",
        "Rosanna: I just don't have much of an appetite.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry.",
        "Rosanna: You're thinking about Craig again, aren't you?",
        "Paul: So what, now you're a mind reader? Yeah, I was thinking about Montgomery. Seeing him lose it like that is a once in a lifetime experience.",
        "Rosanna: Can you excuse me? I think I have to go to the ladies room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I have to go out, and my husband's not feeling well. So, can you hold any calls to our room for the next couple of hours so he can get some rest?",
        "Desk clerk: Of course, Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Listen, I'm really sorry. I'm not going to talk about what's his name anymore. From now on, we'll talk about whatever it is that you'd like to talk about. Your new niece. Your shoe collection.",
        "Rosanna: My massage therapist?",
        "Paul: Okay, great. What's her name?",
        "Rosanna: His name is Alexander.",
        "Paul: Should I be jealous?",
        "Rosanna: No. No, but I just checked and he has an opening in five minutes. Would you mind if I went to see him? You know, I really think it would help me relax after the whole thing with Craig.",
        "Paul: Great. You go ahead. I'm going to stay and have some dessert.",
        "Rosanna: Wow, you are positively ecstatic.",
        "Paul: Look, we took his money, we took his house, we took his company, and Craig always found a way to bounce back. Now, I don't know what got into him, but I am so glad it happened. Aren't you?",
        "Rosanna: Oh yes, yes. Certainly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: \"Hi, you've reached Meg Montgomery. Please leave a message after the beep.\"",
        "[Beep]",
        "Craig: Meg, please just come home. [Knock at door] I'm sorry -- you're back.",
        "Rosanna: Have you completely lost your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You showed up. That's a good sign. Happy New Year.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry about last night.",
        "Lily: Oh, it was probably one of the worst New Year's of my life. The highlight was when my son's boyfriend asked me to dance.",
        "Dusty: There you go.",
        "Lily: Yeah. Why didn't you call me?",
        "Dusty: I got tied up. That's a lousy excuse, but -- what can I say?",
        "Lily: I would say a lot of things. You know, a little cruise to Turks and Caicos. Maybe a weekend in Paris would make up for it.",
        "Dusty: I doubt you'd want to spend that kind of time with me. Lily, we gotta talk.",
        "Lily: About what?",
        "Dusty: Let's go somewhere else.",
        "Lily: No, no, just say it. Why don't you just say it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I'm sorry, Chris, I don't agree. And I don't think your father would approve of your being his primary physician.",
        "Chris: Well then, we'll agree to disagree.",
        "Susan: Confidence is a wonderful thing. But you have to know when to ask for help. Your father knows that. That's what makes him so great at his job.",
        "Chris: Do you really usually talk to your boss like this?",
        "Susan: I talk to your father like this. I have trouble keeping my mouth shut.",
        "Emily: Oh boy, is my mother being judgmental and opinionated?",
        "Susan: Why me? You know me better than that.",
        "Chris: What does my dad say when you talk to him like this?",
        "Susan: He listens. And then he does what he thinks is best.",
        "Chris: Well, I will follow that example.",
        "Susan: Can't argue with that. See you later.",
        "Emily: What was that all about? You don't want to talk about it?",
        "Chris: Well, what's in the bag?",
        "Emily: Only your favorite from Al's.",
        "Chris: No. A cheese and onion omelet.",
        "Emily: Extra hot sauce.",
        "Chris: You're the best. Hey, did you get my message?",
        "Emily: No. No, I think I left my cell phone in my office.",
        "Chris: Oh, then you didn't get my heartfelt apology, huh? I'm really sorry I had to bail on you for New Year's.",
        "Emily: Oh, I'm the one who owes you an apology. Your father needed you here. I never -- I never should have even suggested that we go out.",
        "Chris: All because you wanted to ring in the New Year with the man you care about most in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Let me start by saying where I was last night.",
        "Lily: I assumed that you were at the hospital, investigating Chris Hughes.",
        "Dusty: I was.",
        "Lily: You could have told me that. Called me. I would have understood.",
        "Dusty: After I left the hospital, I was with Emily.",
        "Lily: What, did you run into her? Have a -- have a drink?",
        "Dusty: We slept together.",
        "Lily: You slept with Emily. I cannot -- I cannot believe her. You know, you stop chasing her, you start a relationship with me, she can't stand it. What kind of tricks did she pull to get you in bed?",
        "Dusty: Nobody tricked anybody. It was something we both wanted.",
        "Lily: You think she wants you? She's been rubbing that boy toy Chris Hughes of hers in your face ever since she got back to town.",
        "Dusty: Well, sometimes people are hurt, they turn to the wrong person.",
        "Lily: Like I turned to you? Is that what you're saying? You were right there, Dusty. With open arms.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I care about you.",
        "Lily: So sleeping with Emily, is that like a good-bye or something?",
        "Dusty: I'm in love with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: So what did you end up doing for New Year's?",
        "Emily: Not much. So you going to tell me how your dad's doing? Thanks.",
        "Chris: Yeah, he's okay. At least, he's stable now.",
        "Emily: Has he said anything yet?",
        "Chris: No, no, no. Thanks to Dusty, we had to keep him sedated. That jerk is so determined to get me, he doesn't care who he hurts.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry.",
        "Chris: Hey, I tried to call you a couple times last night. But you didn't pick up.",
        "Emily: Oh, well, you know me. I mean, I sleep so sound. I didn't hear a thing.",
        "Chris: So, you didn't see the ball drop?",
        "Emily: No, I guess not.",
        "Chris: Do you mind if I blame Dusty for that, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You're in love with Emily. I can't believe this.",
        "Dusty: I was honest with you about it from the get go.",
        "Lily: You told me that your relationship with her was over.",
        "Dusty: What do you want me to say?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I want you to say the things that you usually say. That \"You're beautiful.\" That \"You're not going to be alone, Lily.\" You're always going to be there for me. Say that you don't want Emily. Say that you want me.",
        "Dusty: You don't love me. You want Holden back.",
        "Lily: You know why I stopped fighting for my marriage? Because I was sleeping with you. My mother told me I was a fool, I should just run back to Holden, beg him to take me back to save my marriage. But I told her he didn't want me. That Dusty Donovan was the only person on this earth that made me feel wanted --",
        "Dusty: You are my best --",
        "Lily: And safe.",
        "Dusty: Friend.",
        "Lily: Friend?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Lily: I'm so glad, as a friend, I was able to get you back to the woman you really wanted, so you could abandon me.",
        "Dusty: I'm not abandoning you, I'm not abandoning you. We'll always be close. You know that.",
        "Lily: No, Dusty. Dusty, you know what he wants? You know what Holden wants? He wants to go to Reno and have a quickie divorce. He wants to get rid of me.",
        "Dusty: Why? You still obviously love him.",
        "Lily: Yeah, and you know that, because I cried to you about it in your bed. I made Holden believe that I was important to you.",
        "Dusty: You are.",
        "Lily: No. Only when you're alone. But now you have Emily. And I have no one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Meg: Hi.",
        "Holden: Happy New Year.",
        "Meg: Yeah, not so much. Is Mama around?",
        "Holden: Uh, no, she's not. Anything I can do for you?",
        "Meg: No, not unless you're in the mood to talk about Craig.",
        "Holden: Sure, why not?",
        "Meg: Because you intensely dislike him.",
        "Holden: Oh, that. Well, Mama, she gave me the talk. She said that he's trying to change. So, I'm willing to give my future nephew's dad a chance.",
        "Meg: What if I told you that he said some terrible things to me tonight, and I'm not even sure he wants to stay married to me?",
        "Holden: I would say that he's the jerk that I always thought he was. Who wouldn't want to be married to my gorgeous, loyal sister?",
        "Meg: I'm not so loyal, Holden. I've done things I shouldn't have. And I lied to Craig about it.",
        "Holden: Maybe I can give you a little insight into where Craig's coming from.",
        "Meg: Holden Snyder is going to get inside Craig Montgomery's mind?",
        "Holden: You lied to Craig, right? Lily lied to me as well. And at a certain point, I just snapped. I said a bunch of things. I said them, but I didn't really mean them.",
        "Meg: And now you're getting divorced? That's not a good sign for Craig and me.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but by the time Lily and I got there, we weren't listening to each other. You and Craig are still listening to each other.",
        "Meg: How do you know?",
        "Holden: Because you blame yourself, not him.",
        "Meg: I'm serious about staying committed to this marriage. I need to earn his trust back.",
        "Holden: Good. I'm glad to hear that. Why don't you give the guy a chance? Cut him a little slack?",
        "Meg: You know, I never thought I'd see the day where you would say that about my husband.",
        "Holden: Ah, I'm full of surprises.",
        "[Phone beeps]",
        "Meg: Craig left me a message.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Are you trying to ruin everything that we've worked for? You almost told Paul and Meg about the baby.",
        "Craig: Yeah, would that be such a bad thing?",
        "Rosanna: You know as well as I do that it would cause Meg to go running back to Paul.",
        "Craig: It is killing me that she's carrying his child. I almost gave her something to cause a miscarriage so she'd lose the damn thing.",
        "Rosanna: What? You would do that to a child? To a baby?",
        "Craig: You know what? If you love Paul, if you love that little bundle of joy, why don't you just go tell him the truth?",
        "Rosanna: I can't lose Paul. And I know, deep down, that you don't want to lose Meg. But you have to promise me that you're not going to do anything to that baby.",
        "Craig: I can't hurt it.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, you know that a baby doesn't have to be biologically yours in order to love it. You know that.",
        "Craig: Really? No one asked you to raise your enemy's baby.",
        "Rosanna: I am telling you, you can love the baby of the woman that you adore more than anything, because that is the only way you will keep her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Rosanna, where are you coming from?",
        "Rosanna: I don't see how that's any of your business.",
        "Meg: You went to see Craig, didn't you?",
        "Rosanna: My, you're quick to jump to conclusions.",
        "Meg: He called to leave me a message on my cell. But he hung up before he could finish. I know someone came to see him.",
        "Rosanna: Well, maybe he ordered room service. So much ranting and raving, he must have worked up quite an appetite.",
        "Meg: Maybe. I should check with the front desk. And I'm sure, if I asked really nicely, they could also check their security cameras to see what floor you got off on.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, fine, okay. I went to see Craig.",
        "Meg: Well, thank you for admitting that to me. Now I'd like you to tell me why.",
        "Rosanna: Look, Craig went after Paul tonight like a madman. It's getting to the point where we can't go anywhere without being harassed by him. I simply told Craig once and for all to leave us alone.",
        "Meg: That's not why you went to see my husband.",
        "Rosanna: And you know this because you have ESP?",
        "Meg: I know Paul. He wouldn't let his wife fight his battles for him. If he had a bone to pick with Craig, he would do it himself.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, Paul doesn't know that I went to see Craig. I told him that I was going to get a massage.",
        "Meg: You lied to him?",
        "Rosanna: You say that like you've never done it before. Look, Paul would be a little upset if I went to see Craig. But frankly, he doesn't care that much about you or Craig. But I love Paul and I cannot stand by and watch him repeatedly get hurt by Craig again and again.",
        "[Meg leaves]",
        "Paul: Hey, hey, hey. You okay?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I'm fine. I just ran into Meg here in the lobby.",
        "Paul: How was your massage?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, it was -- I'm feeling much better. Good night, Meg.",
        "Dusty: I thought that we were helping each other through lonely times.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: We had some great times. We had great times. Breakfast in bed, making love. Making time for each other every day. I shared my most intimate thoughts with you.",
        "Dusty: I always knew you'd go back to Holden.",
        "Lily: You made promises to me. You promised that you'd always be there for me and I believed you. Now I have to suffer the consequences of that.",
        "Dusty: No. No, you're going to work things out with Holden.",
        "Lily: Holden? No, Holden has moved on. He's dating someone new now. So maybe you can go back to where you were before, but I cannot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I'm sorry, I got called away. One of our biggest donors was here and he wanted a tour of the pediatric ward.",
        "Emily: That's okay, that's okay. Don't apologize. You're running an entire hospital now. I can't expect you to cater to my every whim.",
        "Chris: Really? Well, I guess you wouldn't want me to do that thing where I --",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Can you really get away?",
        "Chris: I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure. After what Dusty pulled, I clearly can't trust the nursing staff to watch him.",
        "Emily: I just hate this. I hate this!",
        "Chris: I'll get it covered.",
        "Emily: No. Dusty has a vendetta against you because of me.",
        "Chris: It's not your fault he's a psycho.",
        "Emily: I'm worried about you. You look exhausted. And I'm worried that if you waste all this energy on Dusty, you're not going to be able to do your job.",
        "Chris: No, I'm not going to let it come to that.",
        "Emily: You don't know Dusty.",
        "Chris: He doesn't know me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I don't know what to say.",
        "Lily: There's nothing left to say. I have to go to the farm. I have to pick up Ethan. I can't wait. I can't wait to run into Holden out there. It's going to be great.",
        "Dusty: You've got nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "Lily: Really? I just got dumped. That's devastating right there. But then you have to tell your soon to be ex-husband that you got dumped, that's just pathetic.",
        "Dusty: Come on, you didn't get dumped. I got turned around about my feelings for Emily.",
        "Lily: Oh, okay, I'll tell Holden that. That will be great. That will make me feel less embarrassed.",
        "Dusty: He should be embarrassed. Holden should be. For not realizing he's got an amazing woman.",
        "Lily: Don't do that. Please, don't do that. Don't, don't. Don't tell me the things that you think I want to hear, because I'm tired of it. You told me that you would always be there for me and that was a lie, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I don't know why this thing is upsetting you so much, but I'm getting rid of it. I ran into Rosanna in the lobby. She said she came up to see you.",
        "Craig: She volunteered that information, huh?",
        "Meg: I guessed. She's not very good at keeping secrets.",
        "Craig: That's what you think.",
        "Meg: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I am so sorry that you had such a rough night. And then to run into Meg after all that.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, we barely had time to snarl at each other.",
        "Paul: Look, when I was laughing at Craig, that had nothing to do with Meg. I've let go of her completely.",
        "Rosanna: Really? Then why are you still so obsessed with Craig?",
        "Paul: Well, I've hated Craig for a long time. Long before Meg was ever in the picture. Mostly for what he did to you. So when I saw him so upset, I kind of enjoyed it.",
        "Rosanna: It's a waste of time. I wish you'd stop thinking about the past.",
        "Paul: I'm not. I'm focused on my future. And I'm looking right at her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Well, hopefully, Dusty got the message when you had security throw him out.",
        "Chris: Hopefully.",
        "Emily: Well, you know, you could always hire a 24 hour guard to keep him away.",
        "Chris: Yeah, or not. [Pager beeping] I swear to God, this thing never stops. Babe, I've been trying to get a hold of this surgeon all night. I'm sorry, I really got to take this.",
        "Emily: It's okay. Go, go. You're doing a fantastic job. Go.",
        "Chris: Bye.",
        "Emily: Bye. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, what are you doing here? I told you to stay away from Bob.",
        "Dusty: I'm not here to see Bob. I'm here to see you.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Dusty: I was honest with Lily. I told her we slept together.",
        "Emily: Why would you do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hey!",
        "Holden: I think Ethan sensed you were out here. He kept saying Mama.",
        "Lily: I was just about to come in to get your stuff, Honey. Come on.",
        "Holden: He woke up from his nap.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Holden: So, he's all ready to go.",
        "Lily: Good. All right. Let me just put his stuff away. Where's his jacket?",
        "Holden: It's right in front of you.",
        "Lily: Right, here's his jacket. Okay.",
        "Holden: You okay?",
        "Lily: Let me put his jacket on.",
        "Holden: Anything you want to talk about?",
        "Lily: No. You're the last person I should talk to about this.",
        "Holden: You're the second person who's said that to me today. Am I that judgmental?",
        "Lily: Yes, you are. But this time, you would be right. Because Dusty and I are over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I told Lily the truth.",
        "Emily: Now you decide to get a conscience? You really are an idiot. You know that?",
        "Dusty: I think you and I can move forward now.",
        "Emily: Is Lily gonna -- is she going to tell Chris?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. Who cares?",
        "Emily: I care. You and I are not happening, Dusty. What part of that did you not understand?",
        "Dusty: I think we have a real chance.",
        "Emily: You know what? You have some nerve telling me how to think and how to feel. I am not leaving Chris for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Everyone warned me about Dusty. You, my mother, the kids. But did I listen? No. I know what I've done. I know what I've cost this family. Our marriage. And for what?",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: And you'll never forgive me, will you?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Lily: Come on Buddy, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I don't know what I'm saying half the time tonight. It's the alcohol. The drugs.",
        "Meg: Yeah, it's a very bad mix. Craig, I know I hurt you, and it's going to take you a very long time for you to forgive me. But I can wait. I am not going to give up on our marriage or our family.",
        "Craig: I want to go to bed right now.",
        "Meg: Something is wrong with your daddy, and I'm going to find out what it is.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Meg: He really doesn't want this baby.",
        "Tom: You picked this family tragedy as grounds, for what? A personal attack?",
        "Dusty: Why would I do that, Tom?",
        "Tom: I don't know. Because of Emily?",
        "Lily: You know, you're not a home wrecker, you're just a whore.",
        "Emily: Call her off, Dusty, or I won't be responsible for what happens next.",
        "Holden: Lily, wake up!"
