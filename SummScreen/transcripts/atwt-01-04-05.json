        "Holden leaves Lily. When he arrives at the Lakeview, he talks with Julia and she's excited that he's going to be moving out to the farm. Carly and Jack heatedly discuss the situation with JJ, ultimately Jack saying he's going to keep his word to him and Carly deciding she's going to need to do something about Julia. Sierra informs Craig that Lucy is safe and coming home, Craig returning the favor by stating he isn't going to tell Lucy about what Sierra had done to him. Sierra is suspicious at first but by the time Craig leaves, she seems to believe him. Lucinda talks Jordan into keeping an eye on Craig for her."

        "Carly: Happy New Year, g-man.",
        "Jack: Get over here. Mm-mmm. Hold that thought one second.",

        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Julia: Carly?",
        "Carly: He's busy, Julia.",
        "Julia: Oh, so you're answering his cell phone now?",
        "Carly: Is there something you need?",
        "Julia: Yeah. I need to talk to Jack.",
        "Carly: Well he can't talk to you right now. And I have things to do.",
        "Julia: She hung up on me.",
        "Lisa: Who?",
        "Julia: Carly.",
        "Lisa: What do you expect from Carly? I mean, you try to call her --",
        "Julia: I didn't try to call her. I was calling Jack and she picked up his cell phone, and then she hung up me.",
        "Lisa: Oh, sweetheart, I'm really sorry.",
        "Julia: All I was trying to do was set up some kind of schedule, so that my son is not constantly disappointed by person who says he's gonna be there, and then doesn't show up.",
        "Lisa: You just got to give it a little time.",
        "Julia: I can't. It's just too hard. Every time he says no or doesn't show up -- he used to look at me like -- like I was his whole world. And now I'm the problem. I'm this frustrated woman who's making demands on his time. I don't want to be that person, you know? And I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna take a number, and neither is my son. If Jack won't make time for us, then I'm gonna find someone who will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden! I am so sorry. It took so long for Craig to be seen by a doctor because not that many doctors work on New Year's Eve, and then I run in ton of traffic on the way to the Lakeview because every teenager in town is on their way to the lake, of course.",
        "Holden: It's okay.",
        "Lily: No. No, it's not okay. I wanted to spend New Year's Eve with my favorite guy.",
        "Holden: And I guess you did.",
        "Lily: Are you mad at me?",
        "Holden: I'm not mad.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: Yeah, me, too. More than you'll ever know.",
        "Lily: What happened? You seem different.",
        "Holden: I've been doing some thinking. That's what you're supposed to do on New Year's. Reflect on the year gone by.",
        "Lily: Me, too. And I want things to change.",
        "Holden: Do you?",
        "Lily: Well, you know I do. Holden?",
        "Holden: I can't do this anymore. I won't. So I'm moving out. Tonight.",

        "Sierra: Dusty found them.",
        "Jordan: Both of them? Lucy and Rafael?",
        "Sierra: Yeah, together and safe.",
        "Jordan: Where were they?",
        "Sierra: Well, she didn't really know.",
        "Jordan: That's incredibly lucky. They survived a plane crash, and a blizzard and an avalanche.",
        "Sierra: I just want her home before anything else happens.",
        "Jordan: As long as Dusty's with her, she will be fine.",
        "Sierra: Well, I want to see her for myself. I want to hug her, and I want to kiss her. After Bryant's death I just know what can happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dominic: I've gotta hand it to you, Dusty. If you hadn't set off that flare, I'd still be digging in the wrong snow bank. Thanks to you, here I am. And now you're all gonna die.",
        "Dusty: You're not the only one who saw the flare, Dom. You know, the whole forest service rescue team is out there --",
        "Dominic: Yeah. They're back at their ranch with their feet up in front of a fire. They don get paid enough to wade around in a blizzard. Now, by the time they find you, the sun will be out and it'll be too late.",
        "Dusty: You don't want to do this.",
        "Dominic: I don't want to do this? Get rid of you three? After what you've put me through? Nah. No, this is justice.",
        "Dusty: You could still walk outta here. If you go now, I won't follow you. You could go to Mexico.",
        "Dominic: Sorry. I found you in a $5 fight. I groomed you, staked you, trained you -- and you turn on me? Huh? You go to the cops?",
        "Lucy: Please, don't hurt him --",
        "Dusty: No! No!",
        "Dominic: No --and this is her fault. She should die first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Nothing is working. Ever since your sister died -- I just don't know how to feel close to you anymore. I don't know what you're thinking, I don't know what you want. Me moving out, it's just putting a name to it.",
        "Lily: Putting a name to it? Putting a name -- I won't even know where you are.",
        "Holden: I'm not leaving town. I'm just leaving the house.",
        "Lily: What about the kids? I don't even know how to explain this to them. What do I say?",
        "Holden: I will come back tomorrow morning, and we'll sit them down and we'll explain it together.",
        "Lily: Explain it? How can we explain it? I don't --I don't understand it. I don't -- how can we explain it to them?",
        "Holden: What the kids need to know is that we both still love them and this is not their fault. I'm still gonna see 'em every day. And if something comes up, we'll talk about it.",
        "Lily: And that's supposed to make everything all right?",
        "Holden: No, but it'll make things honest.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about?! What are you implying?",
        "Holden: The kids know that something is wrong. Luke, he knows. And the girls, they can sense the tension. And it's time that we get the truth out and deal with it.",
        "Lily: The truth? From what I understand, the truth was that we wanted to work this out together. Our marriage was important, and now, what has changed? Why do you have to leave the house tonight? Right now, in the middle of the night?",
        "Holden: Lily, I wanted to spend the night with you. It's New Year's.",
        "Lily: Wait, okay, so there it is again. It is about Craig.",
        "Holden: No, it's not about Craig, and it's not about Molly, and it's not about your sister --",
        "Lily: I called you at the Lakeview. You said it was okay.",
        "Holden: It is okay. Because that's just the way it is, and we need to admit it. Our lives have gone in different directions. You have your life, I have my life. And except for the kids -- we don't connect. We're two very nice people staying in the same house. And that's just not enough for me anymore. So I'll be staying at the Lakeview tonight. And I'll be back first thing in the morning.",
        "Lily: Wait, wait, wait. Don't -- it's late. I mean, c'mon, just -- just stay the night. All right? We'll get up in the morning, and we'll talk to the kids about this together.",
        "Holden: I can't stay here anymore.",
        "Lily: This is your home.",
        "Holden: And I'll miss it.",

        "Craig: Don't let me interrupt.",
        "Sierra: Oh, Craig. Craig, I have wonderful news. Lucy is alive, and she's fine.",
        "Craig: They found her?",
        "Sierra: I just heard from her. She just called me. She's fine. She's coming home. Craig?",
        "Craig: Oh. I was prepared -- [Sighs] for the worst. I'm just -- so grateful we found her.",
        "Sierra: I know. I'm sorry, I'm being rude. You know Jordan Sinclair?",
        "Craig: Oh, no, not really. I think he married my other ex-wife.",
        "Sierra: Oh, right, well, it's so hard to keep up with you.",
        "Craig: You two are obviously very good friends now, huh?",
        "Lucinda: Oh! I thought I heard your voice. You're not welcome in my house anymore, and you know that.",
        "Craig: Oh, Jordan Sinclair be forewarned -- when old mother Hubbard turns on you, it's not pretty.",
        "Sierra: Craig, behave. Mother, I invited him over so that I could fill him in on Lucy's rescue.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you've filled him in, so now he can go.",
        "Sierra: He needs the details.",
        "Lucinda: All right. Well, Jordan, we know that Lucy's okay and she's on her way home, perhaps you and I could find a little time to talk about the Kiplinger merger.",
        "Jordan: Hmm, well my files are in the car.",
        "Lucinda: Great. I could use a breath of fresh air. And when I come back, you'll be gone?",
        "Craig: Yes, Mother.",
        "Jordan: I'll talk to you later?",
        "Sierra: Yeah.",
        "Jordan: I'm glad they found your daughter, Craig. I know what it's like to lose a child.",
        "Craig: Ah.",
        "Sierra: Are you paying attention? [Craig chuckles] Everybody seems to hate you.",
        "Craig: Oh! Nothing new. Right, Sierra?",
        "Sierra: Except me, of course, because I'm forever hopeful that you're gonna change.",
        "Craig: Ye well, look -- we need to talk. Now that Lucy's home --",
        "Sierra: Ah. Yore gonna call the police and have her mother arrested?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Sierra: Do you want money?",
        "Craig: I like money. But no, not from you.",
        "Sierra: Huh. You're gonna yell at me or maybe you have a more subtle revenge planned for me.",
        "Craig: No. I am not gonna to tell Lucy that you had me drugged with chloroform, kidnapped, and force-fed dry bread and religion. That is going to remain our little secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafael: Don't hurt her! She didn't do anything to you. I'm the one you're mad at.",
        "Dominic: Oh, you're gonna get yours. After you watch your girlfriend die.",
        "Dusty: Nobody's gotta die.",
        "Dominic: Oh, someone's gotta pay for Bud. And that pilot. Better you than me.",
        "Lucy: Bud's dead?",
        "Dusty: Bud's dead. Dom shot him and stuffed him in a locker.",
        "Dominic: Oh, you cross me, you're gonna pay. What's the matter, huh? You never had a man you couldn't control?",
        "Dusty: Leave her alone.",
        "Dominic: Or what, huh? I shoot you first? Huh? You see what she does to you? She's the problem here! If it weren't for her, we'd be in Miami, counting our money. Until he met you, there was only one thing on my man Dusty's mind. How much? He was a lowlife player with just enough brains to stay a step ahead of the cops, right? We got along fine, then you happened.",
        "Lucy: If what you're interested in is money, I can --",
        "Dominic: Ah! Don't you see what she does? It's maddening. She figures out what you want and she dangles it, just outta reach. You ever get what you wanted, hmm? It's cold in here? Did she keep you warm?",
        "Rafael: Oh, shut up!",
        "Dominic: Rafi was a good boy, too. You know? But you had to go and ruin that, too, didn't you?",
        "[Sounds of struggle]",
        "[Gun shot]",
        "Lucy: Dusty!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm a free man. Come here. Let's party! Come on!",
        "Carly: Well, sweetheart, I'm not entirely sure that you're gonna want to party with me when you hear what I did.",
        "Jack: What'd you do?",
        "Carly: Well, your phone rang while you were busy, and I thought that it might be Parker, so I answered it. And it was Julia. I told her that you were busy and she wasn't happy with that or with the fact that I answered your phone, so I told her that I couldn't talk to her and then I -- I hung up.",
        "Jack: On her?",
        "Carly: No, I didn't hang up on her, exactly. I mean, I told her that you weren't available and that I had to go, and then I hung up on her. That's not so bad, though, is it, really? It's no secret that we're not exactly best friends. It's not terrible.",
        "Jack: Its okay, it's okay. It's just that I was supposed to hang out with J.J. earlier today, and I got hung up on a case, and when I showed up late, she wasn't exactly happy. J.J.'s having a tough time. He can't grasp the fact that I'm not going to be coming home. That's all.",
        "Carly: Oh. Sweetheart, I know that you care about him a lot, but I wonder if it might not be better for you to sort of ease out of the picture. I mean, for him, for his sake. No matter what you do, Julia is not going to be happy. She's very resentful, and that's only gonna get worse, and with this little boy right in the middle of it --",
        "Jack: Maybe it'd be better if they'd just left town?",
        "Carly: Don't make me out to be the bad guy here. But Julia should have seen this coming. I warned her. I told her not to get his hopes up. I mean, you have a very busy life. You have a demanding job and children of your own. So, if Julia was smart, she would take the boy and start over someplace else.",
        "Jack: I love that little boy. And he is like a son to me. And the last thing I want, is for him to move someplace else. I want him in my life, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Jack Snyder's not the only decent man in Oakdale, you know. Holden has been really great to J.J. He made sure that J.J. had a Christmas. He's teaching him how to ride a horse.",
        "Lisa: Holden has three little children at home. He's got a grown son who is trying desperately to recover from some very serious injuries.",
        "Julia: I know, and he still finds time. That's what I mean, because he knows what it means to make a commitment to a little child, because he's a warm, decent human being,",
        "Lisa: I'm sure that his wife would agree with that.",
        "Julia: Well, she's a damn fool if she doesn't.",
        "Lisa: Wait -- Lily is certainly not a fool. You just -- look, I've known her for -- oh, I can't even remember how many years. We've been partners together. We're certainly good friends. And just remember that Lily has a lot of friends here in this town, and Lily and Holden are as solid together as can be.",
        "Julia: I'm sure they are. I didn't mean --",
        "Lisa: Oh, I certainly hope not.",
        "Julia: No. Lily's been wonderful. She's been so kind to J.J., and I don't make it a habit to go after other women's husbands. What happened with Jack was, you know -- I didn't know he was married and he didn't know he was married. It was an accident. And, you know, I don't -- I mean, the only reason I mentioned Holden is just because -- well, he's a good man, you know? And I know that there are other good men -- single good men. Hopefully, when I get myself together and on my feet, I'll meet one. In the meantime, I'm just really glad to have a job, and have a place to stay and have you as my friend.",
        "Lisa: I know, I know. Okay, I have to get back to work. Julia -- honey, I'm really glad we've cleared the air about Holden. I really don't want you to get your hopes up, you know? Not after all you've been through.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: That's all you're taking?",
        "Holden: I'll come by tomorrow and pick up the rest of it. I'll be at the Lakeview tonight, the farm tomorrow. You have the numbers, obviously. Okay, then.",
        "Lily: That's it? Just walk out the door like you're going to the post office, go to the farm like it's nothing?",
        "Holden: Lily, I don't want to fight with you. There's really nothing left to say, and I don't want to wake the kids.",
        "Lily: Oh, right. Don't wake the kids. Because, you know what -- we've spent half our lives together and we have children together, but who cares?",
        "Holden: I care. That's why I'm coming back tomorrow.",
        "Lily: Good for you! Coming back tomorrow, making sure everything's fine and everything goes smoothly! Make sure nobody's upset! You know what? I'm upset! I'm upset! I thought things were bad, but I did not see this. I did not see this coming.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: No, you're not. You're not sorry! Look at you, you're gone! You're already gone!",
        "Holden: Lily, what do you want from me?",
        "Lily: I want you to admit that this is something. It's not nothing! It's just something, and that it's not easy for you!",
        "Holden: Easy? I am so disappointed right now --",
        "Lily: I know. I know how disappointed you are in me. You've told me, believe me, many times.",
        "Holden: No. You have changed. And I am upset about that. I don't blame you, but the girl that I met in the barn, the woman that I fell in love with and married, my partner in all things good and bad, I don't know what happened. You're still beautiful and smart, and you're so wonderful with the kids, but whatever it is that lit you up when you looked at me, it's gone. I've lost you.",
        "Lily: No, you haven't. You haven't -- you haven't lost me. I know we haven't connected lately, but --",
        "Holden: Lily, it's over. And it is not easy for me to say that. It's taken me a very long time to come to terms with it. Why do you think that I've been here so long, sleeping in the guest room?",
        "Lily: That was your idea.",
        "Holden: Yeah, because I thought we could work things out, but we can't. And I'm not happy about it. But at least I have the respect for you and for the kids to leave here quietly. And if that makes it seem like I don't care or I'm not upset, we really have lost touch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dominic: Looks like your boyfriend volunteered to go first. But that's okay. You got it covered, right, Rafael? Don't worry, Dusty. It won't last. What's that?",
        "Lucy: We heard it before, just before the avalanche.",
        "Dusty: The shots must've set off another one.",
        "Rafael: We've gotta get outta here, now!",
        "Dominic: Oh, no, you don't. No, you don't. You get over here. Change of plans. I'm leaving, you're staying.",
        "Lucy: What? We'll be buried alive!",

        "Julia: What did you do?",
        "Holden: I left my wife.",
        "Lily: I know things are a mess right now, Holden, but I do love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Why do you think Sierra continues to have discourse with this man?",
        "Jordan: I would say mostly for Lucy's sake. She's very smart. She knows that she will lose her leverage if she cuts him off.",
        "Lucinda: She's got to be careful or she's gonna lose her head. If you knew how many times that man --",
        "Jordan: I'm not sure I want to know.",
        "Lucinda: Well, he insinuates himself into her life when she's feeling charitable or she's feeling vulnerable, as she is right now. And he whines and he wheedles and she opens her arms -- I've seen that. Or her pocketbook, and I've seen that, too. Or both of them, and I cannot let that happen again. I can't -- and it will, unless I know exactly what he's up to.",
        "Jordan: Lucinda, I am -- I'm very fond of your daughter --",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I noticed that.",
        "Jordan: -- Which is why I will not spy on her for you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, but darling, this isn't spying. This is fact-finding. This is preemptive deterrence. I have gotta know. The more I know, the more I can protect my daughter.",
        "Jordan: I'm not so sure she wants to be protected.",
        "Lucinda: Well, no, not by me, by mother, but maybe you, huh? I fancy she might rather relish nestling under your wing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Drink?",
        "Sierra: No, but I would like to know what you meant when you said that we wouldn't have to talk about your little sojourn in the monastery.",
        "Craig: You do, huh?",
        "Sierra: Mm-hmm.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't know. I think I like having the upper hand.",
        "Sierra: You have always had the upper hand. I loved you, remember?",
        "Craig: Ah, you still do. Well, you tolerate me anyway?",
        "Sierra: I still pray for you.",
        "Craig: Yes, you and Francis and all the brothers.",
        "Sierra: Poor Brother Francis. He did his best.",
        "Craig: Well, yeah, he's a good man. Dull, but good. You're good. Lucy? I don't know. I think she has some of her father's thrill of the chase in her.",
        "Sierra: Yes, I think she might.",
        "Craig: Which is why I am not going to tell her that her mother had her father drugged and dragged to a monastery and threatened with life imprisonment and a bad caftan if I didn't repent. For a saint, you are surprisingly vicious.",
        "Sierra: Well, anything for a good cause.",
        "Craig: Which is why I am not going to tell her. Okay? It's gonna be our little secret.",
        "Sierra: Am I to believe that you're actually doing the right thing?",
        "Craig: Believe what you will.",
        "Sierra: Or is this some kind of bribe? You know, like if you don't tell her about the monastery, then I keep quiet about Alan? Because if that's it, you can just forget it. Because a month in a monastery does not compare to a bullet in the chest. So just forget it. No deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dominic: I could shoot you, but why waste the bullets? This avalanche is gonna do just fine. It's time for me to go.",
        "Rafael: You're not gonna get away with this!",
        "Dominic: You have a way with words, stupid. This is just mother nature, gettin' even.",
        "Dusty: Let's get outta here! Go ahead, Lucy. Make sure she gets all the way up. Go ahead. Go, go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We've been through this before, haven't we? With another child named J.J. and when the time came, you let that child go, even though you felt like he was your own.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I let him go because he had a mother and father to love him and take care of him. J.J.'s got Julia, yes, and she's a wonderful mother, but his father -- Carly, his father was abusive.",
        "Carly: Yes, I know.",
        "Jack: How can you expect me to turn my back on that?",
        "Carly: Because I don't think that you're really helping him. You are never gonna win with Julia, Jack. You know that. And how is this boy supposed to sort through all of those feelings that he loves you, but you make his mother sad. That he can't wait to see you, but seeing you makes his mother so unhappy.",
        "Jack: All I know is that J.J. asked me to be his father and I said yes. I don't go back on my word.",
        "Carly: Well, things have changed since you made that promise. I think you need to think about what's best for him now, given the situation as it is right now.",
        "Jack: I can handle Julia. But you don't think so?",
        "Carly: I think it's hard to change someone under the best of circumstances. And when she doesn't want to change, it's pretty near impossible.",

        "Julia: Hey, Holden? What're you doing here? I thought you left.",
        "Holden: I did.",
        "Julia: Where's Lily and the kids?",
        "Holden: They're home. I'll see you in the morning --",

        "Holden: It's just -- I don't really want to talk about it right now.",
        "Julia: Oh, okay. Sorry, I just -- you look lost. Hey, whatever. You know, I'm not trying to pry or anything. It's just, you've been a really good friend to me and if you're -- if you need someone to talk to or, you know, you just want company, or whatever -- you know where I am because, you know, hey, you put me there, so -- I'm officially babbling. I'm just gonna go.",
        "Holden: Wait. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to --",
        "Julia: What?",
        "Holden: It's just been a while since anybody tried to figure out what's going on with me. I guess I forgot how that works.",
        "Julia: Okay, well, you talk and I listen.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Well, that's the problem. You talk and talk and it doesn't register. So, you finally figure out that you need to do something and you do it, and then you realize that what you did is a little odd. But you're okay with it because you knew you had to do it. And it's new.",
        "Julia: Hey, it sounds like the last six months of my life.",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Julia: What'd you do?",

        "Carly: What she wants is her family back.",
        "Jack: No, I promised that I would be there for J.J. and I'll honor that. And now, maybe that he's back in school and I'm back to work, maybe we can hammer out some kind of schedule. You know, like you and Hal have.",
        "Carly: Oh, don't bring me into it.",
        "Jack: Okay, so not what you and Hal have, but a schedule, nonetheless.",
        "Carly: Okay, a schedule is a very good start, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.",
        "Jack: Why? What do you mean?",
        "Carly: You will never satisfy that woman, Jack. You can pick the kid up four times a week at exactly 3:00 --",
        "Jack: Okay, then what do you suggest I do that doesn't involve me turning my back on J.J.?",

        "Julia: You left Lily? I'm sure you did what you had to do, but I just never -- I mean, we were just sitting here, toasting the New Year.",
        "Holden: Well, that was part of it. Talking about last year and all the problems. We have a lot of problems. We did not deal with them very well.",
        "Julia: I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, me, too.",
        "Julia: You know, when I left Les, I mean, even though he was -- well, you know what he was like, you met him. It still hurt because you have to let go of that thing that you fell in love with in the first place, and that's just hard.",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Julia: Because you want to -- you want to hold on to the way it was in the beginning, before everything went all crazy, you know? You want to remember the good times. I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: Anyway, I'm gonna be staying here tonight, and going out to the farm tomorrow, so I'll be around. You can tell J.J.",
        "Julia: He's gonna love that. He's still talking about the horseback ride you took him on.",

        "Jordan: So, what makes you so sure that you can trust me with your daughter?",
        "Lucinda: You're cute and you're smart. I'd be a fool if I trusted you. But I also think that you're a nice young man, and I -- I think you'll watch Craig for me, for Sierra's sake.",

        "Sierra: That you had her kidnapped?",
        "Craig: She knows that and she knows why. And as for the rest of it, if you want to tell her that you blame me for Alan's death, you go right ahead. That is your call. But I am not gonna tell her about the monastery. She's been through enough and I'm not gonna hurt her. Right now, she's safe and I don't feel like hurting anybody.",
        "Sierra: Well, that's -- noble of you.",
        "Craig: If I was noble, I'd go back to the monastery and get locked up again.",

        "Sierra: Is that all it taught you?",
        "Craig: No. It taught me that ultimately, I was a bad husband, a mediocre father and a lousy friend, and that I can't change any of that. And that if there's any hope, it's in the future. And if I'm lucky enough, I will be forgiven. But I better leave now because I don't think your mother, on principle, is ever going to forgive me, so --",
        "Sierra: No, I don't think she will. You know, is this some kind of trick, you know, you're just gonna act like you're a changed man and then hope that I'll forgive you?",
        "Craig: No, it's not a trick, and you will never know how sorry I really am.",
