        "Dusty: Meg \r\nthought that if you got your child back, then you and I would be together, no \r\nmatter what. She knew that's what I wanted, anyway. But that was before --\r\n",
        "Jennifer: \r\nBefore? ",
        "Dusty: I mean, \r\nbefore you got Johnny back. I understand if things have changed. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nEverything's changed. ",
        "Dusty: Yeah. \r\nThat's what I figured. I should've guessed. ",
        "Jennifer: I've \r\nwished for you every waking moment. Even before I got Johnny back. That never \r\nchanged. Every day since I sent you away, I wake up aching for you. Every night, \r\nI dreamed this. This moment, right here. You, standing there. You coming to me.\r\n",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Meg: Hello? Is \r\nsomeone here? Are you hurt? I'm a nurse. I can help. [Paul groaning] Paul. Oh, my God. \r\nPaul, what happened to you? ",
        "Paul: I got \r\nshot. ",
        "Meg: Shot? Oh, \r\nmy God. Oh, my God. Okay, just stay with me. Who did this? ",
        "[Paul \r\nremembering] ",

        "Paul: Hunters.\r\n",
        "Meg: Hunters? \r\nIn the middle of the night? Okay, okay, when? \nPaul. Paul, okay, come on, we have to get to the hospital. Come on. \n",
        "Paul: No, no, \r\nno, no. No hospital. ",
        "Meg: Paul, this \r\nis serious. I can't treat you out here. You need an emergency room. ",
        "Paul: No. No \r\none can know. Nobody. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Susan: I hate \r\nto see you hurt like this. But I honestly believe that if Paul Ryan is out of \r\nyour life forever, it's a good thing. He should be out of everybody's life \r\nforever. Oh, I know it sounds harsh. But he should be in solitary. They should \r\nthrow away the key. Emily, are you cold? ",
        "Emily: I'm \r\nfine. ",
        "Susan: Sweetie, \r\nhow can you be fine? You're shaking like a leaf. ",
        "Emily: I know \r\nwhat to do. ",
        "Susan: Your \r\nhands are like ice. ",
        "Emily: It was \r\ncold. ",
        "Susan: Where?\r\n",
        "Emily: It was \r\ncold. ",
        "Susan: Where, \r\nsweetie? ",

        "Holden: Hey, \r\nit's me. ",
        "Lily: Holden, \r\nit's late. ",
        "Holden: Yeah, I \r\nknow. ",
        "Lily: Is \r\nsomething wrong with Luke? With the girls? ",
        "Holden: No, no, \r\nthey're fine. They're all home in bed. ",
        "Lily: Why \r\naren't you? ",
        "Holden: I \r\ncouldn't sleep. ",
        "Lily: Look, I \r\nhave to go. ",
        "Holden: Wait, \r\nwait, I just -- I want to talk to you. ",
        "Lily: You \r\nshouldn't have called here. ",
        "Holden: Isn't \r\nKeith asleep? ",
        "Lily: I don't \r\nthink so. He was in his room, the door was closed. I think he's on the phone.\r\n",
        "Holden: You \r\nguys are in separate rooms? ",
        "Lily: Yes. What \r\ndid you think? ",
        "Holden: That he \r\nwas pushing you, and I didn't know -- ",
        "Lily: You know.\r\n",
        "Holden: I miss \r\nyou. Meet me out front. ",
        "Lily: What?\r\n",
        "Holden: On the \r\nporch. I'm at Java, I'll be there in a few minutes. ",
        "Lily: I don't \r\nthink so. ",
        "Holden: We'll \r\nbe quiet. Just make sure that Keith\u2019s door is closed. ",
        "Lily: No.\r\n",
        "Holden: I just \r\nwant to see you. That's all. ",
        "Lily: Right.\r\n",
        "Holden: Unless \r\nyou absolutely force me. In which case, you'll win. Say yes. ",
        "Keith: Lily?\r\n",
        "Lily: I've got \r\nto go. ",
        "Keith: It's the \r\nmiddle of the night. ",
        "Lily: Yes, you \r\nshould be sleeping. ",
        "Keith: So \r\nshould you. But since you're up, I've got some big news. ",
        "Lily: What \r\nnews? ",
        "Keith: I've got \r\na friend in San Diego. He's got a charter business. He offered me a job as a \r\nsenior pilot. I took it. ",
        "Lily: You're \r\ngoing to San Diego? ",
        "Keith: We're \r\ngoing. ",
        "Lily: We?\r\n",
        "Keith: Yeah, \r\nyeah. Pack your bags. We leave for \nCalifornia \r\ntomorrow. ",
        "Lily: You must \r\nbe joking. ",
        "Keith: I'm not \r\ngoing to joke about a great job like this. ",
        "Lily: Great?\r\n",
        "Keith: Yeah.\r\n",
        "Lily: Great for \r\nyou. But I can't just -- I can't just pack up and leave at a moment's notice.\r\n",
        "Keith: Look, \r\nLily, I'm not going to find a job like this around here. You must've seen this \r\ncoming. ",
        "Lily: I did?\r\n",
        "Keith: Yeah.\r\n",
        "Lily: No, there \r\nis no way that I would even think that you'd take a job in California and I'd \r\nhave to go with you. ",
        "Keith: Well, \r\nwhat did you expect, I was just going to stay here and sponge off of you? I \r\ngotta work for a living, and we've gotta go where the work is. ",
        "Lily: No, \r\nthere's no way. There's no way in hell that I'm leaving here. My family is here, \r\nmy children are here, my whole life is here in this town. No. ",
        "Keith: Okay, \r\nall right, all right, Lily. Lily, come on, just relax, okay? You know what? The \r\ncompany, they're going to expand. They'll go regional, and then I'll come back \r\nhere and I'll work here. ",
        "Lily: No, no.\r\n",
        "Keith: Yeah, \r\ncome on, it won't be that long. ",
        "Lily: It's not \r\ngoing to happen. Absolutely not. ",
        "Keith: Now, \r\nI've been playing by your rules here. Come on, you're not even meeting me \r\nhalfway here. You're not with me at all. ",
        "Lily: I live \r\nhere. I agreed I'd stay here. ",
        "Keith: Right, \r\nhere. So you can sneak around, sneak off to the barn with your ex-husband.\r\n",
        "Lily: He's not \r\nmy ex-husband. Not yet. ",
        "Keith: That's \r\nright, 'cause he won't give you a divorce. \nLily, come on. Do you think that you're in love with him again? I mean, \r\ndo you really? ",
        "Lily: I never \r\nstopped loving Holden. ",
        "Keith: Is it \r\nbecause it's exciting, sneaking around and all that stuff? Have you forgotten \r\nabout all the gaps? All the times that he's let you down. ",
        "Lily: No, \r\nthat's not true. ",
        "Keith: Well, \r\nyou know what, you're coming with me. You're coming with me. That's the only way \r\nthat we have a chance. ",
        "Lily: You \r\ncannot order me to do something. ",
        "Keith: Lily, \r\nwait a minute now, come on now. You made me a promise and the only way to keep \r\nthat promise is to come with me. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Jennifer: I was \r\nan idiot to make you leave. ",
        "Dusty: Yes, you \r\nwere. ",
        "Jennifer: I \r\nregretted it every day, every -- the very next minute. But I thought you were \r\nhappy. ",
        "Dusty: I \r\nwasn\u2019t. ",
        "Jennifer: I'm \r\nsorry. ",
        "Dusty: No, I'm \r\nsorry. If it weren't for me, I think you would've had Johnny -- ",
        "Jennifer: No \r\nmore apologies. If you weren't here, I wouldn't feel this. ",
        "Dusty: Feel \r\nwhat? ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nWhole. Happy. In love. ",
        "Dusty: Jenny -- \r\n[Baby fusses] Go ahead. ",

        "Susan: Okay, \r\nokay. But you came to see me. ",
        "Emily: Yeah, I \r\ndid. I came to see you. ",
        "Susan: Because \r\nyou knew what to do. That's what you meant, right? When you said you knew what \r\nto do? Because Paul is gone. ",
        "[Emily sobs]\r\n",
        "Emily: Oh, God.\r\n",
        "Susan: Emily. \r\n[Beeper beeps] Emily. ",
        "Emily: You have \r\nto go. No, it's okay. ",
        "Susan: No, just \r\nfor a minute. Just for a minute. I'm going to get somebody to cover for me, and \r\nthen I'll be right back, okay? You stay here. ",
        "Emily: I will.\r\n",
        "Susan: All \r\nright, don't -- don't move, okay? You promise? ",

        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Meg: You're \r\nbleeding out, Paul. [Paul screams] You need more than I can give you. \n",
        "Paul: No. No \r\nhospitals. ",
        "Meg: At least a \r\ndoctor. Or an EMT. ",
        "Paul: No. No.\r\n",
        "Meg: Look, your \r\npulse is thready. And your breathing is labored. ",
        "Paul: I just \r\nneed to catch my breath. ",
        "Meg: I'm \r\ncalling a doctor. ",
        "Paul: No, \r\ndon\u2019t. ",
        "Meg: What, you \r\nexpect me to leave you laying out here? Look, at least there's a clear road over \r\nthere, okay? I'll take you out there. ",
        "Paul: Meg, \r\nthere's a cabin. ",
        "Meg: What?\r\n",
        "Paul: On the \r\nother side of those tress. There. ",
        "Meg: How'd you \r\nsee that? ",
        "Paul: On the \r\nway down. ",
        "Meg: Oh, my \r\nGod, Paul, how far did you fall? ",
        "Paul: That's a \r\nloaded question. ",

        "Meg: You think \r\nthis is funny? ",
        "Paul: No.\r\n",
        "Meg: You want \r\nto die, don't you? Great. That's reason enough to save your miserable hide. Come \r\non, come on. Let's get up. Come on. Come on. ",

        "Susan: Okay. \r\nJust tell me, what can I do for you? ",
        "Emily: Just \r\nstop asking questions. ",
        "Susan: Just one \r\nmore. Will you come live here? It's been so quiet since your sister left, and I \r\nwould love to have you. Come home, baby. ",
        "Emily: I don't \r\ndeserve to come home. ",
        "Susan: Of \r\ncourse you do. ",
        "Emily: No, I \r\ndon\u2019t. ",
        "Susan: Why?\r\n",
        "Emily: Not \r\nafter what I did. ",
        "Susan: Emily, \r\nyou avoided the worst case scenario. Thanks to Hal, you are not going to jail. \r\nAnd you are not married to Paul. You're free, honey. ",
        "Emily: Free?\r\n",
        "Susan: Oh, I \r\nknow, now it looks like the end of the world, but you're in a really good place. \r\nYou can start over. ",
        "Emily: Free? \r\nStart over? ",
        "Susan: I'm \r\nserious. ",
        "Emily: Free? \r\nFree, Mother? I'm never going to be -- don't touch me! I'm never going to be \r\nfree! ",
        "Susan: Emily, \r\nokay, okay. ",
        "Emily: Free of \r\nwhat? I'm never going to be free! ",
        "Susan: Okay, \r\njust take it easy. ",
        "Emily: Oh God! \r\nTake it away! ",
        "Susan: It'll be \r\nall right. ",
        "Emily: Get it \r\naway! ",
        "Susan: Come on, \r\nwe'll talk about this, come on. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Meg: Okay, once \r\nthat's going, you'll warm up. You know, you're pretty lucky that bullet went \r\nclear through. It's a good thing your hunter used a small caliber handgun. And \r\nyou're also lucky that he missed the major arteries. ",
        "Paul: Good \r\nnews. ",
        "Meg: You want \r\nthe bad news? ",
        "Paul: No, thank \r\nyou. ",
        "Meg: It must've \r\nhit a vessel, because you've lost a lot of blood. You probably need a \r\ntransfusion, Paul. At least. And you're at major risk for infection. You need \r\nprofessional help. ",
        "Paul: You're a \r\nprofessional. ",
        "Meg: And that's \r\nwhy I'm telling you that -- ",
        "Paul: How do \r\nyou treat a gunshot? You know, right? You've done that before? ",
        "Meg: Yes. Do \r\nyou know the first thing we do when a gunshot victim comes into E.R.? We call \r\nthe cops. Regulation, by law. ",
        "Paul: What's \r\nthe second thing you do? ",
        "Meg: I'm going, \r\nPaul. ",
        "Paul: Please, \r\ndon't go. ",
        "Meg: Why are \r\nyou being so irrational about this? ",
        "Paul: Because \r\nof the first thing that you do -- ",
        "Meg: You don't \r\nwant the cops involved? ",
        "Paul: No, I \r\ndon't want anyone involved. ",
        "Meg: Well, too \r\nbad. ",
        "Paul: You don't \r\nknow what you're doing. ",
        "Meg: Yes, I do \r\nknow what I'm doing. I'm going to the car and driving to a phone and calling \r\n911. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Dusty: Is \r\nJohnny okay? ",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, \r\nhe went back to sleep, no problem. ",
        "Dusty: What are \r\nyou doing way over there? ",
        "Jennifer: Just \r\ntrying to catch my breath. Stop my heart from racing. ",
        "Dusty: I love \r\nyou, Jenny. ",
        "Jennifer: Oh, \r\nboy. ",
        "Dusty: I don't \r\nwant you to think I missed it before when you said it -- I don't want you to \r\nfeel alone, I love you, too. ",
        "Jennifer: Okay, \r\nthat's not helping my heart rate very much. ",
        "Dusty: We've \r\nwasted a lot of time. What is it? ",
        "Jennifer: What \r\nif it's not real? ",
        "Dusty: What? \r\nUs? You're not really scared about that, are you? ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nDusty, it's not just up to me now, I have a baby. Another human being that I am \r\ncompletely responsible for. I can't just dive in without looking. ",
        "Dusty: You \r\ndon't think I'd be a good influence on \nJohnny, and his mother? ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nDusty, up until a few hours ago you were with another woman. And you weren't \r\njust dating, you and Meg were living together. What you two had together, it \r\nlooked real to me. ",
        "Dusty: Yeah, \r\nbecause it was. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Lily: I cannot \r\nleave my children. Please, don't ask me to do that. That was not part of the \r\ndeal. ",
        "Keith: We'll \r\njust take the kids with us. ",
        "Lily: Holden \r\nwill not allow it, no. ",
        "Keith: Well, \r\nyou know what? Your lawyer can talk to his lawyer. ",
        "Lily: When? \r\nYou're talking about this in the middle of the night, you want me to leave \r\ntomorrow. ",
        "Keith: You know \r\nwhat? We'll get down there, we'll get settled. We'll let the lawyers fight it \r\nout and then the kids can come down. They can start school at the winter \r\nsession. ",
        "Lily: This is \r\n-- this is unreal. ",
        "Keith: I'll \r\ntell you what's unreal, is where you run around and I stay deaf, dumb and blind \r\nlike some kind of a monkey. Now listen to me, okay? The only way this is going \r\nto work is that we've got to get you out of town. ",
        "Lily: This is \r\ntoo much. Too soon, no. ",
        "Keith: It's not \r\nnegotiable, Lily. [Doorbell rings] What do you want, a cup of sugar? ",
        "Holden: I'm \r\nhere to see my wife. ",
        "Keith: Good, \r\ncome on in. She's got some big news. Go ahead, \nLily, tell him. ",

        "Dusty: I don't \r\nthink that's a good idea. ",

        "Holden: What is \r\nit? ",
        "Keith: Go \r\nahead, Lily, tell him. 'Cause I'm not going to let him stop us. ",
        "Holden: What \r\nthe hell is going on? ",
        "Keith: \r\nMeanwhile, I'm going to go upstairs and pack my flight bag. ",
        "Holden: He's \r\nleaving? ",
        "Lily: Yes.\r\n",
        "Holden: You \r\nsent him away? ",
        "Lily: No.\r\n",

        "Lily: Yes.\r\n",
        "Holden: Where \r\nare you going? ",
        "Lily: \r\nCalifornia. ",
        "Holden: \r\nCalifornia? What is this, some sick idea of an early honeymoon? ",
        "Lily: Keith was \r\noffered a job in San Diego. ",
        "Holden: Is it \r\npermanent? ",
        "Lily: It's a \r\ngreat opportunity for him. ",
        "Holden: Lily, \r\nyou need to stop this. Would you just listen to yourself? ",
        "Lily: I will \r\nnot fight, I will not fight to have the children sent. ",
        "Holden: What?\r\n",
