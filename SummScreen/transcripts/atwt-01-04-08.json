        "Meg is anxious to share baby news with Craig, but he pulls away and is evasive about his feelings. Dusty goes to the police station and tries to get Margo to run interference for him and get him in to see Bob. Tom joins and tells him to stop making accusations, where's the proof that his brother has done anything wrong, and to leave his family alone! Lily takes exception that Emily puts on a little show with Chris for her benefit. She calls her not only a home- wrecker, but a whore. Emily defends by saying she is happy with Chris, she doesn't want Dusty and their one night was a mistake. Frustrated, Lily walks into a bar and allows herself to be picked up by Jay who gives her a pill to cheer her up. Holden finds her later back in her hotel room conked out. She has forgotten to pick up Faith. In the chaos, he forgets about his date with Bonnie.",
        "Meg checks with nurse Jan about the drug, xyphorex, Craig is taking for his infection. Jan says it is a good thing she did not come in contact with it, she could have lost the baby. Emily bumps into Dusty and rails on him for blabbing all about New Year's Eve to Lily. He admits she is not his girlfriend and he loves Emily and he wishes she would be more honest to herself about her feelings. She says he had no right to be so damn honest about her personal life. She later convinces Chris not to try to help Lily as she is too stressed and is blaming everybody for her breakup with Dusty. Meg tells Craig that she had another doctor's appointment and a sonogram and the baby will be the spitting image of him. He panics, does not want the boy to be named after him, and leaves her standing in wonderment. It's clear that he no longer wants this baby, but why? She calls Jan to get Eli's number to ask him about possible DNA test mix-ups. Holden offers to bring Lily back to the farm and take care of her. She jumps at the chance, but has false hopes and finally declines. She calls Faith who has to be made to even talk to her, her mommy took a nap and forgot her! Snooping around, Dusty finds Dr. Bob's coffee cup on the floor in his office and calls to have it analyzed. Meg calls Paul and leaves a message that she has news about the baby."

        "Meg: Hey there.",
        "Craig: Hey yourself.",
        "Meg: You let me sleep in late, Mr. Montgomery. You know, this is the part where you make a comment like you let me sleep in late too, Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: I thought you preferred us on a first name basis.",
        "Meg: I've kind of gotten used to you adding Montgomery to my name. What? Where are you going?",
        "Craig: Oh, it's late, like you said.",
        "Meg: Have you forgotten that you're in bed with the CEO of Montgomery Enterprises? You can go in as late as you like. Besides, you probably need the rest after yesterday. How's your hand doing?",
        "Craig: I'll live.",
        "Meg: How's your head?",
        "Craig: You know what? Okay. You know what, if I promise not to ever mix alcohol and medications again, will you stop asking me how I am?",
        "Meg: Maybe. Oh, my God.",
        "Craig: What's the matter? You all right? Is it the baby? What's the matter?",
        "Meg: He moved. Here, here, feel. What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bonnie: Why does this phone always ring at the worst -- basketball's world famous Bonnie McKechnie speaking?",
        "Holden: How are you? Did I catch you at a bad time?",
        "Bonnie: You bet you did. If you would have called about 10 minutes ago, you could've saved me some major damage on my credit cards.",
        "Holden: I'll try to schedule my calls better in the future.",
        "Bonnie: Oh. So what is the reason for this unscheduled call? You ready for that rematch you promised me?",
        "Holden: Actually, I was thinking that maybe we could take in a movie. If you're free.",
        "Bonnie: Holden, are you to ask me on a -- oh, what's that word? Date?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I guess that's what they're calling it these days.",
        "Bonnie: All right. Last I heard, a date between two adults usually involved some sort of food or beverage. And before you ask, popcorn and soda do not count.",
        "Holden: Well, I suppose that I could buy the candy, if you insist.",
        "Bonnie: Big spender. Well, since you are clearly out of practice here, I gonna take pity on you and say yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Margo.",
        "Margo: Oh, Dusty Donovan, what the hell are you doing here of your own free will?",
        "Dusty: I need your help.",
        "Margo: Why? What's happened?",
        "Dusty: I got to get in to see Bob.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm a cop, not a nurse. I have no control over the visiting hours at Memorial.",
        "Dusty: The hours aren't the problem. It's the access. Your brother-in-law locked me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Uh, we're here.",
        "Chris: The next time I threaten to take an overnight shift, remind me of last night and this morning.",
        "Emily: I can't make any promises. But I will do my best.",
        "Chris: Oh, I know what you can do. That's why I want some more.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Emily: You better get your phone.",
        "Chris: Oh, I swear if I wasn't the acting chief of staff, I'd break this thing into a million pieces. Dr. Hughes. What time did they get out of surgery? Uh- huh.",
        "Emily: Hi, Lily. It's a pleasant surprise.",
        "Lily: Really? Wasn't that little loving couple routine -- wasn't that for my benefit?",
        "Emily: No. Chris and I don't have to make a show of our relationship.",
        "Lily: Relationship? Is that what you're having with Chris? A relationship?",
        "Emily: Uh, yeah.",
        "Lily: Really? I thought Dusty and I were having a relationship. Until you slept with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I managed to see Bob once, until Chris had security throw me out.",
        "Margo: Oh, so you're asking me to pull rank on hospital security?",
        "Dusty: Well, since you're family, can you talk to him? I just want a chance to see Bob. After that, Chris can throw me out again.",
        "Tom: From what I understand, Chris had every right to throw you out of my father's room. Apparently after your visit, my dad wound up stressed and sedated.",
        "Dusty: I'm not the reason Chris drugged your father.",
        "Tom: Are you trying say that my father's condition is somehow Chris's fault?",
        "Dusty: That's exactly what I'm saying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Stop making it sound like I'm some kind of a home wrecker because I'm not.",
        "Lily: I didn't do that.",
        "Emily: No, I'm not. You and Dusty were not having a relationship. You were having an affair.",
        "Lily: Really? What would you call what you did with Dusty?",
        "Emily: A mistake.",
        "Lily: A mistake?",
        "Emily: Lily, it never should've happened.",
        "Lily: Oh, really. Why did it happen? Just to prove that you could do it? Get him back?",
        "Emily: I'm not going to have this conversation with you.",
        "Lily: You know, you're not a home-wrecker, you're just a whore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Why'd you pull away?",
        "Craig: Bad hand, remember?",
        "Meg: Sorry. Here, let's use the other one. You know, once your son starts -- what now?",
        "Craig: Look, I'm just -- I'm just not up to this, okay? Maybe I'm just a little tired still from yesterday.",
        "Meg: When you had your bout of food poisoning a few weeks back, you practically tackled me so you could feel the baby kick, but now you're too tired?",
        "Craig: All right. Maybe later.",
        "Meg: Maybe?",
        "Craig: You know, I would appreciate it if you didn't dissect every single word, since I've already told you I'm just not feeling very well.",
        "Meg: Okay. What gives, Craig? It's not that you're just not jumping to touch the baby and feel it kick, but you snatched your hand away like you can't bear to touch the baby or me. Well, you can't be angry at the baby. He hasn't done anything. So, that leaves me. What's going on with you, Craig?",
        "Craig: Meg, I know --",
        "Meg: What is it?",
        "Craig: I know I haven't been acting like the best dad this morning. Okay, I just -- chalk it up to still feeling sick about -- recent events.",
        "Meg: Where are you going?",
        "Craig: I need to take a shower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What did you just call me?",
        "Lily: You heard me. A whore. You know, that's somebody who sleeps with anybody that she can get her hands on.",
        "Emily: Okay, since we're throwing around accusations, Lily, how about adultery? Or did you happen to get a divorce from Holden while nobody was looking?",
        "Lily: Holden knew about Dusty and me. Does Chris know that you brought the New Year in with a big bang?",
        "Emily: Leave Chris out of it.",
        "Lily: Why should I do that? Why should I let you ruin his life the same way you ruined mine?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Now that is one hell of an accusation you just leveled at my brother. So, if you don't want to be slapped with a slander suit, you better have something to back that up.",
        "Dusty: Tom, your father's stroke doesn't sit right with me.",
        "Tom: Oh. And you base this on what? Your vast medical knowledge?",
        "Dusty: Chris knows more than what he's letting on. That's why I got to talk to Bob.",
        "Margo: Well that's not going to happen, Dusty. Bob is just now regaining consciousness. So, if the family doesn't want you in the room during recovery, you're going to respect their wishes.",
        "Dusty: Bob woke up and started talking, and Chris had him sedated. Am I the only one who thinks that's a little off?",
        "Tom: My brother is devastated about my father's condition. He's not only trying to give him the best care he can, but he's trying to run a hospital. So, you picked this family tragedy as grounds for, what, a personal attack?",
        "Dusty: Why would I do that, Tom?",
        "Tom: I don't know. 'Cause of Emily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Look, I don't want Dusty. Chris and I are very happy.",
        "Lily: Do very happy women have one-night stands?",
        "Emily: It was a mistake, okay? It was a mistake. You want Dusty, he's all yours. I'm not going to get in your way.",
        "Lily: You already have. You've always been there between me and Dusty because he wants you. He never wanted me, he always really wanted you.",
        "Chris: Hey, my father seems to be doing fine this morning. Which is more than I can say for you. What's wrong?",
        "Emily: No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. We're good.",
        "Chris: Am I interrupting something?",
        "Emily: No, not at all. Not at all. Don't you need to get to the hospital? I think you're already running late, right?",
        "Chris: And whose fault is that? I can wait for you, drop you off at the Intruder?",
        "Emily: No, no. That's okay. That's okay, Babe, I'll catch up with you later, okay? Bye.",
        "Lily: You are a pro.",
        "Emily: Stop saying that.",
        "Lily: You're a pro. The way you looked at him right in the eye, and you lied to him like that. Well I shouldn't be surprised. That's exactly the way you treated Dusty.",
        "Emily: I told Dusty. I was honest about the way I felt. But it's not my fault he wasn't listening to me.",
        "Lily: Maybe it was the timing. Hmm? Did you tell him before or after you slept with him that you weren't interested in him? How could he not understand your message? Wasn't it perfectly clear? You were so honest with him. Flaunting your relationship with Chris in front of him for months, and months, you just wanted to be a challenge. You wanted Dusty to fight for you, all along. That's what you wanted to do!",
        "Emily: Lily.",
        "Lily: All along!",
        "Emily: Lily, you are making a scene.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Did Chris tell you that? That I have it in for him because of Emily?",
        "Tom: Well, what other reason do you have for this personal vendetta?",
        "Dusty: Ask Chris.",
        "Margo: Well, what -- what exactly are we supposed to ask Chris?",
        "Dusty: Ask him about the fight he had with Bob just before Bob collapsed.",
        "Margo: What is he talking about?",
        "Tom: I don't have a clue. I don't think he does either.",
        "Dusty: I overheard the two of them going at it.",
        "Tom: Okay, okay. So they were working under severe strain. It's not a secret, it's not a cause for concern.",
        "Dusty: You got to understand that your brother isn't as cute as he used to be.",
        "Tom: Now, you know nothing about my brother.",
        "Margo: All I hear are accusations and insinuations. Nothing solid.",
        "Dusty: I understand that you guys are trying to do what's right for your family, but Chris isn't. He's out for himself.",
        "Margo: Donovan, you are skating on some pretty thin ice here.",
        "Dusty: The first thing he decided to do when he became chief of staff was green light the Evan Walsh/Craig Montgomery research project, which everyone knows Bob was against. You telling me all of this is a coincidence?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: What can I get you?",
        "Lily: Vodka. Very little soda.",
        "Jay: That's a pretty classy drink for this place.",
        "Lily: Oh, please. If you're going to say, what's a classy lady like you doing in a joint like this --",
        "Jay: Nope, I just thought I'd just sit over here and build a fire to ward off the chill.",
        "Lily: Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to say that.",
        "Jay: That's okay. It looks like you're having one of those days.",
        "Lily: One of those lives.",
        "Jay: I know what you're going through.",
        "Lily: I doubt it.",
        "Jay: Feeling like that one person you thought had your back just stabbed you in it? I've been there.",
        "Lily: So what do you do? Come here and drink your troubles away?",
        "Jay: That's one of my tricks. I've got a few others up my sleeve. But I'm not quite sure it's something a classy lady like you would go for.",
        "Lily: You'll never know unless you ask.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Jan. Hey.",
        "Nurse Jan: Oh, Meg. How are you and the baby?",
        "Meg: Just fine, thanks.",
        "Nurse Jan: Did you manage to get that husband of yours calmed down?",
        "Meg: Actually, that's why I'm here. I know this could get you into trouble, but I need your help.",
        "Nurse Jan: What kind of trouble are we talking about?",
        "Meg: I need to see my husband's medical records.",
        "Nurse Jan: Meg, that would be putting my job on the line.",
        "Meg: I know, I know, I know it's a lot to ask. But Craig has been acting really strange lately.",
        "Nurse Jan: Strange isn't the word for it. He was flipping out over a doll at a little lunch party.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. I know and it's not usually like him to do that. And that's why I'm worried about him, and I think maybe he's keeping something from me.",
        "Nurse Jan: What do you think it could be?",
        "Meg: Chris Hughes treated him just recently. They both said it was for an infection, but maybe it wasn't.",
        "Nurse Jan: You think it's something more serious?",
        "Meg: Craig has been so excited about the baby. He's been micromanaging my vitamins, touching my belly all the time --",
        "Nurse Jan: That's so sweet.",
        "Meg: Yeah, it's kind of making me crazy. But now Craig's whole attitude about the baby has changed. It's like he's scared. He's afraid that he won't be around to watch our son grow up.",
        "Nurse Jan: This is just standard issue pregnancy paranoia, Meg.",
        "Meg: Probably. But I have all these crazy thoughts going through my head. And I just need some answers.",
        "Nurse Jan: You're really worried, aren't you?",
        "Meg: He's my husband and the father of my baby. I need to know what's going on, and if there's anything I can do to help him. I know I'm asking for a lot.",
        "Nurse Jan: Yeah, you are. I'll see what I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You're right, it's really -- this is not my thing. I'm not being judgmental or anything, but I kind of had a small problem with these not too long ago. So, I said, no more. Never again.",
        "Jay: Of course, I understand. Major props to you.",
        "Lily: Lily. My name is Lily.",
        "Jay: Jay. But, just so you understand, these little babies aren't addictive.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "Jay: Cross my heart. Do I look like I want to end up like that?",
        "Lily: Who does?",
        "Jay: These are just for a little recreational relaxation. For when things get a little too heavy for me to handle without a little chemical help. Like when my friends stop acting like my friends, when my family gets on my case, when my honey keeps sending these mixed signals and getting mad when I misread them -- it helps put things back on an even keel.",
        "Lily: And which of those things got you here tonight?",
        "Jay: All of the above. You?",
        "Lily: Yeah, the same. So, those help?",
        "Jay: Check it out. Steady as a rock.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jay: You sure you don't to try one? Come on.",
        "Lily: No, thanks. No.",
        "Jay: Come on. What have you got to lose?",
        "Lily: Nothing. All right, just one. One.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So Chris is sleeping with Emily, big deal. So you're going to make him pay for that by hurting our father.",
        "Dusty: That's complete nonsense.",
        "Tom: Then where's your proof? Back up one of your accusations that Chris has done something to cause my father harm.",
        "Margo: Come one, Honey.",
        "Tom: No! He's not going to talk about my family like this.",
        "Dusty: I apologize. I shouldn't have come to you with this.",
        "Margo: No, you shouldn't have.",
        "Tom: I'll tell you this, I am 100% behind my brother on this one. So you stay the hell away from my father. I will slap you with a harassment suit that will make you wish you were the one in intensive care.",
        "Dusty: What happens when I get proof?",
        "Tom: I'm not holding my breath, Dusty. Back off! Stay the hell away from my family! Don't be the one that winds up sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jay: Oh, good choice.",
        "Lily: Ahh, thank you. Thank you. I feel good. I feel really good.",
        "Jay: If you feel half as good as you look, you must be on the moon right now.",
        "Lily: Hmmmm. Thank you very much. This song just makes me feel free. I haven't felt that way in a really long time.",
        "Jay: You know what's even better than being free?",
        "Lily: What's that?",
        "Jay: Not being alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Holden: Hey, Faith. How was dance class, Honey?",
        "Faith: Fine. Have you seen Mom?",
        "Holden: Isn't she with you? It's her day to pick you up.",
        "Faith: That's what I thought. But I've been here at Al's for 20 minutes.",
        "Holden: Well, maybe she's running late. Did you try her cell?",
        "Faith: It went straight to voicemail.",
        "Holden: All right, I'm on my way. Stay put.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I think the music stopped.",
        "Jay: Did it?",
        "Lily: I must've run out of quarters.",
        "Jay: Well, maybe that's a sign it's time for us to blow this joint and find a place where quarters and music won't be needed.",
        "Lily: I thought you were just trying to cheer me up.",
        "Jay: I thought it'd be nice if we could cheer each other up. You interested?",
        "Lily: I'm very interested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Hey Dad. Did Mom call you?",
        "Holden: Afraid not.",
        "Faith: I bet she just forgot.",
        "Holden: You know what? I bet something came up and she just couldn't reach us.",
        "Faith: Can we go home?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Bonnie: If this is your taste in fine dining, I better get to pick the movie.",

        "Dusty: I'm not in the mood.",
        "Emily: Do you have a death wish?",
        "Dusty: I'm really not in the mood.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you know what, neither am I, thanks to your girlfriend.",
        "Dusty: My what?",
        "Emily: Lily. Call her off, Dusty. Or I won't be responsible for what happens next.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse Jan: You so owe me, Meg. I took a peek, and it's just an infection. You're just paranoid. He'll take the medication, and he'll be fine in a few days. Are you satisfied?",
        "Meg: Okay, it says here there was xyphorex in his system. What's that?",
        "Nurse Jan: It's a new drug, it came out in the market after you retired from nursing.",
        "Meg: Thanks for the tact. So what is it used for?",
        "Nurse Jan: I've only seen it prescribed a couple a few times.",
        "Meg: Is it experimental?",
        "Nurse Jan: No, but there are some side effects. Doctors are discouraged from prescribing it to women of child bearing age because it can cause miscarriages.",
        "Meg: Okay, well there's no record here that it had been prescribed. So if it wasn't ingested, how'd the xyphorex end up in his system?",
        "Nurse Jan: Meg, an infection is an infection. Okay? Are you done?",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Look, apparently the xyphorex was the cause of the infection. So how could something like that happen? The xyphorex must have come in contact with this wound.",
        "[Meg remembering]",
        "Craig: And to our baby.",

        "Nurse Jan: Well, it's just a good thing it was him and not you.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Nurse Jan: If you had come in contact with the medication you might have lost your baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Lily's my friend, not my girlfriend.",
        "Emily: Okay, whatever, Dusty. I'm not going to argue semantics with you. She cornered me at the Lakeview and made a scene.",
        "Dusty: No she didn't. She wouldn't do that.",
        "Emily: Yes, she did. She did, and it's all because of you. Why the hell did you tell her about what happened New Year's Eve?",
        "Dusty: Why do you have a problem with the truth, Emily?",
        "Emily: I told you I didn't want to be with you --",
        "Dusty: Start by being honest with yourself.",

I shouldn't -- you know, I shouldn't go out to the farm, it wouldn't be a good idea for the kids to see you taking care of me. As you said, we don't want to give them false hope. I should stay here at a hotel, where I can get 24 hour service, I can get hot tea and soup. I'm not going to get that kind of service out at the farm.",
