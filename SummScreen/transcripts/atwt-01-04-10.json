        "Carly and Jack get close, as they ring in the New Year, but Carly pulls back reminding Jack that he is married and that he needs to tend to fixing it. Soon after, Carly, Craig and Jack are rescued, but there is only enough room for two people to go into town so Carly offers to stay behind with Craig much to Jack's chagrin. A horrified Janet awakens naked in bed with Dusty and immediately is defensive and wants to get home. Dusty tries to convince her that she did nothing wrong, but Janet is very upset. Dusty thinks she is trying to convince herself she didn't want this to happen when she really did. Katie tells Henry about her encounter and goodbye with Brad, as Henry tricks Katie into running into Simon while getting them some food. Katie learns Simon is working at Al's and planning on staying in town. Katie doesn't like the idea if it is about her. Simon wants to go legit. Katie is unsure at first, but then warms to the idea and heads home with Simon to have dinner with him and Henry. Katie, Simon and Henry enjoy some laughs, as they watch a Twilight Zone marathon. Katie feels a sense of happiness surrounded by Jacob, Henry and Simon. After Janet hurries off from Dusty, she runs into Jack in the lobby. Jack offers her words that she has wanted to hear for a very long time; he loves her, wants to make their marriage work and wants to come home. Janet is nervous and overwrought but is happy to hear those words. However she is gun shy, but Jack does his best to assuage her fears. Jack wants to stay at the Lakeview and celebrate a late New Years, but once Janet sees Dusty, she can't get out of there fast enough. Craig wants to make amends with Carly, but she wants none of it. He thinks he can help her get past Jack again. Carly just wants to take him home and be done with him. At the farm, Jack tries to cuddle up to Janet, but she is different now; she is angry and telling Jack that it is too late for them. He can't just recapture his life this easily; too much has happened. Jack doesn't understand, but Janet doesn't want to go back and she asks him to leave her guilt overtaking her. Jack is shocked because he thought Janet was happy that they were reconciling, but he does as she asks and leaves. Janet tells Teresa that her marriage is over, but she doesn't want to talk about it. Teresa asks her if there is anything going on with her and Dusty. A sensitive Janet snaps that there is nothing between her and Dusty, but Janet is not happy when she hears Teresa may be getting interested in Dusty. Dusty recalls his night with Janet. Craig stares at a photograph of Carly promising he is not giving up on her yet. Jack shows up at Carly's asking to spend the night on her couch again; he tells her sadly that Janet doesn't want to reconcile, as Carly is in disbelief. Jack is sure his marriage has ended now."

        "Katie: We're good. We're great, actually. He slept through the whole thing.",
        "Henry: Lucky kid.",
        "Katie: Where were you?",
        "Henry: I was at the diner, waiting for a drunken crowd that never showed arrived. You have no idea how much fun it is to keep a generator running for three people drinking coffee.",
        "Katie: Well, I guess everyone just stayed home.",
        "Henry: Yeah. I'm expecting a baby boom in September.",
        "Katie: Oh, good, lots of new friends for Jacob.",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm. Can I ask you something?",
        "Katie: Hmm?",
        "Henry: Why did you look like you were a little disappointed when it was me that was at the door?",
        "Katie: I wasn't. I just wasn't expecting you. That's all.",
        "Henry: Really? 'Cause I have a feeling that you were disappointed that it wasn't Simon who came a-knocking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Believe me, Carly, I know what I put Janet through, okay? She's been more patient than I deserve.",
        "Carly: Well, it's not gonna last forever.",
        "Jack: No, I know it won't.",

        "Jack: Yeah. I know what I have to do.",
        "Carly: Happy New Year, Jack.",
        "Jack: Happy New Year, Carly. [Rumbling] Oh, that's got to be a plow. Oh, yeah, they're finally clearing the roads.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, all we need now is some light.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Jack: You think maybe you can order the car to start working, 'cause --",
        "Carly: [Chuckles] I guess we're not gonna die here after all.",
        "Jack: No. No, I guess not.",
        "Carly: Craig? Wake up.",
        "Craig: [Coughs] God, I feel awful.",
        "Jack: But you look fantastic.",
        "Carly: They're plowing the roads. We're gonna be able to get out of here soon.",
        "Craig: Oh, thank God. I had the most horrible dream. I was in a tub, naked, and you were giving me a sponge bath.",
        "Carly: How do you feel, Craig?",
        "Craig: Like I've been run over by an 18-wheeler.",
        "Carly: Well -- oh, you're not so hot anymore, you know. I think your fever's broken.",
        "Jack: Guess that dunk in the pond was a miracle cure.",
        "Craig: I'm sure you would've preferred if I drowned.",
        "Jack: Yours words, not mine.",
        "Carly: Oh, stop it, now. You did as much to help him as I did.",
        "Craig: You mean the tub, the sponge bath? I didn't dream that?",
        "Carly: We had to get you warmed up as quickly as we could.",
        "Jack: And believe me, if it was a bad dream for you, it was a nightmare for me.",
        "Craig: All right. What happened in this cabin stays in the cabin. As soon as we go out that door, we never speak of it again.",
        "Jack: You're not gonna get argument here.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Ranger: You folks okay in here?",
        "Jack: Yeah, we're fine. Our cars are stuck.",
        "Ranger: Well, you're gonna need a truck for the one off the road.",
        "Jack: Hey, can we get a tow back to town, maybe a ride?",
        "Ranger: Sure can. But I only have room for two people. So one of you is gonna have to stay behind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You have no reason to feel guilty.",
        "Janet: Don't tell me how I'm supposed to feel.",
        "Dusty: Sometimes things just happen.",
        "Janet: This didn't just happen! Dusty, this wasn't a random accident, okay?",
        "Dusty: I'm glad you stayed.",
        "Janet: Oh, I'll bet you are.",
        "Dusty: I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry, I -- I'm sorry. I didn't either.",
        "Dusty: I wish you weren't so upset about it.",
        "Janet: Oh, boy, this was a huge mistake, okay?",
        "Dusty: And you regret it.",
        "Janet: Of course I do! This was so wrong.",
        "Dusty: Come on, you're acting like you committed a crime.",
        "Janet: Adultery is a crime.",
        "Dusty: Well, if that were true, everybody would be in jail.",
        "Janet: Okay. All right. Let me put it to you this way. I am married. I took sacred vows.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. You're married. Your husband stood you up on New Year's Eve. You stayed here with me. What do all these things say about your marriage?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, he's ready. Are you ready?",
        "Carly: You know, I think that Craig should go back with the ranger, Jack.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? It's his fault we got stuck out here to begin with.",
        "Carly: He needs to see a doctor.",
        "Jack: Come on! The tow truck will be back for him eventually.",
        "Carly: What if he gets worse, Jack?",
        "Jack: How is that my problem, Carly?",
        "Craig: Compassionate as ever, Jack.",
        "Jack: Hey, Craig, whatever compassion I had for you died a long time ago.",
        "Carly: Stop it! This -- this is why you should just go on ahead, and I'll hang back with Craig, and we'll come later, okay?",
        "Jack: Carly, the kids are gonna miss you. They're gonna be worried about you.",
        "Carly: What if his fever comes back? I can't live with that on my conscience.",
        "Craig: Thank you, Carly.",
        "Jack: Okay, h-he's ready.",
        "Carly: Just go, Jack. There's someone else who needs you to save her tonight.",
        "Jack: Okay. Have fun. Oh, and, Craig, your clothes reek of pond scum.",
        "Craig: Where are they?",
        "Jack: I trashed them.",
        "Craig: Are you out of your mind? That's a $4,000 suit!",
        "Jack: Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You don't get to pass judgment on my marriage.",
        "Dusty: Maybe the mistletoe was a moment of weakness, but this wasn't. You wanted it to happen. I wanted it to happen.",
        "Janet: You don't know what I want. You really don't.",
        "Dusty: You won't admit what happened between us meant something.",
        "Janet: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Dusty: Then why can't you look me in the eye right now?",
        "Janet: Because I don't want to talk about this!",
        "Dusty: Why not?",
        "Janet: I'd rather just forget that it ever happened!",
        "Dusty: Well, the more try to forget it happened, the more you can't think about anything else.",
        "Janet: You are wrong. You are so wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I saw Brad.",
        "Henry: You did? For real?",
        "Katie: Yeah. For real. He came to me on Christmas Eve. And we said goodbye.",
        "Henry: Oh, Bubbles --",
        "Katie: He's really gone now.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, I think he is. I, uh, I had a goodbye with him myself. Are you okay?",
        "Katie: I'm sad. But it feels right. I mean, I wish he was here, but I know he can't be anymore. And at least we got to say a real goodbye. It was really wonderful. We needed to let him go.",
        "Henry: Well, believe me, he didn't want to let you go. But he loved you and Jacob enough to know that that's what he had to do.",
        "Katie: Yeah, he did.",
        "Henry: I missed that.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Henry: That smile. It has been a long time since I've seen that smile.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Henry: Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Your smile can light up a room. I think -- I think that's a sign.",
        "Katie: I think it's time we put that kind of stuff to rest for a while. Are you thirsty? You want something to drink?",
        "Henry: No. No, thanks. You know, you never really answered my question.",
        "Katie: What question?",
        "Henry: Well, when you opened the door, you were hoping that it was Simon, weren't you?",
        "Katie: Oh, first you're a ghost whisperer, now you're a mind reader?",
        "Henry: It's okay. It's okay. You don't have to answer me.",
        "Katie: I asked Simon to leave. Why would I want him to come back?",
        "Henry: You tell me.",
        "Katie: I don't. I mean, I do feel bad that I asked him to leave, but even he agreed that it was best for both of us that he did.",
        "Henry: Okay, then.",
        "Katie: So, is he still sleeping on your couch?",
        "Henry: Why do you ask?",
        "Katie: Oh, no reason. I just -- he told me that he was only staying for a couple more days. I was just wondering if he was okay.",
        "Henry: Oh, you don't have to worry about Simon. The man is bulletproof. Whatever he's doing, he's not spending New Year's Eve alone.",
        "Katie: No, I'm sure he's not.",
        "Henry: And you're okay with that?",
        "Katie: Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Henry: No reason. Hey, you want to get a burger?",
        "Katie: Now?",
        "Henry: Yes, now. I didn't have a chance to eat before the power went out, and I'm starving. What do you say? That's no way to start a new year. Let's -- let's go over to Al's, get something to eat.",
        "Katie: Are you serious?",
        "Henry: Yes, I'm serious. Al's is open all night. And the roads are clear.",
        "Katie: I can't take Jacob out now.",
        "Henry: Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll call them for a takeout order, and then you can go pick it up.",
        "Katie: Why me?",
        "Henry: Because you've been cooped up in here, and you need to get out and have some fresh air. Don't worry, I will look after the little guy.",
        "Katie: It would be kind of nice to get out for a bit.",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm. I thought so. Go ahead. Go. I'll tell them to have it ready for when you arrive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Janet? I cannot believe you're still here! I cannot believe that you waited here this whole time. It's been hours. I'm -- I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I missed our new year's date.",
        "Janet: It's okay.",
        "Jack: No, it's not. It seems like I've been doing that a lot to you lately, keeping you waiting.",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Jack: Yes. Yes, I -- yes, I have. Want to hear something funny?",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Jack: The entire time I was in that cabin, I think I finally got my head straightened out.",
        "Janet: While you were in a cabin with Carly and Craig?",
        "Jack: Well, maybe because of it. Yeah. Being there with them in the cold, in the dark, I got a chance to figure out what really matters in my life. Everything I thought about started with you.",
        "Janet: We don't have to talk about this right now.",
        "Jack: No, we do. Listen, I've got to say this, and you've got to hear it. You've been waiting for this. You deserve it. I love you. I would be honored if you let me come back home.",
        "Janet: Jack --",
        "Jack: I put a lot of strain on our marriage. I know that. And on you. I'm sorry. I really am. But it's a new year. We can start all over. And I wasn't really sure that you wanted to. I mean, you could have just written me off altogether. But when I came in and I saw you sitting there, I -- well, I hope that the fact that you had waited here this long means that you're willing to give me second chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Ah, here we go.",
        "Craig: You're not serious.",
        "Carly: Try it on. It looks like it'll fit.",
        "Craig: That's not the point. You don't know how long it's been in there.",
        "Carly: Craig, you have to wear something.",
        "Craig: No, thanks. I'll take my chances.",
        "Carly: Stop being a baby, and put it on!",
        "Craig: Turn around.",
        "Carly: Seriously?",
        "Craig: I'd like some privacy.",
        "Carly: Oh, for Pete's sake. You know, Jack probably did save your life. You could have thanked him.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, I'll send him flowers.",
        "Carly: I'm serious.",
        "Craig: You know, maybe if he hadn't acted as if he'd rather I didn't make it out of that pond.",
        "Carly: That's Jack.",
        "Craig: Unlike you, the rest of the world doesn't need to see past his many flaws.",
        "Carly: Or yours.",
        "Craig: Fair enough. You can turn now.",
        "Carly: You look good.",
        "Craig: It smells like the '80s.",
        "Carly: [ Laughs ] Seriously, why did you go out there and try to be a hero when you're so sick?",
        "Craig: I was thinking that I didn't want anything to happen to you.",
        "Carly: You could've drowned in that pond. You could have died from hypothermia.",
        "Craig: Tell me the truth. Would you have cared?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I think she's doing a lot better now, don't you? Yeah. It was a little dicey there, with your dad hanging around, but he did the right thing, and he moved on, and now your mom can move on with her life. I know you miss him. Yeah, we all miss him. [Chuckles] But you know what? I'm gonna do everything I can to be there for you. Whatever you need, whatever your mom needs, I'm gonna make sure you have it. I promise. I'm gonna be there for you two. For the rest of your lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I thought you were leaving.",
        "Simon: I decided to stay.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Simon: I like it here.",
        "Katie: Oh, now I see why Henry sent me for the takeout.",
        "Simon: What do you mean?",
        "Katie: Come on. What did he do, call right after I left?",
        "Simon: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Katie: Oh, really. You want me to believe that you weren't in on it.",
        "Simon: In on what?",
        "Katie: Henry sent me over here to run into you.",
        "Simon: Oh, you know Henry. The guy's always on his own trip.",
        "Katie: Okay, but how would he even know you were here? [Clears throat]",
        "Man: Think you could give me that coffee before it's ice-cold?",
        "Simon: Oh, yep, yep, yep. No worries. I'm on it. I'm on it.",
        "Katie: What are you doing?",
        "Simon: Working.",
        "Katie: Here?",
        "Simon: Yeah, you want to know tonight's specials?",
        "Katie: I don't believe it.",
        "Simon: Now you know why Henry knew I was here.",
        "Katie: Why are you doing this?",
        "Simon: Um, well, the main reason is -- I don't want to live the life I used to live. So I donated all the money I earned illegally to charities. Therefore, I needed a regular job. Henry needed a waiter. Here I am.",
        "Katie: I don't believe it.",
        "Simon: It's only until I find something more permanent.",
        "Katie: Permanent? You're staying in Oakdale.",
        "Simon: As I said before, I like it here. It's not a problem, is it?",
        "Katie: Yeah, it's a problem. A big one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You want me to give you a second chance after you spent New Year's Eve with Carly?",
        "Jack: And Craig. Stuck in a cabin. Janet, look, I know you're upset. So was I.",
        "Janet: About what?",
        "Jack: About you kissing Dusty. And I understand that it doesn't compute. I've been spending weeks on my ex-wife's couch, okay? And all you did was kiss a friend once under the mistletoe. Let's just forget the whole thing.",
        "Janet: What, just forget about the past?",
        "Jack: Well, not forget, per se, but learn from it. Get our marriage back on track.",
        "Janet: Is that what you really want?",
        "Jack: Of course it's what I really want. You know, I learned something else, too. I've been playing with fire.",
        "Janet: With Carly?",
        "Jack: With you. You're a beautiful, desirable woman. I can't expect you to just sit around and wait for me. You're better than that.",
        "Janet: I wouldn't be so sure.",
        "Jack: I am. Let's not wait around anymore. Let's get on with it. Let's get our marriage going again.",
        "Janet: Do you really mean it?",
        "Jack: I do.",
        "Janet: What happens when Carly calls again with some sort of an emergency or a crisis, huh?",
        "Jack: All right, unless it has something to do with the kids, then she's gonna have to find somebody else.",
        "Janet: Do you really mean that? Because that's the only way this is gonna work, right? You have to commit to us.",
        "Jack: I know. It's not too late. We can still have that New Year's date? Come on, I'll get us a room, champagne. Let's do this right.",
        "Janet: We can't stay here.",
        "Jack: Why not? What's stopping us?",
        "Janet: We've got a bedroom at the farm. What do we need to spend money on a hotel room for?",
        "Jack: It's okay to be impractical every once in a while. Come on, it'll be fun. We'll have all the privacy we need. It'll be just the two of us. And I hear they have new beds here with Jacuzzis.",
        "Janet: Jack, I want to go home.",

        "Carly: Of course I would have cared. Put them on.",
        "Craig: Is that the truth?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I mean, how would I have explained all this to the police?",
        "Craig: That's not the reason.",
        "Carly: You're can think whatever you want.",
        "Craig: You care about me, Carly. Why can't you just admit that?",
        "Carly: How do they fit?",
        "Craig: Perfectly. And if you didn't care about me, you would've left me here. And I appreciate that you stayed to look after me.",
        "Carly: Well, you shouldn't. I would've done it for anyone.",
        "Craig: We both know that's not true.",
        "Carly: You know what I know? I know that you slept with my sister while I was in rehab, and then you broke her heart because, apparently you hadn't gotten me out of your system.",
        "Craig: Yeah. I don't think I ever will.",
        "Carly: Oh, enough. And I don't even want to get in to how we ended up here.",
        "Craig: I thought you didn't want to talk about that.",
        "Carly: You're right. I don't. It's not worth it.",
        "Craig: I said I was sorry that I tricked you about the meeting.",
        "Carly: Good. 'Cause if tricking me into spending time with you is your way of trying to start some relationship, you're worse off than I thought.",
        "Craig: I don't think that.",
        "Carly: Good.",
        "Craig: I'd just like to think that we could still be friends.",
        "Carly: I have enough friends.",
        "Craig: I don't.",
        "Carly: And you know something? The friends that I have, they wouldn't abduct me in the middle of a storm.",
        "Craig: Okay. Everybody in the world is a better person than me. I get it. I just want to know if there's a chance.",
        "Carly: There's no chance for anything.",
        "Craig: Because of Jack?",
        "Carly: Because of you!",

        "Dusty: Well, I don't like seeing my top business asset wearing herself down.",
        "Teri: That's probably the sweetest thing you've ever said to me. What happened? Did you get stood up?",
        "Dusty: No, she was there.",
        "Teri: Anybody I know?",
        "Dusty: Would I tell you?",
        "Teri: Sorry I asked.",
        "Dusty: How'd we do tonight?",
        "Teri: Not well. I mean, the band could only do one of their acoustic sets, and after that, everybody left. It's gonna take us weeks to make up what we lost.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry about it.",
        "Teri: There's a ton of food that went to waste, too.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. Did it spoil?",
        "Teri: No, the power wasn't out long enough. The refrigerator stayed cold.",
        "Dusty: Food's good. We'll give it to Four Wheel Feast. They can give it to the food shelters around town. We'll pack it up in a second. What?",
        "Teri: Nothing. You just -- you keep surprising me.",

        "Jack: You are so right. It'll be great to be in our bedroom.",
        "Janet: Jack --",

        "Janet: Don't.",
        "Jack: What's wrong?",

        "Simon: Okay, you know when people ask me where my home is, for that one split second before I lie, I always want to say Oakdale.",
        "Katie: I just don't want this to be about you and me. But it is, isn't it?",
        "Simon: No, not entirely. I mean, it's also about that little boy of yours. I think he's awesome.",
        "Man: Honey, if he doesn't want you, I'll take you!",
        "Simon: Excuse me? What?",

        "Simon: Hey, you're out. Go on. Happy New Year, Brother! Have a good one! How's that guy?",
        "Katie: You wouldn't happen to know what happened to his watch, would you?",
        "Simon: Oh. It was too classy for him anyway.",
        "Katie: So much for going legit.",
        "Simon: Hey, come on. Baby steps.",
        "Katie: You can't keep it. You got to give it back.",
        "Simon: But it's so nice! Okay, I'll take it to the police station and say the drunk fool left it here.",
        "Katie: Say whatever you want. You're not keeping it.",
        "Simon: See? You're just so good for me.",
        "Katie: Is my takeout ready?",
        "Simon: Oh, I'll check with the kitchen. That's where they make it. I'll be back in one second. All done. Do you want me to carry it?",
        "Katie: Aren't you working?",
        "Simon: Nah, I'm done.",
        "Katie: Well, would you like to come back and share it?",

        "Katie: I do. But only for a couple hours.",
        "Henry: Okay, well, prepare to embrace the best of American culture.",
        "Simon: Weren't these made, like, 50 years ago?",
        "Katie: You've heard of it?",
        "Simon: Yeah, I've heard of this mystical thing called American TV.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I supposed in the outback, all you had to watch were crocodiles mating.",

        "Katie: Well, why don't you let me decide what that is.",
        "Henry: Okay, fair enough. Come on, now you're missing it!",
        "Katie: Oh, is this the one where that lady gets terrorized in her home, and then you find out she's a giant?",

        "Katie: Sorry. Sorry.",
        "Simon: Don't worry about it. No worries.",
        "Henry: Well, I'm sure they have television shows in Australia, but you've never seen anything like this!",
        "Simon: So tell me something. Are they gonna show the one about the con man who can change his face to look like other people? That was my favorite. Oh, yeah, we used to wire the crocodiles for cable TV.",
