        "Henry: It's not an art project, Katie.",
        "Katie: I'm not hungry.",
        "Henry: Well, then why did you order the most expensive item on the menu? Hmm?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I guess the shock of what happened just killed my appetite.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Who would have thought that Mike would fall in love with Jennifer?",
        "Katie: He's not in love with her.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay. What shock are you referring to then?",
        "Katie: You offering to pay for lunch.",
        "Henry: See, now, that hurts. That stings. All right? Here I go, out of my way to try to get you to wear something else besides your bathrobe and bunny slippers and I take you down here to the chez Lakeview and what do I get in return? Mockery.",
        "Katie: Let's just stay off the subject of Mike, okay?",
        "Henry: Okay. Have you read any good books lately?",
        "Katie: I think he hates me.",
        "Henry: Oh, no, he was angry. And that was last night. Today as another day, Scarlett.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but you didn't see him. I told him I was sorry for everything, it didn't make a difference.",
        "Henry: Yeah, not everyone can overlook lying and manipulation as easily as I can.",
        "Katie: Just give me some advice.",
        "Henry: You never take my advice. I told you, tell the man the truth.",
        "Katie: But that's just the thing, Henry. I told Mike the truth. And now he never wants to see me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mrs. Walsh? Well, if it isn't the tush that made Street Jeans famous?",
        "Mike: Lucinda's not here, gorgeous.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then should you be tampering with her wiring?",
        "Jennifer: Hey -- didn't you do that to me yesterday?",
        "Mike: Kiss you?",
        "Jennifer: Kiss me, tell me I'm a wonderful, honest woman and then run off?",
        "Mike: Sorry. I had a lot on my mind.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Well, I should -- I should go find Lucinda.",
        "Mike: No, Jen. Don't go. There's something I haven't told you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: All right. You understand that -- just so you know, my wife is not a hostile witness. She volunteered to take the polygraph. So there's need to lean on her too hard, okay?",
        "Detective Langston: All right.",
        "Paul: Is that one of the benefits of being married to the chief? You get the kid glove treatment every time you commit a crime?",
        "Hal: What are you doing here, Paul?",
        "Paul: I'm here to make sure that my kid brother, because of Emily's \"voluntary cooperation,\" doesn't wind up getting indicted.",
        "Hal: Paul -- if you're implying that I would sell out my son to protect my wife, you're full of it. And I don't see any reason why you're here, so I suggest you leave.",
        "Paul: Because of Emily, my wife is constantly terrified. She wakes up every morning and braces herself for whatever sick reminder she's gonna get that day of her dead baby. Because of Emily, my little brother doesn't trust me anymore, or Rosanna -- or you for that matter.",
        "Hal: I know what's lost, Paul.",
        "Paul: Well, then how can you let her get away with it, Hal?",
        "Hal: All I'm doing is trying to make sure that Emily gets a fair shake. Right now, she is scared out of her mind. And I do not want that polygraph machine reading that as guilty.",
        "Paul: Do you honestly think that she's not guilty?",
        "Hal: I honestly think she deserves the benefit of the doubt. And I'm going to give it to her.",
        "Paul: Right. That's more than you gave Will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Emily remembering]",
        "Hal: You bought the doll. Don't you know what this is? This is a photograph. From the security camera at the store.",
        "Emily: It's not me. It can't be! [Doorbell rings] Oh, Alison, I'm so happy to see you.",
        "Alison: What is going on?",
        "Emily: What have you heard?",
        "Alison: Will told me this wild story about you spooking Rosanna.",
        "Emily: Yeah, it's wild, all right. You have no idea of how much I need your support right now.",
        "Alison: No kidding. I mean, Emily, what were you thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi. I saw you drive up. I thought maybe we should talk outside, first, so the kids can't hear.",
        "Holden: I am moving out. They have to hear about it sooner or later.",
        "Lily: I just don't want them to worry about something that might not happen.",
        "Holden: It's already happened.",
        "Lily: I know what you said last night. But we can fix this. I mean, it's us. We can fix anything.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I know, I used to think that, too. But you just kept pushing me farther and farther away.",
        "Lily: But I was grieving.",
        "Holden: And I wanted to help you. But you made it very clear that you didn't want anything to do with me anymore.",
        "Lily: That's not true. I love you. I'll do anything you want. I'll go to counseling. I'll give you space, whatever you want.",
        "Holden: I never wanted space. I've had enough space this past year to last me an entire lifetime.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I hurt you. And that I didn't put you first, but I'm going to change. This is a time of New Year's resolutions. This is my resolution.",
        "Holden: It shouldn't be a resolution. It should come naturally. Like it used to.",
        "Lily: It will. Just give me one more chance. Please.",
        "Holden: Let's not do this.",
        "Lily: Do what? Fight for our marriage?",
        "Holden: I am tired of fighting. I don't want to do it anymore.",
        "Lily: So what, what does this then? You come by to visit the children, just dropping by?",
        "Holden: I'm here because we need to make them understand.",
        "Lily: Understand what? That their father is walking out on them?",
        "Holden: I will never abandon my children.",
        "Lily: No, just their mother.",
        "Luke: Mom? Dad? Is everything okay?",
        "Holden: No, Luke. It's not okay. And it's time that we deal with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: Flour, sugar, butter -- what else? [Knock on door] Come in. Vanilla. All right. Where would she keep vanilla?",
        "Carly: Left cupboard, top shelf.",
        "Julia: Emma's not here.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm not here to see Emma. Actually, I'm here to see you.",
        "Julia: Now, why would you do that?",
        "Carly: Whatcha making?",
        "Julia: Apple pie.",
        "Carly: Apple pie in Emma's kitchen? She's the master of pies --",
        "Julia: What do you want, Carly?",
        "Carly: Believe it or not, Julia, I want to help you.",
        "Julia: I don't need your help. Or your advice.",
        "Carly: Someday, you might thank me. And so might J.J.",
        "Julia: You know what? You better leave my son out of this, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack told me that he was supposed to spend some time with the boy last night, but something with work came up. He feels terrible about that.",
        "Julia: Good.",
        "Carly: No. Julia, it isn't really good. You can make him feel guilty, you can make him feel bad about himself, but the fact is, he is doing the best he can.",
        "Julia: Yeah? Well, so am I.",
        "Carly: Are you really?",
        "Julia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: To me, it seems like you're picking at scabs, trying to be sure the wound doesn't heal. And as long as you continue to act like a victim, you're never gonna get whatever it is you want.",
        "Julia: Gee, I don't see myself as a victim, Carly.",
        "Carly: Unfortunately, Jack does. He's my husband. And I don't really want him walking around consumed with guilt.",
        "Julia: That'd be a shame if it got in the way of your dinner conversation, wouldn't it?",
        "Carly: Do you have any idea what it means that Jack is a cop? It's not a job you can phone in, Julia. It requires commitment. It requires concentration. If you drop your guard just one time, somebody might put a knife in your face, and then before you know it, your car might go off a bridge.",
        "Julia: What are you saying, Carly? If Jack gets hurt at work, that's my fault?",
        "Carly: No. No. What I'm saying is that you and your son need to understand that with a police officer in the family, sometimes cancellations happen. It isn't personal. You and J.J. need to understand some basic rules about give and take.",
        "Julia: Yeah, I give and you take.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You moved out last night? I never even heard you.",
        "Holden: That's because I tried to be quiet, so I wouldn't wake you guys.",
        "Luke: Well, then, where'd you go?",
        "Holden: I stayed at the Lakeview. And today, I went out to the farm. And that's where I'm gonna be staying. I'm gonna be staying with your grandmother.",
        "Faith: Mommy's crying.",
        "Lily: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Luke: When will we see you?",
        "Lily: Your can see your dad anytime you want.",
        "Holden: That's right. So -- every day.",
        "Faith: Can we still have tea parties with my dolls?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Luke: What about soccer?",
        "Holden: I'm gonna be going to all the games, I'll take you to the practices. Just like I always did.",
        "Luke: Only you won't be living here?",
        "Holden: Only I won't be living here. You okay?",
        "Luke: I guess.",
        "Holden: Any questions that you wanted to ask?",
        "Lily: You can ask us anything. You know that.",
        "Luke: Are you and Mom getting divorced?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You honestly think I did those things to Rosanna?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Emily: Let me ask you, if I hadn't blown your trust with Chris -- would you still think I did it?",
        "Alison: Look, none of that matters right now. Just tell me what's going on.",
        "Emily: I don't know. When will came to me and accused me of being in Fairwinds and shoving the doll in his face, I thought he was the one that lost it.",
        "Alison: And then what?",
        "Emily: And then Hal showed me this. It's from the surveillance tape at the store where the doll was bought. And there's also a credit card receipt signed by me.",
        "Alison: Emily, this picture, it's you.",
        "Emily: I've spent the entire morning trying to convince myself that it couldn't be. Because, Ali, I don't remember being here. I don't remember standing there buying the doll, signing the receipt. None of it!",
        "Alison: Well, maybe it is someone who looks like you -- a lot like you.",
        "Emily: I know. That's what I said. I mean, it's the only thing that makes sense. So I agreed to take a lie detector test. I offered because I thought I would pass. And then I had this flash or something, I suddenly saw myself standing at Fairwinds holding the doll.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Emily: I mean, I don't know why? Why would I want to torture Rosanna like that? I'm a mother. I know what it's like to love a child. And -- when Rosanna lost Cabot, I ached for her.",
        "Alison: Well, then there has to be some other explanation.",
        "Emily: Thank you. Oh, my God, thank you for saying that.",
        "Alison: Well, where does Hal stand with all of this?",
        "Emily: He doesn't know about the flashback, or whatever you want to call it. He's counting on the polygraph test to clear me.",
        "Alison: Well, you have to postpone the test.",
        "Emily: How?",
        "Alison: Say that you're sick or something. When I was in jail, people used to talk about ways to beat those machines.",
        "Emily: Are you serious?",
        "Alison: Yeah, but the thing is, we need time.",
        "Hal: Hey, Em. You ready? We're all set up at down at the station. It's time to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I mean it, Henry. I actually did tell mike the truth this time. I told him all about Pilar, about Simon, about everything. And all he said was that he could never trust me again. Even though I explained how it all happened.",
        "Henry: Maybe he doesn't want an explanation.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: I mean, maybe he needs to hear that for what you did --",
        "Katie: Hey. I wasn't alone here.",
        "Henry: Okay, for what we did, that there are no excuses. You gotta plead guilty, I mean, really guilty, as in nolo contendere.",
        "Katie: You're right.",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: He probably just thinks I was trying to justify what I did. I've gotta go.",
        "Henry: Go! Bite the bullet. Tell him that you're gonna throw yourself on the mercy of the court and you'll do whatever it takes to win him back. Tell him you love him.",
        "Katie: I already told him I loved him.",
        "Henry: Well, tell him again.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: So, that's the whole story.",
        "Jennifer: So Katie hasn't been with her husband since she left Oakdale?",
        "Mike: Since before then. Once she found out he'd hired Pilar, she said she never wanted to see him again. Then she let me believe that the two of them went off to Australia together.",
        "Jennifer: And Henry helped her every step of the way. Calling her, pretending to be Simon? And thanks to that little performance, I ended up spending more of my holidays with Katie than with my own family! She manipulated us. She manipulated you.",
        "Mike: I'll tell you what makes me really mad. She thinks the end justifies the means, that all you have to do is tell someone that you love them, and you can do whatever the hell you want.",
        "Jennifer: That sounds a lot like my mother. Be careful, Mike. Women like that can do a lot of damage.",
        "Mike: Whoa, Jen. No offense, but Barbara is in her own special category.",
        "Jennifer: But she wasn't always. She used to be a lot more like Katie. She would do anything for the people she loved. But then, as people tried to start breaking away to have a life other than the one that she'd written for them, that's when things changed. So just -- watch out.",
        "Mike: I'm a tough guy, remember? Now, what's wrong?",
        "Jennifer: Even tough guys can get hurt. I know how bad this could get. And --",
        "Mike: Go on.",
        "Jennifer: And maybe, until this whole thing with Katie is resolved, maybe it would be better for you -- if we didn't see each other.",
        "Mike: Is that what you want to do?",
        "Jennifer: Me? No.",
        "Mike: Me neither. So why don't you tell me what you want?",
        "Jennifer: I want to kiss you. I want to hold you and never let go. I want to forget that stupid pact we made to go slow and be careful and be sure of everything.",
        "Mike: That's pretty direct.",
        "Jennifer: I need you to be direct with me. Katie's beautiful and suddenly available and no matter what she's done, there was a time you wanted to marry her. That is huge, Mike. And maybe -- maybe it changes things between us. And if it does, then the worst thing you could possibly do would be to spare my feelings. So don't. Okay, just tell me how you feel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Detective Langston's waiting for us. The sooner we get this over with, the better.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Okay. You know, I was just wondering --",
        "Alison: Can I come, too? Emily was just about to tell me what arrangements I should make for Daniel, but we still need some time to figure that out.",
        "Emily: I really need her support. I told her everything and she believes I'm innocent.",
        "Hal: Hey. I believe in you, too. Will's my son, but nobody wants you to pass that test any more than I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: This is what you call a separation. It's gonna give us a little time to think. And a separation doesn't necessarily mean that a marriage is gonna end.",
        "Luke: Do you still love Mom?",
        "Lily: Your father and I care about each other very much.",
        "Holden: That's right. I love your mom. I love her very much. Just like I love you kids. You guys are my family. And that never changes. No matter where I live. Ever.",
        "[Natalie crying]",
        "Lily: Oh, that's Natalie's waking up. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You got a lot of nerve, calling me selfish.",
        "Julia: You are, Carly. I mean, you show up here and you tell me how I'm supposed to feel, how my son is supposed to feel --",
        "Carly: I am trying to protect J.J., because you won't do it!",
        "Julia: Don't you dare!",
        "Carly: You are so consumed with yourself that you refuse to --",
        "Julia: Do not pretend that you care about my son, all right! If Jack drop- kicked that boy out of his life, you would be so thrilled, Carly. Because then I'd be gone.",
        "Carly: You always accuse people of ulterior motives when they're trying to help you? Maybe that's why you're so screwed up.",
        "Julia: Don't worry about me, Carly. J.J. and I, we don't want your pity, okay? So you tell Jack that he doesn't have to worry about J.J anymore. Because we're no longer part of his life.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Carly: Careful, girl. I have tried to be nice, but there is a part of me that is anything but. And I don't think you want to tangle with her.",
        "Katie: I gave up on us. But I'm not gonna walk away this time. I'm never gonna make that mistake again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Julia, I didn't come here to try and run you and J.J. out of Jack's life.",
        "Julia: What's the matter? You afraid to tell Jack that you tried to take over and it backfired?",
        "Carly: I'm not afraid of Jack. We share everything, even the problems.",
        "Julia: What are you implying, that J.J. and I are a problem for Jack? Because I don't think so, Carly. I think we're just more of a problem for you.",
        "Carly: Julia --",
        "Julia: We're done here. I have a pie to bake.",
        "Carly: Careful, girl. I have tried to be nice, but there's a part of me that is anything but. And I don't think you want to tangle with her.",
        "Julia: I think you better watch out, Carly. 'Cause, you know what? I've lost so much, I don't give a damn what you do.",

        "Paul: How's you first day back? Good?",
        "Will: Yeah. I met some kids. They're pretty cool. Into the same music and stuff. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Paul: Whoa, whoa, wait! Look, Rosanna and I found something last night. And I think we -- we really need to talk about it.",

        "Paul: He's gonna have to. Look, Will, the important thing is that Rosanna and I know the truth. And we want you to know how sorry we are. And we want you back.",
        "Will: No way.",
        "Paul: Don't say that.",
        "Will: Paul, I'm just facing facts. Anytime anything goes wrong in that house, I'm gonna be the first place you look. I hope you and Rosanna have a great life. But don't ask me to be in it.",

        "Hal: Honey, don't be nervous. It's just questions and answers.",
        "Emily: That's what worries me. I've done some things in my life, things I'm not proud of. What if some of the questions reminds me of those things, from my past -- things that I feel guilty about? Is the machine gonna pick up on that and think I'm hiding something?",
        "Hal: No. Absolutely not. I'm gonna go in and see if Detective Langston is ready for us, okay? Emily? Okay.",
        "Hal: All right.",
        "Alison: Here. Take it.",
        "Emily: A thumbtack?",
        "Alison: Put it on the floor. About a minute into the questions, step on it, but be random, don't just do it on the hard questions.",
        "Emily: What for?",
        "Alison: The pain will make your heart beat faster and stuff. It'll mess up the results.",

        "Emily: All right, you know what? Call Mom, find out when she's off from work and then drop him off at her place. And then go back to my house and pick up his backpack. 'Cause it's got all his overnight things in it.",
        "Alison: He's not going to need that.",
        "Emily: Please, just do as I say.",
        "Alison: Okay, but you'll be home before dinner.",

        "Jennifer: Mike, you and Katie had everything going for you. You had just gotten engaged when her husband came back out of the blue. He was the only thing standing in your way, and now he's no longer an issue.",
        "Mike: Maybe there are other issues.",

        "Mike: Does that answer your question?",
        "Jennifer: Actually, yeah.",
        "Mike: Are you sure? No more insecurities?",
        "Jennifer: Well, no more than normal. Let's just say I will feel a lot better when we finally -- we should have made love a long time ago, mike. Suddenly I'm just -- I'm asking myself why we thought we had to put it off.",
        "Mike: Hey, look. We took our time for a reason, all right? It wasn't Katie then. And it isn't Katie now.",
        "Jennifer: You sure?",
        "Mike: Sure.",

        "Katie: I was driving by and I saw your car in Ms. Walsh's driveway -- no, stop, that's not true. I called around town until I found out where you were. See, I'm turning over a new leaf. No more lies, not even little white ones.",
        "Mike: Am I supposed to be impressed?",
        "Katie: I'm just trying to let you know that you can trust me. That I can be 100% honest.",
        "Mike: I thought you did that last night. You told me everything you said was true.",
        "Katie: I told you why I did what I did. I did it because I love you. And I know loving someone doesn't make lying right. I know that now. And I'm sorry, Mike. I'm sorry for everything I did to you.",
        "Mike: I accept your apology. It's just, it's too late.",
        "Katie: But why? I'm not trying to justify it or make excuses. I know I was wrong. I know that now. I just -- I need a chance to make it up to you. Can you give me that chance?",
        "Mike: I don't think so.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Mike: We see life differently. Your rules are not the same as my rules. We are not good for each other, Katie.",

        "Jennifer: Well, you know, I'm hoping that you know that all the planning and plotting you did -- is a complete waste of time. Because, Mike and I are going ahead with our relationship. And none of your little games are going to stop us.",
        "Henry: Games? What games?",
        "Jennifer: Such a nice suit you have on, Henry. I'm sure it would be a shame to cover it up with a big, ugly stain.",

        "Jennifer: Oh, no? I'm Barbara Ryan's daughter, remember?",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah, that's right, okay. In that case, I confess. Yes, I was driving Mike back to Katie, but it's because they were fated, Jen. Some couples are just meant to be.",
        "Jennifer: Well, Mike doesn't happen to agree with that.",
        "Henry: Oh really? Well, I knew them when, and I was there when he put a big, beautiful rock on her finger. They were happy, Jennifer. I know you don't want to hear it, but that's true.",
        "Jennifer: Here's what's true, Henry. Mike is with me now. He's moved on. And if you, or anybody else, tries to mess with his head, I will be very, very angry. Understand?",
        "Henry: Totally. But part of the equation that you are missing is that Mike loves Katie. He always has, and he always will. He may not know it yet. But he'll find out soon enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Sometimes giving up is the smart thing to do.",
        "Katie: Mike, you don't mean that. You're just saying that to test me, see if I have what it takes to hang in there, and I'm going to prove to you that I do!",
        "Mike: No, Katie. We have run our course.",
        "Katie: How can you say that? We belong together.",
        "Mike: I don't want to keep fighting. We've been over for months and we're staying that way.",
        "Katie: What about that look on your face when we were talking about making snow angels. How can you explain that away?",
        "Mike: It's a nice moment.",
        "Katie: There was love in your eyes. I saw it. I felt it.",

        "Mike: We do all right.",
        "Katie: That doesn't sound very passionate.",
        "Mike: There's passion, don't worry about it. We could've given into it, matter of fact, we've been dying to give into it. But we wanted to make sure our friendship was right first. And we have. We have friendship and trust and a whole lot more.",

        "Holden: It wasn't like that.",
        "Lily: Yeah, right.",
        "Holden: It wasn't Julia who decided to sit and listen to Craig whine and not have dinner with me.",
        "Lily: Is that why you're here? Because I blew you off on New Year's Eve to spend some time with someone who's very important to me who was hyperventilating into a paper bag? I'm sorry. I shouldn't make light of this. I know that I let you down, and I promise, this will never happen again.",
        "Holden: It'll always happen again! And I'm not angry about one night. I'm angry about you putting somebody or something in front of our family for an entire year.",
