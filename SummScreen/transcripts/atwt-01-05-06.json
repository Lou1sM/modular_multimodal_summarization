        "Nick: Oh, I'm \r\nsorry, was I making too much noise? ",
        "Katie: No, it's \r\nnot that. I always have trouble sleeping when \nMike's not here. ",
        "Nick: You know \r\nyou're safe. I'm not going to let any guy through that door. Especially some \r\nmaniac who tried to blow you to kingdom come. ",
        "Katie: Yeah, \r\nwell, good. Because I keep seeing his face, every time I try to close my eyes. \r\nYou know, as small as this place is, we do have a lot of closet space. \n",
        "Nick: Yeah, I \r\nguess. I know I'm a slob, I admit it. But when you live by yourself, you get \r\nused to throwing stuff wherever you want. ",
        "Katie: Never \r\ntoo late to break a bad habit. ",
        "Nick: Yeah, I \r\nguess. Listen, once Mike's out of the hospital, you know, I'm moving to my own \r\nplace. ",
        "Katie: Oh, no, \r\nI'm sorry. That was rude. I didn't mean to sound like I didn't want you here.\r\n",
        "Nick: I \r\nwouldn't blame you if you didn\u2019t. C'mon, you don't know me from Adam. And nobody \r\nlikes a third wheel. And listen, I do want to apologize for what I did earlier.\r\n",
        "Katie: What, \r\nyou mean saving my life? No apology necessary. ",
        "Nick: No, not \r\nthat. I want to apologize for flirting with you the way I did. It was wrong and \r\nI'm sorry. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "[Knock at the \r\ndoor] ",
        "Lily: Hey, \r\nLuke. It's late. Are the girls okay? ",
        "Luke: Oh yeah, \r\nthey're fine. I couldn't sleep, so I went for a walk. I guess I kind of just \r\nended up here. ",
        "Lily: Come on \r\nin. Come on, go ahead. ",
        "Luke: Is Keith \r\nhere? ",
        "Lily: Yeah, \r\nhe's asleep, I think. ",
        "Luke: You don't \r\nknow? ",
        "Lily: Okay, \r\ncould you -- would you like some hot chocolate or tea or something? ",
        "Luke: No \r\nthanks. I don't really even know why I came. ",
        "Lily: Maybe you \r\nneed to get something off your chest. ",
        "Luke: Like how \r\nI hate the fact that you and Dad are going through with this divorce? I don't \r\neven think that this is what you want. ",
        "Lily: Why not?\r\n",
        "Luke: I think \r\nKeith is forcing you to do this. ",
        "Lily: You \r\ndidn't just happen to stop by tonight. Did your father send you over here?\r\n",
        "Luke: Are you \r\ngoing somewhere? ",
        "Lily: Keith got \r\na job in California. We're leaving tomorrow. ",
        "Luke: For how \r\nlong? ",
        "Lily: I don't \r\nknow. Why would you think that Keith is forcing me into something? I need to \r\nknow if your father told you something. ",
        "Luke: No.\r\n",
        "Lily: You \r\npromise? ",
        "Luke: This \r\ndoesn't have anything to do with Dad. I figured this out on my own. ",
        "Lily: What do \r\nyou think you've figured out? ",
        "Luke: You're \r\nnot marrying Keith because you want to. It's because he made you promise to \r\nmarry him for saving my life. Now, that's true, isn't it? ",
        "Lily: I don't \r\nknow where you came up with an idea like that. ",
        "Luke: Okay, \r\njust tell me something. How many years of marriage does it take to pay for one \r\nslightly-used kidney? ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emily: What are \r\nyou doing here, Hal? ",
        "Hal: Susan \r\ncalled. She's worried about you. ",
        "Emily: So you \r\nhad to run to my rescue. Drop everything and run to Emily\u2019s rescue. ",
        "Hal: She told \r\nme what happened, about Paul not showing up for the wedding. ",
        "Emily: I really \r\ndon't want to talk about this, okay? ",
        "Hal: Look, \r\nEmily, I'm not here to gloat or say \"I told you so.\" Can you just tell me what \r\nhappened? ",
        "Emily: Why? \r\nPaul's gone. ",
        "Hal: If I know, \r\nmaybe I can find him and give him what's coming to him. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------",
        "Paul: Cops. \r\nMeg's bringing cops. [Paul sighs] Okay. Pull it together, Ryan. Come on. You're \r\nnot dead. Yet. ",
        "[Paul groans]\r\n",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emma: Who's \r\nthere? ",
        "Dusty: It's me.\r\n",
        "Emma: Oh, \r\nDusty. You scared me almost to death. ",
        "Dusty: Sorry, I \r\ndidn't want to make noise. I didn't want to wake you. ",
        "Emma: Where's \r\nMeg? I thought you two were going up to \nChicago for \r\nNew Year\u2019s. ",
        "Dusty: Yeah, \r\nwell, that didn't work out. ",
        "Emma: I don't \r\nthink I like the sound of that. Where is she? ",
        "Dusty: At the \r\nhospital. ",
        "Emma: Oh, dear. \r\nSome kind of an emergency? ",
        "Dusty: I don't \r\nknow. I don't know the details. ",
        "Emma: Probably \r\na back-up on the interstate or something. ",
        "Dusty: Yeah.\r\n",
        "Emma: Well, \r\nthat doesn't explain why you're here. And what's this? ",
        "Dusty: It's \r\nsome of Meg's stuff. ",
        "Emma: I hope \r\nthis doesn't mean what I think it does. ",
        "Dusty: We split \r\nup. ",
        "Emma: Yeah. \r\nYeah. It's almost just a question of time, wasn't it? You broke her heart again. \r\nYou broke my baby's heart. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Jennifer: Well, \r\njust the person I wanted to see. ",
        "Meg: I can't \r\ntalk right now, Jen. I've got an emergency I have to deal with. ",
        "Jennifer: A \r\nmedical emergency? ",
        "Meg: It's a \r\nprivate matter. So if you'll excuse me -- ",
        "Jennifer: Look, \r\nI know the truth. Dusty told me. You knew. You knew all along that my baby was \r\nalive. ",
        "Meg: Look, I \r\ncan't do this right now, okay? I'm sorry. I have a patient who really needs me, \r\nall right? ",
        "Jennifer: No, \r\nno, no. I'm not going to let you try and avoid this, because I need an answer to \r\na very important question. ",
        "Meg: I don't \r\nhave any answers, Jen. ",
        "Jennifer: Oh, \r\nyou haven't even heard the question yet. It's very simple, \nMeg. One word. Why? ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ ",
        "Lily: The \r\nkidney came from the hospital, from a donor in \nTexas. \r\nKeith had absolutely nothing to do with it. ",
        "Luke: So, \r\nyou're telling me that you're marrying him because you want to? Because you're \r\nin love with him? I don't buy that for a second. ",
        "Lily: Well, \r\nyou're going to have to start accepting it, I'm sorry. ",
        "Luke: If you're \r\nso in love him, then why were you fooling around with Dad behind Keith\u2019s back?\r\n",
        "Lily: Your \r\nfather and I -- there are a lot of things that I don't expect you to understand.\r\n",
        "Luke: Oh, I \r\nunderstand fine. You and Dad were together the other night in the barn. I saw \r\nyou. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out -- ",
        "Lily: Please, \r\nplease, just stop. ",
        "Luke: If you \r\nmarry Keith, I'm not your son anymore. Because you are not my mother. You are \r\nsomeone else. Someone I don't even know. ",
        "Lily: Don't say \r\nthat. ",
        "Luke: What is \r\nthe point of being alive, when my life is so messed up? I know you're in love \r\nwith Dad, but you won't be with him because of me. ",
        "Lily: Not \r\nbecause of you. ",
        "Luke: Stop \r\ntreating me like a kid. I know the truth. We all know it. You, me, Dad. We all \r\nknow it. And yet, you won't admit it. How can you be so afraid of Keith? How can \r\nyou let him do this to you? To all of us? ",
        "Lily: Wait. \r\nLuke! Luke! ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Katie: Let me \r\njust set the record straight, right off the bat. I am completely, absolutely, \r\nhead over heels in love for your cousin \nMike. So I don't notice other people even when they flirt. ",
        "Nick: That's \r\ngood. I like to hear that. ",
        "Katie: Yeah?\r\n",
        "Nick: But I \r\ngotta tell you the truth. I can't do that. I see beautiful women and I've got to \r\nconnect. It's like breathing in my natural state. ",
        "Katie: So that \r\nexplains why you were also flashing those big brown eyes at Carly. ",
        "Nick: Carly? \r\nThe blonde? Jack Snyder\u2019s wife? ",
        "Katie: Don't \r\npretend you don't know who I'm talking about. ",
        "Nick: But \r\nthat's what I mean. I can't control it. ",
        "Katie: Well, \r\nyou better learn. A word of advice, cousin or not, \nMike will lay you out. Actually, Jack, too, for that matter. \n",
        "Nick: Yeah, \r\nthanks for the safety tip. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Dusty: I think \r\nyou talk to your daughter. ",
        "Emma: Oh, I \r\nintend to. I really thought for a while that you had changed. You fooled me. I \r\nreally felt that on Christmas that the two of you were happy. ",
        "Dusty: Yeah, we \r\nwere. ",
        "Emma: You \r\nremember? You stood right there in that room and you looked me in the face and \r\nsaid to me that you wouldn't hurt her. ",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I \r\nremember I meant it. ",
        "Emma: I see.\r\n",
        "Dusty: I don't \r\nknow what to say, I tried my best. ",
        "Emma: Oh, tried \r\nyour best. Wasn't your fault, huh? I remember. It's never your fault. Nothing's \r\never your fault. ",
        "Dusty: Meg and \r\nI didn't break up for the reasons you think you think we did. ",
        "Emma: Then why \r\ndid you? Tell me. Look, if you're not man enough to face up and tell me the \r\ntruth, don't worry, I'll ask my daughter. Would you please, please just go?\r\n",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------",
        "Meg: Obviously, \r\nDusty didn't waste any time telling you. ",
        "Jennifer: I \r\nguess he thought I had a right to know that someone I trusted betrayed me.\r\n",
        "Meg: I waited \r\ntoo long, I don't deny that. But I finally got the truth out. I got you your \r\nbaby back. ",
        "Jennifer: After \r\nhow many months of hell? You saw what I was going through and you did nothing. \r\nYou let me suffer! And for what? So that you could hold onto Dusty? How selfish \r\nand heartless can you be? ",
        "Meg: I was \r\nselfish. You're right. I did a terrible thing to you. But I couldn't live with \r\nit. I couldn't live with myself. ",
        "Jennifer: Oh, \r\njust save the tears, please. You're a few months too late. ",
        "Meg: I know. \r\nI'm sorry. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nSorry? You turned my life inside out. You let poor \nGwen get attached to a child that wasn't even hers. And all so you \r\ncould spend a few months with a man who doesn't even love you. Was it worth it?\r\n",
        "Meg: Yes, Jen. \r\nIt was. Look, it was wrong what I did to you, Jen. And I have to live with that \r\nfor the rest of my life. And I'm sure there's no explanation that will change \r\nthe way you must feel about me. ",
        "Jennifer: No, \r\nno, I would really love to hear what you could come up with. ",
        "Meg: I love \r\nDusty. I probably always have. And Paul and Emily saw that, and they played it \r\nfor all it was worth. They were relentless. They pounded on me about how you and \r\nDusty would be bonded forever if you got your child back. And I tried so hard \r\nnot to listen to that. I really did. But every time I turned around it seemed \r\nDusty was comforting you, or caring for you, or holding you. And finally, I just \r\ncouldn't take it anymore. I lost it. All I could think about was how I might \r\nlose Dusty. So I faked the blood test. I drew my own blood and substituted it \r\nfor yours. That's why the test showed the baby wasn't yours. ",
        "Jennifer: You \r\nkilled the last chance of hope I had. How could you do that to another woman?\r\n",
        "Meg: I was \r\nscared. I was desperate. But I couldn't live with it anymore. And that's why I \r\nmade the decision to right the wrong. ",
        "Bob: It's a bit \r\nlate, don't you think? If I overheard correctly, you've been a part of this \r\nentire deception. Meg, did you knowingly help Paul and Emily keep Jennifer from \r\nher child? ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------",
        "Hal: Okay, \r\nJonesy. If you hear anything, any news at all, keep me posted. Thanks. Paul \r\nhasn't been back to his apartment. If he skips town, it's a bail violation. So \r\nif you know anything, now's the time. ",
        "Emily: I don\u2019t. \r\nBut I wouldn't be surprised if he was long gone by now. ",
        "Hal: I'll still \r\ncatch him. ",
        "Emily: You know \r\nwhat, maybe it's better if we just let him run. ",
        "Hal: After what \r\nhe did to Jennifer? After what he's just done to you? Don't tell me you still \r\nfeel loyalty toward this guy. ",
        "Emily: I don't \r\nknow what I feel. ",
        "Hal: So what \r\nhappened? Last time I saw you, you were on your way to Luther\u2019s Corners and the \r\nwedding was all set. Then I spoke to your mother and she told me the location \r\nwas changed all of a sudden. Where to? ",
        "Emily: Paul \r\nsaid he was going to pick up the minister and then call me and tell me where to \r\nmeet him. ",
        "Hal: Mm-hmm. \r\nAnd did he? ",
        "Emily: Yeah, he \r\ncalled to tell me that the wedding was cancelled. ",
        "Hal: I can't \r\nbelieve he dumped you over the phone. ",
        "Emily: Well, \r\nmaybe he couldn't face me. ",
        "Hal: Coward.\r\n",
        "Emily: No, \r\nmaybe he was just trying to protect me or something. ",
        "Hal: He wasn't \r\ntrying to protect you. He did it to save his own neck. ",
        "Emily: What do \r\nyou mean? ",
        "Hal: I think \r\nit's pretty obvious. He used you to get him out on bail and then he fled the \r\ncountry. ",
        "Emily: No, I \r\ncan't believe -- I don't know what to believe. I don't know, maybe you're right! \r\nI mean, it was my idea to run off and get married the minute he was released.\r\n",
        "Hal: Where was \r\nhe when he called? ",
        "Emily: I have \r\nno idea. ",
        "Hal: Okay, \r\nwhere were you? ",
        "Emily: I don't \r\nknow. Driving around. Waiting. ",
        "Hal: Was he at \r\nthe apartment before I got there? ",
        "Emily: Yeah.\r\n",
        "Hal: Did he \r\ntake anything with him? A bag, a briefcase, anything like that? ",
        "Emily: I \r\nwould've noticed. Why are you looking at me like that? ",
        "Hal: I just \r\nwant to make sure I'm getting the whole story. Because if you're holding \r\nanything back, anything at all, I need to know now. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Meg: Dr. \r\nHughes, I can explain. ",
        "Bob: There is \r\nno explanation for falsifying a blood test. Especially one that you are not \r\nauthorized to perform. As of this moment, you are suspended from all duties here \r\nat this hospital, pending investigation. ",
        "Meg: Yes, sir.\r\n",
        "Bob: Jennifer, \r\nI'm sorry. I apologize for this hospital, for the actions of Nurse Snyder. But \r\nbelieve me, action will be taken. This could cost you your license. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\nYou're about to lose everything that matters to you. Still feel like it was \r\nworth it? ",
        "Meg: All I can \r\ntell you is, when you love someone so much that the thought of losing him feels \r\nlike the end of the world -- ",
        "Jennifer: What \r\nabout the son that was inside me? The son that you kept from me. The son that I \r\nthought was dead. That was the end of my world, \nMeg. So don't you talk to me about love. ",
        "Emma: Oh, Meg. \r\nMeg, are you all right sweetheart? I just saw Dusty. What happened? ",
        "Jennifer: Yes, \r\nMeg. Go on. Tell your mom what happened. Tell her what you did to my baby.\r\n",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------",
        "Coming up, on \r\n\"As the World Turns\" -- ",
        "Hal: I'll find \r\nhim. And when I do, I'm going make him pay for he did to Jennifer and what he \r\ndid to you. ",
        "Lily: If Luke \r\nfeels that I have traded my happiness for his, God knows what he'll do. \n",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emma: What \r\nabout your baby? Meg, honey, what's happening? ",
        "Meg: Can I talk \r\nto my mama in private, please. Tell her in my own way? ",
        "Emma: Come on, \r\nwe can go in that room there and talk. Excuse us. \nMeg, what's going on? Did you have anything to do with what happened \r\nto her son? ",
        "Meg: Where did \r\nyou see Dusty? And what did he say? ",
        "Emma: He came \r\nby the house, he dropped off your things. And he told me that the two of you had \r\nsplit up. ",
        "Meg: Did he say \r\nwhy? ",
        "Emma: Well, he \r\ndidn't have to. I mean, it's what I feared all along. \nJennifer gets her baby back and he doesn't need you anymore. \n",
        "Meg: No, Mama. \r\nIt's wasn't like that. Not at all. ",
        "Emma: You want \r\nto tell me? You want to tell me what it is? ",
        "Meg: I messed \r\nup. And I don't know what to do. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------",
        "Holden: I'm \r\nglad it's you. I hope you're here to tell me that you're not leaving tomorrow.\r\n",
        "Lily: I'm here \r\nabout Luke. Did he come home? ",
        "Holden: What do \r\nyou mean? He went up to bed hours ago. ",
        "Lily: No, he \r\nmust have snuck out and you didn't here him. He came to the house. We had a huge \r\nargument. ",
        "Holden: About \r\nKeith? ",
        "Lily: Did you \r\ntell him to come? ",
        "Holden: No, of \r\ncourse not. ",
        "Lily: Then why \r\ndid he accuse me of marrying Keith because Keith got him a new kidney? Unless \r\nyou told him something. ",
        "Holden: Lily, I \r\ndidn't say a word. But it's not too tough to figure out that you're being forced \r\ninto this marriage. What else could Keith be holding over you? ",
        "Lily: I can't \r\nhave this argument right now. ",
        "Holden: Lily, \r\nyou need to walk away from Keith. ",
        "Lily: I can\u2019t.\r\n",
        "Holden: Come \r\non, already! ",
        "Lily: I don't \r\nknow, I'm just worried. I'm worried about \nLuke. He was so angry. ",
        "Holden: Do you \r\nblame him? ",
        "Lily: That's \r\nnot the point. He thinks it's his fault. He's blaming himself for everything.\r\n",
        "Holden: Just \r\ntell Keith you're not going to marry him and everything will be okay. \n",
        "Lily: We don't \r\nknow that. ",
        "Holden: Oh, \r\ncome on. Don't tell me you're back to this bizarre notion that if you break your \r\npromise, something's going to happen to \nLuke. Lily, its superstition. You're smart enough to know that. \n",
        "Lily: Don't ask \r\nme to defend this with rational thought. I can\u2019t. All I know, is that I can't \r\ntake chances with my son's life. ",
        "Holden: Yeah, \r\nwell I'm worried about it too. I'm worried about what's going to happen to him \r\nif you marry somebody that you don't love and abandon your family. ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Katie: So how'd \r\nyou become a cop? ",
        "Nick: That's a \r\nstory for another day. ",
        "Katie: Were you \r\nclose to Mike when you guys were growing up? ",
        "Nick: Yeah, we \r\nwere like brothers. ",
        "Katie: What was \r\nhe like when he was little? ",
        "Nick: \r\nEverything I wasn\u2019t. ",
        "Katie: That's \r\ngood, right? ",
        "Nick: Yeah, it \r\nwas good. It was too good. I was like the black sheep and he was my watchdog.\r\n",
        "Katie: So tell \r\nme some stories. ",
        "Nick: Well -- \r\nyou hear that? ",
        "Katie: No. \r\nWhat? ",

        "Mike: Whoa, \r\nwhoa! Nick! ",
        "Katie: Mike?\r\n",
        "Nick: Mike? I \r\ndidn't hurt you, did I? ",
        "Mike: No, man, \r\nI'm fine. ",
        "Katie: What are \r\nyou doing home? ",
        "Mike: Hey, \r\nbaby. I couldn't be away from you any longer. So I talked \nBob into letting me go. ",
        "Katie: And he \r\njust said okay? ",
        "Mike: \r\nEventually. I finally convinced him they were wasting their attention on me. I \r\nmissed you. ",
        "Katie: I missed \r\nyou. ",
        "Nick: Hey, you \r\ntwo. Get a room. ",
        "Mike: What are \r\nyou doing up so late, anyway? ",
        "Katie: Talking \r\nabout you. ",
        "Mike: Me?\r\n",
        "Katie: Yeah, \r\nyour wild and misspent youth. ",
        "Mike: Oh, \r\nbrother. ",
        "Nick: I'm going \r\nto just go get a snack from the kitchen. Anybody want anything? ",
        "Mike: Yeah. How \r\nabout the usual? ",
        "Katie: What's \r\nthe usual? ",
        "Mike: Let's see \r\nif Nick remembers. ",
        "Nick: Tuna, \r\nmartini olives and tarragon with mustard on sourdough? ",
        "Katie: Ew, you \r\nwould never eat that. ",
        "Nick: It was \r\nhis favorite. He used to eat it everyday. ",
        "Katie: No way.\r\n",
        "Mike: My tastes \r\nhave changed. But it does sound pretty good right now. ",
        "Katie: What \r\nother secrets have you kept from me? ",
        "Mike: None.\r\n",
        "Nick: Plenty.\r\n",
        "Katie: Oh! Now \r\nI want to know everything. ",

        "Emily: I don't \r\nblame you for not trusting me. ",
        "Hal: Paul Ryan \r\nhas hurt you enough. So if he jumped bail and you helped him run and you are \r\ncovering for him now, you are in so deep that I will not be able to help you. So \r\nplease, tell me the truth. Do you know where \nPaul is? ",
        "Emily: No. I \r\ndon\u2019t. If I were in on this with him, I would've gone with him. You think I \r\nwanted to come back here and subject myself to the humiliation of you and my \r\nmother that you were right all along? ",
        "Hal: Maybe not.\r\n",
        "Emily: Oh, \r\nplease, I don't want your pity. ",
        "Hal: You won't \r\nget any. Did you leave the apartment after we had the fight? ",
        "Emily: Yeah, \r\nyeah I did. I was very upset, no thanks to you. I needed to get out and clear my \r\nhead. ",
        "Hal: So Paul \r\ncould've gone back to his place after you were gone. ",
        "Emily: Why \r\nwould he do that? ",
        "Hal: To get his \r\npassport, cash from the safe, any number of things. I'm going to go back to that \r\napartment and check it out, see if he left any clues as to where he might have \r\ngone. Could I have the keys, please? Your mother had to go to the hospital on an \r\nemergency. I don't know when she'll be back. I don't like the idea of you being \r\nhere alone. ",
        "Emily: I'm a \r\nbig girl, okay? I could use a little alone time. Just go. ",
        "Hal: Emily, I'm \r\nsorry you had to find out this way. I'm sorry you got hurt. ",
        "Emily: Me, too.\r\n",
        "Hal: But I'll \r\nfind him. And when I do, I'm going to make him pay for what he did to Jennifer. \r\nAnd what he did to you. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emma: I was so \r\nworried all this time that he was going to hurt you. It seems like you're the \r\none who let him down. ",
        "Meg: I let \r\nmyself down, Mama. But I turned it around. I made it right. I mean, doesn't that \r\ncount for anything? ",
        "Emma: Meg, who \r\nare you trying to convince? Now I thought I brought you up to know better.\r\n",
        "Meg: You did. I \r\nfailed you. ",
        "Emma: Don't you \r\nworry about me. You failed yourself. So what are you going to do about it?\r\n",
        "Meg: I don't \r\nknow Mama. What do you expect me to do about it? ",
        "Emma: I expect \r\nyou to just pick up the pieces here and get on with your life. Come on, let's go \r\nhome. We'll sort this out. Come on. ",
        "Meg: No, not \r\nyet. I'm not ready to go anywhere. Not yet. ",

        "Dusty: So \r\nJohnny\u2019s with your mother. He's fine. Did you see Meg? ",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, \r\nI need an aspirin. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Meg: I'll meet \r\nyou back at the farm in a little while. I just need some time to myself. \n",
        "Emma: Meg \r\nSnyder, you're not going to do anything stupid, are you? ",
        "Meg: No, Mama. \r\nDon't worry. I already have. I promise, its fine. I'll see you soon, okay?\r\n",
        "Emma: Okay, \r\nI'll be waiting for you. ",

        "Holden: Luke's \r\nnot in his room. I called all his friends and nobody knows where he is. \n",
        "Lily: I'm so \r\nworried about him. What if he's drinking again? That can't be good for his \r\nkidney. ",
        "Holden: We just \r\nneed to go out and find him. That's what we need to do. ",
        "Lily: He needs \r\nsome time. He needs some time to adjust to the fact that I'm marrying Keith. And \r\nhe won't do that if I'm here, rubbing it in his face. ",
        "Holden: No. You \r\nneed to walk away from Keith. If Luke thinks that he's the one who drove you \r\naway because of this deal that you made, he's gonna be hit with a ton of guilt. \r\nHow do you think he's gonna handle knowing that you traded your life for his?\r\n",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Keith: Lily? \r\nYou down here? [Keith sighs] All right. Who's here? ",

        "Mike: I changed \r\na lot when I hit high school. But by then, you were gone. Easy rider, headed for \r\nwho knows where. ",
        "Nick: Yeah, \r\nit's a long road to nowhere. That's where it got me. ",
        "Mike: Hey, \r\nyou're a cop now. That's a long road from nowhere. ",
        "Katie: I can't \r\nget him to tell me how that happened. ",
        "Mike: Come on, \r\nNick. Don't keep us in suspense. ",
        "Nick: It's no \r\nbig deal. ",
        "Mike: Then why \r\ndon't you want to tell us? ",
        "Nick: All \r\nright. I got into trouble with the cops and they straightened me out. \n",
        "Mike: What kind \r\nof trouble? ",
        "Nick: Had a few \r\ntoo many boilermakers one night. You know, slipped on a patch of oil in the \r\nroad. Totaled my bike and nearly killed myself during the process. The first cop \r\non the scene was a guy named Pat Ruddick. He could've thrown me to the dogs. I \r\ndeserved it. But he challenged instead. Wanted me to change my life rode me hard \r\nuntil I did. He was like that role model I always wish Dad would've been. \n",
        "Mike: At least \r\nyou found one. I'm glad you're here. ",
        "Nick: Thanks, \r\nman. Let me tell you, I'm going to kick some major butt at the OPD. They ain't \r\nseen nothing yet. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Lily: My \r\nmistake was ever letting Luke think for a second that you and I were getting \r\nback together again. ",
        "Holden: No, \r\nyour mistake was letting Keith bully you into marrying him. Luke doesn't believe \r\nthat love has anything to do with your plans. You're never gonna convince him of \r\nthat. ",
        "Lily: We need \r\nto convince him that my plans have nothing to do with him finding a new kidney.\r\n",
        "Holden: No, \r\ndon't drag me into that. If Luke figured out the truth, I'm proud of him. I just \r\nwish you would realize the harm you're doing by not telling him that he's right.\r\n",
        "Lily: Please, I \r\nam begging you, Holden. If Luke feels that I have traded my happiness for his, \r\nGod knows what he'll do. I need your help. Please, I'm begging you, please.\r\n",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------",
        "Keith: All \r\nright, look -- put the knife down. Let's just talk about this. ",
        "Luke: You're a \r\nselfish pig, you know that? You trashed my family. ",
        "Keith: I never \r\nmeant to do that, Luke. ",
        "Luke: Yeah, you \r\ndid. You wanted my mom to yourself. So you get me this kidney and you forced her \r\nmarry you. ",
        "Keith: Is that \r\nwhat she told you? ",
        "Luke: She \r\ndidn't have to tell me. ",
        "Keith: Well, \r\nyou know what? You got it completely wrong. Now, put the knife down! ",
        "Luke: You want \r\nit? Okay, take it. Use it to cut out this kidney you got me, because I don't \r\nwant it any more. Fair trade, okay? You can take the kidney and let my mom go.\r\n",

        "Jennifer: I \r\njust wish I could erase everything she's done. I wish I could erase the months \r\nof fear that Johnny was dead. ",
        "Dusty: Well, \r\nJohnny\u2019s with you now. You're barely going to be able to sleep, let alone worry \r\nabout the past. ",
