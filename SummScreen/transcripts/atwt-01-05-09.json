        "Dusty continues to deal with the aftermath of seeing Johnny after so long and his son not being comfortable with him. Johnny goes to the hospital to be tested, as Katie is going through tests as well since she is going to be a donor for him. Craig can tell that Alison and Katie are keeping something from him since Katie is having some kind of procedure done that they won't tell him about. Alison keeps Craig busy when Dusty, Lucy and Johnny show up. Casey comes to see Maddie at Henry's book signing. They talk about what happened, as Casey apologizes and explains that nothing is going on with him and Alison. He thinks she is better off without him anyway, as Maddie is annoyed that he tells her that. Casey admits to having confused feelings for Alison though, which hurts Maddie. Katie tells Dusty and Lucy she has to let Brad in on her procedure. Lucy isn't comfortable with that, but Dusty convinces her that is only fair. Brad finds out about the procedure and is not on board, but Katie is able to make him understand why she needs to do this. Craig comes back to see Katie, as she sends Brad out to distract him this time. Brad takes Craig out to \u0091lunch', but while out, Brad orders Craig to stay out of Katie's life \u0096 or else. Henry does a reading form his book. Later, he finds out that Maddie and Casey are over \u0096 again and she is heading out of town. Lucy thinks Dusty may have her arrested, as she pleads with Dusty to do what is best for Johnny and take her along wherever he goes. Dusty reluctantly agrees, but when he hears the transplant won't happen for another few days, he wants them to do this in Chicago away from where Craig will find out. Katie wrestles with if keeping Johnny's condition from Craig is fair. Brad thinks that Craig deserves not to know anything though because he created all the pain in his life. Casey tells Alison that Maddie and he are through; she thinks she is the reason and that Casey is too chicken to tell Maddie that he really wants her around so she is determined to tell Maddie herself. Alison finds Maddie and tries to convince her to give Casey another shot, but Maddie tells her that Casey admitted to feelings for her, as Alison is stunned. Alison later confronts Casey about what he told Maddie and is convinced he used her to get rid of Maddie. Casey is afraid to admit the truth. Alison looks like she might want to hear that he is telling the truth about his feelings, but is afraid to hear it too so neither say anything and both leave feeling very awkward with one another. Lucy tells Dusty that Johnny knows all about and has seen photos of Jennifer, which makes him happy. Dusty and Lucy tell Johnny they are all going to Chicago together to make him better. Johnny reluctantly is comfortable with Dusty traveling with them now with Lucy's help. Katie goes to Craig still unsure as to why she feels compelled to have sympathy for him. Craig doesn't know what she is wrestling with to tell him, when Katie blurts out that she knows where Johnny is."

        "Lucy: I'm getting tired. We're going to have to rest for a minute.",
        "Dusty: We should've taken the elevator.",
        "Lucy: You know we can't risk being spotted. Sweetie, Aunt Katie is waiting for you upstairs, and she's going to make you all better. You want to get better, don't you? Okay, well, come on, let's go!",
        "Dusty: I can carry you, if you want.",
        "Johnny: No!",
        "Lucy: Johnny's a big boy. He likes to do things all on his own, huh?",
        "Dusty: Okay, okay.",
        "Lucy: You're going to have to back off a little bit. He doesn't even know you well enough to trust you.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, whose fault is that?",
        "Lucy: You want to go and do this right now?",
        "Dusty: I just want to know, things are going to change.",
        "Lucy: Come on, Johnny. Aunt Katie and Dr. Reed are waiting upstairs.",
        "Dusty: This Dr. Reed -- does he know you, from when you were on staff?",
        "Lucy: He didn't come until after I left. But we have to stay out of sight, so my father doesn't know we're here.",
        "Dusty: Who cares?",
        "Lucy: That's how we got into this nightmare. You didn't care, and neither did he. Your war was tearing everybody apart.",
        "Dusty: Stop making excuses for disappearing with my boy. There's no excuse.",
        "Lucy: Let's go, Johnny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, I think you both are very noble. Going to all this trouble for someone you barely even know.",
        "Alison: Well, I couldn't just stand by when a sick child needs help.",
        "Craig: Of course, there is such a thing as being too generous. You never know when that little bit of bone marrow might come in handy.",
        "Katie: You are so warped.",
        "Craig: No, I'm just humbled to be in the presence of two such beautiful angels of mercy.",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry, your visitor will have to leave. We need to prep you for the procedure.",
        "Craig: What procedure?",
        "Alison: Let's just give them a minute, okay? But only a minute.",
        "Craig: Katie, what's wrong?",
        "Katie: Nothing.",
        "Craig: Nothing? Then, why are you in the hospital for a procedure?",
        "Katie: No, it's nothing, Craig. What?",
        "Craig: It's you.",
        "Katie: What's me?",
        "Craig: You're the donor.",
        "Katie: No! No, of course not.",
        "Craig: Don't lie to me, Katie! You know I'll find out.",
        "Katie: I'm not lying.",
        "Craig: If you're not here to donate your bone marrow, then why the hell are you here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: That's to Felicia? Okay, thank you for coming, Felicia. And thank you for buying.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you have to buy a book first. Oh, fantastic! Would you like some coffee?",
        "Maddie: Isn't that blackmail?",
        "Vienna: Extortion. Oh, have you ever seen him so happy?",
        "Maddie: Only at a poker table when he has the winning hand.",
        "Vienna: I'm so proud of him.",
        "Maddie: Me, too.",
        "Vienna: Casey! It's so lovely that you came to celebrate with us.",
        "Casey: That's not exactly --",
        "Vienna: You know, Maddie is right inside.",
        "Casey: Yes, I see her.",
        "Vienna: Why are you standing out here? Come on. Maddie, look who's here. Your boyfriend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Just tell me the truth.",
        "Katie: Okay. Annual physical. I was overdue, so I thought I'd better take care of it.",
        "Craig: And you expect me to believe that?",
        "Katie: I really don't care.",
        "Craig: Then why lie about it in the first place?",
        "Katie: Because I knew you would take any opportunity to go all \"Big brother\" on me, and I don't want to deal with that right now.",
        "Craig: Well, excuse me for my concern. There's only so much loss I can take.",
        "Katie: Oh, right, I forgot, because everything's about you.",
        "Craig: You know what I mean.",
        "Katie: Right, yeah, I do. It's your world. We all get to visit, though.",
        "Craig: All right, I'll wait outside, and I'll take you home when you're done.",
        "Katie: I have my car.",
        "Craig: Are you sure you'll be able to drive?",
        "Katie: It's a physical, Craig.",
        "Craig: All right. Promise me, though, you'll call me if they find anything wrong.",
        "Katie: They won't. Just go, okay? So I can get this done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You guys can't be here!",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Alison: Your father is in the exam room with Katie. Come on, follow me. Just wait in here.",
        "Dusty: Get him out of here.",
        "Alison: We're trying.",
        "Dusty: Well, try harder! If that guy comes anywhere near my son, I'll kill him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, you can't go yet.",
        "Katie: Craig, I thought you were leaving.",
        "Craig: Evidently not.",
        "Alison: You need to convince him to let me test his blood.",
        "Craig: Whoa -- I thought I was clear about that.",
        "Katie: So did I.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, but that -- it's unacceptable.",
        "Craig: Unacceptable?",
        "Alison: This is a sick kid we're talking about here! You might be a match. You can't refuse!",
        "Craig: I already have.",
        "Katie: Alison's right. You should at least tested.",
        "Craig: You think ganging up on me will work?",
        "Katie: You know, instead of whining about how much you've lost in your life, you might want to try and help someone else for a change.",
        "Craig: As I said, you two are very noble. I don't do noble.",
        "Katie: It's just a test, Craig. A good deed will probably help you balance out your karmic ledger.",
        "Craig: Oh, I didn't realize you were an accountant.",
        "Katie: You know what? Forget it. I'm sure his bone marrow's toxic, anyway.",
        "Craig: All right, all right. I'll let you test, as long as you promise to stop treating me like the enemy.",
        "Katie: I'll consider it. Best I can do.",
        "Craig: I'll take it. All right, vampire. Drill, Baby, drill.",
        "Alison: Well, I don't have my kit with me. So come with me. This way, actually! This way.",
        "Dusty: Looks okay.",
        "Lucy: What if he comes back?",
        "Dusty: Alison just left with him.",
        "Lucy: Shouldn't you go after him and make sure he left the building?",
        "Dusty: I'm not keeping my eyes off Johnny. Especially when he's with you.",
        "Lucy: You really think I'm gonna take him away from the hospital when he's so sick?",
        "Dusty: I think you're capable of anything.",
        "Lucy: Hey, should we go see Aunt Katie, huh? Come on. Hi!",
        "Katie: Hi! Oh, you've gotten so big!",
        "Lucy: Was Dr. Reed here?",
        "Katie: The nurse was here. But Craig was still here, so Alison got rid of her.",
        "Lucy: Okay. Well, I spoke with the doctor, and as soon as he makes sure that you're not at any risk, we're going to go ahead with the mini-transplant.",
        "Katie: Okay. When will that happen?",
        "Lucy: Today, if possible.",
        "Katie: Today? I thought I was just here for tests today.",
        "Lucy: Katie, the longer we wait, the worse Johnny gets.",
        "Katie: Okay. I have to call Brad first.",
        "Lucy: Katie, we can't let anyone else know that we're here.",
        "Katie: He's my husband, Lucy. I have to tell him before I go through with this.",
        "Lucy: It's not a risky procedure.",
        "Katie: You know my medical history, right? I donated part of a liver.",
        "Lucy: To Margo, I know.",
        "Katie: And the doctors told me that any procedure has risks.",
        "Lucy: They were just protecting themselves.",
        "Dusty: Stop pressuring her, would you?",
        "Lucy: You think if I thought there was something to worry about, that I would let her go through with this?",
        "Dusty: That's not the point. She's got to tell her husband what she's doing. She owes him that much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: This is awkward, and --",
        "Maddie: It's totally awkward.",
        "Casey: They're being nice to me, considering.",
        "Maddie: They don't know. They're so happy about this book, I didn't want to bring them down.",
        "Casey: That's nice of you.",
        "Maddie: I also didn't want them to know what a loser I am. Again.",
        "Casey: You're not -- you're not a loser.",
        "Maddie: That's easy for you to say.",
        "Casey: No, you got it all wrong, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Please, I know what I heard outside of that hotel room.",
        "Casey: The sound of nothing happening.",
        "Maddie: Then why don't we not talk about it?",
        "Casey: I just --",
        "Maddie: Thank you for coming. Now go.",
        "Vienna: Oh, come on, Mr. Peacock. You'll get a free doughnut if you buy the book. And besides, you come in here every day to see Henry. Wouldn't you want to get to know him a little better?",
        "Mr. Peacock: I'd rather get to know you better.",
        "Henry: This is a diner, not an escort agency.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry, come on. Peacock, he's one of our best customers.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, he is. Of course, he is. What kind of books do you like, Mr. Peacock?",
        "Mr. Peacock: Non-fiction.",
        "Vienna: Well, Henry's book is based on a true story.",
        "Henry: That's right. It's rooted in fact.",
        "Mr. Peacock: What's it about?",
        "Henry: Well, it's about what might happen if Vienna and I had been hired to search for a little boy named Johnny, who had been kidnapped by his Aunt Lucy to keep him from being a prize in the battle between his biological father Craig and his adoptive father Dusty.",
        "Mr. Peacock: You're right, nobody could make up all that. I think I'll just pay for the doughnut.",
        "Henry: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Mr. Peacock, look, if you stay for the reading, the doughnut is on the house, whether you buy the book or not. What do you say? Okay.",
        "Vienna: Great.",
        "Henry: I think we should start, Liebchen.",
        "Vienna: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, please find a seat, because Henry is about to start his reading.",
        "Henry: I think we should do it together.",
        "Vienna: Do what?",
        "Henry: We should do the reading together.",
        "Vienna: No, but you're the author.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know. But you know, that love scene in the first chapter, that's pretty close to the truth, isn't it?",
        "Vienna: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: But I'm not an actress.",
        "Henry: Sweetie, you just be yourself, okay? It's sure to satisfy Mr. Peacock. Ladies and gentlemen, a little bit of a surprise here. Vienna, who is my partner in the book and also my love in actual life, is going to join me in the reading. If this doesn't get you to buy the damn book, nothing will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Is there something wrong with the elevators?",
        "Alison: Oh, they're overcrowded. They stop at every floor. This is much faster. Oh, damn!",
        "Craig: What now?",
        "Alison: I think I left my blood kit over at Java.",
        "Craig: I'm sure there's something in a hospital we can use.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but they are really strict about their needles here. I could get in a lot of trouble if they found out I lost it. Do you think we could go over to Java and do the test there?",
        "Craig: In a coffee shop?",
        "Alison: That's how simple it is.",
        "Craig: Let's do this another time.",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no! You'll change your mind.",
        "Craig: I promise I won't.",
        "Alison: Please! It'll only take five minutes.",
        "Craig: I'm going to go check on Katie.",
        "Alison: Hey you know, Katie will be upset if she finds out you went back on your word. She really cares about this.",
        "Craig: And I really care about Katie, so why don't you tell me what's wrong?",
        "Alison: Nothing.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. I'm not stupid. I can tell the two of you are trying to keep something from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay, what are you doing here?",
        "Lucy: She's here helping me.",
        "Brad: That's nice. Who are you?",
        "Katie: This is Lucy Montgomery.",
        "Brad: Craig's daughter? The kidnapper?",
        "Dusty: Lucy brought Johnny back. He's having medical problems, but he's here to get fixed up. Right, buddy?",
        "Katie: This is your Uncle Brad.",
        "Brad: Hey, Bud. Hey, it's -- it's great to meet you.",
        "Katie: It's kind of an urgent situation. He needs a bone marrow transplant.",
        "Brad: I thought that was Alison's friend's kid.",
        "Lucy: We were hoping to find a donor without tipping off my father that we're here.",
        "Brad: Well, did you?",
        "Lucy: We think so.",
        "Brad: No way!",
        "Katie: Brad --",
        "Brad: No way!",
        "Katie: Listen --",
        "Lucy: We should -- maybe we should go wait in the other room, huh? Come on.",
        "Brad: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Katie: I have to do this, he's my nephew. He could die without this procedure.",
        "Brad: Well, can't they find someone else to help him? I think -- you know, I think you've already done your bit for medical science. I think one transplant in one lifetime is enough.",
        "Katie: I have to do this, Brad.",
        "Brad: No, you don't.",
        "Lucy: We're just going to have to wait here for the doctor. Hey, you want to read a book to me while we're waiting?",
        "Dusty: He can read?",
        "Lucy: Of course he can read.",
        "Johnny: I'm tired.",
        "Dusty: Want me to read to you? Huh? I'll do it. Look at all these great bunny rabbits. There's some great pictures in here. Looks at all these bunnies heading off for a picnic. I hope they're not going to the beach. I hate picnics at the beach. I don't know like it when sand gets in my peanut butter, know what I mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Why the hell would you risk your life for Craig?",
        "Katie: I'm not doing this for Craig. I'm doing it for Johnny. And I'm not risking my life.",
        "Brad: So are you going to tell me there's no chance at all that something can go wrong? You know, that you could have a bad reaction or an infection or something?",
        "Katie: Well, no. No procedure is 100% guaranteed --",
        "Brad: Then how can you expect me to let you go through with this?",
        "Katie: Because I can't just sit by and watch him waste away.",
        "Brad: Well, they'll find another donor.",
        "Katie: No, Alison has tested dozens of people. I'm the only match.",
        "Brad: So find more.",
        "Katie: He could die before she finds someone else.",
        "Brad: Oh, here it comes.",
        "Katie: No, listen to me. How would you feel if someone refused to help Liberty because they didn't like you?",
        "Brad: Well, that wouldn't happen. Everybody loves me.",
        "Katie: The point is, then it becomes about you. And it's not. Just like this isn't about Craig. This is about me helping that sick little boy so he doesn't die.",
        "Brad: I want the doctor to promise me that's nothing's going to happen to you, that you're going to be okay.",
        "Katie: Well, he'll tell you that the risks are minimal.",
        "Brad: Katie --",
        "Katie: I have to do this.",
        "Brad: If anything happens to you --",
        "Katie: It won't. It won't, okay? You're not going to get rid of me that easily.",
        "Lucy: Dr. Reed is ready to start you on your meds. Have you made up your minds?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Brad's in.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but I'm not thrilled about it.",
        "Lucy: I don't blame you. But thank you so much. And I don't have to remind you that no one can know about this.",
        "Katie: He knows.",
        "Alison: Craig, wait, please! You can't go in there!",
        "Lucy: Oh, God, he's back!",
        "Katie: You've gotta -- you gotta get rid of him!",
        "Brad: Me?",
        "Katie: Get him out of the hospital now!",
        "Brad: What the hell am I gonna do? How am I gonna do that?",
        "Craig: I want to see Katie.",
        "Brad: No can do, Bro.",
        "Craig: I'm not your bro, and I want to know what's wrong with my sister.",
        "Brad: She's my wife, do I look like something's wrong with her?",
        "Craig: Frankly, you never look like you have anything going on in your head.",
        "Brad: That's a good one, Craigster! But you know, I am not as dumb as I look.",
        "Craig: I'll have to take your word on that.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, you and me -- you know -- you know what our problem is?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm, you won't get out of my way.",
        "Brad: We need to spend more time together.",
        "Craig: That's the last thing we need.",
        "Brad: Okay, how about we just go to lunch? You know, a nice friendly lunch, just the two of us?",
        "Craig: Now I know Katie's not just here for a routine physical.",
        "Brad: Yes, you are right. She is here having a little procedure.",
        "Craig: Okay. For what?",
        "Brad: I don't know, but it's -- you know, it's kinda like -- it's a woman thing.",
        "Craig: And she didn't tell you what it was?",
        "Brad: Yes, she told me, but she doesn't want me to tell you. So how about lunch? You know, at Al's diner, the special is Vienna's famous barbeque rib soup.",
        "Craig: Sounds like something they'd serve in jail. Thanks, I'll pass.",
        "Brad: You won't do it for Katie?",
        "Craig: Why would she care if we have lunch?",
        "Brad: Look, I don't know, it was her idea. Maybe she thinks that we can patch things up if you and I get to know each other.",
        "Craig: Honestly? I've gotten the impression she wants nothing to do with me at all.",
        "Brad: You know how ladies -- you know, they don't know what they want until we tell them. You coming?",
        "Craig: Well, how can I argue with such impeccable logic?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: They're gone.",
        "Katie: Brad got him out?",
        "Alison: He's taking Craig to lunch.",
        "Katie: Oh, that can't end well.",
        "Lucy: We have to get started.",
        "Katie: Okay. Let me just ask you one more time, Lucy. Are you sure this is fair?",
        "Lucy: To whom?",
        "Katie: To Craig. He doesn't even know that his son is in serious danger.",
        "Lucy: That's the idea.",
        "Katie: Look -- are you sure that's how you want it?",
        "Lucy: I've never been more sure of anything in my life.",

        "Henry: \"He loved Vienna so much that he even found her sometimes incomprehensible accent charming. He genuinely wanted to hear what she had to say, but looking at her frequently proved too distracting. And, in this particular instance, her practically wing across his lap didn't help. She turned around, resting the edge of her equally perfectly proportioned and symmetrical rear end against his thighs. That didn't help much either.\"",
