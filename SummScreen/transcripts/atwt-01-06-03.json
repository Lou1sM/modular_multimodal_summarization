        "Katie: Just two. I have the best book on how to survive the Australian \r\noutback. It was on sale. Can you believe that?",
        "Simon: Listen, Katie, about this trip, we've gotta talk --",
        "Katie: And I found the perfect thing for -- Australia in January. I \r\nknow, you're speechless.",

        "Aaron: Right. I mean, I don't have a lot of photographs of stuff, you \r\nknow, us being together, but I have a lot of memories. And I keep carrying them \r\naround in my head, trying to figure out how to get 'em in hers. So then I \r\nthought, \"why not make a list?\"",

Apparently, the father and the son \r\nboth had hives, so the E.R. doctor took blood from both of them to run allergy \r\ntests, and when he turned his back, someone stole Mr. Chronister's infant son.",
