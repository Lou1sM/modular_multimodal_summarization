        "Alison: Case? Casey, come on. I can't be late for work today. I'm working with Dr. Kantor. You know -- the most sexist, nurse-hating doctor at Memorial? Yeah, he lives to suspend people, and if he can make you feel worthless while doing it, he will. Whoa.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Casey: Sorry. I didn't know you were here. I was working out, and then I jumped in the shower. I guess the speakers were too loud.",
        "Alison: I -- do -- do you need me to help dry your back?",
        "Casey: Oh, well, yeah, you don't have to stop there, you know?",
        "Alison: Just missed a few spots there. [Laughter] So, what were you doing, working out in the middle of the day?",
        "Casey: Well, I just -- I just want to look good for the wedding, you know, and, of course, the wedding night, hmm?",
        "Alison: I don't think you'll have a problem with that at all.",
        "Casey: Oh, how long do we have to wait till we get married? Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh! Oh, they're beautiful. Oh. No card. Henry Coleman, you devil, you. Oh.",
        "Mick: They're beautiful, aren't they?",
        "Barbara: These are from you?",
        "Mick: Do you like them?",
        "Barbara: I don't want you giving me gifts. Would you please take them back?",
        "Mick: What am I gonna do with two dozen roses?",
        "Barbara: Okay, fine. I will give them to housekeeping. Now, good-bye, please.",
        "Mick: You used to love roses, especially in the wintertime, when they're so rare and so expensive.",
        "Barbara: I do love roses, especially, but, you, I find profoundly disturbing.",
        "Mick: A few days ago, you were my number one fan.",
        "Barbara: I am a fan of your work, and you promised that the treatments would make me feel younger and more beautiful, but the fact that you may be James Stenbeck --",
        "Mick: You know who I am, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I know who you claim to be.",
        "Mick: You still don't believe me?",
        "Barbara: I have my doubts. Enough that I'm losing sleep.",
        "Mick: I couldn't tell. Far as I'm concerned, you've never looked lovelier.",
        "Barbara: I don't want to hear this.",
        "Mick: You wouldn't have agreed to the treatments if you didn't want to hear it. You protest too much, my dear. I know you. Besides, we don't have time for pretense. We have work to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, you gonna bring lambie down the hill? You gonna hold on tight to her, even though you can hardly move your arms in this thing? Look at you.",
        "Emily: I love sledding. If you give me five minutes, I'll go get my boots and I'll go with you guys.",
        "Paul: Oh, don't bother. I'm just dropping her off with Ethan and Natalie.",
        "Emily: So?",
        "Paul: So -- you're not invited.",
        "Emily: How long are gonna punish me for something I didn't do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Is this some kind of a joke?",
        "Meg: Oh, not at all. I'm fighting for my life here.",
        "Damian: You're sick, Meg.",
        "Meg: No, I'm not sick, and I'm not crazy, and we both know that. You know, I -- I told everybody what you did, that you set me up. Nobody believed me. Not -- not even my own brother, and he despises you.",
        "Damian: It's for your own good.",
        "Meg: It's for yours, Damian, just like everything else you do. Yeah, you're good. You're really good. You even had me doubting my own sanity there for a while. You set the perfect trap. The more I fought, the more frustrated I got, because nobody believed that I was telling the truth. And the more upset I got, the more crazier I looked, which drove me insane.",
        "Damian: You're rambling, Meg. You've suffered a breakdown, for which I'm deeply sorry.",
        "Meg: Oh, you will be. I am doing whatever the doctors tell me to do, whatever it takes to get out of here. And when I do, you're as good as dead, Damian. [Whispering] I'm gonna kill you. And now that everybody thinks I'm certifiable -- thanks to you -- I'm gonna get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Grimaldi, would you like your husband to come in with you for the pregnancy test?",
        "Lily: He's not --",
        "Holden: Um, could we, uh -- could we have a moment, please? Are you?",
        "Lily: I don't know. Maybe. I thought I had the flu, but if you add up all the symptoms, I could be.",
        "Holden: I -- I don't know what to say.",
        "Lily: Well, that makes us even, because I don't know what to feel. This wasn't planned. I -- Damian and I weren't trying. It all seems so unreal.",
        "Holden: Well, it'll be real soon enough.",
        "Lily: Holden.",
        "Holden: Lily, uh, good luck to both of you. Um, why isn't Damian here?",
        "Lily: It's just a blood test.",
        "Holden: You haven't told him, have you?",
        "Lily: No, I haven't told Damian yet.",
        "Holden: Lily, is this -- is this what you really want? A new baby, Damian's child?",
        "Lily: I -- I can't discuss this with you. I haven't told Damian yet. It wouldn't be fair.",
        "Holden: Damian should be here.",
        "Lily: I don't want him here, not yet. It's -- it's too overwhelming.",
        "Holden: You know, I have to tell you, I just really hate the idea. But whatever happens, I'm sure that you'll handle it. You're a great mom.",
        "Lily: I wasn't sure you still felt that way. I mean, you're fighting me for custody of the children.",
        "Holden: No, I never had a problem with you as a parent. I always trusted you with our kids' lives. That hasn't changed.",
        "Lily: Thank you for saying that. Listen, I'm sorry that I got so defensive when you wanted to spend more time with the kids.",
        "Holden: Well, under the circumstances, I probably would have reacted the same way.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I just -- I was just, you know, freaking out. And -- and now that Meg is getting the help that she needs, maybe we can work something out that would be good for both of us, and we wouldn't have to get the courts involved. I never felt right about that.",
        "Holden: Okay. I'm certainly willing to try.",
        "Nurse: Are you ready, Mrs. Grimaldi?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Wilson: How are you two getting along?",
        "Meg: Well, Doctor, I don't know how to thank you for giving me the chance to make amends. And, Damian, thank you for accepting my apology. Your forgiveness makes me feel like I'm on the road to recovery.",
        "Dr. Wilson: It's very gratifying when the therapeutic process works the way it's supposed to.",
        "Damian: Really? Is that what's happening here, Doctor? Is she really getting better?",
        "Dr. Wilson: Well, you don't need a medical degree to see that. Good work, Meg.",
        "Meg: Thank you so much, Damian. You have no idea how much your visit helped me today. See you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm not punishing you. What are you --?",
        "Emily: No, you just don't want me going with you?",
        "Paul: It's not that. Look, I'm not staying, either. I'm just dropping her off, and then I'm gonna go see Meg at Deerbrook.",
        "Emily: Ah, that's just great. Can -- can you not understand it hurts me that you're on her side and not mine? Even though she's the one who took your daughter in the middle of a storm without so much as a jacket to keep her warm?",
        "Paul: Well, maybe she wouldn't have had to do that if you hadn't called the cops.",
        "Emily: I didn't call the cops. How many times do I have to tell you that? Why can't you believe me?",
        "Paul: Well, I'm trying to.",
        "Emily: Well, try harder. You know, if you could just -- if you'd just listen to me, I think I might know who -- who double-crossed you, if you could just listen to what I have to say --",
        "Paul: Look, I don't mean to cut you off.",
        "Emily: It's important, Paul.",
        "Paul: Well, that's fine, but I don't really have the time.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, its five minutes of your time.",
        "Paul: I have to get to Meg before visiting hours are over. We'll talk about this later.",
        "Emily: Oh, you bet we will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: It's Paul. I don't remember taking this.",
        "Mick: I know. I did.",
        "Barbara: You did? How do I know this wasn't photoshopped?",
        "Mick: This was always one of my favorites.",
        "Barbara: You'd think, looking at this, that we were just a happy, normal family. I don't remember posing for this picture.",
        "Mick: You didn't always hate me. I know it's unsettling to remember the good times.",
        "Barbara: There were no good times.",
        "Mick: Yes, there were. Your memory has been tainted over time.",
        "Barbara: By association with you.",
        "Mick: You're right. I coerced you into taking that picture. I've carried it close over the years as a reminder of what could be.",
        "Barbara: What are you talking about?",
        "Mick: We have a second chance, Barbara. There's no reason that we can't have a real family this time around.",
        "Barbara: Except for the fact that we never were a real family and Paul hates you.",
        "Mick: Me? You mean his father?",
        "Barbara: Whoever you are. And looking at a few photos is not gonna change his opinion of James.",
        "Mick: I didn't say it won't take work.",
        "Barbara: I can't believe I'm hearing this.",
        "Mick: Go with me on this, please. Let me arrange a dinner so that we can all get to know each other better -- Paul and Eliza, you and me.",
        "Barbara: And Emily?",
        "Mick: Depends on how well she and Paul are getting along. Things aren't going too well at Fairwinds, when last I checked.",
        "Barbara: You want to have a family dinner?",
        "Mick: Yes.",
        "Barbara: When?",
        "Mick: Tonight, if possible.",
        "Barbara: And so then you're gonna tell Paul who you claim to be?",
        "Mick: Once I can prove myself to him, get him to trust me again.",
        "Barbara: Again?",
        "Mick: It will happen, Barbara. And for once, I've got time on my side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: It's one thing to say you'll wait until -- to have sex until the wedding. It's another thing to live it.",
        "Casey: You know, a little torture never hurt anyone.",
        "Alison: Please, just put your shirt back on.",
        "Casey: Anticipation is a good thing, right?",
        "Alison: So I've heard.",
        "Casey: What -- what -- what is all this?",
        "Alison: We only have six weeks to pull our wedding together.",
        "Casey: And this is --",
        "Alison: This is all the stuff we have to get done before then.",
        "Casey: Oh, this looks like a lot.",
        "Alison: Yeah, it is, but we don't have to make any decisions, you know, until after we work our shift, okay?",
        "Casey: I mean -- I mean, I don't care what the cake looks like. Can't we just -- you know, as long as it tastes good.",
        "Alison: Well, that's why we have to set up a tasting.",
        "Casey: We can't just get chocolate and call it a day?",
        "Alison: No, we can't. Now look at some of these. Tell me what you think.",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. I think it -- it looks delicious. Mmm.",
        "Alison: Oh. No, no, no, no, no. We have to get to work. I'm working with Dr. Kantor today.",
        "Casey: Who?",
        "Alison: I'll explain on the way. Come on. We have to go.",
        "Casey: Yes, yes. Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: If -- if you want, I'll wait with you.",
        "Lily: Thanks, but that's too weird, even for us.",
        "Holden: Good luck, whatever that means to you.",
        "Lily: He's my ex-husband, okay? Let's just get this over with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Emily: We need to talk.",
        "Barbara: Oh.",
        "Emily: Sorry. Am I interrupting something?",
        "Barbara: As a matter of fact --",
        "Mick: Barbara and I were just discussing the next phase of her treatments. It's going beautifully, don't you think?",
        "Emily: Actually, you look a little flushed. Are you okay?",
        "Mick: On the contrary, she's radiant.",
        "Barbara: I don't think we need to discuss my radiance.",
        "Mick: Well, I'm treating Emily, as well. Sometimes it's easier to notice the difference in someone else besides yourself. You're both glowing.",
        "Emily: What's in those injections, anyway -- plutonium? [Laughter]",
        "Mick: You can't tell me you haven't noticed a change within yourself, Emily -- you haven't felt the difference.",
        "Emily: Nice flowers, Babs.",
        "Barbara: Did you have something in mind to discuss, Emily?",
        "Emily: Yeah, actually, family business.",
        "Mick: Well, I need to get back to the lab, anyway.",
        "Barbara: Thank you for stopping by -- [Whispering] And for the flowers.",
        "Mick: You, uh, give Paul my best.",
        "Emily: What the hell is going on between you two?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm, uh, ready to start early if you are, Dr. Kantor.",
        "Dr. Kantor: Early?",
        "Alison: It's five of. I just thought, since we're both here --",
        "Dr. Kantor: Your shift hasn't even begun yet, and already, you've managed to destroy a patient's confidence in my judgment.",
        "Alison: Excuse me?",
        "Dr. Kantor: The hernia repair in 412.",
        "Alison: Oh, you mean Mr. Tobias? No, he was just anxious about going home so soon after surgery, so I -- I showed him how to get up and down without putting too much strain on his incision and -- and just said that he could call, you know, if he felt anxious.",
        "Dr. Kantor: In other words, I sent him home too soon.",
        "Alison: No, that's not what I meant. He, um, he lives alone. He just -- he needed a little reassurance. And he said that his father had the same surgery years ago, so --",
        "Dr. Kantor: Did it occur to him that we might have learned a few things since the 1950s?",
        "Alison: I don't know what to say, Sir.",
        "Dr. Kantor: You're a nurse! Don't say anything!",
        "Alison: But if a patient asks --",
        "Dr. Kantor: End of discussion, Ms. Stewart! You're not the man's surgeon. You're just a silly little girl pretending to know something about medicine, and I won't stand for it! Is that clear?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, I made you a card.",
        "Meg: Oh, it's beautiful.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Eliza's something, else, huh?",
        "Meg: Uh-huh.",
        "Paul: She needs a bigger canvas, though. The kitchen table is --",
        "Meg: Yeah, she gets that from me. Sorry. Thank you so much, Paul.",
        "Paul: You seem okay, you know, for being locked up and all.",
        "Meg: Oh, it won't be for long.",
        "Paul: And why is that?",
        "Meg: Because I'm taking your advice. I'm doing exactly what the doctors tell me to do, and they're eating it up. They think they're geniuses, that I'm a testament to the power of the mood-altering pharmaceuticals.",
        "Paul: I thought you weren't gonna take them.",
        "Meg: I'm not. I'm fine. I don't need them. I'm doing exactly what you said -- I'm playing the game. And before you know it, I'll be out of here, and Damian will be hiding under his bed.",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",
        "Meg: I invited him here today -- with my doctor's blessing -- to ask for his forgiveness.",
        "Paul: But you didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Meg: Well, I have to do something to entertain myself. You can only knit so many scarves.",
        "Paul: So, what happened?",
        "Meg: Well, I was very apologetic. And then, when Dr. Wilson was paged, he felt very comfortable leaving us alone, and that's when the fun began.",
        "Paul: What do you mean?",
        "Meg: I went medieval on him.",
        "Paul: Uh, oh, good for you.",
        "Meg: Yeah, Damian is gonna pay for what he did to me -- with his life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Hey.",
        "Lily: Damian, what are you doing here?",
        "Damian: Well, I -- I called Luciano at the house. He told me you weren't feeling well. Cara, what is it? What's wrong?",
        "Lily: Nothing. I -- I'm fine. I thought I caught a bug, so I figured I should come and get some antibiotics.",
        "Damian: You don't have a fever.",
        "Lily: That's the way I used to check temperatures when the kids were little. They were scared of the thermometers, so I'd do anything I could to avoid it.",
        "Damian: Cara, what's wrong?",
        "Lily: I think I might be pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know what? I -- I think we should pass on the, uh, trip to Kentucky.",
        "Molly: What about Meg?",
        "Holden: Meg is sick. She admitted to making up all those stories. She needs professional help, and she's getting it -- end of story.",
        "Molly: And what about the possibility that Meg is telling the truth about Damian, but she was just upset because nobody believed her? My reporter instincts are telling me there's more going on here.",
        "Holden: You know what? This -- this has become about me getting back at Damian, and I don't want to do that. It's a waste of time. Lily and I are over. And if I didn't know that before, I sure as hell do now.",
        "Molly: What you need is a little forgetting.",
        "Holden: Wow. I don't feel like dancing.",
        "Molly: Come on. I do, so humor me, please? Yes!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I know this comes as a shock. I'm -- I'm in a daze myself. I mean, it's almost too much to -- but, when the test results come back, which should be any minute -- Damian, please say something.",
        "Damian: Cara, this is the -- the most wonderful news I've ever heard. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Oh!",
        "Molly: You don't have to stop.",
        "Holden: You know what? This is -- this is not how I want it to happen, not on a day like this.",
        "Molly: Are you saying that kiss was all about Lily, Damian, and their theoretical kid?",
        "Holden: Uh, maybe, probably, when you consider the timing of it.",
        "Molly: Yeah. Okay, well, I have a question for you. And I need you to be honest with me, which, of course, you will be because that's who you are. You don't lie.",
        "Holden: Go ahead. Ask.",
        "Molly: Does Lily's being pregnant or not -- does that change how you feel about me?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Molly: Good. Because we've been here before, and I think I know how you -- what I mean to say is, it feels to me like you're ready to put it in gear, but for some reason, you're keeping on the parking brake, because you just can't accept that Lily and Damian are built to last, and so you're waiting for a recall.",
        "Holden: You really know your car lingo.",
        "Molly: I've kissed a lot of clunkers. Foreign and domestic. Holden -- that kiss -- that wasn't out of desperation. That was you accepting that it's over with Lily and that maybe there's somewhere there's something else out there for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: It's okay. This is my husband. You can say anything in front him.",
        "Nurse: It's negative.",
        "Lily: I'm not pregnant?",
        "Nurse: No, I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You can't go around killing people, not -- not even Damian Grimaldi.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, the world would be a lot better off without him.",
        "Paul: Well, I totally agree. But you're Eliza's mom. She needs you. If you do something to Damian, you're gonna wind up in here for the rest of your life. You don't want that. Trust me.",
        "Meg: Look, I know what I'm doing. It'll be okay. I promise.",
        "Paul: Can you promise me this? Can you promise me that you won't do anything do Damian without talking to me first? Can you promise me that, please? For Eliza's sake?",
        "Meg: All right. You know, you've been so good to me ever since this whole thing started.",
        "Paul: Well, what else am I gonna do?",
        "Meg: I hope it hasn't caused too many problems with Emily, at least nothing permanent.",
        "Paul: Well, it's not great.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: Don't be sorry. I broke it. I'm the one who broke it -- I'm the one who should fix it. I can fix it.",
        "Meg: Well, then, do it. One of us should be happy.",
        "Paul: Remember, you promised me you wouldn't do anything to Damian without talking to me first -- remember that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You have an agenda, and I would like to know what it is.",
        "Barbara: You've always been so paranoid, Emily.",
        "Emily: Paul thinks that I'm the one who ratted Meg out to the police.",
        "Barbara: Were you?",
        "Emily: No. No, but you would know that, because you're the one who made the call.",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't be ridiculous.",
        "Emily: No, it has your name written all over it. You knew Meg was in our wine cellar. One phone call to the police and, bam, she's out of the picture, Paul gets Eliza, and I have to take the blame. You won the trifecta, didn't you?",
        "Barbara: I am so sorry that you and my son are having martial problems.",
        "Emily: You know, it wouldn't be the first time you set me up.",
        "Barbara: Be that as it may, I did not turn Meg in.",
        "Emily: Well, then, who did? Because it sure as hell wasn't me.",
        "Barbara: I have no clue.",
        "Emily: You know, Barbara, you don't have to say a thing. I'm on to you. Consider yourself warned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Kantor: Do you mind?",
        "Mick: Yeah, I just overheard your conversation with Alison Stewart. You really enjoy cracking that whip, don't you?",
        "Dr. Kantor: Do I know you?",
        "Mick: Uh-uh. You know, the funny thing about cracking a whip is, sometimes, it snaps back. It whips you right there in the back of the head -- whiplash.",
        "Dr. Kantor: Keep your hands off of me.",
        "Mick: I saw a man whipped in Thailand once. All he did was look at a woman the wrong way. And it was really interesting because after the tenth lash, he couldn't even scream anymore.",
        "Dr. Kantor: Are you threatening me?",
        "Mick: Absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Lily, this is a sign. We're meant to have a child together.",
        "Lily: No, Damian, I don't think it's a sign. I -- I've just been stressed out lately. I mean, between Meg and taking care of Noah, I just -- I've just let myself get run down.",
        "Damian: Exactly. This is a wake-up call, Lily. Don't you see? I mean, you need to take care of yourself, and you can't do it here with everything that's going on. We need to go on a trip, a honeymoon. I mean, we've never had one.",
        "Lily: I don't think now is the right time.",
        "Damian: Why not? We could go someplace far away, where you could rest and we can work on making a little baby.",

        "Paul: You're drinking tea?",
        "Barbara: I am. Would you like some?",
        "Paul: Not unless there's booze in it.",
        "Barbara: What's wrong?",
        "Paul: I just saw Meg.",
        "Barbara: How is she?",
        "Paul: Ah, ah.",
        "Barbara: Does that mean she's worse?",
        "Paul: Um, you know what? I just wish she would come home and be a mom to Eliza. And I wish Emily and I were getting along. A few weeks ago, everything was great. Now it's all turned to hell.",
        "Barbara: Honey, maybe you should just cut your losses.",
        "Paul: Somehow, I knew you were gonna say that.",
        "Barbara: Paul --",
        "Paul: It's okay. You know what? Never mind. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Let's just eat. I'm starving. What's this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, God. You know, it's not normal to have so many nosebleeds, Mick. You need to see a specialist, okay? Something could be seriously wrong.",
        "Mick: It's not.",
        "Alison: You're a scientist, not an M.D. Okay, you said it's usually brought on by stress. What brought this time?",
        "Mick: I have no idea.",
        "Alison: Here. I can make an appointment for you if you want -- not a big deal.",
        "Mick: I'm fine.",
        "Alison: Are you gonna say that every time this happens?",
        "Mick: Until you start believing me, yes.",
        "Alison: You're impossible.",
        "Mick: Well, thank you for being my angel of mercy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know what? Maybe, uh, maybe we shouldn't. You know how one dance just leads to another.",
        "Molly: No, I love dancing.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, so do I, but you know, maybe this -- maybe this isn't so fair to you. Maybe you were right about what you said about me and Lily.",
        "Molly: You know what, Holden? I've known you since I was 14 years old. And I knew exactly what I was getting into when I got in your car and let you drive me back to Oakdale. Yes, we're dragging around a lot of baggage, and most of it has Lily's monogram on it.",
        "Holden: And that doesn't scare you off?",
        "Molly: The only thing that scares me right now is never finding out if what I'm feeling -- if what I think we're both feeling -- could go somewhere. Somewhere really, really good. I want it. I've never stopped wanting it. And I think we both really deserve it.",
        "Holden: Maybe you're right.",
        "Molly: Oh, yes. So, can we please stop talking and just dance?",
        "Holden: You know what? I got a better idea. Let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: My children need to see their father, their grandmothers, their cousins. And I have work. I mean, I've neglected it for far too long. My life is here, Damian.",
        "Damian: A new baby will complete that life.",
        "Lily: I know that you want more children.",
        "Damian: Our children, Lily. We'll work out the scheduling.",
        "Lily: That's not the point. I'm not sure that I'm ready.",
        "Damian: Ready for what -- to go away or to have another child with me?",
        "Lily: Both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Kantor: Ms. Stewart?",
        "Alison: Yes, Sir?",
        "Dr. Kantor: I was very rude to you before. I apologize. I hope you'll forgive me.",
        "Alison: Um, sure. Yeah, absolutely. That means a lot to me, Dr. Kantor. Thank you.",
        "Dr. Kantor: You're welcome. Now keep your psycho boyfriend away from me.",
        "Casey: Is that my gorgeous fianc\u00e9e?",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Casey: Mm. I skipped my break so I could get off early and go home and work on the wedding stuff. What?",
        "Alison: Did you have a run-in with Dr. Kantor?",
        "Casey: I -- I don't think so. What's he look like? 'Cause I did hit the elevator close button when this guy was like, \"Oh, no, hold it!\"",
        "Alison: No, um, never mind. Uh, I'll see you later, okay?",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Alison: I have an errand. It was you, wasn't it?",
        "Mick: What are you doing all the way out here, Alison? Shouldn't you be working?",
        "Alison: That's why I came here. Somebody put the fear of God in Dr. Kantor. He said it was my psycho boyfriend.",
        "Mick: He said that?",
        "Alison: Don't look so proud of yourself. It was you, wasn't it?",
        "Mick: Guilty.",
        "Alison: What were you thinking? Dr. Kantor is a jerk to every woman on the staff. Now he's gonna have it out for me.",
        "Mick: I doubt it.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. What did you say to him?",
        "Mick: Relax. It's not like I clocked the guy. I was friendly.",
        "Alison: Really? Well, it didn't sound that way to me.",
        "Mick: Well, I was. It's not my fault if he took it the wrong way.",
        "Alison: Oh, you got that right. He was sweating buckets. It's not funny, Mick.",
        "Mick: I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Look, I -- I don't need you to fight my battles for me. I can handle jerks like Kantor and anyone else that comes along.",
        "Mick: Well, I bet you can, but I can't let lowlifes like that be mean to the people that I care about. I'm not wired that way.",

        "Emily: Hello! Paul? Anybody home? What?",

        "Barbara: I was going through some old boxes, and I found that.",
        "Paul: I don't remember taking this picture.",

        "Paul: You know, looking at this photo, it almost looks like we're a normal family.",
        "Barbara: That's what I told him.",
        "Paul: Told who?",
        "Barbara: Your father. He loved that picture.",
        "Paul: No, he didn't. He never loved anything or anybody except himself 'cause -- let's face it -- someone had to.",
        "Barbara: You know what, Honey? You didn't always feel that way. When you were little --",
        "Paul: Well, I didn't know any better. I was a child. But this Norman Rockwell scene never existed.",
        "Barbara: You're wrong, Paul. Your father loved you. In his own strange way, he loved you, and he wanted your life to be better than his.",
        "Paul: No, he didn't. He was a monster. Now that he's dead, it doesn't change anything. You were the one who stuck him with a pin to find out if he was really dead. He was in his coffin. You don't remember that?",
        "Barbara: Yes, and your father had his faults, but he wanted you to be happy.",
        "Paul: No, he didn't.",
        "Barbara: I am sure of that. Yeah. What if you could ask him?",
        "Paul: I can't.",
        "Barbara: But what if you could?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I love you. I just can't go away right now. And the thought of having another baby -- I mean, we're not in the right place. I mean, every day, there's a new crisis. Even though Meg is at Deerbrook --",
        "Damian: Damn it! Lily, I'm sick and tired of letting Meg control our lives!",

        "Lily: I'll get it. Hello?",
        "Meg: Uh, Lily, it's Meg. Please don't hang up.",
        "Lily: What do you want?",
        "Meg: Well, I realized that I apologized to Damian when he came by here earlier today, but I didn't get a chance to apologize to you.",
        "Lily: You didn't tell me you went to see Meg.",
        "Damian: Is that her?",
        "Meg: Lily, are you still there?",
        "Lily: Yes. You were saying?",
        "Meg: Well, I can't get better until I own up to my mistakes. And I know I hurt you, and I am very sorry for that. And I know it's just words for now, but I promise to do whatever it takes to make it up to you. And to Damian. Please make sure he knows that.",
        "Damian: Lily, you know, you can't believe a single word that woman says.",
        "Lily: Actually, she sounded reasonable for a change, and genuinely remorseful for what she did. And she wanted you to know that she plans to make it up to us.",

        "Holden: Molly, um, you know, we -- we really don't -- we don't need to do this.
