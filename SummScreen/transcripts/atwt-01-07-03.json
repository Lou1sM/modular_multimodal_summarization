        "Craig: She needs friends. She needs comfort. Why do you think she \r\nglommed onto Emma Snyder? Not that Emma isn't comforting. But how much bunt-cake \r\ncan a person take? Right? You go apologize to Rosanna. You comfort her. You see \r\nher through this. You support her through this. And then she repays the favor \r\nback later.",

But I didn't have time for that sort of purchase, \r\nso I just asked the realtor to find me an apartment. And yours was available.",

        "Holden: And what did you tell him?",
        "Aaron: We slept in a lot of places, Holden. We slept in a car. We slept \r\nin a motel room, a fraternity house. And, yeah, we slept in a barn. I changed \r\nthe subject before he -- asked me anything else.",

        "Lucy: They're like dreams, only I'm awake. I was looking in the mirror \r\nearlier, and suddenly Aaron was standing next to me. He was looking at me, and \r\nthen he looked at the wheelchair. And -- his face -- it was like he was \r\ndisgusted, like he couldn't stand the sight of me. And then he disappeared. And \r\nthen I disappeared.",
        "Sierra: Well, it sounds like you think that the wheelchair is gonna \r\nchange the way that Aaron feels about you. And that's a perfectly normal fear. \r\nBut, given the way he's behaved and the things I've heard him say, I think he \r\ngenuinely cares about you and he wants to help. But when you're feeling better, \r\nyou can figure out what you want. Not what Aaron wants, what you want. And Dr. \r\nHarris did say that your mind would be playing tricks on you.",
        "Lucy: I guess.",
        "Sierra: Yeah. And you know what? I'll mention this to him. Not the \r\ncontent or anything, but just that you're having these flashes. Maybe he can \r\nadjust your medication or your therapy or something.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Sierra: Sure. And listen -- remember something. You are doing so great. \r\nI mean, you're gonna go home. And you're gonna be in your own bedroom with your \r\nbooks and your music. And you'll be able to go outside and feel the sun. And \r\nevery single day you're gonna get stronger. And three months from now, this will \r\njust seem like a faint memory.",

        "Carly: Must we hate each other all the time?",

And Margo \r\nfound a couple who said their newborn baby had been kidnapped. So they're doing \r\nanother DNA test. Poor Jack. It's really killing him. He loves that baby.",

And with Craig's marketing plan -- well, \r\nI think the collection would be a huge success. But Craig -- he says no. He says \r\nwe signed a contract guaranteed that we wouldn't mess around.

        "Bob: His vision should be fine. There was a microscopic nick in an \r\nartery. It probably happened during the first surgery. When his pressure \r\nstabilized, it began to bleed. Dr. Harris caught it in time. There's no \r\npermanent damage. And your son should be fine.",
