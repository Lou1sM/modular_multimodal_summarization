        "Alison: Aaron, I have to talk to you.",
        "Aaron: I have got nothing to say to you.",
        "Alison: Aaron, please don't walk away from me. This is important.",
        "Aaron: I don't want you showing up at my work or anywhere from now on.",
        "Alison: Well, you wouldn't answer my calls. I had to come down here.",
        "Aaron: Make it quick, Ali.",
        "Alison: You said that you were gonna tell Chris the truth about him being the baby's father, but when you had the chance, you didn't.",
        "Aaron: 'Cause I -- had a problem with his attitude.",
        "Alison: Is that it, or have you changed your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Great, you're still here.",
        "Jessica: Hey, sweetheart. Just the person I want to see.",
        "Ben: Oh, yeah? And why is that?",
        "Jessica: No particular reason. You're always just the person I want to see.",
        "Ben: So, how did Paul's hearing go?",
        "Jessica: Well, he's out on bail.",
        "Ben: Okay.",
        "Jessica: Even though Lily Snyder and Dustin Donovan did their best to try to keep him locked up.",
        "Ben: Well, he had a great lawyer.",
        "Jessica: Rosanna Cabot posted his bail. So what are you doing here?",
        "Ben: Ah, this came for you. Figured you'd want to read it right away.",
        "Jessica: It's from Bonnie. Thank you. She's doing well. The food is appalling -- her words. And she's working in the prison library, pressuring the warden to get more books.",
        "Ben: What's the matter?",
        "Jessica: She wants me to write her about Sarah. She says it's a comfort, knowing that I promised to look after her.",
        "Ben: We just got married. You can't be expected to --",
        "Jessica: Well, I can be expected to keep my word, and I haven't done that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Oh, we didn't keep Paul from getting out on bail, but the cops are gonna go through this place. I'm positive they're gonna come up with something.",
        "Lily: Well, that depends.",
        "Dusty: Depends on what?",
        "Lily: On Hal, if he's just going through the motions of if he's really looking for something.",
        "Dusty: You think he's protecting Paul?",
        "Lily: I don't know. That's why we have to be there. Just --",
        "Dusty: I think you're better off on your own.",
        "Lily: No, I need a backup.",
        "Dusty: All right, I'm here. You know that.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Hello. Have either of you two seen Rosanna? I heard on the news she was here.",
        "Dusty: Did you hear on the news that she posted bail for Paul Ryan?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Lily: Did you know she was going to do that?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Lily: She put a killer back on the streets. You better start controlling your wife, Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Someone took you from me, Rose. And I'm gonna find the real killer, I swear to you. [Knock at door] Go away!",
        "Hal: Police. Open up.",
        "Paul: What's this all about?",
        "Hal: I have a warrant here to search your apartment.",

        "[Barbara is home and as she walks in she see a goblet like Rose drank out of.]",
        "Barbara: No. No, it can't be.",
        "Rosanna: Surprise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Lily, Rosanna does what she wants, and I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Lily: Does that mean you approve of Rosanna posting bail for Paul?",
        "Craig: No, I don't.",
        "Dusty: Do you think Paul killed Rose?",
        "Craig: Yes, I do.",
        "Dusty: That's good.",
        "Lily: If you feel that way, please tell her. And tell her if she has any feelings for the people that loved Rose that she will withdraw the money.",
        "Craig: Do you know where she is?",
        "Lily: No. The last time I saw her, she was with Paul. Bye, Craig.",
        "Dusty: Handle your wife, will you?",
        "Craig: Yeah. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Bonnie's in jail, counting on me to look after Sarah. And what have I done? Absolutely nothing.",
        "Ben: Sarah ran away from the shelter. She got caught stealing a wallet. That's not your fault, Jess, it's hers.",
        "Jennifer: Hi. Am I interrupting?",
        "Jessica: No, no. It's fine. What's up?",
        "Jennifer: I spoke to Dr. Daniels and -- about helping us clear Paul. And he said he could meet us at Al's on his break.",
        "Jessica: Oh, great. When?",
        "Jennifer: Five minutes.",
        "Jessica: Got to go.",
        "Ben: Hey, it's not a problem. I'm on my way to meeting Curtis, anyway.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Ben: Look, don't worry about Sarah. Everything's going to work out.",
        "Jessica: Not on its own it's not, but I'll deal with that later.",
        "Ben: Good luck.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks.",
        "Jessica: Okay, let's go save your brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Detective: Every cabinet in the kitchen, Cooper. Any box that's open, dump it.",
        "Hal: Paul, maybe you'd like to get out of here until this is over.",
        "Paul: I'm not gonna let you run me out of my own apartment, Hal. Hey, hey, be careful with that -- photo. So how is Will? I was about to call him when you stormed in.",
        "Hal: Will's a mess. He can't eat. He can't concentrate. The only thing that made him feel any better was seeing his mother.",
        "Paul: You let him see Barbara? Why?",
        "Hal: It was under Dr. Michaels' supervision.",
        "Paul: How did this happen?",
        "Hal: Barbara has agreed to enter therapy.",
        "Paul: She should be institutionalized.",
        "Hal: Oh, that was my original idea, but she has agreed to see someone on a regular basis.",
        "Paul: Hal, have you forgotten all about this restraining order? Have you forgotten why you had it even put there in the first place?",
        "Hal: Barbara is Will's mother. And whether any of us approve of that or not, Will depends on her.",
        "Paul: She's a murderer, and I'm going to prove it, Hal, with or without your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: How did you get in here?",
        "Rosanna: Money talks.",
        "Barbara: Whoever you bribed will be fired tomorrow morning.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, if they're still here tomorrow morning. I heard how you can be.",
        "Barbara: How did that get in here?",
        "Rosanna: What, the glass? I don't know. It was here when I got in.",
        "Barbara: You're lying. I'm calling the police.",
        "Rosanna: Maybe you should, because maybe that glass contains traces of the poison used to kill Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Would you just please stop doing that?",
        "Aaron: I've got a responsibility, Ali. Of course, you wouldn't know anything about that.",
        "Alison: Okay, hate me, but would you just at least just tell me what is going on?",
        "Aaron: I don't hate you. I feel sorry for you, okay? 'Cause anybody that can tell a guy that a baby is his knowing that it's not his some serious issues.",
        "Alison: Okay, well, if you feel that way, then why didn't you tell Chris the truth? And doesn't that make you just as rotten as me?",
        "Curtis: Excuse me, I'm looking for Dus --",
        "Aaron: Oh, my God.",
        "Curtis: Aaron?",
        "Aaron: Curtis, what's up, man? Oh, what's the last time I saw you? Memorial Christmas party, right, last year?",
        "Curtis: That's it.",
        "Aaron: Oh, wow.",
        "Curtis: So I'm looking for Dusty Donovan. I'm supposed to meet him for a job interview.",
        "Aaron: Doing what?",
        "Curtis: Whatever earns me a paycheck.",
        "Aaron: Oh, your Dad cut you off?",
        "Curtis: My Dad wants me to go to Oakdale Latin. I want to go to public school. I show him I'm responsible, maybe he'll let me get my way.",
        "Aaron: Well, you know, it's worth a try. Good luck, man.",
        "Curtis: Thanks. Hi, I'm Curtis.",
        "Aaron: Oh, sorry, this is -- this is Alison. This is my wife.",
        "Curtis: You're married?!",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Curtis: I hadn't heard.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah. It's one way to blow your life.",
        "Curtis: Well, I'm gonna check out the place, man. Yeah.",
        "Aaron: Be good.",
        "Alison: If I screwed up your life so bad, then -- well, why didn't you tell Chris the truth? That way, I could have been gone for good.",
        "Aaron: I told you. I didn't like the way he treated you at the hospital. Then he got all over me, and it bothered me. And, you know, I just don't want to do the guy any favors.",
        "Alison: Well, do you see now what I was saying? I mean, if Chris finds out he's the father, then he'll try everything he can to take away my baby.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah. So, anyway \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: You mentioned life and death?",
        "Jennifer: It wasn't for effect.",
        "Walker: Good. Those are my two favorite subjects.",
        "Jessica: As you may have heard, Paul Ryan is accused of poisoning Rose D'Angelo. I'm representing Paul.",
        "Walker: How do I fit in?",
        "Jessica: Well, your record in medical forensics is somewhat legendary, and we were hoping that you would help prove that my client is innocent.",
        "Walker: I'm sorry. That's not a job I'd ever accept.",
        "Jennifer: Why not?",
        "Walker: What I -- what I do is I gather scientific information, I analyze, I compare, and then I come to a conclusion. I could never start that process if you want me to guarantee that your client is innocent.",
        "Jessica: Well, maybe we should talk to someone else.",
        "Jennifer: No, that won't be necessary. Dr. Daniels, if you're willing to take this case, you have free reign. Any information that you find, you can take directly to the police.",
        "Walker: You're that sure your brother's innocent?",
        "Jennifer: I am that sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Have them rip up the floorboards, Hal. That's where I keep the real dead bodies.",
        "Hal: Don't give them any ideas, Paul.",
        "Paul: Hello, Lily. You must be thrilled. The police are here ruining my life when they should be out there, looking for the real killer.",
        "Lily: If you had any decency, you would just confess and make it easier for everybody. But since you don't, this is what you get.",
        "Hal: Excuse me, but what are you two doing here?",
        "Lily: We just wanted to see how all this goes.",
        "Hal: You thinking about a career in law enforcement?",
        "Lily: I think you know why I have a special interest in this case.",
        "Dusty: I have an interest, too. That's why we're here together. Maybe we can help you out.",
        "Hal: We're doing just fine without you, thank you very much. So why don't the two of you turn around and just go home?",
        "Lily: We're not doing anything here. We're just observing. We're not directing traffic.",
        "Hal: Well, this is not a circus, although it's rapidly becoming one, in the first place. And in the second place, you're risking contaminating my investigation.",
        "Paul: And in the third place, I don't want you here.",
        "Dusty: What you want is getting less and less relevant these days. Have you noticed that?",
        "Hal: Morrow, escort these two good citizens out of this building.",
        "Cop: Yes, sir.",
        "Lily: I'll be back. I will be back, and I'll make sure that you pay for what you did to my sister.",
        "Dusty: Easy.",
        "Lily: So let's go. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Apparently, you think we have much to talk about. Shall I order up some hors d'oeuvres, have a nice pouilly-fuisse?",
        "Rosanna: Apparently, you think this is a social call. I'm here because someone has to do your job.",
        "Barbara: And that job would be?",
        "Rosanna: Being a mother. Protecting your son.",
        "Barbara: Don't you ever say that to me again. Do you understand?",
        "Rosanna: The truth hurts, doesn't it?",
        "Barbara: Is that why I have the pleasure of your company today, so you can critique my mothering skills?",
        "Rosanna: I'm here because I'm curious as to why you would set up Paul for Rose's murder.",
        "Barbara: I have done no such thing.",
        "Rosanna: Really? But this glass, Barbara, it certainly seems to follow you everywhere.",
        "Barbara: What do you want, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: I want you to call the police and tell them that you took the evidence from the church and used it to set up Paul.",
        "Barbara: And if I refuse?",
        "Rosanna: Then I will call Hal myself, and I will tell him I found the glass in your possession.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Do you really think I killed her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: What -- what are you doing here?",
        "Craig: I'm saving us from disaster.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: How's the stock market treating you these days, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: Why?",
        "Barbara: Because, if this is the kind of leadership you're providing, Cabot Motors will be in chapter 11 by the end of the quarter.",
        "Rosanna: Do you think I'm bluffing? I'll call the police.",
        "Barbara: Oh, please. Give my regards to my former spouse while you're at it!",
        "[Glass shatters] [Rosanna gasps] The police have the real goblet in their possession.",
        "Rosanna: You don't know that. Hal could have --",
        "Barbara: This is nothing but a cheap trick!",
        "Rosanna: You expect me to be intimidated by you? Well, I'm not.",
        "Barbara: I really don't care what you are. Because no one will stop me from doing what needs to be done. Do you understand me? No one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: The article that I read said that Paul was caught with a glass that tested positive for the same poison that killed Rose D'Angelo. I mean, I can't change that.",
        "Jessica: We don't expect you to.",
        "Walker: Well, then how can I help?",
        "Jennifer: Listen, Dr. Daniels, the police were tipped off to the exact time and place that Paul had the glass in his hand. It was a setup, just like everything else that points to my brother as the murderer.",
        "Walker: Setup, coincidence, wrong place, wrong time -- those are all easy labels to put on it, but to prove it, that's very hard.",
        "Jessica: Okay, but look, if you were able to go over the coroner's report, and if you got to examine the glass for yourself, I mean, isn't it possible that you could find some discrepancy or some additional information that would just blow a hole in the prosecution's case?",
        "Walker: I'll answer that question in two parts. One, everything is possible. Two, if it's there, I can find it.",
        "Jennifer: Does that mean you'll take the case?",
        "Walker: I'm friends with your father. I already have a relationship with the OPD. You're asking me to work against them. I'm not sure that's something I want to do.",
        "Jennifer: Here is something I know about my father. He's been just as much of a father to Paul, too, okay? And I'm sure that he would prefer that the police department be wrong than have an innocent man in jail. Now, are you that same kind of man, Dr. Daniels? Do you live your life by principles or excuses?",
        "Walker: Well, I can see you're not going to take no for an answer, are you? Well, then, let's get started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: You want to take a look? It's a list of everything we're taking.",
        "Paul: Clothing, shoes -- Hal, come on. What are you looking for?",
        "Hal: Oh, traces of poison, maybe a footprint we can identify later. That kind of stuff.",
        "Paul: My computer?",
        "Hal: Sorry about that. Look, Paul, for the record, this isn't any fun for me, either.",
        "Paul: Hal, you have known me almost my whole life. Do you really think I killed her?",
        "Hal: No. But a judge thinks there's enough evidence to bring you to trial, so I'm doing my job.",
        "Paul: I think of her every minute of the day.",
        "Hal: You also ripped her to shreds on her wedding day in front of a town that is not known for its short memory.",
        "Paul: That was a mistake, and if I could go back in time and take that back --",
        "Hal: You can't. Everybody gets angry, Paul. It's part of being human. But to take it that far? I mean, what were you thinking, Paul, to plot her humiliation? I mean, how could that possibly have served anyone, including you?",
        "Paul: Do you remember what it felt like when you found out that Barbara had run off with Craig?",
        "Hal: Yes, I do. It was one of the low points of my life.",
        "Paul: And then were you thinking straight, or did you just want to hurt somebody as badly as you had been hurt?",
        "Hal: It was complicated by the children but, yes, there were times that I felt that way.",
        "Paul: Well, you take that feeling, and you double it, because I thought Rose had been with my best friend twice. I know what I did to Rose on the altar. Because of it, I die a little every day.",
        "Hal: I'll be in touch with you about when you can pick up your stuff.",
        "Paul: Can I give Will a call?",
        "Hal: Let me get a read on how he's doing, and I'll give you a call. I'll let you know.",
        "Paul: I just want him to know I'm all right.",
        "Hal: Like I said, I'll give you a call.",
        "Craig: Hello, Paul.",
        "Paul: Hello, Craig. What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Looking for my wife.",
        "Paul: She's not here.",
        "Craig: No? Any idea where she is?",
        "Paul: No idea. If I had to guess, I'd say she's with Barbara at the Lakeview.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Paul: Because your lovely wife knows that I didn't kill Rose. So she's trying to help me with Barbara. She knows that Barbara set me up.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Of course, we haven't known each other that long. I don't even know where you're from.",
        "Tish: You're not gonna say, \"tell me about yourself,\" are you? 'Cause when it comes to show and tell, I would much rather show.",
        "Alison: You were right. I should have stayed at home.",
        "Aaron: No, Ali, wait, please. Look, I can't stand this feeling, hanging everybody up like this. Chris is here now. Maybe I should just get this over with.",
        "Curtis: All right, so how should I play it? Should I stick around, look anxious for the job, or take off, risk losing it?",
        "Aaron: I'm gonna go get Dusty, okay?",
        "Curtis: Thanks.",
        "Aaron: Dusty, Curtis Harris is here. Hi, Lily. He says he's supposed to meet you for a job interview.",
        "Dusty: Tell him to wait, all right? I'm thinking you and I should have a drink, Lil.",
        "Lily: Are we celebrating something?",
        "Dusty: Paul Ryan has been arrested and charged. He's not in jail yet, but it's a hell of a start.",
        "Lily: I wonder if Hal found anything in his apartment.",
        "Dusty: Do you think he'd tell you if you called him?",
        "Lily: Yeah, sure.",
        "Dusty: Who cares, huh? I don't mind seeing it on the 10:00 news. Voila. One second. Here we go.",
        "[Dusty start to pour Lily a glass. She sees imaginary Rose shake her head no.]",
        "Lily: No, Dusty!",
        "Dusty: What's wrong? Too early for you?",
        "Lily: Oh, that's Rose's favorite champagne. I can't do this.",
        "Dusty: Yes, you can. She'd want us to kill the whole bottle.",
        "Lily: I'm sure she would, but drinking all that champagne isn't gonna bring Rose back, so why are we celebrating?",
        "Dusty: I tell you what, I'm gonna put a fresh one aside, and I'm gonna mark it, \"do not open until Paul Ryan is convicted.\"",
        "Lily: I hope we're drinking it soon.",
        "Dusty: We will be. He's not gonna get away.",
        "Lily: What do you think Rose would say if she knew we were teaming up to convict Paul?",
        "Dusty: I think she'd cheer us on.",
        "Lily: Or she'd tell us to mind our own beeswax. I miss her.",
        "Dusty: Me, too.",
        "Lily: I've got to get home to my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Sorry I'm late. I had to swing by the courthouse and see Jess.",
        "Curtis: It's okay. Uh -- Dad, could you give me a minute?",
        "Dusty: Your son and I are talking about a job.",
        "Ben: Here?",
        "Curtis: I thought it would be cool if I earned my own money.",
        "Ben: Look, I don't have any problem with that. But this place doesn't exactly cater to the high school crowd. I'm not so sure you need to be hanging out here.",
        "Dusty: Okay, let me know what you guys decide. All right?",
        "Ben: Now, Curtis, I don't expect you to know this, since you haven't been around for a while. But Dusty Donovan has been in trouble with the law several times.",
        "Curtis: Was he ever convicted?",
        "Ben: Not that I know of.",
        "Curtis: Well, then he's innocent. Isn't that what you've always told me?",
        "Ben: Look, you want a job; I'll get you a job at the hospital.",
        "Curtis: No, thanks.",
        "Ben: Why not?",
        "Curtis: Too many sick people.",
        "Ben: Okay. I'll call in a favor. Curtis, there's all kinds of jobs you can do.",
        "Curtis: I want to get my own job. Find it, keep it, show you how responsible I can be.",
        "Ben: Okay. Okay. Assuming Dusty hires you, you have my permission to work here part time.",
        "Curtis: All right --",
        "Ben: If you to go to Oakdale Latin, and you keep up your \"a\" average.",
        "Curtis: Come on, Dad --",
        "Ben: No arguments, no complaints. That's the deal. Or you can find yourself a job someplace else. It's your decision.",
        "Curtis: Okay. Thanks.",

        "Alison: If you're going to ruin my life, you just might as well just get it over with.",
        "Aaron: If there's one thing I've learned from all this, okay, is that I gotta start taking charge of my own life. I'm not gonna wait for you, Holden, anybody to tell me what to do. All right. So here it is. I'm not ratting you out to Chris. That's between you two.",
        "Alison: Thank you so much, Aaron --",
        "Aaron: That doesn't mean I'm going to keep pretending to be the father of this baby. That garbage is gone. You're on your own.",

        "Holden: I thought I heard you come in. You okay? What happened at Paul's bail hearing?",
        "Lily: Dusty froze all of Paul's assets so he couldn't make bail. But Rosanna Cabot showed up and wrote a check. He just -- walked out.",
        "Holden: Why would she do that?",
        "Lily: I guess she's his new best friend.",
        "Holden: Have you been at the courthouse all this time?",
        "Lily: Dusty and I went by Paul's penthouse. Because the police were searching the place, and we --",
        "Holden: You what?",
        "Lily: We wanted to just check up on them. Make sure they were doing their job properly.",
        "Holden: Lily, I know that you want Paul to go to jail for this --",
        "Lily: He killed my sister, Holden. He's gotta pay.",
        "Holden: I don't think it's such a good idea for you and Dusty to become this two-person task force. He is still the same guy that he was when he set up Aaron as a bag man with a bookie. When he got Molly involved with gangsters, the same gangsters that kidnapped you and Rose. You see the pattern here? Lily, I'm worried about you.",
        "Faith: Mommy!",
        "Lily: Hey! Did you have fun sledding with Daddy? Did you? Yes. Oh, what do we have here? Oh, thank you. Is that me? Yes. And who's this? Are those wings?",
        "Faith: It's Aunt Rose in heaven.",

        "Carly: Bad time?",
        "Paul: When's the good time gonna start?",
        "Carly: What the heck happened here?",
        "Paul: Oh, the Oakdale Police Department came by. Decided to redecorate.",
        "Carly: Well, don't expect me to grab a broom.",
        "Paul: Carly, what happened? The last time I saw you, you made me feel like I was talking to a friend.",
        "Carly: I wanted information. Friendly was a way to get it.",
        "Paul: So, you've changed your mind? You think I killed Rose?",
        "Carly: No. But I will never forgive you for what you did on her wedding day.",
        "Paul: That makes two of us. What do you want?",
        "Carly: More information.",
        "Paul: Use my phone, call 411.",
        "Carly: Paul, don't you want to find Rose's killer?",
        "Paul: Well, it's pretty much all that's keeping me going. I don't know how, but somehow and some way, I'm gonna make Barbara pay for what she's done.",
        "Carly: I'm all for making Barbara unhappy. I can't think of anybody who deserves it more. But she didn't kill Rose, Paul. I'm certain of that.",
        "Paul: You're still on your Mitzi kick.",
        "Carly: I confronted her with what I knew. You know, the embezzlement, and the fact that she bought a train ticket on the morning of the wedding -- and you know what she did?",
        "Paul: What did she do?",
        "Carly: She threatened me.",
        "Paul: Doesn't prove anything. Rose and Mitzi had been best friends for a long time.",
        "Carly: So were you and Dusty.",
        "Paul: It was Barbara. And very soon, I will be able to prove that.",
        "Carly: How can you be so sure?",
        "Paul: Because now I've got a secret weapon. Your sister, Rosanna.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: What I can't understand is why you had to set up Paul for murder. I mean, hasn't he suffered enough? Or do you feel like he has to be punished for trying to get away from you?",
        "Barbara: You have no idea what you are talking about.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I don't, do I? Well, if I'm so wrong, why did seeing that little glass make you so angry?",
        "Barbara: I want you out of here.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Rosanna: What -- what are you doing here?",

        "Ben: So what exactly is the job description?",
        "Curtis: Bartending?",
        "Dusty: Bussing tables, but I like a guy who aims high. All our bartenders are 21 years or older.",
        "Ben: Great. Well, whatever work schedule you two agree on, just make sure you have enough time for your studies.",
        "Curtis: I know.",
        "Ben: All righty. Busboy, I hope this works out for you.",
        "Curtis: Ha!",
        "Alison: Aaron, I don't think that you're getting the whole picture. You stop acting like the father, and everyone will know it's Chris.",
        "Aaron: I can't worry about that anymore. Ali, I have enough problems as it is!",
        "Alison: Do you mean Lucy?",
        "Aaron: I am not gonna stop hoping that we have a chance, okay?",
        "Alison: Aaron, she already moved on. You saw her with that guy --",
        "Aaron: Clark? He's just somebody to get her mind off me.",
        "Alison: That is such a guy thing to say.",
        "Aaron: And what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Alison: That you think Lucy can't live without you. That you're the only guy in the world that she's ever gonna love.",
        "Aaron: Look, Lucy didn't want to break up with me, okay? She only did it because she found that I slept with you, and she felt like she had no choice.",
        "Alison: And you also married me. And things like that tend to turn a girl off.",
        "Dusty: Aaron, come here.",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Here's the deal -- I just hired Curtis to take your job.",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Dusty: Na-ahh! Did I get you?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, you got me.",
        "Dusty: Say mercy. All right, get serious. Show him the back, would ya?",
        "Aaron: Okay, yeah, all right. All right, congratulations, man. Welcome aboard. Let's go.",
        "Curtis: Thanks.",
        "Aaron: Ali. Lies got you to this point. Maybe the truth will get you out.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Tish: Hi. Didn't you and Chris used to date?",
        "Alison: Yeah. What -- did he tell you about me?",
        "Tish: Oh, he didn't mention anything. You're off his radar screen, honey. Maybe you should just go away.",

        "Jennifer: Don't you think two people would be more convincing than one?",
        "Walker: Especially when the other person is you.",

        "Holden: Yeah, sure. Anything you need. You want to go with me, to pick up your brother? Let's go get your coat. Okay? And I'll be right with you. Are you okay?",
        "Lily: It's just -- I need a little time alone, if that's okay. I hope you understand.",

        "Paul: Rosanna is a big girl. She can take care of herself. I'm pretty sure she can take care of Barbara, too.",
        "Carly: That's not the point. I'm thinking of Craig.",
        "Paul: Oh. What about Craig?",
        "Carly: Rosanna and Craig happen to love each other a lot. And her getting mixed up in this case; it could be the worst thing possible for that marriage.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Carly: Craig Montgomery is a very possessive man. I don't think he's going to enjoy watching his wife go running off to rescue another man.",

        "Barbara: Your little wife is deluded, Craig.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, if I'm so deluded, then how did Paul end up with the evidence in his hands, the minute the police showed up?",
        "Barbara: I have asked myself the same question a thousand times. So if you've sold out your partner, Molly, there must be something in it for you, Craig. In fact, maybe your other lovely partner is involved. Maybe you even had a hand in this yourself?",
