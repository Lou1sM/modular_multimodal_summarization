        "The bank calls in Carly's loan on Metro for being delinquent. She asks Henry for help, but he doesn't have the money from his book yet; he teases her about getting a \u0091sugar daddy.' Janet and Jack talk about getting a place of their own and Jack tells her that he is going to try to take out a second mortgage on his home again. They go to speak with Carly, who is not on board with their request, because she needs to do the same to save Metro. Janet and Carly disagree while Jack doesn't think she should take out a second mortgage in case Metro still goes under and then his kids could lose their home. An exasperated Carly tells Jack she will get the money elsewhere and that he can take the money and go start his dream life. Jack seems worried by this. Craig makes Margo come to the hospital to arrest Lucy for kidnapping. Dusty is sure that Craig is planning something against Lucy and tells her that Derek is going to bring her a place that is secure. Josie spies on Craig for Dusty. Josie tells him that Craig is going to have Lucy arrested. Dusty finally is able to convince Lucy to leave town for a while. Josie sends Craig and Margo on a wild gooses chase while Lucy says an emotional goodbye to Johnny. Lucy makes Dusty promise to make peace with Craig \u0096 for Johnny's sake. Henry and Katie talk about her transplant for Johnny and then how Craig is making her life hard. Katie wrestles with if she did the right thing for Johnny after she finds out from Margo that Craig wants Lucy arrested. Dusty tries to make peace and Craig seems on board but then he reverts back to his old self and wants Margo to arrest Dusty and Josie for aiding and abetting Lucy's get away. Katie appeals to Craig to do the right thing by Johnny. Craig relents and agrees to hold off. Johnny continues to see his mom in Josie, which seems to bring Dusty comfort. Craig assures Margo and Katie that no one will ever take Johnny away from him again though."

        "Banker: Ms. Tenney, is this a bad time?",
        "Carly: No, no, it's fine. I just -- I didn't realize that I left the door open. Mr. Reynolds, hello. I hope you come in peace. But you don't. Please don't tell me this isn't about my loan.",
        "Banker: We're calling in everything that's more than two months behind.",
        "Carly: Two months? I'll get the money. I will find the money soon. I promise. It's just, things have been sort of difficult lately with the holidays and the economy the way it is, you know, but people drink when times are tough. It's a law of nature, at least I hope so. Although, if the holidays don't drive you to drink, I don't know what will. Look at your face. You can't help me at all, can you?",
        "Banker: Isn't there anywhere else you can go for the money.",
        "Carly: I know my ex-husband was just turned down for a second mortgage on the house. But I suppose I could try someone else --",
        "Banker: Try. I'd hate to see your lose your business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Stop for a second. Listen to that.",
        "Janet: I don't hear anything.",
        "Jack: Exactly. We have the whole place to ourselves. The dish can wait.",
        "Janet: Oh, I can't wait until we get our own house. But I'm being patient. I'm being patient.",
        "Jack: The hell with being patient.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Jack: Come on, look at us. We're married. We're legit. And we're sneaking around like Parker and Liberty.",
        "Janet: Ah, bite your tongue, mister.",
        "Jack: I'm serious, Janet. Come on, let's just -- we should do this.",
        "Janet: Well, do we have any money?",
        "Jack: Not in cash, but in assets.",
        "Janet: You mean, the house.",
        "Jack: It's got to be possible to get a second mortgage.",
        "Janet: You already tried for a second mortgage.",
        "Jack: Yes, I know, but that was a while ago. Maybe things eased up after the New Year. It can't hurt in trying.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but wouldn't that screw up your credit, even if they say no?",
        "Jack: My credit is fine. Assuming that the bank's are loaning to anyone.",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Come on, we deserve this. Living here --",
        "Janet: Is fine. It's fine. Especially since Emma and I figured out the whole kitchen thing. It's not a problem.",
        "Jack: It's not about Emma. Living here feels temporary. You and I are permanent. We should start living our lives for real.",
        "Janet: I don't need a house for that.",
        "Jack: But I want you to have one. Let's do this. I'll find another bank. I can make it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Lucy and Johnny are at Oakdale Memorial hospital right now. I want you to get over here and arrest her for kidnapping my son.",
        "Margo: What -- there's got to be more to the story than that.",
        "Craig: She took Johnny out of the country. Would you rather I call the FBI?",
        "Margo: You want to traumatize your son?",
        "Craig: He'll get over it.",
        "Margo: Oh, yes, the Craig Montgomery school of parenting.",
        "Craig: Sticks and stones, Margo. Now, what's it going to be? Are you going to do your job, or would you like me to handle it my way?",
        "Margo: No, no. Don't do anything, I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: The doctor says he's going to be asleep for a while. Why don't you go back to the hotel, shower and get some rest. I'll stay with him.",
        "Lucy: No, if he wakes up --",
        "Dusty: If he wakes up, I'll call you and you can tell him you're coming right over. We have to figure out a way to trust each other.",
        "Lucy: I do trust you.",
        "Dusty: It's hard to tell sometimes.",
        "Lucy: All right, a shower sounds good. And I'll bring back some of his toys.",
        "Craig: Where you off to?",
        "Lucy: Oh, I'm just going to go get some of Johnny's toys for when he wakes up. He's going to have to sit still in bed for a few days, so --",
        "Craig: You don't have to go over there. I can send someone to the Lakeview to get whatever you need.",
        "Lucy: Can they take a shower for me?",
        "Craig: What if he wakes up and you're not here?",
        "Lucy: Dusty's got it covered. I'll be back in a few hours.",
        "Craig: Yes, this is Craig Montgomery again. I need to talk to Lieutenant Hughes before she's --",
        "Dusty: If you want to go in and see Johnny, I'll give you some privacy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Go away, Brad. I don't want to talk.",
        "Henry: It's me, Bubbles.",
        "Katie: Henry, hey! It's so good to see you!",
        "Henry: You too. Come here. Brad sent me.",
        "Katie: Traitor.",
        "Henry: Well, he said you were in the hospital. And not even the greatest poker hand in history couldn't have kept me away.",
        "Katie: That's sweet. I think.",
        "Henry: He also said that you were mad at him.",
        "Katie: Livid. So, if you want to talk about Brad, you can go find the floor nurse and ask her to show you where he autographed her lower back.",
        "Henry: No, thank you.",
        "Katie: Then let's change the subject.",
        "Henry: What's going on? Why are you in here? What's going on?",
        "Katie: My big-mouthed husband didn't tell you?",
        "Henry: No, he said he was sworn to secrecy. It was like he was talking about international incident or something.",
        "Katie: I donated my bone marrow to a sick child.",
        "Henry: I heard that's really painful.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I'll let you know once the pain medication wears off.",
        "Henry: Who's the kid?",
        "Katie: Johnny.",
        "Henry: Johnny? As in my book Johnny? That Johnny, they found him?",
        "Katie: Well, Lucy brought him back here because he was so sick.",
        "Henry: That's fantastic! That's incredible. I can't believe it! I mean, it's awful. It's a tragedy. And do they think he's going to be okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, the doctors think he'll be fine. They did what's called a mini- transplant. Which is supposed to be very successful in young children.",
        "Henry: Oh, that is such good news for him. That is such great news for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Lucy, wait, wait!",
        "Lucy: What's wrong? Did something go wrong with Johnny?",
        "Dusty: No, Johnny's fine. I'm worried about you. You got to watch yourself.",
        "Dusty: Craig's up to something.",
        "Lucy: He's always up to something. Did you leave Johnny by himself?",
        "Dusty: No. I sent Craig in to see him.",
        "Lucy: You think he's up to something, so you send him in to see Johnny? Are you out of your mind?",
        "Dusty: He's not going to hurt his son.",
        "Lucy: Since when?",
        "Dusty: He's not going to risk his child's life. That much I'm sure of.",
        "Lucy: I'm his child, too.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, but you can take care of yourself. And you betrayed him. Which, to Craig, trumps DNA. You're on your own. You said you trust me. Did you mean it?",
        "Lucy: At the time.",
        "Dusty: Did you see Craig leaving the hospital? Did he say anything to you?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, he offered to send someone to pick up Johnny's toys so I could stay with him. But that could just be his way of controlling me.",
        "Dusty: Or he has something in store for you at the hospital.",
        "Lucy: Seems like a stretch, but -- well, I wouldn't put anything past my father.",
        "Dusty: He thinks you're going back to the Lakeview. So don't. Listen to me, go to Metro. I'm going to have Derek Coburn meet you there. He's going to take you someplace safe.",
        "Lucy: And what happens when Johnny wakes up and I'm gone?",
        "Dusty: It's not going to be for long. Go to Metro. I'll find you there later, and we'll decide that to do next.",
        "Lucy: All right, when Johnny wakes up, make sure he knows I'll be back. And that I love him.",
        "Dusty: Derek, it's me. I need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Stop snowing me, Coleman. What is going on with you?",
        "Henry: Nothing. It's a simple semantic misunderstanding. It's not awesome news. It's just an awesome coincidence. Because my book came out.",
        "Katie: So?",
        "Henry: You haven't read it?",
        "Katie: Been kind of busy getting holes drilled into my hip.",
        "Henry: Right, right.",
        "Katie: I will read it while I'm in here.",
        "Henry: Okay, I don't want to give too much away, but it basically revolves around the search for Johnny. And in the book, I play the hero.",
        "Katie: So it's fiction?",
        "Henry: Ha.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, I'm just kidding. I know how hard it is to write a book. Just finishing is heroic.",
        "Henry: Well, thank you very much. The reason that this timing is good news, I mean, not that there's anything good about cancer or whatever, and of course there isn't, that goes without saying, but the upside of this timing for the book is that it gives the publishers what they call a platform. Something to publicize.",
        "Katie: I know what a platform is. And a sick little boy is not it.",
        "Henry: I'm not going to exploit him, Katie. But if he gets better, which I know he will -- that's heartwarming, isn't it? And if I play my cards right, I could end up on \"Oprah.\" So, do you think that you could get Lucy to bring him to my next signing?",
        "Katie: Stick with fiction. Please. You don't want to get anywhere near the real story.",
        "Henry: Why not, why not? He's going home. He's going to have a whole new lease on life. I mean, that's a happy ending to me if you ask me.",
        "Katie: Far from it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: Dusty? Is everything okay?",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Josie: I just came by to check on you and Johnny. What's wrong?",
        "Dusty: Nothing yet. But I could use your help.",
        "Josie: Anything. You know that.",
        "Dusty: Craig's in Johnny's room. I need you to keep an eye on him. Every move he makes. Even if he seems harmless.",
        "Josie: Where are you going to be?",
        "Dusty: I've got to go meet Lucy.",
        "Josie: Your son's in the hospital. Don't you think that's a strange time for a hook up?",
        "Dusty: A what?",
        "Josie: Do I have to draw you a picture?",
        "Dusty: Johnny's the only thing I care about anymore. Can I count on you to do what I asked?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Johnny -- Johnny, its okay. Its okay, son. You're at the hospital, remember?",
        "Johnny: Where's Lulu?",
        "Craig: She had to go away for a little while, but I'm here.",
        "Johnny: Why?",
        "Craig: Well, because -- she asked me to look after you for a little while. I'm her daddy. Did you know that? Well, I am. And I love her very, very much. And I love you very, very much. And nothing bad is going to happen. You're safe. I know this is hard to understand, but you and Lulu won't have to keep traveling to all these different kinds places anymore. You can stay here. With me. You're home, Johnny. And no one's ever going to take you away again. We're going to be a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, hi.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hi. May we?",
        "Carly: Yeah, you know, I was just thinking about you. There's something that I wanted to talk to you about.",
        "Jack: Really? Us, too.",
        "Carly: Okay, you go first.",
        "Jack: Well, Janet and I -- we want to buy a house.",
        "Carly: Oh, a house. Now?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, we haven't picked out anything yet, but -- yes. Which means I've got to go back to the bank and try to get another second mortgage on this place.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Jack. That's out of the question.",
        "Jack: I'm not going to lose the house, if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Carly: No, of course not, Jack. I know you would do whatever you had to do to pay the mortgage, I know that.",
        "Jack: So what's the problem?",
        "Carly: I was going to ask you if I could take a second mortgage out on the house. The bank called in the loan that I got for Metro.",
        "Jack: You want to take out a mortgage to make payments on another one?",
        "Janet: Oh, sounds like the American dream.",
        "Jack: So what do we do now?",
        "Carly: I don't know. But I can't lose my business going, Jack. And there's not enough money for both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What's really going on, Katie?",
        "Katie: I don't want to talk about it. Maybe it'll just go away. Or not.",
        "Craig: Henry, hello.",
        "Henry: The plot thickens.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Henry: I'm an author. It's my new book. If you'd like to buy a copy, I'll be happy to sign it for you.",
        "Craig: What's it about?",
        "Henry: Well, actually, this one's Katie's with private inscription and everything. And besides, I like to keep my readers surprised.",
        "Katie: What do you want, Craig?",
        "Craig: Johnny's doing fine. I thought you'd want to know.",
        "Katie: Is he in a lot of pain?",
        "Craig: Well, if he is, he didn't admit it.",
        "Katie: He is your son.",
        "Craig: I watched him sleep for a while. He reminded me of Bryant. And Lucy when she was small. You gave me another chance. No one else would have done that, Katie.",
        "Katie: I did it for Johnny.",
        "Craig: And I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure he lives a good, long life. He wouldn't even have that without you. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart.",
        "Katie: He's my family, too, Craig.",
        "Craig: It feels good to have you on my side.",
        "Katie: Don't make me regret it.",
        "Craig: I won't.",
        "Henry: Since when is the evil brother your best friend?",
        "Katie: This is about Johnny. That's all.",
        "Henry: Oh, I don't think so. And I know all your tells.",
        "Katie: This isn't a card game, Henry.",
        "Henry: But you are holding something back. Now, if I were a betting man, I would say that the odds are about 10-to-1 that if anything is going wrong between you and Brad, big brother Craig is behind it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I asked the bank for a little more time, and they told me they just can't give me that kind leeway right now.",
        "Janet: Yeah, right.",
        "Carly: I have to come up with the cash, Jack, or Metro is finished.",
        "Jack: How much cash are we talking about?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: I got to take this. Do you mind if I --",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry about the house, Janet.",
        "Janet: No you're not. And now Jack and I have to suffer because you're a lousy businesswoman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, Craig, how's Johnny?",
        "Craig: Sleeping. Did you arrest Lucy?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Craig: Damn it, Margo --",
        "Margo: Well, I went to the Lakeview. She wasn't there.",
        "Craig: Do I have to do everything myself?",
        "Margo: I think kidnapping your daughter to punish her for kidnapping your son pretty much makes everything a wash. And by the way, I am not your private security force. So, if this is another one of your little revenge tricks --",
        "Craig: It's not. But Johnny is in there fighting for his life. And he didn't get there by himself. Lucy brought him back here.",
        "Margo: And then she just left?",
        "Craig: No, she wouldn't do that. I don't know why she wasn't at the hotel, but sooner or later, she's going to come back for Johnny. All we have to do is wait.",
        "Margo: We?",
        "Craig: Oh, I'm filing charges. Two years ago, she left town with my son. That's kidnapping. And I expect you to throw the book at her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Lucy?",
        "Lucy: How's Johnny? Did he wake up?",
        "Dusty: He's fine. He's going to make it.",
        "Lucy: Of course he's going to make it. I didn't bring him back here just to lose him. I told him I was going to keep him safe. I can't let him down.",
        "Dusty: We won't. We won't.",
        "Lucy: Then what am I doing here? I should be by his bed in case he's terrified when he wakes up.",
        "Dusty: No, that's not a good idea. Craig's planning something.",
        "Lucy: I'm not afraid of my father.",
        "Dusty: No, maybe you should be.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Josie, what's up? Room. They're planning to arrest Lucy for kidnapping. Can you hang out there for a while, and see what they're up to?",
        "Josie: Sure, no problem. That poor kid needs all the help he can get.",
        "Lucy: What's happening?",
        "Dusty: Your father wants you arrested for kidnapping.",
        "Lucy: I should've known all those \"I love you, I miss you, Lullaby\" stuff was bull. What is wrong with me?",
        "Dusty: He's your father.",
        "Lucy: There's more to being a father than DNA.",
        "Dusty: I know that.",
        "Lucy: You know, for the record, I never thought you were like my father.",
        "Dusty: Thanks. Well, you can't stay here. Margo goes by the book, so, technically, you're a kidnapper.",
        "Lucy: There were extenuating circumstances.",
        "Dusty: You're no good to Johnny if you're in jail. You got to leave town.",
        "Lucy: No way. I stand by what I did.",
        "Dusty: Even so, you're father's going to make you suffer for it.",
        "Lucy: I can handle my father. But Johnny needs me now more than ever. I'm not going to abandon him, just to save my own skin.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer wanted to make sure that Craig would never come near my son.",
        "Lucy: You're saying it's too late?",
        "Dusty: Maybe. Listen, Johnny cannot be on the road while he's sick. He needs time to recover.",
        "Lucy: Of course, I know. That's all that matters.",
        "Dusty: But you can't wait around for him to get better.",
        "Lucy: I can't leave him. I won't walk away from him, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: He's got me now. If you really love Johnny --",
        "Lucy: How can you even say that?",
        "Dusty: Because he can't live on the run. He needs a home. Come on, let's stop punishing this kid for our sins. Please. Let me help you get away while you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You've got it all right now. Look around you. You've got a husband who worships the ground you walk on. You've got a terrific career. You're beautiful. The world is your oyster. Don't let Craig swallow it whole.",
        "Katie: I think he's allergic to shellfish.",
        "Henry: Okay, in that case -- never mind. But don't forget what I said.",
        "Katie: I'm sure you'll be all too happy to remind me.",
        "Henry: Yes, and read -- it's fundamental. Hey.",
        "Margo: Hey.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Margo: So, how long were you planning to keep this a secret?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I don't know if I can do this. Johnny's my whole world.",
        "Dusty: He's not your son. You've got to live your own life someday.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but not now.",
        "Dusty: What choice do you have?",
        "Lucy: God, I hate my father. I hate him so much.",
        "Dusty: He's a lousy parent. I'm not perfect, but I'll take care of him. He's all I have left of Jennifer.",
        "Lucy: You know, he's not Jen, he's his own person.",
        "Dusty: Yes. I'll make sure he grows up to be his own person. I promise you that. I'm asking you to have faith in me.",
        "Lucy: Okay, on two conditions.",
        "Dusty: Name them.",
        "Lucy: First, you have to make peace with Craig. You have to stop fighting over Johnny. He's too young to survive all this violence. And he's had enough pain to last a whole lifetime. So some way, you and Craig have to find a way to coexist. For Johnny's health, if for nothing else.",
        "Dusty: Okay.",
        "Lucy: You have to promise me.",
        "Dusty: I promise you. You have my word. What's the next condition?",

        "Carly: You don't appear to be suffering, Janet. First, you wanted Jack to throw you some kind of big, lavish wedding. You couldn't have that, and now you want a house? I think you need to understand that you're living on a policeman's salary.",
        "Janet: I gave up that wedding so that J.J. could go to boarding school.",
        "Carly: What a saint.",
        "Janet: Oh, Carly, I'm not saying I'm a saint, but I am not an evil, greedy stepmother, either. Okay, I need that house. We need it for all the kids.",
        "Carly: The kids have a house. They have this house. And they have the farm.",
        "Janet: And they will always have that. But we need a place that's bigger. For all of us and all the kids. So that we can be a family. But you don't want that, do you? Because that would mean that you would give up control over Jack's life.",
        "Carly: I do not control Jack.",
        "Janet: Are you just figuring that out?",
        "Carly: This is my home. And I'm not going to let Jack risk that so you can play house with my children.",
        "Janet: That's my point, Carly, I'm not playing here. I am Jack's wife. And the sooner you accept that, the better.",
        "Carly: Oh, you really are tiresome.",
        "Jack: What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What's going on over there?",
        "Josie: Margo and Craig are just hanging out waiting for Lucy to show. Margo's going to arrest her. I don't think she wants to, but with Craig pressing charges, she doesn't have much of a choice.",
        "Dusty: I was afraid of that. So, listen, I need another favor from you.",
        "Josie: You are really going to owe me when this is over, Donovan.",
        "Dusty: I don't think so.",
        "Josie: Okay, just tell me what you need.",
        "Dusty: Lucy's going to leave town. But she needs to see Johnny first.",
        "Josie: That's a bad idea. Margo and Craig are watching this room like hawks.",
        "Dusty: Get them out of there.",
        "Josie: How?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. Think of something creative. It's the only way Lucy's going to leave town.",
        "Josie: Okay, I'll do it. But after this, we are even.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, how are you feeling?",
        "Katie: Like they stuck a giant syringe in my hip and sucked out my bone marrow.",
        "Margo: You got to stop giving away body parts. And you got to tell me these things. What if something had happened to you in the operating room?",
        "Katie: They didn't even put me all the way out.",
        "Margo: I know, Honey. But I need to know about these things.",
        "Katie: As a sister or as a police officer?",
        "Margo: Craig wants me to arrest Lucy for kidnapping.",
        "Katie: She was right, I shouldn't have told him that Johnny was here. But that's his son. I figured it was the right thing to do.",
        "Margo: It is. I agree. I mean, if you knew something about Adam --",
        "Katie: The point is, I begged Craig to keep this a family matter and not turn it into a police investigation.",
        "Margo: I'm family.",
        "Katie: I love you, Margo, but I know how you think. You're going to have to throw Lucy in jail. You don't bend the rules, even for family members.",
        "Margo: I don't have a choice. If I make an exception for Lucy, then every decision I make at my job from now on is going to be a toss-up.",
        "Katie: I just hope you can live with yourself afterwards.",
        "Craig: Margo.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Craig: Could you come out here for a minute?",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, Honey. What? What is it? What?",
        "Craig: I found this one lurking outside Johnny's room.",
        "Josie: Would you let go of me?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Margo: Craig, get your hands off her.",
        "Craig: No, she's tight with Dusty.",
        "Josie: Past tense.",
        "Craig: But I bet you'd like to get back on his good side, wouldn't you, sweetheart?",
        "Josie: Shouldn't you get back to the psych ward?",
        "Craig: You're here for a reason. And I bet Dusty's behind it.",
        "Margo: Do you know where Dusty is? Or Lucy?",
        "Josie: As a matter of fact, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Janet, why don't you let me handle this, please?",
        "Janet: No, Jack, please, this is between Carly and me, okay? All these digs about me being selfish, or jealous, or being extravagant with my husband's money -- its bologna. Carly, you don't even know me. And you haven't bothered to get to know me, because I'm the enemy who's taking Jack away from you.",
        "Carly: This is ridiculous.",
        "Janet: The truth is, you two have been over for a long time. Hell, you guys were over way before I even came into town.",
        "Jack: She knows that. She doesn't mean any harm.",
        "Carly: I just need a little cash, Jack, so I can get Metro back on track.",
        "Jack: And what about the kids, Carly?",
        "Carly: What about them?",
        "Jack: Who's to say if you get this loan and you sink it all into Metro, that you won't lose that, too? Where will your family be then?",
        "Carly: You're being dramatic.",
        "Jack: No, I'm not. I'm just asking you to make a decision, that's all. A fair decision. What do you want more? Do you want to keep your family safe, or do you want to keep me and Janet from starting a life together?",
        "Carly: Fine. I give up. I'll find the money someplace else.",
        "Jack: And what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Carly: It means, Jack, you win. If you can get a bank to loan you that money, then go for it. Buy your dream house, Jack, live your dream life.",
        "Janet: Thank you, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Lucy? Dusty? Oakdale P.D. come out where I can see you. Craig, what are you doing here? I told you to wait in the car?",
        "Craig: I would have. If I trusted you.",
        "Margo: Check the back.",
        "Craig: That's Lucy's. They were here.",
        "Margo: The question is, where are they now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: Okay, the coast is clear. Craig and Margo went to look for you at the warehouse, but they'll be back soon.",
        "Dusty: Go ahead. Johnny's waiting.",
        "Lucy: Thanks. Hi! You look so good! I'm just gone a couple of hours and you're already feeling better, huh? That was sneaky of you. Does it hurt a lot? Look how rosy your cheeks are. You're going to be better, Sweetie. I'm absolutely, positively sure about it. You have to listen to what the doctors and nurses tell you, okay? And I want you to listen to what Dusty tells you, too, okay? Can you promise me that? Okay, 'cause -- I'm going to leave for just a little while. But I'll be thinking about you the whole time. And I promise I'll come back and see you as soon as I can, okay?",
        "Johnny: But I want you to stay.",
        "Lucy: I wish I could. But I have to go do some grown-up things first. But I won't be very far. I'll be right here. And you're going to be right in here, okay? With me. And you're gonna get a new daddy, and a grandma, and aunts and uncles -- you're going to meet so many new people, and they're going to fall in love with you just the same way I did.",
        "Johnny: But it won't be the same.",
        "Lucy: No, maybe it won't be. But it'll be just as good. I mean, you're going to be safe now, Johnny. Nothing bad is ever going to happen to you again. You're going to be happy. I love you. Come here. I'll be there in a second. I'm going to come back for you. I promise you that too, okay? Bye.",
        "Dusty: The jet's waiting for you at the airport.",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: You have to go before Craig and Margo catch on. It's okay. It won't be forever.",
        "Lucy: You keep him safe!",
        "Dusty: I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Henry, what are you doing?",
        "Henry: Just a little cross-promotional marketing. Don't worry. I'll cut you in.",
        "Carly: You oughta. You've been neglecting this place for weeks, you know? And don't get me wrong, I'm happy about your book, but you went AWOL in me and I'm not happy about it.",
        "Henry: Well, I'm here now.",
        "Carly: Well, good. Then stop marketing yourself and help me figure out a way to get some behinds on these empty barstools. Market this.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay. I'm sensing a little hostility in here.",
        "Carly: No, no, I'm sorry. I'm not hostile. I'm not. I'm desperate. Do you have any money, Henry? Because I'm tapped out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You sent us to a dead end and you knew it.",
        "Josie: No, I didn't. Dusty just came back --",
        "Margo: Where's Lucy?",
        "Dusty: She's gone.",
        "Margo: Gone as in --",
        "Dusty: She didn't like the idea of going to prison for doing the right thing.",
        "Craig: That's a liberal interpretation of the law.",
        "Margo: Oh, shut up, Craig.",
        "Craig: You're not going to let her get away with this, are you?",
        "Margo: Just zip it. We have to find the girl to do anything. Will you let me do my work?",
        "Craig: Well, she couldn't have gone far. And if you think you're going to steal Johnny away just to run off and be with her --",
        "Dusty: I'm not going anywhere, and neither is Johnny. Lucy's saved his life by bringing him back here. And she risked her freedom to do it.",
        "Margo: And you true to form called out the dogs without a second thought.",
        "Craig: I want my son with me. It's my right.",
        "Josie: It's not a property dispute.",
        "Margo: I couldn't agree more.",
        "Dusty: I think Johnny deserves better from us.",
        "Craig: I won't argue with that.",
        "Dusty: Lucy refused to leave until I promised her I'd find a way to make peace with you. For the sake of your son.",
        "Craig: At least you admit he's my son. And by the way, I made Lucy the same promise before she betrayed me.",
        "Dusty: She did no such thing.",
        "Craig: I heard you two planning to take him away as soon as he was well enough. I wasn't about to let that happen.",
        "Dusty: Lucy's gone. It's up to us to settle this. Fairly and legally.",
        "Craig: Well, legally, you and your sidekick aided and abetted a kidnapper. I could have you both arrested and just be done with it.",
        "Margo: You could do that. You could. And then you would have everyone, including your son hate you for the rest of your life.",
        "Craig: Well, old habits die hard. Go ahead, Margo. Arrest them.",
        "Katie: Please don't do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I have a sneaking suspicion that our dream home is right here in these newspapers. Whoo!",
        "Jack: I don't know, Janet.",
        "Janet: What? Come on, now. Are you getting cold feet?",
        "Jack: No, it's not --",
        "Janet: I've got the perfect cure for that. It's called a wood burning fireplace. In real estate terms that's \"WBF -- P?\" Sweetie, what's wrong?",
        "Jack: I took all the money. I left Carly high and dry.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on, Baby. Snap out of it!",
        "Jack: If she loses Metro --",
        "Janet: That's not our problem, Jack. Come on. Take \"Yes\" for an answer, will you? Look, you were right about Carly's business. Even if she did get the extra money, it could go under, then she'd lose the house, and then where would we be? We'd be broke. And that's bad business.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that doesn't make it easier.",
        "Janet: There's another part to this, Jack. Let me finish. We are drawing a line in the sand here.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Janet: Carly's been running your life for a long time now. And this money thing is just more a part of that. And we can't let that happen anymore. I think we should celebrate.",
        "Jack: By doing what?",
        "Janet: Well, we still have the house all to ourselves. Did you ever see the movie, \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\"?",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: On Emma's kitchen table?",
        "Janet: If anybody finds out about it, I'm going to deny it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Listen, I hope the book makes money, but I still got to earn back the advance and then, those agency fees, lots of other expenses, and -- Carly, I might not see a dime for six months.",
        "Carly: Well, we need money, now -- or we're going to have to shut this place down.",
        "Henry: That's it, then. Damn. You know, I really -- I love this place, I do. But, Vienna and I still have Al's, and I've already got the second book in my head, so, I'll get over it.",
        "Carly: Well, good for you. But I got nothing else. I have to keep this place open.",
        "Henry: Then fight for it, Carly.",
        "Carly: How? There's no bank that's going to give me any money. I'm completely out of options here.",
        "Henry: Well, you could always get yourself a sugar daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Johnny's still very sick. And judging by the way my hip hurts now, he's got to be in pain, too. And scared. He's in an unfamiliar place, he doesn't feel good, he barely knows who any of us are. Do you really think you're helping things by making accusations and filing charges?",
        "Craig: So, you'd rather Dusty spirit him off someplace where we'd never see him again?",
        "Katie: He won't do that. He promised Lucy, and I believe him. I'm sorry that I broke my word by telling Craig where Johnny was, but it was the right thing to do. We've all done things we're not proud of in the name of loving that little boy. And it has got to stop, before he gets hurt anymore. Because we all really do just love him.",
        "Margo: Craig?",
        "Katie: Please, don't make me regret telling you that Johnny was here.",
        "Dusty: I'm willing to drop it, if you are.",
        "Craig: You broke the law.",
        "Margo: Come on, come on. No charges have been filed. So, if the two are willing to kiss and make up, I'm willing to walk away.",
        "Dusty: I'm going to check on Johnny.",
        "Margo: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's get you back to bed. Okay, come on, Joan of Arc.",
        "Johnny: Mommy!",
        "Dusty: Josie's not your mommy, remember? But she does look like her, doesn't she? Let me show you something. This is your mommy. Her name is Jennifer. Josie is our good friend. That's who she is.",
        "[Katie groans]",
        "Margo: You just rest. You did a wonderful thing, today.",
        "Katie: I hope you mean it. No more wars with Dusty.",
        "Margo: I'm going to hold you to your word. If this thing escalates into anything, I am going to be all over you.",
        "Craig: What makes you think I'll be the one doing the escalating?",
        "Katie: You're kidding, right?",
        "Craig: All I want is what's best for my son. But make no mistake -- he is my son. And I will never let anyone take him from me again.",

        "Noah: It's over, Ali. There's no way we're getting back from this.",
        "Luke: Come on, guys. This isn't funny.",
        "Noah: Let us back in there, damn it!",
        "Alison: As soon as the two of you make up!",
        "Holden: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: I was about to ask you the same question. I hate to think that he and Carly kicked me out earlier for some ulterior motive.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about?",
        "Craig: Oh, Dear. Did I say the wrong thing?"
