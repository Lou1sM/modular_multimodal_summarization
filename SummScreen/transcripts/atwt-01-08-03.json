        "Dr. Michaels: Not yet.",
        "Alison: So what's the deal? Are you gonna hypnotize him or something?",
        "Dr. Michaels: Will's just being admitted for evaluation, and that's all \r\nI'm at liberty to discuss right now.",
        "Alison: But he still doesn't remember starting the fire. So do you have \r\nsome sort of truth serum or something?",
        "Dr. Michaels: You seem very concerned about Will's care.",
        "Alison: Sure I am. He's a great kid. And he's practically my little \r\nbrother. And in my family, \"practically\" counts.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Good morning, Will.",

        "Will: Hi.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Will, I have a question for you, before we get started. \r\nDo you understand why you're here?",
        "Will: Yeah. Me and my dad talked about it. But do I have to stay here \r\nthe whole 30 days?",
        "Dr. Michaels: You know, I can't answer that right now. But first, one \r\nof the things --",

        "Dr. Michaels: Hi, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: So, where's Emily?",
        "Hal: She thought it would be easier if you and I handled things \r\ntogether this morning.",
        "Barbara: Really?",
        "Dr. Michaels: I was just about to explain to Will that we have a lot of \r\nforms to fill out before he can get settled in his room. So I'm gonna need you \r\nto spend some time with me at the admissions office. Shall we?",
        "Alison: Good luck.",
        "Aaron: Why'd you do it, Alison?! Huh? How could you do a thing like \r\nthat?",

        "Craig: Hey. You keep going like this, you're gonna be ready for the \r\nOlympics someday, right?",
        "Dr. Engler: She's really coming along, Mr. Montgomery. We'll do another \r\nsession this afternoon, okay?",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Craig: Thanks, doc. Now look at that smile. See, you must be releasing \r\nall these endorphins.",
        "Lucy: You're just comparing me to yesterday. Not my best day, I'll \r\nadmit.",
        "Craig: Come on, you're entitled.",
        "Lucy: Maybe. There were a lot of things I wish I hadn't said, though.",
        "Craig: Like what?",
        "Lucy: I was doing a lot of thinking about the way I acted yesterday \r\nwith Aaron. I mean, he was only trying to help, dad.",
        "Craig: Has he come back?",
        "Lucy: No. I don't blame him. I was so busy feeling sorry for myself, I \r\ndidn't thank him for being so sweet and supportive.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm sure he understands.",
        "Lucy: I hope so.",
        "Craig: Lullaby, this is a very delicate time in your recovery. And I'm \r\ngrateful to Aaron for all his help and all, but sometimes I wonder, um -- no, \r\nnever mind.",
        "Lucy: No, what is it?",
        "Craig: Well, I -- I just sometimes think if all this attention doesn't \r\nhave more to do with his own agenda than helping you.",

        "[Doorbell rings] I gotta go. Hi.",
        "Margo: Hi. Listen -- I got the forensics report on the baby. I also got \r\na fax from flagstaff and -- I just didn't want to do this over the phone.",
        "Jack: Any news?",
        "Margo: Yeah. I'm really sorry, Jack. It's a perfect match. The \r\nfootprint of the missing baby and J. J.'s -- they match. And I had the guys at \r\nthe lab run it three times.",
        "Jack: No, there's no mistake. I guess I thought -- I don't know what I \r\nthought. I'll pack up his things. And you can tell your people on the other end \r\nwe should have everything ready to go in a couple hours.",
        "Margo: Jack -- the parents are already in the air. I mean, they're on \r\ntheir way here.",

        "Margo: They should be landing soon.",
        "Jack: -- Some time.",
        "Margo: Jack, I'm sorry. They got a judge to order a court order -- \r\nimmediate compliance, Jack. They really want to pick up their son as soon as \r\npossible. We should leave for the airport now.",
        "Jack: Hey, buddy. You're going on a long trip today. You know that?",
        "Margo: Jack, the Chronisters are gonna land in, I don't know, about an \r\nhour or so. The court order stipulates that there be an independent third party. \r\nThat would be me. You know, I'll follow you guys to the airport. For right now, \r\nI'm just gonna wait outside while you guys have a moment.",
        "Jack: Thanks, Margo.",

        "Aaron: So I kept asking myself, \"well, how? How did it happen?\" And \r\nthen I realized the answer was staring me in the face. It was you!",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: No, no, sorry's not gonna cut it.",
        "Alison: It just got so out of control. It was an accident.",
        "Aaron: An accident?",
        "Alison: You gotta believe me.",
        "Aaron: So it just slipped out? How could telling Lucy's father \r\nsomething like that just be an accident?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Aaron: Montgomery knows that Lucy and I slept together. And he made it \r\nvery obvious to me. Now did you tell him or didn't you?",
        "Alison: No, no. I didn't.",
        "Aaron: So what are you so sorry about, then?",

        "Alison: I don't know. Um -- she was just upset yesterday. And I was \r\njust trying to make her feel better. You know how I am. I -- I thought maybe I \r\nsaid the wrong thing.",
        "Aaron: No, no, no. Okay, whatever the wrong thing was, you told her \r\nfather. Okay, the guy kept asking me questions about the road trip, where we \r\ncrashed. Then he was zeroing in on the barn. Okay, that was kinda weird, okay? \r\nBecause he doesn't know anything about it. But he did. And you're the only one \r\nthat could've told him.",
        "Alison: No, I didn't. I swear.",

        "Alison: Yeah, I talked to him, but --",
        "Aaron: What did you say?",
        "Alison: The truth, that we all got along great. I mean -- except for \r\nthat one night that we got into the fight. And I stormed off, and you guys \r\nstayed in the barn.",
        "Aaron: The barn. Mm-hmm. Alison --",
        "Alison: Well, it's not like I said, \"guess what, Mr. Montgomery? Lucy \r\nand Aaron had sex.\" He obviously has a one-track mind.",
        "Aaron: Well, you should've known the conclusion he would jump to.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I just wasn't thinking that way.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, that's right. It's never your fault.",
        "Alison: I don't deserve this, Aaron. I've gone all out for you and \r\nLucy. I mean, can't you just cut me a break? I'm not the enemy.",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry. It's just -- Lucy kinda freaked about me seeing her \r\nin the wheelchair. Okay? And now she doesn't want to see me. If her father gets \r\non my case, he's gonna fix it where I'll never see her again.",

        "Craig: Well, I think it's up to you to decide and remember what Aaron \r\nreally means to you. But right now, we have to concentrate on your physical \r\nhealth.",

        "Craig: Then we make new memories.",
        "Lucy: Isn't that like living half your life?",
        "Craig: Baby, listen, you were on the road for such a long time. You \r\nwere running from the law. You were desperate. That had to have been scary. And \r\nvery hard to relive.",
        "Lucy: That could be why I get such a strange feeling about Alison. I \r\nmean, Aaron says we were friends, but something --",
        "Craig: See? There, you just said it. \"Aaron says.\" Now, it is not up to \r\nAaron or anybody else to tell you who you are to other people. That's for you to \r\ndiscover. All right? And until that point, I want you to work on setting a new \r\nrecord. Hmm?",

        "Rosanna: You're here to give me a list of rules for my behavior?",
        "Sierra: I'm not here to antagonize you. My only concern is Lucy's \r\nrecovery. You don't know me very well, Rosanna. But I have never been a jealous \r\nwoman. I'm not saying that Craig ever played the faithful husband. But no matter \r\nwhere he slept, his heart always remained at home.",
        "Rosanna: You didn't mind the affairs?",
        "Sierra: I hated them. They were torture. But I always knew he loved me. \r\nAnd he would die for me or my children. And even after our divorce, when he \r\nturned to someone, he always turned to me. Until now, at least.",
        "Rosanna: What's changed?",
        "Sierra: If what I heard was true, everything. I was outside your door \r\nyesterday.",
        "Rosanna: You eavesdropped?",
        "Sierra: Yes, I'm embarrassed to admit it. But in those few minutes, I \r\nheard Craig give you his heart. And he offered you comfort and solace and -- \r\neven friendship. And if I hadn't heard it with my own ears, I never would have \r\nbelieved it.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Craig always means what he says when he says it.",
        "Sierra: No, I think this is different.",
        "Rosanna: How -- how can you be sure?",
        "Sierra: Because I heard those same words to me a long time ago.",
        "Rosanna: What do you want from me, Sierra?",
        "Sierra: A truce.",
        "Rosanna: I'm hardly in a position to declare war.",
        "Sierra: Up until now, you have seen Lucy as a rival for Craig's \r\naffection. You have been selfish and calculating, with no regard to my \r\ndaughter's happiness. I am going to Montega today. But I will not step foot out \r\nof this hospital unless I know that you are capable of being the woman that I \r\nwant around my daughter.",

        "Rosanna: Well, of course. I mean, I have no problem with that. I'm \r\ncertainly willing to try, if she will. I'm willing to show her respect, as long \r\nas I get the same in return.",

You work magic. You do. No matter how tough my \r\nday would be, when everything was going wrong, I'd just look at your face -- I'd \r\nhave to smile. I felt better just being around you. And most of the times, you'd \r\nlook up at me and smile back. Just like you did when Mr. Panda gave you his \r\nspecial kisses. You taught me something I'll never forget, buddy. That no matter \r\nhow full you think your heart is, a little man comes along and makes it \r\noverflow. And these people -- the Chronisters, your mom and dad, I know they'll \r\nfeel it, too.
