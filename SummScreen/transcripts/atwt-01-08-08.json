        "Noah asks Luke to move in with him and Luke hesitates at first because he thinks Noah is still trying to prove something to his father even though his father is in prison. Noah later admits that he doesn't want to live in the dorms because he feels lonely because he doesn't have any friends. Noah tells Luke he enjoyed the farm because he felt part of a real family for the first time. Luke persuades Emma to allow Noah to move into the farm permanently and Noah is very happy because he will be with Luke and have a real family. Lily loses her cool in front of Natalie and Faith when she finds Bonnie watching TV with Holden and the girls. Holden tells Lily he is worried about her, and he has reason to be because Lily took pills earlier in the day. Dusty persuades Allison to keep an eye on Chris because he thinks Emily is in danger by being with him. Chris feels pressure from both an angry Dusty and Evan Walsh who pressures him to have a cocktail party to announce the research project to the press. The man Dusty hired to test Bob's coffee cup found traces of an unknown substance but needs more time to run more tests. Emily begins to have doubts about Chris causing his father's stroke and although she doesn't admit it to Dusty he can see it in her eyes."

        "Luke: Five minutes. The doctor was running late as usual. I got your coffee.",
        "Noah: Thanks. It's freezing outside. What's that?",
        "Luke: Oh, Oakdale University course catalog. So, does introduction to eastern philosophy sound really interesting or really boring?",
        "Noah: You're going back to school?",
        "Luke: Yeah. My doctor signed off on it and my parents already paid the tuition, so it looks like that's a yes.",
        "Noah: That's great.",
        "Luke: Yeah, so now all I have to do is pick my courses and register for housing, and pray that I don't get stuck with some freak for a roommate.",
        "Noah: Um, you're going to live in the dorms?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Is there a problem with that?",
        "Noah: Yeah. I mean, I don't think that's the best place for you right now.",

        "Faith: You did not just say that, Natalie.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I think she's right. Every year, it seems like winter break gets just a little bit longer.",
        "Faith: No.",
        "Holden: Okay. I know what we can do to stretch it out. You girls can help me out with the farm chores. What do you say to that?",
        "Faith: Dad, that's not fair. We're on vacation. [Knock on the door] I'll get that.",
        "Bonnie: Hey, Faith. Am I interrupting breakfast?",
        "Holden: No, no, we were just finishing up. Come on in.",
        "Bonnie: Hey, thanks. I won't be long. But I heard you guys missed \"The Twilight Zone\" marathon on New Year's. And since I happen to own the entire series on DVD, I thought you guys might want to borrow it while you're still on vacation.",

        "Noah: No, fine. That's -- do what you want to do.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jump all over you. It's just, my mom has the exact same issues and she's just --",

        "Luke: Well, obviously, it's not. Because you're sitting there all quiet.",

        "Lily: Oh, I know --",
        "Lucinda: But whatever it was you two thought you were doing together --",
        "Lily: Whatever we were doing together, I'd like to forget the entire thing. And I'd like you to not gloat, please. I can't take it from you today, please.",

        "Emily: Love means never having to say I need more closet space.",
        "Chris: Uh, no, no, no, no. I disagree. I need more closet space and so do you. I think those shoes of yours are cloning themselves when we sleep.",
        "Emily: What? I just hit a few after Christmas sales.",
        "Chris: A few, yeah.",
        "Emily: I like shoes, okay? If you have a problem with our living arrangement, then maybe we should talk about --",
        "Chris: No, no, no. Hey, it's just -- the holidays are over, I think it's time we start getting serious about finding a place again. I mean, we were ready to go a couple a months ago, what are you waiting for --",

        "Dusty: Got anything off that coffee cup?",
        "Private investigator: You were right. I did find some kind of foreign substance, but it's nothing I've ever run across before. I'm going to have to make some calls.",
        "Dusty: How hard can it be? There are only so many drugs out there.",
        "Private investigator: I'm not the physician's desk reference. Come on, all I can tell you so far is whoever had the cup, he was drinking a lot more than milk and sugar in his coffee. But you want solid proof of poisoning, it's going to take a little time.",
        "Dusty: How much time are we talking about?",
        "Private investigator: It would be faster if you had a tox-screen run on the victim.",
        "Dusty: No, no, he's -- he's at the hospital. He's out of commission.",
        "Private investigator: Maybe they ran a panel when he was admitted. If you get your hands on his labs, that would narrow the field.",
        "Emily: What the hell are you doing? Who are you?",
        "Dusty: I'll be in touch, all right? Hi, Emily.",
        "Emily: Now you think Bob was poisoned? What -- have you lost your mind?",
        "Dusty: No, I'm following my reporter instincts. They're telling me there's a lot more to this story.",
        "Emily: Don't you dare print that in \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Dusty: I'm not planning to, not yet. I like to back up my stories with facts. Remember the concept?",

And you have no choice -- well, maybe things didn't work out last year or the year before -- your life the way you planned it -- you're not going under. You're not, even though it might seem preferable sometimes to the alternative.",
        "Lily: Which is what?",
        "Lucinda: Which is living. Going through it. Get over to the other side. I know you can. I know you're too strong to do --",
        "Lily: I don't -- I don't feel strong right now.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, please -- then let me help. Oh, I'd do anything.",
        "Lily: Can you fix my marriage? Can you do that?",
        "Lucinda: Baby, Holden can't be bought. We both know that. And that's one of his more admirable qualities.",

        "Lily: That's nice of you to say about him.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I guess I resurrected any compassion now that I -- that I know he's not going to ruin your life.",

        "Lucinda: You've got four spectacular children.",
        "Lily: I know --",

        "Lily: I love you, too.",
        "Lucinda: Come on. Come with me now.",

        "Holden: How did you get them all the same size? That's cheating.",
        "Bonnie: Uh-huh, funny. But what I want to know is why the great Emma Snyder has a roll of store-bought cookies in her crisper.",
        "Holden: Well, it's from when she was away last time. Brad brought a couple of rolls, he ate one of them and that was the one he left.",
        "Bonnie: Well, thank you, Brad for saving my butt with your girls. I mean, they don't teach baking from scratch in law school, right?",
        "Holden: Are you ready?",
        "Bonnie: Mmm, that's delicious. Are you ready to enter \"The Twilight Zone\"?",
        "Holden: After you. Bonnie?",
        "Bonnie: I forgot the milk. What am I thinking?",
        "Holden: No, no, I just wanted to say, um, it's been a long time since the girls and I just hung out and had fun. This means a lot. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You know, Vienna isn't here, which means, if you want, you can order bacon and sausage.",
        "Luke: What is she -- the nutrition police?",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, apparently, things with Swedish names are exempt.",
        "Luke: How's Maddie?",
        "Henry: She's -- she's great. She's great. She loves school. She made the dean's list, by the way. Yeah, I think she's finished half of her required reading for the semester already.",
        "Noah: I don't doubt it. So, did you hear what I said before?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Noah: Well?",
        "Luke: Well, um, you asked me to move in. Uh, that's -- that's kind of the last thing I expected to hear out of you.",
        "Noah: Why? I mean, don't you want that?",
        "Luke: No, I do want to spend time with you. I do. Um, maybe we could -- could be roommates in the dorm?",
        "Noah: I don't want to just be a roommate. That's not what I was thinking.",
        "Luke: Why, are you afraid of what people might say?",
        "Noah: You mean, that we're gay? No. God, give me some credit, Luke. I mean, I want to be more than your roommate. I want us to have an apartment together. You know, a real life. Be a couple. But if that's not what you want --",
        "Luke: No, it is -- I want to spend time with you. More and more every day. That's not the issue.",
        "Noah: Then what is?",
        "Luke: Well, I'm still in physical therapy, and I'm not 100%.",
        "Noah: What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Luke: We were talking about -- about taking things slow. You know? And if we live together --",
        "Noah: There'd be nothing holding us back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Chris didn't poison his father, Dusty. Bob had a stroke.",
        "Dusty: What brought it on?",
        "Emily: I don't know. It could have been a million things. Bob's not a young man. There's no conspiracy here.",
        "Dusty: We'll see. After the evidence is analyzed.",
        "Emily: So you're just guessing at this point.",
        "Dusty: Well, I won't have to, except your boyfriend is covering Bob's door 24/7. Isn't that suspicious?",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? It would be if you weren't running like a crazy person, blaming Chris for everything from Bob's stroke to global warming.",
        "Dusty: I bet Chris drives a hybrid. Am I right?",
        "Emily: Oh, cut it out, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Huh? Doesn't have the space my car has --",
        "Emily: Yeah, that would be the first mistake of my new year.",
        "Dusty: No, I'd say it was a step in the right direction.",
        "Emily: You've got this vendetta against Chris and it's eating you alive.",
        "Dusty: If I'm wrong, it's a vendetta. If I'm right, I'm right. Your boyfriend's dangerous.",
        "Emily: And you're an idiot for making accusations that could hurt a lot of people.",
        "Dusty: I'm just trying to make sure no one else gets hurt. Like Bob did.",
        "Emily: Chris is not responsible for what happened to Bob.",
        "Chris: It's all right, Emily, I can defend myself. Lay it on me, Donovan. What crime have I committed now?",
        "Chris: Now that I'm here, you suddenly have nothing to say.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I've got plenty.",
        "Emily: Dusty claims Bob was poisoned. Or given a drug or -- what exactly was he given, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: You're a piece of work.",
        "Chris: Are you talking about my father? You think I poisoned him? I love that man. I would never hurt him.",
        "Dusty: Love's a funny thing, you know? It can be double-edged.",
        "Chris: How dare you?",
        "Dusty: Don't dare a guy, Buddy.",
        "Chris: The problem is, you're not only thinking this garbage, you're telling people. That's slander.",
        "Emily: Dusty claims he has proof.",

        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Holden: Oh, hey.",
        "Lily: Hey, is this a bad time?",
        "Holden: Uh, no. I just -- wasn't expecting you.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm -- I should have called first. But then I would have lost my nerve.",
        "Holden: About what?",
        "Lily: Uh, okay, I know -- winter break is almost done and I thought maybe the -- what is this? This is blasphemy, by the way.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: This is store-bought cookies in Emma's kitchen. What is up with that?",
        "Bonnie: Hey, bartender whatever happened to those sodas? We're about to start -- oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize he had company.",
        "Lily: Company? This isn't company. This is my family. You couldn't wait until the ink was dry on the divorce papers?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: And this one has a dishwasher and a washer and a dryer.",
        "Luke: Ooh, how romantic.",
        "Noah: It is, when you spend your formative years in the Laundromat of an Army base. Every time I see a roll of quarters, I break out in hives.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Luke: There is so much about you I don't know.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, we've got time. So, should I circle this one?",
        "Luke: See, now I hate to do dishes, yes. So how many is that?",
        "Noah: That is five. You know, I'm going to go make some calls. Maybe we can see some of these places today.",
        "Luke: Uh, oh, no, don't worry about it. I got it. You can get the next one.",
        "Noah: Cool.",
        "Henry: Hey, you must have liked it. You know -- you know Maddie asks about you every time she calls. She's going to be so happy to know that you stopped by.",
        "Luke: Is it weird for you to see me and Noah together?",
        "Henry: No. No, you're both good guys. Maddie's got it over you on the pretty department. But hey, what are you going to do? Anyway, the bottom line is she's okay with what happened. Which means, I'm okay with what happened.",
        "Luke: So, you weren't trying to poison me with your pork products --",
        "Henry: No, Vienna would beg to differ. But no, I wasn't. I wasn't. Um, and an effort at a full disclosure though, I did overhear you and Noah, when he asked you to move in.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. I mean, that was kind of out of the blue -- you know, we've been -- we've been through so much together and it just kind of feels like the next logical step.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, love is never logic.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, it is pretty crazy, but it seems like a good thing.",
        "Henry: Can I give you some completely unsolicited advice from the brother of the ex-girlfriend of your significant other?",
        "Luke: Sure.",
        "Henry: Don't do it. Don't move in with Noah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Is this how you operate? Taking advantage of your clients when they're most vulnerable?",
        "Bonnie: No, I am here as Holden's --",
        "Lily: What, his attorney? Apparently not.",
        "Holden: Lily, stop.",
        "Lily: You said you wanted a quickie divorce. A quickie divorce. Is it because of Bonnie? Because you want to get your hooks into him?",
        "Holden: Lily, you are out of line.",
        "Lily: You think I like to come here and see your so-called lawyer trying to steal my family right out from under me?",
        "Bonnie: Okay, girls, why don't we go back and start the next DVD, all right?",
        "Lily: Don't you dare -- don't you dare tell my daughters what to do!",
        "Holden: All right. That's enough.",
        "Lily: I want you to get out of this house! I want you to get out of this house right now!",
        "Bonnie: Holden, I'm --",
        "Holden: Bonnie, Bonnie -- stay. I will handle this.",
        "Lily: How are you going to handle it, Holden? What are you going to do?",
        "Holden: Outside, Lily, let's go. Now. Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I thought you were okay with me and Noah being together.",
        "Henry: Oh, I am. I am. It is not that, okay? It's that -- you're just so young and you're a freshman in college and you should be living in the dorms with everyone else. You should be hanging out with your friends in the common room all night. Eating bad cafeteria food, extolling on the value of the mystery meat and things like that. It's all a part of the grand experience.",
        "Luke: Well, you know, that sounds kind of like living at the farm. Except for the mystery meat.",
        "Henry: It's -- it's the honeymoon before you're really an adult. Look, if you get this apartment, then you've got to worry about electric bills, and buying groceries, and cooking for yourself. And --",
        "Luke: Well, you know what? No, no, no, that's fine. We just come eat here.",
        "Henry: Luke, I'm not old-fashioned, okay? I'm far from it. I'm just -- I'm used to giving advice to my kid sister and I kind of miss it. So, please forgive me if I overstep my bounds here.",
        "Luke: No, no, no. It's completely fine, Henry. Say what's on your mind.",
        "Henry: All right. What you were talking about with Noah -- it's true, you guys have been through some heavy duty stuff. You've had to deal with a lot. And you've got through it. I think it would be great to go back just being college kids for a little while, you know. Be young. Enjoy yourself. Some things you shouldn't rush.",
        "Luke: Look, is that what you did? Enjoyed your youth?",
        "Henry: As a matter of speaking, yeah, I did. I -- under the given circumstances, I wouldn't recommend anyone following my example whatsoever. But, yeah, I mostly definitely lived. And my point is, I would hate for you and Noah to look back in your lives one day and feel like you missed out on something great.",
        "Luke: But -- but Noah is great. And living it with him would be great.",
        "Henry: Yeah, totally would, and you've got so much time for that. You really do. But you don't want to miss out on the courtship part. I'm not saying don't be together, but the courtship part -- the memory of that, will get you through when time's get rough. And they always will, eventually. I don't want to be Debbie Downer here or anything like that --",
        "Luke: No, no, no, no. It's great. It's great -- I mean, I'm hearing everything you're saying. Thanks.",
        "Henry: Sure. All right. No charge for the advice.",
        "Luke: Yes.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, that's good. That's good. That's good.",
        "Noah: You ready to go look at apartments?",

        "Chris: The only way this jerk has proof I did something to my father is if he made it up himself.",

        "Chris: There you go, Em, he's got nothing.",
        "Emily: No. He was actually talking to someone before.",
        "Chris: No, he's just playing games with us, aren't you? Making it up as you go along.",
        "Dusty: Oh, no, no. I'm on to you. You just don't want to admit it in front of your girlfriend.",
        "Chris: Why don't you just call my bluff then? Do it. Take your so-called evidence to the police.",
        "Dusty: I'm not ready to go to the cops.",
        "Chris: Because they'd laugh you right out of the station.",
        "Dusty: No. Because I'm doing this my way.",
        "Emily: Just don't let him get to you, okay? He's trying to goad you into a fight and the next thing you know, the board is trying to vote you out, and he'll sue you for assault.",
        "Dusty: That's not my style. You know that.",
        "Emily: You're a bully, you know that? You get off on intimidating --",
        "Chris: No, no, I don't scare that easily. Let me know when you find something.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I've got you on speed dial. Keep your phone on.",
        "Evan: Chris, hey, man, I'm glad I tracked you down.",
        "Chris: I'm sorry, Evan. It's not a good time. Emily and I are in the middle of something, okay?",
        "Evan: Hey, so are we. I thought you were on board with my research project?",
        "Chris: I got you into Memorial.",
        "Evan: Yeah, that was phase one. Now, it's time to go public. Dude, I can't do my research under the cover of darkness. We need to get the word out about what we've been doing.",

        "Lily: Why did you drag me out here? To protect your husband-stealing girlfriend?",
        "Holden: To keep you from making a fool of yourself.",
        "Lily: Excuse me?",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm not going to let you fly off the handle like that in front of the kids.",
        "Lily: You don't think that those kids know what's going on?",
        "Holden: They know what they know. The ins and outs of our relationship, too much information. If you got a problem with the divorce, you should have come to me.",
        "Lily: Bonnie shouldn't be there in that house with our children. She should not be here --",
        "Holden: You misunderstood the situation. Bonnie -- she's has never encouraged me to leave you --",
        "Lily: Okay, what was that little domestic scene I saw in there? Marriage counseling?",
        "Holden: Let's talk about how you dragged our kids into the middle of this, by yelling like that in front of that.",
        "Lily: I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. It was already out of my mouth before I realized what I was saying.",
        "Holden: Oh, so it was more important for you to tell off Bonnie, who didn't deserve it, than to worry about what it might do our kids.",
        "Lily: I -- I just lost it. For a minute. I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: It doesn't matter that you didn't mean it. You hurt them. And even if it never happens again, they will remember that for the rest of their lives.",

        "Noah: That last place we looked at was awesome. I mean, it's walking distance from the campus. I'd have to drive you back and forth, until you ditch your cane. But -- are you okay? Did you not like the last place?",
        "Luke: No, it was okay. I was just thinking about something Henry said to me.",
        "Noah: What?",
        "Luke: That maybe we were rushing into things.",
        "Noah: You talked to Henry about us? Why? I mean, are you having second thought about us?",
        "Luke: No, no, I'm not at all. It's just this whole signing a lease thing --",
        "Noah: Because you think we'll break up?",
        "Luke: No. No, I don't think that. And I don't want that to happen. I want to give us the best shot possible.",
        "Noah: Living together would do that.",
        "Luke: But that's why I'm thinking about the dorm. It's the perfect situation for us. We'll still be living together.",
        "Noah: Living together -- it will be amazing. Okay, you'll see, you're just nervous.",
        "Luke: Why aren't you?",
        "Noah: I am. But it will be great. You know, we'll be together all the time.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, same with the dorm.",
        "Noah: Yeah, with like 1,000 other people. I want to be alone with you.",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, that's why they invented doors. Okay. Here's the deal. You did the exact same thing with Maddie.",
        "Noah: No way.",
        "Luke: No, it's true. You guys were dating, and then all of a sudden, you're talking about living together. It's because you wanted to prove something to your father.",
        "Noah: My father's gone.",
        "Luke: Maybe. But you're still trying to prove something to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evan: Need to throw a cocktail party, okay? Invite all the usual suspects. Corporations that fund med research, pharmaceutical companies -- the hospital board can officially sign off on the partnership and we can show the entire world that we're in business.",
        "Chris: It's not the right time, Evan.",
        "Evan: Hey, we've got to strike when we're hot, man. Emily's article put us on the map. People are talking. You've got to show them the goods before we lose the --",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what, if nothing else, I'm impressed with the number of clich\u00e9s your little --",
        "Evan: Comes from a life of pitching. People almost know what you say, just how you say it.",
        "Chris: I've heard everything you said, okay? And I'm telling you the timing is wrong. The board is more concerned about my father's health right now.",
        "Evan: I thought you gave him Emily's article?",
        "Chris: I did.",
        "Evan: Then it's not new information! I didn't choose Memorial over Harvard so I keep my work under wraps. You promised me more than space, Chris. You said I'd have the full support of the institution. Now, if you can't make good, I can still go elsewhere.",
        "Chris: How many times are you going to threaten me with that?",
        "Evan: Sorry. Sorry. Look, I know you've gone to the maps on this, okay? I get that. But -- all the energy and hard work we've put into this project, it would mean nothing if nobody knows about it. I mean, publicity means more grant money, state-of-the-art tools, more impressive team.",
        "Chris: All right, all right, okay, okay -- we'll do some sort of press party.",
        "Evan: Fantastic. When?",
        "Chris: Call my assistant, set a date, we'll take it from there.",
        "Evan: Okay. Hey, it's all good, Chris. You'll see.",
        "Emily: You really think a cocktail party is a good idea right now?",
        "Chris: Why? Because my father's out of commission?",
        "Emily: Yeah, that combined with the fact that your father was against this from the very beginning. I mean, anyone who read my article knows that.",
        "Chris: So you think we should keep Evan on the down low?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I do. At least until things are settled.",
        "Chris: That's a pretty big 180, Emily. Dusty got to you, didn't he?",

        "Alison: And?",
        "Dusty: There's more to Bob's condition than people know.",
        "Alison: Based on what? Your medical expertise? I'm sorry -- I'm not really sure what you're getting at here.",
        "Dusty: Something caused Bob's stroke. And I think it originated with Chris.",
        "Alison: So you want me to spy on him for you?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Forget it.",
        "Dusty: I need your help. What's the problem, Ali?",
        "Alison: Well, I was almost married to Chris, for one thing. And my mom loves Bob, I love Bob. I was part of their family. There's no way Chris would ever -- could ever hurt his father.",
        "Dusty: Are you sure?",
        "Alison: Yes. 1,000%. Besides, this isn't about Chris. It's about Emily.",
        "Dusty: I've heard that before.",
        "Alison: What's it going to take to get you to admit that you're jealous?",
        "Dusty: I'm not.",
        "Alison: Okay, you're about the only person in this town who thinks that. Typical. You know, maybe if you weren't so shot down, you'd still be with Emily and none of this would have happened.",
        "Dusty: I'm doing this for your sister.",
        "Alison: Emily's fine.",
        "Dusty: Not if I'm right about Chris. You hear me? Now, listen, I don't want you mixed up in this. Bob already got hurt. Emily might be next.",
        "Alison: So, what, you're just going to ride to her rescue like you always do?",
        "Dusty: Should I let her crash and burn?",

        "Holden: I know. I want it to stop.",
        "Lily: Me, too. I just don't know how.",

        "Noah: I'm sorry, but what does my father have to do with us finding a place together?",
        "Luke: Think about it, Noah. When you were with Maddie, you were trying to prove to him that you weren't gay. Now, you're trying to show him who you are with a vengeance.",
        "Noah: No. No way.",
        "Luke: Then why are you so hooked up on this? I said we could live together. Why is it so important to get an apartment?",
        "Noah: Because I don't have anybody else. Okay, I don't have a home to go to over semester break. Or a family out there, rooting for me, sending me care packages. I've got you, Luke. And that's amazing, but it's also really scary. Because without you, I really am alone.",
        "Luke: No. No, you have tons of friends.",
        "Noah: Not like you do. You walk into a room and you're surrounded. You always attract these good people. Me, not so much.",
        "Luke: You're just shy. But everybody loves you.",
        "Noah: Luke, I don't like the dorms, okay? There are always people around, and I still felt lonely. But when I was with you at the farm, it felt so good. I felt like I was part of a family. And it was a little addictive. And I guess, I feel like I want to live with you because if we're together, I won't go back to feeling how I used to. Because I'll have a family. You. And I'll be a part of something.",

        "Lily: I -- I just wasn't feeling very well. And I have a horrible headache and I just lashed out at the first person that I saw. And I know, it's hard for you to understand that. But I am sorry. Can we just pretend that didn't happen and you can go back to having a nice evening with your father and his friend? Is that okay? Can you do that?",
        "Natalie: Okay, Mommy.",
        "Lily: You can do that? Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. I'll come by and see you tomorrow when I'm feeling better, okay?",
        "Natalie: Okay.",
        "Lily: And you can call me, please? Please don't forget to call me and we can plan on doing something together.",

        "Noah: Are you serious? Emma's okay with that?",
        "Luke: Yeah, she's all for it. She said that if you say yes, she'll ask Faith and Natalie to share a room.",

        "Noah: You'll bribe them?",
        "Luke: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And so will you. Every day for the rest of your life. But anyways, it'll be cheaper than paying rent.",
        "Noah: Are you serious? I can't believe this is happening. I get to live with you and I'll get a built-in family, too?",
        "Luke: Yeah, so -- so, is that a yes?",
        "Noah: Yeah -- yes.",

        "Holden: You handled that really well.",

        "Holden: Lily, I have to tell you, I'm really worried about you.",
        "Lily: You're my soon to be ex-husband. You have to stop that habit.",

        "Chris: I don't believe you.",

        "Chris: Well, actually, you are. Dusty's going out of his way to make trouble for me and Emily. And he's getting desperate.",
        "Alison: Are you saying Emily's in trouble?",
        "Chris: No, no, not yet. But he's going around accusing me of --",
        "Alison: Of what? I can't read your mind, Chris, so finish the sentence.",
        "Chris: No, it's not even worth repeating.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Chris: But you should know, your friend Dusty, he fights dirty.",
        "Alison: Well, of course he does. He's fighting for my sister. He's in love with her.",
