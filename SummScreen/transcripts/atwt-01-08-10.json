        "Jack: Okay, troops, let's get a move on. Car is all gassed up. We got to get going.",
        "Sage: I'm ready.",
        "Jack: Oh.",
        "Carly: Wait! Sage, try this on, okay?",
        "Jack: No, Carly, we've got to get going.",
        "Carly: I stayed up all night making this. She's gonna try it on. It's for the, uh -- the talent portion, okay?",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: I need to be sure she can dance in it, Jack.",
        "Sage: You stayed up all night?",
        "Carly: Yeah. You want to be Miss Snowflake America, don't you?",
        "Sage: Definitely. It's my dream.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Carly: Good. Well, then, try it on, and, uh, do your act for us.",
        "Sage: Well, Dad said we don't have any time.",
        "Carly: Dad's wrong. Go ahead, put it on.",
        "Sage: Are you sure you want to see my act now?",
        "Jack: Honey, absolutely. Please, I'm dying to see it. My daughter -- beauty- pageant contestant.",
        "Carly: I know. Weird. But if it's what she wants, then we should be supportive, right? Did you call Janet?",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Carly: Tell her that you're gonna be in Michigan overnight.",
        "Jack: She's probably still sleeping. I'll call her later.",
        "Sage: I'm ready.",
        "Jack: [Clears throat] Uh, and, uh, now announcing --",
        "Carly: [Laughs] Good.",
        "Jack: -- Miss Snowflake America 2010, Ms. Sage Snyder!",
        "Carly: Oh, Sage, you're so cute! You are so totally gonna win! [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey, Parker, I'm sorry. I'm here. Can't believe you're up this early. When you texted me back, I kind of flipped out. Want to get coffee?",
        "Parker: I actually don't have time. My family's going on a road trip, and they're -- they're all waiting for me. But what's up?",
        "Liberty: This.",
        "Parker: The fashion institute of technology? Liberty, you got into F.I.T.?",
        "Liberty: Oh, no. I don't know yet. Everyone says acceptance letters are really thick, and that one isn't, so -- will you open it for me, please? [Sighs]",
        "Parker: You ready? Dear Ms. Ciccone -- congratulations.",
        "Liberty: I got in?!",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: Really?",
        "Parker: Yes.",
        "Liberty: Mmm.",
        "Parker: What's up?",
        "Liberty: No, I'm in, but it's -- it's like a provisional acceptance. I still have to send in sketches from my portfolio.",
        "Parker: That -- that's easy. You -- you can do that. I mean, you're always drawing dresses and stuff, so you can do that no problem.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but I've never done like professional fashion sketches before, Parker. I don't know if I can. What am I supposed to do?",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Liberty: Sketches --",
        "Parker: Hey, um, look, that's a 911 text for my sister. Everybody's waiting for me. I should go.",
        "Liberty: Where are you going?",
        "Parker: Oh, we're going on a road trip to Detroit so my sister can do a beauty pageant.",
        "Liberty: What? Since when does Sage want to do beauty pageants?",
        "Parker: Please don't ask. I don't know. But anyway, really, good luck with the school, okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay. Have fun. Thanks, Parker.",
        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Parker: Craig.",
        "Craig: Parker. See you later.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Janet: Uh, I'm working.",
        "Dusty: You're 10 hours early.",
        "Janet: Well, if you -- if you'd rather be alone.",
        "Dusty: No, no. I'm just doing some bills here. Stay.",
        "Janet: What? Look, I -- [Chuckles] I'm not here because I love to work, okay? Although I really do like this job.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Janet: I'm here because I don't want to be at home. I feel a lot more comfortable here than I do there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Bad news?",
        "Liberty: I got accepted into F.I.T. in New York.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's terrible. Liberty, that's great news. Congratulations. Why the long face?",
        "Liberty: I have to send in sketches from my portfolio.",
        "Craig: Well, if you want to be a designer --",
        "Liberty: Craig, I know. I have designed plenty of things. But I have no idea what to submit -- you know, what would impress them, what they expect.",
        "Craig: Hmm. Well, you know who could help you with that? Carly.",
        "Liberty: I know. I thought about that. But Parker said that they're leaving for Michigan today, and I have to have the stuff in by tomorrow.",
        "Craig: You know what? I think I just had a brilliant idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: Oh. Here's Parker. We'd better hurry up. I'll go get in my jeans.",
        "Jack: Your dance was really good, Honey.",
        "Carly: You were great.",
        "Jack: You got to talk her into canceling this thing.",
        "Parker: What? No! No, you can't do that.",
        "Jack: We can't let her embarrass himself in front of hundreds of people. It will scar her for life. Talk to her.",
        "Carly: What, and tell her that she doesn't have a chance of winning? I can't do that.",
        "Jack: Okay, then, I'll talk to her.",
        "Parker: No, no. Look, you can't do that. She has her heart set on this. You can't bail on her now. If the judge decides that she's not the best little Miss snowball -- or, snow plow or --",
        "Jack: Snowflake.",
        "Parker: Whatever. Like, the point is, if the judge doesn't pick her, she'll get over it. But if we tell her that she's not good enough and we don't even give her the chance to compete, we'll mess her up. We have to let her do this.",
        "Sage: What's everybody standing around for? Let's go.",
        "Jack: I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What's going on at home that's got you here so early?",
        "Janet: Well, I was, uh, looking at Emma's pictures from Thanksgiving, and there were pictures of Jack and his kids and Jack and his cousins and even a picture of Jack and my daughter, and they weren't even speaking at the time.",
        "Dusty: No pictures of you?",
        "Janet: Oh, there were pictures of me. But there were none of Jack and me together.",
        "Dusty: Is that a problem?",
        "Janet: Well, it wouldn't be if things were good between us, but they're not. Liberty and I are living with his family at his farm, and I just realized that -- we don't belong there, not without him.",
        "Dusty: It's all temporary, right? You and Jack are trying to work things out, aren't you?",
        "Janet: I talked to him about getting an annulment.",
        "Dusty: You actually talked to him about it? He agreed?",
        "Janet: No, but he didn't move back in either.",
        "Liberty: Mom! Hey, I have the best news.",
        "Dusty: Craig, we're closed.",
        "Liberty: Its fine, guys. Craig's with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: The kids are getting sodas. I see at least three more bathroom stops in our future.",
        "Jack: That's okay. We're making great time.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, you're driving pretty fast for a lawman.",
        "Jack: Can't help it. They taught me how to drive that fast in lawman school.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] Have you talked to Margo about getting back on the force yet?",
        "Jack: Not yet. But I will. Thanks for getting me there, Carly.",
        "Carly: Anytime, G-man.",
        "Parker: I don't know why I let you talk me into this.",
        "Sage: Come on, Parker. Look at them. And you need to help me out with something else, too.",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Sage: It's part of the plan, Parker.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Sage: Since we're all staying in one room, we need to figure out a way to leave them alone together.",
        "Parker: They'll never let us go off alone in some strange hotel in the middle of some strange city.",
        "Sage: It could work.",
        "Parker: You know what? That's enough, okay? If it's meant to happen, it will.",
        "Sage: You know you want our family back together just as much as I do.",
        "Parker: Yeah. I do.",
        "Carly: All right, kids. Pile in. Next stop, Michigan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, I'm so proud of you! That's great!",
        "Dusty: Congratulations, kid. That's great.",
        "Liberty: Thanks, guys, but I do need to ask you something, and it's kind of important, so excuse us.",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Liberty: So, there's -- there's just a little bit of a catch to me getting in. Uh, and I figured out how to handle it. I just don't really think I like it too much.",
        "Janet: What's wrong?",
        "Liberty: It involves Carly. And I just -- Mom, I need help getting my portfolio together. And she's a fashion designer, so she would be able to tell me exactly which drawings I should submit. But I'm not -- you know, I'm not gonna talk to her or do anything about it unless I know that you're completely okay with it.",
        "Janet: Well, if Carly can help you, I say, go for it.",
        "Liberty: Thank you. There's another little problem.",
        "Dusty: What's your stake in all of this?",
        "Craig: If there's a damsel in distress within 50 miles, you're right there, aren't you, Dusty? Front and center. Protect and defend. At least this time, she's somewhat more age-appropriate, unlike the situation with my daughter.",
        "Dusty: What are you after?",
        "Craig: Nothing that affects Janet directly. Your damsel and her daughter are safe from me.",
        "Janet: So, Jack and Carly have gone to Michigan with the kids. For how long?",
        "Liberty: At least a night. It's a long drive.",
        "Janet: And now you want to go meet them there.",
        "Liberty: Mom, no, no. This is weird. I -- forget about it. I really can figure out another way to get my portfolio together.",
        "Janet: No, Sweetie, listen, okay? This is important, and this could be the best way to get you into F.I.T.",
        "Liberty: Hopefully.",
        "Janet: Well, it's just one thing. I can't drive you to Michigan, Sweetie, 'cause then it would look like I was going after Jack and Carly.",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: That wouldn't be good.",
        "Craig: Excuse me. I'd be happy to drive Liberty wherever she needs to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Wow. It's like munchkin land, only creepier and with more hair spray.",
        "Carly: Be careful. Your daughter happens to be one of them.",
        "Parker: Sage, stop looking so freaked out. This is supposed to be your dream come true, right?",
        "Jack: Sage? You okay?",
        "Sage: I'm great. Look at all these girls in their makeup and fancy costumes. Isn't it cool?",
        "Carly: Why don't we check in?",
        "Sage: Oh, um, can Parker and I look around while you guys do that?",
        "Jack: Sure, yeah. Keep an eye on your sister, all right?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Hi. We are Sage Snyder's parents.",
        "Clerk: Mr. and Mrs. Snyder, welcome.",
        "Carly: Ms. Tenney. Mr. Snyder. We're divorced.",
        "Clerk: Oh. You don't look it.",
        "Bridgett: Hello. I'm Bridgett Lawson. This is my daughter Hayden, soon to be little Miss Snowflake.",
        "Carly: It's a little early to be claiming the crown, don't you think?",
        "Bridgett: And your daughter is?",
        "Carly: Ah! She's standing right over there with her brother.",
        "Bridgett: Oh, uh-huh. As I was saying, not much competition here. Just my little star -- and a few losers.",
        "Carly: Excuse me?",
        "Jack: Are we -- are we all done here?",
        "Clerk: Um, your sash schedule and other goodies are in the bag.",
        "Jack: Oh, great. Thank you.",
        "Carly: Just before we go --",
        "Jack: I just -- I wanted to say it was really, really nice to meet you, and -- and good luck.",
        "Bridgett: And to you.",
        "Carly: Did you hear that woman! Like her daughter could possibly be prettier or more talented than ours.",
        "Jack: Sage's dance is pretty bad.",
        "Carly: Well, then, she'll practice. She'll practice until she's perfect. We'll show her. Okay, don't be nervous. Just remember what you worked on, okay? Y -- you walk tall and then chin up, all right?",
        "Jack: She's got it, Carly.",
        "Sage: I'm not on stage yet, Mom. The competition hasn't even started.",
        "Carly: Well, I ran in the packet that they gave us that the judges are around. They're always watching. So I think it's best to act like you're always on stage, okay? Oh, doesn't Sage look sweet?",
        "Jack: Yeah, you look fabulous, Honey.",
        "Parker: Yeah, she looks so sweet, she's giving me a toothache. I'm gonna go get a magazine to read.",
        "Jack: Be nice.",
        "Carly: Only if she's nice first. Hello, Bridgett. Hayden, don't you look nice?",
        "Bridgett: And you look great! Parsley, was it?",
        "Carly: Sage.",
        "Bridgett: Oh, of course. How could I forget? That name is just so darling. And that super-plain look really works for you.",
        "Sage: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Clearly you don't get the concept of less is more.",
        "Bridgett: Which you obviously do. In fact, I've never seen quite so much less in competition.",
        "Carly: Who the hell do you think you are?",
        "Bridgett: Little Miss Snowflake America's mama, Honey.",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey, hey.",
        "Carly: What! I'm not gonna let that blinged-out bimbo get away with insulting our daughter!",
        "Sage: Dad, do something. Mom's gonna get us kicked out.",
        "Jack: Sage, why don't you go work on your routine? Your mom and I are gonna take a little time out.",
        "Carly: After I tell that witch where she can stuff her sequins.",
        "Sage: It's working.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I told you, we have nothing available at that time. If you can't come in at another time, then don't come in at all! Sorry. What part of \"We're booked\" does she not understand?",
        "Dusty: Who are you so mad at?",
        "Janet: I'm mad at myself. My husband goes off with his ex-wife and their kids, and then I have to let my daughter go off with them. How pathetic is that?",
        "Dusty: It's not pathetic. You're gorgeous and strong.",
        "Janet: You really think so?",
        "Dusty: I do.",
        "Janet: Do you mind if I take the rest of the day off?",
        "Dusty: Sure.",
        "Janet: Great. 'Cause I've got something to do, and it can't wait.",
        "Dusty: Hey, hey. You okay?",
        "Janet: I will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hayden: Aren't you Sage's brother?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Hayden: I'm Hayden.",
        "Parker: I am -- I'm Parker. Where's your mom?",
        "Hayden: I ditched her.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Hayden: She thinks I'm working on the judges, but I'd rather work on you.",
        "Parker: [Chuckles] Oh, I get it. That -- that's a joke, right?",
        "Hayden: I sent my mom to download some new CDs for me. It always takes her forever to do that. So there's nobody in my room if you want to come up and have a soda or something.",
        "Parker: Are -- are you hitting on me?",
        "Hayden: Maybe.",
        "Parker: How old are you?",
        "Hayden: I'm very experienced for my age.",
        "Parker: Well, I would seriously hope that that's not true.",
        "Hayden: You're a jerk, and a loser!",
        "Parker: That's --",
        "Liberty: I think you're, like, so --",
        "Parker: Wow! Liberty, what -- what are you doing here?",
        "Liberty: Looks like you're way over your head, tough guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What are you doing here?",
        "Dusty: Well, you took off so fast, I was worried about you. I wanted to make sure you were okay.",
        "Janet: Yeah?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I want to make sure you don't do anything you'll regret.",
        "Janet: Well, I'm doing something that I should have done a long time ago.",
        "Dusty: What's that? Cleaning house?",
        "Janet: In a manner of speaking. I'm moving out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: All right, you can let go. I'm not gonna do anything violent.",
        "Jack: No, I'm not falling for that. The minute I let go of your arm, you're gonna find Bridgett and start wailing on her.",
        "Carly: That woman is just vile. She insulted our baby!",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. Okay, fine. I'll go beat her up. Where is she?",
        "Carly: [Laughs] All right. I'm over it.",
        "Jack: You sure?",
        "Carly: This just means so much to Sage.",
        "Jack: I know. You're right. So, you're gonna get her kicked out of the competition and yourself tossed in jail. Who wins then?",
        "Carly: You think you're so smart.",
        "Jack: No. You're the smart one. You're Carly Tenney, world-class designer, kiss-ass mom, and all-around cool diva.",
        "Carly: You think I'm a diva?",
        "Jack: No, not like -- not like Bridgett. She has to live vicariously through her kid. You've got a big enough life of your own.",
        "Carly: Well, I think that you are an all-around cool guy.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Carly: Let's go find the kids.",
        "Craig: At last. You know how many tiara tweens I've tripped over trying to find you?",
        "Jack: Did you tell him we were here?",
        "Carly: Of course not.",
        "Jack: Well, then, Craig, it looks like you made that long road trip for nothing.",
        "Craig: Well, actually, I'm here on a special delivery, one you might be interested in.",
        "Jack: Why is that?",
        "Craig: Because it's from your wife.",
        "Craig: I'm here on a mission of mercy.",
        "Carly: For who?",
        "Jack: Something tells me it's for himself.",
        "Craig: No. I'm here because of Liberty.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Craig: Because she needs Carly's help.",
        "Carly: With what exactly?",
        "Craig: She's been accepted into F.I.T., but she needs some guidance to put together her portfolio of designs. I thought of you.",
        "Jack: So you brought Liberty here. Where's Janet?",
        "Craig: Don't worry. Your wife is back in Oakdale, hard at work.",
        "Carly: So you're here because Liberty needs help with sketches? That is the lamest excuse I've ever heard.",
        "Craig: Sometimes truth is duller than fiction. But I'm also here on business.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Jack: You are so full of it, Craig.",
        "Craig: Often yes, but not this time. I have a deal with midday sun I need to talk over with you.",
        "Jack: Then why didn't you just call her and discuss it over the phone?",
        "Craig: Because I like to do business face-to-face.",
        "Jack: Listen, we're here as a family to support Sage. The last thing we need is you causing trouble for us. So get the hell out of here!",
        "Carly: Okay, remember how we didn't want to cause a scene and embarrass Sage?",
        "Jack: Well, sometimes you got to do what you got to do.",
        "Carly: Just give me a minute. I'll handle Craig.",
        "Jack: You're sure?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Jack: All right, fine. I'll go check on the kids.",
        "Craig: Oh, I thought he'd never leave. Now I can concentrate on my most pressing issue.",
        "Carly: The vitamin-water thing?",
        "Craig: You and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You have no idea how happy I am that you're here. This place is a freak show, and -- how did you -- how did you get here? Did you take a bus or --",
        "Liberty: Uh, Craig gave me a ride.",
        "Parker: Craig's here?",
        "Liberty: Mm-hmm, yeah. He drove me here so that I could talk to your mom about helping me with my portfolio.",
        "Parker: Well, there has to be more to it than that.",
        "Liberty: Why do you say that?",
        "Parker: Because Craig's always looking out for number one.",
        "Liberty: Um, well, he mentioned something about doing business with your mom.",
        "Parker: Okay, well, then we need to go find them, all right?",
        "Liberty: Parker, no, no, no. It's not like a big master plan or anything. He's just helping me out.",
        "Parker: And are you sure that we're talking about the same Craig Montgomery here?",
        "Liberty: He was very, very laid-back on my way up here. We just listened to music, worked on my sketches.",
        "Parker: All right. Well, um, do you think maybe we can go for a walk later or something?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. That would be great. Hey, is Sage really excited about the pageant?",
        "Parker: Oh, yes. She is very, very excited.",
        "Sage: Parker, it's really working. Mom and Dad must have gone off alone together. Liberty, hi. When did you get here?",
        "Liberty: You guys aren't really here for the pageant, are you?",
        "Sage: Well, I better go get ready. Bye.",
        "Liberty: What's going on, Parker?",
        "Parker: My dad's coming over here, but he doesn't know what's going on. This is all Sage's idea, so if you could not say anything to him or be mad at him, I'd really appreciate it.",
        "Jack: Hello, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Uncle Jack.",
        "Jack: I ran into Craig.",
        "Liberty: He drove me here.",
        "Jack: Yes. Did you clear that with your mom first?",
        "Liberty: She's fine with it, even after she knew that you were here with Carly.",
        "Jack: Right. I'm sure Carly won't have a problem helping you with your portfolio.",
        "Liberty: I hope so. It means a lot to me.",
        "Jack: I'm just gonna call Janet and let her know you got here.",
        "Liberty: Oh, she would really like that. So, is this all just a big plan to get your parents back together?",
        "Parker: It was all Sage's idea, okay?",
        "Liberty: You're going along with it.",
        "Parker: I know, and I'm sorry, all right?",
        "Liberty: You're sorry? Did you even think about my mom and what this would do to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I can't live here anymore.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you give it a couple of weeks? Why do you have to move out today?",
        "Janet: Because I am living in Jack's family's house. Every time I go to get something to eat out of the refrigerator, I feel like I'm stealing from Emma.",
        "Dusty: What about Liberty? How does she feel about moving out?",
        "Janet: She's gonna be in college in a couple of months, right? I mean, it will just be a temporary thing. It will be just like old times.",
        "Dusty: I thought you hated the old times.",
        "Janet: I hate being married and feeling like I don't belong here.",
        "Dusty: Well, where are you gonna live?",
        "Janet: The Lakeview.",
        "Dusty: You sure you don't want to rent a house somewhere?",
        "Janet: I like the Lakeview. It's convenient, and like I said, it's only for a short amount of time. It works for you, right?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Janet: Jack.",
        "Jack: Hi. How are you?",
        "Janet: I'm good. Are you calling about Liberty?",
        "Jack: Yeah. She got here safe and sound. I knew you'd be worried.",
        "Janet: I was. I hope she's not too much trouble.",
        "Jack: No, not at all.",
        "Janet: Good.",
        "Jack: Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the trip. It's for Sage, and it came up kind of suddenly.",
        "Janet: You don't have to explain anything to me. Just, uh, keep an eye on her, okay?",
        "Jack: I will. I'll take -- I'll take very good care of her. So, what -- what are you doing today? Why didn't you drive up?",
        "Janet: I -- I'm working. In fact, I got to go. Thanks for calling, Jack.",
        "Dusty: When are you gonna tell him you're moving out?",
        "Janet: When I feel like it.",
        "Dusty: When's that gonna be?",
        "Janet: Just quit flapping your gums and help me with this stuff, will you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, when I suggested we go someplace quiet to talk, don't you have a room?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Craig: Can't we go there and talk?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Carly: Because you didn't come all the way up here to talk about business, Craig. That's why.",
        "Craig: You're wrong. I want to stay in business with you. I want to keep Midday Sun going because we got a good thing going there.",
        "Carly: Because it was so profitable?",
        "Craig: Yes, and because we built it together.",
        "Carly: [Sighs] I can't talk about this now.",
        "Craig: Think about your kids, Carly. If we keep Midday Sun going, you can ensure a good future for them.",
        "Carly: I can do that with or without you.",
        "Craig: But you'd do it better with me. I can guarantee that. And it would be fun.",
        "Carly: Fun?",
        "Craig: We make a great team. We're both fiercely competitive. We take no prisoners. I bet the rest of those pageant mothers are scared to death of you. If you and I were getting Sage ready for this, we'd have that Snowflake title in the bag.",
        "Carly: Probably because you would have bought off the judges or put itching powder in the competition's ballet slippers.",
        "Craig: Who, me? I wouldn't play dirty.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig, I know you too well.",
        "Craig: I know you, too. We're both pretty relentless when it comes to getting what we want.",
        "Carly: You never give up, do you, even when there is absolutely, positively no hope left?",
        "Craig: There's still hope for us.",
        "Carly: No, there isn't.",
        "Craig: You can't be sure of that.",
        "Carly: Craig, I'm here for two reasons. The first one was to make Sage happy.",
        "Craig: And the second?",
        "Carly: To seduce Jack.",
        "Craig: You told me you weren't going back to Jack.",
        "Carly: I changed my mind.",
        "Craig: Just like that?",
        "Carly: Just like that.",
        "Craig: You told me he was an addiction you were trying to quit.",
        "Carly: It turns out there are only so many addictions I can fight at one time. I decided to give in to this one.",
        "Craig: Yeah, and this one could kill you.",
        "Carly: Jack would never lay a hand on me.",
        "Carly: He drove you to drink, Carly.",
        "Carly: We weren't even together when I started drinking.",
        "Craig: You didn't start drinking because of stress or because you owned a bar or because you were engaged to me.",
        "Carly: I drank because I'm an alcoholic.",
        "Craig: You started to drink because no matter what you did, you couldn't get Jack to leave his wife and come back to you. So, what happens when he leaves again?",
        "Carly: He won't.",
        "Craig: Yes, he will. That's what he does.",
        "Carly: Shut up.",
        "Craig: He loves you. He does. But he doesn't respect you. Half the time, he doesn't even like you. And he has no compunction about dumping you when the going gets rough.",
        "Carly: Well, at least he didn't sleep with my sister while I was in rehab, trying to get sober for him!",
        "Craig: I apologized for that, and I explained how it happened.",
        "Carly: Save your apologies and your explanations, Craig. I don't need them. What I need, what I want is Jack. We have a family that needs and wants us, and this is the perfect time and place to remind Jack what he used to have and what he can have again. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.",
        "Craig: Look, don't do it, Carly. You and me -- we -- we fit. I need you, and I want you. I'd do anything for you -- anything.",
        "Carly: Thank you for that. Thank you for loving me like that. But you're not him.",
        "Craig: Carly, please listen to me.",
        "Carly: Stop. You don't have a chance. Please leave.",
        "Craig: I can't leave. I brought Liberty here so you could help her out. You're not gonna break that poor girl's heart just so you can get Jack back, are you?",
        "Carly: I don't have a problem helping Liberty as soon as Sage's little pageant is over.",
        "Craig: Well, I still have to drive Liberty home.",
        "Carly: Jack and I will look out for her. Go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Now you've all of the sudden just changed your mind about them being married?",
        "Liberty: Okay, what I feel like or -- or think about your dad doesn't matter to me. My mom matters, and she really loves him. She put, like, everything into this marriage, which I don't know if you forgot, but it's still going on.",
        "Parker: Okay. You know what? Sage and I -- we weren't trying to hurt your mom.",
        "Liberty: No, 'cause you weren't even thinking about it. It's like her feelings don't even matter. I just think that trying to hook your mom up with your dad when he and my mom don't even know what's happening is just mean, and I -- I just thought you were better than that.",
        "Parker: Wait. Liberty, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Well, see? Now, this is nice. I can make it feel like home.",
        "Dusty: You think so?",
        "Janet: Sure. No expectations. No responsibilities. A mint on your pillow every night. Sounds nice.",
        "Dusty: Is that really what you want?",
        "Janet: Change of pace would do me some good. And besides, once Liberty's off to college, I'll be here by myself. I won't have to worry about anyone but me. I can do whatever I want, I can have company whenever I want, and I can be with whoever I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. I thought you were getting ready.",
        "Sage: Well, I was waiting for you.",
        "Carly: Well, you should have come and gotten me.",
        "Sage: I didn't want to bother you and Dad. Where is he?",
        "Carly: He's in the lobby. All right. So, what do you want to do with your hair, huh? Up or down?",
        "Sage: Doesn't matter. You and Dad didn't fight, did you?",
        "Carly: No. Nothing to fight about.",
        "Sage: So things are good between you two?",
        "Carly: Sage, I think you should be focusing on this pageant here. That's why we're here, right?",
        "Sage: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Now, where's that bag with your CD in it? Did you practice?",
        "Sage: No. I didn't want to practice in front of the other girls.",
        "Carly: Oh. All right. Well, we'll get your music. We'll find a quiet spot, and you can practice then, okay?",
        "Sage: Okay.",
        "Carly: Sage, your -- your CD is not in here. You know what, Sweetheart? Why don't you go ahead and get dressed, and we'll rehearse later, okay?",
        "Sage: Where are you going, Mom?",
        "Carly: I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You don't have to stay.",
        "Dusty: I don't mind.",
        "Janet: No, that's okay. I mean, I know you got a lot to do at the club, and I can finish unpacking on my own.",
        "Dusty: Stop. Listen -- you don't belong here. You might think living in a hotel has perks, but it gets old fast.",
        "Janet: Perks like what? A nice view, or a sign that I could put on my door that says \"Do not disturb\"?",
        "Dusty: That's all temporary. You know, it's a layover till you're off somewhere else.",
        "Janet: Is that what this is to you?",
        "Dusty: I don't see us having a long run.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Dusty: You're meant to be married, with a home, a family.",
        "Janet: I tried that, and it didn't work out. So maybe it's time for something different.",
        "Dusty: You're not ready for this.",
        "Janet: Yes, I am. Yes, I am. It's not like we haven't done this before.",
        "Dusty: I thought you didn't want to talk about that.",
        "Janet: Well, that was the last time that I'm talking about. Next time.",
        "Dusty: You're still in love with Jack.",
        "Janet: I don't want to be.",
        "Dusty: Try harder before you give up on him.",
        "Janet: Why are you telling me to go back to my husband?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause I'm an idiot. That's why.",
        "Janet: How do you know I'm not ready to just ditch the whole thing?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause you're a fighter.",
        "Janet: He went away with Carly.",
        "Dusty: So what? He's your husband. He accidentally killed his brother. He's going through stuff. What happened to \"Through sickness and in health\" and all that?",
        "Janet: I have wanted a husband and a family since I was a kid. I thought Jack was the one.",
        "Dusty: So go after him.",
        "Janet: I tried that. It didn't work.",
        "Dusty: You didn't try hard enough. If you want to be with this man for the next 40 or 50 years, you've got to go for it with everything you got.",
        "Janet: Okay. Looks like I'm going to Michigan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: The hell with it. I'm going back to Oakdale.",
        "Jack: No need to talk about it, Craig. Just do it.",
        "Craig: I have a question for you, first. What are your intentions?",
        "Jack: My intentions?",
        "Craig: With Carly.",
        "Jack: Craig, whatever happens between Carly and me is none of your business.",
        "Craig: Do you still love her or not?",
        "Jack: I'm married to Janet.",
        "Craig: So if you and Janet work things out, you thank Carly for her hospitality and adios. Is that it?",
        "Jack: I thought you were leaving.",
        "Craig: Just tell me how you do it. How do you hurt her over and over and over again?",
        "Jack: You're gonna lecture me on mistreating a woman?",
        "Craig: You judge her, you divorce her, you marry someone else. And still after all of that, you're still the one that she wants.",
        "Jack: Where are you getting this?",
        "Craig: Jack, she brought you here to get back together with you.",
        "Jack: Oh, give me a break. We're here for Sage.",
        "Craig: She told me so herself. She couldn't have been more clear. She wants you back. I want to know if you want the same thing.",
        "Jack: You're lying. You're just trying to cause trouble between Carly and me.",
        "Craig: I'm not playing games here, Jack. You are. Carly's the victim. I just hope she wakes up in time to realize it.",
        "Jack: Wait. What exactly did she say to you?",
        "Craig: You know, it makes me sick when I think of all the years she's wasted on you! And you have absolutely no appreciation for her. But hey, at least there's some silver lining.",
        "Jack: Really? What's that?",
        "Craig: You will never be able to hold on to her.",
        "Jack: I get it. You made another play for her, and she shot you down. Is that it?",
        "Craig: Yes. Because she's never stopped loving you. She's an incredible prize, Jack, and never has a man been less deserving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey, Liberty, wait. Look, this was all Sage's idea.",
        "Liberty: Right.",
        "Parker: No, seriously. I was completely against it at first, but -- but then she turned on the waterworks, and you know how my sister can be. And -- and I gave in, and I'm sorry, okay?",
        "Liberty: Then, Parker, why don't you just talk to your mom and dad and -- and tell them what really happened, that you and Sage were trying to get them back together?",
        "Parker: Because I can't do that.",
        "Liberty: Why not? Oh, 'cause you really want it to work. You really want to get them back together.",
        "Parker: It will probably never happen.",
        "Liberty: I should call my mom.",
        "Parker: And tell her what, that my parents are getting along well? I mean, I think she already knows that.",
        "Liberty: Parker, she really loves him.",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: Do you not believe that?",
        "Parker: The thing about my mom is that she never gives up. Your mom did. And at this point, I don't think that there's anything that you or I can do to help her.",
        "Liberty: [Sighs] Yeah. I guess you're right.",
        "Parker: So are we cool?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I should probably just talk to Carly about my portfolio.",
        "Parker: Well, I think she's gonna be pretty tied up with Sage until after the pageant.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Then I'll just go for a walk then.",
        "Parker: Okay. Do you think that I can maybe join you? Because I don't want to get harassed by another little pageant queen.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I guess it's up to me to save you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I just had an interesting run-in with Craig.",
        "Carly: You did? What did he say?",
        "Jack: Well, that's what I would like to talk to you about. That's not our room.",
        "Carly: I -- I know. It's -- its Bridgett and Hayden's room.",
        "Jack: So why are you going in there, Carly? Carly, what the hell are you doing? This is -- Carly, this is breaking and entering! Carly, it's against the law.",
        "Carly: Stop it! Stop. Bridgett stole Sage's CD, so she can't practice her routine. I just want to find it and bring it back to her.",
        "Jack: Do you really think it would make a difference if you found it or not?",
        "Carly: Yes, of course -- what are you talking about?",
        "Jack: Why are we really here, Carly? What were you hoping to get out of this little \"trip?\"",
        "Carly: Somebody's coming.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? No! This is ridiculous. I am not hiding in a closet. Why don't we just go out there and confront her?",
        "Carly: No, Jack, we can't do that. Please.",
