        "Will wants Gwen to see his bank statements to prove what Adam is saying is not true, but Gwen is on his side. Maddie is having trouble believing or forgiving Casey. Emily shares with Meg that she is worried about Craig seeking revenge on her, but Meg convinces her not to worry, but then Craig summons Emily to meet him right away. Paul has another vision and tells Susan that Meg is in danger. Will and Gwen talk about Adam, and Gwen agrees to talk to him about his spending habits. Paul hits a glass of water out of Meg's hand claiming it is poisoned. Meg tests the water to prove him wrong, but is stunned to find it is contaminated. Adam tells Gwen about Carly and she appreciates this so she asks him to stay and help her. Craig tells Emily he is punishing her by selling his part in the paper; Emily doesn't get how this is punishment until she meets Mr. Tull. He gets what he wants no matter what it is; he wants Emily's shares of the newspaper now; Emily refuses and both Craig and Mr. Tull strongly suggest that she reconsider. Gwen and Adam start to argue about Will, and Adam decides to pull out of their venture. Gwen wants him to reconsider and in the process, Adam mistakeningly knocks her down; Will sees this and punches his brother. Casey tries to win some of Elwood's money back and instead makes it worse, just in time for Maddie to show up admitting she should have forgiven him after everything he did for her and because he said he is not gambling anymore. Meg and Paul almost kiss after the near poisoning until Luke interrupts them. Luke tells Meg that he saw Paul looking and reaching into the well earlier; Meg surmises he contaminated her well to play the hero and lets him have it."

        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hi.",
        "Will: I'm working here.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I'm sleeping here. Just keep doing what you're doing.",
        "Will: Okay.",
        "Gwen: What are you working on?",
        "Will: I can't remember.",
        "Gwen: Is it for school? I mean, if it's for school, I'll leave you alone.",
        "Will: Actually, it's my bank statement.",
        "Gwen: Why would you wake up early to work on your bank statements? All these receipts are from the demo?",
        "Will: Yeah. I decided I should put it altogether and turn it into a spreadsheet, so --",
        "Gwen: Why? You wanna go over it with Adam?",
        "Will: No, it's so I could show it to you. Forget what Adam said. I'm telling the truth about this stuff. He's spending way too much on limos and lunches. And if he doesn't stop --",
        "Gwen: I don't understand why.",
        "Will: Well, you know how my trust fund works. It's not a bottomless pit.",
        "Gwen: I meant I don't understand why you're putting it all into a spreadsheet for me. You told me that we were over budget. And I told you that I believed you.",
        "Will: Yeah, but Adam's been telling you stuff, too. I'm gonna go take a shower. All right?",
        "Gwen: I'll come with you.",
        "Will: You should read over the receipts without me. Just tell me what you think, okay?",
        "Gwen: Sure. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Can we at least talk about this?",
        "Maddie: What's left to say?",
        "Casey: I didn't think you'd get so upset because I was gambling a little.",
        "Maddie: Okay, there are at least two lies in that sentence. One -- you knew I'd get upset, otherwise you would have told me.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Maddie: And two -- you don't end up thousands of dollars in debt with just a little gambling.",
        "Casey: Okay, can I talk now?",
        "Maddie: Depends. Can your lips move without lying?",
        "Casey: Forget it.",
        "Maddie: Casey, I'm sorry. That was mean.",
        "Casey: No, you're mad. I get it. It's fine.",
        "Maddie: I'm not mad. You really hurt me.",
        "Casey: I didn't mean to. I just -- I got a little caught up in the whole gambling thing. I'm done now. No more online poker. No more betting, nothing, period.",
        "Maddie: Casey, I'm sorry. I don't believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hi.",
        "Emily: Hi. Where'd you come from?",
        "Meg: The barn. What are you doing here? Come on in.",
        "Emily: Okay. Listen, I know we're not exactly friends. But we have been friendlier with each other lately, right?",
        "Meg: Okay, what do you want, Emily?",
        "Emily: When Craig dropped the charges against Dusty, he kind of threatened me.",
        "Meg: Kind of?",
        "Emily: Well, he would never come right out and say what he was planning to do, but he gave me this look and he said that he had a very long memory.",
        "Meg: And because it's Craig, you can't shrug it off. I don't blame you.",
        "Emily: You don't blame me? What, did he threaten you, too?",
        "Meg: No. You know, we might have some more coffee. Would you like a cup or something else?",
        "Emily: Just water. Water's fine, thank you. So he didn't say anything to you about what we did to him?",
        "Meg: He told me he wants to be a better man.",
        "Emily: Well, we know what that means. Check your brakes and update your will.",
        "Meg: You're serious?",
        "Emily: Meg, the thing about Craig and payback -- you may not know how he's going to get you or where, but you know its coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Outlet seems okay.",
        "Paul: I smell smoke.",
        "Susan: I don't smell anything.",
        "Paul: Well, I smell smoke.",
        "Susan: You look a little clammy.",
        "Paul: If it's not here --",
        "Susan: Are you having chills?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Susan: Listen, maybe you were having a dream about a fire or something. Sometimes dreams seem very real.",
        "Paul: Meg.",
        "Susan: Especially given the medication you're on.",
        "Paul: No, Meg. Is Meg here today?",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Paul: Is she working?",
        "Susan: No, she's not here right now.",
        "Paul: Then she's at home. You have to call her.",
        "Susan: Listen, you need to relax.",
        "Paul: No, I need to get to Meg. She's in danger.",
        "Susan: I'm going to order a sedative for you.",
        "Paul: I saw it!",
        "Susan: What kind of danger?",
        "Paul: Tell her about the water. You have to tell her about the well! Call her now!",
        "Susan: Meg is not in danger.",
        "Paul: I have to get to her.",
        "Susan: No, no, no, no, no. One of the possible side effects of the medication you've been taking is hallucinat --",
        "Paul: I'm not hallucinating, Susan.",
        "Susan: I changed the meds.",
        "Paul: I saw it the same way I saw the other one.",
        "Susan: You'll feel better.",
        "Paul: When the nurse was gonna give the wrong medicine to the patient.",
        "Susan: Sometimes that happens in hospitals.",
        "Paul: No. It was the pink one! And I knew.",
        "Susan: She was a new nurse.",
        "Paul: I knew without a shadow of a doubt that the pink one would kill somebody. How would I know something like that? Why would I know something like that?",
        "Susan: Maybe you observed something about the medicine cart or the nurse and you didn't even realize you were seeing it. And then later, you thought it was a vision.",
        "Paul: I gotta get to Meg.",
        "[Susan sighs]",
        "Susan: You've got to relax. I don't want to restrain you, okay?",
        "Paul: All right. You know, you're probably right. I'm sorry. It's confusing to me because this is all so real.",
        "Susan: Of course it is.",
        "Paul: Maybe a sedative isn't such a bad idea.",
        "Susan: I'll have the nurse get you one right now.",
        "Paul: Okay, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm afraid to go to work. I'm afraid to go home. I just feel like wherever I go, he's going to find me.",
        "Meg: If he's looking.",
        "Emily: If? What, you think he's a better man just because he said the words?",
        "Meg: No, of course not. But he wants everybody else to think he is. And it's not in his best interest to start terrorizing you. He has better things to do.",
        "Emily: Yeah, like looking for his son.",
        "Meg: As soon as Dusty got out of jail, he took off for montega to look for lucy and Johnny. I know Craig is right behind him.",
        "Emily: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Meg: Here, aren't you going to drink your water?",
        "Emily: Tap water? No, no thank you.",
        "Meg: Then why did you ask for it?",
        "Emily: I thought you were going to give me bottled water. What? It's what I'm used to. I like it.",
        "Meg: People have been drinking out of this well for about 100 years.",
        "Emily: Could we get back to Craig, please? You really don't think he's going to try to get revenge?",
        "Meg: He's not focusing on us, Emily. He's focusing on finding Johnny.",
        "Emily: So you're not scared, really?",
        "Meg: No, I'm really not.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? There's only one reason for that. Because you know he has a thing for you.",
        "Meg: I wouldn't say that.",
        "Emily: I would. Craig wants you.",
        "Meg: Well, he's not going to get me.",
        "Emily: He only wants to sleep with you. Me, he wants to kill.",
        "Meg: Well, he won't have to. Because you're going to worry yourself to death.",
        "Emily: We are talking about Craig Montgomery. He likes to do very bad things to people who cross him.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know how worried you were when he got arrested? You thought he was going to deny everything and then come after you? But instead, he went along with our story.",
        "Emily: Yeah, exactly. Because he didn't want to go to jail. He wanted to be free so he could kill me.",
        "Meg: I can't believe you are letting him psych you out like this. Just ignore him!",
        "Emily: Ignore him? Am I supposed to just go to work and pretend like everything's fine?",
        "Meg: Well, you could hide out here, but eventually you will be forced to milk a cow.",
        "Emily: Okay. I'm out of here. [Cell phone ringing] Hi, Craig. How ya doing?",
        "Craig: Hello, Emily.",
        "Emily: How are you?",
        "Craig: Angry. 15 minutes, Lakeview dining room.",
        "Emily: 15 minut -- I've got a lot scheduled today. Actually, I was planning on going -- that voice was dripping with pure hatred.",
        "Meg: Well, I've hated you. That's never bothered you.",
        "Emily: You're harmless.",
        "Meg: Well, you're not. And there's a few men in this town with scars to prove it. Maybe you should remind Craig of that.",
        "Emily: Thanks. Maybe I should remind myself of that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie, you know me better than anybody else. You know that I mean this.",
        "Maddie: With other people, after I was raped, I had a really hard time believing anything that they said. I was always waiting for the moment that these people that I trusted would turn on me. I did it with Henry. I did it with Gwen and will. Everybody except for you. I never thought that you would lie to me, of all people.",
        "Casey: Maddie, never again, all right? I promise, I love you.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I used to believe that.",
        "Casey: So that's it, huh? I make one mistake and then no matter what I say or do, you're not going to forgive me?",
        "Maddie: I want to. I just -- I just, I need time. I need time to figure everything out.",
        "Casey: That's fine. You take all the time you need. But you know something? Trust works both ways. And after everything we went through, I thought that if I made one mistake, the least thing I could count on you for would be -- a second chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So did you look this stuff over?",
        "Gwen: You don't have to prove anything to me, okay? No matter what adam says.",
        "Will: Well, he was right, though. I am still mad that he kissed you.",
        "Gwen: I thought that we were past that.",
        "Will: We are. You and I are. But he wants to make it the reason for everything that I do. You know, like if I get mad and I have a problem, it can't just be about him spending too much, it's got to be about me being jealous. He thinks that I'd actually sabotage your career to keep you with me, and I would never do that.",
        "Gwen: I know.",
        "Will: Do you really?",
        "Gwen: You reach for me when you sleep.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: You know, you can be dead to the world, and if I get out of bed, like two seconds later, you're reaching for me. You prove that you love me even when you're sleeping.",
        "Will: You know what Adam would say about that? That I need you too much to let you go and be famous.",
        "Gwen: He doesn't know you the way that I do. And I told him that.",
        "Will: Why? Did he badmouth me? What did he say?",
        "Gwen: It doesn't matter.",
        "Will: Yes it does, if he's talking trash about me.",
        "Gwen: I don't care what Adam thinks.",
        "Will: Gwen, what did he say? All right, I need to know. And we're not going to leave here until you tell me.",
        "Gwen: I can't believe that we're actually still having this conversation. You're making Adam way too important.",
        "Will: Right. Like I shouldn't care that my brother's trying to turn you against me.",
        "Gwen: He's not doing that. And if he were, I wouldn't listen.",
        "Will: You know, it's amazing that he has time to put me down when he's busy spending so much of my money.",
        "Gwen: Are we still pretending that this is about money?",
        "Will: It's my money, Gwen. It's mine. And if things don't change with the way he's spending, then there isn't going to be any of it left.",
        "Gwen: Look, hey. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You're right. You're absolutely right. We just gotta tell him to cut back.",
        "Will: Well, I already tried that. I mean, that's what we were fighting about when you walked in on us.",
        "Gwen: Do you want me to talk to him?",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. You could give it a try. Maybe he'll actually listen to you. Look, I'm going to -- I'm going to go get some coffee, okay?",
        "Gwen: Is that Will-talk for I'm really upset, so I need to be alone right now?",
        "Will: No, it's Will-talk for I wanted some coffee and we're all out.",
        "Gwen: So if I were to offer to go with you --",
        "Will: Okay, maybe I do need to cool off right now.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Hurry back. What?",
        "Will: You watch me when I'm sleeping?",
        "Gwen: All the time. I love you like crazy.",
        "Will: I knew that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elwood: Hey, I thought you had class.",
        "Casey: I did. I forgot a book. I thought we were permanently banned from online gambling.",
        "Elwood: Well, I mean, yeah, I just created a new user name, that's all.",
        "Casey: Dude, you're getting slammed.",
        "Elwood: Yeah, well, I mean this ace-high guy has been pulling all the good cards. I'm just going to fold.",
        "Casey: No, no, don't! I know this guy. I've played against him. Watch, he's going to raise a hundred.",
        "Elwood: How did you know that?",
        "Casey: I don't know. He must have a system or something. He uses the same strategy no matter what he's holding. Go all in.",
        "Elwood: And lose all my money?",
        "Casey: Just do it, trust me. Go all in.",
        "Elwood: All right. Hey, yes! I won! I won the whole pot! Oh, geez, Casey. You are a poker genius.",
        "Casey: Against this guy, yeah, I definitely am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You're late.",
        "Emily: I'm busy. What do you want?",
        "Craig: A new attitude?",
        "Emily: You threatened me. I don't like that.",
        "Craig: You set me up. I don't like that.",
        "Emily: Tough.",
        "Craig: Careful --",
        "Emily: You know, it's funny, Craig. That's exactly what I've been with you. Careful. And then I realized something. Your son is gone, you have no idea where he is, and my child's dead. You see, there's nothing you can do to me that's worse than that. So what do you say we just put the past behind us and move on? Or you can waste your time threatening me. What's it going to be?",
        "Craig: Both. I'm going to get my revenge, and then I'm just going to walk away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paul throws Meg's glass out of her hand]",
        "[Glass shatters]",
        "[Meg gasps]",
        "Meg: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: How much of that water did you swallow?",
        "Meg: Why are you here?",
        "Paul: Did you drink any of that water? Tell me!",
        "Meg: No. Because you just came in. You just walked in and --",
        "Paul: Thank God! I thought I was too late.",
        "[Paul sighs]",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you, I just -- [Glass crushing underfoot] I didn't want you to drink this water.",
        "Meg: What are you doing out of the hospital?",
        "Paul: No, no, no. Don't, don't touch it, please. Not until we find out what it is.",
        "Meg: You're not making any sense, Paul.",
        "Paul: Meg, the water is poisoned. It'll kill you.",
        "Meg: Not this again. Nothing was wrong with the coffee yesterday and nothing is wrong with the water.",
        "Paul: No, look, I wouldn't -- stop! Look, I'll clean it up, all right? We'll just get --",
        "Meg: Paul?",
        "Paul: Is there -- we'll get a broom. There's gotta be a --",
        "Meg: Hey, hey. I can't believe they released you.",
        "Paul: No, they didn't release me. Nobody knows that I'm here. Listen.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm calling the ambulance.",
        "Paul: No, you have to believe me. Promise me that you're not going to drink that water, okay? And don't let anybody else touch it. It's toxic. And I don't know how I know. I don't even know why I know. I just know that I know.",
        "Meg: I don't know why you have this thing about me and poisoned water --",
        "Paul: No, look. I was wrong about the coffee, but I was right about the danger. I had a -- I had another --",
        "Meg: Another what?",
        "Paul: A vision. I had a vision. I did. And this time I saw it. It was clear. I saw the well and I knew that there was something wrong with the water.",
        "Meg: Look, if you're trying to be a hero just to get me back --",
        "Paul: No, I'm not. I'm not trying to impress you. I'm not trying to win you back. I'm just -- look, I don't know why this is happening to me, but it's happening. And I had this premonition with the nurse, about her giving the wrong medicine to the patient and I was right about that. And I'm right about this.",
        "Meg: I think the whole pill thing was just a coincidence.",
        "Paul: No, it's not. Meg, why won't you just listen to me?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: You know what, Paul? There's nothing wrong with the water in the well. Okay? We check it every month, and I know its fine.",
        "Paul: Check it now.",
        "Meg: Okay, is that going to get you to stop this?",
        "Paul: If I'm wrong.",
        "Meg: And you'll stop worrying about me?",
        "Paul: Probably not, but I'll stop talking about how I'm worried about you.",
        "Meg: Fine, fine. Okay, tell me -- tell me about this vision. What exactly did you see?",
        "Paul: I saw fire and I saw water and I saw you. And I don't know why, but it was very dangerous and I was terrified. And then I had another vision. I saw the well and there was smoke coming out of it.",
        "Meg: Well, that's some kind of trick. See, all fine.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: Oh my God. You're right. The water is contaminated.",

        "Maddie: Hi. Am I invisible?",
        "Will: Oh, hey. Hi. Sorry, I'm just thinking about things.",
        "Maddie: Everything okay?",
        "Will: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Maddie: You sure?",
        "Will: I'm just having some family problems, actually. They'll work themselves out, though. So how are you doing?",
        "Maddie: I'm okay.",
        "Will: Really? What's wrong?",
        "Maddie: What would you do if Gwen started gambling?",
        "Will: I'd have her fingerprinted.",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Will: Well, because I'd know that it was some kind of evil clone that's just -- it's really not Gwen.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, I didn't really think it was Casey, either.",
        "Will: Casey's gambling?",
        "Maddie: Online. Well, not anymore, because he quit. But only after he lied to me about a million times.",
        "Will: Well, so that's good, at least he quit.",
        "Maddie: He had to. He lost a lot of money and Adam had to pay off the online gaming people to help him out.",
        "Will: Wow, isn't that great? Our good old generous brother Adam always seems to come through with my money.",
        "Maddie: This family stuff that you're talking about, let me guess, it's got something to do with Adam?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Adam, what are you doing here?",
        "Adam: Can I come in? It's kind of cold outside.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, sure, come in. We weren't supposed to meet today, were we?",
        "Adam: No. I just heard something, though, I think you should know about.",
        "Gwen: You know, if it's about the demo, can it wait until tomorrow? Because today's the first day that Will and I have had, you know, alone, and we could really use the private time.",
        "Adam: Is Will here?",
        "Gwen: He'll be back soon, so --",
        "Adam: I get it now. Last thing I want is to come between you guys.",
        "Gwen: You couldn't even if you tried. You know what? Actually, can I run something by you? Will and I were going over --",
        "Adam: Just let me say this first. It's not in the papers yet, but I heard my mom talking about it. I really think you should have a heads up.",
        "Gwen: Okay, what is it?",
        "Adam: Your sister's been arrested.",
        "Gwen: Carly? I don't understand. What happened?",
        "Adam: Well, I don't have all the details, but the charge was aiding and abetting a fugitive.",
        "Gwen: No, no. Carly would never do anything like that.",
        "Adam: Just telling you what i heard.",
        "Gwen: Where is she? Is she out on bail?",
        "Adam: As far as I know, she's still at the police station.",
        "Gwen: All right, I'm going to check on her. Do you have, like, a direct line here for --",
        "Adam: Here.",
        "Gwen: Thank you.",
        "Adam: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Hello? Yeah, hi. I just heard that my sister's been arrested. Her name's Carly Snyder. Okay. Can I see her? Well, is Jack there? Jack Snyder? Okay, could you do me a favor? Could you leave him a message? Could you tell him to call Gwen, please? Okay, thank you.",
        "Adam: I'm sorry I had to lay all this on you.",
        "Gwen: That's okay. I wouldn't have known otherwise.",
        "Adam: Still, it's got to be a lot to deal with. I should go.",
        "Gwen: Adam? Please stay.",

        "Emily: You're losing your touch, Craig.",
        "Craig: How so?",
        "Emily: Broadcasting your next move before you actually make it. Why do you want to hurt me anyway? What do you get out of it?",
        "Craig: Satisfaction.",
        "Emily: Satisfaction. Well, wouldn't a successful newspaper be more satisfying? Knowing that I'm here making sure things are running smoothly while you're off looking for your son? You are going to go try to find Johnny, aren't you?",
        "Craig: Of course.",
        "Emily: Well, then stop threatening me. Or you're going to end up back in prison. And then you really will lose your son forever.",
        "Craig: Point well taken. And despite what I'd like to do, I've reached a similar conclusion.",
        "Emily: What? No revenge? Don't tell me you're a changed man.",
        "Craig: Quite. I have no criminal intentions towards you. In fact, I have no intentions of being involved with you in any way. Now that you've proven yourself so untrustworthy, I have no interest in being in business with you.",
        "Emily: You can't fire me. We're partners.",
        "Craig: Not anymore. I've sold my half of the paper.",
        "Emily: That's my punishment?",
        "Craig: Mm-hm.",
        "Emily: You're not going to work with me anymore?",
        "Craig: Try not to be so happy about it. I might have to rethink it.",
        "Emily: Oh, no, no, no. Please, don't rethink it. I think it's a fantastic idea for the both of us?",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Emily: Wow, who knew? Meg was right about you.",
        "Craig: What did she say?",
        "Emily: She said that if I was strong with you, you would respect that.",
        "Craig: I respect myself way too much to be in business with you.",
        "Emily: Likewise. In fact, I don't think there's anyone I would rather be in business with less than you.",
        "Craig: Think again.",
        "Craig: Emily Stewart, this is Mr. Marcus Tull, your new partner.",
        "Emily: How do you do? It's a pleasure to meet you.",
        "Tull: Very attractive.",
        "Emily: Well, thank you. Thank you. I'm also very productive. I have big plans for our newspaper.",
        "Tull: Our newspaper?",
        "Emily: Well, if you'd like top billing, so be it. It's not important to me. My focus is bringing \"The Intruder\" to the mainstream.",
        "Tull: Well, my focus is on other things.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm not exactly sure what Craig has told you about me.",
        "Tull: Well, he's told me that you're flaky and that you stabbed him in the back.",
        "Craig: I believe in full disclosure.",
        "Emily: Mr. Tull, I'm sorry, may I call you by your first name?",
        "Tull: No.",
        "Emily: Look, I'm the first person to admit that I have had a troubled past, but rest assured, it's all behind me. My interest is the newspaper and my family and nothing else.",
        "Tull: Good for you. So you didn't tell her?",
        "Craig: Why don't you?",
        "Tull: You want to work hard? That's great. Just do it somewhere else.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, I don't understand.",
        "Tull: Well, I'm not really interested in running this rant you call a newspaper. I'm just going to buy. I have Craig's half, now I'm going to buy your half.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Tull: So that I can shut down the whole operation and write it all off as a tax loss. And there's my offer.",
        "Emily: I have many reasons for wanting to stay with my paper. Emotional reasons. It's not all financial.",
        "Tull: Well, that's not my problem.",
        "Emily: What the hell have you done?",
        "Craig: That's how it works, Emily. Reap, sow.",

        "Gwen: What did your mom say?",
        "Adam: You mean after she stopped yelling at me for even knowing about Carly's arrest?",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked you to talk to her about it.",
        "Adam: No, no, it's fine. Really.",
        "Gwen: Can I see Carly?",
        "Adam: No, they're not letting her have any visitors.",
        "Gwen: I should be doing something. I mean, her poor kids. They've got to be terrified. Carly, too. I just -- I wish that Jack would call me back.",
        "Adam: I do know a little bit about the kids. Parker's my brother, too.",
        "Gwen: Right. How are they?",
        "Adam: I called earlier to see if I could help out, but the babysitter said they're just trying to keep the kids in as normal a situation as possible, so they're still in school.",
        "Gwen: That's good. Thank you, Adam.",
        "Adam: I just wish I could do more. Wait a sec. Did you say you wanted to talk to me about something?",

        "Gwen: Don't talk about him like that.",
        "Adam: I'll talk about him any way that I want. It's a brother's prerogative.",

        "Adam: No, no, Will's not worried about the budget or the money or how much it costs to make a demo, okay? He's not broke. Will's jealous.",

        "Maddie: What is it?",

        "Maddie: Like you, what, run out of money before the demo's finished?",
        "Will: Yeah, or not just that, you know. She's got the opportunity to be a huge star, and I don't want to hold her back.",
        "Maddie: Well, you don't have to worry about that. Gwen doesn't want to go anywhere without you. As much as she wants to be a video making award winning superstar, she wants you more.",
        "Will: Wow, she must be really crazy about me.",

        "Maddie: That's different.",
        "Will: How? I know that Casey acts like he's always got it together, but nobody does. And being a freshman and all the stuff that happened this summer, and even Adam coming back to town, none of that's easy.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, he admitted that. The problem is, I didn't really listen.",
        "Will: Well, so go listen to him now. You know where he lives.",

        "Elwood: I can't. They think I already bought my books.",
        "Casey: All right, just relax. We'll win the money back.",

        "Paul: I have no idea. I can't explain any of it to you, because I don't understand. I just know that since that car crash, I see all these images. It happens sometimes when I'm sleeping. Sometimes there's, like, this white light, which is terrifying, because I feel like I'm going to die. Then after, I get these headaches. Thanks.",
        "Meg: You know, you should have stayed in the hospital.",
        "Paul: I had to get to you.",

        "Luke: Well, that was lucky.",
        "Meg: Yeah, you know what? I need to take him back to the hospital. Can you call the county water department and see if they could come over and check the well while I'm gone? I think the number's in the book.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, of course. But can I talk to you first?",
        "Meg: Yeah, sure.",

        "Meg: Well, he had this vision of me drinking a glass of water.",
        "Luke: A vision?",
        "Meg: It's a long story.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe not. I saw Paul leaning into the well.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Luke: Yeah, he was standing by the well and he sort of leaned over the side and -- I didn't know what he was doing.",

        "Adam: Now why can't will come to me straight up instead of whining to you?",
        "Gwen: He's not whining.",
        "Adam: That's what it looks like to me.",
        "Gwen: Look, he's just trying to give me what I want, and that takes money. And you're going through that a little faster than he thought.",
        "Adam: I told him making this demo's going to be expensive.",
        "Gwen: Well, you guys obviously have different ideas about what that word means.",
        "Adam: This isn't about money.",
        "Gwen: Yes it is, Adam!",
        "Adam: Then why is he bringing it up now for the first time, okay? He didn't start second guessing me until he thought I was making moves on his wife.",
        "Gwen: Well, you did kiss me.",
        "Adam: And I apologized. Doing this thing is hard enough without him turning into some type of psycho- jealous freak.",
        "Gwen: You know, I'm sorry, but you are reading him wrong.",
        "Adam: Yeah, maybe. Maybe we should just call it quits right now.",

        "Gwen: Wait, it's not a big thing! You just need to spend less money.",

        "Gwen: Adam, come on!",
        "Adam: It's too bad. It's too bad. We could've had something really great together.",
        "Gwen: Wait a minute. I'm sorry. Adam, this is --",
        "Casey: All right, I'm down 500. All I need is an ace. Come on ace! Damn!",
        "Maddie: Hi.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Maddie: So I thought about everything, and I came to some conclusions. You want to hear them?",
        "Casey: I'm kind of busy.",
        "Maddie: Oh. Well, okay, then I'll keep it simple. You were right. You said that you were going to stop gambling, and you said that you'd stop lying and that's all I need. I trust you.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry I pushed you. And if you need more time, that's fine.",
        "Maddie: No. You were there for me after all those lies that I told. And now it's my turn to be here for you.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, as long as it's really over. And no more hiding things from each other. Okay? Promise?",

        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tull: What did you say?",

        "Tull: You don't even know me.",
        "Emily: Craig's told me how powerful you are. Well, guess what? I've known plenty of powerful men in my past. Men who've threatened to harm me or throw me in jail if I don't do what they want.",
        "Tull: Have those other men offered to give you a ton of money?",
        "Emily: What if I don't want to sell?",
        "Tull: That wouldn't be wise. You said she'd sell.",
        "Craig: I thought she would.",
        "Emily: Well, she won't.",
        "Tull: You know how I operate.",
        "Craig: Oh yeah.",
        "Tull: So convince her. And I'll be seeing you soon.",
        "Craig: You're making a huge mistake.",
        "Emily: I never said that I would sell my share of the paper.",
        "Craig: Take the offer, Emily. Trust me, if you thought I was a bad partner, tull will be a hell of a lot worse.",
        "Emily: No, Craig. No one is worse than you.",
        "Craig: You don't want to test that theory?",
        "Emily: No, Craig. I want to run my paper.",
        "Craig: That is no longer an option.",
        "Emily: I am so sick and tired of being dumped by guys I don't even like. You're dumping me by selling your share of the paper to another guy so he can dump me? It's not happening. Do you hear what I'm saying? I'm through being dumped, period.",
        "Craig: Too late, Emily. I always get my pound of flesh. And what that amounts to this time is that you lose the paper. That's it.",
        "Emily: No, I will not let you do this to me.",
        "Craig: Don't be a fool. Take the offer, or you'll lose a hell of a lot more than the paper.",
        "Emily: You're just trying to scare me.",
        "Craig: I'm trying to warn you. Take it or you'll regret it.",
        "Emily: I don't care who this guy is, he can take his deal and shove it. I have lost enough in my life. I am not losing my paper too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Luke, did you actually see Paul drop something into the well?",
        "Luke: No. No, but he was definitely reaching down into it. Then he went inside. I didn't think anything of it. But now, after you said all this, it kind of sounds weird, doesn't it?",
        "Meg: Yeah, it does.",
        "Luke: Well, I guess he could have just been checking the well, you know. Making sure there was nothing suspicious.",
        "Meg: Yeah, or he could have been contaminating our water supply.",
