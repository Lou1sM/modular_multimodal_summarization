        "Brad has changed his mind about making a baby with Katie, but it is too late because Katie has changed her mind as well; she was trying to have a baby for all the wrong reasons. She needs to move on without him. Will and Gwen bring Hallie for her appointment with Chris, and he puts the piece together that the woman he talked with the other day is Hallie's birth mother. Sophie wonders to Aaron if she can stay in Oakdale? Jack goes to see Carly because Parker is failing two subjects. Sam and Parker cross paths, and Parker makes his opinion of him known. Carly is surprised when Jack suggests they talk with Parker together. Sam interrupts them and offers his help when he hears them talking about where Parker is, but Jack doesn't react very well to his interference. Chris bumps into Sophie and apologizes for talking about her baby when he knows now she had to give it up, since Will is his cousin. Katie tells Brad that she has plans that night possibly with Mr. Right. Carly defends Sam and Jack backs down. Sam tells them where to find Parker, so they rush off to talk with him. Parker is annoyed Sam told them where he was. Parker is sarcastic with them so Carly gives him a heartfelt explanation as to why she doesn't want him going down the path he is. Jack thinks she got through to him. Parker goes to see Sam to tell him to leave him and his mother alone. Sophie sees Gwen struggling to get something while holding the baby and helps her. Gwen asks Sophie to hold Hallie and then invites her and Aaron to dinner. Sophie is reluctant at first, but then agrees. Jack and Carly bond as parents and Carly asks Jack to let him see the kids more. Katie goes speed dating and Vienna tells Brad and then hatches a plan for Brad to get in on it. Katie hits it off with a man named Joe; Brad sabotages it by ripping up the match between them. Katie thinks Brad was her only match, unbeknownst to her of Brad's actions. Vienna and Brad plead his case. While Aaron and Sophie are at Will and Gwen's, Allison shows up. They all have dinner, as Allison is uncomfortable with Sophie and Aaron. Sophie happily feeds Hallie, but is upset later when she hears her cry, as Allison witnesses Aaron comforting her. Gwen wonders if Allison is really ready to walk away from Aaron? Jack relents and lets Carly see the kids more. Cowboy Jack and Sam have a talk about his feelings for Carly and what he is going to do about them. Katie sees Joe later and mentions that she thought they were going to be a match, as did he. They wonder what happened, as Katie realizes what did. After Sophie leaves, Gwen thinks things will be ok, but outside Sophie is crying and admitting that it hurts too much to see her daughter this way. Jack brings the kids over to eat at Carly's, and she asks him to stay? Katie rips into Brad for his deceit when she tells him about talking with Joe and seeing the ripped up matches that Brad took; she doesn't want to talk to or see him anymore outside of work. Jack is about to take Carly up on her offer when Sam comes in and asks to join them. Jack tells Carly that he will take a rain check. Jack leaves, but then looks bothered as he watches Sam, Carly and his kids through the window."

        "Stage manager: Almost ready to roll. Let's clear the set, everybody.",
        "Brad: You're amazing.",
        "Katie: The magic of television.",
        "Brad: No, I'm serious. You are. You came in all chipper today, I know you had a rough time. I mean, with my bullheaded brother breaking in your door.",
        "Katie: Jack is not bullheaded -- all right, let's just not go there, okay? Your brother and I had an amicable parting of ways.",
        "Brad: You call that amicable? I mean, you're pretty wrecked.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm totally over it now. Jack and I are officially history -- which should be good news for you. But since you don't want to sleep with me anymore I guess that's that.",
        "Brad: Actually, I've been thinking about that. That maybe that shouldn't be that.",
        "Katie: Brad, have you met Dena Donatello? Hi, good to see you. She was just named lingerie legend at the Chicago loop sleepwear awards.",
        "Brad: Big fan of your work. It comes off beautifully. Can you excuse us for -- just for a second?",
        "Stage manager: Ten seconds.",
        "Katie: Brad, Brad, your mark. There we go. Okay.",
        "Stage manager: In five, four --",
        "Katie: Hi, we're here with Dena Donatello, lingerie legend, and she's brought with her some of her amazing pieces -- they are hot.",
        "Brad: Any of you ladies who want to spice things up in the bedroom, check these out.",
        "Katie: And you men should take a little peek, too.",
        "Brad: Yeah, if you model them.",
        "Katie: Seriously, guys. This -- great, perfect gift idea for Valentine's Day.",
        "Brad: You get one of these numbers for the little lady and you're both gonna get lucky.",
        "Katie: Dena, tell us about this little number.",
        "Dena: It's a cotton-poly mix for that sleek form-fitted look. Feels like silk sheets.",
        "Katie: This one you've got to feel to believe. Will this drive your man out of his mind, or what? This one's like wearing nothing at all! Brad, what do you think?",
        "Brad: I can't wait to get you back in the sack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: She didn't cry once the whole time.",
        "Will: Yeah, she had Dr. Rothman wrapped around her little finger.",
        "Chris: Will, Gwen. I was hoping I'd run into you guys.",
        "Gwen: Hi.",
        "Chris: Is this your little girl?",
        "Will: Yup.",
        "Gwen: This is Hallie Jennifer.",
        "Will: If you want to make a donation to her college fund you're more than welcome.",
        "Chris: Oh, check's in the mail.",
        "Will: Oh good.",
        "Chris: You guys, I've seen my share of babies, but she is really beautiful.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. She's going to be a heartbreaker.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, Will says she can't date 'til she's what, 30?",
        "Will: 40.",
        "Gwen: Oh.",
        "Chris: Well, Hallie's a very pretty name. You know what, I just realized something, was this an open adoption?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, it was. Why?",
        "Chris: Well, I think I met the birth mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I'm okay, really. It doesn't hurt when I breathe anymore.",
        "Aaron: That C-section was serious.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, well I think it made Lisa Grimaldi take pity on me.",
        "Aaron: Hey, a room at the Lakeview and your old job back. Not too bad.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, thanks to Gwen and Will.",
        "Aaron: Well, I'm pretty excited to have you back at work. 'Cause it hasn't been that much fun without you.",
        "Sofie: Less broken glass to clean up.",
        "Aaron: No, seriously. I mean, I think it's a good thing that you're getting back into a routine. Come on, staying at the Lakeview beats the hell out of the Wagon Wheel.",
        "Sofie: Yeah. I don't know how long I can stay.",
        "Aaron: Lisa's cool with you staying as long as you want.",
        "Sofie: No. I -- I meant in Oakdale.",
        "Aaron: You thinking about leaving? What about the baby? I mean, can you handle not seeing her again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Yeah, she was here the other day as an outpatient. I could tell she had a C-section and she told me her baby Hallie was born just before Christmas.",
        "Will: Yeah, that must be Sofie.",
        "Chris: She didn't introduce herself.",
        "Will: Did she seem okay with giving up the baby?",
        "Chris: She didn't mention it. Now I can see why. I mean, she's got to be missing this beautiful little girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Can I get you a beer?",
        "Jack: No, thank you.",
        "Carly: I thought maybe you'd want to celebrate. Our opening night was a huge success, a big moneymaker for the O.P.D.",
        "Jack: Yeah, commissioner wants to give you a citation. No, it's a good thing.",
        "Carly: Oh. You don't look very happy, Jack. What's going on?",
        "Jack: Well, we have a problem. It's Parker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Wait, wait, wait. Don't run off. I'm just leaving.",
        "Parker: Where's your dummy?",
        "Sam: He's at home. You know, we're not attached at the hip. Can I buy you a milkshake or something?",
        "Parker: No. I don't like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What did Parker do now?",
        "Jack: Second semester grades came out. He's failing two subjects.",
        "Carly: Oh, no.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Oh, he used to be such a good student.",
        "Jack: I talked to his guidance counselor. She said that he's having trouble concentrating in class.",
        "Carly: All right. Well, we'll make sure that he gets help. We'll hire a tutor, if that's what he needs. We'll make sure that he knows that it's important that he buckle down.",
        "Jack: Yeah, definitely. But it may take more than that. It's not just his grades, Carly.",
        "Carly: I know. I know that Parker's been acting out a lot lately. And I know it's because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thanks to Dena for her sexy sleepwear. A perfect way to spice it up for Valentine's Day.",
        "Brad: Tune in tomorrow where you'll meet the author of a new book on psychic healing and stress reduction. I'm Brad Snyder --",
        "Katie: And I'm Katie Peretti. Thanks for watching \"Oakdale Now.\"",
        "Stage manager: And we're out.",
        "Katie: Tony, please tell me you can edit out Brad's tacky comment.",
        "Stage manager: No worries, we'll clean it up in post.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Brad: I still think you'd look amazing in that leopard print number.",
        "Dena: I'll leave you some samples.",
        "Katie: Oh, thank you so much. You were great. And good luck with everything.",
        "Brad: Thank you very much. I was all wrong yesterday. I mean, we can go back to making babies anytime.",
        "Katie: Actually, Brad, I was thinking about that, too. And I don't want to wake up weeks from now pregnant and alone, so thanks, but no thanks. We won't be having sex again.",
        "Brad: Wait a minute. We need to talk about this. What changed here?",
        "Katie: Brad, I realized I was trying to have a baby with you for all the wrong reasons. I was married to your brother! It's completely inappropriate.",
        "Brad: What is inappropriate about you and me? I think that we are very appropriate.",
        "Katie: Think about it. Having a baby without being in a committed relationship, that would have been a complete disaster for you, for me, especially for the baby. Brad, we're great friends. That's all we should be.",
        "Brad: Friends with benefits maybe?",
        "Katie: No, no. Not anymore. Having sex with you over the past few weeks has been a revelation.",
        "Brad: Really? Well, how so?",
        "Katie: It reminded me of how important it is to be intimate with someone. I want to fall in love again. I want to be in a relationship.",
        "Brad: Well, it's funny that you should say that because I was thinking --",
        "Katie: But it can't be with you, Brad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Now since I'm living with your mother, we should at least just try to get along.",
        "Parker: You shouldn't be mooching off my mom like that. It's not right.",
        "Sam: I don't blame you for feeling that way. And just so you know, it's not permanent. Okay, I'm gonna get my own place as soon as I get the money.",
        "Parker: Yeah, that's an excuse. You don't want to move out.",
        "Sam: I don't want to leave your mother in the lurch. No.",
        "Parker: Is that what you told my mom? And she believed you?",
        "Sam: Parker, the truth is, your mother asked me to stay. To help out at the club while Kit is away. I would never take advantage of her.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right.",
        "Sam: Well, it's true. I respect her too much. I mean, you can believe whatever you want to believe, but the truth is, I'm only trying to help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, I'd love to be able to talk to him, but he doesn't listen to anything I say. So, I guess it's gonna have to come from you.",
        "Jack: No, I think we need to talk to him together.",
        "Carly: We do?",
        "Jack: Yeah, we're his parents. We got to set him straight. Let him know that we understand what he's going through, but we expect more out of him.",
        "Carly: Right. Yes, we should talk to him together.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: And we should do it as soon as we can. Do you know where he is right now?",
        "Jack: Well, that's another problem. He knew the grades were coming out today, so he high-tailed it out.",
        "Carly: Oh. You don't think he ran away again, do you?",
        "Jack: Oh, I hope not.",
        "Sam: Sorry to interrupt, but I think I may be able to help.",
        "Jack: Well, we don't need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: If you move away, you may never see Hallie again.",
        "Sofie: You know, sometimes it's really painful to be around her.",
        "Aaron: But moving -- all by yourself, I mean, that's a real big decision. I'm your friend, I'd miss you.",
        "Sofie: I'd miss you, too.",
        "Aaron: Think about it, hard.",
        "Sofie: I will. I will, okay?",
        "Aaron: Listen, I got to get going. I got to pick up my uniform at the dry cleaners before it closes.",
        "Sofie: Okay, go ahead. I'm fine.",
        "Aaron: And then I'll head back to the Wagon Wheel and we can move all that stuff out.",
        "Sofie: Okay. Thank you, Aaron. For everything.",
        "Aaron: You got it.",
        "Chris: Excuse me. We met at the hospital the other day. Chris Hughes. I didn't catch your name.",
        "Sofie: Sofie Duran.",
        "Chris: I hope I'm not out of line, but when you told me about your C-section, and having a baby -- I had no idea you'd given the child up for adoption.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I probably should've mentioned that.",
        "Chris: Well, I know the adoptive parents. Will Munson's a cousin of mine. I saw Hallie today, too. She's beautiful.",
        "Sofie: I know.",
        "Chris: Sorry about -- sorry about upsetting you the other day.",
        "Sofie: You know, its okay. There's really no way you could've known. I mean, it's still really hard for me to say it out loud -- I gave her up.",
        "Chris: Well, what you did was very brave. And generous. I know this is has to be a tough time for you. If you need help, we have support groups at the hospital.",
        "Sofie: I know. The social worker told me. I didn't take the pamphlets though.",
        "Chris: Well, if you call my office, I can give you a referral.",
        "Sofie: Thank you.",
        "Chris: Take care of yourself, okay?",
        "Sofie: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I made up my mind, okay? I'm gonna move on and find someone new, and if you are truly my friend you will accept that and support it.",
        "Brad: I want you to be happy.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Brad: So, can I take you out for a drink and we can discuss where we go from here?",
        "Katie: Actually, I have plans tonight. In fact, I might have a date with my new Mr. Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: It's probably gonna take me a little while to get all the books for next semester, but I'll go as fast as I can.",
        "Gwen: Oh, we'll be fine for a couple hours.",
        "Will: Okay. You got everything? Got it covered?",
        "Gwen: Moms have to juggle a million things. Go on.",
        "Will: Okay, good. I think you're in good hands.",
        "Gwen: I love you.",
        "Will: All right. Bye, Sweetie. You, too.",
        "Gwen: I'll see you at home.",
        "Sofie: Hey. Need a hand?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, if you could just grab that out for me, that would be great, and just set it down. Thanks. Um, hi.",
        "Sofie: Hi.",
        "Gwen: She had her first checkup today.",
        "Sofie: Is she okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, she's perfect. And all the doctors and nurses, they love her.",
        "Sofie: Well, who wouldn't?",
        "Gwen: You want to hold her?",
        "Sofie: Are you sure? I mean --",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm positive. She's asleep, just -- you got her?",
        "Sofie: Yeah. Shh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Katie, Sweetheart, you look fabulous. What's the occasion? Are you meeting Brad?",
        "Katie: No. Actually, don't tell anyone, but I'm here for that speed-dating group, mate-date.",
        "Vienna: Why? You don't have to go on any speed-date, whatever that is. Brad is more than willing to give you a baby and love you.",
        "Katie: I know, but I need to date other guys. And my biological clock is ticking, so I figure with speed-dating the bad dates are over faster.",
        "Vienna: No, Katie, don't do this.",
        "Katie: Oh, I have to go sign in. Wish me luck.",
        "Brad: Vienna, have you seen Katie?",
        "Vienna: Yes! She's going on a dating spree, and you have to go stop her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack, Sam hasn't done anything wrong. He's been very helpful. He saved me on New Year's Eve.",
        "Jack: That doesn't give him the right to interfere in our family.",
        "Sam: I'm just trying to help.",
        "Carly: You see? Sam is a decent guy, Jack. You got to give him a break.",
        "Jack: Okay, fine, I overreacted. Sorry.",
        "Sam: Apology accepted. If you're looking for Parker, I think I know where he is.",
        "Carly: Oh, Parker, I'm so glad you're here. I thought you'd run off again.",
        "Parker: How did you find me here? Your good buddy Sam tip you off?",
        "Jack: This isn't about Sam. It's about you failing history and science.",
        "Parker: You gonna to read me my rights and then throw me in jail, or what?",
        "Jack: Don't joke about this, please.",
        "Carly: Hey. I know that you've been going through a tough time, but if you keep falling behind in school it could affect you for the rest of your life.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I better get it together so I can be perfect like you.",
        "Jack: Wait a minute. Watch your mouth. Nobody's perfect here. Not your mother and certainly not me. But we are trying the hardest we can. We need you to try harder.",
        "Parker: Okay. I'll try harder. Next quarter I won't fail any classes. Is that it?",
        "Jack: I spoke to your principal. You can make up for the classes that you failed by getting extra help and taking the makeup tests. Now, it's not going to be easy, but you got to buckle down.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Anything else?",
        "Carly: Yeah. No hockey after school. And no hanging out with your friends either.",
        "Parker: For how long?",
        "Carly: As long as it takes for you to get your grades up.",
        "Parker: I don't get it. You lie and we have to live with it. I fail a couple of classes and I'm grounded? Why?",
        "Carly: 'Cause you're the kid, that's why.",
        "Parker: That's the best you can do?",
        "Jack: Parker.",
        "Carly: Hey. You think that actions don't have consequences? You think my life's golden? I'm sharing my house with another woman's boyfriend who's got a doll in a bag instead of my husband and my children. You're growing up, and I'm missing it! I've messed up, I know that, but I'll be damned if I'll stand by and watch you do the same thing. You got it? Got it?",
        "Parker: Got it.",
        "Jack: Good. New rules start now. Go home and start cracking on those books.",
        "Parker: Okay. Fine.",
        "Carly: Parker, be mad. Please remember that I love you.",
        "Parker: Whatever.",
        "Carly: I wish I knew how to get through to him.",
        "Jack: I think you just did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Go ahead. See if she'll -- even when she's sleeping, see if she'll grab your finger. Just --",
        "Aaron: Hey, hey, hey. How's my goddaughter doing?",
        "Sofie: Hallie's getting so big. You know, when I first held her, right after she was born, it was amazing. But now, it's like she's turning into a little person. Look at that. Did you see that? She just smiled at me!",
        "Gwen: She's saying hello to her birth mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Hey, Parker. What can I do for you?",
        "Parker: Quit spying on me. And don't rat me out to my mom and my dad.",
        "Sam: Uh, first of all, I wasn't spying on you. Your parents were looking for you so I just told them where you were.",
        "Parker: You just did that to get in good with my mom.",
        "Sam: Parker, why are you so suspicious?",
        "Parker: Because I don't trust you or your stupid dummy.",
        "Sam: Leave Cowboy Jack out of this.",
        "Parker: Stay away from me, and leave my mom alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yeah, you were tough with Parker, but that's what he needs.",
        "Carly: I'm glad that we talked to him together. He's lucky to have you.",
        "Jack: And you. Hey, we got to raise three kids, Carly. We need to be a team.",
        "Carly: I'd like to be there for them more. If you mean that -- about being a team, let's prove it.",
        "Jack: What did you have in mind?",
        "Carly: Let them stay with me more. Can you do that for me, Jack? Can you do that for our family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: This will never work.",
        "Vienna: Just let me work my magic, okay? Come on. You stay right here, okay?",
        "Brad: Well --",
        "Vienna: Just -- oh, excuse me, are you here for mate-date?",
        "Stan: Uh, yes, I am. You too? This is my lucky night!",
        "Vienna: Well, I was going to join the group, but not anymore.",
        "Stan: Oh, why not?",
        "Vienna: Do you see that man over there? Do you know who he is?",
        "Stan: Uh, he looks familiar, but I can't place him.",
        "Vienna: He's from \"Oakdale Now.\" The TV show. You know, his producer is in the ladies room. And they're doing a hidden-camera expose. And I don't want my personal life to be trashed all over tabloid TV.",
        "Stan: Yeah, you're right. Uh, thanks for the head-up. I'm out of here.",
        "Vienna: Excuse me. Your name tag.",
        "Stan: You want to get a drink?",
        "Vienna: Well, unfortunately, I'm working later. But if you stop by Al's diner, I'll give you free coffee and a pepperkakor.",
        "Stan: I'll see you there. Whatever that is.",
        "Vienna: Come on. Now, ta-ta. I did my job, and now it's all up to you. Go get a date --",

When we're all finished, if you've met anyone that you would like to date, just write their name down on your personalized index card.
