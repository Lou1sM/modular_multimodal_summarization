        "Jack tells Carly that he got the mortgage. He's terribly upset when he spies the $200,000 check that Carly accepted from Craig. He's afraid Craig will take this as an invitation to move in and take over. She tells him that is not so; Jack just wants to control her. Craig feels the hostility from Janet when ordering at the diner. He tells her that in the future not to sugar-coat it, just tell him what she thinks. She thanks him later when he's able to do the Heimlich maneuver on a young customer. Trouble is Jack walks in just as Craig is demonstrating it to Janet and Jack warns him to take his hands off his wife! Craig further irks Jack more when he leaves a very generous tip .citing the service was excellent! Craig calls Carly and says he just saw her ex and he thinks they should talk. Barbara berates Dusty for not telling her that he'd found her grandson. He hugs her, manages to calm her down and says that he was going to tell her today. He just wanted to be sure that Johnny was okay first. Josie brings Paul in to see Johnny. Paul is still confused. He thinks Josie is Jennifer. Josie asks him to go back to his room and for him to try to get some rest. Barbara finds Paul missing and insists that Josie tell him where he is. She was watching him. Dusty won't let Barbara talk to Josie this way. She is not Paul's keeper.",
        "Craig finds Parker and Liberty hiding behind the counter at Metro. He promises not to get them in trouble with Carly. Janet promises Jack that Craig will never put his hands on her again. And she thinks Carly can figure that out too without Jack's constant disapproval. Josie finds Paul at Jennifer's grave. She knows that on some level that he knows that Josie is not Jennifer as he came here to say goodbye to Jennifer. She talks him into going back to the hospital. Carly politely tells Craig that she hung up on him; she does not want to talk to him. He brings up the check and why she hasn't cashed it yet. Perhaps Jack disapproved so go ahead and make him happy ... tear the check up. She stashes it away on her person and assures him again that she is not talking to him. Janet assuages Jack that they will buy a house and fill it always with huge chunks of time with his kids. Dusty is not happy to hear from Josie that she did take Paul in to see Johnny and then found him at Jennifer's grave. He storms that she had no right to bring that man in to see his son. He doesn't want him within ten feet of his son ever! She claims she can not live her life living for Dusty's constant approval. She vows that on some cold wintry night, he's going to miss her. Count on it! He follows. He won't let her walk out of his life. He's grateful that he has Johnny because of her. Gratitude \u0096 just what she wanted to hear. Craig tells Carly there are no strings attached to the check. She can just say thank you. He's found his son and he's actually going to see him grow up. That's wonderful and he's been wanting to tell someone all day. He thanks Carly for that opportunity."

        "Parker: Hey, can I get an advance on my allowance?",
        "Carly: Hello, Mom. How's your day going? Oh, gee, Parker, my day's fine. How's yours?",
        "Parker: Hi, Mom.",
        "Carly: Hello, Parker. You dropped your sister off at the Lebos, right?",
        "Parker: Yep. And school was the usual. And finished my homework in study hall. And now can I please get an advance on my allowance?",
        "Carly: No. In fact, Honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm going to give any of you an allowance for the while.",
        "Parker: What happened?",
        "Carly: Nothing for you to get too worried about. Just -- I've had to make some cut backs at the club. I had to let a couple of people go. I have to head over there myself to take out the trash and vacuum.",
        "Parker: Why don't you let me do that?",
        "Carly: Well, it's sweet of you to want to help, but really, it's not appropriate for you to work at a bar.",
        "Parker: It's not like I'm going to be serving drinks. I mean, the club's not even open yet, right?",
        "Carly: Yeah, right. It would really help me actually. I could finish this up, I could call a couple of vendors.",
        "Parker: I'll go over there right now. And don't worry about it, Mom, you don't have to pay me a thing.",
        "Carly: How much do you need, Hon?",
        "Parker: $20?",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, you take out the trash, you sweep and mop the kitchen, you vacuum the lounge, and then you can take $20 out of the register when you go, okay?",
        "Parker: Sweet. Keys?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Parker: I need the keys. Thank you. And can I drive over there?",
        "Carly: Nice try. No, ride your bike. Oh, and Parker, you can't have any of your friends show up with you. You know, there's liquor there, and if anything happens --",
        "Parker: Nothing's going to happen, Mom. All right? See ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What do you want more than anything in the world?",
        "Janet: To be married to you for 100 years.",
        "Jack: Besides that.",
        "Janet: Jack! No, you got it?",
        "Jack: I got it.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God! That's so exciting!",
        "Jack: They gave me the second mortgage in no time, yes.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God, I'm finally going to have my own house and my own kitchen. Oh, Emma's going to be so happy. I got my own garden.",
        "Jack: One step at a time -- one step at a time. I still got to get Carly to sign the papers.",
        "Janet: Okay, okay, okay. Well, don't let her give you a hard time. And make sure she doesn't change her mind!",
        "Jack: She won't. She won't. Bye.",
        "Janet: Wait, wait, wait, wait. For luck.",
        "Jack: More luck please. I love you.",
        "Janet: Bye. Yes, whoo-hoo!",
        "Craig: Well, look who's here working her fingers to the bone. The latest Mrs. Jack Snyder.",

        "Josie: Barbara? Is everything okay?",
        "Barbara: I've got to find Paul's doctor. His delusions are getting worse.",
        "Josie: I'm so sorry.",
        "Barbara: He won't stop talking about Johnny. Now he's insisting that Johnny is here.",
        "Josie: Well, he's right. Johnny is here.",
        "Barbara: What? What are you saying?",
        "Josie: He's right in this room. He's recovering from a bone marrow transplant. Dusty is with him.",
        "Dusty: Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God. Johnny. Hi, Honey. Oh, you look just like your mommy.",
        "Dusty: Barbara, he doesn't remember us.",
        "Barbara: What is wrong with you? How could you keep my grandson from me, and try and make me think that my son is crazy! How could you be so cruel?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: So, I'm in the mood for something scary.",
        "Parker: I thought slasher stuff freaked you out.",
        "Liberty: In real life. Not in the movies.",
        "Parker: Well, we'd better hurry because I've got this work thing I've got to do first. Come with me.",
        "Liberty: Why would I want to go to a work thing with you?",
        "Parker: So you can help me.",
        "Liberty: Not interested. Nope.",
        "Parker: And it'll be fun.",
        "Liberty: Fun helping you work, yeah?",
        "Parker: Us, alone, in a bar.",
        "Liberty: Cool. Cool, okay. Let's go. Come on.",

        "Jack: I got the mortgage.",
        "Carly: Congratulations.",
        "Jack: Can you sign it like you said you were going to?",
        "Carly: I'll get a pen.",
        "Jack: Thank you. So how are you doing? On your financial troubles?",
        "Carly: Oh, don't you worry about me. I'll figure it out.",
        "Jack: Yeah. What's this?",
        "Carly: That's a check, Jack. Put it back where you found it.",
        "Jack: $200,000 from Craig Montgomery? This is your way of figuring it out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So, what'll you have?",
        "Craig: Well, what I'd love is some of those Italian delicacies you treated me to at Christmas, but they're not on the menu. Aren't you the chef?",
        "Janet: Do you see this pad? Do you see the pen?",
        "Craig: You're a waitress?",
        "Janet: We call ourselves servers nowadays, slick.",
        "Craig: And that's politically appropriate because --",
        "Janet: Are you going order or what? Do you want something? What's going on here?",
        "Craig: Janet, why the hostility?",
        "Janet: You gave Parker your car. And he went out into an ice storm with my daughter.",
        "Craig: I've apologized to Jack and Carly -- apparently, they didn't tell you that.",
        "Janet: You're not very responsible, are you? But then I guess since you're not a father --",
        "Craig: Actually, I've had three children. And I've just been reunited with my youngest.",
        "Janet: No kidding. Well, if you think it's okay to send a teenager into an ice storm when he's had his license all of ten minutes, then I feel really bad for your kid.",
        "Craig: Wow, a server and a parenting expert all in one. Imagine my luck. And in the future, Janet, please, don't sugarcoat it. Just tell me what you think.",
        "Janet: Okay, you know what I think? I think you should leave. I don't need your money.",
        "Craig: There's a lot of that going around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You got a loan from the bank. If I want to get a loan from Craig, I think that's really just my business --",
        "Jack: You said Craig wasn't going to be a problem.",
        "Carly: You're the only one with the problem, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why did he give you this money, Carly?",
        "Carly: He didn't give me the money. He loaned me the money to help me out with the club. I haven't even decided if I'm going to cash it yet.",
        "Jack: I told you I don't want Craig anywhere near the kids.",
        "Carly: Okay, look around you. He's nowhere to be seen.",
        "Jack: But he will be. He will be! Helping.",
        "Carly: I don't need Craig's help.",
        "Jack: You took his money. As far as he's concerned, that's an open invitation. You're busy at the club, he'll take Sage to piano practice. You want to go see J.J.? He'll offer to pay for the flight to the boarding school. Hell, he'll probably get a charter so he can go along with you.",
        "Carly: I would never let that happen, Jack.",
        "Jack: You won't have a choice. You owe him. Carly, you've put him front and center in all our lives here!",
        "Carly: You know why you're so quick to assume that Craig will use my kids to get to me? Because that's exactly what you do.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: Whenever I do something that you don't approve of, you say that it's bad for the kids. But that's not it. It's just you trying to control me.",
        "Jack: Like I ever could. But I'm damn well going to protect those kids. Craig is a bad influence. I don't want him anywhere near them.",
        "Carly: So you don't want me to take his money.",
        "Jack: No, no, I don't.",
        "Carly: Then I won't.",
        "Jack: You won't?",
        "Carly: I won't. I'll find some other way to pay off the loan, okay?",
        "Jack: Well, that's a good idea.",
        "Carly: And to start me off, you can give me half the money from the second mortgage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Do you know anything about vacuum cleaners?",
        "Liberty: Maybe.",
        "Parker: Well, do you think you could maybe help me get this hose on. Because I really can't figure it out.",
        "Liberty: Well, you're the one getting paid to work here. Not me.",
        "Parker: Well, you're the one who wants to go to the movies, right?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. It's a pretty good show watching you struggle with that thing.",
        "Parker: Okay, nobody could do this. It's impossible.",
        "Liberty: Really? Oh, gosh. For a tough guy, you know, you are pretty hopeless. Ta-da! What? You gonna thank me, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You've got to calm down. You're scaring my kid.",
        "Barbara: That's my grandson in there! Why didn't you tell me that you had found him?",
        "Dusty: I've been worried about saving his life.",
        "Barbara: And I thought I was never going to see him again.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry I didn't call you.",
        "Barbara: You should have called.",
        "Dusty: I was going to. Today. I'll take you for coffee right now and fill you in, okay? Josie?",
        "Josie: I'll keep an eye on Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Call me if you need me, okay? I'm just going to let Johnny know.",
        "Josie: You have a beautiful grandson.",
        "Barbara: Yes, I do. Thank you. I shouldn't be leaving Paul alone. I shouldn't be leaving him.",
        "Josie: Well, why don't I keep an ear out?",
        "Barbara: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Okay. You ready?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Why the hell did you give Parker your car?",
        "Craig: Why do you think?",
        "Janet: Are you just using him to get to Carly?",
        "Craig: Hardly. Parker's a friend.",
        "Janet: He's 16. Don't you have any friends your own age?",
        "Craig: Sadly, no. Those who know me tend to keep me at arm's length.",
        "Janet: Imagine that.",
        "Craig: But, dear Janet, you and I have no past baggage. You could be my grown- up friend.",
        "Janet: I'll pass, thank you.",
        "Craig: I think you're being paged over there.",
        "Janet: He's choking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: The house is half mine, I should get half the money.",
        "Jack: Carly, we discussed this. We both agreed that if we split that mortgage money, then we won't have enough left to do what we want to do with it.",
        "Carly: Right. And that's why I'm letting you keep it all like I promised.",
        "Jack: That is very, very generous of you --",
        "Carly: I want you to be happy.",
        "Jack: And I want you to be happy, too. But hooking up with Craig Montgomery? Carly, no good can come of that.",
        "Carly: Don't you think I can figure that out for myself?",
        "Jack: Then why did you take the check?",
        "Carly: Here you go, Jack. Go get your new wife a new house and leave me alone.",
        "Jack: Don't be stupid about this. I'm not the bad guy here. Craig is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You sure you're okay?",
        "Janet: Here, drink some more water.",
        "Teenager: I'm good. Thanks.",
        "Craig: All right. Didn't leave you much of a tip.",
        "Janet: Who cares. At least he didn't die on my watch, okay? That's good enough for me.",
        "Craig: Truly?",
        "Janet: Truly, and truly, lunch is on me.",
        "Craig: An offer of friendship?",
        "Janet: Well, I don't know how to do the Heimlich maneuver. So you really came in handy there. Thank you.",
        "Craig: Well, every waitress -- server -- should know how to do the Heimlich maneuver.",
        "Janet: You're absolutely right. And I have studied the posters back in the kitchen, but I wasn't sure I'd be doing it the right way.",
        "Craig: Tell you what. Why don't I show you how do it right now?",
        "Janet: Yeah?",
        "Craig: Sure, just stand in front of me.",
        "Janet: Where do the arms go?",
        "Craig: Right around the waist.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Craig: Fist in your palm and push up at the belly button.",
        "Jack: Montgomery, get your hands off my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mom? Mom? Mom? Hey, Jen.",
        "Josie: Barbara went to get some coffee. She'll be back soon.",
        "Paul: You must be so excited Johnny's back.",
        "Josie: Try to get some rest.",
        "Paul: Hey, Jen?",
        "Josie: Paul, I'm not --",
        "Paul: Can I see him?",
        "Josie: That's not up to me.",
        "Paul: You're his mom.",
        "Josie: I can't.",
        "Paul: Now that he's back, I'd thought you'd forgive me for what I've done.",
        "Josie: Paul, nobody blames you.",
        "Paul: Well, you do, or you'd let me see him. Please, Jennifer? Please?",
        "Josie: We should go.",
        "Paul: Hey. Your mom said I could come say hi.",
        "Johnny: She's not my mom. She just looks like her.",
        "Paul: Why did he say that, Jen?",
        "Josie: We're going to visit more later, Johnny. Try and go back to sleep.",
        "Paul: He just said that you weren't his mom. Why would he say that?",
        "Josie: Because it's true.",
        "Paul: Jennifer --",
        "Josie: I'm not Jennifer. I'm Josie. You hired me to pretend to be your sister. But now everybody knows that now that I'm not her.",
        "Paul: Where's -- where's Jennifer?",
        "Josie: She died, Paul.",
        "Paul: Oh.",
        "Josie: You need to go inside and lie down. And try to get some rest, okay? I'm going to go check on Johnny.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Listen, there was a kid at the counter sitting here and he starting choking and Craig was just showing me how to give him the Heimlich maneuver in case anything like that ever happens again. Nothing was going on.",
        "Jack: And nothing will. Good-bye, good-bye Craig.",
        "Craig: Well, Janet, thank you for what I did have of my lunch.",
        "Janet: Oh, you don't have to do that.",
        "Craig: I believe in tipping well. And the service was excellent.",
        "Jack: You're a funny man. You're a funny, funny, man.",
        "Janet: Look at me. He's not worth it. He's not worth it. Come here.",

        "Carly: What do you want, Craig?",
        "Craig: I just had a run-in with your ex.",
        "Carly: Where did you see Jack?",
        "Craig: 'Round and about. You told him about my offer?",
        "Carly: I'm busy, and I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Craig: Well, I think we should talk. You at Metro?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Should stop.",
        "Parker: No, do you really want to?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, someone could walk in --",
        "Parker: Yeah, but the door's locked, and I have my mom's keys. We're safe.",

        "Barbara: All these years just wanting Johnny to come home. Here he is. He's home. I want to see him again. Can I go in and see him, please?",
        "Dusty: Why don't you come back at dinner time? We'll do introductions.",
        "Barbara: Jennifer would be so happy. Now we just have to get Paul well. But I think this is going to help.",
        "Dusty: Excuse me, I wanted to talk to Dr. Reed about my son. Do you know when he's on rounds?",
        "Nurse: I'll check on that for you.",
        "Barbara: Excuse me, nurse, do you know where my son went? He's not in his room.",
        "Nurse: He was in there a few minutes ago.",
        "Dusty: Maybe he got taken for some tests.",
        "Nurse: Not to my knowledge.",
        "Barbara: My son has had a breakdown. He can't be wandering around the halls. Where is he?",
        "Josie: What's going on?",
        "Barbara: What happened to Paul? Where is he?",
        "Josie: I --",
        "Barbara: You were supposed to be with him. Did you say something to him? Did you so something, Josie?",
        "Dusty: Josie has nothing to do with this. She was taking care of Johnny.",
        "Josie: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: She wasn't anywhere near Paul. Leave her alone. Instead of getting on Josie's case, you should be out looking for your son.",
        "Josie: I'll help you.",
        "Dusty: That's not your responsibility. You want to know why I didn't tell you about Johnny sooner? This is why.",
        "Josie: Barbara has a right to be upset.",
        "Dusty: I'm just glad you were with Johnny. Because if Paul came anywhere near my son --",
        "Barbara: Paul wouldn't do anything to hurt Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Who knows what he's capable of? Josie's not his keeper. Nor should you be.",
        "Barbara: Tell me something, Dusty. It's obvious you think Johnny wouldn't survive without your protection. How long is that going to go on? How long are you going to assume it's your job to keep him safe?",
        "Dusty: For as long as I live.",
        "Barbara: Well, welcome to parenthood. I feel the same way about Paul. And I'm going to go find a search party for him.",
        "Dusty: I'm going to go in and see my son. Do you want to come?",
        "Josie: You guys haven't been alone together all morning.",
        "Dusty: All right.",

        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Parker: I was supposed to be here alone, all right? So, please don't say anything, because if my mom --",
        "Carly: Deliveries around back, please! Up the ramp and to the left.",
        "Liberty: Parker, oh my God.",
        "Carly: Hi, Sweetheart. Did I hear you talking to somebody?",
        "Parker: No, that was just me getting mad at the vacuum cleaner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Craig Montgomery will never ever have his hands on me. Ever.",
        "Jack: That's because you've got good common sense. I wish Carly had some of that. This is how it always starts. He shells out big bucks to get some project going. And God knows where it stops.",
        "Janet: Nobody knows where it stops. But listen, maybe Carly will take his money and make her club a huge success and then she'll dump him.",
        "Jack: Well, like any good leech, Montgomery doesn't let go until every last drop of blood has been drained.",

        "Jack: Because you can't trust the guy. You cannot trust Craig Montgomery.",
        "Janet: I know. I got that in the first 15 seconds. So, I think that Carly can figure that out on her own without your help.",

        "Carly: This has nothing to do with Jack.",
        "Craig: Right, right. But then you don't want to make him upset. I mean, love of your life, father of your children and all that. So, I just want you to know I understand. If you want to tear it up, go ahead.",

        "Jack: Well, when I walked in this room, he had his hands all over you.",
        "Janet: I told you what that was all about --",
        "Jack: When I walked into the room where my children abide, there was a $200,000 check laying there, Janet. You know what? I am -- I am scared of him in this way. If we're ever left alone in a room together, I might pull out my gun and I might shoot him. And it might feel good.",
        "Janet: You won't do that. You want to know why?",

        "Janet: Yeah, well, so you got one up on Craig Montgomery. So, no matter how many checks he writes, your kids aren't going to get spoiled and they aren't going to get jaded. Because you won't let that happen.",
        "Jack: I can't stop what I don't see though. If I hadn't had to go see Carly's today -- I don't live there anymore. There's a huge chunk of my kids' lives that I'm not up to speed on. And if Craig Montgomery gets to spend a second with my children, that's a second too long. In my opinion. Especially when I don't know what's happening.",

        "Josie: Yeah, got that. And what about me? You want me to stay away from Johnny, too?",

        "Dusty: Stop beating it, would you? Not now.",
        "Josie: I cannot live my life according to your minute-by-minute approval rating. So if you want me around, say so. But if not, then you have to let me know.",

        "Josie: I hurt for you, Dusty. But I also hurt for Barbara. And Paul. And Johnny. I can't help it. That is just who I am. But you wouldn't know that because you never took the time to get to know the real me.",

        "Craig: Now that's efficient. Why use two words when one will suffice?",
