        "Gwen: I don't understand. Why can't I get pregnant? I mean, I'm doing everything right this time. I'm taking care of myself. I'm eating better. I quit smoking. I'm making up for all of the bad things that I did before.",
        "Dr. Schiller: And I applaud your efforts, Gwen. But this situation is more complicated than that. What you need to understand is that --",
        "Gwen: No, Dr. Schiller, this means everything to me. We have to have another baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: That was the last thing I expected you to do.",
        "Casey: I kind of surprised myself, yeah.",
        "Maddie: Just -- slow down. Slow down. What is the deal?",
        "Casey: The deal?",
        "Maddie: What, you have a bad day and you come to me to -- what, make you feel better? Is that it?",
        "Casey: What makes you think that?",
        "Maddie: I don't know, it's a pattern with you.",
        "Casey: What are you talking about? The moment was right and we took advantage of it, all right. We both did.",
        "Maddie: No, actually, you jumped me. I was just sitting here innocently, trying to be your friend --",
        "Casey: I jumped you?",
        "Maddie: I was trying to be your friend.",
        "Casey: All I did was kiss you. Which, by the way, you seemed to be enjoying. So, I don't know why are you're being so weird about it.",
        "Maddie: I don't want to be another notch in your bedpost.",
        "Casey: You know what, next time, why don't you just try to take --",
        "Maddie: Next -- next time? In your dreams, pal.",
        "Casey: Okay. This is so typical. You know what, Maddie? You know what your problem is? It's your attitude. That's why you don't have any friends.",
        "Maddie: That's funny. That's really funny coming from you. You are the king of the bad moods.",
        "Casey: Really? Then why do you keep finding reasons to hang out with me?",
        "Maddie: Why do I keep -- you know what? If you came out here because you were thinking about jumping, be my guest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hi, can I help you?",
        "Henry: I hope so. Henry Coleman. You remember me?",
        "Nick: Should I know you?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I was held prisoner in B.J. Green's wine cellar before he disappeared. And then I escaped just in time to catch your heroics at WOAK.",
        "Nick: Oh, yeah, that's right. Sorry, I didn't recognize you without your heels. That was a beautiful dress you were wearing.",
        "Henry: Oh, I know it was, thank you very much. I would've preferred a different color, but when you're disguised and running for your life, you really can't be choosy, can you?",
        "Nick: Yeah, I guess. Can I help you, Mr. Coleman?",
        "Henry: Well, yeah, I don't suppose you've found B.J. yet, have you?",
        "Nick: No, not yet. But it is just a matter of time.",
        "Henry: Really. 'Cause he could be anywhere. I don't think -- I don't think he would come back to Oakdale. Do you?",
        "Nick: Well, you really never can tell with guys like that. But if he's got a good enough reason, he might.",
        "Henry: And what would a good enough reason be?",
        "Nick: Don't worry, Mr. Coleman. We're not going to let anything happen to you. We've got your back. Yours and Katie Peretti's.",
        "Henry: I'm glad to hear that. And I wouldn't expect anything less from Oakdale's finest. That's just not exactly what I mean.",
        "Nick: Why don't you stop dancing around and tell me exactly what you do mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey, yourself. What's up?",
        "Carly: I've got some news and I couldn't talk to you about it over the phone.",
        "Jack: Good news? I sure could use some.",
        "Carly: I think it is good. Hal called. He wants to see you at the station ASAP, Jack. The report came in.",
        "Jack: From internal affairs?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. And he wants to talk to you about coming back to work.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hal, you asked me before if I was covering for Paul, and I swore to you I wasn't. You said you believed me. What's changed?",
        "Hal: I've been doing a lot of thinking about what you said and the way that you said it. Something's off.",
        "Emily: Why would I lie about the way he humiliated me? Especially to you. Why?",
        "Hal: Maybe because you're willing to do anything to help him escape. You don't care how bad it makes you look.",
        "Emily: The man left me standing in my wedding dress. Why on earth would I help him do anything?",
        "Hal: That's what I've been trying to figure out. See, I know you too well, Em. You're not acting like a person whose heart's been broken. You're acting like a person who's scared. Scared to death that I might find something. And you know what? I will. So why don't you tell me right now and save me the trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You told Dusty and Hal about Jennifer's baby?",
        "Meg: That's right. I told them that I suddenly noticed a discrepancy in one of the blood tests and there was no way Gwen was the mother. And that's all it took to put them on the right track.",
        "Paul: Why would you do that? You had to know that that would cost you Dusty.",
        "Meg: I wanted to keep my involvement out of it. But I couldn't. And yeah, it cost me Dusty.",
        "Paul: Why would you do something so stupid?",
        "Meg: To right a wrong, Paul!",
        "Paul: Oh, come on!",
        "Meg: I wouldn't expect you to understand.",
        "Paul: Oh, no, I understand! God! I understand perfectly, Meg. Your sudden burst of conscience has made your life as bad as mine. Now, tell me something, Meg. Was it worth it? Was it everything that you hoped for?",
        "Meg: You know what, Paul? Keep your million bucks and go to hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Is it me? I mean, is it something that I did wrong? I mean, I'll do whatever I have to, to fix it. Just don't tell me I can't have children.",
        "Will: Well, why don't you explain to us exactly what the problem is?",
        "Dr. Schiller: You mentioned that you had taken a serious fall recently.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, a couple of months ago in New York. I fell down a flight of steps in a park.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Right, were you taken to a hospital?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but I didn't hang around that long.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Oh, well, that would explain why perhaps they didn't catch it.",
        "Will: Catch what?",
        "Dr. Schiller: A concussion. If they didn't do a C.A.T. Scan before you left the hospital, it would have most likely gone undetected.",
        "Gwen: Okay, even if I had a concussion, what does that have to do with whether or not I can have a child now?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, a lot, actually. There was some -- there was some damage done to your pituitary gland.",
        "Will: Which means what?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, the pituitary helps to control reproductive hormones in the body. And in your case, those hormones are no longer being produced.",
        "Gwen: Well, what do I do to fix it? I mean, there has to be something.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Well, that's what we're going to discuss. [Pager beeps] Oh, excuse me. I will be right back with you. I'm very sorry, I have to return this call first.",
        "Gwen: This can't be happening.",
        "Will: Look, Dr. Schiller just said that there were things we can do.",
        "Gwen: She didn't say there was any guarantee. What if I can never have children, Will?",
        "Will: Let's just wait to find out more first before we get all upset. And we'll figure this out, okay? I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Look, it was a stupid kiss, all right? I don't see why you're such a big deal about it.",
        "Maddie: I'm not, as long as you don't.",
        "Casey: All right, it ju -- it just happened, okay? It's not like I'm declaring my undying love for you or anything, if that's what you're worried about.",
        "Maddie: Well, good.",
        "Casey: I mean, you wouldn't want me to get all \"chick flick\" on you now, would you?",
        "Maddie: Bite your tongue.",
        "Casey: So, let's just say it was a mistake and leave it at that.",
        "Maddie: I already have.",
        "Casey: Me, too.",
        "Maddie: It's a good thing I'm moving out soon. And Henry's back, he's looking for a place for us.",
        "Casey: Bet you can't wait.",
        "Maddie: Makes two of us, right?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Yeah, I guess.",
        "Maddie: I mean, the last thing we need is for us thinking -- getting the wrong idea about each other.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Maddie: Right. I have to go. I'm late for meeting Henry.",
        "Casey: All right, yeah. Don't let me stop you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You know, it's not my safety that I'm worried about. I can handle B.J.",
        "Nick: Really?",
        "Henry: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, I let myself be held prisoner by him for so long because I was trying to protect my little sister, Maddie. She crossed him on a couple of occasions and I'm just -- I'm worried that he might still have it in for her.",
        "Nick: Listen, Henry. If B.J. Green plans on going back into Oakdale, which I doubt he will, we're going to stop him before he can cause anymore harm.",
        "Henry: Okay. Well, you make that sound very easy. But I gotta tell you -- I gotta warn you, he's as wily as they come.",
        "Nick: Yeah, well, I don't doubt it. All right? I'm here now. This is not going to happen this time around.",
        "Henry: Okay. Supercop.",
        "Nick: Nothing super about it. I'm just good at what I do.",
        "Henry: Well, I'm sure you are, but so is B.J. and I hope we don't have to find out who is better.",
        "Nick: He took a large sum of money out of the bank before he left.",
        "Henry: Really. How much?",
        "Nick: Well, enough to get halfway across world. I mean, that's what I think.",
        "Henry: You think he's heading -- well, that seems -- that makes sense, doesn't it? But just suppose -- just for sake of argument, okay? Just suppose that he was brazen enough to come back and spend some of that money in the good old U.S. of A.? How would you know that? Would you, like, track the serial numbers or --",
        "Nick: How many times do I have to explain this to you? It's not an issue.",
        "Henry: But that's not an answer.",
        "Nick: And if he spent a dime, we would know about it.",
        "Henry: Psychic powers?",
        "Nick: When it comes to catching bad guys, I guess I do have a sixth sense.",
        "Henry: Oh, and modest to boot.",
        "Nick: And is there anything else I can help you with, Mr. Coleman?",
        "Henry: It's Henry. And no. No, no. You know, you have given me a world of reassurances on so many things. A million things, as a matter of fact. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Did you talk to Hal?",
        "Jack: No, he wasn't there. I left a message that I'd stop by later.",
        "Carly: And get your job back.",
        "Jack: Let's not jump the gun. Nick Kasnoff has my job. What are they going to do, fire him after the first day?",
        "Carly: Maybe. Hopefully.",
        "Jack: Give the guy a chance.",
        "Carly: Why? He's smug and he's full of himself, and he's not half the cop that you are.",
        "Jack: Yes, and not to mention that he's got my job now. So --",
        "Carly: Maybe Hal will give you a better job.",
        "Jack: Honey --",
        "Carly: 'Cause he knows just as well as everybody else that you are just as much of a hero as this Nick Kasnoff is for stopping that --",
        "Jack: Well, he hired the guy. Obviously, he come with a strong rep.",
        "Carly: Rep. I don't care about that. He's got your job, Jack. I think that's criminal.",
        "Jack: Well, and I'm under investigation for breaking the law.",
        "Carly: That's my fault. I led you astray.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I'm sure that's way the IA guy saw it.",
        "Carly: Well, if they're family men, they should understand.",
        "Jack: All right, we'll know soon enough.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: I'll see you when I see you.",
        "Carly: Okay, good-bye. Good luck.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Carly: I love you.",
        "Jack: Love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What do you want? You want more? Give me a number.",
        "Meg: Forget it. Standing here listening to you reminded me that loyalty and love mean a lot more than money. I don't want to be like you, Paul.",
        "Paul: I'm afraid you've passed the point of no return on that one.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah? And how do you figure that, Paul? Huh? I'd say you are a lot more isolated than I am. At least I have my family. Everyone turned on you, even Emily.",
        "Paul: Oh, I know. I drove Emily away deliberately to save her.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah. And she shot you for it. You know, I have no reason to keep that under wraps anymore.",
        "Paul: No, Meg, wait. No, no, no, wait. Meg, please, don't! Please! Look, you want to make me suffer, fine. That's fine. But please, leave Emily out of this, okay? I've put her through enough.",
        "Meg: And how 'bout what you put me through, Paul? Huh?",
        "Paul: $1 million, okay? It's not too shabby for an apology.",
        "Meg: You just don't get it, do you?",
        "Paul: When I got caught, I could have ratted you out. You could've been facing the same charges I was, but I didn't turn my back on you. And that's loyalty in my book.",
        "Meg: I guess you're right.",
        "Paul: Great! Ow! Will you please tell me what we're arguing about?",
        "Meg: Freedom! Freedom, Paul. I have nothing to lose because I have no secrets anymore. I might be alone, okay, but at least I can rebuild my life. Can you say the same thing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: What is it you don't want me to find out?",
        "Emily: You're imagining things.",
        "Hal: Am I? I'm still trying to figure out why Paul never went back to his apartment, and did I mention that his passport is still there? That seems odd to me. Unless he's waiting for you to bring it to him.",
        "Emily: For the last time, I don't know. Okay, he dumped me, he left, he's disappeared, that's all I know.",
        "Hal: If you only knew how badly I want to believe you.",
        "Emily: Well, then stop hounding me! You're suckin' the life out of me, here. I am not yours to protect and I am not yours to condemn. So just -- for the love of God, just leave me alone. Just leave me alone!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Maybe we're not supposed to be parents.",
        "Will: That's not true. But maybe we're not as ready as we should be.",
        "Gwen: What do you mean?",
        "Will: Our lives are kind of a mess right now.",
        "Gwen: Are you trying to cheer me up?",
        "Will: All I'm saying is that maybe we need to take a little time to get ourselves straightened out before we become parents.",
        "Gwen: Okay, let's say we go back to school, that we get jobs, a place to live and everything's going great -- what's the point if we can never have kids?",
        "Will: Okay, even if that is true, and that doesn't mean it is -- then there are other options. Like adoption. Look at Carly. She's got J.J. and she loves him like he's one of her own, okay? So no matter what the news is, we're going to make the best of it, all right?",
        "Gwen: When you put it that way --",
        "Barbara: Well, what a surprise. Don't you tell me that you've gotten yourself pregnant again. Ruining Casey Hughes' life wasn't enough for you? Now you want to do the same thing to my son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Hey, I'm so sorry I'm late.",
        "Henry: It's not a problem. I just got here myself. You all right? You look like you're flustered.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine. Just the sooner I get out of the Hughes' house, the happier I will be.",
        "Henry: What do you mean, sooner? I thought you -- I thought everything was okay over there.",
        "Maddie: Okay is a slippery slope.",
        "Henry: Ah, you don't have to tell me. You gotta watch your footing. I'm sorry, babe. This is my fault that you're over there in the first place.",
        "Maddie: No, Mr. and Mrs. Hughes are fine. They're great. It's just Casey. He's -- ugh!",
        "Henry: Ugh, ugh, teenage boys.",
        "Maddie: Yes.",
        "Henry: Yes, no explanation needed. I totally understand. Listen, I got some good news, though. It looks like we can safely start looking for a place of our own.",
        "Maddie: Really?",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm.",
        "Maddie: So, the money, they won't be able to trace it?",
        "Henry: No. I went by the police station and I got the lowdown from sergeant Joe Friday.",
        "Maddie: Who?",
        "Henry: Nick Kasnoff.",
        "Maddie: You just said Joe Friday.",
        "Henry: It's an old cop show, honey. It's before your time. It's before my time, actually. Anyway, anyway, what he said was he didn't think there was a chance in the world that B.J. would show his face in Oakdale again.",
        "Maddie: Not even to retrieve $1 million?",
        "Henry: That's chump change for him, sweetheart. He's probably got accounts in banks all over the world. He probably owns his own bank. He will not miss the money, all right? Trust me on this.",
        "Maddie: And the money's safe to spend?",
        "Henry: Reasonably safe, yeah.",
        "Maddie: Henry!",
        "Henry: Listen, we need a place to live. We will be modest. We will not go overboard. We will not call attention to ourselves. All right? And if we play our cards right, no one will be the wiser.",
        "Maddie: Hmm-mm, no. We can't. Forget it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #1: Hey, detective, how's it going?",
        "Jack: Oh, I'm doing well. Thank you.",
        "Cop #2: I heard you got shot during that ruckus at WOAK.",
        "Jack: It's no big deal. I'm fine.",
        "Cop #2: So, when are you coming back to work?",
        "Cop #1: We miss you.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's very nice. I miss you, too. Hal around?",
        "Cop #2: No, but he should be back soon.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. I'll just wait.",
        "Cop #2: Yep.",
        "Nick: Excuse me.",
        "Jack: Uh, yeah.",
        "Nick: Detective Kasnoff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Hal, she's told you everything she can. She has no reason to lie to you.",
        "Hal: We've got an APB out on Paul. When we catch him, everything will come out into the open.",
        "Emily: I wish you wouldn't just -- I wish you wouldn't go after him. Can't -- can't you just let him go?",
        "Hal: See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. You want me to let Paul escape. So why should I believe you weren't behind this in the first place?",
        "Emily: I just want this to go away! I just want this to all go away, okay? And if you go after him, and you catch him, there's going to be a trial. And if there's a trial, I gotta testify. And the last thing I want is to ever have to look into that man's face again. Not after what he's done to me.",
        "Hal: So I should just forget that I'm a cop and let a fugitive jump bail? No, sorry. I'm not sticking my neck out for you anymore.",
        "Emily: Fine. But he's going to be long gone. You're never going to catch him.",
        "Hal: Oh, I'll catch him. You can count on it. And if I find out that you helped him escape, I will show you no mercy this time. You will go to jail.",
        "Susan: Emily, swear to me you're telling Hal the truth.",
        "Emily: I did not help Paul escape. But Paul's gone, and we're never going to see him again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: If you walk out that door, Meg, I might not make it. Do you really want murder on your conscience along with everything else you've done?",
        "Meg: I didn't shoot you.",
        "Paul: You're a nurse. You can help me.",
        "Meg: Not anymore, Paul. Thanks to you.",
        "Paul: You took an oath. I know that still means something to you.",
        "Meg: Stop pretending that you know me so well.",
        "Paul: I know that you won't leave me here knowing that I could die.",
        "Meg: I've done everything I can. I even offered to call 911.",
        "Meg: Have no stake in your living or dying whatsoever! At this point, Paul, there is nothing, nothing, you can do for me that will make helping you worth my while.",
        "Paul: Wanna bet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Carly: Jack's coming back to the force.",
        "Jack: Carly, you shouldn't have done this.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on, baby. Don't be so modest.",

        "Paul: Easy. I'll tell everyone that you had no choice but to help me. I'll tell them that I forced you. That I blackmailed you. That I threatened you. Whatever you want. You write out a confession and I'll sign it. I'll tell them that I dragged you up here at gunpoint to help patch me up. You get everything you want plus the money on top of it. It's the deal of a century, Meg. You would be crazy to say no.",

        "Emily: Hal's the one I'm worried about. I mean, he just won't let me go. One minute he's begging me to let me -- let me be helped by him, and the next he's threatening to crucify me.",
        "Susan: You haven't made things easy for him.",
        "Emily: You know what, and you don't make things easy for me by calling him all the time. No, just -- you can't keep hoping that he's gonna bail me out.",
        "Susan: Honey, he kept you out of jail. He convinced his own daughter to drop the charges. He still loves you.",
        "Emily: Loves me? He threatened to throw me back into jail. Loves me. Mother, you've got to accept the fact that he is not my husband anymore. Okay? Or my watchdog. Or my guardian angel, okay? I don't want his help and I can't stand the man's anger anymore, so just let it go! I want to handle my problems on my own.",
        "Susan: Okay, okay. You look like you need some rest.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. I am just exhausted, you know? And I just want to go home. You know what? I need a walk. I think some fresh air -- I need some fresh air.",
        "Susan: Oh, oh. You're not going back to Paul's place, are you? I can pick up anything you need after my shift at work.",
        "Emily: Okay. Okay. I'll wait for you.",

        "Hal: She says she doesn't know anything.",
        "Jack: You don't believe her?",
        "Hal: I want to, but at this point, I just don't know. You don't have to worry about any of this.",
        "Jack: But Carly said you heard from IA.",
        "Hal: That's right. They're not recommending a dismissal. [Jack sighs] That's the good news.",
        "Jack: And the bad news?",
        "Hal: You may be clear with them, Jack, but you're still not clear with me. You crossed the line, Jack. You betrayed my trust. And I know you were protecting Carly.",

Now, the best I can offer you is a part-time job helping out on investigations when we're shorthanded. Now, obviously, that's gonna be a cut in pay, but it's the best I can do, Jack. I'm sorry.",

        "Will: She's not. She's not pregnant. Dr. Schiller just gave her the news.",

        "Will: No, we're staying so we can talk to Dr. Schiller. Maybe you should go.",

        "Gwen: Ms. Ryan, I was a good mom to Billy, before they took him away. And I will be a good mom to our child, too.",
        "Will: You know what? You're going to get that chance. We're not losing faith. And when that day comes and we find out that we are having a child, no one is going to tell us that we can't.",

        "Will: What I think about that is none of your business.",
        "Barbara: It's completely my business! I am your mother and I care about your future and I want to help you!",

        "Carly: I beg your pardon?",
        "Nick: Wasn't the reason Jack lost his job was because he was trying to keep you out of trouble?",
        "Carly: Jack puts his family first. Being on your own, I don't expect that you'd understand something like that.",
        "Nick: Well, there are some advantages of being on my own. I can put everything I need to into my work. That's why I'm so good at it. I have no distractions.",

        "Jack: That's all that was available.",
        "Nick: Yeah, sorry about that.",

        "Nick: I already did that. Your boxes are in the locker room.",
        "Jack: Okay, well, then I'll grab them and we can go.",

        "Meg: Yeah, for now. Okay, you were right, I can't watch you die. But my help is going to cost you.",

        "Meg: Do you got any cash on you?",

        "Will: Mom, I am thinking more clear now than I have in a long time.",
