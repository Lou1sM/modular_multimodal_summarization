        "Carly and Sam share an awkward moment. Katie accepts Brad's apology because she is too preoccupied with her upcoming breakfast date with Joe. Brad is depressed as he watches them together. Meg tries to ignore Craig, but he calls the Farm, as she tries to blow him off. Craig apologizes for his past behavior. Holden catches Meg in a lie. Rosanna comes home to find a furious Paul, who tells her that he knows that she switched the DNA results. Paul breaks up with Rosanna, as she pleads with him to stay to no avail. Paul overhears Rosanna mumbling about wishing Craig had succeeded in killing his baby because then there would never have been this problem. Paul promises that Craig is a dead man. Meg explains to Holden what Craig tried to do to her, but she makes him promise not to tell Paul because she is worried what he would do to Craig. Sam seems to be increasingly interested in Carly. Brad wants to come up with a plan to get Katie back, but Henry doesn't want to help because he thinks it is hopeless because he can't make Katie love him. Meg tells Holden that she and Paul are heading out of town. Holden wonders if Paul and Craig aren't one in the same with their thirst for revenge? He hopes that Paul never finds out what Craig tried to do because anything he may have promised her would go down the drain. Katie and Joe talk about relationships, past and present. They seem to be hitting it off and on the same page, but then Katie sees Brad telling her a joke instead of Joe. Rosanna tells Craig that Paul and Meg know the whole truth. Paul tells Barbara that he is going to be a father, but then admits his plan for Craig after learning what he tried to do to his baby. Barbara tries to talk him out of it and calm him down, but Paul will not be assuaged. Barbara tells him that she will stop Craig for him. No, Paul will finish this himself between he and Craig. Katie tells Joe that she doesn't think she is ready to date him, and then calls an elated Brad to ask him to hang out and play video games. Craig goes to see Meg and tells her that he knows she is aware of what he tried to do; Meg unleashes her fury at him and tells him that she will never forgive him, as Craig promises that he will never lose her to Paul. Holden holds a shotgun on Craig."

        "Waiter: May I get you anything else, Ms. Peretti?",
        "Katie: Oh, this'll be fine for now, Jimmy. I'm going to wait to order. Thanks.",
        "Brad: Can't improve on perfection.",
        "Katie: Get out of here, Brad. I'm not speaking to you.",
        "Brad: Will you give me a break?",
        "Katie: It's hard enough to sign up for speed dating, but to have you completely manipulate the whole thing -- it was utterly humiliating. And I caught you red-handed so don't try to deny it.",
        "Brad: Guilty as charged.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: I messed with the results. I know it was wrong. That's why I'm here. To apologize from the bottom of my heart.",
        "Katie: What are you up to?",
        "Brad: Nothing. Nothing, nothing, I swear. I even brought a peace offering. Fresh out of the oven.",
        "Katie: I have to admit, you make it very hard to stay mad at you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Sam! I didn't realize you were around. I -- I was trying to take a shower and the water --",
        "Sam: And the water's freezing.",
        "Carly: Cold --",
        "Sam: I know. I know. You have a broken valve on the water heater. I just fixed it, though. It's no problem.",
        "Carly: You fixed the water heater just like that?",
        "Sam: Yeah, yeah, it's all done. You'll have to wait a couple of minutes though, before the water heats up. It should be as good as new.",
        "Carly: Oh, you're a lifesaver.",
        "Sam: Well, first time I ever heard that.",
        "Carly: When it comes to doing things around the house, I am completely useless. It's -- it's nice to have a man here again. Okay, well, I'm going to go finish up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I know you like them extra goopy. That's why I had them made special for you.",
        "Katie: You don't play fair, Brad Snyder.",
        "Brad: Okay, what I did was pretty low and I don't expect you to forgive me. That's why I want you to know that I'm really sorry. And that it will never happen again.",
        "Katie: I think I can maybe forgive you just this once.",
        "Brad: That'd be great. I mean, I was worried that you were never going to speak to me again --",
        "Katie: Apology accepted.",
        "Brad: Wow, I mean, I was expecting you to rip me to shreds, really.",
        "Katie: I would, but it turns out last night wasn't a total bust.",
        "Joe: Morning, beautiful.",
        "Katie: Oh.",

        "Meg: Snyder residence.",
        "Craig: Wake up, sleepyhead.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Craig: I've been calling you since 7:00. You never sleep this late.",
        "Meg: I was -- I was taking care of Mama.",
        "Craig: Is Emma all right?",
        "Meg: Uh, yeah -- yeah, she's fine. Just a little under the weather.",
        "Craig: And you and the baby?",
        "Meg: We're fine. We're fine, Craig. Look, I've got to go.",
        "Craig: If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to avoid me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paul remembering]",
        "Paul: I guess the million dollar question is who switched the DNA results? My money's on Craig.",
        "Meg: Um, Rosanna.",
        "Paul: No, that's impossible. Why would Rosanna have anything to do with this?",
        "Meg: Because Craig was initially excited about the DNA results. And it was just recently that everything just shifted. I mean, just yesterday --",
        "Paul: He went crazy with the doll.",
        "Meg: And then Rosanna went to see Craig to to defend you.",
        "Paul: Why didn't you tell me this earlier?",
        "Meg: Because none of this made sense before. But now, it would make a lot of sense that Rosanna switched the results.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Paul? Sweetheart?",
        "Paul: What are you doing here?",
        "Rosanna: I cut my trip short because I missed you so much. Don't I get a kiss?",
        "Paul: Stay away from me.",
        "Rosanna: Paul?",
        "Paul: I know what you've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I'm not avoiding you. I was up with Mama all night.",
        "Craig: Well, okay, I just don't -- not sure that being around the flu or -- whatever's bothering Emma is such a good idea right now.",
        "Meg: I'll be fine.",
        "Craig: I know you can take care of yourself, please indulge me. Let me bring you breakfast.",
        "Meg: No. No, Mama's not well enough for company.",
        "Craig: I'll just drop it off.",
        "Meg: Craig, please -- I'm tired. I'm going to try and get some sleep.",
        "Craig: Okay. But if you can manage to drag yourself away, I would like to meet with the contractor about the nursery. I know that I haven't been on my best behavior lately. This whole fatherhood thing has got me kind of tied up in knots. But I -- I really want to be a good father to -- our child. At least, I want to try.",
        "Meg: Craig.",
        "Craig: Go to sleep. And come home soon. I'm looking forward to making plans for the baby.",
        "Meg: I can't get away until Mama's feeling better, Craig. I have to go.",
        "Holden: Mama's not sick. Why would you lie to your husband like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You switched the results for Meg's paternity test.",
        "Rosanna: What? Paul, that's absurd.",
        "Paul: Don't bother lying to me. I already know the truth.",
        "Rosanna: What -- what are you saying? Wait, you're the baby's father? Craig -- Craig isn't the baby's --",
        "Paul: I think you already know the answer to that.",
        "Rosanna: Oh my God.",
        "Paul: Stop it. Stop. You've been jealous of Meg since the moment we got back to town.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you slept with her. Proving my jealousy was founded. I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm your wife. You're my husband. I love you. You'd feel the same way.",
        "Paul: You knew that if Meg were having my baby, that I would walk out. You didn't want that to happen. So you did everything you could. You fixed it. You made it so that Meg was having Craig's baby. Figured I -- I would leave them alone. So how did you do it? A few dollars, a few keystrokes? Is that all it cost for you to erase my son from my life?",
        "Rosanna: Look, I would never do that to you.",
        "Paul: You were at the hospital the day we did the testing.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I was unconscious! I didn't even know they were testing. I didn't know what was happening. How could I switch the tests?",
        "Paul: Right. You snuck back into your room. I saw you. Is that when you did it? You know what? Don't even bother. Don't lie to me. I already know the truth. I had another DNA test. I'm going to be a father.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know what to say.",
        "Paul: Well, why don't you start by telling me the truth for a change?",
        "Rosanna: All right, it's true. I did switch the paternity tests. But I did it because I knew that if you found out, that you would leave. And I -- I couldn't let that happen. I can't lose you, Paul.",
        "Paul: It's too late. You already have.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no. I cannot let you go.",
        "Paul: You don't have a choice in the matter.",
        "Rosanna: Meg doesn't need you. She has her family, she has Craig.",
        "Paul: Oh, okay. So I'm just what? Supposed to let them have my child?",
        "Rosanna: Look, you -- you saved my life. You brought me out of a coma. And not just once. Every time that I was slipping away, you were there for me, calling me back. The same way I called you back when you were dying. You can't just walk away. Our lives depend on each other.",
        "Paul: I should've let you go when I had the chance.",
        "Rosanna: No, you couldn't do that. Because you know that we are connected. I am the soul mate. I am the one. Not Meg. She's just a temporary replacement. Have you forgotten how hurt you were when she married Craig?",
        "Paul: She only married Craig for me.",
        "Rosanna: No -- and when you came back, by the way, she stayed with him. Do you remember that? Not only did she stay with him, she slept with him. She made love to him. Okay, she slept with you, too, but she slept with him. She two- timed both of you. Any woman who truly loved you --",
        "Paul: You tried to keep my child from me!",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.",
        "Paul: Don't! Don't! Don't you ask me for forgiveness. What you've done is unforgivable. It's over. I'm in love with Meg. We're going to raise our child together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What's going on, Meg? Why'd you lie to Craig just now?",
        "Meg: It's complicated.",
        "Holden: Lies don't make things any easier. They ruined my marriage.",
        "Meg: Well, you can't compare me and Craig to what happened to you.",
        "Holden: Maybe not. But you're having a baby with this guy. And you would not walk out on him for no reason. What aren't you telling me?",
        "Meg: Craig and I are over. I just haven't figured out a way to tell him.",
        "Holden: Hmm. And you're hiding out?",
        "Meg: I don't know what else to do.",
        "Holden: Did he hurt you? Are you afraid that he might?",
        "Meg: He's not the father of my baby, Paul is.",
        "Holden: I see. Does Craig know this?",
        "Meg: He found out. I had a paternity test done a little while ago. And it said Craig was the father, but someone switched the results.",
        "Holden: Who would do that?",
        "Meg: Rosanna.",
        "Holden: Of course, because she wants Paul for herself.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Okay, if I tell you something, do you swear not to tell Paul?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Meg: You have to swear. Please, Holden. I need to tell someone. But if Paul found out, he would kill Craig.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Meg: Craig tried to kill my baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You are no better than I am. Yes, switching the test results was wrong. But you did the same thing to Jennifer. I mean, you let your own sister think her baby was dead!",
        "Paul: To protect her from Craig! Craig destroys children. I did what I had to do to keep Johnny safe.",
        "Rosanna: So wait -- you're telling me that in your case, keeping a child from its parent is forgivable, but in mine it's a cardinal sin?",
        "Paul: I took a child away from Craig. And you -- you gave my child, my flesh and blood, to Craig, knowing what a nightmare life that might make for him! How am I ever going to forgive you for that?",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's just the thing about forgiveness. You just do it.",
        "Paul: No, I'm not a saint.",
        "Rosanna: That's my point. We're alike. Don't my motives make any difference?",
        "Paul: You're selfish and needy. Those are not virtues.",
        "Rosanna: No, I did what I did out of love. My motive was love. Pure love.",
        "Paul: For yourself.",
        "Rosanna: No. Look, Jennifer forgave you. What you did to her was terrible, but she understood that you were just protecting her. The same way I was protecting you. Out of love.",
        "Paul: You don't know the meaning of the word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Brad, I'll see you at work.",
        "Brad: You have a good breakfast. You take care.",
        "Katie: I am in good hands.",
        "Joe: Oh. Oh my. Do you always start the day with dessert?",
        "Katie: Well, I think it was Brad's idea of a peace offering.",
        "Joe: Oh. Did it work?",
        "Katie: I don't know. But it doesn't matter. We shouldn't let him ruin our morning, too.",
        "Joe: I guess what I was asking was, is he my competition? 'Cause he tried pretty hard to keep us from hooking up.",
        "Katie: That won't happen again. Actually Brad and I did have a casual thing, but I broke it off.",
        "Joe: Recently?",
        "Katie: I'm not interested in anything casual actually. I want a relationship.",
        "Joe: So do I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Good morning, Sunshine. What can I getcha?",
        "Brad: Table for one.",
        "Henry: Okay, here you go. Do you want coffee or just straight hemlock?",
        "Brad: Love bites, man. Love bites. Katie's dating other guys.",
        "Henry: Well, you two were never officially dating in the first place.",
        "Brad: She just never wanted to admit it, Henry. But, you know, things were going great most of the time. Until she met the fireman.",
        "Henry: The fireman? Oh I am so sorry. Women love firemen. It's a law of nature or something.",
        "Brad: You know, if you're not going to help me, you can leave.",
        "Henry: I'm trying to be empathetic here.",
        "Brad: I need ideas. Not pity.",
        "Henry: What -- what kind of ideas?",
        "Brad: I'm not giving Katie up without a fight.",
        "Henry: Got it. Okay, I have something in the kitchen I need to take care of --",
        "Brad: No man, no. You can't leave me alone in this condition.",
        "Henry: I really do have something --",
        "Brad: I'm freaking out here! No, I need an idea guy. You need to sit your butt down and start brainstorming with me. Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Whoa! You clean up good.",
        "Carly: Oh, thanks.",
        "Sam: Sorry about before. With the towel.",
        "Carly: Oh no, don't. Don't even mention it. You fixed the water heater. A cold shower would have been a lot worse.",
        "Sam: I know. It's weird, you know, having a strange man in your house all the time. I mean, when Kit was here, it was okay, but --",
        "Carly: No, you know what? We're working it out, right? Any word on Kit's case?",
        "Sam: Here, let me help you. Um, no. They haven't set a court date yet. You know the wheels of justice. They're square. [Carly laughs] So, it could be a while before she comes back.",
        "Carly: We should send her a care package.",
        "Sam: Oh, definitely.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Sam: A cake with a file in it. Seriously, Carly. I know Jack hates me being here. I mean, you can't see the kids --",
        "Carly: Well, he was okay with you staying for pizza last night, right?",
        "Sam: Yeah, yeah. And Parker was, of course, thrilled with it.",
        "Carly: Parker was okay. He can be a lot worse than that when he wants to be, believe me.",
        "Sam: I know where he's coming from. I mean, he's just out to protect his mom.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm the mom. So I'm the one that gets to do the protecting. Besides, Sage had a wonderful time. She just loved singing with Cowboy Jack here.",
        "Sam: I always like watching kids, you know, during the act, because, I mean, of course they know he's a dummy at first, but then it is -- after a few minutes they start talking to him like he's flesh and blood. Especially special kids like Sage.",
        "Carly: Yeah, she is special.",
        "Sam: I really like it here.",
        "Carly: And I like you being here. Between Metro and all the help around here, you are definitely earning your keep.",
        "Sam: I mean -- I don't have to stay. I mean, I could find a place of my own --",
        "Carly: No, no, Sam. I want you to stay.",
        "Sam: You're really being nice letting me stay here.",
        "Carly: Well, only partly. You could be making good money some place else. And the truth is, I can't afford to pay you enough right now for you to get your own place.",
        "Sam: Yeah, it's definitely pricier here than Idaho, that's for sure.",
        "Carly: Hey, well its 2008, right? We can be housemates without raising eyebrows, huh?",
        "Sam: Yeah. I can, if you can.",
        "Carly: Well, I can. As long as we don't mention the towel --",
        "Sam: Towel incident.",
        "Carly: Ever again, because really I -- I don't want to get on Kit's bad side, if you know what I mean.",
        "Sam: Kit? What about detective do-right? He would crucify me if he ever found out.",
        "Carly: Jack would definitely not approve.",
        "Sam: It'll be our little secret.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I refuse, Bradley. I will not use another person's identity to stalk Katie in the blogosphere.",
        "Brad: See how you just did that? Blogosphere. Identity theft. You're a born cyber-stalker, Henry. Come on. Come on, show me how to start a blog.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. You do not want to do this. No.",
        "Brad: I am fighting for Katie.",
        "Henry: It's not going to do you any good if you end up in Statesville for fraud and God knows what else.",
        "Brad: See, that's why I need you. You are so much sneakier than I am.",
        "Henry: Read my lips, okay? Do not interfere. If you do, if you do -- Katie won't like it. Ergo, she will not like you.",
        "Brad: Did I mention that he was Mr. February?",
        "Henry: That's the guy she's dating?",
        "Brad: Mm-hmm.",
        "Henry: Wow. Yeah, I saw the calendar. Brad, listen to me -- listen to me, Bradley. I've been in your position before, okay? I was in love with Katie. I even managed to marry the girl. She was not into me.",
        "Brad: That is you! That is you!",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no. That is Katie. That is Katie. No matter how much I -- what I did, how much I loved her, she could not love me back. Some things aren't meant to be.",
        "Brad: So what are you saying?",
        "Henry: I'm saying that you don't want to push this girl.",
        "Brad: Okay, so you think I should play hard to get?",
        "Henry: I think you shouldn't play at all!",
        "Brad: No, okay, you know what? I like the blog idea. I'm a doer. So let's just start blogging.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no. I will not let you use the internet to perpetrate some kind of crime. No!",
        "Brad: Come on, live dangerously, just for once.",
        "Henry: I live with Vienna, don't you think that's dangerous enough?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joe: I was really in love with my last girlfriend, but she just couldn't get over her ex.",
        "Katie: That sounds exactly like what just happened to me. I love this great guy, but he cannot make a clean break from his ex. And she's the mother of his children, so it's not like they can ignore each other.",
        "Joe: Well, kids make it rough.",
        "Katie: I know. They're great, though. I didn't mean to make it sound like the kids were the problem.",
        "Joe: No, I get it. It's a bad scene. Do you want kids?",
        "Katie: Definitely.",
        "Joe: Me, too.",
        "Katie: That's great. I mean, for me, I guess that would be kind of a deal breaker.",
        "Joe: Can I ask you one thing?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Joe: When you were talking about your ex just now, you said you love him. Present tense. Be honest, Katie. Are you still in love with the guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: This is all about you, isn't it? You can't have a child, so you're going to make sure no one else has one either.",
        "Rosanna: What?",
        "Paul: I know you.",
        "Rosanna: No!",
        "Paul: I know you, Rosanna. I know how you think. You want something, and for some reason, if you can't have it, you'll be damned if you'll let anyone else have it either.",
        "Rosanna: How can you even think of leaving me for Meg? She has brought you nothing but misery. And by the way, if I could remind you, you loved me first. If Craig hadn't put me in that coma, you wouldn't even have given her a second look.",
        "Paul: Well, I did give her a second look, and we fell in love again. We're not going to go back in time and change that.",
        "Rosanna: Time means nothing when it comes to us. I mean, look at everything that we've been through, and we're still here. We're married. We're meant to be.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well if that were true, you wouldn't have to lie to keep me around.",
        "Rosanna: What about the vows? What about the vows that we took, okay? This time, we swore this time it would be forever.",
        "Paul: I really thought we had a shot at that.",
        "Rosanna: Well, we do. We still do.",
        "Paul: Rosanna, you lied to me, and not about something small. You tried to keep me from my son. It's over. I will never forgive you.",

        "Meg: It happened just before Christmas. Mama invited us here for dinner, but we couldn't come because Craig had planned a romantic evening at the hotel. I thought. He found a drug that induces miscarriages and he put it in my drink. And thank goodness, he knocked it out of my hand just in time. But the drug was so poisonous, Craig had a cut, and it infected the cut. My baby never would have survived.",
        "Holden: Well, at least you and the baby are okay.",
        "Meg: But for how long? I really cared about Craig. More and more every day. And I was really looking forward to having a family with him. I should have known better than to think he would have changed.",
        "Holden: All right, well, now we know the truth. We need to keep you and the baby away from Craig.",
        "Meg: I know. It's dangerous for me to stay here. That's why Paul and I are leaving town. We need to get as far away from Craig and Rosanna as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: So that's it? A unilateral decision on your part, no discussion, I have no say in the matter, I just have to accept it?",
        "Paul: I don't care about you anymore. All I care about is Meg and our baby.",
        "Rosanna: That damn baby. I wish Craig had killed it. No baby, no problem.",
        "Paul: Did Craig try to kill my son? He's a dead man.",
        "Rosanna: Paul, don't! Please. Don't do something that you're going to regret.",
        "Paul: It's too late for that.",
        "Rosanna: Please, please you're not thinking straight, okay? Please just don't leave me. I need you. We belong together.",
        "Paul: Not any more. I never want to see you again.",
        "Rosanna: Paul, please, don't go!",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Don't think about Paul right now. That's probably not a good place for you, either.",
        "Meg: He would never hurt me the way Craig did.",
        "Holden: You know, your love life is your business. But, I'm worried about your safety.",
        "Meg: I'm fine.",
        "Holden: What about the baby? You're under a lot of stress right now. Well, we need to at least keep you away from Craig.",
        "Meg: That won't be easy.",
        "Holden: You can stay out here at the farm.",
        "Meg: I know what you're trying to do. But I can't stay here. I need to be with the father of my child.",
        "Holden: He's still with Rosanna.",
        "Meg: Not for much longer.",
        "Holden: Meg, I know what you're trying to do. You want to try and do what's best for your baby. Do you really see yourself with Paul after everything that you have done to each other? All the pain that you have caused each other? Do you really want that? I don't think you do.",
        "Meg: It's where I need to be, Holden.",
        "Holden: Paul is angry. He's vindictive. He's not much better than Craig.",
        "Meg: No! No. You're being protective, that is not true.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well your memory's too short. Look, you cannot come between these two guys. Paul has a vendetta against Craig.",
        "Meg: Paul said that he's not going to go after Craig. Not this time.",
        "Holden: Does he know that Craig tried to hurt the baby? You better hope that he never finds out.",

        "Craig: What do you want?",
        "Rosanna: It's over. Paul and Meg know the truth.",
        "Craig: Which truth, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: That Paul is the baby's father.",
        "Craig: It was just a matter of time.",
        "Rosanna: And Craig -- Paul knows you tried to kill the baby.",

        "Paul: You're going to be a grandmother again.",
        "Barbara: What? What do you --?",
        "Paul: Meg's baby. I'm the father. I'm going to have a son, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Well, that's wonderful. Where does that leave Rosanna?",
        "Paul: Rosanna? Biggest mistake I ever made in my life. I'm filing for divorce, and then Meg and I can finally be together.",
        "Barbara: You don't look very happy about it. In fact, you look like you want to kill someone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I think you killed it.",
        "Brad: I'll buy you a new one.",
        "Henry: What about the files that were on here, Brad?",
        "Brad: We'll get one of those geeks that rescue the files. Look, this is important. We need to stop Katie from hooking up with Joe the speed dater. I mean, they had breakfast at the Lakeview. What if she takes him upstairs for brunch?",
        "Henry: That's not her style.",
        "Brad: Oh, yeah? You remember the elevator?",
        "Henry: Oh, Lord. Do you have to remind me of that?",
        "Brad: I've got to get over there.",
        "Henry: Wait. No, no, no, no. Brad, Brad, hold on. Wait a second. Wait, stop before you break anything else.",
        "Brad: Why aren't you taking this serious? You know, forget it. Where's Vienna? She'll know what to do.",
        "Henry: She's off today. I'm covering for her.",
        "Brad: Then why don't you help me, man?",
        "Henry: Why do you want me to help? Why do you want me to help you? I didn't think you guys were right for each other in the first place.",
        "Brad: Okay, well opposites attract. Who thought that Vienna the hottie would fall for you, the penniless, poker-playing chauffeur?",
        "Henry: I have unplumbed depths, Brad.",
        "Brad: So do I.",
        "Henry: My point is, I did not make Vienna fall in love with me. It happened because it was right. Now, if it's right for you and Katie, it will happen. But you cannot force it.",
        "Brad: Okay, the difference is, in our case, Katie's trying to force it not to happen. So I need to do something before Katie rides off on the back of Joe's fire engine. If I don't do something, I'm going to lose her for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I have to be honest. Part of me will probably always be in love with Jack. I don't blame you if you want to run for the door. But we never really fall out of love with our exes, do we? I never have.",
        "Joe: I'm interested in now, Katie. Do you have room in your life for a new guy?",
        "Katie: Yes. Jack and I are over. We will never be together again. I do have a lot of baggage though. Are you still interested?",
        "Joe: Definitely.",
        "Katie: So am I.",

        "Sam: Whoa! Smells good.",
        "Carly: Here you go, Roomie. I made the good stuff.",
        "Sam: Thank you. So how are you and Jack doing? You seemed okay last night.",
        "Carly: Well, I think I've made sort of a breakthrough. Jack told me that he and Katie were over for good, and I know that the old me would have started scheming, planning a way to get him back again.",
        "Sam: So the new and improved you won't be doing that?",
        "Carly: Nope. Because all that matters to me is my kids. And I want Jack to be happy.",
        "Sam: Jack is a fool on so many levels.",
        "Carly: Thank you, Sam. And it's really only important that I know that I've changed. Jack doesn't have to believe me.",
        "Sam: I believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Craig hated the idea of Meg having my baby so much that he tried to kill my son.",
        "Paul: Oh, look at what he's done to his own children after they were born. I really don't think he would have a problem murdering one of mine.",
        "Barbara: He's obsessed with Meg, yes. She'll never be safe around him. And your baby? You know what? You've got to make sure that they're never around him again. They're not safe around him!",
        "Paul: I thought you didn't care about Meg.",
        "Barbara: Well, she's carrying your child. That changes everything. And if Rosanna did what you say she did, she better steer clear of me. So what are you going to do?",
        "Paul: Well, I promised Meg that I wouldn't go after Craig. That I'd leave him alone.",
        "Barbara: Can you do that?",
        "Paul: Yeah, but see, I didn't know the whole story when I made that promise. Now that I know that he tried to kill my son -- I'm going to kill him.",
        "Barbara: No, no! Paul, you can't do that. All that matters is that he stays away from Meg and the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I keep praying that Paul doesn't find out what Craig tried to do to his son. Because I couldn't blame him for what he would do.",
        "Holden: You look exhausted.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, I couldn't sleep last night. I kept waiting for something terrible to happen.",
        "Holden: Don't worry, I got your back.",
        "Meg: My big brother.",
        "Holden: Why don't you go upstairs? Get some rest. I'm going to head outside and take care of a few things. I'll be right back.",
        "Meg: Okay. Holden?",
        "[Craig walks in]",
        "Meg: You shouldn't be here. Mama's upstairs. I need to take care of her.",
        "Craig: Don't lie to me, Meg. I know that you know the truth about what I almost did. I'm so, so sorry.",
        "Meg: Sorry's not good enough! You tried to kill my child! How can I ever forgive that?",
        "Craig: Yes, I tried, but I couldn't go through with it. I love you too much.",
        "Meg: That's not love.",
        "Craig: I will -- I will make it up to you, okay? I know that we have hurt each other a good deal, but I can't give up on us. I still want you, even if you are carrying another man's child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Wait a second. I know how Craig's mind works. He doesn't like to lose. And it won't be just his wife and his son he'll be losing if Meg divorces him, he'll be losing control of his company, too. And he won't let that happen.",
        "Paul: It's already done.",
        "Barbara: That baby's not born yet. There is no divorce. He'll feel desperate. And when he gets painted into a corner, there's no telling what he'll do. Meg will be in danger. You'll be in danger. The baby will be in danger! You're all in danger!",
        "Paul: The only one in danger, Mother, is Craig.",
        "Barbara: You are a good person, Paul. You are not Craig Montgomery. Please, tell me you're not going to go after him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Look at you. Jack's a fool not to want you back.",
        "Carly: Yeah, isn't he? That's his loss.",
        "Sam: He's a cop. He doesn't know any better. He's used to playing things by the book. No wiggle room.",
        "Carly: Well, I guess that's what they mean by irreconcilable differences.",
        "Sam: You're everything a guy could possibly hope for. And if he doesn't see it, he doesn't deserve you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joe: I watch your show so much, I feel like I already know you.",
        "Katie: No, no, that's not me. It's just a persona. Katie lite.",
        "Joe: Yeah, well, it's pretty attractive. And I'm just crazy about your sense of humor.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, you have to be able to laugh when you're interviewing the owner of the world's largest beet.",
        "Joe: You must be very proud of your beet. I understand you were on the cover of beet monthly?",
        "[Katie remembering]",
        "Brad: Man, that is one gorgeous beet. But I've got a friend over at \"Beets Illustrated.\" Put a thong on that baby, we've got the swimsuit issue locked up.",

        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, I've been there, done that. It's no fun. She doesn't want you, Brad. Get over it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Craig put Rosanna in a coma for two years. What do you think he's going to do to someone like Meg?",
        "Barbara: We won't let him anywhere near her.",
        "Paul: Or my son? My unborn son can't defend himself! I need to protect my family! That means I need to stop Craig once and for all from destroying the people that I love.",
        "Barbara: I know exactly what you're talking about because I'm not going to let him hurt you. He tried to kill you once. What if he achieves his goal this time?",
        "Paul: Well, this time I'll see him coming.",
        "Barbara: You can't do that. You can't wind up hurt or in prison. You have a son to raise.",
        "Paul: So you want me to just walk away?",

        "Meg: But you wanted to.",

        "Meg: I couldn't tell him what you did. If he knew, he'd try to kill you.",

        "Meg: I despise you.",
        "Craig: Well, be that as it may, Paul knows. Rosanna told him what I tried to do to the baby.",
        "Meg: Well, then you have to get out of here right away!",
        "Craig: I am not afraid of Paul Ryan. The only thing I want is to be with you.",
        "Meg: I could never stay married to you. That's over.",
        "Craig: Maybe. Maybe so. Maybe I'll never get you back. But I swear on my life, I will never let Paul Ryan have you.",

        "Carly: Thank you so much for saving my morning, Sam. You're a good guy. I'm going to go over to Metro before the suppliers show up. I'll see you there later, right?",

        "Barbara: Paul, I know how angry you are, but you have a baby coming. And he's going to need his mother and his father. You have too much to lose by going after Craig.",
