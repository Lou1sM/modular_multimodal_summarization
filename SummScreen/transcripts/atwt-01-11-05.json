        "Katie: Oh, thank you.",
        "Waitress: Refill?",
        "Katie: No, not yet. Thanks.",
        "Woman: Congratulations.",
        "Katie: Pardon?",
        "Woman: I thought you looked familiar. You two make such a handsome couple.",
        "Katie: May I --",
        "Woman: Oh, keep it, of course. A valentine's wedding sounds so romantic.",
        "Henry: Well, look at the adorable couple.",
        "Katie: Henry, where did you get this picture?",
        "Henry: Crash course in Photoshop -- a little click here, an arrow there.",
        "Katie: Is that --",
        "Henry: Simon's shoulders? Yeah, yeah. I found an old photo of you two, and voila.",
        "Katie: You put your head on someone else's body and sent it to \"The City Times\"?",
        "Henry: Well, every prominent couple needs a formal announcement.",
        "Katie: You should have waited, Henry.",
        "Henry: For our own portrait? Yeah, I know, I know. But those things cost a mint.",
        "Katie: No, I mean to talk to me about it first.",
        "Henry: Why? I know all the basic facts. I just plugged them in. Day, date, time, place. Employed by --",
        "Katie: Mike's gonna see this.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Ergo the word \"announcement.\" If we're going to do this, let's do it right. This born-again monogamist is out to prove there's more to me than meets the martini.",
        "Katie: But, Henry, don't you understand when Mike sees this, he's gonna think I'm happy and I've moved on without him.",
        "Henry: Did I miss something? I thought that was the point.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I knew it. The Bears will not sign a free agent in the off-season.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I wouldn't wear that to my funeral.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Jennifer: This article about up and coming fashion designers.",
        "Mike: High fashion? I thought you were hooked on jeans.",
        "Jennifer: I'm hooked on the person wearing my jeans. Oh. I can't believe it. Here we are lying in bed, reading the paper like we've done it a million times before. But it's all new. We're brand new.",
        "Mike: Does that mean one day we'll be old and you'll be bored?",
        "Jennifer: Not a chance.",
        "Mike: You hungry?",
        "Jennifer: A little.",
        "Mike: I make a mean grilled cheese.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no, don't go.",
        "Mike: I won't be long.",
        "Jennifer: You better not be.",
        "Mike: You want to see a movie later?",
        "Jennifer: That's a great idea.",
        "Mike: Check out the listings.",
        "Jennifer: I haven't seen a movie in forever. Oh, my God.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I hope you're in the mood for a comedy.",
        "Mike: I don't believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I'm really sorry I didn't call first.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, we're glad that you're here. We've been really worried about Will.",
        "Paul: Yeah, how is Will?",
        "Kim: Oh, silent. Kind of withdrawn. But when you try to talk to him, he puts on a big act as if everything were just fine.",
        "Paul: We know that act. We've seen it.",
        "Kim: He spends a lot of time in his own room.",
        "Rosanna: He's probably going to have a hard time trusting anyone ever again.",
        "Paul: Well, Emily undermined whatever little bit of confidence he may have had left.",
        "Rosanna: She had help.",
        "Paul: Maybe. I'm sure that once Emily gets what she deserves, will starts to feel a little better.",
        "Kim: You know, Paul, I don't mean to overstep but --",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no, please, go ahead.",
        "Kim: Well, it's just that I think what Will is really looking for is acceptance, not revenge.",
        "Paul: Well, to see justice done, that'll do him good. And in the meantime, Rosanna and I will do everything that we can to try and show him that we love him and that we want him to come home.",
        "Kim: Which could be a little difficult, considering the fact that he says that he doesn't ever want to see either one of you ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Somebody order a bologna and cheese?",
        "Jack: Oh -- someone's been reading my mind. I'm starving.",
        "Carly: Oh, there's a brownie in there, too.",
        "Jack: Oh, homemade?",
        "Carly: By somebody. So -- so how's you're day? Long day or what?",
        "Jack: No worse than usual. Here, we'll share.",
        "Carly: No, no. No thanks.",
        "Jack: You're just going to sit there and watch me eat? Okay. What's going on?",
        "Carly: What? Can't a loving wife bring her husband something to eat without being up to something?",
        "Jack: Some can. Maybe.",
        "Carly: All right, detective, you got me. I am up to something. But I'm up to a good something. It's something you need.",
        "Jack: New golf clubs?",
        "Carly: Better. I thought of a way for you and J.J. to spend some quality time together without Julia getting in the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Holden: Hi.",
        "Lily: I went to look for you down at the barn.",
        "Holden: I came up here. I had to make some calls.",
        "Lily: Can we talk?",
        "Holden: Lily, I can't talk right now. I've got a lot of work to do.",
        "Lily: It's not going to take long. Is Emma here?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Lily: Is Julia here?",
        "Holden: Julia? No, I haven't seen Julia today.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Holden: Lily, why are you here?",
        "Lily: I wanted to talk about Luke. He's not taking this separation very well. He's keeping to himself a lot. He's very angry.",
        "Holden: Sure. Well, adjusting is going to take some time. Deep down, I know that he was expecting something. He knew that we had problems.",
        "Lily: Yes. But before, you were there. He was always hoping that we would work things out. But now, he misses you. We all miss you.",
        "Julia: Hey, I noticed we were out of milk, so I -- well, you worked fast. You don't waste any time, huh? I suppose she already told you her side of the story?",
        "Holden: What story?",
        "Lily: We were talking about our son.",
        "Julia: Oh. Sorry, I just assumed --",
        "Holden: Assumed what? Am I missing something here?",
        "Julia: I am really sorry. When I saw you here, I just figured that you told him what you had done and --",
        "Holden: Does somebody want to tell me what's going on here?",
        "Julia: Yesterday, remember I got a call from the Lakeview?",
        "Holden: Yeah. About your things.",
        "Julia: Yeah. But there were no things when I got there. It was actually Lily who had called and when she got me alone, she offered me a bribe to leave town.",
        "Lily: It was not a bribe. I just know that Julia and J.J. are having a hard time getting on their feet. I was trying to help.",
        "Holden: By offering them money?",
        "Lily: Can we talk about this in private? Please?",
        "Holden: No, we can't. It involves her, she should stay.",
        "Julia: You know what, I'll just go upstairs.",
        "Holden: No. I want you to stay. Is this what happened?",
        "Lily: I just told you what happened.",
        "Holden: Let her talk.",
        "Julia: Yeah. She offered me money to start over someplace. Anywhere but Oakdale.",
        "Holden: How much?",
        "Lily: Well, this is where it gets interesting. She wanted $5 million.",
        "Julia: Oh, I wasn't serious!",
        "Lily: Yes, she was. She was.",
        "Julia: Come on! I wanted to see how far you would take it, so I asked for the moon. Look, I'm not about money. 'Cause if I was, clearly I would not be working the night shift at the hospital.",
        "Lily: I'm not going to apologize for trying to help this woman.",
        "Holden: Help? You weren't helping. Let's just call it what it is.",
        "Lily: Okay, fine. I don't like where this is going. I see what's going on with Julia -- I don't like it. We have a family to think about.",
        "Holden: You haven't been wired into our family for months. You can't blame this on Julia. I'm sorry that you got involved in this.",
        "Julia: Look, I didn't want you to find out. Okay? You've been great. To J.J. And I. And I wasn't gonna say anything.",
        "Lily: Oh, my. This is such an act!",
        "Julia: You know what, Lily? I can understand why you might be upset --",
        "Lily: Don't patronize me! I just want us to have a fair shot at getting what we had back on track.",
        "Holden: How does Julia leaving town fix us? We're the problem, Lily, not Julia.",
        "Lily: We cannot allow other people to come into between us when we're trying to work things out.",
        "Holden: Other people? Like Julia? You just reduced what little trust we had left to a blank check.",
        "Julia: You know what? No, Holden, listen. I understand where Lily is coming from. You know what, if you were my husband --",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Julia: I might've done the same thing to try to save our marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How do I solve my dilemma with J.J.?",
        "Carly: Well, first, we park Julia's unmentionables out on the curb with the rest of the garbage.",
        "Jack: I know you're still upset about that box she delivered.",
        "Carly: Yes, you bet I'm still upset. She's supposedly returning things you gave to her, and she just can't help but throw in a sexy little nightie. She's trying to drive me crazy.",
        "Jack: Then don't let her. We were going to keep this about J.J., remember?",
        "Carly: Yes. Right. Right. And separating the issue of him from the issue of her.",
        "Jack: The problem is she sees me rejecting her as rejecting J.J., too.",
        "Carly: But you would never do that. I mean, if she's going to act like you're the great love of her life, the least she could do is know what kind of man you are.",
        "Jack: She's angry and she's hurt. She wasn't always this way.",
        "Carly: No, I imagine she wasn't when she was getting her way.",
        "Jack: Okay, we're getting to the plan.",
        "Carly: Right. Separating the boy from his mother is the plan. Don't kid yourself, Jack. You hurt her, and she will do anything she can to hurt you back. She will use anything she can.",
        "Jack: Even J.J.?",
        "Carly: Yes. Kids make wonderful weapons. She makes you feel guilty. That gives her power, doesn't it?",
        "Jack: Yeah, that New Year's Eve mess didn't help things either.",
        "Carly: Yeah. And instead of explaining it to him so he could understand or, better yet, fixing it so that you could make it up to him, she's walking around acting like a martyr. Well don't let her do that, Jack. Not to him. Not to you.",
        "Jack: Okay, honey -- to get to J.J., I've got to go through Julia. She's his mother.",
        "Carly: That's why my plan is so brilliant. A camping trip.",
        "Jack: Camping?",
        "Carly: Camping. You and J.J. miles away from Julia's interference. The two of you can spend some time together doing guy things. You know, away from Julia's \"poor me\" act.",
        "Jack: That could work.",
        "Carly: Yes. Yes, that could work. And why don't you call Holden? See if he and Luke want to tag along?",
        "Jack: I want to make it about me and J.J.",
        "Carly: Well, sweetheart, J.J.'s a part of the Snyder family now. He should get used to being around all of us. And from what I hear, he's crazy about Luke.",
        "Jack: Okay, sure. Why not?",
        "Carly: Good. Sweetheart, I think this camping trip is going to be great for everybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It's too early for champagne.",
        "Henry: Bite your tongue. It's never too early for champagne. Especially when there's an engagement to celebrate.",
        "Katie: Just because there's an announcement in the newspaper, does not mean that Mike is going to necessarily buy into this automatically.",
        "Henry: All right. Not at first glance, but you have to work it. Now, it takes two.",
        "Katie: But Mike knows I still love him. I practically threw myself at his feet. I know that I agreed to this, Henry, but it's just feeling really wrong.",
        "Henry: Getting what you want is never wrong.",
        "Katie: It is when you hurt the people you love.",
        "Henry: Me, people?",
        "Katie: Yes, you, people. Henry, I never want to hurt you.",
        "Henry: Oh -- wasting good champagne hurts me.",
        "Katie: I'm serious.",
        "Henry: Drawing a bad hand hurts me. Being with you -- that can never, ever hurt me. All right? I did the asking, remember? So we're not Rhett and Scarlett. So what? Who cares? I mean, look what happened to them. They ended up in the Atlanta lost in the fog.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but we could end up worse.",
        "Henry: Never gonna happen. Never gonna happen. It's gonna be the time of our lives. It's gonna be the party of the century. It's gonna be black tie and orchestra and maybe we could fly in a bishop, or lease a cathedral. I want your wedding train that take up a full city block!",
        "Katie: Yeah, and who's footing the bill for this?",
        "Henry: Well, fortunately, you are betrothed to a man of means.",
        "Katie: Since when?",
        "Henry: Since about 2:45 A.M. The ladies were very, very good to me. Queens over sevens, and winner took all.",
        "Katie: You were gambling?",
        "Henry: No. No, I was securing our future, my pet. And in case you need some more convincing, here is a little visual aid.",
        "Katie: Henry, where did you -- how did you -- is that real?",
        "Henry: Real enough to cut glass.",
        "Katie: How much money did you win?",
        "Henry: Oh, it's only the beginning. You are my good luck charm.",
        "Katie: Henry, get up. People are looking.",
        "Henry: Who cares? Listen, I may not have Simon's accent or Mike's abdominals, but I have a place in my heart that is just for you, Katie. Marry me.",
        "Katie: I already said yes.",
        "Henry: Then put your finger where your mouth is. Make it official. Or, if you don't want to think of this as an engagement, think of it as a way to drive mike crazy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: The grilled cheese is almost ready.",
        "Jennifer: Did you know that henrys went to Harvard?",
        "Mike: In his dreams. Let me see this. Did you look at this picture?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Mike: No, I mean, really look at it. His head doesn't match those pecs.",
        "Jennifer: You think the picture's been doctored?",
        "Mike: The scale's off, the proportion -- I don't even think those are his clothes.",
        "Jennifer: Well, if somebody did this as a joke, they went to an awful lot of trouble.",
        "Mike: That would be Katie.",
        "Jennifer: They've set a date.",
        "Mike: April fool's?",
        "Jennifer: Valentine's day. This picture might be fake, but I think their engagement's for real.",
        "Mike: That's what Katie wants me to think. But there is no way she is getting married to Henry.",
        "Jennifer: I know that women on the rebound do unpredictable things. She must want you back pretty bad.",
        "Mike: That's her problem.",
        "Jennifer: And Henry's. Mike, I think he loves her.",
        "Mike: It's not like that.",
        "Jennifer: No, he adores her in ways that women only dream of. That can be a very powerful draw for a woman.",
        "Mike: The bottom line is Katie is not in love with Henry.",
        "Jennifer: Because she's still in love with you? [Beeping] Is that the smoke alarm?",
        "Mike: The grilled cheese -- oh! How about pizza?",
        "Jennifer: Well, how bad is it?",
        "Mike: It's bad.",
        "Jennifer: We can order in.",
        "Mike: I don't think we have a choice.",
        "Jennifer: Well, let's not be hasty. We could put our heads together, think about it. Really think about it.",
        "Mike: I can do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: We all let Will down, even Hal. I think it's time to start mending fences.",
        "Rosanna: Is he at your place now?",
        "Kim: No. His car broke down again, he wanted to go to Al's, so I dropped him off there. He's going to do his homework there.",
        "Paul: You know what? I'm going to go over there and see if I can't talk to him.",
        "Kim: Paul, listen, just don't expect too much. He's really in a very difficult situation. I mean, he's relieved that everybody knows he's innocent, but he's really not happy about Emily being in jail.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well jail is where Emily belongs.",
        "Kim: Yeah, but look at it -- his family is torn apart again, and there he is stuck right in the middle.",
        "Paul: Well, Emily put him there, not us.",
        "Kim: Yeah. Well, I have a hard time believing that Emily was responsible for all those terrible things.",
        "Paul: Ask Alison. She was just here. She told us that Emily confessed to everything to her.",
        "Kim: Yeah, but what I don't understand is, Emily was so sick when that was all happening. How could she possible have done --?",
        "Paul: She wasn't sick!",
        "Kim: Yes!",
        "Paul: It was an act.",
        "Kim: No. No, no, no. I was there the morning she went to the doctor. I saw her. I didn't think she should be driving. I offered to take her myself.",
        "Rosanna: Wait a minute, she was ill enough to go to the doctor?",
        "Kim: Yes. She definitely was not herself. I don't know, she was just disoriented.",
        "Paul: Do you remember what day that was?",
        "Kim: It was the day that you found the Christmas stocking. I had stop to visit with your mother, and Emily was on her way to the doctor. I thought she was going to fall on the floor before she got out the door.",
        "Rosanna: You know what, this is getting stranger by the minute. We're supposed to believe that Emily came in here and placed a Christmas stocking when she was so sick that she could barely make it to the doctor?",
        "Paul: You know, you're right.",
        "Rosanna: Where're you going?",
        "Paul: I'm going to find out the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, you know what, we'll go ice fishing. I gotta find my drill and everything. And I think, um -- I was hanging stuff for Emma in her barn and I left it in her tool shed. That's exactly where it is.",
        "Carly: And the cross-country skis are there in there, too, aren't they?",
        "Jack: J.J. would love that. He could borrow Parker's. They've got great trails up at Lewisville.",
        "Carly: Yeah. And you can bring the sleds, too. They'll fit in the truck.",
        "Jack: Oh, it's gonna be tight.",
        "Carly: Oh, it's just too bad that you can't fit one more.",
        "Jack: Yes. I know how much you love freezing to death over a smudge pot. Maybe next time.",
        "Carly: Promises, promises.",
        "Jack: You know, I've clocked so much overtime this week, I'm going to head out now. I'm gonna go talk to Holden, and get the gear, and everything.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: You want me to walk you out?",
        "Carly: Know what? Why don't you go ahead? I need to make a call, and I forgot my cell phone, so can I use that phone?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: Hey. This is a great idea you have for J.J. You have no idea how much I appreciate it.",
        "Carly: Yes, I do. It's great for everybody. Hey, Lily, it's me. Everything on this end is definitely going our way. I hope you're having the same luck. Meet me at Al's when you get this message.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Understand your side? Lily, your side is a move right out of Lucinda's playbook.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's not fair.",
        "Holden: Not fair? Was it fair to run Julia out of town?!",
        "Lily: I was just trying to help her, and she's making it sound like I'm a monster. Can't you see what she's doing? She's playing you.",
        "Julia: I'm gonna let you guys hash this out, okay?",
        "Lily: Oh! Let's speak the truth for just one second. If I'd given you over $5 million, you'd be packing your one bag right now out of town.",
        "Julia: I would not take a dime from you. I work to support my son, and I always have, okay? I don't take handouts.",
        "Lily: Oh, really?",
        "Julia: You know what, Lily? I know you don't believe this, but if you hadn't shown up here, I wouldn't have told Holden anything about the money. I really don't want to cause problems between the two of you.",
        "Lily: Oh, like hell you don't --",
        "Holden: All right, this is going nowhere. Lily -- Lily, will you leave? I'll call you later. We'll talk about the kids then.",
        "Lily: No, no. No. No. Really. Don't bother. It is clear to me that you have other priorities other than your family.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I wish I knew how to reach out to him more. How to make it up to him, you know?",
        "Kim: Well, I can tell you from own experience that there's no one more unpredictable than a teenager, so all you can really try to do is look at the world through their own eyes and keep reaching out to him. You know, sometimes these things work out so much better than we imagine.",
        "Rosanna: I hope you're right. Thank you so much, Kim.",
        "Kim: Oh, you're so welcome. You please let me know now what Paul finds out, okay?",
        "Rosanna: I will. Phyllis will show you out, okay?",
        "Kim: Thanks. Bye-bye.",

        "Emily: If I was worried about my defense, I wouldn't have told Alison everything. I wouldn't have sent her running to your place. I certainly wouldn't be standing here talking to you. I have nothing to hide. I'm telling you right now -- I remember being in your house. I remember hanging the stocking and standing there with that stupid doll. But when I see it in my head, it's like I'm standing there watching somebody else do it and -- oh, my God, it just makes no sense. It makes no sense.",

If I had some kind of plot against your brother, why would I advertise it? Why? I mean, it's like waking up right now with -- with this hangover. People are telling me all these things I did the night before, and I have absolutely no connection to it.",

The pain was really too much, and I pushed it down because I wanted to prove to Paul how happy I was to be starting a life with him. And you, having you there was a part of all of that. And when those awful things started happening, the pain was just too much and I just wanted it to stop. I couldn't see clearly.",
        "Will: Well, has it stopped?",
        "Rosanna: No, it hasn't, but that's my responsibility to deal with that, okay? There's nothing that you can help me with. Do you understand?",

        "Emily: No. Wait a minute. Wait, stop. Find Barbara. Talk to Barbara. She was there. She knows. She knows how sick I was. How bad I was. Talk to her. I'm telling you, I swear to you, there were days it was so bad, I could barely move without Barbara's help.",

        "Emily: Maybe she was grateful to have a roof over her head. I know, it sounds crazy, but she was really good to me. She -- she made me tea, she made sure I got my rest. If you won't listen to me, God, listen to her. Barbara knows the truth.",

        "Holden: I meant what I said. I think it's gonna be really good for J.J. and Luke, too. It's just weird that Jack and I are sort of in the same boat now, being part-time fathers.",
        "Julia: Yeah, but you're not like Jack. You're way ahead of him. You don't check in with your kids when it's convenient to your schedule.",
        "Holden: I am my own boss. And you know what? I think you should cut him a break. Trust him a little bit more.",
