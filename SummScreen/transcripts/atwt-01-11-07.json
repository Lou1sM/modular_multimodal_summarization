        "Maddie: There's extra socks, his favorite jersey and cool hats that won't make him gag.",
        "Emily: Oh, thank you. You thought of everything, didn't you?",
        "Maddie: Yes, I have a system. All right, I have to go. I have a date.",
        "Emily: Good for you.",
        "Tom: Thanks, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: You're welcome.",
        "Emily: Well, this helps me out tons. I think Daniel outgrew all his ski stuff I have for him.",
        "Margo: Hey.",
        "Tom: Hi.",
        "Margo: What's going on?",
        "Tom: Emily's going to take Danny skiing for a couple of days.",
        "Margo: This weekend?",
        "Emily: No, actually today.",
        "Margo: What about school?",
        "Tom: Well, Emily has a couple of deadlines coming up, so she wanted to squeeze in some quality time while she still could.",
        "Margo: Why? What's happening at the Intruder that you and Craig are going to be so busy?",
        "Emily: No, not Craig. Just me.",
        "Margo: Well, how does that work out? 'Cause you guys are partners, right?",
        "Emily: Oh, you haven't heard? Your brother's trying to ruin my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So the guy talks you into helping him --",
        "Carly: Simon didn't talk me into anything.",
        "Jack: Into stealing diamonds and leaves you holding the bag.",
        "Carly: Stop trying to make it sound like he's abandoned me.",
        "Jack: Where'd he get the idea, Carly? After seeing Vienna's picture in the paper?",
        "Carly: You're not going to trick me into giving him up.",
        "Jack: Like Simon tricked you into holding stolen goods?",
        "Carly: That's not what he did.",
        "Jack: When he gave you that diamond, Carly, he pretty much guaranteed that when this came down, it was gonna come down on you, not him.",
        "Carly: That's not true.",
        "Jack: Why? Because Simon loves you? Do you still believe that Simon loves you, Carly?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Then why are you here chained to a table and he's walking around free? Why are you looking at years in prison -- years, for watching --",
        "Carly: You just don't want to believe that Simon and I could have anything close to what --",
        "Jack: Close to what? What we have?",
        "Carly: Had.",
        "Jack: Even now, Carly. Even being divorced and when you swear you love another man -- even now, I would never let you twist in the wind like Simon has. I would have walked through that door and said or done anything I had to so you could go free. That's what we have. Tell me again what you and Simon have.",
        "Carly: I know what you think, and it's not true. Simon did not walk out on me.",
        "Jack: Then where is he?",
        "Carly: Somewhere. Figuring out a way to help me.",
        "Jack: Well, it's taking him a while, isn't it? Think maybe he forgot all about you?",
        "Carly: Are you deliberately trying to hurt me?",
        "Jack: No, Simon is hurting you, Carly! I'm trying to get you to make him stop! Give me something, anything that I can take to the D.A.",
        "Carly: I can't. You're wrong, Jack. Simon did not desert me. And he will find a way to get me out of this. I know he will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Allow me. Kind of humble digs for you, isn't it, Vienna? Listen, Sweetie, I was hoping you and I could talk.",
        "Vienna: Certainly. I just have to make one little call first.",
        "Simon: Yeah? Anyone I know?",
        "Vienna: Mm-hm. The police.",
        "Simon: Don't do that.",
        "Vienna: You're a thief, a no-good common thief. I gave myself to you, heart, body and soul. Then you stole from me!",
        "Simon: Well, not you personally.",
        "Vienna: Of course it was personal! You swiped Prince Adolpho's jewels from around my neck when I was in bed with you.",
        "Simon: What can I say? You fell asleep.",
        "Vienna: You made a fool of me.",
        "Simon: Listen, Honey, look, I was the fool, all right? And I have a lot of nerve asking you for forgiveness, but I made a terrible mistake.",

        "Paul: Okay, this power, that's what you're gonna call it. This power is killing me. And you don't care about that. You want me to help you. You want me to help you find Johnny.",
        "Barbara: Paul, you can see the future. You know things. You know things about people, not just Meg, people you don't know. Why would you hesitate to use this gift so you can find your nephew? What is so funny?",
        "Paul: Well, you know what, Mom? For a second there, for a second, I actually thought that you cared about me.",
        "Barbara: I do care about you! But am I wrong to assume that finding your sister's son is as important to you as it is to me? Paul --",
        "Paul: Look, I only see bad things. I only see deadly things. Are you really sure that you want me to see Johnny?",
        "Barbara: Yes. I have to know if he's in danger. We have to find him. We have to help him. But I have to know where to look.",
        "Paul: No!",
        "Barbara: Honey, I don't think that Lucy would let anything bad happen to Johnny, but I have to know that he's safe. Don't you? Paul? Paul! You saw him, didn't you? You saw Johnny!",
        "Paul: I-I-I didn't see. I didn't see anything. Why is it so cold in this hospital?",
        "Barbara: Honey, here.",
        "Paul: No, no, no! Not that blanket. I do not want that blanket.",
        "Barbara: What's wrong it? Paul, what'd you see? What did you see?",
        "Paul: I didn't see anything.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you went away for a second. You couldn't hear me.",
        "Paul: I didn't see anything.",
        "Barbara: Something frightened you. If it was about Johnny, I need to know.",
        "Paul: No. It had nothing to do with Johnny.",
        "Barbara: What, you saw something, though. Did you know where he is? Has something happened to him?",
        "Paul: No, nothing.",
        "Barbara: What did you see? Tell me.",
        "Paul: It's like a blur. It's like a big blur, all right? It's a blur, and I don't know what it was, much less what it means.",
        "Barbara: But it upset you?",
        "Paul: Yes, it's upsetting to see things that nobody else can see.",
        "Barbara: What about details? Do you remember any details at all?",
        "Paul: No. Look, I don't know where Johnny was. It's not like there was license plates or any kind of street signs. I --",
        "Barbara: But what?",
        "Paul: I don't know what this is, okay? I can't control this, so I don't understand. I don't even understand it.",
        "Barbara: Maybe if you held something. I have a toy of his in my purse. You can hold it. You can hold it.",
        "Paul: No!",
        "Barbara: Come on, Honey. We've all heard about people who when they have these powers, they get called down to the police department and they're always asked to hold something that belonged to the victim.",
        "Paul: So Johnny's a victim now?",
        "Barbara: That's not what I meant.",
        "Paul: Oh, no, no! I know exactly what you meant! And I don't want anything to do with it!",
        "Intern: What's going on in here?",
        "Paul: Would you get her out of here?",
        "Barbara: I am his mother.",
        "Intern: You're disturbing the patient.",
        "Barbara: I'm his mother.",
        "Intern: Come on.",
        "Barbara: I'm his mother. What did you see, Paul? What did you see? Tell me what you saw!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Kev, come on. You think I forgot about you?",
        "Gil: I'm glad you were good for this. But next time, don't make me come looking for you, okay?",
        "Casey: Damn.",
        "Elwood: What?",
        "Casey: I was gonna use the rest of that money to pay back Jared.",
        "Elwood: Whoa, how many people do you owe money?",
        "Casey: A few.",
        "Elwood: How many few?",
        "Casey: Jared, Max, Kadeem --",
        "Elwood: Well, okay, but you don't owe all these guys hundreds of dollars?",
        "Casey: I'm down about a grand.",
        "Elwood: A thousand bucks? Where are you going to get the money to pay it back?",
        "Casey: I'll do it a little bit at a time. And if I can't cover it, then I'll borrow from the frat guys with interest.",
        "Elwood: Oh, okay. I get it. So you borrow from Kip Lonagan to pay me and then from Kadeem to pay Jared --",
        "Casey: Yeah, at first. Until I get caught up.",
        "Elwood: Well, that's -- that's insane. I thought you won this money playing poker. And then you made me think that --",
        "Casey: I hit a little dry patch. Right, it'll pass.",
        "Elwood: You know what, Casey? Maybe you should just chill out for a while.",
        "Casey: You know what? Maybe you should mind your own business. You got your money, so back off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I mean, no offense, Emily, but if you feel your life has been ruined, you can hardly blame my brother.",
        "Emily: He sold me out!",
        "Margo: What about what did you do to him? You were involved in getting him shot, you had him arrested.",
        "Tom: Hey, can we not do this now?",
        "Margo: Well, I think she could show a little compassion.",
        "Emily: Compassion for Craig? What, are you kidding me?",
        "Margo: Lucy took his son. He has no idea where Johnny is. How would you feel if Danny was missing, huh?",
        "Emily: At least I'd know that I hadn't brought it on myself. The way Craig handled the situation with Johnny was like he was asking for it. As far as I'm concerned, your brother deserves whatever he gets.",
        "Tom: Okay, okay, Emily? What is this really about?",
        "Emily: Craig is trying to sell the Intruder out from under me.",
        "Tom: How?",
        "Emily: Craig sold his share of the paper to some mogul named Marcus Tull. And apparently he told the guy that I was going to sell my shares as well. Only he never even talked to me about it.",
        "Tom: And you don't want to sell.",
        "Emily: No! Of course I don't. I love my paper. It's one of the few things in my life that's actually working. But you see, Craig knows that. And that's why he wants to take it away, to get back at me for helping Dusty.",
        "Tom: But this Tull guy can't make you sell if you don't want to.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, he's going to try. But I'm telling you right now, I'm not letting anyone take my paper away without a fight.",
        "Tom: I can totally understand that.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, what about you, Margo, huh? You think I should play all nice with your brother and let him bulldoze me?",
        "Margo: I think that if the offer is good, you ought to take it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Unhand me, Simon Frasier!",
        "Simon: Vienna, can you just listen to me, please.",
        "Vienna: No. Stay where you are. I don't want your hands going places, doing things.",
        "Simon: Are you looking for this?",
        "Vienna: Give it back.",
        "Simon: I don't blame you for wanting to turn me in. I mean, I've been a cad. I've been a heel.",
        "Vienna: What is this mistake you want to confess?",
        "Simon: Choosing Carly over you.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, it's like choosing tuna over caviar. What were you thinking?",
        "Simon: I don't know what I was thinking. See, you had taken up with the prince. I mean, the guy could give you diamonds. I couldn't give you anything like that at the time. And listen, Sweetie, if I was thinking straight and rationally, I would never have used you.",
        "Vienna: Where does Carly fit in?",
        "Simon: Nowhere! She doesn't fit anywhere. If I really thought that I had a shot with you, a real chance, I would never have laid eyes on her in the first place.",
        "Vienna: What did this bleached blonde do to you?",
        "Simon: See, it's not so much what she's done, it's what she's planning to do. Vienna, my sources down at the police station say she's going to go in there and she's going to turn me in to save herself. She's going to blame the whole robbery, the whole thing, on little old me.",
        "Vienna: I knew that woman was a backstabber.",
        "Simon: But now you're not my problem anymore. So good-bye, Simon. We have nothing more to say to each other. Here. You want to call the police?",
        "Vienna: Of course I will. But since I feel sorry for you, I'm going to give you a head start. There's the door. Run fast.",
        "Simon: Don't you first want to hear my proposition?",
        "Vienna: What kind of proposition?",
        "Simon: The kind of proposition I think you're going to find a whole lot more alluring than turning me in to the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Can't you see Simon's playing you? That's been his game all along, Carly.",
        "Carly: Of course it has. Of course, it's been some big scam because it's completely beyond the realm of possibility that another man could actually love me!",
        "Jack: I am trying to help you!",
        "Carly: I am in trouble because I got myself here. Simon did not lure me or trick me or seduce me.",
        "Jack: That doesn't explain why you're protecting him.",
        "Carly: What can I say? You rubbed off on me. All those lectures about doing the right thing, well, they sank in. I'm owning up to what I did, Jack. Even the part you don't want to hear.",
        "Jack: What part is that?",
        "Carly: The part where I fell in love with someone else.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder. Yeah, Sandy. What's up?",
        "Carly: What is it? Are the kids okay?",
        "Jack: Can you put her on the phone? No, that's -- Sandy, its okay. I'll be right there.",
        "Carly: What happened?",
        "Jack: Sage had a bit of a meltdown.",
        "Carly: Well, I wish you would've let me talk to her.",
        "Jack: She wouldn't talk to me, Carly. Sandy said she wouldn't come to the phone. I've got to go. I'll get a guard for you.",
        "Carly: Wait, can I at least stay here? So if Sage wants to talk to me, you can call me.",
        "Jack: If you go to jail for protecting Simon, how's she supposed to talk to you then?",
        "Carly: Don't do that. Don't try to make me feel guilty.",
        "Jack: It's the truth! You're her mother, Carly! And you could be ripped from her life for years.",
        "Carly: Katie, here to gloat.",
        "Katie: No, of course not. I'm here to help.",
        "Carly: You want to help me. How?",
        "Katie: You shouldn't be here. We both know that.",
        "Carly: And when did you decide that? Before or after you broke into my house and stole my jewelry and brought it to the cops to make a case against me?",
        "Katie: If you hadn't hooked up with Simon --",
        "Carly: Then you wouldn't have been out to get me.",
        "Katie: He's the criminal, Carly. Not you. You think seeing you here like this makes me happy?",
        "Carly: Well, it ought to. You did everything you could think of to put me here.",
        "Katie: We used to be friends.",
        "Carly: Used to be.",
        "Katie: We went through a lot. Helped each other. So seeing you here losing everything, I feel awful.",
        "Carly: If that's your version of an apology, Katie, stick it.",
        "Katie: Oh, you think I'm here to apologize? I don't have anything to apologize for. If I had to do it all again, I'd do exactly the same thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: There's only one thing that would truly satisfy me, Simon. Seeing you behind bars for the rest of your life. That would be a dream come true.",
        "Simon: What about diamonds? Huh? Don't you still kind of like diamonds?",
        "Vienna: So?",
        "Simon: And I know how much you want to get back at Carly. What if I was to say there was a way that you could have both?",
        "Vienna: Keep talking.",
        "Simon: Well, not all the diamonds that I took off the prince were fenced. See, I kept a few of the better stones for myself, you know, to set myself up. You know, to make me comfortable for a very long time. What if I was to say I would split that with you so we can both be comfortable for a very long time?",
        "Vienna: Together?",
        "Simon: If that's what you want.",
        "Vienna: I wouldn't. I hate you. So where are these diamonds?",
        "Simon: In a secret place.",
        "Vienna: Does Carly know about this place?",
        "Simon: She chose it.",
        "Vienna: I see. So she's going to turn you in, get free and run off with them.",
        "Simon: That's right. Exactly right. Unless I get to them first.",
        "Vienna: What's stopping you?",
        "Simon: I need help, Vienna. Your help.",
        "Vienna: To do what?",
        "Simon: Well, you can get me into places, move a few things around. You see, you have the access, I have the skills. We always did make a very formidable team.",
        "Vienna: Much better than you and Carly.",
        "Simon: Oh, much better. Much better. And more daring, too.",
        "Vienna: Oh, so, this decision I would have, would it be dangerous?",
        "Simon: Dangerous? Absolutely.",
        "Vienna: Well, how can I trust you?",
        "Simon: You can't. All you can do is use me. Use me to get the diamonds. Use me to make Carly squirm.",
        "Vienna: And when I'm done with you?",
        "Simon: Toss me aside, if you'd like. Although I am very much hoping you'd like to keep me.",
        "[Door closing]",
        "Simon: Is that Emma?",
        "Vienna: Mike? Is that you?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'll be right there.",
        "Vienna: Or maybe I should let Mike tear you limb from limb and then send you off to jail? Now that would be much more fun than boring old diamonds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So you think I should just walk away from everything I've worked so hard for?",
        "Margo: No offense, Emily, but since Daniel is getting older, I think maybe you want to think about publishing something with a little more integrity.",
        "Emily: You are such a snob!",
        "Margo: And you are such a --",
        "Tom: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Can we just take this down a notch, please? Look, how did you leave things with Craig?",
        "Emily: He's out of the picture, Craig. This Tull guy is my partner now, only I haven't seen or heard from him since he made the offer.",
        "Tom: And you say he's determined to buy the paper?",
        "Emily: Yeah, unless I can get him to change his mind.",
        "Tom: Do you think this a good time for you to leave town? It sounds like you have a lot on your plate.",
        "Emily: That's the whole point, Tom! I want to go away now, so when I come back, I can throw myself full-force into fighting for my paper. When is Daniel coming home?",
        "Tom: He's studying with Ian and Roy. You know both those boys? Won't be long.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, I can go pick him up?",
        "Tom: Yeah.",
        "Margo: We usually have Ian's mom meet us at Java.",
        "Emily: Okay. I'll do that.",
        "Tom: You know what? Then you should probably get going. We don't want Danny waiting around outside alone.",
        "Emily: Of course not.",
        "Margo: Good, you're leaving. I'll call Danny and tell him that you're going to meet him there.",
        "Emily: Thank you. Listen, thank you, Tom. I really do appreciate this.",
        "Tom: Hey, he's your son, too. Careful on the slopes.",
        "Emily: We will. Thank you.",

        "Barbara: Let me tell you something, Dr. Sloan. Bob Hughes, as you know, is the chief of staff around here but I bet you didn't know that he's my uncle. And I'm going to make sure that he learns about the intern who forcibly removed me from my son's room. Now my son is distraught. He needs me. I said let me go!",
        "Paul: Hey, are you all right?",
        "Barbara: I'm fine.",
        "Paul: Are you okay? Did you cut yourself?",
        "Barbara: I don't think so. That's not my blood.",

        "Barbara: You thought it was Johnny's blood?",

        "Margo: No, no, no, this is not bill paying money. This is not car payment money. This is my mad money.",
        "Maddie: In case you go crazy and want to go on a shopping spree money?",
        "Margo: No, its a little tradition I got from my mama. In case I get mad, I can leave town.",

        "Carly: Oh. Well, that's good for you.",
        "Katie: You gave me some really good advice once, Carly. You told me that I should get Simon out of my system. Proving that he stole those diamonds, that's what did it. I'm over him. I'm done.",
        "Carly: Great.",
        "Katie: But you got caught in the fallout, and I am sorry for that. Have they offered you a deal?",
        "Carly: Not officially, no.",
        "Katie: But they would, right? To get Simon? It was his plan. He stole the diamonds and fenced them. You just helped him get away. If you weren't on probation, that wouldn't be worth more than a little slap on the wrist.",
        "Carly: But I am on probation.",
        "Katie: And facing a long prison sentence, taking the rap for a guy who left you holding the bag.",
