        "Carly: You are all set for Friday night -- excuse me? Well, I don't know if the ads are going to keep running, but I'm really glad you enjoy them. Bye. I just got a reservation for 8:00.",
        "Sam: Great.",
        "Carly: Yeah, it is great. An Oakdale U. student. He said everybody around there can't wait for the next really funny ad to come out about Metro. You know, I thought when you put an ad in the papers, you had to pay for it.",
        "Sam: Well, I think it's a good idea, you know, to try to bring in the young crowd.",
        "Carly: So you paid for it out of your own pocket?",
        "Sam: It's a student paper, it's really cheap --",
        "Carly: Without telling me?",
        "Sam: Sorry.",
        "Carly: Hey Sam, listen I really appreciate everything you've done here for the club. You know that. But I think --",
        "Jack: All right, troops.",
        "Carly: Hello. Honey -- hi.",
        "Sage: Sam, I've got a joke for Cowboy Jack.",
        "Sam: Cowboy Jack? He's not here. He's at the dentist.",
        "J.J.: He doesn't go to the dentist, he's made of wood.",
        "Sam: Man, he lied to me again.",
        "Carly: This is a surprise. A pleasant one, but a surprise.",
        "Jack: Well, I picked the kids up at school, and J.J. and Sage really wanted to come here, so --",
        "Parker: Me, not so much.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm glad you did. I mean, after all, after school it's traditional to stop by your mom's bar, right? So, what'll it be?",
        "Parker: Could you stop making all these jokes? Because I don't think this is funny.",
        "Jack: Okay, Carly -- I think it's time that Parker and I had a little talk. Do you mind? All right, Pal, how do I put this? Knock it off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I am not going to hurt her.",
        "Meg: Holden, don't do this --",
        "Holden: I want you to get the hell out of here.",
        "Craig: Meg, please. Listen to me --",
        "Holden: I'm not kidding, Montgomery! Not another word!",
        "Craig: I don't care what he does. Because you are the only thing in this world that matters to me. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi, Mr. Craig Montgomery. Have you seen him?",
        "Clerk: No, he and Mrs. Montgomery are out right now. Would you like to leave a message?",
        "Paul: No thanks. I'll wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I went crazy. I wanted so much for this baby to be mine and when I found out that it wasn't, I just -- but I stopped myself. Because I love you so much. It wasn't me that did that, not me. Not really. And the only reason why you even heard about what I was thinking about doing was because I couldn't do it -- and the only reason I was thinking --",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Holden: All right, now that you know this thing is loaded and that I will use it, get the hell out!",
        "Meg: Okay, Holden -- Holden, no! Don't do this.",
        "Holden: Don't be a fool, Meg.",
        "Meg: I'm not! You run him off with a gun, and that sick, self-serving part of him is gonna think that you're the one who sent him off, and not me. So he's gonna come back. And I couldn't stomach that. I never want to see your face again.",
        "Craig: Meg --",
        "Meg: Craig! You decided that it was your right to invade my body and try to end a human life because this wasn't your baby! And I'm supposed to be impressed that you didn't go ahead and try to murder my baby? You don't give a damn about kids, unless you're the man who made them. And you know what's really sick? That you actually think that there's something you can say that will make you anything but disgusting to me. Go away!",
        "Craig: I am sorry.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Holden: Can I say something?",
        "Meg: Who's ever stopped you?",
        "Holden: I can't wait to meet this little guy that you have in here. With a mom like you, there's nothing that he won't be able to do.",
        "Meg: Sometimes, Holden, you do come in handy.",
        "Holden: I think you should try and get some rest. It's been a tough day.",
        "Meg: You know, maybe later. I'm going to make myself a cup of tea.",
        "Holden: Herbal.",
        "Meg: You've already saved the day, okay? Give it a rest.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Meg: I know you'd fight all my battles for me, Holden. But I can't let you do that.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Meg: Paul, where are you? Call me. I threw Craig out and I'm afraid he's going to go after you. Yeah, that'll work.",
        "[Meg leaves]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I know your mother is into letting you have your feelings and whatever, and I also know the mistakes she's made.",
        "Parker: Yeah, her latest mistake is over there with my brother and sister.",
        "Jack: Okay. You know all the answers! We all know that. But hey, maybe if you wanted to change, you could stay out of your mother's face for two, three minutes. And maybe be nice to someone who would walk through fire for you. Enough is enough. Hey, this is what it means to be a father and son. I'm not going to pull any punches.",
        "Parker: That guy, Sam, is so lame --",
        "Jack: It's not about Sam, it's about you. Flunking grades? That's not going to hurt Sam. Carly, I've got some work to do at the station. Do you mind watching the kids for a little while?",
        "Carly: Oh, well you know what an imposition it is for me to watch my own children.",
        "Sam: So, my friends here tell me that you don't need to go to the dentist because you have wooden teeth. That you don't get cavities.",
        "Cowboy Jack: No, Sir, I get termites.",
        "Sage: That's gross.",
        "Cowboy Jack: Yes, I had them whitened. All I needed was a little high gloss paint -- eh. Mmm.",
        "Carly: Hey. So how was school?",
        "Parker: Fine.",
        "Carly: Your dad really laid into you, just now, didn't he? Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against you, doesn't it?",
        "Parker: No. What it feels like is the whole world won't listen.",
        "Carly: About Sam.",
        "Parker: There's something really creepy about that guy. And it's not just his dummy.",
        "Carly: Parker, I know you're mad at me, but I really do not like to see you take it out on somebody you don't even know.",
        "Parker: It used to be that even if we were mad at each other, you would listen to me. But you just won't anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, this whole \"I'm off duty and I'm going home,\" that's all an illusion.",
        "Jack: No, I'm being parental.",
        "Margo: Ah.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I told the kids I had some work to catch up on so they'd have to spend time with Carly for a while.",
        "Margo: You have to trick them into that one, huh?",
        "Jack: Well, no. Not Sage or J.J.",
        "Margo: But Parker, huh?",
        "Jack: Parker. Oh man, I know he's going through a tough time, but he is driving me crazy right now.",
        "Margo: Oh, I remember it well. The exquisite awfulness of adolescent boys. I can't believe I miss it.",
        "Jack: I kind of told him off though.",
        "Margo: I'm sure he deserved it.",
        "Jack: You don't even know why.",
        "Margo: No, I don't. I'm sorry. But I'm sure you had reason -- a good reason.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen. The adoption, him wanting to take my name, all that. That was awesome. But --",
        "Margo: What? Are you afraid that he's going to turn around and say something like, \"Well, you're not my real dad\"?",
        "Jack: No, no. Nothing like that. It's just, he seems so alone.",
        "Margo: You know, you setting him straight on something shows him that you're his real dad and you really -- listen to me, giving advice about how to raise boys. Go figure.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder. It's Parker. What's up, Buddy?",
        "Parker: When are you coming to get us?",
        "Jack: Soon.",
        "Parker: Dad?",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Parker: I hate it here.",
        "Jack: I'll be right over.",
        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Margo: So?",
        "Jack: So -- he called me Dad and he sounded like a little boy.",
        "Margo: He's lucky to have you. And he knows it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cowboy Jack: A possible straight for oregano --",
        "Sage: Sage --",
        "Cowboy Jack: Whatever. Possible nothing for the Oakdale kid --",
        "Parker: Mom, he's playing poker with them.",
        "Carly: Parker, they like him, you know? There's no law against that. Besides, he's teaching them about the theory of probability.",
        "Parker: I keep telling you, this isn't funny.",
        "Carly: And I keep trying to tell you, it's not that serious. I'm going to finish this up, and then I'm going to look at your homework, okay?",
        "Sam: Parker, we could deal you in.",
        "Parker: No thanks. I have stuff I have to do.",
        "(Acoustic guitar music playing)",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Do we really have to do this?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I can see why you wouldn't want to face me.",
        "Craig: You're not going to say anything new. You never do, you know? Hmm?",
        "[Glass shatters]",
        "Paul: Look at me. Look right at me. 'Cause I'm the father of the baby you tried to kill --",
        "Craig: All right, all right, I thought about doing something really wrong and I came to my senses. I didn't do it!",
        "Paul: How could you even consider doing something like that? Look at you trying to spin your way out of this.",
        "Craig: Okay, all right, you know what? I just had the woman I love most in the world tell me she doesn't want to see me anymore. So there's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do that is gonna make things worse for me.",
        "Paul: Really? I'm not sure about that --",
        "Craig: Because you don't matter! You are a marginal person. Your opinion of me is meaningless.",
        "Paul: You're not gonna get away with this. Not this! You're not just gonna sweep this under the rug and go on with your life. You've done a lot of horrible, horrible things, Craig, and gotten away with them. But not this! I'll see to that.",
        "Craig: You've got nothing to say about it. I'll listen to Meg. I mean, that's gonna hurt, but she's got a right to judge me. She's a good person. But you? The utter hypocrisy of you coming here to lecture me, of you taking the moral high ground, of you wallowing in righteous indignation! Bull! There is no difference. You are not better than me. You and I -- we're the same.",
        "[Paul punches Craig]",
        "Craig: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, you are a man of action.",
        "Jack: Really, he's right.",
        "Margo: What? Who's right about what?",
        "Jack: Parker. About this Hutchins guy.",
        "Margo: Oh.",
        "Jack: When we pulled him in for the B and E, you read his file, you talked to him. Did any bells go off for you?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I had quite a reaction -- I hate ventriloquists.",
        "Jack: So, he's annoying, but harmless.",
        "Margo: Ah, but he's very annoying.",
        "Jack: Okay. All right, but nothing recent on his report or really serious about the guy, right?",
        "Margo: I don't know. The guy was brought in a couple of times. I don't know.",
        "Jack: Okay, so something could be off about the guy. Or --",
        "Margo: Or?",
        "Jack: Or because of Simon Frasier, I want to arrest any guy that talks to Carly.",
        "Margo: Oh, there you go, being fair again. Now what have I told you about being fair?",
        "Jack: And maybe Parker is having the same reaction I am.",
        "Margo: He's just trying to protect his mother.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, what an exercise in futility that will be. Okay, listen. Maybe I'm pushing too hard. Maybe I'm trying to make him get along with someone he can't stand. And, you know, I mean, I can't even do that, so why should I expect him to do that? It's weird, you know, J.J. and Sage, they seem to get along with the guy.",
        "Margo: That's because he's on their level.",
        "Jack: That's funny. Hey, Tom.",
        "Tom: Hey, Jack.",
        "Jack: Thanks for the talk.",
        "Margo: As always. What? What are you doing here? I thought you were -- what is it? What's wrong?",
        "Tom: Nothing's wrong. But I did just get a call from the department of corrections. About Casey.",
        "Margo: What? What happened?",
        "Tom: Well, they've decided to bring him up for a hearing for early release.",
        "Margo: Oh my God, that's wonderful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You don't seem to have any problem with this math, so maybe we -- Parker?",
        "Parker: Yeah?",
        "Carly: We have to talk about this. Alone, just the two of us, not here.",
        "Parker: What's there to talk about? You won't change anything.",
        "Carly: Well, how about you at least give me a chance to prove to you that I do listen? I'll talk to your dad, okay?",
        "Jack: Okay, Troops. Let's hit the road.",
        "J.J.: Wait, Dad. Sam's teaching me how to play the guitar.",
        "Sage: He taught him how to play one chord.",
        "Jack: Well, the longest journey begins with a single step, right Sam? Okay, Guys, come on. Pack it up, we're behind schedule.",
        "Carly: Thanks for bringing them over. I think J.J. and Sage had a really nice time.",
        "Jack: Yeah, looks like Parker enjoyed every minute of it.",
        "Carly: Yeah. You know, I was hoping that maybe I could get a little time alone with him, if that's okay with you.",
        "Jack: Deal. I'll call you tonight.",
        "Carly: Will you? Thank you. When I worry about him, and I do worry about him, I feel better knowing that he has you.",
        "Jack: All right, Guys, come on, let's get a move on. Gotta get you home and make dinner.",
        "J.J.: Bye, Sam, I'll keep practicing guitar.",
        "Sam: Okay, you're doing a good job.",
        "Sage: Can I try next time?",
        "Sam: Absatoodle-ootley. Hey, wait a minute, Sage. Are you okay?",
        "Sage: Yeah, why?",
        "Sam: Well, I just wondered, you know, if it hurt -- having this thing grow out of the side of your head.",
        "Sage: How'd you do that?",
        "Sam: I didn't do it, you did.",
        "Sage: No, you did --",
        "Sam: No, you did.",
        "Jack: Ready to go?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Parker: All set to go.",
        "Carly: Bye, Sweetheart. Bye. See you soon.",
        "Parker: Let's get out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Don't ever say that to me again. Not ever.",
        "Craig: You're right, you're right. We're not alike. I like truth and you like bluster. I swear, if you spill another drop of my 12-year-old scotch, I will call the police.",
        "Paul: You're unbelievable.",
        "Craig: Ryan, why don't you just leave? Why are you still here? You think I'm bad. I know you're an idiot. I don't find our conversations productive.",
        "Paul: You think I want to be here with you?",
        "Craig: Yeah, I do. I kinda got that impression when you broke down my door. I think you want to break down doors and make bombastic speeches and give and give a litany of empty threats, 'cause it makes you feel like you're -- like you're not like you really are.",
        "Paul: You stay away from Meg. And you stay away from our child. Or I will kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Excuse me, did Mr. Montgomery come back, is he in his room?",
        "Clerk: Yes, Ma'am --",
        "Meg: Oh, good.",
        "Clerk: I think he's with Mr. Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: One more thing -- it would make me really happy to prove to you that my threats are not empty.",
        "Craig: Oh, wow. Now, this is interesting.",
        "Paul: All right, I'll leave you alone to your solitude.",
        "Craig: Yeah, you are scared.",
        "Paul: Of you?",
        "Craig: Of Meg and me. You know, cards on the table, I was feeling low when you just dropped by. And I gotta thank you 'cause I'm feeling much better. You see, I had lost track of something. That what Meg and I have is real.",
        "Paul: Oh, shut up.",
        "Craig: No, it's not traditional and it's certainly got its ups and downs, but it is undeniably, categorically real.",
        "Paul: You're sick.",
        "Craig: And as the song says, \"Time is on my side.\" Oh yes, you are terrified that Meg, your precious Meg, was happy with me. Loved -- me. And you know that the only claim that you got on her is that baby that she's carrying. So -- if I go near Meg, you're going to kill me?",
        "Paul: That's right.",
        "Craig: Okay, well what happens when she comes after me? Huh?",
        "Paul: You son of a bitch.",
        "Meg: Paul, what the hell are you doing here?",
        "Paul: What are you doing here?",
        "Meg: Looking for you. Please, come on. Let's go, now.",
        "Paul: Okay. Don't you forget what I told you.",
        "Craig: Oh, the part about how he's going to kill me if I come near you.",
        "Paul: Gladly.",
        "Meg: Paul, please, not again --",
        "Craig: You know what? It's true. I mean, this whole thing's got this very strong feeling of deja vu.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Meg: Let's go.",
        "Craig: Look, he breaks into my house. He knocks my scotch out of my hand and he slugs me. Now I don't get a minute to state my case?",
        "Paul: You don't have a case.",
        "Meg: I don't want to live like this --",
        "Craig: No, Meg, you don't. You know what it was that set him off? You know what it was that made him slug me? It was when I told him that we are alike. That's what got him. It's true. You deserve better than either one of us. Now, I've blown it, I see that. But history has proven that this man is an ends- justifies-the-means kind of guy himself, isn't it?",
        "Meg: Please, don't --",
        "Craig: I mean, you've got the Jennifer -- his own sister thing. You've got the Emily thing and you've got the Rosanna thing -- how'd that break-up go, Paul, was that amicable? Was there a pre-nup?",
        "Meg: Don't let him get to you.",
        "Craig: Meg, just because you leave me, it doesn't mean that you have to go to him! Remember when it was us before we knew the truth, it was just you, me, the baby -- we were happy. We were simply happy.",
        "Paul: Will you please get out of the way?",
        "Craig: I will, after I've finished. There is no need for violence. Although that is his go-to strategy, isn't it?",
        "Meg: Please let us go.",
        "Craig: You want me to stop because you know he can't control himself, you know that he can't change. And that's what brings me to my main point, Meg. I changed. I changed because of you. And you loved me for it.",
        "Paul: You changed? You tried to kill our baby!",
        "Craig: I didn't. I couldn't. I tried to be what I was in the past, but I couldn't do it, because you changed me. But he can't. He won't. He doesn't know how. He's not going to make you happy, Meg. He won't let you be happy. I'm not begging you to stay with me, I'm begging you to get him out of your life. He let you marry me. Not in a million years would I have done that. And then when you weren't grieving enough because of his supposed \"Death,\" he just walked away from you. I have never walked away from you. And he married Rosanna, to get to me. What about you? You didn't matter until he knew that that baby was his. Do not listen to what the man says, look at what he does! You're better off alone.",

        "Sam: Carly, if I'm coming on too strong with the kids, you let me know.",
        "Carly: Too strong? Come on, Sam. They like you.",
        "Sam: Well, it's just, the more I get along with J.J. and Sage, the more Parker -- I don't know. I mean, I'm here to back you up, not make things worse for your kids.",
        "Carly: The truth is, if you weren't here, Parker would just find some other reason to be mad at me. I have to wait it out.",
        "Sam: There aren't many mothers like you out there.",
        "Carly: Thank God.",
        "Sam: No, don't say that. Parker has no idea how good he has it.",
        "Carly: You don't understand what I put that child through. Look, Sam, I really appreciate everything you've done around here, but maybe you could take a walk, or call Kit, or do something -- just get out of here for more than ten minutes.",
        "Sam: I get it. Took me a while, but I get it.",
        "Carly: Get what?",

        "Carly: Okay, Sam, listen to me. It's not -- it's not that I think you're coming on too strong. I just think maybe you're getting a little too invested.",
        "Sam: You mean, like paying for the ad in the paper?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. That and also -- it's not that I don't appreciate it, but it just makes me a little uncomfortable that you're always on my side, you know?",
        "Sam: Well, someone needs to be.",
        "Carly: No. No, they don't. I have to handle this myself. And I've made so many bad decisions lately that I just -- I need to take my time and go over everything really slowly, you know? And it's not that I'm not glad that you think that --",
        "Sam: Think that you're great?",
        "Carly: I'm just a little wary of someone who thinks that I'm always right, you know? Because then maybe I'll start thinking that way too, and you have no idea the mistakes I can make when I'm feeling empowered. [Carly laughs] Sam, just you don't want to get involved with someone who has a life as chaotic as mine. Really. Really.",

        "Tom: I told you, Honey, it's just a hearing.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know. I know that. But if they change the timetable, that means that maybe he's ready for release.",
        "Margo: Well, maybe that set him straight. Maybe that guard knocked the chip right off his shoulder, huh?",
        "Tom: Maybe he just found a new way to manipulate the whole situation.",
        "Margo: Why do you say something like that?",
        "Tom: Because it seems to me, if he'd had some kind of a transformation, he might have said something to us. But because he knows what this is doing to us, the board decides to bring him up for review and we hear it from the board, and he doesn't even make a phone call?",
        "Margo: Well he probably didn't -- he didn't know. Maybe he didn't want to disappoint us.",
        "Tom: Or maybe he doesn't give a damn about anybody but himself.",
        "Margo: Tom? Will you stop doing that? This really is hard on me. Will you stop being so negative? Look, until we actually know something, can we at least try to pretend that maybe I haven't screwed up his life totally?",
