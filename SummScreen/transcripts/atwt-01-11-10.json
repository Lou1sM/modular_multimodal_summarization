        "While Carly and Jack are hiding in a closet, Jack asks Carly if she got him to Detroit to seduce him. She explains that she told Craig that to make him leave, but she does ask him why they always end up being drawn to one another like now. Jack and Carly almost kiss, but when Hayden and her mom leave the room, Jack and Carly race out of the closet with Sage's CD. Sage is watching Hayden's act when she seems to be having second thoughts. Carly and Jack give her a pep talk, but Sage finally admits that this was a ruse and she has no interest in the Miss Snowflake Pageant. Jack and Carly are angry, as Sage explains why she did it and how she is sure they still love one another and they just needed to spend time together to remember that, as Carly and Jack are speechless. Outside the hotel where the pageant is being held, Parker and Liberty walk in the woods and talk about how they have been forced to grow up quickly due to circumstances in their lives. However, trying to have fun makes them lose track of their surroundings and they get turned around. Parker is then hurt, as he tries to hide how badly to not alarm Liberty, as they try to find a way out of the woods. Clarissa tries to coax Simon back into their long-standing deal that is about to payoff, but Simon wants to stay in town and make a life, as he turns her down. Clarissa offers him some money tempting him to think about it. Katie is feeling more positive about life these days, as she tells Henry about Kim being back in town and how they are due to meet about her show. However, her happiness is short lived when she sees Simon with Clarissa. An annoyed Katie wants to forget so she abruptly heads home. Soon after, Simon heads to Katie's to ask her out now that he has some green, but she can't help but ask about Clarissa. Simon explains who she is, but that he wants to stay in town to be there for her instead. Henry approaches Clarissa and tries to strike up a deal with her for him to replace Simon in this mysterious deal. Clarissa is not biting at first, but Henry is persistent. Carly and Jack talk to Sage about their disapproval of her behavior. Sage presses them to admit their feelings, as they admit they will always care for one another because they have history, but then Carly's attention is turned when Hayden's mother eggs her on. Sage is happy to see this interaction and heads onstage and sings a song, Never Surrender, dedicated to her parents. Later, Carly and Jack seem to be trying to convince themselves of a reason they can't get back together, but they seem to not have a reason off the top of their heads. They are about to share a kiss when Janet interrupts. After a sad Carly leaves them to talk, Janet explains that she has come to fight for their marriage, but she can't help but notice the vibe between him and Carly. Parker and Liberty get more lost but find a place to stay, as Parker's leg gets worse and Liberty has to care for him. Getting colder, they huddle for body warmth and are about to kiss when Parker passes out. Katie tells Simon that she can't make any promises, as Simon claims to accept that, but he wants to be there for her, as he kisses her. Henry continues to try to convince Clarissa that Simon will never change his mind because of Katie, but if Simon has never met the mark then he can play a fill in as the mysterious Australian. Sage is upset to hear from Carly that Janet is with her dad, as Carly seems to not be able to hide her disappointment either. However, she is becoming more worried about where Parker and Liberty are now."

        "Bridget: But it goes better with your complexion.",
        "Jack: How long is this gonna take?",

        "Carly: Yeah. Me too. It would devastate her.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. Would you stop squirming?",
        "Carly: I think something is -- hitting me in the ribs. I cannot breathe.",
        "Jack: All right. I'll move, I'll move.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Not there.",
        "Jack: Sorry. Better?",
        "Carly: Obviously.",
        "Jack: This is so incredibly funny to you.",
        "Carly: Come on, Jack. We've been in plenty of tight situations before, but you have to admit, this is ridiculous.",
        "Jack: Those were by accident.",
        "Carly: What does that mean?",
        "Jack: Craig told me, Carly.",
        "Carly: Told you what, Jack?",

        "Simon: I'm really sorry you didn't like the salad. I would have been more than happy to bring you something else. Do you want to see the menu again at least? [Sighs] Oh. Oh, two quarters. That's nice. That's -- that's really something.",
        "Clarissa: Hello. Don't spend it all in one place.",
        "Simon: What are you doing here?",
        "Clarissa: I thought I'd have some lunch.",
        "Simon: Yeah? Well, you know what? Try the Greek salad. The customers love it.",
        "Clarissa: I also thought I'd tell you that Mr. Lee has called, and he's ready to close.",
        "Simon: Why would I care?",
        "Clarissa: Because we spent two years in setting this up, and now all we have to do is collect.",
        "Simon: I told you, I'm out.",
        "Clarissa: Come on. You're the one who set up the shell corporations, the fake job sites. You found Mr. Lee. I can't in good conscience take your share.",
        "Simon: So you mean he wants to meet me?",
        "Clarissa: Yeah, he insisted.",
        "Simon: Okay. So get yourself somebody else, Clarissa, because he's never met me. Find someone else.",
        "Clarissa: [Laughs] Okay, believe it or not, but charming Australian grifters don't exactly grow on trees, especially not in the state of Illinois.",
        "Simon: Then you have yourself a problem.",
        "Clarissa: I cannot believe that you're gonna walk away from the biggest score of your life so you can, what, wait on tables for pocket change?",

        "Katie: Oh, Kim is back from her cruise. She called me, and she said she can't wait to watch the video I made for the show idea I have, and everybody at the studio thinks she's gonna love it.",

        "Katie: I'm eager to be back. I think the show's gonna be great. Besides, I can use the money.",
        "Henry: You wouldn't be this excited about if it was just about the money.",
        "Katie: Well, that's true. I think it's gonna be good for the moms out there. I think it will really help them.",
        "Henry: I'm sure that Kim will want that, too. It's good to have you back.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, I couldn't put my life on hold forever.",

        "Brittany: Brandon and I have been in love since prom. How long have you guys been together?",
        "Liberty: Oh, we're -- we're not together.",
        "Brittany: You seem like a couple.",
        "Parker: Not since the divorce. We're just friends now.",

        "Liberty: Yeah, just for a couple months.",

        "Brandon: Dude, I got some pretty awesome weed. Let's ditch these losers and get wasted.",
        "Liberty: That sounds great, but this one over here, Parker, he just -- he doesn't like booze or drugs or sex outside of marriage or cheeseburgers, video games, rock music. It's all -- you know, he doesn't like it.",
        "Parker: Also, anything that starts with the letter \"K\" I just don't. It's bad. It's really bad.",
        "Brandon: You know what? We'll, uh -- we'll catch you later.",
        "Liberty: Bye.",
        "Brandon: Bye.",
        "Liberty: The letter \"K\"?",
        "Parker: Cheeseburgers, really? Cheeseburgers?",
        "Liberty: I think -- I think ditching your group was a good idea.",

        "Liberty: Okay. How about them, huh?",

        "Bridget: Did you go over that sequence that was giving you trouble?",
        "Hayden: 20 times.",
        "Jack: So, was Craig right? Did you lure me here on purpose?",
        "Carly: Yes, because this -- this is a dream of mine. It's a dream come true, actually, being with you in a closet.",
        "Jack: Oh, that was such a non-answer.",
        "Carly: I didn't lure you here. Believe it or not, I was actually thinking about Sage.",
        "Jack: Okay, then, where would he get an idea like that?",
        "Carly: I told him.",
        "Jack: What exactly did you say?",
        "Carly: I -- I said that I wanted you to come on this trip so I could seduce you.",
        "Jack: Why would you tell him that?",
        "Carly: To get him to go away, obviously. And it worked.",

        "Carly: You sound disappointed.",
        "Jack: I just want to be clear.",
        "Carly: Well, if it was true -- here, like this.",

        "Jack: Sure it's it?",
        "Carly: Yeah. It's got her name right on it.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: It's getting so cold.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I know. It's dropped like 10 degrees since we left.",
        "Liberty: Hey, we should head back, really. We're gonna miss your sister.",
        "Parker: A -- and miss her dance, really? Wouldn't that be a good thing?",
        "Liberty: Oh, Parker, she would want you to be there.",
        "Parker: No, I'm pretty sure she wants to be there about as little as I do.",

        "Liberty: Hey, does it ever bother you that we're different than kids our own age?",
        "Parker: We are?",
        "Liberty: [Laughs] Come on.",
        "Parker: When I was younger, yeah, it did. But at a certain point, I realized that I can't go back and change what I've been through, you know?",
        "Liberty: It just -- it sucks. I mean, my dad just died, and I just -- I feel so much older now.",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: You ever get used to it?",
        "Parker: I don't know. I mean, it -- it does stop hurting so badly. But I -- it never really stops.",
        "Liberty: Maybe it's just not so bad to be like Brittany and Brandon, really dopey teenagers.",
        "Parker: Literally.",
        "Liberty: [Laughs] I mean, I just -- we're all gonna grow up eventually. Why rush it?",
        "Parker: Yeah. It's true.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Parker: Really? You really want to start a leaf fight?",
        "Liberty: Really. I haven't even started. Bring it on.",
        "Parker: Okay, okay, you're going down. Oh.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Parker: You're gonna pay for that.",
        "Liberty: I'm so scared of you. You're so -- [Laughs] Parker --",
        "Parker: And then there you go.",
        "Liberty: Oh, stop!",
        "Parker: Oh, no, no.",
        "Liberty: Stop it, Parker!",
        "Parker: There, there, there. Some more.",
        "Liberty: Stop! [Sobs]",
        "Parker: Are you okay? I'm sorry. I -- I didn't mean to hurt you. I was just trying to have fun.",
        "Liberty: It's not you, Parker. It's not you.",

        "Carly: Sweetheart, if she's your only competition, that crown is yours.",
        "Sage: No, it's not.",
        "Carly: Yes, it is. All you have to do is -- is keep smiling, make eye contact with the judges, and just be yourself. You're gonna be great, I know.",
        "Sage: No, I'm not.",
        "Carly: You want to say something here?",

With fire in your eyes, hungry for blood. 150%, Honey. Give me 150%, and you leave nothing out on that field. Stage --",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Who's that?",
        "Henry: It's Simon.",
        "Katie: Not Simon. Who's he with.",
        "Henry: A customer.",
        "Katie: She looks pretty friendly for a customer.",
        "Henry: I -- I'm sure it's nothing. Don't let it bother you.",
        "Katie: Oh, it's not. Why would it bother me? Simon can do whatever he wants with whomever he wants. I got to take Jacob home for a nap.",
        "Henry: He's already sleeping.",
        "Katie: He needs to be in his crib.",
        "Henry: You're gonna wake him up to put him to sleep?",

        "Simon: I know how much it is. I know what I'm turning down.",
        "Clarissa: Can you at least tell me why?",
        "Simon: 'Cause if we do this deal, then I'm gonna have to disappear for a very, very long time. I'm not ready to do that. Clarissa, not now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Sage, its okay. You'll be fine once you get started.",
        "Sage: I can't! I can't I want to go home!",
        "Jack: Sage, Baby, this is your dream. You've been working on this for months.",
        "Sage: No, I haven't!",
        "Carly: What are you doing?",
        "Sage: I lied, okay? This isn't my dream! Are you kidding?! It's so beyond stupid!",
        "Carly: What about all the w -- work that you put in?",
        "Sage: I only started last Tuesday.",
        "Jack: So why are we here?",
        "Sage: Because I thought it would be a good way to get you guys to go away together and realize you still love each other.",
        "Carly: Sage --",
        "Sage: 'Cause you totally do, and you both know it, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clarissa: Think what you're giving up.",
        "Simon: Clarissa, I have. I have thought well and hard about it, and I'm not saying it isn't tempting.",
        "Clarissa: It's beyond tempting.",
        "Simon: I'm trying to build a life here, okay?",
        "Clarissa: Why would you want to do that?",
        "Simon: Because I think I could be satisfied, fulfilled.",
        "Clarissa: Did you fall on your head?",
        "Simon: I don't expect you to understand.",
        "Clarissa: You're damn right I don't understand. Does this town even have a decent jewelry store that you could knock over when you get bored?",
        "Simon: I don't need to do that anymore.",
        "Clarissa: You know what? I don't believe that. I think what you need is just a little bit of time. I -- I'll give you some time. I'll wait.",
        "Simon: You are gonna be waiting a very long time, trust me.",
        "Clarissa: I don't think so. I think a couple more days cleaning out those grease traps and you'll be singing a different tune.",
        "Simon: Not this time.",
        "Clarissa: We'll see.",
        "Simon: All right. What is that?",
        "Clarissa: It's a called a tip.",
        "Simon: Yeah, and I haven't been a waiter very long, but I know to get a tip, I have had to got you something. I didn't get you anything.",
        "Clarissa: Oh, but you will. Go ahead. Take it. Come on. Come on, Simon, take it. You can buy yourself a new apron or something. I knew you'd change your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell ringing]",
        "Katie: Oh, don't wake -- don't wake up.",
        "Simon: Hey.",
        "Katie: Jacob's sleeping.",
        "Simon: Sorry, sorry.",
        "Katie: Knock next time.",
        "Simon: I will, I will.",
        "Katie: What are you doing here?",
        "Simon: I want to take you out.",
        "Katie: Take me out? What the hell does that mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So you never cared about this pageant at all?",
        "Sage: Of course not.",
        "Carly: You have really crossed a line this time, dragging us all the way to Detroit like this.",
        "Sage: I know!",
        "Jack: Do you have any idea how much this thing cost us?",
        "Carly: The entry fee, the hotel room.",
        "Jack: And now you're telling us it's -- it's just another lie you told?",
        "Carly: That is not how we do things in this family. Well, it shouldn't be.",
        "Sage: You guys still haven't answered my question. Do you love each other or not?",
        "Jack: That's not the issue here, Sage.",
        "Sage: Yes, it is! You're my parents, and I want us to be a family again. It's all I ever wanted.",
        "Carly: It's not that simple.",
        "Sage: Why not?",
        "Carly: Your dad and I have a -- a history together.",
        "Sage: So?",
        "Carly: So we'll always have feelings for each other.",
        "Sage: So the answer is yes.",
        "Jack: No!",
        "Sage: Why not?",
        "Jack: For one thing, hello, I'm still married to Janet.",
        "Sage: Then why are you living with us?",
        "Carly: It's only temporary. We talked about that.",
        "Sage: That's just an excuse. You can lie to yourselves all you want, but you cannot lie to me.",
        "Director: Excuse me, is there a problem here?",
        "Sage: I'm waiting for my parents to tell the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You know, I can't believe you're gonna be in New York next year.",
        "Liberty: It's not final yet. I still have to get my portfolio together.",
        "Parker: I mean, you could have done that by yourself.",
        "Liberty: I don't think so. I don't know how to build one or what sketches I should choose.",
        "Parker: It's pretty simple. You just choose the best ones, right?",
        "Liberty: But I really want it to be good, Parker, 'cause I really want this.",
        "Parker: Well, you know what? You're in luck, because my mom is great. And by the time she's done with it, you will have the best portfolio in the world.",
        "Liberty: [Laughs] I know. I've seen her sketches. She's amazing.",
        "Parker: No, Liberty, you're amazing. I mean, honestly, after everything you've been through this year, to -- to stay on top of your schoolwork like that, to get into F.I.T., a great school -- I mean, it's amazing.",
        "Liberty: I couldn't have done it without your help, Parker.",
        "Parker: You can do anything you want, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Thank you. Shouldn't we back by the hotel by now?",
        "Parker: I think we're almost there. Probably just over that hill.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Now what?",
        "Parker: Well, all we have to do is get across it.",
        "Liberty: Well, how do we do that?",
        "Parker: It's pretty easy. We just jump.",
        "Liberty: Parker, it looks pretty far to me.",
        "Parker: We can do this.",
        "Liberty: I just -- I don't think so.",
        "Parker: Look, I'll go to the other side first, and that way, I can help you jump across.",
        "Liberty: No. I think we should just find another way.",
        "Parker: Liberty, please.",
        "Liberty: Parker --",
        "Parker: We just need to get a running start. Watch how easy it is. God!",
        "Liberty: God, Parker! Are you okay? Hey, are you okay?",
        "Parker: Yeah. No, I -- I just tripped, okay?",
        "Liberty: Oh, you poor thing. Are you sure?",
        "Parker: Yeah, no, you know what? You're right. Let's just -- let's just find a way to get around here, all right?",
        "Liberty: Okay. Are you -- are you sure that you're okay?",
        "Parker: Fine. I'm fine.",
        "Liberty: Okay, let me help you up. Ready? Oh, poor thing. Ready?",
        "Parker: Let's just -- let's just go that way.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: I'm waiting for an answer.",
