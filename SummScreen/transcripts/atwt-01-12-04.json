        "Jessica: You know, maybe I should help --",
        "Ben: No, Jess, there's nothing more you can do. We've made the offer, explained the rules for living here, now it's up to Sarah.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I know, but --",
        "Ben: No buts. Let's -- come on. Come, come, let's have some coffee, relax.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, that's just what I need.",
        "Curtis: So, gonna stay, gonna go?",
        "Sarah: I haven't decided, yet.",
        "Curtis: Well, let's review your options, shall we? You can live here with a doctor and a lawyer who are bending over backwards to take care of you and stay in the same city as all your friends. Or you can live in a home for disadvantaged juveniles on the other side of the state.",
        "Sarah: Or I can take off.",
        "Curtis: Run away. That's what got you in this mess in the first place.",
        "Sarah: No, Jessica Griffin is the one who ruined my life.",
        "Curtis: Hey, I'm not trying to tell you what to do. But I've been on the street and in the system.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, so what?",
        "Curtis: So, if I were you, I'd be moving my stuff into that big cushy bedroom upstairs before Jessica has the chance to change her mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So you want to make a deal, huh?",
        "Molly: Thanks.",
        "Craig: What kind of deal?",
        "Molly: As you well know, I'm in some trouble with the law.",
        "Craig: That seems to be going around.",
        "Molly: Yeah, thanks for pointing the cops in my direction, by the way. But as it turns out, trashing Rose's car isn't a big deal. My lawyer says I can plead it down, pay a fine, do community service. But the obstruction of justice charge for planting poison in Dusty's hotel room -- that could be a problem. They're talking about putting me in prison for that, Craig. Yeah, prison. That's where they put people who interfere with a police investigation by setting up other people.",
        "Craig: Yes, well, trying to frame innocent people isn't the best idea.",
        "Molly: Exactly. I knew you'd get it.",
        "Craig: So, what do you want from me?",
        "Molly: If Dusty doesn't testify, there's no case. I've tried talking to him. I've even tried bribing him. I've tried everything. Well, almost everything, but he won't budge. So, I think somebody needs to convince him to let bygones be bygones. Just let it go.",
        "Craig: Well, we do have a profitable business here. We don't need -- bad publicity.",
        "Molly: Ah, I knew you'd see this my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mother?",
        "Barbara: Jennifer, what a pleasant surprise.",
        "Jennifer: You have been avoiding me.",
        "Barbara: Honey, no I haven't.",
        "Jennifer: Ever since the police station, when you flat out denied that you tampered with evidence from Rose's murder. Which Paul and I both find extremely interesting, considering the fact that you had just told us exactly what you had done. Now, what I want to know is, were you lying to the police or were you lying to your own children? Mother? Do you have any idea how bad this is? Paul could go to prison because of your lies. Now, why -- why would you want to do that to your own son?",
        "Barbara: Paul is innocent until proven guilty.",
        "Jennifer: Mother, you planted evidence. They could find him guilty on that alone.",
        "Barbara: If he is innocent, he has nothing to worry about.",
        "Jennifer: \"If\" he is innocent? You and I both know that Paul had nothing to do with Rose's murder. You know, I'm sure that there are plenty of people in prison who are innocent, but there are precious few who are put there by their own mothers.",
        "Barbara: You're making a scene, darling.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, gosh, this is crazy. For days, I have been telling Paul that he is wrong. That you couldn't possibly have killed Rose, but what am I supposed to think now? When you are destroying your son's life? Oh, my gosh, you did do it, didn't you? You did! And now you are protecting yourself by throwing Paul to the wolves? Well, I'm warning you, Mother, I will not let you get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Took you long enough.",
        "Private investigator: Good to see you, too.",
        "Paul: On the phone, you said you had something big to tell me?",
        "Private investigator: You hired me to find some proof that could connect your mother to the murder of Rose D'Angelo, right?",
        "Paul: Right. And after all this build-up, it better be worth the wait. What'd you find?",
        "Private investigator: A hit-man. One hired by Barbara Ryan to kill ms. D'Angelo. Would you say that was worth the wait?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, she's breathing again, but I don't know for how long. She's fighting for air.",
        "Lily: Thank you very much. What's -- hold on.",
        "Jack: Mitzi.",
        "Lily: Mitzi, can you hear us?",
        "Jack: Mitzi?",
        "Lily: Mitzi, are you okay? What's wrong?",
        "Jack: Are you all right?",
        "Lily: What's wrong?",
        "Mitzi: I don't wanna die. Don't let me die.",
        "Rose: I don't wanna die.",
        "Mitzi: I'm scared.",
        "Jack: All right, you know what, we're gonna get her to Memorial. Find here purse!",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Jack: Make sure there's a wallet in it or some -- some kind of I.D. They're going to need the information when they admit her.",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "Jack: Get out of my way or help, okay? Listen, forget the ambulance. Call Memorial, tell them we're on our way.",
        "Lily: Okay, I'll get -- out in my car. Her purse is in her car. I'll get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Bob, you gotta help us, she's semi-conscious. Just like Rose. You gotta help her, please!",
        "Bob: Put her in cubicle three.",
        "Lily: Save her. And test her for poison. Just --",
        "Dusty: Methanol, the same kind of poison that killed Rose.",
        "Lily: All right, how is she?",
        "Bob: I'm afraid your diagnosis was correct, Lily. She was poisoned. By methanol.",
        "Lily: It's just like Rose.",
        "Bob: Lily, because of your suggestion, we checked on methanol poisoning first, and the test came back positive.",
        "Lily: No, my God, not again.",
        "Bob: No, it's not again. This time we caught it in time. Yeah, we were able to stop the poison before it entered her system.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Dusty: Is she gonna make it?",
        "Bob: Her chances of a full recovery are very good.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank God. Thank God.",
        "Bob: Lily, you get some rest now. I'll keep you posted.",
        "Lily: All right. Thank you, thank you so much.",
        "Carly: Who would poison Mitzi? Why?",
        "Dusty: Paul was at Metro when I got your call about Mitzi. I hung up the phone, he was standing there, I don't know how long he was standing there, but he must've heard me say Mitzi's name and that she was at the church.",
        "Jack: So Paul was worried Mitzi would incriminate him?",
        "Dusty: Definitely.",
        "Lily: So, he poisoned her to shut her up.",
        "Dusty: So she couldn't testify against him. Jack, what more do you need?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Tell me everything that you know about this hit-man. He's a pro?",
        "Private investigator: The best. I showed him the pictures of your mother and your fianc\u00e9. He says this one hired him to whack this one.",
        "Paul: And you believe him?",
        "Private investigator: He's a straight shooter. Pun intended. These guys have their own weird code of honor, you know? Once he said he'd talk to me, I knew I'd get the truth.",
        "Paul: Did he admit to poisoning Rose?",
        "Private investigator: Not his style, too personal. He likes firepower.",
        "Paul: But Rose wasn't shot.",
        "Private investigator: That's the thing. Your mother canceled the hit. She told him he could keep the money, but she eighty-sixed the job.",
        "Paul: Where is this guy?",
        "Private investigator: Around.",
        "Paul: Around where? Around Oakdale?",
        "Private investigator: He can be.",
        "Paul: Get him here. You tell him I need to talk to him myself.",
        "Private investigator: The thing is guys like that -- they're not too big on talking to strangers.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I'm not a stranger. I know you, and you know me. So, you can vouch for me.",
        "Private investigator: I -- I doubt that'll be enough.",
        "Paul: How about this? You think this'll be enough?",
        "Private investigator: It's a possibility.",
        "Paul: Tell him where to find the other half.",
        "Private investigator: I hope you know what you're doing.",
        "Paul: I know exactly what I'm doing. Sending you back to hell, Barbara.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What can I possibly say, Jenn? You've already tried and convicted me.",
        "Jennifer: The only thing that I want to know is the truth about what you did to Paul. I'm giving you one more chance to do the right thing. And if you don't do it? Then I promise you, I will prove that you are lying.",
        "Barbara: Threats from my own daughter? Fine! You go right ahead. Prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Humming]",
        "Walker: That doesn't make any sense. Unless -- let's try this. I'll be damned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I only did what had to be done. Someday, if you ever become a mother, perhaps you'll understand that.",
        "Jennifer: I hope not! I hope I never become the kind of mother who chooses protecting herself over protecting her own children. Was it worth it, mother? Because, as far as Paul and I are concerned, we no longer have a mother. And as soon as Will finds out about this --",
        "Barbara: You leave Will out of this! He is too young, and he has suffered enough.",
        "Jennifer: Because of you.",
        "Barbara: Okay, fine, Jenn. You go right ahead and hate me, but you better protect your little brother. No matter what.",
        "Jennifer: You're right. I have to. Because after what you did to Paul, Will needs all the protection from you he can get.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jennifer: Hello?",
        "Walker: Jennifer? Walker Daniels, here. Listen, I've found something down here, you need to look at it.",
        "Jennifer: Where are you?",
        "Walker: I'm at my lab at Memorial.",
        "Jennifer: I'm on my way.",
        "Barbara: Good news?",
        "Jennifer: The best. I hired Walker Daniels to evaluate the evidence from Rose's murder to see if he could clear Paul. And you know what? He found something. So I'd ask you to wish me luck, Mother, but it looks like you're gonna need it from now on.",
        "Barbara: We'll see about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, Sarah, have you made up your mind? Are you gonna stay with us?",
        "Sarah: I have a question for you.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Sarah: Why do you want to be my foster mother? 'Cause you hate me.",
        "Jessica: Sarah, I do not hate you.",
        "Sarah: Give me a break. Aren't we supposed to be honest and everything around here? Isn't that one of the house rules?",
        "Ben: Curtis? How about a cup of one of the best cappuccinos this side of Italy?",
        "Curtis: No, thanks. I'm good.",
        "Ben: How 'bout some hot chocolate? From a cup with your name on it.",
        "Curtis: Ah, excuse me, ladies.",
        "Sarah: You told me upstairs that honesty is the most important thing around here.",
        "Jessica: Yes, and I meant it.",
        "Sarah: Then let's be real. Okay, you've hated me since the day we met. You wanted me out of Bonnie's life, even before you knew my father was Marshall Travers.",
        "Jessica: Sarah, there's a lot you don't understand --",
        "Sarah: I understand everything! I had two people -- just two, in this entire world who cared about me, Bonnie and my father. My father's dead and Bonnie's in prison, and whose fault is that? Yours. You only want to be my foster mother because you feel guilty.",
        "Jessica: Okay, you want honesty? Here it is. I'm doing this for one reason and one reason only -- because Bonnie begged me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Lou? Can we get two glasses of our best champagne, please.",
        "Bartender: You've got it.",
        "Molly: Thanks.",
        "Craig: Champagne?",
        "Molly: Don't you think we should toast to our mutually beneficial arrangement? Just to make it official.",
        "Craig: Well, let us both be clear on what this mutually beneficial arrangement is, all right? I try to talk Dusty out of --",
        "Molly: No, no, no. There's no trying involved here, Craig. You must talk Dusty out of testifying against me, and the charges get dropped.",
        "Craig: And in return?",
        "Molly: In return, I forget that I know anything about you helping the cops have a strong case against Paul Ryan. Or anything about you having an involvement with Annabelle Fettle, \"black market baby broker.\"",
        "Craig: That is a gross, and I do mean gross, exaggeration.",
        "Molly: Beautiful.",
        "Bartender: Your champagne.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Molly: Thank you. You know, the fact is, Craig, I need you almost as much as you need me. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Mm, but I have to say there's one thing I don't get.",
        "Craig: One?",
        "Molly: Why haven't you arranged for Annabelle Fettle to just disappear without a trace?",
        "Craig: I thought I had.",
        "Molly: But you haven't. So, what's your game plan?",
        "Craig: Well, hopefully], She reaches an arrangement with the Canadian authorities soon and this whole mess goes away.",
        "Molly: Hopefully? You're gonna live your life on hope?",
        "Craig: What choice do I have? I have to get Cabot's adoption resolved, and I have to get it resolved without anybody else getting involved with that woman.",
        "Molly: Especially Rosanna?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: Especially her. Excuse me.",
        "Molly: No problem.",
        "Craig: Yes, hello?",
        "Lakeview clerk: Mr. Montgomery?",
        "Craig: Yes, who is this?",
        "Lakeview clerk: This is the front desk clerk from the Lakeview. Your aunt just checked in, and she'd like to check into a room and start a tab at the bar. She said you'd cover it.",
        "Craig: My aunt? And which aunt would this be?",
        "Ms. Fettle: Tell him it's his Auntie Belle. His favorite aunt. The one he's promised to take very good care of. Just as well as she's taken care of him.",
        "Craig: I'll be right over. Do you know that back-scratching thing we were talking about? I've got an itch.",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Craig: Let's go.",
        "Molly: But --",
        "Craig: Come on.",

        "Craig: Thank you.",

        "[Paul remembering]",
        "Paul: You know you did it, Barbara. Why don't you do us all a favor this time and just admit it. So I get this funny phone call, right? Telling me to go to the mausoleum, and guess what I find there. Congratulations, Barbara. You wanted to punish me for loving Rose? Well, you win. This time.",
        "Barbara: I don't know how this could have possibly happened, Paul. It's impossible.",
        "Paul: Anything is possible when it comes to you, Barbara. It's not enough that you poisoned the love of my life, but now you want me to hang for it?",
        "Rose: Yes! Let's invite everybody that hates us to our wedding. Let's not stop at your mother and your sister. Let's get daddy to come, too. If he can get out! And maybe we'll get somebody to test the cake for us so we don't keel over dead before we get to our honeymoon. Why couldn't you trust me? All you had to do was believe. And I'd still be alive.",
        "Paul: And you finally destroyed Rose, but I'll be damned if I let you get away with it.",
        "Barbara: I know I made a mistake, but please don't compound it by going to Hal.",
        "Paul: Why not? Because Hal would think that you killed her and that you're trying to frame me? Mother, please, just tell me the truth, finally. You killed the only woman I ever loved. You did it. You poisoned Rose.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Private investigator: This is Paul Ryan.",
        "Stranger: You're a real funny guy, Ryan.",
        "Paul: I have my moments.",

        "Paul: You want money, I want information.",
        "Stranger: I heard.",
        "Paul: When did this woman hire you to kill Rose D'Angelo?",
        "Stranger: About a month ago. Said she had a job for me, I took her on.",
        "Paul: Go on.",
        "Stranger: I couldn't figure her out. One minute, she wants that chick dead so bad I can taste it. Hands me the money, gives me the instructions, then a few hours later, she's freaking out. \"I can't go through with it.\" I can keep the money, no problem. The contract's null and void. She's a real nut job.",
        "Paul: Any idea what changed her mind?",
        "Stranger: She didn't change her mind. She was gonna do the job herself.",

        "Barbara: Oh, honey. I was hoping I'd run into you.",
        "Jennifer: Really.",
        "Barbara: Yes. I mean, when you told me that they found some kind of proof that would clear Paul, you ran out of the restaurant so quickly, I thought maybe I could come over here and see if I could help in some way.",
        "Jennifer: You have done more than enough to help. In fact, I think we'd all be a lot better off if you stopped helping. If you follow me, I will have security throw you out in a heartbeat. I mean it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What are you asking me questions for? Get out there and arrest the guy.",
        "Jack: I know you're suspicions and you're angry and you want the guilty party nailed to the nearest wall. But you've got to put that out of your mind for now and think about time line. Okay? From the time that lily called you at metro, until we questioned Mitzi, did Paul have enough time -- ?",
        "Dusty: Yes. It would've been tight, but he could have gotten over there and poisoned her, yes.",
        "Jack: Any idea how she ingested it?",
        "Lily: It was the martini. She was drinking a martini. When you came over and you questioned her, she got upset, she was nervous, and she threw back the whole drink. Remember that? It has to be.",
        "Jack: I'm gonna call Hal. I'll call Hal, get crime scene over there and search the place, okay?",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Mitzi's poisoned the same way as Rose, inside Rose's house, nobody's telling me this is a coincidence. Somebody wanted the girl dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stranger: Hey, what about the other half of my money?",
        "Paul: I'll be back. As soon as I give my mother what's coming to her.",

        "Jessica: I know this isn't an ideal situation. But we do have one thing in common, right? We both love bonnie. So, I'm willing to give this a try if you are. Troy is gonna need an answer soon. Okay, why don't I give you a little more time to think about it?",
        "Sarah: No.",

        "Jessica: Yeah, exactly. And this could be the break we've been waiting for, so -- I don't know how long this is gonna take. I'll tell you what. Why don't -- why don't you guys go down to the shelter with Sarah and help her collect her things and move her in here?",

        "Lily: Did you tell him what's going on with Mitzi?",
        "Dusty: Did you tell him who the prime suspect is?",
        "Carly: What's next?",
        "Jack: He's got a team over to Rose's, searching the place, looking for prints.",
        "Dusty: Prints? Of course you're gonna find a lot of prints. He was gonna marry the girl. Remember?",
        "Jack: We've done this before, Dusty. Thank you very much. Now, look, I'm gonna stick around a while longer, see if I can get a statement out of Mitzi tonight.",
        "Dusty: What about some statements out of Paul Ryan?",
        "Jack: I told Hal about your theory.",
        "Lily: Oh, it's a theory now.",
        "Jack: Well, until we got some concrete evidence, that's all it can be. Okay, give me proof that Paul was the one to poison Mitzi, and then we'll talk about putting him behind bars. But until then --",
        "Lily: Oh, this is ridiculous.",
        "Dusty: How many people gotta die, Jack, before you do something about it?",
        "Jack: Lily, you know I want to help you, right?",
        "Dusty: Pathetic.",
        "Jack: But I can't throw procedure out the window just because, you know, a family member has a stake in this. I got to play things by the book.",
        "Lily: All right, if you can't do anything about this, maybe the D.A. Can. I'm gonna go talk to Tom. Let's go. Let me know how Mitzi's doing, would you?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Lily, I'll call you.",
        "Jack: Lil -- [Chuckles] Oh, boy, that was fun.",
        "Carly: You think she's gonna be all right?",
        "Jack: Who, Lily?",
        "Carly: No. Mitzi. What? I'm not supposed to care?",
        "Jack: You've been accusing her of murder the past few weeks.",
        "Carly: Well, things are different now.",
        "Jack: So, is there anything you want to tell me? On the record? Before I start rubbing things in?",
        "Carly: All right. I was wrong. You happy?",
        "Jack: I will be. As soon as I find whoever's going on a killing spree.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: All right, get this down to forensics, top priority. You tell 'em to drop whatever they're working on, get busy on this.",
        "Cop #3: Will do.",
        "Hal: I want that martini shaker and glass tested for methanol. As soon as the results come in, I want to know about it.",
        "Cop #3: I'm all over it, lieutenant.",
        "Hal: Good. Go.",
        "Cop #4: Excuse me. This is a crime scene.",
        "Holden: Hal? A little help here?",
        "Hal: You've got something for me, Holden?",
        "Holden: We think so.",
        "Hal: It's okay. Let him in. Let him in.",
        "Holden: Lily called and told us what happened.",
        "Luke: I hope Mitzi's gonna be okay.",
        "Hal: Yeah, me too, Luke. Me, too,",
        "Holden: Luke has something that we think you should know.",
        "Hal: Well, go ahead, Luke. Shoot.",
        "Holden: Come on, buddy. Tell Hal what you told me.",
        "Luke: I was outside tonight, just messing around.",
        "Hal: Mm-hmm.",
        "Luke: And I heard loud voices coming from over here.",
        "Hal: Did you hear what they said?",
        "Luke: I was too far away.",
        "Hal: Did you -- did you see who it was?",
        "Luke: There was a guy over here. He ran off down the driveway.",
        "Hal: Did you know who it was?",
        "Luke: It was too dark to see more than shadows.",
        "Hal: Hmm. Can you -- can you tell me what he looked like, Luke? Was he, like -- was he tall? Was he short? Was he muscular, skinny, fat? Can you tell me anything like that?",
        "Luke: He was thin, I think.",
        "Hal: Luke, you know Paul Ryan, don't you? Do you think that it might have been him?",
        "Luke: Maybe.",
        "Holden: Got what you need?",
        "Hal: Yeah. Another piece of the puzzle. Thanks.",
        "Cop #4: Lieutenant, we're pretty much done here.",
        "Hal: All right, let's pack this stuff up, get it down to the station, see what we can come up with. Oh, I may have some more questions for you later. Okay?",
        "Holden: You know where to find us.",
        "Luke: Bye.",
        "Hal: Thanks, Holden.",
        "Cop #4: You got something, lieutenant?",
        "Hal: Yeah, another strike against our prime suspect. This doesn't look good for Paul.",

        "Paul: Let's take a little trip down to the station.",
        "Stranger: Police station? Is he kidding?",
        "Paul: I just want you to tell them what you just told me about my mother.",
        "Stranger: Didn't you hear anything about what I do for a living?",
        "Paul: Yeah, we'll figure out a way around that.",
        "Stranger: I don't talk to the cops about anything, ever.",
        "Paul: A woman is gonna get away with murder.",
        "Stranger: Some people have a knack, like me. See, one thing I don't do is talk to the cops. Another thing is squeal on people.",
        "Paul: Well, you're squealin' on her.",
        "Stranger: Look, forget it. See, I don't know you. And I certainly don't want to get to know any cops. Good luck.",
        "Paul: Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. You're not going -- hey, you're not going anywhere.",
        "Private investigator: Take it easy, gentlemen.",
        "Stranger: I've said everything I'm gonna say.",
        "Paul: We can work this out, all right? We'll make a deal. I can offer you protection.",
        "Stranger: What are you? Some kind of comedian or something? No one can protect me.",
        "Private investigator: Unless maybe he's the son of Stenbeck.",
        "Stranger: James Stenbeck?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm afraid so. And if you know anything about my father, you know that he would be very interested in who's helping me out, and equally interested in who's getting in my way.",
        "Stranger: I want the whole thing in writing before I even say a word. You got it?",
        "Paul: Just make sure he doesn't go anywhere.",
        "Private investigator: Where are you going?",
        "Paul: I'm gonna make a deal.",
        "Stranger: Hey, what about the other half of my money?",
        "Paul: I'll be back. As soon as I give my Mother what's coming to her.",

        "Craig: Auntie Belle. What are you doing here?",
        "Ms. Fettle: Why don't you spend a few nights at the Wagon Wheel and ask me that question again, genius? There's headboards banging against the wall day and night. No class.",
        "Craig: You can't stay here.",
        "Ms. Fettle: You do notice I'm already here? Now, are you going to foot the bill? Or do I have to handle this in another way?",
        "Craig: Before you handle anything, you need to get a grip.",
        "Ms. Fettle: Oh, isn't he the funniest thing? I wonder if your lovely wife knows what a fabulous sense of humor you have. Now, when do I get to see the wife again? Why, I haven't had a good chat with her since little Cabot came into your nest.",
        "Molly: Craig, there's something we can do, isn't there? I mean, there's got to be a room in this hotel some place that's far enough away that nobody will see or come looking for Auntie Belle.",
        "Craig: Well, now that you mention it, I think I know the perfect room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Dr. Hughes, is Mitzi awake?",
        "Bob: No. She's still unconscious. She won't be able to answer questions for some time. But if you want, you can go in and sit with her -- for a while.",
        "Carly: Okay. Thank you.",
        "Jack: Hey, Mitzi. You gave us a pretty big scare, there. Doctors think you're gonna pull through just fine, though. So you hang in, okay?",
        "Nurse: Detective Snyder? There's a call for you out at the desk. It's Lieutenant Munson? He said it's important.",
        "Jack: Thank you, very much. I'm gonna have to take that. Come out when you're done. Hang in there, Mitzi.",
        "Carly: Okay. Hi, Mitzi. It's Carly. I know I'm not exactly your favorite person in the world right now. The way I've been accusing you of poisoning Rose. Obviously, I was way off the mark, right? I mean, there's no way in the world that you would actually poison yourself. Although, that sure would be a good way to throw them off the scent, wouldn't it? No. No, that's way too nutty, even for you. So, what I want to say is -- I'm sorry. And I'm glad you're gonna be okay. Bye.",
        "Jack: You got it. I'm gonna have to take Mitzi's statement later on.",
        "Carly: Wait. What? What's going on?",
        "Jack: No, no time to explain. I've gotta go.",
        "Carly: Well, you can explain to me in the car. I'm coming with you.",

        "Lily: Tom?",
        "Tom: Hi, I've already made some calls.",
        "Dusty: Some calls? Tom, why is Paul Ryan still walking the streets? Where's the arrest warrant?",
        "Tom: You can't arrest him without probable cause.",
        "Dusty: Oh, you can't? Never stopped anybody around here for arresting me, did it?",
        "Tom: Well, you bring him in on supposition; you open up the city and the OPD to a lawsuit.",
        "Lily: So you'd rather have a murderer just walking the streets of Oakdale?",
        "Tom: Look, I know you're frustrated. So am I.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Tom: But I will not and cannot break the law.",
        "[Paul comes into the police station.]",
        "Dusty: Don't do this, guys.",
        "Lily: You poisoned Rose, and then you poisoned Mitzi. We know that you did it.",

        "Ben: I was able to find a few more boxes. So, you think this is gonna be enough for your big move?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Ben: All right, then. Let's get rollin'. Curtis? Y'all grab the rest of the boxes.",
        "Curtis: We got 'em.",
        "Ben: Cool. Let's do this.",
        "Curtis: Hey, you heard the man. Let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Welcome to the family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I can't believe I'm letting you talk me into this.",
        "Craig: It's all part of our deal. Scratch, scratch.",
        "Molly: Scratch this. Just cough up the money to get her own room.",
        "Craig: She needs assisted living. She needs constant supervision to keep from wandering the streets, making a public nuisance of herself, et cetera.",
        "Molly: Running into Rosanna?",
        "Craig: Among others. So I will just say good night and let you two ladies get settled.",
        "Ms. Fettle: I'm sure we'll get along just fine.",
        "Molly: Don't forget your end of the bargain, partner.",
        "Craig: Partner, thank you.",
        "Ms. Fettle: I'll just call down to the kitchen and have them send that lobster up to our room.",
        "Molly: Uh, obviously Craig forgot to mention to you, this is a nonsmoking facility.",
        "Ms. Fettle: Not anymore, sweetheart.",
        "[Ms. Fettle laughs]",
        "Craig: Sorry, Molly. I just need to find out if Mitzi Matters is getting our story straight.",

        "Paul: What are you talking about? Somebody poisoned Mitzi?",
        "Dusty: Here we go again.",
        "Lily: You used the same poison on Rose that you used on Mitzi.",
        "Dusty: You overheard a phone conversation I had with Lily at Metro. And you found out that Mitzi saw you at church with poison, and you knew that she'd testify against you, so you had to whack her, too, didn't ya?",
        "Lily: She's alive, and she's going to put you in jail for the rest of your life.",
        "Paul: You've got the wrong guy. I didn't poison, Rose, and I certainly didn't poison Mitzi.",
        "Dusty: There's a witness, Pauly. And you're not walking away. You want me to break that down for you?",
        "Cop #5: You touch him, you're going to spend the night in jail.",
        "Tom: All right, all right, all right. Paul, why are you here?",
        "Paul: I'm here to see Hal.",
        "Cop #5: He's over at the crime scene.",
        "Paul: I got to go.",
        "Lily: Wait, no, no, no. You cannot let this man walk out of here! He's gonna go right to Memorial and finish the job on Mitzi.",
        "Paul: Lily! I have never killed anyone!",
        "Dusty: You put methanol in Mitzi's martini shaker, the same way you did Rose's champagne. Huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: There's only one problem with that theory. It's scientifically impossible.",

        "Hal: Lose something, Barbara?",
        "Aaron: You finally tell Chris he's the father?",
        "Alison: I told Chris everything he needs to know. What? No, I don't need a return trip. I'm never coming back to Oakdale.",
        "Paul: Mom, finish this.",
        "Barbara: No.",
