        "Jennifer helps Katie and Henry celebrate their impending nuptials, but Mike doesn't buy it for one second and tells Katie that if she's trying to make him jealous, she didn't know anything about him at all. Alison sees Will and Roseanna, Will showing her the new car Roseanna has given him and Roseanna telling Alison that she's having a hard time believing that Emily did what she did. Will takes the car and after thinking about everything that happened, he dumps it over a cliff saying Emily didn't do anything to Roseanna, she did it to him. Ali sees Emily talking with Paul at the jail, telling them both that she shouldn't have burned the map because it might have been the only thing to exonerate her because how could Emily have known enough to draw such a complicated map. After hearing about how well Barbara was taking care of Emily, Paul starts to put things together and excuses himself, telling Emily he'll be back after he asks a few questions. He bumps into Barbara, who is excited because she's being released from the ankle bracelet since Dr. Decker was caught in Oregon. Paul congratulates her but whispers in her ear that he'll be keeping an eye on her. After talking with Paul, Barbara visits Emily and finds that she doesn't remember that it was Barbara that was behind her actions at Fairwinds. Paul goes home to an exuberant Roseanna who is busting to tell him about what happened with Will, when Will comes over and gives her the keys to the car, telling her he's sorry but he lost control of it and it went over a cliff. Aaron finds Alison and tells her that after talking with Ben at the hospital, his doctors believe he may regain use of his arm again. As Ben looks at the films per Aaron's request, he finds a problem."

        "Jennifer: Oh, wait, wait, wait. I feel another toast coming on.",
        "Henry: Oh, well, then toast away.",
        "Jennifer: Here is to grabbing what you want with both hands and not letting go.",
        "Henry: Oh, I will drink to that.",
        "Jennifer: You know, you're my new hero, Henry.",
        "Henry: Oh? What was it that did it for you? My boyish good looks? My sense of style?",
        "Jennifer: It was just the way that you put it all out on the line. You finally told Katie how you really feel about her.",
        "Henry: Oh. That.",
        "Jennifer: And then you went even further. You proposed.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, you wanna win big, you gotta bet big. Actually, it was our conversation we had the other night that was one of the things that inspired the boldness of my actions, so --",
        "Jennifer: Really?",
        "Henry: Yeah. It was a turning point, I guess. I realized I had to speak now or forever hold my peace. I knew there was only a matter of time before she fell in love with someone else. And I know what you're thinking, that I'm Katie's rebound guy, it will never last. But the fact of the matter is that I'm good for her. We're good for each other.",
        "Jennifer: You know, when I saw the announcement about your engagement in the paper this morning --",
        "Henry: You thought I was out of my ever-lovin' mind?",
        "Jennifer: No. I thought there was almost something chivalrous about it. I wonder what Nikki will say when she hears.",
        "Henry: Well, when you see her, tell her all the good ones are officially taken.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: If you're looking for an ulterior motive, forget it. Henry and I are engaged and we're celebrating, that's it.",
        "Mike: Yeah, right. You as, Henry Coleman?",
        "Katie: Got a problem with it?",
        "Mike: No, but I'm pretty sure you will.",
        "Katie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Mike: I'll make it crystal clear for you. If you think this engagement is going to make me jealous, you'd better think again. 'Cause all it shows is that you never knew the first thing about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: C'mon, Emily needs you.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but what about you?",
        "Aaron: I'll catch up with you when I'm done.",
        "Alison: As soon as your appointment's done. Promise?",
        "Aaron: Promise.",
        "Alison: Thank you for being so understanding about Emily. I need to ask her about that map of Fairwinds you found. Something about it's been bothering me.",
        "Aaron: Couldn't have anything to do with destroying evidence, does it?",
        "Alison: No, I just keep getting the feeling that we're missing something, but I can't put my finger on it.",
        "Aaron: Well, it'll come to you. Okay? Look, I better bounce before I miss my slot. I'll see you soon, okay?",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Good luck.",
        "Alison: You, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: My own car?",
        "Rosanna: Courtesy of Cabot Motors.",
        "Will: This is unreal.",
        "Rosanna: It's our latest model, every possible perk -- GPS, state of the art sound system, chromerims, xenon headlights, top-notch security features. The rest you'll discover as you get to know her.",
        "Will: I don't know what to say.",
        "Rosanna: Say that you love it.",
        "Will: You've already apologized a million times, you didn't have to do this, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: I am not trying to buy your affection, Will.",
        "Will: Well, then what is this?",
        "Rosanna: This is something that I've wanted to do for a very long time, before things went bad between us. And I hope that you'll accept it, and you'll enjoy it, and you'll remember all the good times that we had together and everything that to come. And if you ever need a place to park it, there's always free parking at Fairwinds -- which I hope that you will use. You're welcome there any time. In fact, nothing would make me happier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Barbara knows better than anyone how sick I was. I'm telling you, I was in no condition to play mind games with Rosanna or hatch some diabolical plan to send Will away. Barbara can vouch for that, she was there.",
        "Paul: Taking care of you?",
        "Emily: Yes.",
        "Paul: Right. Kim said you went to see a doctor. What was the diagnosis?",
        "Emily: A doctor, I remember. I remember going to the doctor, but --",
        "Paul: But what?",
        "Emily: But I was getting better, and -- Barbara and I were actually getting along.",
        "Paul: You were getting along with the woman who tried to sabotage your marriage, who had you kidnapped and then shipped off to some nightmare spa from hell? She hit you on the head with a rolling pin --",
        "Emily: I know. I know it doesn't make any sense. I know that she's a miserable human being --",
        "Paul: You just said you were getting along with her.",
        "Emily: I don't know what to tell you! I don't know what I was thinking or what I was doing.",
        "Paul: The only thing you do know is that Barbara was there.",
        "Emily: Yes. The entire time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What do you want with me? I mean, you haven't even told me why I'm down here. Would someone please tell my why I'm here?",
        "Cop: Lieutenant Munson will explain everything, ma'am.",
        "Hal: Thanks. I'll handle it from here.",
        "Barbara: You know, you send a cop to bring me down here who won't even tell me why I'm here -- why am I here, Hal?",
        "Hal: Have a seat.",
        "Barbara: Something's wrong. Isn't it? Something's wrong.",
        "Hal: Why do you say that?",
        "Barbara: Well, because I get back from the hospital and you and Emily aren't there, and I don't talk to anybody for days, and you're obviously very upset --",
        "Hal: Stop pretending you don't know what's going on.",
        "Barbara: I don't. I don't -- it's because of Emily?",
        "Hal: Of course it's because of Emily.",
        "Barbara: Don't believe a word she says, she's out of control, she's desperate. Don't believe a word out of her lying mouth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Hey. What brings you here?",
        "Jessica: An interested party told me you were packing up your office, so I --",
        "Ben: Yeah, well, you know, after all these years, all these hours, all these patients, it's kind of funny how it just fits into a couple of boxes.",
        "Jessica: This place is your second home. It can't be easy just packing up and walking away.",
        "Ben: Walking away from what you care about is always hard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: This car does everything but drive itself. I hope the two of you will be very happy together.",
        "Will: Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Hi, Alison. How are you?",
        "Alison: I've been better. How about you guys? Looks like you buried the hatchet.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, how do you like Will's new car?",
        "Alison: This is yours?",
        "Will: Yeah, it's a gift from Rosanna.",
        "Alison: Sweet ride. Some people say it with flowers, you say it with cars. It must be nice.",
        "Rosanna: How's Emily?",
        "Alison: I'm on my way to see her right now. Thank you for not kicking me out of your house when I dropped by the other night.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on, I'm not out to crucify your sister. In fact, after you left, I was telling Paul how none of this makes sense. I mean, Emily is my sister's best friend, and she's never been anything but kind to me. Why she would sneak into my attic and use Cabot's stocking like that. For the life of me, I don't even know how she knew where to find it. There's just no reason that she would do something like this to me. I hope that she'll be all right. I really do.",
        "Alison: Me, too. I'd better run. Enjoy your car.",
        "Will: After everything Emily did, you still care about her?",
        "Rosanna: Well -- I think she needs help. Will, I hope she gets it. Look, the rest of us should just focus on putting the past behind us and moving on, huh? C'mon, what do you say? Should we bury the hatchet?",
        "Will: Thanks, Rosanna. You don't know what this means.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Well, that was a little harsh, wasn't it? I thought you two had turned a corner and become friendly?",
        "Barbara: That's true. We had, until I found out how determined she was to send Will back to that asylum. I thought you'd be concerned, too.",
        "Hal: I am.",
        "Barbara: About your son.",
        "Hal: Him, too. I know it's not going to be easy to patch things up with him. But Emily's in trouble, and right now, she's my main concern.",
        "Barbara: Which is why you haven't been home.",
        "Hal: That's right. I've been down here ever since she's been charged.",
        "Barbara: How'd you find out the truth? Was there a break in the case?",
        "Hal: There was no break in the case. She came in on her own steam, volunteered to take the lie detector test.",
        "Barbara: Really? What'd she say?",
        "Hal: I think there's something that you should know, Barbara.",
        "Tom: Am I interrupting?",
        "Hal: No. Not at all. Come on in, Tom.",
        "Tom: Good. Just the woman I've been looking for.",
        "Barbara: Me? Why? What have I done? I thought you brought me down here to talk about Emily.",
        "Hal: There's more to it than that. You get the paperwork done?",
        "Tom: Everything is official and I'm ready to move on it.",
        "Barbara: Would you like to tell me what this is all about?",
        "Tom: We're talking about you, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Well, just don't put the cuffs on too tightly.",
        "Tom: Well, you're not here so we can put you into custody.",
        "Barbara: I'm not?",
        "Tom: You're here so we can set you free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What I remember most is feeling totally wiped out. Exhausted.",
        "Paul: From what?",
        "Emily: From whatever was making me sick, I guess. And I know it's crazy, but Barbara was actually nice about it. She made me tea. She made sure I got my rest. She never made me feel that I wasn't pulling my weight around the house.",
        "Paul: That's what makes you think that you were getting along?",
        "Emily: I guess. She made me feel like there was nothing I had to worry about. I just put it all in her hands. Alison!",
        "Alison: Guess who's got dinner? Emily, is everything okay?",
        "Emily: Everything's just fine.",
        "Paul: Hi, Alison.",
        "Emily: Paul was just asking me some questions, honey.",
        "Alison: Isn't that supposed to be up to the police?",
        "Emily: Ali --",
        "Paul: No, no, it's fine. Look, after the way I treated you when you dropped by at Fairwinds, you have every right to be suspicious. But the questions that I'm asking are only for my own information, and I'm not going to share the answers with anybody. Maybe, maybe I should just go.",
        "Emily: Paul, wait. Wait, wait, stop. Can you just give Rosanna a message for me?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Emily: Tell her how sorry I am. Tell her that I would never, if I was in my right mind, do those things to hurt her family. She must really hate me.",
        "Alison: I ran into her with Will. I didn't get the impression that she hates you at all. It's like she's worried about you.",
        "Emily: What about Will?",
        "Alison: I don't know. But Rosanna said something that got me thinking. I'll wait until we're alone.",
        "Emily: No. Honey, honey, no, no, whatever you have to say, say it in front of Paul. It's okay.",
        "Alison: It's important.",
        "Emily: Just say it.",
        "Alison: Are you sure? It's about a map.",
        "Emily: Go on.",
        "Alison: I was thinking maybe it was wrong for me to burn it. That map could have been the one thing to prove you're innocent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Now that I'm here, is there anything that I can do to help? Can I carry something or --?",
        "Ben: Oh, no, no. This is the last of it, thanks.",
        "Jessica: Well, since you're all packed up, can I interest you in dinner?",
        "Aaron: Dr. Harris! Oh, glad to run into you. Hi, Ms. Griffin, how are you?",
        "Jessica: Hi, Aaron.",
        "Ben: How's everything going?",
        "Aaron: Dr. Hughes wants me to do another round of tests.",
        "Ben: Terrific. Glad to hear he took my suggestion.",
        "Aaron: Your suggestion? I didn't know you still worked here.",
        "Ben: Well, I resigned from the hospital, but I still care about my patients.",
        "Aaron: Well, since this was your idea, maybe you can tell me what these tests are all about?",
        "Ben: Well, actually, I've been thinking about your case, Aaron, going over it in my mind and I'm confident that you can regain the use of your right arm.",
        "Aaron: Are you serious?",
        "Ben: Hey, if the test show what I think they'll show --",
        "Aaron: That's incredible! So you think it can be can fixed?",
        "Ben: I can't guarantee it, but --",
        "Aaron: You're the first person to give me hope. I mean, that's more than enough. That's plenty. I -- Dr. Harris, do you think you can maybe look at my scans when they're all finished with me?",
        "Ben: Well, um --",
        "Aaron: Please, 'cause Dr. Ramirez is on vacation, he's out of the country, and I can't wait that long. I'm here today and I want results today, you know?",
        "Ben: I would love to help you, Aaron, but I can't.",
        "Jessica: Actually, you can. Aaron is entitled to his hospital records. And he can ask anyone he wants to review them.",
        "Aaron: You heard the lawyer.",
        "Ben: Well, you won't get any argument from me.",
        "Aaron: Nice! Done. So -- so, you gonna stick around?",
        "Ben: Hey, I'd love to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why would I waste time trying to make you jealous? You've made it crystal clear that you're in love with Jennifer now.",
        "Mike: Glad I got through to you.",
        "Katie: Right. So if you can move on and forget about everything we had, everything we shared, then so can I. If you can forget about what it felt like to hold each other, so can I. If you can just move on without a second glance, then, hey, make room for the rest of us.",
        "Mike: You were telling me that you are madly in love with Henry.",
        "Katie: What Henry and I have is -- it's not a flash in the pan, you know. It's the real thing. It's -- it's the kind that lasts. I've always loved Henry, I guess. He's always been there for me. Through Simon, through you -- never wavering, never doubting, always there for me. It's like that saying that you hear at weddings -- love is patient and kind and never gives up. How does it go? \"Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.\"",
        "Mike: Give me a break.",
        "Katie: All I'm saying is that true love can be staring you right in the face and you may not realize it.",
        "Mike: And you're telling me that that's you and Henry?",
        "Katie: St. Valentine's day. I hope you can make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much for your help, Murray. He loved it. As I always say, there's nothing a brand new car can't fix.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Will remembering]",
        "Rosanna: But why would you do this to me?",
        "Hal: Emily? My Emily?",
        "Paul: We have proof.",
        "Will: There was a woman in that house, Dad. I found her there, and she took off running.",
        "Rosanna: Emily is my sister's best friend and she's never been anything but kind to me. There's just no reason that she would do something like this to me.",
        "Paul: What the hell is this supposed to mean?",
        "Will: I don't know.",
        "Hal: 'Cause if you think this is going to help Will, then you're out of your mind.",
        "Rosanna: This insanity has got to end.",
        "Paul: It was Emily.",
        "Will: She didn't do it to you, Rosanna. She did it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I'm free? You're serious?",
        "Tom: Well, not free, exactly. But the court has expanded your radius. You're no longer confined to Hal's house.",
        "Barbara: Why? What happened?",
        "Hal: Rick Decker was arrested in Oregon.",
        "Barbara: They got Rick. He's locked up?",
        "Hal: Yes. Maximum security. Which is why we're rethinking this protective custody thing. But you're still gonna be monitored, so no matter where you go, don't get cocky.",
        "Barbara: I know, but just think about it. I can get a haircut, I can get a facial, I can get a manicure. Oh, and think, Hal, I can do all the grocery shopping for you. Run errands for you.",
        "Hal: Oh, my God. Please tell me she can move back into the Lakeview?",
        "Tom: Not yet. She's still under your supervision for the time being. But I will go file that.",
        "Barbara: Thanks, Tom. So, guess you're stuck with me a while longer. And I promise I won't get underfoot. You'll have all of your privacy. I know how difficult this is for you.",
        "Hal: No, you don't. You don't have a clue.",
        "Barbara: I just wish -- I know it's silly, but I -- I just wish Will could come home and live with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What map are you talking about?",
        "Emily: I -- I remember drawing a map of Fairwinds and then hiding it in Daniel's backpack. I asked Alison to get rid of it for me.",
        "Paul: You asked her to destroy evidence?",
        "Alison: I burned it because I wanted to. Not because anyone told me to.",
        "Emily: Look, please just don't turn her in, okay? She was just trying to protect me. Blame me.",
        "Alison: No, but that's just the thing -- that map could have been your \"get out of jail free\" card, but I blew it.",
        "Paul: Well, how do you figure?",
        "Alison: Well, something has been bothering me about that map ever since I found it. And Rosanna said something that made it all click.",
        "Paul: What did she say?",
        "Alison: Well, she couldn't understand how Emily knew where to find Cabot's Christmas stuff.",
        "Emily: I guess that's why I needed a map.",
        "Alison: But you made that map yourself, Emily. How did you pull that off? Since when did you know Fairwinds like the back of your hand? That place is like a maze, right? And how much time have you spent there?",
        "Emily: Some, a long time ago. But there've been so many owners since and they've all made such huge changes. I'd be lucky if I could find the bathroom on my own.",
        "Alison: Then how did you draw the floor plan with such detail? Every corridor, every room?",
        "Emily: I don't know. But I remember drawing it.",
        "Alison: Then someone had to tell you how.",
        "Paul: Someone who knew Fairwinds outside and in.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Henry: I say we buy a whole case of champagne, drink to our future all night.",
        "Emily: Alison? Alison --",
        "Barbara: Hello, Emily. I think it's time we had a little chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Wow. That was -- that was some kiss.",
        "Katie: That wasn't a kiss. That was called sealing the deal.",
        "Henry: You want to seal it again? Just in case.",
        "Katie: Oh, down, boy.",
        "Mike: Did you see that?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, it was hard to miss.",
        "Mike: I don't know whether to applaud or throw rotten tomatoes.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I have a better idea.",
        "Mike: Anything.",
        "Jennifer: We buy another round of champagne.",
        "Mike: Maybe we can get some of that non-alcoholic, sparkling cider stuff. You know, something fake and tasteless like their engagement.",
        "Jennifer: Be nice.",
        "Mike: It's a joke! Those two aren't in love with each other.",
        "Jennifer: It's not really our business, is it?",
        "Mike: For one thing, they have nothing in common.",
        "Jennifer: They -- they're both a little flaky. I mean, in a nice way. And they're both devious, in a very scary way. And they've known each other forever. And they even live together. What more do you need?",
        "Mike: Okay, some people say they see Elvis ice skating on Snyder's pond. It doesn't make it so.",
        "Jennifer: So are you buying the next round or am I?",
        "Mike: I'll buy the booze, but I'm not buying the act.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, one thing that my mother taught me -- if you can't be happy, be quiet.",

        "Hal: If you think that there is a chance in hell that you, and me and Will are gonna be one happy family, then you better double-up on your shrink appointments.",
        "Barbara: There's no need to be cruel.",
        "Hal: I'm not being cruel, being honest. That is my house, that is Emily's house. And Emily is my wife. And as soon as I figure out what the heck is going on --",
        "Barbara: I assume she didn't pass the polygraph test.",
        "Hal: That is none of your business!",
        "Barbara: Okay. And that house is not my house, and you are not my husband. But Will is still my son.",
        "Hal: And Will, right now, has nothing to do with this. So you can stay out of that, too.",
        "Barbara: Okay. I know how much pressure you must be under, Hal. After all, you are the husband of the accused and the chief of detectives. I understand how divided your loyalties are.",
        "Hal: They've been divided before.",
        "Barbara: And just as you've done before, I know you'll do what's right by Will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Alison's right. . There's no way I could've drawn that map on my own.",
        "Alison: And maybe it would've really helped your case, but we can't show it to anybody because it's gone.",
        "Emily: Honey.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but I saw it. So did Aaron what if we went to Hal and we could tell him?",
        "Emily: What? That you destroyed evidence? He'd love that.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, it's better than letting you sit behind bars for something you didn't do.",
        "Emily: But I did do it. I just don't know why or how. .",
        "Alison: I could go to Hal and I could tell him --",
        "Emily: No. You tell him nothing. You listen to me. I don't want you caught up in the middle of this. You promise me you're not going to say anything.",
        "Alison: Okay. I promise. What about him?",
        "Paul: Oh, I won't tell a soul.",
        "Emily: Thanks. So what now?",
        "Paul: I'll try and dig up some answers. I'll get back to you. I'll be in touch.",
        "Alison: He knows everything?",
        "Emily: Almost. Don't look at me like that, okay? I think he's -- he's starting to believe me.",
        "Alison: Are you sure?",
        "Emily: No. But if he's going to give me the benefit of the doubt, I'll take it. What else have I got to lose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Ms. Ryan, Lieutenant Munson will be right with you.",
        "Barbara: Paul! I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Paul: I thought I'd sit down and have a word with the accused.",
        "Barbara: Oh, you saw Emily. I can only imagine what she had to say.",
        "Paul: You'd be surprised.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Now that your office is all cleared out, what are you going to do?",
        "Ben: Probably hang out, wait for Aaron's test results. Look, you don't have to stick around if you have other plans.",
        "Jessica: Oh, no. No, no. Nothing that can't wait. Hey, did you hear Bonnie and Isaac are going house hunting?",
        "Ben: No. I haven't talked to Isaac since New Year's Eve.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. You know, the house, with Bonnie, the house has got to be just right.",
        "Ben: And Isaac will give her the world.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. And Sarah's made the honor roll again. I'm just so proud of them.",
        "Ben: Yeah. It seems like in spite of everything, they've been able to make it work.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Well, when Bonnie sets her mind to something, it's there forever. She's crazy about Isaac.",
        "Ben: He's crazy about her.",
        "Jessica: And they're not letting anything come between them. I guess there's something to be said for being stubborn.",
        "Aaron: I'm glad you're still here.",
        "Ben: Hey. So, how'd the test go?",
        "Aaron: Heck if I know. All I did was lie there.",
        "Ben: Right.",
        "Aaron: Okay, so I told them to page you with the results. So if you figure out anything, please don't hesitate. Just please tell me.",
        "Ben: Definitely.",
        "Aaron: Okay. And I hope you found what you're looking for.",
        "Ben: All right. You know, with any luck, pretty soon you're gonna be shaking with that other arm.",
        "Aaron: You know, that's music to my ears. Thank you so much, Dr. Harris.",

        "Jennifer: Would it kill you to smile? Whether Katie's faking it or not, she's out of your life. She's no longer your responsibility, so why do you care so much?",

        "[Loud clearing of throats]",
        "Jennifer: Guys, save some for the honeymoon.",
        "Katie: Oh, sorry. Sometimes we forget where we are.",
        "Jennifer: Mike and I would like to be the first to toast the happy couple's nuptials.",
        "Henry: Oh!",
        "Katie: If I were a fortune teller, I'd say some have doubts about the happy part.",
        "Mike: But you're not.",
        "Katie: Happy?",
        "Mike: A fortune teller.",
        "Jennifer: To Katie -- best wishes. And to Henry -- a man who kept his head even while he lost his heart.",
        "Katie: Oh, isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard?",
        "Jennifer: May the most you wish for be the least you receive.",
        "Henry: Well, that is beautiful. That's just beautiful. Cheers.",
        "Katie: Cheers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Poor Emily. It's frightening how a seemingly rational person can have such a dark side. I mean, here she was pretending to love Will, pretending to accept his release from the hospital, and all the while plotting to send him back there. But I know that Hal will get her the best professional help there is.",
        "Paul: Actually, Hal doesn't think she needs to see a doctor.",
        "Barbara: Oh, but Paul, surely Hal knows that after what she tried to do to Will, what she did to Rosanna, she needs help.",
        "Paul: And she's getting it. From the most unlikely of sources.",
        "Tom: Hello, Paul.",
        "Paul: Hi, Tom.",
        "Tom: Just the man I wanted to see. You saved me a phone call.",
        "Paul: Regarding what?",
        "Tom: Regarding Barbara's status. The paperwork's been filed to lift those restrictions.",
        "Paul: What's going on?",
        "Tom: Well, she's no longer required to limit herself to Hal's place. She can come and go as she pleases within a certain radius.",
        "Paul: Are you people out of your minds?",
        "Tom: Well the arrangement was officially made to protect her from Rick Decker, and he's been apprehended. So she's no longer bound to those terms. It's been adjusted by the court.",
        "Paul: Great. That's just great.",
        "Tom: She will still be monitored and there are certain requirements you have to meet. And I have a list of dos and don'ts for you regarding that.",
        "Paul: Well, Mother, things are really looking up for you. I'm very happy for you. And I'll be watching. See you all soon.",
        "Tom: Now, you need to abide by these rules or your privileges will be revoked. They're pretty self-explanatory. There's still gonna be a curfew. You're gonna have to check -- check in \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Did Paul actually say the words, \"I believe in you\"?",
        "Emily: No. Not exactly. But he's listening now and that's major progress, right?",
        "Alison: Well, one minute he's ready to lock you up and the next he's visiting you in jail?",
        "Emily: Honey, I made a full confession. As full as I could. And maybe he realized I wasn't trying to deny anything and there's a possibility that I could be telling the truth.",
        "Alison: Or it could blow up in your face. You haven't talked to a lawyer yet. No one has told you what to say or what to keep private.",
        "Emily: I know. I've thought about that. And I've decided to go with the old saying that the truth will set you free.",
        "Alison: I hope so.",
        "Emily: Honey, whatever happens, I will never forget what you've done for me. Especially considering what happened with me and Chris and everything.",

        "Barbara: Hello, Emily. I think it's time we had a little chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Was that not the most romantic toast you've ever heard?",
        "Henry: Yes. I say we buy a whole case of champagne, drink to our future all night.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, that might not be too good, 'cause you know what happens when we get too tipsy, schnookums.",
        "Henry: Indeed I do, pookie-kissums. Here. Before we do that -- may our only pain be cham-pagne.",
        "Katie: Oh, I like that one. We'll have to remember that for our wedding night.",
        "Henry: Yeah. All night.",
        "Mike: Well, it looks like you guys have a lot of planning to do, so have at it. Let's go.",

        "Katie: Oh, good. I'm sorry I grabbed you like that.",
        "Henry: What? Is that a joke? Are you kidding me? That's one for the record book. 'Cause if I knew you could kiss like that, I would've married you years ago.",
        "Katie: Did you see Mike's face? He wanted to beat you to a pulp.",
        "Henry: One man's pleasure is another man's pain.",
        "Katie: You really think he was in pain? Or are you just saying that to make me feel better?",
        "Henry: I know pain when I see it.",
        "Katie: I wonder what he was thinking?",
        "Henry: He was probably kicking himself for tossing you aside. When he saw you happy, and being treated the way you ought to be treated, it probably killed him.",
        "Katie: I cannot believe the lengths you are willing to go to help me.",
        "Henry: It's nothing. It's just another favor for a friend.",
        "Katie: It's more than that.",
        "Henry: And we've always been more than friends.",
        "Katie: And less than lovers. So, promise me something, Henry. Okay?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Katie: If you ever stop being okay with this, will you tell me? 'Cause I don't want you to be disappointed.",
        "Henry: Why would I be disappointed?",
        "Katie: Because despite what Mike says, I know what's in his heart. And there's no way in the world he's gonna let me go through with this wedding. He's gonna stop it before it ever starts. I'll be right back.",
        "Henry: We'll see about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I promise I will take you to an incredible dinner at Lakeview. But if I sat around that \"happy couple\" much longer, I was gonna lose my appetite.",
        "Jennifer: At least one of them is happy for real. Henry really does love Katie.",
        "Mike: Maybe. But Katie only feels friendship for Henry.",
        "Jennifer: Purely platonic?",
        "Mike: Exactly.",
        "Jennifer: Like we were? Hmm? We were friends first, remember? Now look where we are. Stranger things have happened. It's her life, remember?",
        "Mike: Right again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: How'd things go with Emily?",
        "Alison: Good. How about you? Does that smile mean they gave you good news?",
        "Aaron: Well, I don't have the test results yet. Okay, but -- I probably shouldn't even talk about it. I shouldn't talk about it until I find out that --",
        "Alison: You can't just say something like that and leave me hanging.",
        "Aaron: All right, all right. Okay. Now, it's not official, okay? They don't know anything yet, but they think they -- they can fix my arm.",

        "Rosanna: Was it something important?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I mean, I still need to do some checking, but I think I may be on to something with Emily and what really happened.",
        "Roseanna: Oh, that's great. Oh, I want to hear everything, but I have something very exciting to tell you first.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Roseanna: Yeah. [Doorbell rings] Oh. Um --",
        "Paul: Hold that thought.",
        "Roseanna: Yeah, okay. Hey, Will.",
        "Paul: Look who I found.",
        "Roseanna: Wow. The car was so quiet I didn't even hear you drive up.",

        "Paul: You got a car? Cool. Can I see?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. What happened?",
        "Will: I drove up to Soldier's Hill, and the next thing I knew, the brakes gave out. The car rolled down a hill and -- boom -- I barely got out in time.",
        "Rosanna: Wait a minute. Your brand-new car went over a cliff?",
        "Will: You should have seen it. The thing got totaled. No hard feelings though, right?",

        "Emily: You're the last person I expected to see here.",
        "Barbara: Did you think that I was just going to ignore what you've done? You tried to get my son recommitted to the asylum.",
        "Emily: That's not true. I love Will.",
        "Barbara: Oh, that's what you told everyone. Hal believed it. Paul believed it. And poor will, he believed it, too. He trusted you. And so all I want to know, Emily, is why. Why? Why did you betray all the people who love you and believe in you?",
        "Emily: I don't know.",
        "Barbara: You must know. You have to know. No idea whatsoever?",
        "Emily: No. I think it's time for you to leave.",
        "Barbara: Well, I know that you must be going through hell right now, terrified that Hal's going to turn his back on you. And I'm sure you're not going to like to hear this very much, but I think the best thing you can do for yourself is to take responsibility for what you've done.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Barbara: Don't prolong your agony any longer. Get the help you so desperately need. Clear your guilty conscience before this goes any further.",
        "Emily: I would never hurt Will or Rosanna.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Emily.",
        "Emily: You know what? I don't give a damn what you think. 'Cause I know what's in my heart and what's in my head. And hurting some poor, grieving woman, making her think she's crazy, isn't my style.",
        "Barbara: I tried to help you. I thought we were really getting along. And this is how you repay my kindness? By trying to frame my son so they would put him away?",
        "Emily: If I wanted anyone put away, it sure as hell wouldn't be Will. And I got news for you. Not everyone thinks I'm the only one responsible for what happened at Fairwinds.",
        "Barbara: \"Not everyone.\" Who? Hal? Who else? Paul? Your little sister, the fire bug? They're not going to help you, Emily. Only you can help you. The evil we do eventually catches up to us.",
        "Emily: Like it caught up to you, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: You haven't heard. I'm free. Things are finally looking up for me. But as for you? Nothing can save you now.",
