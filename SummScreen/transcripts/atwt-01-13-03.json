        "Lily: This is Natalie's duck! This is her favorite. I have to give it \r\nto her.",
        "Holden: No, it's too late. They're already halfway down the road.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Holden: Besides, I don't really think she's gonna miss it. Lily, \r\nthey're only gonna be gone for a couple of hours.",
        "Lily: I know. It's just our first separation from Natalie since she was \r\nborn. And --",
        "[Lily sighs] I just need a minute.",

        "Holden: No, uh-uh. No, you're not gonna do that. No way. No \r\nhousekeeping, okay?",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Holden: Not tonight. Sit. What is that?",
        "Lily: Silence.",
        "Holden: Silence. I know we get a little crazy raising the kids \r\nsometimes, but I really think we should take advantage of this moment.",

        "Oliver: Dr. Harris, it's best you come back when my son is feeling up \r\nto a visit.",
        "Ben: Look, I'm not here for a visit. I'm here to do my job. It's not \r\nuncommon for a post-op patient to be a bit fuzzy, even -- even paranoid. \r\nEspecially with the medication he had --",
        "Marshall: Don't patronize me, Harris. Look, I may have been nearly \r\nblinded, but I see the situation clear as day.",
        "Oliver: Son, listen --",
        "Marshall: No, dad. This man has threatened me before because of \r\nJessica. At least he had the guts to do it to my face. Now you wait till I'm \r\nknocked out on the table? The very definition of a coward.",
        "Ben: Let me tell you something -- I saved your miserable life twice!",
        "Marshall: What, and that's supposed to make you some kind of hero?",
        "Ben: No, it makes me a man who had a job to do, and I did it well. You \r\nshould be thankful that a surgeon is what I am.",
        "Oliver: I'm sure you're a good one, but listen --",

        "Craig: Lucinda, I don't really care what you think. But I do care about \r\nSierra, and I always will.",
        "Lucinda: And you have an inspired way of showing it. You take her kid \r\naway from her. You send her packing to that damn little island in tears.",
        "Craig: What would you do if you couldn't hate my guts? My marriage to \r\nyour daughter is over. Life has moved on. And I suggest you consider doing the \r\nsame.",

        "Craig: I'll go find Lucy.",
        "Lucinda: And I'm curious about something -- these hospital visits. Are \r\nthey going to be to deliver more flowers for Lucy or to drum up support with \r\nLucy for her next new stepmother? It's just like you, Craig. It really is. To \r\nuse Lucy's amnesia to sell the idea to her that she likes Ms. Cabot. But I'm not \r\ngoing to allow that.",

        "Molly: She would tell me. Wouldn't she? I mean, 'cause we're best \r\nfriends. We tell each other everything. But, then again, she never copped to \r\nsleeping with Craig. So --",
        "Mike: Maybe she was a little bit embarrassed. You know? She just -- I'm \r\nglad she's not getting you mixed up in all that mess.",
        "Molly: Still, it would explain why Rosanna keeps jumping down her \r\nthroat. Why it was just so weird around the two of them. Oh, my God. If Carly is \r\npregnant, then -- no.",

Out there in California. Uh -- I don't know. That's what I \r\nwould wish for. What about you? Tell me what you would wish for, and I'll see \r\nwhat I can do.",

        "Mike: Good. Because Jack and Carly have had enough of that, especially \r\nafter having to give J .J. back. I mean, it's been a rough couple of months for \r\nthem, so let's just let them be. You and Carly can't get any closer. She'll tell \r\nyou whatever she wants, whenever she wants.
