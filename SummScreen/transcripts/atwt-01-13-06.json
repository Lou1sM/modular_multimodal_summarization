        "Luke: So, just a question -- since you and Mom are technically still married, why renew your vows?",
        "Holden: Well, there's nothing technical about it. We're married.",
        "Luke: So why do you need a ceremony?",
        "Holden: Because sometimes a husband and wife need to remember why they got married in the first place.",
        "Luke: Why did you get married? And don't tell me it's because you loved each other -- I'm not six, you can tell me the real reason.",
        "Holden: The real reason?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Please don't, honey. No, please, don't.",
        "Lily: Just stand still, just for a second.",
        "Lucinda: Stop. It's a wig.",
        "Lily: I know it's a wig.",
        "Lucinda: It's a wig. That's all.",
        "Lily: Let me just fix it.",
        "Lucinda: No, I don't want you to fuss. Your daughter wants a change in her hairdo, and she's got the hair.",
        "Lily: I will fix her after I fix you. Come on, just a little bit. Just right there, that's it.",
        "Lucinda: This is as good as gets. It's dead hair. All right. Honey, I think -- I think I'm just going to go upstairs, just for a few minutes.",
        "Lily: Are you all right?",
        "Lucinda: My daughter's getting married and I feel crummy, damn it. But on we go, on we go.",
        "Lily: I'm so sorry.",
        "Lucinda: I'm sorry, too, baby. And I can't predict it, whether it's a good day or bad day, or what --",
        "Lily: You're having a bad day?",
        "Lucinda: Well, it's a middling day. But, you know, I'm still here. That's what counts.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I think I'm just going to go upstairs. I'll telephone Daddy Bob, maybe he can give you away.",
        "Lily: What? No, he's not going to give me away. You're going to give me away.",
        "Lucinda: Baby, I don't want to toss chowder in the middle of your vows.",
        "Lily: That's why I got you a bouquet.",
        "Lucinda: I love you. I don't want to let you down.",
        "Lily: You're never going to let me down. You have never let me down, and you never will. Ever. Never.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Looking sharp, J.D. Looking sharp. Where's your mama? Jenny, you're gonna run us late.",
        "Jennifer: No, the wedding doesn't start for another hour. We have plenty of time.",
        "Dusty: Let the woman look, but don't let her know you care. You gotta play it cool, kid.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, you two look so cute.",
        "Dusty: Well, cute wasn't really the look we were going for, but we'll take it.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then how is suave? Debonair? Sexy? And, oh, so delicious!",
        "Dusty: You look beautiful.",
        "Jennifer: Come here, come here. You think?",
        "Dusty: Yes, I know. Your mother's a knockout. Here. My turn. Say \"Knockout.\"",
        "Jennifer: Knockout. What are we going to do with all these pictures, huh?",
        "Dusty: We're going to put them in an album. Or, you know, the computer or something.",
        "Jennifer: The three of us?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Yeah, what, bad idea?",
        "Jennifer: No. I love it. I think it's great.",
        "Dusty: But what?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I don't know, it's just -- I don't know. The three of us together, going out together like a family, it's -- I don't know, it's ridiculous. And it's really -- it's way too soon, but, I don't know, it all just feels right, you know? You, me, Johnny, just like we belong together.",

        "[Carly clearing her throat]",
        "Carly: What do you think?",
        "Jack: Well, that's some dress. When'd you get that?",
        "Carly: Now, when was the last time I bought a dress, Jack? I made it. Do you like it?",
        "Jack: Oh, it's terrific, are you kidding me? Now if you could just whip me up a new snowsuit, some tires for the van, and a couple pairs of hockey skates, that'd be fantastic.",
        "Carly: I know, sweetheart, I'm sorry. But the boys, you know, their feet grow. And they can't play hockey without skates. And sage grew out of her snowsuit.",
        "Jack: Honey -- I know that, honey, but until something opens up at work, maybe we can just work off of one credit card. Its give me a chance to stay even with the others. I'm working off half pay here, you know what I mean?",
        "Carly: Right, right. I was thinking -- I saw Barbara at the hospital today, and she offered me a job. Now, I know what you're going to say. That Barbara is Barbara, and she never changes, but we know that. And if she's going to pay me to do something that I'm already doing, then it doesn't even matter if it's just for a month or two, you know? Jack, it could help us get through. It could really help.",
        "Jack: Here.",
        "Carly: What is this?",
        "Jack: Its paper. So you can write your children a note explaining why you were kidnapped or held hostage.",
        "Carly: It's just temporary, honey. Who knows, maybe she'll recommend me to somebody else.",
        "Jack: And why -- why would she do that? Recommend you to the competition.",
        "Carly: Because she wants to help out.",
        "Jack: Oh, Barbara Ryan wants to help out. Here, make sure you make a note that I said no and you went behind my back and did it anyway.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to go behind your back, Jack.",
        "Jack: Things have changed.",
        "Carly: People can change.",
        "Jack: Not Barbara Ryan. And not me when it comes to you sitting on the hot seat because of something Barbara wants. And I know she wants something, or she wouldn't have dangled this job thing in front of you the way she did. You can lie to yourself, honey, but don't lie to me. I see right through it.",
        "Carly: Well, what about if I get a website? You know, I could start out with a limited line and sell online.",
        "Jack: Okay, how about this? How about I talk to Hal?",
        "Carly: You've already talked to Hal.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that was before I found out about Nick Kasnoff. And from what I've heard, it's not going to be long before he screws up on the job.",
        "Carly: And then Hal will need you back.",
        "Jack: That's the plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Lou, you got a minute? I was going over the case files.",
        "Hal: I am your lieutenant, Detective, and that's how you will address me. Not Lou. Not chief. Lieutenant.",
        "Nick: Yes, sir.",
        "Hal: And if you'll let me get my coat off, and maybe get a cup of coffee, we will talk about the cases I'm going to assign you.",
        "Nick: Well, I found a case that interests me. It's the Paul Ryan disappearance. I'd like to handle it, if that's okay with you.",
        "Hal: I'm working this case, Nick. Choose another one, and we'll discuss it.",
        "Nick: With all due respect, Lieutenant, it seems like there's a real conflict of interest if you handle that case. I'm a better choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Come on, Meg. Where are you?",
        "Meg: Watch it!",
        "Emily: What's all this? Hey, hey!",
        "Meg: Let go of me!",
        "Emily: Vials, needles? What, are you opening a pharmacy, Meg? Or is this all for you?",
        "Meg: None of your business.",
        "Emily: You stole those drugs, didn't you? You stole these drugs from the hospital. Look, I know you were fired. What'd you do? Stock up on your way out the door?",
        "Meg: That's right, Emily. I stole a box of meds, and now I'm going to go online and make a fortune. So go ahead, call the cops, let's get this over with.",
        "Emily: Calm down.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, you caught me. You're right. You're right. Let's get the cops over here and we can trade accusations.",
        "Emily: What does that mean? What, are you accusing me of something?",
        "[Meg remembering]",
        "Paul: Emily shot me. But I don't want anyone to know that, you understand? In fact, if anyone finds out, our little deal is off.",
        "Emily: You listen to me. If you're charging me with something, I want to know what it is.",
        "Meg: Let's just say that neither one of us wants to talk to the cops.",
        "Emily: What are you implying?",
        "Meg: Oh, I think it's pretty obvious. You think I stole the meds, and I think that you and Paul deserve each other.",
        "Emily: We broke up.",
        "Meg: Or so the story goes.",
        "Emily: What are you saying?",
        "Meg: Do I really need to spell it out for you, Emily?",
        "Emma: Meg?",
        "Meg: Oh, Mama. Hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Emma: I came by to get some pastries for your brother's wedding reception.",
        "Meg: Store-bought pastries -- that's not like you, Mama. But then again, this isn't the first time they've done this.",
        "Emma: Don't be mean. This ceremony means a lot to your brother.",
        "Meg: He knows I'm not coming, I already talked to him about that. So I don't want any lectures, I'm not in the mood.",
        "Emma: This is not a lecture, this is not a lecture. It's just -- it's a family occasion. I don't want you to miss out on it, that's all.",
        "Meg: Mama, everyone there knows that I was fired, and that I'm the one who kept the blessed Jennifer from her perfect child.",
        "Emma: What has gotten into you, Meg?",
        "Meg: Look, I just don't want to see anybody getting married, okay? You go have a great time, and I promise, I'll come over and take a look at the pictures.",
        "Emma: Your brother wants you to be there.",
        "Meg: Please, stop with the guilt. It's bad enough everybody in town is judging me.",
        "Emma: It's just going to be family. And as far as judging you, nobody has any time for all of that. You know, life moves on, honey, so just don't -- just don't sit there, wasting it feeling sorry for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What are you apologizing for?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know, rushing you? Making assumptions? I guess it all sounds kind of presumptuous of me.",
        "Dusty: Presumptuous? I'm the one who said we should move in together. You said we should keep things separate for a while.",
        "Jennifer: Only because it's -- it's romantic. Having you pick me up for a date. But, I don't know, I just -- all of this, you and Johnny and I, it just feels really good together. And I'm not wanting you to say anything, I just wanted to let you know that it feels really right.",
        "Dusty: Well, I don't have a lot to compare it to. I've been alone most of my life, and now I'm not. I got you, and I got him. I got J.D. I got J.D., 'Cause he's the man. And everybody shows up for the man. And if someone on the street says, \"Hey, buddy. That's a nice looking family you got there.\" I'm good with it. I'm so proud of you guys.",
        "Jennifer: You really get to me, you know?",
        "Dusty: You get to me more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Margo's working time and a half as it is, Hal's up to his neck at city hall, that leaves him a half dozen uniforms and Nick, who can't carry the weight.",
        "Carly: You know that he can't really get rid of Nick until he gives him fair trial.",
        "Jack: That's what I'm saying. If we can just get through these next couple of weeks, we'll be fine.",
        "Carly: Oh, hey. Wedding dresses. I was talking to Mindy Crawford at playgroup, and she mentioned to me that her sister's getting married, and she asked me if I knew anybody who could make her sister a dress.",
        "Jack: Look, honey, I talked to Mike. That's why I was over there. He thinks he can throw me some construction work.",
        "Carly: But this is all my fault, sweetheart. I really want to help out.",
        "Jack: I know you want to help out, and you are helping out. You're buying hockey skates and tires and new snowsuits, and you're keeping our kids healthy and happy, honey. You want to make a dozen dresses, go for it. I want you to. But don't worry about the money. I got that covered. As soon as Hal realizes that he's in way over his head with this Paul Ryan situation, he's going to need my help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: And the fact is that you have a real personal interest in this Paul Ryan case, and if you need me to tell you that --",
        "Hal: No, the only thing I need you to tell me is why I should keep you on.",
        "Nick: It's 'cause I'm the best.",
        "Hal: The best? If you walked into a crime scene the way you walked into this squad room, you'd be shot before you even realized you were in trouble. A good detective needs to learn to look and listen before he opens his mouth.",
        "Nick: All I was doing was going over the cases.",
        "Hal: A good detective wouldn't dream of questioning his superior officer until he'd gotten the lay of the land. And since you haven't bothered to talk to your fellow officers, or learn the rules, I will lay them out for you. Rule number one -- this is my squad room. Rule number two -- what I say goes. Rule number three -- forget rules one and two, and you're out. Do we understand each other, Detective?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Why was she the one?",
        "Holden: Well, we met when we were your age. She was just so beautiful. I just loved everything about her.",
        "Luke: So you two looked at each other and you both got hit by lightning or whatever?",
        "Holden: She shouldn't have looked at me at all. I was just this poor farm kid working in her mother's stables.",
        "Luke: And Grandma Lucinda didn't like you.",
        "Holden: No, she didn't. But she changed her mind since then. But at the time, who did I think I was to fall in love with Lily Walsh? But your mother, she didn't care. Because she loved me for me. And I guess that was the clincher, and the hell with what all her rich friends thought.",
        "Luke: That took guts.",
        "Holden: Yeah, it did.",
        "Luke: But weren't you, I don't know, just a little bit scared to be getting mixed up with somebody -- I mean, I'm just guessing here, but your friends didn't approve, either.",
        "Holden: Well, nobody thought we'd last. But we did. Because I know your mother's heart, and she knows mine. And we accept each other. That's what counts. Let me tell you this, if you're ever lucky enough to find someone who accepts you, you better hang on to that. Because that kind of love, it doesn't come around very often. And I guess that's why I'm remarrying your mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Don't worry, no one's going to judge you. It's just us.",
        "Lucinda: It can't be about poor, old Lucinda. I want the day to be about happy Lily and happy Holden.",
        "Lily: It will be.",
        "Lucinda: That's what I want.",
        "Lily: Don't worry.",
        "Lucinda: Because you know, no matter how green I may get around the gills, that nobody's happier than I am that you are getting married again.",
        "Lily: I know. Thank you. I know, I know.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey.",
        "Lily: Oh, wow!",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Lily: Look at that!",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Faith: Do we look pretty, Mommy?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Lily: Pretty colorful.",
        "Lucinda: Pretty? Oh, you look gorgeous.",
        "Lily: Wow. They look gorgeous, they do.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, where's the camera? We've got to get a camera.",
        "Lily: Oh, it's right there. It's right there on the chair, right there. You found my makeup again.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no kidding, they got in the makeup.",
        "Lily: And you gave it to your sister, as well.",
        "Lucinda: Mommy, do you want to get in the picture, too?",
        "Lily: Oh, no, no, you take it.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. All right.",
        "Lily: Cheese!",
        "[Door closing]",
        "Holden: I called the minister, he's on his way -- oh, my! Look at those cheeks. Oh!",
        "Lucinda: Yes, they look absolutely gorgeous.",
        "Lily: They do.",
        "Lucinda: And we've got the picture. And now that we have the documentation, maybe we can go upstairs, and maybe get a different look for an unassuming little home wedding.",
        "Lily: Are you sure you're up for that?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, I'm energized. Laughter is the best healer. Come on, we're going to have a date.",
        "Luke: Well, Dad told me why he fell in love with you 100 years ago.",
        "Lily: And why's that?",
        "Luke: It's 'cause you're hot, Mom.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm. How's he doing?",
        "Holden: He's calmer. Knowing that we're back together has made all the difference.",
        "Lily: Did you really tell him that I was hot?",
        "Holden: I did.",
        "Lily: You're a liar.",
        "Holden: You are hot.",
        "Lily: You're a big liar.",
        "Holden: No, I'm not.",
        "Lily: Not until after the wedding.",
        "Holden: I don't think that's going to work.",

        "Nick: I'm not looking for a fight.",
        "Hal: Well, you sure as hell found one.",
        "Nick: Look, all I was saying is that you shouldn't be working on this case. And okay, I know you don't want to hear it, but everybody else knows it.",
        "Hal: You're ambitious, Kasnoff.",
        "Nick: Detective Kasnoff. And what's wrong with that?",
        "Hal: I've fired more than one detective whose ambition got in the way of his judgment. You come in here fresh off the street, choosing your own assignments, questioning my judgment --",
        "Nick: I didn't mean to offend you, Lieutenant.",
        "Hal: Tell you what. You want the Ryan case? You got it. I better see results in a hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I need the pills. Come on, just get to the pills. Get to the pills.",
        "[Paul hallucinating.]",
        "Emily: Sorry, babe. You won't need these where you're going.",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Paul: It's okay. She's gone, she's gone. She's gone, and you're okay. You're okay. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay.",

        "Emily: Mom.",
        "Susan: Oh, sweetheart.",
        "Emily: Did you see Meg Snyder by chance?",
        "Susan: She was here.",
        "Emily: Yeah?",
        "Susan: She was cleaning out her locker. She got fired.",
        "Emily: Did she say anything about me?",
        "Susan: Why would she say anything about you?",
        "Emily: Mother, what did she say?",
        "Susan: Nothing, really.",
        "Emily: Well, I ran into her at the Lakeview, and she had this purse full of syringes and medications. And I think she stole them from the hospital.",
        "[Susan gasps]",
        "Susan: I wouldn't put it past her.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, you need to file a report.",
        "Susan: What is going on? Why the sudden interest in Meg Snyder?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: Good evening,",
        "Minister: Good evening, everyone. Thank you all for coming. I know your presence means a great deal to the bride and groom. And now, it is my distinct privilege to present Mr. and Mrs. Holden Snyder. Dearly beloved, we have come together in the presence of God and these witnesses to bless this man and woman as they renew their vows of holy matrimony.",
        "Carly: We should renew our vows.",
        "Jack: I already married you twice.",
        "Minister: The union of husband and wife in heart, body and mind --",
        "Carly: Are you saying you wouldn't marry me again?",
        "Jack: In every day, in every way.",
        "Minister: -- Is intended by God for their mutual joy.",
        "Carly: So we can renew our vows then.",
        "Jack: No. But as soon as we're out of debt, we're going on another honeymoon.",
        "Minister: -- And when it is God's will, for the procreation and nurturing of their children. It is not a union to be entered into lightly. And to undertake it yet again, well, all I can say is that these two people give new meaning to commitment. [Laughter] They know firsthand how difficult it can be to keep faith with one another, to sustain each other through hardship and doubt. And to stay optimistic about a shared future after life has almost torn them apart. And yet, they've chosen to renew their vows. Why? Because they also know how sweet life can be when you share it with someone you love. They know the bliss of becoming one. And the strength you gain when you have someone to trust.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: Holden and Lily know that marriage is a leap of faith and a lot of work, and that it's worth it. They've had a chance to think about what it would mean to continue on alone. And they've chosen to join forces and make a new beginning.",
        "Emma: Meg -- oh, Meg, sweetheart, I'm so sorry. I had no idea that Dusty and Jennifer were going to be here. Lily must have invited them.",
        "Meg: Whatever. I shouldn't have come. Look, you should go back inside, it's cold.",
        "Emma: Darling, you can't run away every time you see them. Oakdale's not that big.",
        "Meg: I'm not running away, Mama. Look, I'm sorry. I know you're worried about me, but I'll be fine, okay? It's just going to take some time. All right, here. Please give Holden and Lily my best, all right?",
        "Emma: Meg.",
        "Minister: Holden, as I understand it, you have something you'd like to say?",
        "Holden: Yes, I do. I spend most of my days in the barn with a bunch of horses, watching things grow, trying to fix things that don't. And that may make my world a bit simplistic. But, you know what, I think it is simple. You grow or you die. And you and me, it's never been easy. You change, I change. But I can't tell you what a rare pleasure it is to be with someone who's willing to be somebody different. Who's willing to try new things. Who's willing to make mistakes. We've both made mistakes and we'll make more. But as long as I know at the end of the day that you're there for me, it's all I need. I can't tell you how great it is to have you back home. And I promise you, this time around, I'm going to listen. I'm going to pay attention. I'm going to share what's in my heart, because you are so precious to me. And I'm never going to take you for granted again.",

        "Carly: Here, honey. It's Jack's, but it's clean.",
        "Lily: Family. That's what it's all about. Having almost lost all of you --",
        "Faith: You didn't lose us, Mommy.",
        "Lily: No, I didn't. Come here! No, you're -- both of you, you were always right there, weren't you. Come on over. Come on, sweetie. I am the luckiest woman in the world. To have you girls and your brother. Of course, your father. I have a sister out there thinking about me and a mother who is the bravest and most beautiful fighter that I know. And I promise all of you that I will make every, every moment count, because I am so grateful to have a second chance at happiness. So grateful to have a very patient husband. A kind and wonderful man. And a great kisser, too. [Laughter] No, I'm serious, he is. And he's also stubborn and ferocious. And thank God for that. Because on those days when I am willful and scared and stuck, I need you to get me out of my rut. And he does. And that's why we're all here today. Because your daddy didn't take no for an answer. So, yes, I will marry you again, and I will love you now and forever.",
        "Minister: Amen. And now, with apologies to Miss Faith, Holden, you may kiss your bride.",
