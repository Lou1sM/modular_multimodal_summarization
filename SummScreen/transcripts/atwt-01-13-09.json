        "Liberty: Whoa! Time out, guys. There's a very impressionable young girl in the room!",
        "Janet: What? Where? Where?",
        "Liberty: Excuse me, Mom. But there really is nothing more disturbing to my delicate sensibilities than the sight of two senior citizens sucking face.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Jack: She's charming, you know that? Very.",
        "Janet: I wonder who she belongs to.",
        "Liberty: And guys, making out in Emma's kitchen -- isn't that, like, sacrilegious?",
        "Jack: You're probably right. But we're working on that.",
        "Janet: That's right. We've got a bid on a place, and we're gonna hear later.",
        "Liberty: Oh, that's awesome! I can't wait till I can play you off of Dad for the privilege of having me stay over. I hear that there's cash and, like, valuable prizes --",
        "Jack: As much as I hate to leave this delightful conversation, I've got a shift starting. So --",
        "Janet: Bye.",
        "Liberty: Okay, guys. Warn me next time, please.",
        "Jack: Bye, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Bye. Can you stop looking so nauseatingly happy?",
        "Janet: I love being a newlywed. I love everything about it.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, that is very hard to tell.",
        "Janet: Especially the fact that my behavior is appropriate for my situation.",
        "Liberty: Okay, on that note, I'm actually going to leave this for you, and I'm gonna go.",
        "Janet: Wait, wait, whoa. What is that?",
        "Liberty: Oh, it's just some stuff that Katie said you left at the house. Have fun going looking through it.",
        "Janet: Ah-ah-ah-ah! Come back here. You're not going anywhere until we have a talk.",
        "Liberty: Oh, God. Not that, please.",
        "Janet: I want to know what's going on with you and Parker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Parker, what a nice surprise.",
        "Parker: How's it going?",
        "Craig: Sit down. I'll get us a couple of Bloody Mary's.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right.",
        "Craig: Oh, don't tell me they disapprove of teenage drinking before trigonometry.",
        "Parker: Well, there's actually no school today.",
        "Craig: Is today a holiday I'm not aware of?",
        "Parker: It's \"National teacher goof-off day.\" They're at some conference in Chicago learning how to be less boring.",
        "Craig: Oh, they've been doing that since I was in school. Question is, why would you come to a stuffy place like this?",
        "Parker: Well, I was looking for you, actually.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Parker: Yeah. I've got a present for Johnny. And I was hoping you'd give it to him for me.",
        "Craig: Parker, that's very thoughtful of you.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I mean, it's no fun to be in the hospital. And he's been through a lot.",
        "Craig: Yes, he has. And he loves trains.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I actually used to have one of these when I was a kid.",
        "Craig: You know, I think I recall, you and I played with this once.",
        "Parker: Yep. If I was there, the train probably was too.",
        "Craig: Well, he's going to love it. And I really appreciate it.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and also, I just wanted to thank you for helping out at Metro the other day. I mean, Liberty and I, we -- you could've blown the whistle on us, and you didn't. And we really appreciate it.",
        "Craig: I take it your parents don't approve?",
        "Parker: They have some minor trust issues, yeah.",
        "Craig: I don't see why. She seems like a lovely girl.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Yeah, she is.",
        "Craig: You really like her, don't you?",
        "Parker: It's kind of messed up. See, her mom just married my dad.",
        "Craig: What does that have to do with the two of you?",
        "Parker: Yeah, right?",
        "Craig: Is that what the issue is?",
        "Parker: It's one of them. They also think that we're too young.",
        "Craig: You're 16.",
        "Parker: And she's 17.",
        "Craig: How is that too young to date?",
        "Parker: I think that they're afraid that it might move on to something else, a little bit more.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Isn't that the whole point?",
        "Parker: Anyway, you'll give this to Johnny for me, right?",
        "Craig: I've got a better idea. Why don't you give it to him yourself?",
        "Parker: Really?",
        "Craig: Yeah. I'm on my way to the hospital. Why don't you come alone? I know he'd be thrilled.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: Wow, Johnny. That is great.",
        "Dusty: Hey!",
        "Josie: Hey, no, no, no, no. Don't look!",
        "Dusty: At what?",
        "Josie: I brought Johnny some crayons and paper. Buy he's doing a picture for you. And it's kind of a surprise.",
        "Dusty: Okay, I've got a surprise, too. Hey, Johnny? You want to go home today?",
        "Josie: The doctor said its okay?",
        "Dusty: The doctor says it's more than okay. Come on, we're going home! Let's do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Lily: I'm just going to get this out, okay?",
        "Carly: Get what out?",
        "Lily: My explanation.",
        "Carly: Explanation for what?",
        "Lily: Well, for saying \"No\" when Holden asked me about lending you money.",
        "Carly: No, no. You know what, Lily? You don't have to explain that to me. You really don't.",
        "Lily: Well, I feel like I do. And I've spent all morning psyching myself up to do it.",
        "Carly: Well, I wouldn't want you to waste that. Come on in. Would you like some coffee or something?",
        "Lily: No, no. Can we just do this?",
        "Carly: We can do it. But first, let me say what I want to say, before you say what you want to say, okay?",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Carly: I realize that it was ridiculously inappropriate for me to ask Holden for a loan. And the only reason I did it was that I was desperate, and I felt like I had nowhere else to turn. And that's it. That's what I wanted to say. So go ahead.",
        "Lily: That's all of it.",
        "Carly: That's it.",
        "Lily: Yeah, you -- you covered everything.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, apology accepted then.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Lily: I'm glad that's over.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Look, I'm sorry that I put you in that position. And I do understand why you said \"No.\"",
        "Lily: I still feel terrible.",
        "Carly: You shouldn't.",
        "Lily: Good. I was going to ask if I could take you out to lunch to make up for it.",
        "Carly: I'd like that.",
        "Lily: Great.",
        "Carly: Just one thing, though. It'll have to be a really expensive lunch.",
        "Lily: Ooh, that's going to do some damage, girl!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Home sweet home, Johnny boy. At least for now. You like that? Hmm? You want me to ask the kid who owns it if you can play with it? Okay. How do you like your new train set, Johnny boy? Huh?",
        "Josie: Go ahead, it's yours. I think it's a hit.",
        "Dusty: Thanks for helping me pick it out.",
        "Josie: You're welcome. Hey, Johnny. Do you want to say \"Thank you\" to your dad?",
        "Dusty: Oh, that's okay.",
        "Johnny: Thank you, Daddy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, Parker, I can't thank you enough. It'll be great for Johnny to have an older guy like you to look up to.",
        "Parker: Yeah, whatever I can do.",
        "Craig: Where is he? Excuse me. The little boy who was in that room -- where is he?",
        "Nurse: He was discharged.",
        "Craig: When?",
        "Nurse: Today. His father took him home.",
        "Craig: But I'm -- thank you.",
        "Parker: I thought you were his father.",
        "Craig: I thought so, too. Apparently, Dusty has different ideas.",
        "Parker: Can he do that? I mean, just take him?",
        "Craig: The hospital seems to think so. That's okay. We'll go over there right now, and we'll straighten it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Emma, I'm going to be here all day. I've got the day off. So I will be here when the delivery comes, no problem. No, I have not rearranged anything. Thank you. Listen, I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye-bye. Hey. Where were we?",
        "Liberty: I was actually just leaving, so -- I'll see you.",
        "Janet: Ah-ah-ah -- not until you tell me what I want to know.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Why don't we just fast-forward to the part where you forgive me for whatever it is you think I did wrong?",
        "Janet: I want to know why you showed up at Al's with your shirt buttoned wrong and that guilty smile on your face.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I actually -- I had too many doughnuts that day.",
        "Janet: Really, with your shirt off?",
        "Liberty: It was really tight, so --",
        "Janet: Are we really going to play this game?",
        "Liberty: No, Mom. Okay? No, because you obviously already know whatever it is that you want me to say. So, why don't you just tell me, because you know everything!",
        "Janet: Okay, the drama queen thing's not gonna work with me, either.",
        "Liberty: Fine! I was with Parker, okay? And before you start grilling me, we were mostly just sitting and talking.",
        "Janet: With your shirt off?",
        "Liberty: It wasn't off!",
        "Janet: Liberty. I thought that you and Parker had this worked out.",
        "Liberty: We did, Mom.",
        "Janet: Now that you guys are brother and sister --",
        "Liberty: We're not brother and sister!",
        "Janet: Liberty, what's going on?",
        "Liberty: Nothing, Mom. We haven't even done anything yet.",
        "Janet: What? Why was your shirt unbuttoned? And what do you mean by \"Yet\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I don't think he has a fever. What's so amusing?",
        "Josie: Nothing. I just never thought you would be such a mother hen.",
        "Dusty: You should see me change a diaper.",
        "Josie: I think that's an experience I can live without.",
        "Dusty: I can't believe he's here. He was so sick, you know?",
        "Josie: Well, he's doing much better. Otherwise, the doctors would never have let him come home.",
        "Dusty: He's definitely on his way. I want to give him the life he missed while he was away, you know?",
        "Josie: Yeah, I know. But go slow. He's overwhelmed. He had surgery, he's got two fathers fighting over him, and the one person who was a constant is gone.",
        "Dusty: Too bad Lucy couldn't stick around.",
        "Josie: Well, I'm sure that nobody misses her more than Johnny.",
        "Dusty: She could come back if Craig drops his charges against her. Hey buddy, you want to take a rest and lie down for a while?",
        "Josie: Yeah. You can't give him a present and then ask him not to play with it.",
        "Dusty: I guess not. Hey, that prescription should be ready by now.",
        "Josie: Oh, I'll go.",
        "Dusty: No, no. He's more comfortable with you here. If you don't mind staying?",
        "Josie: No, I'd love to.",
        "Dusty: Hey. I'll be gone for a little while, okay? Josie's going to be here with you the whole time. All right? Maybe they deliver?",
        "Josie: They're right across the street.",
        "Dusty: Call my cell if you need me.",
        "Josie: You'll be ten minutes. What could possibly happen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So just when I find out that I need all that money, or I'm gonna lose Metro, Jack tells me that he wants a second mortgage, so he can put a down payment on a new house.",
        "Lily: Huh. Your business versus his married bliss.",
        "Car: Exactly. Far be it from me to interfere his cozy new life.",
        "Lily: At least you're not bitter.",
        "Carly: Not a bit. You think it's too early for Cosmos?",
        "Lily: Ooh. Probably.",
        "Carly: It's hard to drown my sorrow in a cup of green tea.",
        "Lily: Maybe I was wrong.",
        "Carly: Wrong about what?",
        "Lily: The loan. I didn't realize how important it was to you.",
        "Carly: No, no. You weren't wrong.",
        "Lily: Look. Maybe there's some creative way we can structure it.",
        "Carly: Lily, just stop, okay?",
        "Lily: Well, I'd hate to see you lose Metro.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to. I got the money.",
        "Lily: You found a bank willing to lend you money? That's not easy these days.",
        "Carly: No, it's not coming from a bank.",
        "Lily: Then where?",
        "Carly: A private source. Sort of a venture capitalist.",
        "Lily: Really? Anyone I know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Are you sure I should be here?",
        "Craig: Definitely. I want you to give Johnny that train.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but I could do that another time.",
        "Craig: No, we should do it now. It'll be a good distraction for him.",
        "Parker: In case Dusty freaks?",
        "Craig: Well, we'll hope for the best.",
        "Josie: Well, that was fast. What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Looking for Johnny. And there's my boy!",
        "Johnny: Want to see my new trains?",
        "Craig: I sure would. And I bet your Uncle Parker would, too. You remember Parker, don't you?",
        "Josie: You shouldn't be here.",
        "Parker: Let me see what you got there, Johnny. Very cool.",
        "Craig: I wanted to make sure that he was all right. He disappeared from the hospital.",
        "Josie: He was discharged.",
        "Craig: Well, that was nice of Dusty to tell me.",
        "Josie: Okay, you need to leave.",
        "Craig: Sure. Johnny, how would you like to go for ice cream?",
        "Josie: You cannot take him out of here!",
        "Craig: He's my son!",
        "Josie: I can't just let you take him!",
        "Craig: All right. I understand that you're caught in the middle. And frankly, I don't blame you. But we're just going for some ice cream, okay?",
        "Josie: Okay, I'm going to call Dusty. What are you doing?",
        "Craig: I'm giving you my cell number.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: Let Dusty know he's welcome to join us. And you are, too.",
        "Josie: But you shouldn't be doing this. For Johnny's sake.",
        "Craig: I will decide what's right for my son. Now, Dusty and I promised Lucy that we'd do this peacefully. So I am peacefully going to take him for ice cream, and I will peacefully bring him back. You ready to go, Johnny? You know, Parker has a gift for you. Come on, let's go. Let's get some ice cream! Come on! What's your favorite flavor? Cookie dough? Oh, that's good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Hello?",
        "Josie: Craig was here! He took Johnny!",
        "Dusty: You let him?",
        "Josie: I couldn't stop him! He said he was taking him to get some ice cream, but that he'd be right back.",
        "Dusty: I'm on my way!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Jack: Oakdale P.D.",
        "Dusty: Jack, it's Dusty. Craig kidnapped Johnny.",
        "Jack: When?",
        "Dusty: A few minutes ago, from the Lakeview. He couldn't have gotten far. You've got to find him.",
        "Jack: I'm on it.",
        "Dusty: And when you find him, lock him up!",
        "Jack: It'll be my pleasure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Craig? You were going to borrow money from Craig Montgomery? Are you crazy?",
        "Carly: All right. You know, Jack thinks exactly the same way.",
        "Lily: Well, he's right! Do you remember how I got burned when I went into business with that man?",
        "Carly: Yeah, but I think things are different now. I think that Craig has changed.",
        "Lily: Carly!",
        "Carly: Only to the extent that he loaned me the money with no strings attached.",
        "Lily: And I've got a bridge to nowhere I'd like to sell you.",
        "Carly: Come on, Lily, I'm not an idiot. I know who Craig is. But if I don't take his money, I am going to lose Metro. And the fact is, other than my kids when they're talking to me, Metro's all I got.",
        "Lily: I understand. And I really shouldn't be the one to give you advice.",
        "Carly: No, that's not what I meant.",
        "Lily: Maybe you're right. Maybe Craig has changed.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Lily: Oh, and here he comes now.",
        "Carly: What is Parker doing with him?",
        "Craig: Well, if it isn't the two most beautiful women in Oakdale!",
        "Lily: Hello, Craig.",
        "Parker: Hi, Mom.",
        "Carly: Hi, Parker. I thought you were going to the library.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I'm on my way.",
        "Carly: Is this some kind of shortcut?",
        "Craig: Actually, Parker is helping me look after Johnny, who just got out of the hospital.",
        "Carly: Yay.",
        "Craig: Son, this is Carly. She knew you when you were a baby.",
        "Carly: Yes, I did. Hello. You're so big and handsome now.",
        "Lily: Yes, he is.",
        "Craig: Which is why we're here to celebrate. Would you like to join us?",
        "Lily: Where's Dusty?",
        "Craig: Taking a break from his parental responsibilities. Come on, Johnny. Let's get us a table.",
        "Carly: So, tell me, how did you end up at this little party, huh?",
        "Parker: It's no big deal, really.",
        "Carly: Do you think your father would agree?",
        "Parker: Look, I got Johnny a present, and Craig suggested that I give it to him in person.",
        "Carly: Why would you give Johnny a present?",
        "Parker: Because he's my nephew, remember?",
        "Carly: You don't even know him, Parker.",
        "Parker: Well, I've only known Liberty for a few months, but it sure seems to be a big deal that she's family.",
        "Carly: Hey. One thing has nothing to do with the other.",
        "Parker: Yeah, it never does.",
        "Carly: Parker, what is going on here, really?",
        "Parker: I told you.",
        "Craig: All right, I've got us a table and plenty of ice cream on the way. So what do you say we get this party started, huh? Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, you're not leaving here until you answer my question.",
        "Liberty: I'm not trying to keep secrets from you, Mom. But I really don't know how I feel about Parker right now, okay? Except for that I care about him.",
        "Janet: Care how?",
        "Liberty: Not like a brother, that's for sure. Definitely as a friend. And maybe more than a friend.",
        "Janet: I thought you and Parker had this settled.",
        "Liberty: You did, maybe. But I didn't. Mom, you guys made it so ugly, that I just had to put it away.",
        "Janet: I never said it was ugly. Just premature.",
        "Liberty: Whatever, okay? The point is that there were so many people going completely psycho about us, that it just made sense to back it off.",
        "Janet: In spite of your own feelings.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, basically.",
        "Janet: So where are you now?",
        "Liberty: I told you, I really don't know. And I know everybody else thinks that we're related, but we're not. And truthfully, he and I, we really don't care if it weirds people out.",
        "Janet: So, are you gonna go back to doing what you weren't ready to do in the first place?",
        "Liberty: No, Mom. Definitely did not say that, okay? I just -- I don't see what's so wrong with us going out.",
        "Janet: Okay. Well, truthfully, neither do I.",
        "Liberty: Really?",
        "Janet: Yeah. I always thought so.",
        "Liberty: Really? Well, Dad definitely didn't. And neither did Jack.",
        "Janet: Well, they still don't.",
        "Liberty: So, why are we having this conversation?",
        "Janet: Because I can change their minds. Your biggest problem is going to be Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: They just pushed right in and they took Johnny out!",
        "Jack: They?",
        "Josie: Craig had a teenage boy with him. He said that he was Johnny's uncle, but I can't remember his name.",

        "Josie: I tried to stop him. But he wouldn't listen to me! I'm so sorry.",

        "Jack: I've got a call into the station. We're using every available unit. Any idea where he went?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Josie: We could call him.",
        "Jack: How?",

        "Carly: Craig, that's not the point. And you know it.",
        "Craig: The point is, we all need to get reacquainted now that my son is back. You used to be close to him once, didn't you, Carly?",
        "Carly: Yes, and I'm very glad he's back.",

        "Craig: Oh, it's a legal issue. Well, legally speaking, aren't you legally dead? I'm not a lawyer or a policeman, but wouldn't that affect his custodial status?",
        "Jack: Yeah, you know, some judge is going to have a lot of fun untangling this mess. In the meantime, the two of you have to learn how to be civilized, for Johnny's sake.",
        "Dusty: That's it?",

        "Liberty: Yeah, so Parker and I are a no-go. Great.",
        "Janet: I wish. Unfortunately, anybody with eyes can see that you two are definitely going to go whether we like it or not. So, yeah -- and I don't want you sneaking around behind my back. So, I've got a plan.",

        "Craig: I told his girlfriend.",
        "Lily: Is she his girlfriend?",
        "Craig: Who knows, who cares? That's not the point. The point is, I was very clear. I said I was taking Johnny out for ice cream. And I went out of my way to leave a number where I could be reached.",
        "Lily: Not the same thing.",
        "Craig: I don't care. He's my son. Lily, how would you like it if someone told you, you had to ask permission to spend a few minutes with your children?",
        "Lily: I wouldn't.",
        "Craig: And neither do I. And I won't accept it. I'm his biological father.",

        "Dusty: What?",
        "Josie: Do you think that Johnny doesn't pick up on all this anger and negativity and hate? Why do you think he was so upset before?",

        "Josie: Craig's not the only one.",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to protect my son.",
        "Josie: You're protecting him from someone who bought him ice cream, which he ended up being too upset to eat.",
        "Dusty: You're blaming me?",
        "Josie: No. You promised Lucy that you wouldn't let this happen.",
        "Dusty: It's not my fault!",
        "Josie: Maybe not. But right now, Craig is looking like the reasonable one, and you keep losing your cool.",
        "Dusty: You'd see it differently if you went through what I went through with this guy.",
        "Josie: I didn't. And neither did anyone else, not the people who are going to decide what happens to Johnny. But if you'd rather enjoy your self- righteousness than keep your son, that's your choice.",

        "Lily: But look at yourself, Craig. You live alone. In a hotel room. The only thing you have to offer Johnny is a string of busted marriages and a police record.",
        "Craig: Good point. But aside from the busted marriages, you've just described Dusty, too.",
        "Lily: Yeah, that's true. Poor Johnny.",

        "Jack: Then you don't need to see each other at all!",
        "Janet: You're wrong, Jack. Listen. We all overreacted last time, and we shouldn't have. The truth is, these kids are smart, they are responsible, they're good students --",
        "Liberty: Okay, don't oversell it, Mom.",

        "Jack: I'm with Parker. What's gotten into you?",
        "Carly: Well, it's no good, them sneaking around. It's much better if things are out in the open. As long as they follow the rules.",

        "Jack: That's it?",
        "Carly: Jack, there are a lot worse situations for families to be in. Think about what's happening with Craig and Dusty. You know what, if this is the worst thing that happens to us, then I'd say we're pretty lucky.",
