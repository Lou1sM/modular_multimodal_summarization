        "Aaron: Not when the candy striper's Alison Stewart. Come on. Ask \r\naround. See what you can get.",

        "Realtor: I'm sure we can work something out.",
        "Barbara: Sorry you've wasted your time, Craig. I think you know the way \r\nout.",
        "Realtor: Mr. Montgomery's offered a significant percentage above the \r\nasking price. And since he's getting remarried --",
        "Craig: Actually, that's just a vague possibility at the moment.",
        "Realtor: But you were just telling me --",
        "Craig: It's just an idea I'm tossing around.",
        "Barbara: Would you give us a moment alone, please?",
        "Realtor: Of course.",
        "Craig: What, you want to negotiate? Name your price.",
        "Barbara: Only if you name the woman who's agreed to be the next Mrs. \r\nMontgomery. So tell me, Craig, who's the bride-to-be?",

        "Carly: Please tell me you're alone.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I am. But don't rub it in. What's -- come in. What's the \r\nmatter?",
        "Carly: Ah. I just told Jack that I'm pregnant.",
        "Emily: How much did you tell him?",
        "Carly: Well, I left out the part about the baby probably being the \r\nresult of a one-night stand I had with my cousin's boyfriend.",
        "Emily: Good, good, good. That's exactly what I would have done. So, how \r\nis our proud papa?",
        "Carly: Oh, please don't make me feel any worse than I already do. \r\nSomehow, I managed to convince him to keep the baby a secret for now. But you \r\nshould have seen his face when I told him. He's not gonna be able to be quiet \r\nfor long. And that's when my problems really start. Because then -- then I'll \r\nhave to deal with Mike.",

        "Jack: No. No, it's for my wife. She's the one who needs the pampering \r\nfrom head to toe.[Pounding at door] No. No, she's really not into the whole spa experience, \r\nbut -- yeah, come on in. But I heard you guys have masseuses come to the house? \r\nRight. No, that sounds great. Yeah. Well, I want to make this really special for \r\nher, because she's -- you know what? Let me check on a few things, and I'll get \r\nback to you. All right? No, thanks for everything. Bye. Carly's running errands. \r\nBut if I can help you out with anything -- Mike? Come on, dude. I know you're in \r\nlove, but there's a whole world out here. You know what I'm saying? Hello? Mike?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Yeah, I was just checking out your reading material here.",
        "Jack: You weren't supposed to see this, dude.",
        "Mike: \"Dad's guide to the pregnant wife\"?",
        "Jack: If you tell Carly you saw this, she'll brain me. So I'm gonna \r\nhave to swear you to secrecy. Nobody knows about this. It's supposed to stay \r\nthat way.",
        "Mike: So it's true?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Man, we're having a baby -- my baby and me.",

        "Mike: Yeah, Molly thought something was going on.",
        "Jack: Was I that obvious? I've had this stupid grin on my face ever \r\nsince she told me. No matter what I do -- there it is.",
        "Mike: When's the -- when's the little one due?",
        "Jack: I don't know. Her first ob appointment, she had to leave early. \r\nSo we're not gonna get the complete lowdown until her next appointment. You \r\nknow, the sonogram, the whole nine. I can't wait to hear the baby's heartbeat.",
        "Mike: You seem really psyched, Jack.",
        "Jack: I have never been this happy in my entire life. I mean, talk \r\nabout a miracle. One minute, my heart's just about ripped out of me because I \r\ngotta give J. J. back. The next minute, I've got this whole new life to look \r\nforward to. It's taken all the strength I have not to run out of here and tell \r\nthe whole world. You know what I'm saying?",
        "Mike: Carly wants to keep it a secret now?",
        "Jack: For the time being. For the -- so you'll keep this under your hat \r\ntill we go public?",

        "Emily: What's Mike gonna do, anyway? You tell him the baby's Jack's, \r\nthe baby's Jack's. It's not like he's gonna dispute it.",
        "Carly: Yet. He knows that we didn't use any protection, Emily. He was \r\nthere. And he knows how to count just as well as Rosanna. So when he finds out \r\nthe baby's due date, he's gonna start to wonder.",
        "Emily: Okay, can't you fudge the due date?",
        "Carly: And then what happens in May when I give birth to a nine-pound \r\npreemie?",
        "Emily: Rosanna rips out your heart with her bare hands.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Emily: All right. Look -- you didn't come here for tea and sympathy. \r\nRight? And you're in no condition for tequila. You came here because I can keep \r\nmy eyes on the big picture. So here's my take on things. You can handle Mike. \r\nHe's a lamb, right? Rosanna, the she-wolf -- she's the one you gotta be worried \r\nabout.",
        "Carly: Mm. And Craig thought he was saving the day when he took the \r\nblame for being my mystery man. He would take the heat. Rosanna would be upset, \r\nbut she'd get over it.",
        "Emily: Until she whips out her calendar and does a little math.",

        "Emily: Oh, boy. Problems don't get much worse than this, do they?",
        "Carly: They do if you're me. Rosanna asked Craig to marry her. And I \r\nthink I convinced him to accept.",

        "Barbara: So you're engaged. What poor, unfortunate woman have you \r\nentrapped now, Craig?",
        "Craig: I'm not actually engaged. I was posing a hypothetical question \r\nto a realtor.",
        "Barbara: Ah? Is it Rosanna Cabot? No, no, no. She's far too bright to \r\nmake that mistake. It's Rosanna, isn't it? Unbelievable. Not enough that she \r\nhands you B.R.O. on a platter. Now she has to bankroll your new home?",
        "Craig: Actually, no. I am buying this house for my daughter.",
        "Barbara: Ah, they finally threw you out of the Lakeview.",
        "Craig: No. Lucy was injured in an accident, and she needs a home space \r\nto recover.",
        "Barbara: But why this home? Because it's mine. That's why.",
        "Craig: No. This is one of the few places in Oakdale with enough space, \r\nsecurity and privacy. Walls to keep out the riffraff.",
        "Realtor: Ms. Ryan?",
        "Barbara: You're still here?",
        "Realtor: I was halfway to my car when I realized I hadn't shown Mr. \r\nMontgomery the charming cottage out back, or the gazebo, not to mention the \r\ngarden.",
        "Barbara: Get it through your head, missy! I am not selling to him!",
        "Craig: You better consider the offer.",
        "Barbara: I don't need your money, Craig.",
        "Craig: Of course you don't. What you need is absolution. And not even \r\nyour family can provide that. Wonder what Paul will think when he finds out \r\nyou've turned down an overly generous offer.",
        "Barbara: My son will understand.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Yeah, and he will think your heart still clings to James \r\nSteinbeck. You're not gonna get too many more offers on this mausoleum. You \r\nbetter think twice before turning mine down.",

        "Aaron: So -- is anybody saying when you might get released?",
        "Lucy: They're keeping that kind of information to themselves. Probably \r\nafraid they'd tell me, and I'd just forget. Could you take me back to my room \r\nnow, please?",

        "Aaron: No. No, you go ahead. Look, her dad's not around, and she knows \r\nI'm out here. And when I told her I'd see her soon, she said, \"okay.\" So maybe \r\n--",
        "Alison: Maybe she'll want to talk about the weather. Ask about the \r\nnews.",
        "Aaron: Ali, at least we'll be communicating. At least I'll be able to \r\nspend some time with her. Go ahead. Go eat. I'm just gonna -- I'm just gonna \r\nhang here. Okay?",
        "Alison: Aaron -- you want Lucy to remember you? Let her remember the \r\nyou she likes. She didn't start liking you because you ran after her like some \r\nsick puppy dog. She liked you because you were cool. So be cool. Be intense, \r\nquiet. Wait for her to make the first move.",
        "Aaron: Well, I could just stick my head in the door --",
        "Alison: She said \"hi,\" Aaron. Not, \"come on up and see me sometime.\" \r\nNot, \"come in and stare at me and make me all nervous like some crazy stalker.\" \r\nAnd if you do, you know Craig's gonna come in, 'cause that's what he does. And \r\nthen he's gonna start accusing you of terrorizing his little angel. But go for \r\nit. If you wanna risk it all, go for it. I'm not standing in your way.",

        "Barbara: I got an offer.",

        "Craig: I was gone, out to see the gazebo, gardens, et cetera.",
        "Barbara: Now do you understand?",
        "Paul: What's the game this time, Montgomery?",
        "Craig: I promised her mother I would buy our daughter a home. Real home \r\n-- space, security, privacy. Fairwinds affords us that, and we can afford \r\nFairwinds.",
        "Barbara: Thanks to Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Craig: Lucy had an accident. She's in a wheelchair. We need room for \r\nphysical therapist equipment.",

        "Craig: Well, her doctors say that, with time, exercise --",
        "Barbara: I'm very sorry about Lucy. No sale. Not to him.",
        "Paul: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Mom, you've wanted to sell this house for \r\nages, right? Why does it matter who's buying it?",
        "Barbara: You know -- I was thinking that maybe you'd want to keep it. \r\nKeep it in the family. It would be my wedding gift to you and Rose.",
        "",
        "Emily: Craig and Rosanna are already a match made in hell, Carly. Did \r\nthey really need your help?",
        "Carly: It made sense at the time.",
        "Emily: Yeah, if you've got some sort of death wish. Why didn't you just \r\ntell him to dump her? And then she'd be out of his life, and you'd no longer be \r\nthe competition.",
        "Carly: I -- don't know what to do anymore, all right, Emily? Craig came \r\nto me. And I just wanted him to be happy. The same way I want Mike and Molly to \r\nbe happy. Most of all, I want Jack to be happy. He is my life.",
        "Emily: I know, honey.",
        "Carly: That night with Mike was -- it was stupid. But it was not \r\ncheating. Not really. There was nobody to cheat on. I thought that Jack was \r\ngone. I thought I'd lost him forever. How was I supposed to know that we would \r\nactually get married and start a life together?",
        "Emily: You couldn't have known.",
        "Carly: And now that we have that life, I'd like to keep it! Thank you \r\nvery much. I'd like to be his wife. I'd like to have his babies.",
        "Emily: Okay, I know I've said this before, but isn't there a small \r\nchance that this could be Jack's baby? It's just a small chance?",
        "Carly: It's not likely. One mistake. One lapse in judgment. And if I \r\nmake one wrong move, then I hurt Mike and Molly and Jack and Craig. What do I \r\ndo?",
        "[Emily sighs]",
        "Emily: All right. I have one more idea. It's pretty radical.",

        "Emily: Go to Rosanna.",
        "Carly: No way! You are nuts! She hates me!",
        "Emily: Do you want her to find out that you're pregnant on her own? \r\nHmm? Think about it. She'll think that you've got something to hide, and she \r\nwill go straight to \"maybe it's Craig's\" without missing a beat. But if you go \r\nto her --",

        "Emily: -- And tell her straight out --",

        "Emily: A hysterectomy? She had a -- wow. Wow, I mean, you never think \r\nof Rosanna having a heart, much less other human organs. I wouldn't wish that on \r\nmy worst enemy. That's awful.",

        "Emily: Ask her to be the godmother.",
        "Carly: Um --",
        "[Carly laughs] Emily, while I appreciate and often bow to your conniving, \r\ndiabolical mastermind, do you realize that you're suggesting that I invite \r\nRosanna into my life for, like, ever? That I invite her into my family. She'll \r\nshow up at family functions, at recitals, at school plays.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but, you know, I'll bet you she'll be a great gift giver. \r\nSeriously, she will make it her moral duty to protect this child. This can't \r\nfail, Carly.",
        "Carly: It is brilliant. But it's too creepy! I can do a lot of things, \r\nbut I can't do that.",

        "Emily: Are you sure Mike knows about the baby?",
        "Carly: Beyond a shadow of a doubt.",
        "Emily: Okay. Shadow of a doubt. He can't know for sure unless you \r\nactually say something. I mean, he might suspect something, but -- just don't \r\nsay anything to him, all right? And remember what I told you about Rosanna.",

        "Emily: No. No, no, no. Will was absolutely fine until he was snatched \r\nout of his house, away from his father, his friends, everyone he knows and \r\nloves. The only one who ought to be afraid of what that doctor might say isn't \r\nyou, Hal. It's Barbara.",

        "Paul: What's Hal want? A place for Will that's not Fairwinds, where he \r\ncan have his own room? Is that it? Well, that's easy enough. You just find \r\nsomething near Hal's place, near the school, near Will's friends. And then \r\neverybody will be happy.",
