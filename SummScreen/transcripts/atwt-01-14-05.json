        "Nurse: Blood pressure 160 over 90 and rising, doctor.",
        "Ben: What's the status on that O.R.?",
        "Nurse: They said another five minutes.",
        "Ben: We'll lose him in another five minutes. We've got to get him moving now. Let's go.",
        "Alison: One minute, Aaron's over the moon because he's getting so much good news about his arm, and then the next, he's on the floor. I don't get it, he was supposed to be getting better. Aaron? Aaron? Where are you taking him?",
        "Ben: To the O.R. keep an eye on that drip.",
        "Alison: You're operating on him now?",
        "Ben: Look, Alison, I don't have time for this now.",
        "Alison: Aaron, can you hear me?",
        "Ben: Come on, let's go.",
        "Alison: I love you.",
        "Jessica: Alison --",
        "Alison: He's going to be okay, right? Please tell me they can save him.",

        "Carly: Well, this little baby always led me back to Jack, and now it's going to work its magic on Julia.",
        "Lily: It'll point her in the right direction?",
        "Carly: Yep -- away from your husband, away from mine.",
        "Lily: Look at you. Don't you -- you really feel good about what we did?",
        "Carly: I feel great. So should you.",
        "Lily: Yeah, well, we did set up an innocent person.",
        "Carly: No, Julia is anything but innocent.",
        "Lily: Yeah, you're right, but she didn't steal the compass, and we did do something really bad. We -- we lied to Emma. Emma Snyder.",
        "Carly: Oh -- well, it was for the greater good. There's no way that Julia is going to continue to live at the farm now. And that's one less distraction for Holden.",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Carly: Lily, look at me, listen to me -- if we play our cards right, Julia's next step could be onto a nice comfy cross-country bus.",
        "Lily: Where do you think she went when she ran off?",
        "Carly: I don't know and I don't care. Anywhere is better than where she was.",

        "[Julia sighs]",
        "Holden: Hey, what's the matter?",
        "Julia: I'm sorry, I didn't know where to go. I didn't know what to do.",
        "Holden: Well, that's okay. You came to the right place. You want to tell me what's wrong?",
        "Jack: The boys are finally sacked up. What's wrong?",
        "Holden: Well, that's what I'm trying to find out. Julia, I can't help you unless you tell me why you're so upset.",
        "Julia: Emma thinks I'm a thief. And probably a psycho lunatic, too. She thinks I'm obsessed with Jack, and that I would just do, you know, anything --",
        "Holden: Why on earth would she think that?",
        "Julia: Your wife set me up, and so did yours.",

        "Sierra: Black and whites?",
        "Craig: No syrup. They're still your favorite?",
        "Sierra: Wow. It's been a long time since you sprang for milkshakes. What have you done now?",
        "Craig: Well, I talked to Lucy today. Actually, she did most of the talking. I listened.",
        "Sierra: You listened?",
        "Craig: I can, you know. You used to tell me I was a very good listener.",
        "Sierra: Well, I was in love then. I would have said anything.",
        "Craig: And you did. In any case, Lucy confided in me about how upset she was about what happened with her and Rafael when they were trapped together.",
        "Sierra: She's too hard on herself. She shouldn't feel guilty for anything she needed to do to hang on and stay sane.",
        "Craig: Well, I know that and you know that. But Lucy feels like she betrayed dusty.",
        "Sierra: She actually talked to you about this?",
        "Craig: Yes. Yes, I'm sure she would have preferred her mother, but I was there, she needed support.",
        "Sierra: So, what did you tell her?",
        "Craig: I pretended I was you. I told her to follow her heart. But she's -- she's holding onto a heavy secret. So, I gave her a piece of advice from my own experience, that secrets have a way of coming out -- especially if you try to hold onto them hard.",
        "Sierra: What do you think she's going to do?",
        "Craig: I think she's going to tell Dusty Donovan the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You know? About Rafael and me?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: How? How could you know? Raf -- did my father tell you?",
        "Dusty: Nobody had to tell me. I know you. I look at you and I know.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you, but I -- I didn't know how. It just happened and then you showed up, and we -- I couldn't tell you. I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, so am I.",
        "Lucy: You must hate me.",
        "Dusty: Hate you? You haven't been listening to me. I love you.",
        "Lucy: You're not mad?",
        "Dusty: You have no idea what I want to do to this guy. I'm trying to be fair. I mean, it's not like you cheated on me, I guess.",
        "Lucy: I was so scared.",
        "Dusty: Of what? Of me?",
        "Lucy: I was scared I'd blown it, that I would never have a chance to be with you again.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. I understand. You thought you were gonna die, and at times like that, people turn to each out of -- a need to feel safe. But you and I love each other. That's a lot bigger than something that happens out of desperation.",
        "Lucy: Then I guess it's my turn to be fair.",
        "Dusty: What do you mean?",
        "Lucy: I mean, what I did with Rafael -- it wasn't just because I was desperate. There was much more to it than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Lily, if you don't relax, you're going to give yourself an ulcer.",
        "Lily: Okay, tell me again how I justify what we did.",
        "Carly: You just tell yourself that you were saving your family, which is the truth. And if you have to stoop to Julia's level to do it, then so be it. Do you think that she lost any sleep over stealing my husband? Over trying to steal yours? Just keep your eyes on the prize. When Holden gets back from this trip, he's not going to be under the same roof with that witch anymore, and you can concentrate on getting your marriage back on track.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Carly: Trust me, you're going to feel a lot better once he's back in your bed.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm, I hope you're right.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I am so right.",
        "Lily: Thank you. Okay, I'll call you.",
        "Carly: Okay. And you are so out of your league, Julia Larrabee. Bye-bye.",

        "Lily: Hello?",
        "Alison: Lily?",
        "Lily: Yes?",
        "Alison: It's me, Alison. I'm so glad that you answered your phone.",
        "Lily: Are you -- did something happen?",
        "Alison: It's Aaron -- he collapsed. I don't know what's wrong with him.",
        "Lily: Where are you?",
        "Alison: I'm at the hospital. Ben just took him upstairs. They're going to operate on him again.",
        "Lily: I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Did you put your purse in a place they could have access to it?",
        "Julia: I don't know, I mean I must have. The only thing that I remember is that I was going to go upstairs, and Carly grabbed my arm and yanked my purse out of my hands and it went -- all my stuff scattered on the floor, and there was the compass. I swear to God I never touched it. You don't believe me, do you?",
        "Holden: This is getting out of control.",
        "Julia: I really thought this was over, even after Lily tried to bribe me to leave town, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. This is just --",
        "Holden: This is not like Lily, and I don't know what has gotten into her.",
        "Jack: Oh, I think I do. I need to talk to Carly, and I don't think it could wait. And I hate disappointing J.J., I mean, I don't want to wake him up or anything --",
        "Holden: You go do what you have to do, I'll stay with the boys tonight.",
        "Jack: Thank you. I'm sorry.",
        "Julia: I should go, too.",
        "Holden: To where?",
        "Julia: Um, I guess I'll just sleep in the on-call room at the hospital?",
        "Holden: That's ridiculous.",
        "Julia: No, it's not. I do it all the time, it's not a big deal.",
        "Holden: I don't want you driving these roads at night. This area, it's kind of tricky.",
        "Julia: I got up here, didn't I?",
        "Holden: You need to humor me, okay? I mean, there's plenty of room here. You can just stay with us.",
        "Julia: I don't want to put you out any more than I already have.",
        "Holden: Okay, then do it for J.J., because he's going to be pretty bummed out to wake up and find Jack gone.",
        "Julia: My poor baby. No matter how many times it happens, he still gets very disappointed, so, okay. Maybe I should -- stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: You didn't come right out and tell Lucy that you knew that Lucy had slept with Rafael, did you?",
        "Craig: No, I took a radically different approach. I went out of my way not to pry.",
        "Sierra: Well, that's not only different for you, it's revolutionary.",
        "Craig: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There was a part of me that wanted to scream, \"bye-bye, Dusty.\" But I stopped myself.",
        "Sierra: Why?",
        "Craig: Well, because her heart was more important than my wish list, you know, and the more I listened, the more she relaxed and began to trust me.",
        "Sierra: It must have felt great.",
        "Craig: Well, actually, it felt awkward as all heck, you know? Not very good at not being the one in control.",
        "Sierra: Poor Craig, all dressed up and no one to manage.",
        "Craig: I'd wrap her in bubble wrap if I could.",
        "Sierra: Well, I'm glad you thought better of that.",
        "Craig: Well, I had a realization that there was something else I could give her.",
        "Sierra: What's that?",
        "Craig: My trust. I've been so worried about her trusting me that I forgot that I didn't trust her as the smart, grownup woman she's become.",
        "Sierra: Wow. I'm proud of you.",
        "Craig: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: If you knew me as well as you say, you'd know that I don't just jump into bed with people. Making love means something to me.",
        "Dusty: I know. I know that.",
        "Lucy: And he kept me alive. He never left me, not once, even when I was scared out of my mind and completely hopeless. He never let me down.",
        "Dusty: Like I did, you mean. I know you don't take being with someone lightly. I know you and Rafael obviously have something special going on. I saw it when the kid first came to town. You guys grew up together. I mean, that's special right there. I'm not putting it down, I'm just saying, it's over now, right? You can forget about it and move on.",
        "Lucy: No, but see, that's just it. What happened between Rafael and me, I can't just forget about it. It's too important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I got here as fast as I could. Is he still in surgery?",
        "Alison: Yes, and nobody's telling us anything. I don't understand. That means that something's bad, right?",
        "Lily: What happened exactly?",
        "Jessica: Aaron's latest test results showed a rapidly growing blood clot on his brain.",
        "Alison: That's why he fell.",
        "Jessica: We just have to pray that Ben can get to it in time, before it bursts.",
        "Lily: Oh. Holden -- how am I gonna get in touch with Holden?",
        "Alison: I left a message at your house.",
        "Lily: He's not there. He's --",
        "Alison: Well, where is he?",
        "Lily: He's -- he's on a camping trip with Luke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Um, coffee -- you want coffee, tea?",
        "Julia: With the day I've had, that beer looks pretty good.",
        "Holden: I know what you mean.",
        "Julia: So one good thing came out of today.",
        "Holden: What's that?",
        "Julia: You believed me.",
        "Holden: And why wouldn't I?",
        "Julia: Oh, I guess you haven't heard. I am the wicked witch of the west. I've come to destroy families.",
        "Holden: All you did was fall in love. You followed Jack to a new town in search of a new life. That wasn't wicked. You just did what you believed in.",
        "Julia: You're being awfully nice to me.",
        "Holden: I'm just treating you the way you treated me. Do you remember at the hospital, when I didn't think that my son was gonna make it?",
        "Julia: Yeah.",
        "Holden: You sat with me. You didn't know me. And I bet that if I asked you to stay all night with me, you would have, and that I will never forget.",
        "Julia: I don't even know where J.J. and I would be if it wasn't for you, Holden. But I don't want to be a problem. I don't want to cause you any problems, so as soon as I get back into town, I'm gonna look for another place for J.J. and me to live.",
        "Holden: That's not necessary.",
        "Julia: It is. I think Emma's put up with me --",
        "Holden: No, I will talk to my mother, and we'll get everything straightened out.",
        "Julia: No, I'd rather find a place. I don't want to cause any more problems for you.",
        "Holden: You haven't caused any. You've been unlucky. You got caught up in the middle, but you didn't cause them.",
        "Julia: You know, when I first came here, you didn't feel that way. You thought of me as the evil home wrecker who was trying to take Jack away from Carly, and --",
        "Holden: I was just trying to protect my cousin. But when Aaron was in the hospital, I got to see another side of the picture, and the more I got to know you --",
        "Julia: What? Tell me. What?",
        "Holden: The more I got to know you, the more I understood why Jack fell in love with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, oh! Jack? Oh, you scared me half to death. What are you doing back here?",
        "Jack: What happened at Emma's?",
        "Carly: Oh, I don't -- Emma's, what do you mean?",
        "Jack: Save it, Carly. I want to know what happened, and I want to hear it from you, now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jack: I have been doing everything to work things out with her for J.J.'s sake. And now, who knows what she's gonna do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: What are we gonna do about Holden? Aaron would want him here.",
        "Lily: I know. I'll keep trying to get in touch with him, because I know Holden would never forgive himself if something --",
        "Alison: If what? What, you don't think Aaron's gonna make it?",
        "Lily: No, Aaron's gonna be fine. I'm -- I'm just saying that Holden would want to be here.",
        "Jessica: Listen, I'm afraid I have to leave. One of my biggest clients -- well, actually, his son got himself arrested, so I have to head down to the station.",
        "Lily: That's okay. We'll be fine. You can go.",
        "Jessica: I wish I could stay, but um, I'll keep praying for Aaron, and I'll get back here as soon as I can. Would you please tell Ben?",
        "Lily: Absolutely, I'll tell him.",
        "Jessica: Thank you, thank you.",
        "Alison: Shouldn't we have heard something by now?",
        "Lily: It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It has to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I'm sorry for what Lily put you through.",
        "Julia: It's not your fault.",
        "Holden: We are in a difficult place. I brought you to my mother's, and without meaning to, I've put you right in the middle.",
        "Julia: Listen, I understand where Lily's coming from.",
        "Holden: Really? I've been trying to figure that one out for months.",
        "Julia: Hey, she's just afraid of losing you.",
        "Holden: We're all afraid of losing the people that we love. I've been there, countless times. What she did to you, framing you like she did? No excuse.",
        "Julia: If you were mine, I would have done the same thing.",
        "Holden: Bribery? Somehow, I don't think so.",
        "Julia: I'm just saying that Lily sees me as contributing to the problems between the two of you.",
        "Holden: She's blaming what's happening between us on everything except what's actually going on between me and her.",
        "Julia: Which is?",
        "Holden: Not a hell of a lot. Which is pretty sad, considering that we were close enough to be able to read each other's minds. I would start a sentence --",
        "Julia: -- She would finish it. I remember that.",
        "Holden: I can't remember the last time that we talked like you and I are talking now, much less -- well, what happened tonight just hammers it all home.",
        "Julia: You love her?",
        "Holden: The Lily that I loved would not have done what she did to you.",
        "Julia: It's sad, but a fact of life. People change, and they grow apart.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I guess I just never knew how far.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you know the trouble I had to go through to go on this camping trip with J.J.?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Jack. Yes, I do. I was there. I suggested it.",
        "Jack: Then why would you pull a stunt that sends Julia running to the cabin?!",
        "Carly: Julia went running to the cabin?",
        "Jack: Where else did you think she was gonna go?",
        "Carly: Well, I don't know, anywhere, just away from you!",
        "Jack: I was hoping you'd deny it. I was hoping I'd come home, and somehow, it wouldn't be true, but it is. You actually set Julia up?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I admit it. I set her up.",
        "Jack: What the hell were you thinking?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: I think that you gave Lucy good advice. I mean, if she follows her heart, she'll do the right thing, the honest thing.",
        "Craig: I'm starting to feel queasy.",
        "Sierra: That's because you're rooting for Rafael, and you know that Lucy doesn't love him. And if you remember, my heart didn't always lead me to the man that my mother approved of.",
        "Craig: You and I were in love.",
        "Sierra: And so are Lucy and Dusty.",

        "Dusty: You're saying you got feelings for this guy?",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Are you in love with him?",
        "Lucy: It's -- it's not like what I feel for you. I love you. I love you so much. When you act like my being with Rafael was just some fly-by-night thing, it hurts. I'm sorry. You know the last thing that I want is -- is to make you feel bad, but I don't want to lie about this.",
        "Dusty: Where does this leave you and me? I want us back together. I got to know where I stand.",
        "Lucy: I just told you. I love you.",
        "Dusty: But what?",
        "Lucy: What happened changed me. If I were to say that everything will just go back to the way it was, I wouldn't be being honest. And I'm trying to be, because we promised that we'd always be honest with each other.",
        "Dusty: Come on. I told you from the beginning this was my fault. The plane crash, the fact I got involved with Dom again. It's my fault.",
        "Lucy: I'm not blaming you for what Dominic Ramsey did. But yeah, I wouldn't be standing here feeling ashamed that I had slept with another man if you hadn't walked away from me and from us.",
        "Dusty: I was trying to protect you.",
        "Lucy: Then you should have never left my side! But you pushed me away. You turned your back on me, and now you're asking me to turn my back on the one person who was there for me. And Rafael, he kept me alive when I thought that we were gonna die. And when there was nothing left, and he offered me his love, yeah, I was grateful to accept it.",
        "Dusty: Well, I guess that tells me everything I need to know. Doesn't it?",
        "Lucy: Dusty, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How's Aaron? Is he okay?",
        "Lily: Did you remove the clot?",
        "Ben: It was close, but we got all of it.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Ben: He's out of the woods now.",
        "Alison: Oh, did you hear that! He's gonna be okay. When can we see him?!",
        "Ben: Well, soon. He's gonna be in recovery for a little while, and then they'll wheel him up to his room.",
        "Lily: Oh, it took a really long time.",
        "Ben: Yeah, well, that's 'cause I took the opportunity to do some extra repairs while I had the chance.",
        "Alison: Are you talking about his arm?",
        "Ben: Right. See, the reason I recommended to Bob that he bring Aaron in for extra tests was because I had a theory about taking care of the paralysis on his right side.",
        "Alison: So his arm will be better? He won't be paralyzed anymore?",
        "Ben: Well, I can't guarantee it, but the repair was successful, and I'm believing that Aaron's gonna regain full mobility. We just have to wait and see.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but it won't get any worse, right?",
        "Ben: Right. It's gonna get much better.",
        "Lily: Thank you. Thank you so much.",

        "Carly: What was I thinking? One thing -- the one thing that I've been thinking about since that woman entered my life -- protect my family.",
        "Jack: So you take your compass, and you plant it in her purse to make it look like she stole it?",
        "Carly: You know, you and Holden, you're not capable of seeing her for what she really is.",
        "Jack: What, a thief?",
        "Carly: Yes, exactly. But she gets her hooks into people and not things. And Lily and I decided that we were gonna do something about it.",
        "Jack: By framing her?",
        "Carly: She's a threat, Jack, to Lily's family and to mine, and we want her gone!",
        "Jack: I know that you see her as a threat, Carly, and I own up to my part in that, but there's -- it's impossible to justify what you did. You don't go out of your way to make someone look like a stalker!",
        "Carly: Do you honestly thing that -- that this is something that Julia is not capable of not doing? A couple of months ago, what did she do, Jack? She came here into our home when I wasn't here. She realized that you had a wife and children who were in agony without you, and what did she do? Did she wait here for me to come home so she could tell me the truth? Did she go to you and tell you the truth? No. First, she stole your badge, and then she tried to hide it from you, like she was hiding so many other things from you.",
        "Jack: What she did was different than what you did.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Jack: Honey, she -- she didn't plan anything. She stumbled across the badge, and when she got scared, she kept it to herself. But what you did was calculated. Its sole purpose was to make her look terrible in front of the woman who was giving her a home. That's way over the line.",
        "Carly: Well, she is way over the line, Jack. But you don't see it, and Holden doesn't see it, because the two of you become like blind people whenever you're around her. If I'm guilty of anything, it's that I'm too direct. I don't act like some teary-eyed victim around you to gain your sympathy. Why don't you wake up? She is not a victim.",
        "Jack: You see it any way you want to see it, but when you start taking matters into your own hands, that's where I do draw the line. The situation is complicated, yes. It's difficult. I was handling it though!",
        "Carly: You were handling it? How? By getting together with Holden and then setting Julia up on the family farm? That's not handling anything, that's just playing into her hands!",
        "Jack: Do you have any idea the position you put me in? I have been doing everything to work things out with her for J.J.'s sake, and now, who knows what she's gonna do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: I wish I had the answers. I hate to see you sad.",
        "Holden: It's just good to have an understanding here.",
        "Julia: It is, huh? I miss that. That's why I fell so hard for Jack, you know, because he was a really good listener, like you. He just stopped listening to me in the end though.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Julia: I don't know, I mean, it's like you were saying earlier, you know? You have all this love, and you want so much to give it to the person you care about. But then, you realize there's this void, this gulf that's developed between the two of you, and they can't see or hear you anymore. And you might as well be shouting into the wind. Mm. And it's hard. You know, it's hard to watch the person that you love throw your love away. It hurts. You're standing there with your heart on your sleeve, and you just feel like an idiot.",
        "Holden: That's how I was on New Year's Eve, till I saw you.",
        "Julia: Oh, well, I was looking around the Lakeview, and I wanted to die before you showed up.",
        "Holden: How come?",
        "Julia: 'Cause all of those people, they were celebrating, looking toward the future, and I just didn't even know how I was gonna get through the next day.",
        "Holden: How do you get through the next day, the next hour?",
        "Julia: Hmm, J.J., myself, my work.",
        "Holden: Yeah, me, too. Work, the kids, try to stay busy. But sometimes, staying busy just isn't enough, sometimes. Sometimes you need -- I need --",
        "Julia: Someone to put their arms around you?",

        "Jessica: Make sure this gets to the A.D.A. right away, along with the arrest report.",

        "Ben: Hey, we got it in time. Aaron's gonna be okay.",
        "Jessica: Oh, Ben, thank God!",
        "Ben: Thanks for being here for me, supporting me.",
        "Jessica: I'll always be here for you. And look what happened -- Aaron -- Aaron will live to be able to thank you.",
        "Ben: Hey, well, we both have a lot to be thankful for. Bob put everything on the line when he allowed me to operate tonight.",
        "Jessica: Well, he knew there was no risk. You're the best.",
        "Ben: He believed in me, even after I let him down.",
        "Jessica: Bob Hughes is very wise, and you rewarded his wisdom by giving Aaron his life back. You must be very proud.",
        "Ben: Just glad I could help, you know? Glad I can walk away knowing that I did something positive.",
        "Jessica: Well, maybe you should reconsider walking away.",
        "Alison: You've been so brave, Aaron, and you're gonna be okay now. Dr. Harris said so. Everything is gonna be fine.",
        "Nurse: We're gonna have to take him up to his room now.",
        "Alison: Don't worry, I won't leave you. I'm gonna be right here beside you. I love you. Aaron, do you have any idea what you just did?! You just squeezed my hand!",

        "Sierra: And then she unwound the entire tape of the state department meeting. [Craig laughs] Do you remember that? But no, no, you're forgetting the one thing that she said.",

        "Carly: Sometimes.",
        "Jack: Well, you'd better clear that up, because nothing I say is gonna make a difference unless you believe me.",
        "Carly: I believe you, Jack. I'm just really angry.",
        "Jack: I love you, and I'm committed to you and our family, hmm? And if you believe that, you'll stop seeing Julia as a threat.",
        "Carly: I believe you, honey, and I trust you. I just don't trust her.",
        "Jack: She's the mother of my son.",
        "Carly: Oh, he is not your son! Jack -- I'm sorry. I know that he's important to you. I know that this matters a great deal to you. But you already have a little boy, Parker, who you didn't bring camping, and he is trying to understand but doesn't quite get why he's left out. Have you seen his drawings lately? He's drawing pictures of our family, and you and Sage and me, we're all together, and he's way off on like the edge of the paper. He just doesn't understand what he did to make you go out and find yourself a new son!",
        "Jack: No, no, I'm not replacing Parker with J.J.",
        "Carly: Well, why don't you explain that to him? 'Cause I sure can't. Can't you see that this is not working, Jack. Not for anybody, including Parker and J.J. You tried. You did the best you could. You bent over backwards, but Julia and J.J. Are just making things worse! You've got to cut them loose.",

        "Lily: Yes, Emma, Ben said the surgery was a complete success, and Aaron is out of the woods. Yeah, thank you for relieving the baby-sitter and staying with the girls. I appreciate it. No, I haven't been able to reach Holden. The reception at the cabin is very, very bad. Um, after everything that happened today, I -- I hate even asking this, but could you spend the night? Thank you. I just Holden would want to be there when Aaron wakes up, and I'm just gonna drive up to the cabin and get him. Okay? Thank you. I love you, too. Bye.",
