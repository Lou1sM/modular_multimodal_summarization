        "Casey tries to get back on track with Allison, but she is in a bad mood and pushes him away. They talk about their relationship \u0096 or lack of it \u0096 and still won't take that step to admit anything mostly now because Allison is unsure what Casey is doing with Jade. Robbie takes Derek hostage at gunpoint. Bonnie and Lily talk about Derek and Jade, as Margo comes by to tell them that Robbie has escaped and could be heading for Oakdale. Jade, Luke and Noah talk about Lucinda and Brian, but Jade gets a call from Robbie telling her that he has Derek and she should come alone. Casey sees Jade take off and he follows her. Robbie threatens to kill Jade in front of Derek, but Casey interrupts and Robbie has more then he bargained for. He ends up shooting Derek and seemingly knocking Casey unconscious. He is about to exact his revenge on Jade when Margo and the police bust in (with Lily and Bonnie in tow) and take Robbie into custody. Derek is taken into surgery while Bonnie and Jade worry. Allison is upset to hear what happened to Casey but is still bothered to see Casey and Jade's newfound closeness. Derek gets out of surgery and wants himself and Jade tested to see if they are father and daughter. Casey and Allison are getting close to kissing when an oblivious Jade interrupts wanting to take Casey to lunch to thank him. When Casey finally accepts, instinctively Allison pulls back from him again. Lucinda and Brian have it out again and she orders him out of her life and the Foundation. Brian goes to see Luke, but finds Noah instead. He is acting strangely and is happy to hear that they got back together so things can end well. Noah is so worried about his behavior that he follows Brian, who is packing up, as he stares at some prescription medication nearby. Luke goes to see Lucinda to help her through this with Brian and they make some headway; then Noah calls about Brian and Luke decides to meet Noah at Brian's' but Lucinda won't go. Luke and Noah force Brian to face the truth about himself; he angrily and exasperatedly admits he is gay, as Lucinda walks in. Lucinda and Brian come to an understanding and seem to find closure, as Brian heads out of town to see a therapist, as he has to learn to embrace who he actually is now."

        "Casey: Guess who's done for the day?",
        "Alison: I couldn't imagine.",
        "Casey: It's me. I am. That's who.",
        "Alison: Lucky you.",
        "Casey: Um, I think you should check out the east stairwell. Are you going to ask me why?",
        "Alison: I'm assuming you cleaned it.",
        "Casey: That doesn't even begin to describe it. It's a work of art.",
        "Alison: That is great.",
        "Casey: Okay, a little enthusiasm here would be nice.",
        "Alison: It's a stairwell, Casey. And if it means that much to you, I'll try not to use it and mess it up.",
        "Casey: Okay. So what did I do wrong so I can apologize about it, and we can go back to having a real conversation? Why are you so mad?",
        "Alison: I'm not mad at you.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Alison: I know, it's hard to believe.",
        "Casey: Is this about the other day?",
        "Alison: The other day?",
        "Casey: When we almost kissed? Are you, I don't know, weirded about it? Because if you are --",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm really not. In fact, I actually completely forgot about it.",
        "Casey: Okay, that's cool. Whatever.",
        "Alison: And why would I even be weirded by it? I mean, it's not like we haven't kissed before. But we're just friends.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and friends don't kiss friends.",
        "Alison: Right. Besides, we both agreed, we don't want anything more. Right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Okay, I might be completely overstepping my bounds here. And if I am, just tell me. I won't be offended. Because I know that I keep coming to you with this. It's --",
        "Lily: You want to talk about Derek and Jade. Please, sit.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. Has she even mentioned Derek to you?",
        "Lily: No, she hasn't.",
        "Bonnie: I tried to talk to her at New Year's Eve, and it didn't really go over so well.",
        "Lily: I can't say I'm surprised.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, come on, Lily. There has to be something we can do. They can't just keep walking around avoiding each other.",
        "Lily: Jade is one stubborn little girl. I mean, if she doesn't want to do something, good luck convincing her otherwise. She's a lot like my sister that way.",
        "Bonnie: Maybe that stubborn streak isn't all Rose. Derek and Jade, they are a lot alike. And I would just hate for them to miss out on the chance to get to know each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Robby Sanchez was in your custody, Agent Moniz. I mean, how did he manage to escape the federal pen? All right, fine. Fine, fine, you don't know. But the prisoner's not in my jurisdiction. Why aren't you talking to someone in Florida? Chicago? When?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: Bonnie? I got your note. The napkin's cute, but why didn't you just text me? Bonnie? Sanchez.",
        "Robby: What's up, Papi?",
        "Derek: What are you doing here? I thought you're supposed to be in jail.",
        "Robby: Turns out, I had more important things to do.",
        "Derek: Yeah, like what?",
        "Robby: Like making you and that little bitch pay.",
        "Derek: If you're talking about Jade --",
        "Robby: Who else would I be talking about, man? She turned on me. And she's going to be sorry. Just as sorry as you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Jade!",
        "Jade: That's why you didn't come home last night.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I spent the night in Noah's dorm room.",
        "Noah: Yeah, my roommate's on extended winter break, so --",
        "Jade: Oh, and you're taking full advantage?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Jade: Well, good for you guys.",
        "Noah: Incredibly good.",
        "Luke: Noah!",
        "Noah: What? I'm just agreeing with her.",
        "Luke: But anyways, I just wanted to say thank you. We both wanted to say thank you so much. If you and Casey hadn't pushed us together a couple days ago, who knows where we'd be right now.",
        "Noah: Yeah, probably giving each other the cold shoulder.",
        "Jade: Well, it was actually a fluke, but you're welcome. I'm glad everything worked out for you guys.",
        "Luke: Well, not everything.",
        "Jade: What do you mean?",
        "Luke: Well, my grandmother and I still kind of have issues.",
        "Jade: I thought things were better with her.",
        "Noah: Yeah, so did I.",
        "Luke: Well, we've called a truce. But it's not like before Brian came into the picture. I don't know if she'll ever get over what he did to her. And until she does, I don't know where that leaves us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Brian: I came to collect my things.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. You mean these things? These things? Well all right. Let me help you. Making it easier for you, all right?",
        "Brian: Damn it, Lucinda, why are you doing this?",
        "Lucinda: I thought I told you I never wanted to see you again.",
        "Brian: Kicking me out wasn't enough? Now you gotta resort to destroying my personal property as well?",
        "Lucinda: I am ridding myself of anything that might remind me of you.",
        "Brian: Well, that's just too damn bad, lady. Because I'm not going anywhere. Look, I understand that you hate me.",
        "Lucinda: I never said that.",
        "Brian: But you know that I never set out to hurt you, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: No, you wanted to take care of me. You wanted to give me something to live for, someone to love.",
        "Brian: I did love you. I do love you.",
        "Lucinda: No, not really. You couldn't manage that.",
        "Brian: You make it sound like I didn't want to. I did the best I could.",
        "Lucinda: What was I, some kind of a test case?",
        "Brian: What do you need me to say? What will it take to make this better?",
        "Lucinda: You can't make it better. I came into the relationship. I really did. I tried. I came with an open mind and an open heart. But you weren't able to do that.",
        "Brian: I'm sorry.",
        "Lucinda: Well, sorry isn't good enough. You also told me that was beautiful and desirable.",
        "Brian: Lucinda, look at me. Look at me and tell me that you have any doubts that I loved you.",
        "Lucinda: I know you loved me. I just feel terrible that I ever thought about loving you back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You guys are finally together and happy. Don't let your grandmother ruin this for you.",
        "Luke: That's not what she's doing.",
        "Noah: I get where Lucinda's coming from. I mean, remember how it was for Maddie when she found out I was gay? It wasn't something she could accept overnight.",
        "Jade: Well, fooling Maddie into thinking you're straight, I can see that happening. I mean, she was on the rebound from Casey, she's not really Miss Sophisticated. But Lucinda's been alive for a long time. How could she not see that? And not only that, then ask him to marry her?",
        "Luke: Because she thought he loved her.",
        "Jade: You only see what you want to see. If you ask me, they were both in denial.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I know we sort of blurred the lines a little bit on New Year's Eve.",
        "Alison: You know why that happened, Casey.",
        "Casey: Yes. You were willing to do anything to cover the fact that you were hiding Lucy and Johnny in that room.",
        "Alison: And you were really messed up over Maddie.",
        "Casey: I wasn't exactly messed up.",
        "Alison: Okay, it doesn't matter. Because what happened that night didn't mean anything.",
        "Casey: How can you say that? Speaking for myself, I know --",
        "Mia: Alison, thanks again for those tickets.",
        "Alison: Oh, you're welcome.",
        "Casey: What tickets?",
        "Mia: To Ac/Dc. You missed a great show.",
        "[Pager beeping]",
        "Mia: Gotta love the E.R. thanks again.",
        "Casey: You had tickets to Ac/Dc?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I got them last minute. It's not a big deal.",
        "Casey: And you bailed? Why?",
        "Alison: I didn't have anyone to go with.",
        "Casey: Hello, I love those guys. All those hours playing Rock Star. Any of those songs sound familiar?",
        "Alison: Okay, honestly, Casey? I did think of asking you. But I didn't want you to get the wrong impression.",
        "Casey: Oh, okay, so we're friends, but we can't really go out if we make plans first? Do I have that right? I'm just --",
        "Alison: You know what, Casey? If you really wanted to go, you could've gotten your own tickets and made a real big night of it. I have patients to go check on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: So you haven't asked Jade how she feels about Derek?",
        "Lily: No, I have. She just always finds a way around it.",
        "Bonnie: So, maybe she's not interested in getting to know Derek at all?",
        "Lily: If she does care, I'm not sure she'll admit it. Why is this so important to you?",
        "Bonnie: I really like Derek, Lily. I mean, I really like him. More than I should at this point, and that's --",
        "Lily: Scary?",
        "Bonnie: It's terrifying. It's terrifying. If he's the kind of man who can turn his back on his own flesh and blood, I cannot afford to go on feeling this way.",
        "Lily: Do you want my advice?",
        "Bonnie: It can't be worse than what I'm telling myself, right?",
        "Lily: Don't give up on Derek so easily. This is a difficult situation for everyone. It's going to take awhile to sort through it, no matter what the outcome is.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bonnie: Oh, sorry. One second here. Hello?",
        "Margo: Hey, Bonnie. Yeah, it's Margo. Where are you?",
        "Bonnie: I'm at Lily's at the moment.",
        "Margo: Great. Stay there. I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brian: So, this is it? This is how we're going to end things?",
        "Lucinda: Things ended between us long before this.",
        "Brian: I know I've made terrible mistakes.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. You tried to bed my grandson. I don't think any woman could call that just an error in judgment.",
        "Brian: It's just that I was floundering for so long. When we found each other, you grounded me, Lucinda. You became the one thing in my life that made any sense.",
        "Lucinda: You just wanted someone to hide behind.",
        "Brian: No. Why are you so determined to act as if nothing we had was real?",
        "Lucinda: Because it wasn't real. I deserve better.",
        "Brian: Yes. Yes, you do. And I wish I could've given that to you. You don't know how much I wish I could've given that to you.",
        "Lucinda: Well, there's no point in talking about this anymore. I don't want to talk about it anymore.",
        "Brian: You want me to beg, is that it? Will that make you feel better?",
        "Lucinda: This isn't about making me feel any better.",
        "Brian: I'm not asking you to forgive me.",
        "Lucinda: No. This is about me helping you to find some closure.",
        "Brian: I really thought that because I cared about you so much, I could make this work. And I'm just asking you to give me the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Lucinda: I can't give you anything. I mean, I can't give you anything. You want this? Okay, let me give this to you. Here it is. That's it. Take it and go. And go now, please, quickly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Have you talked to Derek?",
        "Jade: No. And I don't plan on it.",
        "Luke: Aren't you a little bit curious?",
        "Jade: Why, because he knew my mother 20 years ago? Sorry, I'm going to need a little more than that.",
        "Luke: All right, so I guess this is your way of saying this conversation is kaput.",
        "Jade: No, we can talk about whatever you want, but I'm out of coffee.",
        "Luke: All right, I'll get you some.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jade: Hello?",
        "Robby: Hey, Peaches.",
        "Jade: Who is this?",
        "Robby: You know who it is.",
        "Jade: Why are you calling me? I didn't think they gave you phone privileges.",
        "Robby: I can get anything I want on the outside.",
        "Jade: You're out?",
        "Robby: That's right. And I want to see you.",
        "Jade: I don't think that's going to happen.",
        "Robby: Why? You don't want to say good-bye to your bodyguard?",
        "Derek: You leave her alone. Jade, stay away!",
        "Robby: Shut up!",
        "Jade: Was that Derek? What did you do to him? Where are you?",
        "Robby: Someplace called Metro. Do you know where it is?",
        "Jade: Yeah.",
        "Robby: Come alone.",
        "Luke: Where are you going?",
        "Casey: Hey, you almost ran me over.",
        "Jade: I have to go to Metro.",
        "Casey: It's the middle of the day, it's not even open.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Where'd Jade go?",
        "Luke: I don't know. She just bolted.",
        "Noah: Was it something you said?",
        "Luke: No, I think it was your coffee.",
        "Noah: Oh!",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Luke: Hi, Grandma.",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Dear. I just wanted to give you the heads-up.",
        "Luke: Oh. About what?",
        "Lucinda: Brian was here at the office.",
        "Luke: Are you all right? Brian was there.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, of course I'm all right. I just -- I'm just calling you, because I didn't want you to be caught off-guard.",
        "Luke: Oh. Okay.",
        "Lucinda: I don't trust him, I don't know why he's resurfaced now.",
        "Luke: He didn't say why he was there?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, who cares? Anyway, the point is, I'm calling you because I just wanted you know. And you and Noah are together, for God's sake. Just be together! Be together and have a lovely day, that's all. Can you do that for me?",
        "Luke: Of course. Easily.",
        "Lucinda: Good. Thank you, Darling. That's the reason I was calling.",
        "Noah: So Brian's back? How is Lucinda doing?",
        "Luke: She says she's fine.",
        "Noah: But you don't believe her?",
        "Luke: How could she be? She was so in love with him. You saw how devastated she was when everything fell apart. For him to show up out of the blue, that must have been really hard.",
        "Noah: Maybe you should go talk to her.",
        "Luke: No, I don't think that's a very good idea.",
        "Noah: Why not? You said yourself it was going to take some work to get things right between you guys.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I don't know.",
        "Noah: You're going to have to start sometime.",
        "Luke: Yeah, right.",
        "Noah: Luke, all I'm saying is, if neither one of you makes a move, it's never going to get better between you two. I mean, think about where we would be right now if we hadn't talked things out.",
        "Luke: Yeah, you're right. I'll go talk to her. Thank you.",
        "Noah: You don't have to thank me.",
        "Luke: Well, trust me -- I will later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Good, I'm glad you're both here. Something has happened.",
        "Bonnie: What?",
        "Margo: I got a call from Florida a while ago. Robby Sanchez has escaped.",
        "Lily: How is that possible?",
        "Margo: The details are a little iffy.",
        "Lily: And they don't know where he is?",
        "Bonnie: No, there's more to that. You think he's headed here, don't you?",
        "Margo: I -- I can't say for sure. But -- and I don't want to alarm you. But, he was spotted in a bus station in Chicago.",
        "Lily: Margo, the last time Robby was in town, he was trying to kill Jade.",
        "Margo: I know, I know. That's why I'm here. Do you have any idea where Jade is?",
        "Lily: No, she went out, and I don't know where she is.",
        "Margo: Do you think it's possible that she's heard from Robby?",
        "Lily: No, she would've told me if she had.",
        "Margo: Well, you know, just to be on the safe side, why don't you call Jade, and tell her to come home. And we'll put her under police protection.",
        "Lily: Absolutely, I'll call her right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Oh, my God, Derek. Are you okay?",
        "Robby: I'm fine too. Thanks for asking.",
        "Derek: I told you not to come here.",
        "Robby: Maybe she's got the hots for you, Papi. Enjoy it. I know I sure did.",
        "Jade: Do you know how messed up you are?",
        "Robby: What about you? How messed up are you? Thinking you could jam me up. You're not going to get away with it, you know that!",
        "Jade: No, you know what? They were trying to nail me for helping you. If I didn't the truth, I was going to jail!",
        "Robby: You caved. And now you're going to find out what happens to people who double- cross me.",
        "Jade: No, Robby, please. Calm down, okay? I'll do whatever you want. Just --",
        "Casey: Jade!",
        "Robby: What the hell? I told you to come alone.",
        "Jade: I did. I didn't know he followed me.",
        "Robby: Who else knows you're here?",
        "Jade: No one, I swear.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Robby: You're a liar. And liars die first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I have nothing to say to you --",
        "Brian: Just hear me out, Noah. I need your help.",
        "Noah: With what?",
        "Brian: With Luke.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Hi. Hi, Darling. What are you doing here?",
        "Luke: I was worried about you.",
        "Lucinda: Why?",
        "Luke: Brian came by, it must have been hard. What did he want?",
        "Lucinda: Well, we both know it wasn't me. Sorry. That was a joke.",
        "Luke: I guess I just don't really find any of this funny.",
        "Lucinda: No, I'm fine, Hon. I'm really fine. He's out of my life, and I'm just going to forget that he ever was there.",
        "Luke: Are you sure you can do that?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, I'm gonna give it -- well, I'm gonna give it a real hell of a try.",
        "Luke: Well, I'd like to help you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my darling. Everybody's giving me advice, help me how to cope with this.",
        "Luke: I've got a little bit, too. The first thing is, you shouldn't cut me out.",
        "Lucinda: You are over-reacting.",
        "Luke: No, you always do this. You act like everything's fine when it's not. But I can't keep pretending that nothing happened. Look, I've said this over and over. Maybe you'll finally believe it. I am so sorry. I should've told you what happened with Brian immediately. It's just you were dealing with cancer and surgery. And it seemed like Brian was some sort of secret weapon in the battle of your life. So how could I take that away from you?",
        "Lucinda: If it had only happened just once -- but it kept on.",
        "Luke: The second time -- the second time Brian hit on me, he was drunk. And he told me it would never happen again. And then when I kissed him -- he told you that story about the mugger. I just didn't want to lose you.",
        "Lucinda: So you chose silence.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I did. And look at where it got us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Look, man, I -- I don't know what's going on in here.",
        "Robby: Then stay out of it.",
        "Casey: But I know you don't want to do this.",
        "Robby: What do you know about anything, man?",
        "Casey: I've been there. I've been locked up.",
        "Robby: Like I care.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and you don't want to go back there!",
        "Robby: I could be going either way, so why not make it worth it?",

And who I was, how I felt inside, like you do, it didn't fit with how he expected things to be. How he expected me to be. How he wanted me to be. And yeah it took awhile, but I realized I have to live my life, not his.",
        "Brian: Oh, good for you, Noah. And you too, Luke. No, really, I mean that. You two figured out a way to be happy and you went for it. And I applaud you. But that's not really something that I can do at this stage of my life.",

        "Luke: I think that it would mean that maybe for once in your life you'd finally be happy. Isn't that what you want? I mean, I might be wrong --",
        "Brian: Okay, you're right! You're right! All right? Is that what you need to hear? That you've been right all along and I'm gay!",
