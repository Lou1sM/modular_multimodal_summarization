        "Simon: Okay, will you slow down, Katie, so we can just -- just please talk about this for a moment?",
        "Katie: There's nothing to talk about. I've made up my mind. We're leaving Oakdale. I need to call Pam so she can let her clients know that the house is back on the market.",
        "Simon: What if I was to tell you I -- I don't want to leave?",
        "Katie: Are you kidding? Why wouldn't you want to leave? We can go someplace new, where no one knows anything about our lives.",
        "Simon: I kind of liked the idea of having a home for once.",
        "Katie: You told me to trust my instincts, and they would let me know what to do. Well, I did, and they have. This is the right thing.",
        "Simon: What, running away?",
        "Katie: Running away from the home that I shared with Brad, in the town where everyone knows us as a couple. If I stay here, I'm gonna become that poor woman who tragically lost her husband, and I'm gonna drown in the sympathy. Jacob and I need a new start in a new place.",
        "Simon: With me?",
        "Katie: Yes, with you. What are we talking about?",
        "Simon: What we're talking about, then, is a life on the run. You know me. You know the life I've led. We're gonna be always looking over our shoulders, you know, panicking when we hear a -- a police siren or someone knocking unexpectedly at the door. Is that really the life that you want for you and your son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, Henry.",
        "Henry: Margo.",
        "Margo: Where are you off to in such a hurry?",
        "Henry: Katie's.",
        "Margo: Oh. So fast.",
        "Henry: Listen, whatever Mr. Lee told you, just know there are two sides to every story. I never met Clarissa in my life. In fact, she approached me, and she tricked me into thinking --",
        "Margo: Henry, Henry, Henry, I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't know anything about a Clarissa or Mr. Lee, or -- should I?",
        "Henry: No. Absolutely not. It's a complete misunderstanding.",
        "Margo: No -- no crimes committed?",
        "Henry: Crimes? What do you -- what do you take me for?",
        "Margo: You know, I think the less I know about whatever you're talking about, the better. I just wanted to say hello to my little nephew.",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah!",
        "Margo: Hey, Buckaroo! How are -- [Margo gasps] You are getting so big.",
        "Henry: Pretty soon, he's gonna be riding bikes and chasing girls.",
        "Margo: Well, he is Brad's son. It might be the other way around.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Henry: That's a good point.",
        "Margo: So, how's Katie?",
        "Henry: She is pulling herself together, actually, and I hate to say it, but I think Simon's been a good influence on her.",
        "Margo: Well, I -- I tend to agree. And him having a steady job helps, thanks to you.",
        "Henry: Just trying to do my part.",
        "Margo: You know what? I guess a leopard can change his spots.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, what are you telling me, Simon? That if we leave town, you're all of the sudden gonna go back to your life of crime?",
        "Simon: No. Those days are over for me. You know that.",
        "Katie: Good.",
        "Simon: What I'm saying is that once I start moving around, then I run the risk of drawing attention. Why tempt fate?",
        "Katie: Well, I'd rather tempt fate than be haunted by it. Brad's memory is everywhere in this house. It's all over town. I feel it when I walk past our favorite restaurant. As hard as I'm trying to let him go, I am just reminded of him everywhere.",
        "Simon: I got it. I got it. I understand. And whatever I can help you do to get stronger, I will. But I just -- I do not want you to make a spur of the moment decision that you might regret later.",
        "Katie: That's not what this is.",
        "Simon: Okay. All right, then. So let's take a few days, think it through, and be sure. Look, in this current market, it's not like the realtor's gonna find a buyer overnight anyway, right?",
        "Katie: We don't have to wait for that to leave.",
        "Simon: When were you actually thinking of going?",
        "Katie: How about today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Come on, Honey. Just -- just eat a little bit.",
        "Liberty: Have you seen what is under that lid, Mom? I could actually cook a better meal, and I can't even cook. Why am I still here? I'm fine. I just want to go home and get in my bed and have some of your lasagna.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, Sweetie, they will release you soon, okay?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I just wish they'd let me see Parker while I'm waiting. Hey, why don't you go check on him for me?",
        "Janet: Because I don't want to let you go yet! Oh, no.",
        "Liberty: Mom, please, really. Way too tight.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know, I'm sorry. I just should never have let you go to Detroit without me.",
        "Liberty: What are you gonna do when I go to F.I.T., huh?",
        "Janet: Um, stylish ankle monitoring bracelet?",
        "Liberty: Mom, please. Please go check on Parker for me.",
        "Janet: In a minute.",
        "Liberty: I get it. You don't want to be in the same room as Jack and Carly.",
        "Janet: I am not worried about seeing Jack or Carly.",
        "Liberty: Prove it.",
        "Janet: Fine. Come here, you. Oh! Mm! Love you!",
        "Jack: Hey, there, buddy boy. How are you feeling?",
        "Parker: Like I want to get out of here.",
        "Carly: What did the doctor say?",
        "Parker: It -- it's a hairline fracture on my tibia.",
        "Jack: No infection?",
        "Nurse: Localized. We were able to keep it from spreading. It's a good thing you had him airlifted in.",
        "Jack: Oh, it looks like we owe Dusty big time.",
        "Carly: Try not to choke as you say that.",
        "Jack: Well, whatever I feel about the guy, I'm indebted to him. So it looks like you're gonna make it after all.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but no hockey for me this season.",
        "Jack: Baseball's just around the corner.",
        "Carly: So, can we take him home, then?",
        "Nurse: We just have one more set of x-rays to do.",
        "Parker: Actually, I'd -- I'd really like to go and check on Liberty to make sure that she's okay.",
        "Carly: Okay. After the x-ray.",
        "Jack: I told you he'd be all right.",
        "Carly: Our little boy's gonna be all right.",
        "Jack: Janet.",
        "Janet: Hi. Liberty sent me on a mission to come see how Parker's doing.",
        "Jack: He's good. He's good. No infection. Just a hairline fracture.",
        "Janet: That's great.",
        "Jack: We're lucky. Liberty, too.",
        "Carly: Yeah. How is she doing?",
        "Janet: She's good. She's fine. She's ready to go home.",
        "Jack: I think we all are.",
        "Janet: Really?",
        "Jack: Carly, can you give us a minute, please?",
        "Carly: Yeah, sure.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Oh, hey, do you think that Liberty's, uh, up for a visit from Parker?",
        "Janet: She would love it.",
        "Carly: Good. Well, he's just getting one last x-ray, and then I'll tell him.",
        "Jack: I'm glad that Liberty's okay.",
        "Janet: They sure did give us a scare, didn't they?",
        "Jack: Yeah, they did. And I -- I can't help but feel responsible. You put me in charge of making sure she was gonna be fine.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no. You had -- you had other things to deal with. But you know what? It's -- it's my fault, too. You know, I should have come with her to Detroit, but she was so hell-bent on looking at Carly's portfolio, and I didn't want to get in the way.",
        "Jack: All that matters is that they're okay, so we can stop worrying about them and start focusing on other things.",
        "Janet: Anything in particular?",
        "Jack: Janet, come on. You know I'm talking about you and me. What we were talking about in Detroit before the kids disappeared, I -- I'd like to pick up where we left off.",
        "Janet: With the conversation, or with our marriage?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: This is disgusting. Ew.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Liberty: Unless that's Parker, I'm already checked out and gone. Ah! Hey.",
        "Parker: I guess you're in luck.",
        "Liberty: Gimpy!",
        "Parker: Hey, there, Scouty.",
        "Liberty: Are you actually in need of that brace, or are you just trying to get a little sympathy, huh?",
        "Parker: Well, seeing as how I'm getting pushed around by my mom in a wheelchair and being fussed over like I'm 4 years old, what do you think?",
        "Liberty: No, seriously, same here. My mom won't even let me breathe on my own.",
        "Carly: Hey, we are allowed to hover over you guys for at least 24 hours after nearly losing you to the wild, okay?",
        "Parker: You didn't nearly lose us. Scoutmaster Liberty would never have let that happen. But I -- I mean, seriously, I mean, you built a crutch and then got me out of there. That was -- that was pretty impressive.",
        "Liberty: Kind of was, wasn't it?",
        "Carly: It absolutely was, and I don't even know how to thank you. Except I am gonna help you put together your portfolio for F.I.T.",
        "Liberty: That would be awesome. Thank you, Carly, really.",
        "Carly: Sure.",
        "Parker: Seriously, when are they gonna let you out of here?",
        "Liberty: I have no idea, and it's really annoying. When are they letting you out?",
        "Parker: Well, I'm just waiting for the results from my last x-ray, and then I'm --",
        "Dr. Brigham: Ah. I was told I'd find you in here.",
        "Parker: What's the word?",
        "Dr. Brigham: According to the x-rays, there's no damage beyond the fracture.",
        "Parker: Awesome.",
        "Carly: Oh, so we can go home?",
        "Dr. Brigham: Mm-hmm.",
        "Parker: But how about Liberty?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Hi.",
        "Parker: I mean, she -- she's not even hurt, but they haven't released her yet.",
        "Dr. Brigham: I'd have to check with Dr. Pressman about that.",
        "Parker: Well, could you?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, please.",
        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Liberty: Please.",
        "Carly: So, are you ready to go, then?",
        "Parker: I kind of wanted to wait until they let Liberty go.",
        "Liberty: Oh, no, no, no, no. You really don't have to do that.",
        "Parker: No, please. You waited with me in that shack. The least I could do is repay the favor.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm sure that I can go as soon as my mom gets back. Go home. I'll -- I'll call you later.",
        "Parker: You promise?",
        "Liberty: Scout's honor.",
        "Parker: Oh.",
        "Liberty: What is it, this?",
        "Parker: Oh, boy. Wow, no, you're lame enough, thank you.",
        "Liberty: Oh! Go before they make you stay any longer.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Liberty: Bye, Gimpy!",
        "Carly: We'll go. Good-bye, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Bye, Carly.",
        "Carly: Thank you so much again.",
        "Parker: Liberty, seriously, thank you.",
        "Carly: Careful.",
        "Liberty: Oh! Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Slow down. Please, just stop cleaning. Slow down a bit and just take -- let's take a few days to look at all the angles.",
        "Katie: I don't want to. Then I'll get scared and lose my nerve.",
        "Simon: Scared you might find a reason to stick around?",
        "Katie: I can't believe I am hearing this from you. Since when do you give up an opportunity to be completely spontaneous and -- and go off somewhere?",
        "Simon: Maybe I'm not as selfish as I used to be.",
        "Katie: This is something that I want. You'd be doing it for me. What's selfish about that?",
        "Simon: Well, it would be selfish because, you know, quite frankly, I'm not convinced this is what you really want. Maybe what you're trying to do is outrun the fear of a life here without Brad.",
        "Katie: So what if I am? Maybe that's exactly what I need right now.",
        "Simon: No, no, running isn't the answer.",
        "Katie: Says the man who made a career out of it.",
        "Simon: Yeah, exactly. So I do know a thing or two about that. All right. Let's look at it from another perspective. What about the people you're leaving behind? I mean, Henry will have a heart attack. Margo will go ballistic.",
        "Katie: I am a grown woman. This is my decision. I'm following my heart. Jacob and I need to make a fresh start.",
        "Simon: I just need to be sure that you're sure.",
        "Katie: I am.",
        "Simon: Okay. You're choosing me over a life that you already have here?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Simon: Why?",
        "Katie: Because we can go to a completely new place. We can start over -- no past, no pain, no regrets. You need this as much as I do.",
        "Simon: You know what? You're right. I do.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Henry: Hey. Look who's getting his first tooth. What did I interrupt?",
        "Katie: Thank you for picking him up.",
        "Henry: No problem at all. We had a very good walk back. So, what's up?",
        "Katie: Henry, you know you are the best friend that I have ever had.",
        "Henry: Oh, my God. What have I done now? Uh, what have you done that I'm not gonna like?",
        "Simon: You'd better sit down, Henry.",
        "Henry: I'd better sit down? This isn't good. I -- do I need a drink?",
        "Simon: Oh, yeah, probably.",
        "Katie: No, listen, its good news. It's good news. You just need to promise me to hear me out before you react.",
        "Henry: Anything else?",
        "Katie: And not to tell anyone at all. This news stays in this room.",
        "Henry: Okay, I don't know if I should be intrigued or terrified.",
        "Katie: You should be happy.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Katie: Um, Simon and I -- well, we're leaving town.",
        "Henry: You're leaving town? You going skiing in Tahoe? Snorkeling in Baja?",
        "Katie: As in moving away.",
        "Henry: Away?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Henry: For good?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Henry: Okay. I am gonna need that drink, and you're gonna need a drink. And could you, uh, mix some martinis together so that I -- I can talk this woman out of this crazy idea?",
        "Simon: Good luck, Mate. I've already tried.",
        "Henry: You can't leave here. This is your home. Your family's here, your friends, me. I'm practically both.",
        "Katie: I know that. And please understand that I did not come to this decision lightly.",
        "Henry: Why did you come to this decision at all?",
        "Katie: You don't understand. It's about Brad.",
        "Henry: Is he still here? [Henry stammers] Brad, would you leave this poor woman alone? I can't see him now.",
        "Katie: No. Henry, stop.",
        "Henry: I thought you were gone for good.",
        "Katie: His ghost is not here, but his memory is everywhere, and I can't move on unless I get away from it. I can't learn how to become a whole person.",
        "Henry: You don't have to leave to be whole. We're all here to help you.",
        "Katie: I need to learn how to help myself. I need to start over, and I can't do that here.",
        "Henry: Uh, where will you go?",
        "Katie: I don't know. New York or Rome maybe. I don't know. We'll -- we'll end up where we're supposed to be.",
        "Henry: Okay. Did you force her into this? Is this your idea?",
        "Simon: Ha ha. Trust me, this was as big a shock to me as it is to you, Mate.",
        "Henry: Are you sure you didn't wake up with some con artist itch and say, \"Hey, you know what, Katie? I've got a really cool idea\"?",
        "Simon: I have spent the last half hour trying to talk her out of it.",
        "Katie: It's true. He did.",
        "Henry: Now you're okay with it?",
        "Simon: I'm okay with whatever makes Katie happy. And, Mate, as her best friend, I think you should do the same.",
        "Henry: No, I'm -- I'm in shock here, okay? I -- um, when? When -- when are you leaving?",
        "Katie: As soon as we can pack.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay. Knowing you, that will be at least a few weeks.",
        "Katie: Today, Henry. We're leaving today.",
        "Henry: What?! You're not thinking clearly here, okay? No. Absolutely -- I'm all for spontaneity, all right, but you're going a little overboard here.",
        "Katie: Maybe, but this is the right thing for me to do, so I need you to be my best friend and let me go, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I admit I was caught off guard when you showed up in Detroit, but the last time we talked, you were considering getting an annulment.",
        "Janet: I know, but then you told me to wait. You told me to think about it, right? So that made me think that you were willing to give us a second chance. And then when I show up in Detroit, you seemed -- you were distracted and different.",
        "Jack: Honey, that wasn't you, okay? I had just gone through this whole thing with Sage and this ridiculous pageant.",
        "Janet: I know. I know that. But I also know there was more to it. I think that you're still confused about what you want.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. Can we go someplace in private and talk about this, please?",
        "Janet: Yes, yes. Not right now. I think that -- I think the most important thing is just making sure the kids are okay and we get them home, and then we can see where we are.",
        "Carly: Hey. Excuse me. Um, Parker's ready to go.",
        "Jack: Where is he?",
        "Carly: He's just around the corner. He's waiting for us.",
        "Jack: Okay. Well, um, why don't you take him home, and I'll wait for Liberty?",
        "Janet: No, that's okay. It's okay. You go ahead, because Parker's gonna need you to get him in and out of the house, in and out of the car, all that stuff. So we'll just talk later, okay?",
        "Jack: Okay. You ready?",
        "Carly: Yeah. You okay?",
        "Jack: I'm fine. Let's just get our son home.",
        "Liberty: Thank God. Can we go? Otherwise, I'm gonna tie my sheets together and climb out the window.",
        "Janet: Oh, good. Then you can break your leg, and you and Parker can have matching casts.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Mom, I'm very -- I'm going crazy in here. Can we get out?",
        "Janet: Well, I'm not sure that's such a --",
        "Liberty: Whoa.",
        "Janet: Whoa, whoa, what?",
        "Liberty: Nothing. The room just did a 180.",
        "Janet: All right, get back in bed. Come on, get back in bed. It's probably all that time you spent out in the cold weather.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm dizzy because I've been cooped up in here for so long, and I'm starving. So once I just get home and have some real food, I'm gonna be fine. Speaking of food, something smells really good.",
        "Dusty: Somebody order room service?",
        "Janet: What are you doing here?",
        "Dusty: Just checking in. How are you feeling, Liberty?",
        "Liberty: Don't worry about that. What's in this bag?",
        "Dusty: Antipasti, eggplant carbonara, prosciutto, insalata caprese.",
        "Liberty: I just died and went to Italian heaven.",
        "Dusty: Well, your mom really cooks best. Teri tried her hardest. Anyway, you got minestrone soup in there. Be careful.",
        "Liberty: This smells so good, my stomach is doing cartwheels.",
        "Janet: You did not have to do this, Dusty.",
        "Liberty: Oh, yeah, he did, Mom. Whatever you're doing, just keep doing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Okay, for the first time in my life, I'm practically speechless here. I -- my friends quota goes from two to zero in about as much time as it takes to say \"Good-bye.\" It's actually three when you throw in my best buddy here.",
        "Katie: Henry --",
        "Henry: Henry what? There's -- there's nothing I can say to change your mind, is there?",
        "Katie: No, just be happy for me.",
        "Henry: Happy? It's really hard to be happy for you when you're breaking my heart.",
        "Katie: Henry, we will always be friends -- always.",
        "Henry: Friends? Friends? It's gonna be very difficult with thousands of miles in between us.",

        "Carly: Look how far she went to get us all to go to Detroit.",
        "Parker: She just wanted you guys to spend a lot of time together, thinking that maybe you guys would realize that you still love each other.",
        "Jack: Right, and now her heart is broken again, all over again, and that's not right. So I'm moving out before we give her any more unwarranted hope. All right, listen. I'm gonna go grab you some more pillows so you'll be more comfortable, okay?",
