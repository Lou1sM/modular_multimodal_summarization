        "Marshall: Good. I don't want Ben Harris anywhere near me.",
        "Bob: You are entitled to your opinion.",
        "Marshall: Look, the man tried to kill me.",
        "Bob: As an attorney, I'm sure you're aware that making allegations you \r\ncan't support is a very dangerous business. And as chief of staff of this \r\nhospital, I won't tolerate it. Whatever your history with Ben Harris, I will \r\nvouch for his medical ethics. And he would no more jeopardize your life in the \r\nO.R. than run you down with a car.",
        "Marshall: You're a loyal man, Dr. Hughes. I appreciate that. But Ben \r\nHarris had ample reason to wish me dead.",
        "Bob: Dr. Ramirez will handle your case. And you and Dr. Harris will \r\nsettle your differences after you leave my hospital. Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Bob. May I come in?",

        "Mike: Hey, Jack.",
        "Jack: Hey, Mike, you got a minute? Sorry for barging in like this \r\nwithout calling. But I had this great idea -- a surprise for Carly. And I was \r\nwondering if you guys could help me with it.",
        "Mike: Sure. Come on in.",
        "Jack: Oh, great. Listen, after we talked, I got to thinking about the \r\nbaby coming. And --",

        "Rosanna: Excuse me? Carly Tenney advocating prayer? You must be \r\ndesperate.",
        "Carly: Well, look at you -- up and about. You must be feeling better.",
        "Rosanna: If those flowers are for me, you can leave them at the front \r\ndesk. I'm leaving tomorrow.",
        "Carly: Well, you can enjoy them tonight. Can I come in? You probably \r\nwant to sit down, anyway. Although, from what I remember, it's the getting up \r\nand down that's the most difficult.",
        "Rosanna: From what you remember?",
        "Carly: From childbirth.",
        "Rosanna: I suspect this is slightly different.",
        "Carly: Yeah. What I meant --",
        "Rosanna: Look, I don't have time for you to make nice, Carly. So, \r\nplease go. You know, I have to get organized. I have a very busy day tomorrow.",
        "Carly: Get organized? Why? All you're gonna do is lay on a couch and \r\norder room service.",
        "Rosanna: Actually, I'm going to sit with Craig and make some plans. And \r\nI'm very much looking forward to it. But it's going to take a little energy. So \r\nif you don't mind --",
        "Carly: You and Craig making plans? Well, that sounds like you guys have \r\nmade things official. Congrats.",

        "Carpenter: Mr. Montgomery, as much as we'd like to accommodate --",
        "Craig: I'll tell you what. You get the ramps in by the end of the week, \r\nI'll double your money.",
        "Carpenter: We'll let you know.",
        "Katie: Oh, I always wondered what this place looked like on the inside.",

        "Margo: Before you do something?",

        "Isaac: What's wrong? I'm not blind. I can see it in your face.",
        "Ben: Bob reassigned Travers' case to Hector Ramirez.",
        "Isaac: Good. Hope ol' Hector drops him on his head.",
        "Ben: Travers is telling everybody that I tried to kill him.",

        "Ben: Of course not.",
        "Isaac: Then let it go.",
        "Ben: Look, I can't. First, he seduces Jessica and he throws it in my \r\nface. And now he's trying to ruin my career.",
        "Isaac: And let's not forget he's being brought up on charges for \r\nsquirreling around with James Steinbeck. He lost his job. He's on his way out. \r\nThis is a short-term problem. Just play it cool, and it will all take care of \r\nitself.",
        "Ben: Oh, yeah. That's what Jessica said.",
        "Isaac: So you've been talking to Jessica?",
        "Ben: Yeah. She gave me some legal advice.",

        "Isaac: You think she's working you?",
        "Ben: How do you mean?",
        "Isaac: Maybe her and Travers are planning some malpractice suit to \r\nbring you down.",
        "Ben: Come on, man, that's crazy.",
        "Isaac: Then what's there not to trust? I mean, you just said she was a \r\ntop-notch attorney.",

        "Jessica: I've been in touch with child welfare in Teresina.",
        "Marshall: Brazil? How did you know?",
        "Jessica: That night on the dock. I overheard Steinbeck say your \r\ndaughter was in Teresina. So Margo and I've been trying to locate her.",
        "Marshall: You won't find her.",
        "Jessica: Well, we haven't found her yet. But Teresina's a big city. And \r\nthe agency there is very hopeful.",
        "Marshall: Yeah, they all are. But I could have told you it's useless to \r\ngo through official channels.",
        "Jessica: Well, I know there's a lot of red tape, but there are still a \r\nfew good people who are --",
        "Marshall: They're all good. But their hands are tied. All right, \r\nbelieve me, I tried. When I thought that Zara was in Buenos Aires, I turned the \r\nagency there upside-down. It didn't do any good.",
        "Jessica: So, what do you suggest?",
        "Marshall: I have to go there myself. I'd be there right now if it \r\nweren't for Ben Harris' mistake. Bob Hughes's word, not mine.",
        "Jessica: Ben Harris saved your life.",
        "Marshall: I know why you're here, Jessica. My daughter was just an \r\nexcuse. You're here to defend Ben Harris.",
        "Jessica: I don't need to defend Ben. He didn't do anything wrong. Now, \r\nthat artery might have been weakened by the original injury. So don't embarrass \r\nyourself by accusing Ben of something you can't prove. It just makes you look \r\nsmall. And do not smile at me when I'm angry.",
        "Marshall: You know, if you were really angry, you'd be slamming out \r\nthat door right now. But you're not. Why is that, counselor?",
        "Jessica: Because I want to talk about you and me.",

        "Margo: Craig, you would be marrying Rosanna for her money.",
        "Katie: And you've been there, done that.",

        "Katie: And while Barbara's Barbara --",
        "Margo: Rosanna's worse.",
        "Katie: Craig, she's cold and manipulative and sneaky.",
        "Margo: And ruthless and calculating and cold.",
        "Craig: She's not that cold, trust me.",
        "Katie: Okay, so she's great in the sack. But your daughter hates her.",
        "Craig: No, \"hate\" is kind of a strong word. Lucy and I have been \r\nthrough a lot together. And I think she has a more open mind about it.",
        "Katie: What, since she lost half her memory?",
        "Craig: Rosanna has changed.",
        "Katie: From what? A weasel to a ferret?",

        "Katie: Don't do it.",
        "Margo: Don't do it!",
        "Katie: Exactly. Well, now that we have that all settled, what are we \r\ndoing in Barbara Ryan's house?",
        "Craig: It's my house. I bought it this morning.",
        "Margo: Well, so much for asking our advice before you do something \r\nstupid.",
        "Katie: Craig, you're gonna starve without room service.",
        "Margo: And let's not forget all the cozy, homey memories like James \r\ntrying to kill you in the basement.",
        "Craig: He's in jail. And I am hiring a staff. This -- this house is for \r\nLucy. She can't go back to the Lakeview. She's confined enough in a wheelchair. \r\nAnd here we have space for all of her equipment and rehab exercises. We can do \r\nthe whole east wing with rings and mats and -- she'll have every advantage she \r\nwould have had in Montega.",
        "Katie: Oh, you owe me five bucks.",
        "Margo: No, no, he just mentioned Montega.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but he's competing with Sierra.",
        "Margo: No, it's not the same thing.",
        "Katie: Speaking of -- if you want to get married so badly, why don't \r\nyou marry Sierra?",
        "Craig: Not an option.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Craig: Because whatever we were, we are not now.",
        "Katie: But if it's about buying a bigger house --",
        "Craig: I don't need Sierra to buy me a house, or Rosanna or anybody \r\nelse, for that matter.",
        "Katie: We're not talking about Rosanna anymore. Weren't you listening?",
        "Craig: Yes. Ruthless, manipulative, cold. Cold she is not always. And \r\nruthless and manipulative -- have you noticed how Cabot Motors doubled their \r\nprofits in the last three years?",
        "Margo: Uh-oh.",
        "Katie: He's defending her.",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Craig: And what good are you two? I asked you over here to talk me out \r\nof this, not into it.",
        "Katie: Okay. Fine, let's start over.",
        "Margo: Okay. Okay. Craig, we accept that you respect Rosanna because of \r\nher business acumen.",
        "Katie: And that she's not cold.",
        "Margo: But you gotta give us just one good reason why you want to make \r\nher your wife.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's good. I like that. One good reason why you would want \r\nto marry that -- Rosanna.",
        "Craig: I don't want to get married.",

        "",
        "Rosanna: Actually, you know -- don't -- fine. I should thank you.",
        "Carly: Thank me for what?",
        "Rosanna: Your little pre-wedding indiscretion with Craig. For whatever \r\nreason, he told me about it. You know, once he made that choice, once he was \r\nhonest with me, our whole relationship changed. There's a wonderful openness \r\nbetween us now. In fact, we're closer together than ever.",
        "Carly: Well, good. I mean that. I am -- I'm happy for ya. For both of \r\nyou.",
        "Rosanna: What is going on here? Flowers, girl talk? What's next? Should \r\nwe go get a pedicure? Perhaps have a sleep-over?",
        "Carly: I don't think a sleep-over's really in the cards for us.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Monte Carlo isn't, either. So if that's what you're \r\nangling for -- another chance -- you can just forget it. You knew the terms of \r\nthe contract. You signed it. You broke it. The fact that Craig and I are closer \r\ntogether is irrelevant.",
        "Carly: I'm -- I'm not here to talk about Monte Carlo, Rosanna. I've \r\naccepted your decision. It's over. In fact, I've even told Jack that I quit.",
        "Rosanna: And he believed you?",
        "Carly: It was the best way to keep him from asking questions.",
        "Rosanna: He's a detective. He knows about the non-fraternization \r\nclause. He's gonna figure it out.",
        "Carly: No, he won't. The situation has changed. Jack and I got some \r\nreally good news. And he's so absorbed in this news that Monte Carlo is the last \r\nthing on his mind.",
        "Rosanna: So you come here with flowers and girl talk and good wishes \r\nfor Craig and no interest in Monte Carlo?",
        "Carly: I didn't say I had no interest. I said that I'd accepted the \r\nsituation.",
        "Rosanna: Which has apparently changed because of your \"good news\"?",
        "Carly: Yes. The good news. Jack and I -- we just found out we're gonna \r\nhave a baby.",

        "Marshall: You and me? Whatever could you mean?",
        "Jessica: Do you want me to spell it out for you? Okay. Well, we were \r\nsexually intoxicated for a moment. But -- and before that, facing off in the \r\ncourtroom, in the polls -- that was a different kind of excitement. But there \r\nwas more, too.",
        "Marshall: You mean, other than the mental sparring and the sexual \r\npyrotechnics? What?",
        "Jessica: You told me you loved me.",
        "Marshall: And I got slapped for it.",
        "Jessica: Well, that was because I didn't want to hear it at the time, \r\nespecially since it seemed to be true.",
        "Marshall: But then again, maybe I was just being arrogant.",
        "Jessica: No, you're always arrogant. But -- not this time. It was \r\nhonest. Simple. You meant it. You loved me.",
        "Marshall: Still do.",

        "Mike: Go.",
        "Jack: Okay. Parker's got an open invitation at John's, or Hal's, if \r\nJohn can't handle it. And the baby's not due for, what, another eight months or \r\nso? So I was thinking, now's the time before life gets too complicated.",
        "Mike: And it will.",
        "Jack: Right. So while we still have this time --",
        "Molly: Time for what?",
        "Mike: All I know is Jack's got some brilliant idea. And if he ever \r\nstops patting himself on the back for it, he might tell us what it is.",
        "Molly: He just made fun of you. Well, I'm all for brilliant ideas. \r\nWhat's up?",
        "Jack: Well, as you know, Carly and I took a little detour while we were \r\ngetting married. We made it to the \"I dos,\" but we never quite made it to the \r\nhoneymoon part. And I was thinking, now that J.J.'s back with his folks --",
        "Molly: It's fabulous! Jack!",
        "Mike: Okay. Okay! Why are you kissing him like that?",
        "Molly: Because he's taking -- he's taking Carly on a honeymoon! Isn't \r\nthat great? It's great. Where? Because I know, at one point in time, you were \r\nthinking about a cabin in the mountains. But, Jack, it's freezing. And she's \r\nbeen changing diapers for a month. I think she needs a little pampering.",
        "Jack: How's Cancun sound?",

        "Craig: Is everything about sex with you? It not just turns me on. It's \r\nrevealing. When she loses control, I see what matters to her.",
        "Katie: Okay. So you're just going to marry this woman -- this emotional \r\ncripple who's so controlled that you have to decode every temper tantrum she has \r\nto figure out what's going on with her?",

When the kid's got chicken \r\npox, you take a turn by the tub. When the kid's in the school play, well, you -- \r\nyou make sure the lines are learned. I'll make the costume.",

        "Carly: I'm not suggesting that we shouldn't have boundaries. Maybe we \r\ncould skip the fourth of July. But I do want this child to have more from you \r\nthan the occasional birthday present. I want the baby to light up whenever you \r\nenter a room. I want the baby to race Parker to the phone whenever you call, to \r\nrun to the door whenever you show up.",
