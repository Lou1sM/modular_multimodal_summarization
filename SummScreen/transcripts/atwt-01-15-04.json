        "Emma: Well, you can't get in because Holden changed the locks.",
        "Mitzi: Oh, that's a good idea. With everything happening lately, you know, better safe than sorry. Would there happen to be an extra key? 'Cause I'm a little chilly out here.",
        "Emma: Mitzi, maybe I didn't make myself clear. Holden changed the locks because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: As soon as Barbara's confession is admitted into the record, I'm gonna follow up on having those charges dropped against you.",
        "Newman: It's still not too late to have your confession thrown out. Given your history, I can make a case for mental instability.",

        "Tom: It points to a new suspect in the killing of Rose D'Angelo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I wasn't really watching where I was going. I was kind of in a hurry to find you.",

        "Katie: No, you didn't ruin anything. You couldn't. It was too perfect.",
        "Mike: When we were together, there was just this communication. Like this understanding. Now I'm ruining it by talking about it, aren't I?",
        "Katie: No. It's good to talk about things. Actually, I want to talk to you about something, too. Um -- could we wait till after breakfast, though? I'm kinda hungry.",

        "Aaron: Hey, Chris. Ah, you wouldn't happen to know where Ali is, would you?",
        "Chris: Ah, no. You'd have to check with the nursing supervisor.",
        "Aaron: Look, man, I know it's been tough for you. But I didn't know the whole story myself.",
        "Chris: Its okay, Aaron. Forget it.",
        "Aaron: Really?",
        "Chris: Yeah, look. I know I didn't have any right to yell at Alison the way that I did. Well, you're her husband. Okay, I don't blame you for protecting her.",
        "Aaron: Okay, what about the rest of it?",
        "Chris: Look, I know I said some pretty bad things about you guys being parents, okay? I'm sorry. What do I know? Okay, maybe you guys'll be just fine. Look, I gotta go see a patient. Good luck to both of you.",
        "Aaron: She lied to me again.",

        "Lucy: Shouldn't you be going?",
        "Craig: Yeah, in a minute, sweetness. I'm just -- um -- this tie -- I'm thinking about changing it. Do you like it? Should I change?",
        "Lucy: No, I think its fine.",
        "Craig: Yeah?",
        "Lucy: Well, I'll be right back.",
        "Clark: Okay.",
        "Craig: Lucy -- has Clark ever seen the tower?",
        "Clark: No, but I'd love to.",
        "Craig: Huh? Well, how about that? Why don't you give him the grand tour?",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "Craig: Huh?",
        "Lucy: It's this way.",
        "Craig: All right, hurry. Get out of here before they come back. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Annabelle: You gonna be taking care of my situation while I'm gone?",
        "Craig: I am working on your situation as we speak. By the time you get back from Singapore, your legal problems will be over.",
        "Annabelle: Well, they'd better be. You got some vodka? I usually need some help before I fly.",
        "Craig: I'm sure you do. If you hurry, you can have a little popsky at the airport bar. There you go. Bad voyage! Don't forget not to write.",
        "Craig: Mitzi?",
        "Lucy: You're still here? What happened to your cab?",
        "Craig: Yeah, change of plans, sweetness. I'm gonna drive to -- to work. But Cabot is sleeping. Would you tell Phyllis to check on him and listen to him on the monitor, okay?",

        "Lucy: Well, we have a test in a few hours. And we really should start studying.",
        "Clark: So, why don't we study here? Your parents are gone. Your brother is sleeping. We have the whole place to ourselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Your honor, this is absurd. How can there be another suspect when I've already confessed?",
        "Judge: Ms. Ryan, please sit down.",
        "Newman: Your honor, I'm gonna need some time to review these papers.",
        "Judge: You and me both, Mr. Newman. Pending my review of these documents, this court is adjourned without prejudice, for 24 hours.",
        "[Gavel pounds]",
        "Barbara: What do they say?",
        "Newman: It's something about computer files.",
        "Paul: I don't understand. Barbara's free to go?",
        "Jessica: No, no. She's still under arrest. I'm gonna find out what's going on here.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, I don't understand why you're so unhappy. If there's another suspect that means you could get off.",
        "Barbara: If I had wanted to get off, I wouldn't have confessed.",
        "Jennifer: I'll hang around in case you need me.",
        "Hal: Did you know anything about this?",
        "Barbara: Obviously, it's a mistake. I poisoned Rose. That's why we're here. You haven't told Will about my confession yet, have you?",
        "Hal: I told you that I would wait until after the hearing. I even kept him home from school today, to stop him from hearing about it from another classmate.",
        "Barbara: Good, good, good. I want to tell him. I want to be the one, but -- I want to speak to Lynn Michaels first, so I know how to put it.",
        "Hal: I can ask her to visit you.",
        "Barbara: Well, we're in recess. Can't I please call?",
        "Hal: Make it quick.",
        "Barbara: I'd really like to sit down somewhere and gather my thoughts a little bit.",
        "Hal: Jack? See if the judge has left his chambers. If he has, let Barbara in there to make a call.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Jack: This way.",
        "Jack: It's empty. Go ahead.",
        "Carly: So, what do you think now?",
        "Jack: About Tom's papers? Well, I have to see them first.",
        "Carly: No. About Mitzi as the killer.",
        "Jack: I thought you were over this.",
        "Carly: Tom said there's another suspect. Its Mitzi, Jack. It's gotta be, and I'm going to prove it. Believe me, you'll thank me later.",
        "Jack: Carly -- Carly!",
        "Lucinda: Well, you certainly got everybody's attention, pussycat. Rose would be proud of you. I am, too. All right, give me a call. Call me.",
        "Lily: Thanks.",
        "Paul: See, this is all part of her big plan. There'll be confusion. There'll be distractions. And Barbara's gonna figure out a way to get off.",
        "Jennifer: She told me she didn't even want to get off.",
        "Rosanna: I think we just have to relax, here. I think we have to find out what's in those papers first.",
        "Paul: Oh, no. No way. I'm not getting sucked into Barbara's game. I don't care what kind of so-called evidence you've got. Barbara confessed. I can't imagine what else you would need.",
        "Jessica: Making a scene is not gonna be productive.",
        "Dusty: You act like you got us beat. Didn't you know we got proof now?",
        "Tom: Dusty, stay out of it.",
        "Paul: What's he talking about? Did all this come from him?",
        "Jessica: You and I need to talk.",
        "Paul: Why? What's going on here?",
        "Lily: How can you just stand there and pretend to be innocent? It was all premeditated, Paul, and we have proof now. Your mother is not going to pay for what you did to Rose. You are going to pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: These are the sites that were logged onto from your computer. They all contain information about using methanol as a poison.",
        "Dusty: Got you, Paul.",
        "Paul: You two are out of your minds. I didn't kill Rose, all right?! So there's no way that they're gonna be able to prove it!",
        "Rosanna: Jessica, can you tell us what's in those documents?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter, Rosanna. It's all lies.",
        "Dusty: Oh, it's gonna matter, when they decide to execute you, believe me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh.",
        "Paul: You know what really gets me? The three of us want to avenge Rose's death. But you two are so blind, so single-mindedly blaming me that you're going to let the real killer go free.",
        "Hal: Jen, will you check the judge's chambers? Your mother is in their making a phone call.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Paul: You think you two have an exclusive on loving Rose? On missing her now that she's gone? You don't. She was gonna be my wife. I was gonna love her every minute for the rest of my life.",
        "Dusty: Your love was a lie. You're lying right now by saying you didn't murder her.",
        "Paul: Listen to me! Barbara poisoned Rose, and now she's figured out a way to get away with it.",
        "Jennifer: Dad, Mom wasn't in the chambers. I think she's left the building.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I'll be in the living room.",
        "Emily: Uh, you know what your Dad said, sweetie.",
        "Will: Yeah, no TV.",
        "Emily: So why don't you hang out in here with me.",
        "Will: What is he hiding from me?",
        "Emily: Your father isn't hiding anything from you. He just wants to discuss something with you later.",
        "Will: That's the same thing! Is this about Paul?",
        "Emily: You know what? Why don't you hang out with me and help me bake the pie? You know, it always tastes better when you make it with somebody else. [Buzzing sound] Oh, that's the dryer. I'm gonna go take care of that. You think about it, okay? Where did you get this?",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Emily: Did your Mother give this to you?",
        "Will: Give it back!",
        "Emily: No, I asked you a question, Will.",
        "Will: Yes, she did.",
        "Emily: Well, you know the rules. No contact with your mother unless it's supervised.",
        "Will: Those rules suck! She loves me more than anyone!",
        "Emily: I'm not going to have this argument with you, Will.",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. That's all you and Dad ever do is boss me around.",
        "Emily: Will, would you get -- Will, get down here?!",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Barbara: I need to see Will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: You sure that's what Holden wanted? I mean, maybe there's some way I can get in touch with him.",
        "Emma: Mitzi, Holden doesn't want to talk to you. And from what he's told me, neither do I. So if you'll excuse me, I'm sorry.",
        "Craig: What are you doing here, Mitzi? How come you're not at Rose's?",
        "Mitzi: I've been officially uninvited, all right? They changed the locks on me.",
        "Craig: 'Cause of Paul Ryan?",
        "Mitzi: Yeah. Remember, you had me lie to Lily about Paul poisoning Rose's champagne.",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah. You have nothing to complain about. You were well compensated, morally and monetarily, for all your efforts.",
        "Mitzi: Yeah, well, I haven't seen the monetary part yet.",
        "Craig: Well, here. This completes our transaction.",
        "Mitzi: The feeling is mutual. Just in case you were wondering, I'm not leaving Oakdale.",
        "Craig: Oh, why not?",
        "Mitzi: I'm using this to buy the Roller Palace, and I'm gonna show Lily and you, everyone else in this bird I can take care of myself.",
        "Craig: Oh, Mitzi, the beauty business is ugly.",
        "Carly: Well, well, isn't this cozy? I should have known you two would hook up eventually. Bottom feeding is so much more fun with company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay. This doesn't mean I love you any less.",
        "Mike: I thought I heard you in here.",
        "Katie: Hey, you're supposed to be in bed.",
        "Mike: I just -- I thought we'd be a little better off in the kitchen.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Mike: 'Cause last night was beautiful. I just -- I don't want to push things too much this morning, that's all.",
        "Katie: Oh, I didn't think we were.",
        "Mike: Well, you're acting a little weird.",
        "Katie: Okay, so you noticed.",
        "Mike: Well, it's kind of hard -- you took your wedding ring off.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Last night.",
        "Mike: How's that feel?",
        "Katie: Naked, but not in a bad way.",
        "Mike: Good. I'm glad to hear it.",
        "Katie: Well, that's not the only thing you need to hear. Oh, I want to say it, but I just --",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Katie: I want it to be so special.",
        "Mike: Hey, everything you do is special. Just spell it out.",

        "Mitzi: Thanks anyway. I'll read it in the newspaper.",
        "Craig: Well, what happened at Barbara Ryan's hearing?",
        "Carly: Tom Hughes says there's another suspect.",
        "Craig: Even after Barbara confessed?",
        "Carly: The judge called a recess so she could go over the evidence. But if it's not Barbara, who else on earth could it be?",
        "Mitzi: Your husband's a cop. Why don't you ask him?",
        "Craig: Rosanna was at the hearing. I think I'll check with her. Ladies --",
        "Mitzi: Hey, Craig, you know what? I could use a ride into town. He heard me.",
        "Carly: The whole neighborhood heard you, Mitzi. So what's with the suitcase?",
        "Mitzi: I've been kicked out of Rosie's place. Happy?",
        "Carly: No, but it is a start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Great work, Hal, really. Great work. She should have been handcuffed the moment that she confessed.",
        "Hal: Relax, Paul. Barbara will be found.",
        "Rosanna: Look, don't worry about it, okay? Like he said, they'll find her. She'll pay for what she's done. We just have to relax and wait it out. Now come on, let's go get a cup of coffee or something, okay?",
        "Jessica: Paul, wait a minute. We need to talk about this new evidence.",
        "Paul: You have got to be kidding. Are we going to take this seriously?",
        "Jessica: Yes, we are.",
        "Paul: Okay, fine. Go ahead, tell me, what's it all about. What's going on?",
        "Jessica: I don't think you want to do this here.",
        "Paul: Why not? I've got nothing to hide.",
        "Jessica: I would strongly advise against it.",
        "Dusty: I don't know, Jessica, maybe you should listen to your client on this one.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I have to agree. I'd like to see his reaction.",
        "Paul: Jessica, it's fine, really. Go ahead.",
        "Jessica: The police went through your computer. They found several files containing information downloaded from the internet.",
        "Paul: I'm often on the internet. I didn't know that was a crime.",
        "Jessica: These are the sites that were logged onto from your computer. They all contain information about using methanol as a poison.",

        "Emily: Maybe you should have thought of that before you -- what are you doing here, anyway? Shouldn't you be in court?",
        "Barbara: The hearing was postponed.",
        "Emily: Well, then why aren't you in jail?",
        "Barbara: I have a very good lawyer.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, no lawyer's that good, believe -- oh, my God, you escaped.",

        "Barbara: Hal told me he kept him home from school today, Emily.",
        "Emily: Okay, all right, all right. Just calm down, okay? Because if you really did escape, for God's sake, keep him out of this.",
        "Barbara: I will take that under advisement. Will, I need to speak --",
        "Emily: He can't hear you, all right? He's listening to music on his headphones. So just leave him alone.",
        "Barbara: Well, then, I'm going upstairs.",
        "Emily: The only way you're going up those stairs is if you go through me, lady.",
        "Will: Hey! What's going on? Mom, is that you?",

        "Mike: How long were we in there?",
        "Katie: At least 40,000 gallons worth I'm sure. But it was worth it. You know, you give great shower. Did I mention that I love you?",
        "Mike: I don't know. You know, I had a lot of water in my ears. I'm not sure I heard.",
        "Katie: Well, I might have to say it again. I do. I love you, Mike Kasnoff.",
        "Mike: I love you, too. I love you. All right, it's a big decision. Do we have some breakfast, or do we go to sleep?",
        "Katie: Mm. Go back to asleep, okay?",
        "Mike: Okay.",
        "Katie: Sweet dreams.",

        "Emma: Well, you're welcome for the coffee, but you did most of the talking. It seems like it was quite a scene down there in the court this morning, yeah?",
