        "Holden: Lily, I asked you a question. What are those?",
        "Lily: Jade's been taking them. She calls them vitamins. She thought it might help me with my -- don't.",
        "Holden: These aren't vitamins. They're diet pills. Why did you lie to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Where is my son?",
        "Craig: What is wrong with you? How the hell should I know?",
        "Emily: Because you took him!",
        "Craig: That is a very serious accusation.",
        "Emily: You warned me that you would get revenge. You think I don't know this is it?",
        "Craig: Emily, I told you, I want nothing more to do with you. And this little display only reinforces that decision.",
        "Emily: Please. You've been waiting for the opportunity to put me through the same hell you've been in ever since Lucy ran off with Johnny. So you just came up with the right thing, didn't you?",
        "Craig: Go fixate on someone else, and leave me alone.",
        "Emily: Don't you dare. Don't you dare. You're not going anywhere. You tell me where my son is, or I swear to God, Craig, I will kill you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Tom screams]",
        "Margo: Tom! Honey? Baby, answer me! Answer me! Tom! Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Oh, god, where is it? Oh my God. Okay. I need an ambulance. I need an ambulance at 724 Pinewood Lane. My husband. My husband has collapsed. He -- no, he's unconscious! I think it's a heart attack. I can't get a pulse! Tom! You stay with me, Baby. Stay with me, Baby. Stay with me. Stay with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Well, good to know the American justice system is still honoring the whole innocent until proven guilty thing.",
        "Dallas: Listen, Henry. Nobody, and I mean nobody, believes that you're innocent, all right? We all know that you helped Simon Frasier skip town.",
        "Henry: Excuse me? The man attacked me, all right? He left me tied to my car to rot. Have you seen my eye?",
        "Dallas: Listen, save it. Save it.",
        "Henry: I was lucky to escape with my life. I was.",
        "Dallas: Save it. Okay? Will you get out of here, please? Your bail's been posted.",
        "Henry: Really? I don't know anyone with that kind of money. No one that actually likes me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Prince Adolpho: Why did you have my motorcade redirected?",
        "Jack: I wanted to talk to you.",
        "Prince Adolpho: You could have left word for me at the consulate.",
        "Jack: An official matter like this, I thought it'd be best if we dealt with this in person.",
        "Prince Adolpho: Or perhaps you thought delaying my arrival would put a stop to your ex-wife's interrogation.",
        "Jack: Yes, about that. I've got some concerns about the way the situation is being handled.",
        "Prince Adolpho: No need to worry, Detective. It's being dealt with as it would be in my country.",
        "Jack: Only we're not in your country, your highness. And I've got a big problem with the way your officials are questioning a U.S. Citizen, one who is in that room without proper representation.",
        "Prince Adolpho: I don't like what you're implying.",
        "Jack: I want access to Carly. I want to be in that room when she's being questioned.",
        "Prince Adolpho: Absolutely not. You have no right to expect special treatment in this case.",
        "Jack: Then like I said, we've got a problem, Sir. And unless you want me to bring Washington in on this, I suggest that you start coming up with a nice diplomatic resolution. You've got five minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Simon, I can't believe you're here. I'd given up hope.",
        "Simon: Come on, you think I'd leave you alone after everything we've been through? No way. I am so sorry. You must have been terrified.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I am. I still am. Simon, you knocked out a royal guard. Aren't we in enough trouble here?",
        "Simon: Well, it's not like I had a choice.",
        "Carly: All right. You just get me the hell out of here, and I'll forgive you.",
        "Simon: Let's go.",
        "Vienna: You rat. You weren't planning on leaving without me, were you?",
        "Carly: Simon? What is she --?",
        "Simon: I was about to come looking for you. Where have you been?",
        "Vienna: You told me to go look for the guard, and it took some time.",
        "Simon: Oh, Honey. I was starting to get worried, though.",
        "Vienna: Oh, right. But luckily for you, you have Carly here to distract you.",
        "Simon: All right, listen, listen. You have to help me get her out of here. Take me to that passageway you were telling me about and once we're out of here safely, we'll get the codes out of her and you and I are off to that island we talked about.",
        "Vienna: Do you think I'm stupid? Simon Frasier, you've lied to me for the very last time.",
        "Simon: No, Vienna, please, listen to me.",
        "Vienna: No, no. Never again. I see very clearly what is going on here. You were not planning to go with me, you were planning to run off with her.",
        "Simon: No. No, I swear to you, no! Look, you have put yourself on the line for me. I am not going to break your heart after that.",
        "Vienna: You've said that before. I shouldn't have believed you then. And I'd be a fool to believe you now.",
        "Simon: Okay, so believe this. All I want to do is disappear with you, the money and the jewels and leave Carly far behind.",
        "Vienna: Okay, fine. Leave her behind and go with me now.",
        "Simon: No, Sweetie, I can't. I can't. Not until I get the security code to the safety deposit box out of her.",
        "Vienna: Okay, fine. Leave her with me. I'll get it out of her. And when I do, you're going to leave her right here and let the guard decide what to do with her.",
        "Simon: Okay, that is very tempting, but we can't just ditch her here. We can't leave her here alone.",
        "Vienna: Why not?",
        "Simon: What's to stop her from telling the prince what we've done or Jack for that matter? She does that, we are never going to be able to leave this country.",
        "Vienna: Okay, so we silence her and make sure she can't talk or run to anybody for help.",
        "Simon: Baby, come on, that wasn't part of the plan.",
        "Vienna: Baby, that's the plan now. If you don't want me to blow you out of the water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm looking at the big picture here, and what I see is that this could turn into more trouble for you than it's worth.",
        "Prince Adolpho: How so?",
        "Jack: You have Leonian officials in there questioning an American citizen. One who does not have a lawyer.",
        "Prince Adolpho: No one is going to question my need for discretion.",
        "Jack: But if those officials question her in a way that may be misconstrued as inappropriate, they might just question that. I'd hate to see some stolen diamonds turn into a rather embarrassing situation for your country.",
        "Prince Adolpho: All right. You want access to the prisoner? Done.",
        "Jack: Excellent. After you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Your personal belongings.",
        "Henry: Hey, I'm starting to get quite a collection of these.",
        "Dallas: I don't think I need to tell you not to leave town.",
        "Henry: I know the drill. I promise to comply.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Henry: Well, look at this. You, me, a police station. It seems like old times. Why'd you do it?",
        "Katie: Oh, I had all that royalty money from \"Oakdale Confidential\" just sitting in the bank, I had to do something with it. Besides, I thought Maddie could use a break.",
        "Henry: I don't come cheap. It must've cost you a pretty penny.",
        "Katie: Every last one. But you're worth it.",
        "Henry: Really? After what I did? I mean, helping you know who flee you know what to get to you know who else?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know, I know. I've thought a lot about that. But mostly I thought about what you said to me. How you always tried to see something more in me, but now you aren't really sure if it was ever really there.",
        "Henry: Yeah, that was kind of harsh.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it was kind of true. Listen, I don't agree with what you did, but I do understand why you did it.",
        "Henry: Can you help me understand it, then? Because I can't see it and that has nothing to do with the eye.",
        "Katie: He's your friend, Henry. I should have never expected you to turn your back on him, not even for me. It wasn't fair. And I almost lost you because of it and I never, ever want that to happen again. I've lost way too much because of -- you know who.",
        "Henry: You are never going to lose me, Bubbles.",
        "Katie: Good. Because I expect you to pay me back.",
        "Henry: Not with interest, I hope.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no, no. Just something along the lines of the average credit card, 18%-20%.",
        "Henry: Ah.",
        "Dallas: Katie, something came in I think you'd want to know about. An ambulance called to your sister's house.",
        "Katie: Was there an accident? Is Margo okay?",
        "Dallas: It's not for her, it's for Tom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: In here! In here! I've been doing compressions, but I can't get a pulse!",
        "EMT #1: We'll take it from here.",
        "Margo: You got to shock him. You got to shock him! Would you listen to me? You got to shock him!",
        "EMT #1: Can you tell me what happened? I need you to talk to me.",
        "Margo: My husband just found out that his son was missing, and he wanted to go out looking for him. He wanted to drive. I didn't want him to drive and I took the keys out of his hand and he reacted as if his hand had been cut with a knife and then he just collapsed.",
        "EMT #1: Does your husband have a history of heart disease or high blood pressure?",
        "Margo: No. No.",
        "EMT #2: I've got a pulse. It's thready, but it's here. We got to move him.",
        "Margo: Tom!",
        "EMT #2: Come on, on my count. One, two, three.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I do not know where Daniel is. I didn't take him.",
        "Emily: My son is a smart boy, Craig. He knows not to get into a car with a stranger. It had to have been you.",
        "Craig: Well, it wasn't. So please leave me alone or I'll have to call security.",
        "Emily: It was at Java. Did you know that? You knew that, right? You see a witness called and said that a little boy matching Daniel's description was forced into somebody's car.",
        "Craig: A car like mine? I guess not. And did this someone who saw this other person take the child, did that person actually look remotely like me?",
        "Emily: It had to have been you. You had somebody do it for you, because that's what you do. You had me running all over town doing your dirty work for months.",
        "Craig: When you weren't doing Dusty's bidding? Lucy took my son, and what did you do? Oh yeah, you and Dusty kept me from going after them by trying to throw me in jail. So I hope you'll forgive my lack of concern now that you're in the same situation.",
        "Emily: You're the only one who would do something this sick.",
        "Craig: Really? Have you talked to Paul lately? You might want to start with him. It wouldn't be the first time that he kept a child from his mother. Oh, but you knew that. You helped him do it.",
        "Emily: I hate you.",
        "Craig: Please, hate me! And remember, the next time that you're struck with the urge to seek me out, don't. I mean it, Emily. You stay away from me. I sold my share of the paper. You're Tull's problem now.",
        "Emily: Tull -- you told me that I would be sorry if I didn't sell my shares to him.",
        "Craig: That's right. Consider it my parting advice.",
        "Emily: No, it was a threat! Only I didn't see it, it was a threat. You had Tull take my son? Where?",
        "Craig: Good night, Emily.",
        "Emily: You don't want to tell me? You tell it to the police.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You had to know that these were a bad idea, otherwise you wouldn't have told me that they were vitamins. And why would you take diet advice from Jade, of all people?",
        "Lily: Jade was just trying to help. She knows I've been upset about my weight.",
        "Holden: There's nothing wrong with the way you look.",
        "Lily: And that's part of the problem. Don't -- right there.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: You kind of overkill with the compliments. It's wonderful and it's sweet, but I feel like you're being pressured to be the one to make me feel better.",
        "Holden: Okay, that pressure, it comes because I don't want to see you be so hard on yourself.",
        "Lily: I'm used to looking a certain way. I'm having a very hard time adjusting to the person I see in the mirror.",
        "Holden: Well, these are not the answer. Have you read the label? Do you know if there are any side effects?",
        "Lily: No, Holden.",
        "Holden: Well, let's have a look. Shall we? May cause irritability. Hm, that might explain why you snapped at Lucinda.",
        "Lily: I don't need a pill to be irritated with my mother. That's a joke.",
        "Holden: Not funny. Is that what these do to you?",
        "Lily: It's a very small price to pay to be able to fit into my clothes, feel attractive.",
        "Holden: You are attractive.",
        "Lily: I'm a supermodel, that's what I am. Mm-hm. You said it yourself. You saw me. You said I looked thinner. You said it looked good on me. Admit it.",
        "Holden: Have I ever said that I think you need to lose weight?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Holden: That's because I don't think that. And I don't want to see you risk your health just to try and make me happy.",
        "Lily: I'm not doing this for you! I'm doing this for me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Back so soon? And alone? I guess you didn't find my children.",
        "Dusty: You don't seem surprised. I guess that's because when I left for Montega, you had me followed.",
        "Craig: Now why would I do that?",
        "Dusty: Mess things up, I guess.",
        "Craig: I wouldn't interfere with your search.",
        "Dusty: It didn't take me long to realize I was being followed, because the work was so sloppy. And then I realized you wanted it that way.",
        "Craig: Save your excuses for Barbara.",
        "Dusty: So if Lucy found out I was looking for her, she'd know you weren't far behind.",
        "Craig: Need I remind you, they're my children, not yours.",
        "Dusty: Thanks to you, Pal, they're gone.",
        "Craig: You know, you're the one who went after them, not me. So I wouldn't be so quick to point the finger. Maybe the person that Lucy doesn't want coming after her is you.",

        "[Knocking]",
        "Emily: Tom? Margo? Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Voicemail. What are you doing here?",
        "Cop: I was asked to swing by and make sure the house was locked up.",
        "Emily: Well, where are Tom and Margo?",
        "Cop: They're on their way to the hospital, Ma'am.",
        "Emily: The hospital? Is Daniel there? Is he hurt?",
        "Cop: No, its Detective Hughes' husband, Ma'am. He's had a heart attack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "EMT #1: Apparent heart attack. Been down ten minutes.",
        "EMT #2: Had to shock him in transit.",
        "Nurse #1: Call the cath lab.",
        "Bob: Margo, I just got the page.",
        "Margo: Bob, he's going to be fine. Tom's going to be just fine.",
        "Bob: Call the cath lab! Let's get labs drawn, aspirin and nitro.",
        "Orderly #1: He had aspirin in the field.",
        "Nurse #1: I'm running the cardiac enzymes now.",
        "Nurse #2: The rest of the labs are going up.",
        "Bob: Put him on the portable monitor so he's easier to move.",
        "Nurse #1: I'm on it.",
        "Bob: Okay.",
        "Nurse #1: Ma'am, perhaps it would be better if you waited outside.",
        "Margo: He's my husband. I am not waiting outside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Did they come up here? I don't see them anywhere.",
        "Henry: Katie --",
        "Katie: Oh my God. Have you ever seen them together, Henry? When they don't know anyone's watching them? Margo's always standing next to Tom, just kind of leaning against him. It's so -- and Tom always has his hand on the small of her back just like he's always there. I was at their house the other night for dinner and they were just standing in the kitchen like that, just standing together. Not even saying anything. And to see her in there like that, not able to lean against him, it's just so wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why is no one guarding her door?",
        "Prince Adolpho: Perhaps they've already started the interrogation. It's best we don't interrupt.",
        "Jack: She has no one in there to represent her. I think its best we do. Carly? Carly? What the hell's going on here? Where's Carly? Did you have her moved?",
        "Prince Adolpho: No. I instructed the guards to keep her here. I told them we were on our way, that we wanted to be present when she was questioned.",
        "Jack: Well, find her! Now! Or I will personally hand you that international incident you've been trying so hard to avoid.",
        "Prince Adolpho: Guard! The American woman who was being held in here, where is she?",
        "[Muffled cries]",
        "Jack: Wait, wait, wait. Do you hear that? It's coming from inside the crate. Help me with this. Come on. Help me with this. Get this thing open now. Carly? Carly, hold on, Babe.",
        "[Vienna is tied up in the crate]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Well, I must say, I have to hand it to Vienna.",
        "Carly: I thought we already did that.",
        "Simon: Yeah, your tackling skills, quite impressive.",
        "Carly: Remember, I am the mother of two boys who are crazy about football. No, I knew that Vienna had money, I just didn't realize that she had her own little plane here.",
        "Simon: Yeah, one phone call, it was all gassed up and ready to go.",
        "Carly: Yeah, ready to go where, exactly?",
        "Simon: Well, Sweetheart, wherever we want.",
        "Carly: Well, we better get there quick, because sooner or later, they're going to find the owner of this little getaway vehicle and they're going to let her out of that crate.",
        "Simon: Well, by that time, we are going to be long gone. All right, buckle up.",
        "Carly: What are you doing there?",
        "Simon: Oh, this? This thing is called a seatbelt.",
        "Carly: Yeah, right. I know. I think that's where the pilot sits.",
        "Simon: You really are quite perceptive, aren't you?",
        "Carly: Simon?",
        "Simon: Yes?",
        "Carly: Where's the pilot?",
        "Simon: Oh, yeah, you're looking at him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Vienna? Are you all right?",
        "Prince Adolpho: What happened?",
        "Vienna: I was assaulted and tied up and locked in that crate! Me in a crate! Oh, Dolly, it was awful!",
        "Prince Adolpho: What are you doing at the consulate? Last I heard, you were on a farm somewhere.",
        "Jack: Yeah, my family's farm. Don't ask. Vienna? You want to explain what's going on here, from the beginning, please?",
        "Vienna: Isn't it obvious? Simon and that hideous girlfriend of his tricked me!",
        "Jack: Tricked you how?",
        "Vienna: Simon came to me and told me he wanted me back. Of course, I laughed in his face! And he begged me, like any man would. And he told me he would promise me anything in the world, even the jewels he'd stolen.",
        "Jack: He admitted he stole them?",
        "Vienna: Yes! And that's why I went along with it, so I could get your jewels back, Dolly. He told me that Carly had the jewels in this safe deposit box and that we had to break her out of here so he could force her to tell the security code.",
        "Prince Adolpho: And you believed him? After everything he's done?",
        "Vienna: I had to take a chance. For you, Dolly.",
        "Jack: Did Carly know that Simon was coming?",
        "Vienna: No. I tried to stop them, but they knocked out the guard. Then they turned on me and put me in the crate, so they could escape.",
        "Prince Adolpho: At least this time you weren't wearing any jewels they could steal. Don't think for a second I believe you did any of this for me. Its Simon Frasier you want! This is all about him!",
        "Jack: Where were they headed? How were they planning on escaping, Vienna?",
        "Prince Adolpho: Vienna, answer the man's questions now!",
        "Vienna: I had a private jet outside the city waiting for us. I'm sure they went there. If they dared to take my plane, I want them both to be caught and beheaded!",
        "Jack: We really don't do that anymore. Hey, yeah, this is Snyder. I need an APB put out immediately for Carly Snyder and Simon Frasier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Carly, we have really got to get out of here right now. Can you please put your seatbelt on?",
        "Carly: Are you out of your mind? You can't fly this thing!",
        "Simon: Sure I can.",
        "Carly: No, don't touch anything. Do you even have a pilot's license?",
        "Simon: I did come this close to getting one.",
        "Carly: Oh boy.",
        "Simon: I had to drop out of flight school before the final exam. Listen, I have had plenty of practice runs.",
        "Carly: No, no. There are times that you are kind of funny. Now is not one of them. You have my life in your hands. I'd like to know exactly how many classes you actually attended.",
        "Simon: Enough to understand the basics, okay? Up, down, sky, land.",
        "Carly: Crash, burn.",

All the memories. All the pieces of the puzzle. They finally started being put back together, and I was on solid ground again. You were right. Except for one thing. I didn't feel comfortable in my own skin. I didn't understand this body that I'm in. And nothing that I do, what I eat or I don't eat, whatever it is, it's not changing. It's not changing.",

I just thought I would try them for maybe a week, maybe two, you know. Get things rolling and then go back to just diet and exercise. I miss who I used to be. I miss the way that I used to feel and look.",
