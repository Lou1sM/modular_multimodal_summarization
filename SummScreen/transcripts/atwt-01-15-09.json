        "Dusty: Thank you for watching Johnny while I meet with Tom.",
        "Josie: Oh, yeah, Johnny and I have a great time together, right? Well, we do.",
        "Dusty: He talks about you all the time when you're not around. You like Josie, don't you?",
        "Josie: Well, he's a great kid. Hey, don't worry, we'll find something super fun to do while your dad's in the meeting, okay?",
        "Dusty: He's been like this all day, right, Sweetheart? He doesn't want to open up about what's wrong.",
        "Josie: I'll talk to him.",
        "Dusty: Thanks. I better go.",
        "Josie: Hey, I'm really glad that you decided to work things out with Craig.",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm trying to keep my promise to Lucy. Let's see if Craig wants to do the same.",
        "Josie: Well, you've got the lawyers there to help you with the rough patches.",
        "Dusty: I hope so, but you know -- you never know with these lawyers.",
        "Josie: I thought you said Tom Hughes was fair.",
        "Dusty: He is. Very talented. If I were Craig, I'd be looking for a shark.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, I'm glad I ran into you.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, I'm meeting a client.",
        "Craig: What a coincidence. That's what I'd like to be.",
        "Tom: Excuse me?",
        "Craig: Dusty and I aren't making much progress on how to share responsibility for Johnny.",
        "Tom: Oh, so I've heard.",
        "Craig: And you know what family feuds can be like.",
        "Tom: Thanks to you, I do.",
        "Craig: Come on, I can't be the only relative you've ever fought with.",
        "Tom: No, you're the only one that I don't care to make peace with.",
        "Craig: I've earned that. But I also want to prove that I've changed.",
        "Tom: I'm on the edge of my seat.",
        "Craig: I have my son and I want him to be proud of me. And the last thing he needs is a war between me and Dusty Donovan. So I think the best thing is for the professionals to come in and just sort the whole thing out.",
        "Tom: Are you asking me to represent you?",
        "Craig: I am.",
        "Tom: Wouldn't you be a little more comfortable with someone that shared your love of duplicity?",
        "Craig: That's the last thing I want. All right, I know we've had our disagreements.",
        "Tom: That's putting it mildly.",
        "Craig: But I really want to do things differently. I really want to resolve this peacefully.",
        "Tom: Well, that's exactly what Dusty wants. Which is why I've agreed to represent him.",
        "Craig: I see. And family doesn't count for anything?",
        "Tom: That's funny coming from you.",
        "Craig: I know I have a lot of work to do to bring Margo around.",
        "Tom: Uh, my advice? Don't hold your breath.",
        "Craig: Then I'll keep plugging. I want Johnny to have a home, a family, and a life that isn't poisoned by his father's mistakes.",
        "Tom: Well, I hope you really mean this, Craig.",
        "Craig: I do. And I'd like you and Margo to be a part of it.",
        "Tom: As you said, there's still plenty of work to be done. So, I'm happy to steer you towards the second-best attorney in Oakdale.",
        "Craig: All right. I may just take you up on that.",
        "Tom: Well, here's my client now.",
        "Craig: Hello, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Craig.",
        "Craig: Where's Johnny?",
        "Dusty: In the lobby with Josie.",
        "Craig: Oh, um, do you mind if I say hello?",
        "Dusty: That's fine if that's all it is.",
        "Craig: See? We're getting along better already.",
        "Josie: What do you say, you want to go upstairs and play with your trains?",
        "Johnny: I want to go outside.",
        "Josie: I know, but the doctors want you to be extra careful right now. Maybe we can ask your dad when he gets back.",
        "Johnny: But I want to go now!",
        "Josie: Okay. Okay, maybe just for a minute and we'll just stay right outside the hotel, okay? All right, let's go get our coats.",

        "Carly: Can you believe that Craig asked me to marry him?",
        "Lily: More coffee?",
        "Carly: No, I'm good. I think that he might actually be losing his marbles.",
        "Lily: What did you say?",
        "Carly: Well, I didn't say anything, really. I just slammed the door in his face.",
        "Lily: And he just went away?",
        "Carly: He was gone in the morning.",
        "Lily: I can't believe he took no for an answer.",
        "Carly: He really didn't have much of a choice.",
        "Lily: And he didn't say anything about the loan?",
        "Carly: Didn't have much time for that, either.",
        "Lily: Maybe he has changed.",
        "Carly: Maybe.",
        "Lily: Are you reconsidering?",
        "Carly: You know, I've had a lot of proposals in my life, but this one was by far the weirdest.",
        "Lily: Maybe he thinks because you guys had a thing a long time ago --",
        "Carly: Lily, that was a long, long, long time ago. And it was over like as soon as it started. And he knows I'm not stupid enough to make that mistake again.",
        "Lily: Well, I'm just so glad that he didn't pressure you.",
        "Carly: I'm just curious; I wonder where he got the idea in the first place.",
        "Lily: Actually, I have a feeling it may have come from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: God, I have this test tomorrow on this DNA/RNA thing that I just completely don't get.",
        "Parker: It's -- it's pretty simple.",
        "Liberty: It's -- yeah, it's simple for a geek like you, but for me, this is like foreign. Look at that. That just is the most foreign, like -- it's not helping me with my biology problem.",
        "Parker: Really? 'Cause it's actually helping me with mine.",
        "Liberty: You're such a dork. We shouldn't be doing this, really.",
        "Parker: Why not? We have permission.",
        "Liberty: To go out, Parker, not do what we did in that bed before.",
        "Parker: That was one of the best days of my life.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it was a big day for me, too. But I don't think we really want to go reliving that right now.",
        "Parker: I do.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I'm kind of getting that vibe from you right now. But really, I think we got to just kind of keep it at dating for now.",
        "Parker: Okay, well, I could throw in a DVD and we can just pretend that we're at the movies.",
        "Liberty: That's not the point.",
        "Parker: Well, then what is?",
        "Liberty: Not getting into trouble.",
        "Parker: We won't.",
        "Liberty: We always do.",
        "Parker: No one's home.",
        "Liberty: But I don't think that's the only reason we shouldn't be doing this.",
        "Parker: What else?",
        "Liberty: I forgot.",
        "Parker: Really?",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Jack: Parker? Carly? Hey, anybody home? Okay, I guess not. Parker, are you up there? It's no wonder he can't hear me.",
        "Jack: Parker, are you there? Hey -- hey --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: All I did was point out to Craig that if he wanted to get a judge to give him visitation rights, that it might help him if he had himself a wife.",
        "Carly: Oh boy.",
        "Lily: You know, to establish his credibility as a father.",
        "Carly: Uh-huh, did you also suggest to him that I would be desperate enough to say yes?",
        "Lily: No, of course not. I never even thought he would ask you.",
        "Carly: I can't believe you would tell him to use any woman like that.",
        "Lily: I didn't tell him to use any woman. It was more of a -- if you get your act together enough to settle down with a woman, that you might have a shot.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Well, I don't think it's likely that he's going to fall in love before the first court hearing.",
        "Lily: No, but I don't think he was just scheming. I mean, you saw him the other day with Johnny at the Lakeview. He loves that little boy. I think that he honestly wants to provide a stable home for him after everything he's been through.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Well, he deserves that.",
        "Lily: What he doesn't deserve is Dusty and Craig going through a war to decide who's going to be the father.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I feel for him, I really do.",
        "Lily: Well, not enough to be his fairy Godmother?",
        "Carly: Not if it means marrying Craig Montgomery, no.",
        "Lily: I agree with you. But what if he doesn't give up so easily?",
        "Carly: Uh, I guess I'll send him your way.",
        "Lily: Oh, no, he already tried.",
        "Carly: He did not.",
        "Lily: He did.",
        "Carly: When?",
        "Lily: When I suggested it. He said why don't you divorce Holden and marry me.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: What did you say?",
        "Lily: I said, yeah -- no! I think he's just being polite. He's much more interested in you.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, it's not going to happen. And you know, after the judge gets a look at his record, it's not going to matter if he shows up in court with the Brady Bunch, you know.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I told him the same thing. I mean, minus the Brady Bunch part.",
        "Carly: Well, he would figure that out for himself, wouldn't he, if he would just think about something, anything, for just a minute.",
        "Lily: Since when does Craig Montgomery think about anything for a minute?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Well, he's not going to get me on board with this. I mean, I don't even understand how he could think I would consider it.",
        "Lily: Well, maybe because you accepted the money.",
        "Carly: Now, Lily, the money came with no conditions.",
        "Lily: Mm-mnh. Craig always has conditions.",
        "Carly: Now you sound like Jack.",
        "Lily: How furious was he when he heard about the loan? I mean, I saw his face when Parker showed up with Craig and Johnny at the Lakeview.",
        "Carly: I don't have to tell you that Jack is not Craig's biggest fan, no --",
        "Lily: It's kind of cute, actually. I mean, after all these years.",
        "Carly: No, cute is not how I would describe it. I mean, can you imagine how Jack would react if I -- if I did become Mrs. Craig Montgomery?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're unbelievable, you know that?",
        "Parker: We weren't doing anything.",
        "Jack: I know what I saw.",
        "Parker: Well, we weren't doing anything wrong.",
        "Jack: Oh no? We said you could date and two seconds later, you're jumping back in bed.",
        "Parker: We weren't in the bed. We were on it. Liberty, wait!",
        "Jack: Tell me what you were doing up here in the first place?",
        "Parker: I was helping her with her homework.",
        "Jack: By lying down in your bedroom?",
        "Parker: I needed my laptop and I wanted her to hear a new band, so we were listening to music.",
        "Jack: You were doing a lot more than listening.",
        "Parker: You said we could go out.",
        "Jack: This isn't out! Out is to the movies, or Java, or the mall! Not hitting the sheets the first chance you get.",
        "Parker: What century is that definition from?",
        "Jack: I am not the mood for your attitude, okay? You were supposed to stick to the rules.",
        "Parker: Well, your rules suck! They make no sense.",
        "Jack: Well, you don't have to like the rules, you just have to follow them.",
        "Parker: Why? Because you said so?",
        "Jack: Because I'm your father and you're too young.",
        "Parker: In your opinion.",
        "Jack: My opinion is the only thing that should matter to you. You understand?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Are we done here?",
        "Jack: For now.",
        "Parker: Great, then I'm out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, I'll leave you two to your meeting and go see my son. Just to say hello. I'll call you for that referral.",
        "Dusty: Referral for what?",
        "Tom: Yeah, an attorney after I said that I wasn't interested.",
        "Dusty: He tried to hire you?",
        "Tom: Um, he did, but I told him you were a client and I offered to just steer him another way.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, steer him to some ambulance-chaser with a serious drinking problem.",
        "Tom: I thought that might be a little obvious.",
        "Dusty: I'm surprised he didn't bring in some legal hit man, some hot shot, you know.",
        "Tom: I'll tell you the truth, I'm kind of surprised myself.",
        "Dusty: So, where do we stand?",
        "Tom: It's hard to say. You see, there's not a lot of legal precedent being set these days with two fathers fighting over the custody of the same child without a mother in the picture.",
        "Dusty: So, it's up in the air.",
        "Tom: It's really hard to say how any judge would rule.",
        "Dusty: So the stakes are my son and his future.",
        "Tom: That's correct.",
        "Dusty: So what do we do?",
        "Tom: Well, I think our best strategy is to make sure that we don't go to court.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: Is that Leo the locomotive? I thought I recognized him from your coloring book. And that's coming from the station.",
        "Johnny: Can we go see it?",
        "Josie: Yeah, sure.",
        "Craig: Johnny boy! Oh, where's my hug? Oh, it's good to see you. Dusty said you guys were out here.",
        "Josie: Really? You saw him?",
        "Craig: Yeah, in the lounge. I told him I was going to come say hello. He didn't have a problem with it.",
        "Josie: Okay, well, you've said hello. I think we're going to go back inside. Let's go, Johnny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So how do we stay out of court?",
        "Tom: Settle.",
        "Dusty: You mean compromise with Craig?",
        "Tom: And I think the first offer should come from you.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Tom: You already have legal custody. So any time that Craig is allowed to spend with Johnny is coming out of your time. So, you might as well earn points for being magnanimous.",
        "Dusty: I don't get the reasoning.",
        "Tom: Well, it's also going to allow us to set the tone for the negotiation we don't set the bar too high.",
        "Dusty: So what do we offer?",
        "Tom: It's up to you.",
        "Dusty: I don't know. It's not easy for me to offer the guy anything.",
        "Tom: Well, you're going to have to remember that he is Johnny's biological father. And any judge is going to take that into account.",
        "Dusty: First, Tom, I have a demand.",
        "Tom: What is it?",
        "Dusty: I want all the charges against Lucy dropped so she can come back.",
        "Tom: Well, I think that's probably reasonable. What are you willing to give up?",
        "Dusty: You mean, when can Craig spend time with my son?",
        "Tom: That's what I mean.",
        "Dusty: How about we start with never and get tougher from there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Now why would you back inside on such a beautiful day?",
        "Josie: Uh, Johnny's still recovering.",
        "Craig: Fresh air is the best medicine. Besides, that hotel is way too stuffy, isn't it, Johnny? Tell you what, you can go ahead and take your walk and I'll just tag along.",
        "Josie: You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Craig: I really don't want trouble. I just want to spend time with my son.",
        "Josie: Well, why don't you clear it with Dusty first?",
        "Craig: That's already in the works. Things are being worked out as we speak.",
        "Josie: Well, that's good. It's upsetting for Johnny when you two fight.",
        "Craig: I know. But now there's lawyers involved, they're being paid by the hour -- I don't really see this thing being fast-tracked. But I would like to extend an olive branch to you, even though you sent me on that wild goose chase so Lucy could see Johnny before she left.",
        "Josie: Well, she was like a mother to him.",
        "Craig: She kidnapped my son.",
        "Josie: To keep him away from you.",
        "Craig: Oh, I see you've bought Dusty's side of the story.",
        "Josie: I know what I saw. It's because of you that Johnny has been separated from the woman who obviously means the world to him. So don't tell me how much you care, because I am not interested. I know that Craig never does anything out of generosity, or compassion, or any other human normal trait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Yeah, I mean you're the one who said he seemed different.",
        "Lily: Well, when it comes to Johnny. Everything else, the jury is still out.",
        "Carly: So you don't think then he proposed to me out of sheer, pent-up passion?",
        "Lily: Sorry to burst your bubble.",
        "Carly: Well, so much for my fairytale ending. Again.",
        "Lily: The fairytales I know don't involve huge sums of money.",
        "Carly: No, that has nothing to do with this.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, excuse me. Hello?",
        "Jack: Where are you?",
        "Carly: Well, hello, Jack, it's nice to hear your voice.",
        "Jack: Where are you, Carly?",
        "Carly: I'm at Lily's.",
        "Jack: Stay there. I'll be right there.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Jack: I'll tell you when I get there.",
        "Carly: Is something wrong?",
        "Jack: Just the brilliant decision to trust our oldest son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Liberty! Liberty, wait up! Would you just stop for a second? Look, I am sorry. I had no idea my dad would walk in on us like that. I don't know what he was doing there.",
        "Liberty: What's the difference?",
        "Parker: Will you just stop?",
        "Liberty: No.",
        "Parker: Why are you mad at me?",
        "Liberty: I'm mad at myself for being so stupid.",
        "Parker: You're not stupid.",
        "Liberty: Then why do I keep finding ways to humiliate myself?",
        "Parker: This is not your fault. This is my fault. I had no idea my dad would be there. And I am really sorry.",
        "Liberty: You keep saying that and it keeps happening.",
        "Parker: Look, I wanted to kiss you. And I thought you wanted me too.",
        "Liberty: Look, I wanted you to help me with my math homework.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but you were into it, I know you were.",
        "Liberty: I know and that's why I should not have gone with you to your bedroom.",
        "Parker: So I'm right.",
        "Liberty: I just don't see why we keep getting ourselves into trouble.",
        "Parker: We're not doing anything wrong.",
        "Liberty: Well, we know the rules and we keep breaking them.",
        "Parker: Because the rules are ridiculous. They're not about us or what we want. They're about what our parents want. And why should we go by what's in their sick minds?",
        "Liberty: Because they are our parents.",
        "Parker: Oh, man.",
        "Liberty: And I'm so sick of them walking in on me with my clothes half-off!",
        "Parker: Okay, so what do we do now?",
        "Liberty: I need you to stop pushing me.",
        "Parker: Oh, so this is my fault?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, well, who else? Every time we're in a room alone, you start putting your hands all over me.",
        "Parker: You liked it.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but I don't want to do this anymore.",
        "Parker: Okay, so you're saying no more sex?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I'm saying no more anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okay, well, I think that I should probably wait for Jack outside.",
        "Lily: Don't be silly.",
        "Carly: Lily, this is going to get ugly.",
        "Lily: Are the kids all right?",
        "Carly: Well, he said it was about Parker. Who's not such a little kid anymore? I mean, he is a kid, but of course, he likes to think of himself as a man of the world. And -- oh, God, please tell me what happened to our sweet little angels who used to worship at our feet?",
        "Lily: They were replaced by pods who look exactly like them, except they're sarcastic and capable of inflicting horrible pain.",
        "Carly: They must be stopped.",
        "Lily: What happened?",
        "Carly: Janet and I agreed that Liberty and Parker should be allowed to date again if that's what they want. And Jack did not agree with us.",
        "Lily: You and Janet agreed on something?",
        "Carly: We did and the world did not explode.",
        "Lily: But Jack did.",
        "Carly: He seemed pretty convinced that they were break any rules that we set for them and it looks like he may have been right. What did I do to deserve this? No, I shouldn't ask you that. Don't answer me.",

        "Tom: Well, you have a good point that he needs to prove himself. Let's hope his lawyer is smart enough to convince him that any judge is going to feel the same way.",

        "Tom: I think we wait until he gets representation, sit down at a table, and make some plans.",
