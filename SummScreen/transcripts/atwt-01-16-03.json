        "Paul: Hey, sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.",
        "Lily: That's okay.",
        "Paul: I came in the back. Holden let me in.",
        "Lily: I'm glad you're here.",
        "Paul: So -- what's -- what's going on?",
        "Lily: I thought that's why you came.",
        "Paul: Are you purposely trying to confuse me?",
        "Lily: Wait, did you -- didn't you get my message?",
        "Paul: Yeah, most of it. It got cut off at the end. All this stuff -- is \r\nall that stuff yours?",
        "Lily: Mine? Um, I don't -- what do you think? You think this is me?",
        "\r\n[Both laugh] no.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I think Rose needs some of her stuff shipped back to Italy?",
        "Lily: She does need some of her stuff, but not in Italy. That's why I \r\ncalled you. Rose is coming home.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You -- you told me that earlier. I thought -- I thought for \r\nsure you were gonna tell me that she had changed her mind. So when is she -- \r\nwhen's she coming back?",
        "Lily: Is tomorrow soon enough?",
        "",
        "Carly: All these people look so happy.",
        "Jack: Of course they're happy, honey. They're on vacation.",
        "Carly: Well, how much does paradise set you back these days?",
        "Jack: No, no, no. We are not worried about money, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Carly: It says here you can swim with the dolphins.",
        "Jack: Ah, beats swimming with sharks.",
        "Carly: And those little drinks, with the little umbrellas.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. And a mariachi band. Mm. Full moons. Long walks on the \r\nbeach.",
        "Carly: Let's go now.",
        "Jack: Ah, forget it. No way you're ducking the doctor. And once we nail \r\ndown all the particulars on baby Snyder, we'll be cool. Hey, look -- I got us a \r\nlittle light reading for the trip.",
        "Carly: \"The greatest baby name book ever.\" Modest.",
        "Jack: I got it for kicks.",
        "\r\n[Phone ringing] no, hey, you know, we're leaving that thing at home.",
        "Carly: I --",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: I'll just be a minute.",
        "Jack: Fine. Then shut it off, please? Please?",
        "\r\n[Phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Mike: Carly, it's me. Look, Molly's been on ert ever since we left your \r\nplace. She is sure something's going on with you guys.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I saw that. Fine. Just tell her.",
        "Mike: Carly, if you don't tell her about the baby yourself, she's gonna \r\nwonder why I know and she doesn't. She'll be upset.",
        "Carly: Okay. I'll handle it. Bye.",
        "Jack: You'll handle what?",
        "Carly: Oh. Mike thinks I should tell Molly about the baby. Maybe I \r\nshould.",
        "Jack: Maybe? Honey, Molly is the only family you have around here. I \r\ncan't believe she's not the second person you told. That is, unless you've got \r\nsome kind of reasons for not telling her that we're having a baby.",
        "",
        "Craig: About your proposal of marriage -- I have an answer for you.",
        "Rosanna: Wait. Don't, really. Not yet. Not until you've heard what I've \r\ndecided. I'm withdrawing the proposal.",
        "Craig: You don't want to marry me?",
        "Rosanna: Well, no, I would love to marry you. Just not in the \r\nforeseeable future.",
        "Craig: So the proposal is off the table?",
        "Rosanna: Well, yes. Don't look deflated. Come on, now. It takes more \r\nthan that to pop your bubble.",
        "Craig: You'd be surprised, Rosanna. I'm a changed man.",
        "Rosanna: Well, don't change too much, or I won't be able to recognize \r\nyou. All right. I will get to the point. You may have noticed over the last \r\ncouple of weeks, I've been a little off balance and more than a little scared.",
        "Craig: Well, that's understandable.",
        "Rosanna: But I think, because of it, I lost sight of who we are \r\ntogether.",
        "Craig: And -- who might that be?",
        "Rosanna: Being with you is like being on a wonderful, exciting roller \r\ncoaster that I just want to get on line for again and again.",
        "Craig: Well, that's good, I think.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. And in the last couple of weeks, I feel like our \r\nrelationship has gone to a whole new level. And that's -- enough for me.",
        "Craig: And -- and does this level have a name?",
        "Rosanna: Honesty. You opened up to me, and you told me about that night \r\nwith Carly. Well, you risked losing everything.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. I had to.",
        "Rosanna: Look, I'm sorry I got ahead of myself. I feel like I really \r\nput you on the spot with that marriage proposal.",
        "Craig: Forced me to take a long, hard look at our relationship.",
        "Rosanna: Which explains the \"deer in headlights\" look.",
        "Craig: You know, I came here expecting to have a whole 'nother \r\nconversation.",
        "Rosanna: Well, another time, maybe.",
        "Craig: I didn't know rejection could be so sweet.",
        "Rosanna: Before anyone mistakes us for your average, happy couple, \r\nthere's something else we need to discuss.",
        "Craig: Hmm?",
        "Rosanna: Monte Carlo.",
        "",
        "Simon: Here's to my beautiful wife.",
        "Katie: Oh, and here's to watching every woman in this place go green \r\nwith envy because I'm with the hottest guy here.",
        "Simon: Oh, stop it! No, keep going. So what time are Margo and Tom \r\ngetting here?",
        "Katie: Oh, Tom just called my cell. They're gonna be a little late.",
        "Simon: Late? Tom's never running late.",
        "Katie: Well, it's my fault. Because I had him checking up on something \r\nfor me at the office.",
        "Simon: What do you need a lawyer for?",
        "Katie: I don't. Oh, look at that girl's jacket. It's so cute. I wonder \r\nwhere she got it.",
        "Simon: That's pathetic. What have you got Tom checking up on?",
        "Katie: I'm just having him make a couple calls to Australia to see if \r\nhe can figure out how to help you get rid of those charges.",
        "Simon: Without talking to me?",
        "Katie: I knew you'd hate the idea. And I wanna just do it to make you \r\nhappy.",
        "Simon: Babe, I am happy. I'm happy.",
        "Katie: You don't look happy.",
        "Simon: There. How's that?",
        "Katie: Besides, you would do it for me.",
        "Simon: What -- go behind your back, invade your privacy?",
        "Katie: Ah, we're married. We don't have any privacy.",
        "Simon: Yeah, obviously not.",
        "Katie: Simon, you're making a big deal out of nothing. Either Tom can \r\nhelp us out, and we get to go to Australia, or he can't, and we stay perfectly \r\nhappy right here.",
        "Simon: Listen, honey, I don't care if I see or smell another bloody \r\nsheep ever again. At this point in time, I don't intend to set foot on \r\nAustralian soil for the rest of my life.",

        "Paul: So, Rose is coming back tomorrow?",
        "Lily: Yes! She called from London this afternoon. She's getting a \r\nconnecting flight in New York to Oakdale. I wrote down the arrival time. You \r\nwanna check it out? ",
        "Paul: No. It's okay.",
        "Lily: I thought we'd all go down there to meet her. Yeah, I said to my \r\nmother, I have the first dibs on interrogating her. And you can hold the bright \r\nlight over her head.",
        "Paul: I think I'll pass.",
        "Lily: On the interrogation or going to the airport?",
        "Paul: The whole thing.",
        "Lily: Well, Rose is gonna think that you don't care.",
        "Paul: Rose is gonna think I don't care? I know she's your sister, Lily, \r\nand you love her --",
        "Lily: You love her.",
        "Paul: -- But I'm not the one who checked out for months. I'm not the \r\none who didn't return phone calls or answer letters or even bother to let me \r\nknow if and when she was coming home again. I mean, is this even her home? I \r\ndon't know. I don't know. Maybe she's just breezing through here.",
        "Lily: Joe was very sick. She needed to spend time with him. You knew \r\nthat.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I got that part. And I was fine with her wanting to take \r\ncare of Joe. He needed her. But for how long? Months? Years? An eternity? What? \r\nYou know, during that whole mess with the trial and James and everything, I kept \r\ntelling myself, \"I am so glad Rose is not here in the middle of this nightmare.\" \r\nBut inside, I needed her. It was killing me. I didn't have her there to lean on \r\nor to believe in me. I was alone, Lily. Alone. And that is something that I \r\nnever, ever did to Rose.",
        "Lily: You're upset. And you're hurt. And I don't blame you for that. \r\nAnd I have to tell you -- I have no idea what's going on in that girl's head. \r\nBut I do know that she still loves you.",
        "Paul: No, you don't. Don't say that. You want to believe it. So did I.",
        "Lily: But if you're not there when she walks off that plane, it's like \r\nyou're telling her that it's over. Okay, you know what? This is a lot to ask, \r\nbut could you just think about coming?",
        "Paul: I've had months to do nothing but think. Rose is the one that \r\ncalled this off, not me. She said it in so many little ways, I lost count. But \r\nbelieve me -- I got her message loud and clear.",

        "Carly: I want to tell her. But I'd like it to be special. The right time.",
        "Jack: There's nothing special about her finding out third-pers. Did you \r\nguys have a fight or something?",
        "Carly: No. It's just -- you know, once Molly knows -- she'll want to \r\nknow the due date. She'll plan a baby shower. She'll have the nursery completely \r\nredecorated in, like, a week. And if there's one thing we need, Jack, it's a \r\nlittle downtime.",
        "Jack: Yes, I know. That's why we're going on a honeymoon. Put yourself \r\nin Molly's shoes for a second. If she was pregnant, would you want to be the \r\nlast to know?",
        "Carly: No. And I don't want to hurt her. You know that. But this is so \r\nnew. For the first time in my life, I want to keep something simple and private. \r\nWhy can't anybody understand that?",

        "Craig: Monte Carlo is a thing of the past.",
        "Rosanna: Well, the thing of the very recent past.",
        "Craig: Why split hairs?",
        "Rosanna: Because I feel like everything that I've done recently has \r\nbeen a reaction to something else.",
        "Craig: There has been a lot to react to.",
        "Rosanna: I don't like living that way.",
        "Craig: Well, didn't we agree that our future is more important than \r\npast mistakes?",
        "Rosanna: Well, yes, that's true. But Monte Carlo is important, too.",
        "Craig: So is forgiveness and moving on.",
        "Rosanna: And I do forgive you, Craig. All right? I can't believe I'm \r\nsaying this, but in a way, I'm glad the whole Carly thing happened. Sort of -- \r\nnot that I want it to happen again, mind you, but it showed how much we mean to \r\neach other. I think we both agree that it was for the best. I just needed to \r\nhave my tantrum. My five minutes of revenge. That's why I pulled the plug on \r\nMonte Carlo.",
        "Craig: I understand.",
        "Rosanna: I just felt so out of control. You know? I was facing surgery \r\nand everything. And I just needed to have something to hold onto. Then you -- \r\nyou were here, and you sat next to me during probably the worst time of my life. \r\nAnd when you did that, everything changed.",
        "Craig: For me, too.",
        "Rosanna: I just feel that my mistake was not having enough faith in \r\nthis to let it breathe. I thought, if I nailed down a marriage proposal, that -- \r\nwell, that you'd never lie to me or cheat on me again. And I know that's just so \r\nridiculous. It's a ridiculous theory. I want you to be with me, if this is where \r\nyou want to be. I want you to choose me in your time and in your own way. Not \r\nbecause I -- I forced a marriage proposal or held Monte Carlo over your head. \r\nThat's why I'm giving you back the company. As of this moment, Monte Carlo is \r\nyours again.",

        "Molly: You want to go to Cancun with them?",
        "Mike: No. Just the two of us. You know? We'll go check out some new \r\nplaces. We'll have nice little candlelight dinners, some expensive bottles of \r\nwine. A big, fat king-size bed.",
        "Molly: And where is this big, fat king-size bed?",
        "Mike: Monterey. I used to live there. I'm thinking we could land in San \r\nFrancisco. We'll drive along the coast.",
        "Molly: It sounds incredible. I would love it!",
        "Mike: Can you get off?",
        "Molly: Of course I can get off. There's so many interns around that \r\nplace just dying to get air time.",
        "Mike: Good. I'll book the trip. I think this is gonna be really good \r\nfor both of us.",
