Margo intends to charge that person with attempted murder. A terrified Maddie pleads with Casey to help her wipe clean her computer. Casey agrees to help as the two of them continue to fight and deny their growing feelings. Will and Gwen get evicted by Burt who has been influenced by Hal, thanks to some convenient zoning laws.

Meg finds an unconscious Paul outside half buried in the snow. She continues to nurse him hopefully back to health, but when the cabin is freezing and Paul continues to burn up, Meg crawls into bed with him.

        "Casey: You know what, don't worry, I'll get you back in time to watch \"Venice Beach.\" I just have to deliver this, then we'll hit Java, and then we'll crash in front of the tube.",
        "Maddie: What about homework?",
        "Casey: What about \"Venice Beach?\"",
        "Margo: What about where have you been?",
        "Casey: I'm the bag man, remember?",
        "Margo: Casey, you're, like, an hour late.",
        "Casey: I had basketball.",
        "Maddie: I was stuck in the science lab.",
        "Casey: So I waited to give her a ride. I mean, that's two good deeds, one day. I think I hit my quota.",
        "Margo: You're pushing it.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Margo: I need you to be where you're supposed to be when you're supposed to be there.",
        "Casey: Why don't you just put a chip in my neck and then you can track my every move?",
        "Margo: Don't tempt me. Why don't you get that bag over to Moreno's desk. He's doing the math on this.",
        "Casey: Fine.",
        "Margo: Fine.",
        "Maddie: You know, he raised a lot of money for your charity. He's been really cool, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know. Too cool.",
        "Maddie: I meant with following the rules. Everybody messes up. He's trying to make up for it.",
        "Margo: As well he should.",
        "Maddie: I know. But there are a lot of different ways of doing it. And Casey really had his heart set on going to the University of Wisconsin. Can't you find a way to, I don't know, give him a second chance?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, I'm home. Hey, that smells good. What'd you cook?",
        "Gwen: Liar. It's canned ravioli. Extra meat.",
        "Will: You got a job?",
        "Gwen: Hmm-mm. I hit a special, three cans for a buck at the supermarket.",
        "Will: All right, I'm going to go shower before we eat. I smell like an oil pan.",
        "Gwen: I can fix that.",
        "Will: You're smudged.",
        "Gwen: You can fix that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: My hands are tied.",
        "Jack: Kasnoff has no history with the Ryan case.",
        "Hal: Just the way the Commissioner likes it.",
        "Jack: You gave in to the Commissioner?",
        "Hal: Are you looking for a fight?",
        "Jack: I'm looking for my job back.",
        "Hal: You're here, Jack. It's a start. From now on, anything personal stays outside those doors.",
        "Jack: Right. So Kasnoff gets the high profile cases and I get, what, parking violations?",
        "Hal: We've got a lead on a gambling ring on the west side. I pulled the info from the state boys and the feds. Go through the logs, see if anything jumps out.",
        "Jack: Great. Busted to paperwork.",
        "Hal: Work with me on this, Jack. Something good could come out of it, you know? [Knock at the door] Yeah?",
        "Burt: Detective Munson? A cop out front said you were in here.",
        "Hal: Yeah, right, hold on a second. Jack, can we finish this later?",
        "Jack: Oh, forget it. No problem at all. I've got plenty of work to do. Excuse me.",
        "Hal: Come on in, Burt.",
        "Burt: Is there a problem with my garage, Detective?",
        "Hal: Yes, Burt, I'm afraid there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're handling the Paul Ryan case? Well, it's a little early for April fools, but that's a good one.",
        "Nick: You think I'm joking.",
        "Carly: If Hal Munson is not handling the case, there's only one person who would take over and his name is Jack Snyder.",
        "Nick: Why?",
        "Carly: Because he's the best detective on the force.",
        "Nick: I don't know what to tell you, but Munson gave me the case. If you don't believe me, I mean, you can call him. Listen, it's kind of cold out here. Can we go inside?",
        "Carly: Trust me, it'd be a lot colder in here.",
        "Nick: Then do you mind standing outside?",
        "Carly: I'm busy.",
        "Nick: I won't take much of your time.",
        "Carly: I wish.",
        "Nick: Answer my questions about the Paul Ryan case and your wish is my command.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul, where are you? Paul? Paul? Paul, can you hear me?",
        "Emily: You told Paul to call the wedding off?",
        "Jennifer: Not in so many words.",
        "Emily: In how many words?",
        "Jennifer: Look, you know, I don't think that we should be discussing this.",
        "Emily: I just want to know what you talked about.",
        "Jennifer: Paul wanted to know how he could earn my forgiveness.",
        "Emily: And you told him not to marry me?",
        "Jennifer: Emily, Paul kept insisting that the only reason that he didn't tell me that the baby was alive was because he loved me. Because he was protecting me. Well, real love is thinking about someone else besides yourself. And so I told him, if he wanted to make amends, then he would need to put somebody else ahead of himself.",
        "Emily: Me?",
        "Jennifer: Emily, a year ago you were married, you had a real family. You were loved and respected. And now look at you. You're alone, you have no friends and you've lost your son. And you have Paul to thank for that, and he knew it. So maybe after talking to me, he decided to do something about it. And it would be the first selfless thing he's done in his life.",
        "Emily: So you think he did it out of love?",
        "Jennifer: He loved you enough to cut you loose.",
        "Emily: No, he said it was about Rosanna. He told me he couldn't marry me because of Rosanna. He said it to me --",
        "Jennifer: He said that my baby was dead. He said a lot of things.",
        "Emily: No, he said that he could never love anyone.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that's a possibility.",
        "Emily: You don't know what you've done! You don't know what you made me do Jennifer!",
        "Jennifer: Emily, be glad you let him go. You're better off.",
        "Emily: I am not better off! It's your fault he's gone! It's your fault he's never coming back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I should come home dirty more often.",
        "Gwen: Working at Burt's, not a problem. I got you something.",
        "Will: Yeah? A GED study guide?",
        "Gwen: It's much cheaper than Oakdale Latin. I thought maybe we could study together.",
        "Will: While you serve me canned Ravioli.",
        "Gwen: While you apply to college.",
        "Will: And what about you?",
        "Gwen: When you're swimming in dough, you can send me to college.",
        "Will: You know we don't need my mother, Gwen, we can do this.",
        "Gwen: We'll just take the scenic route.",
        "Will: And I love the scenery.",
        "Gwen: Me too.",
        "Will: As long as we're together, we can do anything.",

        "Burt: I don't want any trouble, Detective.",
        "Hal: The zoning laws are real clear.",
        "Burt: I'll fix it.",
        "Hal: I'm counting on it. Those fines, they add up real fast.",
        "Burt: I'll take care of it today.",
        "Hal: I'd appreciate it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Maddie, I know you mean well, but it's not like he tanked on a test or he was late for a curfew. An innocent baby was involved. He hurt that girl Gwen and he didn't take responsibility for his actions and then he lied to us for months.",
        "Maddie: No, but he learned his lesson.",
        "Margo: It's a big lesson.",
        "Maddie: And none of my business?",
        "Margo: Exactly. But you know what, Maddie? You're really good for Casey, so please, please stick with him.",
        "Maddie: Yeah?",
        "Cop #4: Detective, we got a lead on B.J. Green's e-mails.",
        "Margo: Excuse me, with you in a second.",
        "Maddie: Oh, right.",
        "Cop #4: They were sent from someone named kkkkatie@truetest.com.",
        "Margo: No, that's not my sister's address.",
        "Cop #4: No luck on the source yet.",
        "Margo: Well, keep working it. I want to see who brought that monster to town and then I want them charged with accessory for attempted murder.",
        "Casey: Whoa, whoa, where's the fire?",
        "Maddie: Casey, I am in trouble. I am in big trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, would you mind if I use Moreno's desk?",
        "Margo: Why don't you use mine because I've got to follow up some leads in the B.J. Green case.",
        "Jack: I don't want to get in your way.",
        "Margo: Well then use the interrogation room because I don't think Hal's going to be in there. Why don't you just use your old desk? Nick is out doing leg work on the Ryan case.",
        "Jack: That guy doesn't waste any time, huh?",
        "Margo: Hey, you okay?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm great.",
        "Margo: Come on, Jack, it's not forever.",
        "Jack: Sometimes it just feels that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: It's nice. It's homey.",
        "Carly: You're not staying. Just ask your questions.",
        "Nick: Do you have to make this so hostile?",
        "Carly: You haven't seen me hostile.",
        "Nick: Mind if I take a seat?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I do actually. And in the interest of saving time, I'll just tell you right now that I don't know a thing about Paul Ryan, okay.",
        "Nick: I'm under the impression that you're friends with Emily Munson.",
        "Carly: We were friends when she had better taste in men.",
        "Nick: I see, you're a fan of the Lieutenant.",
        "Carly: Maybe that's because he happens to be my son's father. Don't you have that written down there anywhere? I guess you don't have all your facts, do you, Detective?",
        "Nick: Back to Mrs. Munson. Our theory is Ryan jumped bail. That he and Emily cooked up this cover story about him standing her up at the altar.",
        "Carly: I don't know why the wedding didn't happen. Maybe because Paul still has a thing for my sister.",
        "Nick: The one in the coma.",
        "Carly: Yeah, that's the one. Her name is Rosanna. They were married.",
        "Nick: That was a while ago.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. But the night of the accident, Paul was trying to help her. And I've always thought that -- that that's because he was still in love with her. There was a lot to love.",
        "Nick: I'm sorry, didn't mean to upset you.",
        "Carly: I'm not upset. And I'm not close enough to Emily to know what happened between her and Paul. And I really don't care. So why don't you jot that down in your little notebook there so you don't forget, all right?",
        "Nick: You said you and Emily aren't friends anymore because you didn't approve of her taste in men?",
        "Carly: What's your point?",
        "Nick: When you had custody of Jennifer Munson's child, you had asked Emily to be the godmother. You already knew she was with Paul. I mean, call me crazy, but that sounds pretty friendly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: If I really am the reason that Paul left town, I can deal with that. This whole town will probably be better off.",
        "Emily: Don't talk about him that way! He loved you! You and Will were his whole world!",
        "Jennifer: He loved you, Emily. Do you see how it ends?",
        "Emily: It didn't have to end! Don't you understand, it didn't have to be over!",
        "Dusty: Is there a problem?",
        "Jennifer: It's okay. Emily, go home, wherever that is these days.",
        "Emily: My home was with Paul, but you ruined it.",
        "Dusty: What is she talking about?",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. He loved me. He loved me. How could I have been so wrong? How could I do that to him?",
        "Dusty: Now I'm interested. Tell me, what did you do to Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Just a little further. Got it, okay. You're burning up.",
        "Paul: So cold.",
        "Meg: That's because of the fever. We got to try and get that down, okay? The infection under control.",
        "Paul: No. No, please, no more needles, please.",
        "Meg: It's an antibiotic, Paul.",
        "Paul: Where did they go?",
        "Meg: If you're talking about Emily and Jennifer, they're not here. And they never were, you're hallucinating. You're hypothermic. Paul, if you don't let me give you this shot, you'll die. You might die anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You know what I really want?",
        "Will: I can guess.",
        "Gwen: I want to be like this forever.",
        "Will: Of all the places I've lived, Gwen, this is the best.",
        "[Knocking at the door]",
        "Gwen: You expecting anybody?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Gwen: Your mother?",
        "Will: No, when she knocks, she knocks the hinges off. I'll get the door. Hey, Burt. Come on in.",
        "Burt: I can't.",
        "Gwen: We've got some great canned ravioli.",
        "Burt: No thanks. Kids, I hate to tell you this, but I just gotta say what I gotta say. I'm evicting you. You've got till tomorrow morning to clear out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I said I handled it. At least it forces Will's hand, Barbara. Look, I'll let you know as soon as I hear from him. Right.",
        "Jack: Oh, I'm sorry, Margo said you weren't using this.",
        "Hal: No problem, it's no problem.",
        "Jack: Look, about my attitude before --",
        "Hal: Hey, forget it. I'd be surprised if you didn't give me attitude.",
        "Jack: And I want you to know that I'm gonna give it my best shot with this illegal gambling ring. Who knows, maybe I'll crack it.",
        "Hal: You know what? I wouldn't surprised if you did.",
        "Cop #5: Sorry, Jack, but Moreno's bringing in the witnesses to that jewelry --",
        "Jack: You've got to be kidding me?",
        "Cop #5: I think there's a desk in the evidence room.",
        "Jack: What about the men's room?",
        "Cop #5: What?",
        "Jack: Nothing. Tell Moreno I'll get out of his way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: And that's when she started acting weird.",
        "Nick: Emily?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yes of course, Emily. All of a sudden she told me that I should give the baby back to Gwen without a fight. I didn't know that she was in cahoots with Paul. All I knew is that a woman I trusted suddenly turned her back on me.",
        "Nick: And you didn't suspect there was anything up between those two?",
        "Carly: Well, Nick, unfortunately my turban's at the dry cleaners and the kids were playing with my tarot cards.",
        "Nick: I'll bet you can give great fortunes.",
        "Carly: Yeah, it is a gift. Like, right now, I see a door being slammed in your face. Hey, hi, bud. So tell me, how was your piano lesson, huh?",
        "Parker: Boring. Scales again.",
        "Carly: Did you thank Ms. Johnson for the ride?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Can I go upstairs?",
        "Nick: Hey, is this your keyboard, pal?",
        "Carly: Parker, this is Detective Kasnoff.",
        "Parker: You know Mike?",
        "Nick: Yeah, he's my cousin.",
        "Carly: Nick here works at the station with your dad and Jack.",
        "Parker: Hi.",
        "Nick: Hey, buddy, it's nice to meet you.",
        "Carly: Detective Kasnoff was just leaving.",
        "Nick: Hey, listen, after your mom and I get done with a little conversation over a cup of coffee --",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Nick: I'm going to teach Parker a thing or two on the keyboard.",
        "Carly: No, no. I'm not certain that's really a good idea because it's getting late and Parker has a -- you have a spelling test young man that you should be studying for.",
        "Nick: All right, you can do it. Plant your hand on middle C, okay? No, give it a whirl. No milk, just sugar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I don't owe you an explanations.",
        "Dusty: Paul's missing, I guess you saw him last.",
        "Emily: I said awful things and now I'm never going to get to say I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: That's your problem. Don't make it Jen's problem, she's not interested. You okay?",
        "Jennifer: Emily sure knows how to ruin a night. Where's Johnny?",
        "Dusty: With your mom. I thought we'd be tied up.",
        "Jennifer: You did?",
        "Dusty: We can go pick him up if you want.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, I think it's a wonderful idea for him to spend some quality time with his grandmother.",
        "Dusty: Spending time with his mother is an even better idea.",
        "Jennifer: Hmm. I've been wanting to do that ever since Lily and Holden's ceremony. Wasn't that romantic?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Up to a point. I'll talk to you about it later.",
        "Jennifer: What? No. Come on. I'm going to beg you until you tell me.",
        "Dusty: Meg showed up. She saw us together and she split.",
        "Jennifer: She had the nerve to show her face at the ceremony? You think that she would get out of town after what she's did.",
        "Dusty: Nope, she's here.",
        "Jennifer: Because of you?",
        "Dusty: Meg and I are over. And she knows it.",
        "Jennifer: Then what on earth is keeping her in Oakdale?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: This isn't the deal, Paul. I am not digging a grave in zero degree weather, got that? Come on, fight! Come on! Dammit, Paul! If you want to get back at Emily, live. Paul! Did anybody ever tell you, you have rotten taste in women? Okay, this antibiotic isn't working. You need an IV. You're going to the hospital.",
        "Paul: No. No hospitals.",

        "Jack: Hey, what have I missed around here?",
        "Paul: If you take me out of here, I'll make sure you go to jail, Meg. For a long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I don't care why Meg's hanging around. She can't touch us. I got to go take care of something.",
        "Jennifer: At this hour?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, stay here, okay?",
        "Jennifer: But where are you going?",
        "Dusty: Don't make move until I get back. I won't be long.",
        "Lisa: Hi, there. How are you?",
        "Dusty: Hello, beautiful. Good, how are you?",
        "Lisa: Just fine.",

        "Lisa: I do.",
        "Dusty: You make sure she stays there for me?",
        "Lisa: Yeah. Did I miss something?",
        "Jennifer: No, I'm not sure.",
        "Lisa: Darling -- look, your mother told me about the baby. And I just can't believe that Paul and Emily would do such a terrible thing. And that little stinker. Little stinker, Meg Snyder. How did she get involved in this scheme?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know, Lisa. I will never understand it.",
        "Lisa: Okay, best not to dwell on it. You've got your baby now, and that's the most important thing in the whole wide world. So you've got to start looking to the future.",
        "Jennifer: I'm trying, Lisa, I really am but, I don't know, I can't help but think about all the time I've missed already with Johnny. I just wish I could get rid of all the reminders of what I've been through.",
        "Lisa: Yeah, well. I think that might be a little bit difficult with this new neighbor that you have coming in here.",
        "Jennifer: What are you talking about?",
        "Lisa: Meg has rented a suite here. She did that today and she put three months advance on it. I think that's going to be a reminder that's a little bit too close for comfort.",

        "Meg: Look, the hospital is your only choice now, okay. If you want to live to fight another day.",
        "Paul: I'm not going there.",
        "Meg: You need a doctor, Paul. High-dose IV, antibiotics, maybe a transfusion. I don't know, I've done everything I can.",
        "Paul: I'm all better.",
        "Meg: Better than what? Road kill? Look, I'm a nurse. Maybe I don't have my license anymore, thanks to you, but I'm not in the habit of letting people die if I can help them. So let's go, come on.",
        "Paul: If you take me out of here, I'll make sure you go to jail, Meg. For a long time.",

        "Burt: It's not the rent.",
