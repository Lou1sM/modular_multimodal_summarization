        "Casey: Mom? Dad -- weird. Mom, Dad -- did you guys have a fight? All right, I tried. I've got to tell them. I've got to.",
        "Katie: The thing you have to hold onto here is that it's Tom. He never smoked, he worked out, he ate right -- these are the times that those things come into play. He's gonna get through this.",
        "Margo: Yeah. You didn't see his eyes though, Katie. I mean, you never see Tom scared.",
        "Katie: The important thing is that you got him help right away, got him here, he's here where people love him and they'll take good care of him.",
        "Margo: So, any news?",
        "Bob: He's stable, he's been prepped. Steve Dawson's going to do the surgery. He's one of the best, and he was on vacation, but he came in.",
        "Margo: So can I go talk to Tom?",
        "Bob: Just for a minute.",
        "Margo: Okay, okay.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Mike: I guess Margo's not going to need her coffee.",
        "Katie: No, but thank you for getting it anyway.",
        "Mike: You're welcome. I got you some hot chocolate. I know how you get when you have too much caffeine.",
        "Katie: That's really thoughtful. Thank you. So, how did you hear about Tom, anyway?",
        "Mike: I guess I didn't tell you -- I've been doing some renovations for the hospital, so I was downstairs when Tom came in. So I saw him.",
        "Katie: Margo's really scared.",
        "Mike: Yeah. I heard you trying to make her feel better.",
        "Katie: Well, I just thought about all the times that she's talked me down, held my hand. She's much better at it than I am.",
        "Mike: You did pretty well. You okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm fine. This isn't happening to me.",
        "Mike: It kind of is. I know how much you love her and Tom.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well I just have to be strong for them right now. It's really hard.",
        "Mike: You'll do okay. And, if it helps -- you can lean on me.",
        "Katie: It helps. Except, she thinks she may be saying good bye to him.",
        "Jack: Good night Maggie, drive safe, okay? It's going to be a bad night. Already is. Hey, troops, I'm back.",
        "Sage: J.J. got peanut butter on my card for Mommy and I had to do it all over.",
        "Jack: Let me take a look at that card. It's great, Sage. It's really great.",
        "J.J.: Can we visit Mom after dinner? You said the jail would let her have visitors.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I think we've got to talk about that, Buddy.",
        "Sage: Can Mommy put up my card on the wall? Do they have tape there?",
        "Jack: Parker, why don't you come on over here and have a seat?",
        "Parker: What did she do now?",
        "J.J.: Don't talk like that. Tell him not to talk like that!",
        "Sage: Why can't we go see Mommy?",
        "Jack: Guys, there's no easy way to tell you this, so I'm just gonna tell you. Your mom -- left.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Jack: She went -- she went away with Simon. She's not in Oakdale anymore.",
        "Carly: I'm serious, Simon. Turn the plane around.",
        "Simon: You know that's just suicide.",
        "Carly: When we land, I'll call Jack. I can't live my life without seeing my kids.",
        "Simon: Even if it's from the inside of a jail cell?",
        "Carly: That's better than this! If I do it this way, they won't know where I am, they won't know why I've gone - -",
        "Simon: We'll figure that out, okay? We'll take care of it --",
        "Carly: I have figured it out. We land. You run. I face the music. End of story.",
        "Simon: If you're so hell bent on going back, I'm going with you.",
        "Carly: No, Simon. I'm the one who has to go back -- not you. Please, just land the plane somewhere near Oakdale. I'll take it from there, okay?",
        "Simon: No, no, no, no. We are in this together. End of discussion.",
        "Carly: Simon, that doesn't make any sense. I have to go back, you don't. There's no reason for us both to end up in jail. They're my children, they're my responsibility.",
        "Simon: And we both know that you wouldn't even be in this mess if it weren't for me.",
        "Carly: I'm a grown up, you know. I could have turned and walked away at any time I wanted to, I just didn't.",
        "Simon: Yeah, well you tried to do that, remember? And I kept talking you out of it. I did anything just to keep you around. It was pure selfishness on my part.",
        "Carly: Well then be selfish now. Be selfish now, when it really matters, Simon. It's what I want. Do you have any idea how wrong it feels for you to be --",
        "Simon: Decent?",
        "Carly: This thing between us, it was supposed to just be fun, you know? Make me feel free and happy and irresponsible. It wasn't supposed to do this to you -- it wasn't supposed to make you suburban and responsible. I do this to everyone that I love. Look what I do to them.",
        "Simon: Okay, so answer me this -- do you think even one of those people that you love would even think about giving up the experience of loving you back? No, I don't think so.",
        "Carly: Well they're morons. All of them.",
        "Simon: Listen Carly, do you really think your kids would be happier knowing that you're in jail? Happier than if they know that you're out there somewhere trying to put the family back together again?",
        "Carly: How am I going to do that?",
        "Simon: I don't know yet. I don't know how to do that. But going back, turning yourself in, that gives up any chance of a decent outcome. Listen, Carly -- you're not running away. You're staying free to try and figure out a way -- both of us -- to fix this thing.",
        "Carly: They don't know that. They're just going to think that I left them. You didn't see Parker. You don't know.",
        "Simon: Okay, so tell them. Better yet, why don't you let them decide? Why don't you ask Parker what he thinks you should do?",
        "Carly: And how do you suppose I should do that?",
        "Simon: Well, seeing how I've already turned the plane around, why don't you ask him face to face?",
        "Jack: I think it's important to remember that your mom didn't walk out because of you.",
        "Parker: Well, what would you call it?",
        "Jack: Parker, when you get older, you're going to find out that people can be pushed too hard.",
        "Parker: So she said one thing and did something else. She lied to us, and then she ran away. Forever.",
        "Sage: Mommy wouldn't do that.",
        "Parker: She already has. I mean, that's what you're saying, isn't it? She ran away with Simon, and she's never coming back.",
        "Jack: Parker, can we talk about this in your room, please? It's rather upsetting to Sage.",
        "Parker: There's nothing to talk about. She cares more about Simon than she does about us. So, I'm glad she left. I'm glad!",
        "Sage: It's not true. Mommy wouldn't leave us. She just wouldn't.",
        "Margo: Hi, can't come to the phone right now but when you hear the tone leave a message and we'll get back to you.",
        "[Answering machine beeps]",
        "Casey: Hey -- Mom, Dad, its Casey. I need to talk to you, and it's kind of important so can you give me a call as soon as you get this?",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Maddie: Hey -- I saw your car.",
        "Casey: Hey Maddie, I'm sorry that I took off like that. It's just I was really bummed out about something and I need to talk to my parents ASAP.",
        "Maddie: Casey, you don't know, do you?",
        "Casey: Know what?",
        "Maddie: Something happened to your dad.",
        "Katie: Hey, you okay?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Bob: Okay. Listen, why don't you sit here with your sister and Mike, and if anything comes up, I'll be out to tell you.",
        "Lisa: Where's my son? What is he doing here in the hospital --? What happened?",
        "Bob: Calm down. Tom has had a heart attack.",
        "Lisa: Oh my God, Bob.",
        "Bob: Now he's stable, and we're doing surgery.",
        "Lisa: No, no. You can't do that -- not until I see him. I must see him first.",
        "Bob: It's too late -- he's already in the O.R. now they'll find out if there's any damage, and if there is, they'll fix it.",
        "Lisa: Bob, why didn't you call me? Why didn't you tell me this yourself? And you're just being so calm about the whole thing -- how can you be so calm about this?",
        "Bob: Because I'm trying to keep you from making a scene in front of Margo.",
        "Lisa: Tell me -- what happened.",
        "Bob: Why don't you talk to her?",
        "Lisa: Sweetheart -- our baby. Oh, Darling.",
        "Bob: Margo? I don't really know what happened to tell you the truth -- we didn't have much time for conversation. Did Tom ever have chest pains or shortness of breath?",
        "Margo: No, not that I noticed. I mean, he's been really tired lately, and he's been popping these antacids. That should've been a big red flag to me, but I just chalked it up to stress on the job.",
        "Bob: Since he went to work for your brother --",
        "Margo: Well that was short and sweet, but you know, since then he's been pretty stressed out trying to get the practice together. And then, when we heard about Danny --",
        "Lisa: Daniel?",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, it all happened so fast, I didn't get a chance to tell you, but Emily was supposed to pick up Danny to take him off on a trip, and she called a few a few hours ago and said that he never showed up.",
        "Lisa: Oh, no!",
        "Margo: Yeah, so -- well, I just reported it and I got all cop-like, and I never noticed that Tom -- Tom --",
        "Lisa: Come here, baby child. I know you're going through so much. Why don't we just sit over here. Let's just sit, okay? We'll just sit down here and we're gonna pray.",
        "Margo: You know what, really -- this is all my fault.",
        "Lisa: No, no.",
        "Margo: It is, because we don't even know about Daniel, and I --",
        "Mike: Look, you know what, okay? Why don't I go outside -- I'll call the station, see what's going on, see what I can do.",
        "Margo: That's great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How long is this gonna take?",
        "Bob: It depends on what they find. Could be several hours.",
        "Margo: I wish -- that's stupid.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Margo: I was just thinking, you know, I could get through this if Tom was just here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie, whatever it is, just tell me.",
        "Maddie: Casey, your dad had a heart attack. He's in the hospital.",
        "Casey: No, no, no. Not my dad, all right? That's gotta be wrong.",
        "Maddie: I know. I was in java and two nurses came in, and I overheard them talking. They said that the chief of staff was very upset because it was his son, and then I realized that they were talking about your father and your grandfather.",
        "Casey: A heart attack -- my dad's so young, he's in great shape.",
        "Maddie: I know -- I asked them just to be sure, and they said he was just admitted.",
        "Casey: It happened right here.",
        "Maddie: What do you mean?",
        "Casey: There was stuff all knocked over. Does Mom know?",
        "Maddie: They said she was with him.",
        "Casey: Why wouldn't she call me? Her phone's not picking up. We should go.",
        "Maddie: Casey, I'm so sorry.",
        "Casey: I know you are.",
        "Maddie: Listen -- I don't know if you want to be alone or if you want, I'll come with you --",
        "Casey: Yeah, that'd be great. I'm kind of freaked out. I wonder if he found out.",
        "Maddie: What'd you say?",
        "Casey: Nothing. Let's just go.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Lisa: Now, we all must remember that Carter Benson is much older than Tom, and he had a heart attack, and he is now playing tennis. So you see, we really have nothing to worry about. We have nothing to worry about whatsoever.",
        "Bob: Lisa, I'd like you to do me a favor. I'm gonna go to the office and call Mom, and it would help me if you'd be with me.",
        "Lisa: I have to stay here with Margo.",
        "Margo: No. Lisa -- I'm sure that Gram would want to hear from both of you so -- and I've got Katie.",
        "Lisa: Well, if you're sure. All right, okay. Just remember though -- nothing. We have absolutely nothing to worry about.",
        "Bob: Make sure you say that to Mom when we talk to her, huh?",
        "Margo: I just couldn't take it anymore, she was trembling. I couldn't take it.",
        "Katie: It's okay. Bob's really good with her.",
        "Margo: He is. He is. He always takes care of everybody, and then you know, he has own little private anxiety. But then I saddle him with Lisa.",
        "Katie: No, it's okay. You know, I actually think they want to be together right now.",
        "Margo: Maybe you're right. You know it's always amazed me that two people so opposite could have come together and created someone so solid like Tom. Any news?",
        "Mike: I talked to Dallas Griffin, the Amber Alert went out, but they haven't heard anything yet.",
        "Margo: It just seems like that was ages ago, but it was only just a few hours.",
        "Mike: They also said they'll have some fliers made up with Daniel's picture on them. I told them I'd help pass them out unless you need me here.",
        "Margo: No, no. Good. Thank you. Katie? You know how I am --",
        "Katie: You want to be alone?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: That's okay. You've always been like that. I'll help pass out fliers.",
        "Margo: Good, good.",
        "Katie: And I'll just be a phone call away. I'll keep my cell. I'll be here in five minutes if you need me.",
        "Margo: Great. I just don't want anyone looking at me anymore.",
        "Mike: She's handling this pretty well.",
        "Katie: To worry about Tom and Daniel at the same time -- it's just too much.",
        "Mike: At least there's something we can do to help find Daniel.",
        "Katie: Mike, I didn't mean to involve you in this. I mean, you're being amazing, but we're still, you know -- it's --",
        "Mike: Hey, you know what? With everything that's going on, let's just, let's not talk about us, okay? Let's just go find Daniel.",
        "Simon: Okay, you can open your eyes now.",
        "Carly: Here's the thing -- before you fly again, you might want to learn how to land.",
        "Simon: Okay, I know how to land. It wasn't me, okay? That was the weather.",
        "Carly: All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're trying to help me. I don't want to yell at you.",
        "Simon: The scary thing is, when you do yell at me and say mean things to me, it feels like we're right back on track.",
        "Carly: I'm just nervous. I'm nervous about seeing the kids -- especially Parker. I don't know how to tell them. I don't know how to explain this to him.",
        "Simon: Okay, we're not there yet. We've still got to figure out a way to get to them.",
        "Carly: Well, waiting isn't going to make it any easier. Can I have your phone?",
        "Jack: I can't. My kids really need me right now. Tell Margo that. What? When? Okay, hold on just a second. J.J., there's an emergency at the station. Do you think you guys can handle being alone for an hour or two?",
        "J.J.: Sure.",
        "Jack: Who's on patrol? Ted? Ted Maynard's on patrol, you know who that is, okay? He's going to drive around every ten minutes or so, but if you need me, I'm on my cell.",
        "J.J.: Okay.",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay. I'll be there in a little bit. Are you okay with this? Because I'll come back if you're not. And I'll be here to tuck you in, I promise.",
        "Sage: Just tell Parker not to be so mean.",
        "Jack: Right. I will, I will. But guys, don't be mad at Parker, okay? He loves Mom, too. I'm gonna take this upstairs to him and I'll tell him to cut you guys some slack.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "J.J.: I'll get it. Hello?",
        "Carly: J.J.? J.J., It's me. It's Mom. Don't say anything -- don't tell anybody I'm on the phone.",
        "Jack: J.J., who is it?",
        "Carly: J.J., is that your dad? Tell him it's for you.",
        "J.J.: Dad, it's for me. Can I have some privacy sometime?",
        "Jack: Sure. Yeah, Sage, come on. Why don't we give J.J. some space? Come on.",
        "Sage: Why? Is he talking to a girl?",
        "Jack: I'm beginning to think that myself. Come on, you can come upstairs with me while I say good-bye to Parker.",
        "Carly: Why is your dad there anyway? Where's Maggie?",
        "J.J.: The weather's bad, he sent her home. And I don't think he wanted her there when he told us about you.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "J.J.: He told us you left with Simon.",
        "Carly: J.J. -- I need to explain. I was on my way there --",
        "J.J.: I knew you wouldn't run away. I told Parker. I knew he was wrong.",
        "Carly: The thing is, Honey -- I can't come there when your father's there.",
        "J.J.: Well, he's leaving. He has to go back to work.",
        "Carly: You're going to be alone?",
        "J.J.: He's doing the patrol car thing.",
        "Carly: Every ten minutes?",
        "J.J.: I don't like movies like that. The effects are really cheesy.",
        "Carly: He's back?",
        "Jack: Hey Buddy, you know what? I'm gonna going. Hey listen -- try not to hassle Parker, okay? We'll talk about it when I get home.",
        "J.J.: Sure.",
        "Jack: All right? I'll see you later.",
        "J.J.: He's gone.",
        "Carly: Okay, J.J. you just stay there. I'll be there as soon as I can. I love you.",
        "J.J.: I love you too, Mom.",
        "Simon: Everything okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, oh, it's great. It's really good. Jack is taking excellent care of the children that I have abandoned, and J.J.'s becoming really quite a fabulous liar, just like me. I don't know how I'm gonna do it. I don't know how to explain to them that I've screwed everything up.",
        "Simon: Can you please stop? Don't be like that to yourself. Carly, I've seen it. Those kids know how much you love them.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm gonna be pushing that particular envelope tonight. I think it's going to be a lot worse than your landing.",
        "Lisa: Well, your mother, as usual, was just remarkable.",
        "Bob: It's her faith that gets her through bad times.",
        "Lisa: Well, this is certainly a bad time.",
        "Bob: I know.",
        "Lisa: You just never think -- your child --",
        "Bob: I know, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: He's my baby.",
        "Bob: He's my baby, too.",
        "Lisa: Of course.",
        "Bob: But he's in very good hands. And he's healthy and strong.",
        "Lisa: Just like you. You're healthy and you're strong and you're kind, and that's something I'll never take for granted. Ever again.",
        "Casey: Grandma. Grandpa -- hey. How's my dad?",
        "Bob: He's in surgery.",
        "Casey: Where's Mom?",
        "Bob: I think she went to the chapel.",
        "Casey: All right. Well, how bad is it?",
        "Bob: Well, we'll know more after the surgery. A friend of mine is doing the procedure, and he's just about the best you can find, and I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.",
        "Margo: Me too.",
        "Casey: Mom --",
        "Margo: Hey, Baby. So I just made a bargain with God, and I'm pretty sure that we're both gonna keep our deals.",
        "Casey: So you were there when it happened?",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Well, are you all right?",
        "Margo: Of course I'm all right. You know, the EMT's got there, and they were great, and I just saw your dad before he went into surgery, and he's -- well, he's unconscious so he's not in any pain so -- don't worry, everything's gonna be fine.",
        "Bob: Hey, listen. We're going to try to get a hold of Leanne, so Margo, if you need anything, just call me.",
        "Margo: Great, great. Casey, Honey, that's not all. Your dad was really upset before all this happened.",
        "Casey: Because of what?",
        "Margo: It's Danny. He's missing.",
        "Casey: Danny!",
        "Margo: We don't really know what's going on, but everyone at the station is on it. Oh, Adam. Okay, all right, okay. I've got both my boys here, so I'm good.",
        "Adam: Is Tom still in surgery?",
        "Margo: Yeah, he is. And Bob says that they're not going to know anything until they really get in there and -- okay, this is Bob. He's going to beep me and let me know a progress report, so he's probably just calling to tell me that everything is going to be fine. Hi, Bob. It's me. Already? Well, that's good then, isn't it? Yes, yes, yeah. I will.",
        "Casey: Is something wrong?",
        "Margo: Um, your dad's gotten through the surgery, and he's fine.",
        "Casey: That's good news. So when do we get to see him?",
        "Margo: Bob is talking to the surgeon now, and then he'll come out and tell us about everything.",
        "Adam: Mom --",
        "Casey: Aw, Mom \u0096",
        "Mike: I want you to cover Locust Avenue from 15th to the park.",
        "Volunteer #1: Just Locust Avenue?",
        "Mike: Yeah, because we're going to need to go door to door. You got a cell on you? All right, call this number if you get anything. Thank you.",
        "Volunteer #1: Don't thank me, I'd want people out there if it was my kid.",
        "Katie: Okay, we're all set.",
        "Mike: Hey, what is it?",
        "Katie: They were -- those guys are bailiffs. They work with Tom. They've worked with him for years. They were talking about what an amazing person he is and how they would do anything to help him.",
        "Mike: Okay, it's okay. It's okay.",
        "Katie: I just don't understand. Why can't I write about guys like that? No, guys like that don't get into \"Oakdale Confidential.\" They're sweet and decent and good people. They're not --",
        "Mike: Calm down. [Katie sighs] Okay?",
        "Katie: I'm just so sick of being me. I had you and Tom and Margo. And no, I wanted more.",
        "Mike: Okay, look, all this is hitting you at one time, so don't be so hard on yourself.",
        "Katie: Hard on myself? I would still be married to you if at any of these times I would have been a little bit hard on myself. I'm sorry. I'm just going to go by myself. I'm going to go to Trenton Avenue and leave you alone. I'm sure you're sick of me.",
        "Mike: You know what? As mad as I've gotten lately, I've never gotten sick of you. I can't explain it.",
        "Katie: I'm good, aren't I? Daniel's missing, Tom's in the hospital, but I still got us talking about us. [Cell phone rings] Margo, hey, how's Tom? Oh, thank God! He's out of surgery. He's fine. Yes, I know. Okay, please give him a hug for me. No, no. Tell him I'll see him in the morning. I think I'm just going to keep working. Yeah. Okay, thank you so much for calling, Margo. I love you so much. Bye. Oh, thank God. I was so scared. She thought she was going to lose him.",
        "Mike: Okay, you know what? Let's go.",
        "Katie: Let's, as in together?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Let's make sure when Tom opens his eyes, he has some good news. Okay?",
        "Katie: Okay, let's.",
        "Simon: I think we should just go in.",
        "Carly: No, no, no. No, the cop in the patrol car might see us. We'll wait until he goes by and then we'll know we're safe. The closer I get to seeing them, the less I know what I'm going to say.",
        "Simon: Just tell them the truth. Tell them you need to get somewhere safe so you can try and work out how to fix things.",
        "Carly: Given the fact that I find that hard to believe, I hardly think that they're going to believe it.",
        "Simon: Carly, they know how much you're risking just to see them. I think they're going to understand a lot more than you think they will.",
        "Carly: Right.",
        "Simon: You want me to wait out here?",
        "Carly: No. No!",
        "Simon: Listen, I don't think Parker, especially, is going to be that thrilled to see me.",
        "Carly: Well, Simon, maybe he should hear us both talking about how we want to come back and see that you want to help me fix things, you know? Shh! Okay. All clear.",
        "Margo: Hey. You done good, buddy boy.",
        "Tom: Daniel?",
        "Margo: Nothing yet, but you know what? I got a cop feeling about this and we're going to find him. We're going to find him soon.",
        "Lisa: But don't you worry about that, Sweetheart. Just don't you worry at all and concentrate on getting better.",
        "Tom: Hi, Mom.",
        "Lisa: Hey, Babe. Don't you ever, ever, ever do that to me ever again, sweetheart. I've never prayed so hard in my life.",
        "Tom: Well, it looks like it worked.",
        "Lisa: Yeah.",
        "Bob: Lisa, let's go to my office. We can call Kim and Mom. He can see the boys, but not for long. He's got to rest.",
        "Tom: Hey, Dad? Tell Grandma I love her.",
        "Bob: Of course.",
        "Tom: I love you too, Dad.",
        "Bob: I love you too, Son. Let's get out of here and leave them alone.",
        "Margo: Nah, go, go, Bob. Well, he was damned if he was going to let you see him cry. He's been a rock.",
        "Tom: You know the first thing I thought when I opened my eyes and saw you here?",
        "Margo: Oh, Baby, that's the drugs. I'm not that beautiful.",
        "Tom: The luckiest guy in the world.",
        "Adam: So they still haven't heard anything about Daniel?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Adam: Man. No wonder he flipped out.",
        "Casey: He didn't flip out, he had a heart attack!",
        "Adam: Okay, whoa, whoa, sorry. Bad choice of words.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry, man. It's just this day.",
        "Adam: He's going to be all right. And we're going to find Daniel.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Maddie: I know this is awful, but he's been acting weird all day. Even before he found out about his dad. I thought something fell through with Gwen and the demo.",
        "Adam: No, everything's pretty much on track there.",
        "Maddie: Hey, are you okay?",
        "Casey: I get it now. My dad can handle anything, anything at all, except if something happens to one of his kids.",
        "Maddie: Casey, you were stressed out before this happened. What's wrong?",
        "Casey: I just -- I hate letting them down.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Margo: Hey, guys.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Margo: Someone wants to say hello. Adam, do not let this one talk too much. Let's go, come on.",
        "Casey: Hey, Dad.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Adam: How do you feel?",
        "Tom: I'm fine. You know, like I'm kind of floating, but there's no pain.",
        "Margo: Well, the surgeon said that everything went just fine, but the recovery's going to take a while.",
        "Casey: You're going to have to take it easy for a while, Dad. You hear that? Promise me.",
        "Tom: I understand I have no choice in the matter.",
        "Margo: Nope. The new regime starts now, so you guys cut this interview short.",
        "Adam: All right, you take care of yourself. I'll be by Tomorrow morning. I'll bring some cds.",
        "Margo: Some long, slow, boring cds.",
        "Adam: I don't have any of those. [Margo giggles] Good night.",
        "Tom: Night.",
        "Casey: Dad?",
        "Tom: Hey. You don't have to say anything.",
        "Casey: I love you.",
        "Tom: Luckiest guy in the world.",
        "Casey: He looked really tired, but he seemed good.",
        "Maddie: I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Adam: So is there anything we can do to help find Daniel?",
        "Casey: We could check the station house. What's wrong?",
        "Margo: I don't know, Case, you tell me. I called home to check the messages to see if Emily called and -- what? What's wrong, Casey? What were you so anxious to talk to us about?",
        "Mike: Wow, its cold in here.",
        "Katie: You think?",
        "Mike: Whoa.",
        "Katie: Yeah, sorry. I kind of let the place go.",
        "Mike: Looks like a guy's place. All you need are some video games and a Pamela Anderson poster. Okay, maybe just the poster.",
        "Katie: Okay, I'll state the obvious. I'm bored here without you.",
        "Mike: It's hard to imagine you bored.",
        "Katie: Well, I am. I hate living alone. I used to like it before I lived with you and I hate it now.",
        "Mike: Oh, hey. You know what this is? The fuel bill.",
        "Katie: Oh, I've been looking for this.",
        "Mike: Right, past due. That's why it's cold in here.",
        "Katie: Well, some things don't seem as important as they once did.",
        "Mike: Heat doesn't seem important?",
        "Katie: Paying bills. It's boring and time-consuming and -- I don't know. Here, to warm you up.",
        "Mike: That's all right, I have to drive.",
        "Katie: Oh, right. Should I call Margo?",
        "Mike: Someone from the station probably called her.",
        "Katie: I just wish we could look some more or do something.",
        "Mike: Well, according to Dallas Griffin, there's nothing much more we can do until the morning anyway, so -- there you go.",
        "Katie: I can't get my fingers to work. It's freezing outside. Just thinking about Daniel out there by himself, freezing cold.",
        "Mike: It's okay. It's okay. I really don't think he's out there, I think he's probably somewhere safe and we'll find him in the morning. Okay, you know, you're right. You're right about the weather. I should probably go.",
        "Katie: Well, you're not going to do anyone any good in a ditch.",
        "Mike: Okay, well, I'll drive slow.",
        "Katie: I don't care if you drive five miles an hour. The fog out there is so thick, we barely got back here. Please don't go back to the farm. Don't make me worry about you, too.",
        "Mike: Hey, it's no problem, all right?",
        "Katie: Okay. Right.",
        "Mike: But you're right about the weather. I should get going.",
        "Katie: Well, thank you for the fire and hot chocolate and being nice and helping.",
        "Mike: No problem. No problem. Get some sleep. Margo's going to need you in the morning.",
        "Katie: Yeah. I'll just sit by the fire for a while and then go up.",
        "Mike: Okay. I'll see you Tomorrow.",
        "Katie: Can you turn the light off up there before you leave? I kind of like to watch the fire in the dark.",
        "Mike: I remember. Good night. I can't do it. I can't go.",
        "Katie: Oh, God. Thank God.",
        "Katie: Can we just stay like this for five or six days?",
        "Mike: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Katie: The last month, I have been walking around like I didn't belong to anyone or anywhere. And right now I feel safer and warmer than I have my whole life.",
        "Mike: Katie?",
        "Katie: No, no, don't, please? If this is just going to last a moment, don't say anything. Just let me believe that you're here. That you're back.",
        "Mike: Well, I was just going to suggest we might want to move closer to the fire where it's a little warmer.",
        "Katie: Would that require moving?",
        "Mike: Yes.",
        "Katie: Then I don't care. I'll stay cold.",
        "Mike: You know, when I was leaving, when I tried to leave, I looked in here and you just -- you looked so beautiful.",
        "Katie: I really don't want to ask this, but I have to ask this. I'm just kind of scared. Are you back?",
        "Mike: Seeing Margo and Tom thinking they might have to say good-bye just made what happened to us seem not so important.",
        "Katie: Well, that's very nice of you to put it that way, but it's not what happened to us, it's what I did to us.",
        "Mike: I don't want to talk about that ever again.",
        "Katie: You don't think you're going to get an argument for me on that one.",
        "Mike: I missed you.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm here and I'm not going anywhere. And neither are you.",
        "Margo: Casey, what is wrong?",
        "Casey: That message, it meant nothing. Nothing at all.",
        "Margo: Right. Like I don't know your tone when something's really bothering you.",
        "Casey: It's just so stupid.",
        "Margo: Come on, Casey, I want to get back to your dad and I'm not going to until I know what's going on.",
        "Casey: Okay. I got all worked up about this thing at school. I really hate one of my classes and I was thinking about, you know, changing my major.",
        "Margo: You left a message like that because you want to change your major?",
        "Casey: All right. I'm not really doing that well in that class and I might be getting a failing notice, but don't tell dad, please.",
        "Margo: I won't. But you know, we're going to talk about this.",
        "Casey: All right, and I swear that I'm really going to hit the books. You have enough to worry about without me screwing things up even more.",
        "Margo: Relax, you should've seen my freshman grades. I gotta get back in.",
        "Casey: All right.",
        "Maddie: Is that what's been bothering you? Your grades?",
        "Adam: Yeah, Dude, you never seem to sweat your grades all that much.",
        "Casey: Well, maybe since they're paying for everything, I thought that I should grow up and start caring.",
        "Carly: J.J.? J.J., its Mom.",
        "Simon: I don't like this.",
        "Carly: No, it's all right. He promised that he wouldn't tell anybody. They must be upstairs.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Craig: Daniel is not my victim and there's no way that you're going to pin this on me.",
        "Emily: The two of you -- the two of you can just go to hell.",
        "Simon: Carly, go! Go!",
        "Carly: Simon, no!",
        "Simon: Just get the hell out of here now! Just go now!",
        "Jack: Don't give me one more reason to shoot you."
