        "Gwen hesitates to leave Hallie home with a babysitter. Barbara meets with her doctor again to go over her treatment plan for her oral cancer and he again urges her to talk with her sons. Emily tells Chris and Evan that Dusty promised that the truth would come out that night. Lily learns of Emily's past as a prostitute and that Dusty knew all along. Evan promises to keep Dusty away because they are all far too invested. Emily worries about what Dusty has on Chris, as he wonders if Dusty is getting to her. She promises that she is only worried about him. Chris gives Emily a gift in a small jewelry box. Lucinda chides Dusty about the way he dropped Lily and then learns he is attending the hospital party. Will and Gwen await their babysitter so they can go to class. Barbara comes by instead and shares with them bad news instead of telling them about her diagnosis, she tells them about Paul losing his baby. Will takes something Barbara said the wrong way and assumes she is there to manipulate the situation to her advantage, but Gwen doesn't think so. Once Will leaves the room, she tells Barbara to give Will time because he will forgive her eventually. Barbara breaks down when alone. Chris gives Emily earrings to go with the necklace and tells her that he loves her. Emily can't say it back and when they start to make love, she thinks of Dusty. Lily pops some pills and goes to see Chris. Dusty stops her, but they have it out. Dusty threatens that they won't be friends again if she purposely hurts Emily to get back at him. Lily doesn't care; they stopped being friends when he took her to bed and dumped her. Dusty wonders what she is on? Lily almost passes out, so Dusty takes her upstairs. She is even angrier when she thinks Dusty wants to keep her there so she won't hurt his Emily. Gwen's babysitter cancels and Gwen can't find someone to replace her. Chris receives an anonymous note under his door. Chris tells Emily the note said Emily was a \u0091Whore who would sleep with anyone who paid her,\" as Lily is outside listening. Emily admits to it, as Chris does not take it well and flies off the handle and stomps off to the party without her. Emily thinks she knows who did this to her. Lisa tells Sofie that Barbara paid for her room. Emily grabs Dusty and demands to know why he would do this to her? Does he hate her that much? Lily is pleased with herself, as she attends the party and sees an upset and distracted Chris. Dusty calls out Chris to Emily on his reaction to the news. Emily is sure that Chris was just in shock, but Dusty thinks that he doesn't love her like he does. Sofie rips up the check and tells Barbara that she will never forgive her. Lisa and Barbara talk, as Lisa admits that she is worried about how she has been sounding recently. Barbara almost shares her diagnosis, but at the last minute changes her mind and tells her that she needs some dental work redone. Sofie goes to see Gwen to have her and Will talk to Barbara, but Gwen is preoccupied with finding a babysitter. Lily is pleased with herself when Chris is trying to find Emily. Lily admits to Lucinda that when you want something done right, you have to take matters into your own hands. Sofie offers to look after Hallie while Gwen goes to the lecture. Lily takes more pills and washes it down with champagne. Dusty is adamant that Emily doesn't love Chris because she couldn't have made love to him on New Years like she did if she loved Chris, as they both realize Chris has come into the room and has heard this last statement."

        "[Gwen singing]",
        "Will: How come I never get a show with my dinner?",
        "Gwen: Because you don't blow bubbles at me the way she does.",
        "Will: You better start wrapping it up because we gotta get going when the sitter gets here. I don't want to be late for class. Mr. Jenson starts his lectures on time.",
        "Gwen: I'm not going.",
        "Will: Why not? Is something wrong with the baby?",
        "Gwen: No. She's fine. I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Hearn: So, as you can see, you're really in the best possible condition to start treatment. There's a schedule on the second page, so you'll have an idea what's in store.",
        "Barbara: Wow, it's -- it's rather daunting.",
        "Dr. Hearn: I know. It may seem that way. But the harder we hit it now, the better chance we have of getting rid of all of it. And this schedule will help your family figure out how they can best support you during this difficult time. You have told them, haven't you?",
        "Barbara: My sons are dealing with some issues right now with their wives --",
        "Dr. Hearn: I'm sorry to hear that. But your condition has to be the priority right now. Barbara, this is oral cancer we're talking about.",
        "Barbara: I know exactly what it is, Doctor. I've done nothing but read, think and have nightmares about this since you gave me my diagnosis.",
        "Dr. Hearn: And all of that reading must've told you that this isn't something you can go through alone. You have to let your family know what's going on. The sooner, the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What if she wakes up, Will? You know how cranky she gets. The sitter's going to have no idea what to do.",
        "Will: So, we're going to leave the sitter a list. And we checked her references. You practically grilled the woman half to death.",
        "Gwen: Well, she held her for a few minutes in the same room with her. Don't you think I should at least stay -- see if something goes wrong?",
        "Will: Uh, the whole point of us having a sitter is so we both go out.",
        "Gwen: I just had an idea. We don't we just take her with us?",
        "Will: That's not a good idea.",
        "Gwen: Why not? We'll put her in this thing. She'll sleep the entire time.",
        "Will: Yeah, and if she doesn't, do you want to spend the whole lecture singing her back to sleep? She's going to be fine. I promise. And if you're really that worried about it, then you go to the lecture and I'll stay home with Hallie.",
        "Gwen: No, no, you're right. If I don't do this now, I never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Chris, you're not going to believe what Dusty's up to now -- hi, I'm sorry.",
        "Evan: Don't be. We were just going over some last-minute details for the party tonight.",
        "Chris: I shouldn't have left you alone with Dusty, but I had to take that page --",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, I'm the one who made the mistake. But unfortunately, you're going to be the one who ends up paying for it.",
        "Chris: What did he say after I left?",
        "Emily: He said the truth would come out tonight. All of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: No, it's not possible that we're talking about the same Emily Stewart. Because the girl that I'm talking about is a reporter for \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Krista: Blonde, right? Kinda ice queen attitude? The guys really got off on that.",
        "Lily: Keep talking.",
        "Krista: I heard she's dating some big shot at Memorial now. Talk about playing doctor. Cherie always said, Emily liked to make her own rules and get away with it. Looks like she was right.",
        "Lily: Don't be so sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evan: I'll contact security and have them keep an eye out.",
        "Chris: Thanks.",
        "Evan: I'm not doing it just for you. I've invested way too much in this to have Donovan show up and make trouble.",
        "Emily: Dusty really sounded like he had something.",
        "Chris: Well, doesn't he always? He's been blowing the same smoke for weeks now.",
        "Emily: No. No, no. This time it was different. What if he's telling the truth?",
        "Chris: That's impossible.",
        "Emily: Is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I don't care what you have to do. I need the results from Bob's coffee cup before tonight's contract signing. Good. I'll be waiting for your call.",
        "Lucinda: Wow! You're a very determined guy, aren't you -- when you want something? Only, when you don't want it anymore, that's when you toss it away like a broken toy. As you tossed Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I can't wait to tell Dusty about this one.",
        "Krista: Oh, he knows. He put a real cramp in Cherie's style, even threatened to shut her entire operation down if she didn't stop sending Emily out.",
        "Lily: Good old Dusty Donovan always there to help a damsel in distress. Thanks for the drink.",
        "Krista: Where you off to?",
        "Lily: To teach a blonde a lesson.",
        "Krista: Look out, Emily Stewart.",
        "Lily: Yeah!",
        "Krista: Not that it's any of my business, but do you really want the cops picking you up on a dui? Don't they hassle us enough as it is?",
        "Lily: You're right. I'll get a cab. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Are you sure there's nothing in your past Dusty could've found out?",
        "Chris: I already told you there wasn't.",
        "Emily: I know, I'm just -- he just sounded so sure this time.",
        "Chris: Dusty sounded sure, so now you're not?",
        "Emily: I'm just asking --",
        "Chris: Well, before you said you believed in me. How did Dusty change all that so fast?",
        "Emily: Baby, don't misunderstand. I know -- I know that you could never be capable of doing any of those things that Dusty's accusing you of. But you don't know him like I do.",
        "Chris: As far as I'm concerned, as long as I have you on my side, there is nothing Dusty can do to touch me. Tonight or any other night. In fact, this seems like a good time to be doing something that I've been meaning to do for a while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I didn't toss Lily aside.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, she didn't give me the impression she cut herself loose.",
        "Dusty: I just saw her.",
        "Lucinda: You did? How is she?",
        "Dusty: She could be better.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, and she was. Before she threw away her marriage for you. And look how you repaid her.",
        "Dusty: I gotta be someplace. Big party tonight.",
        "Lucinda: Wait -- no! No, no. You wouldn't have the gall to go to the signing at Memorial.",
        "Dusty: Where I go is none of your business.",
        "Lucinda: Don't you go to that party. Nobody wants you there. Least of all Emily.",
        "Dusty: I'll see you later, Sweetheart.",
        "Lucinda: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Is she down?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, for the time being. How's the list?",
        "Will: Blue binky when she's tired. Call us every half-hour to update --",
        "Gwen: Half-hour is a very long time.",
        "Will: She's going to be fine with the sitter, I promise you.",
        "Gwen: Cross your heart?",
        "Will: If she's not perfect when we get back, then I'll glue her to your arms.",
        "Gwen: I like that plan. [Knock at the door] Okay, you get the sitter, I'm going to do one more -- one more --",
        "Will: She's going to be great. There's going to love each other, you'll see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: It's not what you think it is. Not that I wasn't tempted by the ring section. But I'd prefer to have you breathing tonight.",
        "Emily: Okay, enough with the wisecracks. Can I have my present?",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Can I open it? My God, they're gorgeous. Why now? What's the occasion?",
        "Chris: To say thank you. If it wasn't for you and your support, I wouldn't even be hosting this party tonight.",
        "Emily: I love them.",
        "Chris: And I love you. I said that out loud, didn't I?",
        "Emily: Kind of.",
        "Chris: Well, then I guess it's too late to deny it. And it's okay, because I don't want to deny it. I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What are you doing?",
        "Lily: I think Chris Hughes should know the truth.",
        "Dusty: I told you, it's nobody's business. If Emily wants to tell Chris, that's up to her. But you stay out of it.",
        "Lily: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not talking about that. I think Chris Hughes should know that he's sleeping with a hooker. Don't you think he should know that before she sends him a bill for services rendered?",
        "[Elevator dings]",
        "Lily: Let go! Let go!",
        "Dusty: Sit, sit down.",
        "Lily: Let go.",
        "Dusty: Let's talk.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Dusty: Now where'd you hear about this? About Emily?",
        "Lily: What? The truth? The truth? You want to know where I found out the truth? Certainly not from you.",
        "Dusty: Who have you been talking to?",
        "Lily: When did you find out? Did you find out when -- let me see, you were a client of hers? Did you fall in love with her while she was turning tricks?",
        "Dusty: No, after.",
        "Lily: Maybe that's why you went back to her. Maybe I was too much of an amateur in bed.",
        "Dusty: What are you on right now?",
        "Lily: Nothing.",
        "Dusty: You don't sound like yourself.",
        "Lily: Nothing. You know why? Because Lily doesn't say bad things, bad words, let people walk all over her. No, never again.",
        "Dusty: Are you drunk or high?",
        "Lily: Nothing! I'm nothing! I was at Yo's and I ran into one of Emily's former working girls. They worked together. She gave me an earful about how the men just loved Emily. But you already knew that, didn't you? I think Chris Hughes should know, too.",
        "Dusty: If you breathe a word of this to Chris or anyone else? You and I will never be friends again.",
        "[Lily laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Emily: Nothing, I um -- we're going to be late for the party. You can't be late for your own party. You're the guest of honor, right?",
        "Chris: And Evan's. He can start without me.",
        "Emily: Oh God, you're such a man.",
        "Chris: Well, the words are right, but the tone? Not so much.",
        "Emily: No, I --",
        "Chris: And you're wearing way too many clothes.",
        "Emily: No, will you stop it. I meant you -- you're a guy, you're a man. It takes you like two seconds to get dressed. Me, on the other hand, it takes me many seconds, so \u0096",
        "Chris: You look pretty perfect to me.",
        "Emily: Well, stick around. You ain't seen nothing yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: No, we stopped being friends a really long time ago, Dusty. When you took me to bed and then you dumped me.",
        "Dusty: You have no right to trash Emily's life because you're mad at me. You gotta leave Emily out of it.",
        "Lily: Now, this for you, Dusty. This is for you. 'Cause Chris is going to find out, he's going to dump Emily and she's going to run right back into your arms. And you guys can go off and live happily ever after. Come on, let me do this one last favor for my best friend, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Hey, hey, hey. Relax. Let me do you a favor. I'm going to put you to bed. You hear me? I'm going to put you to bed so you can sleep this off, whatever's going on with you right now. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Lily: I'm not tired.",
        "Dusty: You just can't keep your eyes open, huh?",
        "Lily: That's not true.",
        "Dusty: I want you to get some rest. I'll call you later to see how you're feeling.",
        "Lily: No, don't -- don't leave me, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Wow.",
        "Emily: Now who's stopped breathing? So will you help a lady finish getting dressed?",
        "Chris: Yeah, as long as she's my lady, any time.",
        "Emily: I honestly can't believe how much my earrings -- they look great with the necklace.",
        "Chris: Well, that was the idea. Some things are just meant to go together. You really are the best thing that's ever happened to me. Never been so happy, so proud to be with anyone in my entire life.",
        "Emily: I'm proud of you too, Baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You just want me to sleep so I won't tell Chris the truth. So I won't hurt Emily.",
        "Dusty: So you won't hurt yourself. Which is what's going to happen if you leave here in the condition you're in. Now go to bed.",
        "Lily: You're a liar, you know that? When did you become such a liar? Just get out of here with your phony concern. I don't need --",
        "Dusty: Lily. Lil?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[Dusty leaves]",
        "Lily: Dusty? Dusty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know what? We'd better leave now or we're never going to make it to the party.",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah. Good idea. The quicker we get there and get the signing over with, the quicker we can get back here --",
        "Emily: Would you stop? Turn around, put your coat on. Stop rushing things, okay? I want to enjoy tonight. Every minute of it. I'm looking forward to walking into that room on your arm.",
        "Chris: Wearing the diamonds I gave you.",
        "Emily: And you're wearing all of my lipstick all over your face, which means I am wearing none. You know what? Let me go freshen up. You grab my wrap and I'll meet you out here.",
        "Chris: Okay, Baby.",
        "[Emily leaves the room, Lily slides a note under the door, Chris picks up the note]",
        "Emily: War paint applied and ready to go. What's wrong? What is that?",
        "Chris: It's a note somebody shoved under the door.",
        "Emily: Well, what's it say?",
        "Chris: Well, it's addressed to me, but it's about you.",
        "Emily: It's come to this? People are sliding notes under our door now? I can only imagine what it says.",
        "Chris: I don't think you can.",
        "[You're sleeping with a hooker]",
        "Emily: Chris, I work at \"The Intruder.\" I've made a lot of enemies. I'm sure, you know, it says something like, you know, you -- your paper is full of lies and am I close?",
        "Chris: No, it's worse than that.",
        "Emily: What does it say?",
        "Chris: It says -- I can't even say it -- no.",
        "Emily: Would you just spit it out, Chris?",
        "Chris: It says you used to be a hooker.",
        "Emily: \"You should know that your girlfriend used to be -- a whore who slept with any man who could pay her price.\" What are you doing? Who are you calling?",
        "Chris: Margo. This is harassment and this is outright libel. I'm not going to let someone --",
        "Emily: Don't.",
        "Chris: No, we have to. We can't let someone lie about you like this because -- because it is a lie, isn't it?",
        "Emily: No. It's not.",

        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Hello?",
        "Lucinda: Why don't you pick up your cell phone? Where've you been all day?",
        "Lily: I just needed to wrap my mind around a few things. But I'm feeling better now. Better than ever.",
        "Lucinda: You don't sound great. In fact, Darling, you don't sound like yourself. Did Dusty do something or say something to you?",
        "Lily: I can safely say that I got the last word where Dusty's concerned.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, I would be so relieved if I could believe that.",
        "Lily: Believe it.",
        "Lucinda: Well, if you've actually severed all ties with him, then I think maybe you should rethink about coming to the party at Memorial today. Because Dusty made it clear he is definitely coming.",
        "Lily: Oh, oh that doesn't bother me. You know what? As a matter of fact, I'm in the mood to celebrate. Even Dusty can't bring me down.",
        "Lucinda: Are you sure, Honey?",
        "Lily: Absolutely. This is a big night for Chris Hughes. I need to be there.",
        "Lucinda: Well, then, come on, get yourself down here.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I hoped that you'd never find out, especially not like this.",
        "Chris: I can't -- I can't -- you sold your body to strangers?",
        "Emily: No -- I only did it for a really short time. And it was before we ever got back together --",
        "Chris: So that you did it for a little while? That makes it better? No, no, no, no. You -- you are a beautiful, educated woman, Emily. Why would you demean yourself like that? Were you hooked on drugs, were you starving in the street?",
        "Emily: No. No, it wasn't about money.",
        "Chris: No, then why?",
        "Emily: Oh God, I was in a really strange -- a really strange place then. I honestly don't expect you to understand. But I did what I did because I -- my life was so out of control and it made me feel like I had control.",
        "Chris: By being paid for sex? Are you crazy?",
        "Emily: I was then, I think.",
        "Chris: I don't even know you.",
        "Emily: No. Yeah, you do. It's me. It's the same person. I mean, nothing's changed.",
        "Chris: Everything has changed. Don't look so surprised. If it wasn't a big deal, you would have told me. But you didn't.",
        "Emily: No. No, no, no. I'm the same person -- the same person I was a minute ago. When you said I was so happy -- you were so happy to be with me.",
        "Chris: How many? How many were there? No, forget it.",
        "Emily: Chris, please --",
        "Chris: Any of the men I work with?",

        "Chris: Yes, yeah, sorry. I have kind of a situation here.",
        "Evan: Well, tell the gorgeous blonde to put her clothes back on and get a move-on! The board members are arriving and they're looking for you.",

        "Barbara: There are some things we have to talk about. Some important things.",
        "Will: What things?",
        "Barbara: I've received some -- some disturbing news. About Paul.",
        "Will: What about Paul?",
        "Barbara: It seems that he was the father of Meg's baby, not Craig.",
        "Will: So what does that mean for him and Rosanna? Wait -- you said that he was the father?",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry.",
        "Will: They must be really devastated.",
        "Barbara: He is, I'm sure. First losing the baby with Emily, and now this little one, too. And at this point -- he's not with Rosanna but he's not with Meg. And he's all alone.",
        "Will: Okay. Yeah, I'll call him.",
        "Barbara: That would be really good. He needs his family around him right now. It's very important that we're supportive together, Will.",
        "Will: I can't believe you. You're going to make this about you.",
        "Barbara: No, no. I'm not doing that --",
        "Will: Yeah, you're trying to use what happened to Paul to get us to forgive you and let you see Hallie.",
        "Barbara: No, that's not why I came over here. It wasn't to talk about Paul.",

        "Gwen: Would you check on her?",
        "Will: Gwen --",
        "Gwen: I'm gonna be fine.",
        "Barbara: This is my fault, I know that it's my fault.",
        "Gwen: It is. And he's really, really upset with you. But he's got a huge heart and he's gonna forgive you. You just gotta give him a little bit of time.",
        "Barbara: You have no idea how much I wish I could give him all the time in the world. And I guess I'll start now. Bye, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Bye, Barbara. Okay. How is she?",
        "Will: She's fine.",
        "Gwen: Your poor brother, Paul.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm going to give him a call tomorrow. Can -- I can't believe her.",
        "Gwen: Will, I -- I'm sorry, but I don't think she was playing with us. I think she was really upset.",

        "[Barbara sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: My mother is an expert at playing the sympathy card. Trust me -- this was all a part of her plan so that she could see Hallie.",
        "Gwen: This felt different, Will.",
        "Will: No, it's not different. And you know what? I don't want anyone who can cause that much pain anywhere near my daughter.",
        "Gwen: Look, I understand entirely what you're saying. But all I kept thinking about while you were standing there, was what if one day Hallie looks at me the way that you were looking at her.",
        "Will: That would never happen. Because you could never do to Hallie what my mother has done to us. The sitter should be here. What's taking her so long?",
        "Gwen: Go -- you know what? Go ahead. Go to the seminar and I'll wait for her. I promise not to send her home the minute she gets here.",
        "Will: Okay.",
        "Gwen: All right.",
        "Will: See you there.",
        "Gwen: I love you.",
        "Will: Love you, too.",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "Gwen: I'm coming, Sweetie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: What can I get you, Ma'am?",
        "Barbara: Cup of coffee, please. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Gwen: Hello? Hey, yeah, yeah. I was starting to get worried, did you get stuck in traffic or something? Oh, well yeah, yeah. No, how high is the fever? Yeah, that definitely means that you need to stay there with her. No, no, no. I completely understand. Don't worry about it. Thank you. All right little Hallie. Looks like you're going to have a crash course in world literature. And separation. I must separate. I gotta separate. Hey, Alison. Could you do me a really big favor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Who? Could possibly --",
        "[Emily remembering]",
        "Emily: You're never going to be able to prove that Chris poisoned his father. Everyone who knows Chris knows it's impossible.",
        "Dusty: The truth is going to come out tonight. All of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Damn him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evan: Chris, hey! Way to make a fella sweat.",
        "Chris: Have you seen Dusty?",
        "Evan: No, no sign of him.",
        "Chris: Are you sure? This signing has to go smoothly. I need at least one thing to go right tonight.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, there -- there you are. At last, long last, the man of the hour!",
        "Evan: So glad you could join us for the celebration.",
        "Lucinda: How would I miss it? I wouldn't do that for the world. Oh, I guess the M.E. is memo 21, that's not just for Memorial, that's for Montgomery Enterprises, right? Aren't you just so clever?",
        "Evan: You flatter me. But really, the name of the project was Craig's idea.",
        "Lucinda: Where is he? Where is Craig? I would think that as your patron, he would be the first one here to greet you in your moment of triumph.",
        "Evan: Oh, he had a family crisis.",
        "Lucinda: A family crisis? Oh, well, I'd hope that doesn't stop him from ruining my company.",
        "Evan: What did I do in a former life to end up with her in my family tree?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Why? Why, Dusty? Do you really hate me that much?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Oh, Sofie. Got a minute?",
        "Sofie: Mrs. Grimaldi. I'd love to talk, but I actually --",
        "Lisa: No, you don't want to leave. Not without this. It's your first paycheck.",
        "Sofie: Oh, thank you. Thank you. I really hope after taxes it's not too -- wait, this is wrong.",
        "Lisa: Oh, did I make a mistake? Is it not enough? You know, I have trouble sometimes with the deductions.",
        "Sofie: No, it's too much. You're supposed to take the cost of my room out.",
        "Lisa: Uh -- no, that's been taken care of. By Barbara Ryan.",
        "Sofie: You mean --",
        "Lisa: You didn't hear it from me.",
        "Sofie: But why?",
        "Lisa: Why don't you go ask her yourself?",
        "Sofie: Excuse me. You did this? You paid for my room?",
        "Barbara: Yes, and you don't have to thank me, I was happy to do it for you \u0096",
        "[Sofie rips up the check]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Carly, hey. I'm sorry, I know you're really busy, but -- no, I know. I know I need to come over to Metro, but right now I need -- well, I'm trying to get out you. So I was -- okay, right. Good, okay. Thank you, I'll see you soon. Bye. Okay, who else is there? Come on. Come on, please pick up. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What are you doing?",
        "Sofie: I'm not taking another penny of your money. And as soon as I can, I'm paying back the money that you tried to buy my baby with.",
        "Barbara: You know what? I was trying to help Gwen and Will. I knew that they could be good parents, and obviously you came to the same conclusion.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, but you tried to take away my choice. You and Iris and Cole just kept pushing me, not caring how I felt or what I wanted. And now you think you can buy forgiveness like you tried to buy my baby. Like all your money can make things right with God or something. I remember seeing you in church. Praying to God to forgive you. And I hope for your sake he does. Because I never will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I knew that you were upset that I chose Chris over you but I never thought you'd sink to this level.",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about?",
        "Emily: You warned me, Dusty. You told me you would make sure the truth would come out. And you took something you knew was painful and private. And you decided to tell Chris in the most degrading way. I hope you're proud of yourself.",
        "Dusty: Anonymous notes aren't my style.",
        "Emily: Three people knew, Dusty. My mother, you and my sister. If you didn't write that note, then who the hell did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evan: What is with you, Chris? You've been out of it ever since you got here.",
        "Chris: It's Emily. We had a fight just before I left and I said some pretty hurtful things.",
        "Evan: Well, then kiss and make up, all right? The sooner the better, before people start thinking you're having second thoughts about our research project.",
        "Chris: You mind holding down the fort while I go find Emily?",
        "Evan: Do I have a choice?",
        "Lucinda: Hey beautiful --",
        "Lily: Hey! Hey.",
        "Lucinda: Look at you. You look like the cat that swallowed the canary.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Who cares who wrote it? The cat's out of the bag. Chris knows the truth. If he loves you as much as he says he does, what's the problem?",
        "Emily: Anyone would have a problem with it, Dusty. You did, remember?",
        "Dusty: Well, that was before I fell in love with you.",
        "Emily: Will you stop saying that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, would you care to share with me what's so funny I could use a good gloat myself.",
        "Lily: No, I'm here just having a good time at the party. Waiting for the real fun to start.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, what do you expect from this party, Honey?",
        "Lily: Let's just say I've finally taken one of your lessons to heart.",
        "Lucinda: Which of the many would that be?",
        "Lily: If you want something done right, take matters into your own hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: From the way you're acting, I guess Chris didn't take the news too well. What's his problem? Did he run away after he read the note?",
        "Emily: What else would you expect him to do?",
        "Dusty: Love you. For who you are and where you came from. Love you the way you deserve to be loved, for starters. He didn't do any of that, did he?",
        "Dusty: He reacted the way he did was because he doesn't love you.",
        "Emily: The only reason Chris reacted the way he did was because he's in shock. And I know that once he has time to process all of this -- he loves me, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Did he tell you that?",
        "Emily: Yes.",
        "Dusty: After he read the note?",
        "Emily: It doesn't matter.",
        "Dusty: You're right, it doesn't. Because you don't love him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Excuse me, have you guys seen Emily?",
        "Lucinda: No, haven't had the pleasure.",
        "Lily: Me either. Why? Is something wrong?",
        "Chris: If you happen to see her, can you just tell her I'm looking for her?",
        "Lucinda: Chris, I hope you don't mind me saying this -- yours and Memorial's. Focus on that wholly, forget about your love life. Keep your eye on the prize.",
        "Chris: That's exactly what I'm trying to do.",
        "Lucinda: What's the matter with that guy?",
        "Lily: Haven't a clue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Oh, now put that away. You're your usual gorgeous self.",
        "Barbara: I thought I felt something on my nose, that's all.",
        "Lisa: Oh, so just let me guess -- Sofie did not receive your gift gracefully.",
        "Barbara: I guess I can't blame her very much.",
        "Lisa: Oh, give her time.",
        "Barbara: That's the second time today someone has said that to me.",
        "Lisa: Well, then it must be very good advice.",
        "Barbara: Maybe I should start taking it.",
        "Lisa: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: What are you staring at, huh?",
        "Lisa: You. I don't know really how to say this.",
        "Barbara: Well, that's never stopped you before.",
        "Lisa: Well, well put. No, I'm just -- I'm concerned about you.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Lisa: Well, I don't know. Just, lately I've noticed that sometimes you sound funny.",
        "Barbara: Funny?",
        "Lisa: Yes. Well, at first, you know, I thought -- I thought maybe you bit your tongue, or maybe your cheek. Honey, it hasn't gone away.",
        "Barbara: And you've noticed this for sometime?",
        "Lisa: Yeah, I have. I'm really sorry I haven't said anything sooner. I think you should see a doctor.",
        "Barbara: Actually, I already have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Sofie.",
        "Sofie: Hi. You know, I'm really sorry, I don't want to bother you at this hour, but I need a favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: What did your doctor say?",
        "Barbara: I haven't really talked to anybody about this yet, so --",
        "Lisa: Well, Honey, talk to me.",
        "Waitress: Mrs. Grimaldi, they want you in the kitchen. It's something about the inspection tomorrow.",
        "Lisa: Oh, my Lord, I forgot all about it. We're having a -- okay, tell the chef not to worry, I will be in there shortly.",
        "Barbara: You go ahead --",
        "Lisa: No, no. I don't want to. No, I'll take care of that in just a minute. I want to talk to you. Please, tell me what did the doctor say?",
        "Barbara: Well, he ran some tests and --",
        "Lisa: What?",
        "Barbara: He said that I needed to have some dental work redone. Didn't think very much of my dentist.",
        "Lisa: Oh, well now, you see, now that you can certainly take care of. You just can't be too careful these days. I'm going to go out to the kitchen. The crisis in the kitchen. But, this conversation isn't over. It is to be continued.",
        "Barbara: Of course it is. I've got all the time in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I mean, of course, I couldn't take her money. I just --",
        "Gwen: No, no, I totally understand that. You at least need to let Lisa cut you a new check for the money that she owes you though.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I know, I know. I wasn't thinking clearly. But seeing your mother-in-law, and having her push her money on me, I just got me so --",
        "Gwen: No, and I understand. Barbara definitely has that kind of effect on people.",
        "Sofie: What I wanted to ask was -- could you or Will just talk to her and tell her to back off, please?",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. I would love to help, but I'm actually kind of in the middle of something myself right now. I'm --",
        "Sofie: Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't know I was interrupting something.",
        "Gwen: No, you're not. It's not -- Will and I were supposed to go to this seminar, and the babysitter that we hired cancelled and everybody I know seems to be busy tonight. So, I guess I just have to call him and tell him to take really good notes for me.",
        "Sofie: No, don't do that. I know someone who would be really happy to sit for Hallie.",
        "Gwen: You do? Who?",
        "Sofie: Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Dusty: You always say that when I get too close to home. I guess I'm getting close. Am I? Hey, you're not in love with Chris, you're in love with me. You couldn't make love to me the way you did on New Year's Eve if you were in love with Chris.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Sofie: She's beautiful, isn't she?",
        "Emily: Dusty Donovan, I will get payback for this if it's the last thing I do.",
        "Dusty: Come on, I don't need friends like you.",
        "Lily: Yeah, the feeling's mutual!",
        "Holden: Lily, what happened? Can you hear me? You go near her, you will regret it."
