        "Aaron: Well, it's too late to take it back now.",

        "Craig: It's okay. It's -- the trip from the hospital was a bit taxing.",
        "Lucy: It wasn't taxing. And unlike my legs, there is nothing wrong with \r\nmy hearing. I just -- I didn't expect the bellboys and the people at the front \r\ndesk to look at me like that.",
        "Craig: Well, I'll talk to them.",
