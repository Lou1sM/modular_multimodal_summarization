        "Jennifer: Mike? Honey, can you open this?",
        "Mike: Sure.",
        "Jennifer: Still got Katie and Henry on your mind?",
        "Mike: Just tossing the paper out. I could care less about Katie and Henry's fake wedding.",
        "Jennifer: Mm-hmm. Well, I'll get the wine glasses.",
        "Mike: Whoa, whoa. What did that mean?",
        "Jennifer: Katie and Henry. It's still making you nuts.",
        "Mike: Only because it's bogus. All right, she set up the whole thing just to get a rise out of me.",
        "Jennifer: And it's working.",
        "Mike: No, it's not. I just keep trying to figure it out. And then the kiss -- I mean, what's up with that kiss?",
        "Jennifer: Mm-hmm.",
        "Mike: Jen --",
        "Jennifer: All I'm saying is that for a guy who couldn't care less, you sure are giving it a lot of thought.",
        "Mike: I'm a thoughtful guy. You know what I'm thinking about right now?",
        "Jennifer: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Da, da, dum!",
        "Katie: I've been thinking --",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, so have I. You know, I know that we have picture frames for the guests, but I was thinking, what about shot glasses with our initials on 'em?",
        "Katie: I've been thinking about Mike.",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "Katie: He has got to be at the wedding.",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Katie: How else is he gonna stop it?",
        "Henry: We could send him an invitation.",
        "Katie: What if he doesn't show up? What then?",
        "Henry: We live happily ever after?",
        "Katie: Can you be serious?",
        "Henry: Okay, okay, all right, all right. What is the plan for getting Mike to interrupt our wedding?",
        "Katie: Simple. You'll get him to be your best man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, Detective Hughes. How's it going?",
        "Margo: Hey, Will. Sit. We got a report here of a brand-new car that was wrecked and abandoned out on route 24?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, we traced the tags to you.",
        "Will: Oh.",
        "Margo: Normally, I would go straight to your father with something like this, but I figured since Emily was just arrested, Hal's probably got enough on his plate -- so, I'm giving you a chance to explain yourself. Explain yourself.",
        "Will: I kinda lost control of the car, and it crashed.",
        "Margo: Really? 'Cause the lab guys kinda think you got out of the car and put it in gear and intentionally crashed it.",
        "Will: How can they tell that?",
        "Margo: Because that is what they do. Is that what you did?",
        "Will: I guess.",
        "Margo: And you didn't you even bother to report it?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, he did. To me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: I'll be right outside, Mrs. Munson.",
        "Emily: I promise I won't make a run for it. One of the perks of being the lieutenant's wife. No handcuffs, and everybody's really polite.",
        "Paul: Right. How're you doin'?",
        "Emily: I'm actually surprised you came back. I mean, even I thought I sounded sort of crazy, you know? Remembering but not remembering breaking into Fairwinds and doing those horrible things to Rosanna. It's like I know I did it. I know I was there, but I don't know why or how. How can I expect you to believe that?",
        "Paul: Actually, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Cut J.J. Loose? I thought you understood, Carly.",
        "Carly: I do. I do understand. I understand that things cannot go on the way they are, Jack, or everyone will be hurting, including J.J.",
        "Jack: Whether or not you see J.J. as my son, as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what he is. I'm not gonna walk away from him.",
        "Carly: I know that you wanna do right by J.J. because you love him. But if you are constantly torn up with guilt because you can't spend more time with him, J.J is gonna sense that --he and in a strange way, he is going to start feeling guilty himself.",
        "Jack: Right, so your solution is that I never see the kid again?",
        "Carly: Because of Julia. Because she is using her son and the love that you feel for him!",
        "Jack: Don't you think I know that?",
        "Carly: Well, do you really want him to grow up being used as his mother's weapon of choice?",
        "Jack: No, of course not!",
        "Carly: Well, then, stop her, Jack. J.J. is just the tip of the iceberg. And now she's even using Holden to stick it to you because you choose me instead of her.",
        "Jack: If Holden wants Julia, all the more power to him.",
        "Carly: It would be different if he was going after her, but he's not. She is coming on to him. Jack, if you really care about J.J., if you care about Holden, if you care about me and our children, you will recognize Julia for what she really is. She's toxic, Jack. And she is not gonna change. Now, is it really any surprise that Lily and I think the only answer is to get rid of her?",
        "Jack: All right, so what do you do? You set her up to look like a thief. And you expect me to approve?",
        "Carly: Fine, if you don't like my tactics, then use your own. Just get rid of her, Jack, before she destroys everything and everyone that you care about.",

        "[Lily fantasizing]",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Lily: Oh, you were sleeping.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I was dreaming about you.",
        "Lily: Really? I had to come. I had to tell you about Aaron.",
        "Holden: I'm glad you're here. I miss you. I love you.",
        "[Car horn blaring]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "julia: What are you thinking?",
        "Holden: That I have not felt this peaceful in a very long time. I mean, hey, here I am. I'm in mountains -- I got hiking, I got camping, I got fishing. I'm a changed man.",
        "Julia: Really? Well, if you'd rather be fishing, I'll get dressed. I'll help you saw a hole in the ice.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. You're not going anywhere.",
        "Julia: Hey -- I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Julia: I feel bad. Whatever's goin' on with you and Lily, I mean, I -- my needing you, making love to you, I'm sure it didn't help anything.",
        "Holden: It helped.",
        "Julia: You know what I mean.",
        "Holden: Well, I mean this. Don't be sorry. 'Cause I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I don't want her here.",
        "Margo: Who asked you? Sit down. Will, I just don't think you understand how much trouble you're in.",
        "Rosanna: What kind of trouble?",
        "Margo: You purchased the car he totaled?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Margo: And he told you that he deliberately crashed it?",
        "Will: Yeah, I told her.",
        "Rosanna: Will, you've made it exceptionally clear you want nothing to do with me, but if you value your freedom, perhaps you should stop confessing to the detective. [Rosanna sighs] where does he stand legally?",
        "Will: I can take care of myself.",
        "Margo: Well, you'd better start figuring out how because you are in a whole lot of trouble.",
        "Will: Why, because I crashed a car? People do that every day.",
        "Margo: Yes, they do, but unlike you, they do it accidentally, and unlike you, they report it, and unlike you, they clean up their mess and have it towed away.",
        "Will: So I'll pay for the charges. What does it cost? A couple hundred bucks?",
        "Margo: Try a couple of thousand, and we're not even starting with the criminal charges -- [cell phone rings] excuse me.",
        "Rosanna: Look, Will, I know you were upset with me, but did you have to crash the car? You could have just refused the gift. Why do something so malicious when I was just trying to be kind?",
        "Will: Trying to be kind? Yeah, I guess that really nails it. Because it's so hard to do, because you hate my guts.",
        "Rosanna: No, I don't.",
        "Will: Just stop trying to be kind, okay? I know you can't stand me. And then you buy me this car, and --",
        "Rosanna: Just tell me. What?",
        "Will: That car had nothing to do with me. You were just trying to impress Paul. You're trying to make nice to his kid brother and -- did you think I was too dense to figure it out?",
        "Rosanna: Do you think that's -- that's why you wrecked the car? Because you thought it was some kind of bribe? All I want is for her to be gone. For her not to exist at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: I should go --",
        "Holden: All right.",
        "Julia: I don't want the kids to come in. Luke or J.J., if they walk in here and see me with you. I have to go back to my own bed.",
        "Holden: All right, but not yet. Okay.",
        "Julia: Okay. What? What's the matter?",
        "Holden: I thought I heard a car door slam.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lily: Holden?",
        "Holden: It's Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm sorry for getting upset. It's just -- it really means a lot to me that you believe me. I mean, my own husband doesn't really believe me.",
        "Paul: All right -- hey -- don't fall apart on me, okay? We've got work to do. Sit down.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Paul: You ready?",
        "Emily: Yeah, let's get to work.",
        "Paul: Okay. So this is what we know. You were sick, or feeling sick, when you supposedly broke into Fairwinds.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I told you. I had the flu or something.",
        "Paul: Right, but you don't think you went to a doctor?",
        "Emily: I told you, I think I made an appointment. Hal wanted me to go. But I kept thinking whatever I had was gonna go away, so I --",
        "Paul: And you couldn't have drawn the map that we found on you of Fairwinds because you didn't know the layout.",
        "Emily: No. I still don't. It's changed too much.",
        "Paul: So somebody must've been feeding you information. Somebody must have gotten you to put Cabot's toys out, trying to scare Rosanna. Somebody who wanted to shake up all up, and -- somebody who wanted Will out of my house.",
        "Emily: Barbara.",
        "Paul: Well, she did have motive, and the proximity to you.",
        "Emily: Why? And she was so nice to me.",
        "Paul: Emily, do you remember anything that my mother said about Rosanna or Fairwinds? Concentrate. Because if you can't remember something that links my mother to what happened to Rosanna, then I don't know if I can help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Run away with me.",
        "Mike: Any particular place in mind?",
        "Jennifer: New York. Just for a week or so. Paul and Jordan want to expand the marketplace for Street Jeans anyway. So we can sell some jeans. See some shows -- make some love. Could you take a week off of work?",
        "Mike: To spend a romantic week with you? Oh yeah. When?",
        "Jennifer: How about Valentine's week?",
        "Mike: Valentine's?",
        "Jennifer: It's romantic.",
        "Mike: That's when Katie and Henry are tying the knot. Valentine's day, remember?",
        "Jennifer: Vaguely.",
        "Mike: And you want me out of town before the wedding, because --",
        "Jennifer: Now you've got me obsessing, too. Who knows what Katie's up to next? And if you're not here --",
        "Mike: Whatever Katie says or does, it doesn't matter.",
        "Jennifer: Why not?",
        "Mike: Because you are my valentine.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Henry: Crack up the bubbly, buddy. These are for you, doll-face.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you.",
        "Mike: What are we celebrating?",
        "Henry: My wedding. And the man whose gonna keep me calm, hold the ring, and make the toast.",
        "Mike: Henry --",
        "Henry: Yes. You, Mike Kasnoff, you are my best man. Now, pop that cork!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Paul put pressure on you to make things right with me, and you thought by bribing me with the car, it would do the trick.",
        "Rosanna: All right. Yeah, that's partly true. Money usually works for me. It gets people to like me, or do what I want them to do -- sometimes even say they love me, even if they don't mean it.",
        "Will: And what was it supposed to get me to do?",
        "Rosanna: It was supposed to get you to forgive me for thinking that you would use Cabot's death to hurt me.",
        "Will: I told you I didn't do it.",
        "Rosanna: I know, but I just couldn't see it. I could hear what you were saying. I was just -- I felt too guilty.",
        "Will: Why? You didn't kill Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: No, but I didn't save him, either. And every reminder of him -- it was brutal. You gotta know what that's like.",
        "Will: To feel guilty?",
        "Rosanna: To need forgiveness. Can you forgive me, Will?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Sometimes I watch you sleep sometimes, too. And I thank God that I was lucky enough to find my way home to you and our kids. Julia's not a part of that, Carly.",
        "Carly: As long as she's living in this town, she's a part of our life. Do you really think that she brought over that sexy little nightie for some kind of closure, Jack? She wanted me to see it. She wanted me to imagine her in it. To imagine the two of you --",
        "Jack: Okay. Listen, you gotta let it go.",
        "Carly: I could if she would, but she can't. And if she cannot have you to herself, she's gonna see to it that we are not happy together.",
        "Jack: She's not making us unhappy, honey, you are. Instead of enjoying our lives, all we do is talk about Julia.",
        "Jack: What do you expect me to do?",
        "Carly: Get her away from us, Jack! Another town. Another state. Because if you don't, I swear to you, nothing can ever be the same between us.",
        "Jack: Is that an ultimatum?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Wait.",
        "Lily: You were sleeping.",
        "Holden: Yeah. What are you doing here?",
        "Lily: Well, there's no service up here and phone, and I had to tell you about Aaron. He's fine. Everything's gonna be fine, but he collapsed.",
        "Holden: What happened?",
        "Lily: He had a blood clot on his brain. They had to do emergency surgery, but he's gonna be okay. But I knew you'd want to be there when he woke up.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. All right, I'll tell you what -- give me some time to deal with Luke and J.J. And then I'll head back. I'll be right behind you.",
        "Lily: Where is Jack and the boys?",
        "Holden: The boys are out in the back cabin, and Jack, he had to head home.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Julia: Hi.",
        "Lily: What's she doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Carly: I can't promise you that I'm gonna stop trying to get Julia out of our lives.",
        "Jack: You're serious?",
        "Mike: Why are you here?",
        "Henry: I am here to ask you to be my --",
        "Mike: No. Are you sure it's not because Katie sent you? This isn't some little ploy to get me into the wedding party?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How could I be so stupid? Of course you would come here. You have to tell Holden your side of the story about what happened at Emma's before I could give him mine.",
        "Holden: Lily, stop.",
        "Julia: You know, its okay. Look, initially, I came here because I wanted to pick up my son. I was so embarrassed by what you and Carly did to me -- making me look like a thief in front of Emma. I just wanted to get away from all of you.",
        "Holden: That's understandable.",
        "Julia: But after I told Holden the whole story, and Jack --",
        "Lily: I do feel bad about what happened.",
        "Julia: It doesn't matter. Okay, it's not important. What's important right now is Aaron. I heard what you were saying as I came in. Is he gonna be okay? You sure?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Holden: Lily and I need to get Luke and head back.",
        "Julia: Okay, well, I'm just gonna stay with J.J. I think waking him up in the middle of the night and Jack not being here would just upset him.",
        "Holden: Okay. Just make yourself comfortable. We should go wake up Luke. He's in the back. Thank you. For being so understanding -- about everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm not giving you an ultimatum, Jack. What could I possibly threaten you with? That I'll leave you? We both know I never could.",
        "Jack: It's okay. Come here.",
        "Carly: I just -- I just want things to go back to the way they were before you went over that bridge. Before there was a Julia Larrabee.",
        "Jack: Sometimes it gets to me, too, honey. The way Julia's handling this J.J. thing, making him feel abandoned, making me feel guilty. I hate it, but, you know, you're not going to make it better by pulling the kind of stunt that you and Lily pulled today.",
        "Carly: I didn't know what else to do.",
        "Jack: It's gotta be rough, what you're going through. I can only imagine. But we've gotta work this through together. I need you to make me a promise.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: No more dirty tricks. Hmm? I need you to promise me that you'll never do anything to undermine Julia again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Katie, of all the men in the world you choose to marry, you choose Henry Coleman? What are you thinking?",
        "Katie: Well, he proposed and he's my friend and he would do anything for me.",
        "Margo: Oh, but Katie.",
        "Katie: Margo, listen. Simon, I loved and he left. Mike, I loved, and he doesn't want me. Maybe it's time for me to marry somebody who loves me enough to stick around.",
        "Margo: No, no, you can't do this.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Margo: Because life is unpredictable. And when you choose to go on a journey like this with someone, you need to it to be someone that you will love through -- someone that you would want to make love to. That would want to make love to you. You and Henry haven't --",
        "Katie: No. No.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Katie: I mean, we're -- we're waiting. You know -- till it's special.",
        "Margo: Is Henry blackmailing you?",
        "Katie: No!",
        "Margo: Then why would you want to marry a guy who, at best, is a good-hearted bamboozler, but at worst is really --",
        "Katie: Margo, this is my future husband you're talking about, the man whose only mission in life is to make me happy, and to think I was going to ask you to be my matron of honor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Me as your best man? Why?",
        "Henry: Well, who else would I ask?",
        "Mike: I don't know. Maybe someone who's never been engaged to your fianc\u00e9e before.",
        "Henry: Oh!",
        "Jennifer: I'm gonna go get glasses --.",
        "Mike: Stay. Henry's just leaving.",
        "Henry: Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Don't you want to even think about this? I mean, I thought we were friends, mike.",
        "Mike: We are. Look, I can't do it anyway. Jen and I are gonna be out of town the week of the wedding.",
        "Henry: What? What do you mean you're gonna be -- why didn't you say anything about this? Where are you going? When did you make these plans?",
        "Jennifer: Just now. We're going to New York for Valentine's Day.",
        "Henry: New York? Can't you put this off?",
        "Mike: Henry, I am not going to be your best man. Find somebody else.",
        "Henry: Who else, mike? It's not like I hang around with a bunch of guys. I mean, you're kind of it in the friend department, you know?",
        "Jennifer: Mike, maybe we should --",
        "Mike: Absolutely not. We made plans, okay? Why are you really here?",
        "Henry: I am here to ask you to be my --",
        "Mike: No, are you sure it's not because Katie sent you? This isn't some little ploy to get me into the wedding party?",
        "Henry: Is that what you think? That is so wrong. I love Katie just as much as you do -- as you did. Maybe even more. And I never dreamt in a million years she would agree to marry me, but she has, and this is real.",
        "Jennifer: Henry, we're sorry --",
        "Henry: My one and only wedding. I always had an image of how it would be -- Katie, a vision, my best friend standing up for me there. But, you know, if you can't make it. Have a fun in New York City.",
        "Jennifer: What do you think?",
        "Mike: That he's full of it.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm not so sure. I mean, maybe -- maybe you should --",
        "Mike: Well, you didn't get very far.",

        "Mike: Is this really for real?",
        "Henry: I want to spend the rest of my life with Katie. That's about as real as it gets, Mike.",
        "Mike: Well, if you're ordering the tuxes, I'm a 40 regular.",
        "Henry: Are you down for this?",
        "Mike: Yeah, we'll make sure your wedding goes off without a hitch.",
        "Henry: You know, you really are the best man that I know!",
        "Jennifer: Well, he looks happy.",
        "Mike: I'll be happy, too, if you go to the wedding with me.",

        "Emily: I told you how Barbara acted when I was sick. She was amazing. She took care of everything. She would make breakfast, lunch, and dinner. She would clean the house. She would do everything. I would get out of bed and help, and she'd put me right back into bed. She'd make me this tea and tell me the only way I was going to get well was to get plenty of sleep.",
        "Paul: Okay, but my mother didn't mention anything about Rosanna?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Paul: Or Fairwinds?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Paul: You were with her all the time. What did she talk to you about?",
        "Emily: I don't remember! Okay? I don't remember.",
        "Paul: Emily, I'm trying to help you, all right? But you gotta try and help yourself here.",
        "Emily: I'm trying! All I remember is that Barbara was really kind to me.",
        "Paul: That doesn't make any sense. She has nothing but resentment for you. She hates that you're married to Hal, she can't stand that fact you're living in what she thinks is her house.",
        "Emily: I know! I can't stand her, either. I mean, we're constantly taking jabs at each other. That's why this doesn't make any sense. The entire time I was sick, I don't remember one unkind word from her. She was -- she was nice!",
        "Paul: And your memory is all messed up.",
        "[Emily sighs]",
        "Emily: Oh, God.",
        "Paul: What if you got out of here and went home?",
        "Emily: To my house?",
        "Paul: Well, that's where you lost all these memories. Maybe that's where you'll get 'em back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So there's one person in the world who doesn't like you. So what?",
        "Rosanna: So that one person happens to be my husband's brother. How do you think pail feels that you won't come around and talk him or see him and that I'm the cause of that?",
        "Will: After a while. Maybe --",
        "Rosanna: You know, if you want to be angry with the world for the rest of your life, that's your business. But to push people away who love you and are trying to help you, it's just cruel. I'm not those kids at school and neither is Paul. And just so you know, I was going to tell Margo that the car had faulty brakes and that I will pay for any expenses incurred.",
        "Will: Do you want me to say \"thank you\"?",
        "Rosanna: You know, if you've decided that my assistance is so distasteful you'd rather end up back at the hospital -- just say the word. And I walk away. Just say no.",

        "Margo: Katie, you want me to be your matron of honor in this?",
        "Katie: Not if you're going to keep dissing my groom and my wedding.",
        "Margo: All right, listen. Katie, I know that you can be impulsive -- don't cry -- and if you want me to be at the wedding -- don't cry -- then that is where I'll be. Please, just don't cry.",
        "Henry: Hey! It's my future sister-in-law.",
        "Margo: Don't call me that.",
        "Henry: Mission accomplished. Mike said yes to being the best man. Isn't that great?",
        "Margo: Oh. I get it.",
        "Katie: Mike is Henry's best friend.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. So this isn't a marriage. This is about getting Mike to be jealous. Hmm?",
        "Henry: I take exception.",
        "Katie: Henry, let me handle this. Henry and I really are getting married.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. Well, you're gonna have to do it without me.",

        "Jack: Have you thought about what I asked?",
        "Carly: I thought about it. And I really wish that I could give you the answer that you want. But I can't. I can't promise you that I'm gonna stop trying to get Julia out of our lives.",
        "Jack: You're serious?",
        "Carly: You don't see how manipulative she is, and that terrifies me. And if you're gonna close your eyes to this, then I guess it's up to me to deal with her. Because there is no way that I'm gonna risk of losing you again.",

        "Holden: That's okay. I want him to come with me, since we had to cut our father-son trip short.",
        "Luke: I left something in the cabin. I'll see you in the car, Dad.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Lily: I guess that settled that.",
        "Holden: Why don't you go on ahead. I have to wait for Julia. I need to tell a few things about closing up the cabin.",
        "Lily: Okay. I'll see you and Luke back at the hospital.",
        "Holden: Lily -- I want to thank you for coming out here -- for everything.",
        "Lily: I'd do anything for you. I'll see you back at the hospital. Good night.",
        "Holden: Thank you for being so generous.",
        "Julia: Oh, come on, I meant what I said, Aaron's what's important.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but you were discrete about what happened.",
        "Julia: We don't even know what we're doing. I mean, why would I throw it in Lily's face?",
        "Holden: What we're doing -- is amazing, and I have no regrets about what happened between us. Lily and I are separated. I just didn't want to tell her anything tonight, with everything that happened to Aaron.",
        "Julia: No, hey, look, in case you're wondering, I have no expectations.",
        "Holden: Expect to be doing this a lot from now on.",

        "Mike: Are you sure you're okay with me being best man at Katie's wedding? I know this is a little weird.",
        "Jennifer: Actually, I feel pretty good about it.",
        "Mike: Why?",
        "Jennifer: Because you cared what I thought. And you were willing to take a week off of work and go to New York just to make me happy.",
        "Mike: It's only fair. I get happy every time I see you.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. You really are the best man.",

        "Katie: No, are you kidding? I am going to show Margo and Tom and Mike and Jennifer and everyone else that I am serious about this marriage. We are going to throw the best wedding Oakdale's ever seen.",

        "Rosanna: Will, if you'd like to come over, I know Paul would love to spend some time with you. And I could cook. Or you two could go out if you prefer.",

        "Rosanna: Well, I could make sandwiches.",

        "Rosanna: Better. How'd things go with Emily?",
        "Paul: I'm not sure. She's gonna be out on bail soon, and when she gets back to her house, I think I have an idea about what could trigger her memory and get to the truth about what really happened.",

        "Carly: Jack, there was a time that I would have lied to you. I would have sworn up and down that I'd leave Julia alone, and then the minute your back was turned --",
        "Jack: Right. So I should be happy that you honestly don't trust me to take care of this?",
        "Carly: Is it so wrong for me to want to do what's best for my family? For me to admit that I will do anything that I have to do to protect us?",
        "Jack: I don't need your protection.",
        "Carly: Jack.",
