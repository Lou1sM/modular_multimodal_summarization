        "Lily: Have you girls decided what kind of cookies you're going to make?",
        "Faith: Chocolate chip?",
        "Morgan: Can we? They're totally my favorite.",
        "Faith: Mine, too.",
        "Lily: Oh, I thought these where for the band bake sale?",
        "Morgan: Don't worry. We'll save some.",
        "Lily: Okay, chocolate chips. I know where the chocolate chips are. Emma -- okay, we have -- let's see -- oh, good, good stash. We've got white chocolate and dark chocolate. You girls are in business.",
        "Morgan: This kitchen's awesome.",
        "Faith: I know. Old stuff looks so much prettier than new stuff.",
        "Lily: And Faith's grandmother is the best, best cook in town. So I knew she'd have everything that we needed.",
        "Faith: So, why don't we have this stuff at home?",
        "Lily: Yeah, a cupboard full of chocolate. I would have to buy a whole new wardrobe.",
        "Faith: Then you better chill with these.",
        "Lily: What can I say, I have a little bit of sweet tooth.",
        "Morgan: My mom blisses out on chocolate, too. Isn't it so cute?",
        "Faith: Let's measure the flour.",
        "Lily: Okay. I'm going to -- I'm going to give Stormy an apple. The oven is on 375, the aprons are in the drawer.",
        "Faith: We're not five, and we're not eighty, okay?",
        "Lily: Okay. Call me if you need me. Hi.",
        "Lucinda: Hey. Hi, Honey. That's a nice healthy snack.",
        "Lily: It's for the horse. Stormy, Faith's horse. That horse likes me more than Faith.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, for heaven's sake, your daughter just wants to be different in any way that she can. Different from you, and it's normal.",
        "Lily: She's very critical. Very critical. Very -- was I that harsh at that age?",
        "Lucinda: You were much much worse. Trust me.",
        "Lily: Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all that. I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier. I just can't stand the way that Faith looks at me right now.",
        "Lucinda: It's all going to change.",
        "Lily: Don't tell me to be patient.",
        "Lucinda: No. No, I have zero interest in patience at the moment. I've got a plan. Yes, it's a plan. It will get you back to being yourself again before you can say trans fat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What, what are you doing? Tom, stop, stop, get back in bed! Stop --",
        "Tom: I was dreaming about Daniel -- I can see his face.",
        "Margo: Please, lie down. Lie down. Lie down.",
        "Tom: I need to get out of here and look for him. Look, he needs me right now.",
        "Margo: We all need you! You take one step out of here and you're a dead man walking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I knew this would happen. I knew it. Tull's a no show. What now?",
        "Dusty: We wait.",
        "Emily: We wait? I can't sit here and wait! The longer my son is gone, the less of a chance there is they're ever going to find him.",
        "Dusty: Take a deep breath.",
        "Emily: Tell me I'm wrong.",
        "Dusty: Tull wants your shares of the Intruder. He wouldn't have taken Daniel if he didn't.",
        "Emily: We don't know for sure if Tull is actually the one that took Daniel. For all we know, it was Craig. Maybe for once, he did his own dirty work.",
        "Dusty: Here we go. Mr. Tull, I'm a friend of Emily's, Dusty Donovan.",
        "Tull: Are you ready to do business?",
        "Emily: If you are.",
        "Tull: Is that the paperwork?",
        "Emily: Yes. It's right here. It's a complete transfer of the newspaper. I signed over all my shares to you.",
        "Tull: It doesn't look like you signed anything. What's the snag?",
        "Dusty: Her kid.",
        "Tull: What the hell does that supposed to mean?",
        "Dusty: It means you get her signature when you give up her kid. Those are the terms. No Daniel, no deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Meg! Meg! Thank goodness you're still here. I was afraid you've gone home.",
        "Meg: Well, I am going home after I update these charts --",
        "Barbara: No, no, you can't do that.",
        "Meg: Excuse me?",
        "Barbara: It's Paul. His situation has gone from bad to worse. He has isolated himself. He's up in that cabin that he went to after he was shot.",
        "Meg: The one in the woods?",
        "Barbara: Yes. Where you took him to help him heal. He's gone there, I think. That's part of the reason. I think he wants to feel close to you.",
        "Meg: Is that supposed to make me feel guilty?",
        "Barbara: He's all alone. He's hopeless.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm sorry, but you need to leave me out of this.",
        "Barbara: He's having some kind of breakdown. I don't know if it's physical or emotional --",
        "Meg: I can't make this my problem anymore, Barbara. Okay, the days of me rescuing Paul are over.",
        "Barbara: Please, please, please -- you can get through to him. Maybe you're the only person who can.",
        "Meg: Listen to me. I am not going back to that cabin ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Look, I'm going to call Jack, let him know that you're okay --",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Paul: Parker, what's wrong?",
        "Parker: I'm not going back there and you can't make me.",
        "Paul: Parker -- your mother.",
        "Parker: Why did you say that?",
        "Paul: It's hard to explain, but I saw something just now.",
        "Parker: What's going on? You're acting really freaky.",
        "Paul: Something's wrong. I think your mother's gotten herself into some serious trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Just put the cuffs on me, Jack. I was hoping that things wouldn't end this way.",
        "Jack: How'd you expect it to end, Carly? With the kids waving good-bye to you at the airport, wishing you luck in your new life?",
        "Carly: Does that really matter now? What are you waiting for? Just do it.",
        "Jack: I've got a better idea. Catch.",
        "Carly: What are you doing, Jack?",
        "Simon: I'm not cuffing Carly, if that's what you want.",
        "Jack: Not Carly. Me.",
        "Simon: You?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Cuff me to this.",
        "Simon: You're joking, right?",
        "Jack: Nope. And you're going to have to knock me out first.",
        "Carly: No. Just wait a minute --",
        "Jack: We don't have time to argue about this. Your window is like 30 minutes, tops.",
        "Simon: Okay, 30 minutes we're not even close to the plane.",
        "Jack: Then you better get moving, Simon.",
        "Simon: Using this, all right, this is what you're asking me to do. You want me to knock you out?",
        "Carly: No, just wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You're talking about my mom being arrested, right?",
        "Paul: I didn't know about that.",
        "Parker: Then why did you say she was in trouble?",
        "Paul: Sometimes I see things. And it doesn't -- well, I don't even know what they mean -- but it seems like I can tell when something bad is going to happen.",
        "Parker: Something bad's happening right now. Jack's probably driving my mom to the police station.",
        "Paul: Well, how do you know that?",
        "Parker: Because I busted her. I let him know where to find her.",
        "Paul: You turned in your own mom?",
        "Parker: She wanted my brother J.J. to promise not to tell anyone about the secret meeting she wanted to have with us. But I heard him on the phone and I knew it was her. She wanted to talk to us before she ran away again.",
        "Paul: Ran away where?",
        "Parker: I don't know. Somewhere with Simon. She says she loves us but she's running away to be with him.",
        "Paul: Well, I'm sure she does love you.",
        "Parker: Yeah? Then why is she leaving us?",
        "Paul: Well, there's probably more to it than that.",
        "Parker: Like what? He forced her? No way.",
        "Paul: Or convinced her it was for the best.",
        "Parker: For her, you mean.",
        "Paul: Look, Parker, sometimes people screw up. Even if they do love you more than anything.",
        "Parker: If they screw up, they're supposed to do something about it. They're supposed to try to make it right!",
        "Paul: Yeah, but what if they don't know what is right? What if they're in the middle of something crazy or scary or weird and it's got nothing to do with the people that they love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I will go to the mat with you on this one. You are not going to go against what your father said, what the cardiologist warned you about --",
        "Tom: This is not time to try to avoid stress. Not until Daniel is safe.",
        "Margo: I know. But if you go charging out of here, and you have another heart attack, then what does Daniel have to come home to? Haven't we been to enough funerals lately?",
        "Tom: Yes, we have.",
        "Margo: And I hate like hell that you have to lie here while your son is missing, but the rest of us --- the rest of us have to do the heavy lifting for now.",
        "Tom: Then just tell me how is the search being handled.",
        "Margo: You don't need to know the details. You just have to trust me and know that Dallas and the other uniforms are out there looking.",
        "Tom: You know that I blame myself for this.",
        "Margo: I know you do and you should stop.",
        "Tom: No, I should've said no to Emily when she said she wanted to take Daniel away for a couple of days. I had a weird feeling, and I should have said no.",
        "Margo: I know, but you were just trying to be fair.",
        "Tom: No, I was tired and I was trying to avoid the drama that goes along with saying no to Emily.",
        "Margo: Well, there is no right answer when it comes to Emily.",
        "Tom: Does Emily still believe that Craig is behind this?",
        "Margo: Honey, I don't know. I don't know. But I talked to Craig, and I think he's clean this time.",
        "Tom: Well, if he's not responsible, who is?",
        "Margo: Why don't you just let me worry about that?",
        "Tom: Dammit, Margo! You tell me what the hell is going on, or I will check myself out of here tonight!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tull: What are you trying to pull? You said you wanted to dump your shares of the Intruder. I bring a check.",
        "Dusty: Emily needs to know where her son is.",
        "Emily: Oh, God, just tell me you haven't hurt my son. Please just tell me.",
        "Tull: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Dusty: You don't know the police are looking for Daniel Hughes?",
        "Tull: Not until now.",
        "Emily: If you know where he is --",
        "Tull: Well, I don't. And even if I did, how do I know that you guys aren't wearing a wire? Maybe your cop friends are listening in -- with no plans to hand anything over to me other than a --",
        "Emily: No, no, no. There's no plan. Look, nobody knows -- nobody knows we're here. It's just us.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing? Here.",
        "Tull: That's better.",
        "Emily: It's everything you wanted. Take it.",
        "Dusty: You're giving away our leverage.",
        "Emily: I don't have a choice. I want to get my son back.",
        "Tull: Well, there, everything looks like it's in order --",
        "Emily: Okay, fine. Now tell me where he is!",
        "Tull: Sorry, but I don't know.",
        "Emily: You have to know! Tell me where my son is.",
        "Tull: I don't know. Although, come to think of it, you know there was a kid last fall, went missing. Paper said he was found in an empty warehouse on Mill Street. You know, the one that they make cardboard boxes? But I'm sure the cops have looked there, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Now, the reason you're having so much difficulty with the situation, is because you spend so much of every day, every minute, taking care of everyone else -- you go from wretched Jade, to Luke, to the baby, to Natalie, to darling Faith --",
        "Lily: I'm a mother. That's what I'm supposed to do, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you're not supposed to turn yourself into a drudge.",
        "Lily: Oh, wait a minute, that's not nice --",
        "Lucinda: Yes, do you want to be one of those women who disappear into their children's lives? That's not healthy. It's not healthy for you, it's not healthy for the child. You need to concentrate on something and focus something outside the immediate family.",
        "Lily: I love my family. I love my life.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you're so happy, right now --",
        "Lily: That's not -- it's not about, the family is not making me unhappy. It's me. It's how I feel right now.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you are beautiful. You look wonderful. And maybe because you're restless, or possibly because you are little bit bored -- you are just obsessing about your appearance.",
        "Lily: Well, what do you suggest?",
        "Lucinda: I want you to come work with me at Worldwide.",
        "Lily: What? How? How? Ethan is not even a year old. And I missed the first few months of his life.",
        "Lucinda: You bring him along. Bring him along. We'll have an executive nursery right next to your office.",
        "Lily: I will be the most popular person working there.",
        "Lucinda: Well, don't you be negative. We'll do every thing the way you want it to be.",
        "Lily: It's a pity hire.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling, don't do that. Don't insult both of us. My plan is that you will develop a product line for children.",
        "Lily: It is my area of expertise these days.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, yes. And you can channel everything that you know. Everything that you've read. We all know about the mommy track. We know how people will spend obscene amounts of money on anything that is baby- oriented. And Honey, you've been in the eye of the storm.",
        "Lily: That's true.",
        "Lucinda: Well, when do you start?",
        "Lily: I didn't say yes quite yet.",
        "Holden: To what?",
        "Lucinda: I want Lily to come and work with me at Worldwide.",
        "Holden: Really?",
        "Lily: Yeah, so, what do you think?",
        "Holden: Honestly?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Holden: I hope you turn it down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: How do you do that and stay so skinny. I mean, you eat anything you want.",
        "Morgan: Maybe it's the dancing. I mean, look at Tea. She's perfect.",
        "Faith: Yeah, but Tea dances eight hours a day. And you take one class a week. Plus, you have candy bars stashed in your backpack.",
        "Morgan: I guess I just burn it off.",
        "Faith: You don't think about it, do you?",
        "Morgan: Nobody in my family really gains weight. I'm exactly like my mom. She always says, like mother, like daughter.",
        "Faith: Not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Have you lost your mind, Jack?",
        "Jack: No, the escape has to look genuine, so you're going to have to make sure that I'm out cold.",
        "Carly: Jack, are you sure this is what you want?",
        "Jack: Well, I wanted to shoot Simon. But since you care about him, I've decided to let him live.",
        "Simon: This is a trick, right?",
        "Jack: No, just do whatever -- do what you got to do, okay? Just get it over with.",
        "Simon: This, so you can add resisting arrest and assault to the charges?",
        "Jack: This is not about you! This is about Parker, and J.J., and Sage. They know I'm meeting you here. If I let you walk, then they're going to be questioned about me. So, it has to look real.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never wanted J.J. to have to lie.",
        "Jack: We're past that.",
        "Carly: And I know that I've made this so much worse. I just wanted to see my kids, Jack. I wanted to hold them. And look at their faces and tell them how much I love them. Please, promise me that you'll tell them.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I will. As many times as they need to hear it. Now turn around so Simon can do what he needs to do, before I change my mind.",
        "Simon: Are you okay with this? I'm sorry, Jack.",
        "Jack: Me too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You want me to give my mom a pass.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I think you should cut your mom some slack. Sit down.",
        "Parker: I've been doing that since I was born.",
        "Paul: Okay, then, so what's one more time?",
        "Parker: It's just, everything in my mother's life matters more to her than her kids.",
        "[Paul sighs]",
        "Paul: Parker, loving Simon doesn't mean she doesn't love you or your brother or your sister.",
        "Parker: She had a choice to make and she picked him.",
        "Paul: Do you really want your mom to go to prison?",
        "Parker: Do you know how many promises she's broken?",
        "Paul: I'm sorry.",
        "Parker: Paul?",
        "Paul: Parker, I -- I think you're wrong about your mom. They didn't lock her up.",
        "Parker: What do you mean?",
        "Paul: Carly didn't go to jail, she got away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I know how Paul operates. He'll go to any extreme to get what he wants. And right now that's me!",
        "Barbara: No, thank God he went to extremes, because he stopped you from drinking contaminated water!",
        "Meg: Yes, but there are layers to that, Barbara, and I don't want to sort through them anymore, okay? Just try and get that.",
        "Barbara: You almost died. Do you get that?",
        "Meg: So now you want to believe that your son is some kind of hero instead of a crazy recluse?",
        "Barbara: Do you really think that he would put innocent people in danger to make himself look good?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I wouldn't put anything past him.",
        "Barbara: Okay. Let me tell you what happened here this afternoon, all right? I was in the corridor, I tripped over a hospital cart. I mowed down an orderly. And then Paul told me that he'd had a vision earlier when I touched him of someone falling and blood going everywhere, and that's what happened. I fell. I fell. Blood was spattered everywhere, exactly the way Paul saw it. Exactly that way.",
        "Meg: So that's the proof. Something he told you after the fact.",
        "Barbara: He's been right too many times, Meg. You can't keep dismissing that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, Dallas likes this guy Marcus Tull for the grab. Apparently, he tried to strong-arm Emily into selling her shares of \"The Intruder,\" but she shut him down.",
        "Tom: Is he clean?",
        "Margo: He has no priors, airtight alibi --",
        "Tom: Which means nothing. Have you picked him up yet?",
        "Margo: No, not yet.",
        "Tom: Then what the hell are waiting -- waiting for?",
        "Margo: Honey, I love you so much and I hate like hell that you're lying here helpless with Danny out there, but now is not the time to tell me how to do my job.",
        "Tom: You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Now I was just about to check in with Dallas and see if he's made any progress.",
        "Tom: Could you get me a fresh glass of water while you're out there?",
        "Margo: Sure, of course I will. Anything else?",
        "Tom: Yeah. A newspaper. Am I allowed?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Arts and leisure only.",

        "Emily: Oh God, as horrible as this place is, I hope he's here. Oh God, please be here!",
        "Dusty: Hey, you got to stay calm, all right? For Daniel. He's scared enough. You don't want to make things worse.",
        "Emily: You're right, you're right.",
        "Dusty: And he might be in bad shape, all right? Got to be ready for everything.",
        "Emily: As long as he's alive, nothing else matters. Oh God. Daniel? Honey, can you answer me? It's your mother. Oh God. Daniel, are you here? No! No, Dusty, no!",
        "Emily: It's Daniel's. Oh God, my sweet little boy.",
        "Dusty: Then you know he was here.",
        "Emily: We're too late.",
        "Dusty: Maybe not. Let's make sure.",
        "Emily: I don't get it. I don't get it. Tull got everything he wanted. What good is Daniel to him now?",
        "Dusty: I don't know.",
        "Emily: Why don't you know, Dusty? This whole thing was your idea. Where is my son? Where is my little boy?",
        "Dusty: I want you to stay here for a few minutes by yourself.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Dusty: Can you do that? Without falling apart?",
        "Emily: What are you doing?",
        "Dusty: Don't worry about it. Just stay here and don't move.",

        "Barbara: Meg, I was skeptical about Paul at first, too, but when he kept being right about things --",
        "Meg: Barbara, he wasn't all that different before the accident. He could always predict the worst case scenario.",
        "Barbara: And that's my fault. I spent his childhood telling him cautionary tales about his father.",
