        "Brad: Come on, Peretti, we gotta get the show -- on the road. No, no, no. Come on, come on. Come on, don't let me rush you.",
        "Katie: I need my key. You need to stop barging in on me like this.",
        "Brad: But what if there's an emergency and you need something unzipped, unhooked, because your arms can't reach?",
        "Katie: Brad, now!",
        "Brad: I don't know what you're so upset about. I mean, it's not like I haven't seen it all before.",
        "Katie: Yes, but that was before when we were friends. And now -- well, friends don't let friends see them naked.",
        "Brad: That's where you're wrong. That's where you have a very limited view of friendship.",
        "Katie: We need to re-set boundaries and rules. Set some ground rules --",
        "Brad: When we were trying to make a baby, we passed all the boundaries. We broke all the rules. And a few pieces of furniture, remember?",
        "Katie: But that was in the past.",
        "Brad: You can't put toothpaste back in the tube.",
        "Katie: No, but you can throw it out and start over. And don't touch anything!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So, when did we develop this uncanny ability to clear a room?",
        "Margo: I warned you about that joke.",
        "Tom: Are we really that boring?",
        "Margo: Oh, no. I don't think so. I think it's just that Donovan has this uncanny ability to create unnecessary excitement wherever he goes.",
        "Tom: Yeah, said he was going to be stopping by with his so-called proof -- looks like he just ran out of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dusty is in the room using a phone and someone walks in]",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You're really worried about Chris, aren't you?",
        "Tom: Yeah, it's not like him to cut and run when things get messy.",
        "Margo: No, but probably for the best. Because if he hadn't run, chances are he would have put his fist through Dusty Donovan's face.",
        "Tom: And you blame him?",
        "Margo: No, no, I don't. I mean, Dusty publicly humiliated him, practically called him a criminal. But, really what was going on between him and Emily? I mean, did I detect a note of jealousy there?",
        "Tom: Stop detecting.",
        "Margo: Well, as long as I'm off duty, all right.",
        "Tom: Listen, I'm going to go check on Dad. Maybe Chris is hiding out over there. Oh, try not to have too wild of a time while I'm gone.",
        "Margo: Not a shot of that happening. This place is dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What do you want? What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Lucinda: Oh Margo, you shouldn't be sitting around swilling liquor like that.",
        "[Margo laughs]",
        "Lucinda: Why don't you get -- get yourself together and go and find Dusty and put him away for what he's done to Lily.",
        "Margo: As unpleasantly as their relationship may have ended, I don't think --",
        "Lucinda: Uh, excuse me, unpleasant? Unpleasant? He did everything short of hand her the pills and give her the booze! You got to make him pay for that. You, because someone has to.",

        "[Holden goes out the emergency stair ways and finds Lily sitting on the steps with a needle in her hand]",
        "Holden: Lily? Lily. Lily, you shouldn't be out of bed. Where did you go? Come with me. What do you have in your hand? Okay, if you don't want to tell me, that's okay. Come on, I gotta get you back in your bed, where you belong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Emily! Is the signing over already? I'm sorry I missed it. Honey, what's wrong? Did something happen?",
        "Emily: It's over. It's all over.",
        "Susan: What's over?",
        "Emily: It's over.",
        "Susan: Emily, what have you done? Come on, Baby, tell me what's wrong. Maybe I can help you --",
        "Emily: You can't. Nobody can.",

        "Lucinda: Darling, how is she?",
        "Holden: She's still too weak to talk.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, well let's let her rest then. But let me tell you, Dusty's not going to have a peaceful night if I have anything to say about it.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, you know what? Leave it alone. I think that we should stay as far away from Dusty as possible right now.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, well you stay here with her, all right? I'm going to try to find Dusty. I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Margo: Hey. How's your dad?",
        "Tom: He's the same, but Chris wasn't there. The nurse says he hasn't been by all evening. It looks like he ran out on his own party.",
        "Chris: Double scotch. Keep it coming.",
        "Bartender: Sure thing.",
        "[Chris remembering]",
        "Dusty: You couldn't make love to me the way you did on New Years Eve if you were in love with Chris.",

        "Lucinda: Okay. Emily, what's going on in here?",
        "Emily: Dusty --",
        "Lucinda: What happened? Did he and Chris get into it and Chris won?",
        "Emily: Don't! Don't touch him! Don't come near -- don't go near him!",
        "Lucinda: Stop, okay. Okay, all right. You stay -- you stay and I'll be right back.",
        "Emily: It's okay. She's gone. So you can wake up now. Dusty? Dusty, you can open your eyes now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Why did you get up? Who were you looking for? Me?",
        "Lily: I don't know. No -- no more questions please.",
        "Holden: I'll stop, I promise. After you tell me what you have in your hand.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Holden: Is it more drugs? Lily, I won't be angry, I promise. I need to keep you from hurting yourself. You need to show me what you're hiding. Please.",

        "Lucinda: Where are all the doctors in this place? For heaven -- isn't this meant to be a hospital for heaven's sake?",
        "Margo: Why? What's the matter?",
        "Tom: Why? Are you all right?",
        "Lucinda: I'm fine. I'm fine. Come, come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It was not my idea to leave in the middle of the night. Okay, we -- yes, we will leave as soon as possible. Okay. Still don't get it. An ice- fishing competition in Wisconsin? How is that \"Oakdale Now?\"",
        "Brad: Don't ask me.",
        "Katie: And Kim knows I hate the cold. We're gonna have to drive half the night. It starts at dawn.",
        "Brad: I know, I know, it's a drag.",
        "Katie: What is up with you? It's not like I'm insulting your brilliant idea.",
        "Brad: Well, my idea of a trip with you involves sand, sun and as little clothes as possible.",
        "Katie: Brad, don't start --",
        "Brad: I know, I know, I know. Don't start. Don't start. We're just friends, Brad. But it's not like we were enemies when we were sleeping together.",
        "Katie: I -- it's just that I don't want to settle for anything less than the real thing. Not any more.",
        "Brad: Nobody says you have to. But where does it say that we can't pick up where we left off while you're looking? Same as before. No strings. No commitments. Just -- friends with --",

        "Lily: Mm -- mm-mmm. No, I hate needles.",
        "Holden: Well then where did you get it? And what happened to whatever was in it?",
        "Lily: Please, I just -- come on. I just need to sleep.",
        "Holden: Lily, you need to tell me where you got it. All right, the nurse is going to be here in a minute. Don't leave this room until she gets here. You promise?",
        "Lily: Promise.",
        "[Holden leaves the room and goes to put the medicine back in the medicine cart when Susan comes by]",

        "Holden: No, no, I was --",
        "[Pager beeps]",
        "Susan: Wait. I've got to take this. If you need anything, ask a nurse.",
        "Holden: Sure thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Margo: Emily, what happened?",
        "Emily: Dusty shouldn't have done it. He ruined everything.",
        "Resident: Ma'am, I need some room. Ma'am, please.",
        "Tom: Come on, Emily. You gotta move. Let the doctor do his job.",
        "Emily: No, no, no!",
        "Susan: Emily, are you okay?",
        "Margo: He needs your help more than she does right now.",
        "Emily: Why is he shaking his head? Why is he shaking his head? What does that mean?",
        "Susan: Somebody get her out of here. She doesn't need to see this. I'll take over here.",
        "Tom: Come on. Come on, there's nothing you can do here.",
        "Emily: No, no. I'm not going.",
        "Margo: Emily, your mother knows what she's doing.",
        "Emily: I said I'm not going anywhere until he wakes up! I need to talk to Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Another. [Cell phone rings] If it isn't the perfect Hughes brother. What can I do for you, Tom?",
        "Tom: You need to get over to Memorial right away.",
        "Chris: Is it Dad?",
        "Tom: No. Move it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: How long has he been down?",
        "Margo: We got here 15 minutes ago.",
        "Chris: That's too long. No response?",
        "Susan: Nothing!",
        "Chris: Then stop, Susan. We'd better call it.",
        "Emily: Why are you stopping? Why are you stopping? Mom, keep -- keep doing that. You gotta wake him up.",
        "Susan: Emily, we can't. There's nothing else we can do.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? Of course there's something you can do. You're the doctor!",
        "Susan: Listen to me! There's nothing else we can do. It's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Is this going to be warm enough? It's so cold in Wisconsin.",
        "Brad: Well, just don't stick your tongue on any exposed metal objects.",
        "Katie: Thanks, Brad.",
        "Vienna: Hello. Anybody call for Swedish treats for the road trip?",
        "Brad: Well, this is the most beautiful thing, a gorgeous woman carrying food, or what?",
        "Katie: Well, unless you have a space heater in there, I think we're going to freeze to death before we get to enjoy those. But thanks.",
        "Vienna: Who needs a heater? The cold will keep the blood pumping and the body tingling.",
        "Katie: And the fingers freezing and the eyelashes icy.",
        "Vienna: Well, if you really want to stay warm, you do it the natural way.",
        "Katie: Start a fire?",
        "Vienna: No, by rubbing bodies together.",
        "Brad: Works for me. Yeah, I like that.",
        "Katie: No, not an option. I'm gonna go see if props has a space heater they can lend us.",
        "Vienna: Why do you look like Mr. Dumb and Gloom?",
        "Brad: Doom and gloom. Doom and gloom.",
        "Vienna: Whatever. Why are you unhappy? You're going on a road trip with Katie and you're going to spend the night together --",
        "Brad: As friends. As friends.",
        "Vienna: What could be friendlier than sex?",
        "Brad: Don't talk to me, talk to her.",
        "Vienna: Well, it seems like you're the one who needs to talk to Katie. You haven't told her how you really feel, have you?",
        "Brad: No, no. I'm not going to. Ow! What was that for?",
        "Vienna: That hurt, right? Well, your heart is going to hurt a million times more when you lose her because you were too scared to tell her how you really feel.",
        "Brad: What am I supposed to do?",
        "Vienna: You're going to use this trip to get close to her again. Think about it, Brad. You have the moonlight on the ice, the snow outside, a big warm fluffy bed --",
        "Brad: So you really think --",
        "Katie: All right, let's get this over with. It is not getting any warmer out there.",
        "Vienna: Well, I think it might be a lot warmer than you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Your mom just needs to spend a little time in the hospital.",
        "Luke: For how long? What happened?",
        "Holden: You know what? I can't get into the details right now. But I promise you, I will explain everything tomorrow. I'm going to spend the night with her.",
        "Luke: What are you saying? How sick is she? What aren't you telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Yes, the name is Dusty Donovan. We don't have cause of death yet. Yeah, I'll let you know how things develop. I'll be at Memorial if you need me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Dusty --",
        "Susan: Emily, you're in shock. You need to lie down.",
        "Chris: Yeah, your mother's right. You shouldn't be here right now.",
        "Susan: Chris, why don't you take her home? I'll wait here. I'll wait for the medical examiner --",
        "Chris: No, no. I'm sure Emily would rather be with you right now.",
        "Susan: No, I disagree. I think she'd rather be with you at a time like this.",
        "Chris: I'm needed here. You take Emily home.",
        "Tom: Chris, Susan was first on the scene. Don't you think she's better equipped to fill in the M.E. about what happened? You and Emily --",
        "Chris: I'm interim chief of staff here, Tom, and the head of a major donating foundation has died on my watch. This is my responsibility. I would appreciate it if you'd let me handle it. Time of death: 21:15. You got that?",
        "Resident: Got it, Dr. Hughes.",
        "Lucinda: Excuse me, Susan. Dusty was a young man, full of -- full of vim and vigor. This cannot possibly be natural causes.",
        "Susan: All we know for sure is that his heart stopped beating.",
        "Lucinda: I never thought he had a heart. I mean, not lately. Not the way he's been treating Lily. But for heaven sake, he's a young man! How could his heart suddenly stop beating?",
        "Margo: Yes, how does that happen, Doctor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dad, what's going on? I'm not a kid. I deserve to know the truth.",
        "Holden: She overdosed on some pills.",
        "Luke: Mom OD'd?",
        "Holden: We're pretty sure that it was an accident. They pumped her stomach and they think that she's going to be fine.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm coming over there right away.",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Luke: Well, what am I supposed to do? Sit here and worry?",
        "Holden: Luke, there's nothing you can do here. She won't even know you're here. The pills, they're still in her blood stream, so she's still very groggy.",
        "Luke: Well, what about her boyfriend? Where was he? Maybe he could have stopped her from taking them.",
        "Holden: He's out of your mother's life for good this time. Where's Meg?",
        "Luke: Ethan was crying, so she went in to rock him.",
        "Holden: Oh, that's good. You know what? Don't say anything to Meg. She's been through enough. And don't say anything to the girls, either. I want to figure out a way to explain what happened.",
        "Luke: I thought we were over this. I thought we didn't have to explain Mom any more.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I thought so too. Let's hope this is the last time.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, can I have a word with you, please? Outside where she can't hear us.",
        "[They leave the room]",
        "Holden: What is it?",
        "Lucinda: Something dreadful has happened.",
        "Lily: Holden? Holden! [Holden enters the room] Dusty's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Manny, I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you.",
        "Medical examiner: It never is. Body's this way?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I need the cause of death -- yesterday.",
        "Medical examiner: You always do.",
        "Margo: Why don't you canvass the staff? See who was where when.",
        "Dallas: What are we looking for?",
        "Margo: Well, Donovan was a relatively young man, made a lot of people angry tonight. We're not looking at natural causes.",
        "Susan: Emily's still in shock. I don't know whether to take her home or to the ER.",
        "Chris: Well, as Emily's next of kin, that's your call to make.",
        "Susan: Well as the man in her life, I would think that you would to voice an opinion.",
        "Chris: It's not up to me.",
        "Emily: I just want to go home, Mom.",
        "Susan: Oh, okay, Honey. Come on.",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm sorry, Emily, you can't leave yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: How do you know that?",
        "Lily: I just know. I know Dusty's dead. That's what my mother was telling you outside, right?",
        "Holden: Yes. Dusty is dead. Lily? Are you okay?",
        "Lily: I'm just tired. I want to go to sleep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Ta-da!",
        "Luke: What's that?",
        "Noah: Freshly ground coffee beans. I think I finally figured out how to use your grandma's ancient coffee grinder in the cellar. Care to be my guinea pig?",
        "Luke: No thanks.",
        "Noah: I probably shouldn't have used it without asking. Sorry.",
        "Luke: No, no, that's okay. Hey, I'm glad that you're beginning to feel more comfortable around here.",
        "Noah: Then what is it? I mean, what did I do?",
        "Luke: Nothing.",
        "Noah: What's wrong?",
        "Luke: It's -- it's my mom. She's in the hospital.",
        "Noah: Is she okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah, she um -- she's going to be fine.",
        "Noah: That's good. Do you want me to drive you over there?",
        "Luke: Uh -- no. No, I'm under strict orders to stay here and hold down the family fort.",
        "Natalie: Were you hugging?",
        "Faith: Well, they're dating. Of course they're hugging.",
        "Luke: I am so going to get you back when you start dating boys.",
        "Natalie: Boys are yucky.",
        "Noah: Yeah, I used to say that too.",
        "Faith: Where's Dad?",
        "Luke: Dad um -- Dad is --",
        "Noah: He deserted us for the evening. And a good thing, too.",
        "Faith: Why? Where'd he go?",
        "Noah: He ran away because -- he couldn't stand to see you two get beat by us! Me and Luke versus you two. The boys stomping the girls.",
        "Faith: No way.",
        "Luke: Yes way.",
        "Natalie: Girls rule!",
        "Noah: You better sit down and put your dice where your mouth is.",
        "Luke: Thank you.",
        "Noah: For what? Being able to hide my feelings better than you?",
        "Luke: But not when it counts.",
        "Noah: Sit down and get ready to play. Because I am not about to lose to your little sisters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I don't see why this can't wait until tomorrow.",
        "Margo: I just wanted to get a few facts straight while they're clear in Emily's mind, okay? So Lucinda said that she found you here in the room with Donovan. How long had you been here? And what were you doing in this part of the hospital anyway?",
        "Emily: I don't know. I was just wandering around. I was upset.",
        "Margo: So you just happened to wander into the lab offices and then you found Donovan on the floor?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm, that's what happened.",
        "Margo: Were you looking for him?",
        "Emily: Hmm-mm.",
        "Margo: Why not?",
        "Susan: What kind of question is that?",
        "Margo: Well, it seems perfectly logical, under the circumstances. I mean, he was attacking your boyfriend. And Tom said that he heard the two of you arguing. I would think that you would follow Donovan just to finish what you started.",
        "Susan: What exactly are you trying to say?",
        "Emily: It's okay. Yes, I was mad at Dusty and I was mad -- I was mad at Chris, and -- I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now. A man is dead. A man that I cared about. And none of your questions or any of my answers are going to bring him back.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, Emily. Fine. We can finish it tomorrow. Fine.",
        "Chris: We can run some of the tests here at Memorial to speed things up.",
        "Medical examiner: No offense, but I do all my own tests.",
        "Chris: Well, under normal circumstances, sure, but we're on hospital property now so --.",
        "Tom: Chris, you need to let the M.E. handle this.",
        "Chris: I'm just trying to help out here, Tom.",
        "Tom: I know. Well, think just about yourself for a second. The PD is treating this as a suspicious death. A young man dies, suddenly, no reason. A man who some people in this town, including yourself, would like to see out of the picture. You need to be as far away from this as possible.",
        "Chris: Are you saying I'm a suspect?",
        "Tom: I'm saying let the M.E. handle this. Let me buy you a cup of coffee. You need it.",
        "Susan: I know how hard it was for you to see Dusty like that. You two used to care a lot about each other --",
        "Emily: You have no idea how things were with me and Dusty before he died.",
        "Susan: Hey, is that why Chris has been so weird? So distant towards you? Did he know about you and Dusty?",
        "Emily: Chris and I -- Chris and I are done.",
        "Susan: Since when?",
        "Emily: Oh, Mother, please. I don't want to talk about this with you.",
        "Susan: Listen, I need to understand one thing. You told Margo that you wandered into the lab office and you discovered Dusty right before Lucinda. But I saw you earlier, coming from that direction, and we spoke, remember? And then you went right back there. Why?",

        "Brad: We're just -- just relax. Enjoy the ride. We'll be in Wisconsin in no time.",
        "Katie: Hopefully in one piece. Didn't we just pass that turnoff before?",
        "Brad: All turnoffs look the same in the dark. Don't worry, I -- I know where I'm going. The cabins, they may look a little rustic from the outside.",
        "Katie: Oh please tell me they have central heating.",
        "Brad: Better. A big old fireplace.",
        "Katie: Are you serious?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Great, we're going to be staying up all night feeding the fire.",
        "Brad: Sounds like a plan to me. Moonlight twinkling on the ice and snow outside. A roaring fire inside. A big comfy bed --",
        "Katie: Your lips are moving, but Vienna's words are coming out. Forget it, Buddy. It's not like you fell in love with me or something.",

        "Katie: Wait, hold on, it's the studio. Hello? Wait, hold on, I can't hear you. What, the competition what? Are you sure? Hello? Hello? You're never going to believe this.",
        "Brad: You lost your signal? I told you to upgrade from that cheapie phone.",
        "Katie: This ice-fishing competition is cancelled. Apparently there's some flu going around, and all the big competitors are dropping like flies.",
        "Brad: That's a shame. Well, I mean, we've come this far, we might as well head on to the cabin. Go home in the morning.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. I am spending tonight in my big warm, comfy bed. Turn around, let's go back to Oakdale.",
        "Brad: Okay -- uh that might be a problem because I'm not exactly sure where we are.",
        "Katie: You're telling me that we're lost?",
        "Brad: You could say that.",

        "Brad: Look. I mean, we're not on empty, but we're not far from it. And if you think I'm lying about being lost, be my guest.",
        "Katie: How long have you known we were lost?",
        "Brad: I was distracted, okay? I was thinking about the roaring fire, the cabin --",
        "Katie: And now I'm thinking about killing you. I can't believe you got us lost in the middle of nowhere!",
        "Brad: Don't worry, I will get us out of this.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Brad: Well, we don't have any cell reception, so we're just going to pull over and wait until daylight or until someone drives by, whichever comes first.",
        "Katie: Or until we freeze.",

        "Katie: I'm barely willing to share this car with you, right now.",
        "Brad: Okay, well the first thing we need to do is conserve gas.",

        "Katie: Tough.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. Let's think positive thoughts.",
        "Katie: Oh, I am thinking positively. I'm thinking of setting your hair on fire so I can stay warm.",
        "Brad: I'm thinking a little more positively than that. Think of -- look at Henry and Vienna. They were stranded in a limo overnight, and look what happened to them.",
        "Katie: Yeah, first of all, that was a limo. Secondly, we're not a couple. We will never be a couple, even if we were the last two people on earth, I'd rather set you on fire!",
        "Brad: Being mad at me, is that making you warmer?",
        "Katie: A little. Not much.",
        "Brad: Okay, all right. Time for plan \"B.\" We have to think hot thoughts. We're on a sunny beach in Cabo. It's so hot that we can't even walk on the sand.",
        "Katie: I don't think this is going to work.",

        "Tom: Well, Lucinda's on your side. You shouldn't have to worry about The City Times. You and Emily should be able to figure out a way to spin it in The Intruder. Are you gonna talk to me?",

        "Tom: Well, what's going on with you and Emily? Maybe I can help.",
        "Chris: I can't get you involved.",

        "Emily: Well I don't know! I don't have the answer, okay?! I was in a fog! Chris broke up with me and Dusty betrayed me, Mom. I don't know! I don't know what I was doing!",
        "Susan: What did you do? Come on, you know you can tell me anything.",

        "Chris: Tom, you saw what happened tonight. Dusty deliberately set out to destroy me.",
        "Tom: Destroy, really?",
        "Chris: Yeah, what would you call it? He tried to wreck my career, but when that wasn't enough, he destroyed my relationship with Emily.",
        "Tom: And what does Dusty have to do with you and Emily?",
        "Chris: Dusty and Emily slept together while she was living with me. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, say it.",
        "Tom: What do you want me to say, Chris?",
        "Chris: Could have told you so, Chris? She wasn't to be trusted?",
        "Tom: You know, it's a rotten thing to do, but it's not like you and Emily were into some commitment thing.",
        "Chris: Well, just because I didn't pop the question doesn't mean I wasn't imagining a future with her. But I guess she didn't feel the same way. Or Dusty convinced her that she didn't.",
        "Tom: So you blame Dusty?",
        "Chris: You bet I do. You were right when you said I wanted him dead.",
        "Tom: Oh, well murder consists of a little more than motive, and you didn't do anything about that.",

        "Margo: No, there were so many people in this room, it was like union station. We did get his wallet, cash, credit cards, so robbery's not a motive.",
        "Dallas: No, that'd be too easy.",
        "Margo: But the one thing we don't have is his cell phone. And Dusty Donovan always had his cell phone. Manny, what do you got?",

        "Noah: I never thought it was.",
        "Luke: Are you sorry that you're not out at some dorm, playing beer pong, and instead you're here getting clobbered by a couple of little girls at a board game?",
        "Noah: No. Growing up, this is what I always wanted. I mean, to be in a house full of people, part of a real family.",
