        "Katie: No, I think I'm ready to let it go, but I don't want to just sell it to just anybody. I mean, if this guy is gonna level it for condos, then forget it. I want someone to take care of the land. You know, I want a family to live there, Margo. A big, happy family who will take care of the land and pass it on to their kids and grandkids.

        "Mike: No, no, you're right. This is the most important night of our lives. I shouldn't look like I just came from putting up drywall.",
        "Henry: Right, right, so in that case, let's go for broke, okay? Little bubbles deserves to be swept off her perky little heels, you know, and I'm just the man to do it. Come on. Trust me. Behind these doors is the master. Sergio has the best fashion eye for the straight guy this side of Chicago. Let's go, Romeo. Time's a wastin'.",

        "Holden: You have to admit it looks pretty bad, Jack.",
        "Jack: You want clear-cut answers? Yes, those printouts are evidence. Is it solid proof? No. How many people log onto your computer at Metro, huh?",
        "Dusty: We did your job.",
        "Jack: Let's download some files see what you got in there!",
        "Dusty: We handed you a killer. Paul Ryan is guilty, so is his mother. What are you waiting for? Suddenly, listen to this one. With all this going down, Hal Munson can't be reached. What a surprise!",
        "Jack: Okay, you better back off right now, you're crossing a line!",

We screamed so much I couldn't talk for three days. If I close my eyes, and think real hard, I can still see the look on your face when I let go of your bicycle and you rode away on your own for the first time. You rode up and down your Dad's driveway, it must have been a hundred times.",
        "Will: I remember that.",
        "Paul: Yeah, remember? And so much of the reason that Rose and I wanted to have children of our own was because of you. Because of you. So, yes, I do love you. I do. I love you enough, to even after everything that you have done, I am still here. I am right here, with you.",

[Police sirens] They're coming to take him away. Do you want that! Do you want them to lock him up?! Is that what you want?! Come on, come on, let me give him a normal life. Please, please.

        "Jennifer: Here, thanks for the tea and for listening.",
        "Walker: Well, to what I don't know.",

        "Lily: Why isn't Jack and Margo out there leading the search?",
        "Dusty: Because they answer to a boss that's way too connected. It's like a big family reunion around here, you know? Barbara, Paul, Hal -- you can't trust any of these guys. And now you throw a kid into the mix. Forget about it, things are going to get worse.",
        "Lily: How?",
        "Dusty: Well, what if the kids want to spend time with his mom or his brother, you know? What's Hal going to say, no? No. Tell the papers to stay on Hal Munson. Have that guy followed.",

        "Lily: I'm not afraid, or crazy. I'm angry that someone took my sister away from me. And I'm trying to find out who that person is to make them pay. If that makes me unreasonable, then I'm unreasonable. I know why you're really upset.",
        "Holden: Yeah. You and Dusty digging up evidence. You knew about those computer files.",

        "Holden: No. Lily, look, I know that you can't see past your grief, I get that, but I am not the enemy here. I love you. I will always love you. But I am selfish when it comes to us and I don't want to share you with Rose's memory or Dusty's vendetta against Paul. Now, does that mean that I don't want to find out who killed Rose? No, I want what you want. I always want what you want. But how we get it, that's where we disagree. I trust Hal, I trust Jack, but Donovan has done nothing but bring this family trouble and I don't want any more of it.",
