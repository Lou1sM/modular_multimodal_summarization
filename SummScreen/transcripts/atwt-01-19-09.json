Paul doesn't know why Josie has decided to be such a supportive friend. Dusty asks Meg for a favor \u0096 call Craig and offer an olive branch in hopes of him incriminating himself about Paul's car bomb. Meg is unsure, but Dusty works on her and she gives in and calls Craig to meet up where Dusty will be listening nearby through a voice-activated microphone.

Later, as they talk, Dusty admits that he isn't happy Josie is friends with Paul and she isn't thrilled he is always going to Meg. Paul goes to see Meg; he is ready to sign the divorce papers. Meg can't help but notice this new improved Paul. He only asks that he see Eliza because he couldn't stand to lose her too.

        "Josie: Paul?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm?",
        "Josie: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: Well, I'm about to kick a field goal.",
        "Josie: This place is a mess.",
        "Paul: I don't know you mean, thank you. Thanks a lot. Thank you.",
        "Josie: Are you okay?",
        "Paul: I mean, am I bonkers? No. Not so much.",
        "Josie: That's not what I meant.",
        "Paul: Have I lost my marbles? Not yet. They're around here somewhere. I was playing with them earlier.",
        "Josie: How is it possible to maintain your sense of humor and still be depressed?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I can't figure that out. I mean, my life is going so well.",
        "Josie: Now I see why you say that.",
        "Paul: Why? What's up?",
        "Josie: Divorce papers?",
        "Paul: I threw those out. What, the maid -- go fishing through my trash?",
        "Josie: Look, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: It was very sweet of you to drop by.",
        "Dusty: I've been so busy with Johnny, that I haven't been able to check in on you and the baby. How are things?",
        "Meg: Well, Eliza's doing great. She's packing on the pounds.",
        "Dusty: How about her mom?",
        "Meg: Um, she needs to lose a few pounds, but I'll get there.",
        "Dusty: Oh, she's doing fine.",
        "Meg: Well, Eliza keeps me busy, just going and going.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Dusty: Motherhood's a full-time gig.",
        "Meg: Yeah, tell me about it. I mean, I still can't accept the fact that I'll be raising her on my own, without Paul. You know, we had this pact that we'd share 3:00 A.M. feedings --",
        "Dusty: At least you've got your little girl. Don't ever let her go.",
        "Meg: What's really on your mind, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: I need a favor. It's very important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: No matter how many times you throw away these papers, Meg is still going to want a divorce.",
        "Paul: Well, what if that's not what I want?",
        "Josie: Do you think you can change her mind?",
        "Paul: At this point? Probably not.",
        "Josie: Look, I know this is hard, but by signing those papers, it could be the best way to keep Meg in your life.",
        "Paul: Really? How do you figure?",
        "Josie: You two have a child together. You're always going to be family. If you cooperate in the divorce, it could be a sign of good faith. It could open the door to a relationship in the future.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I promised Lucy I'd make peace with Craig, but it's impossible. Every move I make, there he is, trying to undermine me.",
        "Meg: Well, he wants Johnny in his life. So he's probably a little overenthusiastic right now.",
        "Dusty: It's more than that. He tries to make me look bad in front of my son.",
        "Meg: I thought you and Craig would find common ground.",
        "Dusty: No, it's past that point. He wants full custody.",
        "Meg: He said that?",
        "Dusty: No, of course not. But that's the agenda. And I can't let him. I've got to nail him.",
        "Meg: How?",
        "Dusty: I don't know if you know this, but Katie gave Craig a false alibi to get him off the hook for trying to kill Paul.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know.",
        "Dusty: I tried to get Katie to go back to the cops, but I don't think she will.",
        "Meg: Okay, and what -- you think I can change Katie's mind, because I seriously doubt that.",
        "Dusty: No, no, that's not what I'm asking you.",
        "Meg: Okay, so how am I supposed to help?",
        "Dusty: You and Craig were once pretty close. Is that correct?",
        "Meg: Well, not really. Our marriage was a disaster. We hardly ever speak.",
        "Dusty: But still he's got a soft spot for you. And if you sit down with him, he might open up to you.",
        "Meg: What exactly are you suggesting?",
        "Dusty: Would you call him and set up a meeting?",
        "Meg: Out of the blue? He's going to get suspicious.",
        "Dusty: I don't think so. Come on, Meg. I know you can pull this off.",
        "Meg: Okay, pull what off exactly?",
        "Dusty: Tell him you've divorced Paul and that he was right about him all along.",
        "Meg: Okay, and then what?",
        "Dusty: And he takes you into his confidence and tells you he tried to kill Paul.",
        "Meg: No. Sorry, I can't do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Not again.",
        "Craig: Always lovely to see you too. This was on the front lawn.",
        "Carly: Oh, if you're auditioning to be my new paper boy, I'm not hiring. And I'm not accepting any marriage proposals either.",
        "Craig: Is that why you think I'm here?",
        "Carly: Isn't it?",
        "Craig: Well, I know you love to think that the world revolves around you, but that's just not always the case.",
        "Carly: I can't banter with you this early in the morning. I haven't had my coffee.",
        "Craig: Mmm. Would you like me to make some?",
        "Carly: Well, that's sweet, but I'm out of French roast.",
        "Craig: Oh. Mein gott, no wonder you're so grumpy.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't have all day. Well, what do you want?",
        "Craig: Uh, to see Parker. How's he doing?",
        "Carly: Well, he's fine. Thanks to you.",
        "Craig: I'm glad I could help. He had a pretty bad headache the other day. Is that gone?",
        "Carly: Yeah, he's feeling better. He went to breakfast with his father before school. So you might want to come up with some other cover story for why you're here.",
        "Craig: I beg your pardon?",
        "Carly: Or you can just go ahead and do what you're going to do. You know, get down on one knee, or cue the music, or whatever else you have planned. Go ahead, try to sweet me off my feet. I dare you.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry, lady. The marriage offer still stands, but I'm not about to hire a mariachi band. And I do have some pressing business, so I really should be going.",
        "Carly: Where are you going?",
        "Craig: To find Parker.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Craig: Carly, you're just going to have to learn to trust me. Have a nice day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Do you want some more pancakes, Parker?",
        "Parker: I'm good, thanks.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Jack: You never answered my question earlier.",
        "Parker: What question?",
        "Jack: About how much time Craig is spending at the house?",
        "Parker: Okay, if you want to know if he and my mom are going out, then just ask her yourself.",
        "Jack: This isn't about your mother. It's about you. Look, I know he kept you from being hit by that car. I just don't want him parlaying that into something else. He's not the influence you need.",
        "Parker: So you don't want us being friends?",
        "Jack: I think he should find friends his own age.",
        "Parker: His son is my nephew. We're family.",
        "Jack: If you want to hang out with Johnny, go for it. I'm sure Dusty would welcome it. Craig is another story.",
        "Parker: The man saved my life.",
        "Jack: And I am grateful for that.",
        "Parker: But you can't give the guy a break? You know what, I've got to get to school.",
        "Jack: Just keep your distance from Craig, please?",
        "Parker: Whatever.",
        "Janet: Hey, do you want my unsolicited advice?",
        "Jack: On what?",
        "Janet: I see what you're doing. I've tried it with my kid myself, but it never works.",
        "Jack: What is that?",
        "Janet: You're trying to turn Parker into a spy.",
        "Jack: That is not what I am doing.",
        "Janet: Yes, you are. You are pumping him for information.",
        "Jack: The guy is a bad influence, that's all.",
        "Janet: On Parker or Carly?",
        "Jack: Both.",
        "Janet: Hello -- she's not your wife anymore.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I understand that, okay? But he is still my son and I have to protect my kids.",
        "Janet: Parker left this.",
        "Jack: I'll take that to him.",
        "Janet: All right, I'll see you later?",
        "Jack: Hello -- I'm still your husband.",
        "Janet: And don't you forget it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey, Craig, what are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Parker, I just wanted to see if you're okay.",
        "Parker: I'm fine.",
        "Craig: Good. Oh hey, did you Mom tell you I came by with Johnny yesterday?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I was out. Spending a lot of time with Johnny?",
        "Craig: Oh, as much as I can.",
        "Parker: That's great. I guess I'll see you around.",
        "Craig: You bet. Oh, hey, I keep meaning to ask you, are you ever interested in seeing a Blackhawks game?",
        "Parker: Yeah, sure.",
        "Craig: Good, good, I'll check into tickets. I'll let you know.",
        "Parker: Great.",
        "Craig: All right.",
        "Parker: I've got class, so --",
        "Craig: Sure, of course. See you around. At the house.",
        "Parker: Is my mom cool with that?",
        "Craig: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Jack: You forgot something, Parker.",
        "Parker: Thanks, Dad. Later.",
        "Jack: Later. Tell me something, Craig. Why are you stalking my son?",
        "Craig: I'm not stalking anybody.",
        "Jack: You just hang around outside high schools for no particular reason?",
        "Craig: What, you never heard the old saying that when you save someone's life, you feel responsible for that person? It's funny, that's how I feel about Parker.",
        "Jack: Well, legally, Parker is my son. That makes me responsible for him.",
        "Craig: Well, I would never get the way of a devoted father. I know how that feels. But then, neither you or Dusty were there when they were nearly run down by that car. Thank God I got there in time.",
        "Jack: How long are you going to play the hero card?",
        "Craig: I'm not asking for any special treatment.",
        "Jack: Good, because you're not going to get any. So don't try to leverage one good deed into getting all warm and fuzzy with either Carly or Parker.",
        "Craig: That's not what I'm trying to do, Jack.",
        "Jack: Right. Like you didn't try to blackmail Katie into giving you an alibi for attempted murder. I know what you're capable of, Craig. Stay away from my family.",
        "Craig: The last thing I want is any trouble. Keep the peace, Detective.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, Dusty, I know this is hard for you --",
        "Dusty: I'd do anything to keep you with your daughter.",
        "Meg: So, you think I should return the favor?",
        "Dusty: I don't want Craig near my kid.",
        "Meg: Okay, what if Craig is committed to doing things differently now? I mean, he doesn't want to make the same old mistakes. Maybe he could do the right thing.",
        "Dusty: Would you trust Craig with your child?",
        "Meg: No, I wouldn't.",
        "Dusty: Then you've got to help me.",
        "Meg: Okay, okay, fine. How do I start?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: Oh. Hello?",
        "Meg: Craig, hey, it's Meg. How are you?",
        "Craig: Meg, what a surprise. How's Eliza?",
        "Meg: Uh, Eliza's great. Oh, and you know what, thanks for that tip you gave me on Christmas Eve. Putting her in the car, driving around to get her to asleep. It works.",
        "Craig: Glad I can be of help, but surely that can't be why you're calling.",
        "Meg: Uh, no, not really. I heard about Johnny. He's back. You must be thrilled.",
        "Craig: I am. It's a miracle.",
        "Meg: Well, I have a little gift for him. And I was wondering if you had some time, I could drop it off to you.",
        "Craig: Uh, that's very sweet. I'm free right now.",
        "Meg: Well, that's great. So am I.",
        "Craig: Meet me at the Lakeview?",
        "Meg: Perfect. I'll see you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: We're meeting at the Lakeview.",
        "Dusty: I'll drive you over. Thank you for doing this, Meg.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I hope it works.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're telling me if I go through with this divorce, that is somehow going to make Meg see me in some brand-new light?",
        "Josie: Why not? She knows that you hate the idea of divorce. She's probably bracing for a fight. If she doesn't get it, she'll have to trust you.",
        "Paul: Or not. The truth is, I have no idea what to expect from Meg. I don't even know if she's going to let me be a part of my own daughter's life.",
        "Josie: Meg is a good person. If you do the right thing, she will too.",
        "Paul: I don't know. It feels like I'm jumping off a cliff. I can't even imagine my life without Meg.",
        "Josie: She doesn't want to be married to you anymore. If you don't sign the papers, you're just delaying the inevitable.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I know.",
        "Josie: Look, right now, you've got to focus on maintaining any kind of a relationship with her. Show her that you care more about her and the baby than you care about yourself.",
        "Paul: You know, you're right.",
        "Josie: Okay, before you change your mind, go to Meg, bring the papers, tell her that you're going to sign them.",
        "Paul: No, no, there's no way I can do something like that face-to-face.",
        "Josie: It's the most positive gesture you can make at this point. She'll respect you for it.",
        "Paul: All right. I should clean up, right? Change my clothes? Why does it feel like I'm marching to a firing squad?",
        "Josie: If you want, I can come with you. For moral support.",
        "Paul: I'd appreciate that. And on the way, you can explain to me what I did to deserve your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Okay, I hope she sleeps through this. I wish I could.",
        "Dusty: You got to stay sharp. This is voice-activated. It's got excellent range. I'll be recording everything you say.",
        "Meg: Okay, I hope it works.",
        "Dusty: Me, too. Good luck. Hey.",
        "Craig: So nice to see you.",
        "Meg: Thanks.",
        "Craig: And Eliza. Oh my gosh. You got big since I saw you at Christmas. She's beautiful.",
        "Meg: Thank you. And a handful, but in a good way.",
        "Craig: Have a seat, please.",
        "Meg: Thanks. Oh, here -- this is for Johnny. My nephew, Ethan -- he's a huge fan of those.",
        "Craig: Well, thank you very much. I'm sure Johnny will love it. But I don't think you called me just to give me a gift for Johnny. Why did you suddenly want to see me? We haven't been exactly close since I came back, Meg. Why did you want to see me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack, is something wrong?",
        "Jack: It's about Craig Montgomery.",
        "Carly: Oh no, not again. Look, I know that you don't approve of the man showing up at the house. What do you have -- cops watching the places now?",
        "Jack: Of course I don't, Carly. Would you calm down, please?",
        "Carly: No, I just don't want to fight with you, Jack --",
        "Jack: I don't want to fight either, but the guy is going too far this time.",
        "Carly: What did he do?",
        "Jack: He showed up outside school this morning, waiting to meet up with Parker. The guy is totally inappropriate.",
        "Carly: Yeah, that does seem weird.",
        "Jack: And I'm sure he's got an ulterior motive, and I think you may know what it is. So, please, Carly, tell me. Why does Craig Montgomery want with our son?",
        "Carly: Come on, Jack. Don't you think you're being a little paranoid?",
        "Jack: This is Craig Montgomery we're talking about. I wouldn't put anything past him.",
        "Carly: Well, neither would I, ordinarily. But he just got his son back. It's never been more important that he proves that he can change, that he can be a good father.",
        "Jack: Well, Dusty has custody of Johnny the last time I checked.",
        "Carly: Yeah, but Craig wants to be in his life and he should be. He has a right to have a relationship with his son.",
        "Jack: So you're Craig's number-one advocate now, is that it?",
        "Carly: Well, I know his history. I also know that he's trying to turn his life around and I can identify with that.",
        "Jack: Okay, I would love to believe that all people are capable of starting over, but in Craig's case? Come on, Carly. The guy's never going to change.",
        "Carly: So nobody ever gets a second chance, right, Jack?",
        "Jack: What's going on with you? Give me one reason why you're sticking up for -- oh, yeah -- you've got 200,000 good reasons to trust him --",
        "Carly: That was a loan and I'm going to pay it back.",
        "Jack: Oh, he's got you in his back pocket, Carly.",
        "Carly: He does not!",
        "Jack: How does it feel owing Craig Montgomery, hmm? And how long do you think before he ups the ante and makes you give him an alibi for the next car bomb he plants?",
        "Carly: That is not fair, Jack --",
        "Jack: Hey, he's already gotten away with it once, it could happen again --",
        "Carly: Jack, I'm not having this discussion --",
        "Jack: I will do whatever it takes to keep my family safe from that man!",
        "Carly: Yeah, what? What exactly are you going to do?",
        "Jack: You keep cozying up to Craig and you'll find out.",
        "Carly: What? Are you going to drag me into court, sue me for custody of the kids?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You're right, Craig. I didn't call you to give you a gift for Johnny. That was an excuse.",
        "Craig: Do you want to tell me what this is really about?",
        "Meg: Well, ever since I had my baby and Paul had his breakdown -- I've been doing a lot of soul searching. And the truth is, I married you while I was still in love with Paul. And that was wrong.",
        "Craig: Is this an apology?",
        "Meg: I want to make peace, Craig. I want you to know that I understand now what I didn't understand then. I thought you were being unfair to Paul -- irrational. But seeing Paul at his worst, well, I have a whole different perspective.",
        "Craig: That's quite an admission.",
        "Meg: I owe you an apology, Craig. And I know it's a little late, but I understand what I must've put you through when I left you to be with Paul. And I am so sorry for everything I put you through.",
        "Craig: Are you saying that you regret that decision? Are you saying that you changed your mind about me, Meg?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm busy, Jack. Don't you have to work today?",
        "Jack: Later, I do. I think we need to have this out right now.",
        "Carly: No. No, we don't. I'm not going to listen to you threaten to take my kids as a way to --",
        "Jack: I never said anything about custody --",
        "Carly: Your threat was implicit. And it's absolutely unforgivable. I'm completely devoted to those kids.",
        "Jack: I know that. I'm not questioning that. I'm not -- I'm sorry, I know you're devoted -- you're a devoted a mother. But this -- this is about Craig. He's a criminal. A repeat offender.",
        "Carly: The truth is you can't stand the thought of another man, any man, taking your place in this house, even though you don't want to be here yourself.",
        "Jack: I am here for these kids whenever they need me. But I'm not going to stand idly by and watch you make another mistake that could put their lives in danger.",
        "Carly: No matter what happens, it's all my fault, isn't it? I've had enough of your lecture. Get out!",
        "Jack: This isn't over, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You haven't answered my question, Meg. Have you changed your mind about me?",
        "Meg: I've had to rethink a lot of things in my life, lately. And yeah, there have been decisions I regret.",
        "Craig: Such as?",
        "Meg: Such as committing myself to Paul, was a terrible mistake. Living with him was a nightmare.",
        "Craig: I always knew Paul would hurt you. Too bad I didn't put him away when I had the chance.",
        "Meg: What do you mean by that?",
        "Craig: Just that perhaps I could have helped you get Paul committed before you had to suffer so much.",
        "Meg: How? You were gone most of the time.",
        "Craig: I hope you know how much I loved you, Meg. I would've done anything for you.",
        "Meg: Is that what really happened, Craig? Did you love me enough to try to kill the man who came between us? Did you try to kill Paul?",
        "Craig: Why would you ask me that?",
        "Meg: I always wondered. When Paul's car was blown up, everyone suspected you. And the way you left town certainly made you look guilty.",
        "Craig: I went looking for my son.",
        "Meg: Oh, come on, Craig. You left Oakdale because you knew you'd be arrested. And I thought you were guilty and I hated you. But now, you know, there's a part of me that almost understands.",
        "Craig: As much as I'd like to take credit I did not try to kill Paul.",
        "Meg: Are you sure?",
        "Craig: I'm positive. Though, lately, I've been wondering maybe, if Dusty did it.",
        "Meg: Dusty?",
        "Craig: He hated Paul just as much as I did.",
        "Meg: Dusty was nowhere near Oakdale. He was looking for his son.",
        "Craig: We don't know that. He went to a lot of trouble to fake his own death, to disappear. And actually we have no idea what he could've accomplished. It's getting late. I really have to go. But Meg, thank you for your offer to make peace and I wholeheartedly accept. And congratulations again, on the little one. You know, if we'd had our baby, our lives would be so much different now.",
        "Meg: Well, I guess that wasn't meant to be.",
        "Craig: But I do hope we can be friends again. Hey, if you ever need a Godfather.",
        "Meg: I'm fine, thank you. I've got that covered.",
        "Craig: Worth a shot. Take care of your little angel.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Ugh, what's wrong with you? You look like you've got a bad case of agita.",
        "Jack: Carly plus Craig equals acid reflux.",
        "Janet: What now?",
        "Jack: I found Craig hanging out with Parker at school.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's weird.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I thought so too. But when I confronted Carly about it, she started defending Craig like she was on retainer.",
        "Janet: Well, no wonder. You confronted Carly. Big mistake.",
        "Jack: Someone's got to talk some sense into her. By taking his money, she's giving him an open invitation to get involved in my son's life.",
        "Janet: Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, big guy. The more you make a stink about Carly hanging with Craig, the more she's going to want to do it just to spite you.",
        "Jack: I can't imagine her wanting to hang out with him for any other reason.",
        "Janet: She knows how to push your buttons. Don't let her.",
        "Jack: You're right, you're right, as usual, you're right.",
        "Janet: I bet you ten bucks, if you let it go about her seeing Craig -- if you don't make a big deal about it, she'll drop him like a hot stuffed pepper.",
        "Jack: Well, I like your hot stuffed peppers. I'm so glad I married such a smart woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I really tried, Dusty. I'm so sorry it didn't pan out.",
        "Dusty: Me too.",
        "Meg: After everything you've been through, you deserve not to have to worry about Johnny anymore.",
        "Dusty: Thanks.",
        "Meg: Come here. You know what? We should get Eliza and Johnny together for a play date soon.",
        "Dusty: Definitely.",
        "Meg: Okay, okay, Eliza, we're going to go home now.",
        "Dusty: Be safe.",
        "Meg: Bye.",
        "Dusty: Bye.",
        "Josie: So, what did Meg want this time?",
        "Dusty: Nothing. I asked her to do something for me.",
        "Josie: Really?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I was trying to get a confession from Craig that he tried to kill Paul, but it didn't work out.",
        "Josie: Wow, isn't that a little extreme? Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Dusty: Because I don't trust you.",
        "Josie: Thanks a lot.",
        "Dusty: Well, you asked.",
        "Josie: Did you really think I would go and tell Craig what you were up to?",
        "Dusty: I think you might punch Meg out. You get so jealous. What's so funny?",
        "Josie: You are. You're the one who's getting punched.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Oh, hey --",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Meg: I wasn't expecting you.",
        "Paul: Um, your mom said that I could stay.",
        "Meg: Is there an emergency? What's going on?",
        "Paul: No, no emergency. I just -- I brought the divorce papers and I'm ready to sign them, if that's what you really want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey, Mom, I'm home.",
        "Carly: You're early.",
        "Parker: Yeah, practice was cancelled. The coach called in sick. What's wrong?",
        "Carly: Nothing.",
        "Parker: What did you and Dad fight about this time? Me and Liberty?",
        "Carly: It was a little bit about you, I guess, but not about Liberty.",
        "Parker: What did I do?",
        "Carly: Nothing. Your dad thinks that Craig is hanging around you too much. Is he bothering you?",
        "Parker: No, not really. Craig's a good guy. I just don't get why Dad is so paranoid about him.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, I can't deal with him right now. Just tell him I'm not here.",
        "Craig: Hello, Parker.",
        "Parker: Hi.",
        "Craig: Where's your mom?",
        "Parker: She's too upset to see you.",
        "Craig: Really? Thanks for the heads-up. Where is she?",
        "Parker: Good luck.",
        "Craig: Thanks.",
        "Parker: I'm just going to get started on my homework.",
        "Craig: Carly?",
        "Carly: Craig, what are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Well, you said you were out of coffee, so I brought you some. Java's finest.",
        "Carly: That was very thoughtful of you. But you have to go.",
        "Craig: Sorry. Can't do that.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you for the coffee, Craig. But I'd really like to be alone.",
        "Craig: No, you're obviously upset. Being alone is the last thing you need. Let me help.",
        "Carly: No, please. I'm already in enough trouble with Jack as it is.",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Craig: What did he do now?",
        "Carly: If I keep spending time with you, he's going to take me to court. He's going to take the kids.",
        "Craig: He has no right to do that. I know better than anyone, that's blackmail!",
        "Carly: Very effective blackmail.",
        "Craig: You're not married to him anymore. He can't pick your friends for you.",
        "Carly: Hey, I agree with you. I wish there were some way Jack could see that.",
        "Craig: Well, someone needs to clue him in -- tell him to treat you with the respect you deserve.",
        "Carly: No Craig, I don't think the person to send that message can be you, okay?",
        "Craig: Just wait. Maybe I'll surprise you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: She's asleep.",
        "Paul: That's good. I don't want her to watch her parents officially splitting up.",
        "Meg: I can't believe you're making this so easy. I thought our lawyers would be hashing this out for months.",
        "Paul: I never meant to make you crazy. That was my job, right? I'm the crazy one.",
        "Meg: Don't say that.",
        "Paul: I just couldn't do it before, I'm sorry. I needed some time to get used to the idea that you and I are over. This isn't easy for me.",
        "Meg: Look, if you need more time --",
        "Paul: No, I want to get it over with. Last thing I want is to prolong losing you. I do wish that -- I know I've done too much damage for you to forgive me.",
        "Meg: You know, maybe once the divorce is final, we can put all that behind us.",
        "Paul: I have to ask you for something. I need some kind of access to Eliza. I need some kind of visitation. Losing you is one thing, please don't ask me to lose my daughter too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You may not want to hear this, but Meg did a very brave thing today.",
        "Josie: Trying to trap Craig?",
        "Dusty: He is a dangerous guy. And she put herself on the line to nail him. I admire that.",
        "Josie: Well, so, Paul was wrong.",
        "Dusty: About what?",
        "Josie: He said you like your women weak and needy. But your hat's off to Meg for hanging tough.",
        "Dusty: When did Paul say this?",
        "Josie: Earlier today, when I went to go see him. What? Does it bother you that I went to go see Paul?",
        "Dusty: No, what bothers me is, you didn't tell me this before we sat down.",
        "Josie: Well, you didn't tell me about your little plot with Meg. So I guess now we're even.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Mrs. Snyder. Just the woman I wanted to see.",
        "Janet: Really?",
        "Craig: I've been trying to track down your husband.",
        "Janet: I think I know what this is about.",
        "Craig: I'm sure he's made no secret of his dislike for me. But he really has no business telling Carly who she can see and who she can't. And why should he even care at this point?",
        "Janet: You're preaching to the choir. I completely agree with you.",
        "Craig: You do?",
        "Janet: Yes, I told Jack that he was out of line. He's on his way to Carly's to tell her he's backing off.",
        "Craig: Really? That's incredible. How did you manage that?",
        "Janet: I can be very persuasive.",
        "Craig: Ah. Hidden talents. I'm impressed, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: No, I'm not kidding. I was wrong. It's none of my business who you invite into your home.",
        "Carly: I don't know what to say.",
        "Jack: What I'm most sorry about is that I upset you.",
        "Carly: Does this mean that you won't try and take the kids?",
        "Jack: Carly, I would never ever do that to you.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Maybe I overreacted.",
        "Carly: Maybe?",
        "Jack: I'm just protective of my kids. And this thing with Parker and Craig -- I guess we're just going to have to trust Parker. We've taught him right from wrong. Now it's up to him.",
        "Carly: Don't worry. Craig is not going to corrupt him.",
        "Jack: I certainly hope not.",
        "Carly: And he's not going to corrupt me either, you know. I'm a big girl.",
        "Jack: Okay. I'm not going to tell you what to do.",
        "Carly: Well, that's very big of you.",
        "Jack: I just wanted you to know where I stand. I should get going.",
        "Carly: Thanks for stopping by. Come in here!",
        "Craig: I waited for Jack to leave.",
        "Carly: I don't know what you said to him, but -- it worked!",
        "Craig: Didn't I tell you I'd take care of it?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Yeah, I just didn't expect instantaneous results like that!",
        "Craig: What can I say? I'm good! And I've always got your back.",
        "Craig: Well, aren't you going to thank me?",
        "Carly: Yes, first, I want to figure out how you made Jack do a complete 180.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't like to give away trade secrets, but, this is what I do best. Protect the people I care about. Now, if you'd accept my proposal, I'll protect you too.",
        "Carly: This from the man who put my sister in a coma.",
        "Craig: We both know how much I regret what happened to Rosanna. But you know Carly, you and I are very much alike. We've both done things we regret. And we don't like to be judged by our past mistakes.",
        "Carly: You're right about that.",
        "Craig: I feel like I'm finally getting my priorities straight. I have a son who means the world to me. I want to give him a home with a father he can believe in, a mother who would love him like her own. I want him to have siblings that he can look up to -- like Parker.",
        "Carly: Well, Parker's already his uncle.",
        "Craig: I'd like them to be closer. I'd like us all to be closer. Especially you and me.",
        "Carly: You know what -- I don't know, Craig.",
        "Craig: Aren't you tired of being single when it seems that everyone you know is happily married?",
        "Carly: Yes, I am.",
        "Craig: Aren't you sick of struggling with the bills? Worrying if your business will stay open so you can provide for your family?",
        "Carly: Definitely.",
        "Craig: Wouldn't you like to have a real partner in this life? Not just someone who'll support you, but stand up for you? A man who would defend you, and give you everything that you need?",
        "Carly: You make it sound very tempting.",
        "Craig: All you have to do is say you'll marry me, and I'll take care of you and your kids. It's just that simple.",
        "Carly: Okay. Sure, why not?",
        "Craig: What did you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Is she going to eat all that?",
        "Meg: We'll see. She gets pretty hungry when she wakes up. Takes after me, I guess.",
        "Paul: I hope she takes after you in every way.",
        "Meg: Well, I never wanted to deprive you of your child, or deprive Eliza of her father. I just want to keep our daughter safe.",
        "Paul: I know. I haven't been behaving like a father should, but I want to be the kind of father that Eliza's proud to have. I'd really like to be the kind of man that you fell in love with in the first place.",
        "Meg: We can't get that back.",
        "Paul: Well, the divorce is something that I'll have to learn to live with. But, please, don't ask me to live without Eliza.",
        "Meg: Okay. Look, if you can stay this way, rational and reasonable, we'll talk about visitation.",
        "Paul: Okay. That's all I'm asking.",
        "Meg: But our marriage is over.",
        "Paul: I -- I've only ever wanted what's best for you.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Do you want to feed her?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'd love that.",
        "Meg: Don't worry, it's easy. Here, go pick her up.",
        "[Eliza cries]",
        "Paul: Hi, beautiful. Daddy's got lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You know how I feel. I think you should stay away from Paul.",
        "Josie: Well, of course you feel that way. He hired me to set you up. But he wasn't in his right mind. And I had no idea of what I was getting into. The important thing is, that all of that is over.",
        "Dusty: No, for you, but like you said -- he's not right.",
        "Josie: Are you saying that I can't be friends with both you and Paul?",
        "Dusty: Sometimes you gotta choose.",
        "Josie: Do I have to choose right now? Because if I do, then, you better make me an offer -- show me what I'd be getting if I'd choose you.",
        "Dusty: I'll let you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, thank you.",
        "Janet: Mmm. So -- how did it go with Carly?",
        "Jack: Well, I told her what you said. I told her that I'm leaving it up to her. That she should feel free to date whoever she wants, including Craig.",
        "Janet: And how did she react?",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: She was surprised, but definitely happy. And I got to tell you, all the tension and all the hostility just disappeared like that.",
        "Janet: See, I'm a genius, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, you gave me good advice there, Babe.",
        "Janet: Now that you're not pressuring Carly to back off from Craig, she'll lose interest. And everybody's happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Are my ears playing tricks on me? Did you say what I think you said?",
        "Carly: Don't make me say it again, Craig. I might change my mind.",
        "Craig: Fine, I'll take yes for an answer. Shall we seal the deal with a kiss?",
        "Carly: Don't push your luck.",
        "Craig: I guess there's plenty of time for that later. Right now, I have to go find the biggest engagement ring that money can buy. Thank you, Carly. You've just made me the happiest man alive.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Vienna: Why are you so upset?",
        "Katie: I think my marriage is over.",
        "Janet: It's from Carly.",
        "Jack: What for?",
        "Janet: She wants us to join her for drinks, tonight, at Metro. Let's go --",
        "Jack: No way!",
        "Craig: The days of Jack Snyder calling the shots for Carly are over.",
        "Lily: You can't marry Craig Montgomery!",
