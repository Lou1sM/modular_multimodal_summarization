        "Dr. Oliver tells Luke that he won't take Noah's case because he finds it a boring Case. Dr. Oliver also tells Luke that he thinks that he is being arrogant in assuming that Noah can go ahead of his other patients just because he has money. Luke tells Noah the bad news and Noah tells him that if Dr. Oliver won't do the operation he doesn't want another doctor to do it. Lily advises Luke that he should ask Damian to see if he can find another Dr. for Noah. Luke talks to Damian and explains that Noah has his heart set on Dr. Oliver and Damian tells Luke to blackmail Dr. Oliver by telling him he has information on him and the information could get his medical license revoked. Dr. Oliver flies to memorial and agrees to do the operation because Noah doesn't deserve to be blind. Dr. Oliver makes it clear to Luke that he doesn't like him at all because he thinks he can get anything he wants just because he is rich. Luke tells Noah the good news about the operation and also tells him that he lied to Dr. Oliver and he never had any incriminating information on him. Noah is shocked that Luke would do such a thing but he isn't mad at him and thanks him for making the operation possible.",
        "Maddie wants to do a Vlog for the paper asking if you can still be friends with an old boyfriend so she interviews Noah and takes him to Al's for a hamburger. Hunter arrives and asks Noah what its like to be blind and Noah likes that Hunter asks him questions and treats him normally not like a blind person. Noah buys Maddie and Hunter Lunch and then they go back to the newspaper office and listen to music loudly to see if Noah has a better sense of hearing since he has lost his sight. Maddie thanks Hunter for helping Noah today even though he didn't know he was helping him.",
        "Lily is angry at Damian after Luke tells him that Damian advised him that the ends justify the means to get Dr. Oliver to come to Oakdale. Lily confronts Damian and they argue and he almost tells her all he has done to make them a family. Meg calls Damian and tells him she will find a way to prove she isn't crazy and after she gets out he knows what will come next for him. Holden and Molly follow Snarky the orderly at Deerbrook to the Lakeview and question him but he doesn't say anything to them. Molly finds out the last call Sharkey got on his phone came from Damian. Molly tells Holden they have to get solid proof against Damian. Holden and Molly go to Deerbrook to talk to Meg who sobs because she is so happy that Holden and Molly believe her. Holden promises Meg that he will get her out of Deerbrook by proving she is telling the truth. Holden tells Meg to stay calm while he and Molly work to get poof against Damian. Molly talks to the police in Kentucky and fins out officer Grady took early retirement and moved to Chicago. Holden and Molly head to Chicago to talk to former officer Grady."

        "Damian: I'm paying you to make sure everything stays status quo while I'm out of town for a few days with my wife.",
        "Sharkey: Don't worry about it.",
        "Damian: No, I do worry. She had the entire staff fooled before. They were ready to release her.",
        "Sharkey: That's not gonna happen this time. Now that she's actually taking her meds, you don't have to worry about her any more, Mr. Grimaldi.",
        "Damian: I'm going to hold you to that.",
        "Sharkey: Listen, I'm a little short on cash. I could use an advance before you leave town.",
        "Damian: Don't push it. You'll get paid when you earn it.",
        "Meg: What do you want?",
        "Sharkey: Just making sure you're nice and quiet. Can't have you trying to escape every five minutes. It doesn't look good.",
        "Meg: I don't belong here.",
        "Sharkey: I'm gonna have to tell Dr. Wilson to up your dosage. Lucky you.",
        "Meg: Tell -- tell Damian that it won't work! [Voice breaking] I will prove what the two of you have done to me.",

        "Lily: Still hasn't called?",

        "Noah: He could be in surgery.",
        "Luke: Fine.",
        "Noah: Don't get mad at me. I'm the one that needs him to call back.",
        "Luke: I'm sorry, Noah.",
        "Lily: You know, my mother said that his waiting list is a year long.",

        "Luke: Finally. Yes, hello. Oh, no, you don't need to call me Mr. Snyder. Luke is fine.",
        "Reid: Mr. Snyder, my staff informs me that you've called close to three dozen times.",
        "Luke: [Chuckles] Yes, yes. Um, I have. I am calling about Noah Mayer.",
        "Reid: I've seen his file.",
        "Luke: You have? Great. Uh, when do you think you can get to Oakdale for a consultation?",
        "Reid: Um, let me see. How about, um, never?",
        "Luke: I'm sorry?",
        "Reid: Do you have any idea who I am?",
        "Luke: Yes, yes. That's why we're contacting you, Dr. Oliver.",
        "Reid: What makes you think that I could just drop everything and fly out to, uh -- where the hell is Oakdale?",
        "Luke: Uh -- Illinois. Well, we could come to you.",
        "Reid: You seem to think that I have the time of day for you, and I'm curious as to why.",
        "Luke: Uh -- I --",
        "Reid: I'm booked solid for a year.",
        "Luke: Well, we could double your fee. And as I said, we could come to you.",

        "Reid: I don't need your money, and I don't want your case.",

        "Maddie: \"Here's a question I know you all ask yourselves. Is it possible after a breakup to stay friends with your ex? Maybe the more important question is why would you want to? What are you trying to prove? Say you agree to something innocent, like lunch, and the check comes. Do you offer to pay, say you should split it --?\"",
        "Hunter: Pay it. Gives you the opportunity of showing him you don't need him for anything, including the check.",
        "Maddie: Really? Well, who knew?",
        "Hunter: Me, apparently.",
        "Maddie: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Hunter: What?",
        "Maddie: You still have the price tag on your suit.",
        "Hunter: I know, I know. I'm just leaving it on to see if I like it.",
        "Maddie: What do you need a suit for?",
        "Hunter: Uh, Casey and Alison's wedding. Valentine's Day is less than a month away. Oh, no.",

        "Maddie: No, actually, what's really, really stupid is that I might be going to the wedding, too. Yeah. It's, uh, gonna make for another excellent blog entry. Um, \"Going to your ex-boyfriend's wedding on Valentine's Day -- emotional suicide or way to be a stalker?\"",
        "Hunter: I hear you. Everybody who's single feels like a loser on Valentine's Day. It's --",

        "Clerk: Always, Sir.",
        "Holden: Okay, so tell me this -- where does an orderly get a roll of dough like that?",
        "Molly: Maybe he's dealing.",
        "Holden: Or maybe he's on somebody's payroll.",

        "Luke: Yeah. You should have heard the arrogant son of a -- look, Noah, I am not giving up, so you can't either, okay?",
        "Lily: You know what? I -- if this guy is impossible to deal with and he's unwilling to work with us, w -- we'll find another doctor to do the surgery?",
        "Noah: There's nobody else.",
        "Lily: Are you 100% sure of that?",
        "Noah: Yes. I did my research at the clinic. If I can't get Dr. Oliver, then this surgery's not happening.",
        "Luke: Well, Dr. Oliver it is, then.",
        "Noah: He just hung up on you, Luke. So look, thank you for trying, but -- he's my only chance. [Whispering]",
        "Lily: We'll find another surgeon.",
        "Luke: Mom, you heard Noah. He's done the research.",
        "Lily: Has he done the research worldwide, or just here in the states? You know what I'm saying. If there's anybody that can call in a favor on something like this, it's Damian.",
        "Luke: Okay. But I don't want to mention it to Noah until we know for sure. I don't want him to keep getting his hopes up.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Luke: Noah, um, are you gonna be okay here by yourself for a little bit?",
        "Noah: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Luke: Okay, because my mom and I have a -- a meeting at Worldwide.",

        "Hunter: I didn't mean you are a loser.",
        "Maddie: I already knew that, but thank you for the clarification.",
        "Hunter: I meant we're all losers. That is not what I meant. That came out wrong.",
        "Maddie: Yeah. Always does, hunter.",
        "Hunter: I know. It's like I -- I say the opposite of what I mean. It's like -- I try to say one thing, and then the opposite comes out. But you are not a loser, and that did not come out backwards.",
        "Maddie: You mean opposite?",
        "Hunter: Right! Well, do you like -- do you like the suit? I mean, not for what I said I bought it for. But do you -- do you like it in general?",
        "Maddie: Uh -- it's a little baggy.",
        "Hunter: It is?",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm, yeah. But I figure you have so much hot air inside of you that it will just fill out on its own.",
        "Hunter: Ha, ha, ha, retaliation. I like that. Can I take you out to lunch to make up for being a bonehead?",
        "Maddie: Sure.",
        "Hunter: Excellent.",
        "Maddie: Yes, but not today. I have to go meet with an ex to talk about my blog.",
        "Hunter: Casey?",
        "Maddie: No, no. Noah Mayer.",
        "Hunter: You went out with Noah Mayer?",
        "Maddie: Yes, I did.",
        "Hunter: Isn't he gay?",
        "Maddie: He is now.",
        "Hunter: Ah, so you're the one who turned him. That was a joke, on purpose.",
        "Maddie: Lucky.",
        "Hunter: He had an accident, uh, right? He's blind now, or something.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, or something.",
        "Hunter: So let me get this straight. You're going to say your gay, blind ex- boyfriend about being friends for the blog?",
        "Maddie: Do you hear yourself?",
        "Hunter: What did I do?",
        "Maddie: Just quit while you're not ahead.",
        "Hunter: Done.",
        "Maddie: Oh, and you're gonna need a tie. But, um, not stripes.",

        "Damian: Hello. Who is this?",
        "Meg: Your pet monkey's not here right now.",
        "Damian: Meg. I hope your attendant, Mr. Sharkey, is taking good care of you.",
        "[Meg scoffs]",
        "Meg: We both know who Mr. Sharkey is taking care of, Damian. You think your money can buy you whatever you want, but that's not always the case, is it?",
        "Damian: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Meg: You think you can keep me in here like this? Pay them to keep me put away?",
        "Damian: You're not making any sense.",
        "Meg: [Laughs] I am. And they're gonna know it soon enough. Now, when they do let me out, you know what happens next, don't you?",
        "Damian: I told you never to threaten me again, and yet you --",
        "Lily: Damian, who's on the phone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Just so you know, this might not be pretty.",
        "Molly: I was just sleeping with a married congressman, Holden. Not much can shock me. Room service. We lied.",
        "Holden: Hello, Mr. Sharkey.",
        "Sharkey: What do you want?",
        "Holden: We were in the lobby. We saw that you checked in.",
        "Molly: Yeah, so we were wondering if it might be a good time to chat.",
        "Sharkey: It's not.",
        "Holden: We understand.",
        "Molly: Yeah. What's your boss? Uh, Dr. Wilson? What's his policy on staff nooners?",
        "Sharkey: I'm off-duty.",
        "Molly: Really? Cool. So we can just talk Wilson ourselves, then.",
        "Sharkey: Wait.",
        "Kiki: It's double if they watch.",
        "Holden: Wait for me at the hotel bar.",
        "Kiki: Ooh. Be quick. This is one drink.",
        "Sharkey: What is this?",
        "Holden: Do you know who I am? My sister's a patient at Deerbrook. You work on her floor.",
        "Sharkey: So?",
        "Holden: So she doesn't seem to be getting any better.",
        "Sharkey: I wouldn't know.",
        "Holden: No? Well, I'm gonna tell you. She was getting better for a while there, but then she had sort of a setback, and I think something happened, maybe something on the inside the doctors didn't know about.",
        "Sharkey: I haven't laid a hand on her.",
        "Holden: I know that. Because if you had, I'd have broken both your wrists. So, you're gonna tell me what I need to know.",
        "Sharkey: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Molly: Oh, Holden? Last call received was from Grimaldi.",
        "Sharkey: What the hell?",
        "Holden: That's right, Mr. Sharkey. You're gonna tell me, why is Damian Grimaldi calling you?",
        "Holden: Answer me!",
        "Sharkey: Grimaldi was checking on your sister, okay?",
        "Holden: Actually, it's far from okay, since he has no relation to her at all. You know what? My sister -- she actually had a room here with Damian Grimaldi. These rooms -- pretty pricy, aren't they?",
        "Sharkey: Get out, or I'll call the police.",
        "Molly: Oh, we were just leaving. Have a nice day. Okay, so we know he might be on Damian's payroll --",
        "Holden: I got to go.",
        "Molly: Wait. Where are you gonna go?",
        "Holden: Where do you think?",
        "Molly: You can't go after Damian.",
        "Holden: The hell I can't.",
        "Molly: If you do, you'd be making a huge tactical error.",
        "Holden: Molly, we can't sit on this. We have to take what we found out and expose Damian.",
        "Molly: That's just it, Holden. We didn't find out a thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I'm sorry you had to hear that.",
        "Lily: Damian, who's threatening you?",
        "Damian: More of a power play, really. A shipyard in Sweden is holding a freighter in port. It's business as usual. Nothing for you to be concerned with. What brings you two here?",
        "Luke: I need your help.",
        "Damian: What happened?",
        "Luke: Do you remember that doctor I told you about, the -- the specialist that Noah kept mentioning?",
        "Damian: The one he thinks can perform the, uh, surgery to help him see again? Yeah.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, I spoke with him.",
        "Damian: And?",
        "Lily: He won't take Noah's case.",
        "Damian: Well, then, offer him more money, whatever he wants. It's not a problem.",
        "Luke: I did. He still refused.",
        "Lily: I don't think that we should be going away right now.",
        "Damian: What? Why? No, no, no. Lily, I -- I already reserved the room at the inn near faith's school. We're all set.",
        "Lily: Yeah, and our son is dealing with a very serious situation with his boyfriend. This isn't the time to take a vacation.",
        "Luke: Oh, now I feel really bad. I -- I really don't want you guys to change your plans because of us.",
        "Damian: We're not going to change anything.",
        "Lily: Damian --",
        "Damian: Lily, listen to me, please. I -- I'll handle this, all right? Why don't you go and get all the stuff we have to get for Faith, huh? And I'll see what I can do for Luke and Noah.",
        "Lily: You want me to go now?",
        "Damian: Yes, yes. Don't worry. I'll handle it. I'll take care of it.",
        "Lily: We won't go if you need us.",
        "Luke: I'm sorry. I'm just so desperate about Noah.",
        "Damian: Just tell me what you need, and I'll make it happen.",
        "Luke: Well, Mom thought that maybe you could help find another doctor, maybe somebody overseas.",
        "Damian: I can make a few calls.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but that's the thing. Noah has his heart set on this one guy, this Dr. Oliver. He's done his research, and he has all his hopes on him.",
        "Damian: Yeah, but he said he doesn't want to take on the case.",
        "Luke: Yeah, he said it bored him.",
        "Damian: That's new.",
        "Luke: And money didn't seem to sway him, either. How do I get this guy to change his mind?",
        "Damian: That's simple, son.",
        "Luke: I'm glad you think so.",
        "Damian: I know so. Make him an offer he can't refuse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: So, is this your official condolence call?",
        "Maddie: Condolence?",
        "Noah: Yeah. Sorry to hear you went blind. I brought you a pie.",
        "Maddie: Oh. Sorry. I don't have a pie.",
        "Noah: Well, good.",
        "Maddie: I'm writing a blog for \"The First Edition,\" Emily Stewart's new paper. I record an entry once a week.",
        "Noah: Oh, yeah, I know. I heard about that. That -- that's good for you.",
        "Maddie: Thanks.",
        "Noah: So, what's -- what's the subject?",
        "Maddie: Relationships.",
        "Noah: Oh.",
        "Maddie: Oh, yeah. Kind of why I'm here.",
        "Noah: What, you -- you want to write about us?",
        "Maddie: No, not specifically or anything.",
        "Noah: Ah. \"Video entry number one -- a cautionary tale for young girls. Never date a gay guy.\"",
        "Maddie: Wow. You are in a great mood.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, being blind will do that to you.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Well, then, we need to get out of here. What are you doing, hanging out here alone, anyway?",
        "Noah: I like it when nobody's here.",
        "Maddie: Including me?",
        "Noah: Maddie --",
        "Maddie: No. I'm gonna get your coat.",
        "Noah: Well, I don't --",
        "Maddie: No, no, no, no. We're gonna go to Al's. I'm hungry. It's lunchtime. You look like you could eat a burger and fries, so we're gonna go.",
        "Noah: I -- I am getting kind of hungry.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Here.",
        "Noah: But you have to write Luke a note, or he will send out a posse to find me when he gets back.",
        "Maddie: Fine. Consider it done. And bundle up. It's cold out there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: No, you heard me. I said that if Dr. Oliver doesn't take my call, he'll run the risk of losing his medical license. Yeah, I'll hold. [Whispering] Are you sure this is gonna work?",
        "Damian: Is this receptionist putting the doctor on the phone or what?",
        "Luke: Yes, yes, hello. I thought you'd like to talk to me.",
        "Reid: You're threatening to have my medical license revoked?",
        "Luke: Not if you take on Noah's case.",
        "Reid: Who the hell do you think you are?",
        "Luke: Well, I know who you are. I know the kind of things you've done, all in the name of healing. But I think we both know that the review board would have a field day if they had documented proof of how many times you bent the rules. Now, if you want to take that risk --",
        "Reid: What do you want?",
        "Luke: Just examine him and see if he's a good candidate for surgery. My father's jet is waiting for you at DFW. There's a car outside to take you to the airport.",
        "Reid: You've covered all the bases, haven't you?",
        "Noah: And once you get in Oakdale, there will be a car to take you to Memorial hospital. We'll be waiting.",
        "Reid: With flowers and candy, I hope.",
        "Luke: We just want Noah to get a fair chance.",
        "Reid: This is fair in your eyes, Mr. Snyder?",
        "Luke: See you soon.",
        "Damian: That was stupendous. Perfectly executed.",
        "Luke: Well, yeah, but I don't even know if the doctor's gonna get on the plane.",
        "Damian: I do. I'm so proud of you, son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Because running off to confront Damian before we got proof could backfire. That's why.",
        "Holden: You said yourself you're sure that Sharkey is on Damian's payroll.",
        "Molly: Yeah, but that's my gut feeling, Holden. That's not fact.",
        "Holden: Okay, so what do we do now?",
        "Molly: Now we work harder to get the proof we need. And we have to look at it from all angles, okay? What if Sharkey is on Damian's payroll, but it's not for the dark and twisty reason we're afraid of? What if Damian is so worried about Lily's safety that he's giving Sharkey a little extra cash to keep a closer eye on Meg so that she won't escape again and go after Lily? I know that you want to think the worst of this guy, but what if just this one time, you're wrong?",

        "Lily: Why does my husband need defending from anyone?",
        "Holden: I was complaining about Damian because he's forcing you to go out of town when Luke and Noah actually need him here, and Molly was telling me that Damian should be able to do whatever he wants.",
        "Molly: Yeah, because if your husband wants to get you out of town, who are we to object, right?",
        "Lily: First of all, Damian doesn't force me to do anything I don't want to do. And secondly, I don't need you to defend my husband.",
        "Molly: Just trying to help.",
        "Lily: Well, don't. You know, you're always so quick to think the worst of Damian. You know what? He's with Luke right now, trying to track down a specialist to help Noah.",
        "Holden: Oh. By track down, you mean \"Pay off\"?",
        "Lily: I thought the bottom line was to get someone to help Noah. You know what? I can't do this with you. I'll talk to Emma about the kids.",

        "Holden: Because the story's too thin. What am I supposed to tell her, that her husband's paying off the people at Deerbrook to keep Meg quiet without having proof?",
        "Molly: You're right. I was just testing you.",
        "Holden: Hmm.",

I, uh, talked to Dr. Oliver again, and he is on the Grimaldi jet on his way to Oakdale. He should be at Memorial within an hour. So if you could have Maddie get you there as soon as possible, that would be awesome. And -- and also, just call me back, you know? I want to make sure you're okay. Mom. Did you hear any of that?",

You have any idea how many people actually wait their turn to see me, who don't feel that they deserve to move to the front of the line just because they were born with blue blood in their veins? What makes you think that Mr. Mayer is more deserving of my time than anyone else?",

So I arranged for a long weekend in a beautiful inn right around the corner from your daughter, and all of the sudden, you -- you decide I have some sort of, uh, hidden agenda for wanting to do exactly what you've asked me to do?
