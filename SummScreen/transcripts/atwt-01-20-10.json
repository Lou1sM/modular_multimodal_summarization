        "Alison: I don't really know how to explain it. I don't know why he gets to me. He's one of these, like, tortured souls, you know? Like he's two different people on the inside and he -- and he can't control which one comes out. Which I know sounds crazy, but what's even -- what's even really crazy is the fact that I could possibly have feelings for someone like him. I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm a nurse. I have to help people. I even have this weird dream about him. It's my wedding day, and I'm wearing my dress, and I -- and I start to walk down the aisle. And then I'm -- I'm in this church with him, with Mick. I don't know what to make of it.",
        "Casey: Why are you talking like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I have to get back to the hospital.",
        "Barbara: You've been at the hospital all night long. You need sleep.",
        "Paul: Emily needs me.",
        "Barbara: She has an entire hospital staff taking care of her. You need some rest.",
        "Paul: She's lying in a bed by herself. She's suffering. And you -- have you finished going through the blood samples from you other trials?",
        "Mick: Not yet.",
        "Barbara: And what about Susan? Has the lab run her sample?",
        "Paul: Susan didn't find anything, and there's nothing in your profile that would explain why my mother didn't have this reaction and Emily did.",
        "Mick: No, I've ruled out my treatments, so something else must be causing her condition.",
        "Paul: You ruled them out?",
        "Mick: From the blood work, yes. I'm sorry. Paul, I was hoping that we would find something. No one wants to help Emily more than I do.",
        "Paul: I do appreciate it.",
        "Mick: And I will keep working, Paul, I promise you.",
        "Paul: Thanks.",
        "Mick: But your mother's right. You need to take care of yourself.",
        "Paul: [Sighs] All right. I'm gonna go take a shower.",
        "Barbara: Laying it on a little thick, aren't you?",
        "Mick: I thought I was being thoughtful and sympathetic.",
        "Barbara: I thought you were supposed to be James Stenbeck.",
        "Mick: You know, I could use a little help. I thought you wanted me to bond with Paul.",
        "Barbara: I'm having a little difficulty getting past the fact that you are responsible for Emily's condition.",
        "Mick: She will be fine. I told you, when the time comes.",
        "Barbara: And when is that?",
        "Mick: When Paul accepts me as his father. Our son is a deeply suspicious man.",
        "Barbara: My God. How did that happen?",
        "[Mick sighs]",
        "Mick: That's why I want to make everything right this time. But I need your help. All I want is to be back in this house with my family to make everything right for you and for Paul.",
        "Barbara: I'll see what I can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Lily, wait.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Damian: Well, thank you for not canceling our trip to see Faith.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] She sounded so upset when I told her we might not come. I -- I couldn't disappoint her.",
        "Damian: We'll finally have some time to ourselves.",
        "Lily: That's not what this trip is about.",
        "Damian: I know, I know. There's so much stress in our lives lately. It'll be good to get away.",
        "Lily: Maybe, but there's still some things that we need to work out.",
        "Damian: You mean the situation with Luke, Noah, and Dr. Oliver?",
        "Lily: Yes. Now is not the time.",
        "Damian: No. No, of course not. I just -- I do hope we won't spend all our time there arguing.",
        "Emma: Hello. Hello, Lily.",
        "Lily: Hello, Emma. I brought the kids' schedules for Holden. He's gonna watch them while we're away. Can we come in?",
        "Emma: I'd rather that you didn't.",
        "Lily: Well, there are a few things I need to explain on these.",
        "Emma: Go ahead.",
        "Lily: Well, I'd like to talk to Holden directly.",
        "Emma: Well, he's not here.",
        "Lily: Where is he?",
        "Emma: He's, uh, out of town.",
        "Lily: Since when?",
        "Emma: He left early this morning. They both did.",
        "Lily: \"They\"?",
        "Emma: Yes, he and Molly.",
        "Lily: What? I can't believe this! He knew I was counting on him to take care of the kids while we were away.",
        "Emma: He made arrangements for me to do it. So, you know, there's no problem.",
        "Lily: Where did he go?",
        "Emma: I don't know, but, uh, he said it was very important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Doesn't look like he's here.",
        "Molly: Boy, I sure hope the landlord didn't send us to the wrong place.",
        "Holden: Well, he said this is where Grady likes to hang out.",
        "Molly: Okay, well, we're probably just early. Which is good, because it gives you time to disappear.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Molly: Why?",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Molly: If Damian's paying the guy hush money, he is gonna shut down the minute he sees you.",
        "Holden: I'm not leaving you here alone. Once he realizes what's really going on here, this might get a little nasty.",
        "Molly: I think I can handle this guy.",
        "Holden: Hmm. I'm not leaving.",
        "Molly: Okay. Well, then, at least find some place to hide.",
        "Holden: Okay. I will do that.",
        "Molly: You know what? You are adorable when you worry.",
        "Holden: Thank you for doing this for my sister.",
        "Molly: I care about Meg, but I'm not just doing this for her.",
        "Holden: I know.",
        "Molly: You know, if you're gonna stare at me like that, the least you can do is buy me a drink.",
        "Grady: I know you, don't I?",
        "Molly: I'm sure it's not the first time that a lonely girl's tried to get a handsome guy like you to buy her a drink.",
        "Grady: No.",
        "Molly: No?",
        "Grady: You're that news reporter from New York, that got caught getting it on with that congressman.",
        "Molly: Oh -- that's right. Yeah. And here I thought Chicago would be far enough away from New York to leave all that behind.",
        "Grady: Well, I saw that video back home in Kentucky, so it's got to be pretty much everywhere.",
        "Molly: Great. Thanks for the good news. Now you really owe me a drink.",
        "Grady: Sure. Hey, another double for me, and -- and get the lady whatever she'd like.",
        "Molly: A double. A double sounds pretty good to me, too.",
        "Grady: Don't take this the wrong way, but I can see why that congressman cheated on his wife.",
        "Molly: [Laughs] I can't think of a wrong way to take that, Mister --",
        "Grady: Grady.",
        "Molly: Mr. Grady. I'm Molly Conlan. But then again, you already knew that, didn't you? So, uh, you say you're from Kentucky?",
        "Grady: Not anymore.",
        "Molly: Yeah. I hear that. Oh, thank you. Well, here's to getting out while the getting's good. [Both laugh] Mmm. Whoo! Thank you. That is some good stuff.",
        "Grady: The pleasure's all mine.",
        "Molly: Oh. I hope it's not that way for everything.",
        "Grady: You're a pistol.",
        "Molly: [Laughs] I can be. So, um, Mr. Grady, what are you getting away from?",
        "Grady: Lot of things.",
        "Molly: Oh, don't tell me. A wife and a girlfriend?",
        "Grady: Nothing like that, unfortunately.",
        "Molly: Well, I hope whatever you did wrong back in Kentucky -- I hope you had a lot of fun doing it.",
        "[Grady laughs]",
        "Molly: Next one's on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You know, you shouldn't be eavesdropping.",
        "Casey: I -- I wasn't, really. I just heard you talking to Emily, and I was -- I was scared you'd get upset if she didn't answer.",
        "Alison: Oh. No. No, I know that she's not gonna answer me. Um, just some doctors think that, um, coma patients can hear people talking and that it might help them come around. But I'm not really sure that I believe that.",
        "Casey: If you want, we can -- we can postpone the wedding and wait till Emily gets better.",
        "Alison: No, I don't want us to do that.",
        "Casey: I -- I just want you to be happy. And if you want Emily there --",
        "Alison: No, no. I don't want to wait, and I will be happy. I guess just part of me hopes that -- that she'll wake up in time to be there and that if we postpone it, she might never recover, which -- I know is ridiculous.",
        "Casey: No. Hey, hope is never ridiculous.",
        "Alison: You're the best. You know that?",
        "Casey: I'm glad someone else thinks so, 'cause I don't really know what I'm doing.",
        "Alison: No, just -- just being you.",
        "Casey: Oh. Well, I'm glad you like that, 'cause I'm actually really good at that.",
        "Alison: [Laughs] You -- you have other skills.",
        "Casey: Oh, really? How about you take a break and, uh, we'll go get a cup of coffee?",
        "Alison: Oh, actually, I can't. Um, I have to go to Fashions. Your grandmother called and said that there's new wedding dresses.",
        "Casey: Hmm.",
        "Alison: Would you please come with me?",
        "Casey: You want me to go shopping with you for wedding dresses?",
        "Alison: Yeah, yeah. I'd like your opinion.",
        "Casey: Isn't that bad luck?",
        "Alison: Seriously, please.",
        "Casey: All right. But if I freak out, it is on you.",
        "Alison: Okay. I'll be back soon, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mick left.",
        "Barbara: No, he's on the phone. He's trying to do everything he can to help Emily.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, he ought to. It's his fault.",
        "Barbara: Paul, there is no proof that his treatments caused her condition.",
        "Paul: There's no proof that it didn't.",
        "Barbara: That's not fair. I believe in him, and he is -- he is using all of his own resources to try to help us.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Paul: I got to take this.",
        "Barbara: Paul --",
        "Paul: Could be the hospital. Hello.",
        "Mick: Anything?",
        "Barbara: I tried.",
        "Paul: That's great. Thank you -- thank you so much for calling me. Thank you. Emily moved her hand. She could be waking up. I've got to get to the hospital.",
        "Barbara: That's not good. If he realizes that Emily was with you when she lost consciousness, it's over.",
        "Mick: I know.",
        "Barbara: So what do we do?",
        "Mick: Uh, don't worry. I'll handle it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I don't believe it. He knew I was counting on him to take care of the kids while we're away.",
        "Emma: I told you, Lily. He made arrangements for me to do it. You don't have to change your plans.",
        "Lily: He should have told me.",
        "Emma: Well, maybe he didn't think it was something you needed to know.",
        "[Damian remembering]",
        "Sharkey: Do you know what's going on?",
        "Damian: With what? With Meg?",
        "Sharkey: Try her brother.",
        "Damian: Holden? What about him?",
        "Sharkey: He showed up at my door with some broad, and they started asking a lot of questions about you, big guy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Damian: Excuse. I -- I have to take this.",
        "Lily: Anyway, here are the children's schedules. I'm sorry that you have to get stuck with this at the last minute.",
        "Emma: You know that I don't mind.",
        "Lily: That's not the point. It was thoughtless of Holden to go away without telling me.",
        "Emma: Lily, you're remarried now. You have a life of your own, totally separate from his. Don't you think that he has a right to that kind of life himself?",
        "Damian: I'll take care of this when I get back in town. Are you sure it can't wait? Fine, then.",
        "[Damian exhales sharply]",
        "Damian: Lily, you will not believe this.",
        "Lily: You have to go to work?",
        "Damian: I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: What about our trip?",
        "Damian: I don't know.",
        "Lily: You're the one that's been pushing to go.",
        "Damian: I know, I know. I -- I'll make it up to you, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Let's have another.",
        "[Grady exhales sharply]",
        "Molly: I used to bartend, you know? [Laughs]",
        "Grady: Very good.",
        "Molly: I am, thank you. Mmm. That -- that is really good. [Laughs] So, what did you do for work back in Kentucky?",
        "Grady: I was a cop.",
        "Molly: A cop? I knew it. I knew you were a man of action. Bet you caught your share of bad guys, didn't you?",
        "Grady: I did okay.",
        "Molly: Hmm.",
        "Grady: And I'll tell you something. Back home, they miss me, a lot.",
        "Molly: I'm sure they do. [Laughs]",
        "Grady: You want to dance?",
        "Molly: To this?",
        "Grady: Come on.",
        "Molly: Really? [Clears throat] Wow. You're a terrific dancer.",
        "Grady: You feel pretty good, too.",
        "Molly: Thanks.",
        "Grady: If you really want to see my moves, I got a place pretty close by. We can both just head up and see what develops.",
        "Molly: What do you mean by that, Ossfer?",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "Grady: Oh, I don't know. Maybe something like -- this.",
        "Molly: Mmm. Slow down there, Tiger.",
        "Grady: I just want to show you a Kentucky lawman is better than some New York politician any day.",
        "Molly: [Laughs] I am so convinced of that. But you know what? Why don't you give me a minute? Hold that thought while I go make myself beautiful, okay?",
        "Grady: You don't need to change a thing, hot stuff.",
        "Molly: [Laughs] That is so sweet. But really, why don't you go refill our drinks, and I'll be right back. Okay?",
        "[Grady sighs]",
        "Holden: Okay, we're done here.",
        "Molly: Holden --",
        "Holden: He's dangerous.",
        "Molly: He kissed me. That's all.",
        "Holden: That's all?",
        "Molly: It's not a big deal.",
        "Holden: [Groans] It is a big deal.",
        "Molly: Oh, you're even cute when you're jealous.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. I'm -- I'm not jealous. I just don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Molly: Holden, if you want me to find out what this guy knows about Meg and Damian, then you have to let me work.",
        "Holden: If he so much as touches you again --",
        "Molly: He won't.",
        "Holden: It's Lily.",
        "Molly: Better get it.",
        "Holden: You're cute when you get jealous, too.",
        "Molly: No, no, no, no. Not here, okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.",
        "Holden: I'm not leaving you here alone.",
        "Molly: Holden, I'm fine. Besides, I'll be able to play him better if you're not sitting or staring over my shoulder.",
        "Holden: This is such a bad idea.",
        "Molly: It's what I do, okay? Go talk to Lily, and I'll meet you back at the hotel. Hey, big guy. [Laughs] Did you miss me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Don't tell me this is some kind of romantic getaway.",
        "Emma: Well, it just might be.",
        "Lily: And that comes before the kids?",
        "Emma: Excuse me? When has Holden ever put anyone before his kids?",
        "Lily: He's not here. You know, if he's just gonna go running off with Molly anytime he wants --",
        "Emma: Tell me something, Lily. Why are you so concerned about what goes on between Holden and Molly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You need to live for me, Em. Can you show me how you can move your hand? I know. All right, I -- I felt that. Do it again. Em, can you hear me? Em, if you can hear me, move your hand again. All right, I'm gonna get the doctor, okay? I'll be right back.",
        "Barbara: How is she?",
        "Paul: She moved her hand. I got to get a doctor.",
        "Barbara: I'm going with you.",
        "Mick: Aah! [Breathing heavily] Just relax. You can do it. You can do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: W -- where are you going?",
        "Alison: The dressing room.",
        "Casey: Are you sure?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I need your help with the zipper.",
        "Casey: What zipper? There's no zipper.",
        "Alison: Well, we'll find something else for you to do.",
        "Casey: [Sighs] I really think I should wait outside.",
        "Alison: Okay, if you don't want to see me with the dress on, just close your eyes.",
        "Casey: And miss the best part -- you getting undressed?",
        "Alison: So, are you having fun?",
        "Casey: I've never been happier. Mm, mm, mm, mm.",
        "Alison: We shouldn't do this here.",
        "Casey: But it's really hot? Don't you think so?",
        "Alison: Yes, very.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Casey: Don't -- don't answer it. No, no.",
        "Alison: It might be about Emily.",
        "Casey: [Sighs] You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Hello.",
        "Mick: You told me that if I ever felt like I was going in the wrong direction or, um, losing the war within myself that I should call you. So can you help me?",
        "Alison: Now?",
        "Mick: Please.",
        "Alison: I -- I can't now.",
        "Casey: It's not Emily, is it?",
        "Mick: I don't know what's happening.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'm sorry. I -- I can't.",
        "Mick: Please. I need you.",
        "Alison: I said no.",
        "Casey: Who's that?",
        "Alison: God, one of those surveys.",
        "Casey: Oh, I hate them.",
        "Alison: Okay, you -- you have to stop.",
        "Casey: What? Why?",
        "Alison: Because I -- I have to put that dress on.",
        "Casey: Okay. I'm helping you get undressed.",
        "Alison: No, Casey, you -- you were right. You have to go. It's -- its bad luck. Please.",
        "Casey: Fine. That's -- if that's what you really want.",
        "Alison: It is, thanks.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I want you to tell me about one time that you just couldn't resist temptation.",
        "Grady: Why?",
        "Molly: Well, it's only fair, right? I mean, you know all about me, so --",
        "Grady: If I tell you, can we go back to my room?",
        "Molly: Only if you promise to show me your handcuffs.",
        "Grady: Okay. I got paid off to cover up DNA evidence that proved a guy wasn't dead.",
        "Molly: Really? Who would want to pay you for that?",
        "Grady: Well, he wanted the guy's wife to think he was dead.",
        "Molly: Oh. I get it. But didn't the wife find out?",
        "Grady: Not until after she was remarried, which I'm guessing was the point.",
        "Molly: Oh. Well, so what happened with the wife? What did she do?",
        "Grady: I don't know.",
        "Molly: Wow. You sure do have some lowlifes in Kentucky.",
        "Grady: [Laughs] Actually, he's from around here.",
        "Molly: Chicago?",
        "Grady: Nearby. Place called Oakdale.",
        "Molly: Well, I hope he paid you a lot of money.",
        "Grady: How do you think I could afford to leave the force, come back up here and meet you?",
        "Molly: Oh, you ought to send him a thank-you note.",
        "Grady: You ready to go see my handcuffs?",
        "Molly: Yeah, just as soon as I get back from the little girl's room, okay?",

        "Molly: Not my friend. Yours. Morning Kim.",
        "Damian: I don't have any friends in Chicago.",

        "Damian: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Molly: No? Well, your buddy, Officer Grady, knows exactly what I'm talking about, and he told me how desperate you were to marry Lily. He said you paid him to hide the DNA evidence proving that Holden was still alive.",
        "Damian: That's crazy.",
        "Molly: Speaking of crazy, I bet you panicked big-time when Meg found out what you'd done. Yeah, she's been telling the truth all along about you, hasn't she?",
        "Damian: You can think whatever you want to.",
        "Molly: You know what I think? I think that you paid that sleaze ball Sharkey to make everyone continue to think that Meg's a nut case, yeah.",
        "Damian: You know you can't prove any of this.",
        "Molly: Watch me. Let go!",
        "Damian: Molly, I'm telling you, you don't want to do this.",
        "Molly: Oh, yeah? Are you kidding me? I can't wait to do this.",
        "Damian: I'm warning you, if the truth comes out, it will ruin your life.",
        "Molly: My life? I think you've got that backwards.",

        "Damian: And for you.",
        "Molly: Oh, I don't think so.",
        "Damian: Listen to me, Molly. When Grady told me the DNA from the crash wasn't Holden's, I didn't think it meant it was a lie. I thought it meant he -- he'd been thrown from the car as he went over the ravine or that maybe he had died before the crash.",
        "Molly: Yeah, well, too bad for you you were wrong on both counts.",
        "Damian: I didn't tell Lily about the DNA because I wanted to spare her the pain of false hope.",

        "Molly: Leave you.",
        "Damian: And go straight back to Holden. Yeah. You know she will, and you know he'll take her right back. Which is why we both have reason for you to keep this to yourself.",
        "Molly: I am not a liar.",
        "Damian: I suspect that's not entirely true, Molly, but that's beside the point.",
        "Molly: Go to hell, Damian.",
        "Damian: Like it or not, we both have a lot to lose if the truth comes out. But you can keep that from happening. All you have to do is keep your pretty little mouth shut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why don't you want to go with me to Vegas and marry me?",
        "Casey: Because we would regret it for the rest of our lives.",
        "Alison: I wouldn't.",
        "Casey: Yes -- yes, you would. I want this to be a real wedding. This is really big for both of our families.",
        "Alison: I don't care.",
        "Casey: Yes -- yes, you do. And it -- it's still bad luck for the -- the marriage Gods, you know? They really want a big, blowout thing. It's --",
        "Alison: The marriage Gods?",
        "Casey: That's right. And I hope we just -- we didn't blow it by my seeing you in your dress.",
