        "A BABY STORY Craig rushed Carly to the ER. Mike, Jack, and Emily are there, also. As Dr. Susan tries to help Carly to the examining room, she has another painful cramp. Carly rambles a guilt-filled conversation about her loving him & her making a BIG mistake before they married & if he would leave her forever. He figures that she's just upset about the baby & reassures her that he loves her, etc. Jack asked her what she was doing when she got into such pain & she had to mention Craig. At that moment, Jack became furious & yelled at Craig about making his wife go back to work. He said that he had to \"let off some steam\" and left Craig to chit-chat w/Mike. Mike thanks Craig for \"taking the bullet\" for him & Craig states that he didn't do it FOR him, but he will pay. Carly gets carted off the sonogram while Jack's away. After she gets back, her and Emily include Susan into the lie of conception. She explains that she wants Jack to think that she's eight weeks preggers. Susan doesn't want to know the details of why. Back in Milltown, Carly tells Jack that they're going to have a baby in July.",
        "TEEN SCENE Jack and Aaron have a nice family talk about obsessive women & broken down cars while at Java. Jack leaves when he hears the news about Carly. Aaron tells Alison that she lookes cute in overalls and boots & of course, she's glowing with joy. Aaron has a letter for Lucy and tells Alison that he's going to deliver it himself.

        "Aaron: \"Remember that night we helped Luke with his science project? And then later, we were sitting on the porch, I told you I wanted to get my mechanic's license, and you told me to just go for it? Well, guess what -- today I got a job at Burt's garage, apprenticing as Burt's assistant. You always could make me dream, Lucy, and that hasn't changed. What I'm not sure you know is that in every dream I have, you're always there, too. That'll never change, either.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I don't know what's wrong with it. Just -- tell Margo I'm waiting at Java underground for a tow truck if she needs me, all right? Thanks. Hey, Aaron. Never pegged you for a double latte kind of guy.",
        "Aaron: Well, you, either. I would have guessed black coffee and a doughnut.",
        "Jack: You would've been right, minus the doughnut. But don't tell Carly. She loves this place. You mind?",
        "Aaron: No, please.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Aaron: So -- how come you're not getting a cruller at Al's?",
        "Jack: Easy with the doughnut jokes, please. My car is outside, deader than a doornail. I'm waiting for a tow.",
        "Aaron: What happened?",
        "Jack: I don't know. It starts, but it won't move.",
        "Aaron: You want me to take a look at it?",
        "Jack: No, you don't need to do that.",
        "Aaron: You know, I am working at Burt's garage now. He hired me as an apprentice.",
        "Alison: Me, too. We're working together.",
        "Jack: Really? What do you know?",
        "Alison: And I even got Oakdale V.O. Tech to -- to call it an internship, so I'm gonna even get credits. I mean, how cool is that? Oh, and I can't wait to show you my monster steel-toe boots I just bought. You know what? I'll model them for you.",
        "Aaron: No, you don't really have to do that. What?",
        "Jack: Nothing. It's just that you bring a whole new meaning to the term \"popular mechanic.\"",
        "Aaron: There is nothing going on between me and Alison, all right? She knows I'm madly in love with Lucy.",
        "Jack: Oh, yes, of course, that explains why she broke you out of jail and she followed you halfway across the country. Be careful, Aaron. If there's one thing I know, never underestimate an obsessed woman. Alison will do anything she can to make you forget Lucy.",
        "Aaron: Couldn't happen.",
        "Jack: What makes you so sure?",
        "Aaron: Jack, how 'bout I take a look at your car, buddy?",
        "Jack: All right, you have learned one thing -- when a man's car is broken, the mechanic holds all the cards. You don't want to talk, we don't talk. Come on.",
        "Aaron: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Henry, my good man. Come on in. Welcome.",
        "Henry: One for the host.",
        "Katie: Oh, you shouldn't have.",
        "Henry: One for the hostess.",
        "Katie: You really shouldn't have.",
        "Henry: I know, but I couldn't resist, guys. Believe it or not, this is the first dinner party I've been invited to since I got back to this little cow town. [Door closes] oh, you -- got problems with the raccoons still trying to break in here?",
        "Simon: No, Henry, we haven't got any problem with them. Just -- snakes.",
        "Henry: Oh. Well, hey, what's for dinner? Smells like air freshener. I thought we were having pot roast.",
        "Katie: Well, no, actually, Henry, the only dead meat here tonight is you.",
        "Henry: Me?",
        "Simon: Yeah. That is, unless you tell us why Mike Kasnoff wanted a piece of you last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Susan.",
        "Mike: Carly.",
        "Craig: Susan, could we get some help here, please?",
        "Susan: What's going on?",
        "Carly: I'm pregnant, and I had some cramps, and I'm scared.",
        "Susan: Don't be scared. Cramps are not that unusual during the first trimester. But you were right to come in. Where's Jack?",
        "Carly: He's at -- he's at work. I should call him.",
        "Susan: Not right now. Come with me first. We'll do a pelvic, we'll see what's going on. Okay?",
        "Mike: I'll find Jack for you.",
        "Carly: Don't scare him. Just tell him -- just tell him to be here as soon as he can.",
        "Craig: Anything I can do?",
        "Carly: Call Emily, would you? And ask her if she can keep Parker for a little bit longer. And -- oh.",
        "Susan: Oh, honey, come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You know what I just remembered? I'm on a diet. And I hate to not eat and run, but --",
        "Simon: But you just got here, Henry.",
        "Katie: And we love our company. It gets so lonely way out here in the country.",
        "Simon: But we've been kind of busy tonight, haven't we, honey? Because --",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Simon: -- Jack Snyder was here earlier, and he was wondering why Mike Kasnoff went after you last night. In fact, we're all wondering why.",
        "Henry: Really? Detective Snyder, he way overreacted there. And Mike and I, we were talking, you know, just like guys do.",
        "Simon: Oh, you had a good time, did you?",
        "Henry: Yeah. A lot better time than I'm having right now. What's up with the hospitality, kids, huh? Your warm welcome is -- a little light on the \"warm\" part. So Simon, if you'll just stop blocking the door --",
        "Simon: You see, I've got a pretty good idea why Mike was itching to get his hands on you, but you can either confirm my suspicions --",
        "Henry: Well, you know --",
        "Simon: Or, or, or, I can --",
        "Henry: What's so -- wait a minute.",
        "Simon: Henry, Henry, Henry, this is a very nice jacket. What is it? Cashmere?",
        "Katie: It sure is, and made in England.",
        "Henry: Fine, I'll buy American next time, okay?",
        "Simon: Where did you get all the money, Henry?",
        "Henry: Huh? What -- what -- what -- what -- I told you. I did that job for Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Katie: Oh, you blew that paycheck on martinis and bimbos long ago, Henry. Just fess up.",
        "Henry: My mother always said it was impolite to discuss personal finances.",
        "Simon: Whoo.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "Simon: The sweet smells of Cuba.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah. And, Simon, I got one for you, as well, for when we're done with dinner.",
        "Simon: Oh.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Henry: They're worth $35 there!",
        "Simon: Remember what mommy said -- no discussing personal finances.",
        "Henry: Oh, man, I can't look.",
        "Katie: Oh, poor Henry. Want a drink?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Katie: I wasn't talking to you, silly. I was talking to the plant here.",
        "Henry: Katie. Katie, aw, Katie, that's $200 worth of brandy there. Your grandfather wasn't born when this was distilled.",
        "Katie: Well, no wonder Planty loves it.",
        "Simon: Look at this coat here. Katie, I think we could make quite a nice scarf out of this. What do you think? It's cashmere, after all.",
        "Katie: Beautiful.",
        "Simon: You got the scissors handy?",
        "Katie: Right over here, darling.",
        "Simon: Nice one. Always handing out scissors. All right, just the sleeve. I think that will do just fine. A one --",
        "Henry: All right, Carly paid me!",
        "Katie: How much?",
        "Henry: $50,000.",
        "Simon: 50,000 blackmailed dollars.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Natalie is beyond beautiful, Holden.",
        "Holden: You don't want -- you don't have to whisper. She has two brothers and a sister, and she can sleep through anything.",
        "Molly: Really? Even all those bows and things that Rose put in her hair?",
        "Holden: Yes, even those.",
        "Molly: Lily must be so excited to have her twin sister back in town.",
        "Holden: You should have seen the two of them dressing her. They were like two 10-year-olds with a doll.",
        "Molly: Well, who can blame them? She's gorgeous. Do you ever wonder what Abigail was like at that age?",
        "Holden: Sure. And you know what? No matter how many kids I have, I will always regret missing those early years with Abby and Aaron.",
        "Molly: Well, at least you have a new baby in the house.",
        "Holden: Sounding a little wistful there, Molly? Are you having pangs?",
        "Molly: Natalie would make a rock have pangs. It'll pass. Or not.",
        "Holden: Okay, come on, spit it out.",
        "Molly: I don't know what's wrong with me. But from the minute I saw Mike holding J. J., I've had babies on the brain. 'Cause he looked so comfortable. Like he was born to be a dad. And you can tell that he wants to be.",
        "Holden: Then what's the problem? You love him, right?",
        "Molly: But I can't rush into marriage so soon after. What would everybody say?",
        "Holden: Who cares what everyone would say? What would Jake say?",
        "Molly: \"Rock on, babe!\" I know that some people think that I haven't mourned him long enough -- but I miss him every day. 'Cause he made everything so wonderfully simple.",
        "Holden: You know what else he'd tell you? You're the only one living your life.",
        "Molly: Um, I really don't care what other people think. Just the important people, like Abigail.",
        "Holden: You know, Abigail never said anything to me about you and Mike.",
        "Molly: Yeah, maybe not. But Holden -- I mean, she left -- she moved to California right after Mike and I got together. Is that a statement or what?",
        "Holden: No, it's not a statement. It's her saying that she wants to go swimming in January, and that's all it is. And it's a good thing, because you need to learn how to be happy again, and she needs to learn that, too.",
        "Molly: I wish I could believe that's all it was. But there were times when she saw Mike and I -- there was this look in her eye. And I couldn't help feeling like I disappointed her.",
        "Holden: You didn't disappoint her. So give yourself a break. What you need to do, is listen to your heart. And I think you did that with Mike, and you know what? That took a lot of guts.",
        "Molly: You're a really good friend.",
        "Holden: I'm just trying to look at your life through your eyes. That's it.",
        "Molly: My watery eyes. Thank you for not telling me how to live it, okay? 'Cause there's nothing like when you open up your worst fears to somebody and they let you know all of your mistakes. Everything you did wrong --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Molly: That's me. That's exactly what I've been doing to somebody that I love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Craig, where's Carly?!",
        "Craig: She's inside with your mother.",
        "Emily: How's the baby?",
        "Craig: We don't know anything yet. Oh, where's Parker?",
        "Emily: Uh, with Hal. What about Jack? Where's Jack?",
        "Craig: Mike Kasnoff's looking for him.",
        "Emily: What, Mike -- he's here?",
        "Craig: Well, he's building a Burn unit at the hospital. Why do you care?",
        "Emily: I -- no, it's just that I figured if he was here, that means he and Molly were called and it might be something serious about the baby.",
        "Craig: No, Molly's not here. Just you and me.",
        "Emily: Right. Wow, poor Carly. You know, it's really scary to be pregnant and cramping like that. I mean, did it come on all by itself, or did something bring it on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Come on. Take some long deep breaths. That's right. Just breathe. Everything seems normal.",
        "Carly: Are you sure?",
        "Susan: Pretty much, but I'm ordering a sonogram just to be safe.",
        "Carly: A sonogram?",
        "Susan: Well, it's the only way we can confirm that the baby is not at risk.",
        "Carly: Could we do that right away?",
        "Susan: I think we could get it done within the hour.",
        "Carly: No, why can't we do it right now? Right this minute?",
        "Susan: Well, one thing is that you're still a little stressed. Let's wait till Jack gets here.",
        "Carly: No! Susan, please. That will be too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You are so awesome, Aaron. You totally fixed Jack's car.",
        "Aaron: Just a loose timing belt.",
        "Jack: Well, I couldn't have fixed it. I'll tell you that. Listen, I'm gonna tell Burt he's got an excellent apprentice.",
        "[Alison clears her throat twice]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. Two excellent apprentices. Thanks. Listen, guys, you saved me a towing charge. The least I could do is buy you dinner.",
        "Aaron: No --",
        "Mike: Jack --",
        "Alison: We'd love it! We'd love it!",
        "Mike: They told me at the station that you'd be here.",
        "Jack: What's up?",
        "Mike: Carly's in the hospital.",
        "Jack: What -- what happened?",
        "Mike: She started cramping. They're running some tests to make sure the baby's all right.",
        "Jack: All right. Come on, let's go. Thanks, guys.",
        "Alison: Poor Jack. I hope Carly's okay.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Alison: Those two have already been through a lot together.",
        "Aaron: Well, when two people really love each other, they can make it through anything. And that's exactly how I want it to be for me and Lucy. Did she talk to you at all about that letter?",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. I'm just, you know, wondering if she said anything, you know, like, \"it was nice to hear from Aaron.\" Or -- I don't know. I just want -- I want to know her reaction so I can write her another letter. That's all.",
        "Alison: You're writing her again?",
        "Aaron: Did she say anything at all about the other one?",
        "Alison: Nothing.",
        "[Aaron sighs]",
        "Aaron: That doesn't sound like Lucy. Are you sure she got it? I mean, you did give it to her, didn't you?",
        "Alison: Of course I gave Lucy your letter. I'm not a total idiot.",
        "Aaron: But, did she read it?",
        "Alison: Duh! What else is she gonna do with it? Stick it to her forehead?",
        "Aaron: Then something's wrong.",
        "Alison: Why? Because she didn't respond? I mean, she is kind of busy these days, you know, learning how to walk.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I get that, Alison! I just can't believe she's the kind of person that wouldn't at least have some kind of reaction, or something.",
        "Lucy: It's a thank-you note/invitation to come see me at Fairwinds. So when do you think you'll see Aaron again, I mean, to give him the letter?",
        "Alison: Aaron, you're acting like the accident didn't change her.",
        "Aaron: Look, Lucy can't walk, and most of her memory is gone, but she is still the kind of person that answers a letter.",
        "Alison: Maybe she did. You poured your heart out and she didn't answer it. And maybe that's your answer. Maybe she's just not interested.",
        "Aaron: Maybe you're wrong.",
        "Alison: Aaron, when are you gonna just stop caring about this? It's time to start taking care of yourself. Come on, let's just get -- get some dinner.",
        "Aaron: Whatever.",
        "Alison: Soup, salad and a chai latte for me. \"I can't get you out of my mind, Lucy. So, I'll just keep trying to make you remember us.\" Aaron, when are you gonna stop being so stubborn? Just give it up already.",
        "Aaron: You give it up right now, Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What is this? Down-on-Molly day? You are a great friend.",
        "Molly: Huh-uh. Great friends don't sit and pass judgment on people they love. I mean, here I am telling you that I hate it when I have to defend the choices I've been making, somebody else feels the exact same way.",
        "Holden: I think maybe you owe someone an apology.",
        "Molly: You got that right. Thanks.",
        "Holden: All right. Not exactly sure what I did, but if you ever need me, I'm -- I'm available.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Couldn't we use a different word? \"Blackmail\" has such an ominous sound to it.",
        "Simon: Why'd you do it, Henry? Huh?",
        "Henry: It was Carly's idea.",
        "Katie: Oh, Carly just volunteered to be blackmailed?",
        "Henry: Well, she volunteered to give me a gift. A thank-you present.",
        "Simon: $50,000, that's a lot of thank yous.",
        "Henry: She was very grateful.",
        "Katie: For?",
        "Henry: For forgetting something that I had seen. Something incriminating that involved her.",
        "Simon: What was it, Henry?",
        "Henry: I forget.",
        "Katie: And how did Mike Kasnoff enter into this picture?",
        "Henry: I -- I don't know. He must have heard about my agreement from Carly. Can I have my coat back, please?",
        "Katie: Explain.",
        "Henry: Look, I -- I -- I don't know -- look -- okay, look -- she must have told Mike, okay?",
        "Katie: He's all yours.",
        "Simon: Henry, Henry, Henry -- what did Katie tell you about leaving Carly alone, huh?",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no. Katie told me not to pester Carly on behalf of Rosanna Cabot. And I complied. And my current business with Ms. Tenney has nothing to do with Rosanna, okay? It's just a little freelance operation.",
        "Katie: You're sure Rosanna's not a part of it?",
        "Henry: Yes, I am sure. Just little me, the entrepreneur that could. And I tried to tell you about it, but you didn't want to hear -- and boy oh boy, boys and girls, the plot has thickened.",
        "Simon: And what's that supposed to mean, Henry?",
        "Henry: Well, let's just say that there is a growing development that will make its presence known very soon.",
        "Katie: No, don't say another word. I don't want any more information about Carly, all right?",
        "Henry: Information? What information? $50,000 makes me forget.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, that amnesia must be contagious. 'Cause I forgot to make dinner, you can eat elsewhere.",
        "Henry: What --",
        "Simon: See, I think that's your cue to leave, Henry.",
        "Henry: What? Okay, all right, fine. Fine. I didn't want any dried-out pot roast anyway. And listen, kids, next time you want to invite me to the enchanted cottage from hell -- don't!",
        "Katie: $50,000.",
        "Simon: Yeah, that's a lot of cash. And we still don't know why Carly gave it to Henry and what that has to do with Mike wanting to pound Henry last night.",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, we do. Think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What is going on with you?",
        "Carly: Do you think there's anything to all that karma stuff? You know, you reap what you sow?",
        "Emily: Carly --",
        "Carly: 'Cause I have sown some pretty horrible things, and I really think that I'm being punished.",
        "Emily: Carly, these are hormones, okay, talking.",
        "Carly: I was so worried about having this baby, but now, today, thinking that I might lose it --",
        "Emily: You're not -- mom says everything's fine.",
        "Carly: Everything is not fine, Emily! I told Jack that this baby is his. I've done to him exactly what Julia did to him.",
        "Emily: No, you listen to me. What Julia did, she did to Jack because she wanted to hurt him. You're doing it to protect him. That's a huge difference.",
        "Carly: He's not gonna see it that way. All he is gonna see is that I lied to him, over and over again. And all he is gonna want is me out of his life.",
        "Emily: Not if he doesn't find out.",
        "Carly: Just wait till he sees the sonogram pictures.",
        "Emily: Carly, tell him that you conceived this baby right after the wedding.",
        "Carly: Oh, okay. And then Mike will start to wonder if maybe the baby is his, and then I'll have to tap dance even more, dodge another bullet. I'm steeped in lies, and I can't keep it up anymore.",
        "Emily: We have had this conversation many times. And I'm gonna tell you the same thing -- you don't have a choice.",
        "Carly: There's always a choice. Jack doesn't lie. He never lies, not even about little things. He doesn't live that way. That's why I should tell him the truth.",
        "Emily: You cannot, under any circumstances, for any reason, tell him the truth.",
        "Carly: If I don't, I lose him.",
        "Emily: No, you will lose him if you do. I mean, you listen to me. You have been through hell these last few months and everything's hitting you now. You're so overwhelmed you aren't looking at the big picture here -- the worst is over. It is, sweetie. Henry's been paid off. Mike's been thrown off the trail. Rosanna's been de-fanged.",
        "Carly: Oh, Rosanna! God, why did I listen to you? Why did I think that inviting her into this baby's life would help anything? If she figures out what's going on, she's gonna be the first person on my doorstep at 8:00 in the morning, just bursting to tell Jack. And he needs to hear it from me!",
        "Jack: Hear what from you?",
        "Carly: Could we have a couple minutes alone, please? There's something I need to tell my husband.",
        "Jack: What is it, honey? What do you want to tell me?",
        "Carly: Hold me, Jack. I love you so much.",
        "Jack: Carly, I love you, too. And don't be scared, Susan said she was almost 100% sure that everything was gonna be okay.",
        "Carly: Yeah. This isn't about that.",
        "Jack: What's it about?",
        "Carly: I -- I don't want to lose you.",
        "Jack: Honey, you're not gonna lose me.",
        "Carly: Not even if I screw up? Or even if I screw up really big --",
        "Jack: Even if you rob a bank and I have to arrest you, I'll still be by your side, provided Hal gives me the adjoining cell. Hey. You don't have to hold on so tight. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Carly: You sure? You promise? No matter what?",
        "Jack: Honey, I am gonna be right here, through thick and thin and through all the scary stuff. So what's got you so -- so scared?",
        "Carly: You know all the -- this -- the crazy stuff that's been happening at home lately.",
        "Jack: I know Julia's baby game got our marriage off to a rocky start --",
        "Carly: But before that even, the fights that we had -- the big one -- you know, the one, the fight we had the night before our wedding.",
        "Jack: So what? Our fights never change anything. We get mad, but we never give up. Honey, you're my life. So how'd you get here?",
        "Carly: Craig brought me.",
        "Jack: You called Craig?",
        "Carly: No, I didn't call him. He was at the house when I got these pains, and he brought me --",
        "Jack: Wait a minute -- Craig was at the house?",
        "Carly: It's no big deal --",
        "Jack: It's a huge deal. So he comes over and suddenly getting pains? I want to know why.",
        "Carly: Jack, wait.",
        "Emily: What happened?",
        "Carly: Jack just flipped out when he found out that Craig brought me here. I haven't had feelings for Craig in ages, but Jack is still jealous.",
        "Emily: So then, can you really see him being able to handle the fact that you slept with Mike the night before your wedding?",
        "Carly: Right. My secret stays a secret.",
        "Susan: Well, it wasn't easy, but I did it. We can take you upstairs now for your sonogram.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Susan: No? I just bullied one lab technician and three pregnant women to get you in immediately. What do you mean, \"no\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You've got a hell of a lot of nerve asking me how my wife is when you're the reason she's here, Montgomery.",
        "Craig: I'm the reason she made it to the emergency room --",
        "Jack: No, before that -- what about before that? Before she doubled over in pain. What did you do?",
        "Craig: Nothing?",
        "Jack: She was fine when I left, then all of a sudden, she's gotta be rushed to the hospital because she's getting cramps? What did you say to her, Craig? What the hell did you say to my wife?",
        "Craig: I was talking her back into Monte Carlo.",
        "Jack: Do you understand the word \"no\"? Carly's over stressed. She's pregnant. She didn't think working was gonna be such a good idea, so she stopped, and you come over to my house and you pressure her to come back?! What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Mike: Relax, Jack. Relax.",
        "Jack: If anything happens to my kid, I swear --",
        "Mike: Listen, just relax, man. All right? Carly doesn't need you to get into a fight right now.",
        "Jack: Stay away from my wife. Tell Carly I'll be back in a few minutes.",
        "Emily: All right. Just go.",
        "Craig: Hey, Mike. You've got some nerve, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What happened?",
        "Emily: Nothing new. Jack accused Craig of being the reason why you ended up in the hospital.",
        "Carly: If only it were that simple.",
        "Susan: If something has you so stressed out that it's compromising your pregnancy, you better tell me about it.",
        "Carly: It'll be fine.",
        "Susan: Really? One minute you're insisting on an immediate sonogram and the next minute you're refusing to go. Now if I were to make a guess, I'd say that you don't want Jack to know this baby's due date.",
        "Carly: And you'd be right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: No.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Simon: So Mike must have found out Henry was blackmailing Carly and went ballistic because --",
        "Katie: No, no. Don't say it out loud, please.",
        "Simon: Because he was the reason Henry could blackmail Carly. That \"compromising position\" you were talking about? That takes two people. So Mike was the other half of the equation?",
        "Katie: It sure sounds like it? But Carly loves Jack, I know she does.",
        "Simon: Come on. Don't you dare ever love me that way. Man, this is going to kill him.",
        "Katie: Which is exactly why he can never find out.",
        "Simon: We can't leave Jack in the dark about this. His wife is cheating on him.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but it was a mistake.",
        "Simon: Mistake.",
        "Katie: Carly slipped up once. And you know why? Because she thought Jack had left her. She thought he had broken up with her and she was just devastated. People do stupid things when their heart's breaking.",
        "Simon: So what Henry was saying before about a \"growing development\"? Does he think Carly's pregnant?",
        "Katie: Yeah. And if Carly is pregnant and it's not Jack's baby, I don't know what good it is for us to tell anyone the truth?",
        "Simon: Honey, why are you protecting her?",
        "Katie: Because I know what it's like to be desperate. Like when I was in love with you and you didn't love me back.",
        "Simon: You cannot compare this to our first year of marriage --",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, I can. Because I would have done anything to keep you by my side. Anything. I just didn't want to know what it would be like without you near me, and so -- that's the position Carly's in.",
        "Simon: Well, so we sit on the truth?",
        "Katie: Please.",
        "Simon: All right, fine. You win. But honey, we'd better think of something to tell Jack and we'd better think of something good.",

        "Aaron: This is private.",
        "Alison: Then you shouldn't leave it in a magazine. I was just flipping through it and the letter dropped out.",
        "Aaron: I'll say one thing for you. You really think fast.",
        "Alison: Well, you act like I'm your own personal pony express, and then you don't even trust me. If I really wanted to read your lame love letters, why wouldn't I just do it when I'm trotting them over to Lucy?",
        "Aaron: Maybe you do.",
        "Alison: And maybe you should stop taking it out on me because Lucy's ignoring you. It's not my fault if she doesn't love you anymore.",
        "Aaron: Hey, I think your dinner will be done soon. Enjoy.",
        "Alison: Aaron -- Aaron, I'm sorry. Aaron, I'm sorry. Okay? I was totally out of line. I acted like a complete jerk. But -- I mean, I'm taking a big chance here. Mr. Montgomery already hates me. And if he finds out I'm bringing Lucy your letters -- it's not like I really care, but -- I just wanted you to say thanks.",
        "Aaron: Well, didn't I? [Aaron sighs] look, Alison, I'm sorry. Okay? I really do appreciate everything you've done for me.",
        "Alison: Maybe Lucy didn't tell me how she feels about the letters because it's too personal. I mean, I bet you write a great love letter, the kind that a girl would want to keep private.",
        "Aaron: You think so?",
        "Alison: Sure.",
        "Aaron: I'm going to call her right now, just start talking, okay?",
        "Alison: No, no, don't -- why would you call her? That's the worst thing you could do.",
        "Aaron: Why?",
        "Alison: Because it'll ruin everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You have a problem with me?",
        "Craig: Yeah. Watching you buddy up with old Jack. Of course, I bet old Jack doesn't know what you did to his wife. You don't seem to know what I did for you, either.",
        "Mike: Is that why you took a bullet for me? So you could call your marker in?",
        "Craig: I took the bullet for Carly. And yes, you do owe me. And I do collect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack needs to believe this baby was conceived two months ago.",
        "Susan: As opposed to --",
        "Carly: Three months ago.",
        "Susan: Oh, I don't even want to know. But I do want that sonogram. I need to know that this baby is safe.",
        "Carly: So do I.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, Jack did go for a walk.",
        "Carly: Do you think we could do it before he gets back?",
        "Susan: We can try.",
        "Emily: I could be lookout.",
        "Susan: And I could be the doctor who should know better. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Wait -- why shouldn't I call Lucy?",
        "Alison: Because -- you might get hurt. I mean, if she answers the phone and she freaks out and hangs up on you --",
        "Aaron: I can deal with that.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but can she? You have to think about her, right now. I mean, she's very fragile right now, and if you keep pushing her --",
        "Aaron: All right, Alison, I get the point. I'll just stick to writing letters. And if I ever get discouraged -- I'll just remember the way she used to smile at me the last time I saw her.",
        "Alison: Cool. Well, when you're done with your letter, just give it to me, and I'll make sure Lucy gets it.",
        "Aaron: No, I'll personally deliver this one.",
        "Lucy: Well, how are you going to do that?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. Look, I'm gotta walk back to the garage.",
        "Alison: No, you don't have to walk. I have a car. I can drive you until you -- you get a new bike.",
        "Aaron: No, really, I'll be fine. Thanks. You got some grease on your chin.",
        "Alison: Here?",
        "Aaron: No. No, right here.",
        "Alison: I'm so embarrassed. This whole time I've had this big blob on my face.",
        "Aaron: Hey, don't stress it. Kinda cute on you. The whole mechanic thing -- the boots and the outfit -- you really make it look cool.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Maybe I'll start wearing timing belts, make a whole new trend.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Later.",
        "Alison: Aaron -- if you -- if you ever want to see a movie or something and you need a ride, you can just give me a call. I love -- just about anything.",
        "Aaron: Alison, hanging out at work is cool, but any free time is gonna be totally devoted to Lucy.",
        "Alison: I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Oh, article on carburetors.",
        "Alison: Thanks. Shoot, he took it. But I still have these. The question is, what to do with them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Technically, we should tell Jack the truth. I mean, that's what he asked us to find out. But it will only hurt him, and he's suffered so much already finding out the one baby wasn't his.",
        "Simon: All right. We gotta at least tell Jack about his so-called friend Mike.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. That will just make things worse. This is a complicated situation. Mike and Molly are together. Molly and Carly are cousins and best friends. And this is like a big ball of string. I 'm gonna call him. I'm gonna tell Jack -- what do we tell him?",
        "Katie: I don't know, but we have the whole ride over there.",
        "Simon: No way, no. I'm not gonna tell him anything face-to-face. No.",
        "Katie: It'll be more convincing. And considering what the Henry and Mike connection turned out to be, convincing is exactly what we need.",
        "Simon: If you weren't so damn cute --",

        "Jack: Hey, honey, I'm so sorry I missed the sonogram.",
        "Emily: I told Jack that an opening came up so you just took it.",
        "Jack: I let Craig have it, so I had to go take a walk and cool off. I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: Sweetie, you didn't really miss anything. According to the picture on the screen, we are having a lima bean.",
        "[Everyone laughing]",
        "Jack: Well, how's our lima bean doing?",
        "Susan: Very well.",
        "Carly: But it's -- it's big for its age.",
        "Jack: Big? You hear that, Mike? We're gonna have a linebacker.",
        "Mike: Is that right?",
        "Carly: Hey, thank you for finding my husband. I really needed him with me.",
        "Mike: I get that.",
        "Jack: I'm gonna get the paperwork started so we can get you home. Hey, we get a picture of our little one or what?",
        "Carly: The lab technician said that he's sending one right up.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Susan: I'd better be getting back to my other patients. Stay in touch.",
        "Emily: Can we -- I'm going to take her to lie down. You check her out.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Mike: Glad everything worked out. I'll see you soon, all right?",
        "Jack: Hey, Mike. Thanks. Thanks for everything today. You were amazing. Getting me here, keeping me from rolling Craig's bony head down the hall. I appreciate it. You've been a good friend.",
        "Mike: Believe me, Jack, I'm a long way away from being a hero.",
        "Emily: The technician is sending one up? How lame is that?",
        "Carly: What was I supposed to say?",
        "Emily: Carly, men are stupid. They don't know what they're looking at. Just tell him it's 8 weeks instead of 12.",
        "Carly: Another lie. I can't keep it up.",
        "Emily: Will you listen to me? You can. You can do this. You survived the satanic spa. You can survive anything. Just -- we're gonna keep Parker tonight, me and Hal. You and Jack just take it easy.",
        "Jack: Hey, ready to go home?",
        "Carly: I can't wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: No, lullaby. I got it. A chocolate croissant and a chai tea. I'll be home soon. Yeah. Yes? And what's with the over-all appearance here?",
        "Alison: You never saw me.",
        "Craig: Ah, if only that were true.",
        "Alison: I'm not saying anything.",
        "Craig: Like I said.",
        "Alison: But -- I think you might want to check these out.",
        "Craig: \"Aaron.\" \"Lucy.\" Somebody's gonna have to teach that guy a lesson.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You shouldn't have.",
        "Molly: Well, then it's a good thing I didn't. I love you. But this is for Carly. Because today I realized that for months now, when she's needed me the most, I haven't been there for her. I haven't been a good friend. I've passed judgment on her.",
        "Mike: That doesn't sound like you.",
        "Molly: Yeah, well, it's true, and I'm ashamed of myself. Mike, since we were kids, we used to hear people whisper about how screwed up our family was. So we always had this sort of unspoken thing between us that we wouldn't pass judgment on each other for as long as we ever lived. She would accept my choices, and I would accept hers. And that's the way it's always been, until recently.",
        "Mike: I must be missing something. You seem perfect to me.",
        "Molly: I'm being serious. Carly, she just started this brand-new life, full of hope and love. And I just -- what am I doing? I'm nagging her to tell Jack that she slept with Craig the night before her wedding. Since when am I the moral compass of Oakdale? And what good would it do to tell anyway, because Craig is out of the picture, and she and Jack are thrilled about this baby. What?",
        "Mike: Don't panic, but Carly had a little bit of a scare today.",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Mike: It's just cramps, okay? I left her and Jack at the hospital, but word is everything's okay.",
        "Molly: But -- I got to get over there.",
        "Mike: No, no, no. Baby, baby, they're fine. They did some tests, all right? Jack's taking her home. They're probably even there by now.",
        "Molly: Then let's go.",
        "Mike: Tomorrow, tomorrow. Okay, Hal and Emily are taking care of Parker. If we leave them alone, they'll have the whole night to themselves, okay?",
        "Molly: Are you sure that everything's okay with this baby?",
        "Mike: That's what Dr. Stewart said.",
        "Molly: I can't believe that Carly was scared to death, and I didn't know anything about it. She probably thinks I don't care.",
        "Mike: She knows you care.",
        "Molly: Well, if she doesn't, she's gonna know soon enough. Because first thing tomorrow, I'm going to go over there and let my cousin know that I'm gonna stick by her no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We are going to enjoy this empty nest. So come sit down, put your arm around me and find us an old movie.",
        "Jack: Nice toss. Sounds good. And this feels good.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: I'm so sorry I missed that sonogram. I just -- I popped when I heard that Craig was here, trying to get you to go back to work.",
        "Carly: Just get over it. I did.",
        "Jack: Hey, did you get that ultrasound picture?",
        "Carly: Um, yeah. Yeah, it's in my coat pocket.",
        "Jack: Okay, hold on.",
        "Carly: We're due in July.",
        "Jack: July. You know, you remember last July, July 4th, Emma's barn? We spent the entire day arguing about when we were gonna have a baby. Wouldn't it be hilarious if we had a baby on July 4th? Oh, here it is. How do you know which way is up? [Carly laughs nervously] what's so funny?",
        "Carly: Oh, Emily thought you'd say that. I guess she was right about everything. [Doorbell rings] oh, tell them to go away.",
        "Jack: Go away.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Nice try.",
        "Jack: Hey, guys.",
        "Simon: Hey, guys. How you doing?",

        "Jack: Ask Carly, she knows.",
        "Katie: I'll do that.",
        "Simon: Listen, Jack, we can't stay for long. But we spoke to Henry about what happened at Java Underground last night. There's nothing to it. I can give you the details later if you're interested, but no big deal.",
        "Jack: Okay, great. Yeah. July. I'm gonna be a father in July.",
        "Simon: Happy days. Well done. Katie, let's get out of here and leave the two newlyweds alone.",
        "Katie: Right. Um, cute baby. Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.",
        "Simon: Katie.",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Simon: Let's go.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
