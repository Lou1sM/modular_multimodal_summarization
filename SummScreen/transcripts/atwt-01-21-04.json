        "Katie: I thought we were going back to the Lakeview.",
        "Mike: After.",

        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Aaron: Hello?",
        "Alison: Hi, Aaron, it's me.",
        "Aaron: Alison, where are you?",
        "Alison: I need a favor from you. And I know that you're mad at me, but you have to say yes.",
        "Aaron: No, I don't.",
        "Alison: My mother left me a message. She said that Emily's in the hospital with a concussion. Can you please find out what happened to her?",
        "Aaron: Your mother is worried about you, Alison. Why don't you just call her yourself?",
        "Alison: Because then she'll guilt me about coming home, and I can't do that.",
        "Aaron: Well, I don't care. Ask somebody else, okay? I'm not doing you any favors.",
        "Alison: I guess you spoke to Chris.",
        "Aaron: You lied to me again. Okay? You never told Chris that he was the father of your baby.",
        "Alison: Did you?",
        "Aaron: No, not yet. You know what? Let me tell you something. I'm not spending the rest of my life keeping secrets for you.",
        "Alison: I meant to tell him, Aaron. Honest, I did. But at the last minute I thought, why bother? I mean, it doesn't even matter anymore.",
        "Aaron: What do you -- why not? What do you mean?",
        "Alison: I can't get into that right now, but can you just please find out what happened to Emily?",
        "Aaron: I'll -- I'll call the hospital as soon as I hang up.",
        "Alison: You'll have to go there in person. They won't tell you anything over the phone.",
        "Aaron: All right, okay, I'll go. Listen, where can I call you back?",
        "Alison: I'll call you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You okay?",
        "Jack: I suppose you've heard.",
        "Carly: Will Munson. I just can't believe it, Jack. I absolutely cannot picture that child poisoning Rose.",
        "Jack: I had to read him his rights, Carly. Hal was standing right there.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack, I'm sorry. At least you finally know the truth. You can close the books on this case, right?",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? We're gonna be untangling this thing for months. Barbara and Paul are still technically under arrest. And Molly, she's gonna be facing charges for planting that poison in Dusty's room. And then of course, we've got all these amateurs to sift through. You know, everyone trying to solve this case for us.",
        "Carly: Well, all right, Mitzi wasn't the killer, but she was involved and that hasn't gone away.",
        "Jack: Did you ever tell Rosanna that Craig paid Mitzi to make Paul look guilty?",
        "Carly: No. I couldn't. I want to protect her from what Craig did, you know? And then at the same time, I keep thinking, shouldn't she know? Doesn't she have a right to know what happened?",
        "Jack: All right, do you think it would be better if maybe you handed this to somebody else?",
        "Carly: It's possible. Do you have someone in mind?",
        "Jack: You're looking at him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You know, we've been so lucky, sweetheart.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rosanna: We should never forget to be grateful, you know?",
        "Craig: We won't.",
        "Rosanna: As much as I hate to leave, I really should go. I should go stop by the police station again. Paul has just been through hell today. Sorry, baby.",
        "Craig: Don't you think he might prefer to be alone sometimes?",
        "Rosanna: Well, if he does, then -- oh, here you go. Get his bottle. Got it? Here you go. If he does, then I'll be back that much sooner. Okay, you don't mind, do you?",
        "Craig: Yes, I do.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. His little brother killed -- let's not talk about this in front of the baby, okay? I'll be back soon.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Rosanna: You know, sometimes I am just speechless about how much this family means to me.",
        "Craig: So am I.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, then. I'll see you later. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I didn't kill Rose. My kid brother, Will, did that. The hard part now is for everybody to figure out a way to deal with it.",
        "Dusty: Wait a second, wait a second. Maybe you didn't hear me. I said it's your fault. Did you hear me? I said you're the one that killed Rose.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I heard you. I keep telling you over and over again, Dusty, that I will never forgive myself for what I did to Rose on our wedding day.",
        "Dusty: On the wedding day, huh? That's only part of it. What did you do to protect her from your twisted family, huh? What did you do?",
        "Paul: This isn't even about Rose. This is about you -- and you, and the guilt that you feel because you let Rose down when she was alive. That's why you hate me so much. That's why you wanted so badly for me to be the killer. Because hating me somehow gives you comfort. Only now, it turns out that the killer was this sweet teenage kid who didn't even know what he was doing. Hardly any comfort in hating him, is there? Let me give you a little helpful hint on how to get through all this, okay? You just surrender. You have to find a way to free yourself from this hate. Or it will eat you up inside until there's nothing left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Paul Ryan's a lying punk. And he's responsible for Rose's death.",
        "Holden: Dusty, could you just give it a rest.",
        "Dusty: He threatened her life.",
        "Holden: Stop, all right?",
        "Dusty: He planned a wedding day from hell and now he thinks he's gonna walk away? 'Cause he's not the one that actually gave her the poison. He's gonna leave that to his kid brother? How could such a thing happen? It all goes back to the mother, who we know is nuts! Paul knows it! So, he killed her. Lily and I were not wrong about that. We just didn't connect all the dots.",
        "Lily: We weren't right either, Dusty. We didn't do anything to help her.",
        "Dusty: Help who, Lil? What are you talking about?",
        "Holden: Dusty, go home.",
        "Dusty: Hold on a second.",
        "Holden: Lily and I need some time alone.",
        "Dusty: I just want to make sure she's okay. That's all.",
        "Holden: That's not your job.",
        "Dusty: We didn't do anything wrong, okay? I want you to remember that. Paul Ryan committed that murder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey, hey! How'd you get in here?",
        "Mitzi: Your housekeeper was a customer of mine at the roller palace. Great gal, that Phyllis.",
        "Craig: You and I have no further business. You can go away now.",
        "Mitzi: Know what? I need money, all right? Your pal, Carly, she stopped payment on that check.",
        "Craig: I am not your bank! Good-bye!",
        "Mitzi: Listen to me. I want money, or I'm going to the police and I'm telling them everything.",
        "Craig: All right, all right, go ahead. Now that Paul Ryan's evidently been cleared, you have the credibility of a $6 bill.",
        "Mitzi: Maybe, but I can still cause trouble. Your wife doesn't seem like the forgiving type.",
        "Craig: I'll give you one final payment.",
        "Mitzi: Make it a big healthy chunk. No singles this time.",
        "Craig: All right, turn around. All right. Whatever happened between us didn't. Erase everything from your memory, okay?",
        "Mitzi: Okay.",
        "Craig: All right, good. Now disappear. Shazaamm! [Cabot crying] Hey. Okay. Okay. Well, Mitzi's been handled. Your Aunt Carly's never gonna try to sell me out. A few days -- we'll have nothing to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: If Rosanna finds out that Craig paid Mitzi to lie about Paul, how could she ever trust him again, Jack? Her whole wonderful, perfect life would go down in flames. And what about Cabot, our godson? I don't want him to suffer.",
        "Jack: So you want to do nothing?",
        "Carly: I guess so. Let's just get on with our lives and forget any of this ever happened.",
        "Jack: Fine, Carly. Whatever you say.",
        "Carly: I can't do that, can I?",
        "Jack: You tell me.",
        "Carly: Keeping what I know from Rosanna would be the same as lying to her. And if she ever found out, she would hate me for it.",
        "Jack: All right, so don't get involved. Steer clear of the whole mess, and let me treat it as if it was a police matter.",
        "Carly: Will Craig go to jail?",
        "Jack: That depends on Mitzi. At least Rosanna will know the truth. And what she does with that, that's her business.",
        "Rosanna: Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt. Is Paul around? I brought him something to eat.",
        "Jack: He left a few minutes ago.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, did he say where he was going?",
        "Carly: Uh -- I think he might want some time to himself.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. I'll try him at home. Thanks.",
        "Jack: You're sure that Rosanna and Paul are just friends, right?",
        "Carly: Yes, positive.",
        "Jack: All right. Then the name of the game is hardball.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Mitzi Matters, she in?",
        "Clerk: One moment.",
        "Carly: Thank you, Jack.",
        "Jack: For what?",
        "Carly: For realizing that Mitzi is not the innocent, little waif she pretends to be.",
        "Jack: She took money to lie about a murder. It's not the same as killing someone, but it's up there.",
        "Clerk: I'm sorry. She's not in her room. Would you care to leave a message?",
        "Jack: No, that's okay. We'll wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Oh, hey, you know, I'd love to stay and chat, but there are people who need me. And I know that sounds impossible, but, trust me, it's true.",
        "[Simon thinking]",
        "Simon: No, no, no, this can't be happening. I mean, she can't have forgotten all about me. No, no, that's it. She must have an angle. She's trying to get information from this guy or something. 'Cause -- I mean, she's not gonna sleep with him. She's still my wife.",
        "Katie: Wait, stop.",
        "[Simon thinking]",
        "Simon: Yeah, well, it's about bloody time.",
        "Katie: I have an incredible idea.",
        "Mike: I got one or two myself. You wanna know what they are?",
        "Katie: Mike, please, just listen. Listen.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Katie: Remember Jack and Carly's wedding? How serene it was? How relaxed everyone was?",
        "Mike: First time I saw Craig without a tie.",
        "Katie: Well, that's what I want for our wedding, too.",
        "[Simon thinking]",
        "Simon: Oh, man, that's what happens when you don't sleep for a week. You start hearing things. 'Cause there is no way Katie just said that. No bloody way. She could not be getting married.",
        "Mike: Whatever you want's fine with me. I'm so happy you decided to be my wife. What?",
        "Katie: I just heard something in the other room.",
        "Mike: Stay here. I'll go take a look.",
        "Henry: Surprise!",
        "Katie: Henry, don't you ever hear of knocking?",
        "Henry: What? Oh, knocking is for strangers, Kate-ums. You and I are well beyond such pesky formalities.",
        "Mike: I like those formalities. Next time, knock, Henry.",
        "Katie: What are you doing here?",
        "Henry: Well, I order a nice bottle of champagne for you guys and then the waiter told me that you weren't there at the suite. And I got, you know, a little worried something had happened, so I thought I'd come down here and, you know, find you.",
        "Mike: Lucky us.",
        "Katie: Well, we're fine.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Katie: But that was very sweet of you to worry.",
        "Henry: Okay. Well, what can I say? It's a side of myself I rarely show. But enough about that. Why don't you two get back to the suite and put that \"do not disturb\" sign to good use.",
        "Katie: What do you think?",
        "Mike: Let's do it. All right, don't follow us.",
        "Henry: I won't. Sorry, sorry. And, you know, lock your doors, okay? Because you don't know who might be lurking in the hallway. All right?",
        "[Katie and Mike leave.]",
        "Simon: How could you let this happen, Henry? How could you let her get engaged on me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Monty, hey. How's my favorite lawyer? Glad to hear it. Listen, I'm calling because I want you to stop preparing my case for now. I have this really funny feeling that it's all going to be over before it ever gets to court. Don't worry. You'll be the second to know. Yeah, talk to you later. Hey. What are you drinking, Dr. Hughes? [Molly laughs] Oh, I get such a kick outta calling you that.",
        "Chris: Yeah. Look, Molly, have you seen Aaron around?",
        "Molly: He left a little while ago. Are you all right?",
        "Chris: People have been lying to me, Molly. And this time, they're not gonna get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Is there anything else you can tell me?",
        "Nurse: No, I'm sorry, that's all that I know.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Aaron: I gotta get this. Thank you very much. Hello?",
        "Alison: Aaron, it's me. What did you find out about Emily?",
        "Aaron: Look, I'm at the hospital right now. Um, she does have a concussion, but nobody's able to tell me exactly what happened.",
        "Alison: Well, is she okay? How serious is it?",
        "Aaron: Well, they're saying they're gonna release her in the morning, so I don't think it was too bad.",
        "[Alison sighs]",
        "Alison: Okay, thanks. That's good to know. Well -- bye.",
        "Aaron: Wait, Alison. Alison? Ali? You kidding me? Ali?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Judy: Hello?",
        "Aaron: Hi. Is there a woman there named Alison Stewart?",
        "Judy: I'm sorry, I don't know anyone by that name. Are you sure you have the right number? This is the Northside Family Planning Clinic.",
        "Aaron: Family -- family planning? Like -- like birth control family planning?",
        "Judy: Well, we provide counseling about a number of issues, including birth control, yes.",
        "Aaron: So you do abortions, too?",
        "Judy: The clinic addresses all aspects of reproductive health. Abortions may fall into that category and we do perform them here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mitzi: You two checkin' in? I hear they got a great two-night package.",
        "Carly: Actually, we're here to see you.",
        "Mitzi: No kiddin'. Why's that?",
        "Jack: I'll take it from here, Carly. Will Munson poisoned Rose. That case is solved. Just a few loose ends. And you're one of them.",
        "Mitzi: I've been called a lot of things in my life. Never a loose end. That's a new one.",
        "Jack: You know what? This isn't a game, Mitzi! We're not friends today, okay? I got a job to do, and I want a full confession in writing.",
        "Mitzi: Confession to what? You mean misunderstanding about me seeing Paul poison Rose's glass? 'Cause I feel really bad about that. But it was an honest mistake, Jack.",
        "Jack: No, you were paid to lie. Nothing honest about that.",
        "Mitzi: I can't confess to something I didn't do!",
        "Jack: Who paid you? Was it Craig Montgomery?",
        "Mitzi: Listen, Jack, I --",
        "Jack: I want the truth, Mitzi, now! Or you're going to jail. I'll take that as a yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paul remembering]",
        "Paul: Every day of this kid's life, he's dancing on the head of a pin. And I -- I swore to him that I wouldn't let anything bad happen to him. That I would never let anybody hurt him, and that includes you, Rose. So, if you don't mind, would you please watch what you say in front of my brother? Are you clear on that? I mean, it's no wonder why my kid brother doesn't want us to go to Paris. We've been treating this wedding like it's something to be ashamed of. We've got -- we've got no wedding announcements. We've don't have engagement rings. We're going all the way to Paris for the ceremony. I want us to celebrate! Rose -- I want us to celebrate with the whole world how much I love you.",
        "Rose: I love you, too. But Barbara and Jennifer? I'm gonna have to wear a gown with a bulletproof veil. It's gonna be crazy.",
        "Paul: I'm gonna find a way to make this up to you.",
        "Rose: I loved you.",
        "Paul: I know.",
        "Rose: Why -- why did you do this to me?",
        "Rosanna: Here you go, come on. Have a little tea, take a few bites of a sandwich.",
        "Paul: That's very nice. I'm not very hungry.",
        "Rosanna: I know this is probably easy for me to say, but Dusty's opinion -- you should really not let it mean anything to you.",
        "Paul: What if I agree with him?",
        "Rosanna: Well, then it's a good thing that I'm here, so I can tell you that you're wrong.",
        "Paul: Dusty said I didn't do enough to protect Rose from my family. And the truth is, I didn't. I let Barbara back into my life. I did everything I could to not see that will was emotionally unstable.",
        "Rosanna: What are you talking about? What Will did -- there's just no way you could've seen that coming.",
        "Paul: I should've taken charge. All I did was cross my fingers and pray that there wasn't a disaster.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you did as much as you could. You didn't let Barbara come to the wedding. I know you were a terrific brother to Will. And I'm sure that if things had worked out differently, you would've been a wonderful husband to Rose.",
        "Paul: I think you should leave.",
        "Rosanna: Come on, you really -- you shouldn't be alone.",
        "Paul: You have your own life to worry about, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: And you are a part of my life. Craig knows that I'm here. It's all right with him.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, you need to be careful.",
        "Rosanna: Of what?",
        "Paul: Well, sometimes people say one thing and they mean something else, and you don't figure it out until it's too late.",
        "Rosanna: Are you telling me to be suspicious of my husband?",
        "Paul: Yes, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jack: Craig Montgomery paid Mitzi to say she saw you poison Rose.",
        "Paul: Are you going to arrest her?",
        "Jack: That depends on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hey, Aaron -- Aaron. Have you seen Alison?",
        "Aaron: Why do you want to know?",
        "Chris: Because I just found out today that she might've switched her sonogram. Aaron, if that's true --",
        "Aaron: If it's true, what?",
        "Chris: If it's true, she may be carrying my child.",
        "Aaron: Well, maybe you should take that up with her, okay?",
        "Chris: Hey, wait. Did you know about this from the beginning? Or was Alison playing you for a sucker, too?",
        "Aaron: Look, what happens between Alison and me is our business. But just for the record, she's not the only one around here who's been acting like a jerk.",
        "Chris: Whoa, whoa, are you talking about me?",
        "Aaron: One minute you were in love with her, and the next, you're not. You never even fought for her, man. All you cared about was getting yourself hurt.",
        "Chris: You know what? You don't know anything.",
        "Aaron: I know that when you're in love with someone, you fight for them. And you go after them. They push you away, you go at them harder.",
        "Chris: Look, you know what? It's not that simple, okay? Alison made it very clear that she didn't want me around.",
        "Aaron: So what! Man, when you're in love, you don't even think that way. You hear words like that. Look, Alison's not easy. Trust me, I know this. But if you never loved her, you should have never said you did.",
        "Chris: I -- I did. Okay?",
        "Aaron: So why didn't you show it? The poor girl is pregnant and scared, and you never threw her one kind word. You were worried about yourself and you made her feel like dirt.",
        "Chris: Aaron, I really wanted to, okay? But once she married you --",
        "Aaron: Know what? Let me tell you something, bro. Something happens to that baby, and it's on your head.",
        "Chris: What are you talking about?",
        "Aaron: You know what? Nothing. It doesn't even matter. Have a good day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You know, the last time you warned me about Craig, I told you were wrong. I told you that he would never do anything to jeopardize our marriage. And I'm really surprised that you would mention it again.",
        "Paul: Oh, Rosanna. I guess I'm just being overprotective.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I guess you are. I know he's a difficult person. That's no secret. But he loves me and I love him. And anybody who is going to be involved in my life is gonna have to accept that.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. I won't mention it again.",
        "Rosanna: I really -- I really should -- I should go.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: All right. Promise me you're gonna eat something, okay? Okay? And call me -- I'll call you.",
        "Paul: No, you don't need to do that.",
        "Rosanna: I will.",

        "Molly: I heard about Will.",
        "Dusty: Yep. I figured you would.",
        "Molly: It's so horrible. He's just a kid.",
        "Dusty: A messed-up kid from a messed-up family. That's their own words.",
        "Molly: I guess we were all wrong about Paul.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah, you think so? I'd think again if I were you.",
        "Molly: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm not gonna put the murder of Rose D'Angelo on shoulders of one little, red-headed kid. It was a team effort, you know? Paul was definitely at the helm.",
        "Molly: Come on, Dusty. I know you hate the guy, but I don't think he'd set up his little brother to be a murderer.",
        "Dusty: Shouldn't you be at home resting up right now?",
        "Molly: For what?",
        "Dusty: Well, Rose's murder case is solved, so the D.A. Is now gonna be, you know, looking at his other cases.",
        "Molly: You shouldn't have put that poison in your hotel room, okay? That's not defendable.",
        "Dusty: You think I'm gonna drop the charges? I'm not dropping the charges.",
        "Molly: So I take it Craig hasn't talked to you about that?",
        "Dusty: About what?",
        "Molly: He promised me that he'd try to convince you to go easy on me.",
        "Dusty: No, no, Craig didn't talk to me about anything. And if he did, why would I listen to him?",
        "Molly: Come on, can you give me a chance? Just tell me what to do. Give me one thing to do to help you back off.",
        "Dusty: Okay, all right, don't worry. Let me find someone to buy your share of this place. That way, I don't have to see your face again.",

        "Holden: You want this?",
        "Lily: Hmm? No, thanks.",
        "Holden: You know, we should probably get home.",
        "Lily: Oh. I suppose.",
        "Holden: If you want, I can take the kids out so you can have some time for yourself.",
        "Lily: Thank you, but that's -- not gonna change anything. Rose will still be gone. And a 13-year-old boy will still be responsible for her murder.",
        "Holden: And you will still be alive -- with a life that you love, and people who love you very much.",
        "Lily: I know I'm blessed, I know that. I just feel like I can't rely on that right now. I feel like I'm worn out from all of it.",
        "Holden: When Dusty was here earlier, you looked across the room as if Rose were there. Could you actually see her?",
        "Lily: Seeing dead people? [Rose ghost shaking head no.] That's only in the movies, Holden.",
        "Holden: Right.",
        "Lily: I think we should go home.",

        "Mitzi: I only did this to help Lily, all right? That's why I lied about Paul -- to help Lily get some peace.",
        "Jack: Did it ever occur to you that Paul might be innocent?",
        "Mitzi: No. He was already under arrest. Everybody knows what he did to Rosie on her wedding day. I couldn't imagine it was anyone else.",
        "Jack: Heartbreaking story. Unfortunately, you didn't decide to help Lily until Craig paid you to do it.",
        "Mitzi: I was broke. Desperate. You know that. But I never would've done it if I didn't truly believe that Paul was the one that killed her.",
        "Jack: How much did you get, Mitzi?",
        "Mitzi: Money wasn't important. I was just trying to get justice for Rose. Look, I knew her longer and better than all of you. She was my best friend, and I miss her like crazy.",
        "Jack: Of course you miss her. I mean, who're you gonna embezzle from now?",
        "Mitzi: I know I made mistakes, Jack. I'm not a criminal. You know that.",
        "Jack: Don't leave town.",
        "Mitzi: Where're you going?",
        "Jack: To figure out what to do with you.",

        "Jack: Craig Montgomery paid Mitzi to say she saw you poison Rose.",
        "Paul: Are you going to arrest him?",
        "Jack: That depends on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Dusty, come on. The club is barely showing a profit. If I sell now, I'm gonna take a loss.",
        "Dusty: You should talk to your accountant about that.",
        "Molly: There's nothing else I can do to get you to cut me a break?",
        "Dusty: Why would I cut you a break? Give me a reason.",
        "Molly: I never would've let you go to jail. If it had gotten that serious, I would've told the police exactly what I did.",
        "Dusty: Aw, man, you know what I resent about you, Molly? Your sense of morality is even more messed up than mine.",
        "Molly: I wanted to get back at you for loving Rose, and I went too far.",
        "Dusty: Why? We were just bedmates? We were friends. Remember? Didn't you want to see me happy?",
        "Molly: Of course I did. But not with Rose. With me.",
        "Dusty: Well, you picked the wrong guy.",
        "Molly: Okay, fine. You can find somebody to buy me out.",
        "Dusty: No, that's okay. I changed my mind. Aaron, you're late again.",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry, it couldn't be helped.",
        "Dusty: Couldn't what? Look, we got a wine shipment in. All right? Go downstairs, store it, make sure it's where it's supposed to be.",
        "Aaron: Dusty, can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Dusty: Yes, what's going on?",
        "Aaron: I need a couple days off and an advance on my salary.",
        "Dusty: Do I ask why?",
        "Aaron: Something important has come up, and I gotta head to Chicago before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So, I'm scheduled to come in later today.",
        "Judy: Is that going to be okay?",
        "Alison: Fine. The sooner the better, I guess.",
        "Judy: You're sure you'll be ready?",
        "Alison: Uh, well --",
        "Judy: Listen, I know this is hard for you. Didn't you just move here?",
        "Alison: I still need to find a place. Do you have any ideas? I'm looking for something really cheap.",
        "Judy: Well, you may have moved to the wrong city for that, but I'll keep my eyes open.",
        "Alison: Thanks. I'll see you later.",
        "Judy: We'll be waiting for you, Mrs. Samuels.",

        "Paul: You're leaving it up to me whether or not the Oakdale P.D. Presses charges against Craig?",
        "Jack: Your family has been through a lot. Once Will's charged, it's only gonna get worse. I'm willing to spare you another court case, if that's what you want to do.",
        "Paul: What if that's not what I wanna do?",
        "Jack: Mitzi's testimony is enough to put Craig away, I think.",
        "Paul: Jack, nothing would give me more pleasure than seeing Craig assigned to a cellblock. But that's just -- that's a luxury that I just can't afford right now. Everything that I say and do for months -- no, maybe even for years -- has to revolve around Will. I don't have the time or the energy for a vendetta. I just gotta let this go.",
        "Jack: So, you're telling me to let him walk?",
        "Paul: No, I'm telling you to take care of it yourself. Will needs me. And let's just face it, Craig Montgomery is just not that important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: It's not like you were away on a fishing trip, Simon. You were officially dead. As in dead.",
        "Simon: There was no other way, Henry. If Katie knew I was alive, she'd have stayed in Australia and got herself killed.",
        "Henry: Yeah, isn't that always how it is with guys like us? We sacrifice ourselves so that others may live and prosper.",
        "Simon: I wanted Katie to live so I could be her husband again. I didn't expect her to go off and get married again so quickly.",
        "Henry: Wait, Simon, she has been mourning you ever since you left her! And Mike has been -- Mike has been very patient. Very patient.",
        "Simon: No, do not try to sell me on Katie's new lover. Okay? Man, I feel sick enough as it is.",
        "Henry: I wouldn't dream of it. Do you have any idea of what you're gonna do about this?",
        "Simon: Maybe it's better off if I just stay dead, huh?",
        "Henry: The taxes are lower. You'd never have to write another birthday card. Hmm.",
        "Simon: No way, no way. No, no, I cannot go without saying a word. I need her to understand. I need to explain everything. I heard them say they were staying at the Lakeview.",
        "Henry: No, Simon -- don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: We're thinking about extending our stay. Is the suite available tomorrow, too?",
        "Katie: Oh, please? I hope so. We're celebrating something. Something very wonderful. Oh, there's Nancy Hughes. I wanna go say hi.",
        "Mike: Kiss me.",
        "Katie: Mrs. Hughes, hi. How are you feeling?",
        "Nancy: Katie, how nice to see you. Fine, but obviously not as fine as you.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Nancy: You are glowing like a full-blown harvest moon. Is something going on that I should know about?",
        "Katie: Well, we're not supposed to say anything just yet. But Mike Kasnoff and I are getting married.",
        "Nancy: Oh, that's the most wonderful news. I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.",
        "Mike: You told her about the engagement, didn't you?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I did.",
        "Nancy: Oh, I'll tell you -- congratulations, Mike. Your bride-to-be is a gem.",
        "Katie: Oh, thank you.",
        "Mike: I know. And I will devote my life to make her happy.",
        "Nancy: Well, you couldn't ask for anything more than that. You two have made my day.",
        "Katie: Oh, good. Guess what, y'all. I'm a big loser.",

        "Judy: Oh, hi, Alana. I didn't expect to see you until later.",
        "Alison: I know that's when I'm supposed to start work. But I was just wondering if you could give me some sort of proof of employment. The landlords I've been seeing keep asking if I have a job.",
        "Judy: I've got the form right here. You know, it's lucky you showed up when you did. My other aide quit this morning. I never even put an ad in the paper.",
        "Alison: One of those things meant to be.",
        "Judy: I guess so. Well, here it is, all filled out. I hope you find something.",
        "Alison: I have to. 'Cause I can't go back home. I can't go back there ever again.",
