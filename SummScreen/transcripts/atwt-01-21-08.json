Holden takes Lily to the Farm and promises to take care of her from now on, as they hug. Chris promises to keep quiet about her as long as she keeps quiet about Dusty's accusations about him. They both had ample reasons to want Dusty dead, as they glare at one another. Paul and Barbara talk about Dusty, as she tells him that she is going to plan his funeral. Brad thinks his leg is broken. Bonnie stops by to see Holden, but she is embarrassed when she learns that Holden brought Lily home to take care of her, and so she rushes off quickly.

        "Katie: It was a dream. Please, let it have only been a dream.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I cannot believe I have to do this.",
        "Jack: Forensics inventory. Witness list. Autopsy set for 10:00.",
        "Margo: Anything on the surveillance tapes?",
        "Jack: They're at the lab. They should be processed by this afternoon. Unfortunately, the camera in that particular office was inactive.",
        "Margo: Oh my -- look at this witness list. This is the same guest list I had for New Year's brunch.",
        "Jack: May I ask as neutrally as possible -- is this too close?",
        "Margo: Why, because it's your cousin and my brother-in-law who are most obvious -- you know, I'm not gonna say the word suspect just yet.",
        "Jack: Yeah, let's not. Please.",
        "Margo: No, I'm just going to say people that we should really most talk to because they were the ones who had very vicious arguments with the victim right before he was murdered.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, we do stand a clear chance of turning a lot of our friends and family into enemies here, Margo.",
        "Margo: None of that changes the fact that it was Dusty Donovan.",
        "Jack: No, it doesn't.",
        "Margo: He was a pain in the butt. I really liked him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You don't love me. You're Jack's brother, my friend. You can't love me, Brad, you can't. Oh, God. Just stop, okay? Just stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden remembering]",
        "Lily: Holden? Holden?! Dusty's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, shh. She's still sleeping.",
        "Jack: What about you? Did you get any sleep at all?",
        "Holden: I wanted to be here when she woke up.",
        "Jack: I just talked to her doctor. A drug and alcohol overdose, Holden?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know. I thought she had kicked it, and I pushed and --",
        "Jack: So, what triggered the overdose? Did something happen?",
        "Holden: What happened was Dusty Donovan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Chris, you haven't heard from her at all?",
        "Chris: I told you, no.",
        "Susan: I've left messages for her everywhere. Her cell is off.",
        "Chris: Well, maybe Emily doesn't want to talk.",
        "Susan: Excuse me. Am I bothering you? Your significant whatever-she-is found a dead body last night and didn't come home, and it's so great to see how concerned you are.",
        "Chris: My concern, my job is to protect this hospital. As far as I can see, Emily can take care of herself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Em? What are you doing here?",
        "Emily: He's gone.",
        "Paul: What? Em?",
        "Emily: Dusty's dead.",
        "Paul: What happened?",
        "Emily: He was murdered.",
        "Paul: Are you sure?",
        "Emily: I'm sure. I was there when it happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Heard you and Dusty got into it last night. And from everything I heard, it was pretty intense.",
        "Holden: It was, but you knew all about that. You knew what I was dealing with when Dusty started dating Lily. And then it all just came to a head.",
        "Jack: How so?",
        "Holden: When I found out what had happened to her, that I almost lost her, it was all because of him, and then he started acting all concerned about her.",
        "Jack: And that made you mad?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I didn't want him anywhere near her. And I --",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Holden: Oh, you're here with your badge on, right?",
        "Jack: Yes. Holden, this is official.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Chris, we need to talk.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I'm kind of busy.",
        "Margo: It's not a request. You and I will talk.",
        "Chris: I see.",
        "Margo: I wanna know what you were doing last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You were there.",
        "Emily: He was lying on the floor. I begged him to open his eyes. I was so mad at him, he ruined everything, and then he acted so righteous about it.",
        "Paul: What did he ruin?",
        "Emily: Everything.",
        "Paul: Is that why you were so mad at him?",
        "Emily: That's not what you want to know. You want to know if I'm the one who killed him.",
        "Paul: Okay, fine. Did you, Em? Did you kill Dusty?",
        "Emily: You think I did, don't you?",
        "Paul: I think you could have.",
        "Emily: Makes sense. I mean, after what I did to you, everybody knows I'm not stable.",
        "Paul: I didn't say that.",
        "Emily: You didn't have to. Of any of the number of things I did to you, I shot you, Paul. I think you get to hold a grudge. You get to think that I was there. That Dusty was the one --",
        "Paul: Stop.",
        "Emily: Because you don't want to upset me. Don't want to upset me cause who knows what I'll do.",
        "Paul: How long have you been here?",
        "Emily: I don't know, all night.",
        "Paul: And you've talked to the police, right? It's okay, you've talked to the cops, they know that you just found him?",
        "Emily: Yes. I had a nice talk with Margo.",
        "Paul: And you have a good lawyer?",
        "Emily: I don't need a lawyer. I don't need a lawyer. Margo believes everything I say.",
        "Paul: Come on. Let's get you home.",
        "Emily: Okay. Why are you being so nice to me?",
        "Paul: I'm not. Em, I'm being nice to you now because you need for me to be nice to you right now.",
        "Emily: You want to help me?",
        "Paul: We both know how I treated you. You say Dusty ruined everything? I never thought that he would treat you as badly as I treated you.",
        "Emily: Neither did I.",
        "[Emily remembering]",
        "Emily: I swear to God, Dusty Donovan, I will get payback for this if it's the last thing I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Neither did I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Sorry, Margo. I'm not going to talk to you without my lawyer present.",
        "Margo: You need a lawyer present to tell me where you were last night?",
        "Chris: Yeah, I'm going to play this like my dad, by the book.",
        "Margo: All right then. By the book, I am to inform you that we will talk in the next two hours, so you should contact your lawyer, and we'll set up a time and a place.",
        "Chris: How about here and now? My lawyer, he just -- he just showed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: The fight I had with Dusty, Margo was there. She saw it, along with 30 other people.",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay but this isn't just about the fight. Listen, you need to know that there is going to be an investigation. We're going to need to know where you and Lily were at the time of Dusty's death.",
        "Holden: That's easy. I was here with Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Brad wakes up and Katie's not in the car]",
        "Brad: Katie!? Katie!?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Vienna: What in the world are you doing calling me? I thought you were on assignment with Brad.",
        "Katie: Vienna, if I tell you this, you cannot tell anyone ever. Swear.",
        "Vienna: What happened?",
        "Katie: He said he loved me. He didn't tell me, he said it in his sleep.",
        "Vienna: Then it must be true. How wonderful for you.",
        "Katie: This is horrible! This makes everything so complicated. I mean the best thing about Brad is that he's not complicated, but now he is, so everything he says and does is just basically a lie. I mean, men like Brad tell women that they love them so they can sleep with them, but already slept with me and now he tells me that! No. No, he doesn't love me. He can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Brad gets out of the car]",
        "Brad: Katie! Katie! Damn it. You know how I feel about walking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Did you follow me here?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Emily: What, Paul Ryan decides to go to church now and say prayers in the morning?",
        "Paul: Something like that. You're not the only one that lost someone, Em. I lost someone, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Hearn: Well, Barbara, I think our first step will be to schedule your first round of radiation for early next week.",
        "Barbara: So soon?",
        "Dr. Hearn: The longer we wait, the greater the risk is of the cancer spreading.",
        "Barbara: I don't understand. I thought you were going to operate, remove the tumor.",
        "Dr. Hearn: We've run into something of a problem, Barbara. The tumor is quite large. You can feel it, can't you?",
        "Barbara: Yes, one side is very swollen.",
        "Dr. Hearn: Yes. That's what has been affecting your speech.",
        "Barbara: I see. And so after the radiation, my speech will be better?",
        "Dr. Hearn: Sorry to say, not immediately. In fact, it could get worse.",
        "Barbara: Okay, I don't understand. If the radiation is going to make it worse, why don't we just get this tumor out of me?",
        "Dr. Hearn: Okay, due to its size, and also its location, surgery is not an option at the moment. The hope is, the radiation treatment will shrink the tumor, and then we'll be able to operate.",
        "Barbara: The hope?",
        "Dr. Hearn: Barbara, there is hope. I know this seems like a setback --",
        "Barbara: No, this is a nightmare, Doctor.",
        "Dr. Hearn: You will get through it. I know you can.",
        "Barbara: That plucky patience thing you want me to have? I don't have it.",
        "Dr. Hearn: The truth? A sense of humor can be just as important. And family.",
        "Barbara: Thank you very much.",
        "Dr. Hearn: Barbara, Barbara, have you told your family? Because I do notice that you still come to every appointment alone.",
        "Barbara: It's just an appointment, Doctor.",
        "Dr. Hearn: Have you told them?",
        "Barbara: No, not all the details.",
        "Dr. Hearn: You're going to need backup to get through this. You're going to need your family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Well, now that your lawyer is present, why don't you tell me what you were doing last night?",
        "Chris: You were here for most of it.",
        "Margo: I was here for the big blow up between you and Emily and Dusty Donovan.",
        "Chris: Then we don't need to talk about that, right?",
        "Margo: No, yes we do. We do. We do, because in a room full of people, Donovan announced that your father was adamantly opposed to memo 21, and that he could prove it. Of course, he can't do that now.",
        "Tom: Margo.",
        "Margo: Sorry. Do you know what proof Dusty might have had?",
        "Chris: I have no idea.",
        "Margo: Well, wouldn't you want to know? I would want to know. Wouldn't you be curious? I mean, when he went out to get that proof, didn't you follow him out and try and get into some sort of secluded place to talk to him? Someplace like, maybe the lab?",
        "Tom: Don't answer that. Margo, I need to know now, is my client a suspect?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So after the party, you came here.",
        "Holden: Right.",
        "Jack: And Lily was here.",
        "Holden: Of course she was.",
        "Jack: And you spent the whole night.",
        "Holden: Yeah, right where you found me.",
        "Jack: Okay, then somebody's got to verify that? Is there a doctor or a nurse who came in?",
        "Holden: No. She had her stomach pumped, and she was sedated. We were alone until --",
        "Jack: Until?",
        "Holden: Until Lucinda came in and told me that Dusty was dead.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Holden: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Jack: Well, I just think that after everything that Lily has gone through, you'd want to protect her. You'd want to keep it from her. Why -- why would Lucinda think it was so important for you to know about Dusty first thing?",
        "Holden: What are you implying, Jack?",
        "Jack: Holden, I want to help you. If there's something you need to say, tell me. I'll always have your back.",
        "Holden: You think I'm hiding something? My wife nearly killed herself last night. She was sedated, I was at her bedside, all night. End of story.",
        "[Holden goes back into Lily's room]",
        "Lily: Dusty. Dusty, where are you?",
        "Holden: Lil, shh, shh, shh.",
        "Holden: Lily --",
        "Lily: It's Dusty -- he's -- I think he's -- he's --",
        "Holden: You know what, Jack, you said you wanted to help? Why don't you go get that doctor? Tell her that she's awake. Everything's gonna be okay.",
        "Jack: Lily --",
        "Holden: Jack, please! You just need to try to stay calm. Okay?",
        "Lily: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: Shh.",
        "Lily: It's Dusty. Dusty's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Is Chris a suspect? Chris is a person of interest, and it is my job is to ask a lot of questions so as to narrow the field to find out who the murderer is. I'm so sorry if I hurt your feelings.",
        "Chris: I didn't say anything. He did.",
        "Margo: So the question remains -- between the time that Donovan made this accusation, and you left the party, where did you go?",
        "Chris: I went to the Lakeview for a drink.",
        "Margo: Well, that certainly is going by the book? I'm sure that's how your father would have handled it.",
        "Chris: Look Margo, why are you coming at me like this --?",
        "Tom: Chris! Can anyone confirm that you were at the Lakeview?",
        "Chris: The bartender. I talked to the bartender.",
        "Margo: Good, good. What time did you get there?",
        "Chris: I don't know.",
        "Margo: All right. After you left the party, you went to the Lakeview, perhaps you stopped by to say hello to your father --",
        "Tom: Ah, no he didn't, because I told you that last night.",
        "Margo: I'm so sorry, that slipped my mind.",
        "Tom: Did it?",
        "Margo: Yes. When you left the party, you went directly to the Lakeview?",
        "Chris: I didn't say that.",
        "Margo: Chris, I need you to be very clear with me. I need to know what you did between the time you left the party, and you got to your car. I need details so that I can clear you. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Hearn: I'd be more than happy to meet with members of your family. Explain to them what's coming.",
        "Barbara: You can just tell me, I'll pass it all on.",
        "Dr. Hearn: Your course of treatment will be over five consecutive weeks, with two days off in between. The actual treatment will only last 10 to 15 minutes each time. Do you remember the mesh mask we made for you at your last appointment?",
        "Barbara: That would be hard to forget.",
        "Dr. Hearn: Well, you'll be wearing it during the treatment. It will immobilize your head and neck so the radiation will only reach the designated area.",
        "Barbara: Right.",
        "Dr. Hearn: Back to family. You will need someone to drive you home after these sessions.",
        "Barbara: Right. The side effects?",
        "Dr. Hearn: Possible infection, fatigue. Your mouth will be very sore, and it will be very difficult to eat. The radiation affects your taste buds and salivary glands, and I will want you to meet with a nutritionist.",
        "Barbara: Good to know. And my speech will be better?",
        "Dr. Hearn: There's no guarantee it will be the same as before the treatment and surgery.",
        "Barbara: Funny the things you just take for granted.",
        "Dr. Hearn: I am sorry, Barbara, I do have to go.",
        "Barbara: Right.",
        "Dr. Hearn: If you have any questions, call me. The people who love you, they won't care how you sound.",

        "Katie: Brad, everything is your fault. We wouldn't have gotten lost. If we hadn't gotten lost -- oh, that would have just been the cherry on the top of the sundae that is today. Stupid guy. Go fall in love with someone else. Oh, thank God. It is freezing, let's get out of here. Brad? Where the hell are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Katie, where the hell are you? It's freezing out here. Katie! Katie! Stupid girl. She doesn't know how to handle herself out here, she doesn't know dangerous it is.",

        "Paul: Meg doesn't anything to do with me. We were supposed to have a baby together, and I managed to do what I somehow always manage to do.",
        "Emily: You came here to say good-bye, didn't you?",
        "Paul: No funeral or anything. It's like he never even existed, but he existed to me.",
        "Emily: Kinda like Jennifer.",
        "Paul: Our daughter Jennifer, yeah. I think about her.",
        "Emily: Me, too. Every day.",
        "Paul: Growing up with James Stenbeck, you know, I promised myself that I wouldn't turn out the way he turned out. But losing Jennifer, losing my son, makes me think maybe I'm just not fit to be a father.",
        "Emily: Don't say that, Paul.",
        "Paul: Meg said there's something broken about me. She said that no matter what I do, I'll never be able to care about anyone. Anyone at all.",

        "Lily: Can I go home?",
        "Doctor: If you have someone who can look after you.",
        "Holden: I will.",
        "Doctor: And you'll see she gets to her counseling sessions?",
        "Holden: I will.",
        "Doctor: Okay, I'll start the paperwork.",
        "Holden: Jack?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Holden: Do you think that you could leave us alone so that Lily can get dressed?",
        "Jack: Sure. Lily, I am going to have to talk to you before you leave. Okay, you understand that, don't you? I hope you feel better.",
        "Holden: Lily, I need to ask you something. When was the last time you saw Dusty?",
        "Lily: I don't remember.",
        "Holden: Do you remember anything about last night?",
        "Lily: I woke up, and you were there.",
        "Holden: That's right, I stayed with you. Remember that, I was with you all night.",
        "Lily: Did I do something bad?",
        "Holden: No, no, you didn't do anything wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I left them alone together. I want them to feel like they can talk to me down the road.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I get that. Besides, they had plenty of time to square their stories last night.",
        "Jack: No, I don't think they did. I don't think Lily could even if she'd wanted to. How'd things go with Chris?",
        "Margo: He lawyered up on me. Listen, I'm gonna go talk to the M.E. again. I'll see you back at the station.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Margo: Chris! I ran down that bartender. You were at the Lakeview all right.",
        "Chris: I told you.",
        "Margo: And he told me what time you got there.",
        "Chris: Tom, why is she doing this to me?",
        "Tom: I don't know. Maybe because it's working. You need to calm down, 'cause this is just the beginning.",
        "Chris: Are you enjoying this?",
        "Tom: No, I'm not. I just know what comes next. I also know that's not the first time Dusty made those accusations. I know that you found out that he was sleeping with Emily. And I know how desperately you wanted that project to go through.",
        "Chris: You think Dusty was right about me? Tom you think I would kill somebody to get what I want?",
        "Tom: You know what, it doesn't matter what I think. Get it through your head. It matters what Margo can prove.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: After I lost -- after we lost Jennifer, I saw what that did to you. I see what it's doing to you now. And I'm telling you, you are nothing like your father.",
        "Paul: What's it like to have children?",
        "Emily: Oh, wow. Amazing. Terrifying. Daniel thinks I hung the moon. Man, is he in for a rude awakening, huh.",
        "Paul: You're a great mother.",
