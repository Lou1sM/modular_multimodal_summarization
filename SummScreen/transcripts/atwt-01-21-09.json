        "Jack: Well, I'm not sure that was worth both of us taking off early.",
        "Janet: Ah, it wasn't that bad.",
        "Jack: It was a matchbox, Janet. There wasn't enough room for us, let alone the kids.",
        "Janet: Well, you know, we'll find something. And besides, we have the whole rest of the evening off.",
        "Jack: What do you have in mind?",
        "Janet: Emma's truck isn't out front. That means that we are all alone.",
        "Janet: Oh, wait a minute.",
        "Jack: What is that?",
        "Janet: Oh, great.",
        "Jack: What do you got there?",
        "Janet: Bills. Well, I'll bet Emma will be happy when she doesn't have to sift through our bills to get to hers.",
        "Jack: You know what, we shouldn't have to deal with this right now.",
        "Janet: Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa. This one looks like it was hand delivered. Let me check it out. It's from Carly.",
        "Jack: What for?",
        "Janet: She wants us to join her for drinks tonight at Metro. Let's go!",
        "Jack: No way!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: The woman is out of her mind. Even I can't throw a fabulous cocktail party in 20 minutes!",
        "Katie: Henry, are you here? Vienna, hey. Is Henry in the back?",
        "Vienna: No, I wish. But he abandoned me for a business trip.",
        "Katie: Where?",
        "Vienna: At a wine festival in Florida. Can you believe it? He's down there drinking free samples of wine, while I'm stuck here, slaving over a hot bar.",
        "Katie: I think it's slaving over a hot stove.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, well, whatever. Carly seems to think that I'm her slave. Can you believe it? She -- she dared to leave me a note telling me to put together a cocktail party? Tonight! Lucky for her, we have plenty of champagne. But if she expects me to be passing around trays like her personal waitress -- oh, Katie, don't cry for me. I've had bigger challenges. I'll survive this.",
        "Katie: I'm not crying for you.",
        "Vienna: Well, why are you so upset?",
        "Katie: I think my marriage is over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Drinks are on me. I'll have the usual.",
        "Brad: You don't have to do that.",
        "Dusty: I never thanked you for trying to help me put Montgomery behind bars.",
        "Brad: A lot good it did. You know, I mean, I still can't believe Katie refused to tell the cops what he did.",
        "Dusty: He's her brother.",
        "Brad: Yeah, well I mean -- right when I thought Katie was finally going to do the right thing. And -- last minute.",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm not going to hold that against her. She's another one of his victims.",
        "Brad: Which is why I still want to nail this bastard. So if you think of any other way, you just let me know, okay?",
        "Dusty: You have already gone above and beyond, where Craig is concerned. The best thing you can do for you and your marriage is stay out of it.",
        "Brad: Well, I'm not sure I have a marriage anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hi, Sis. You busy?",
        "Margo: What? No doughnuts this time?",
        "Craig: I was thinking something more along the lines of cocktails.",
        "Margo: What have you done that you need to ply me with alcohol?",
        "Craig: Not a thing.",
        "Margo: Right.",
        "Craig: No, I just wanted to join my sister in celebrating my wonderful news.",
        "Margo: What could top Johnny coming back?",
        "Craig: I'm getting married.",
        "Margo: Ha! Who would marry you? I mean, I'm sorry. But I know you.",
        "Craig: So does my intended. And she still said \"Yes.\"",
        "Margo: Well, does this masochist have a name?",
        "Craig: Carly Tenney.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I won't have to worry about these pretty soon. Life will be different. That's for sure.",
        "[Carly dreaming]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Craig: I'm tellin' you doll, I'm hitting all 8s. You mark my words, this time next year, I'm going to be the high pillow in this town -- with my doll at my side doing everything I say. Pipe that?",
        "Carly: Now you get this straight, buster. I'm nobody's patsy. That's why you married me remember? I call my own shots and if you don't like it, too bad.",
        "Craig: You shut your yap, doll, or I'll shut it for you.",
        "Carly: You wouldn't dare.",
        "[Carly wakes up]",
        "Carly: Oh, my God. What have I gotten myself into?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Are you insane? You can't marry Craig Montgomery!",
        "Carly: I know!",
        "Lily: You were just saying yesterday how you weren't even seriously considering his proposal.",
        "Carly: I know!",
        "Lily: Then why did you say \"Yes\"?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I guess he sort of caught me at a weak moment.",
        "Lily: Well that's obvious.",
        "Carly: He kept talking about how hard it must be to go it alone.",
        "Lily: You don't think it would be hard to be married to a man like Craig?",
        "Carly: I won't go through with it. I can't!",
        "Lily: Well, you'd better alert him to your change of heart.",
        "Carly: I will. As soon as I figure out what to say.",
        "Lily: Well think fast. Otherwise, you'll be saying, \"I do\" and then, there really will be no way out.",
        "Carly: Craig will never forgive me if I back out now.",
        "Lily: What do you care? It's not like you pledged your eternal devotion. I mean, you're not in love with the man -- are you?",
        "Carly: Are you insane?",
        "Lily: Well then, there's no problem. I mean, just tell him that you thought about it. And you realized it was a bad idea. And then, just end it. I mean, you do want that to be the end of it, don't you?",
        "Carly: Of course I do. It's just --",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Carly: Well, Craig was right about one thing. It isn't easy being alone. And it was sort of nice to have somebody on my side.",
        "Lily: If you're talking about that money he gave you for Metro, just remember that Craig never gives anything without expecting something in return.",
        "Carly: It's not just the money. He also -- he stood up for me with Jack. I don't know how he managed it. But somehow, he got Jack to back off and stop criticizing every thing I do.",
        "Lily: Jack's been on your case a lot?",
        "Carly: Daily. And I don't know how he finds the time, with what with the happy new wife and all that house-hunting and all.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's what this is all about.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Lily: You -- you are still angry that Jack left you and married Janet.",
        "Carly: I am not!",
        "Lily: Oh, and what better way to get back at him than by marrying the man he hates the most?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I don't trust her.",
        "Janet: That's already been established.",
        "Jack: Why would she want to have drinks with us -- unless she wants something?",
        "Janet: Like what?",
        "Jack: Half of the second mortgage on the house.",
        "Janet: She wouldn't.",
        "Jack: She already did. And I told her it wouldn't do either of us any good if we split it, and she backed off. But I don't know, maybe she decided not to take Craig's money after all and she's re-thinking giving up her share.",
        "Janet: How did you ever live with that woman? Constantly figuring out what she's up to next. It must've been exhausting.",
        "Jack: It still is in some ways.",
        "Janet: All right, let's try and think of a positive reason why Carly would want to socialize with us.",
        "Jack: There is no positive to Carly's motives.",
        "Janet: Come on. Maybe she wants to thank you for backing off with Craig. And then if we don't show up, it'll be like a slap in her face. And then, she will just hang out with Craig just to spite you.",
        "Jack: Oh, great. Now you're second-guessing her worse than I ever have.",
        "Janet: I don't know, I'm just trying to put myself in her shoes.",
        "Jack: You would never be in her shoes, Darling.",
        "Janet: Bottom line -- its cocktails. It's not a life sentence. And don't you think it would behoove you to be nice to her for the sake of the kids?",
        "Jack: Well, you do have a point there.",
        "Janet: So are we going?",
        "Jack: You really think Carly would retaliate by turning back to Craig if we didn't show?",
        "Janet: You were married to the woman. What do you think?",
        "Jack: I'll be ready in 15 minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Brad accused me of choosing my brother over him.",
        "Vienna: Well, did you?",
        "Katie: No. What I did had nothing to do with Brad. Really, it had to do with Craig. When I saw him with Johnny, for the first time in so long, it just made me hope that he could be a better person.",
        "Vienna: Katie, but how can you even --",
        "Katie: If I take back my alibi, they will throw him in jail! I want to give him a second chance. And I just don't get why can't Brad understand that. His brother basically did the same thing for him.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but Brad didn't blackmail Jack into lying for him! Nor did he threaten to throw the person Jack loved behind bars! Now, Craig did all of that, not even considering what it was doing to you. But Brad did. No wonder he's angry!",
        "Katie: So Brad went after my brother not just because Craig set him up, but to defend my honor?",
        "Vienna: Well, Brad knows you. Because he knew that it was eating you up, lying for Craig. And he couldn't handle it.",
        "Katie: I guess I'm just used to everything being about Brad.",
        "Vienna: Well, most of the times, it is. Except for when it comes to the woman he loves. You're the one person he cares about more than himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Katie thinks I'm trying to get back at Craig for setting me up for Spencer's murder. It's what he did to her that I can't forget.",
        "Dusty: I hear you. But your wife wants to let it go. So you should do the same, or it's going to come between you. Don't let Craig do that to you.",
        "Brad: 24 hours ago, you were begging me to help you nail this guy. What happened?",
        "Dusty: I didn't think about how it would affect anyone else. I don't want to be the reason you and Katie split up.",
        "Brad: You wouldn't be. Craig would.",
        "Dusty: Putting Craig behind bars isn't worth losing what you have with Katie.",
        "Brad: So, what? He just walks?",
        "Dusty: Trust me, I'll handle it. But from now on, you got to stay out of it. When you finish that drink, go home and make up with your wife. Trust me, you never know how much time you're going to have left.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Brad: I was just thinking of you.",
        "Katie: We need to talk.",
        "Brad: Yes, we do.",
        "Katie: Meet me at Metro?",
        "Brad: All right. I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You're still here.",
        "Craig: Well, I had hoped that after hearing of my upcoming nuptials, you would have done something other than just walk away.",
        "Margo: Well, I -- I'm busy.",
        "Craig: Can I at least get your blessing?",
        "Margo: You are not serious about marrying Carly.",
        "Craig: Why does everyone find it so hard to believe that I want to settle down?",
        "Margo: Carly?",
        "Craig: Well, I couldn't think of anyone who would make domestic bliss more interesting.",
        "Margo: Interesting, yes. But acceptable to the court, never. And isn't that what you need to get custody of Johnny?",
        "Craig: Who said this was about Johnny?",
        "Margo: Oh, come on, Craig? Why else would you marry again? You know, if legitimizing yourself is what you're aiming for, why don't you just find yourself another bride.",
        "Craig: Well, Carly's made some mistakes. But no one could argue that she's a wonderful mother.",
        "Margo: Deserting her children to run off with a jewel thief?",
        "Craig: A momentary lapse of judgment.",
        "Margo: And what about Jack? I mean, she has made his life miserable more than once. And she loved him.",
        "Craig: It'll be different with us.",
        "Margo: Yes. You can make each other's lives miserable.",
        "Craig: You can't even pretend to be happy for me.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I could pretend. But you're not the only one, you know, involved in this. There are children. I mean, sure Jack has to put up with her. But why should he have to put up with the both of you?",
        "Craig: Ah-ha! That's why you're opposed to this -- you're on Jack's side.",
        "Margo: On Jack's side?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm! You think its okay for him to get married to Janet, and still have control of Carly's life. Well, I don't. And as soon as we're married, the days of Jack Snyder calling the shots for Carly are over. For good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Saying \"Yes\" to Craig had nothing to do with Jack and Janet.",
        "Lily: Carly, when you told me about the proposal yesterday, you made a point of telling me how much it would bug Jack if you accepted Craig's proposal.",
        "Carly: Well, since then I've made peace with Jack. And we have agreed to stay out of each other's personal lives. I mean, except where the kids are concerned, of course.",
        "Lily: Well, if it's not to get back at Jack, what other reason could you possibly have to jump into a marriage with Craig Montgomery?",
        "Carly: I enjoy his company. He has a wicked sense of humor, which I like. And besides being fun, he's -- he's powerful. You know? Rich!",
        "Lily: So far, I'm not hearing grounds for marriage.",
        "Carly: It's nice to have a man around.",
        "Lily: If the man is Craig, I'd rather be alone.",
        "Carly: Look, I know it was vile of him to take Worldwide away from your mother.",
        "Lily: He was fun, rich and powerful then, too! But he used me and he used our friendship.",
        "Carly: But there must be something good about him, or your own sister wouldn't have stayed married to him as long as she did.",
        "Lily: Well there was, for a while. And then Craig reverted back to his old ways. I mean, when Sierra figured that out, she came to her senses. And trust me, she could not get away from him fast enough.",
        "Carly: But I'd have an advantage over her, you see? Because I'm not in love with him.",
        "Lily: And you are really okay with a loveless marriage?",
        "Carly: What's love done, besides leave me heartbroken and in debt? Maybe marrying for practical reasons this time wouldn't be the worst idea in the world. Not that that's what I've decided to do.",
        "Lily: I think you have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You know you're wrong. Jack would like nothing more than to have someone take Carly off his hands.",
        "Craig: Then I'm doing him a favor.",
        "Margo: Someone other than you.",
        "Craig: That's because he knows I would finally get Carly out from under his thumb.",
        "Margo: No, because he's concerned about the influence you have on his kids.",
        "Craig: That's what he says. I think Jack's involvement in Carly's life has less to do with the kids, than it does with the fact that he's just not ready to let her go.",
        "Margo: Wrong again. He loves Janet.",
        "Craig: Oh, I'm sure he does. She'll just never be Carly.",
        "Margo: Oh, thank God, for Jack's sake.",
        "Craig: Look, I didn't come here to argue about Jack Snyder. Do I get your blessing or not?",
        "Margo: Oh, why, Craig? You're going to do whatever you want, whether I bless you or not.",
        "Craig: Yes, but I would do it with peace in my heart if I knew my sister was pulling for me. Besides, I need a best man and I have no friends in this town.",
        "Margo: Well, in that sense, you and Carly are perfect together.",
        "Craig: I knew you would come around.",
        "Margo: Oh, don't, don't, don't. Oh! I will not wear a tux.",
        "Craig: Can I at least expect you at Metro later?",
        "Margo: Oh, my God. Are you tying the knot tonight?",
        "Craig: No. No, no, no. But we are announcing our engagement.",
        "Margo: Oh. Well then, like I said, I'm busy.",
        "Craig: And I'm family. And I expect you to be there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So where are you going to register for your china pattern?",
        "Carly: Will you stop? I haven't made a decision yet.",
        "Lily: Could've fooled me.",
        "Carly: Just because I can make a case for it, doesn't mean I'm ready to run down the aisle. Besides, I just got myself together after another crazy --",
        "Lily: Crazy affair, with my husband.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I -- I didn't mean to --",
        "Lily: It's okay.",
        "Carly: Really?",
        "Lily: No. But it's better than pretending it never happened.",
        "Carly: Well, talking with you like this -- sort of feels like it never did.",
        "Lily: For me too.",
        "Carly: The important thing is I've learned from my mistakes. And I just cannot lose sight of what's right and wrong again.",
        "Lily: And you know, deep down inside, that marrying Craig would be the wrong thing to do. Don't you?",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Hi, Craig.",
        "Craig: How's the future Mrs. Montgomery?",
        "Carly: About that --",
        "Craig: Has a nice ring to it, don't you think?",
        "Carly: I think we need to talk.",
        "Craig: I agree. Can you meet me at Metro for a drink?",
        "Carly: Now?",
        "Craig: The sooner, the better.",
        "Carly: He wants me to meet him at Metro.",
        "Lily: What are you going to say?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm just going to tell him that I had a moment of temporary insanity and that I can't possibly marry him.",
        "Lily: Good answer.",
        "Carly: You think?",
        "Lily: Absolutely.",
        "Carly: Then why am I so nervous?",
        "Lily: Well, you shouldn't be.",
        "Carly: Even though it's Craig? I mean, has a way of making people do things they don't really want to do.",
        "Lily: You have a point there.",
        "Carly: Will you come with me? As moral support?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Carly: Okay. That's okay. I can handle it. He's just a man.",
        "Lily: Ooh. That means trouble for you. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jack whistles]",
        "Janet: You like?",
        "Jack: What's not to like? I don't think Carly's going to like it, though.",
        "Janet: Oh, I'll take that as a compliment. Can you zip me up, please?",
        "Jack: It'd be my pleasure.",
        "Janet: Jack?",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm?",
        "Janet: Jack, Carly's waiting.",
        "Jack: Oh, let her wait.",
        "Janet: Come on. Think of it this way -- the sooner we get to the cocktail party, the sooner we can get back here and finish what we started.",
        "Jack: Well, come on, woman, time's a-wasting!",
        "Janet: All right!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clerk: Mr. Donovan? I have a message for you.",
        "Dusty: Thank you. \"I know what you're going through. But I have something to tell you that might help. Meet me at Metro. C.\" Ready to go?",
        "Johnny: Are we going to get a milkshake?",
        "Dusty: Well, that's what I promised, right? But first, we gotta stop off and see Parker's mom. It won't take long.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, glasses look good. Anything else I can take care of?",
        "Vienna: Just him. I'll be in the back if you need me.",
        "Brad: Hi.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Brad: I'm glad you called.",
        "Katie: Are you?",
        "Brad: I've been totally miserable.",
        "Katie: So have I.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: Me too.",
        "Brad: Now, I know why you don't want your brother to go to jail. It has more to do with Johnny than with Craig.",
        "Katie: I just know how much he missed his son. And to take him away from him, when he just got him back --",
        "Brad: I understand.",
        "Katie: And I understand that you were just looking out for me. But that doesn't mean I'm ready to turn on Craig.",
        "Brad: I'm not asking you to. As much as I want to nail that guy for the hell he put us through -- if it's going to hurt you or us, it's just -- it's not worth it.",
        "Katie: Good. So, can we forget about Craig and just focus on you and me?",
        "Brad: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Katie: Hey, Johnny! There's my big boy. Oh, how are you feeling?",
        "Dusty: Glad to see you took my advice.",
        "Brad: What? Are you checking up on me?",
        "Dusty: I'm here to see Carly. Is she around?",
        "Vienna: She should be here any minute -- I hope.",
        "Katie: You are getting so strong!",
        "Dusty: Thanks to you.",
        "Katie: You're not mad at me?",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm not thrilled about what Craig did. But you're the reason my son's alive. So that cancels out everything. Right?",
        "Brad: Oh, well look who's out on the town. You know, good for you for getting the old man out of his recliner.",
        "Janet: I didn't do it. Carly did.",
        "Katie: Carly?",
        "Janet: Yeah. She is the one who invited us here.",
        "Jack: Is she even here?",
        "Vienna: No. Which means the party is starting without the hostess.",
        "Dusty: Party? The note Carly sent me didn't say anything about a party.",
        "Carly: I didn't leave you a note.",
        "Jack: You left us one.",
        "Janet: Yeah. Or at least we thought you did.",
        "Carly: I didn't.",
        "Vienna: You did leave me instructions to put together a small cocktail reception, didn't you?",
        "Carly: No, I didn't do that either.",
        "Craig: I did. Katie, I didn't leave you a note. But I'm glad you're here.",
        "Brad: We were just leaving.",
        "Craig: Please don't. I'd like you to hear this, as well. And there's my boy. How are you, Johnny?",
        "Dusty: What's going on here?",
        "Craig: Not to worry, nothing's wrong. In fact, things couldn't be more right.",
        "Carly: What are you doing?",
        "Craig: You know, I was hoping that Margo could be here. But I don't think she'll be able to make it.",
        "Carly: Make what? Why did you ask these people here?",
        "Craig: To share our happiness.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God.",
        "Jack: What the hell is he talking about?",
        "Craig: Carly and I are engaged to be married.",
        "Jack: Engaged?",
        "Craig: That's right. Carly's agreed to be my bride.",
        "Jack: What kind of a sick joke is this?",
        "Carly: Jack, just listen to me, okay --",
        "Jack: Is that -- is that why he gave you the money? Because you said you'd marry him?",
        "Carly: No!",
        "Jack: You said nothing was going on.",
        "Carly: And I was telling the truth.",
        "Jack: Don't -- don't insult me, please. On the subject of Craig, every word out of your mouth has obviously been a lie --",
        "Craig: Watch how you speak to my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Carly: Craig, please don't make things worse --",
        "Jack: I said I'd back off and this is how you respond? By agreeing to be his wife?",
        "Carly: It's complicated, Jack.",
        "Craig: And wonderful.",
        "Carly: Craig!",
        "Jack: It's not going to happen. I'm not going to let it.",
        "Craig: Well, that's not your decision to make.",
        "Jack: The hell it isn't!",
        "Janet: Let's go, Jack.",
        "Jack: No! I thought leaving your kids was the worst thing you could do to them. But now you've topped yourself, Carly. Now you're going to subject them to this!",
        "Craig: That's a fine thing to say to the man who saved your son's life.",
        "Jack: I didn't know you'd want his mother in exchange, Craig!",
        "Dusty: What he wants is custody of my son. And if you think this farce of an engagement is going to get you that, you're wrong.",
        "Craig: You've seemed to forgotten that he's my son, too.",
        "Katie: Hey, Johnny. There is a huge refrigerator in the back, bigger than anyone you've ever seen. Want to go see what's inside. Don't worry, Sweetie. They're not going to hurt each other, are you?",
        "Craig: Everything's going to be just fine, Johnny. Don't worry.",
        "Dusty: It's not going to work. This instant family -- it's not going to make people forget that you already killed one son. You drove your daughter away!",
        "Craig: Hurl all the ugly accusations you want but don't dismiss this engagement or my connection to Carly.",
        "Jack: Since when?",
        "Craig: Well, it's no secret that your ex and I have a history. And since I've come back to town, that spark's been re-ignited.",
        "Carly: Don't push it!",
        "Craig: And don't protect his feelings. He's moved on. Why shouldn't you? We have as much as a right to a future as anyone else. In fact, I think it's time we show the world just how happy we are.",
        "Carly: What are you doing?",
        "Jack: You can't really want this.",
        "Craig: Why not? Because she's supposed to want you? Aw, poor Jack. You look like you're afraid you're going to lose your biggest fan.",
        "Janet: Don't do this, Jack. Don't, please, please, please?",
        "Craig: You just can't let go, can you, Jack? You married my sister and you humiliated her because you couldn't get Carly out of your system. Are you going to do that to the new wife now, too?",
        "Carly: What am I going to do?",
        "Dusty: You can't go through with it, Carly. You know he's poison. Look at all the lives he's ruined, including your own sister.",
        "Craig: Remind me to take Dusty off the guest list for the wedding.",
        "Katie: See? I told you everybody's fine.",
        "Dusty: We're leaving.",
        "Craig: Oh, not until I have a chance to say good-bye to --",
        "Dusty: Please, don't touch --",
        "[Dusty punches Craig]",
        "Johnny: Nooooo!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You know, Dusty, what happened to the promise you and Craig made to Katie? That you two are going to make peace for Johnny's sake?",
        "Dusty: You didn't think Craig would honor that, did you?",
        "Margo: No, I didn't. But he's not the one who messed up tonight, is he?",
        "Lily: May I see him?",
        "Margo: Yes, please. Maybe you can talk some sense into him.",
        "Lily: We both know that punch didn't come out of nowhere. Craig provoked him.",
        "Margo: Dusty swung first. If I hadn't brought him in, my brother would've insisted on it.",
        "Lily: Craig's just doing this to get Johnny.",
        "Margo: Well, if Dusty doesn't get it together, he just might succeed.",
        "Dusty: I blew it, didn't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Johnny: Is my other dad in trouble?",
        "Carly: Oh, of course not, Honey. He just needs to cool down a little bit, that's all. Hey, I've got some homemade brownies in the kitchen. Would you like me to heat one up and put a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on it? Would you like that? All right.",
        "Craig: Isn't Carly the best? Come on, I bet you're hot in that jacket. Let me help you out. There you go. Is that better? What's on your mind, Johnny? Talk to me.",
        "Johnny: Why did my other dad hit you?",
        "Craig: Well, I guess he didn't want me to hug you.",
        "Johnny: But you're also my dad.",
        "Craig: Yes, I am. You know, sometimes grownups do things they shouldn't.",
        "Carly: Right. But what happened tonight is never going to happen again, is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I tried to warn Carly. When Craig is around, bad things happen.",
        "Janet: He didn't start it, Jack.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, he knew that this announcement of settling down and getting married was a clear indication he was going after custody. It's no wonder Dusty flipped out.",
        "Janet: Yeah, he wasn't the only one.",
        "Jack: Yes, obviously, I wasn't -- I wasn't happy.",
        "Janet: No kidding!",
        "Jack: You know how I feel about Craig being a part of my kids' lives.",
        "Janet: Are you sure it's just Craig being a part of your kids' lives?",
        "Jack: See, he's doing it already.",
        "Janet: What -- what is he doing?",
        "Jack: He's making -- he's making trouble. Montgomery throws a grenade, everybody suffers.",
        "Janet: Really, so what he said about you not wanting to lose Carly --",
        "Jack: Was absolute baloney. Are you kidding me? You should know that by now. The guy is bad news, Janet. He puts on a front like he's Mr. Sensitive, helping that kid at Al's, teaching you the Heimlich, right before he turns your world upside down. Did you see what he did in front of his own son tonight?",
        "Janet: He just wanted to hug him.",
        "Jack: Yes, after -- after he made Dusty mad enough to want to hit him.",
        "Janet: You really think Craig wanted to upset that little boy?",
        "Jack: I think Craig wanted to make trouble. And that's exactly what he did.",
        "Janet: I can't believe a parent would do that on purpose.",
        "Jack: Craig is no parent. He's a parasite. He feeds off the misery of other people and I have a feeling this is only the beginning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I don't think throwing a punch at Craig in public with his 5-year-old son as a witness is going to help your case.",
        "Dusty: You know as well as I do -- he wanted me to lose it.",
        "Lily: Well, if you know that about him, why do you fall into his trap?",
        "Dusty: Every time I see him, it's not just what he did to you, or me, or my son -- it's what he did to my wife. He put her through hell. We lost a lot of time because of that son of a bitch.",
        "Lily: Listen to yourself. He's getting to you and he's not even here. I get it. I have a hard time looking at him, too, after what he did to me -- to my family. I don't have anything that he wants and you do.",
        "Dusty: Which is why he can't marry Carly. He can't show up in court looking like the perfect family man.",
        "Lily: Based on what she told me earlier, I don't think that's going to happen.",
        "Dusty: Well, I hope not, for her sake. How can she even think of letting that guy around her kids?",
        "Lily: Apparently, Craig's been putting on quite a show for Carly and her kids. Come on, you know Craig. When he wants something, he can be very persuasive.",
        "Dusty: He wants my boy. I promised Jennifer I would protect him from Craig. I already feel like a failure.",
        "Lily: No, you just need to figure out a way how not to let him get to you.",
        "Dusty: What am I supposed to do? Sit around, wait for Carly to come to her senses?",
        "Lily: Another thing, you could apologize to your son. And I know you're going to hate this, but you could apologize to Craig, too.",
        "Dusty: You're the second person this week who's told me to do that.",
        "Lily: Maybe you should start listening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I promise you, Johnny, no matter what happens, there will be no more fighting between me and Dusty. Do you believe me?",
        "Carly: Hey, look what I found? Would you like to draw a picture? I'd bet that you are as good an artist as your mommy was. Hey, how about some hot cocoa to go with this brownie, huh? All right!",
        "Craig: Hey, I'll be right back. I know I've said it before, but you really do have a magic touch with children. You're a terrific mom, Carly. And I think your kids are --",
        "Carly: Don't you ever do that to me again.",
        "Craig: Do what?",
        "Carly: You made a public spectacle out of us tonight.",
        "Craig: I just wanted to show people how happy I am.",
        "Carly: Bull. You wanted to stick it to Jack and Dusty, and you used me to do it. Well, if that's why you want to be with me, you can take your lame proposal and get the hell out of my life.",
        "Craig: Sticking it to Jack and Dusty is not why I asked you to marry me.",
        "Carly: Then what is?",
        "Craig: You wouldn't believe it.",
        "Carly: Probably not.",
        "Craig: I admire you.",
        "Carly: You're right. I don't believe it.",
        "Craig: That's because you look at your past and only see the times that you've been knocked down. Where as I see all the times you've picked yourself up. Like me, you have withstood the judgment of moral hypocrites and yet you've still managed to live a successful and productive life. We're survivors, you and me, Carly --",
        "Carly: All right! All right, that's enough. Firstly, I am not like you. And secondly, your noble speeches about my strength and courage just don't fly with me.",
        "Craig: Even if it's the truth?",
        "Carly: The only truth I want to hear is what that little gathering of the clan at Metro was really about.",
        "Craig: Okay. Part of it was about sticking it to Jack and Dusty. But that doesn't mean I was out of line announcing our engagement. I mean, you did say \"Yes.\" And since we're being honest, why did you?",
        "Carly: Why did I what?",
        "Craig: Agree to marry me. I mean, I know you don't love me. In fact, on more than one occasion, you've called me a despicable monster with no capacity for human emotion.",
        "Carly: Did I do that?",
        "Craig: You should listen to yourself sometimes.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry.",
        "Craig: No, it's all right.",
        "Carly: It isn't. I know -- I know what it's like to have somebody make you feel like you're not worthy.",
        "Craig: Come on, wasn't he a part of why you accepted my proposal? It's okay. I won't think less of you if I'm right.",
        "Carly: All right -- yeah, he was part of it.",
        "Craig: And you think we're not alike? Carly, we are made for each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You know, if Craig is the kind of guy who doesn't care if his child gets hurt just to get what he wants --",
        "Jack: There are no ifs about it.",
        "Janet: Then I think you were right to keep him away from your kids.",
        "Jack: So you want me to stop Carly from marrying Craig?",
        "Janet: No, I still want you to back off.",
        "Jack: Well, that wasn't worked so far.",
        "Janet: Yeah, nothing's going to work. In fact, you know, if you don't back off, it will just make things worse.",
        "Jack: What if Carly actually goes through with marrying Craig?",
        "Janet: Then she's not the woman I thought she was.",
        "Jack: What kind of woman is that?",
        "Janet: The kind who would never even consider forever unless she was in love.",
        "Jack: What if Carly does love Craig?",
        "Janet: No, she doesn't. I watched her with him tonight. There's no love there.",
        "Jack: What makes you so sure?",
        "Janet: I also watched her with you.",
        "Jack: Hey, when you asked me before, whether this was about holding on to Carly, you don't actually believe --",
        "Janet: I wouldn't have married you if I did. Are you coming?",
        "Jack: In a minute.",
        "Janet: What are you brooding about now?",
        "Jack: What if you're wrong and Carly actually marries Craig without loving him?",
        "Janet: Well, there's nothing we can do to stop it.",
        "Jack: Want to bet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I'm letting you off the hook again. If there's a next time --",
        "Lily: There won't be a next time. Will there?",
        "Dusty: As long as Craig stays away from my son.",
        "Lily: Come on, let me give you a ride home.",
        "Dusty: Just bring me to Metro. I got to pick up Johnny.",
        "Lily: Actually, Johnny's not at Metro. Craig and Carly took him to her house.",
        "Margo: Remember what I said. Keep your temper in check.",
        "Lily: I'll make sure that he does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Do you really think it was a good idea to let Carly and Craig take Johnny home? Did you hear me?",
        "Brad: I thought we weren't going to talk about your brother.",
        "Katie: No, we weren't going to fight about him.",
        "Brad: If I tell you what I think, we're going to fight.",
        "Katie: Okay, let's not talk about it. There's nothing I can do about it, anyway.",
        "Brad: Technically, that's still talking about it.",
        "Katie: Okay, okay.",
        "Brad: Just let it go. What?",
        "Katie: You're telling me to let it go?",
        "Brad: Well, if I had done that, we wouldn't have spent the past month slamming doors and sleeping on sofas.",
        "Katie: Maybe we needed that to get to the place we are now.",
        "Brad: Well, my back could've done without the sofa part.",
        "Katie: I'll give you a massage when we get home.",
        "Brad: Okay, I'm going to hold you to that.",
        "Katie: I know you will.",
        "Brad: My back missed you. My front missed you. I missed you.",
        "Katie: I didn't go anywhere.",
        "Brad: When we fight, it just -- it feels like you're on the other side of the world.",
        "Katie: Well then it's good to be home.",
        "Vienna: Well, it's good to see at least you two are back on track.",
        "Brad: We have decided that we are no longer taking sides.",
        "Katie: Only with each other.",
        "Vienna: Well, that's something worth celebrating. They say that love conquers all and sometimes that's even true. So, cheers.",
