        "Jack: A rare synthetic substance.",
        "Margo: Yeah, but once it's identified, we got a better shot at finding Dusty Donovan's killer.",
        "Jack: Anybody in the hospital could have gotten a hold of a syringe. But this substance -- if we're talking experimental --",
        "Margo: Then we're right back to my relatives, Chris and Craig. Have we ruled out your family?",
        "Jack: Holden and Lily fought with Dusty just before -- just before he was killed, in front of witnesses.",
        "Margo: Huh. Alibis?",
        "Jack: Each other. Lily just OD'd on meds and alcohol. Holden was with her afterwards and never left her side.",
        "Margo: Lily wasn't exactly conscious.",
        "Jack: Holden could have sneaked out, managed to get his hands on a needle and some rare synthetic drug, but there's no evidence that says he did. Besides, if Holden wanted Dusty dead, he'd do it with his bare hands.",
        "Margo: Yeah, had to ask the question.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. You're questioning Craig?",
        "Margo: He's a man with a motive, and he and Dusty didn't exactly get along.",
        "Jack: You want me to stick around?",
        "Margo: No, no. Go, go to lunch.",
        "Craig: Hi, got your message. I brought coffee. And donuts.",
        "Margo: Craig, this is a murder investigation. I don't think it's going to be solved with a Boston cr\u00e8me.",
        "Craig: You think I killed Dusty.",
        "Margo: Why did you think I wanted to talk to you?",
        "Craig: I -- get this, I thought that my sister was actually concerned about me, about how I was handling losing my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Barbara. You know, if you're here to talk about Paul or the baby, I --",
        "Barbara: I'm here about Dusty.",
        "Meg: Holden told me.",
        "Barbara: I can't believe he's gone.",
        "Meg: I didn't realize you two were still so close.",
        "Barbara: He's my son-in-law. I mean, even after Jennifer died, he -- he's still family.",
        "Meg: Can I get you anything?",
        "Barbara: Coffee?",
        "Meg: Yeah, of course.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Meg: So when is the service?",
        "Barbara: Tomorrow. In the church here in Luther's Corners. I thought that maybe you would --",
        "Meg: I want to come. Thank you.",
        "Barbara: I also want to offer my condolences about the baby.",
        "Meg: Barbara, I don't want to talk about this with you.",
        "Barbara: How about with Paul? Will you talk to Paul about it?",
        "Meg: No, I don't want to talk about this at all.",
        "Barbara: You know what? The baby was his child too. And my grandchild. We're all grieving, Meg, not just you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dylan: You want one?",
        "Parker: I'm good.",
        "Judd: So you should check out the party.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I'll think about it.",
        "Judd: What's to think about? No, Parents, there'll be girls, beer --",
        "Dylan: Girls drinking beer.",
        "Jack: [Clears throat]",
        "Parker: Dad. Hi.",
        "Jack: You're too young to smoke.",
        "Dylan: Uh, yeah, sorry.",
        "Jack: Now pick it up.",
        "Parker: Dad, this is Dylan. Judd.",
        "Jack: Judd.",
        "Dylan: See you later, Parker.",
        "Jack: What are you hanging out with these guys for?",
        "Parker: They're my friends.",
        "Jack: They're older than you, Parker.",
        "Parker: Just by a grade. And they're on the hockey team. We were just going over some plays. I have to go.",
        "Jack: Parker, come back here. I'm talking to you. You're grounded, you're supposed to go straight home after school and study.",
        "Parker: I finished my homework in study hall. Why can't I hang out with my friends?",
        "Jack: Because you're grounded. And these kids were smoking, Parker. You know how we feel about that.",
        "Parker: Well, Mom's still hanging out with a ventriloquist. And he's a felon.",
        "Jack: Parker.",
        "Parker: And you don't even care that he's always trying to hit on her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How's the back room?",
        "Sam: A little cramped, but I'm getting used to it.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'm sorry, Sam. But like I said, as soon as I have more money I can pay you a little bit more --",
        "Sam: It's okay. It's all right. It really is, it's okay.",
        "Carly: Well, you moving out really did make things easier for me with Jack.",
        "Sam: And Parker. I set the kid off, what can I say? But eventually, maybe he'll get used to me.",
        "Carly: Maybe.",
        "Sam: Hey, how 'bout you and I going out to dinner tonight before we open. It gets kind of lonely around here just talking to Cowboy Jack.",
        "Carly: Gee, Sam, I'm sorry. I can't. I was just on my way out to see my sister. But thanks for the invite. You're a good pal. See ya.",
        "Sam: Bye.",
        "Cowboy Jack: Pal? She just called you pal.",
        "Sam: Yeah, I heard her.",
        "Cowboy Jack: You gotta make a move, Partner.",
        "Sam: Think so?",
        "Cowboy Jack: But be smart about it. Don't spook that filly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. Are you all right? You don't look so good.",
        "Rosanna: Paul left me.",
        "Carly: What happened?",
        "Rosanna: Well, um. It's just like with you and Jack. I, um, made mistakes. And he left.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, what kind of mistakes did you make, Honey?",
        "Rosanna: Actually, Carly, I was thinking you and I -- we both lost the men that we love, and maybe we need each other's help to get them back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I know you're worried about your mom. But she can handle herself.",
        "Parker: Most of the time, yeah. But I don't trust the guy. And I don't think you trust him either, Dad. Do you?",
        "Jack: I don't want you to be concerned about him, Parker.",
        "Parker: Why not? If Mom marries Sam or if you married Katie, it affects me and J.J. and Sage.",
        "Jack: But your mother's not going to marry Sam. And Katie and I -- we're over.",
        "Parker: Yeah, because you didn't fight to keep Katie away from Brad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Ow!",
        "Katie: What? Did that hurt?",
        "Brad: Yes, my leg is broken!",
        "Katie: We don't know that for sure.",
        "Brad: I know for sure. I've had a broken leg before. I know what it feels like.",
        "Katie: Well, you shouldn't have been wandering around in the woods.",
        "Brad: I was looking for you! Why did you take off anyway?",
        "Katie: I don't know. You should have been watching where you were going.",
        "Brad: Well, I will keep that in mind next time you get lost in the woods.",
        "Katie: I didn't get lost! You were the one that -- ugh, no signal. All right. We got to get back to the car, and get you some help.",
        "Brad: Go ahead. I'll wait here.",
        "Katie: No, you'll freeze to death! Or get eaten by wolves!",
        "Brad: Wolves? This is Wisconsin.",
        "Katie: Yeah, they have wolves here. Lots of them. Didn't you read your research for the ice-fishing story? Oh, perfect! Here.",
        "Brad: What am I supposed to do with that? Hit myself over the head so I don't feel any pain.",
        "Katie: Use it as a walking stick, and you can lean on me.",
        "Brad: I'll crush you.",
        "Katie: I'm a lot stronger than you think.",
        "Brad: Okay. Ow. Ow.",
        "Katie: One, two, three.",
        "Brad: Oh! Ow! Okay. All right.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Brad: Okay. Now what?",
        "Katie: Take a step.",
        "Brad: Okay. All right. Okay.",
        "Katie: How was that?",
        "Brad: That's great. This is great.",
        "Katie: Good. We can do this!",
        "Brad: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Katie: You're not even leaning on me. You're putting too much weight on that leg.",
        "Brad: No, I'm fine. Let's keep going.",
        "Katie: You sure?",
        "Brad: Yeah. Yeah. We're doing great. You know, look how far we've come already.",
        "Katie: No, no, don't, don't. Look at me, look at me, I got you.",
        "Brad: You are beautiful. You know that.",
        "Katie: Brad. [They fall down] Brad!",
        "Brad: Ow. Katie, you okay? You all right?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?",
        "Brad: I think I broke my other leg!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: At least let me tell the guys I can't hang out with them.",
        "Jack: They'll get the idea when you don't show up. And tomorrow when you see them in school, you can tell them you're grounded.",
        "Parker: I shouldn't have brought up Katie, because now you're all mad.",
        "Jack: I am not mad, Parker. I'm worried about you. Hanging out with these kids. Taking that money. Trying to frame Sam. I mean, come on, that's ridiculous.",
        "Parker: Are you and Mom going to send me away to that camp for the bad kids?",
        "Jack: And have to deal without your happy-go-lucky personality for even one day? Listen, I told you that you weren't going anywhere. I'm going to keep my promise.",
        "Parker: Are you going to send me back to the shrink?",
        "Jack: If we think it'll help, yeah, maybe.",
        "Parker: I don't get it. I'm supposed to be perfect all the time, but you and Mom mess up all you want and nobody ever calls you guys on it.",
        "Jack: We call ourselves on it. It's called guilt. And then we pass it on to you, and you can pass it on to your kids and our work is done.",
        "Parker: What happens if Mom starts dating the creepy guy?",
        "Jack: Would you give your mom some credit? No way she's going to fall for a guy who's best friend is a wooden doll.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cowboy Jack: Well?",
        "Sam: I got to get Carly to see me as more than just an employee.",
        "Cowboy Jack: Well, grease a pig and set her loose. That's obvious. How are you gonna do that?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Sam: Metro.",
        "Kit: I love the way you say that.",
        "Sam: Kit! How you doing, Babe?",
        "Kit: My court date's been postponed again.",
        "Sam: What is that? The third time?",
        "Kit: I really don't know when I'm gonna get all this legal mess sorted out. How's it going with you?",
        "Sam: Well, what do you think? I'm missing you like crazy.",
        "Kit: How's the club? Are we making money yet?",
        "Sam: It's getting better. But I'm glad you called because, well, there's something I need to talk to you about.",
        "Kit: Is something wrong? Is Carly doing another one of those benefits again?",
        "Sam: Oh, no, no, no. Nothing like that. I was just thinking that maybe you shouldn't call Carly anymore.",
        "Kit: She's my business partner. Why wouldn't I call her? Did she told you to tell me to stop calling her?",
        "Sam: Well, you know how it is. I mean, next to you, she's just sort of insecure.",
        "Kit: How am I supposed to find out updates on my business if I don't call?",
        "Sam: Well, I'll call you. I'll call you everyday if you want me to. In fact, I'll even leave messages with the attorney. And give you the day's receipts. Whatever you want.",
        "Kit: I don't know.",
        "Sam: I'm looking after your investment. You just got to give Carly some space.",
        "Kit: Are you sure that's all this is about?",
        "Sam: Well, of course. What else could it be?",
        "Kit: I don't know. Maybe there's something going on between you and Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I switched the DNA results.",
        "Carly: Oh, no.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I knew that if Paul found out that he was the father, he was going to go back to Meg, and I couldn't let that happen.",
        "Carly: But it did happen because Paul found out.",
        "Rosanna: And worse than that, Meg had a miscarriage.",
        "Carly: Oh, God.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, and Paul won't even speak to me let now, much less forgive me. Carly, what do I do?",
        "Carly: You're asking me?",
        "Rosanna: Well, you lied to Jack before, and he came back to you, so --",
        "Carly: Rosanna, that was before I told the biggest lie of my life and lost him for good. Didn't you learn anything from my mistakes?",
        "Rosanna: What are you saying? That I deserve to lose Paul? That we won't get back together again because of what I did?",
        "Carly: No, no, of course not, but, Rosanna, this is Paul's child. How do you expect him to get past this?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I just know that I can't lose him. I'll do whatever it takes to get him back. But can you help me?",
        "Carly: I don't know if I know how to help you. Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, God.",
        "Carly: Hey! Hey! Sit down. Rosanna. What just happened?",
        "Rosanna: I think I just realized -- I'm never gonna be all right without Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Your wife left you because you tried to murder her unborn child, so I don't have a lot of sympathy for you.",
        "Craig: So much for family loyalty. What do you want?",
        "Margo: You going to lose the company now that Meg is gone?",
        "Craig: Why do you want to know that?",
        "Margo: Just answer the question.",
        "Craig: It is Meg's corporation, she can do what she decides. I am hoping to gain her trust, at least with the corporation.",
        "Margo: So Montgomery Enterprises is still important to you. So if this project with the hospital falls through --",
        "Craig: A motive? That's what this is about? You think I killed Dusty to protect my corporation?",
        "Margo: Dusty Donovan was determined to derail your research project. If he had succeeded, it would have cost you a lot of money and lot of prestige.",
        "Craig: Not enough to kill for.",
        "Margo: How did you feel when you found out that Dusty was out of the way? Were you relieved? Were you happy?",
        "Craig: I hated him. Is that the answer you wanted to hear? He drove my daughter away from me, and my son. The man shot me in the chest and almost killed me.",
        "Margo: Did you want him dead?",
        "Craig: You bet I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Here?",
        "Brad: Higher.",
        "Katie: Here?",
        "Brad: Higher. I was lying. I had you going.",
        "Katie: Okay, Brad! No jokes. I have to get you back to the car, we have to find the main road, and get you to a hospital.",
        "Brad: Oh, yeah. Okay, there's no way, you're gonna be over to get me all the way back there. Just go ahead. I'll wait here.",
        "Katie: No, it's freezing, you have an injury, you could pass out and die and get hypothermia.",
        "Brad: Not if you hurry.",
        "Katie: See, the thing is -- it's kind of scary out there, and I don't want to run into wolves or bears or whatever. Can you please come with me? And save me, please, Brad?",
        "Brad: You're freaked out by a couple of wimpy wolves? You don't have to worry, okay? Because I got my stick, I'll beat them away. Let's go. Okay. Let's do this.",
        "Katie: Hey. Okay, give me the keys.",
        "Brad: No way. No way. We'll just start up the car, we'll get warm, and then I'll drive us back.",
        "Katie: How are you going to drive with a broken leg?",
        "[Car engine stalls]",
        "Brad: Try it again. Try it again.",
        "Katie: It's dead. How can it not start? We're not out of gas.",
        "Brad: Turn on the lights. Battery's dead.",
        "Katie: Can we fix it?",
        "Brad: We'd need another car to give us a jump.",
        "Katie: There aren't any other cars, I haven't seen any. We're on a road nobody uses. No signal.",
        "Brad: Mine does too.",
        "Katie: That food Vienna got us is not going to last long. I don't have any aspirin to give you for your pain.",
        "Brad: It's not so bad. Ow!",
        "Katie: What, your leg?",
        "Brad: Oh, yeah, well, no. I think I hit my head harder than I thought. Ah.",
        "Katie: Brad, you're bleeding.",
        "Brad: Yeah, great.",

        "Meg: Barbara, if there is something you want from me, please, tell me what it is, and then please go.",
        "Barbara: I want you to work things out with Paul.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. That's not going to happen.",
        "Barbara: What do you want him to do, apologize?",
        "Meg: I want him to leave me alone!",
        "Barbara: You claim to love him.",
        "Meg: I loved him. Yes. We were going to have a baby. I wanted to raise our son together. I wanted to be married to him. But all Paul ever wanted was to get revenge against Craig!",
        "Barbara: How did you expect him to act after everything that Craig has done to him?",
        "Meg: I expected the man I loved to love me and our child, enough to just leave Craig alone. But he can't do that. And because he can't do that, I can't be with him.",
        "Barbara: I see. And Craig?",
        "Meg: I'm done with both of them. Now, please --",
        "Barbara: About tomorrow --",
        "Meg: I don't think I could go to Dusty's service, not if you keep pushing me like \u0096",
        "Barbara: I won't push, okay? Please come. Dusty would want you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Why the sudden need for privacy, Sis? You going to torture a confession out of me?",
        "Margo: Because I don't want the entire squad room hearing this. You better get yourself a lawyer.",
        "Craig: Because I thought about killing Dusty?",
        "Margo: Why weren't you at the hospital the night of the murder?",
        "Craig: I had other things to do.",
        "Margo: The signing ceremony was a very big deal for Montgomery Enterprises. Why weren't you there? And Craig, don't even think about lying to me.",
        "Craig: I couldn't face it. Not a cocktail party, and the press -- I was a little upset about losing Meg.",
        "Margo: So you stayed home?",
        "Craig: No. I went to the airport. My plan was to go to the first warm-weather destination I saw on the departure board, but I changed my mind and went back to the Lakeview.",
        "Margo: All right. Is there anyone who can verify this?",
        "Craig: What -- you think I need an alibi?",
        "Margo: Yes, I do. But you being you, just make a phone call, buy one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I saw Sam talking to his stupid dummy. He says he's going to put the moves on Mom.",
        "Jack: Sam or the dummy?",
        "Parker: I'm worried about Mom.",
        "Jack: Oh, don't be. That's not your job, Parker.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but we're still a family, right? Isn't that what you guys always say?",
        "Jack: Yes, but --",
        "Parker: And I'm not supposed to try to protect my family?",
        "Jack: Okay, you want to help out your mom and me? Here's how. You take care of yourself. You don't hang out with these -- these bad kids. You don't do drugs, smoke, or drink. You keep your nose clean.",
        "Parker: I know.",
        "Jack: Listen to me. It's very important. Your mom and I, we can handle losing each other. But the thought of losing one of you kids -- we need you to take care of yourself. Don't worry about us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Relax, Honey. Nothing is going on between me and Carly. You know how much I love you.",
        "Kit: I love you, too. It's just when I'm not with you, and you get lonely -- Baby, I know how you get, okay? You just can't help yourself sometimes.",
        "Sam: Come on. Carly's my boss. I'm not going to go there. And if it makes you feel any better, I'm not even staying at Carly's house anymore. I'm bunking here at the club.",
        "Kit: Yeah? Why?",
        "Sam: Well, for the same reason I'm asking you to back off. I was making her nervous, like I was looking over her shoulder. So you just have to -- just back off and I'll -- I'll call you every day and keep you updated on how we're making out.",
        "Kit: Okay. Okay. Fine. As long you're w not making out.",
        "Sam: Only with you, Baby.",
        "Kit: You better keep those love letters coming, too, okay?",

        "Rosanna: Oh, no, I'm fine --",
        "Carly: No. Rosanna, nobody's fine after being in a coma for two years. And you listen to me, the doctors told you that you had to be careful, didn't they?",
        "Rosanna: I -- yes -- yeah, and I know that, all right? I also know that I will never be all right until I get Paul back. He's my life. How do I get him back, Carly?",
        "Carly: Well, I suppose you -- you start by taking the high road. By being the woman that he fell in love with.",

        "Meg: So why did you make it happen?",
        "Rosanna: Me?",
        "Meg: If you hadn't switched the paternity results, Paul would have known from the start that the baby was his. And we would have been together and I never would have had the miscarriage.",
        "Rosanna: Well, it might have happened earlier. But it's still would have happened. I mean, Paul and Craig would have still come to blow --",
        "Meg: Get out of my house!",

        "Meg: Do you really think I could ever go back to Craig after what he's done?",
        "Rosanna: You know, it's funny. You and Paul are the ones who betrayed your marriage vows. Not Craig, not I. And still, the two of you act so holier than thou.",
        "Meg: Oh, so now you are judging Paul? You know, if you have so much contempt for him, why do you even want him back?",

        "Margo: That is so not true. I always want to believe that you're innocent. I want to with my whole heart.",
        "Craig: Margo --",
        "Margo: And I checked around for any information -- any detail that might clear you, but no such luck.",
        "Craig: Thanks for checking.",
        "Margo: Yeah --",

        "Carly: Yeah, she doesn't know what's going to go on with all of her legal problems, and --",
        "Sam: Look, she didn't forge those checks and I keep telling her that I believe in her but she just won't let me -- you know, be there for her.",
        "Carly: I'm going to call her. I know I have her lawyer's number somewhere. She's going to give you another chance, you'll see.",
        "Sam: No, don't call her. Really, I think it will just make things worse.",
        "Carly: How?",

        "Sam: No, really, I've been making a little bit of money on my wood carvings. And I got an $100 tip last night at the bar. So I'm flush. So, you go get dressed up and I'm going to show you a good time.",

        "Brad: You sound scared. Look, don't be scared. Don't be scared.",
        "Katie: No, I'm not scared. I just -- I remember something that I forgot before. My cell phone got a signal earlier. It might have been a fluke, but I'm going to try again, okay?",
