        "Casey: God, run me over next time --",
        "Jade: Sorry.",
        "Casey: Last time you were in the rush like that, you were on your way to meet some guy with a gun.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I'm on my way to meet Derek with the results of the paternity test and I'm kind of --",
        "Casey: Derek, the guy who was shot by your boyfriend?",
        "Jade: Ex-boyfriend. But yeah, that's the guy.",
        "Casey: I didn't realize he was taking a bullet for his kid.",
        "Jade: Well, I'm not his kid yet.",
        "Casey: But yeah, you must be nervous.",
        "Casey: Well, you just practically ran me down on your way to find out the news.",
        "Jade: I just want to get it over with.",
        "Casey: Well, good luck! Nah, she's not nervous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Come on, pick up, Derek.",
        "Derek: It's Derek. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, I tried calling three times and I'm starting to get a little worried here. Now, the last time I did not hear from you, you were being held at gunpoint by an escaped felon. So if that is not the case, you need to come down to the hospital right now like you said you would. Jade will be here any minute and you need to be here with her when we get the paternity results. Hopefully, you're on your way. Right on time.",
        "Jade: Oh, I was up early anyway. Where's Derek?",
        "Bonnie: Good question.",
        "Jade: Well, you haven't talked to him?",
        "Bonnie: No, I haven't seen him since last night.",
        "Jade: Did you call his cell?",
        "Bonnie: I called his cell, his hotel room -- I even last a note at the front desk.",
        "Jade: Maybe he's too scared to get the results. I mean, who wouldn't be? I'm not exactly every guy's idea of daddy's little girl.",
        "Bonnie: He's the one who volunteered to have the paternity test, remember? Don't worry. He will be here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Derek? Casey. Casey Hughes. I was there at Metro when you got hurt.",
        "Derek: Right. Right.",
        "Casey: What are you doing here?",
        "Derek: Excuse me?",
        "Casey: Aren't you supposed to be at the hospital with Jade right now finding out if you're her dad? So why aren't you there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Maybe he's just stuck in traffic or maybe he had some sort of last- minute job interview. You know, he's trying really hard to find a job and he will be here.",
        "Jade: Whatever.",
        "Alison: Finally. I've been looking for you. For some reason I thought they'd put you on another floor.",
        "Bonnie: Well, Dr. Leigh's office told us to wait out here.",
        "Alison: Well, Dr. Leigh actually had an emergency so --",
        "Jade: I'm glad I broke my neck getting here. I'm waiting for paternity results.",
        "Alison: I know. Dr. Leigh wanted me to go over the findings with you.",
        "Jade: You mean you have them?",
        "Alison: Right here. Are you ready for the verdict?",
        "Jade: Oh wait.",
        "Alison: Well, you'd rather wait for the doctor?",
        "Jade: No, for Derek. I mean, it was his idea to get this test. I think we should see the results together.",
        "Alison: But Derek already knows what the results are.",
        "Jade: Oh, how could he?",
        "Alison: Uh, he was here earlier.",
        "Jade: He left?",
        "Bonnie: Why would he do that?",
        "Jade: Well, I guess we'll know when we get the results. What are you waiting for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Tom, listen to me. I shouldn't have punched him, but it doesn't change the facts. I have custody because that's what my wife wanted. I don't want Craig anywhere my son, end of story. No, no, no, I don't want to hear that, Tom. Find a way.",
        "Emily: Sounds like bad news.",
        "Dusty: Good guess.",
        "Emily: Well, sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop. But you are in my office, at my desk --",
        "Dusty: Sorry. I needed a quiet place to make the call.",
        "Emily: Can't seem to catch a break, can you?",
        "Dusty: Not lately, no.",
        "Emily: If you ask me, it seems to be a lot longer than that. Pretty much ever since you came back to Oakdale. Maybe that was your first mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Are you sure I can't do anything to help?",
        "Emma: No, you just take care of that little angel. A little angel just like your mama was.",
        "Meg: I thought you always said I cried non-stop for the entire first year of my life.",
        "Emma: Well, you did. But that doesn't mean you weren't my little angel. I think she's getting hungry. Should I heat up a little bottle for her?",
        "Meg: I don't know. She looks pretty content.",
        "Emma: Yes, that's because she knows she's loved. Right, little creature --",
        "Meg: She has plenty of that.",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Emma: What -- what do you want?",
        "Paul: May I come in?",
        "Emma: No.",
        "Paul: I just want to see my little girl.",
        "Emma: Well, you are not welcomed here.",
        "Meg: Mama, its okay. Let him in.",
        "Emma: Just why -- why would you want him near you or your baby?",
        "Paul: Eliza's my baby, too.",
        "Meg: Paul's right. He has the right to see his daughter. Please, Mama, let him in.",
        "Emma: You're making a big mistake.",
        "Meg: What did you do?",
        "Paul: I bought a couple of things for my beautiful girl. Where is she --",
        "Emma: Doesn't need things. She needs peace and quiet.",
        "Paul: Hi, Sweetie. Hey. She's bigger than last time I saw her.",
        "Meg: Do you hear that? Daddy thinks you've grown. What?",
        "Paul: Nothing.",
        "Emma: It's almost her nap time. Let me put her down.",
        "Meg: I'll put her down later.",
        "Paul: I think it's going to snow tomorrow, so I was hoping I could, you know, bring her on her first sleigh ride, if that's okay with your mom.",
        "Emma: In this cold?",
        "Meg: We'll see.",
        "Paul: See, and I thought of that, so I got this for her to wear --",
        "Meg: That's gorgeous --",
        "Paul: If you say it's okay and this goes with them. You should see these.",
        "Meg: Oh, Mama, you have to see this.",
        "Emma: The closet's already overstuffed.",
        "Paul: I hope you don't mind. How cute is this?",
        "Meg: That's perfect.",
        "Paul: All right. And since every little girl should have a puppy --",
        "Meg: That's bigger than she is.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and probably easier to take care of than a real one.",
        "Emma: Listen, real or not, it doesn't belong on my table. Neither do all those bags.",
        "Meg: Here, I'll clear the table. I'll bring those bags upstairs. You take care of her.",
        "Paul: Okay, all right, I'll take care of her.",
        "Emma: Yes, I will, too.",
        "Paul: Oh, its okay, it's okay. It's okay. Look at you. You look like your mama. Oh, little angel --",
        "Emma: Just give me that child. Give me that child now.",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I don't blame you for wishing I never came back. And I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know.",
        "Dusty: Do you?",
        "Emily: You know what? Don't worry about me. Sounds like you got enough of your own problems battling Craig Montgomery.",
        "Dusty: How do you know that?",
        "Emily: I run a newspaper, Dusty. I got a source down at Oakdale P.D. they let me know whenever a person of interest is brought in.",
        "Dusty: Am I someone of interest?",
        "Emily: I'm really surprised that Craig didn't press charges against you.",
        "Dusty: I'm not. He got what he wanted.",
        "Emily: Really? My sources tell me he got a left to the jaw.",
        "Dusty: That's right. But he actually got the better of me. Which means he's closer in taking away my son.",
        "Emily: What? There's not a court in this country that's going to grant Craig Montgomery custody of your son.",
        "Dusty: I don't know. Craig's come up with some pretty interesting strategies.",
        "Emily: Like what? Like what? Tell me. Maybe I can help.",
        "Dusty: I'll handle it.",
        "Emily: All right. Okay, I know -- I know I wasn't much help to you when you were in trouble for shooting Paul --",
        "Dusty: That's okay. Its better you not get involved.",
        "Emily: Will you just listen to me? No matter what has happened between us, I know how much your son means to you. I also know what it feels like when someone is threatening to take away your son.",
        "Dusty: I guess you do.",
        "Emily: So please, if there's something I can do to keep that from happening, just let me give it a shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Well, the test provides a 100% certainty of exclusion. It also gives a 99.9% probability of inclusion --",
        "Jade: Can you just cut to the chase? Is Derek my father or isn't he?",
        "Alison: Yes. He is.",
        "Bonnie: Wow.",
        "Jade: I can't believe it.",
        "Bonnie: I knew there was a possibility, but I still can't believe that Derek's a father.",
        "Jade: I can't believe he's mine. Well, I guess since he's nowhere to be seen, I don't have to ask what his reaction was.",
        "Alison: I think it was just -- I think it was a lot to take in.",
        "Jade: Yeah, that's a nice way of saying he wasn't happy.",
        "Bonnie: Jade, please, don't go assuming things.",
        "Jade: It doesn't matter to me.",
        "Bonnie: No, I'm pretty sure that the reason he left had nothing to do with you.",
        "Jade: Look, I don't care. He's the one that wanted to take the stupid test. If he's not happy with the results, that's his problem.",
        "Bonnie: You don't know how he feels. Look, look stay here, please. I will be back, hopefully, with Derek.",
        "Alison: He should've stayed.",
        "Jade: It doesn't matter.",
        "Alison: He's your father.",
        "Jade: And clearly doesn't want to be. Look, I didn't have a father before, I don't need one now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You can't sit here. Jade's waiting for you.",
        "Derek: Thanks for the update.",
        "Casey: You don't want to find out if you're a dad?",
        "Derek: I already know.",
        "Casey: You do? Well, what --",
        "Derek: What's it to you?",
        "Casey: I just feel kind of responsible after saving her life.",
        "Derek: That you feel responsible.",
        "Casey: Yeah, you should too, especially now.",
        "Derek: Just like that, huh? A test turns out positive and suddenly I'm supposed to just fall in line.",
        "Casey: Whoa, you are her dad?",
        "Derek: Whatever that means.",
        "Casey: Well, that means you should be there for her.",
        "Derek: Believe me, I'm the last thing she needs right now.",
        "Casey: Jade might want you to think that, but I just ran into her at the hospital. And as much as she's trying to hide it, she's a wreck. The least you can do after all these years is be there for her now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: I'm warning you, Paul. Give me the child. Give me the child.",
        "Paul: Do you really think I'm going -- what exactly do you think I'm going to do?",
        "Emma: I don't know what you're going to do. You say one thing and then you do another, and then you claim you forget doing it.",
        "Paul: I'm better now.",
        "Emma: So you say.",
        "Paul: I would never hurt her. I love her.",
        "Emma: You loved Meg, too. Now, hand her over. Give her to me --",
        "Meg: Mama, stop. Paul can hold Eliza. I don't have a problem with that.",
        "Emma: Fine. Fine, do as you like.",
        "Paul: Thank you. Thanks a lot.",
        "Meg: You're welcome. Hey --",
        "Paul: I know we agreed to supervised visits, but this is a bit much, don't you think?",
        "Meg: Well, you can't blame her for being cautious.",
        "Paul: It's okay. Cautious is one thing. She's kind of like a swat team. So you don't think I would never hurt her, do you?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: Oh, oh --",
        "Emma: She can't drink out of that bottle now. Give her to me.",
        "Meg: It's okay.",
        "Paul: Four --",
        "Meg: Do you know how many bottles I've dropped --",
        "Paul: Um, look, this is kind of hard. Maybe we can just do this at my house.",
        "Emma: If that child leaves this house, over my dead body!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I cannot believe Craig thinks marrying Carly Tenney is going to help him get custody. Carly Tenney?",
        "Dusty: How do I compete with that?",
        "Emily: Well, come on -- it's not like you're some swinging single, you know, bachelor, hitting the bar scene --",
        "Dusty: I live in a hotel. I order room service every night. I don't know if that's what a judge wants to hear.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, maybe not. But why can't two play at Craig's game?",
        "Dusty: What do you mean?",
        "Emily: Well, if getting married could work for Craig, why couldn't it work for you?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it's great, but who do I marry?",
        "Emily: How about me?",
        "Dusty: You're kidding, right?",
        "Emily: No, actually, I wasn't.",
        "Dusty: Why would I let you turn your life upside down for a silly cause like nailing Craig?",
        "Emily: Well, it's not like I got a lot going on at the moment, at least not on the personal front. And you know how much I love kids. It would be fun to help raise a little boy again. What? Daniel's so big. I barely get to hug him anymore.",
        "Dusty: This is too crazy.",
        "Emily: Why? I got a lot of regrets in my life, you already know that. But my biggest one was not stopping Paul and keeping Johnny away from Jennifer.",
        "Dusty: That's history.",
        "Emily: Now, well, you know what? Not a day goes by that I don't think how different everyone's lives would have been if I had tried to stop him. Please. Honestly, I had always wished that I could make it up to Jennifer somehow. But if you let me help you hold on to Johnny, that could be as close as I could get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mama, look, I know you think you're trying to help.",
        "Emma: Meg, he just got out of a psychiatric ward. And he has proven unstable more than one occasion --",
        "Paul: I'm right here and I can hear you. And the doctors wouldn't let me out of the hospital if I was a danger to anybody. I'm just trying to get to know my little girl. And it's really hard if you're shooting daggers at me.",
        "Emma: Have you forgotten what he's put you through? How he has lied to you time and time again?",
        "Meg: No! But dwelling on it isn't doing anyone any good, least of all Eliza. Look, can you please just let me handle this my way, please?",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Meg: You're not taking her out alone.",
        "Paul: Okay, so come with me. Your mama will be fine. She can go upstairs and stick needles in her Paul Ryan voodoo doll.",
        "Meg: Don't you think you deserve it?",
        "Paul: Yeah, maybe. But it's like you said, no reason for Eliza to be punished for my mistakes.",
        "Meg: I'll put her coat on. I will need some help putting the car seat in the car.",
        "Paul: Okay, I'll go warm up the car --",
        "Meg: Oh, come here, Sweetie. Oh, there you go. Come here, Angel.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Emma: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Meg, if I overreacted. I'm glad he's gone. What are you doing?",
        "Meg: Eliza and I are going to Fairwinds.",
        "Emma: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Meg: He is a father who would like a relationship with his daughter. And I promised him that I wouldn't get in the way.",
        "Emma: That is not all he wants and you know it.",
        "Meg: Will you give me a little bit more credit? I know what you think, but Paul can't get to me anymore.",
        "Emma: Oh, Meggie, he already has.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Whoa, are you okay?",
        "Bonnie: Yes, no -- no, I'm not actually because I told Jade to wait here for me and I have been looking for her everywhere.",
        "Casey: Oh, did she get the test results? I ran into her earlier. She said she was coming here.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, she got the results.",
        "Casey: Yeah, so how did she react to finding out that Derek was her dad?",
        "Bonnie: Well, she pretended like she didn't care, but that probably because Derek never even -- wait a minute. Wait a minute. How do you know that Derek's her dad?",
        "Casey: He told me.",
        "Bonnie: You saw him?",
        "Casey: Yeah, in the park.",
        "Bonnie: Well, how was he?",
        "Casey: Not great, especially after I asked him why he wasn't here with Jade.",
        "Bonnie: Well, what did he say?",
        "Casey: Just that he's the last thing she needed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Jade? Are you okay?",
        "Jade: I hate this time of year. It's like one bad cold after the other. Do you have a tissue?",
        "Alison: Yeah, uh, one left.",
        "Jade: Thanks.",
        "Alison: You know, it's okay to be upset.",
        "Jade: I told you already I'm fine.",
        "Alison: Is that why you're hiding in the stairwell crying? You know, Derek is the one with the problem, not you.",
        "Jade: Yeah, and what would that problem be?",
        "Alison: The fact that he didn't stick around?",
        "Jade: You think I care about that?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do.",
        "Jade: You don't know anything about it.",
        "Alison: Actually, I do. And after hundreds of hours of therapy and about a year and a half worth of AA meetings, I'm finally starting to get a handle on what you're facing right now.",
        "Jade: And what's that?",
        "Alison: Your father's rejection.",
        "Jade: I don't even know him.",
        "Alison: I didn't even know my dad either, but that didn't make it hurt any less when I realized he didn't even want to know me. Luckily, I found a way to turn it all around. So can you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I took you for a lot of things but never a coward.",
        "Derek: I really don't want to do this.",
        "Bonnie: Why didn't you stay at the hospital?",
        "Derek: I couldn't deal with it.",
        "Bonnie: So you left Jade to deal with it alone? I mean, haven't you been absent enough from her life?",
        "Derek: I didn't even know she existed until a month ago.",
        "Bonnie: Now what? You wish you didn't know?",
        "Derek: No, no, I didn't say that.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, didn't have to.",
        "Derek: Can I please just deal with this in my own way?",
        "Bonnie: Well, you see, the problem is, this isn't all about you. Jade may act like she's an adult, but she's just a kid. Your kid.",
        "Derek: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Bonnie: Then why did you want to take the test if you didn't care enough about her to want to face the truth together?",
        "Derek: I'd just been shot. My life was on the line.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, bull! You wanted it because you realized that you could really care for Jade. And now you're just running scared because you do not think that you are enough for her.",
        "Derek: I know that I'm not enough! And now she'll know it and realize that she was better off not having a father at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Not bad.",
        "Paul: Hey, you didn't think I had it in me, did you? Being in love can change a guy.",
        "Meg: Changing a diaper is one thing. Getting her to take a nap, now that's the real challenge.",
        "Paul: Piece of cake.",
        "Meg: Yeah, says the guy who hasn't been pulling his hair out, trying to get her to sleep for more than 20 minutes at a time.",
        "Paul: It would have been my pleasure to be there for that. Since I wasn't, maybe I can make it up to you.",
        "Meg: Okay, be my guest.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Meg: So, come here, Sweetie. Come here, Angel. Don't tell me that was sitting in the attic.",
        "Paul: No, no, this -- I built this. I bought it cause I wanted to have something of hers in my home. I hope you don't mind.",
        "Meg: Not at all.",
        "Paul: Okay. Come here. All right.",

        "Jade: So you're perfectly fine knowing your dad's out there and what's nothing to do with you?",

They all waited in the car while want to intrude on our happy father-daughter reunion. Only there wasn't anything happy about it. He actually seemed ticked off that I interrupted his new life with his new family. It was like I was selling something and he just wasn't interested.",
