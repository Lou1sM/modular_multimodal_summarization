        "Luke: Look, he can't be far. I'll take -- finally. I'm sorry. I -- I didn't -- I did not mean for it to come out that way. It's just we didn't know where you were.",
        "Reid: Even hostages have to eat, Mr. Snyder. I was down in the cafeteria consuming something that called itself \"Lunch.\" But there's nothing like those orange plastic trays to remind you of botulism.",
        "Luke: Have you had a chance to look at Noah's file?",
        "Reid: I did.",
        "Noah: So? What happens next?",
        "Reid: Since Mr. Snyder dragged me here to okay, Illinois -- which is, by the way, the most self-satisfied white-bread community I have ever seen and home of the world's most unappealing grilled-cheese sandwich --",
        "Luke: Okay, okay. We get it. You don't like it here. What does that mean for Noah?",
        "Reid: It means let's do this now and get it over with. It's time to make a blind man see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Thanks for taking the time to see me, Bob.",
        "Bob: You have my ear whenever you want it. What can I do for you?",
        "Dusty: I need the best blood-cancer specialist in New York City. I need a letter of introduction so I don't waste time. Tomorrow, if possible.",
        "Bob: Did Johnny's cancer come back?",
        "Dusty: No, no. This is for Liberty. I promised her mother I'd find the best oncologist. And no offense to Memorial, but --",
        "Bob: You want a second opinion.",
        "Dusty: Yes. Wouldn't you?",
        "Bob: Oh, absolutely. I mean, the major hospitals in major cities have all the state-of-the-art-equipment, clinical trials. They have up-to-date expertise. It would be arrogant of me to deny my patients care that we can't give them here.",
        "Dusty: Thanks. You know someone?",
        "Bob: Yes I do, and I'll make a call. If you don't mind my asking, what does, uh -- what does Janet Snyder's daughter have to do with you?",
        "Dusty: Well, she works for me. She's an excellent employee, and we're friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, thank God you're home. I need you so much right now.",
        "Jack: Janet, what -- what's wrong? You said something about Liberty.",
        "Janet: She's sick.",
        "Jack: Sick?",
        "Janet: She has cancer -- leukemia. I don't know how to handle this by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly remembering]",
        "Jack: We belong together, Carly, forever.",
        "Carly: You can never leave me again.",
        "Jack: Ah, you're right. I can never leave you again.",
        "Carly: Okay. You -- you finish things with Janet if you're sure that's what you want.",
        "Jack: Yes. I will talk to Janet then --",
        "Carly: Then you come back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Craig: Oh, don't look so thrilled.",
        "Carly: What do you want, Craig? I'm busy.",
        "Craig: Oh, look. Did you get your couch back? Does that mean Jack's gone?",
        "Carly: For the moment.",
        "Craig: Good. I wanted to talk to you in private.",
        "Carly: If this is about you and me --",
        "Craig: Relax, relax. It's a business opportunity, not a marriage proposal. I got a call this morning from one of the Midday Sun investors.",
        "Carly: Oh no, please. Please, save your breath, okay? 'Cause I'm not interested in vodka or water or clubs anymore.",
        "Craig: Well, be that as it may, we made an awfully good return on our investment.",
        "Carly: I don't care about the money. From now on, I have to follow my heart.",
        "Craig: What does that have to do with business? Unless we're not talking about business. What's going on with you, Carly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Liberty has leukemia? I didn't even know she was sick.",
        "Janet: She wasn't. We found out by accident. The day that she and Parker got lost in Michigan -- do you remember? They let Parker go home from the hospital, like right away. But they kept Liberty there?",
        "Jack: Yeah, but that was because of exposure, right? Because she used her shirt to cover the cut on Parker's leg.",
        "Janet: She found a bruise that she couldn't explain, and so the doctors did more tests. And they -- they found out that her white blood cell count was too low or -- or too high. And her red cell count was out of whack. I don't know. I -- the bottom line is, she has cancer, Jack.",
        "Jack: But this -- this was days ago. Why -- why are you just telling me this now?",
        "Janet: I didn't know how. And I couldn't find you.",
        "Jack: Wow. I wish I knew this was going on.",
        "Janet: Well, you know now.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'm -- I'm sorry. Is -- is there anything I can do? Tell me what I can do.",
        "Janet: Can you -- I mean, I know that you and I have been -- things just --",
        "Jack: Yeah, Janet, please. You can -- you can ask me anything.",
        "Janet: I need your help, Jack. My little girl's sick, and she needs me. And I want to be there for her, but I don't know how. I am so scared. She needs me, but I -- I just -- I just want to run and hide.",
        "Jack: You don't have to go through this alone. I'm here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Wait. You want to operate on Noah today?",
        "Reid: I want to be drinking a beer back in Texas, but I'm prepared to operate.",
        "Luke: But he just had lunch. You -- you can't eat and then go under anesthesia.",
        "Reid: Really? I hadn't heard that.",
        "Luke: So what, you're just going to walk in there and perform brain surgery?",
        "Reid: Why not?",
        "Luke: Well, do you know anyone here?",
        "Reid: You mean besides you?",
        "Luke: Look, is this even safe?",
        "Reid: Look, I'm not crazy about the idea of working with a new staff in a backwards operating room, but a brain is a brain. I'm willing to take a crack at it if you are, Noah.",
        "Luke: And you really think that you're going to help him?",
        "Reid: Isn't that why you kidnapped me?",
        "Luke: He's not ready.",
        "Noah: Luke, I can speak for myself. Dr. Oliver, I'm ready. I've been ready since the day I had my accident.",
        "Reid: You might want to pass that message along.",
        "Noah: Look, I told you, I'm calling the shots. If you want to do the surgery today, great. Let's do it. The sooner, the better.",
        "Reid: Right on. You. You look important.",
        "Bob: Excuse me?",
        "Reid: If there's such a thing as an operating room in this hospital, I need one now. Along with your top neuro team, a Midas, a b-one foot plate, and an IGS system, which I pray to God is not considered an antique.",
        "Bob: Who are you? What are you doing in my hospital?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't want to be in business with you, Craig. It doesn't interest me.",
        "Craig: So what are you going to do?",
        "Carly: You must know. I'm going to go back into the fashion business.",
        "Craig: Ah. When did that happen?",
        "Carly: Detroit.",
        "Craig: Between the baton-throwing and the lip-syncing?",
        "Carly: I was thinking about helping Liberty put together her portfolio for F.I.T. Then I realized how much I missed it -- looking at sketches, choosing fabrics. I really love it -- designing clothes, watching them come to life. It's what I want to do. Anything else is just a paycheck.",
        "Craig: Well, I think it's a great idea. You know, I still have all the corporate paperwork from Monte Carlo.",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Carly: Oh, forget it.",
        "Craig: Well, come on. We had a good time then, and we made a lot of money.",
        "Carly: It's not going to happen, okay? My life is changing in a big way.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Hey, just let me get your money, okay?",
        "Craig: I'll take that.",
        "Pizza guy: Thanks. Cold afternoon, huh?",
        "Craig: Yeah. Getting colder by the minute.",
        "Carly: All right. There you go. And keep the change.",
        "Pizza guy: Thanks, Lady.",
        "Craig: What was that you were saying about one day at a time?",
        "Carly: Beer's not mine.",
        "Craig: I thought you didn't keep alcohol in the house?",
        "Carly: I couldn't handle it before, but I -- I'm stronger now.",
        "Craig: Until you're not. Isn't that what happens? Something triggers you, you lose control, and suddenly you're back at day one?",
        "Carly: It's fine, and it's none of your business.",
        "Craig: Wait a minute. Look at this setup. Carly, you're -- you're not?",
        "Carly: You -- you need to leave.",
        "Craig: You are! You're waiting for Jack! Oh, Carly, you've got to be kidding me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I'm doing the best I can here, Jack. I'm trying to stay positive for Liberty, because I know that that's what she needs to fight this. But deep down inside, I am scared to death.",
        "Jack: No, I know.",
        "Janet: I can't lose my little girl, Jack.",
        "Jack: And I know that.",
        "Janet: I can't lose her.",
        "Jack: I'm here.",
        "Janet: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Janet: What do you mean when you say you're here?",
        "Jack: Like I told you, I'm not going to let you go through this alone. Janet, I'll go to treatments. I'll go to treatments. I'll talk to doctors, do research. I don't know, Janet. I guess what -- whatever needs to be done. You can count on me.",
        "Janet: Why? Because you feel sorry for me?",
        "Jack: What? No.",
        "Janet: Because if that's the case, then you can turn around and walk out that door because I don't need your pity, Jack. And I don't need a best friend that I can lean on. What I need right now is my husband.",
        "Jack: I don't feel sorry for you. You can handle this. I know that, even if you don't.",
        "Janet: Answer the question. What are we to each other?",
        "Jack: I'm your husband. I'm here as your husband. We're in this together.",
        "Janet: Oh, oh, thank God. Oh, I'm so sorry I didn't tell you about Liberty before. I just -- I didn't want you to come back for the wrong reasons.",
        "Jack: No, no. That wouldn't be fair to you.",
        "Janet: So are you coming home?",
        "Jack: We're a family. We need to stick together.",
        "Janet: For real, like the way we were?",
        "Jack: Janet, you're my wife. I'm Liberty's uncle, her stepfather.",
        "Janet: I was starting to believe this wasn't possible.",
        "Jack: When was the last time you slept, Honey?",
        "Janet: Oh!",
        "Jack: Huh? Huh?",
        "Janet: I don't know. I got a couple hours of sleep on Liberty's chair in her bedroom, but I don't -- I don't remember.",
        "Jack: Okay. Come on. Go, go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dr. Hughes, this is Dr. Reid Oliver. He's the neurologist from Dallas who's coming to see Noah. Um, Bob is the chief of staff here.",
        "Reid: And naturally, you're on a first-name basis.",
        "Bob: Oh, Dr. Oliver, yes. Now I remember. I, uh, signed a waiver giving you temporary privileges. But I had no idea that you were going to perform surgery, especially not today.",
        "Reid: Well -- now you do. Did you sign the consent yet?",
        "Noah: No. No one gave it to me.",
        "Luke: I have it here.",
        "Noah: Give -- give it here, Luke.",
        "Luke: You need to think about this first, Noah.",
        "Noah: I want my sight back. He can make that happen. What's there to think about?",
        "Luke: I don't know, like, um -- like do you have a living will?",
        "Reid: There's a directive attached to the surgical consent. Read it to him.",
        "Luke: Look, I understand that this doesn't matter to you, but he's about to undergo a huge operation. I don't want you pressuring him with the time constraints.",
        "Reid: Wow. You were in such a rush when you dragged me out here.",
        "Noah: It is not his decision to make. It's mine.",
        "Reid: Great. So are we going to do this, or has this all been a complete waste of time?",
        "Bob: Dr. Oliver, a word with you in private?",
        "Reid: Is the operating room booked?",
        "Bob: Dr. Oliver, you're asking this young man to make a decision that will affect the rest of his life.",
        "Reid: Yeah, I'm the one doing the asking.",
        "Bob: And there's no guarantee that your procedure will work, and there is a significant chance that it could make his condition worse.",
        "Reid: He's already blind. How much worse could it get?",
        "Bob: Look, Doctor, maybe your chief in Dallas puts up with your arrogance because you're good with a scalpel --",
        "Reid: I'm the best, actually.",
        "Bob: But this is my hospital, and I'm not about to sign off on this surgery unless I'm satisfied that Noah knows what to expect when he wakes up.",
        "Reid: Because his boyfriend is a family friend, or maybe a donor?",
        "Bob: The patient and his partner are under-informed. They're scared to death, and I don't blame them.",
        "Reid: You really think a litany of worst-case scenarios is going to make him feel any better?",
        "Bob: My hospital, my rules. Now, you go back in there and reassure your patient. And then if you get him to sign a consent, you bring it to me, and my staff will do everything they can to assist you.",
        "Luke: He's back.",
        "Reid: Noah, I'm not going to lie to you about this surgery. There are serious risks.",
        "Noah: Like death?",
        "Reid: Yes. That's a possibility. But, Noah, you need this surgery if you're ever going to see again. Obviously, I can't guarantee the results of the surgery, but if you want your vision back, I'm the best man for the job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: A lot's happened since you left. And I know that things won't go back to being the way they were. But, I want you to know that I'm glad you're home.",
        "Jack: So am I. So you just -- you close your eyes, and we'll talk later, okay?",
        "Janet: What about Carly?",
        "Jack: Don't -- don't worry about Carly. Just, uh -- just focus all your energies on helping Liberty get well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Carly -- Carly, listen to me. Going back to Jack is the worst possible thing you could do for yourself right now.",
        "Carly: My relationship with Jack is none of your business.",
        "Craig: So it is true.",
        "Carly: Damn it.",
        "Craig: I should have known it by the way Jack was behaving at Katie's goodbye and -- and the couch. Nobody sleeps on that thing unless they're hoping for an upgrade.",
        "Carly: You're disgusting.",
        "Craig: And I'm right. [Craig sighs] Carly, are you sure this is what you want after so many times? I mean, no matter how many times you try, your relationship with Jack always ends in disaster.",
        "Carly: We've learned from our mistakes.",
        "Craig: And I've said that a few times myself. The problem is there are always bigger and newer mistakes to make, and people like you and me, we can't help but make them.",
        "Carly: You keep telling everybody that you've changed. Why can't I?",
        "Craig: Let me ask you something. Does it bother you even a little bit that Jack is married to someone else?",
        "Carly: Of course it does!",
        "Craig: But you two crazy kids just can't stay away from each other. Is that it?",
        "Carly: We're not going to -- we're not going to do anything until it's over between Janet and Jack.",
        "Craig: But that's not going to stop you, is it? 'Cause Carly wants Jack. What Carly wants, Carly always gets.",
        "Carly: You need to leave, now.",
        "Jack: Carly -- what are you doing here, Craig?",
        "Carly: He was just leaving.",
        "Craig: I wish you both the best.",
        "Carly: Was it awful? Did Janet understand? Did she agree that your marriage is over? You didn't tell her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: There's nothing more that anybody can tell you about this procedure. You either trust me or you don't.",
        "Noah: I trust you. I want the surgery.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but you don't have to do it today, Noah.",
        "Noah: I -- I want to do this now. I -- I've got to do this to get my life back.",
        "Luke: But you have your life.",
        "Noah: I have a life. It's not mine. So please, will you -- will you just help me sign the consent forms?",
        "Reid: Okay. Let's do this. It is signed.",
        "Bob: Thank you.",
        "Reid: Now I need an O.R. and a full staff, your best people. It would help if they'd been to medical schools sometime within the last 30 years.",
        "Bob: My chief of neurology is bringing his team in. Uh, he's aware of you and would like to observe.",
        "Reid: As long as it's clear to everyone that I'm in charge of the O.R. No back-seat driving.",
        "Bob: Won't be a problem.",
        "Reid: Better not be.",
        "Kim: What an ego. I wouldn't let that guy anywhere near me, even if my life depended on it.",
        "Bob: Yes, you would. He is unbearable, but I'm told he's a genius. Besides, you'd be sedated.",
        "Luke: How scared are you?",
        "Noah: Very. Not as scared as I am of being blind the rest of my life.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm not going to let that happen. You believe me, don't you?",
        "Noah: I'm starting to.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Reid: Okay, Noah. Tell your boyfriend you'll see him later, 'cause you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Little early for a bender, isn't it?",
        "Craig: Not really.",
        "Dusty: Where's Johnny?",
        "Craig: He's at school. Then he has an afternoon play date. So back off, okay?",
        "Dusty: You're in a bad mood.",
        "Craig: Well, thank you, Dusty, for stating the obvious. Such an underappreciated talent. Yes, I am in a foul mood. I just had a head-on collision with an immovable force otherwise known as Carly and Jack. To Carjack!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I can't do this. I thought I could.",
        "Carly: You changed your mind.",
        "Jack: It's -- it's not that easy.",
        "Carly: Did something happen? Jack, I know we've been here before, and we've always crashed and burned. But this time, it feels different. You said that -- that it feels different. And I'm different. I've changed. Rehab changed me. I'm not going to throw our life away again, Jack.",
        "Jack: I believe you.",
        "Carly: You've changed. You realize that the life that you had here, no matter how complicated, it's what you want.",
        "Jack: I know that.",
        "Carly: The only thing that's the same is that we still love each other. Doesn't that mean anything? I'm not going to let you down again, Jack.",
        "Jack: Carly, please. Just -- it's not you, or us. It's Liberty. She's sick. She has leukemia.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God. No, no. She was just here. She's fine.",
        "Jack: No, she's not. She has cancer. First the baby, then Brad and now -- no. This, it's -- it's -- it's too much, and, uh, Janet --",
        "Carly: I can't imagine.",
        "Jack: She and Liberty are all alone. If Brad were alive, he -- he'd look out for his little girl. But he can't, and it's my fault that he's not here when they need him most. I hate this.",
        "Carly: She asked you to come home.",
        "Jack: Yes. Janet needs me. Liberty's all she has.",
        "Carly: And you said yes.",
        "Jack: Carly, I have to. Carly -- I took a vow, for better or for worse, in sickness --",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know. I've been promised that a time or two myself.",
        "Jack: Carly -- I can't walk out on her now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Luke, listen, this surgery's going to take hours. Why don't you get out of here, get something to eat?",
        "Luke: I'm not really hungry.",
        "Bob: Well, take a walk with us.",
        "Kim: Yes.",
        "Bob: I mean, the hospital will let us know if there's any news.",
        "Luke: Okay. But only for a couple of minutes.",
        "Bob: Good.",
        "Luke: What are you doing out here already?",
        "Reid: I'm sorry. I've got bad news. I'm not going to operate.",
        "Bob: Why not?",
        "Reid: I got back Noah's latest scans as I was scrubbing in. There's a lot more vascular involvement than I initially thought.",
        "Luke: What -- what does that mean?",
        "Reid: If Noah ever wants to see again, he's going to need multiple surgeries and I.V. drug therapy in between.",
        "Luke: So?",
        "Reid: So that's a long-term commitment. This is supposed to be a one-night stand. Sorry. I'll have my office bill you for the day's work.",
        "Luke: But you didn't do anything.",
        "Reid: You didn't ask me to come here, Mr. Snyder. You forced me to. My time is extremely valuable. Just ask any of my patients who are waiting for me back in Dallas. And God help you if one of them doesn't make it because I've been wasting my time here.",
        "Bob: Dr. Oliver --",
        "Reid: I don't work for you.",
        "Luke: Look, you can't go.",

        "Kim: Well, Sweetheart, you've done everything you could possibly do. The only thing left is for you to tell him the truth.",
        "Bob: Yeah, that's right. Listen, we're going to go out for a while, and when we get back, we'll figure out what our next step is.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. It's just that Noah was really expecting to wake up from the surgery and be able to see. And -- he's going to be devastated, and I -- I don't know what to do.",
        "Kim: Well, hearing bad news is never pleasant, but don't you think he might be able to handle it a little better coming from you?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Reid: Could you give me a car back to the airport?",
        "Luke: You're not going anywhere until you help Noah.",
        "Reid: I'm not a magician, Mr. Snyder. Even if I were, I'd only give Noah a 20% chance of getting off the table. He needs months of surgery, not a drive-by. I came, I saw, I folded. Now I'm leaving.",
        "Luke: Well, you got to find your own way back. You're not using the Grimaldi jet.",
        "Reid: Big shock. You didn't get what you wanted from me. Now you're taking your toys, and you're going home. Have a nice life.",

        "Dusty: Hey, it's me. Listen. Cancel all my business with Worldwide until I say so. I want you to call the airline back and book another ticket to New York. I'm going with Mrs. Snyder and Liberty. Don't worry about a room. I'll figure that out when I get there.",

        "Janet: She's okay.",
        "Dusty: I've been thinking about you. I'd like to help you if I can.",
        "Janet: You did. You told me to tell Jack about Liberty, and I did, and he came home.",
        "Dusty: When?",
        "Janet: A little while ago. He said that he doesn't want me going through this by myself.",

        "Craig: If she gave me half a chance. You know, I -- I would do anything to have someone look at me the way she looks at you. I would kill to have that kind of love. But what do you do? You kick her teeth in. You break her heart over and over again. You know, she keeps coming back for more. So tell me, what is it, Jack? What is it you do to her that nobody else can seem to do?",

        "Luke: No, no. That's not it. Look, it's not over. It's far from it.",

        "Luke: Look, Dr. Oliver, all I'm asking is that you go back in there and explain to us what we can do to get Noah better. We can figure it out from there. We can go down to Dallas, if that makes it easier. We can get a place down there.",
        "Reid: Look, I don't know how to make this clear to you. I'm not taking your boyfriend's case. I'm done. So quit ordering me around like I'm one of your servants. I don't need your money. It doesn't impress me.",

I have people waiting for me back in Dallas, people that I actually want to help. So if you're not going to drive me, I'm going to drive myself. You can pick up your car at the airport.
