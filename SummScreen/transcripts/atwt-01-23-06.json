        "Holden talks to Jack about his concern over Luke and his friend Kevin. After talking, Holden's uneasiness is alleviated by Jack. They assume that Luke feels pressure about dating due to his parents love story. He probably feels pressured to live up to that. Happily, Holden heads home to ask Luke if he wants to go to the Sox' spring training for a couple days? An ecstatic Luke tells him yes. Lily wonders if he wants to invite Kevin? Both Luke and Holden look uneasy, as Luke tells her he would rather go with just his dad. Kevin later persuades Luke to leave the house and go drinking with him for their own private party. Meg almost gets caught with the gun Emily used to shoot Paul, and Paul almost gets caught looking for Meg, but they are saved when another officer arrives saying they found Paul's car in the river. Paul was worried about her, and that is why he came looking for her, but Meg is worried about his well-being. Paul takes the gun, wipes off Emily's and places his own fingerprints on the gun. He hopes the police will deduce from the evidence that he killed himself. Meg and Paul continue to unwittingly become closer as they survive together. Mike and Katie find Carly and Nick on the floor together. Carly explains she fell after she twisted her ankle. Katie corners Nick after Mike leaves to go bring Carly her scarf. Katie tells Nick to lay off of Carly; she is in love with Jack. Nick tries to blow her off with jokes, but Katie is concerned with his persistence. Carly dodges Jack's questions about how and where she got hurt. She tells him Mike helped her. Mike returns Carly's scarf to Jack and tells him laughingly how he found Nick and Carly. Later, Jack confronts Carly as to why she neglected to tell him about Nick's role in when she fell? Kim finds Will and Gwen living outside near Java and takes them to the Lakeview for hot chocolate and something to eat. Lisa offers Gwen a room to stay at the Lakeview as her guest."

        "Kim: Excuse me? Excuse me? You've probably refused the city's offer for shelter tonight, but I wish you would reconsider. The temperature is really going down, and the wind chill is -- oh, my. [Gwen and Will are sleeping on a bench with a blanket covering them.]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Listen, it's going to swell up if you don't get some ice on it.",
        "Carly: Nick, I do have ice at home.",
        "Nick: You're not going to make it home.",
        "Carly: Wanna bet?",
        "Nick: Now that's more like it.",
        "Mike: Hey, Nick, listen up. I got some good news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: This isn't some news from Luke's doctor, is it?",
        "Holden: No, no, the transplant's fine. We were at the hospital, everything checked out.",
        "Jack: All right, well, if his health is okay --",
        "Holden: Yeah, his health is fine. And that definitely puts things in perspective. You don't wanna sweat the small stuff, right? Especially after everything we went through.",
        "Jack: What's the small stuff? Holden, hey, listen, it doesn't matter what it is. Big or small, it's still bothering you. So why don't you tell me what you're thinking?",
        "Holden: I don't know what I'm thinking. I don't know what I'm feeling.",
        "Jack: Well, that's why you're here. So just jump in. It doesn't matter where. We'll get around to it. Holden, you're his father. Whatever it is, you're gonna have to deal with it. And my experience is, sooner is better than later. So if you have any suspicions that your son may be doing something wrong, or is any kind of trouble, or you're worried about him, now would be the time to get it out on the table.",
        "Holden: Luke has this friend -- Kevin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You have no idea how good it feels to hold you and know that nothing hurts. But you could stand to put the five pounds back on.",
        "Luke: It's better for cross country.",
        "Lily: You'll always be my little boy, even though you're all grown up. I love you.",
        "Luke: I know, Mom.",
        "Lily: I'm going to go check on the girls. And I'm glad we talked.",
        "Luke: Me, too. [Phone rings] I'll get it. Hello, Snyder residence. Who's calling?",
        "Kevin: You are so freaking polite.",
        "Luke: Kevin. Hey, hey. How's that knot in your back?",
        "Kevin: Like new, thanks to you. So I've got a great idea. Can you go out?",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Kevin: So we can conjugate verbs. Come on, what do you think? So we can party, man. Just you and me. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay. All right, Meg. Unless the only reason you're not back is you can't find the gun in the dark. [Paul groans] Come on, Meg, get back here. Don't do this to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #2: Police. Get your hands up where I can see them.",
        "Meg: Please, don't shoot.",
        "Cop #2: Ma'am, put your hands above your head.",
        "Meg: Look, I was just taking a walk.",
        "Cop #2: What've you got behind your back? [Meg hides the gun behind her back.]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you, Mike. I just twisted my ankle, that's all.",
        "Mike: How'd that happen?",
        "Nick: Mrs. Snyder was in a bit of a hurry.",
        "Carly: And Detective Kasnoff wouldn't get out of my way. And I tripped over his big feet.",
        "Nick: Yeah, then I picked her up and I brought her over here. I just wanted to look at her ankle.",
        "Carly: We know what you wanted, Detective. I just wanted to get home.",
        "Nick: Well, then she pushed me down and wouldn't let me get back up.",
        "Carly: Please. I was just trying to push him out of the way. And my ankle gave way and I fell.",
        "Nick: Listen, I've had women fall for me. But twice in one day? That's got to be some kind of a record.",
        "Carly: Katie, did I hear Mike say that you and Mike have some good news?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Excellent news, actually. We're engaged.",
        "Carly: Ah! Oh, oh, I'm so happy for you. It's wonderful. Look at that ring.",
        "Katie: No kidding. Isn't it beautiful?",
        "Nick: Well, it's about time. If you hadn't snatched her up, I was gonna have to ask her out myself.",
        "Carly: Did you set a date, Katie?",
        "Katie: No, not yet.",
        "Mike: Sometime soon. We've been waiting a long time.",
        "Carly: Jack will be thrilled.",
        "Mike: Yeah, is he here? We didn't see him.",
        "Carly: No, you know, I thought he'd be here, too. We must have gotten our signals crossed. I really should get going. I should go home.",
        "Nick: You should take care of that ankle. Let a doctor look at it.",
        "Carly: I'm fine, thank you.",
        "Nick: Well, at least let me walk you to your car.",
        "Carly: I think you've done enough, Detective.",
        "Mike: I'll walk you out?",
        "Carly: Would you?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Nick: Well, take care of that ankle.",
        "Carly: Katie, call me if you need any help or anything, all right?",
        "Katie: Actually, I was wondering, maybe, if you might consider designing my dress?",
        "Carly: I would be honored. Call me.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Nick: What?",
        "Katie: Nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Kevin?",
        "Holden: Kevin is the kid that Luke got caught drinking with. They're friends from school. They play sports together, they spend a lot of time with each other outside of school.",
        "Jack: So, you think that Kevin and Luke are still drinking.",
        "Holden: It's possible. I just think that they spend too much time together. And I know that Luke needs friends, especially after everything he went through. That's why we have him in counseling.",
        "Jack: Have you talked to him?",
        "Holden: Me?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Holden: No. I haven't said anything because he told me that he stopped drinking. About Kevin? I wouldn't know what to say. I don't think I have a right to say anything.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about? Holden, if this kid is a bad influence on your son, you have every right to say something.",
        "Holden: I don't know that he is. I just don't know!",
        "Jack: Does he have a girlfriend?",
        "Holden: I don't know about that either. Jack, there's been so much going on lately.",
        "Jack: It could be his age. You know, he is at that age. When did you and Lily start hanging out?",
        "Holden: Maybe that's it.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Holden: I've been thinking that the problem is Kevin. But maybe it's me. It's a lot of pressure. Your parents meeting at about your age. At the ceremony, everybody was talking about Lily and me and what a great love story it's been. It's a lot to live up to. Then again, he knows all the problems that we've had. Maybe he's afraid to get involved with a girl.",
        "Jack: Could be it. I mean, after everything you and Lily have been through, yeah. But you can't put so much pressure on yourself. Maybe that's it, maybe you're putting too much pressure on yourself.",
        "Holden: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: Well, when Carly and I got back together and I moved in, everytime the kids would act out, I'd blame myself. And she would say that it was normal, that it was just kids being kids. But I couldn't help feeling every time they had a problem, it was because I spent so much time away from home. That it was my fault.",
        "Holden: Guilt.",
        "Jack: That's the word. Luke's a good kid. If he's having any worries or doubts about where he's going or who he is right now, that's just a teenager being a teenager. And he's gonna make mistakes, that's life. But you can trust him, Holden. He's going to be okay. You just need to focus on the family, and give it some time. You'll see.",
        "Holden: You know what, you're right, Jack. Lily and me, what we'll do is just let him know that we're okay. And hopefully, he'll figure out that romance is good, the girls are good, the marriage is good.",
        "Jack: Amen.",
        "Holden: Amen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I found my father's stash. It's the good stuff. Vodka, 100 proof. Your kidneys are gonna love me.",
        "Luke: No, I can't. My mom just gave me this big lecture on drinking.",
        "Kevin: So what else is new? My mother's a walking public service announcement. Your mom doesn't have to know, man. It's our secret.",
        "Luke: No, I can't. I gotta go.",
        "Kevin: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Luke, Luke, what's the problem?",
        "Luke: There's no problem. I just can't.",
        "Lily: Who was that?",
        "Luke: When?",
        "Lily: On the phone?",
        "Luke: Oh, nobody, just some kid from school asking about the history assignment.",
        "Lily: Okay. Look, Faith got an a-plus on her spelling test. Look. B-r-o-t-h- e-r. Brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #2: What're you hiding there?",
        "Meg: Nothing. It's just my backpack. See? I was just going hiking.",
        "Cop #2: In the middle of the night?",
        "Meg: What, a girl can't look at the stars?",
        "Cop #2: Well, that depends.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm staying at a cabin on top of the ridge. You can ask Detective Kasnoff if you don't believe me. Or my cousin, Jack Snyder.",
        "Cop #2: You're Jack Snyder's cousin?",
        "Meg: Yeah, that's me.",
        "Cop #2: Well, Ms. Snyder, I'm sorry I startled you, but we're conducting a search for a missing person in the area.",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah, I know. Paul Ryan. Detective Kasnoff told me. And no, I haven't seen him yet, and yes, I will let you know if I do. Now, if you don't mind.",
        "Cop #2: I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm going to have to take a look in that backpack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: You are stargazing?",
        "Will: Yeah, it's the perfect night.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, there's no clouds out.",
        "Will: But thank you.",
        "Kim: Listen, kiddo, I have been working for the Main Street shelter for many years, and I know what homelessness looks like. The blankets and the backpacks.",
        "Will: We're not homeless.",
        "Kim: Oh, of course you're not. You're just stuck, right? You haven't been able to work things out between your mom and Dad?",
        "Will: It's their way or the highway.",
        "Kim: This is absolutely awful.",
        "Will: We're going to survive.",
        "Kim: Yeah, but that's the point. The temperature is going down, Will. The wind chill kicks in, and people have died on this street.",
        "Will: Aunt Kim, we'll be okay.",
        "Kim: No, no, you don't understand. I cannot stand to see you here. There is no way that I can stand that. You both have to come home with me. Both of you.",
        "Will: That's just the thing. I know that you're not comfortable with both of us coming and staying with you.",
        "Kim: You think I am comfortable leaving you here to bed down in the street? There is no way I'm going to do that.",
        "Will: Aunt Kim, if you help us, my parents will go nuts. They're trying to prove a point, that we can't take care of ourselves. They want us to fail.",
        "Kim: This is just truly unbelievable.",
        "Will: We had an apartment, and my dad got us evicted. I had a job, and he got me fired. They want me to leave Gwen. And I'm not going to do it. She needs me and I love her.",
        "Kim: All right, all right. But what you have to understand is I am not going to leave you alone here. Now, we're going to have to come to some kind of compromise. [ Kim sighs ] All right, Lakeview is still open. Let me take you there, I'll buy you some hot chocolate. You can warm up and we'll talk about it.",
        "Will: We'd just have to come back outside.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I don't know if it's worth getting warm if we just have to come back out.",
        "Will: Okay, we'll take you up on the hot chocolate.",
        "Kim: Oh, terrific. Come on, let's get your stuff in my car.",
        "Will: But just the chocolate. Then we're going to have to keep moving.",
        "Kim: Right, right. Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden whistling]",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Lily: Oh, good, you're home. We're starving, especially me.",
        "Holden: Well, good. Everybody hungry?",
        "Lily: Everybody's hungry?",
        "Holden: Where's Luke?",
        "Lily: He's right there.",
        "Holden: Hey!",
        "Luke: Hey, Dad. What's up?",
        "Holden: You know how we were talking about going to Arizona for spring break? Here's what I'm thinking. We'll ditch the girls for a couple of days, and you and me will go check out the Sox at spring training.",
        "Luke: But you're a Cubs fan.",
        "Holden: I will make the sacrifice. I think we should go watch them get revved up for the new series, all right?",
        "Luke: Yeah, that's awesome. Thanks, Dad.",
        "Lily: Hey, I'm a Sox fan. Can I go?",
        "Holden: No. Guys only.",
        "Luke: Well, hey, I'll bring you a shirt.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you.",
        "Luke: And a hat.",
        "Lily: I think you better save your money. Once everybody at school finds out where you're going, you're gonna have to buy like a dozen hats.",
        "Luke: Oh, they are going to be so jealous.",
        "Lily: Especially Kevin. He's like a diehard fan. You know, he's going to want to come along.",
        "Holden: You know what, another time. This trip's just for me and Luke.",
        "Luke: Yeah, Mom. Just me and Dad. It'll be cool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: So, what'd you guys do? Light some candles, open a bottle of wine?",
        "Katie: His ex-wife showed up.",
        "Mike: With divorce papers.",
        "Nick: Well, at least you know he loves you, Katie. The man's not divorced for more than 30 seconds and he already he's willing to tie the knot.",
        "Katie: Yeah, what can I say, I'm irresistible. He even got down on one knee.",
        "Nick: Let me get a look at this ring. I could buy myself another motorcycle for what you dropped on this rock.",
        "Mike: Don't compare my girl to a motorcycle.",
        "Katie: Aw.",
        "Nick: All right, so when's the wedding date? You know, I've gotta get myself a date.",
        "Katie: Yes, you do. Because I'm giving your file to every girl in my wedding party.",
        "Nick: My file?",
        "Katie: Yeah. You know we keep files on the dangerous ones, right? You knew that, right?",
        "Mike: Is this yours?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Nick: That's Carly's. She must've dropped it. Don't worry, I'll drop it off to her.",
        "Katie: Honey, why don't you drop it off. I really wanted to talk to Margo a little bit more. And then you could swing by and pick me back up.",
        "Nick: You know, you pop the question an hour ago and already she's got you running her errands?",
        "Katie: He doesn't mind. Besides, Carly likes him.",
        "[Mike chuckles]",
        "Nick: I don't know, Cus. Do you really want a woman this ferocious in the family?",
        "Mike: Watching her cut you down to size, I'd propose all over again. See you in a little bit.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Nick: I don't know where Margo went.",
        "Katie: That's okay. You and I need to have a little talk.",
        "Nick: About what?",
        "Katie: Carly Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey, what happened?",
        "Carly: I twisted my ankle. It's a very long story.",
        "Jack: Yeah? How'd you do it?",
        "Carly: It was dumb. I fell.",
        "Jack: Where were you?",
        "Carly: Maybe I should get some ice on this or something.",
        "Jack: Yeah, definitely. Just sit tight. So where were you? Were you at the park?",
        "Carly: No, no. Gwen was here and we sort of got into it a little bit.",
        "Jack: And you fell? Or did she push you?",
        "Carly: No, nothing like that. This happened after she left.",
        "Jack: So what happened with Gwen?",
        "Carly: I did something that maybe I shouldn't have. But I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was helping.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and whatever you did, or tried to do, blew up in your face. And now she's madder than ever.",
        "Carly: Yeah, that's it exactly. How did you know? So I was upset, I went to see you at the station, you weren't there and I wasn't watching where I was going and I tripped and I twisted my ankle. And that's the end of the boring story.",
        "Jack: So, was Hal there to help you out?",
        "Carly: No, no, he wasn't there. How long should I ice this?",
        "Jack: 20 minutes. So who was there? I hope somebody gave you a hand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #2: I'm going to have to take a look in that backpack.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Cop #2: It's just procedure, ma'am.",
        "Meg: Officer, I've seen Paul Ryan. I don't think he'd fit in here.",
        "Cop #2: The backpack, please.",
        "Meg: You know something? I came out here to be by myself and mind my own business and if that's all I'm guilty of, I don't see why I should let you push me around for no good reason. If you want to paw through my long underwear and fog up my binoculars, then you have to get yourself a warrant.",
        "Cop #2: Fine. I'll call Detective Kasnoff and ask him to speak to a judge. [Rustling in the woods] What was that?",
        "Meg: Probably a deer. You know, there's a ton of them about 50 yards from here and they're really --",
        "Cop #2: Quiet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #3: Malone! They found a car in the river about a half-mile upstream.",
        "Cop #2: Paul Ryan's?",
        "Cop #3: Don't know yet, but they need everybody at the site to pull it out.",
        "Cop #2: Ms. Snyder, I want you to go directly to your cabin and lock the door. Do not touch anything. You could be tampering with evidence.",
        "Meg: Paul? What the hell are you doing here? You're not strong enough to be wandering around. You could have given us both away.",
        "Paul: Forgive me. I was a little worried about you.",
        "Meg: About me?",
        "Paul: Yeah, it's dark out. It's cold.",
        "Meg: Let's get back to the cabin.",
        "Paul: Did you hear what they said?",
        "Meg: About the car?",
        "Paul: Emily must have pushed it over the cliff. Although how she managed to do that by herself, God only knows.",
        "Meg: She probably drove it to the end of the bluff and jumped out at the last minute.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Meg: She's probably trying to cover her steps. She thinks she killed you, remember?",
        "Paul: And she may be right yet.",
        "Meg: Let's go.",
        "Paul: Wait. Did you find the gun?",
        "Meg: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: I'm wiping off Emily's fingerprints. Hold this. I'll cover it with my own. With any luck, they'll think I killed myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: What do you mean, Carly doesn't like me?",
        "Katie: See, that's why we need to have this talk. Because I like you and I don't want you messing things up.",
        "Nick: Oakdale is a very small town. It's one of those places where everybody knows what everybody else is doing. So no flirting with the crossing guards?",
        "Katie: No flirting with Jack Snyder's wife.",
        "Nick: I wasn't flirting with her.",
        "Katie: You had her lying on top of you.",
        "Nick: She fell.",
        "Katie: How did she fall, Nick?",
        "Nick: If you want to know the truth? She lost her balance. I was trying to cheer her up.",
        "Katie: You took her husband's job, Nick, she's not gonna warm up.",
        "Nick: He crossed the line. He got docked.",
        "Katie: Tell that to his kids. Tell that to his wife who's trying to feed and clothe them on half a paycheck. You're not her favorite person right now.",
        "Nick: What are you trying to say?",
        "Katie: Leave her alone.",

        "Jack: You mean to tell me that nobody lifted a finger at the station to help you?",
        "Carly: No, I'm not telling you that. Mike was there and he helped me out to my car. And he has really good news. He and Katie are engaged.",
        "Jack: Well, it's about time.",
        "Carly: Yeah, all's well that ends well. And they're so happy. Enjoying the moment.",
        "Jack: It's a sweet one.",
        "Carly: Yeah, and it's thanks to us. Because they got together at our wedding, don't forget.",
        "Jack: True. I just hope they're as happy as we are.",
        "Carly: That'll never happen, you know? Because we are the happiest people ever.",
        "Jack: I think that we should take this upstairs.",
        "Carly: That's a good idea. I'll check the kids.",
        "Jack: No, no. You just get into bed. I'll check the kids and turn off the lights. You just get that ankle up. Poor little girl.",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Carly: You're the best.",
        "Jack: You're right. [Doorbell rings] Hey, Mike. Hey, I heard about you and Katie. Congratulations.",
        "Mike: Thank you, man. We're pretty excited about it.",
        "Jack: You want to come in for a drink or something?",
        "Mike: No, I've got to get back to Katie. I just wanted to drop this off. Carly left it at the station.",
        "Jack: Thanks for helping Carly out. I appreciate that, with her ankle and everything.",
        "Mike: I just walked her to her car. Nick's the one who caught her when she fell.",

        "Holden: That was excellent. That was the best meal I've had in a long time.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about? It's my mystery meatloaf. You never liked that.",
        "Holden: It was good.",
        "Lily: Thanks.",
        "Holden: What's for dessert?",
        "Lily: I thought you didn't want dessert.",
        "Holden: I got some dessert right here.",
        "Lily: You're in a very good mood. You were very worried about Luke earlier.",
        "Holden: Well, it's been a rough time and that's over. So I decided it's time to focus on positive things. And I try not to worry about what could go wrong. As long as I'm with you and the kids, I'm good.",
        "Lily: That's all that matters. Things are going to go wrong, that's life. Especially with a teenager. But, with Luke, we've got to give him some space and know that he's going to be okay.",
        "Holden: And you understand about the trip to see the Sox?",
        "Lily: Oh, are you kidding me? Please, it's a great idea. He lit up when you talked about it. But you're going to have to make it up to me when you get back.",
        "Luke: Get a room!",
        "Lily: Did you do the dishes?",
        "Luke: Every last one. And thanks again, Dad, for the trip to the Sox. I can't wait.",
        "Holden: It's going to be a good trip.",
        "Lily: We should go upstairs because we have to read the girls that book that they like so much.",
        "Holden: Okay. Is your homework done?",
        "Luke: I'm chipping away at it.",
        "Lily: Can you turn off the lights when you come up?",
        "Holden: Goodnight.",

        "Luke: What're you doing here?",
        "Kevin: Now is that the sweetest thing you have ever seen? There's a lot in here. Let's make sure it doesn't go to waste. We'll have our own little private party.",

        "Kim: Isn't this better? I don't know about you two, but I'm just now beginning to get the feeling back in my feet and my legs. It's bitter out there.",
        "Gwen: This is really great. Thank you, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Kim: Oh, you're so welcome. Get that circulation going.",
        "Will: You doing okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Kim: You know, the offer still ands. I'd be so happy to have you both come and stay with me.",
        "Will: Aunt Kim, I know you're just trying to help, but the way things have been going, my parents'd never forgive you.",
        "Kim: Oh, for heaven's sakes, I've been crossing swords with your mother for years. You can't scare me.",
        "Will: It's not worth it. She's not going to back down. And I don't want to be the cause of any problems for you and Uncle Bob. But we appreciate the offer.",
        "Kim: You know, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go talk to Lisa.",
        "Will: Sure. You sure you're okay?",
        "Gwen: I'm just tired.",
        "Will: You know, you can still go stay with my Aunt Kim and Uncle Bob. I'll just --",
        "Gwen: No, it wouldn't work. You're right. We'll just figure something out.",
        "Will: There's always the shelter.",
        "Gwen: I stayed there once. I won't go there again.",
        "Will: When was this?",
        "Gwen: The first time I left home. It's a scary place.",
        "Will: Yeah, but at least it's warm.",
        "Gwen: I'd rather stay outside. Besides, we're underage. They'd separate us. And if they take you away from me --",
        "Will: Nobody's taking me away. This is me and you, okay? We'll get through tonight and we'll figure something out.",
        "Kim: To tell you the truth, I could just cheerfully strangle Barbara.",
        "Lisa: I just can't believe this. What in the world is wrong with Hal? It is freezing out there. The poor kids.",
        "Kim: I know. One thing, we can't let these kids go back outside. There must be someplace they can stay.",
        "Lisa: I have an idea.",

        "Nick: Listen, Katie, I appreciate your concern, it's sweet. But there's nothing going on with me and Carly Snyder.",
        "Katie: And there never will be. Because she's in love with her husband. And the sooner you figure that out, the happier you will be.",
        "Nick: I am happy. I'm ecstatic that my cousin's marrying a girl who's looking out for me.",
        "Katie: That's just it. I am looking out for you. Jack Snyder is just one of those people that everybody loves. He's sweet and decent.",
        "Nick: He's no boy scout. Let me tell you that.",
        "Katie: He was protecting his wife. That is the only reason he broke that rule and you know it. And everyone in town knows it. And if you want the guys here to have your back, you better respect his wife.",
        "Nick: All I'm saying is that if a beautiful woman happens to fall on top of me, I'm going to enjoy it for as long as I can.",
        "Katie: And if it'd been Jack that walked in instead of Mike and me?",
        "Nick: What, he doesn't trust his wife?",
        "Katie: You don't quit, do you?",
        "Nick: Nope.",

        "Nick: We'll see.",
        "Katie: Don't tell me you actually think you have a chance with her.",
        "Nick: I'm not even thinking about her. I've got a beautiful blonde standing right in front of me.",
        "Katie: And if there are so many women out there, why are you so worked up over one?",
        "Nick: Do I look worked up?",
        "Katie: Yeah, you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So, Nick -- Nick was the one to help her out? Your cousin?",
        "Mike: Yeah. I don't know all the details, but I guess Carly tripped or whatever. Katie and I come walking in and there's the two of them laying on the floor together. I don't mean to laugh. I know that Carly's ankle was killing her. But the sight of the two of them. Carly didn't tell you?",
        "Jack: No, she was just about to and the kids interrupted. You sure you don't want to come in for that drink?",
        "Mike: No, I've got to get back to the station. I just wanted to drop that off.",
        "Jack: All right, well, thanks again.",

        "Gwen: I feel really, really dizzy.",
        "Will: All right, well, I don't want you passing out on me. Why don't you come have a seat, relax and have a drink?",
        "Gwen: Champagne?",
        "Will: No, it's actually sparkling cider. It's the next best thing. Here. Chocolate-covered strawberry? Better?",
        "Gwen: How did you do this?",
        "Will: You remember the trust fund that I'm supposed to have?",
        "Gwen: The one your mom won't let you touch?",
        "Will: Yeah. She finally saw the light. She knew I deserved it because when I do good things with it. Great things. Important things.",
        "Gwen: Like what?",
        "Will: Like make you happy.",
        "Gwen: I feel dizzy again -- in a good way. Is it hot in here?",
        "Will: Yeah, if you're dressed for the South Pole. But that's okay, it's a good thing, because it lets me do this.",
        "Gwen: There's a bed right over there.",
        "Will: Yeah, and the bed looks really nice, but I have to give you something first.",

        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Lisa: Wait, kids, listen -- Kim was just telling me what's going on. Well, I think it's just ridiculous. Every time your mother starts to get back to her wonderful, old self again, she does something else crazy.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, it's been hard on him.",
        "Lisa: Yeah, I know. And it's been hard on you, too. You lose your apartment just because Will's parents lose their minds.",
        "Gwen: I've had better weeks, but thank you for understanding. It really means a lot.",
        "Will: Yeah, and thanks, Aunt Kim, for the food and the hot chocolate. We feel a lot better.",
        "Kim: I'm glad, that's good.",
        "Lisa: Just a minute, wait a minute, come back here. We're not finished here.",
        "Will: Aren't you closing up soon?",
        "Lisa: I own the hotel. We close when I say we close. But Kim and I were talking, and well, I can understand why you don't what to go back home with her. But here's my idea. Gwen, I'd like for you to stay here as my guest.",

        "Luke: If they come downstairs and I'm gone.",
        "Kevin: So, you went for a run. Where's the crime?",
        "Luke: Now, look, they're all over me. If they think that I've been drinking again --",
        "Kevin: They're gonna what? What? Take away your sneakers? Chain you to the couch? Come on.",
        "Luke: Look, I just -- I can't. It's not a good idea.",
        "Kevin: I came all the way over here.",
        "Luke: But that's not my fault. I told you \"no\" over the phone.",
        "Kevin: Well, I figured if I came here, you know, you'd change your mind.",

        "Kevin: Luke, I thought we were friends.",
        "Luke: We are friends.",

        "Kevin: And what? What? Make brownies?",

        "Kevin: I want to party, Luke. So, are you in or out? Come on, Luke, just for an hour. All right? We'll have a little fun. I knew you wanted to party, you dog. Just wanted to make me work for it, huh?",

        "Nick: All right, thanks a lot. Katie, I like myself the way I am. All right? And if I see a beautiful cross my radar, I'm gonna look and I'm gonna do anything to make her smile. What can I do to make you smile? See? That wasn't hard, now was it?",
        "Mike: Hey, you talk to Margo?",
        "Katie: No, not yet.",
        "Nick: Hey, you know you two should go home and celebrate. I'm gonna be here for a couple of hours at least. You know, you might have to tackle this one on your own, buddy. Did Carly get her scarf?",

        "Meg: How do you know the cops'll find the gun and the piece of shirt there?",
        "Paul: Well, if that's my car, then by tomorrow -- if not sooner -- they'll be searching the river for my body. And that's when they'll find the gun and they'll match it with my fingerprints. Then they'll find the scraps of my bloody shirt and they'll match it with my blood type. And we'll be home free. But not if they catch us here first so, let's go.",
        "Meg: Okay, let me help you. Come here.",
