        "Will and Gwen ask to join Barbara when she goes to Dusty's memorial service. Lily is confused about what is happening when she finds out that Dusty is dead. She wants to help in some way, but Holden is adamant that she stays out of it. Lily wants to go to the service, but Holden doesn't think it is a good idea; she owes Dusty nothing! Lily convinces him that she has to do this because they were best friends since childhood. Allison wakes Emily, who is having another nightmare about Dusty, wondering why she isn't dressed for the Service? She isn't going because Dusty ruined her life! Craig shows up at Dusty's memorial to talk with Meg, who angrily kicks him out. Allison doesn't believe that Dusty was the one that told Emily's secret and hopes she will reconsider. Margo finds out that there was a phone number that Dusty repeatedly called the night he died, so they want to find out whom it belongs to. Lily has a memory after she gets to Dusty's Service, and Holden wonders if this is the right thing, but Lily is adamant she needs to keep pushing herself to remember to see if she can help catch Dusty's killer. Susan remembers seeing Holden around the drug bin at the hospital. Allison, Will and Lucinda speak at Dusty's service. Sofie sees Hallie and her babysitter downtown and rushes over to see Hallie. Will and Gwen talk about Sofie's attachment with Hallie; Will thinks they should limit the time they spend together. Emily shows up at Dusty's service. Meg rushes out when Will talks about Dusty and Jen not being able to see their kids grow up. Margo and Dallas find out that Dusty was talking with a lab tech, whom he worked with before. Lily blames Emily for Dusty's death. Emily realizes Lily was the one who left the note for Chris. Emily is devastated when she realizes she was blaming Dusty; she sobs as she tells a photograph of Dusty how sorry she is and asking herself what she did? Gwen asks Barbara about her speech problem. Barbara assures her that she simply needs dental work redone. Allison sees Sofie downtown with Hallie and the babysitter and is leery. Lily thanks Holden for being so good to her and for letting her stay at the Farm. He promises that they will get through this, just like they have always done. Both talk about the horrible things they have done that they wish they could take back. Lily calls Holden her hero. When Susan sees Emily falling apart and acting guilty after learning the truth about Dusty, Susan decides to quickly put the blame elsewhere \u0096 on Holden. She tells Margo that she saw him around an unattended drug station the night of Dusty's murder. Margo is forced to get a search warrant for the Farm. Craig approaches Meg about Montgomery Enterprises, but the last thing on her mind is business. Craig snaps that he only has business left in his life. After a \u0091sales pitch', an exhausted Meg tells Craig he can have the Company if he never contacts her again. Will and Gwen are a bit concerned when Sofie comes home with Hallie and the babysitter. Will thinks now it is time to set ground rules. Craig is toasting to his success, which he happily shares (rubs in) with Lucinda. Lucinda predicts he will fall soon and then she will be the one toasting. Margo thinks they have found nothing at the farm until they check one last area. Susan watches as Emily continues to fall apart. Holden and Lily come home to find Dallas and Margo at the Farm searching it. She wonders if they know anything about the syringe they found there? Holden admits to being the one who put it there. Margo asks him to come downtown to the station. Holden kisses Lily on the forehead and promises everything will be ok."

        "Will: Hey, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Hi. I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Will: I got your message about Dusty's service.",
        "Barbara: Please don't accuse me of using Dusty's death to manipulate you into dealing with me --",
        "Will: Mom, I'm not. I'm glad you called. Dusty was a part of the family.",
        "Barbara: He was like another son to me.",
        "Will: Do you want to go over to the church with us? As a family?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Why did everything go so terribly wrong? Why?",
        "Craig: Atoning for your sins?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden remembering]",
        "Holden: Lily! Lily, where are you going?",
        "Lily: I hurt Dusty. I have to make it right.",
        "Holden: Dusty's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Emily remembering]",
        "Chris: I need an answer Emily. This guy just said you slept together.",
        "Emily: It happened once, on New Year's Eye. I swear to you, it didn't mean anything. [Chris leaves the room] I swear to God, Dusty Donovan, I will get payback for this if it's the last thing I do.",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Emily: Uh, hold on. Alison.",
        "Alison: You're not dressed. Aren't you coming to Dusty's service?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, if you two don't mind, I would love to go with you.",
        "Gwen: Of course. You're not alone.",
        "Barbara: The other day, Paul told me that it was every man for himself.",
        "Will: He just lost his son. He's got to deal with that whatever way he knows how. And knowing Paul, that doesn't involve having family around taking care of him.",
        "Barbara: It means a lot to me that you're here. I know I've made a lot of mistakes and this last one --",
        "Will: Mom, Mom, Mom -- Mom, none of that matters right now. Okay, we just have to pull together for Dusty, and for Jen.",
        "Gwen: Are you, Guys, ready?",
        "Barbara: Let me just drop this --",
        "Gwen: I'm really proud of you.",
        "Sofie: Hey, um, I heard about Mr. Donovan. Aaron told me you were really close. I'm so sorry.",
        "Will: Thanks.",
        "Sofie: You know, I just finished my shift and I'd be happy to sit for Hallie while you're at the service.",
        "Will: Um, thanks, but we already have a sitter.",
        "Barbara: I'm ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Dusty's gone?",
        "Holden: That's right. You were pretty out of it when it happened. You had a lot of drugs in your system.",
        "Lily: I remember that part. But I feel like there's other parts that I've kind of just -- I can't remember. That I've just blocked out.",
        "Holden: Maybe it's better that way.",
        "Lily: Why would it be better that way?",
        "Meg: Hey, Holden. Good morning, Lily. How are you feeling?",
        "Lily: Why are you dressed like that? Is it Dusty's funeral? Is it?",
        "Holden: Yes. The service is this morning.",
        "Lily: I want to go.",
        "Holden: Lily, you are in no shape to go anywhere.",
        "Lily: I can't skip Dusty's funeral. He was my best friend.",
        "Holden: People will understand. You just got out of the hospital. You're still weak. You're not up to it.",
        "Lily: It doesn't matter how I feel. I have to be there.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm trying to take care of you here.",
        "Lily: I know. And I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm just a little weak, that's all --",
        "Holden: You just got out of the hospital.",
        "Lily: Yes, a hospital that I was in because of a drug overdose. I know we have to talk about this, but I did this to myself. And Dusty was my best friend since I was a child. I would never forgive myself if I didn't say good-bye to him.",
        "Holden: You don't need to do it publicly.",
        "Lily: Yes, I do. I owe it to him.",
        "Holden: No, you don't. You owe him nothing!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Dusty ruined my life, Ali.",
        "Alison: Uh, Emily, Dusty was in love with you --",
        "Emily: He's the reason I lost Chris. Don't you see? He told him everything. He told him what I used to do. That I was a hooker.",
        "Alison: What? Wait, Dusty told Chris?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Everything. So, you see, Dusty loved me so much, he destroyed my entire life.",
        "Alison: I can't believe Dusty would do that to you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, believe it. It was him. It had to have been him. I mean, besides you and Mom, he was the only one who knew.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Dusty is the reason that you OD'd. He was over you. You were furious with him.",
        "Lily: I don't remember what happened the last time I saw him.",
        "Holden: That's okay.",
        "Lily: No, it's not okay. It's bad. I have a bad feeling. I said some horrible things. How could I have done that to him? Dusty and I have been friends our whole lives. I can't forget that just because he didn't want to be with me. If I don't go to his funeral, it will look like I didn't care about him. And I do -- I did. I did care about him. I can't -- if you don't want to go, I understand.",
        "Holden: You're okay? Are you sure?",
        "Lily: I'm okay.",
        "Holden: Let's get dressed and we'll go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'd finally left the past behind me. I was ready to move on with my life. Only Dusty wouldn't let me go.",
        "Alison: But Dusty was the one who got you out of that life to begin with.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Apparently, I owed him eternal loyalty for that. I didn't want him in my life, but he wouldn't let me to be happy with anybody but him.",
        "Alison: That doesn't sound like Dusty.",
        "Emily: He asked you to spy on Chris for him, Alison.",
        "Alison: Because he was worried about you --",
        "Emily: About me being with another man.",
        "Alison: Okay, I got the feeling that it was more than that --",
        "Emily: He messed with our lives, Alison. He should've stayed out of it. He should have left us alone and maybe he'd still be here.",
        "Alison: Are you saying he deserved to die?",
        "Emily: No. No, of course not. I would never -- I would never think that. He should have just left me alone.",
        "Alison: Look, I know Dusty could be a real pain sometimes. But the one thing I always knew was that he wanted me to be okay. He wanted me to be happy.",
        "Emily: You've got to go -- okay, you've got to go. You're going to be late -- late for the service.",
        "Alison: If you change your mind --",
        "Emily: I won't. Just go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Craig, this is Dusty's day. You despised each other. It is tacky for you to be waltzing in the aisle at his funeral.",
        "Craig: Where did all this newfound Dusty love come from for you, Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: I have known him since he was a child --",
        "Craig: A few days ago, you called him delusional for opposing memo 21.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, but I was the one who was going to allow him to give evidence at that ghastly signing party. By the way, speaking of that party, why weren't you there? You were the -- the patron of memo 21.",
        "Craig: I had other things to attend to.",
        "Lucinda: Making sure that Dusty wouldn't blow the whistle on your investment?",
        "Craig: Are you suggesting I murdered him?",
        "Lucinda: Well, it wouldn't be the first time that you eliminated somebody who got in the -- in between you and what you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: The company faxed over a record of Donovan's cell phone activity. Don't worry. I already cross-checked most of the numbers, but this one he was dialing repeatedly right before he was murdered -- now, it is listed as a private number. Why don't you track that down and I'll be back in a couple of hours, all right?",
        "Dallas: All right, um, where are you going?",
        "Margo: To a funeral. To see if the guilty party shows up to pay his or her last respects.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Meg, are you all right?",
        "Meg: I can't believe you actually had the nerve to show up here.",
        "Lucinda: Join the club.",
        "Craig: I came here to see you.",
        "Meg: This is a funeral, Craig. It's not about us. It's about honoring Dusty's memory.",
        "Craig: You won't return my phone calls. I'm not allowed at the farm --",
        "Meg: You know what? I guess you forget the part where I said I never want to be in the same room with you. That includes churches. Leave me alone, Craig. From now on, if you want something, talk to my lawyer.",
        "Barbara: I told you not to be here.",
        "Craig: Oh come on, this is getting ridiculous.",
        "Lucinda: Why don't you take the hint?",
        "Craig: Okay. Fine. I'll leave. But that man was not the saint that you're all about to make him out to be.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I pray God cannot read my thoughts right now.",
        "Will: Mom, let's just find a seat. Come on.",
        "Barbara: No, no, I have to talk to the minister first --",
        "Gwen: No, Will can take care of that.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. Thank you -- I mean, I am so sorry -- every time I see that man's face, it reminds me of what I lost. I've lost Jennifer. Lost Johnny and now Dusty. I miss Hal so much. I just -- I miss them all.",
        "Gwen: You know we're here for you. I know it's not the same, but --",
        "Barbara: Thank you. It means a lot. Thank you for getting Will here today.",
        "Gwen: Actually, we decided together. Hey, I don't -- I don't mean to bring this up now. I don't want to make you self-conscious, but I noticed that your speech sounds like a little off -- I noticed it at the house the other night. Are you okay?",
        "Barbara: Yeah. I've -- um, I had a little dental work done and they didn't do a very good job. So I'm going to have it re-done when I have a chance, thank you.",
        "Will: Mom, the minister just arrived. He said he wants to give it a few more minutes.",
        "Barbara: Thanks for taking care of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What's wrong?",
        "Lily: I just remembered something.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: At the hospital. The night that Dusty was killed. I ran into the stairwell. I didn't -- I didn't remember that until you just opened that door.",
        "Holden: All right, I knew this was a bad idea. Come on, let's go.",
        "Lily: Look, all right, why -- why do we have to go? What are you so afraid that I'm going to remember?",
        "Holden: Lily, it's not that I don't want you to remember. I just don't want you to end up back in the hospital because you pushed yourself too hard.",
        "Lily: I feel better -- being here. Things are coming back to me. I have to try to remember what happened.",
        "Holden: Maybe there's a reason that you blocked it all out.",
        "Lily: Maybe I saw who killed Dusty.",
        "Holden: All right. You know what? Not here.",
        "Lily: I am serious. Maybe I saw something and maybe by being here it'll help bring back the memory.",
        "Holden: And what if you're too fragile to handle it?",
        "Lily: I'm not scared. If I can help find Dusty's killer, then I don't care what I have to go through.",
        "Alison: Are you okay? You look a little pale.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "[Holden remembering]",
        "Susan: Holden, can I help you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Are you going to call the sitter?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I just want to let her know that our phones are going to be off during the service.",
        "Sitter: Hello?",
        "Gwen: Hey, Grace, it's Gwen. I just -- I hope the phone didn't wake up the baby.",
        "Sitter: No, we're outside in Old Town. Hallie wanted some fresh air.",
        "Gwen: Oh, did you put something on to cover her head?",
        "Sitter: Yes, even though she hated letting me put it on. And I brought a fresh bottle and a blanket, just in case.",
        "Gwen: You think I'm a crazy mom, huh?",
        "Sitter: You're a mom. Moms worry. Do you want us to pick up anything while we're out?",
        "Gwen: No. No, that's okay. I just wanted to let you know that our phones are going to be off for about an hour and a half until the service is over.",
        "Sitter: No problem. We'll be just fine.",
        "Will: Is everything okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I just miss Hallie.",
        "Will: I know what you mean. I feel the same way every time I'm away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hi, Hallie. Is that you?",
        "Sitter: Excuse me.",
        "Sofie: Oh, no, no. It's okay. I'm a family friend. Hallie and I go way back. To before you were born, right, little girl? You don't know how happy I am to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: If I miss Hallie this much, imagine how Sofie must feel.",
        "Will: Sofie knew the deal when she signed the adoption papers.",
        "Gwen: Still, she's gotta feel like she's missing a part of herself.",
        "Will: Hey, it's not going to be good for anyone if Sofie gets too attached to Hallie.",
        "Barbara: What do you think?",
        "Lucinda: What were you thinking, letting her come here?",
        "Holden: I tried to talk her out of it, but she was coming, with or without me.",
        "Minister: We have come here today to honor the life of Dustin Donovan. Brother and son. Beloved friend. Partner in life and love. Fellow traveler. We've gathered here to grieve him, to comfort each other, and to meditate on the brevity of life. While we should all give thanks for the life of Dustin Donovan, we should also remember he has given meaning to our lives. How will his legacy live on in us? Don't let his untimely death have been in vain. If any of you would like to share some personal reflections on Dusty's life --",
        "Gwen: If you want, I can go up with you.",
        "Barbara: I'm not sure I can do this at all.",
        "Will: I'll go for you.",
        "Alison: Dusty and I have been through a lot together. Many of you know that. But you don't know all of it. Dusty saved me. He dragged me out of a life I had no business living. And, believe me, I did not make it easy for him. But he refused to give up on me when everyone else had. He believed in me. And not that he was perfect. He wasn't. And he would be the first person to tell you that. I mean, he was angry and impulsive and he could be really rude sometimes. But in his heart, he was a decent man and a good friend. Better than I deserved most of the time. And I wouldn't be standing here right now if he hadn't been there for me. It'll be a scarier world without you in it. And you will be surely missed.",
        "Will: When I first met Dusty, I didn't like him very much. He was so tough. I just tried to stay out of his way. But then he fell in love with my sister and I realized that tough exterior that he had was just the face he showed people that he didn't trust. And underneath it all, he was really just a big teddy bear. I know from experience, that finding the love of your life can do that to a guy. And falling in love with a child can do that, too. And Dusty was crazy about Johnny. It didn't matter that he wasn't his biological father. That kid was his just as much his as he was Jennifer's. And Johnny made them both better people. And isn't that what being a parent is all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sitter: We should go. It's getting time for her nap.",
        "Sofie: But you just got here.",
        "Sitter: I promised Gwen that Hallie would get a nap before they got home.",
        "Sofie: Just a few more minutes. I didn't even get a chance to talk to you.",
        "Sitter: About what?",
        "Sofie: Your, um -- your background. Have you ever cared for a newborn before? How much childcare experience do you have?",
        "Sitter: I don't mean to be rude but, how is that any of your business?",
        "Sofie: Actually, when it comes to Hallie, it's very much my business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: The saddest part about Dusty and Jennifer's passing is that they never got the chance to experience the joy of watching their child grow up. And after all the garbage they went through in their lives, they finally had the chance to be happy, and it was ripped away from them. I hope they're together now, the way they should be. Because they deserve it.",
        "Minister: Would anyone else like to speak?",
        "Lucinda: Um, yes, I'd like to just say something of Lily speaking. I think I've known Dusty longer than anyone else in this room. Because I gave him his first job as a boy. He worked in my stables. And then his life intertwined with our life. And as a man, he came to work with me, work for me, with me, and he was persevering and strong and fun and loyal. Loyal beyond self- interest really. And then his time ran out. Too soon. And this is an abomination. And someone's gotta pay for it.",
        "Minister: This concludes our service. Go in peace.",
        "Alison: I'm glad you came.",
        "Emily: Me too.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Emily: Damn it, Dusty. It shouldn't have ended this way.",
        "Lily: No, it shouldn't have. But it did, thanks to you.",
        "Emily: Are you accusing me of murdering Dusty?",
        "Lily: You led him on. You made him think he had a chance with you.",
        "Emily: I told him -- I told him every way I knew how that it was over, Lily.",
        "Lily: Oh please. We wouldn't even be here if you hadn't kept Dusty on a string. He made enemies for you. Fighting for your honor! Hookers don't have honor. That's a joke. You sell yourselves to the highest bidder!",
        "Emily: He told you? Dusty told you that about me?",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Lily: Did you know Dusty at all? Dusty was way too protective of you to give away your dirty little secret. No, I heard it from one of Cherie's other girls.",
        "Emily: It was you? You sent that note to Chris?",
        "Lily: He deserved so much better than you.",
        "Holden: All right. That's enough. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Well? Anyone's conscience kick in at the funeral?",
        "Margo: No, not at all. They're all declaring their undying love for a man they hated the other day. Any luck with this phone list I left you with?",
        "Dallas: Yeah, the private number came up. It was a guy named Neil Perkins. He's a lab tech. Works for a private company across town. Get this -- a couple years ago he did some DNA testing for Donovan involving Johnny Donovan's paternity. I haven't gotten a hold of him yet, but it looks like he was doing some more freelance work for our victim.",
        "Margo: So, it was Perkins, -- Neil Perkins that Donovan was calling that night at the hospital. He must have been holding the evidence that Donovan was waiting for that night.",
        "Dallas: Want me to bring him in?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Maybe Perkins will tell us what that evidence was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I'm -- I'm one of Will and Gwen's closest friends. And I was Hallie's first babysitter.",
        "Alison: Is that so? Hi, I'm Alison. I'm Hallie's Godmother. Do you mind if I say hi?",
        "Sitter: No, go ahead.",
        "Alison: Hi, little angel. She's gotten so big.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, hasn't she? I think she's doubled in weight since she was born.",
        "Sitter: She's definitely a popular little girl. But like I said before, we really need to go.",
        "Alison: Have you uh -- been seeing her a lot lately?",
        "Sofie: Gwen and Will are fine with it.",
        "Sitter: Is there any reason they wouldn't be?",
        "Alison: Um, I don't know. You'd have to ask them.",
        "Sofie: Go for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Thank you for letting me go with you. It made it a lot easier.",
        "Will: You hungry? Because the sitter said that she could stay through the afternoon, if you want we can go get a bite to eat for lunch.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm actually craving a burger.",
        "Barbara: You two are pretty transparent. You need to go home to your baby.",
        "Will: Okay. Um, are you going to be all right?",
        "Barbara: I'm fine. Get home to that little girl.",
        "Will: I'll call you.",
        "Barbara: I hope so, Will.",
        "Gwen: And go -- go to the dentist. Go to a new one. You need to get that taken care of.",
        "Barbara: Yeah. I will. Thanks.",

        "Sofie: Gwen and Will want me to be a part of Hallie's life. They've been very clear about that.",
        "Alison: Look, I know that it's now an open adoption, but --",
        "Sofie: You know, if Gwen and Will are okay with my seeing Hallie, then you should be fine with it, too.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I mean, its fine. You know, I'm not trying to keep you away from their baby.",
        "Sofie: Good. Anyway, I was just trying to saying hi. That's not a big deal, right?",
        "Alison: No. No big deal. Well, I'd better get going. Bye, Sweetie. It was nice meeting you. Take good care of her.",
        "Sitter: Yeah. Nice meeting you. We really have to go home.",

        "Meg: Then why do you keep showing up everywhere I go?",
        "Craig: We have unfinished business. With the emphasis on business.",
        "Meg: Is this about Montgomery Enterprises?",
        "Craig: Our marriage is over. But you never told me what you wanted to do with the corporation.",
        "Meg: My God, Craig! Dusty just died. I have known him since we were kids. I can't stop thinking about my baby -- and all you want to talk about is business?",
        "Craig: It has to be done.",
        "Meg: I care as much about the corporation right now as I do about you which is not at all!",
        "Craig: Okay, actually you know what? Actually, you never really did care about the corporation. But I do. You do not have the patience or the skill-set to run a multi-national, but I do. I have that in spades.",

        "Susan: What's the matter?",
        "Emily: I thought it was Dusty -- I thought it was Dusty who told Chris about my past. But I was wrong, it wasn't him. It wasn't him. He wouldn't have done that. He wouldn't have done that. He didn't, and I accused him of it. I insisted that it was him. And now --",
        "Susan: Now what?",
        "Emily: Oh, my God, it's my fault, Mom. It's my fault Dusty's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm sorry that I lost it at the church. Just the idea of Emily showing up to pay homage to a man that she treated like dirt -- thank you for coming here. I couldn't go back to the house all by myself.",
        "Holden: You don't have to. And you can stay at the farm for as long as you need to.",
        "Lily: Why are you being so good to me? I've done horrible things. No one would blame you for washing your hands of me.",
        "Holden: I've done things that I wish I could take back. But I can't.",

        "Lily: Whatever you've done, I'm sure it's nothing compared to what I have done.",
        "Holden: You don't know that. Lily, I blame myself for what happened the other night. If I hadn't driven you into Dusty's arms --",
        "Lily: No, you saved me the other night. Just like you always have. You're my hero. You have absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I didn't feel comfortable talking about this with Jack last night. He and Holden are cousins.",
        "Margo: So, you saw something?",
        "Susan: Right before Dusty's body was found, I saw Holden standing by an unattended drug cart. When he realized I was there, he looked very guilty.",
        "Margo: Did you actually see him holding any drugs?",
        "Susan: No. No, I didn't. If I had I would have told you about it last night. I'm not saying Holden killed Dusty, but it's no secret what's been happening between Dusty and Lily.",
        "Margo: I know. Are you sure you didn't see Holden in possession of any drugs, of a syringe --",
        "Susan: No. I didn't. But Holden hated Dusty. He blamed him for the break-up of his marriage, so --.",
        "Margo: Yes, I understand. Thank you so much, Susan, for coming in.",
        "Susan: Oh, I just thought you should know.",

        "Lily: I can't eat.",
        "Holden: I know. It seemed like a good idea at the time, though.",
        "Lily: I mean, if it's really okay, I would like to stay at the farm.",
        "Holden: It's more than okay.",
        "Lily: Do the children know what I did?",
        "Holden: Just Luke.",

        "Meg: We.",
        "Craig: I brought memo-21 to you. I set up the funding for you. I put things into motion -- anything that you even showed the vaguest interest in, and all I want to do now is see the work through. It's a win-win for you. You get to be rich, successful and altruistic, and you won't have to do a damn thing. By the time I'm done with you, you'll have so much money you could actually change the world.",
        "Meg: Fine. Take it.",
        "Craig: No. No, Meg. It's your corporation.",
        "Meg: I don't want it, Craig. Go ahead. Do some good. There is only one condition, though. Don't contact me again. I don't want to see you, I don't want to speak to you, I don't even want to get an e-mail from you. Is that clear?",
        "Craig: Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: So we ran into each other in Old Town, and we ended up having so much fun together that somehow I ended up spending the entire morning with them.",
        "Sitter: Uh, Sofie said she was a good friend of the family, and she seemed to know a lot about the baby. I hope that's okay.",
        "Will: Yeah. No, it's fine. Um, thanks for everything, Grace. Here. That should be enough.",
        "Sitter: Thanks.",

        "Sofie: All right. Do you want me to put her down for you?",
        "Will: No. You know what? Actually, the service has been really draining. So I think we just need some family time right now.",

        "Lucinda: Oh, how like you, Craig. How like you to leave the funeral and then come to a bar and ask for a bottle or champagne.",
        "Craig: Dusty would have done the same for me.",
        "Lucinda: If Dusty were here, I would join him. Only we would skip the funeral, okay?",
        "Craig: Okay, you know what? Don't begrudge me my triumph. I have so few these days.",
        "Lucinda: What's happened? You're not drinking to Dusty's demise?",
        "Craig: No. Meg has decided to let me continue running Montgomery Enterprises. I know you hate it when I win.",
