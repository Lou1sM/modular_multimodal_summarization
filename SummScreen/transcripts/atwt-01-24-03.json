        "Bonnie: I know you have expenses, Dwight. So do we. I mean, but you're charging us the same as you would charge a customer who buys two cases a month. We're buying 20. No, I just think we deserve a discount. Fine. Yes, you do that. Bye. I'm sorry, mom. I'm so sorry. Can I get you something to drink?",
        "Jessica: No, no, no, no. I'm okay. Listen -- I've got to tell you something that I'm sure you're going to hate. I'm going to Washington today. There's a lead on Marshall's daughter, and of course he's in no condition to travel. So I'm going to go on his behalf.",
        "Bonnie: Okay. Okay, if Marshall's needs are that important to you, then -- of course you should go.",
        "Jessica: But?",
        "Bonnie: But nothing, Mom. That's it. I mean, I'm not gonna keep expressing myself when, obviously, it won't do any good.",
        "Jessica: Look, sweetheart, I know you're upset about me and Ben. But I don't want that to eat away at our relationship, okay?",
        "Bonnie: Neither do I. But right now, I'm not so sure that either one of us can stop that from happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse #1: Anything I can get you, Mr. Travers?",
        "Marshall: No, no, thanks.",
        "Nurse #1: Try to get some rest.",
        "Marshall: Concentrate, Marshall. Concentrate. Your daughter needs you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey.",
        "Hal: Hey.",
        "Emily: So how's Will, honey, hmm?",
        "Hal: Well --",
        "Emily: Did he enjoy having breakfast with you?",
        "Hal: The bagels were a big hit. The psych ward, hmm -- not so hot.",
        "Emily: Is he still complaining about the food?",
        "Hal: Oh, the food, his room, the doctors -- you know, he did ask one question I liked, though. Kind of made the whole visit worthwhile.",
        "Emily: What's that?",
        "Hal: He asked when he was going back to school full time. And he didn't seem scared stiff about the prospect.",
        "Emily: Well, that's great!",
        "Hal: Mm -- maybe. Maybe.",
        "Emily: You're not sure?",
        "Hal: Well, sometimes I can't tell if Will is telling me the truth or just saying what he thinks I want to hear.",
        "Emily: You know what? I think you should maybe talk to Dr. Michaels. She's been counseling him for this long. She probably knows more about what he's thinking than we do.",
        "Hal: Whatever Will says to Dr. Michaels is private. And I have to respect that, no matter how much it hurts. Hey.",
        "Emily: Hmm?",
        "Hal: Nice outfit. You interviewing somebody special today?",
        "Emily: Uh -- thanks. No, I'm -- I'm actually gonna take Carly bathing suit shopping for her trip to Cancun. And she's got an appointment with her ob before that, so I'm gonna tag along.",
        "Hal: Well, while she's there, why doesn't she have an in vitro DNA test to determine the identity of the father? I'm sorry, Emily. But I think Carly owes that to Jack.",
        "Emily: Hal, I know this is -- really difficult for you. But -- you've been so careful about respecting Will's privacy with Dr. Michaels. Well, can't you do the same for Jack and Carly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You'd better get going.",
        "Rosanna: You've already got me going.",
        "Craig: We can pick this up after your appointment with Dr. Schiller.",
        "Rosanna: There's no rush. We've got plenty of time. Why don't you tell me about Lucy and Aaron? Hmm? You have barely cursed him in the past few hours.",
        "Craig: No, I don't wanna burden you with Aaron.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean? It's not a burden. I don't need specifics. You can just give me the big picture.",
        "Craig: No, just talking about that punk is a waste of wind. What time did you say your appointment was?",
        "Rosanna: Soon. Why?",
        "Craig: I don't want you to be late.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I won't be.",
        "Craig: What about traffic? You know, they've got that construction over on court street.",
        "Rosanna: Craig.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Rosanna: Why are you trying to get rid of me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: And don't be freaked out if you see some lights on in the bedroom while we're gone. I've got one of those timers to make it look like we're home. All right?",
        "Molly: Do you think those really work, Jack? Oh, my God!",
        "Jack: Honey, what are you doing?",
        "Carly: I'm fine. They're not even heavy.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and we are not even leaving until tonight.",
        "Carly: Well, I had a sudden inspiration about that, Jack.",
        "Jack: Okay, there are only two things in this world that truly frighten me. Great white sharks and Carly with a sudden inspiration.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Mike: In that order?",
        "Jack: Not necessarily.",
        "Carly: Hey! Come on. I think you're really gonna like this one. Instead of hanging around Oakdale and waiting till tonight to fly to Cancun, I thought we could get a jump on our honeymoon and get the next flight out.",
        "Jack: I can't believe I'm gonna say this. I love it. What about our reservations?",
        "Carly: Well, I didn't call. I was hoping you would call.",
        "Jack: Okay. I'll call the travel agent when I'm at the station. I gotta go there and clear a few things off my desk.",
        "Carly: Good. And I'll go see Dr. Schiller. And who knows? Maybe we could be in Cancun by sunset.",
        "Jack: Wait a minute. I thought your appointment was this afternoon.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, I switched it. Well, I hate to run out on you guys, but I'm gonna get going --",
        "Molly: Hey, Carly, why don't I go with you? We can shmooze in the waiting room.",
        "Carly: No, there's not gonna be any waiting, really. I'm her first appointment of the day now. So I'll be in and out in --",
        "Molly: Well, no, even better! Then we can hang out after the appointment --",
        "Carly: I am a big girl, actually, Molly. And I don't need you to hover! Thank you very much. So I'm gonna go. And thank you all very much. And -- adios!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I see you every day. I'm about to move into Fairwinds with you. I'm about to marry you and live with you until I leave this planet. How is that getting rid of you?",
        "Rosanna: Don't try to sidestep me, Craig.",
        "Craig: Was it because I stopped kissing you first? If I'm too easy, you'll get tired of me.",
        "Rosanna: I want the truth.",
        "Craig: All right, yes, yes I'm trying to get rid of you.",
        "Rosanna: Why?",
        "Craig: Why? Because there is something that is about to happen that does not exactly require your presence.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then I'm staying.",
        "Craig: It's a surprise, Rosanna! Do you remember those?",
        "Rosanna: Not really.",
        "Craig: Fine! Then stay and destroy what could be a moment of intense happiness, all because you're so insecure you can't even relinquish control of a sneeze.",
        "Rosanna: Can I come back after my appointment?",
        "Craig: Yes! Fine. Perfect. Give my best to Dr. Schiller.",
        "Rosanna: I'll think about it.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Kiss me.",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Katie? Are you still there?",
        "Katie: Rosanna knows when you're lying. You might have to cut back a little.",
        "Craig: What lies? I just say things the way they ought to be. Did you give it a chance to see Lucy back there?",
        "Katie: I sure did, a little. I mean, she was doing her physical therapy when I got there, so --",
        "Craig: How'd she look?",
        "Katie: Like a Montgomery. Very determined.",
        "Craig: That's my baby! As long as she keeps believing, she will improve. [Knock at door] oh! That must be our man. Ah, Mr. Broder! Come on in. Thank you for coming. This is my sister, Katie Frasier. She'll be helping us with my selection.",
        "Mr. Broder: Nice to meet you.",
        "Katie: Likewise. Excuse me. Would you just give us a moment, please? You can still send him away. There's still plenty of time to change your mind about marrying Rosanna.",
        "Craig: You told me you weren't going to do this.",
        "Katie: I know! I can't help it. I slipped. I just want you to think about it a little bit more.",
        "Craig: I am happy. I'm happy in a way I've never been before.",
        "Katie: All right, I'm done. Let's get to it. Whoa! These are huge!",
        "Craig: Oh, Mr. Broder. One of these is going to make a magnificent engagement ring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I know what happens between you and Ben is none of my business. And I know that I have no right to judge you. It's just that I've been caught up in this since the beginning. And I guess I'm finding it a little hard to let go.",
        "Jessica: Well, I understand that. Ben is Isaac's brother, and he will remain in your life.",
        "Bonnie: No, mom, I see the happiness he brings to your life. And I just want you to have that all the time.",
        "Jessica: Oh, honey, so do I. But --",
        "Bonnie: Then why did you walk out on him yesterday, mom? Why create more distance than there has to be?",
        "Jessica: I am so tired of asking Ben to forgive me for the affair with Marshall. You know, either he can't or he won't. Whatever. It's not gonna happen.",
        "Bonnie: Isn't it possible he needs a little more time?",
        "Jessica: I have given him time! I have given him time. I have served my penance. But I can't continue to be in that position. It just makes me weak and miserable. And -- eventually, I'm sure, very unattractive.",
        "Bonnie: Mom, listen to me. There has to be something, something you can do to shake things up. You know? Maybe you could invite him away for the weekend.",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, I can't continue to chase after Ben. And in the end, he has made it absolutely clear that I should just move on. So --",
        "Bonnie: So what? You're just gonna move on to Marshall now?",
        "Jessica: No! Look, there is a connection, okay? And I am going to help him find his daughter. But -- the connection is not romantic.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, right. Not now. You know, mom, I'm sorry. I love Ben. And I think he's right for you. But in the end, I have also learned that you and I aren't gonna always agree on everything.",
        "Jessica: Well, thank goodness. I mean, can you imagine how extremely boring that could get extremely quickly?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. Yeah, I suppose.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bonnie: So will you accept my apology?",
        "Jessica: For what?",
        "Bonnie: Mm, for being a brat. I've had no right to judge you on the choices that you have made for your life.",
        "Jessica: Well -- you're my brat. And I know it's coming from a place of love. And as long as it continues to come from that place, you can tell me or say anything.",
        "Bonnie: Okay. You're my role model, mom. You always have been, and you always will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Good morning, Mr. Travers. How are you feeling today?",
        "Marshall: Much improved, thank you.",
        "John: Any recurrence of the blurred vision?",
        "Marshall: No. My vision's been fine.",
        "Bob: Now, you mentioned that there was some problem with concentration. Any improvement in that area?",
        "Marshall: Some.",
        "Bob: You know, Dr. Ramirez is gonna change your meds. It should improve your mental focus.",
        "Marshall: Okay. When do I start?",
        "Bob: Well, the sooner the better. I'll give you one right now.",
        "Marshall: You know, actually, I was -- I was gonna take a nap.",
        "John: You're sweating, Mr. Travers. You have any shortness of breath?",
        "Marshall: No.",
        "John: Any discomfort in your chest or your arms?",
        "Marshall: No, I'm just warm. That's all.",
        "John: I'm not surprised. You've got the blankets up to your neck, and you're fully dressed.",
        "Bob: He's what? What are you doing?!",
        "Marshall: Look, I told you I need to go to Washington. All right? There's nothing you can do to stop me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Did I just do something to tick you off? Because you just jumped down my throat like I deserved the \"most annoying cousin\" award.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. Let me start again. Molly, I would love it if you would come to Dr. Schiller's office with me.",
        "Molly: Thank you.",
        "Carly: But I would love it even more if you would please stay here and look after Parker for me.",
        "Molly: Oh. Why didn't you just say that in the first place?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just a little bit frazzled about leaving town so quickly. Would you -- would you do that? Would you stay here and look after Parker?",
        "Molly: Absolutely! Hanging with Parker is my second favorite activity.",
        "Carly: Okay. All right. And if I don't see you before I go, I love you, and I'll talk to you soon. Okay?",
        "Parker: Mommy, can I have milk and cookies?",
        "Carly: Well, honey, actually, it's a little bit early for that. But auntie Molly is gonna be watching you, so I guess, technically, it's up to her.",
        "Molly: Good news, Parker. I've got no problem with cookies before noon.",
        "Carly: You see? That's what I thought. You lucked out. You be a good boy. And I'll see you later, okay? Okay.",
        "Jack: Hey, call me after the appointment. I wanna know what's going on.",
        "Carly: Yes, of course. And you call the travel agent. Don't forget. And I don't mind if we have to have a stopover, a layover, whatever, in Dallas or -- I don't care. Okay?",
        "Molly: Carly, hold on. I'll walk you out. Honey, is everything okay? Because you've been acting kind of, you know, jumpy. A little worked up.",
        "Carly: No, I'm -- I'm totally fine. Fine.",
        "Molly: No. I know you better. And there is something else going on.",
        "Carly: Well, you know, you're right. I'm just worried that the honeymoon is gonna be canceled again. But I'll feel better once I'm in the plane, actually leaving Oakdale.",
        "Molly: Okay. If that's really all it is.",
        "Carly: Yes! Yes, it is. But thank you. I gotta go.",
        "Molly: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Molly: Bye.",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Now, I made it very clear to you that you are in no condition to leave this hospital. Your incision hasn't healed. You're disoriented. You could be putting your life in jeopardy.",
        "Marshall: Look -- I can walk. I can talk. All right, I can get a cab around Washington.",
        "John: We can't keep you here against your will, as I'm sure you know. But as your doctors, I would strongly recommend --",
        "Marshall: Listen, Dr. Dixon -- my daughter may have been located in Brazil. All right, the Brazilian Consulate has information I need. I can't do anything here.",
        "John: You know, I'm very aware of your situation. My daughter, Margo Hughes, has been working with Jessica Griffin on this -- on this problem. She tells me that Jessica is going to go to Washington on your behalf. So if you don't have to jeopardize your life, I don't see why you would.",
        "Marshall: I can't let Jessica do that, all right?",
        "Jessica: Oh, really? Why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, I gotta head to the station. Uh -- Mike, does -- Carly seem all right to you?",
        "Mike: I think she's just excited about spending some time alone with her husband. About that. There's excited, and then there's -- I don't know what you call it. Frantic? Maybe she's nervous about traveling, you know?",
        "Jack: Doesn't sound like Carly. Anyway, I'll have to get over it. Hey, did you see the picture of the sonogram yet?",
        "Mike: No.",
        "Jack: It's amazing. You see this little creature, and you go, \"this is what I'm gonna send to college.\" You know?",
        "Mike: Well, you got it around? I'd like to take a look at it.",
        "Jack: No, it's packed. I was gonna study it on the beach in Cancun.",
        "Mike: All right. Well, I'll look at it when you get back.",
        "Jack: Hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Thanks for looking after the house. I'll see you in a week.",
        "Molly: Hey! You would not believe what Parker is building up there. It is complete with drive-ins, restaurants. He is definitely gonna be an architect.",
        "Mike: I hope so. I could use the work.",
        "Molly: Jack leave?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen a man so happy to be having a child.",
        "Molly: Why? What did he do?",
        "Mike: He said he's bringing the sonogram with him to Mexico so he can study it on the beach. Like that's gonna tell him a whole lot.",
        "[Molly remembering]",
        "Molly: I just want you to be prepared, okay? Because with all the prenatal visits and all the technology these days, it's gonna be really hard to keep that a secret. And when the real due date comes out, it's gonna be really tough to keep some people from doing the math.",
        "Carly: Rosanna.",
        "Molly: Yeah. She might not like what the new-and-improved due date suggests about her hubby-to-be, Craig Montgomery.",
        "Mike: Molly -- what's the matter? You jealous that we're not going to Mexico, too?",
        "Molly: No. I think it's great they're getting away. I think nobody deserves a break more than Carly and Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: You know, Jack has been a friend of mine for a very long time, Emily. And there's a responsibility in that. And now that I know that Carly spent the night with somebody else the night before they were married --",
        "Emily: Oh, wait, wait, wait --",
        "Hal: -- I am lying to the guy if I don't wise him up.",
        "Emily: We've been over this. All right? It is entirely possible that Carly is carrying Jack's baby. We don't know anything for sure, so why break the guy's heart for nothing?",
        "Hal: If you were cheating on me, I would want a friend to let me know about it.",
        "Emily: Well, thanks for the tip. I'll be sure to keep your friends out of the loop.",
        "Hal: There's nothing funny in this for me, Emily. If I sense that Jack is about to be blind-sided here, I have to tell him what I know. Now, I'm sorry if that's not what you want him to hear.",
        "Emily: All right, wait a minute. Can you just -- can you remember that Jack's going on his honeymoon tonight, Hal?",
        "Hal: I will.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Emily: Who is it?",
        "Carly: Carly.",
        "Emily: Carly -- please tell me Hal didn't see you.",
        "Carly: No. I saw his car was still here, so I stayed out of sight until he left.",
        "Emily: Well, very smart girl, because he's the last person you wanna run into.",
        "Carly: You said that he figured things out. How much does he know, exactly?",
        "Emily: Everything. Except Mike's the father.",
        "Carly: Oh, God. This is getting worse by the hour. Henry Coleman and Craig, even Katie and Simon know. Molly and Rosanna think that I slept with Craig but that Jack is the baby's father. But now, Molly has seen the picture from the sonogram, and she can tell the fetus is more than two months along. If any of these people talk to each other, if Hal questions even one of them, it'll all be over. Everything I've ever wanted -- gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Broder: Please. Take a look.",
        "Katie: Wow!",
        "Craig: Oh. Those are magnificent. Especially --",
        "Katie: Hmm-mm. No. No. Mm-hmm.",
        "Craig: Oh, it's a sale, Mr. Broder. I'll come by later to settle up.",
        "Mr. Broder: No hurry. You're a good customer. My best of luck to you, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Oh, thank you very much. Okay.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Katie: If Rosanna doesn't like this, dump her.",
        "Craig: No. I am committed to her.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. Of course you are. Although commitment means something different to you than it does to everybody else.",
        "Craig: There is no agenda this time, my friend. I am gonna stay with Rosanna as long as she'll have me.",
        "Katie: Yeah, there's one other thing I wanted to talk to you about. What about Carly?",
        "Craig: Hmm?",
        "Katie: Being your sister-in-law?",
        "Craig: Ah, it's meaningless. Jack can solve her problems for awhile.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, Carly's problems aren't gonna go away that easily.",
        "Craig: What do you know about Carly's problems?",
        "Katie: Oh, nothing. No, nothing. I was just -- it was just a comment.",
        "Craig: You're sure?",
        "Katie: Uh -- hey. I thought Carly didn't interest you anymore.",
        "Craig: She doesn't. And I have this to give to Rosanna.",
        "Katie: So, have you decided how you're gonna propose?",
        "Craig: I've already proposed. I'm just gonna hold this out to her and say, \"this is for you.\" Huh?",
        "Katie: Oh, that's -- no. No, no, no, no, no. Being proposed to is one of the biggest moments in a woman's life. You can't just hand it to her. It has to be an event.",
        "Craig: Okay. How?",
        "Katie: Leave it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Well, thank you so much for being patient. I didn't realize I had so many questions about my hysterectomy.",
        "Dr. Schiller: That's what I'm here for. So you can ask whatever you need to.",
        "Rosanna: When should I set my next appointment? One week, two weeks?",
        "Dr. Schiller: You're healing beautifully. I won't have to see you again for at least six weeks.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Well, not that I don't enjoy your company, doctor.",
        "Dr. Schiller: I understand. Looks like I'll be seeing your sister again before I see you.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's possible. How is she doing?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Very well. But now that she's entering her second trimester, I'll need to see her more often. I have an appointment downstairs. I'm pleased you're doing so well.",

        "Carly: Jack and I - we just found out we're gonna have a baby.",
        "Craig: Mike Kasnoff was not with Carly that night.",
        "Rosanna: And you know this because?",
        "Craig: Because - I was.",
        "Rosanna: The second trimester. Well, then that baby's father isn't Jack. It's Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: So, what's going on here, doctors? Did the hospital run out of hospital gowns?",
        "John: No, he just sleeps with his clothes on. He seems to think he's on his way to Washington.",
        "Marshall: I am. Look -- Dr. Hughes, let me have one of those pills? I think I'm gonna pass on this nap.",
        "John: We've tried to explain to Mr. Travers that he should stay here at least a few more days. But we don't seem to be getting through to him.",
        "Jessica: Mind if I give it a try?",
        "Bob: Be my guest. It is the recommendation of this hospital that you remain under our care. Now, if you choose to ignore that, we will not be responsible for anything that happens.",
        "John: Good luck.",
        "Marshall: Understood. Whatever speech you're about to make, save it. There's nothing wrong with taking my life back from the doctors.",
        "Jessica: There is if it'll kill you.",
        "Marshall: Look -- you know, they're just covering themselves. I probably could've left here yesterday.",
        "Jessica: Okay, well, what is this about you not letting me go to Washington for you?",
        "Marshall: I'm letting you off the hook.",
        "Jessica: It was my idea, Marshall. You didn't pressure me. Yesterday, we agreed that I would go.",
        "Marshall: I can't do this to you, Jessica. I won't force you to choose between me and Ben Harris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: If Jack finds out, he'll be finished with me. And Mike will want to step up and take responsibility. So he and Molly will split, and then Molly will hate me. And Rosanna, who already hates me --",
        "Emily: Would you stop doing this to yourself?",
        "Carly: I can't help it! My entire life could come crashing down around me at any moment.",
        "Emily: Well, that is not gonna happen today. Because you, my dear, are getting out of town. Okay? So try thinking about that. Think about your honeymoon. You know, your honeymoon bed with your handsome husband, laying there with the breezes rustling the curtains.",
        "Carly: Do you think that you could come along with us? Just to hold me together?",
        "Emily: Sweetie, you're gonna do that all by yourself. Right?",
        "Carly: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You know what we need to do? We need to fill up this thing with dirt. Do we have any dirt around here, or should we just pretend?",
        "Parker: I got it.",
        "Mike: Okay. Don't get it from the flower pots. Your mom will kill me. Should I go get him?",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "Molly: No. It's okay. Carly makes these little bean bags, and he uses them. You know, pretends they're other things.",
        "Mike: Oh, that's a nice trick. I'll have to remember that when I have a kid. That wasn't a hint.",
        "Molly: No. I didn't think it was. But I do think you're gonna make a great daddy.",
        "Mike: I feel the same way about you. Mother, not --",
        "Molly: Yeah, I got it.",
        "Mike: You know what I'm saying.",
        "Parker: Here's the sand!",
        "Mike: Oh, you are the man! Here we go, right here. You gonna fill up that truck? All right. Did you give any thought about buying your apartment back from Rosanna?",
        "Molly: Some. But -- I'm not gonna do that.",
        "Mike: Why not?",
        "Molly: Because it's not home anymore.",
        "Mike: It could be.",
        "Molly: Why do you say that?",
        "Mike: Well -- if you wanted to be there, for any reason, I'd be willing to move in with you.",
        "Molly: You are so incredibly sweet. But I know how much you love living by the lake.",
        "Mike: Not as much as I love you. All right! There we go. You know what you do now? You need to give this thing some elevation? So make it a little higher. You know what that is? You know what elevation is? It's height. Height. There you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: The carrier pigeon idea is okay. And the thought of dropping it in a mutual bubble bath has possibilities. But nothing is really grabbing me here, Katie. So thank you, anyway.",
        "Katie: No, that's okay. I have a million other ideas.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. [Craig chuckles] that's all right. I think that I will just hand it to Rosanna, and we will have a beautiful moment together.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on, Craig! That is so boring!",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Katie: You can do much better.",
        "Craig: I am inherently exciting, and nothing is ever boring with Rosanna. One never knows what she's going to do or say next.",
        "Rosanna: How could you do this to me?",
        "Katie: I see what you mean. I have a feeling you two need to be alone. Ciao.",
        "Craig: What happened?",
        "Rosanna: A baby is what happened. Carly is carrying your child.",
        "Craig: No, that's not true.",
        "Rosanna: Please do not try to insult me by denying it. I found out from Dr. Schiller that Carly is in her second trimester. Which means that she is three months pregnant, which, if I am not mistaken, is when you slept with her.",
        "Craig: That's -- that's impossible.",
        "Rosanna: Why? Because it would be inconvenient for you to have fathered a child with Carly while you're planning on marrying me?",
        "Craig: No. Because I didn't sleep with Carly that night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You serious? There's no charge for the changing of the tickets? Well, hey, great! You just became my all-time favorite airline person. [Jack laughs] no, don't worry. I guarantee we'll be there early. Thanks. Bye.",
        "Hal: 'Morning. How are things in the world of law enforcement today?",
        "Jack: Bad, Hal, real bad.",
        "Hal: What happened?",
        "Jack: Well, you see these case files? Suddenly, they're all yours.",
        "Hal: How come?",
        "Jack: Because in approximately three hours, I'm going to be in on a plane flying to Cancun.",
        "Hal: I thought you were leaving tonight.",
        "Jack: Yeah, Carly's idea. She couldn't wait to get out of here. I couldn't come up with a reason not to. You okay? What's happening with Will?",
        "Hal: Oh, he's fine. I had breakfast with him this morning.",
        "Jack: Hm, Emily?",
        "Hal: She's with your wife at the doctor's.",
        "Jack: She is? Carly didn't mention anything about that.",
        "Hal: Well, you know pregnant women, they can be very forgetful.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm glad she's got company. Carly's been wound so tight lately, I've never seen anyone more ready for a vacation.",
        "Hal: Jack, I need to talk to you about something.",
        "Jack: Anything, pal, shoot.",
        "Hal: It's about Carly and the baby.",
        "Jack: Except that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Do you think Hal is going to be here?",
        "Emily: Will you stop it? He's at the station.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe he made an appointment and he didn't tell you? If he sees me, it's going to get ugly.",
        "Emily: Will you relax? Hal's not going to do anything to ruin your honeymoon with Jack. So just relax.",
        "Carly: Okay. I will try real hard to believe that.",
        "Emily: All right, just tell me about your honeymoon. What's your hotel room like?",
        "Carly: Well, it's supposed to be nice. But at this point, I'm --",
        "Dr. Schiller: Carly, hi. I'm running a few minutes behind. I hope you can wait.",
        "Carly: Oh, um -- maybe I should reschedule then?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Was there a specific reason why you wanted to see me this morning?",
        "Carly: Well, Jack and I are finally going on our honeymoon. And I just wanted to have a checkup first.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Oh, really? I'm surprised your sister didn't mention that to me this morning.",
        "Carly: You saw Rosanna today?",
        "Dr. Schiller: It was a follow-up to her operation. Naturally, your name came up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Now, this may come as a disappointment to you, but my memory is still functioning. You told me you slept with Carly the night before her wedding.",
        "Craig: That was a lie.",
        "Rosanna: Oh! It would be psychotic to lie about that. What possible advantage could that have for you?",
        "Craig: It's complicated. Can I explain?",
        "Rosanna: No. You slept with Carly. She got pregnant. She couldn't have anybody find out. So you ask me to marry you to sort of cover the whole thing up.",
        "Craig: That is not true.",
        "Rosanna: Meanwhile, she softened me up by asking me to be auntie to her baby, meanwhile, dropping the information that she was only 8 weeks instead of 12 weeks pregnant.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, I think you're heading off in the wrong direction.",
        "Rosanna: The only question I have is, how long have you two been coordinating all of this? Did you have daily meetings? Did you script it all beforehand?",
        "Craig: No, but if you'll --",
        "Rosanna: Have you been sleeping with her? Is that what's been going on? You been going from my bed to hers? Hers to mine? Are you so corroded inside you can actually get some pleasure from that?",
        "Craig: No! To all of that!",
        "Rosanna: It doesn't matter. Don't call me. Don't try to contact me. From now on, you have ceased to exist for me. Get out of my way.",
        "Craig: I am not letting you go.",
        "Rosanna: Fine, I'll call security.",
        "Craig: You are not going to leave until you hear what I have to say. And then if you want to leave, you may leave.",
        "Rosanna: Fine. Talk.",
        "Craig: I wasn't with Carly that night. I had already left with Hal to go find Lucy.",
        "Rosanna: You said you caught up with him later.",
        "Craig: That was the first lie.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I -- I just can't believe I'm even standing here listening to this?",
        "Craig: You want me to call Hal? He'll tell you. He's not going to lie to protect me.",
        "Rosanna: Why would you claim to cheat on me when you didn't?",
        "Craig: Carly -- she was desperate, wanted to be rescued. And I saw a way to do that.",
        "Rosanna: At my expense.",
        "Craig: Mine too. But I hoped you'd forgive me.",
        "Rosanna: Do you know who Carly actually did sleep with that night?",
        "Craig: Mike Kasnoff.",
        "Rosanna: So I was right from the beginning. How long have you known?",
        "Craig: About Mike, a while. The baby, a couple of days.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I can't imagine anyone feeling like a bigger fool than I do at the moment.",
        "Craig: I do. I do. I should never have gotten involved. I'm so sorry.",
        "Rosanna: I think I just need to be alone.",
        "Craig: I understand. I do -- I do love you.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. You just don't know how.",
        "Mike: Hello?",
        "Rosanna: It's Rosanna. I need you to meet me at Java. No excuses, no delays.",
        "Mike: That's kind of short notice, Rosanna. You want to tell me what this is all about?",
        "[Molly clears throat]",
        "Molly: Mike?",
        "Mike: Hold on a second, Molly wants to talk to you.",
        "Molly: Hi, it's Molly. I want to talk to you about my apartment.",
        "Rosanna: Must we?",
        "Molly: It'll only take a second, Rosanna. You know I really thank you for the offer, but I'm not going to buy back my place because Mike and I are really very happy at the lake. And that's exactly where we're going to stay.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm just thrilled for you. Will you please put Mike back on?",
        "Molly: Sure. She's not done with you.",
        "Mike: It's me.",
        "Rosanna: Meet me at Java. If you don't, there will be no mercy for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: You know, I'm at least partially responsible for you and Ben being on the outs. That's not to say that I have any regrets, because I don't. But you can't love him and help me, too.",
        "Jessica: I said that I would help you find your daughter, and that's really all you need to be concerned about.",
        "Marshall: Jessica, you've told me on numerous occasions how much you care for Ben. I want you to have what makes you happy. That's why I'm cutting you loose -- for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Look, I know how you feel, because I feel the same way. Julia's gone. J.J.'s back with his real parents. And somehow, out of all that, I wound up with the one thing I always wanted -- a child of my own. Carly and I have walked through fire together, and we came out of it closer than ever. I'm the luckiest man in the world, and if I had a brain in my head, I'd better appreciate it. Hmm? Am I close? Is that just about what you were gonna sum up?",
        "Hal: Yep. That was it.",
        "Jack: Well, thanks anyway.",

        "Molly: Craig? Is that you? What are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna is very excited about becoming an auntie again. Yeah, she must have been going on and on about all the things she's gonna do for the new baby.",
        "Dr. Schiller: No, we didn't get into that.",
        "Carly: Well, how exactly did my name come up?",
        "Dr. Schiller: I told Rosanna that she was healing well and would be having fewer appointments in the future, as opposed to you, who will be having more now that you're in the second trimester. Is there a problem?",
        "Carly: No. No, everything's fine.",
        "Dr. Schiller: Good. I'll see you in my office in a few minutes.",
        "Carly: Okay. Rosanna knows.",
        "Emily: No, not necessarily. Just calm down, all right? Let's sit down and --",
        "Carly: No, I can't sit down, Emily! I have to stop my sister from destroying my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: What's this all about?",
        "Rosanna: Well, congratulations, Mike, the magic is still there.",
        "Mike: No riddles, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: You got Carly pregnant again.",
        "Mike: What the hell is the matter with you?",
        "Rosanna: I know you slept with her. Craig told me about the big cover-up.",
        "Mike: That doesn't mean the baby's mine.",
        "Rosanna: It does if she's three months pregnant. And I'm not guessing, I spoke to her doctor.",
        "Mike: There has got to be some kind of mistake, because I spoke to Carly and she said there's no way --",
        "Rosanna: Well, she lied. Because she knows the baby isn't Jack's. So why aren't you smiling? You're going to be a daddy."
