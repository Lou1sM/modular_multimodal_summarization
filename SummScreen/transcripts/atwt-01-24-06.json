        "Gwen and Will reluctantly separate in order to have a place to stay. Gwen then pleads for Lisa to give her a job, which Lisa does. Maddie pretends to be Casey under his comforter when Margo comes into Casey's room to see if he is home from his party by curfew. Margo happily talks to Maddie, thinking he is Casey, telling him she is thrilled he is following the rules. Casey almost gets caught coming in through the window. Maddie lets him in, and then Casey suggests she stay longer under the pretense that she shouldn't leave until his parents go to sleep. Jack and Carly have a fight about why she didn't tell him that Nick was the one who helped her when she fell. Carly alleviates his fears by assuring Jack he is the only one for her. Later, when Hal calls Jack in to give him his input on the Paul Ryan case, Carly is convinced that is a good sign. Paul convinces Meg to go eavesdrop to find out what the police think. Nick finds the evidence Paul and Meg planted, and is convinced the bloody shirt, gun and car in the river proves Paul committed suicide. Jack is not so sure; he thinks it is too easy, and without a body they should assume Paul is alive, but Hal wants the case closed, which causes Jack and Hal to butt heads. Jack wonders if Hal wants the case closed and Paul dead so he can have another shot at Emily, which infuriates Hal. Hal tells Nick he has until tomorrow and then the case is closed. A frustrated Jack leaves with Carly hot on his heels. Meg reports back to Paul what she has heard and Paul can only hope Nick has more pull with Hal then Jack, and based on their argument, he might get his wish."

        "Gwen: You'd really give us a room? For free?",
        "Lisa: Well, what I meant was --",
        "Will: What she meant is she'd give you a room, not to us. I guess we've found someone else who doesn't think we should be together.",
        "Lisa: Please don't take this the wrong way. But when you run a hotel you have to maintain a certain level of --",
        "Will: Lisa, you don't have to explain. Really, I understand. I get the point.",
        "Kim: Honey, you can come and stay with us. Then that way you both have a warm bed.",
        "Will: I appreciate the offer, really I do, but it's just another way of saying we should split up. Gwen, are you ready to go?",
        "Gwen: I don't know, Will. Maybe we should think about this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Casey? You still up? Case? Still not back yet. Must've been some party. And you are so busted. Mr. Goodtime Casey.",
        "Margo: Tom, I'll be right there. I just want to check in on Casey, see how the party went.",
        "[Maddie hides under Casey's blankets.]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why would you keep something like that from me, Carly?",
        "Carly: I just didn't think it was a big deal, Jack.",
        "Jack: You twisted your ankle and Nick Kasnoff was there to help you out. Only you told me Mike helped you out. That's a pretty big change of story in my book.",
        "Carly: Mike did help me. He helped me to my car. And the reason I didn't mention Nick is because I didn't want you to get upset, or make a big problem.",
        "Jack: It seems to me Nick is the only one causing problems. And it's about time somebody straightened him out.",
        "Carly: See, this is exactly what I mean. I didn't want to give you a reason to fly off the handle.",
        "Jack: What were you really doing at the police station?",
        "Carly: I told you. I needed to see you, I need to talk to you about the blowup that I had with Gwen.",
        "Jack: Only when you didn't see me there, why didn't you just leave?",
        "Carly: I did, that's what I was trying to do when I fell and hurt my ankle, Jack.",
        "Jack: And you just happened to fall right into Nick Kasnoff's arms?",
        "Carly: If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were jealous.",
        "Jack: No, I'm just sick of that guy finding ways to spend more time with you than he has any right to. And it's going to end tonight.",
        "Carly: Come on, sweetie. Nick just happened to be there. I didn't want his help. All I wanted was you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: So the car was pushed in, right?",
        "Cop #2: Sure looks that way from the tire tracks.",
        "Nick: And it was definitely Paul Ryan's car. Okay, we've got to move fast. Tell your search team to comb the riverbank on both sides, start from the car's entry and moving downstream. Maybe we'll get lucky and find something more.",
        "Cop #2: Yes, sir.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: How do you feel?",
        "Paul: Like somebody took a blowtorch to my body.",
        "Meg: You should've stayed put.",
        "Paul: You were gone for a long time, I started to worry about you.",
        "Meg: Here, take one of these.",
        "Paul: You think the cops are going to believe I'm dead?",
        "Meg: That depends on whether they find the evidence you left. It's dark. They're tired. Maybe they've even called off the search until tomorrow.",
        "Paul: They'll find the evidence. They have to.",
        "Meg: If you don't start taking care of yourself, they're going to find a body as well.",
        "Paul: You're starting to sound like you actually care.",
        "Meg: I care all right. If you die, I don't get paid. It's in our mutual interest for you to stay alive.",
        "Paul: And for the cops to believe I'm dead. Meg, there's one little thing that I'm going to need you to do for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, I know we wanted to stay together. And the last thing I want is to be away from you even for one night. But I can't go back out there. I thought I could take it, but I can't.",
        "Will: Ok, we'll find someplace else to stay. Some place that won't give us a hard time about staying together.",
        "Kim: Why don't we give them a chance to talk about this?",
        "Lisa: Yeah, sure. Gwen, the offer still holds.",
        "Kim: Will, so does mine, honey.",
        "Will: The last thing I want to do is put you through hell just to prove a point. But there has to be another solution to this that doesn't involve splitting up.",
        "Gwen: We have no money, Will. No car. All we have is a couple of blankets and our pick of benches to pick from for the night.",
        "Will: I don't care where I sleep, as long as you're next to me. I don't expect you to feel the same way.",
        "Gwen: I want to say that I can take it. But I'm freezing out there. I don't know if I can last all night.",
        "Will: It's okay. I understand.",
        "Gwen: It's just that ever since I left my mom's, I did everything I could to prove I could make it on my own. And now to end up on the street, I don't know, I just feel like I've failed. Maybe I can't look at that.",
        "Will: Gwen, you don't have to explain, I told you that. You've been through a lot, a lot happened to you, things that you had no control over.",
        "Gwen: But they happened to me. I dragged you into it, and that's my fault.",
        "Will: Gwen, I love you. And I'm here because I want to be. Good or bad, I'm staying.",
        "Gwen: I love you, too. But this isn't about that.",
        "Will: Yes it is, that's all that matters. If we throw that away, then they win. Is that what you want? You want my parents to win.",
        "Gwen: No. But I don't want the circumstances to break us, either.",
        "Will: They won't.",
        "Gwen: Okay, but we have to come up with a plan. We can't keep going from one dead end to the other. So I'm going to take the room. You go stay with your Aunt and Uncle. Just for a few days, until we can come up with a plan.",
        "Will: Okay.",
        "Gwen: Think of it this way. Everybody is trying to split us up. Let's use this to prove they that can't.",
        "Will: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Gwen: You mean it?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I trust you, Carly. That's not the problem.",
        "Carly: The problem is Nick Kasnoff. I know that. But you can't let him get to you like that.",
        "Jack: I'm trying not to. But every time I turn around, he's there. At my job, at my desk, he's putting the moves on my wife now.",
        "Carly: Wait a minute, it's not quite like that.",
        "Jack: You know what I mean.",
        "Carly: And you know what I mean. Nick Kasnoff can use all the charm all he wants to. He's still going to keep running into the same brick wall. I have everything I want right here. Don't you know that?",
        "Jack: Yes, of course I do.",
        "Carly: Then don't let him make you so crazy. Jack, he's a joke. Just laugh it off.",
        "Jack: I wish I could. But you don't see him at work. Like he's the next greatest thing. He's sloppy. He's unfocused. He's out for glory, and he doesn't care who he tramples over to get it.",
        "Carly: Well, he's going to end up paying for that. Guys like that always do. Eventually, Hal will realize that he made a mistake. Nick will be gone and you'll be back right back where you belong.",
        "Jack: I hope so. Listen, I'm not one to wish bad on people, I'm not. It's just that this guy is trouble waiting to happen.",
        "Carly: All right, then let it happen on its own. Just quit letting it make you nuts.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Jack: Snyder.",
        "Hal: Hey, Jack, it's Hal.",
        "Jack: Hey Hal. What's going on?",
        "Hal: We've picked up a new trail on Paul Ryan, and some new evidence about what might have happened to him.",
        "Jack: Kasnoff is making progress then, huh?",
        "Hal: Maybe. But I want your take on it, though. Can you come in and talk over what we've got?",
        "Jack: Yeah, sure. I'll be right there. They've found new evidence in the search for Paul. Hal wants me to take a look at it.",
        "Carly: That's great, honey.",
        "Jack: I guess so, yeah.",
        "Carly: Well it's obvious what this means. That Hal doesn't trust Nick Kasnoff completely. He needs advice from a man that he really trusts.",
        "Jack: Or maybe he just needs another set of eyes so things don't fall through the cracks.",
        "Carly: No, I don't think so. I think this is the beginning of the end of Nick Kasnoff. I just wish that I could be there to watch him fall.",
        "Jack: Forget it. You're not. You're not coming with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I need to know if the cops believe that I killed myself.",
        "Meg: I think you're jumping the gun. They probably haven't even have found the evidence yet.",
        "Paul: Well, I need to know if they have. And if so, what they make of it.",
        "Meg: So you want me to go back and snoop around at the crime scene again? Look, they already caught me once. What am I supposed to do this time? Lurk behind the trees and hope i overhear someone say, \"Oh yeah, definitely looks like a suicide?\"",
        "Paul: Well, that would be a lucky break.",
        "Meg: Paul, if I get caught this time, it's going to look pretty bad. They're not going to believe I'm out on another midnight stroll. They're going to think I'm up to something. And then your whole plan will be shot.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I guess you're right. You can't go back down there. Guess I'll just have to go myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: No offense or anything. I'm just going to do my job.",
        "Carly: Fine. Okay, I understand.",
        "Jack: You do? Promise me you're not going to show up in an hour.",
        "Carly: I promise. Now go and knock them dead. And get Nick away from your desk.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Jack: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.",
        "Carly: All right. But have a good feeling about this, Jack. I got a really good feeling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #2: You figure that's Ryan's?",
        "Nick: I'm betting on it. As soon as we get it tested and compared, but we're getting close. We got a car. We got a piece of clothing full of DNA. Now all we need is a body. Or maybe -- maybe we don't even need that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I need to find out if the cops believe that I killed myself or not.",
        "Meg: What if you get caught? Then it's over. Why can't you just wait until tomorrow?",
        "Paul: Because, look, it's not like I'm gonna be able to sleep. I need to know now.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Paul: Meg, if the cops don't believe that I've committed suicide, then they're going to start to think that maybe somebody else shot me. They're going to start asking questions.",
        "Meg: So that's it you're protecting Emily.",
        "Paul: And you, too. It wouldn't take much for Detective Kasnoff to start to think that maybe you had a motive for killing me. He may think that already.",
        "Meg: Good point.",
        "Paul: You told him yourself you hated my guts.",
        "Meg: The way things are, if I get pegged for killing you, I'd probably win big points back in town.",
        "Paul: But you don't get my money and the chance to disappear.",
        "Meg: Good point number two. You're on a roll, Ryan.",
        "Paul: I just don't want you, or Emily, or anybody else to be hurt any more than they already have been hurt.",
        "Meg: Where did this sudden selflessness come from?",
        "Paul: Everybody should have a chance to move on. And they can't do that if someone is looking for me.",
        "Meg: Okay fine. You win. You convinced me. I'll try and see what I can find out.",
        "Paul: How? You said yourself, it's too risky for you to go back the scene.",
        "Meg: Yeah, but there are other ways to get info. You do have to promise me one thing, though, okay? Do not, under any circumstances, leave the cabin. You need to rest, okay. Don't try and follow me this time. I'm counting on you to pull through this.",
        "Paul: Well, I'm counting on you, too.",
        "Meg: Come here. You know, who would've thought that you and I need each other so much.",
        "Paul: Another one of life's little twists, I guess",
        "Meg: I'll be back as soon as I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, wow, home with time to spare. Good for you, Casey. You know, I remember when you would come home from a party or from a game at school and you just had to stay up and had tell me all about it. Guess those days are over. My boy done growed up. All right, all right. I get the hint, I get it. Listen, Casey, thank you so much for sticking to the rules tonight. I know that you're trying really hard to make everything right again, and I'm proud of you. So is your dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Okay, look, Kim had to go. But she asked me just to tell you that if you make the decision to be with her, she will be happy to swing back around here and pick you up and take you home.",
        "Will: That's not necessary. I'll get there myself.",
        "Lisa: Oh, well, good. Then that means the two of you are taking us up on our offers?",
        "Will: Yeah, but just for the time being. Gwen will stay here, and I'm going to go stay with Aunt Kim.",
        "Lisa: I think that's the smart choice. You know, living together can be very difficult at any age. I'm very happy to see the two of you have decided to think it out a little.",
        "Will: That's not why we're doing this. We still plan on being together full- time, but until we figure out how to do that, Gwen doesn't deserve to be on the street.",
        "Lisa: Well, no, of course not, no one does. Do you want me to get your room ready?",
        "Gwen: Could you actually hold off on that for just one sec?",
        "Will: Gwen, I thought we just decided --",
        "Gwen: Look, a couple of nights in a room isn't going to solve the bigger problem. We're still broke. That's not going to miraculously going to go away today, or the day after that. We still need to find a way to get some money.",
        "Lisa: You're asking for a handout as well?",
        "Gwen: No. I don't want a handout at all. I want a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #5: Hey, Jack, what's up?",
        "Jack: Not a lot. Is Hal around?",
        "Cop #5: He might be out in the field with Detective Kasnoff.",
        "Jack: New developments?",
        "Cop #5: They found Ryan's car, and some bloody clothing. And the gun I think.",
        "Jack: I guess Kasnoff knows what he's doing after all.",
        "Meg: Hey, Jack.",
        "Jack: Meg. Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were out in the woods communing with nature or something.",
        "Meg: I was trying to until I was interrupted by the OPD. Twice. Did that cop just say they found Paul's car?",
        "Jack: Yeah, looks that way.",
        "Meg: What do you think that means happened to Paul?",
        "Jack: I know about as much as you do, Meg.",
        "Meg: But still, his car, blood evidence, that doesn't look too good. Do you think Paul died?",
        "Jack: I don't have an opinion yet. But I do have a question. Why are you so interested?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Just give her time. Meg will do okay.",
        "[Paul dreaming]",
        "Jack: I'm serious, Meg. Why are you so curious about what's going on with Paul?",
        "Meg: Come on Jack, it's no big mystery. I get a visit from a Detective who tells me that he thinks that what went down with Paul happened to take place right where I'm staying. Is it so strange that I want to know if you found anything?",
        "Nick: Oh, save it, Ms. Snyder. I'm on to you.",
        "Meg: That sounds ominous. What do you mean?",
        "Nick: It means that I know you've been helping Paul hide out in your cabin. And you been feeding him medicine that you stole from the hospital. You've been helping him out for days. And that's called aiding and abetting.",
        "Meg: No, it's called crazy and unproven.",
        "Nick: Oh, I've got more than enough evidence, Meg. I even know that you helped him fake his own death. Did you really think you could fool us just by planting a gun and a piece of his shirt?",
        "Meg: I'm still waiting to hear the proof.",
        "Nick: You'll hear plenty of it, don't worry. And so will a jury.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Oh, come on, Jack. Wouldn't you be curious if you were in my shoes?",
        "Jack: I can understand why you have a vested interest. You, Paul and Emily got into a lot of trouble for lying to Jennifer about her baby. It's why you pretty much lost everything, isn't it?",
        "Meg: Yeah and I hate Paul because of it. That's why I'd like to know that I've seen the last of him.",
        "Jack: You're not alone there.",
        "Meg: Look, Jack, I'm not happy about the things I did. I hate what we did to Jennifer. And I wish I could change all that, but I can't.",
        "Jack: So instead you're up in the woods, meditating? Trying to regroup?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm trying to clear my mind, make some decisions about my future.",
        "Jack: Is it working?",
        "Meg: Yeah. I think I'm going to leave town for a little while.",
        "Jack: Did your friend help you out with that decision?",
        "Meg: What friend?",
        "Jack: The one who owns the cabin.",
        "Meg: Oh. No. I came up with it all on my own.",
        "Jack: Ok, that's good. Who owns that place, anyway?",
        "Meg: No one you'd know. Anyway, I came to talk to Detective Kasnoff, personally. Is he around?",
        "Jack: No, he's not. I can give him a message.",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah. Can you tell him that I don't appreciate being harassed by him or his men that I went out for some peace and quiet and I feel like I'm cornered and interrogated every time I take a walk. Just, tell him to be leave me alone.",
        "Nick: I heard her loud and clear. And from what I just found, you're going to have plenty peace and quiet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly imagining]",
        "Nick: Lieutenant, if you'd just let me explain --",
        "Hal: I don't want to hear your excuses, Nick. You blew it. You had Paul Ryan right under your nose and if Jack hadn't stepped in at the last moment, he would have gotten away.",
        "Nick: You're right. Jack did put it all together. I don't know how I made such a bad call. I guess there is a lot I got to learn from you.",
        "Jack: I was just trying to help out.",
        "Hal: You did more than that, Jack. You broke the case. I want you back on the team full time.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Hal: The job's yours if you want it. What do you say?",
        "Jack: Yes, of course I want it. Carly said this was going to happen but I didn't believe her.",
        "Hal: Well, you should have.",
        "Jack: She never lost faith. I wish she was here tonight. This is her moment, too.",
        "Carly: I should be there with you, Jack. I gotta be there with you. Hi. Hi, Mrs. Lebo, it's Carly. I know it's really late but do you think you could come over and just sit in the house with the kids for a little bit? Something really important's come up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Exactly what kind of peace and quiet are you talking about? Because I don't seem to be getting it from you or your men.",
        "Nick: Well, that's all about to change. The search for Paul Ryan's over.",
        "Jack: You found him?",
        "Nick: We found what was left of him. His car was dumped in the river and I had found a gun and a piece of a man's shirt down by the water's edge. Forensics is testing it right now. I'd be surprised if the results didn't tie directly back to Paul.",
        "Meg: And prove what?",
        "Nick: That he shot himself.",
        "Jack: Suicide?",
        "Nick: There was one set of prints on the gun. A single bullet was fired from it. And there were bullet fragments on the shirt.",
        "Jack: All that proves, Nick, is that a gun was fired and someone was shot.",
        "Nick: He had every reason to commit suicide. He was cut off from everybody he loved. And he was on the run. He knew eventually we were gonna get him.",
        "Jack: That just goes to show that you have now idea who Paul Ryan is. He's not the suicidal type.",
        "Meg: You're not buying it?",
        "Jack: It doesn't matter. It's not my case.",
        "Hal: Oh, Jack, good. Thanks for coming in.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well I'm glad I can give my perspective on things.",
        "Nick: What things?",
        "Hal: I wanted Jack to take a look at the evidence you found. I'm not taking anything for granted on this one. As far as I'm concerned, until I'm looking at his body, Paul Ryan is still alive and out there somewhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paul dreaming]",
        "Hal: Surround the house! Open up! I didn't think you were really dead. I'm glad. Because now I have the satisfaction of killing you myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: It's really cold in here. Oh, no wonder. Goodnight, Casey. Sleep tight.",
        "[Margo leaves the room.]",
        "[Knocking on window] [Maggie opens the window.]",
        "Maddie: Well, look who finally decided to come home.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I lost track of time.",
        "Maddie: I bet. It must've been a hell of a party. Your mom thinks you're sound asleep.",
        "Casey: Oh, thanks.",
        "Maddie: Oh, your welcome. Except it almost didn't work. She was actually sitting there talking to me. I was freaking out.",
        "Casey: You didn't sweat all over my sheets, did you? I still have to sleep in them.",
        "Maddie: Want to make a bet? [Maggie closes the window and locks it.]",
        "[Casey knocking on window]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, if you give me a job, you can take part of my pay out for the room. That way it's a win-win for everybody.",
        "Will: Gwen, except for me. If you take a job full time, then you're not going to be able to go back to school.",
        "Gwen: I'm going to worry about that later.",
        "Will: Excuse us for a second. Look, if we're going to play the game the way everybody wants us to, then we might as well get more out of it than just a place to stay. So, when I go live with Aunt Kim and Uncle Bob again, my mom will probably give me access to my trust fund. Which means that we can go back to school and not have to worry about working.",
        "Gwen: And how long do you think that's gonna work? She thinks that I'm after your money, anyway. Let me show her that she's wrong. Let me be the one to take care of us for a while.",
        "Will: Gwen, really, I wish it were that easy but my mom's always going to find a reason to hate you. You know what? I got a better idea. I'm not going to let you shoulder this alone. Lisa, can you make that two jobs.",
        "Lisa: Two what?",
        "Will: We're gonna apply for two jobs. That way we'll have more time to be together. And we can work out the school schedule.",
        "Lisa: Oh, honeys, it breaks my heart to see how both of you are trying so very hard. But I honestly can not offer you anything except Gwen, the room. That's all. That's it. Now, you have to take it or leave it. It's not that I don't want to help you out. Believe me, I really do. It's just that -- there are just no openings right now.",
        "Gwen: Please, there's got to be something. And the salary doesn't have to be a lot. Just enough to help us make ends meet, please.",
        "Lisa: Well, okay. Let me think about it. Maybe I'll come up with something.",
        "Gwen: Thank you!",
        "Lisa: Now, wait. Don't thank me, yet. I only have enough for one job, that's it.",
        "Gwen: Okay. I'll take it. And I won't let you down. I promise, I'm hard worker.",
        "Lisa: I certainly hope you -- I hope so. Anyway, I'm gonna go see about your room.",
        "Gwen: I know you didn't want things to work out this way.",
        "Will: Its okay, we'll get there. At least you have a nice place to stay.",
        "Gwen: And a job. We're back in business.",
        "Will: Except for one thing.",
        "Gwen: What's that?",
        "Will: Now we got to say goodnight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on window] [Maddie opens up the window.]",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. [Maddie sighs] What is your problem? I was joking about the whole sheet thing.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, my sense of humor went to bed a couple of hours ago. About the time you were supposed to be home.",
        "Casey: I said that I lost track of time.",
        "Maddie: Must've been some party, huh?",
        "Casey: Yeah, it was pretty cool. You should've come.",
        "Maddie: I didn't want to be a third wheel tag along with you and Skylar.",
        "Casey: Who says you were going to be a third wheel?",
        "Maddie: What, you didn't hook up with her?",
        "Casey: Not the point. The point is there was a lot of people there and you could've hung out with somebody.",
        "Maddie: Parties aren't really my scene.",
        "Casey: What are you doing up so late anyway?",
        "Maddie: Saving you from a fate worse than death, remember? It's a good thing I was here when I was.",
        "Casey: Thanks for that. But what were you doing in my room?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Nick's making a good point, Jack. It's a lot of evidence.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but no body. And I think I'm walking proof that you really need to find one before you can be certain somebody's dead.",
        "Hal: So, we drag the river.",
        "Nick: I'm already on top of that. But the body's probably way downstream by now.",
        "Hal: So, you get help from every precinct between here and Lake Michigan. Come on Jack, I want to talk to you.",
        "Meg: If it means anything, I'm with you. If I'd shot him, I'd throw the gun in the river.",
        "Nick: So, I guess you didn't shoot him.",
        "Meg: Good night, Detective.",
        "Nick: What, are you going back to your peace and quiet?",
        "Meg: Exactly.",
        "Nick: What the hell are they talking about in there?",
        "Carly: Whatever it is, it doesn't look too good for you, does it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I know we haven't been together that long -- well, together, together. But I can't imagine spending a night without you.",
        "Gwen: We're gonna see each other in the morning.",
        "Will: That's not soon enough. But if you think we're doing the right thing --",
        "Gwen: I do. And I'm not just saying that because we got a warm bed to sleep in.",
        "Will: Not as warm as --",
        "Gwen: No, come on, we're torturing ourselves now.",
        "Will: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Gwen: You know it's going to work out. We're going to be okay.",
        "Will: I know. It's too bad we don't have a star to wish on.",
        "Gwen: Who needs a star?",
        "Will: So, I guess I should go.",
        "Gwen: We won't say good night. We'll say, \"See you in the morning.\"",
        "Will: Okay, I'll see you in the morning.",
        "Gwen: See ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: What do you think I was doing? I was looking through your drawers for loose cash.",
        "Casey: Oh, really? So, you're a thief as well as a snoop.",
        "Maddie: My list of talents are endless.",
        "Casey: Well, whatever the real reason is you were in here, I'm glad you were, because if my mom would've came in and found out I wasn't home yet --",
        "Maddie: Well, you keep missing your curfew, don't worry, she will.",
        "Casey: But I got you to watch my back.",
        "Maddie: Who says I'm going to help you next time?",
        "Casey: Yeah, right, you'll probably sell me out next time. Whatever, I owe you one.",
        "Maddie: Big time.",
        "Casey: Maddie, wait.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Casey: What if my parents see you leaving my room?",
        "Maddie: Well -- I'll just tell them I was talking to you.",
        "Casey: My mom thinks I'm asleep. That'll look weird.",
        "Maddie: You're right. All right, how long am I stuck in here with you?",
        "Casey: I don't know. They usually read or watch TV before they go to bed so -- you might want to get comfortable.",
        "Maddie: No, I'm not getting in bed with you, if that's what you're thinking.",
        "Casey: Who asked you? There's the floor.",
        "Maddie: All right. I love the floor. Now I know how Henry felt when he was locked in that wine cellar.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well at least you have better company.",
        "Maddie: That's debatable.",
        "Casey: Ha-ha. Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.",
        "Maddie: So, how do I know when I can leave then?",
        "Casey: I don't know. Wait like twenty minutes and you should be fine.",
        "Maddie: Twenty minutes? I don't think I can stay up that long, I'm tired.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know, me too. Goodnight.",
        "Maddie: Okay, well, what if your dad comes in?",
        "Casey: I don't know. But whatever you do, be quiet, I'm trying to go to sleep.",
        "Maddie: Oh, gee. Excuse me for living.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hal, with no body, it's crazy to make assumptions.",
        "Hal: I can understand why you'd want to compare this case with yours, Jack. But when you were missing, we didn't find a gun with your fingerprints on it. And we certainly had no reason to believe you'd committed suicide. Paul's a very different story.",
        "Jack: It's still circumstantial evidence, no matter how you add it up, Hal. And weren't you the one to teach me that if it looks too easy, too soon, dig deeper?",
        "Hal: In a murder, maybe. This is a suicide.",
        "Jack: So you're obviously taking Emily out of the equation.",
        "Hal: I'm convinced she's clean.",
        "Jack: Look, Hal. I know you want to protect her. And I also know that you want to believe that Paul's dead.",
        "Hal: What are you trying to say? I have never let my personal feelings cloud my judgment as a cop. What's the deal, Jack? Are you ticked that Nick solved the case and you didn't?",
        "Jack: That's has nothing to do with this. I'm just the only one around here looking at more than one option. And if you can't at least admit the possibility that Paul's still alive, you got to ask yourself why.",
        "Hal: You've obviously have a theory, why don't you go ahead say it.",
        "Jack: I think you want to presume that Paul is dead so you can close the case and have another shot at Emily!",
        "Hal: All right! This conversation is over!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Paul, it's me, Meg.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. I thought -- I thought you --",
        "Meg: Were Rosanna?",
        "Paul: No, Hal. I had a dream Hal came.",
        "Meg: Well, they are looking for you.",
        "Paul: They didn't buy the evidence?",
        "Meg: They bought it. At least Nick Kasnoff did. They're looking for your body.",
        "Paul: So Oakdale PD thinks that it's a suicide.",
        "Meg: Nick seems to.",
        "Paul: Who doesn't?",
        "Meg: Jack Snyder.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, that figures. What about Hal?",
        "Meg: Hal is on the fence. Although Jack is trying to convince him that you might still be alive.",
        "Paul: What's it going to take to make them believe that I'm not?",
        "Meg: I already told you, Paul. A body. Preferably yours.",
        "Paul: I'm not really ready to give that up yet.",
        "Meg: Then all you can do is wait.",
        "Paul: And hope that Nick Kasnoff has more pull with Hal than Jack does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hal, you called me in to get my take on things. That's what I'm giving you!",
        "Hal: No, you're throwing around accusations about my ulterior motives in the case and I don't appreciate it.",
        "Jack: You have to remember who we're dealing with, and keep an open mind! What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Hal: All right, you've said your piece. Now go home. Nick, you've got until morning to wrap things up. After that, the case is closed.",
        "Nick: With or without a body?",
        "Hal: With or without a body.",
        "Nick: What did you say to him? He's really upset.",
        "Jack: The truth. Come on, let's get out of here. Go!",

        "Maddie: Hey! What are you doing?",

        "Henry: I overheard a message that Hal sent to Jennifer at the Lakeview. They know about Paul."
