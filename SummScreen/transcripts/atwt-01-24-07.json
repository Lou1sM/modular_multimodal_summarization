        "Gwen: This is so crazy! It just doesn't seem real.",
        "Adam: Well, it is. We've got the money and we're going to finish the demo, blow Gordon away and then the sky's the limit.",
        "Gwen: It just that, like, things like this don't -- they don't happen to me.",
        "Adam: Well, believe it, all right? You made this happen. The way you convinced Will to take that money from Barbara, that took some real skill.",
        "Gwen: Whoa, hold on. Don't say that. Don't make it sound like I pressured him into anything. It wasn't like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Mom, we need to get one straight, right now, about your money.",
        "Casey: So, you're telling me that Barbara just gave Will ten grand?",
        "Jade: Yep, and it's all to finish that demo for Gwen. I could think of a million better ways to spend money like that.",
        "Margo: Hey, you guys, close the door. You're letting all the cold air in. Did Katie call? Is there any word? Any ETA on her? No. Okay.",
        "Casey: What's going on?",
        "Margo: Oh, we're having a big family dinner. To celebrate Danny being home safe, and Katie and Mike are back together. And your dad, he's alive. So, your presence is absolutely required.",
        "Maddie: Margo, can you come here, please?",
        "Margo: What? What, is it Tom?",
        "Maddie: No, it's Daniel. I can hear him crying, but he's locked himself in his room and he won't come out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Emily?",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Dusty: What's wrong? Is it Daniel?",
        "Emily: I've never seen him like this, Dusty. I don't know what to do.",
        "Dusty: What happened?",
        "Emily: Thanks to Craig, my son is actually scared of me.",
        "Dusty: The last time I saw you together, he couldn't let go of you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, that was before Craig showed up at Margo's. I swear to you, Dusty, I could kill Craig for what he's done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So Emily blames you for what happened to Daniel?",
        "Craig: You know me, Lily. I'm capable of many things --",
        "Lily: Yes, you are.",
        "Craig: But I'd never set up a situation where Emily might think that she'd lost another child.",
        "Lily: Then why is Emily so convinced you're involved in the kidnapping?",
        "Craig: I don't know. All I've ever tried to do is help her. I was her friend when she had no one. I gave her a job. Hell, I handed her half of the newspaper. Does that sound like I'm trying to mess up her life?",
        "Lily: No. It sounds very generous.",
        "Craig: Thank you very much. The problem with Emily is, is that she knows her life's a mess, but she refuses to place the blame on the real problem.",
        "Lily: And where is that?",
        "Craig: Paul Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Meg, you need to get everybody out of here.",
        "Meg: Okay, what I need you to do is calm down. This isn't my problem --",
        "Paul: You don't understand. I saw it! I saw this poster. I saw it! And then -- I didn't know what it meant. I didn't know. And then I saw it again. And I saw the letters and I realized -- its Memorial!",
        "Meg: Paul, your visions? They're not working. They're not winning me back!",
        "Paul: That's not what I'm trying to do. Why won't you just believe me?",
        "Meg: Because you made that impossible!",
        "Paul: I'm just trying to do the right thing.",
        "Meg: I need you to leave now. That's it. I'm calling security.",
        "Meg: Why are you doing this?",
        "Paul: No, don't, don't, don't!",
        "Meg: Paul?",
        "Paul: Meg, I saw this poster. And it was torn like this and it was covered with blood. I'm not trying to scare you.",
        "Meg: You need to stop this.",
        "Paul: I can't. I've tried!",
        "Meg: Then try harder.",
        "Paul: How am I going to stop it when I don't even know why it's happening? I don't know why I'm seeing things I don't even want to see!",
        "Meg: I don't know what to tell you.",
        "Paul: Meg, you loved me once. I am not lying.",
        "Meg: I can't tell. I don't even know who you are anymore. You're in your own little world. You're living in -- in that cabin.",
        "Paul: I went there because I thought if I got away from everything -- if I got away from everybody, then there wouldn't be anything to trigger this. And it would all just go away.",
        "Meg: But it hasn't worked.",
        "Paul: No, it hasn't worked! And I have these premonitions and then they come true. And with what I saw, Meg, if what I saw, if something happened to you, I would never be able to forgive myself.",
        "Meg: You said this wasn't about me.",
        "Paul: You are not listening to me!",
        "Meg: Because the same thing keeps happening over and over again --",
        "Paul: Meg, something bad is going to happen here. And maybe not just to you, okay? Is this so far out of the realm of possibilities that I could be right about this? Or it is just that it's coming from me? You know what? Never mind.",
        "Meg: Paul, wait. I do believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Look at Meg. She was able to look past paul's manipulations and move on. That's just something Emily could never do. So, she's blames me. I'm an easy target.",
        "Lily: It sounds like you've given this a lot of thought.",
        "Craig: I just wish that Emily could learn to move on.",
        "Lily: Like Meg?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Lily: Emma mentioned something about you going out to the farm, to work on something with Meg -- what was that?",
        "Craig: A tractor?",
        "Lily: A tractor. Right.",
        "Craig: What's that look for?",
        "Lily: I'm just wondering if there's more to your admiration of my sister-in- law.",
        "Craig: I was just trying to be a gentleman.",
        "Lily: Yeah, okay --",
        "Craig: Believe it or not, I still have it in me.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Craig: For instance, I know it's not very gentlemanly to monopolize the conversation. So what's going on with you? What's new in Lily Snyder's life?",
        "Lily: My mother has offered me a job at Worldwide, developing a new product line for children.",
        "Craig: That sounds interesting. Right up your alley.",
        "Lily: Yeah, it's hard to ignore the fact that I've had children, isn't it?",
        "Craig: I don't follow.",
        "Lily: I don't know if I'm ready to go back to work. I don't know, I don't know. I don't like shopping. I wish I'd feel better about myself before I go in front of an entire boardroom full of people.",
        "Craig: Come on, what are you talking about? You're a goddess. You'll knock them dead.",
        "Lily: Yeah, sure.",
        "Craig: And you're on good terms with the boss, so just hit her up for a treadmill in your office. I mean, that'll do the trick.",
        "Lily: A treadmill? Yeah, I've tried. I've worked out. It's just not coming off as fast as I would like it to.",
        "Craig: You just give it time. I mean, what more can you do?",
        "Lily: I tried diet pills for a minute. They worked great, but --",
        "Craig: Really? So, why'd you stop?",
        "Lily: Holden wasn't thrilled about it.",
        "Craig: Holden?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Craig: Well, Holden's not trying to lose the pounds. And the last time I looked, he didn't have \"M.D.\" after his name. So maybe Holden should keep his advice to himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So, tell me what happened?",
        "Emily: Well, I went to Tom and Margo's this morning to check on Daniel, see how he was doing. And Craig waltzes in, acting like he hasn't done anything wrong. And he's carrying flowers and he's cracking jokes -- and I lost it. I just completely lost it.",
        "Dusty: In front of Daniel?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I couldn't help it. I mean, just standing in the same room with him -- and poor Daniel, he got so upset, Margo sent him upstairs. And then she asked me to leave. So, I left. But she promised me that she would keep Craig away from Daniel. But it's not going to do any good. You know him. I mean, he won't stop at anything. He'll make some excuse to go over there. And as long as he keeps doing this, this is never going to be over for my son. What?",
        "Dusty: What happened to Daniel today wasn't Craig's fault.",
        "Emily: Excuse me?",
        "Dusty: It was your own fault. And the sooner you knock it off, the sooner you can start being the kind of mother your kid needs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: What are we going to do?",
        "Margo: Well, we just have to wait until Danny's ready to talk. We can't push him.",
        "Maddie: Maybe we should call Emily. He might just want his mom.",
        "Margo: No, I don't think so. No, I think Emily's the reason he won't come out of his room.",
        "Casey: So, why do Will and Gwen need the money for that demo? Did something happen?",
        "Jade: You're going to have to ask Will. Making Gwen a star is not my thing.",
        "Will: It's not that I don't appreciate what you're doing for us. Because I do. But making Gwen's dreams come true is my job, not yours.",
        "Barbara: I understand that.",
        "Will: So, this isn't a handout. I'm going to pay you back as soon as I can.",
        "Barbara: Yes, you are. That was our deal. And now that we've closed it, there's something I need for you to do for me.",
        "Will: Are you serious? Mom, that's got to be some kind of a record, even for you.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Will --",
        "Will: You know what? Forget it. We don't need the money that bad. You can take it back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You know, I don't blame Will for having to think twice about taking money from his mom.",
        "Adam: Thinking twice and purposely trying to tank this demo, its two very different things.",
        "Gwen: He wasn't trying to tank the demo --",
        "Adam: Yes, he was.",
        "Gwen: Would you be this mad at me if I was the one who wanted to say no to Barbara? Because I almost did.",
        "Adam: Why? Because of Will?",
        "Gwen: For a lot of reasons. And if that's what I wanted, Will would've told her, \"No, thank you.\" And he would've come up with another way to get the money that we needed.",
        "Adam: That's a pretty nice fantasy, Gwen. But I think I know my brother pretty well.",
        "Gwen: Better than I do?",
        "Adam: You always see the good in him, no matter what. And that's great. But I don't have to. Okay? I saw the look on his face when he saw that we were up a creek. And I'll tell you, if Barbara hadn't have stepped up when she did, this project would be dead. And where would Will be? He'd be off in the corner doing a happy dance, because once again, he would've gotten exactly what he wanted.",
        "Gwen: And what's that?",
        "Adam: You. All to himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Take them. Because if you think this entitles you to have any kind of hold over me, or ask for favors --",
        "Barbara: Wait, Honey. All I was going to do is tell you to be careful with them. These bonds are as close as you can get to real money. Anyone can cash them. And we don't want them falling into the wrong hands.",
        "Will: Oh, that's it?",
        "Barbara: That's it. Now, is that too much for your mother to ask of you?",
        "Will: No. I have to meet Gwen at Crash. So, I'll ask Lisa to keep these in the safe overnight.",
        "Barbara: Well, that's a really good idea. Come on, let's get out of here, okay?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Bye.",
        "Will: See you.",
        "Maddie: Bye.",
        "Barbara: I hope Tom likes the lava lamp.",
        "Margo: Yeah. So, anyway, by the time Craig showed up, Emily, well, she didn't handle it very well. She got all wound up like she usually does, and poor Danny got caught right in the middle of it all.",
        "Maddie: Do you think we should have Tom talk to him?",
        "Margo: No, no, no. I'm hoping by the time he wakes up, Danny will have calmed down a little bit. I mean, I don't want all this stress around Tom while he's recovering.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Casey: Hello?",
        "Elwood: Casey, we're in big trouble.",
        "Casey: Can't you ever just say hi like a normal person?",
        "Elwood: I'm serious, Man. My parents saw my bank statement, all right? And they let me have it. It wasn't pretty.",
        "Casey: No, tell me you're kidding.",
        "Elwood: They know everything, all right? About us gambling and how far in the hole you are. I mean, all of it, okay? And they said if you don't pay me back by tomorrow, then they're going to call your parents and tell them.",
        "Casey: E, look, there's no way that I can come up with the money by tomorrow, Man. You got to stall your parents.",
        "Elwood: I can't, all right? You didn't hear them. I thought the phone was going to explode in my hand.",
        "Casey: Dude, my dad just had a heart attack, all right? If he finds this out, it's going to kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: What's wrong with you?",
        "[Gwen remembering]",
        "Adam: And I'll tell you, if barbara hadn't have stepped in when she did, this project would be dead. You know where Will would be? He'd be off in the corner doing a happy dance. Because once again, he would've gotten exactly what he wanted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, is everything all right?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Oh, yeah, everything -- everything is great now that you're here.",
        "Will: So, Mom came through. This is everything it's going to take to finish the demo.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I still can't believe that she's doing this.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. I promised her I'd ask Lisa if we could keep it here in the safe overnight.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry this is such a hassle.",
        "Will: This is for you. It's not a hassle for me. What's going on?",
        "Gwen: What if I told you that I didn't want you to take money from your mom? If I just gave this back to you and told you that we'd find another way to pay for the demo?",
        "Will: Are you serious?",
        "Gwen: Well, were you? When you said that without this, there's no way we could go ahead with it?",
        "Will: Yeah, Gwen, my trust fund is completely tapped out until the next installment.",
        "Gwen: What I mean is, would you rather cut our losses with the demo, if it meant that you didn't have to take money from your mom?",
        "Will: Honestly? Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: We really do need to get everybody out.",
        "Meg: I'm not authorized to shut down the blood drive.",
        "Paul: But that's exactly what we have to do.",
        "Meg: Let me talk to Bob, okay? He'll know how to handle this.",
        "Paul: No, no, you can't talk to him. You saw the way he was looking at me. There's no way he's going to believe me.",
        "Meg: Look, if I believe you, so will he, okay? You need to trust me now, okay?",
        "Paul: Okay, I trust you.",
        "Paul: She told you how we have to shut down the blood drive?",
        "Bob: Yes, she did.",
        "Paul: Okay, and you're going to help her get all these people out of here before something bad happens?",
        "Bob: What I'd like to do is avoid causing a panic.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you know, I just -- I flipped over the table. I think if you send everybody home, they might -- they might actually just be relieved.",
        "Bob: I think what we should do is go to my office and try to figure out a way to handle this situation.",
        "Paul: Okay, but we can't waste a lot of time. Because once this thing gets started --",
        "Bob: Paul, everything's going to be all right.",
        "Paul: You coming?",
        "Meg: I'll be right behind you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm not going to sit here and listen to you tell me what a horrible mother I am.",
        "Dusty: I'm telling you that losing your cool is giving Montgomery what he wants. What does it give you?",
        "Emily: So he gets to me. So what?",
        "Dusty: So, stop being a victim.",
        "Emily: I'm not a victim!",
        "Dusty: Yes, you are. Where is Daniel right now? Where is he?",
        "Emily: I told you, he's at Tom and Margo's.",
        "Dusty: And you're here, because you're letting a loser like Montgomery get to you.",
        "Emily: You don't think I want to be there right now, huh? You don't think I want to put my arms around my son and tell him how much I love him?",
        "Dusty: So, go do it. Don't let Montgomery get in your way.",
        "Emily: That's easy for you to say.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it is easy for me to say. Your boy's home. He's safe. You got to get your priorities straight. Starting with your kid. If you're going to let Montgomery scare you like this, what was the point in fighting so hard to get Daniel back in the first place, huh?",
        "Emily: You're right. Everything you just said, you're absolutely right. Thank you, I needed to hear that. I need to do whatever it takes to get my life back together, and that means I need to forget all about Craig Montgomery. Thanks.",
        "[Emily leaves and Dusty uses his cell phone]",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it's Donovan. The boss around?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden just thinks I'm risking my health by taking those pills.",
        "Craig: Well, are you taking more than the recommended dosage?",
        "Lily: No! Of course not.",
        "Craig: Well, then, what's the harm? I mean, as long as you're being careful, I don't see why you should have to stop taking them. Of course, I don't think you need to.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you. That's very sweet.",
        "Craig: No, I'm not sweet. You just tell Holden that I think he worries too much.",
        "Lily: Oh, he'll appreciate that coming from you, I'm sure.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: Yeah, I'm sure. Excuse me. Sorry. Yeah. No, I haven't forgotten. When? Okay, thanks.",
        "Lily: You've got to go?",
        "Craig: Yeah, unfortunately.",
        "Lily: Oh, okay. It was nice talking to you. It's been a long time. Too long.",
        "Craig: Yes, thank you. I feel the same way. Thank you for being my only friend in the world.",
        "Lucinda: Dear, have you any idea what you've just started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So, how long before we shut down the blood drive?",
        "Bob: Paul, I don't want you to worry about that right now.",
        "Paul: Why not? You are going to stop it, right?",
        "Bob: Why don't you sit down?",
        "Paul: No, I don't want to sit down. We have to do something or somebody's going to get seriously hurt! You said you believed me.",
        "Meg: I do. If you think you saw something, then I'm sure you did --",
        "Paul: If I think? I'm not crazy. Did you guys bring me here just to shut me up?",
        "Meg: We're worried about you.",
        "Paul: You don't need to worry about me! You need to take me seriously! Or somebody is going to get -- what did you -- what are you -- what was that?",
        "Bob: I'm sorry, Paul. You left me no choice.",
        "Paul: How could you do this to me?",
        "Bob: I'm sorry I had to sedate you. But it really is for your own good.",
        "Paul: I trusted you. You lied to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Mrs. Hughes?",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm?",
        "Jade: I just wanted you to know, I know that it might look like I'm crashing your dinner party, but I'm not. Adam and I have a date, and he asked me to meet him here. I don't think he knew that there was a dinner.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, it was all so last minute, you know?",
        "Jade: Well, I hope its okay that I'm here.",
        "Margo: Sure.",
        "Adam: That call sounded pretty intense. You didn't get yourself into trouble gambling again, did you?",
        "Casey: You know, why do you always do that?",
        "Adam: Do what?",
        "Casey: Assume that I messed up again?",
        "Adam: Maybe because it's me who has to keep bailing you out.",
        "Casey: You know what? Well, stop, because I don't need you looking over my shoulder.",
        "Maddie: Hey, Adam. Your friend is here.",
        "Adam: Friend?",
        "Maddie: Jade.",
        "Adam: Oh, right. Thanks.",
        "Maddie: Sure. You okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, why? Yeah, everything's fine.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Your mom wanted me to ask you to run to the store to get your dad coffee ice cream.",
        "Casey: Coffee ice cream?",

        "Casey: Yeah, okay.",
        "Maddie: Did you tell Adam about your grades? Is that why you guys are fighting?",
        "Casey: No, and he doesn't need to know.",
        "Maddie: Okay, I won't tell him.",
        "Casey: Good. Because my dad can't handle the stress right now. And I know that Adam would just love to tell him that I messed up again. But, I don't know, my dad -- whatever, my grades don't really matter. Just tell my mom that I went to the store.",

        "Will: We do.",
        "Gwen: Well, if you didn't want me to do the demo, you could have just said so. You could have just said something, if that's what you really wanted.",
        "Will: Are you saying you'd give up the demo for me?",
        "Gwen: You mean more to me than anything in the whole world, and you know that.",
        "Will: But I'd never ask you to do that. I mean, the only reason I'd said that we'd have to stop, is because Adam was throwing my money around and calling me the bad guy for calling him out on it.",
        "Gwen: You are not the bad guy.",
        "Will: Well, I kind of am. For wanting to pull the plug, on him.",
        "Gwen: Well, what made you change your mind?",
        "Will: You did. I took one look at you and how sad you were at the idea of not finishing, and I couldn't disappoint you like that.",
        "Gwen: That's why you said yes to your mom?",
        "Will: Yeah, of course. To make you smile like that? And you know what? If she hadn't offered the money, we probably would have found it another way.",
        "Gwen: I knew you'd say that.",
        "Will: Look, I'm not thrilled about her being in our lives like this. But she's already given us the money. And even if we tried to give it back to her, she wouldn't take it. So, we might as well use it.",
        "Gwen: Would it be totally wrong for me to say that I agree with you right now?",
        "Will: It's never wrong to say that you agree with me.",
        "Gwen: You're the best, you know that? The best. Hey, are you sure you want to go through with this?",
        "Will: Yes, of course. Your dream is my dream.",

        "Adam: I don't know. Maybe staying isn't such a good idea.",
        "Jade: Okay, well, if you want to go someplace else --",
        "Adam: No, I think I'd better stay. I'm just not sure if you should.",

        "Lucinda: I just did a do-si-do with Montgomery out there. He had the most sickening Cheshire grin on his face.",
        "Lily: So what?",
        "Lucinda: I thought the day had passed when I needed to worry about the male company that you keep.",
        "Dusty: Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Lily: No, interrupt. Your timing couldn't be better.",
        "Dusty: Lucinda, I have a business proposal I want to run by you.",

        "Dusty: I'd like Worldwide to buy out Craig's former shares of \"The Intruder\".",
        "Lucinda: But Darling, Worldwide has a newspaper. Have you forgotten the \"City Times\"?",
        "Dusty: \"The Intruder\" does better than the \"Times\". And if we combine them, we improve both readerships and we bring up the numbers, right across the board.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, but I don't see what the rush is, actually. Why the need for immediate action?",
        "Dusty: Well, I don't want to give Montgomery a chance to buy back controlling interest.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, it's personal.",
        "Dusty: No, never personal. Strictly business.",
        "Lily: Doesn't Emily own the other half of \"The Intruder\"? Would Emily really want to work for you, Mother? No offense. I'm just throwing it out there.",
        "Lucinda: Has anybody asked me whether I would want to work with Emily?",
        "Dusty: Well, after the year that Emily's had, she'd be much better off with you than answering to Montgomery.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling, you too have had a bad year. You've had such a bad year. I seem to recall that Emily had you chained to a wall someplace?",
        "Dusty: Listen to me -- would you listen to me?",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Dusty: Emily saved my son. She needs to know she has the support of a legitimate partner.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, so you thought of me, immediately.",
        "Dusty: Of course, only the best.",

        "Emily: Oh, family? Does that mean Craig's going to be here?",
        "Margo: No. I wouldn't do that to Danny.",

        "Barbara: Against his wishes?",
        "Bob: He was out of control. He posed a threat to himself and everyone in this hospital.",
        "Barbara: Why? Because he saw things that you don't understand?",
        "Meg: Barbara, he was completely irrational.",
        "Barbara: He finally came to you, Meg. And this is how you chose to repay him? To help him? By drugging him? What kind of a nurse are you?",
        "Bob: Barbara, that's enough! Meg, why don't you go down and see if you can get the blood drive up and running again?",
        "Barbara: You can't believe anything that she has to say. She's not objective when it comes to Paul.",
        "Bob: Barbara, he was violent and irrational.",
        "Barbara: He gets very agitated when he has his visions. And you know what? I believe what he's seeing is real. Does that mean that I'm crazy, too?",
        "Bob: No, but I'll tell you this -- I think he's having some kind of psychotic break.",
        "Barbara: I know he needs help. I know he does. But what do we do if he doesn't want it? I'm scared. What is happening to him?",
        "Bob: Well, I'm going to find out. I'm going to order a psych and a neural evaluation and an MRI. [Beeper beeping] This is something I've got to take care of. I'll be right back.",

        "Emily: I'm not going to bother Tom.",
        "Margo: Well, I can't take that risk. If he wakes up, and the first thing he has to deal with is one of your rants and raves --",
        "Emily: Excuse me?",
        "Margo: Well, the way you behaved in front of Danny when Craig was here? The kid's been through enough. He shouldn't have to watch you unravel.",

        "Daniel: Mom, I'm fine.",
        "Emily: Of course you're fine. Oh, you're better than fine. I know that. There's actually another reason why I'm here. I got us two tickets to the Bulls game Tomorrow night. And I figured, you know, since your dad -- you know, he's not up to going -- maybe you and I could go together.",
        "Daniel: I don't really feel like it.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's okay. Okay, well, what do you say we go and get a cup of hot chocolate at Java? Why don't you go grab your coat and just me and you?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, I don't know. I'm not sure that I'm entirely sold on the idea of going into business with Emily. It's not a lifelong dream of mine. However, if it would cause Montgomery difficulties, hey, I'm for it.",
        "Dusty: Great. I'll tell Emily the good news. Thank you.",

        "Lily: Yeah? Well, then, you don't know that I think this is great? I think it would be great for Craig and Emily to have a fresh start? Make progress, heal -- I think it would be great.",
        "Lucinda: I think I'm going to be sick to my stomach. I definitely am going to reconsider. I don't want Craig to heal. I want him to suffer for all the misery that he's caused this family.",
        "Lily: He is family!",
        "Lucinda: He's a criminal.",
        "Lily: Craig has done things, some terrible things, but you also have done some things --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you're going to defend your friend now. Is that what you're going to do?",
        "Lily: You know, God forbid somebody has an opinion about something that you don't agree with.",
        "Lucinda: You've been disagreeing with me since you were 15.",
        "Lily: Yeah, you still treat me like a child.",
        "Lucinda: When you behave like a child, then I treat you like a child.",
        "Lily: You should treat me like a woman who can think for herself.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, and that's what your newfound confidant Craig does. He lets you think?",
        "Lily: You see? This is what I'm talking about? When someone doesn't agree with you, you knock them down.",
        "Lucinda: Did I not just agree to go into business with Emily Stewart? Only because Dusty thinks that that's a good idea?",
        "Lily: You did that to spite Craig! No, forget it, you're not listening to me.",

        "Adam: Oh, come on. This has nothing to do with Gwen.",
        "Jade: Right. You know, I told Lily that I wouldn't be another guy's second choice. And that's exactly how you're making me feel.",
