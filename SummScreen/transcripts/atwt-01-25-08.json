        "Jack: What's going on, Carly?",
        "Carly: I got a call from Sam. It seems that his -- Cowboy Jack, his dummy, has gone missing.",
        "Jack: And that's a problem, why?",
        "Carly: He thinks that Parker might have taken it.",
        "Jack: No, no, that's impossible. Parker went to that dance at the school tonight, came home on time, and went right up to bed. There's no way he could've taken that dummy.",
        "Carly: Are you sure?",
        "Jack: Well, there's only one way to find out.",
        "Jack: Parker, get down here now",
        "Jack: Come on. Move it, Parker. I really hope you're wrong about this.",
        "Carly: I hope so, too.",
        "Parker: Why did you wake me up? What -- what are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Parker, Sam's puppet is missing. Do you know anything about that?",
        "Parker: He said -- he told you that I stole his stupid dummy? Come on, Mom. He's just -- don't believe him. He's just doing this to get you on his side.",
        "Jack: We know how you feel about the guy, but answer the question. Do you know where the dummy is?",
        "Parker: No, I don't. And I really don't care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I know it feels like we've been over this a million times. But Holden, you're stonewalling me here. Would you please answer my questions?",
        "Holden: Sorry, Margo. I'm not trying to be difficult. But I can't help you out.",
        "Margo: I haven't accused you of committing a crime, even. But a lot of people heard you blasting Donovan at the hospital party. It sure sounded like you wanted him dead.",
        "Holden: It's no secret that I blamed Dusty for Lily's breakdown. He's the reason that she OD'd and almost died. Yes, I was furious with Dusty.",
        "Margo: Were you furious enough with him to commit premeditated murder? Did you kill Dusty Donovan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Thank you for coming. The police won't give me any information. They've been questioning Holden for so long. I don't know what's going on --",
        "Lucinda: Darling, just calm down. Calm down. This is -- it's a mistake, obviously. There's no way that Margo could think -- I mean, seriously, that Holden killed Dusty. No matter what kind -- it's just --",
        "Lily: I know --",
        "Lucinda: It's ridiculous.",
        "Lily: I just --",
        "Lucinda: Okay --",
        "Lily: What if Holden's in real trouble?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You know, you really could have stayed at the party.",
        "Noah: Okay, will you stop? I always have a better time when I'm with you.",
        "Luke: What's my mom doing here? Mom, Grandma --",
        "Lily: Hi --",
        "Luke: What are you guys doing out so late? You should be home resting. You just got out of the hospital.",
        "Lily: I -- I just needed some air. That's all.",
        "Luke: But it's freezing. I don't want you getting sick.",
        "Lily: I'll be okay. And that's why you should go home, please.",
        "Luke: No, no. I'm not leaving until you tell me what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: All right, Holden, you don't want to answer questions without legal counsel, then here -- here, please call a lawyer, please.",
        "Holden: I don't need one.",
        "Margo: That's your choice. Look, I just -- I need a little more cooperation here. Donovan was injected with a lethal substance. An empty syringe was found at the Snyder farm. You admitted to putting it there. Why?",
        "Holden: Sorry. I can't say.",
        "Margo: Holden, you're digging your own grave, why?",
        "Holden: I'm doing what I have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Everything's going to be okay. Don't worry.",
        "Luke: Mom, please, don't treat me like I'm a little kid. If something's going on, I deserve to know about it.",
        "Lily: I just don't want you to worry. Everything's going to be okay, and your grandmother is here. And I'll be okay.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but something's going on. I can feel it. And you might as well tell me, because I'm going to find out one way or another.",
        "Lily: Your father has been brought in for questioning in Dusty's murder.",
        "Noah: That's insane!",
        "Luke: What? What -- how could they think --?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, it's a mistake. Obviously, it's a mistake. And we are on our way, right now, to the police station. We're going to get the whole thing straightened out if I have to do it myself.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm coming with you.",
        "Lily: No, no, it's better if you don't. It's better if you just go home. I can handle it.",
        "Luke: Are you sure?",
        "Lily: I'm positive. I'm positive.",
        "Lucinda: Come on -- come on --",
        "Lily: Take care of him, Noah, okay?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, come on. Let's go.",
        "Noah: Your grandmother seems to think that she can fix this.",
        "Luke: But what if she can't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Holden, this is a very serious situation. And unless you can give me an logical explanation -- unless you give me any explanation at all -- how did you get a hold of the syringe?",
        "Holden: I found it.",
        "Margo: Where?",
        "Holden: I'm not sure.",
        "Margo: Was it before or after Donovan was killed?",
        "Holden: I don't know. I spent the whole night in Lily's room. I didn't find out about his death until the next day.",
        "Margo: Well, I don't believe you there, because Susan Stewart said she saw you in the corridor.",
        "Holden: I left the room once.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Holden: I wanted to stretch my legs.",
        "Margo: You may not want to cooperate, but I can guarantee you, forensics will. The lab is testing that syringe, as we speak. And if the contents of that syringe matches the substance matches the substance that was found in Donovan's toxicology report, we have the murder weapon. So, unless you can make a very clear case for your innocence, the fact that you were in possession of that syringe, leads me to one obvious conclusion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Why do I always get blamed for everything? Sam just wants to get me in trouble. He hates me.",
        "Jack: Just tell us where you were tonight.",
        "Parker: You know where I was. Coach picked me up, and dropped me off at the dance. He then picked me up from the dance and dropped me off here at 10:00. Just like you wanted.",
        "Carly: And nothing happened at the dance?",
        "Parker: No, it was a stupid dance. I'm glad I had a curfew. Look, I did everything you wanted. So why I am still in trouble?",
        "Carly: You're not.",
        "Jack: We just -- we just needed to -- we needed to make sure.",
        "Parker: Well, I have a science test tomorrow. So, unless you want me to flunk again, I need to get some sleep.",
        "Jack: Yeah, go -- go on up.",
        "Carly: Hey, I believe you, Sweetheart. I do. I'm sorry that we had to give you the third degree, okay?",
        "Parker: Forget it.",
        "Carly: All right, well, I'm glad that was a false alarm.",
        "Jack: Yeah, right.",
        "Carly: I should go. Take care of yourself, Jack.",
        "Jack: You, too.",
        "Carly: Good night.",
        "Jack: Good night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, hello, hello, I'm Mrs. Walsh. I want to see Lieutenant Hughes immediately. It's a matter of utmost importance.",
        "Dallas: Oh, you know what, the chief is busy right now. I mean, can I help you with something?",
        "Lucinda: Well, very possibly, you can. There's been a mistake. A silly mistake in the Donovan murder investigation. You've got an innocent man, and we want to see him released immediately.",
        "Dallas: Well, look, um, why don't you take a seat and when Lieutenant Hughes is free, you can speak to her.",
        "Lily: How long will that be?",
        "Dallas: I -- I can't say.",
        "Lucinda: Well, that -- that's not good enough, for heaven's sake.",
        "Dallas: I'm sorry, but look, if you want to wait, you can just go outside.",
        "Lucinda: No -- that is outrageous and ridiculous! I want to speak to your superior office now.",
        "Dallas: Okay, that's not possible right now.",
        "Lucinda: Then make it possible. How are you anyway?",
        "Margo: What the hell is going on here?",
        "Dallas: No, Lieutenant, I'm sorry -- I was trying to tell these women that if they want to wait outside, but they're not listening to me!",
        "Lucinda: He's not giving us we need --",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Margo: Wait, wait -- one at a time! One at a time!",
        "Lucinda: Margo, this is ridiculous! You have to release Holden immediately. Immediately, if not, I'm going to sue. I'm going to sue this whole damn department for damages.",
        "Margo: Are you really? Well, this department is well within its jurisdiction to question Holden Snyder. And if you make any more threats like that, Lucinda, I will throw you in jail.",
        "Lily: Please, please -- Margo, please. He's still my husband. And I've been very worried. Can I just talk to him for just a few minutes?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Yeah, you can. I haven't been able to get through to him, so maybe you can. Come on.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Margo: All right -- not you.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, hey \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hold it right there, Parker.",
        "[Jack shows Parker the dummy]",
        "Parker: Before you rip my head off, I swear, I did not bring this dummy home. I found it upstairs, in my bed.",
        "Jack: And how did it get here?",
        "Parker: I really don't know. Look, I'm telling the truth, I swear.",
        "Jack: Yeah, why didn't you tell us before when your mother was here?",
        "Parker: I was afraid you wouldn't believe me. You guys are always ready to blame me for everything. Like I'm guilty no matter what --",
        "Jack: I caught you red-handed, Parker.",
        "Parker: I did not put that the thing in my bed! You really think I'm that sick?",
        "Jack: No, I think that you were lying about what you did tonight.",
        "Parker: I told you, I went to the dance, but it doesn't matter what I say anymore, does it?",
        "Jack: As twisted as you think that doll is, it didn't saunter upstairs and hop into your bed by itself.",
        "Parker: Dad, you're right. Someone put it there, but not me. Look, if I stole that dummy, I don't think I would have brought it home. I'm really not that stupid. Come on, give me some credit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Sam plays guitar]",
        "Sam: How did it go?",
        "Carly: I spoke to Parker. He doesn't have Cowboy Jack.",
        "Sam: Oh. Well, I'm glad. The last thing I want is for your son to get into more trouble.",
        "Carly: Thanks. Look, I'm sure you'll find your puppet. You probably just misplaced it or something.",
        "Sam: Yeah. We'll see.",
        "Carly: What was that you were just playing?",
        "Sam: Oh, nothing.",
        "Carly: It was nice.",
        "Sam: Well, when it's ready for an audience, you'll be the first to hear. Well, I can use a beer, do you want one?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yes, I can use one, too. Yeah. I'm still worried about Parker. He's been very distant.",
        "Sam: Well, it's his age. You know, nobody said being a teenager was easy.",
        "Carly: I wish you knew him like I do. When he's around you, he's rude and sarcastic. Well, that's not him. He's actually a good boy. He's sensitive, insightful. You know this -- this is going to sound strange, but he sees things.",
        "Sam: You mean, he sees dead people?",
        "Carly: No, no -- not like that, no. He just -- sometimes he sees things that other people don't. It's like he can -- he can sense what's really going on.",
        "Sam: How do you mean exactly? What did he tell you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You know you've probably heard this way too many times, but I swear Sam is out to get me.",
        "Jack: I just want to know how the thing got in my house.",
        "Parker: I told you, Sam must have done it. The guy is really sick.",
        "Jack: All right, I don't know what to think. I don't trust the guy either, but -- okay, tomorrow morning, I'll go talk to Sam, and I'll ask him a few questions.",
        "Parker: He's only going to lie, you know.",
        "Jack: I wouldn't be so sure about that. [Knock on the door] Hey, Coach, what's up?",
        "Coach: I'm sorry to stop by so late. I just dropped the kids off after the dance, and I saw your lights were on.",
        "Jack: Oh, sure, come on in. It's cold out there.",
        "Coach: I better get home to the wife -- I just wanted to check and see how Parker is doing.",
        "Jack: He's fine. Why?",
        "Coach: Parker never showed up at the dance. So I figured he was sick, and we've got that big game against Ogden next weekend. So, hopefully he's feeling better.",
        "Jack: Oh, I'm sure he'll be back to his old self by then. Uh, yeah, thanks, I really appreciate you coming by. Don't you appreciate it, Parker?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Coach: Just let us know when it's okay for him to come back to practice again.",
        "Jack: Will do.",
        "Coach: You take care of yourself, Parker.",
        "Parker: Yeah, sure.",
        "Jack: Thanks, Coach.",
        "Coach: Good night.",
        "Jack: Good night. [Jack laughs] You played me, but that's not going to happen anymore. So, if you weren't at the dance, why don't you tell me where you were tonight, Parker? And do not lie to me this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm not saying that Parker is psychic all the time, but it seems like when it really counts -- here's an example. There was a time when everybody thought that Jack was dead. But Parker, he told me not to believe it. He swore that Jack was alive, and he was right.",
        "Sam: So, your kid's got faith?",
        "Carly: Yeah. And a sixth sense about people. Which is why I'm surprised that he's so wrong about you, Sam.",
        "Sam: Well, we kind of got off on the wrong foot.",
        "Carly: Still, you've been terrific to him, and he hasn't cut you a break.",
        "Sam: Well, sooner or later -- sooner or later, he'll come around, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, you shouldn't have come down here.",
        "Lily: I couldn't stay home. I was so worried about you. Why won't Margo let you go?",
        "Holden: She's just asking me questions. It's no big deal.",
        "Lily: How can you be do calm about this?",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm handling it.",
        "Lily: No, not by yourself, you're not. My mother has been calling -- calling some high-powered attorneys from New York and Chicago to represent you --",
        "Holden: No, no -- no lawyer. I don't need one. All I need is for you to go home and be with the kids and take care of yourself. Margo, can you make sure that she gets home? She just got out of the hospital. She should not be here.",
        "Margo: All right, you heard him, Lily. You should leave now, if that's what he wants.",
        "Lily: What's going to happen to Holden?",
        "Margo: Unfortunately, that is entirely up to Holden.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Here, this will warm you up. You know, we can't stay out here in the cold forever.",
        "Luke: I can't just go home and act like nothing happened. This is crazy. My mom overdoses on the pills. The guy she was sleeping with has been murdered. And now, my dad is in police custody. What -- what the hell is going on here?",
        "Noah: There's one way to find out. We go down there, talk to your father, and ask him yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, let us help you, please.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Margo: Lucinda, take your daughter home.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, let's go --",
        "Lily: No, I can't -- I can't go anywhere until I know that Holden's going to be okay.",
        "Margo: You know, I want this situation resolved as badly as you do, but unfortunately, Holden will not cooperate.",
        "Lucinda: Well, do you think he'll talk to any of the lawyers --",
        "Lily: No, he's -- no, he won't. He's refused.",
        "Margo: You know, you should call one of those lawyers just in case he changes his mind.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you so much, Margo. That's such a help. Come on, baby. Let's go.",
        "Dallas: Lieutenant, this just came from the lab. I thought you'd want to see it right away --",
        "Margo: Yes, yes -- thank you, Dallas. This case just got worse.",
        "Holden: What is this?",
        "Margo: Forensics report from the medical examiner. The drug remnants found in the syringe that you admitted to having in your possession match those of Donovan's toxicology report. It was the same substance that killed him. And the only set of prints on that syringe are yours. Holden, do you want to amend your statement? You can start by telling me how you can to possess the murder weapon.",
        "Holden: Sorry, Margo. I can't tell you any more than I already have.",
        "Margo: You have got to give me something. Why did you take the syringe out of the hospital? Why did you hide it at the farm? Why are you going out of your way to make yourself look guilty?",
        "Holden: You know what, I would really love to help you out, but I can't.",
        "Margo: I don't want to have to do this, but you're not leaving me any choice. Stand up. Holden Snyder, you are under arrest for the murder of Dusty Donovan. Dallas, read him his rights and book him.",
        "Dallas: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say at this time can be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to attorney --",
        "Luke: Wait, stop -- stop, you can't do this to my dad! He didn't do anything wrong --",
        "Dallas: Now and in the future. If you cannot afford an attorney, one can and will be provided for you \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: So as long as Holden continues to refuse counsel, my guy cannot -- cannot have any look at any of the evidence, whatever they have against him -- nothing.",
        "Lily: I don't know why Holden's doing this.",
        "Lucinda: Poor Holden, Darling. All he seems to care about is -- your health.",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Lily: Holden, what's going on?",
        "Holden: Nothing you need to worry about. Go back to sleep. I'll take care of you. I'll take care of everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Darling, what? What?",
        "Lily: The night Dusty was killed, Holden said he'd take care of everything.",
        "Lucinda: What do you think he meant by that?",
        "Lily: I have no idea. Mother, he was upset. Holden was angry.",
        "Lucinda: No, Honey, there's no way -- no way that Holden could be so crazed and mad that he would killed Dusty. No.",
        "Lily: I don't even want to think about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Do you understand your right as I've explained them to you?",
        "Holden: I do.",
        "Dallas: Are you willing to answer questions without an attorney present?",
        "Holden: I am.",
        "Luke: You can't do this to him.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, Luke. He left me no choice.",
        "Luke: But -- but he's innocent. This is all a mistake --",
        "Holden: Luke -- Luke, you shouldn't be here.",
        "Luke: No, you shouldn't be here. This is all wrong! Just tell them.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry, I can't do that.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Holden: Luke, what I need to you do is go home and take care of your mother.",
        "Luke: No. No, I'm not going to leave you here and I'm not going to let you keep me in the dark anymore and treat me like I'm a kid.",
        "Holden: All right, fine, fine. I'll tell you the truth. The police have evidence that links me to Dusty's murder. A roomful of people saw me blow up at Dusty right before he was killed. Margo had to arrest me. That's it.",
        "Luke: But -- but it's not true.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. That's all I can say.",
        "Luke: But -- but you couldn't have --",
        "Holden: Noah, do me a favor -- just take him back to the farm.",
        "Noah: Come on, Luke. Do what he says, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Luke, what is it?",
        "Luke: They've just charged Dad with Dusty's murder.",
        "Lily: Oh, my God. I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: That's cool. I've got all night. I can wait, Parker.",
        "Parker: Okay, I didn't go to the dance. Even though you told me not to worry about Mom, I couldn't help it. So I went to Metro, and then I followed her and Sam to Yo's.",
        "Jack: Yo's? That's no place for a kid your age.",
        "Parker: I wasn't there to drink or get high. I was just watching them together, Mom and Sam. I mean, the guy was all over her. It was gross.",
        "Jack: Parker, how many times do I have to tell you? It's none of your business. If your mom wants to hang out with Sam, she's a grownup. That's her choice.",
        "Parker: But he's such a creep. And Mom didn't notice me, but Sam did. And when I called him on what he was doing, he pretty much laughed in my face and told me he was going to hook up with my mom, and that there was nothing I could do about it.",
        "Jack: He said that to you?",
        "Parker: Not in those words exactly, but yeah, that's what he meant. Okay, he's after her.",
        "Jack: Even if that's true, why is this any of your business?",
        "Parker: Because she's my mom, and I hate the guy.",
        "Jack: Enough to steal his dummy?",
        "Parker: Okay, I got really mad, and I took it. But I trashed it. I didn't bring it home. Why would I? I hate the stupid thing!",

        "Sam: Yeah, I still can't get the boiler running. And the repair company is busy until next week.",
        "Carly: We can't reopen with no heat. We're going to lose money hand over first.",
        "Sam: I'm going to take care of it, okay. We'll be up and running in no time.",
        "Carly: I wish I could fix what's wrong with Parker.",
        "Sam: For whatever reason, your son has a problem with me. And I'll try and fix that next.",

        "Sam: I am not perfect. I know I get a little out of hand now and then. But I'm trying to do better.",
        "Carly: Nobody's perfect, least of all me. And Parker is acting out because of me. I really screwed up raising my kids.",
        "Sam: Now stop saying that. Okay, I'm sick of hearing you put yourself down. And I won't let you do it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm not going to argue with you. I understand that you don't like it when your mother hangs out with other guys.",
        "Parker: No, not other guys, this guy. I don't hate him because I'm screwed up. There's something wrong with Sam.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so you keep saying, but --",
        "Parker: No, no, it's true. I've had a gut feeling about this guy ever since I met him. He acts completely harmless whenever he's around Mom. But when it's just him and that creepy dummy of him, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.",
        "Jack: I think you're --",
        "Parker: No, no, something is definitely wrong with this guy. And if Mom keeps hanging out with him, she's going to regret it.",

        "Lily: Holden, what is going on?",
        "Margo: No, no -- no, no, no visitors right now. We still have to print him. We've got to get him to a holding cell and wait his arraignment. And the judge will decide on bail then. Now would be a very good time to get him a lawyer.",
        "Lily: I will take care of that.",
        "Holden: Lily, the only thing I need is for you to go home, be with the kids, and take care of yourself. Don't forget about your doctor's appointment tomorrow --",
        "Lucinda: Don't worry, I'll take care of that --",
        "Luke: She'll be okay when she knows that you're okay. You need to get a lawyer.",

        "Sam: Stop me if I'm getting too personal here, but I just hate the way you run yourself down. You love your children. It's obvious. So, Parker's struggling right now. Happens to all teenagers. It happened to me. It's not your fault.",
        "Carly: Thanks for saying that, Sam. You do make me feel better.",
        "Sam: Good. Any time. You're an amazing woman. You opened up this club, you completely re-invented yourself and you did it for your children.",
        "Carly: I want my kids to be proud of me. It seems like whenever I take one step forward, I take three steps.",
        "Sam: So? You're not giving up. You're still trying to make it work.",
        "Carly: I feel like I'm digging myself out of a really big hole. You know, a hole that I put myself into to begin with.",
        "Sam: You did what you did. And now you're doing it. And now you're doing your best to get yourself of that hole and turn your life around. You've got to give yourself a break. You deserve to be happy, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You know how I feel about Sam. He's got a record. And I don't trust him. But at this point, I wouldn't blame your mom for trusting Sam more than she trusts you. And that's a problem.",
        "Parker: How do I make her trust me?",
        "Jack: I haven't the slightest idea. But your mother and I can't ignore what you've done.",
        "Parker: I'm already grounded, so what else are you going to do to me?",

        "Carly: Hi, Jack.",
        "Jack: There's something I've got to tell you. Parker had Sam's dummy, after all. It was up in his room.",
        "Carly: Oh, no.",
        "Jack: Do you mind coming by the farm to pick it up? I've got to stay here with the kids.",
        "Carly: Sure. Yeah, I'll be right there. Jack, did Parker say why he did it?",
        "Jack: Well, he can tell you that when you get here.",
        "Carly: I'm on my way.",
        "Sam: What happened?",
        "Carly: Parker lied to me again. He has Cowboy Jack, Sam.",

        "Bonnie: Wait -- wait, what? What? When did this happen?",
        "Lily: They've been questioning him for hours. But this just happened a little while ago.",
        "Bonnie: A lawyer should have been there for --",
        "Lily: I know, but Holden did not want to talk to an attorney.",
        "Bonnie: That's insane. Does he have any idea how serious this is?",
        "Lily: I think he does. I don't know why he's doing this.",
        "Bonnie: What did he say to the police?",
        "Lily: That's just it. Every time they ask him if he killed Dusty, he doesn't deny it.",
        "Bonnie: I don't care what he says. Holden needs a lawyer.",
        "Lily: I agree. So that's why I called you. I want you to represent him.",
        "Bonnie: Excuse me for putting this out there, but I do not think I would be your first choice.",
        "Lily: My mother has called these top-notch defensive attorneys in New York and he refuses to talk to anyone. You are close with him. Maybe you can talk some sense into him. Please, please, Bonnie, he needs your help.",

        "Luke: The strangest thing is, my dad didn't even seem upset that he just got charged with murder. He was more worried about Mom. And they're not even together anymore.",
        "Noah: Obviously, when the chips are down, they're still family. They must still love each other on some level.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Noah: That's a good thing, right?",
        "Luke: I can't stop thinking about the day that my mom overdosed -- the day that Dusty got died. My dad said, \"Dusty won't be a problem anymore.\" What do you think that means?",

        "Bonnie: I'm going to change his mind.",
        "Dallas: So what, is this a personal visit, then?",
        "Bonnie: I'm gonna forget that you said that. You know what? I'm also gonna forget that we're cousins, 'cause right now, you are a cop keeping me from seeing my client. So unless you want me to file a big, fat lawsuit, you're gonna let me see Holden.",
        "Dallas: Okay, when Holden says he wants an attorney, you can come visit as much as you want. But until then, I can't let you in there.",
        "Bonnie: I can and will file charges.",
        "Dallas: Bonnie, you know as well as I do they won't stick, okay? You care about Holden, I get that. But there's nothing you can do for him right now.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, I resent the fact that you think that I would ever, ever use Holden's misfortunes to get closer to him. He needs an attorney, and I'm representing him. Period.",
        "Dallas: Maybe what he really needs is a lawyer who's not interested in dating him. I mean, that is if he beats this murder rap.",
        "Bonnie: Dallas, you shut your mouth! Margo, I need to speak to Holden.",
        "Holden: Bonnie, what are you doing here?",
        "Lily: I asked her to come.",
        "Lily: Please, please talk to Bonnie.",
        "Holden: Lily, I told you, I don't want a lawyer.",
        "Lily: She's your friend. And you need her help. If you won't do it for me, do it for our family, please.",
        "Holden: I don't want you to worry about me.",
        "Lily: I can't help but worry about you. I know that you didn't kill Dusty. And you have to fight this! I am begging you, please.",
        "Holden: All right, fine, I'll talk to Bonnie.",
        "Margo: Let's go, this way.",
        "Bonnie: Sorry. I'm gonna need to talk to Holden alone if I'm gonna get the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I hate to think it, much less even say it. But do think my dad --",
        "Noah: No way. You know your father. You know what kind of guy he is. He's not capable of murder. He's not.",
        "Luke: But you thought you knew your dad, too. You didn't think he was capable of what he did.",
        "Noah: Okay, that's different. Yeah, you're right, I didn't know my father, but in hindsight, it all adds up. Yeah, he was capable of doing what he did. But you know that's not true of your father. He's a really good, really decent man. And you need to keep believing in him.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, and in my heart, I know, I know that he couldn't have done this.",

        "Parker: I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: What are we going to do? How are we gonna get him to stop acting out like this?",
        "Sam: I don't want to get Parker into any more trouble. Let's just forget it.",
        "Jack: Could I talk to Carly alone, please, Sam?",
        "Sam: Sure. I'll be outside. How you doing there, Partner?",
        "Cowboy Jack: Tell you one thing. Farm life is overrated!",
        "Jack: We can't ignore this behavior, Carly. He's got to see that his actions have consequences.",
        "Carly: I agree. But how can we keep punishing him if it doesn't do any good?",

        "Parker: You put that thing in my bed, and you set me up to make me look like a liar.",
        "Sam: You are a liar. I didn't make you skip that school dance tonight.",

        "Sam: How many times have I told you, Parker, you need to stay out of my business. You're a smart kid. Don't you know by now that when you mess with me, bad things happen, and I don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Parker: What're you gonna do? Sic your dummy on me again?",
        "Cowboy Jack: Quit callin' me a dummy. I'll tell you this right now, there ain't no way you'll ever outsmart me, boy. So you might as well just give up.",
