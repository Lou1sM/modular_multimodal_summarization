        "Thanks to an accident with Kim in Luke's car and belligerent behavior towards everyone including a police officer, Dr. Oliver is arrested. Noah vents his anger towards Luke again thanks to the canceled surgery, but Luke is able to get through to him a bit again after Noah explains that his feelings are different regarding everything after he became blind. In between doting on Kim, making sure she is ok after her car accident with Dr. Oliver, Bob goes to court and speaks with his friend the judge, who is about to remand Dr. Oliver to custody thanks to more of his mouthing off. Bob asks that Dr. Oliver be released into his custody, which doesn't please the miserable doctor. Bob later explains to Kim that he needs someone like Dr. Oliver on his staff regardless of his rude bedside manner. Carly finds herself at the pond thinking of Jack and their non-future now; unfortunately, she is carrying with her a six-pack of beer. She can't help herself, as she takes a sip right before Craig happens upon her. He is not pleased that she is blowing her life thanks to Jack. Craig thinks she needs to work and offers to back her and her fashion line again. At first, Carly is hesitant, but soon Carly realizes the error of her ways and makes the decision to throw the alcohol out, go to a meeting and to take Craig up on his offer. However, Craig warns her that he will not put up with any drinking whatsoever. Janet is so appreciative of Dusty's help in getting her, Liberty and Jack to NY to see the specialist, as Jack walks in on their embrace. Dusty later warns Jack to be there for Janet because she is counting on him; he knows that he was leaving her for Carly and he warns him not to hurt Janet now. Liberty learns Jack is back and is sure that it is because she is sick even though Jack and Janet promise that is not the case. Liberty is not too happy to learn she is going to NY to see a doctor and not because of FIT. Jack promises to make it fun too. Jack, Janet and Liberty go to get some food when they have an awkward run in with Carly. Carly offers to help Liberty again with her portfolio, but Janet shoots her down. Later, Jack and Liberty talk about the real reason she believes that he is back while Janet talks with Carly. She pleads with Carly to let Jack go because she needs him now because of Liberty. Carly and Janet hug, as Carly promises that she won't get in her way. Jack and Liberty talk about Brad and he promises that he will be there for both her and Janet no matter what. Jack, Janet and Liberty are preparing to order dessert when Jack sees a sad Carly again through the window; he can't help but stare at her. They are locked in each other's gaze until a guilt ridden Jack breaks their gaze, only to look back a moment later to find Carly is gone, which looks like it breaks his heart."

        "Kim: Bob!",
        "Bob: Don't argue with me. I almost lost you a few months ago. I'm not gonna take a chance.",
        "Kim: Oh. Why is he doing that?",
        "[Reid sighs]",
        "Luke: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where the hell do you think you're going?",
        "Reid: To the airport.",
        "Luke: You just hit someone! She could be hurt. She's the chief of staff's wife.",
        "Reid: Then they'll run a hundred tests she doesn't need for free and confirm what I can already see from here. She's fine. Now get out of my way.",
        "Luke: No, you are not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: What can I do for you, Sweetie?",
        "Noah: Dr. Oliver isn't interested in performing surgery on me, so I just need to get out of here.",
        "Nurse: Okay. I'll tell your boyfriend as soon as he gets back.",
        "Noah: Oh, no, no. I'm not gonna wait for Luke. If you could just give me whatever forms I need to sign and call a cab for me, I'd really appreciate it. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: What are you gonna do, string me up in the town square?",
        "Luke: Look, you caused an accident, you could have seriously injured her, you almost wrecked my car, and all you're worried about is catching your flight?",
        "Reid: You know, the whole reason this accident happened is because of you.",
        "Luke: Oh, you think this is my fault?",
        "Reid: You kidnapped me, you flew me out here on your daddy's jet, chained me to your boyfriend's side to perform a surgery most people I treat wait over a year for. So, yeah, this is your fault.",
        "Kim: Luke, Honey, let him go. It's not worth it. It's just my neck is a little --?",
        "Reid: See, there you go. One good day at a spa. It'll be like nothing happened.",
        "Luke: Officer, this man hit her car and now he's trying to leave the scene of an accident.",
        "Reid: Oh, for the love of God.",
        "Police officer: You can pray on your own time, Pal. License and registration, please.",
        "Reid: Do me a favor. Could you just pull out your gun and shoot me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Cut it out. So he kissed you. He's going back to Janet. Time to move on. To the past. To the future that will never be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay. My daughter and I will be there. Thank you so much. Oh, do you need me to send over her records? All right. Thank you. Bye-bye. They've already got Liberty's records.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I had Dr. Hearn send them over ahead of time.",
        "Janet: You've gone above and beyond, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I just made a few calls. That's all.",
        "Janet: And got us plane tickets for the appointments. I could never thank you enough.",
        "Dusty: You really need to be there for Liberty. Jack's got to be there for both of you.",
        "Janet: He will be. He is. And that you're a part of the reason this is all happening after we --",
        "Dusty: I'm happy for you.",
        "Janet: Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Look, Officer Fife, or whatever your name is, I'm really sorry about this whole mess. I'm a neurosurgeon. That means I operate on brains. Okay. I'm based in Dallas. I have to catch a plane to get back to my patients, people who actually need me.",
        "Police officer: License and registration.",
        "Reid: Give him the registration.",
        "Police officer: Whose car is this?",
        "Luke: Well, it's mine, but he was driving.",
        "Police officer: You leant it to him?",
        "Luke: No, no. I told him that he couldn't borrow it, but he snatched the keys and he took it anyway, which is basically stealing.",
        "Reid: Wait just a damn min-- I didn't steal your car. You knew exactly where I was going.",
        "Luke: Without my permission.",
        "Reid: I don't need permission. I'm trying to catch a flight. Seriously? You're giving me a ticket?",
        "Luke: Oh, that looks like a summons to me.",
        "Reid: Oh, you forgot to add littering. I don't have time for this.",
        "Police officer: Too bad, 'cause now you're under arrest.",
        "Reid: My lawyer is gonna have your job.",
        "Bob: What does it say?",
        "Luke: Driving with an expired license, operating a stolen vehicle, attempting to leave the scene of an accident, and --",
        "All: Resisting arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Don't!",
        "Luke: Noah, it's me.",
        "Noah: Luke, I know it's you. I can button my own shirt.",
        "Luke: Well, I know you can, but --",
        "Noah: I said no! I may be blind, but are you deaf? Just -- stop hovering.",
        "Luke: Okay. Well, something happened to my car. I'll explain on the way, but we have to get a cab.",
        "Noah: I already told the nurse to call me a cab.",
        "Luke: Well, all right. Then let's get going.",
        "Noah: No. I told her to call me a cab, Luke, not us. I'm -- I just need to get out of here.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Noah: And I need to get away from you.",

        "Carly: Jack. Oh, beautiful.",
        "Craig: Isn't it?",
        "Carly: What are you doing here, Craig? Did you follow me?",
        "Craig: No. I saw your car on the side of the road up there, so I got worried, apparently for good reason.",
        "Carly: I'm fine.",
        "Craig: You're fine?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh.",
        "Craig: Drinking beer in the freezing cold in the middle of the afternoon.",
        "Carly: I'm not drinking beer.",
        "Craig: Oh. You're holding it for someone, then? Let me guess -- Jack?",
        "Carly: Would you please mind your business?",
        "Craig: The last I saw you, I got the whole \"Things are gonna work out for me and Jack this time for sure\" speech.",
        "Carly: Well, Liberty's sick and Jack is with his wife, and that's already more than I wanted to tell you.",
        "Craig: I see. Jack got a case of family obligation, so you've decided to trash your life all over again?",
        "Carly: Oh, sit on it, Craig. It's one beer. I hardly consider that trashing my life.",
        "Craig: What do you consider it, then, a mistake? A slip?",
        "Carly: You know what? I don't need your advice or your judgments.",
        "Craig: I don't want to give them to you, either. Trust me, I went down that road once before with you. I already know it's a dead end.",
        "Carly: Well, then why don't you turn around and walk away?",
        "Craig: You want to wallow in your own misery? You want to throw away your sobriety? Go right ahead. You know what? It's not my problem, and for the first time, I can say that that's a relief. I am done.",
        "Carly: You're done?",
        "Craig: I'm done.",
        "Carly: With me?",
        "Craig: With you.",
        "Carly: Then why did you come down here when you saw my car? That's what I thought. You're not done with me at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Where did you go?",
        "Jack: I was getting some air. What's going on here?",
        "Janet: Oh, I was just thanking Dusty. He did an amazing thing for us.",
        "Jack: For us?",
        "Janet: Yes. He contacted some cancer specialists in New York City. He got us plane tickets to go and a hotel room to stay in so that we could be with Liberty.",
        "Jack: In New York?",
        "Janet: Isn't that amazing?",
        "Jack: You did all that?",
        "Dusty: I just made a few calls.",
        "Janet: A few calls? You contacted the best oncologist. She is gonna get the best treatment because of you.",
        "Jack: I don't know what to say.",
        "Janet: And, so, I was just thanking him for the three of us.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, Janet's right. That's an incredible gesture, Dusty.",
        "Janet: So, do you think you can get some time off?",
        "Jack: Sure, yeah. I appreciate it, really. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Don't mention it.",
        "Jack: Not every boss would do this for an employee, you know?",
        "Dusty: I want Liberty to get better.",
        "Janet: We all do.",
        "Dusty: In fact, I have some more information for you in the car if you want to walk me out.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Dusty: Good luck. Okay.",
        "Jack: \"Okay\" what? I thought you said the stuff was in your car.",
        "Dusty: We need to get a few things straight. I know what you almost did today.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry?",
        "Dusty: Planning on leaving Janet, going back to Carly.",
        "Jack: Who told you that?",
        "Dusty: Doesn't matter. I see that you've changed your mind, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out why.",
        "Jack: Listen, I appreciate you going out of your way to help Janet and Liberty, but my marriage, Dusty, is none of your business.",
        "Dusty: You think I'm here 'cause I like to talk, Jack?",
        "Jack: Listen, you're walking a thin line here, Pal, considering you kissed my wife not too long ago, so maybe you should stay out of it.",
        "Dusty: I don't want Janet to ever know that you considered going back to Carly.",
        "Jack: Listen to me, I made my decision. I'm here.",
        "Dusty: Then be here. Don't be miles away. She picks up on it.",
        "Jack: Anything else?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, she trusts you. She's counting on you. You got to deliver.",
        "Janet: So, I have some good news for once.",
        "Liberty: About?",
        "Janet: We are going to New York.",
        "Liberty: Really? Mom, that's great.",
        "Janet: I thought you'd be happy.",
        "Liberty: I'll get to talk to the F.I.T. admissions people in person.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Liberty: And see if they can work with us on the applications after everything that's happened.",
        "Janet: What are you talking about?",
        "Liberty: What are you talking about? Why else would we be going to New York right now?",
        "Janet: Baby, you're sick.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, so -- okay, why would you want to take a trip with me?",
        "Janet: To see specialists there. Oh, I'm sorry, Sweetheart. You misunderstood.",
        "Liberty: You want to go to New York just to talk to doctors?",
        "Janet: Just?",
        "Liberty: Forget it. I'm not going, Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Noah, I know that this is really frustrating, but I think it would help if you didn't take everything out on me.",
        "Noah: I'm just trying to be honest, Luke.",
        "Luke: And honest is saying that you want to get away from me.",
        "Noah: Luke, Dr. Oliver was it. He was my last chance of being able to see again, and it's gone.",
        "Luke: He was an arrogant, selfish jerk, Noah, and I refuse to believe that he is the only doctor in the world that can perform this operation.",
        "Noah: Just stop it, Luke!",
        "Luke: Stop what? Stop what, Noah? What am I doing that is so wrong? I'm just trying to help. Why can't you see --?",
        "Noah: Why can't I what? Why can't I see that? That's what you were going to say, right? \"Why can't I see that?\"",
        "Luke: That's not -- that's not what I meant. I'm just -- I'm trying to help.",
        "Noah: You know, your way of helping is taking me back to your mommy's house and giving me tea and cookies and making sure my socks match for the rest of my life!",
        "Luke: You know what? Can we not do this right now?",
        "Noah: Don't tell me how I feel! Don't tell me what to feel! I'm the one whose eyes don't work anymore, okay? Not you. You have no idea what I'm going through, how I feel, the kind of disappointment that I'm feeling right now, 'cause the one doctor I thought could help me stormed out of here, and mostly because he can't stand to be around you.",
        "Luke: Okay. Now, how can you turn this around on me, like this is all my fault?",
        "Noah: This is just what I'm stuck with.",
        "Luke: Well, I know you think that -- that I feel stuck, too, but I don't.",
        "Noah: Please, Luke. Don't -- don't tell me that I'm the same Noah you fell in love with, because I'm not. I know I'm not. And you know what? That is what matters most.",
        "Luke: Noah. You can't really believe that my feelings have changed for you just because you can't see?",
        "Noah: I know things have changed for me.",
        "Luke: What does that mean? Does that mean that your feelings for me have changed?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Honey, Honey. It's still ticking.",
        "Bob: Humor me.",
        "Kim: Oh, I wish you had a sense of humor about this. It was a fender-bender. I'm not hurt at all.",
        "Bob: It was traumatic. I love you, and you have a heart condition, and don't think you can talk me out of an EKG.",
        "Kim: You ordered an EKG?",
        "Bob: Of course I did. Listen to your doctor. He knows best.",
        "Kim: Well, considering you control my discharge papers, I would love to have an EKG.",
        "Bob: Thank you.",
        "Kim: You're welcome. Oh, this is all so ridiculous. I mean, do you honestly think that the police are gonna charge Dr. Oliver for everything that he's been accused of?",
        "Bob: That's possible. I was amazed at his attitude after he crashed Luke's car into yours.",
        "Kim: Well, you've got a point. He's definitely single-minded.",
        "Bob: He's a jerk, but a talented jerk.",
        "Kim: Oh, unlike my perfect husband. I know, I know. I told you I didn't want you to dote on me, but I have to admit, it's kind of lovely.",
        "Bob: You could have been hurt seriously.",
        "Kim: I know. I know I could have.",
        "Bob: I got to go check on the tests I ordered for you.",
        "Kim: Tests? Plural?",
        "Bob: Get some rest.",
        "Kim: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: If you're so done with me, then why didn't you just keep going when you saw my car? Why did you feel compelled to come down here and look for me?",
        "Craig: Because we used to love each other. We used to have a business together. We used to have a life together. So, sue me if I'm still concerned about your welfare, which, given the fact that you're standing next to a large body of water with a six-pack of beer, is kind of in question here.",
        "Carly: I had one sip. One.",
        "Craig: And you know that's one sip too many.",
        "Carly: Okay. Wow. What do you know? I can still make a mistake. There, I said it. Are you happy?",
        "Craig: Well, this isn't about what makes me happy. You know, I can't say I was in love with the idea of you going back to the Jack Snyder well of pain, but since that apparently isn't happening, I can understand why you might feel lost.",
        "Carly: I am not lost.",
        "Craig: Carly, you need something else to put your energy into, to keep you busy.",
        "Carly: You mean something other than Jack? Like what? Like going back into business with you? That is the last thing I need.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I know. When I offered that branch, you practically broke it over your knee.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. You suggested restarting Monte Carlo. What did you expect?",
        "Craig: That you might see an opportunity and jump at it.",
        "Carly: Well, you -- you're right in that. I do need to work in that -- this and that. It's definitely a recipe for disaster.",
        "Craig: So what do you think?",
        "Carly: You'd really be in to restarting Monte Carlo?",
        "Craig: [Sighs] Are you saying that you want to work with me again?",
        "Carly: Well, what I'm saying is that if I decide -- if I decide to come up with a new line, I'll need somebody to run the back office. It may as well be you. Hey, come on! You got me to go back into business with you, Craig. Revel in it! It's your big day! So, are you in?",
        "Craig: On one condition.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: How many doctors do I have to see? They're all gonna say the same thing.",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, this isn't about diagnosis anymore. This is about treatment options.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but they said what I have to do -- chemo. I don't know what other options I have.",
        "Janet: No, no, no. It's not that simple, Sweetheart.",
        "Liberty: I know!",
        "Janet: Listen, we're just gonna go to New York, we're gonna talk to the different doctors, and then the three of us will get a better idea of where we want to go with this.",
        "Liberty: The three of us?",
        "Janet: Yes. You, me, and Jack.",
        "Liberty: Jack? Mom, since when? He was just sleeping on his ex-wife's couch.",
        "Janet: He's back now.",
        "Liberty: Back?",
        "Janet: Yes.",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Janet: We decided that if we want to fight for our marriage, we need to do it and make it work. We love each other, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Does he love you, Mom, really? Or does he just feel bad for you because I have leukemia?",
        "Janet: Jack --",
        "Jack: No, it's okay. I don't blame you for feeling you this way, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Well, is it true? Am I right? Did you come back because I'm sick?",
        "Janet: Jack didn't come back because of you.",
        "Jack: Your mother didn't even tell me at first that you were sick.",
        "Janet: He came back on his own, Liberty.",
        "Jack: I know -- I know I haven't been myself since your dad died. We all know that.",
        "Liberty: So is this your way of making it up to us, because you've been gone for so long?",
        "Jack: No, I don't think I could ever really make it up, Liberty. And I know it's no excuse for not being here for the two of you. But I -- I am now.",
        "Liberty: Oh, for how long?",
        "Janet: Oh, Liberty, please.",
        "Jack: Liberty, the most important thing to me right now is being back in this house and taking care of you both.",
        "Liberty: Okay. I just don't feel like hopping from doctor to doctor in New York is -- is gonna do anything.",
        "Jack: Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't have to be just about that. We're in New York, we can do New York things.",
        "Liberty: Yay. We can see a show?",
        "Jack: We can do whatever you want, if you can stand being with me.",
        "Liberty: I guess I can.",
        "Jack: Would you care to test that theory?",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Jack: I don't know. Maybe see if you can stand to look at me over a meal.",
        "Liberty: Al's.",
        "Jack: Big burger.",
        "Liberty: Extra cheese.",
        "Jack: Stack of fries.",
        "Liberty: I want a shake.",
        "Jack: You got it. You in?",
        "Janet: Oh, I'm in.",
        "Liberty: There's just one rule you guys got to promise me.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Liberty: No leukemia talk, please.",
        "Jack: Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I just went from reaming you out to agreeing to go back into business with you, and you have a condition?",
        "Craig: You bet I do.",
        "Carly: All right. What is it?",
        "Craig: I'm not kidding about this.",
        "Carly: Just say it, Craig.",
        "Craig: Carly, I spent months trying to save you from yourself when you were drinking, and as you recall, it almost didn't work.",
        "Carly: I recall.",

        "Carly: Wait.",
        "Craig: No, you wait, Carly. I swear, if I see you take a drink or a sip, if I see you even looking at a glass that has anything stronger than ice cubes in it, I swear the deal is off.",
        "Carly: I'm not gonna drink.",
        "Craig: But you did, just now. Now, whether that's the beginning of a real backslide or just a little misstep that you can self-correct, that will make the difference between whether or not we can work together. I need you to hear me on this, Carly. I mean it.",
        "Carly: I hear you.",
        "Craig: I won't be your policeman, and I won't be your enabler. If you drink, I will walk, and I don't care what it costs me, financially or otherwise. Okay? I won't go through this again.",
        "Carly: Someone will find the rest of these and drink them. It's not littering if it's a donation.",
        "Craig: So I have your word?",
        "Carly: You have my word.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Carly: I'm gonna get some coffee.",
        "Craig: Good idea.",
        "Carly: And then I'm gonna go to a meeting.",
        "Craig: Even better. And as for the two of us working together again --",
        "Carly: Yeah?",
        "Craig: When we're hitting on all cylinders, we make a great team, Carly. You stick to the plan, you won't regret it.",
        "Carly: Well, I wish I was as sure about that part as you are. Oh, and, Craig, don't let this go to your head or anything, but thank you for stopping and for reminding me that I have nothing if I don't have my sobriety.",
        "Craig: Anytime.",
        "Carly: Like I said though, don't let it go to your head.",

        "[Noah scoffs]",
        "Luke: Noah, there is no way that I can know what you're going through, and I hate that you're going through it. And you say that -- that nothing will ever be the same, and -- and you're right. A lot of it won't be. But this -- us -- we're the same. You are still the same wonderful guy that I want to spend the rest of my life with. Do you hear what I'm saying, Noah? Do you hear what I'm so desperately trying to tell you?",

        "Reid: What I've run into is a confederacy of idiots -- lots and lots of idiots, with a couple of jerks sprinkled in. Your doctors went to clown college. Your cops are dumber than rocks. And that's a -- that's a medical diagnosis. I didn't steal any car, okay? All I was trying to do was to get to the airport so that I could get back to Dallas. I was strong-armed into coming here by one Luke Snyder, who was one of the jerks that I mentioned. When I didn't agree to operate on his boyfriend, he had me arrested and detained. And now whatever chance I have of getting on a flight today is ruined. So look, I'd appreciate it if you could just save us both a lot of aggravation. Let me have my cell phone back so I can at least try to book a seat on the next flight out of this town that -- time forgot.",
        "Judge: Are you telling the court you're leaving Oakdale, Dr. Oliver?",
        "Reid: As fast as I possibly can, your honor. Yes, if I could flap my wings and bust through your ceiling, already be on my way.",

        "Liberty: I ordered my meal exactly like Dad would have. I -- I don't like my burger cooked like this. I like a chocolate shake and not vanilla.",

        "Liberty: No.",

        "Reid: Your wife is fine. It wasn't a wreck. It was a little fender bender. You're trying to make this sound worse than it is.",
        "Bob: Doctor, why don't you do yourself a favor and keep your mouth shut? If I were you, I would throw him in a cell and leave him there, but that would be a great disservice to patients that might benefit from him enormous skill, which unfortunately is in direct proportion to his enormous ego. This is what I would suggest -- that you release him into my recognizance.",

But I am here, and I am gonna help you through this, not because it's what your father would want, because I love you.",
        "Liberty: What makes you think that you helping me is gonna do me any good, hmm?",
        "Jack: It's doing me good. It's doing your mother good. And maybe in time you'll see that it's -- it's gonna do you some good, too.",

        "Carly: What do you need?",
        "Janet: I need you to stay out of Jack's life. Unless it's about the kids or something, I need you to leave him alone, because I need him. My family's in crisis, Carly. My daughter's life is in danger. She has -- she has cancer, leukemia.",
        "Carly: I'm so sorry, Janet. I'm so sorry.",
        "Janet: And I really -- I need Jack to help us get through this.",
        "Carly: I know. I totally understand that.",
        "Janet: Do you? Because I am scared to death. I could lose my little girl, and I don't even know how to deal with the thought of that. So I don't know how to do it by myself.",

        "Bob: I can use him on the staff.",

        "Luke: Well, I didn't have time. Uh, Dr. Oliver had a little accident.",
        "Reid: Thanks to you, I am now stuck in Oakhell for a month. Do you realize how many surgeries I'm gonna have to postpone back in Dallas? Do you care that people might die?",
        "Luke: Well, I'm sure they've got you covered. And if you need a surgery fix, Noah's still here for you.",
        "Reid: If you actually think that I would still even consider --",
