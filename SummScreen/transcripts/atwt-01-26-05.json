        "When Will disappears, Alison finds him and reminds him that she will always be his friend no matter what. She then convinces him to let everyone know he's safe. Susan finds out for Emily that when Barbara's therapist did his monthly check on his medicine cabinet, the drug that helps make a patient suggestible was missing. Roseanna reminds Paul that the world doesn't revolver around making Barbara pay for her crimes. When Barbara comes stomping out of the interrogation room howling about the fact no one is searching for her son, Paul tells her that it's ultimately her fault. Barbara vows that she'd go back to prison if it only made Will happy."

        "Craig: Still handsomely packing the power suits, I see.",
        "Lucinda: I thought I had given instructions to the staff to put you on the no admit list.",
        "Craig: Oh, really?",
        "Lucinda: Lucy has gone away. She's gone. You have no business in this house.",
        "Craig: Well, while it is true my daughter has left your gilded cage for college, Sierra still lives here.",
        "Lucinda: She's your ex-wife. God, the town is littered with them. Would you please go and annoy someone else?",
        "Craig: Sierra and I are still the parents of your granddaughter. Don't you think it would be in your best interest if we bury the hatchet?",
        "Lucinda: I know precisely where I'd like to bury it.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, hate notwithstanding, I am willing to put your sordid past behind us?",
        "Lucinda: If you're not out of this house in 60 seconds --",
        "Craig: Sierra?!",
        "Lucinda: She's not here.",
        "Craig: And you're not gonna tell me where she is?",
        "Lucinda: Now he's catching on.",
        "Craig: All right, well, I'll track her down. You know how I like a challenge.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Well, I don't know what's worse -- the thought that you stayed here all night or the sight of you drinking this early in the morning.",
        "Dusty: Well, it's not the first, if that makes you feel any better. You're welcome to have anything you want. We're having an empty nest special this morning.",
        "Sierra: Well, I thought maybe you would like something stronger. Have it. It'll put hair on your chest.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Sierra: I just wanted to thank you in person. Lucinda said that you were ready to propose to Lucy last night. And you found out her plans and you let her go. Takes guts.",
        "Dusty: I don't want to disappoint you, but if I had to do it over, I'd skip the proposal and I'd go right to Vegas.",
        "Sierra: You don't mean that.",
        "Dusty: I do. Letting her leave was the biggest mistake of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Whoo, it's hot in here.",
        "Alison: Yeah, a little.",
        "Aaron: Really hot, like burning up.",
        "Alison: Yeah. I feel it, too. Yeah.",
        "Aaron: We ought to do something about it.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Aaron: No, no, no, no -- no! No! I'm sorry. Sorry.",
        "Alison: No, it's okay --",
        "Aaron: It's not okay, Ali. I hate this. I hate this. It's hot in here. I gotta open a window. I need another cold bath. This is terrible.",
        "Alison: Is it really that bad?",
        "Aaron: Of course it's bad. Ali, do you know how long the recuperation period is gonna take for all this? And the little sheet you put between the bed isn't exactly the best barrier. I barely slept a minute last night.",
        "Alison: Are you suggesting that I snore?",
        "Aaron: Snore? No. No, you don't snore. You purr like a kitten. And it's killing me!",
        "Alison: Meow!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Aaron: That's the door! The door! We have company! Good, good, good.",
        "Alison: Rosanna! Hi!",
        "Rosanna: Hi, I'm sorry to come by without calling.",
        "Aaron: No sorrys. Come on. Welcome, Rosanna. We love company.",
        "Alison: We love it! The more the merrier!",
        "Rosanna: Oh, good. Thank you.",
        "Aaron: Beautiful.",
        "Rosanna: Did will sleep here last night by any chance?",
        "Alison: No. Why, what happened?",
        "Rosanna: Oh -- well, Paul and Will had a little bit of a fight and Kim called this morning to see if he was okay. He was supposed to stay with her, she thought he was staying with us.",
        "Aaron: No. He hasn't called or come by or anything.",
        "Alison: But if he does, we'll make sure that he finds you and lets you know that he's okay.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. I hope he is. Thanks a lot.",
        "Alison: Bye. Sounds like Will's in trouble again. I wonder where he is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Kim? Well, this is a surprise.",
        "Kim: Is Hal home?",
        "Barbara: No, he's not. He's at the station. Is everything all right?",
        "Kim: I really should talk to Hal first.",
        "Barbara: Is something wrong? Can I help you with something?",
        "Kim: Well, it's Will.",
        "Barbara: Well, if it's Will, than I have every right to know what's going on. What's happened?",
        "Kim: I knocked on his bedroom door this morning to call him for breakfast, and he wasn't there. His bed hadn't been slept in.",
        "Barbara: Did he leave you a note?",
        "Kim: Nothing.",
        "Barbara: Who else have you called?",
        "Kim: Paul wasn't home, but Rosanna said they hadn't seen him. Now I'm asking you, Barbara. Do you know where Will is?",
        "Barbara: How would I know?",
        "Kim: Because I understand the two of you were seen at the Lakeview yesterday and that he got up and ran out on you. So what have you done to him this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hal. Hi.",
        "Hal: Hey.",
        "Emily: Hey. Sorry, we couldn't wait. Have the guys in lab had a chance to test the cups we brought from the kitchen?",
        "Hal: They ran every test in the book for traces of narcotics.",
        "Paul: What did you find?",
        "Hal: Nothing.",
        "Emily: What? That's impossible! There had to be traces of something.",
        "Hal: Coffee and herbal tea.",
        "Emily: That's it?",
        "Hal: I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.",
        "Emily: Okay well, I -- I guess it was worth a try. Thanks anyway.",
        "Hal: Hold on. There is more to the story.",
        "Emily: What is it?",
        "Hal: Well, some of the cups that were tested came up clean -- I mean, totally clean. No traces of anything.",
        "Paul: Like they'd never even been used?",
        "Hal: No scratches on the glazing, chips, cracks on the surface -- nothing.",
        "Emily: No, no, no -- that doesn't make any sense. I bought those -- I bought those dishes years ago. I mean, they've been used a hundred times.",
        "Hal: Well, that's interesting. Because the lab report suggests that they were bought recently. Almost as if they were brand-new.",
        "Emily: Hal, that is impossible. I had those dishes before I moved in with you. No one would ever have mistaken them for being new.",
        "Paul: What about this? What if somebody took all of the dishes out of your cupboard and replaced them with a duplicate set?",
        "Emily: Yeah, somebody like Barbara?",
        "Hal: Well, now, I can't prove that, but if the lab reports are accurate, then, yeah, that's a definite possibility.",
        "Paul: Well, then it's time to bring Barbara in for questioning.",
        "Hal: On what basis? Look, even if you found the receipt, Barbara could explain all this away by saying, \"I bought new dishes just to be nice.\"",
        "Paul: And you would believe that?",
        "Hal: Of course not. But I couldn't very well prove that she was lying, now could I?",
        "Paul: You know her history, Hal. We all know what she's capable of. She's made Emily her victim again and again! And you're just going to let her get away with it?",
        "Hal: Evidence, Paul -- I need evidence. I'm a cop, not a mob boss. A cop. We don't traffic in vendettas here. I can't make a move without proof.",
        "Paul: Well, then, go get proof. Or get a court order! You gotta do something!",
        "Hal: If I went to a judge and told him I was gonna bring in my ex-wife for questioning because she bought a new set of china without telling anybody, how long do you think I would have my job?",
        "Paul: Don't you care about your current wife?",
        "Hal: Of course I do!",
        "Paul: But your hands are tied.",
        "Hal: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Great. So the guilty get protection and the rest of us just have to fend for ourselves.",
        "Rosanna: Paul?",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Rosanna: Is he here? Have you seen him?",
        "Emily: Who? Who are you talking about?",
        "Rosanna: Will. He didn't show up at Kim and Bob's last night. Nobody knows where he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What have I done to Will? How could you say such a thing to me?",
        "Kim: Oh, stop fooling around and tell me the truth! What went on between the two of you?",
        "Barbara: Nothing. And I resent all these questions.",
        "Kim: Listen, if my son got up and ran out on me in the middle of a restaurant, you would have questions, too.",
        "Barbara: Oh, but that would never happen, would it? Because we all know what a perfect mother you are.",
        "Kim: Kiddo, if you want to start in on me -- and believe me, you do not -- we'll do it after you tell me. What went on between the two of you?!",
        "Barbara: I wanted to see my son! That's all. And yes, he did leave rather abruptly. But we met back here after it was over and we had a good talk.",
        "Kim: About what?",
        "Barbara: I want him to know how much I love him.",
        "Kim: And?",
        "Barbara: And that was all.",
        "Kim: I don't believe a word that comes out of your mouth.",
        "Barbara: What do you people want from me anyway?! I have to kowtow to Hal and Emily around here. They demote me to housemaid in the house I made into a home. The doctors tell me that I'm better, but doesn't matter to you, does it? You keep accusing me of want to harm to my own flesh and blood! \"Will's gone missing, so Barbara must be to blame!\" When are these accusations gonna stop, Kim?!",
        "Kim: Oh, my God! You are too much. When are you gonna stop blaming everybody else in the world for a reputation that you created all on your own. Listen, kiddo, if you want to help, stop feeling sorry for yourself and come and help us find Will.",
        "Barbara: You find Will.",
        "Kim: And what about you?",
        "Barbara: I need someone in my corner. There's only one man who can help me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You know, you're probably right. Will probably is in trouble and I know you want to help him, Alison, but --",
        "Alison: No, we have to. He probably didn't come here last night because Emily's my sister and he knows that I think that she's innocent. But just because I'm on her side doesn't mean that I'm not on his. I have to go find him.",
        "Aaron: Can we at least talk about this first?",
        "Alison: We talked.",
        "Aaron: No. No, you talked. I just listened.",
        "Alison: What's wrong with that?",
        "Aaron: Maybe -- maybe I want you to stay.",
        "Alison: He needs me, Aaron. I'm probably his only real friend. He needs a break. Remember all the times we needed a break?",
        "Aaron: Yes, but --",
        "Alison: And if I don't help him, who knows where he could end up? He could get sent back to the hospital or get sent to jail. And I've been there. There is no way that he would survive.",
        "Aaron: Ali, what about you? Do I at least get to worry about you?",
        "Alison: You can worry about me, but you can't stop me.",
        "Aaron: Do you even know where you're going?",
        "Alison: I have some ideas. You stay here, get some rest, and I'll see you soon.",
        "Aaron: Kiss good-bye?",
        "Alison: Are you sure you want to take that chance?",
        "Aaron: Ali, the sun's up, you're fully dressed running out of the house. Come on. Give a man some credit, would you? Hmm?",
        "Alison: All right, I'm being an idiot. All right, I'll see you soon.",
        "Aaron: Mm, okay, good.",
        "Alison: Oh, Aaron. Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Okay! I'd apologize, but I'm not sorry! Love you!",
        "Alison: I love you, too!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What was I thinking? I was crazy to let her go.",
        "Sierra: Yeah, I know what you mean. Everything already seems so empty without her.",
        "Dusty: You're really cheering me up.",
        "Sierra: Yeah, sorry. I can't help myself. Every time I close my eyes, I see all the people in my life that I've had to say good-bye to. I am just going to miss her so much.",
        "Dusty: Well, at least you can get away, you know? You don't have to bump into her memory everywhere you look.",
        "Sierra: Where would I go?",
        "Dusty: You got Montega.",
        "Sierra: Well, I thought about that. You know, going back there and burying myself in my work.",
        "Dusty: What's stopping you?",
        "Sierra: Just a house full of ghosts. Alan's not there and there's all the echoes of the noises that Bryant and Lucy when they were young. And all the old memories of all of us together and the good times we had. Craig. When Craig was -- well, Craig.",
        "Dusty: Every time that door opens, I think she'll be standing there like an angel.",
        "Sierra: Well, what shall we do about it?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. I've got this, so here's to oblivion.",
        "Sierra: I don't think there's enough alcohol in the world to make me forget about Lucy. And I think the same is true for you. So how about this? If, uh -- if it starts to hurt to much or the memories are too much, we lean on each other?",
        "Dusty: Yeah?",
        "Sierra: Yeah. I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it? Who else in the world would miss Lucy the way that we do?",
        "Craig: What about me?",
        "Craig: Well, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.",
        "Dusty: You are.",
        "Craig: If you're sniffing about who misses Lucy most , I think I'm in the running, don't you?",
        "Dusty: Excuse me.",
        "Sierra: I wasn't suggesting that you don't miss Lucy. I know you do.",
        "Craig: I wanted to talk to you.",
        "Sierra: Well, I'm right in the middle of a private conversation with Dusty.",
        "Craig: All right.",
        "Sierra: Is it an emergency?",
        "Craig: No, no, no. It's not an emergency. I just want to talk to you. See how you were doing, given our daughter's departure.",
        "Sierra: Well, in case you've forgotten, I spent the better part, no -- the worst part of the last couple years living in a different time zone than my daughter. I'll survive. But, thank you for asking. I'm in that private conversation --",
        "Craig: Private. Right. How rude of me to intrude. You all right?",
        "Sierra: I'm perfectly fine. Thank you.",
        "Craig: All right. Then I will be on my solitary way.",
        "Dusty: Well, I want to thank you for the coffee. If I could negotiate with fate and buy myself one more chance, I'd have Lucy right here. And I'd never let her out of my sight again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Ahh, now this is what I like to see. A man working hard. For me.",
        "Jordan: First quarter report for Street Jeans.",
        "Lucinda: Do I want to -- look?",
        "Jordan: Read it and weep. Tears of unadulterated joy.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, very -- that's very, very nice. Wait'll I tell Sierra.",
        "Jordan: Sierra?",
        "Lucinda: I'm making some changes in management.",
        "Jordan: Mm-hmm. Meaning?",
        "Lucinda: In order to give myself a little more time with the European divisions, I just -- I need somebody to step in for me in the domestic division, and she has years of leadership experience, a good head on her shoulders and I trust her completely.",
        "Jordan: So, I'm getting a new boss?",
        "Lucinda: You and sierra. Worldwide's new dream team.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Will's missing?",
        "Paul: Since when?",
        "Rosanna: Since Kim knocked on his door this morning and he wasn't in his room.",
        "Hal: Was his bed slept in?",
        "Rosanna: No. And she has called everyone that she can think of.",
        "Hal: What the heck happened? I mean, I thought he was doing great out at Kim and Bob's. At least I thought he was.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I think Paul knows what happened.",
        "Emily: What? What happened?",
        "Paul: Will got very upset at me because he found out I was trying to help exonerate you.",
        "Emily: Oh. I am so sorry. The last thing I want to do is come between you and your brother.",
        "Hal: I need to talk to Kim.",
        "Paul: So what do we do now?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I think we just step back, take a deep breath, okay? Emily, you know that I am happy that you're out of jail, and you know that I am on your side. But, sweetie, you've gotten so caught up in proving that your mother's guilty, that you are obsessed with this thing.",
        "Paul: No. No, I'm not.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, you are. I mean, you know I love you and I want the three of us to be a family.",
        "Paul: Well that's what I want, too.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then focus on us. The ones that love you.",
        "Barbara: Why don't you listen to your wife for a change, Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Will? Will are you here? It's Alison. I only want to talk. Okay? Will?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Will: Wait, Ali, don't go.",
        "Alison: Oh, Will! Thank God, I found you! Oh.",
        "Barbara: If Will wants to come home, and I'm the one that's keeping him away, then you throw me in jail, okay? Just so he can be happy.",
        "Paul: If that's a promise, Mother, I will do everything I can to make sure that happens.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Well, if you feel so strongly, why don't you call her?",
        "Dusty: Give me a break.",
        "Sierra: No, really, you can call Williams right now and propose to her. She'd be on the next flight out here. She would be in your arms by lunch. Go ahead, really, call her up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, isn't this cozy? My poor young son is out there somewhere, cold and alone. And instead of looking for him, his ungrateful, spiteful big brother is here trying to frame me for a crime I didn't commit?",
        "Paul: Go ahead, Hal. Ask her some questions. See what kind of answers she comes up with.",
        "Barbara: About what? Those cups and saucers you brought in for testing? You should have seen them, Rosanna, they swept in, emptied all the cupboards. It was very dramatic.",
        "Emily: You did it, you replaced the cups!",
        "Barbara: If I am so guilty, arrest me, Hal.",
        "Emily: You replaced everything, the minute you figured out that we were on to you. That's the only reason the lab didn't find a trace of the drug you slipped in my tea.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Emily. You are imagining things again. You just have to accept the fact that you were not drugged. You did things all on your own.",
        "Paul: Just like you were on your own when you went out and bought new china? You may as well admit it. The lab report all but backs it up.",
        "Barbara: You know, I really don't know what you're talking about. This is Emily's kitchen, Emily's house. If there's something suspicious about those dishes, you better ask your peroxide pal.",
        "Emily: You are really asking for it, lady!",
        "Hal: Easy, it's not worth it.",
        "Barbara: You know what? All I'm asking for is for this inquisition to stop. This is ridiculous. Can't you see what's happening here? Emily tried to frame Will and now she's got this noose around her neck. She's trying to wiggle out of it, like she always does. But the noose is getting tighter, isn't it darling?",
        "Paul: Don't let her get to you, Emily. This is the how she is when she's been caught red-handed. We know you're guilty. And it's only a matter of time before we prove it.",
        "Barbara: Can you hear yourself? Listen to yourself, Paul. Your little brother is out there somewhere. He needs you. He worships you. And how are you spending your time? With this vindictive witch. Who's got you convinced that your big, bad Momma has done things to make her do big, bad things against her Will?",
        "Emily: You did it! You know you did it!",
        "Barbara: You know, you need some anger management, Emily. I've got a great psychiatrist. I'll give you his name.",
        "Hal: Enough! All of you!",
        "Emily: Yeah, that's right. I've definitely had enough!",
        "Hal: Emily, wait!",
        "Rosanna: Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Will? I would really hate to think that you were hiding from me. But if you are, I get it. I know what it feels like when everything is messed up and you feel like there's no one you can trust. Whenever things went bad for me -- and believe me, they went really bad -- I would run away as far away as I could get and as fast as I could get there. But whether I knew it then or not, there was always someone there who understood me. And I -- I just want you to know that if you're here, I understand you, Will. I better go. Its freezing and I wouldn't want anyone to find me alone here.",
        "Will: Wait, Ali. Don't go yet.",
        "Alison: Oh! Will! Thank God I found you! Oh.",
        "Will: How'd you know where to look?",
        "Alison: Call it a hunch.",
        "Will: I guess everybody's pretty freaked out I'm off the radar, huh?",
        "Alison: Well, I only talked to Rosanna, but yeah, she was upset. So what happened? Why didn't you go back to Kim and Bob's last night?",
        "Will: You don't want to know.",
        "Alison: Sure I do.",
        "Will: No, really, I can't, okay? It doesn't matter.",
        "Alison: Of course it matters. Because it's the same reason that kept you from coming to me and Aaron's for help instead of sleeping in this ice-cold barn. It's because of Emily. I won't get bent out of shape about it, just tell me.",
        "Will: I found out Paul's trying to get Emily off the hook for what she did at Fairwinds. It's like everybody's bending over backwards to help her -- forget it.",
        "Alison: No, go on.",
        "Will: No. It's like he didn't believe a word I said. It's like the evidence we found didn't matter. It's like the lie detector test I took was a fluke. And -- I wasn't trying to get everybody bent out of shape. I just -- I couldn't face anybody last night the way I felt. And if you hate me for me being mad that Paul's helping Emily, I totally understand. She's your sister. And I guess some families still have that loyalty thing going for 'em.",
        "Alison: Of course I don't hate you? Haven't you figured it out yet?",
        "Will: Figured what out?",
        "Alison: That we're friends, you knucklehead. I care about you. No matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: So I said to myself, who better -- to have, my daughter. Let her stand in, in my stead.",
        "Jordan: With all due respect, Ms. Walsh --",
        "Lucinda: Ooh -- ooh, when I hear that, usually, respectful words do not follow. I would have thought you'd be pleased.",
        "Jordan: You are unbelievable.",
        "Lucinda: It's the best decision for the time being. With so much at stake in Europe, they do need me concentrating there. And I need Sierra here. And why wouldn't you love working with my daughter?",
        "Jordan: May I speak plainly for a minute?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely.",
        "Jordan: Off the record?",
        "Lucinda: Proceed.",
        "Jordan: If I were -- let's say by chance -- attracted to Sierra, and I'm not saying that I am. But if I were, she hasn't given me so much as an inkling that she feels the same way about me. We're friends, buddies. Nothing more.",
        "Lucinda: That would only enhance your working relationship.",
        "Jordan: You can stop the act, Lucinda. You're not fooling anybody. You're not putting Sierra in charge because it's what's best for the company.",
        "Lucinda: What other reason would I have?",
        "Jordan: You're trying to keep sierra away from Craig. And you think you can do that by pushing her in my direction.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no, no, my dear, you are quite mistaken.",
        "Jordan: No I'm not. You're using me. And I won't stand for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: You know, you don't fool me for a second, Dusty Donovan. If Lucy walked through that door right now, you'd do exactly the same thing. You'd let her go. No matter how much it hurt you.",
        "Dusty: You don't know me too well. 'Cause if Lucy walked though that door right now, I'd show her the ring. And if she still chose to leave, at least she'd leave knowing how much I love her -- enough to change my life for her.",
        "Sierra: Really?",
        "Dusty: Without a doubt.",
        "Sierra: Then if you feel so strongly, why don't you call her?",
        "Dusty: Give me a break.",
        "Sierra: No, really. You could call Williams right now and propose to her. She'd be on the next flight out here. She would be in your arms by lunch. Go ahead, really. Call her up, right here. Speed dial. One button and Lucy is yours.",
        "Sierra: Lucy's getting ready for her morning classes right now. She's probably homesick and just a little bit miserable. You could change her entire life with one phone call.",
        "Dusty: It's too late.",
        "Sierra: You and I both know that's not true. You're not calling her because you love her too much to put your own needs before hers. You love her so much that you let her go, no matter how much it hurts.",
        "Dusty: You proved your point. Are you happy?",
        "Sierra: No. No, I'm not. I'm just thankful that you would sacrifice so much for my daughter.",
        "Dusty: You could have sent me flowers.",
        "Sierra: You know, I know you want everybody to think that you're so tough. That you want to prove to the world that you're this bad, dangerous guy. But I know that's not true now. I know that because Lucy loved you. And Lucy knew that there was something worthwhile and wonderful about you. And she was right.",
        "Dusty: You're getting carried away.",
        "Sierra: No, no, no. Please, let me finish. When Alan died, you were my only ally, my only confidant. If it wasn't for you, I don't think that I could've gotten through that. And you saved Lucy's life so many times, and in so many ways -- and I just want some way that I could repay you for that.",
        "Dusty: Are you finished?",
        "Sierra: No. You tell me what I can do to help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: It might behoove you to remember to whom you are speaking. I am the lady that signs the checks, and gives you the opportunity to earn your stripes.",
        "Jordan: You are absolutely right. And I will always be thankful for your generosity. I don't mean to seem ungrateful. However, may I continue to speak frankly?",
        "Lucinda: Within limits.",
        "Jordan: I can't work for Sierra.",
        "Lucinda: You'd be working with Sierra.",
        "Jordan: As your pawn. You only want to put some guy in Sierra's path to lure her away from Craig. And I am not that guy.",
        "Lucinda: Hmm, you underestimate yourself, darling.",
        "Jordan: We've been through this before, Mrs. Walsh. Sierra is a lovely woman. We have grown to become good friends, but nothing more. She and Craig, they share children, history, decades of memories -- and nothing, not even Craig's miserable behavior, can break that. It would be pointless of me to be any part of an attempt to derail that relationship.",
        "Lucinda: Now, do I have to mention that I don't like ultimatums? And it sounds suspiciously to me like I've just heard one.",
        "Jordan: Well, then, I apologize in advance. Because if you insist on putting Sierra in charge --",
        "Lucinda: I do.",
        "Jordan: Then I respectfully submit my resignation from Worldwide. Effective immediately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: This is that medication I told you about. It intensifies suggestibility in patients who are about to undergo hypnosis. Now, does this look familiar? Does it stir any memories?",
        "Emily: No, nothing.",
        "Susan: I also asked Lynn Michaels if Barbara had approached her about that drug or anything else.",
        "Emily: What'd she say?",
        "Susan: She said that Barbara wouldn't have the nerve to come to her.",
        "Emily: That's just great. That's just great. Another dead end.",
        "Susan: Not necessarily. Barbara worked with a whole team of psychiatrists at the state hospital. Maybe I should make a few calls. I'll find out who handled her case and ask a few questions.",
        "Emily: You just listen to me. You be careful. Barbara cannot find out that we're working on this.",
        "Susan: Are you forgetting who you're speaking to? This is your sneaky Mom. I'm a lot sneakier than you or your sister ever gave me credit for. Especially when somebody is messing with one of my babies. So you just stay right here. I'll be back in a flash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I just feel like I don't belong anywhere. Like I'm a permanent guest at somebody else's party. Like I can't find a place to just sit and relax.",
        "Alison: And make yourself at home?",
        "Will: Yeah. Do you remember those toys we had when we were kids? That had the different-shaped objects you had to put in the matching-shaped holes?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Will: Well, I guess I feel like one of the pieces that just doesn't fit. You know, like something's a little off. Something's missing. Whatever.",
        "Alison: I know exactly what you're going through.",
        "Will: No, you don't.",
        "Alison: Please? You're looking at the poster girl for misfit toys. The toy no one wants to play with. The one that parents have recalled. The one that's a little dangerous.",
        "Will: Yeah?",
        "Alison: Yeah, it's in the genes. But you can't let that keep you down.",
        "Will: So, how'd you get over it?",
        "Alison: Well, I accepted the fact I couldn't fit into anyone else's idea of who I'm supposed to be. All I could do was be myself and let people know that I'm a pretty cool chick, once you get to know me. So give it a shot, 'cause you're a great guy.",
        "Will: Give me a break.",
        "Alison: Trust me. I wouldn't be freezing my you-know-what off if you weren't.",
        "Will: Try sleeping here.",
        "Alison: Well, that's going to be a one-time adventure for you, right? I mean, unless you're trying to win some extreme boy scout badge. But seriously, everyone wants to make sure that you're okay. You're okay, right?",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm okay.",
        "Alison: Absolutely. 'Cause you've got me -- every step of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I think Emily has shut off her cell.",
        "Barbara: If you expect me to apologize for what I --",
        "Hal: I have tried to be fair with you, but when you shoot off your mouth about my wife --",
        "Barbara: Are you forgetting what she and Paul have done here?",
        "Hal: Forget one more time that you're a lady, and so will I. Nothing you said out there helped your cause. You know that, right?",
        "Barbara: Nothing will change the fact that I am innocent.",
        "Hal: Except maybe the truth.",
        "Barbara: Can you tell me please why Will and I are being victimized here? You are holding me for questioning when you should be out there looking for him. Am I the only one worried about him?",
        "Rosanna: I am glad that you helped Emily. I really am. And if the police find out that Barbara's the one who's behind all this, then I hope she gets punished, I really do. But, you need to concentrate on us. On you, and me, and Will. Make things right at home before you try to save the world. From now on, let's just let Emily solve her own problems.",
        "Hal: We've got an APB out on him, Barbara! We're doing everything we can!",
        "Barbara: Then do more! You're his father, for God's sake!",
        "Paul: And if it weren't for his mother, Will would be at Fairwinds, where he belongs.",
        "Barbara: Okay, fine. Blame Barbara.",
        "Paul: You somehow managed to manipulate your way back into Hal's house -- you did everything you could to get Will out of Fairwinds. And now he's being dumped on whoever will take him in. No wonder he's out there looking for someplace safe!",
        "Barbara: If Will wants to come home and I'm the one that's keeping him away, then you throw me in jail, okay? Just so he can be happy.",
        "Paul: If that's a promise, Mother, I will do everything I can to make sure that happens. Hello, my darling. Your lush blossom beckons.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Well, did you talk to the shrink?",
        "Susan: You won't believe what he told me.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Susan: When he did the inventory of the meds at the end of the month, a vial of this suggestibility drug could not be accounted for.",
        "Emily: I knew it. I knew it. And what about Barbara?",
        "Susan: She was in his office only one week before they realized the vial was missing.",
        "Emily: What? A whole week? That's too big of a time frame. The defense will say that anything could have happened to the medication, including the fact that the doctor himself could been to blame. Thanks.",
        "Susan: No, it absolutely proves that that monster Barbara had access to a drug that could have put you under her control.",
        "Emily: I need to prove it. I need to find those cups and saucers. The ones that she swears that she didn't throw away.",
        "Susan: Can't Paul help you with that?",
        "Emily: No, I can't ask for Paul for his help. He's got problems of his own, right now.",
        "Susan: Well, you know, your sneaky Mom is here whenever you need me. Because no matter what, I believe you. Besides, I love you to pieces.",
        "Emily: You have no idea how much it means to me to hear you say that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Nothing would make me happier than seeing you behind bars.",
        "Barbara: Good luck putting me there, son.",
        "Hal: You and I will continue this conversation in the interrogation room.",
        "Barbara: Have you no shame? No shame at all?",
        "Paul: I'm ashamed of you. I used to love you. I used to respect you. I used to call you my mother. And now, look what you've turned into.",
        "Hal: We're finished for the day.",
        "Paul: We are not finished here.",
        "Hal: Paul, let it go.",
        "Paul: Oh! Can you believe this?",
        "Rosanna: Well, sure, after the year we've had? I can believe just about anything. But maybe you should listen to what Hal said. You know, let it go?",
        "Paul: She's lying. We can prove it.",
        "Rosanna: Then let the police put the pieces together, okay? Come on. Think about our lives. Think about Will. We have his party to plan.",
        "Paul: We can't plan a party for Will if we don't know where the host is. We should go find him.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, we'll find him. We will. And when we do, we'll reassure him how much we love him, how much we want him to be part of our family, part of our lives.",
        "Paul: Okay. That's going to take some time. I should find Emily, right, and explain? She'll understand, right?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Thanks.",
        "Paul: Thank you. Will?",
        "Will: Hey, Paul.",

        "Dusty: You really want to know what you can do for me?",
        "Sierra: Just name it.",
        "Dusty: You already did it, you know? When it came to me and Lucy, you always gave me the benefit of the doubt. You treated me like I mattered. That means a lot to me.",
        "Sierra: Well, you meant a lot to Lucy.",
        "Dusty: So, what's next for you?",
        "Sierra: Well, I think I'm gonna stay here for a while. Go work for my mother.",
        "Dusty: You're a brave woman.",
        "Sierra: Yeah, well it sorta runs in the family. I meant what I said. Don't be a stranger, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Ah, you're running low on vodka, dear.",
        "Lucinda: Well, there's plenty of hemlock. Why don't you start there?",
        "Craig: You don't mean it.",
        "Lucinda: Craig, you are a pestilence. You are a scourge. If you cannot find your way out of my house, I can have my Pilates instructor assist you through the door.",
        "Craig: No, I'm flexible. No need.",
        "Lucinda: What do you want from me?",
        "Craig: Sierra. I was waiting for her to return.",
        "Lucinda: From where?",
        "Craig: From Metro.",
        "Lucinda: If you think I'm kidding about the Pilates instructor --",
        "Craig: No, no, no. Tell her I'll see her later.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, has it not occurred to you that Sierra's a busy woman? That she might not have time to be a nursemaid for your every infantile need?",
        "Craig: Yes and no. Our infant has grown up and gone away, but I shall return.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, like the plague. Like the proverbial penny. [Sighs] I don't get it. Oh, okay. Hello, it's me. Listen very carefully. I have a wonderful opportunity for you -- at Worldwide. I think it's a job that you would be admirably suited for, and I want you to call me the moment you get this message.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Barbara: I think I need to tell you how far I'll go to make you happy.",
        "Mike: Just like there's no going back for Katie and me.",
        "Jennifer: But shouldn't somebody tell Katie?",
        "Jack: I guess I should have called first."
