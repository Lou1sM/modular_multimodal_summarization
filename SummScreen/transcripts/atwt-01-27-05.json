        "Jordan tells Jennifer that he's leaving Oakdale as Katie is asking Mike to be the contractor for the gym. Mike turns Katie down flat but Jennifer surprisingly advises him to take the job. Even though Henry is happy Mike won't do the work at the gym, when Katie cries, he offers to convince Mike to do the job. Despite Paul's advice, Will decides he can't put his mother back in jail and agrees to move back to Hal's house even though she's still there. When they go to tell Hal the good news, Paul and Emily show up with a bag full of the dishes Barbara had dumped \u0096 Emily having gained the information from her ankle bracelet's tracking system which was given to her by Tom. Lily tells Julia about the heartache her relationship with Holden is causing her family, Julia not at all sympathetic to her pleas. Meanwhile, Holden is trying to explain things to a stubborn Luc who points out that Julia may not have broken up the marriage but she made it easier for his dad not to care about it. He runs away when Julia shows up. As Julia and Holden are kissing, Jack comes in and reads Julia the riot act about using him so that she could make time with Holden, which of course Julia denies, Julia accusing Jack of being jealous. Carly finds a picture with Julia, JJ and a strange man that falls out of JJ's book. She calls Lily and when they ask JJ about it, he tells them that his name is Keith and he's his best friend. Once JJ leaves, Carly begins to track down the mysterious Keith."

        "Tom: Hi. Hey, I'm due in court in about an hour. You said this was urgent?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I have a favor to ask of you. A legal one.",
        "Tom: Did you run it by Hal?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Tom: Why not?",
        "Emily: For a lot of reasons, okay? I need to handle this on my own.",
        "Tom: Well, obviously not, if you're asking for my help.",
        "Emily: Look, if you wanna blast me, just do it. Just get it off your chest.",
        "Tom: I don't want to blast you. I'm not a bad guy. I am a dad trying to answer a lot of questions for Danny. Do you have any idea what this whole mess has done to him?",
        "Emily: No, Tom, hearing him cry to me over the phone every night is the highlight of my day.",
        "Tom: Okay. Let's start over, and drop the sarcasm.",
        "Emily: I'm not the bad guy! Okay? You saw the lab reports yourself.",
        "Tom: Yes, I did, and I know you say that Barbara drugged you, but there is no trace of drugs on any of the cups --",
        "Emily: Or anything else! Because Barbara replaced the entire set of dishes.",
        "Tom: That's what you think happened?",
        "Emily: It's the only thing that makes any sense! But I need to ask you to break a few rules around here to help me prove it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rosanna and I waited for over an hour -- thank you. We waited for over an hour for you, will. We wanted to spend a little time with you after you saw Hal.",
        "Will: I didn't really feel like talking, so I went out the back way.",
        "Paul: Where were you before we saw you at the police station?",
        "Will: I was around.",
        "Paul: Well, Aunt Kim was really worried about you when she saw that your bed wasn't slept in. She looked everywhere for you. We all did.",
        "Will: When did you have time for that? I thought you were busy defending Emily.",
        "Paul: I wasn't helping Emily to try and hurt you, Will.",
        "Will: Paul, I saw her with my own eyes holding the evidence. And you said you believed me. And now you believe something totally different.",
        "Paul: That's right. I now know that Barbara's behind what Emily did to Rosanna. I just can't prove it yet.",
        "Barbara: Because I'm innocent.",
        "Paul: Get out of here, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Watch your tone, son.",
        "Paul: Fine. Get out of here -- please.",
        "Barbara: Not until will knows the truth. I don't suppose you've shared with him what I told you last night.",
        "Paul: Will, come on, let's get out of here --",
        "Barbara: No, I made a decision, honey. I think I need to tell you how far I'll go to make you happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: All right, you've got half the closet and the bottom two-thirds of the dresser.",
        "Jennifer: Everything fit?",
        "Mike: Believe it or not. We'll find out what to do with these books later. I wasn't really sure what to do with this. Bathroom door hook or closet?",
        "Jennifer: Hook -- next to yours.",
        "Mike: Hmm. I hope all decisions are this easy.",
        "Jennifer: Redhead, temper -- don't count on it.",
        "Mike: I know a way to stop arguments dead in their tracks.",
        "Jennifer: You do?",
        "Mike: Yes, in four easy steps.",
        "Jennifer: What's step one?",
        "Mike: Step one is we take all our clothes off --",
        "Jennifer: Ah, I like it so far.",
        "Mike: Yeah, step two is we stand on opposites sides of the room and stare at each other.",
        "Jennifer: How long does that last?",
        "Mike: It doesn't. That was step three, in case you were wondering. And if you come back to bed with me, I will show you step four.",
        "Jennifer: Remind me to get in a fight with you as soon as I get home. I should be going, I should be going.",
        "Mike: What did Jordan say when he called?",
        "Jennifer: Just that he wanted to see me. We're meeting at Lucinda's.",
        "Mike: Something up with the company?",
        "Jennifer: I don't think so. He said it was personal.",
        "Mike: How personal?",
        "Jennifer: Not that personal. Jordan knows there's no going back for us.",
        "Mike: Just like there's no going back with Katie and me.",
        "Jennifer: You keep saying that -- but shouldn't somebody tell Katie?",
        "[Mike sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why are you making such a big deal out of this? It's just a phone call.",
        "Henry: What is this?",
        "Katie: Just read it to Mike word for word.",
        "Henry: I can't say this.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Henry: \"Mike, without your help, all of Katie's dreams, all her career plans, will never come true.\"",
        "Katie: Okay, so improvise. Say whatever you want. Henry, if Mike doesn't fix up the gym, we can't reopen. If we don't reopen, we don't get the money. If we don't get the money, we don't get married. [Henry sighs] Please, just call Mike, and I will never ask you for anything again.",
        "Henry: Yes, you will. And the answer is still no.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Henry: Because I don't want to! That's why.",

        "Julia: Nice place. What's this supposed to do, scare me?",
        "Lily: Scare you?",
        "Julia: Yeah, what are you trying to do? Remind me of whose family has the clout in this town?",
        "Lily: No, I just asked my mother if we could meet here because I couldn't talk to you at my house.",
        "Julia: Why not?",
        "Lily: Because my children are there. And they're upset and confused. They miss their father, Julia. And I know things didn't work out here the way that you wanted them to, but please don't punish our children because of it. Don't take Holden away from his family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dad?",
        "Holden: Hey. You okay? Listen, I understand why you told your mom about seeing Julia and me. But I wished that you had come to me and talked to me about it first.",
        "Luke: Did you talk to me before you got yourself a new girlfriend?",
        "Holden: Hey, hey -- can we just take it down a notch?",
        "Luke: What, you want to act like it's no big deal?",
        "Holden: That's not true. It is a big deal. My being with Julia -- it's a very big deal. And I'm not gonna stand here and pretend to you, or anybody else, that it's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, you got your homework in here?",
        "J.J.: Red folder.",
        "Jack: Okay, got it.",
        "J.J.: Dad, its library day.",
        "Jack: Oh, library day. All right. Check. [Horn beeps] There's Mrs. Palmer. Okay, buddy, let's go. Grab your hat.",
        "Carly: Don't forget your lunch.",
        "Jack: Thank you, Carly. All right, let's go.",
        "Carly: You're welcome. Have a nice day, J.J.",
        "Jack: Oh -- spelling test day. There, their and they're -- you got them?",

        "Mike: How did Katie make her way into this conversation?",
        "Jennifer: She must be in the air.",
        "Mike: Not in my air.",
        "Jennifer: You know, and even if this engagement is a joke --",
        "Mike: It is.",
        "Jennifer: It just goes to show how far she'll go to get you back.",
        "Mike: I don't want to go back. I want to go forward with you.",
        "Jennifer: So what you're saying -- I should wish her and Henry the best?",
        "Mike: Why not? I want Katie to have a great life. Not because I love her, but because I loved her.",
        "Jennifer: That's way too healthy for my DNA.",
        "Mike: I'm just -- I'm too happy to want anything less for other people.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, okay, I will try to wish her the best instead of wishing her gone. But no promises.",
        "Mike: None expected.",
        "Jennifer: So we're not gonna argue?",
        "Mike: Afraid not.",
        "Jennifer: Too bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Henry, you never say no to me.",
        "Henry: No, not the eyes, Katie. Don't give me the sad eyes. I can't take it.",
        "Katie: Well, I am sad.",
        "Henry: Why? Why, because I won't ask Mike to work on the gym?",
        "Katie: No, because you won't tell me why you won't ask Mike to work at the gym.",
        "Henry: Because it's -- it's not good for you.",
        "Katie: What? Mike is good for me. I'm the one who made the mistakes.",
        "Henry: Uh, sorry, if memory serves, Pilar Domingo was not your mistake, so --",
        "Katie: That is ancient history.",
        "Henry: Okay, let's talk about the present. What I'm saying is that my asking Mike is not good for you. You should do it yourself.",
        "Katie: Henry, you're the one who pitched this engagement. You're the one who pitched this wedding, and it was all to get Mike back.",
        "Henry: Yeah, it was a good plan. It still is. A rock-solid plan.",
        "Katie: Well, if I ask Mike to work at the gym, he's gonna think it's a trick.",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, if I ask him, he's gonna think it's an even bigger trick. Come on! What have I always told you? Play the hand you're dealt.",
        "Katie: Mike practically runs away every time I see him.",
        "Henry: Then chase him.",
        "Katie: What if he turns me down?",
        "Henry: Well, like the song says, love hurts.",
        "Katie: This is not helping.",
        "Henry: Okay. Okay, you want my advice? Here's what you do. You look him in the eye, and you get that little catch in your voice. You know, the one that makes guys melt. Then you flash the rock. Let him know that the clock is ticking down to our little happy day. Then see if he sweats -- metaphorically speaking. I say the odds are 50-50 he'll take the job.",
        "Katie: Which does mean 18-hour days side by side, never out of each other's sight.",
        "Henry: Yeah. What man in his right mind could resist that?",
        "Katie: Okay. Okay, I'll go to his place right now. Henry -- you are the best.",
        "Henry: If I'm the best, how come I don't get the girl?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I said, sit.",
        "Luke: I don't want to.",
        "Holden: Sit. Luke, I have always tried to be honest with you. You know that your mother and I have been having problems.",
        "Luke: But you always told me that when you're in love with somebody, you -- you talk it over. You get through your problems.",
        "Holden: We tried.",
        "Luke: Well, try harder!",
        "Holden: We gave it everything we had. We did it for over a year. Nothing worked.",
        "Luke: So you and Julia are like a couple now?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I'm seeing her --",
        "Luke: So it's okay to have a wife and a girlfriend?",
        "Holden: Luke, I'm trying to talk to you like an adult.",
        "Luke: No, you're treating me like a little kid who doesn't know what's going on. But I do. I know that if you're still married, it's called cheating.",
        "Holden: Your mother and I haven't lived as a married couple for a very long time.",
        "Luke: But you tell me to always do the right thing. Well, I guess you don't have to. I mean, you don't care about me or Mom or Faith or Natalie! You don't care about anybody but yourself!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: This is a strange town. You have two sets of rules here. You have one for the insiders and another one for the rest of us who dare to try to fit in.",
        "Lily: Oh, no, no, no, no. The rules are always the same. Married men are off limits.",
        "Julia: Yeah, maybe happily married men.",
        "Lily: We were happy -- once. And we could be happy again. Holden and I were working on our marriage.",
        "Julia: Well, I'm not stopping you from working on your marriage.",
        "Lily: Of course you are!",
        "Julia: No, you know what, Lily? The pain here -- I didn't cause it. You did.",
        "Lily: What about what Luke saw? Is that my fault, too?",
        "Julia: Holden and I thought we were alone. I'm sorry that Luke saw something he shouldn't have. Holden's talking to him right now.",
        "Lily: How do you explain that to a boy Luke's age?",
        "Julia: I trust Holden. Don't you?",
        "Lily: It's you I don't trust.",
        "Julia: Your marriage is over, Lily, because sometimes marriages don't work out, even when you give it your best shot. You can't accept that? You gotta find someone to blame, you wanna find someone to trash, that's fine. But you know what? We're really not that different.",
        "Lily: Don't compare us, please.",
        "Julia: No, really. We both want what's best for our kids. And we agree on what, or who, that is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, it's freezing out there. Sorry, the way things are so crazy this morning.",
        "Carly: Oh, no crazier than normal.",
        "Jack: Yeah? J.J. was pretty rude.",
        "Carly: That's understandable. He heard me saying some pretty nasty things about his mom.",
        "Jack: We'll move on. We all will.",
        "Carly: Julia has certainly moved on, hasn't she?",
        "Jack: I know. I want to go out to the farm and talk to her.",
        "Carly: About what?",
        "Jack: About the way she set up this whole thing so she could be alone with Holden. About the way she used J.J. and put us in the middle.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe you ought to try to see it from her point of view.",
        "Jack: Who are you and what have you done with my wife?",
        "Carly: You've been telling me for days that being in attack mode isn't gonna do anything. And if the point is to get more time with J.J., then maybe you ought to stick with the high road, right?",
        "Jack: It's not gonna be easy.",
        "Carly: Nothing worth fighting for ever is.",
        "Jack: I love you.",
        "Carly: I love you, too. Call me, okay? Hey, it's me.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Carly: Are you okay?",
        "Lily: I just spoke to Julia.",
        "Carly: Oh. Lucky you.",
        "Lily: She wants Holden. And she's not gonna stop.",
        "Carly: Well, then we're just gonna have to make her stop.",
        "Lily: How?",
        "Carly: You get over here and I'll tell you. \"To my happy family with love, forever.\"",

        "Tom: So, what exactly is it that you want from me?",
        "Emily: The records from Barbara's ankle bracelet. I need to know where she went and when she got there.",
        "Tom: So you want to retrace her steps?",
        "Emily: Exactly. So I can figure out where she dumped the dishes. Once I find them, I have them tested -- I can prove that woman drugged me.",
        "Tom: Well, Emily, she could have gone 100 different places.",
        "Emily: Fine, then I'll go to 100 different places.",
        "Tom: Just because you retrace her steps doesn't mean you're gonna find what you're looking for.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, I have to try. Okay, if not for me, then for our son. Please, Daniel needs his mother, Tom. Please!",
        "Tom: I know. Sean, would you get me the latest printout on Barbara Ryan's surveillance, please?",
        "Emily: Tom, thank you.",
        "Tom: We will start the first day when she got a wider range.",
        "Emily: Okay, so it will show exactly where she went the minute she left my house?",
        "Tom: Absolutely.",
        "Cop: Here you go, Mr. Hughes.",
        "Emily: Oh, my. I didn't realize it would be so detailed. Okay, here. Here's the day.",
        "Tom: Looks like she went straight to the Lakeview. Nothing unusual.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but where at the Lakeview?",
        "Tom: Somewhere outside the complex. There's no street. I mean, global tracking sometimes misses that and private streets, alleyways.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Exterior, no known street name. What was Barbara doing at some mysterious spot outside the Lakeview?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Honey -- I know how much you love your Aunt Kim and your Uncle Bob, and it's been great that you've been able to stay with them, but -- you need to be with your dad. I know he's let you down recently, but he's human. He adores you.",
        "Will: I love him, too.",
        "Barbara: Then you should be together. You know what I've learned these last few weeks? If you live in a place where you knew happiness, happiness returns.",
        "Paul: What are you, the Dalai Lama?",
        "Barbara: Will, look, I -- come home.",
        "Will: Mom, you know I can't move home.",
        "Barbara: I know. Because of me. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about just you and your dad.",
        "Will: No, no. I'm fine at Aunt Kim's.",
        "Barbara: No, you're -- Will, if you come home, I'll move out.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Barbara: I will, I swear.",
        "Will: If you leave Dad's, Mom, the only place you can go is back to jail.",
        "Barbara: I would much rather live in a prison cell than see you unhappy. Please, Will -- come home where you belong.",

        "Lily: Are you sure the guy in this picture is not Julia's ex?",
        "Carly: I met Les. That is not him.",
        "Lily: Well, then who is it?",
        "Carly: Beats me. He sure thought of Julia and J.J. as his family, though. You see a pattern here? It's really scary.",
        "Lily: You think Jack would know who he is?",
        "Carly: Well, I don't know. There's a date on the picture. Look -- it was taken a few months before Jack got there.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "Carly: Julia could have dumped this guy before she even met Jack.",
        "Lily: Or he dumped her.",
        "Carly: Right. All we know for sure is that when this picture was taken, they were very lovey-dovey. I wonder what would happen if, let's say, someone were to arrange for this guy to show up in Oakdale.",
        "Lily: Oh, Carly -- I mean, if this guy is anything like Julia's ex-husband --",
        "Carly: No, I know. I thought of that. I wouldn't want to expose anybody to another psycho. We'll have to learn more about him first.",
        "Lily: How do we do that?",
        "Carly: Watch and learn.",
        "Lily: Who are you calling?",
        "Carly: The one person who can fill us in on our mystery man. Little J.J.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I need you to understand that I really do wish that things had turned out differently. I have loved your mother ever since I wasn't much older than you are.",
        "Luke: Well, then what changed?",
        "Holden: Everything changes. That's what happens in life. And through most of it, your mother and I managed to get even closer.",
        "Luke: But not now?",
        "Holden: No. And not for a very long while.",
        "Luke: Since Aunt Rose died?",
        "Holden: Even before. We have tried. We tried very hard to make it all work. You know that.",
        "Luke: Well, why can't you keep trying?",
        "Holden: Because it just -- it got to a place where it wasn't good for me, or your mom. Or for you and your two sisters.",
        "Luke: That's not what happened. You stopped 'cause of her, Dad. You stopped 'cause that Julia lady made it easy to stop.",
        "Holden: Luke -- Luke!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: I'm sorry. I had no idea he was still here.",
        "Holden: It's okay. I wasn't getting very far.",
        "Julia: He looks like he's mad at the world.",
        "Holden: Oh, he is.",
        "Julia: I'm so sorry, Holden.",
        "Holden: It's not your fault.",
        "Julia: It feels like it is. I feel like everything is my fault here.",
        "Holden: What's wrong?",
        "Julia: Lily called me over to her mom's house, and she basically gave me the body count of all the lives that I've ruined -- hers, yours, the kids.",
        "Holden: She had no right to do that.",
        "Julia: I would have done the same thing if I were in her shoes.",
        "Holden: And was it -- bad?",
        "Julia: No, it wasn't too bad. I held my own. You know, ever since I met Jack, I feel like I've been on this roller coaster ride that was just spinning out of control, you know? You're like the calm in this great big storm. And I want to hold onto that. And I want to hold onto you, and I never want to let go.",
        "Jack: Guess I should have called first.",

        "Jack: I don't like being used. Tell me, Julia, when did that become part of the fun?",

        "Barbara: I have made so many mistakes. I've been a terrible mother. I have let you down and failed you over and over. And this is a chance to make -- make things right. I mean, the thought of you this unhappy is worse than any prison cell they could put me in.",
        "Will: Well, if you did go back, how long would it be?",
        "Barbara: I don't know. That's not for you to worry about. I just want you back at your dad's so you can enjoy life again. Make new friends, do things that other kids do. If you're happy, then I'll be happy.",

        "Jordan: Jen, I haven't been happy since -- I don't remember when. When I lost Cabot, something short-circuited inside of me. And then on top of that, I -- God help me, I lost you, too. And -- Jen, I know I've said this a dozen times before, but I just want to say it one more time before I go. That night that I turned to Rosanna, it was out of grief, not love.",

        "Jennifer: Jordan, I should have trusted you more. For some reason, I couldn't. But you know what I've learned? Is that it doesn't matter how hard you work at a relationship. If you don't trust the person you love, you have nothing.",

I have great ideas for what to do with it, but doing all that and then planning this wedding -- it's just -- I'm pressed for time.",

        "Mike: Katie, for the last time -- all right, I'm not upset about your so- called wedding. I'm not jealous of Henry, okay? And using this gym to keep me in your life is not an option. It will not work. All right, so I'm gonna write down the name of a competitor. You give him a call. Tell him that you are a friend of mine. He will cut you a fair price.",
