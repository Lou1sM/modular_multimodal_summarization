        "Meg: Damian is still paying him. I thought you believed me.",
        "Holden: I do.",

        "Damian: You see, I take care of you.",
        "Lily: You do. Thank you.",

        "Lily: I know, I know, but it just feels like we packed up and left them.",

        "Molly: Oh, come on. You and I both know that everything she's saying is the truth.",
        "Damian: As long as Holden never finds that out -- you haven't told them what Officer Grady told you, have you?",
        "Molly: That you bribed him to keep his mouth shut about Holden's DNA test? No.",

        "Casey: What's wrong?",
        "Alison: Emily's discharging herself.",

        "Lily: What?",
        "Damian: We're flying to Malta.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about?",
        "Damian: While I was downstairs, I made all the arrangements. There's an airport nearby, and my company jet is meeting us there.",
        "Lily: Damian, I can't go to Malta.",
        "Damian: Why not? Think about it. By this time tomorrow afternoon, we'll be on the beach.",
        "Lily: No. I need to go home and take care of Natalie and Ethan.",
        "Damian: They're with Emma and Holden. Lily, Lily, look. We never had a proper honeymoon. I want to give you that.",
        "Lily: I know you do, and I love you for it, but this isn't the time.",
        "Damian: Look, there's never been a good time before. That's why I decided we just have to do it.",
        "Lily: That's not for you to decide on your own.",
        "Damian: Lily, I promise you, once we're there on the terrace sipping champagne, watching the sun set into the Mediterranean, you won't ever want to leave.",
        "Lily: It sounds lovely and I love the surprise, but the only place I'm going is home.",
        "Damian: Lily!",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. That's final.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I wish there was something else I could do to help.",
        "Holden: Yeah, so do I. We're just gonna have to leave it to the people here.",
        "Molly: I am so sorry.",
        "Holden: Molly, don't be. You did everything you could. You put yourself in danger to try and get Grady to open up.",
        "Molly: Not really.",
        "Holden: Look, this means a lot to me. I appreciate it, and I know Meg appreciates it, too.",
        "Molly: I just wanted to help.",
        "Holden: You did. Look, I'm the one who should be saying I'm sorry. I'm the one who got you involved in this conspiracy theory of Meg's. I made you investigate Lily's husband.",
        "Molly: I was happy to help, for Meg and for you.",
        "Holden: What you've done, I'll never forget.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What do you want?",

        "Emily: I'm right here.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I'm sorry that I thought you called the cops on Meg. I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: I just wish you believed me right from the beginning.",
        "Paul: So do I. Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.",
        "Emily: I forgive you.",
        "Paul: Just like that?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm. Just like that.",
        "Paul: You're not even gonna make me work for it?",
        "Emily: You don't have to do that.",
        "Paul: Really? 'Cause I would do whatever you wanted. Really, I'd do anything.",
        "Emily: Ooh, really?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Well, that I might hold you to.",
        "Paul: I hope so. What are you doing here?",
        "Emily: I called him.",
        "Paul: You did? Why? And why do you have a bag?",
        "Emily: Well, you said if there was anything I wanted, all I had to do was ask.",
        "Paul: Oh, no. I should probably have qualified that.",
        "Emily: I want Mick to stay with us.",
        "Paul: Are you serious? You want him to stay here?",
        "Emily: Okay, will you -- you were the one -- you were the one who said that we can still try to make a baby. We need Mick to do that.",
        "Paul: No. We don't need Mick to make a baby.",
        "Emily: Yes, we do.",
        "Paul: No, we don't. Come on, Emily. He's the reason that you were in a coma.",
        "Emily: No, he isn't.",
        "Paul: How do you know? What, because he told you so?",
        "Emily: Would you stop that?",
        "Paul: You stop it. I don't want him hanging around here.",
        "Mick: What about what Emily wants?",
        "Paul: Are you joking? You must be kidding.",
        "Emily: Okay. You're the one who just -- excuse me! You're the one who just said you would do anything that I asked.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but not that. This was your idea, wasn't it?",
        "Emily: No, it was mine.",
        "Mick: I'm sorry to come for this. I thought Emily already had this discussion with you.",
        "Paul: Well, you thought wrong.",
        "Mick: Well, I don't want to cause any problems.",
        "Paul: Well, then, maybe you should just walk right back out the way you came in.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no. Please, just stop.",
        "Paul: Emily!",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. Could you just wait in the other room for five minutes while I have a conversation with my very hard-headed husband?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Lily, Lily. We need time to ourselves. We need to spend long days in the sun and long nights making love. That's the only way we're gonna make a real baby and not another false alarm.",
        "Lily: You are not listening to me. I'm not ready to get pregnant again.",
        "Damian: Okay, I understand that.",
        "Lily: Look, Damian, it's a wonderful gesture, it really is, and I would love to just drop everything and go, but that's not me. I can't live my life like that. We need to talk, plan things in advance, especially if you want this to be our honeymoon.",
        "Damian: Come on. Sometimes in life we have to be spontaneous.",
        "Lily: I can't. I need to at least talk to Holden first.",
        "Damian: Aah! Why does everything have to come back to Holden?",
        "Lily: It doesn't.",
        "Damian: You can't even put two sentences together without his name being in one of them.",
        "Lily: That's not true. Why are you acting like this?",
        "Damian: Because I'm sick and tired of his name coming out of your mouth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I can't stand seeing my sister like that. I feel like I let her down.",
        "Molly: But you didn't. You're doing everything you possibly can for her.",
        "Holden: No. I mean now. I mean while it was happening. She totally lost grasp of reality, and I totally missed it.",
        "Molly: That's not your fault.",
        "Holden: I don't know. Maybe it's because I was just distracted by my own problems.",
        "Molly: You can't beat yourself up about this, Holden.",
        "Holden: It's hard not to, being out here at the farm.",
        "Molly: Maybe you should get away for a while, you know? You can't help Meg if you don't take care of yourself.",
        "Holden: You know what? Maybe you're right. The kids have a long weekend coming up. It might be good to go visit Abigail.",
        "Molly: Really?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Be good for us to get away and, I don't know, be more of a family.",
        "Molly: I'd really like that.",
        "Holden: Let's do it. What? What is it?",
        "Molly: I can't do this anymore.",
        "Holden: Do what?",
        "Molly: I have to tell you the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You saw the way he acted. He wanted to leave. He felt bad that he was coming between us.",
        "Paul: Well, then he should go bye. Goodbye. Bye-Mick.",
        "Emily: He's not gonna go. I need him here. You said that you would give me anything I want. This is what I want.",
        "Alison: Emily? Oh, it's true, you're awake! I can't believe it!",
        "Emily: Oh, Alison!",
        "Alison: How do you feel? Why are you down here? You should be upstairs resting.",
        "Emily: It's good to see you, too. I don't need to rest. I feel good.",
        "Alison: But you were comatose for days! You must have lost a lot of your strength!",
        "Emily: No. No, that's the weird thing. I didn't. I feel better than ever.",
        "Alison: That's impossible.",
        "Emily: I know, but it's true.",
        "Alison: Oh, God! I'm sorry, I just -- I never thought that you were gonna be able to be at my wedding, and now you're --",
        "Emily: Alison, do you think there's anything that would keep me away?",
        "Alison: Oh, God, it's so good to see you.",
        "Emily: Oh, Honey, it's good to see you.",
        "Alison: So, do you remember what happened? I mean what happened before you passed out?",
        "Emily: No, not a thing.",
        "Alison: Well, what did Mom say about how they brought you back out?",
        "Emily: No, they didn't. Mick did.",
        "Alison: Mick did? You're here?",
        "Mick: Yeah, but I'm gonna get going. You've been through a lot. Your family wants to spend time with you. I don't want to be in the way.",
        "Emily: You're not in the way. Ali, Mick is the one who figured out what was wrong with me and was able to reverse it.",
        "Alison: That's amazing. We owe you so much.",
        "Mick: Don't worry about it.",
        "Emily: Ali's right, Mick. You saved my life. I don't know what I'd do without you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to blow up like that.",
        "Lily: I understand.",
        "Damian: No. You're in a tough situation. I shouldn't be making it worse.",
        "Lily: You aren't.",
        "Damian: I just feel like our marriage has never really had a chance, you know? Just right from the start, at our wedding, when Holden returned from the dead, and then when we were renewing our vows, Meg poisoned our cake. It's never been about us.",
        "Lily: Meg is locked away at Deerbrook where she can't hurt anyone else, and Holden isn't an issue anymore. He's with Molly.",
        "Damian: He's part of your life, Lily. You see him almost every day.",
        "Lily: That's just because of the kids. Look, I know it's not easy, but we can deal with it.",
        "Damian: I'd like to believe that, but I feel like forces are trying to pull us apart.",
        "Lily: Only if we let them.",
        "Damian: That's why I planned this trip, Lily. You're the love of my life. You're my wife, and I feel like we never have time to simply be together.",
        "Lily: We will. I promise you.",
        "Damian: Well, then, just let's do it. Let's do it. I'm begging you. Come away with me right now.",
        "Lily: What? What is going on here?",
        "Damian: What do you mean?",
        "Lily: Why are you acting so desperate?",
        "Damian: Because I love you so much.",
        "Lily: Is that the only reason?",
        "Damian: Of course. What else could it be?",
        "Lily: I don't know. You tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: He got to me, Holden.",
        "Holden: Who did?",
        "Molly: He has his way of making you think he's right, even when you know he's not.",
        "Holden: Molly, I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Molly: Damian! I'm talking about Damian! You know, I never could understand how he could convince Lily to marry him when you were still alive.",
        "Holden: She thought I wasn't.",
        "Molly: Yeah, but how could she think that? You two have been soul mates your whole lives. How could she not know? But that's what he does. He gets you to think like he does until you believe everything he says.",
        "Holden: Molly, you're not making any sense here.",
        "Molly: But you -- you're nothing like Damian.",
        "Holden: And neither are you.",
        "Molly: Yes, I am.",
        "Holden: Molly, what does Damian have to do with all of this?",
        "Molly: If I tell you, you're probably gonna hate me the rest of my life.",
        "Holden: No, no. I could never. I would never hate you.",
        "Molly: Grady admitted that Damian paid him off. I'm sorry. I know I should have told you sooner. I'm so sorry.",
        "Holden: He said that? So, why didn't you tell me?",
        "Molly: I'm stupid. I let him convince me.",
        "Holden: You let who convince you?",
        "Molly: Damian! Holden, I'm so sorry.",
        "Holden: Okay. I want you to tell me exactly what Grady said.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. He said he took money from the man that wanted to marry your wife to hide the fact that the DNA evidence of the body that he found in the truck did not match yours.",
        "Holden: So Damian knew. He knew that I was alive.",
        "Molly: But he said that he was sure that they would find out that you died someplace else, and he was trying to spare Lily the pain of losing you twice.",
        "Holden: That's not why. He wanted Lily for himself. He wanted her to think that I was dead so that she would marry him!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: Somebody would have found out what was wrong with your sister. I just happened to stumble across it.",
        "Alison: I'd still like to know how you did it.",
        "Paul: Well, then why don't you two go somewhere cozy and you can discuss it.",
        "Emily: Now?",
        "Paul: Yeah, now. You need to get some rest.",
        "Emily: I'm not tired.",
        "Paul: You need to get some rest.",
        "Mick: Paul's right. You should lie down for a while.",
        "Emily: Okay. Thank you for everything. You want to tuck me in?",
        "Paul: Yeah, of course. This isn't finished.",
        "Alison: What the hell's going on?",
        "Mick: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: I'm just supposed to believe that you just happened to figure out what was wrong with her?",
        "Mick: I told you, it was an accident.",
        "Alison: My sister sure doesn't seem to think so.",
        "Mick: Well, she's been through a lot.",
        "Alison: Yeah, no kidding. My mother was baffled. The entire research staff of Memorial couldn't explain why she went into a coma and couldn't figure out how to get her out of it.",
        "Mick: They would have.",
        "Alison: But you did. A new-age vagabond with mysterious plants did what none of them could.",
        "Mick: I'm just lucky, I guess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Emily: Mick's great, isn't he? We are so lucky to have him in our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: She was in a coma. She doesn't remember what happened to her or why.",
        "Mick: Well, it's not that mysterious, Alison. Research is trial and error.",
        "Alison: This isn't about your research! This is about the way that you've just -- you've pushed yourself into my sister's life, into her house, into her marriage!",
        "Mick: Oh, you think I'm trying to break up their marriage?",
        "Alison: I don't know what you want or who you even are. Are you the guy in the bell tower who doesn't know who he is or the medical researcher with the nosebleeds and migraines who will not see a doctor? Or are you the guy on the window ledge spying on me as I sleep?",
        "Mick: I never did that.",
        "Alison: I saw you.",
        "Mick: No, you're wrong. I was never on a ledge.",
        "Alison: Then why did I see you?",
        "Mick: Well, you said that you've been dreaming of me lately.",
        "Alison: I wasn't dreaming. This has to stop. You are messing with my head and it has to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Why would you listen to Damian about anything?",
        "Molly: I don't know. Because he made sense at the time, or at least I thought he did.",
        "Holden: I want to know what he said. Molly, I want to know!",
        "Molly: He told me that if Lily found out what he'd done, that she would throw him out and come running back to you.",
        "Holden: And then what, I would just drop you because Lily came knocking on my door?",
        "Molly: Wouldn't you?",
        "Holden: It's over with her.",
        "Molly: Yeah, but it's been over before.",
        "Holden: This time it's different.",
        "Molly: How do I know that? Holden, I just barely got out of a relationship with that idiot congressman in New York where I was the other woman, and the thought of being in that position --",
        "Holden: Molly, you were never the other woman!",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. I am so sorry I lied to you. I just wanted us to work out so badly.",
        "Holden: Well, then you should have trusted me.",
        "Molly: But I didn't. And now I've thrown away any chance we ever had of making it work, haven't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I feel like there's more going on here than you're telling me.",
        "Damian: No, there's not.",
        "Lily: Then why are you so desperate to go away again?",
        "Damian: Because I love you so much, Lily. I don't want to lose you again.",
        "Lily: Why would you lose me?",
        "Damian: I'm afraid.",
        "Lily: Of Holden? Damian, it's over forever. You've got to believe me.",
        "Damian: I do.",
        "Lily: Then there's no reason for you to drag me away again. All I've ever wanted is for you to be a part of my everyday life. I thought you wanted that, too.",
        "Damian: I do.",
        "Lily: Good. Let's go home. We can go to Malta another time. Why don't you go settle the bill and I'll pack, and I'll meet you downstairs?",
        "Damian: Okay. I'm sorry. I just -- I really do love you so much.",
        "Lily: I love you, too.",
        "[Door unlocking]",
        "Damian: Lily? I thought you were meeting me downstairs. I was waiting. Why haven't you packed? Oh, I see. You got a much better idea than rushing home to our normal, everyday lives. Well, that's all I want, Cara, for us to be alone together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: I'm not trying to mess up your life.",
        "Alison: I don't care if you're trying to or not. It's what you're doing! I'm about to marry a great guy with a great family, my sister's awake, I have a good job, and for the first time in years, I feel like I'm finally on solid ground, and you keep -- you keep --",
        "Mick: What?",
        "Alison: Messing with my head, just finding your way into my dreams!",
        "Mick: Well, maybe your dreams are your brain's way of saying that this life that you think is so wonderful, it isn't what you really want.",
        "Alison: That's ridiculous.",
        "Mick: Oh, I've seen you with Casey. I've seen his, uh, wonderful family. What an honor, that they think you're worthy of being one of them.",
        "Alison: You don't know anything about them!",
        "Mick: No, but I do know about you, and I know you don't want to spend the rest of your life trying to live up to some fantasy family in some collage on Casey's wall.",
        "Alison: I thought you said you weren't spying on me. How would you even know about that collage?",
        "Mick: I was checking up on you.",
        "Alison: Who asked you to do that?",
        "Mick: I care about you.",
        "Alison: Well, stop! I don't want you to!",
        "Mick: Well, I can't help it!",
        "Alison: You just need to leave, okay?",
        "Mick: No! No! I'm not going anywhere yet. I'm too close to my goal.",
        "Alison: What goal? What are you talking about?",
        "Mick: My research. And the truth is, you're distracting me. You know, this thing between us.",
        "Alison: There's nothing between us.",
        "Mick: Oh, there is something between us, and you know it, too.",
        "Alison: No, I don't.",
        "Mick: Why do you keep dreaming about me? You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to me. There is a connection here, and you know it.",
        "Alison: Just stop! Just stop. Don't come anywhere near me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You just got out of the hospital.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know, and it's been a very, very long time since I've made love to my husband.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know. Your sister's downstairs. Mick. They're right there.",
        "Emily: Well, they can wait.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You know what I think?",
        "Emily: No. You know what? Don't think. Lift your arms and get over here and make love to me.",
        "[Emily giggles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Am I right? Did I blow it for us?",
        "Holden: I can't answer that.",
        "Molly: It's too soon. Yeah. I know how much you hate lying, Holden, and that's the reason I knew I had to tell you.",
        "Holden: You know what? Forget about me. What about Meg? She was at Deerbrook this whole time, and for what? For what, Molly? She was telling the truth the whole time!",
        "Molly: I know.",
        "Holden: You know? Did you even think about that, after you decided to keep the truth from me?",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. I told you that I knew it was wrong. I was just so afraid of losing you, I wasn't thinking straight.",
        "Holden: Because of Damian.",
        "Molly: Mnh-mnh. It's all my own fault.",
        "Holden: You should have had more faith in me.",
        "Molly: I know. I know I should have. God. If it wasn't Lily --",
        "Holden: No, no. It's not about Lily. It's not even about you and me. Damian, he led my family to believe that I was dead. He convinced us all that Meg was crazy.",
        "Molly: What are you gonna do?",
        "Holden: I don't know what I'm gonna do! But I'll tell you this, there's no way in hell I am gonna let him get away with this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Meg: I came to warn you.",
        "Damian: How did you get out of Deerbrook?",
        "Molly: Yeah. Your friend Sharkey isn't as smart as you thought.",
        "Damian: I'm gonna call him right now.",
        "Meg: Go ahead. Make all the calls you want. It doesn't matter, because pretty soon, Lily's gonna find out the truth about you.",
        "Damian: They're never gonna believe you. They all know you're crazy!",
        "Meg: But I'm not, and we both know it. You know, Molly and Holden are coming after you, Damian. They're gonna figure it out, and soon you're gonna lose everything. I almost feel sorry for you.",
        "Damian: I don't need your pity.",
        "Meg: Well, you're gonna need someone to love you once you lose Lily.",
        "Damian: Keep dreaming.",
        "Meg: I have been dreaming, about you, about us. You know, I don't know why, but even after everything you've done to me, I still love you, and I would still take you back.",
        "Damian: I don't believe this. You really are insane.",
        "Meg: We had a good thing going, Damian. I know you remember. And we can have it again. At least you won't end up with nothing.",
        "Damian: You would take me back, even after all the horrible things I've done to you?",
        "Meg: I still think we have a future together.",
        "Damian: I believe that, too.",
        "Meg: You do?",
        "Damian: I don't have one with Lily. I never did. My life with her was all based on lies. I see that now.",
        "Meg: Do you mean that?",
        "Damian: You want to know what the biggest lie of all was?",
        "Meg: Hmm?",
        "Damian: That I stopped loving you.",
        "Meg: That's all I wanted to hear. [Grunts] Let go! Let go!",
        "Damian: What the hell is this?",
        "Meg: It's what you deserve!",
        "Damian: You came back here to kill me? You really are insane!",
        "Meg: I hate you, and Lily's gonna find out everything! Your life is over! [Grunting]",
        "Damian: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Meg: I hate you! Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off of me! Aah! [Coughing]",
        "Damian: You understand me? You're not gonna ruin everything for me!",
        "[Meg choking, gasping]",
        "Damian: Meg? Oh, God! Meg? Meg, don't play with me. Meg, come on. Open your eyes. Meg, wake up! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What have I done? What have I done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Oh, wow. What is this for?",
        "Alison: Because I love you.",
        "Casey: Okay. Wow. What happened to waiting until the wedding?",
        "Alison: Well, we're engaged. I mean, we're living together. Wouldn't you call that practically being married already?",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm. Well, yeah. Mm-hmm.",
        "[Creak]",
        "Alison: What was that?",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Alison: That noise.",
        "Casey: I didn't hear anything.",
        "Alison: No, no. It was outside the window.",
        "Casey: It was probably just the wind.",
        "Alison: It wasn't the wind! It was definitely something out there!",
        "Casey: Again, Alison, there's nothing out there.",
        "Alison: Will you just please check?",
        "Casey: Ugh, fine. Nope. There's nothing out there.",
        "Alison: Open the window.",
        "Casey: It's freezing outside!",
        "Alison: Well, you'll be able to see better. Please.",
        "Casey: Eh, fine. Oh. Yep. I don't see anything. No -- no killer squirrels. No spy raccoons. See? Now all you got to do is warm me up. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm- hmm.",
        "Alison: I can't do this.",
        "Casey: Wait, what happened?",
        "Alison: Your parents are downstairs.",
        "Casey: They were downstairs two minutes ago.",
        "Alison: Well, we -- we should wait. I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: It's fine. It's fine. Listen, you just -- you're still gonna warm me up, though, right? Just hold me?",
        "Alison: Oh, this is nice.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: Excellent scotch, Paul. My compliments. You're back.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Where's Alison?",
        "Mick: She left. I wasn't sure what to do.",
        "Paul: Well, you should stay.",
        "Mick: Stay, as in --",
        "Paul: As in we want you to live with us.",
        "Mick: You do?",
        "Emily: We do?",
        "Paul: Well, you do, so, I guess that means we do.",
        "Emily: Really?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Come on. Look how happy you are.",
        "Emily: I love you.",
        "Paul: I'd love for you to stay that way.",
        "Emily: I love you so much. Thank you.",
        "Paul: Stay away from the scotch, though.",
        "Mick: Yeah. I wouldn't touch it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: What about us?",
        "Holden: What about us?",
        "Molly: What can I do to make this up to you?",
        "Holden: You know, I can't even think about that right now. If Damian knows that you're on to him, he could be desperate, and he might just take it out on Lily.",
        "Molly: Why would he do that? She's the --",
        "Holden: You have no idea what he is capable of!",
        "Molly: Why would he hurt Lily?",
        "Holden: Look, I'm not gonna stand here and argue with you, okay? Lily has no idea what's going on. I need to find her, and I need to warn her.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Molly: Of course you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Meg? Meg, I'm sorry. You shouldn't have pushed me like that, though! Meg, come on. Open your eyes. Please. Please, wake up.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Carly: Liberty is here with me. I think you and Janet should get over here right away.",
        "Damian: I had no choice.",
        "Lily: You had no choice? You killed her!",
        "Molly: You see, I felt so guilty that I finally caved in and told Holden everything."
