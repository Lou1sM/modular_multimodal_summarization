        "Rosanna accepted Craig's ring. Craig apologized for lying on Carly's behalf. Lucy gave Rosanna and Craig their blessing and said that Rosanna is now a part of their family. Lucy and Aaron had a date at Java. While Alison stood by listening to their happy conversation, she came up a with lie about work she was doing on a car and that she desperately needed Aaron's help. Lucy suggested that he leave to help their friend. Jack confronted Carly and Mike about the night they slept together. Jack was calm, at first, but became understandably furious with the pair. Jack told Mike to get out, then, Carly. Carly stood her ground and told Jack that they were going to work it out. Jack compared her to Julia by making him think that baby was his. He figured out that she was having morning sickness, instead of the flu when she was actually pregnant back in November. As Jack left the house, he placed his wedding ring on the table. Lien came to the hostpital to tell Marshall that his daughter is dead. Jess and Marshall were already on their way to D.C. ."

        "Ben: Were the nurses able to figure out how long Travers has been gone?",
        "Bob: At least an hour, probably more. He said he wanted to go to D.C. I had hoped that we'd persuaded him not to.",
        "Ben: He wasn't strong enough to leave on his own. Was Jessica here? Did she take --",
        "Bob: Instead of worrying about why or who he's traveling with, why don't we concentrate on the fact that we have a post neurosurgery patient who has left this hospital against medical instructions and could be jeopardizing his life?",
        "Ben: Well, look, I'm gonna do my charts, get Ramirez to cover me, and then I'm going to Washington.",
        "Margo: Going to Washington? You making this trip because you're a neurosurgeon who's dedicated to saving his patient's life, or maybe because you think Jessica's with Marshall and you're gonna drag her back to where you think she belongs?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: How in the world did you get released from the hospital?",
        "Marshall: I walked out the front door.",
        "Jessica: Because, of course, you know better than the doctors do. Marshall, you just had brain surgery. This is insane!",
        "Marshall: I'm not gonna let my daughter come all the way from Brazil and then be met by a bunch of strangers.",
        "Jessica: You are just as much of a stranger to her as anybody else.",
        "Marshall: That's Zara's mother's doing, not mine.",
        "Jessica: Fine. Fine, but if you think I'm gonna participate in this, if you think I'm gonna sit here and watch you kill yourself --",
        "Marshall: You offered your help once. You insisted.",
        "Jessica: Well, that was before I knew I was gonna have an intractable invalid in tow.",
        "Marshall: Jessica, I've got a 15-year-old little girl who's lost her mother, who's never known her father. For half her life, she's been without a home. I want to give her that. I'm not a man who's gotten very much practice as a friend. But I'm asking now -- stay. Help me get this right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Although I do enjoy the fact that I can bring a man to his knees, I much prefer you standing.",
        "Craig: Well, this is still how men who are hopelessly smitten declare their undying love, isn't it?",
        "Rosanna: Get up. You look ridiculous.",
        "Craig: What, you want me on my head? Through burning rings of fire? I searched and I found this most exquisite of rings to give to this most exquisite of women as a symbol of my adoration, of our unity forever.",
        "Rosanna: Mm. No, thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi, honey. Mike was just wishing us bon voyage.",
        "Mike: Yeah, you guys have a good trip. Give us a call when you get there.",
        "Jack: Parker's already at Hal's?",
        "Carly: All systems are go. We can leave as soon as we close up shop.",
        "Mike: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and get out of here. I don't want you guys to miss your honeymoon for the second time.",
        "Jack: Yeah. We have a lot of catching up to do, don't we?",
        "Carly: We sure do.",
        "Jack: I've been missing out on a lot lately, haven't I? Missed the honeymoon, missed my bachelor party. Oh, by the way, Mike, how'd that go? Without the bachelor and everything?",
        "Mike: I really couldn't tell you. I missed it myself. I mean, your buddies took care of it for you, didn't they?",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, that's right. That's the night that you and Molly had that big blowout, right?",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack, would you stop? Why bring all that up now? It -- it was a horrible night for all of us?",
        "Jack: What'd you end up doing, Mike?",
        "Carly: I -- I'm sure that Mike would love to give you his complete itinerary, but not when we're trying to catch a plane, okay? We can all -- we can all compare notes when we get back from Cancun.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know I'll never forget what I was doing that night, Mike. What'd you do?",
        "Mike: I don't know. I got pretty drunk.",
        "Jack: Where? With whom? And then what?",
        "Mike: That's the thing about drinking as much as I did. You know, it's kind of tough to remember.",
        "Jack: Oh, I think you remember just fine, 'cause it sure would be a strange thing to forget.",
        "Mike: What's that?",
        "Jack: That you slept with Carly the night before I married her.",
        "Mike: I know what you're",
        "Jack: No, no, good buddy, I don't think you do.",
        "Carly: It was one night, Jack. One night. You'd called off the wedding. You were walking out of my life.",
        "Jack: And you sleep with the first man who comes along?",
        "Mike: Don't blame her. I should --",
        "Jack: You don't get to talk right now! Get out of my house.",
        "Carly: I'll be all right. Go.",
        "Jack: I've got one question for you, Carly. And I want the truth this time, if you're capable. That baby you're carrying -- is it mine?",
        "Carly: Of course this baby is yours.",
        "Jack: You're sure about that?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Jack: You're sure because it's the truth or you're sure because you want it to be the truth? Answer me, Carly.",
        "Carly: I don't know. But there's no reason that this baby can't be yours, Jack. It probably is. It's just that the timing is confused.",
        "Jack: How long have you known?",
        "Carly: Thanksgiving.",
        "Jack: So the dizziness, the nausea, the exhaustion -- that was morning sickness, wasn't it? You told me you had the flu.",
        "Carly: I thought I did. At first. And then when I realized I was pregnant, Jack, I didn't know what to do. I even thought about not going through with it, but I knew deep inside, Jack. I know this is your baby. I can feel it.",
        "Jack: Then why did you wait weeks to say anything to me, Carly? Admit it -- you weren't sure at all. You were scared to death that you were carrying another man's child, so you decided you could fix everything by passing it off as mine!",
        "Carly: I am so sorry.",
        "Jack: I want you gone! You pack your things. I need you out of here tonight!",
        "Carly: This is my home. I'm your wife!",
        "Jack: Yeah, another thing that never should have happened! Along with that thing you're pregnant with. I'll get it annulled.",
        "Carly: You are the one who walked out on me! You said it was over. God help me, Jack, I believed you. I believed my whole life was over. No wonder I didn't care what happened to me. No wonder I didn't care what I did. How was I supposed to know you were gonna change your mind?",
        "Jack: You couldn't wait 24 hours to find out?!",
        "Carly: You don't exactly do flip-flops, Jack. So, no, I didn't spend a lot of time wondering if you were gonna change your mind. I just reached for the champagne, and I turned to the first pair of arms that reached for me.",
        "Jack: Well, you should have told me, Carly.",
        "Carly: Look in your eyes and break your heart? I could never be that brave. All I wanted was you. And there you were. My miracle. You came back to me, and I swore that I would never let you go away again. You're all I've ever wanted, Jack. I would have done anything to keep us together.",
        "Jack: Including telling a lifetime of lies?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Marshall, let me call an ambulance to take you back to the hospital.",
        "Marshall: You do that, and I'll be on the next flight to D.C., Or the flight after that or the one after that. Jessica, you can't stop me, so you might as well bring me up to speed.",
        "Jessica: Your presence is not required. As I told you, Tom Hughes has a daughter, Lien Hughes, who's an attorney in D.C., And she's contacted all the appropriate officials. Now, it could be weeks before Zara is allowed to enter the United States.",
        "Marshall: Or -- or it could be days. True?",
        "Jessica: Months is more likely.",
        "Marshall: Whatever happens, I need to be there. I want to be there, and I need to be there. Jessica, I'll do anything for her, even if it kills me. You'd do the same for Bonnie.",
        "Jessica: Well, you're not gonna be of much use to anybody if you're dead, so I guess I'll be calling Bob Hughes when we get to the hotel, so he can tell me how to keep his hard-headed patient among the living.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You know, I came here today to ask Marshall to let Jessica go, to release her from her commitment to try and track down his child. Guess he took my message to heart.",
        "Ben: Good. You didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Margo: It's not my job to negotiate Jessica's life behind her back. She's trying to find a man's child and bring her back from Brazil, nothing more. You and I both should have given her the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Ben: What's that mean?",
        "Margo: You know, Ben -- you've spent so much time in your life trying to write her off, to prove to yourself that she's unworthy of your love.",
        "Ben: I came here today to tell Jessica that I forgive her and I want her back in my life.",
        "Margo: And isn't that why you're going to Washington, D.C., Or are you going because you think you might find Jessica in a clinch with Marshall and you can prove that you were right to kick her to the curb?",
        "Ben: I love Jessica, okay, Margo? But it's kind of hard to forget what happened when she keeps giving me new reasons to doubt her.",
        "Margo: Yeah. Doubt's the easiest thing in the world. Love very rarely is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: So how much time do we have till your physical therapist picks you up?",
        "Lucy: Well, she said since it's my first time out, an hour, give or take.",
        "Aaron: Great. Great. I don't have to take grandma's truck back to the farm for a couple hours, so we can just hang out. You know, being without wheels is driving me crazy, so -- you want to help me find a ride?",
        "Aaron: Lucy, you're staring.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry. I mean, I'm -- thanks.",
        "Aaron: Thank you for what?",
        "Lucy: Thanks for letting me bring over the drinks.",
        "[Aaron laughs]",
        "Aaron: You're thanking me for letting you wait on me?",
        "Lucy: No, you said, \"Luce, grab the drinks. I have to call my grandmother,\" like it was a perfectly normal thing to do. No one's normal around me anymore. No one but you.",
        "Aaron: You want normal? Okay, why don't you pay the bill, clean the table, rotate the tires, and grandma's trunk is --",
        "Lucy: In your dreams.",
        "Aaron: Ow, relax. Somebody's getting some muskells here.",
        "Lucy: Things are really starting to feel normal.",
        "Aaron: Well, if you're done using me as your personal punching bag, do you think you can help look for some wheels here or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You thought that you could just put a couple of thousand dollars on my finger and I would just forget.",
        "Craig: Forget that I didn't sleep with your sister? Yes. Forget that. And remember that I love you and only you. And by that way, that ring is worth a lot more than $1,000, but if you want the ring, that's fine. We can live together in delicious sin.",
        "Rosanna: You only asked me to live with you because Lucy pressed it. You know, I can find a place on my own.",
        "Craig: I want you with me.",
        "Rosanna: That's very nice of you to say that.",
        "Craig: No, it's not nice. I'm not nice. I'm never nice. You think I want to marry you just for you? You don't know much about ol' Craig Montgomery, but luckily, I am just the guy to teach you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I know more than I wanted to.",
        "Craig: I want you to be my wife.",
        "Rosanna: Why?",
        "Craig: Because you're rich, gorgeous, incredible in bed. Did I say \"you\"? I meant \"me.\" I am rich, gorgeous, incredible in bed, and you're lucky to find me. Luckily for you, wonder of wonders, you're in love with me. So just take the ring, will you? 'Cause I am not letting you get away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, guys. Aaron, I've been looking everywhere for you. Major emergency.",
        "Aaron: What's wrong?",
        "Alison: Well, Burt made me do an oil change totally solo, and I'm not sure if I did it right or if I drained the brake fluid or something. Could you check it out?",
        "Aaron: Well, actually, Lucy and I --",
        "Alison: If it's the brake fluid, people could die. And I would lose all of the credits I'm getting for this so-called \"internship.\" Please. I mean, Lucy understands. You can spare him for a few minutes, can't you?",
        "Aaron: Alison, we only have a few minutes.",
        "Alison: I wouldn't ask, but it's a total emergency, and it's a matter of life and death -- mine. Please, please, please, please, please?",
        "Lucy: It's fine. Just go help her out. I'll call Gloria and have her pick me up.",
        "Aaron: When am I gonna see you again?",
        "Lucy: Soon.",
        "Aaron: Not soon enough.",
        "Lucy: Surprise me.",
        "Aaron: All right. Count on it. Ali, ready to roll?",
        "Lucy: You go. I'll keep Lucy company.",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You want me to get greasy and dirty while you throw back chai lattes?",
        "Alison: You're the one making the big bucks, teach. Thanks, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Lucy? Soon?",
        "Alison: Looks like you two are getting along great.",
        "Lucy: He's amazing.",
        "Alison: Well, it sounds like the girl's in love.",
        "Lucy: He looks at me like he's known me forever. Like he knows everything about me.",
        "Alison: Yes, that's his \"you're the only girl in the world\" look. Works every time.",
        "Lucy: But it seems like he means it.",
        "Alison: I didn't say he didn't.",
        "Lucy: Alison -- I'm starting to think maybe he really does love me. Is that crazy? There must me something wrong with me",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Let's say we do marry. What about Carly?",
        "Craig: Carly gave me $1 million to save my daughter's life. And when Bryant died, she was the only one to stand by me. So when she came to me in a bind to help me cover her little indiscretion with Mike Kasnoff --",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I know. It was up to you to save her.",
        "Craig: It wasn't just saving her. It was repaying a debt.",
        "Rosanna: What about next time?",
        "Craig: There is not gonna be a \"next time.\" Because I love you and only you. And even though you've heard from scores of people that Craig Montgomery is lousy marriage material, you still want me, even though you know of my appetites, my history with women, my lust for riches. You also know my rapier wit, the feel of my skin, my lips. Just keep the ring and share my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Molly, you home?",
        "Molly: I thought you were never gonna get here.",
        "Mike: Look --",
        "Molly: No, no, no, no, no, no, me first. There's something that I have to tell you. I spoke to Lucinda today, and I asked her if she'd be willing to sell this place to us.",
        "Mike: You did that?",
        "Molly: No, I know. Can you believe it? 'Cause I think it's perfect, because we're so happy at this cottage, you know? And because I am so head-over-heels, hopelessly, pathetically in love with you. So I'm thinking, why not, right? I mean, why not claim this plot of land in the name of Molly and Mike? In the name of true love? What do you think?",
        "Mike: Oh, man, I think that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.",
        "Molly: Yeah? That's not all.",
        "Mike: Your wedding ring's gone.",
        "Molly: Yeah. I thought it was about time, don't you?",
        "Mike: Molly --",
        "Molly: No, I spoke to Jake. I'm good with this. I am. I told him that, when I lost him, there was a time when I didn't think I had any reason to live, and then you came into my life, Mike --",
        "Mike: Molly --",
        "Molly: -- And you changed my life. No, no, no, no, I'm not finished. You have given me so much. And I love you so much. And I want to give you something. Me. All of me. My whole heart and my whole soul.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. Now it's your turn. What did you want to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: That's all this has been, Carly. One big lie after another. You think I'd settle for a lifetime of that? With anyone? No.",
        "Carly: Please. Please. Jack, you know how much I love you.",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, yeah. You love me, huh? That's why it took you all of, what, an hour? Two? To rip your clothes off for somebody else? If that's love, honey, you need a dictionary!",
        "Carly: How could you even question --",
        "Jack: Well, how can I not? You know how I feel, Carly, because I show it. Everything I do is for you. There is not a part of my life where you're not the most important thing in it! I tell you my dreams, my fears, and in return, you take your dreams to Craig, your fears to Mike. All you bring back home is lies.",
        "Carly: I'm telling you the truth now.",
        "Jack: Well, you're telling me the truth now because you don't have a choice. Who else knows the truth, Carly? Who knew it before me, hmm? Did Craig know?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Oh. What about Hal? Huh? Hal, Rosanna, Emily?",
        "Carly: Yeah, they know, but --",
        "Jack: I have never lied to you, Carly, not once. And the way you do it without batting an eye, I'll never understand it. I'll never -- you know, I don't want to understand it. It's disgusting. I want you gone. I want you out of my life.",
        "Carly: I thought there was no \"your life\" anymore. Or \"my life.\" I thought it was \"our life,\" Jack. We're married.",
        "Jack: You call this a marriage?",
        "Carly: Those vows still mean something, Jack. They mean we stay. No matter how scared or angry or hurt we get, we work it out, Jack, together. And you are supposed to be there with your arms open, Jack, ready to catch me when I fall! You said we're magic, Jack! You said that you didn't want to be a part of a world that didn't have me in it, so don't you dare walk out that door. Please. You said you'd never leave me, Jack. You promised me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Lousy marriage material you may be. But if I decide to throw in my lot with yours, I will expect your complete faithfulness. After I put this ring on my finger, nothing will make me stray from you. But what's to keep you from straying from me?",
        "Craig: I would never want to hurt you.",
        "Rosanna: And I promise to remove certain vital body parts if you do.",
        "Craig: Well, now, see, there's a deterrent. See, I can't live without you.",
        "Rosanna: Why?",
        "Craig: Because you understand me, fascinate me. You make me a better man. And I love you, and I will spend the rest of my days proving how much if you become my wife.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Craig: It's a perfect fit.",
        "Rosanna: You're stuck with me now.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but you sure had to make me work for this, didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: If Aaron keeps saying he loves you, I guess you'd be crazy to fight it.",
        "Lucy: Well, they say you can't trust what boys tell you, but Aaron's never given me a reason to doubt him. I mean, the only other girl he talks about is you.",
        "Alison: He does? What does he say?",
        "Lucy: Well, how you're such a great friend, and how you'd come to the rescue a bunch of times.",
        "Alison: Well, like -- like when?",
        "Lucy: Well, he didn't tell me any details or anything. I guess it's mostly stuff that happened on the road. I don't know. It kind of made me jealous.",
        "Alison: Jealous? Why?",
        "Lucy: Because Aaron likes you, and you know all the reasons why. And you remember things you've done together, and you have private jokes, and you can share stories from your past. There's nothing that you could do that would ruin that relationship.",
        "Alison: Yeah. I guess you're right.",
        "Lucy: But with Aaron and me -- he likes me and probably loves me, but I have no idea why. You know, if he stops while I'm still trying to remember what's in my data bank, you know, maybe I should just stay friends with him and have nothing change. I don't know. Help.",
        "Alison: What are you doing back so soon?",
        "Aaron: I decided to call the garage. Hector checked your oil change. He said, \"ya done good.\" So congrats. You're a pro.",
        "Alison: Oh, thanks.",
        "Aaron: So since we have -- we have some extra time. What do you think you call Gloria and ask if I can take you home?",
        "Lucy: I'd like that.",
        "Aaron: See you later, Alison.",
        "Lucy: Bye.",
        "Alison: Have fun. Lucy gets jealous of me? I can work with that.",

        "Lien: Mm-mm, that's not what I heard. My dad mentioned that you and Jessica Griffin were seeing each other. Congratulations.",

        "Lien: It's all -- it's all business.",
        "Ben: Anything interesting?",
        "Lien: Well, I actually did the follow-up work on Jessica's request to get information on Marshall Travers' daughter.",
        "Ben: Mm. So what, you've been working with the Brazilian Consulate?",
        "Lien: Yeah, I actually came here to speak to Mr. Travers about it, but the nurses said that he left.",
        "Ben: Yeah, yeah, he's gone AMA.",
        "Lien: \"Against medical advice\"? Why?",
        "Ben: Well, I think he went to Washington with Jessica.",

        "Jack: You stood before the judge, before our family and friends, swearing that I'd be your only lover, your best friend, and the whole time, you were already pregnant. You came to the altar with Mike's baby! Oh, my God!",
        "Carly: I didn't know.",
        "Jack: Oh, but you did know you spent the whole night before making love to him on your office floor!",
        "Carly: I thought that I'd lost you. I thought I lost everything.",
        "Jack: You know what I lost, Carly? My future. The home and family that I wanted my entire life. Parker. Parker was a part of that. Parker's a part of me, Carly, and now --",
        "Carly: No, please don't --",
        "Jack: -- Knowing this house -- is filled with both of you. Your sketches. Parker's toys. The scent of your perfume. The place where we sat, making plans for our future. Where I sat reading Parker bedtime stories at night, where I sat making plans with Mike! With Mike! To redo the nursery for our baby! [Toys clattering] we were finally gonna have it all, Carly. We were finally gonna have it all, the life we always wanted. Kids, the grand-kids, together forever!",
        "Carly: It doesn't have to change, Jack. We can fix it.",
        "Jack: Oh, how, Carly? How the hell are you gonna fix this?",
        "Carly: Just forgive me. Just hold me. Just forgive me.",
        "Jack: Hold you? I can barely stand to look at you. How the hell am I gonna hold you?",
        "Carly: We don't know that this is Mike's baby, Jack. There is just as much of a chance that it could be yours. That it could be your baby.",
        "Jack: A chance. Oh, that makes all the difference in the world.",
        "Carly: It does make a difference. How many times have we made love in the last four months?",
        "Jack: How many times did we use protection, Carly? Every single time!",
        "Carly: Those things aren't 100% effective 100% of the time!",
        "Jack: I want you gone.",
        "Carly: Fine. You want me gone. Fine. But what about your baby? You gonna abandon your baby, too?",

        "Mike: Something like that, yeah.",
        "Molly: What? You've been going through this all by yourself? Why didn't you -- well, at least I know now, because now that I know, we can handle this together. We will stop Henry in his tracks.",
        "Mike: He's not blackmailing me. He was blackmailing Carly.",
        "Molly: Why? Carly?",
        "Mike: Yeah. I gave her the $50,000 to pay Henry off.",
        "Molly: What? Why would she go to you for $50,000 and put you in debt to Lucinda for $50,000? Why wouldn't she come to me, her cousin? She knows I love her. I would give her the shirt off my -- back. Why is Henry blackmailing Carly, Mike?",
        "Mike: He saw her at Monte Carlo the night before the wedding. And he knew that she wasn't with Craig, all right? He knew that she was with me. Molly -- I stayed at Carly's office the night --",
        "Molly: No. No, you didn't.",
        "Mike: Look --",

        "Molly: You and Carly? You -- my best friend in the world, Mike? You went and you had sex with Carly while I was busy trying to talk the groom into going through with the wedding? You were having sex with my best friend?",

        "Molly: No, Mike --",
        "Mike: I can't give myself a reason.",
        "Molly: There's always a reason. What, you just -- you had to go take a trip down memory lane? Carly was single for, what, an hour and a half, maybe two hours, and you were, too, and you went there, and you had to go there for old time's sake? What?",
        "Mike: No.",
        "Molly: Why?",
        "Mike: No, Molly --",
        "Molly: No. I love you. And you love me. And you wouldn't. I mean, I know you, and I know you wouldn't do that. God, tell me it's not true. A lie. Tell me it's lie. Please, please say it's a lie. Please.",

        "Lucy: Why? I mean, I think, deep down, every woman wants an amazing dress, a church full of flowers, candles, bridesmaids, string quartet --",
        "Craig: Whoa, whoa, whoa. This wedding is already costing me millions!",
        "Rosanna: I just want it to be you and your father and -- maybe Emma and Parker.",
        "Lucy: Wait. You're not keeping this small and intimate because of -- me, are you? Because you think there'll be too many people staring at me in this wheelchair?",
        "Craig: Hey. There's no reason to make this a big deal.",
        "Lucy: But it is a big deal, dad. I mean, this may not be your first marriage, but what about Rosanna? I mean, doesn't she deserve the wedding of her dreams?",
        "Rosanna: Well, we just want you to be comfortable.",
        "Lucy: Whether I walk or roll down the aisle in my bridesmaid's gown, they'll gawk. I mean, it's a wedding. That's what people do. I'll be fine. Rosanna, ignore him. And ignore me. Just have the wedding you want, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Thank you, Lucy.",

        "Craig: Yes, it was troubling. Ignore me. Ignore that, will ya?",

        "Molly: Sorry why? Huh? Because you got caught? Because it was Carly? Because you broke my heart? Why, Mike? Which part of it is -- all of it? Is there more? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. The baby. Carly's baby. Is it gonna be yours, Mike? Unbelievable! Unbelievable, buddy! That's why you've been talking to Rosanna all this time, because you've been trying to keep her mouth shut from telling me the truth. And these meetings and these things with Carly -- it's so unbelievable.",
        "Mike: Molly, wait --",
        "Molly: Oh, my God. [Molly sobbing] this fantasy that I concocted that Jake sent you to me -- [Molly laughing] that's a laugh. He was probably warning me to stay the hell away from you.",

        "Molly: How many times, Mike?",
        "Mike: Once.",
        "Molly: Uh-huh. And I'm supposed to believe that why? Because you're telling the truth now? Well, it just looks an awful lot like Mike telling another lie.",
        "Mike: I promise you that I'm telling the truth. It happened one time. It happened that night that you told me about the Burn unit.",
        "Molly: Right. The Burn unit. You were so disappointed with me. Because I kept something from you. I was so in love with you that I lied about spending boatloads of money to keep you in my life. And you were so in love with me that you went and had sex with my best friend, my cousin.",
        "Mike: Molly, no, no, wait. Wait! Don't drive like this. Here, I'll leave. I will leave.",

        "Carly: There's a difference. The difference is I'm your wife, and I love you.",
        "Jack: You don't lie to people you love! You don't try to pass off someone else's kid as your husband's!",
        "Carly: That's not what I'm doing. I said that there was a possibility.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, you and I staying married, that's an impossibility. No, Carly. I told you. If you ever cheat on me, it's over. If you ever do anything like this, you pack your bags and never look back. And when you leave this house for the last time, take that with you, too.",

When you had absolutely no place to go, I took you in. Because I loved you. Oh, God. You ran roughshod over more than half the people in this town. You stole from them. You lied to them. You cheated them. You ruined them. And sometimes -- yeah, sometimes I was right there, lending a helping hand. Because I figured, hey, they must've deserved it. Little did I know it was just a matter of time before you worked me over, too. Did you think I deserved it, Carly?! Or did you just not give a damn?"
