        "Barbara: My little boy was hauled off to an \"institution\" today. I've been given no information about him. I wasn't even allowed to say good-bye.",
        "Jessica: I'm sure that was very upsetting.",
        "Barbara: Not only that, it was insulting. Will's fate is in the hands of some court-appointed shrink who probably got his degree at some university who advertises on the sides of buses --",
        "Jessica: Considering the charges against Will, I think we got a pretty good deal.",
        "Barbara: Yes, you're right. We did. It's just that -- Jess, I wanna see him. I wanna hold him. I want him to know that I'm here, that I love him --",
        "Jessica: Well, there is the matter of the restraining order against you, and the terms of your probation clearly state --",
        "Barbara: Yes, and that's why I was hoping that maybe you'd talk to Hal about lifting the restraining order.",
        "Jessica: No, uh-uh. That is between you and Hal. I am not getting in the middle of it.",
        "Barbara: Your daughter's in jail. What if you weren't allowed to see her? Wouldn't you jump through hoops so you could?",
        "Jessica: Barbara, it would be a waste of time for me and embarrassing for you. If I go to Hal, I know what he's going to say. \"Give me one good reason why I should let Barbara see my son.\"",
        "Barbara: Because I'm his mother!",
        "Jessica: Sorry. Not a good enough argument. You got anything else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I begged her to go get help years ago. If she'd done it then, we wouldn't be in this position right now.",
        "Jennifer: Dad, we can't look back on that. What we have to do is move on -- together.",
        "Hal: Well, if Barbara wants to become part of this family again, she's got to do more than be a good mother to Will. She's got to be a good mother to all of you. Especially Paul.",
        "Jennifer: She wants that, too, Dad.",
        "Hal: No more feuds. No more power plays. If things settle down and Barbara becomes a member of this family again, it'll be because she earned it.",
        "Jennifer: She's learned her lesson, Dad. I truly believe that.",
        "Hal: Yeah? Well, I'll believe it when I see it.",
        "Jennifer: Well, now all we have to do is make sure that Paul buries the hatchet with Mom, and --",
        "Paul: Okay! Tell me I'm still drunk. Please, tell me that I'm still drunk and you did not just say that! There is no way that little family reunion is ever going to happen!",

        "Minister: You're doing a wonderful job.",
        "Simon: Hey, listen, it's nothing. Thanks for letting me crash here again. I appreciate it.",
        "Minister: I hope you weren't too cold.",
        "Son: I had some pretty good memories of this place to keep me warm.",
        "Simon: This is where I married the love of my life.",

        "Katie: Hey. Ah, come on in.",
        "Mike: Did you sleep at all last night?",
        "Katie: Not a wink. How about you?",
        "Mike: Nothing. But I think I got some good news for both of us.",
        "Katie: Oh, really?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I got a call last night. Remember I told you about that job down in Costa Rica?",
        "Katie: Uh-huh.",
        "Mike: Well, they -- you know, I'm supposed to be there in a few weeks for some meetings, but I was thinking I would go early, you know? We would go early. This'd be really good. All right? Come with me to Costa Rica.",

        "Susan: Good morning. [Alison sighs] How you feeling?",
        "Alison: Sore.",
        "Susan: It'll hurt for awhile.",
        "Alison: Oh, it'll hurt forever. It hurts so much. I lost my baby. My baby's gone. Why, Mom, why?",
        "Susan: I don't know, babe. I don't know.",
        "Alison: Just make my baby come back. I want him. I just want him.",

        "Bob: Chris!",
        "Chris: Dad, I didn't know who else to call.",
        "Bob: What the devil is going on? Where's Alison?",
        "Chris: She's in the examination room. She had a fall, she lost a lot of blood, but we got her stabilized. She's going to be okay.",
        "Bob: Why is my son being kept here like a criminal?",
        "Susan: Because he chased my daughter down and made her miscarry my grandchild. Our grandchild, Bob.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Out. Now.",
        "Mike: Why?",
        "Katie: Because I tell you I need space, and you come in here and ask me to run away with you?",
        "Mike: On a vacation. I'm not saying we need to change our names or anything.",
        "Katie: Good. But as tempting your offer is, and really it is, I'm not gonna leave Simon without figuring things out first.",
        "Mike: God -- Katie, the guy walked out on you. What are you supposed to do? Sit around for the rest of your life and mourn him?",
        "Katie: The past three months -- what we've been through -- I'm never gonna forget that. But it doesn't make my decision any easier. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I am split down the middle. Why are you smiling?",
        "Mike: Well, if you're split down the middle, that means I have a fighting chance, right?",
        "Katie: You have more than that.",
        "Mike: You have my ring on.",
        "Katie: Which doesn't mean that I've made my decision yet. And if you wanna go to Costa Rica --",
        "Mike: No, no, no. I'll stick around. Take my chances in Oakdale.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: What you do from now on Will determine the rest of Will's life. So, I suggest that you proceed very carefully.",
        "Barbara: Well, you seem to have all the answers. What is it you suggest that I do?",
        "Jessica: You have two options, Barbara. One, you can stop fighting this process, get on board with this new shrink, and hope that he reaches Will. Or you can spend the rest of your days seeing Will through six inches of bullet- proof glass on visiting days.",
        "Barbara: I just want him to get well and come home.",
        "Jessica: Good. Prove it. Start by cleaning up this mess you've made and getting your life in order.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Look, I love Will. You both know that. I would do anything for that kid. But I can't pretend to not be nauseous every time I see Barbara. He'll see right through that! I mean, he's having a hard time right now. But the kid's not an idiot.",
        "Hal: See what I mean? I'll grab your stuff for you.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Jennifer: Could you be any more selfish, Paul?",
        "Paul: What -- what did I do?",
        "Jennifer: It's what you didn't do. You weren't there this morning when we sent Will off to that hellish mental institution.",
        "Paul: Oh, man.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, yeah -- how many more times are you going to disappoint the kid, huh? He's still so scared to death that you hate him. And the look on his face this morning -- he was so afraid and so alone.",
        "Paul: I should've been there.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, he needs his whole family, Paul. His whole family.",
        "Paul: No, I'm not making nice with Barbara if that's what you're talking about. No. Not after what she did to Will. She should be behind bars. She -- she spray painted my penthouse, she blames it on Will. She poisoned his young mind -- and you know what happened.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, it's a tragedy. Not a conspiracy. No one planned to murder Rose or brainwash Will. He just -- he wanted to stop the wedding. And it's horrible that Rose died. But what we have to do, for Will's sake, is move on. And the only way to do that is to forgive.",
        "Hal: See you later, Jen. Love you. Your personal effects.",
        "Paul: I could use a razor and a toothbrush. Oh, look, a wallet that used to be overflowing with $100 bills.",
        "Hal: Listen, hey, if you want, I can have one of the guys drop you off.",
        "Paul: No. If I get dropped off in a squad car, all my neighbors will wonder what I got arrested for this time. I can hail a cab, I guess. Hey, maybe I can hitchhike.",
        "Hal: Hail a cab, will you?",
        "Paul: About last night -- listen, I --",
        "Hal: Hey, look, you had a rough night. It happens. Just try not to let it happen again.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I should've been there for Will this morning -- see him get shipped off.",
        "Hal: You'll see him again. I'm glad to see that you're a little bit more conscious.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I'm not clear-headed yet, but I will be.",

        "Aaron: How're you doing?",
        "[Beeping]",
        "Alison: You know what I can't figure out? This time, I wasn't thinking about myself. I was trying to keep from ruining everyone's life. And I just -- I just wanted to start fresh -- just me and the baby. So, you could go back to Lucy, and Chris could go practice medicine and not have to deal with all of this. And everybody could go on with their lives. But now --",
        "Aaron: No, Ali, Ali -- it's not your fault. It's not your fault. You were just trying your best.",
        "Alison: No, my best -- my best wasn't good enough. Not for my baby.",
        "Susan: Alison? You feel up to answering a few questions?",
        "Aaron: I'll -- I'll go wait outside, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: How did all this happen?",
        "Chris: Where do you want me to start?",
        "Bob: How long have you known about the baby?",
        "Chris: A day. Nobody even told me, I found out by accident. I followed Aaron here because I thought he might be on his way to see Alison. Look, Dad, I don't even know how long he's known the truth about the baby's paternity, but --",
        "Bob: The big question is -- why does he think that you're responsible for Alison's fall?",
        "Chris: Misunderstanding. That's all.",

        "Sarah: So this is what Metro looks like. Not bad.",
        "Curtis: Why aren't you in school?",
        "Sarah: It's my lunch period.",
        "Curtis: It's too early for lunch. Try again.",
        "Sarah: Ah -- it's a half day.",
        "Curtis: For us seniors, yeah. Not for you little freshmen.",
        "Sarah: Oh, nice! I've always wanted one of the things.",
        "Curtis: Well, you can't have it, so back off. And why aren't you in school?",
        "Sarah: Mr. King.",
        "Curtis: Algebra, right?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, he hates me. And I didn't to do my homework, so --",
        "Curtis: So, you decided to ditch.",
        "Sarah: Something like that.",
        "Curtis: I get it. When things get too tough for Sarah, Sarah takes off.",
        "Sarah: Forget you! I don't even know why I came here.",
        "Curtis: Neither do I, because if you thought you could hang out here instead of being in school? Then you really are dumb. Hey, hold up. Running away again? That's twice in one day. I hope that's not a record for you. But you can't run away on an empty stomach. So, um -- I'll go into the kitchen, see what I can find, and then you can tell me off. I'll be right back.",

        "Jennifer: Hi. Hi, Mom.",
        "Jessica: Hey, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Am I interrupting anything?",
        "Jessica: Oh, no.",
        "Barbara: I couldn't be happier to see you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jennifer: Well, do you mind if I join you?",
        "Jessica: Excuse me.",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry; I've got to take this. Hello? Speaking. Are you sure about that? Okay, thanks for letting me know. Bye-bye. Um -- I gotta go. Barbara, I'll be in touch. Jennifer, it was lovely to see you.",
        "Jennifer: You, too. Oh, you know what, Jess? I've been thinking of Bonnie a lot lately. Please send her my love.",
        "Jessica: Thank you, sweetheart. I certainly will.",
        "Jennifer: So, why were you meeting with Jess?",
        "Barbara: I was hoping that maybe she would talk to your father about lifting the restraining order.",
        "Jennifer: I was just doing that very thing, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Oh, please tell me you were successful.",
        "Jennifer: Well, he listened, which is something, you know? And he didn't throw me out of the police station. But there are some conditions you'd have to meet before he could even consider meeting you halfway.",
        "Barbara: Of course, anything.",
        "Jennifer: You have to find a way to make peace with Paul.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I want that, too. But Paul blames me for everything that has happened. There is nothing that I can do to make him forgive me. There's no magic words that I can possibly say to make him love me again.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, maybe there are. Two words -- \"I'm sorry.\" Just admit that you were wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Did you do it?",
        "James: Be more specific.",
        "Paul: Did you use Barbara to set up will to kill Rose?",
        "James: No. But it was clever. I mean, whoever did it was really clever. You know, Paul, maybe I can teach you something after all.",
        "Paul: Did you incite Barbara to poison Will's mind?",
        "James: Listen to me, and if I say it, it's a promise. I had nothing to do with the demise of your fianc\u00e9e. Not everybody's out to get you, Paul.",
        "Paul: Name one person who's not out to get me.",
        "James: Me. But your friends, your associates -- they've got you running scared.",
        "Paul: You don't know anything about my life.",
        "James: I know you have no family except a little boy who's accused of murder, an ex-model sister. You have no friends except Rosanna, and Craig can't wait to just stomp all over you. And I may not be around to clean up the mess, Paul.",
        "Paul: That would be a relief.",
        "James: You may miss me.",
        "Paul: I look forward to the day.",
        "James: I can make your life a lot easier.",
        "Paul: What, by disappearing?",
        "James: I can teach you how to put your enemies in their place, and keep them there.",
        "Paul: Come on, let's hear it. Tell me what you got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: May I help you?",
        "Katie: Oh, um -- I don't know, maybe. I came just here to think -- to remember. I was married here, once upon a time. He left me. I didn't think I'd be able to move on, but I did. I fell in love with someone new. I didn't mean to -- I mean, I wasn't looking for it. It's just -- it appeared. Love. And now, my husband's back, and -- oh, I don't know what to feel. So, I just came here to think -- to pray.",
        "Minister: Take as much time as you like.",
        "Katie: Thank you. Oh, now what?",
        "Simon: Since I'm not allowed to take you in my arms -- let's talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Female cop: Alison, I'm very sorry about your loss. I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. Do you remember what happened last night?",
        "Alison: I remember -- [Alison remembering] Going onto the fire ladder -- and then I remember --",
        "Aaron: Alison!",
        "Female cop: That's all you remember?",
        "Alison: Until I woke up, and Chris told me -- you know, about the baby.",
        "Female cop: Okay, let's try this again. Why did you go onto the ladder?",
        "Alison: To get away from Chris.",
        "Female cop: Why did you need to get away from Chris? Did he threaten you?",
        "[Alison remembering]",
        "Chris: If you want me out of your life, then just say the word, and I'm gone. You'll never see me again.",
        "Alison: That's what I want.",
        "Chris: As soon as you prove that the baby isn't mine.",
        "Alison: And how am I supposed to do that? Because I'm not going all the way back to Oakdale just to do some stupid sonogram just to make you happy.",
        "Chris: You know what? You don't have to.' Cause this is a family clinic and we can run the proper tests right here, right now.",
        "Alison: No, he didn't really threaten me.",
        "Female cop: But you felt threatened?",
        "Alison: I was just scared that he would take away my baby. That he would accuse me of being an unfit mother.",
        "Female cop: Why would he do that?",
        "Alison: Because he doesn't care about me. He only cared about the baby.",
        "Female cop: Do you remember Chris following you onto the ladder?",
        "[Alison remembering]",
        "Chris: Ali -- my God. Don't move. Don't move.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Female cop: Was he angry with you when he came outside?",
        "Alison: At first. But then we talked, and he swore he didn't want to take away our baby. But then --",
        "[Alison remembering]",
        "Alison: Don't come any closer! He was trying to trick me.",
        "Female cop: Why would you think he was tricking you?",
        "[Alison remembering]",
        "Chris: Stop, stop! It's going to be okay.",
        "Alison: You were so quick to think that I would just start sleeping around with anybody!",
        "Chris: Alison, I -- I was upset, and I was angry.",
        "Alison: I knew that you wanted to take away my baby, and I'm not gonna let you.",
        "Chris: Alison, I swear. I would never --",
        "Alison: You, and -- stop! I don't know! I don't know anything. I just didn't trust him. I just -- I just wanted to get away!",

        "Aaron: He pushed her, and I saw him do it.",

        "Simon: If you're not going, I'm not going either.",
        "Katie: What about this --",
        "Simon: No, please, Katie. I love you, and I always will. And I'm not gonna leave you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm -- I'm sorry for crying so much. I just can't stop.",
        "Female cop: It's all right. It's all right.",
        "Susan: It's okay. It's perfectly natural.",
        "Alison: All I remember is taking his hand.",
        "Female cop: Do you think that Chris had anything to do with your fall?",
        "Susan: That's probably enough for now.",
        "Female cop: Okay, well, we'll talk again later, after you've had some rest.",
        "Alison: Well, wait. Why are you asking so many questions about Chris?",
        "Susan: She just needs it for her report.",
        "Female cop: Yeah. We'll try again later.",
        "Susan: Ali, you really don't remember anything about what happened? Or are you just trying to protect Chris?",
        "Alison: Protect Chris from what? What did Chris do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: How did everything go with Alison? Like I told you, right? She cleared everything up?",
        "Female cop: You'd recently learned that Alison had been keeping your paternity a secret from you. That must've made you pretty angry.",
        "Bob: Did Alison clear my son or not? Or are you interrogating him?",
        "Female cop: Look, I'm just trying to get some questions answered for my report.",
        "Chris: Look, I've been here all night answering the same damn questions, and I'm sick of it. Now, tell me what's going on!",
        "Female cop: That's quite a temper you've got.",
        "Chris: You know what? Well, what did she say?",
        "Bob: Look, the girl fell. Maybe she's confused or mistaken.",
        "Female cop: I'm just trying to get answers.",
        "Aaron: I told you everything you needed to know. You pushed her, and I saw him do it. And it wasn't the first time.",

        "Katie: How did you know I'd be here?",
        "Simon: I didn't.",
        "Katie: Then what are you doing here?",
        "Simon: Well, I didn't have anywhere else to go after you bounced me from our cottage last night. This is the only place I could think of where I would feel close to you. I came here for answers, Katie, just like you.",
        "Katie: You don't know the first thing about me anymore.",
        "Simon: Maybe not. It's fair. But you can't have forgotten this is where we joined our lives together. Where we made promises to each other.",
        "Katie: You broke the promises, Simon. You're the one who lied. You're the one who took off, and took all my money, and left me with nothing. You're the one who dropped off the face of the earth and faked his own death, so don't talk to me about broken promises.",
        "Simon: Okay, you're right. You're right. All right? Maybe I went about things the wrong way. And the lies I had to tell must have been hard to hear, but you have to believe that everything I have done was for your protection.",
        "Katie: Right, so ripping my heart out wasn't enough? You had to rip me off, too?",
        "Simon: No, I -- I couldn't have you following me, and risk your life. So, yeah, I had to let you think the worst of me. And if this is about the money, it's in the trust account in your name.",
        "Katie: All right, well, in Australia, after the explosion, I wanted to die, Simon. I didn't want to live without you.",
        "Simon: Look, I hated having to do that to you. But it was the only way to throw everyone off my trail. You don't think that all I wanted to do was be with you, in our little cottage in the woods? Laughing the way we used to laugh. Holding you in my arms. Planning a family with you. Talking about all the babies we would have. I missed you so much, you will never even know. So I knew I had to find a way to come back to you. So please, tell me that I'm not too late.",

        "James: Paul, do you know what people respect about me the most, and fear?",
        "Paul: Your maniacal ego? The fact that you're evil? The fact that you have no moral fiber at all?",
        "James: That's a bit unkind. No. It's power. Without power, a man is a waste of time and space. But with it, he can control his world.",
        "Paul: Power?",
        "James: Barbara has it. So does Dustin Donovan, Craig Montgomery, even little Lily. They get what they want, they use their power and they get exactly what they want. And you do nothing.",

        "James: It has nothing to do with being weak or strong. The point is to get what you want. And you, son, have lost everything. You've lost everything that has any meaning in your life.",

        "Nancy: All families change, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Well, sure they do, but that doesn't mean that we have to grow apart.
