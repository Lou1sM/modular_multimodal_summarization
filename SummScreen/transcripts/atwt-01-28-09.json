        "Paul calls Meg to ask to see Eliza; Meg balks at it, but then tells Paul that she will let him know. Dusty tells Meg that he will go in her place so she doesn't have to deal with Paul in order for him to have a relationship with his daughter. Dusty shows up at Paul's with Eliza and Paul doesn't react well and is even more angry when he finds out that Meg and he got married. Meanwhile, Josie finds out by accident about Dusty and Meg's marriage and doesn't react well either when Meg admits that Dusty is breaking the news to Paul about them. Josie points out that Meg has come between her and Dusty and he chose her; she is convinced that both Dusty and Paul are obsessed with her. Dusty lays down the ground rules with Paul, which incites him. When Dusty finally hands over Eliza, Paul orders him out of his house. Dusty threatens to call the police until Josie shows up and talks everyone down. Meg learns of Paul's displeasure in her new marriage, as Josie soon learns that Paul is not going to take this lying down; Dusty won't know what hit him when he is done with him, Paul promises. Casey tries to make plans for dinner and dancing with Allison, but she tells him that she is not interested. Casey wants to know what is stopping her. Finally, he figures out it has to do with Emily, as Allison admits that Emily wants them to keep their distance. Casey is furious and tells Allison that he won't stand for that, as he storms off. Luke wants Jade to stay in town when he learns she is down because she doesn't want to be around Derek. They look online for a job for her and they come across Emily's listing. Luke warns her, but Jade is up for it. Jade and Emily speak, but soon Emily is berating Jade for something she didn't do when she answered her phone and she orders her out of her office. Casey shows up loaded for bear at Emily, as they have it out. Jade overhears and Emily notices that Casey and Jade are somewhat close. She tries to entice Jade to take a job with her \u0096 one that keeps Casey away from her sister and with Jade instead. Jade sees she has Emily over a barrel and tells Emily that she will let her know. Luke and Allison talk about her fears about getting into a relationship. He thinks she has nothing to lose if she throws caution to the wind and dates Casey; he thinks he might be the right person for her. Allison is unsure, but Luke takes the same tactic as hers when she and Casey locked Noah and he on the roof. He instructs her to wait while he finds Casey to meet her on the roof. Casey calls Jade to find out about the job interview, which she dodges. He asks her to find Casey and send him to the roof to meet with Allison. Instead, Jade talks to Casey about how good of a guy he is and if Allison doesn't see that then maybe he should cut his losses. She asks him to have coffee with her instead of delivering the message. When Casey gets the coffee, Jade calls Emily and accepts the \u0091job'. Emily asks when she will start. Jade tells her that she already has."

        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Dusty: Hey. Anyone here?",
        "Meg: The coast is clear.",
        "Dusty: Is your mom's upstairs?",
        "Meg: It seems she has gotten over her bout with the flu so she went to a charity meeting.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's nice. I keep thinking what it's like for you, you know, with your family in and out all day.",
        "Meg: Well, this whole time I spent with Paul, I'm kind of used to their disapproval.",
        "Dusty: Oh. I want us to get us a new place as soon as possible.",
        "Meg: What's this?",
        "Dusty: She's a realtor. She's got a couple of places she wants you to see.",
        "Meg: You mean us to see?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, well, I want you to pick out the one you like best.",
        "Meg: Well, you have to like it too.",
        "Dusty: As long as it's got plenty of space for the kids, I'm good with whatever you pick.",
        "Meg: You mean you don't want to make sure that the kitchen appliances are up to your standards?",
        "Dusty: I trust you. It'll be great to get out of the Lakeview. And wherever we go, it won't be forever.",
        "Meg: Just until we convince the court that you can provide a better home for Johnny than Craig can.",
        "Dusty: And we make sure you're safe from Paul.",
        "Meg: We'll take it one step at a time. I'll give her a call.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Paul: Hey, you busy?",
        "Meg: Uh --kind of, yes.",
        "[Dusty whispers]",
        "Dusty: Paul?",
        "Paul: I was hoping you could drop Eliza off for a little bit. I haven't seen her in a couple of days.",
        "Meg: You know, it's not a good time.",
        "Paul: I miss her. I want a couple of hours. You can go do, you know, whatever.",
        "Meg: I'm not sure it's going to work out today.",
        "Paul: It's because of the way I treated you?",
        "Meg: Well, I didn't appreciate it.",
        "Paul: I'm really sorry. It'll never happen again. I promise.",
        "Meg: You expect me to believe you?",
        "Paul: Meg, please. Please. And look, if you're too busy to drive her, I'll come pick her up myself.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? I'll figure it out and I'll call you back.",
        "Paul: Okay, I'll be waiting.",
        "Dusty: What's wrong?",
        "Meg: He wants to see Eliza.",
        "Dusty: What do you think?",
        "Meg: I'm not going to use her against him. It's wrong to keep her from her father.",
        "Dusty: So what's the problem?",
        "Meg: I'm just afraid of what he's going to do when I tell him that we're married.",
        "Dusty: So don't.",
        "Meg: And let him hear about it through the grapevine? I don't think so.",
        "Dusty: Well, it could be dangerous for you tell him yourself.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to see him. If he wants to see Eliza, that's fine. But he has no right to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: We missed you at breakfast.",
        "Luke: So?",
        "Jade: Well, it sounded like a family thing, so I went to get something at Al's.",
        "Luke: Jade, you are family.",
        "Jade: Thanks, but I'm not really feeling it right now.",
        "Luke: Was it because of Derek?",
        "Jade: Well, when your long-lost father wants nothing to do with you, it doesn't really give you that warm family glow.",
        "Luke: Well, you know what? That's his problem, not yours. You've got family right here.",
        "Jade: Thank you. But I just keep thinking, what am I doing here?",
        "Luke: Yeah, so does Spinoza. Metaphysics! Noah gave it to me.",
        "Jade: Oh, what a romantic.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I know, he took the class last semester and he figured that my brain could use a little exercise.",
        "Jade: Well, that was a lot deeper than I was meaning to go.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I know, tell me about it. The last thing I want to think about right now is the meaning of life.",
        "Jade: Me either. Now, all I keep thinking about is how I can't keep sponging off your mom forever.",
        "Luke: Look, you're not sponging. She said it a million times and I and I totally agree with her. You are completely welcome to stay here for as long as you want.",
        "Jade: And do nothing? That's not fair to anyone.",
        "Luke: Well then, go back to school.",
        "Jade: I am so not ready for that.",
        "Luke: Okay, then get a job. It'll give you something to do. Put some cash in your pocket.",
        "Jade: Who's going to hire me?",
        "Luke: At least give it a shot. Gregslist posts tons of local jobs.",
        "Jade: I don't know.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on. Why go somewhere far away, all alone, where you don't know anybody, when you can start your life over right here?",
        "Jade: I love you for that. And I love your mom too. But what kind of life would it be if I keep running into Derek? You know, seeing your father that doesn't want anything to do with you doesn't do much for your self-esteem. Let's face it, Luke. I'd be better off anywhere but here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey. You working?",
        "Casey: No, no. I was looking for you.",
        "Alison: Oh, well you know, I'm really busy right now. I have all these requisitions to fill out, and I have class in about an hour.",
        "Casey: Okay, what about tonight? Are you free?",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Casey: Well, I thought we could do something. We really haven't been hanging out lately.",
        "Alison: You know, I'm really not that into seeing \"My Bloody Valentine in 3d.\"",
        "Casey: That's cool, I already took Danny to see it.",
        "Alison: You took that sweet little kid to a gorefest?",
        "Casey: What? He loved it. He wanted to stay and see it again. So we did, you know? If you change your mind, I'll see it a third time.",
        "Alison: Thanks. But you know, I see enough blood around here, so --",
        "Casey: Great, because I have a better idea.",
        "Alison: What's that?",
        "Casey: Okay, we go to Chicago, have some dinner, you know, go out to a club, listen to some blues.",
        "Alison: Are you asking me out on a date?",
        "Casey: Why get into the whole label thing?",
        "Alison: About this, remember?",
        "Casey: I thought we could just have some fun together. Lately, it's been all kinds of tension.",
        "Alison: Because you won't let up on me.",
        "Casey: I'm just asking you to go out to dinner and listen to some music.",
        "Alison: No, we both know what you're asking, Casey. I don't know why you can't get it through your head that it's not going to happen!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: There you go. Hey, I thought you'd call first. Listen, I really appreciate you coming by I -- what are you doing here?",
        "Dusty: Meg said you wanted to see your daughter. Here she is.",
        "Paul: Meg sent you?",
        "Dusty: What do you think?",
        "Paul: Why isn't she here?",
        "Dusty: She doesn't want to see you. Ever.",
        "Paul: Go put my little girl in the crib and then you can get out.",
        "Dusty: I'm staying right here.",
        "Paul: The hell you are.",
        "Dusty: Meg doesn't want you left alone with Eliza --",
        "Paul: Why isn't Meg here?",
        "Dusty: I just told you.",
        "Paul: I want to hear her say it.",
        "Dusty: She's not going to answer when she sees it's you. Voice mail?",
        "Paul: Okay, look, I don't know what the hell you're trying to pull. You are never going to come between me and Meg --",
        "Dusty: What if I already have? We got married. Meg is my wife.",
        "Paul: You're a funny guy. Really funny, you know? You had me going there for a minute.",
        "Dusty: It's no lie.",
        "Paul: Meg's would never marry you.",
        "Dusty: She did.",
        "Paul: For one thing, she's not divorced from me.",
        "Dusty: Oh, those divorce papers were drawn up, and you know that.",
        "Paul: Nothing was finalized.",
        "Dusty: No, Meg and I did that in Reno, when we tied the knot.",
        "Paul: She can't divorce me if I'm not there.",
        "Dusty: It only takes about ten minutes.",
        "Paul: Ten minutes --",
        "Dusty: Yeah, ten minutes to make it official. You're out of her life now.",
        "Paul: What are you doing? Why are you doing this?",
        "Dusty: They'll be mailing you a copy of the papers from Nevada.",
        "Paul: That doesn't that mean she would be marrying you.",
        "Dusty: It was a simple ceremony. All we cared about was making it legal. And now we're house-hunting.",
        "Paul: I don't know what you did to force Meg to marry you --",
        "Dusty: I didn't have to force her into anything. She knows how much better her life will be now that she finally has a little stability.",
        "Paul: She doesn't love you! This is a scam and you're never going to get away with it!",
        "Dusty: No, this is reality, Paul. Meg's my wife. Get used to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Can you wait a minute?",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Casey: You don't want to be my friend anymore?",
        "Alison: Of course I do. But that's all I want to be.",
        "Casey: Even if something is happening between us?",
        "Alison: It isn't. You may think so, but it's not real unless it's something that we both want.",
        "Casey: And you don't?",
        "Alison: You're finally paying attention.",
        "Casey: I have been this whole time. And when we're together, even if you don't admit it -- there's a definitely a vibe between us. And it's not going to go away just because you tell it to.",
        "Alison: There is no vibe.",
        "Casey: What about the other day, when we were talking about your father? Was there anything there?",
        "Alison: Yeah, friendship.",
        "Casey: No, it was more than that.",
        "Alison: Okay, this is what I'm talking about. Why do you keep pushing this?",
        "Casey: Why can't you just be honest with yourself?",
        "Alison: Stop telling me what I feel!",
        "Casey: I -- okay, listen, I'm not completely clueless on this. I know when something is cooking. I just don't understand why you're acting like nothing's happening.",
        "Alison: I'm not.",
        "Casey: We don't even hang out anymore.",
        "Alison: I will if you just back off.",
        "Casey: Okay, I will back off if you promise to let things just happen.",
        "Alison: Will you just leave it alone?",
        "Casey: Not until you explain it to me.",
        "Alison: I can't.",
        "Casey: Yes, you can. And you owe it to me.",
        "[Alison remembering]",
        "Emily: Ali, if you care about me at all, stay away from Casey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: It's just -- it's too complicated.",
        "Casey: It's just you and me.",
        "Alison: Come on, Case.",
        "Casey: Is it our families? Is that what this is about? The whole Stewart- Hughes, 15-matches-to-the-death crap? I don't --",
        "Alison: It's not crap. It's --it's real.",
        "Casey: And since when did you start caring about that?",
        "Alison: I have to.",
        "Casey: Why? What's the deal with you? I'm a moron! It's Emily, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Oh, there's one. Publisher's assistant.",
        "Jade: Right, right. But there's nothing for a nuclear physicist on here?",
        "Luke: Oh, come on. Look, it says that you don't need any experience.",
        "Jade: Oh, perfect.",
        "Luke: No, no, no, actually that is a no-go.",
        "Jade: Why?",
        "Luke: Because it's at the Intruder. That means you'd be working for Emily Stewart.",
        "Jade: And?",
        "Luke: And -- she tortures her assistants for fun.",
        "Jade: Oh, you know her?",
        "Luke: Yeah, unfortunately. She's Alison's sister. Casey actually used to have that job.",
        "Jade: Oh, what happened?",
        "Luke: Oh, they -- they had this weird thing for each other. They got married.",
        "Jade: That's what you call torture?",
        "Luke: Trust me, okay?",
        "Jade: Oh, whatever, it's not going to happen to me.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Jade: Well, they're not still together, are they?",
        "Luke: Oh, no. No, no, no, it was very brief, and very horrible, and Casey's still not over it.",
        "Jade: Well, it's not like I'm not looking for anything long term. I just want a few paychecks and if she's hard on me, I'll walk.",
        "Luke: Jade, I don't think you understand the hard time that Emily Stewart can dish out.",
        "Jade: I don't think you understand the hard time I can take. So do you think Alison will give me a recommendation?",
        "Luke: I guess so. It depends on if she and her sister are speaking this week.",
        "Jade: Oh, I mean, she was really nice to me at the hospital when Derek was shot.",
        "Luke: We can ask.",
        "Jade: All right. Well, let me fill this out first. Do you have any experience? No. Have you ever been arrested or convicted of a crime? Yes. That should get her attention.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mrs. Geller: Well, I think we've identified some very good prospects. I'll make appointments and you can tour the properties.",
        "Meg: Sounds great. Well, thank you very much.",
        "Mrs. Geller: Mrs. Donovan! You forgot your folder.",
        "Meg: Oh, that's right. Thank you. Thanks.",
        "Mrs. Geller: I'll speak to you soon.",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Josie: I'm sorry, I -- I couldn't help but overhear -- Mrs. Donovan?",
        "Meg: Dusty and I are married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Come on Meg, pick up the phone.",
        "Dusty: She's not going to answer.",
        "Paul: Meg wouldn't do this. She wouldn't do something like this to me.",
        "Dusty: She already did.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I'll change her mind.",
        "Dusty: You're not going to talk to her.",
        "Paul: You don't get to tell me what to do.",
        "Dusty: I'm telling you -- you can't go anywhere with Eliza alone. I need to be with you. You can't go near Meg. No visits, no accidental run-ins, go betweens, no contact at all.",
        "Paul: Why would I agree to that?",
        "Dusty: I don't care if you agree. No one's asking you to. Those are the conditions if you want to see your daughter --",
        "Paul: Who the hell are you to give me conditions?",
        "Dusty: I'm Meg's husband. I'm just doing what she asked me to do.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I want to hear it from her.",
        "Dusty: You won't be. You break the rules once, we go to the judge and we lay out your history. It'll be 18 years before you ever see Eliza again.",
        "Paul: Hey, put her down.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Paul: You put my little girl down. You get your hands off of her, now! Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I am so sorry you had to find out like this.",
        "Josie: It's okay.",
        "Meg: Dusty should've told you.",
        "Josie: He said that he proposed.",
        "Meg: Did he tell you why?",
        "Josie: To protect you from Paul.",
        "Meg: Well, that's part of it. He's also wants to show a judge that he can give Johnny the stable home and family that Craig can't.",
        "Josie: What's stable about being married to someone whose mentally ill ex- husband is obsessed with her?",
        "Meg: I thought you were Paul's friend.",
        "Josie: Doesn't matter. Craig's lawyer is going to lay that out as a reason that Dusty shouldn't have Johnny. It's going to be hard for a judge to disagree.",
        "Meg: Well, Dusty doesn't seem to be worried.",
        "Josie: He thinks he can get whatever he wants with his charming smile.",
        "Meg: Look, I know this isn't easy for you.",
        "Josie: I'm not talking about me.",
        "Meg: But none of this changes anything between you and Dusty.",
        "Josie: There is nothing between me and Dusty. I'm surprised that he still speaks to me after what Paul and I put him through. And that's the point. Johnny is already stuck between Craig and Dusty, the last thing that he needs is to be caught up in Paul's psychodrama with you.",
        "Meg: Well, Dusty doesn't feel he has any others options.",
        "Josie: It's because he is as obsessed with you as Paul is.",
        "Meg: That's not true.",
        "Josie: Open your eyes, Meg. I would've been Dusty's wife of convenience, or anything else. And he knows that. And I don't come with any baggage. But he chose you. What did Paul say when you told him?",
        "Meg: I didn't.",
        "Josie: What, do you think he's not going to find out?",
        "Meg: Dusty's there right now. He's telling him.",
        "Josie: Are you kidding me? You -- you let Dusty do your dirty work for you?",
        "Meg: He insisted!",
        "Josie: And you let him? You're even more of a coward than I thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Give me my daughter.",
        "Dusty: Stop freaking out, Paul. That won't help anyone.",
        "Paul: I'm not freaking out. I just want to spend a little time with her. That's why Meg sent you in the first place, remember?",
        "Dusty: Meg said I got to stay right here.",
        "Paul: I know, I heard all of that.",
        "Dusty: You're okay with that?",
        "Paul: I just want to spend some time with her. You get the hell out of my house.",
        "Dusty: If I leave, Eliza's going with me.",
        "Paul: You don't get to make the rules, Dusty. And you're never touching this little girl again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You're saying, Emily actually told you not to go out with me?",
        "Alison: I don't remember her exact words.",
        "Casey: Yes, you do.",
        "Alison: It doesn't matter.",
        "Casey: Since when do you start doing what she tells you to?",
        "Alison: She asked me.",
        "Casey: Emily does not ask.",
        "Alison: You're wrong. She is very vulnerable right now.",
        "Casey: Emily? Vulnerable?",
        "Alison: Yes, Dusty really hurt her.",
        "Casey: Oh, of course, Dusty, yes.",
        "Alison: Oh, what? You thought it was you?",
        "Casey: I'm the one she's asked you not to see.",
        "Alison: Okay, yes, you hurt her too. What, does that make you feel better?",
        "Casey: She hurt me a lot more than I hurt her.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well you know what? I was the one who messed things up with her and Dusty in the first place.",
        "Casey: What does that have to do with you and me?",
        "Alison: I just don't want to make anything else harder for her.",
        "Casey: When do you do what's right for you?",
        "Alison: And you're one of the things that's right for me, is that it?",
        "Casey: I think so.",
        "Alison: The way you were so good for Maddie? Sorry, I just -- just really don't want to hurt my sister right now.",

        "Jade: Yeah, me too. Hey.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Jade: Are you okay?",
        "Casey: You were there.",
        "Jade: Oh, can I sit?",
        "Casey: I don't know why you'd want to, but yeah, sure.",
        "Jade: So you're really into her, huh?",
        "Casey: Alison, um, I don't know. I just can't believe that Emily blew it up before I could even find out.",
        "Jade: Well, does Alison always take orders from her sister?",
        "Casey: No. No.",
        "Jade: So why this time?",
        "Casey: Yeah, you're right. I --",
        "Jade: Sometimes you got to take no for an answer.",
        "Casey: She's probably just not -- not into me.",
        "Jade: I don't see why not. What -- you're a good guy. And you're funny and you're not bad looking. And you're pretty damn brave.",
        "Casey: Wow, you really have been out of town for a while, haven't you?",
        "Jade: What is with that?",
        "Casey: With what?",
        "Jade: By putting yourself down all the time.",
        "Casey: Well, it's called reality.",
        "Jade: Look, I don't see a bunch of Nobel Prize winners around here. I just see a lot of people messing up their lives.",
        "Casey: Oh, you've noticed?",
        "Jade: So my point is, you don't have to dump on yourself all the time.",
        "Casey: Of course, your perspective might be slightly off.",
        "Jade: Why? Because of hanging out with guys like my ex? But you don't think Robby has a bright future ahead of him? Okay, yeah, my view is a little warped. But the point is, you saved my life and that makes you look pretty good to me.",
        "Casey: Wow, if you don't stop that, I might start blushing.",
        "Jade: Oh, let me go get us a latte while you're --",
        "Casey: No, no, I'll get it. It's the least I can do for all the nice lies you've been telling me.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Emily: Emily Stewart.",
        "Jade: I'll take the job.",
        "Emily: When can you start?",
        "Jade: I already did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: How furious was he when you told him we were married?",
        "Dusty: He was also upset he didn't get to spend time with Eliza alone.",
        "Meg: So -- so what happened?",
        "Dusty: Well, he didn't want me there. Josie got there, he cooled off.",
        "Meg: It must've been pretty tense.",
        "Dusty: The main thing is, you didn't have to be there. And it ended okay.",
        "Meg: I want Eliza to have her father in her life. As long as he's reasonable.",
        "Dusty: He will be. He has no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: So what are you planning on doing?",
        "Paul: About what?",
        "Josie: About moving on.",
        "Paul: Nothing. Come on, I'm not moving on.",
        "Josie: Paul, if you do something stupid --",
        "Paul: I'm not going to do anything stupid. But I'm not going to let Dusty get away with this.",
        "Josie: What are you planning to do?",
        "Paul: You'll find out when you need to know. So will your boyfriend.",
        "Josie: He's not --",
        "Paul: When I'm through with Dusty, he won't know what hit him.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Brad: What's with the -- is that on?",
        "Cameraman: We're here to start taping. Didn't Katie tell you?",
        "Craig: You just tell the judge that I would be a better father than Dusty Donovan.",
        "Dusty: And after today, nobody can take away my son.",
        "Paul: Meg is not your wife. She's mine."
