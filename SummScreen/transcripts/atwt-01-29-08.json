        "Dallas: Of course --",
        "Margo: Now, go through that file and make sure we've covered all our bases because I don't want any surprises with the Donovan case.",
        "Dallas: Okay, all right. Wait -- wait, you know, Chief? How do you think Jack is going to react when he finds out you arrested Holden?",
        "Margo: Why don't you let me just handle Jack, okay? I'm not going to have him interrogating anyone from his own family. I know from experience how awful that feels.",
        "Tom: Well, hello, Chief.",
        "Margo: Well, hello.",
        "Tom: Time to call it a day. You're all mine.",
        "Margo: Oh, you think you can just waltz in here and sweep me out from underneath of all these paperwork, huh?",
        "Tom: Yeah. I think I can because you're going to take the rest of the day off. It can be a sick day, personal day, unauthorized leave, nobody loves me today day -- I don't care what you call it, but you're coming with me right now. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, okay. What -- wait a minute, where's the rose petals? Where's the candles? Where's -- I mean -- you dragged me out of the station in the middle of a major murder investigation, I thought this was going to be a little afternoon delight or something.",
        "Tom: So, I spring for takeout from Al's and that's not romantic anymore?",
        "Margo: I guess at our age it is.",
        "Tom: Well, I thought we could use some overdue family time.",
        "Margo: Yeah, is that what they're calling it now?",
        "Tom: Yeah, but -- we're not alone.",
        "Margo: What?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Can you believe how much Hallie has changed? I think she's gotten so much bigger since when she was born. Oh, you've held her, what do you think?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, she's definitely grown since the christening, yeah.",
        "Sofie: She's got her own sweet personality. And I don't -- all she wants to do is eat, and then sleep, and then eat again -- oh, and the snuggles -- I love snuggling with her. She's -- she's so soft and she smells so good.",
        "Aaron: Don't forget about the diaper changes and the spit up.",
        "Sofie: No -- no, I don't care. I don't care. She's perfect. She's amazing. She's just a beautiful little baby.",

        "Sofie: Well, I never thought that I would be able to happy again after I gave her away. But then, Will and Gwen have been so -- so good about letting me spent time with my little girl.",
        "Aaron: Actually, I mean -- Gwen and Will's little girl now.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I know -- I know that. I know that. You know, when she was born, I didn't think I would ever want to be near her. Do you -- do you remember the day Gwen and Will adopted her?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, you couldn't get out there fast enough. I thought seeing Hallie would break your heart.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I know. You know, it's crazy, right? And now Hallie's all I can think of.",

        "Gwen: Will, I don't want to do this.",
        "Will: We have to. Sofie --she's crossed the line. She's practically stalking the babysitter.",
        "Gwen: She wasn't stalking her. She was just checking on her.",
        "Will: Bonnie warned us that we needed to set boundaries and I think she was right. Hallie's ours. We have to do this for our daughter. We don't have a choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: There's been no change.",
        "Kim: Well, that just means that he's holding steady. He is so tough, like you.",
        "Chris: I'm just trying to do what Dad would do if he was still in charge.",
        "Kim: I know -- I know, Sweetheart. And he would be so proud of the way you've handled everything since Dusty was killed. I mean, you dealt with the press, protected the position of the hospital. You calmed the board -- I mean, that in itself is a miracle. And when he wakes up, I am going to tell him in great detail what a wonderful job you've done.",
        "Chris: I'll check in with you later.",
        "Kim: Okay --",
        "Chris: Thank you for your vote of confidence.",

        "Evan: Whoa, whoa, Donovan really shook you up, didn't he? Come on, man, you didn't have a problem with signing these the other night. Look, don't let Dusty Donovan have the last laugh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I can do this. I need to make peace with what happened. What I did that night.",

        "Lily: It makes sense.",
        "Holden: No, you're just confused.",
        "Lily: No, I'm not. I was here -- I was here in this stairwell and you found me. And I had the syringe in my hand. The syringe that Margo found out at the farm. It was in my hand. Why did you tell the police that I was in my room all night when I wasn't --?",
        "Holden: You know what? We need to get out of here.",
        "Lily: Because you think that I did it. You think that I killed Dusty?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, I never said that you killed Dusty.",
        "Lily: You didn't have to. You think that I did it.",
        "Holden: You had just been admitted to the hospital for an overdose. You had your stomach pumped. How could you possibly remember anything?",
        "Lily: Did you or did you not find me in this stairwell with a syringe in my hand?",
        "Holden: I did.",
        "Lily: I will not let you take the blame for something that I did. I'm not going to let you cover for me.",
        "Holden: Lily --",
        "Lily: It's not right. Not after everything we've been through.",
        "Holden: I'm not going to let you be taken away from our kids.",
        "Lily: What about you? Our children need you, too.",
        "Holden: I can't even think about that right now. The fact of the matter is, I owe you.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about?",
        "Holden: Dusty -- he said some things to me. I didn't want to hear them, but -- it was true. I didn't treat you well. I didn't listen to you. I pushed you into his arms.",
        "Lily: That doesn't mean you go to jail for me.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm going to get off. These charges -- they're not going to stick. I'll get out of it.",
        "Lily: What -- what if you don't? You hid the murder weapon. Holden, if something happens to you because of something that I have done, I will never forgive myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I don't feel right about this.",
        "Evan: Look, forget about what happened to Dusty. Okay, this is about business. Our research project. There's nothing stopping us now.",
        "Chris: The situation is a little more complicated.",
        "Evan: You made a commitment. Don't back down now because you're afraid of what people will think.",

        "Kim: I keep trying to be strong and cheery and positive for everybody's sake. But between you and me -- you know the thing is, you're my better half. I -- I miss you whispering in my ear and telling me all those bad jokes. You know, I -- I feel like we were in the middle of -- of planning the rest of our lives. There's so many -- so many things we were planning to do together. Am I driving you crazy talking like this? I'm driving myself crazy. You know, there is one way to stop me talking. You can just -- wake up. Honey, feel free to wake up here any time now. Sooner would be better than later. Oh, God. Please. Please. Please. I'm going -- okay?",
        "[Kim gasps]",

        "Margo: Yes, yes. Oh, my baby.",
        "Casey: Come on, Mom.",

        "Margo: Oh, would you just give me a minute to be a mommy?",
        "Casey: Yeah, one minute, I'll time you.",
        "Margo: There.",
        "Casey: What was that for?",
        "Margo: Because you fought with a prison guard. What were you thinking?",

        "Casey: I know, Mom, but I really don't want to talk about it right now.",
        "Tom: Yeah, we get that.",
        "Casey: I want to take it all in, enjoy being home.",
        "Tom: Well, that's what we want that, too.",
        "Casey: It's been a long time. It's so quiet here. Has it always been like this?",

        "Sofie: Well, I was just about to sit down and have lunch.",
        "Gwen: Do you think you could come by the house when you're done? Will and I -- we just want to talk to you about something.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Tell me that we're doing the right thing.",
        "Will: We're protecting our family.",
        "Gwen: A family that we owe to Sofie.",
        "Will: Hallie belongs to us now, and if Sofie wants to be part of Hallie's life, then she's got to know that there are lines she can't cross.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Oh, Sweetheart, I feel like I've been waiting for you forever.",
        "Bob: I'm right here.",
        "Kim: I know. And you're really back.",
        "Bob: Looks that way.",
        "Kim: Oh, it does! Oh, thank God. Listen, hold on, now. Don't leave me, now. Hang in there. I just have to call Chris. Don't leave me. Chris, Chris! Honey, hurry! Your father's awake, and he's talking.",
        "Chris: Dad? He's alert and reactive. This is a very good sign.",
        "Kim: I know, and he's talking. He's talking more than at Christmas.",
        "Chris: How you feeling, Dad?",
        "Bob: I'm hungry.",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey, that's so wonderful. Isn't that a good sign?",
        "Chris: You gave us a real scare. Kind of had us all worried there, Dad.",
        "Bob: You can't get rid of me that easily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, let's not jump to any conclusions here, all right? You need to try to remember. Try to remember when you were here in the stairwell.",
        "Lily: I just remember you finding me.",
        "Holden: Take your time. Just try to retrace your steps.",
        "Lily: Okay. It's hazy. It's very hazy.",
        "Holden: And you picked up the syringe somewhere, right?",
        "Lily: Yes. I remember the syringe being in my hand.",
        "Holden: Okay, try to visualize it. Did you get it from a cart, from a counter? Did it come from someone's room?",
        "Lily: No, nothing like that. It was on the floor.",
        "Holden: Are you sure?",
        "Lily: I'm sure. It was definitely on the floor.",
        "Holden: Where?",
        "Lily: I saw the syringe in an office. And he was there.",
        "Holden: Who? Who did you see?",
        "Lily: Dusty.",
        "Holden: Are you sure you saw Dusty?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Holden: Did he say anything to you? Did you have an argument, then?",
        "Lily: No, no, it wasn't anything like that at all.",
        "Holden: Lily, did you use the syringe on Dusty?",
        "Lily: No. No, I didn't use it. He was lying on the floor. Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: Oh, my God. Dusty -- he was already dead. He was already dead when I got into the room.",
        "Holden: Are you sure?",
        "Lily: I'm absolutely sure. He was there, lying on the floor and he wouldn't move.",
        "Holden: If you didn't kill him, then who did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Schedule a CT scan. Full blood work up, including cardiac enzymes, blood culture, CBC and chem seven.",
        "Kim: Honey, excuse me, but does your father really need all of those tests so soon? I mean, he just woke up. He says he's hungry. Shouldn't we give him a chance to kind of collect his strength a bit?",
        "Chris: Well, I know you're worried, Mom. But we just need to run these labs just to make sure we have no more surprises. It's routine.",
        "Bob: I'd order the same tests.",
        "Kim: Okay. My second opinion here. Honey, it's just that I've been waiting here for you every single day, and I just don't want anything to go wrong.",
        "Bob: I'm sorry.",
        "Kim: No, no, no! Heavens, you have nothing to be sorry about. I wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else.",
        "Chris: Mom, I want to run one more exam before we take him to get his tests.",
        "Kim: Okay, you want me to leave, I guess.",
        "Chris: Just for a few minutes, Mom.",
        "Kim: All right. I'll be outside. You know, I'm going to call family.",
        "Chris: Okay, Mom. It's really great to have you awake, Dad. I'm glad you're back. What is it, Dad?",
        "Bob: Where's Dusty?",
        "Chris: He's not here. Dusty's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Thanks, Dad. Lunch was great. Of course, not as good as yours would've been, Mom.",
        "Tom: Well, I just wanted to ease the transition between prison food and your Mom's cooking.",
        "Margo: Watch it, watch it, watch it.",
        "Casey: You two haven't changed at all.",
        "Margo: So, Baby, have you given any thought to what you want to do now?",
        "Casey: I was thinking about catching a nap.",
        "Margo: No, I don't mean now now, I mean in your life.",
        "Casey: Don't hold back, Mom.",
        "Margo: Well, what do you want to do? Do you want to go back to school? We can get you readmitted to Oakdale U. I could call the admissions office. You know, the semester's just started, so you'd be --",
        "Casey: No, I'm not sure that's a good idea.",
        "Margo: And you don't even have to live in the dorms. You can live back here. You know, with the transition and everything.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I don't want to jump into anything right now, except maybe like a shower and my own bed.",
        "Margo: Okay, all right, so school's off the table. Any other options for you?",
        "Casey: Seriously, do we have to talk about this right now?",
        "Margo: Well, yeah, we do, kind of. Because I'm sure that your parole officer has certain expectations, right?",
        "Tom: I think we have time to figure this stuff out.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I can try and get a job, if my record doesn't scare everyone off. Do you know anyone hiring ex-cons right now?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Tom: Excuse me. Hello?",
        "Kim: Tommy? Tommy, I have the most wonderful news in the world. Your father is awake and he is talking. He's weak, but he's alert. But you know what, he's already cracking bad jokes.",
        "Tom: That's great! Can we come and see him?",
        "Kim: Oh, please, please, he'd love to see you. And come now, because Chris is going to take him for some tests.",
        "Tom: Okay, we'll be on our way soon. Hey. Dad's awake. And Kim wants us to come to the hospital right away.",
        "Margo: Great. How is he?",
        "Tom: Well apparently, much better. Come on, let's go.",
        "Margo: All right, let's go. Sorry, Hun. Come on, come on.",
        "Tom: Dude, you coming?",
        "Casey: I'm not sure if seeing me right now would be the best thing for Grandpa. Maybe I should stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, Guys. Hey, Aaron, I didn't expect to see you.",
        "Aaron: Hope its okay.",
        "Gwen: Absolutely. Come inside. Aaron, I heard about your dad. I'm really sorry. How's he doing?",
        "Aaron: He's hanging in there. Thank you.",
        "Sofie: Do you need me to baby-sit again? I'd love to. Aaron and I make a great team.",
        "Will: That's not actually why we called. Let's sit down.",
        "Sofie: You guys -- you guys look so serious. Is something wrong with Hallie? Is she okay?",
        "Gwen: No, no, Hallie's -- Hallie's fine. We just -- we need --",

        "Aaron: Do you guys mind if I go? I'll go check on her.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: That'd be great. Thank you so much.",
        "Aaron: Okay, all right.",
        "Sofie: Why is it okay for Aaron to help Hallie and not me?",
        "Will: Aaron's her godfather.",
        "Sofie: I'm her --",
        "Gwen: Sofie, Will and I feel like you're getting a little too attached to Hallie. And we would just like to talk to you a little bit about that --",
        "Sofie: Are you telling me I can't spend time with Hallie anymore?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "[Emily leaves the room Dusty died in]",
        "Lily: I'm sure. Maybe being in there will trigger another memory. Emily. Emily, Emily, what the hell were you doing in there?",
        "Lily: Answer my question.",
        "Emily: It's none of your business.",
        "Holden: All right, can we not do this here?",
        "Emily: Let's not. You stop looking at me like that. Holden, I heard Margo brought you in for questioning for Dusty's murder? Is that true?",
        "Holden: That's true.",
        "Lily: Margo never should've arrested Holden.",
        "Emily: Did you really have the weapon?",
        "Lily: He is innocent.",
        "Emily: And let me guess, you're looking for the real killer. Right, Lily?",
        "Holden: Emily, I'm sorry about Dusty. I know you two were close.",
        "Emily: Yeah, Dusty hurt a lot of people. I'm sorry you had to be one of them.",
        "Holden: She seemed in a bad way.",
        "Lily: Serves her right. Let's just get this over with, please.",
        "Holden: What? What is it?",
        "Lily: I remember the feeling. I was cold. It was very cold. I must have been in shock.",
        "Holden: What about before you got here? Did you see anything in the hallway? On the way? If Dusty was already dead, maybe you saw something, someone.",
        "[Lily remembers]",
        "Lily: I saw someone leave here just before I got here.",

        "Chris: Yeah, it's the best news we could possibly have, considering everything else that's going on.",
        "Margo: I'm off the clock now. Let's just be family.",
        "Chris: Thanks, Margo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I didn't mean to say that. It came out wrong. Please, don't hold it against me.",
        "Will: We just -- we need to limit your contact with Hallie. That's all.",
        "Sofie: No. Please, no. I will back off. I will stop pushing.",
        "Gwen: We just need a little more time together as a family.",
        "Sofie: So you think that if I spent less time with Hallie, it's better for everyone?",
        "Will: We have to put Hallie first.",
        "Gwen: Listen, I'm sorry. I should've realized how hard this was gonna be for you. It was never my intention to hurt you.",
        "Sofie: It's too late now. [Hallie cries] Can I say good-bye to her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, handsome. We missed you. It's good to have you back with us. You look fabulous.",
        "Bob: You're not so bad yourself, Kid.",
        "Tom: Hey, anybody call Mom or Gram?",
        "Kim: Oh, I tried both, I couldn't get through. And it dawned on me, I think this is Nancy's bridge club -- and I assume your mother would be at work by now.",
        "Tom: Yeah, I'm going to try them again.",
        "Kim: Okay, thanks, Dear.",
        "Casey: Dad, do you mind telling them I'm not home yet?",
        "Tom: What are you talking about? They're going to be happy to see you.",
        "Casey: I know. I was thinking I'd like to surprise them myself, if that's cool with you.",
        "Tom: Sure, no problem.",
        "Casey: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Nurse: It's time to take Dr. Hughes for his tests.",
        "Kim: Oh, so soon?",
        "Chris: Well Mom, the sooner we do this and see how he's doing, the sooner we can get him back home where he belongs, with you.",
        "Kim: Well okay, I can't argue with that. I promise you, I will be right here waiting.",
        "Bob: I'm counting on it.",
        "Chris: Get him prepped. I'll meet you in the CT lab shortly. What do you want, Emily?",
        "Emily: The nurse told me your father's awake. I just want to know how he's doing.",
        "Chris: What do you care? Last time I checked, we were over.",
        "Emily: That's not fair. I still care about you.",
        "Chris: You shouldn't be here. I don't want you to upset anyone else.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what, Bob happens to be Daniel's grandfather. I have a right to know how he's doing.",
        "Chris: Dad's doing fine. He's alert. We'll know more after we get his tests back.",
        "Emily: That's great news. You don't seem to be too happy about that.",
        "Chris: Why do you say that?",
        "Emily: I don't know. You seem a little troubled to me.",
        "Chris: Dad asked me something when he woke up.",
        "Emily: What's that?",
        "Chris: Where's Dusty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I was coming down the hallway and someone ran out of that room. It happened so fast.",
        "Holden: Do you think this person saw you?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I'm not sure. But they ran off in this direction. I don't know, it's very hazy.",
        "[Lily remembers]",
        "Lily: Oh, my God. It was Emily.",
        "Holden: You saw Emily?",
        "Lily: I did. She ran out of that office earlier. It was so familiar. It was exactly the same way it happened the night that Dusty was killed.",
        "Holden: Did she say anything?",
        "Lily: Emily killed Dusty.",
        "Holden: No, no, no, you don't know that.",
        "Lily: She did.",
        "Holden: You don't know that. Maybe you just want to believe that Emily did it.",
        "Lily: No, no. Emily killed Dusty.",
        "Holden: Why would she kill Dusty?",
        "Lily: Because I drove her to it. I'm the reason that Emily killed Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Bob asked about Dusty?",
        "Chris: Not the first words I expected him to say.",
        "Emily: Well, what did you say to him?",
        "Chris: The truth. I told him Dusty was gone.",
        "Emily: \"Gone?\" Did you tell him that Dusty's dead?",
        "Chris: I told him Dusty was gone. I have to get to the CT room.",
        "Emily: Tom.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Emily: I heard the good news about your dad.",
        "Tom: Thanks. They just took him down for tests.",
        "Emily: I think I'll call Daniel at school, fill him in on the good news.",
        "Tom: I appreciate it.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Kim: Yes.",
        "Tom: I got in touch with Gram and Mom. And they're both going to be here soon.",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey, thanks so much. That's wonderful. I'm going to call the station and let them know the good news.",
        "Margo: What's up with you? You seem kind of restless.",
        "Casey: No, I'm good.",
        "Margo: Oh, Honey, why don't you get out of here and go see Gwen and Will, huh?",
        "Casey: I don't know if they'll be too happy to see me right now. I didn't exactly stay in touch with them while I was away.",
        "Margo: Oh, please, if anyone understands what you're going through right now, it's Will. He's your friend. Go see him.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Tom: Don't push.",
        "Margo: I'm not pushing. Am I pushing?",
        "Casey: No, fine. No. I'll go. They still live at Lucinda's place by the lake?",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, they do. And you can see Hallie.",
        "Casey: Who's Hallie?",
        "Margo: Go and see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hey, baby girl.",
        "Aaron: Do you want to hold her?",
        "Gwen: You can.",
        "Sofie: No. No, that's okay. I'm not going to be around for a while. I need to give your mommy and your daddy some space. But I'm going to be thinking about you every minute. And I'm going to miss you so much. But I know you're going to be happy. Because you're going to be surrounded by friends and family, and you're not even going to notice that I'm not here. I love you so much, little girl.",
        "Aaron: I'm going to go take care of her. So I'll see you guys.",
        "Gwen: That was hard.",
        "Will: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: It's cold. I can run into Java and get something to warm you up.",
        "Sofie: No, thank you.",
        "Aaron: You want to talk about what happened?",
        "Sofie: No, what's the point? I have to face this. I started it when I gave my baby away. You know, I really thought I could do this. But saying good-bye to Hallie -- it was like losing her all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Why would you be responsible for what Emily did?",
        "Lily: You have no idea why Dusty ended things with me.",
        "Holden: It wasn't my business.",
        "Lily: He ended things with me because he was still in love with Emily. And I was so upset and I was so hurt, and I went to Yo's and I had some drinks and I had some pills, and I ran into one of Emily's ex co-workers.",
        "Holden: Someone from \"The Intruder?\"",
        "Lily: No. They knew each other through Cheri Love. Emily was a prostitute. She was a hooker here in Oakdale.",
        "Holden: A prostitute? A hooker? That's crazy.",
        "Lily: Yes, it is crazy, but it is absolutely true. And I went to Dusty and I told him, and he already knew all about it and I was hurt. And I wanted to make Emily to hurt the same way that I was hurting. So I did something horrible.",
        "Holden: Tell me.",
        "Lily: I -- this is just awful. I wrote an anonymous note to Chris about Emily being a hooker and I put it under his door. And Emily was convinced that Dusty wrote the note. And I let her believe it, and look what happened.",
        "Holden: Well, that explains why Chris blew up at Dusty the party.",
        "Lily: It was me. I set things in motion and now Dusty is gone, and he's never coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: What are you still doing here?",
        "Emily: We need to talk.",
        "Chris: We've got nothing left to say to each other.",
        "Emily: No, that's not how I see it. We need to get our stories straight.",
        "Chris: I don't have a story.",
        "Emily: Dusty died believing you poisoned your father and caused his stroke. That sounds like a story to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm so sorry. You're facing murder charges because of me.",
        "Holden: Lily, I made the decision to hide syringe out at the farm.",
        "Lily: Because you thought I was guilty. You had every right to believe that I killed Dusty. Why would you believe anything that I say?",
        "Holden: Stop, okay? I'm going to stand by you because it's the right thing to do. I should have known that you could never kill him, because I know you.",
        "Lily: I don't know how I let things get to this point. I am so sorry. I am so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I didn't tell my father about Dusty's accusations, and I'm not going to. There is no truth to them. I didn't poison my father. Dusty is gone and he's not coming back.",
        "Emily: Lucky for you.",
        "Chris: Lucky for you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I'm officially freezing now. Come on, let me walk you back to the Lakeview.",
        "Sofie: No, I'd rather be by myself.",
        "Aaron: I don't want you to be alone.",
        "Sofie: You know, I'm going to be fine. And your family needs you more than I do.",
        "Aaron: Sofie, I know what you're going through is tough, but it's going to get better. It's just going to take some time.",
        "Sofie: Thank you, Aaron, for everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I told you I'd be right here. I love you.",
        "Bob: I love you, too.",
        "Margo: I wasn't being pushy.",
        "Tom: You know I love you more than anything else in the world, right?",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Tom: And I'm not trying to upset you by telling you what to do.",
        "Margo: That's never stopped you before.",
        "Tom: Okay then, you need to give him a break. You're already pressuring him about a job, going back to school, what happened in prison.",
        "Margo: Well, he's my kid. I want him to get on with his life, make the best of everything.",
        "Tom: Okay, just don't try so hard.",
        "Margo: Well, don't you think it's important that he reconnect with his friends?",
        "Tom: I think it's important that you let him do this at his own pace. We both know what prison can do to a person. So just give him a break. He's not going to just fall back into his old life. This is going to be a huge adjustment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I'm really proud of you. The way you handled the whole situation, you were amazing.",
        "Gwen: I felt like I was betraying the woman who gave us a family.",
        "Will: You were protecting our family and that took guts.",
        "Gwen: I couldn't have done it without you.",
        "Will: It was pretty hot.",
        "Gwen: Are you saying I'm a hot mom?",
        "Will: Yeah, the hottest.",
        "Gwen: You're kind of weird, but I love you anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You think I had something to do with Dusty's murder?",
        "Chris: You think I did?",
        "Emily: I can't believe you're accusing me.",
        "Chris: You've kept secrets from me before.",
        "Emily: You think I murdered Dusty.",
        "Chris: I can't believe you think I'd poison my own father.",
        "Emily: Well, you seemed like you were covering your tracks.",
        "Chris: Oh, I could say the same thing about you.",
        "Emily: So where does this leave us?",
        "Chris: At a stalemate, I guess. We both keep our mouth shut and nobody else will get hurt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: We have to go see Jack. He will believe me -- that I saw Emily leave this room that night.",
        "Holden: Lily, you don't have to do this.",
        "Lily: Yes, I do. I have to make things right. You don't have to protect me anymore.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Cowboy Jack: You want to be with Carly, you gotta get rid of Parker.",
        "Jack: Well yeah, so you're saying this is all my fault?",
        "Will: I hope I can be there for him the same way he was for me.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I think he just needs friends right now more than anything else.",
        "Vienna: Tell her you love her. Can you do that?"
