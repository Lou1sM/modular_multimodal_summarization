        "Lily: Damian, please, don't do this. Just let Holden go.",
        "Holden: Lily, it's going to be okay.",
        "Damian: Don't speak to my wife like she's yours.",
        "Lily: He's not. Look at me. Think about what you're doing. You can stop this from happening.",
        "Damian: I can, if we go away now, Cara.",
        "Holden: Lily, its okay. He won't hurt me.",
        "Damian: You don't think I'll pull this trigger?",
        "Lily: Holden, no. He's already killed your sister.",
        "Damian: Lily, I'll let him live, but you have to leave with me now.",
        "Lily: Where will we go? What will we do?",
        "Damian: Listen to me, Cara. I know you're frightened. This wasn't part of the plan, but we can still make this right. That's how powerful our love is.",
        "Holden: He's lying.",
        "Damian: Shut up!",
        "Holden: Where does this end? First Meg, now me? Who's next? You, the kids?",
        "Damian: As if I would ever hurt you or the children, Lily. I love you.",
        "Lily: I believe you.",
        "Holden: You can't possibly mean that.",
        "Lily: Yes, I do. And that's why I'm going with Damian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: [Clears throat] Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Reid: No, you're not.",
        "Luke: Uh, do you have a minute, just to talk?",
        "Reid: Not really. This hospital's full of whining hypochondriacs. Must be something in the water.",
        "Luke: Well, I think you know that Noah's case is real.",
        "Reid: Like this guy. \"Chronic fatigue.\" Want to ship him C.O.D. to a leper colony, see how tired he is then.",
        "Luke: Your treatment methods are very unorthodox.",
        "Reid: Oh, listen to you, trying to sound all clever. You want to make me happy? Get me out of here. I don't enjoy being held hostage.",
        "Luke: Oh, that wasn't my decision. That was the judge's. But as long as you're here, you might --",
        "Reid: Look, I don't do charity work. Unfortunately, your boyfriend's case falls under that category. As soon as my attorneys get these bogus charges dropped, I'm out of here.",
        "Luke: Even though he's the only patient in this town worthy of your genius? Look, if you do this, I will put in a good word for you with Dr. Hughes, and I'll get you out of here early, maybe cut some of your legal fees.",
        "Reid: Wow. First blackmail, now bribery.",
        "Luke: Well, if it works, you bet.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Feel free to hang up if you want to, but, um -- if I need you, would you come over?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Katie, hey.",
        "Katie: Help.",
        "Henry: Help? Why? What's the matter?",
        "Katie: Jacob's been up all night. I don't know if he's coming down with something or he's teething or both. I can't get him to calm down.",
        "Henry: He's asleep now.",
        "Katie: Yeah, of course he is, 'cause that's in the baby manual. As soon as the mother starts acting like a freak show, the proof goes away.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I don't need any proof. I completely believe you. What do you need?",
        "Katie: I lost all my prep time for the show 'cause I was walking the floors all night with him. I didn't sleep at all, as I'm sure you can tell by the bags under my eyes.",
        "Henry: I don't see any bags under your eyes. You look --",
        "Katie: And my fridge is making this really weird, moaning sound all night, coming from the kitchen. The fridge is on the fritz.",
        "Henry: So you are stressed out.",
        "Katie: Yes. I think it's pretty much impossible to do this alone. I don't know how single women do it.",
        "Henry: [Sighs] Well, it takes a village. At least that's what I've been told. I don't know why you didn't call me and ask me for help. I would have come right over.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Henry: I could have come over in my PJs, and we could make some popcorn. We can calm the little fella down, and you and I could watch old movies all night.",
        "Katie: You're a genius.",
        "Henry: Yes, I am.",
        "Katie: No, seriously, Henry, you are. Why didn't I think of this myself?",
        "Henry: Uh, because of your job and your son, and -- and you're worried about being alone.",
        "Katie: That's just the thing. I don't have to be alone anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, you're not helping me by going with him.",
        "Damian: This isn't about you, Holden! You see, Lily and I, we're a team. She's my wife. She's made a vow to stay with me forever.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm begging you.",
        "Damian: Hey, hey, she's chosen to be with me, just like she did before.",
        "Holden: Damn it, Damian, this isn't a game.",
        "Damian: No one knows that more than I do. Now come on, Cara. Let's go.",
        "Meg: Holden! [Breathing heavily] I'm not -- dead -- yet. [Coughs]",
        "Holden: Meg, don't do this.",
        "Meg: This is what you mean by self-defense? You stuffed in that trunk!",
        "Damian: Meg, if you shoot me, Deerbrook will look like a vacation next to where they'll send you.",
        "Meg: Me?",
        "Holden: Meg, it's over. Give me the gun. You don't need to do this. You're not like him.",
        "Meg: I'm not sure about that, Holden. I'm crazy, remember? Violent -- unstable -- but this -- this would be just so justifiable.",
        "Damian: Meg, if you give me the gun, they won't send you away. They'll let you go. You'll be free.",
        "Meg: And then what? What happens to me after that?",
        "Damian: I -- I'll spend the rest of my life making this up to you.",
        "Meg: [Laughs] You'll always have the right thing to say, don't you, Damian?",
        "Damian: No, I mean it this time, Meg. I will make this up to you.",
        "Meg: How? You tried to kill me!",
        "Damian: That was an accident!",
        "Meg: By leaving me in a trunk? What's that? What do you call that?",
        "Holden: Meg, that's enough, okay? Just give me the gun.",
        "Damian: If you give it to him, there's no chance for us.",
        "Meg: My thoughts exactly.",
        "Damian: No!",
        "Lily: Damian! Aah!",
        "Holden: Lily -- Lily?",
        "[Sirens wailing]",
        "Holden: Meg! Lily, are you okay?",
        "[Lily groans]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I know for a fact that Noah's case doesn't bore you.",
        "Reid: You bore me. That's enough of a reason, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Luke: You said that Noah's surgery and his recovery will be very time- consuming.",
        "Reid: You think you're going to win points by repeating my words back to me?",
        "Luke: I'm just saying that you're basically under house arrest here. Why not use this time to help Noah?",
        "Reid: Look, I realize that this is a small town and that your boyfriend may be the only blind guy within a 100-mile radius, but he's not the only patient at this hospital.",
        "Luke: Well, he's the only one that you care about.",
        "Reid: I have rounds to make.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. I heard that that guy in the next room has this wicked case of athlete's foot. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to have a world-class neurosurgeon come in and help take that burning itch away.",
        "Reid: You really think you're endearing yourself to me, Mr. Snyder? Or should I say Mr. Grimaldi? Yeah, God bless the internet. Your family's reputation precedes you, though I got to say you're beginning to do it justice. First you offer money, and if that doesn't work, you move on to blackmail and bullying.",
        "Luke: Look, I don't want to blackmail you. I just want you to operate on Noah so he can see again. That's it.",
        "Reid: That's it?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Reid: Why didn't you say so? Here. Call my office in Dallas. Schedule yourself an appointment. I should have an opening this time next year if you're lucky. You can wait in line like everyone else. No? Okay. I can't be bought, and I'm not easily pushed around. That leaves you all out of luck, doesn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: What did this DVD ever do to you? [Laughs]",
        "Noah: What are you, clairvoyant?",
        "Maddie: Aw, it's from the night of the awards ceremony where your film won. Is it on here?",
        "Noah: Oh, the audio version is. Whether the actual picture -- you'll have to ask someone who can see.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Well, you want me to play it for you?",
        "Noah: Why? To remind me of all the films I'll never make?",
        "Maddie: Okay. All right. Why did you call me over here? 'Cause if it's to weigh in on all the reasons why it sucks to be you right now, you dialed the wrong ex. [Chuckles]",
        "Noah: No. That's not why I called you. I want you to take me to the hospital.",
        "Maddie: Are you okay?",
        "Noah: What do you think? I have to talk to Dr. Oliver. I have to beg him to perform the surgery on me.",
        "Maddie: I thought that was a dead end.",
        "Noah: I'm going to try again.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Yeah. I mean, I'm all for it. But why did you call me? Where's Luke?",
        "Noah: I don't know where Luke is, and I don't want him with me when I do this.",
        "Maddie: Isn't he the reason why the doctor's in Oakdale in the first place?",
        "Noah: Yeah. But because of the way he handled it, Dr. Oliver won't even give me the time of day.",
        "Maddie: Do you think there might be a reason why Luke put a hard sell on this guy? I think that there's one reason and one reason only, and it's because he loves you.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, this time, Luke loving me chased away the exact thing I need. So I need to help myself right now. I have to get to the hospital. I need to talk to this guy. Will you take me?",
        "Maddie: What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: People aren't meant to live alone. It's -- come on, come on. It's, uh -- it's not right. It messes with your head. It, um -- [Laughs] It's just -- here.",
        "[Katie laughs]",
        "Henry: We both know how depressing it is to order takeout for one, too, right?",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, I hate that.",
        "Henry: I hate that, too. But, um, if you and Jacob weren't alone --",
        "Katie: Then it would take some of the pressure off of me.",
        "Henry: That's right.",
        "Katie: Oh, and I won't have to worry about what to get for dinner, because Margo is the queen of takeout.",
        "Henry: Margo?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Who did you think I was talking about?",
        "Henry: Margo. I thought you were talking about Margo, your sister, yeah.",
        "Katie: I mean, if I could just live with her for like a month or two.",
        "Henry: Right.",
        "Katie: That way, I could get used to being a mother, get the show off the ground. Oh, my God. I'm going to be late.",
        "Henry: Late for what?",
        "Katie: For the show. To the studio.",
        "Henry: The show. Right, right, right, right.",
        "Katie: Thank you for letting me vent.",
        "Henry: Yay!",
        "Katie: Thank you for letting me vent long enough to come up with a really good plan.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Um, yeah, yeah.",
        "Katie: I mean, seriously. If you can't depend on your family in times of need, who can you depend on?",
        "Henry: Me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Sirens wailing]",
        "Lily: Holden?",
        "Holden: Right here.",
        "Lily: My head.",
        "Holden: You hit it. You're going to have a bump, but you'll be okay. I've got you.",
        "Lily: You've got me?",
        "Holden: I do.",
        "[Sirens wailing]",
        "Lily: Where's Damian? Is -- is Meg --",
        "Holden: He took off, and Meg ran after him.",
        "Lily: How could this happen? We got to go after him.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. You're not going anywhere. I'm going to take you downstairs, and then I'm going to take you to the hospital.",
        "Lily: Holden, I'm okay.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm not taking any chances.",
        "Molly: Wow. Really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "Katie: Come on, Sweetie. What's the matter? This is worse than last night. What's the matter, Baby? I got to get to work. What are we going to do? Do you have a fever?",
        "Reid: Unless your kid is the next Mozart, she's not going to answer you.",
        "Katie: You're a doctor?",
        "Reid: Clearly you're not the next Mozart either.",
        "Katie: Will you look at my baby?",
        "Reid: Do I have to?",
        "Katie: I mean will you examine her?",
        "Reid: Are you kidding me?",
        "Katie: Um, you're a doctor. I have a sick child. Aren't you bound by some sort of oath to help me?",
        "Reid: I'll have to check, but I'm pretty sure the oath is only binding on hospital property. This is a coffee shop.",
        "Katie: Seriously, you're not going to look at him? I'm sorry. I'm just a little stressed out, 'cause he's been like this since last night. And clearly you're here and I'm here, but I don't know. I don't even know why I was asking a podiatrist about a baby anyway.",
        "Reid: I look like a podiatrist?",
        "Katie: You look like you have your foot up your -- Jacob, it's fine. I'll find you a real doctor.",
        "Reid: Wait. Hold on. I'll -- look at your baby. You walk out with him screaming like that, he's going to be labeled a menace to society before he cuts his first tooth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Thank you.",
        "Maddie: You're welcome.",
        "Luke: Hi.",
        "Maddie: Hey, Luke.",
        "Luke: So, I, uh -- I guess you're going to do a follow-up on your vlog?",
        "Noah: No, I think I've given Maddie enough material to last for a while.",
        "Maddie: Hmm, true that.",
        "Luke: Well, uh, where are you going then?",
        "Noah: Maddie's taking me to the hospital.",
        "Luke: Are you okay? Something wrong?",
        "Noah: Oh, no, no. I just -- I want to see Dr. Oliver.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Noah: Because I want to talk to him.",
        "Luke: Without me? Well, okay, but I got to tell you, I just came from seeing him, and he's still not even going to consider doing your surgery.",
        "Noah: Well, I still need to try myself.",
        "Luke: Noah, the guy's impossible.",
        "Noah: With you, yeah.",
        "Luke: No, not just with me.",
        "Noah: Look, I am the patient here, okay? Not you. Thank you for -- for getting him here, but if -- if Dr. Oliver won't talk to you, then I have to try talking to him myself.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Luke: It's Damian.",
        "Noah: Take it. I have to go. Maddie?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, here.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Luke: Hey. What's up?",
        "Damian: Son, something happened. Um, I need you here at the office immediately.",
        "Luke: Can it wait a bit, seriously? I mean, I have a lot of stuff going on here, and --",
        "Damian: Luciano, I need you, right now.",
        "Luke: You sound funny. What's wrong?",
        "Damian: Just get here. I'm counting on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I guess my timing was off.",
        "Holden: When we go down the steps, I want you to hold onto me. You bumped your head, and you blacked out for a few seconds.",
        "Molly: What happened?",
        "Holden: Damian happened. He tried to kill my sister, and he hurt Lily.",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Holden: Yeah. He held a gun on me and, uh, tried to get Lily to leave with him.",
        "Molly: Leave with him to go where?",
        "Holden: Well, he thought he killed Meg, and he wanted to go overseas.",
        "Molly: Whoa, wait a minute. He thought he killed Meg? I don't understand.",
        "Holden: He strangled her, and he threw her in this chest, but she was alive.",
        "Molly: Oh, my God. Where -- where are they now?",
        "Holden: Damian ran off, and Meg ran after him.",
        "Molly: I can't believe Damian would do all that.",
        "Holden: Then what did you expect, Molly? A happy ending? All right, we need to get out of here. I think Lily may have a concussion. We need to get her to the hospital.",
        "Lily: I'm okay.",
        "Holden: No. We need to do this. Let's go.",
        "Molly: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Holden: Yeah. If the cops come, tell them that Damian left, and they need to try and find him before he hurts my sister again.",
        "Molly: I will. And I'll call you when --",
        "[Sirens wailing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: What's going on?",
        "Damian: Come in and close the door. There isn't much time.",
        "Luke: What do you mean there isn't much time? Damian, what's happened?",
        "Damian: I'm leaving the country.",
        "Luke: [Scoffs] Well, it doesn't look like you're going on a vacation with Mom.",
        "Damian: No, I'm going alone. There's a freighter leaving in two hours. I'm going to be on it.",
        "Luke: A freighter? Damian, you've got to tell me more than this. What the hell is happening?",
        "Damian: I wish I could tell you, son. I do. But I already took a risk asking you to come over here. I just couldn't do this without saying good-bye.",
        "Luke: Good-bye? Damian, you're freaking me out.",
        "Damian: Look, I wish I could tell you, but I need you to take over Grimaldi International.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, of course I'll watch it until --",
        "Damian: No, I mean take over, Son. I'm leaving you the company. Luke, this was always my plan. It's just happening sooner than I anticipated. But I have complete faith in you. I know you can handle it.",
        "Luke: This is insane.",
        "Damian: No, it's reality, Luciano. Life presents us with challenges, all right? It is a test of our strength of how we deal with those situations.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but what is the situation, Damian? You're running away, without Mom, without me! Damian, what have you done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: I think your kid's developing his first ear infection.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Reid: Yeah. Just -- it's not a flu. Take him to your pediatrician. He'll slap an antibiotic on him. He'll be better in ten minutes.",
        "Katie: Uh, well, first of all, my pediatrician is a she, and apparently, she's on vacation, according to her service. Do you have another pediatrician you could recommend?",
        "Reid: Oh, I'm a podiatrist, remember? What do I know from pediatrics?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry I said that before. I was just a little stressed out, and you were being, um -- not like you're being now. So, what kind of doctor are you?",
        "Reid: Neurosurgeon.",
        "Katie: You're a brain surgeon?",
        "Reid: Don't look so shocked.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. Just not what I expected.",
        "Reid: What did you think brain surgeons looked like?",
        "Katie: I don't know, but I thought they'd be a lot nicer.",
        "Reid: Sorry to disappoint.",
        "Katie: So, you're new here, huh?",
        "Reid: Yeah. Don't worry. I'm not going to stay here any longer than I have to.",
        "Katie: Why? You don't like Oakdale?",
        "Reid: No. I like being held against my will even less.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Reid: It's a long story.",
        "Katie: What's the short version?",
        "Reid: The chief of staff here is basically my professional warden for the next month or so. The head cases are not the kind I like to deal with. And on top of that, I had to stay at a hotel last night.",
        "Katie: Not a big fan of hotels?",
        "Reid: They're germ farms. Sharing sheets and pillows with complete strangers? It's -- ugh. Thank God I have no problem sleeping in chairs. And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go wash my hands. Your kid is a little germ breeder, too.",
        "Katie: You know, there are other options besides hotels, if you hate them so much. I'm just saying.",
        "Reid: What are you saying exactly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Sometimes it's like Luke is just two different people. He's this amazing, grounded guy with solid parents, but then there's this other side to him that's all --",
        "Maddie: Damian?",
        "Noah: Yeah! And when the Grimaldi side comes out, he -- he cuts corners, he takes risks. Except this time, the risk was my chance of being able to see again.",
        "Maddie: Well, maybe this risk will pay off.",
        "Noah: What would make you say that?",
        "Maddie: Because your big, bad brain surgeon would still be in Dallas instead of walking towards us right now.",
        "Noah: Dr. Oliver?",
        "Reid: Unless you're here for a flu shot, we have nothing more to say to one another, Mr. Mayer.",
        "Maddie: I'll come pick you up later.",
        "Reid: Hey, you can't just leave him here. What -- what if he trips over a nurse?",
        "Noah: Dr. Oliver, please, just -- just hear me out.",
        "Reid: No, it's your turn to hear me, okay? I'm done dealing with you and your boyfriend. If I wanted somebody to follow me around here, I'd get a dog or an intern.",
        "Noah: Luke doesn't speak for me.",
        "Reid: You might want to tell him that.",
        "Noah: Luke and I -- I don't know what we are right now, okay? All I know is that I can't see, and you're the one man who can change that.",
        "Reid: You really think minimizing your relationship to me is going to change my mind about the surgery?",
        "Noah: Well, your problems are with Luke, not me.",
        "Reid: And your problems with him?",
        "Noah: Are mine.",
        "Reid: You don't like the way he got me out here, do you?",
        "Noah: Not really.",
        "Reid: Is that the big issue between you two?",
        "Noah: No, no. The accident that caused my loss of sight -- if Luke had just listened to me, it might not have happened. Which is why I think he's acting the way he is. He's acting that way out of guilt.",
        "Reid: Not surprising.",
        "Noah: I -- I have a question for you. What do you want? What do you want more? Do you want to get back at Luke for disrupting your life, or do you want to add me to your growing list of successful operations?",
        "Reid: I haven't decided yet.",
        "Noah: How about you try?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I take it you're not saving this seat for anyone.",
        "Henry: Saving it? No, my dear sister, I am a, uh -- I'm a lone wolf these days.",
        "Maddie: Well, you're in a mood.",
        "Henry: You would be, too, if you were me.",
        "Maddie: All right. Lay it on me. I am a sponge today.",
        "Henry: Okay. Let's see. My beautiful ex-girlfriend can't stand the sight of me, my best friend is dead, and my other best friend is too busy being a single mother to see me. And, uh, my ex-roommate, the jewel thief -- he's history. So it is inevitable I will end up alone.",
        "Maddie: Oh, my God.",
        "Henry: No, don't you \"Oh, my God.\" I know it sounds melodramatic, but that is how I feel inside.",
        "Maddie: Henry, I get it. You're lonely. You want some company. So why don't you ask Katie?",
        "Henry: Ask Katie what?",
        "Maddie: If you can move in with her. I mean, that's what this is about, right? You're lonely. She's in a big house with a baby. So, see if she wants a roommate.",
        "Henry: She does.",
        "Maddie: You asked her?",
        "Henry: I thought she was going to ask me, but then she decided she wanted to move in with Margo instead.",
        "Maddie: Eh, well, Margo's pretty booked solid these days.",
        "Henry: Hmm?",
        "Maddie: Never mind. Look, why don't you just go over there and give her your pitch? You know, you could take out the garbage, change the baby, give her foot massages.",
        "Henry: What? No, I'm not giving a foot massage just to get a roof over my head, all right? I'm looking for a roommate, not a soul mate.",
        "Maddie: Well, so what if you happen to get both out of the deal?",
        "Henry: What are you talking about?",
        "Maddie: Henry, come on. Katie is your best friend, she's beautiful, she's got a kid that you adore, and -- and she's alone. What is your problem?",
        "Henry: Right now? This conversation. Nothing ruins a good friendship like love. Remember that.",

        "Lily: How could I let this happen?",
        "Holden: Lily, this is not your fault.",
        "Lily: I was with this man. I married him! He was helping raise our children, Holden, and I didn't see it. I don't know. Maybe I didn't want to.",
        "Holden: He didn't just deceive you. He did the same thing to my sister. There were other people, as well.",
        "Lily: I was his wife. Meg was his lover while we were married. Why were we both so desperate to want to trust Damian? How could we not see the man who was standing right next to us?",
        "Holden: Because you loved him. Okay, you loved who you thought he was.",
        "Holden: So, if wanting to believe in the love that you felt for someone makes you desperate, you're not alone.",
        "Molly: I spoke to the sheriff. He put out an APB for Meg and Damian. How are you?",
        "Lily: I'm fine, physically.",
        "Holden: Is there any word on them?",
        "Molly: No. They have, uh -- no word on them at all. Sorry.",
        "Lily: Thank you for handling that, Molly.",
        "Molly: I just can't stand that it went so far. I am so sorry. If I could go back and do it differently, I would.",
        "Doctor: Mrs. Grimaldi.",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Doctor: You two can step outside while I examine her.",
        "Holden: I'll be right outside.",
        "Lily: I know that.",
        "Molly: I heard what you said about love making you do desperate things.",
        "Holden: Lily's blaming herself for this. I'm trying to help her not do that.",
        "Molly: Maybe you can help me with the same thing? Can you help me forgive myself for making such a huge mistake out of desperation and love?",
        "Holden: Molly, I can't do this right now.",
        "Molly: Holden, I hate how upset you are with me.",
        "Holden: Upset? Do you realize what happened today?",
        "Molly: I do, and it's awful.",
        "Holden: Awful? It was preventable.",
        "Molly: I know.",
        "Holden: My sister, she was almost killed, and Lily, she was almost hurt, all because you felt desperate, and you were justified in not telling me the truth?",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry. I -- I will do anything you want to make it up to you -- anything. Just tell me what it is I can do.",
        "Holden: I can't do this right now.",
        "Molly: Holden, we were starting to build something really good together, and I think we can -- I know I made a huge mistake. But if we build on the good parts, we -- we can do that, Holden. Please?",
        "Holden: No, no. It's just not that simple.",
        "Molly: It is, it is. It can happen if you -- if you're willing.",
        "Holden: Molly, you gave Damian the chance to take Lily out of the country, away from our children, and almost killed my sister. How am I supposed to just forget about that?",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. I didn't want it this way. I wanted to come back and things to be different this time. I wanted the days of hiding and lying and acting out of desperation to be over in New York with the idiot congressman. But, Holden, you came as this huge surprise to me. We came as this huge surprise to me. And I was absolutely terrified at losing you -- us. Please, can you give me one more chance? Please?",
        "Holden: How is she?",
        "Doctor: I ordered an MRI.",
        "Holden: To make sure it's not a concussion? But she's okay?",
        "Doctor: She'll be fine. And she wants to see you -- both of you.",

        "Damian: Luciano, you're my son, and I love you with all my heart. So, I need you to know that everything I did, right or wrong, I did out of love for you and your mother. I'm begging you only this, Luciano. Never forget how much I love you both.",
        "Luke: You're acting like I'm never going to see you again.",
        "Damian: Listen, I need you to hear me. This is what I want you to remember. Keep it in your mind and in your heart when you hear what they say about me. Remember, just this is true.",

        "Molly: There's a pitcher of water. Can I get you a glass?",
        "Lily: No. But you can tell me why Holden is so angry at you.",

        "Luke: At Damian's office.",
        "Holden: Is he there?",

        "Luke: Yes.",
        "Holden: So you saw him?",
        "Luke: Yeah. He -- he just left. He said that he needed to see me, so I came. He was packing a bag. Dad, I think he's running away from something. He had his passport, his visa. He told me that he wasn't going to see me for a long time and that he loved me and mom. Do you have any idea what's going on?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, I do, but I can't get into it on the phone. Listen, you need to get over to the hospital and be with your mother.",
        "Luke: What? Is she okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, she's fine. You know what? When it's all over, I'll tell you everything that happened.",
        "Luke: Okay. I'm on my way.",
        "Holden: Luke, did Damian tell you how he's planning on leaving the country?",
        "Luke: He said something about a freighter.",
        "Holden: Okay, listen. Your mom's here at the hospital, on the fourth floor. I'll, uh -- I'll talk to you later.",

        "Reid: Never heard that one before.",
        "Noah: Sorry.",
        "Reid: No, it's good. You're going to need that sick sense of humor during your post-op recovery phase.",
        "Noah: Wait. Does that mean you're going to operate?",
        "Reid: I'm cautiously optimistic that I can reverse your condition.",
        "Noah: Oh, my God.",
        "Reid: Noah, I need you to listen to me. I'm going to have to come up with some therapy protocols. I'm not going to go any further with this unless I can do that. And even then, I need you to be prepared to be let down, because I'm not guaranteeing anything with or without the surgery. You got it?",
        "Noah: I do. I really do.",
        "Reid: There's something else that has to be in place if I'm going to agree to do this, and it's a deal breaker.",
        "Noah: Name it.",
        "Reid: Keep Mr. Snyder out of my orbit. Deal?",

        "Katie: Exactly. Jacob's been sleeping all afternoon. I went to a new doctor who gave him antibiotics.",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "Katie: So he's sleeping. I got back from work, mulled some cider, and fixed the fridge.",
        "Henry: That's a full day.",

        "Henry: I talked to my sister.",

        "Henry: She's as wise as an owl. In fact, uh, she told me about something that I should do that might help you.",

        "Henry: Give me your foot. Give me your foot. Come on.",
        "[Katie moans]",
        "Henry: You know, I like sisters. I really do. I -- they're important. I like most of my sisters and, uh, I like Margo, too, even though she's arrested me so many times. Sisters should be close.",
        "Katie: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Henry: Yeah. But, uh, roommates as adults? I mean, it's a little too close, don't you think?",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Henry: I mean, uh -- I mean, take this, for example, this foot massage. I mean, a sister would -- would never do this on demand. She wouldn't even offer it.",
        "Katie: You're right. This one, too.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah. That's why I think you need someone a little -- little more -- a little less related.",
        "Katie: More disinterested?",
        "Henry: Yes. More -- no, no, no. Not disinterested. More, um, more caring, more loving, more, uh -- more doting.",
        "Katie: Ooh.",
        "Henry: Someone, uh, who could, uh, take care of Jacob.",
        "Katie: Totally.",
        "Henry: Yes. Take care of him when he's sick, when he's not sick.",
        "Katie: Oh, exactly.",

        "Noah: Is she okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, I think so. Did you find Dr. Oliver?",
        "Noah: Yeah. I found him, all right.",
        "Luke: That bad, huh?",
        "Noah: It's that good. He said as long as the therapy progresses, he might actually go through with the surgery on me.",
        "Luke: He said all that?",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "Luke: Oh, Noah, I'm so happy for you! Let me go check on my mom, and -- and then we -- I'll drive you home.",
        "Noah: I'm actually going to go with Maddie.",

        "Noah: No, I can't, and, um, you're going to have to get used to that.",

        "Lily: Let me get this straight. You went to Chicago to get the information that you got on Damian. When you had it, you decided to keep it to yourself?",
        "Molly: Yeah, pretty much.",
        "Lily: Why? What changed your mind?",
        "Molly: Damian, okay? He convinced me that the truth would keep me from being with Holden, and I bought it. I know. Idiotic.",
        "Lily: Molly, I spent months living with Damian, who lied to me about everything, and I didn't pick up on it. I'm not going to judge you for falling victim to his manipulations. You, me, Meg -- we all did.",
        "Molly: Well, it's disgusting.",
        "Lily: Why are you insecure about Holden's feelings for you?",
        "Molly: You don't know? You're going to make me say this? Damian says if you were free, that Holden would go running to you. And I was afraid that if Holden knew that I kept the truth from him, even for one day, that he would go running to you, anyway. Guess what? I was right. That's exactly what he did.",
