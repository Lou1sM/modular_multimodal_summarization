        "Lily: You're not starting story hour without me, are you?",
        "Emma: No, we just started --",
        "Faith: Mommy!",
        "Lily: Good. 'Cause I went to and I got some ice cream -- hot fudge sundaes, you're favorite.",
        "Emma: Yum, yum, yum.",
        "Holden: So you were at the store?",
        "Lily: That's where they have the ice cream.",
        "Emma: Why don't we just take that out into the kitchen for you?",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Emma: Can you get that, Luke?",
        "Lily: How about you guys get the big soda cups, okay? We'll make hot fudge sundaes. I did not forget the cherries. And when we get back, I'll make sure I takeover for story time from grandma.",
        "Emma: Okay.",
        "Lily: It's gonna be a lot of fun. Okay? I'll be there in a minute. Soon as I take off my coat.",
        "Emma: Let's go, let's go, let's go.",
        "Holden: Ice cream? Good idea.",
        "Lily: I haven't had that many good ideas lately so I figured it was time for us to have a little fun.",
        "Holden: That's for sure.",
        "Lily: What's wrong?",
        "Holden: Lucinda was here. I know about the woman, Lily. I know that you paid her money. And I know that it's about Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Ugh, I hate my smile.",
        "Barbara: Oh, it's perfect --",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, so were the other seven proofs you had tossed out.",
        "Barbara: Hey, hey, hey, a woman can't be too fussy about her image you know.",
        "Jennifer: Now you wonder where I get it from.",
        "Barbara: All right, all right. Nothing is gonna stop me from being in the perfect mood today. And when Will sees this picture, he knows that his family will come back together again.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe we could get a picture of Parker and Daniel too?",
        "Barbara: Honey, don't be ridiculous.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, they are his brothers.",
        "Barbara: Parker, yes, I will give you that. But, you know, Will has been closest to us, always.",
        "Paul: I'll talk to Hal about it in a few of weeks.",
        "Barbara: Oh, you know what? That's a great idea. That's a great idea. I will call Hal, and we'll see if maybe if he'll --",
        "Paul: No, no, no. Forget it, forget it.",
        "Barbara: -- Bring the picture over to Will.",
        "Paul: Forget that, no. There is no way I'm dragging Hal into the middle of this.",

        "Jack: It was beautiful.",

        "Carly: Perfect for Rose.",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Carly: You need a little something to feed the fire, Jack?",
        "Jack: No, absolutely not. This is going in your portfolio, honey.",
        "Carly: Oh, you mean that Dusty old leather thing in the closet upstairs?",
        "Jack: No, I mean the one full of beautiful designs.",
        "Carly: You say it without bias.",
        "Jack: You're damn right I'm biased. I'm madly in love with the most talented designer this side of Seventh Avenue.",
        "Carly: Or the most cursed.",
        "Jack: Because of Rose?",
        "Carly: Look at the facts, Jack. Every time I try to jump-start my career, I've either ended up kidnapped or partnered up with Craig Montgomery, or on the wrong end of Barbara Ryan's scissors. But to have a dear friend of mine die wearing a gown that I designed, that's -- that's too much, even for me, you know? No, no. I'm fine. I'm just gonna go check on the children.",

        "Mike: Are you serious? You could've been killed.",
        "Katie: Do you think you can get a hold of your contact tonight?",
        "Mike: Who's this contact?",
        "Simon: Yeah, I'll try.",
        "Mike: This is stupid!",

        "Mike: What's wrong? What's wrong? What's the matter?",
        "Katie: It's my ankle. I think I sprained it.",
        "Mike: You got to see a doctor.",
        "Simon: No! No hospitals.",
        "Mike: Dude, she's hurt.",
        "Katie: No, it's fine. It's not that bad.",
        "Simon: If it's serious, she can see someone, okay?",
        "Mike: Let me see your ankle. Let me see your ankle.",
        "Katie: No, no, we don't have time.",
        "Simon: Fine, I'll carry her out.",

        "[Sirens sound]",
        "Simon: All right, look, grab -- grab her other arm. Let's get out of here before the cops come.",

        "Simon: Let's get this shoe off.",
        "Mike: All right, careful.",
        "Simon: Is this your place?",
        "Mike: Yeah, when the roof's not caved in.",
        "Simon: Thanks.",
        "Mike: I'm not doing it for you.",
        "Simon: Listen, we'll stay here until we get those papers.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Mike: She can't walk. I mean, how long before this place gets shot up, too? I mean, is this how you take care of her? Is this the life you want for someone you're supposed to love?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Finally, after all these years, you and my mother agree on something. Comparing notes about poor, desperate Lily.",
        "Holden: No, that's not it. She's worried about you. So am I.",
        "Lily: Worrying is one thing. Demanding that I stop grieving for Rose is something else.",
        "Holden: Lily, I want you to grieve, okay? We all need to grieve together, as a family. The kids need it, I need it.",
        "Lily: What about me? What about what I need? And knowing what that is and not needing your approval, or my mother's.",
        "Holden: So you've decided you need what? A fraud? Lily, explain it to me. I mean, what does this woman do? Does she channel Rose? Does she summon her up from the grave? Come on. I mean, it's the oldest con in the book. Rose would tell you that herself. Lily, everything you need to heal is right here in this house.",
        "Lily: This woman knows things.",
        "Holden: She's in the business to know things.",
        "Lily: I don't completely trust her, but it's not hurting anybody for me to just give it a chance.",
        "Holden: Yes, it is. You're hurting yourself.",
        "Lily: Let's just set the record straight. The woman did not ask me for one dime. I demanded that she take the money. You know, I wouldn't expect you to understand this.",
        "Emma: Okay. Okie-dokey-dokey. Here's my little ice cream sundae. Here you are.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you.",
        "Emma: Everything's set up out there.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Emma: Here you go, baby. I'm gonna head out back to the farm.",
        "Lily: Oh, okay.",
        "Holden: Mom, are you sure that you can't stay for a little while?",
        "Emma: No, no, sweetheart. I have to get up early tomorrow. Goodness. Feed those chickens, you know. Okay, I'll call you -- call you in the morning.",
        "Lily: Okay, thanks, Emma.",
        "Emma: Night-night.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Emma: Bye. Everything's on the counter. The ice cream's in the freezer. Bye- bye.",
        "Lily: Bye-bye.",
        "Holden: Lily, I need to --",
        "Lily: Bye-bye.",
        "Holden: -- Run out and take care of a few things.",
        "Lily: Where are you going?",
        "Holden: I got to head over to the vet's.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Holden: I ordered some things, and I need to pick 'em up. You guys gonna be okay?",
        "Lily: Yes, of course. We'll be fine.",
        "Holden: Okay. I won't be long.",
        "Luke: Ready, Mom?",
        "Lily: Um -- you know, you can have ice cream every single night. How about we go on a real adventure?",
        "Luke: What kind of adventure?",
        "Lily: You got put your boots on and your coat to find out.",
        "Luke: But we're ready for bed.",
        "Lily: That's why you have to put your coat on. Come on. There's a friend that I want you to meet. Come on, come on, come on. Move along, slow pokes. You know, we got to move fast, because Daddy's gonna be home soon. He can't come home to an empty house. Come on.",

        "Jack: You know, some of these look new.",
        "Carly: They are. I was just fooling around.",
        "Jack: Did Lucy model?",
        "Carly: Nope.",
        "Jack: This sketch kinda looks like her.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I was just trying to come up with the next hot new line, and she came to mind.",
        "Jack: All right, so what do you do about it?",
        "Carly: I was just daydreaming.",
        "Jack: Honey, I never expected you to do laundry and watch the kids as a full- time career.",
        "Carly: But it is.",
        "Jack: That's not what I mean.",
        "Carly: I don't want you to think that this family isn't enough for me. 'Cause it is. I just get ideas, and I grab my pencils, and I put them on paper before I lose 'em.",
        "Jack: Well, that's great.",
        "Carly: Yeah, until Sage starts to cry, or Parker needs to be picked up from preschool.",
        "Jack: And your career goes straight to the back burner.",
        "Carly: Which is okay -- most days.",
        "Jack: What about the other days?",
        "Carly: Hmm. The other days I track down suspected murderers, harass innocent people.",
        "Jack: Like Mitzi?",
        "Carly: I said \"innocent,\" Jack. Mitzi has it bad for you.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: I got to tell you, I like this jealous streak.",
        "Carly: I just want to feel like I'm making a difference.",
        "Jack: Hey, you do make a difference.",
        "Carly: I know, I know, I do here. But I can't help feeling that there's something else out there for me.",
        "Jack: Then reach for it.",
        "Carly: Reach for it. What if I reach too far and fall flat on my face again?",
        "Jack: That will never happen. 'Cause I'll always be here to catch you. Hey -- I want you to live your dreams, Carly. All your dreams.",
        "Carly: Well, that sounds great in theory, Jack. But we both know what it takes to make it. I know there are plenty of women who have it all. I'm just not sure that I can be one of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Put this thing back in its holster.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Jennifer: I don't think Dad would mind coming.",
        "Paul: Do you really think that photograph is gonna impress Hal? If I'm him, no. And nobody wants Will believing anything that isn't absolutely true.",
        "Barbara: It will be true.",
        "Paul: Hopefully, one day.",
        "Blaine: Ms. Ryan, thank goodness I found you.",
        "Barbara: Blaine, what's wrong?",
        "Blaine: I've been calling your cell phone all day.",
        "Barbara: Well, I -- I don't take any business calls today, honey.",
        "Blaine: Well, Darton and Row is cutting their business in half.",
        "Barbara: What? They can't do that. We have a contract with them. Did you speak to the buyer?",
        "Blaine: She says it's out of her hands.",
        "Barbara: We need that revenue.",
        "Blaine: She also says she's been calling you all week. She left messages --",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, no. I haven't received any urgent messages.",
        "Paul: Okay, settle down.",
        "Barbara: Darton and Row is my biggest client. I can't do this without them. I need their revenue.",
        "Jennifer: You said you do have a contract with them?",
        "Barbara: Of course I have a contract, but if all of a sudden my products are not selling and they do some kind of creative accounting --",
        "Jennifer: Do you think it might be the publicity?",
        "Barbara: I don't know.",
        "Jennifer: You could sue.",
        "Barbara: Honey, if I do that, I won't get back in that store.",
        "Paul: Okay, B.R.O. Is not my problem any more, but I think I have a little idea that might help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Maybe we shouldn't stay here.",
        "Mike: She can't even walk.",
        "Simon: I'll find a place.",
        "Mike: Where?",
        "Katie: Simon, we can't go anywhere without our papers.",
        "Mike: Who is this contract? What kind of papers? I mean, is it legit?",
        "Simon: Just stay out of it. Okay? We really should get this ankle wrapped.",
        "Katie: Okay. The bandages are under the sink.",
        "Mike: I'll get some ice. Why don't we start a fire. She's probably freezing.",
        "Katie: The ice pack is at the top of your closet in that box. I kind of know my way around since Mike's accident.",
        "Simon: What accident?",
        "Katie: It's a long story, but I just stayed here to help him get his strength back.",
        "Simon: Really?",
        "Katie: It's not like we were living together. I was basically his nurse.",
        "Simon: Look, it doesn't matter. I can't control what's already gone. I can only control the future. Mike can light his own damn fire. I'm gonna go see about those papers.",
        "Katie: Wait, Simon, don't. Don't go, not like this.",
        "Simon: We can't stay in the one place for too long. God, I wish we could just go back to our cottage, you know? I wish I was building a fire in our own home d all this was behind us.",
        "Katie: I know you do. I know.",
        "Simon: Katie, you got to tell me -- if this is where you want to be, then maybe I should leave --",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Simon: -- Alone.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. I don't ever want to lose you again. Please, don't go.",
        "Simon: You've got to be sure. No doubts. No looking back.",
        "Katie: I'm sure.",
        "Simon: Then I'll go make the arrangements. I won't be long.",
        "Katie: Okay, be careful.",
        "Simon: I'll come back for you.",
        "Mike: Where's Simon?",
        "Katie: He went to meet with that guy.",
        "Mike: I'll start a fire for you after I wrap your ankle. Let me see it.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Mike: Stop thanking me.",
        "Katie: I meant for letting us stay here.",
        "Mike: Sorry.",
        "Katie: It's okay.",
        "Mike: All right, it's still a little swollen. But I don't think it's broken. It's gonna sting a little bit, okay?",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Mike: Did he say when he'd be back?",
        "Katie: I didn't ask.",
        "Mike: Look, Katie, I'm a pretty simple guy. You know, I just -- want simple things out of life. And some people might think that's boring to spend the rest of their life with the one person that they love most in this world, you know, just doing simple things, like having kids -- paying bills, you know, or fixing up your home. I know that's not living on the run, it's not, you know, life undercover. Maybe that's not your idea of living. I don't know. I thought it was. You know, but maybe I was wrong. Obviously I was wrong about a lot of things.",
        "Katie: No, you weren't wrong, Mike.",
        "Mike: It's just; I wanted all those things with you. I just -- you have no idea how much I love you.",
        "Katie: I do.",
        "Mike: No, you don't. No, you don't, or you wouldn't be doing this. If you knew how much I loved you, if you knew how far I would go to make you happy, you'd tell Simon to get out of your life right now so we can move on with ours.",

        "Barbara: Kaitlyn, Kaitlyn.",
        "Paul: Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn Bishop.",
        "Barbara: Kaitlyn.",
        "Paul: You go up to New York. You take her out to lunch. You go over B.R.O.'s track record with D&R. You sell her a future. You sell her the idea of profits.",
        "Barbara: Hmm. You know what would be even better? You making the pitch.",
        "Paul: Oh, you've got to be kidding .",
        "Barbara: No, no. I am absolutely serious. You want to prove to Hal that this picture is not a lie? Then you prove it to me first. Come back to B.R.O. Let's be a team again.",

        "Jack: Kids asleep?",
        "Carly: Finally.",
        "Jack: You know, what I think you need is a little inspiration. So I have a few ideas for a new design.",
        "Carly: Oh, you do, do you?",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Does it involve holsters?",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: It can. It's sort of a -- a \"less is more\" concept.",

        "Jack: Do you? Maybe I should -- I should show you.",
        "Carly: Why don't ya?",

        "Holden: No.",
        "Jack: Aaron?",
        "Holden: It's Lily. I -- don't know what to do. She's doing things. She's saying things -- it's like something inside of her died, along with Rose. She's just not herself. I had nowhere else to go, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I'm glad you came to see me. Come on. Come on. Tell me all about it.",
        "Holden: I think that she might be seeing a psychic.",
        "Jack: Seriously?",
        "Holden: Lucinda said she saw her with this woman at the Roller Palace. She paid her for something.",
        "Jack: For what?",
        "Holden: Lily said that she knows things -- whatever that means. I'm guessing that maybe she told Lily that she could contact Rose.",
        "Jack: You have a name?",
        "Holden: Yeah, Serafin. Lois Serafin.",
        "Jack: And you definitely think that this woman is a grifter?",
        "Holden: Um -- I'm almost positive. You know, Lily, she's vulnerable. She's wealthy. This woman just happens to come onto the scene at the worst possible time of her life and says that she know things about Rose.",
        "Jack: All right. Okay. I'll check things out; see if she has any priors. And if she's playing a con --",
        "Holden: If she is, I want you to run her out of town, Jack. I want you to get her as far away from my family as you can.",

        "Katie: I do.",
        "Mike: Then how could you leave? He's asking you to live life like a stranger. What, are you gonna have, like, fake names? You don't deserve that. You deserve to have a life that you want, you know, in a home that belongs to you. And he cannot give you that. He cannot love you the way that you need to be loved.",
        "Katie: Yes, he can. He can, Mike.",

        "Barbara: Okay. I will honestly try to keep a healthy emotional distance. All right? In the meantime, go to New York. Talk to Kaitlyn Bishop, please. Get D&R back in our camp. Come on. Just test drive the idea a little bit. I'll talk to Blaine, get you all set up with tickets to go to New York in the morning, all right?",
