        "Brad: Chicken.",
        "Jack: She flew out into the yard as I was coming in. I take it you didn't notice.",
        "Vienna: Well, at least she's out of the house.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Thanks for your help with everything. I'm gonna go and have a bath.",

        "Jack: Oh, so you're actually doing farm work, then?",
        "Brad: Oh, what are you getting all twisted about?",
        "Jack: I thought you were going to help out a little more with the chores, Brad. Taking care of the stock, doing repairs. You know, it's bad enough that every time I come in here you're sitting on your duff. And now you've decided to take up rolling around with Vienna?",
        "Brad: You got a problem with that?",
        "Jack: Yeah!",
        "Brad: Why? Why, because you wish Vienna was rolling around with you?",

        "Faith: Having a snack?",
        "Lily: No. We're having company. Holden!",

        "Susan: I'm here to see my grandson before he heads off to boarding school, if you don't mind.",
        "Emily: What, did Tom call you?",
        "Susan: No, Daniel called me. Why, are you angry?",
        "Emily: Angry? Tom announces that he's decided to send my child off to boarding school without a warning? Yeah, I'm a little angry.",
        "Susan: Honey, Honey. You know Daniel hasn't been himself since the kidnapping. He can't sleep, he can't concentrate.",
        "Emily: Mom, he just needs time.",
        "Susan: You've been worried about him yourself.",
        "Emily: I don't want him to go! He's my son. I can't go months without seeing him.",
        "Susan: But if it's best for Daniel --",
        "Emily: So what? Who knows what's best? You? Tom?",
        "Susan: I think you do.",
        "Emily: Yeah. I just don't know if I can go through with it.",

        "Casey: I've got to catch up to him and tell him.",
        "Adam: Tell him what?",
        "Casey: That I'm the one who messed up. I took those bonds.",
        "Adam: What?",
        "Casey: Yeah. I followed Will to Crash. He locked up like he said. He set the alarm. And then I went in there and turned the alarm off, took the bonds and trashed the place.",
        "Adam: Why?",
        "Casey: To cover my gambling debts.",
        "Adam: Oh, Man.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know, I know. I can't believe I did this. But I did. I can't believe I messed this up for Gwen. The demo, the record exec, everything. Now I've got to go and tell him.",
        "Adam: You're not going anywhere.",
        "Casey: I've got to tell them.",
        "Adam: You owe people, Casey. Way more than you owe Will and Gwen.",

        "[Banging]",
        "Gwen: Who's there?",
        "[Iris looks around to see where to put the bond and drops it on the floor by the bedroom and hides there when she sees Gwen and than sneaks out the door]",
        "Gwen: It's probably just a mouse. Just a stupid, stupid mouse.",
        "[Gwen screams]",
        "Will: What's wrong?",
        "Gwen: You scared me.",
        "Will: You scared me. You okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I think we have a mouse. I want you to get rid of it.",
        "[Gwen chuckles]",
        "Will: Okay. What do you want me to do?",
        "Gwen: Catch it, and take it into the woods and humanely release it.",
        "Will: All right. I'll get one of those be nice to mouse traps when we leave. Are you ready to go?",
        "Gwen: You want to go already?",
        "Will: Yeah. You said you wanted to register for classes.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you know, I don't know. I mean, I wish I was really excited about going back to school, you know, at least get my mind off of other stuff.",
        "Will: That's not happening, huh?",
        "Gwen: No. I can't really get my head to stop. I mean, for months, my whole life was about music and rehearsing and recording - - it's over now.",
        "Will: I'm sorry.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. I told myself I wouldn't put you through this. It's not your fault.",
        "Will: I'm the one who lost the bonds.",
        "Gwen: You didn't -- you didn't loose them. Just forget that I said anything. You're right. I should go back to school.",
        "Will: No. Take some time, veg out a little bit, wait for some inspiration.",
        "Gwen: I love you. I love you so much.",
        "Will: I love you, too. It's freezing in here.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I was going to make a fire. I thought we could make popcorn, get cozy.",
        "Will: I like where your head's at. But you know what, we need more wood.",
        "Gwen: I am going to come with you.",
        "Will: Why, are you scared of a little mouse?",
        "Gwen: Yep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: You think this is about money? I went out on a limb to cover for you, Casey. Lent you over $1,000, I didn't tell anybody, and all because you promised you'd quit gambling.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and I tried to stop. But I couldn't. I kept getting sucked back in.",
        "Adam: You think this is coming clean? You gamble because you like it. And if you'd won instead of lost, you wouldn't be itching to tell anybody anything. Not me, not Will and not Gwen.",
        "Casey: Okay, yeah, you're right. I went off the deep end a little bit. I already tried to get it under control, and I couldn't. And then I took Mom's money.",
        "Adam: No, you stole it, you mean.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but I was gonna tell her. And I'm still gonna tell her. I just need to tell Will and Gwen first.",
        "Adam: Would you just wait a minute? What do you think is going to happen when you tell Mom and Tom this, huh? He just had a heart attack.",
        "Casey: I know!",
        "Adam: A heart attack brought on by stress, Casey. What do you think this will do to him?",
        "Casey: I don't know! I don't know what to do. I know I don't want to stress them out any more, but I've got to tell them.",
        "Adam: Well actually, no, you don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: You two coming in, or are you gonna stand out here all day?",
        "Susan: We'll be right there. You're a good mom. You'll do the right thing. Hey, Tom. How are you doing?",
        "Tom: I'm okay. I think the heart attack was harder on everybody else, actually. Em? This is important to Daniel. He wants to do this.",
        "Emily: Is he up in his room?",
        "Tom: Yeah. Hey, Daniel! Your mom and Grandma are here.",
        "Daniel: Grandma!",
        "Susan: Hey. Hi, Sweetheart!",
        "Daniel: Hi.",
        "Susan: I hear you're all excited about that new school you're going to.",
        "Daniel: Yeah, yeah! They got cool dorms. And lacrosse team and a hockey team and even a rugby team!",
        "Emily: Oh, rugby? Wow. I didn't know that. How about a hug for your mom?",
        "Daniel: Hi, Mom.",
        "Emily: Hey, Honey. Oh, you. So, you all packed?",
        "Daniel: Almost.",
        "Emily: Great. I was thinking, maybe instead of Margo and Tom driving you to school, I can take you?",
        "Daniel: I don't know.",
        "Tom: I don't think that's a good idea, Emily.",
        "Emily: Why not? Why not? I think it's a great idea. We could spend some time together. And I'll take you to all those greasy spoon truck stops. And then when we get to your school, you could show me your room and I could help you get everything ready.",
        "Tom: You know, why don't you do it some other time? There'll be a parents' weekend coming up.",
        "Emily: No, I want to be with my son now. What's wrong with that? Were you trying to keep me from him?",
        "Tom: No, I'm not.",
        "Susan: Tom, why don't we go in the other room and give these two some time alone, okay?",
        "Tom: Sure.",
        "Emily: Hey, sit down. I want to chat with. So, this school thing. It was quite a surprise, huh? Your daddy said that it was your idea. You would tell me if it wasn't, right? You would tell me? Daniel, I know you were so scared when that man tried to take you. I was scared, too. But I promise -- I promise that you're safe. And you got Margo in charge of all those detectives. And they'll protect you. And Daddy will always protect you. And I will always protect you.",
        "Daniel: I know.",
        "Emily: So then why do you have to go away? I know Grandma's house is small and it's not fun to have friends over or anything. So I was thinking, maybe we could get a house of our own, just the two of us. In a new neighborhood with lots of kids. Would you like that?",
        "Daniel: I guess.",
        "Emily: And see, then you wouldn't have to go away. Because Daniel, I don't want to lose you. I'm sorry, but if there's anything I can do to make you stay, anything at all --",
        "Daniel: Mom \u0096 Mom, don't cry. If you don't want me to go, I won't go.",
        "Emily: Oh, God, Daniel, thank you. Thank you.",

        "Faith: We're having company.",
        "Luke: Mmm. These are good.",
        "Lily: Hey, hey, hey. No, no. Those are for guests.",

        "Lily: Couple --",
        "Luke: Who's coming?",
        "Lily: Brad's coming. Brad, Jack and the kids. How was school?",
        "Luke: Mom, you've got to stop doing that.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Luke: Asking me about school like you're expecting me to say that I got beat up by a bunch of gay bashers between fourth and fifth period.",
        "Lily: I just worry about you. If someone gives you a hard time --",
        "Luke: You will be the first to know.",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Luke: No. I'm just trying to make you feel better. Hey, call me when dinner's ready.",
        "Lily: Okay, okay. Teenage boys have a very interesting interpretation of a couple. The plate is practically empty.",
        "Faith: At least you have time to make some more.",
        "Lily: Yes, that's true. Want to help me?",
        "Faith: You're the one who's all into food. Not me.",
        "Lily: Okay, I know you might be a little moody --we all have our bad days. But you don't have to be rude.",
        "Faith: Sorry.",
        "Lily: Okay.",

        "Jack: This is not about Vienna, Brad. I got a lot on my plate right now.",
        "Brad: I get that.",
        "Jack: And I do want to thank you for cleaning up the kitchen. I really do appreciate that.",
        "Brad: Well, Vienna did most of the work. But I supervised.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I bet you did.",
        "Brad: So are you into her or what? What am I saying? Of course you're into her. She is so hot. It's freaking me out.",
        "Jack: You know what your problem is? You just talk too much. Seriously.",
        "Brad: Come on, I've been gone for years, Man. I thought you'd miss me.",
        "Jack: Think again.",
        "Brad: So how are we gonna work this out? I mean, it's obvious that she wants me -- [Jack scoffs] I know you're in a bad place right now, so if you want -- I could back off.",
        "Jack: Would you just shut up about Vienna? Please just shut up!",
        "Brad: Why are you so sensitive?",
        "Jack: For one thing, she's Emma's guest, not some toy we picked up for your amusement.",
        "Brad: Okay, if you don't make a move on her, I -- okay, I know, I know, I know. You're afraid of getting rejected.",
        "Jack: No, the one thing I'm afraid of is that my kids might walk in on something that should not be happening on the kitchen floor!",
        "Brad: The kids weren't here.",
        "Jack: They could have been. That's what I'm saying. You gotta start using your head.",
        "Holden: Hey, hey. What's going on?",
        "Brad: Instant replay. Jack and I are into the same woman.",
        "Jack: This is not about a woman. It's about the fact that my brother has the mind of a 12-year-old.",
        "Brad: Jack can't take a joke anymore, you notice that?",
        "Holden: Maybe you should tone it down, then.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. All right, I am sorry. It's just talk. You know me. Come on.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, too. I guess when Carly left, my sense of humor left with her. What's up?",
        "Holden: Dinner. Lily wanted me to invite you guys over. The kids, too. Where are they?",
        "Jack: J.J.'s at basketball practice, Parker's studying with a friend, Sage is at a play date.",
        "Brad: I don't know how you keep all that straight.",
        "Jack: I'm their father, Brad. I was just gonna have dinner here.",
        "Holden: Well, put that away for some other time. Lily will be pretty upset if you guys don't come. I was supposed to invite you earlier and I forgot.",
        "Brad: I never turn down a free meal. Do I have time to get cleaned up?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Just come over when you're ready.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Holden: Tell the kids what's going on.",
        "Jack: Yeah, all right, you're on.",
        "Brad: Hey, you know what, Man? I'll take care of this. You've been working all day. Go have a beer, relax.",
        "Jack: Thanks, Brad. Appreciate it. I'll see you later.",
        "Holden: Got it. Do me a favor. Can you try to keep things civil tonight?",
        "Brad: Sure, Man. There's nothing to fight about, right? Wow, wow. Where are you going?",
        "Vienna: Just here. I like to look good.",
        "Brad: I like what you like.",
        "Vienna: So I see. Making a salad?",
        "Brad: I was. But then I got invited to Lily and Holden's for dinner.",

        "Emily: You don't want to go?",
        "Daniel: Not if you don't want me to.",
        "Emily: No, I don't want you to go. I want you to stay around me at least until you're 115 years old. Maybe older. But that wouldn't be very good, would it? You'd be this rickety old man who never learned to play rugby, living with your mother, and that would be --",
        "Daniel: Gross.",
        "Emily: Yeah, that would be gross. So you know what I want? I want you to go away to that school and learn great things and meet great friends. And promise to call me once a week.",
        "Daniel: Okay.",
        "Emily: Where are you going?",
        "Daniel: I printed this out for you. It's a picture of my school and the phone number in case you want to call me if you get sad.",
        "Emily: Come here. You know what? Whenever I think of you, I'm going to be the opposite of sad, okay? I love you. Go to your grandma, okay, and your daddy. Tell them to come back in.",
        "Daniel: Okay.",
        "Tom: Right, all set? So, why don't you run upstairs and finish packing.",

        "Tom: I didn't mean that to sound like --",
        "Emily: No, you make me sound like you're giving me a medal for being mother of the year?",
        "Tom: I know you love him.",
        "Emily: You know something, that's not why I did it. I didn't do it because it's the right thing or it's a good thing. I didn't even do it because I love him. I did it because that child loves me. And I never want that to change.",

        "Adam: You're my little brother. I've been looking out for you my whole life. I can't stop now.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but you can't give them the money back. It's already gone.",

        "Casey: All right. Thanks, Adam.",
        "Adam: Yeah. You know, we're doing this for the right reason, you know? We don't want Tom back in the hospital.",

        "Gwen: Uh-huh. Ah, sneaky. Very sneaky. You build the fire while I put this stuff away.",

        "Will: Yeah?",
        "Gwen: What is this?",
        "Will: It looks like one of the bonds my mom gave me. Where'd it come from?",
        "Gwen: It was -- it was right over here, like someone dropped it.",
        "Will: Well, how could that have happened? I don't understand this. I mean, maybe my mom came by --",
        "Gwen: Your mom hasn't been here, not with the bonds.",
        "Will: Well, we don't know that for sure.",
        "Gwen: I mean, why would she come by? I mean, how would she get in? Did you give her a key?",
        "Will: No. Okay, let me just -- let me think about this. I mean, I had the bonds and I took them to Crash, I locked them up. I never even had them here.",
        "Gwen: That's what I thought.",
        "Will: So where did this come from?",
        "Gwen: You're asking me?",
        "Will: No! I mean, I'm thinking out loud. This makes no sense, it's crazy. I just can't figure it out. It's like the person who stole them must have brought them --",
        "Gwen: What, brought them back here and then dropped one?",
        "Will: Well, I don't know, what do you think?",
        "Gwen: I don't know what to think. I mean, I don't understand how bonds that you supposedly never brought home --",
        "Will: What, supposedly?",
        "Gwen: You know, bonds that, you know, disappeared from Crash, suddenly ended up back in our house.",
        "Will: Are you accusing me of breaking into Crash and stealing my own money?",

        "Iris: Who's going to see us? Who's going to care?",
        "Adam: My brother was just here.",
        "Iris: Yeah? I saw him leave. What do you think I am, stupid?",
        "Adam: Did you get it done?",
        "Iris: Yeah, I got it done. Right now, little Gwennie's probably looking at that very expensive piece of paper and wondering if her good guy husband is really such a good guy after all.",
        "Adam: Nice to see a mother take such an interest in her daughter's happiness.",

        "Emily: Yeah, again. What is this? Like, the 4,000th second chance? I've had every opportunity to get my life back together, and I never do. You know, maybe I'm just not wired to be a good girl. Maybe -- [Cell phone rings] Hello? Oh, yeah, hi, Dusty. Yeah, sure, I'll meet you over there. Okay, okay, bye. It was Dusty. He wants me to meet him.",
        "Susan: What? What's up with you two?",
        "Emily: It's just business, business. Actually, maybe it's that opportunity you're talking about. So, can you do me a favor? Can you stay here in case Daniel needs something?",
        "Susan: Well, sure, but don't you think you should do that, too?",

        "Jack: You should have check with Lily first, though.",
        "Lily: Nope, I've got my water right over there. Thank you.",
        "Brad: Look, I'm sorry, Lily. I just didn't want to leave Vienna, you know, alone at the old farmhouse with nothing but a salad while we're up here on this hill, you know, all feasting like kings. Did you make those? Yeah, did you make those?",
        "Lily: Those? Yes, I did make those. Enjoy, have one.",
        "Brad: Can I? Oh, awesome.",
        "Lily: Of course, please.",

        "Brad: Terrific, terrific. I've been working down in North Carolina for the past few years.",
        "Lily: Oh, did you like that?",
        "Brad: Loved it. It was great. You know, it was a great company, upward mobility, you know? And they hated to lose me. But when I found out my bro here ran into some rough water, I decided to come back to Oakdale and lend him a hand.",
        "Lily: That's sweet.",

        "Holden: What was that?",
        "Brad: This hen got loose in the house, right, and it's running all over the place and probably thinking we're going to eat it for dinner. And Vienna trips, I fall on top of her, and you know, Jack walks in and thinks we're about to --",
        "Holden: Brad, Brad, Brad --",
        "Brad: Right. He totally jumps to conclusions, you know? And I'm not talking about chickens. Anyway, you know, that's my brother the cop. Always busy doing the right thing to have any fun.",

        "Brad: Thank you, Sweetheart. Okay, then there was this time that -- Jack and I -- [Brad laughs] Snuck into this racing competition. [Jack sighs] Oh, yeah. Remember that, remember that? But we were too young. But Jack could drive like a son of a -- Jack could drive like a son of a gun, and, you know, we were going to make a killing and split the profits.",
        "Jack: Yeah, what was the split on that again?",
        "Brad: 80-20.",
        "Jack: 80-20!",

        "Brad: Oh, thank you. This place looks different.",
        "Holden: Yeah, we had a fire and then we had to do a little redecorating.",
        "Brad: Did you do it yourself? Or did you get some queer type to do it?",
        "Lily: I beg your pardon?",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, no insult, the place, it looks great. I just figured that you maybe got someone who was, you know -- [In an effeminate voice] Fabulous with fabrics and colors.",
        "Holden: Brad -- the thing is --",
        "Lily: What you just said was completely offensive. If you're going to talk like that, I'd like you to leave my home.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm sure that Brad didn't mean it.",
        "Lily: Brad, I hope you're going to apologize, please?",
        "Brad: Okay, sure, yeah. If you want. But, I mean, what did I say that was so bad? I mean, do you have something against gay decorators?",

        "Tom: I just have to talk myself out of being depressed about it, because I'm going to miss him.",
        "Casey: Yeah, me, too. I mean, I know I don't hang out with him as much as I should, but it's going to be kind of weird not having him running around.",

        "Tom: Yeah. I know there's been a lot going on with you working at Crash, and with your brother, and trying to help Maddie get through that situation. A lot of responsibility. I guess not the -- party-hearty freshman year you expected, huh?",
        "Casey: I've learned a lot. I've messed up a lot too.",
        "Tom: Yeah, what did you mess up?",
        "Casey: I probably could have studied more.",
        "Tom: There's always next semester. Listen sometimes when you have a heart attack you feel the need to say certain things -- I'm not going to get too sappy on you. But, it's been really nice having you close to home. Knowing that I can count on you. You're a great young man. And I'm very, very proud of you.",

        "Will: Yeah, I want to spend time with you. I love you, you're my wife! And then you're disappointed, so I was trying to cheer you up. How does that become incriminating evidence against me?",

        "Will: Unless what? Unless I brought it here. Which makes no sense, at all? I went to the club and planted it there, and then I steal my own money, just so I can sabotage your career. Is that what you think of me?",
