        "Dusty hands Meg the fake passports and asks her to cut them up, but not the cash, before he changes his mind. Craig thinks Carly is giving Dusty too much credit and himself not enough. She says Johnny should not be made to feel that he is being abandoned by someone who loves him. Jack has one of those days when he feels like he is disappointing everyone \u0096 Janet by not getting the house they wanted and Parker and Liberty by not having $200 for Metallica tickets. Dusty explains to Johnny that although he won't always be with him, he will always be there for him. Now it's time to spend more time with his other daddy. He cries at the graveside of Jennifer, wishing he didn't have to give up on Johnny. Johnny wants to make brownies so Craig shows up at Carly's door with groceries and convinces her to help. Jack drops by to let her know that he doesn't need the second mortgage right now after all. When he sees Craig, he warns Carly that she will never learn. He apologies when he realizes the real reason that Craig is there and she in her robe. Janet realizes his problems with Craig is just Carly. Jack can't stand to see her with another man. Craig gives Parker a wad of money to buy toys for Johnny and in the process gives Parker money for himself so he can get the Metallica tickets. Jack doesn't like that Craig is throwing money at his son. Janet doesn't believe Craig is hurting anyone and Jack is just jealous that Craig has money and he doesn't. She states that she loves him, not what he can buy for her, that doesn't matter. Craig concedes he already is a lousy father since he let Johnny eat as many brownies as he wanted and now he is sick. Meg notices how Dusty is so attentive to Eliza."

        "Meg: Dusty, are you coming?",
        "Dusty: Take these.",
        "Meg: What are they?",
        "Dusty: They're fake passports for Johnny and me.",
        "Meg: When did you get these?",
        "Dusty: Take them and cut them up. Would you, please, before I change my mind? Would you? He's not here. Where is he?",
        "Meg: I called my mother from the courtroom to remind her that she promised to take Johnny riding.",
        "Dusty: You thought I'd take him and run.",
        "Meg: It's what I would do. Okay, there's more, right?",
        "Dusty: There's a briefcase in the trunk with a lot of cash. Don't cut up the cash.",
        "Meg: I'll put it somewhere safe. Is there anything else I should know about?",
        "Dusty: Like my gun? Don't worry. I won't kill Craig Montgomery -- today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, I would be good for him. Why can't you just believe in that?",
        "Carly: Because you are ignoring everything that boy has been through. You're acting like he some sort of prize that you have to hold on to, no matter what it costs him.",
        "Craig: What has he lost, Carly?",
        "Carly: A father who would sacrifice everything for him.",
        "Craig: Okay, now you're giving Dusty way too much credit. And me not enough. He's not the only person in the world who would give that child everything. I would, too.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, then give him a couple of days to say good-bye. Don't let Johnny think that he's being abandoned by someone who loves him.",
        "Craig: I love him. That's what he needs. I'm all he needs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You're just tense because you are sleep-deprived. Let me get you some coffee.",
        "Jack: I'd forgotten how much -- how much noise babies can make. Unbelievable.",
        "Janet: I know. But you know what? We are going to close on this house soon. And we will be moving out. In fact, Meg and Eliza will probably be moving out -- sorry -- sooner than that.",
        "Jack: I don't think that Meg will be moving out anytime soon. Dusty -- Dusty lost the custody suit.",
        "Janet: You're kidding! The judge gave Johnny to Craig?",
        "Jack: Proving that justice is not only blind but clearly insane.",
        "Janet: I can't believe it. And just think, here Craig was, thinking that he had to get married to get custody of Johnny.",
        "Jack: Thank God Carly didn't go through with that, and that my kids are safe.",
        "Janet: Yes, they are. So now, maybe you can stop worrying about your ex-wife and concentrate on your current one.",
        "Jack: My pleasure. Oh -- I love it when it vibrates like that! Snyder. Hey! Hi, Wendy.",
        "Janet: Our real estate agent Wendy? Tell her I said, \"Hi.\"",
        "Jack: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Janet --",
        "Janet: Hi, Wendy!",
        "Jack: Janet says, \"Hi.\" She says, \"Hi\" back. So, can you tell we've been anxiously awaiting your call?",
        "Janet: Tell her I found the perfect wallpaper for the kitchen.",
        "Jack: She found the -- she heard you, Honey.",
        "Janet: Okay, good.",
        "Jack: So did they -- did they accept our offer, or what? How much -- how much more money?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Johnny didn't want to stop riding, but they're headed back. We can walk down and meet them.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. What am I going to say to him?",
        "Meg: You'll figure it out.",
        "Dusty: Okay. Let's go see my kid ride a horse.",
        "Meg: You know, you could ride with him. We still have time.",
        "Craig: I'm here for my son.",
        "Dusty: You're early. I haven't had time to talk to Johnny yet.",
        "Meg: Johnny is out riding with my mother. He was having a good time, and we didn't want to interrupt him.",
        "Craig: Are you sure he's just out riding? Or do I have to call the police?",
        "Meg: They're going to be up any minute, Craig. Why don't you come in, and you could have a cup of coffee?",
        "Craig: Thank you. It seems your husband -- oh, right. You're not legally married, you two. Would fianc\u00e9 be the correct term?",
        "Meg: Craig, you have a lifetime with Johnny now. Why don't you give Dusty a few more days?",
        "Craig: Well, if Dusty wants more time with my son, he can ask me himself.",
        "Dusty: I'd appreciate it, if you'd give me more time with my son to ease him into this.",
        "Craig: Well, there you go. That wasn't so hard, was it? If you want more time with Johnny, you've got it.",
        "Meg: Well, thank you, Craig.",
        "Craig: How's five minutes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I thought you were going to wait for me after fourth period.",
        "Liberty: I did.",
        "Parker: I didn't see you.",
        "Liberty: Well, you were really busy.",
        "Parker: I was standing in the hall right next to your locker, just like I said I would be.",
        "Liberty: No, you were actually leaning against my locker hitting on Alice- Jane. Parker, I do not want to talk to you right now.",
        "Parker: Whoa, whoa, wait up.",
        "Liberty: Don't touch me, please. Like, let go.",
        "Parker: Okay, well, I was not hitting on her. But it's nice to know that you're jealous.",
        "Liberty: No, I'm not jealous, okay? What were you even talking to her about?",
        "Parker: Well, her cousin's a roadie with Metallica. And they're coming to Chicago tomorrow night.",
        "Liberty: You were not talking about Metallica with Alice-Jane, no way.",
        "Parker: She said she could get us some great seats. And I thought, \"Hey, my girlfriend might be excited.\" But since you're so hostile -- I guess not.",
        "Liberty: I'm not hostile. I can't believe you'd even say that. That's ridiculous. What are you doing? Who are you texting?",
        "Parker: You. You now have Alice-Jane's number. If you want tickets, call her yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So, when can we move in?",
        "Jack: I'm afraid someone outbid us for the house.",
        "Janet: What? Out of all the houses for sale in Oakdale, somebody has to pick ours?",
        "Jack: I know, I guess we're just that unlucky.",
        "Janet: Well, can we up the bid?",
        "Jack: We can, yeah.",
        "Janet: Good, because I think we can scrape together an extra $1,000. Right?",
        "Jack: Honey, it's -- it's gonna be a lot more than that. And I'm not sure it's worth it.",
        "Janet: Oh -- the bay windows? The walk-in closet, that really big, big, big bedroom, and the little path that leads straight to our front door -- it's so worth it. You turned them down, didn't you?",
        "Jack: I can call Wendy back, if you want me to.",
        "Janet: No. No, no, it's okay.",
        "Jack: Are you sure?",
        "Janet: It's okay -- yes. I mean -- we'll find something better. And cheaper.",
        "Jack: Definitely. Come here.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Jack: Oh, it's probably work. Yeah, I've got to take this. Snyder.",
        "Liberty: Mom.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Liberty: Hey. Hi.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Liberty: Hi. I need your help with something about Parker.",
        "Janet: What's going on?",
        "Liberty: Okay, well, I thought he was hitting on this girl, but it turns out he wasn't. He was actually doing something really nice for me, that I kind of dumped all over it. And now I really need $200.",
        "Janet: $200?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. But -- but come on, it's for the Metallica tickets. And you know it's worth it.",
        "Janet: I know they're worth it, but come on --",
        "Liberty: Oh, come on, Mom. Please? Promise, just -- please? Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Parker: Hey, I need a loan.",
        "Jack: Sure. How much?",
        "Parker: A couple of hundred dollars.",
        "Jack: A couple -- for what?",
        "Parker: The Metallica concert.",
        "Jack: Parker --",
        "Parker: These seats -- I mean, I'd be practically on the stage.",
        "Jack: $200 a ticket, though?",
        "Parker: No, no. It's for two tickets. I got a great deal because I know somebody. I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. It's in Chicago. And a bunch of kids from school are going.",
        "Jack: I assume you'd be -- you'd be taking a date, then.",
        "Parker: I haven't decided.",
        "Jack: I don't know about this, Parker. I really don't. You see --",
        "Janet: I think that Parker and Liberty should go together.",
        "Parker: I'd be okay with that.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, that works for me.",
        "Janet: Hey. Then, it's settled.",
        "Jack: Janet, we -- we can't afford this. Guys, we can't -- maybe the next time these guys go out on tour.",
        "Parker: But Dad, these seats -- I mean, I won't get a chance like this again.",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Your father's right. Guys, we just -- we can't swing it this time. I'm really sorry.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Liberty: Really? Okay. Yeah, no, it's fine. See you later.",
        "Janet: They'll get over it.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. You ever have one of those days where you feel like you're -- you're disappointing everyone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Why do you keep pushing it? Why are you making it so hard for him?",
        "Craig: Dusty has provoked me countless times. I'm just returning the favor.",
        "Meg: And then you ask me why I think you're an awful father.",
        "Craig: No, I'll be a terrific father, now that I have the opportunity. I'll listen to Johnny. I'll love him. We'll have fun together.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and you'll never allow him to love anybody else but you. To belong to anybody else but you.",
        "Craig: Well, if we're talking about being selfish with Johnny's love, Dusty is as guilty as I am.",
        "Meg: Dusty made a promise to Jennifer. Will you tell Johnny about his mother? Will you put a picture of her in his room? Will you let her family be a part of his life?",
        "Craig: Maybe.",
        "Meg: Yeah, that's right. As long as they don't antagonize you, right? Then, maybe you might give Johnny permission to get to know them?",
        "Craig: Would you want your enemies to spend unsupervised time with your child?",
        "Meg: You're never going to let Dusty see him again, are you? He delivered Johnny, he raised him.",
        "Craig: He's also gone out of his way to keep me from Johnny. Why should I bend over backwards for him?",
        "Meg: This isn't about Dusty! It's about Johnny.",
        "Craig: Johnny will have a beautiful new home. Good schools, good friends, everything that he could possibly want.",
        "Meg: Not everything, Craig.",
        "Craig: I can give him more than anyone else has ever given me. Including you. So frankly, I don't give a damn what you or Dusty think. Johnny is my son, and I'll make sure that he knows it.",
        "Dusty: You were great on that horse.",
        "Johnny: I want to do it again.",
        "Dusty: We will, we will. I promise. But first, I've got something special I want you to do for me, okay? I want you to spend some time with your other daddy. You guys have always had fun together, right? Well, now you get to sleep over at his big house. He's got a whole new set of toys just waiting for you. That sounds good, doesn't it?",
        "Johnny: Will you be there?",
        "Dusty: I'll always be there for you, Johnny. Even when I'm not around, even when you can't see me. I'll always love you. And I'll always be your dad.",
        "Craig: Hey, it's the world's greatest cowboy! You know what? I can't wait to show you all the things that are back at my place. In fact, look what I got. Hey! Well, you want to go see them? There's a lot more where that came from. Okay, let's go! Oh, boy! Here we go.",
        "Dusty: Craig. He -- you know, he doesn't have his things. Maybe I should go get some of his clothes.",
        "Craig: Pack them up. I'll send someone later. Okay, Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Finished putting together that crib.",
        "Meg: Oh, thank you for doing that. I am so lucky you are here.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, right. You can rebuild a tractor. But suddenly, you can't put together a crib. You're trying to keep me busy.",
        "Meg: Well, now I'm trying to keep you busy by eating lunch. They're sandwiches. Come on, even I can put some slices of turkey on bread.",
        "Dusty: I need my keys. I got to go.",
        "Meg: Where?",
        "Dusty: Wherever. Keys, please.",
        "Meg: You're not going after Craig, are you?",
        "Dusty: I told you I wouldn't.",
        "Meg: No, no, you said that you weren't going to kill him today. You could still beat him to a pulp today and then kill him tomorrow.",
        "Dusty: I could.",
        "Meg: Are you trying to worry me?",
        "Dusty: I'm trying not to lie to you. My keys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, what's the matter, Johnny? Don't you like burgers and fries? Well, then why aren't you chowing down? Do you want something else?",
        "Craig: I can't get him to eat.",
        "Janet: Oh, don't worry. He'll eat when he's hungry.",
        "Craig: He just got out of the hospital. I'm starting to get worried. He might be getting sick again.",
        "Janet: Well, he looks healthy to me.",
        "Craig: Do you have a medical degree hanging in the kitchen?",
        "Janet: You know what I do have, Johnny? In the kitchen, I've got spaghetti and meatballs, I've got alphabet soup, I've got cookies. I've got anything you want. What do you want?",
        "Johnny: I want to go home.",
        "Janet: Can't get any clearer than that.",
        "Craig: We've already been down this road. It's not my home he wants to go to.",
        "Janet: Oh. He's missing D-u-s-t-y?",
        "Craig: We'll be fine, thank you.",
        "Janet: Hey, why don't you just get D-u-s-t-y on the phone? Let him hear his voice. And he'll be chowing down in a flash.",
        "Craig: Don't you have coffee to pour somewhere?",
        "Janet: Just trying to help, man.",
        "Craig: I know. Let's play a game. Let's list all the things that we've done together. And then you can tell me which one of those you want to do right now. Okay? Go to the petting zoo? Go to a toy store? Ride the train in the park?",
        "Johnny: I want to make brownies.",
        "Janet: Do you want to make brownies, Johnny?",
        "Craig: Gee, if only I had a stove in my hotel room.",
        "Janet: Well, you know what? I think that maybe you could borrow Emma's stove at the Snyder farm.",
        "Craig: You know, there are several reasons why I am persona non grata at the Snyder farm, not the least of which is your husband.",
        "Janet: Oh, right, there's that. Gee, it's too bad you don't have any friends.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: Well, you know what? Maybe I don't have friends. But you do. Come on, let's blow this pop stand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I guess you know what happened today, Jennifer. Looks like I let you down. I have a question for you. Where were you when all this was happening? You gave me a mission to take care of our boy. And whatever you do, don't let Craig get him! I tried. I tried everything to keep him with me, and Craig got him. Where were you? With the angels, with God? Why didn't you help me? Why didn't you help our boy? Where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: We brought groceries.",
        "Carly: Hi, Johnny. Come on in. You, not so fast. I thought we had a fight?",
        "Craig: We did. And I'm still furious at you. At least I would be, if you didn't look so fetching. Getting ready for a hot date?",
        "Carly: I'm taking a shower, Craig. I'm going to go to work.",
        "Craig: Well, it's early still.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know it's early. I want to get there early 'cause -- why am I explaining myself to you? What is it you want?",
        "Craig: Well, I was hoping -- Johnny, Johnny. You see, we were hoping that you might want to make brownies with us.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, I'm busy.",
        "[Craig whispering]",
        "Craig: Please, please, help!",
        "Carly: Johnny, you want to make brownies? All right, well come on in here. Let's do it.",
        "Craig: Oh, boy, you are a lifesaver.",
        "Carly: Take off your coats, guys. You are a pain in the neck. You're just lucky that your little boy is so cute.",
        "Craig: Okay, what do we do first?",
        "Carly: Take the groceries into the kitchen, wash your hands. I'll get dressed, I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Craig: Okay, let's go! Brownies, ho!",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: I wasn't expecting you.",
        "Jack: Can I -- can I come in?",
        "Carly: Sure, yeah. I'm sort of in the middle of something, so --",
        "Jack: Catch you at a bad time?",
        "Carly: What do you need, Jack?",
        "Jack: I just wanted to stop by and tell you that I won't be -- I won't be needing that second mortgage right away.",
        "Carly: You and Janet, you decided not to get a house?",
        "Jack: We'll find something eventually. It's just that -- the offer fell through on the place we really wanted, so --",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, that's too bad. Thanks for telling me.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Carly: Okay, well, I'll see you later.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Craig: Okay, everything's ready to go in the kitchen -- kitchen!",
        "Jack: Don't you ever learn?",
        "Carly: What is it exactly that I'm supposed to be learning, Jack?",
        "Jack: Well, I thought your decision not to marry this guy was a sign that you were finally coming to your senses.",
        "Carly: Oh, I see. So I have sense if I do what you want me to do. And if I don't, I'm dumber than a box of hair, is that it?",
        "Jack: I mean, what is the point, if the guy's still making himself at home?",
        "Craig: You know, if you have something to say to \"The guy,\" he happens to be right here.",
        "Carly: All right, Craig. I'll handle it, thank you. I decided not to marry Craig for my own reasons.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and what were those reasons, Carly? Think about them. Because they're probably the same reasons why he shouldn't be in our home.",
        "Carly: My home! My home!",
        "Jack: Or anywhere near my kids!",
        "Craig: You're way out of line, Jack. Carly was just trying to help me out.",
        "Jack: And how exactly is she helping you, Craig, in her bathrobe?",
        "Johnny: Dad?",
        "Craig: Hey, Buddy. Sorry about that. Why don't we get back to work, huh? Come on, let's go make some brownies!",
        "Jack: What is going on?",
        "Carly: I'm going to explain it to you, Jack. Not because you deserve an explanation, but because I want this to stop! I was going to take a shower. Hence the robe. And Craig showed up with Johnny, who has his heart set on making brownies and my house has the nearest oven. That's what's going on.",
        "Jack: I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. I -- apologize.",
        "Carly: I want more than that. I want it to not happen again.",
        "Jack: It won't.",
        "Carly: And I want you to tell me why you really came here.",
        "Jack: To tell you about the mortgage.",
        "Carly: Are you sure? Or were you driving by the house, and you saw Craig's car in the driveway, so you came up with some excuse to knock on the door so you could see for yourself whether I'm sleeping with him or not.",
        "Jack: I never said that.",
        "Carly: You've been saying it since you walked in here. The way you looked at me, the way you looked at his coat, the way you looked upstairs toward the bedroom.",
        "Jack: You're a smart woman. And you're a pretty tough lady, too. But you've got a good heart. Craig can see that. So he brings his kid over here. He's using Johnny and he's using you.",
        "Carly: Are you okay?",
        "Jack: I'm fine.",
        "Carly: The house thing, is that a bigger deal --",
        "Jack: I'm fine! I am fine! But brownies or no brownies, you should stay away from Craig. Nothing good can come of this.",
        "Carly: You should go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I thought I was having a private conversation.",
        "Meg: I was worried about you.",
        "Dusty: Worried I'd kill Craig and run off with my son?",
        "Meg: Afraid you'd throw your hands up in the air and leave town.",
        "Dusty: Doesn't sound so bad.",
        "Meg: Jennifer didn't let you down, Dusty. You know where she's been the whole time? Look at her son. She's right there. In him.",
        "Dusty: Craig's going to kill that side of him. And I won't be there to stop it.",
        "Meg: Well, don't give up.",
        "Dusty: What do you want me to do, stand by? Watch Johnny forget about his mother, forget I'm his dad?",
        "Meg: I expect you to stick around, so he never forgets.",
        "Dusty: Pretty tough.",
        "Meg: Do you know why Jennifer asked you to take care of him? Because you are the only one who could outlast Craig Montgomery.",
        "Dusty: Not anymore.",
        "Meg: Come on. A court decree can't tell you how to feel about Johnny, or what he feels about you.",
        "Dusty: It changes everything. I'm not a husband to my wife, I'm not a father to my son. I don't know who I am.",
        "Meg: I do. I'll show you.",

        "Parker: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Craig: Parker!",
        "Carly: Brownies.",
        "Parker: Hey, Johnny. Great job.",
        "Carly: Yeah!",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, now that Johnny's officially my son, we're celebrating.",
        "Parker: Congratulations.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Parker: Glad you didn't need to marry my mom for that to happen.",
        "Carly: Hey. Don't you start. I just got an earful from your father.",
        "Parker: So did I.",
        "Carly: About what?",
        "Parker: I don't know. He's, like, freaked about money or something.",
        "Carly: Hey, let's put some chocolate chips in there. Would you like that? Go ahead, you do it.",
        "Parker: I think I'm going to go to the game store.",
        "Carly: Yeah, okay. Just be home in time for supper, okay?",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "Craig: Hey, Parker, could I ask you a favor?",
        "Parker: What do you need?",
        "Craig: Well, it seems that when I got Johnny back to my place, I realized I didn't pick up any of the right toys.",
        "Parker: Just get something that makes noise or crashes. I mean, you can't go wrong with that.",
        "Craig: Oh, I knew you'd be an expert. Listen, I wonder if you wouldn't mind going to pick up a few toys that you think Johnny might like to play with? And of course, pick up something for yourself, too.",
        "Parker: Really?",
        "Craig: Oh, anything you like.",
        "Parker: I guess I'll get those Metallica tickets that I was thinking about.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, is that enough?",
        "Parker: Oh, no, no, no. No, that's plenty. Thank you, Craig. I'll get Johnny some great toys.",
        "Craig: I'm counting on you.",
        "Carly: What was that all about?",
        "Craig: Oh, just spreading a little sunshine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: Hi! Oh, you are the best husband in the whole world.",
        "Jack: Why, what'd I -- what'd I do?",
        "Janet: Because, you brought me the brand new real estate listings so we could look at them right away.",
        "Jack: Oh, I'm sorry. I got waylaid. I promise I'll bring them tomorrow.",
        "Janet: That's okay. Was it a robbery or a murder or something? Tell me all about it. You know how much I love hearing that police stuff.",
        "Jack: I stopped by -- I stopped by Carly's.",
        "Janet: Why?",
        "Jack: I just wanted to tell her that the house thing didn't go through, for now. Just keeping her updated, that's all.",
        "Janet: And?",
        "Jack: And Craig was there. Still worming his way in.",
        "Janet: Was he with Johnny?",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. Can you believe that guy, using his kid like that? Unbelievable!",
        "Janet: I don't think that's what he was doing, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Janet: Because he was here earlier with Johnny. And he was very worried about him.",
        "Jack: What the hell was he doing here?",
        "Janet: He was feeding him a hamburger and fries. Will you take it easy? He's just trying to look out for his kid.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and I'm trying to look after my kids, too, Janet. I don't want Craig Montgomery breathing the same air as them.",
        "Janet: Craig is not going to hurt your kids and you know it.",
        "Jack: Oh, are you forgetting that he loaned Parker his car on the night of the ice storm?",
        "Janet: And they miraculously survived. Liberty and Parker both survived, okay? Now don't blame this on the kids. Your problem with Craig Montgomery has nothing to do with them.",
        "Jack: Really? And what is -- what is my problem?",
        "Janet: What it always is. You don't want to see Carly with another man.",
        "Jack: That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I don't care who Carly sees.",
        "Janet: Oh, liar, liar, pants on fire.",
        "Jack: And I do not lie.",
        "Janet: And you don't get this worked up over something you don't care about.",
        "Jack: But that there's some kind of residual thing for Carly, it's just -- it's wrong, Janet. You know -- you know how much I love you.",
        "Janet: I know. And every time I think about it, I get all tingly inside.",
        "Jack: Good, good. So you know that --",
        "Janet: I know we're forever. And I know that you're not going to go back to Carly.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Janet: All I'm saying is that you're having trouble letting her go.",
        "Jack: No, and I'm saying that that's just not true.",
        "Janet: You went to her house to tell her about the mortgage thing. Where we have a little invention called a phone, Jack. You could have used a phone --",
        "Jack: It's just as easy to stop by.",
        "Janet: But if you were on the phone, then you wouldn't be able to see who she's with, or what she's doing. And you would miss that.",
        "Jack: Miss having my blood pressure go through the roof? And little -- little conversations like this?",
        "Janet: Jack, you are so used to having her in your life, that you just don't know how to kick her out of it. But you should.",
        "Jack: Because it bothers you.",
        "Janet: No, it bothers you. She bothers you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Liberty: Hey. Hey, I didn't get to say I'm sorry about what I said, and how I acted. And, you know, earlier --",
        "Parker: It's okay. We kind of have a weird relationship, anyway.",
        "Liberty: Well, we're kind of weird people. So it works out.",
        "Parker: Probably. Listen, if I told you that I could figure out a way to get those tickets to the concert, would you still go with me?",
        "Liberty: Yes, definitely.",
        "Parker: Great. Well, I figured out a way.",
        "Liberty: Are you serious? Did your dad came around, or --",
        "Parker: No, actually, Craig came through.",
        "Liberty: How many people are we planning on taking with us to this concert?",
        "Parker: Well, actually, he's paying me to go shopping for his kid. I mean, how sick is that?",
        "Liberty: That's awesome. But I mean, like, do you think our parents are even going to let us go?",
        "Parker: Well, they're the ones who said that we should go together to save money.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but your dad wasn't exactly thrilled with the idea of us going to Chicago together.",
        "Parker: Well, I think that was mostly about the money. Now that we have tickets, it's a completely different story. I mean, come on, it's Metallica.",
        "Liberty: I know, I'm so excited.",
        "Parker: So let's go get some toys for Johnny, and we'll get our tickets.",
        "Liberty: Yes! Ah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Whoa, those got scarfed up pretty quick.",
        "Craig: What can I say? I'm raising an excellent chef.",
        "Carly: How many did he have?",
        "Craig: Johnny ate most of them. I just had one.",
        "Carly: Craig, you can't -- you can't let him eat so many brownies. That's not good for him.",
        "Craig: Well, he skipped lunch. Besides, I just got him back. It's not going to hurt if I just indulge him for a little while.",
        "Carly: You can't buy love.",
        "Craig: That's not what I'm doing. Okay, maybe just a little.",
        "Carly: And it's not going to work.",
        "Craig: I'm not so sure about that.",
        "Johnny: I don't feel so good.",

        "Dusty: I don't get it.",
        "Meg: Don't you remember? This is the place where we first met, when you got back to Oakdale.",
        "Dusty: I remember you had a great breast stroke.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, it's been a while since I've been skinny dipping.",
        "Dusty: If you want, you can jump in. I'll hold your clothes.",
        "Meg: Well, give me a few months and a heat wave, and -- look -- look what I found!",
        "Dusty: No! No! They're still there?",
        "Meg: Yeah, at the one and only place my mother never found. They're still cold.",
        "Dusty: Sure they're not frozen?",
        "Meg: Well, one way to find out.",
        "Dusty: Mine's good.",
        "[Meg coughs]",
        "Dusty: Are you all right there, do you need the Heimlich?",
        "Meg: It's been a while.",
        "Dusty: Let's head back to the car.",
        "Meg: This brings back memories.",
        "Dusty: It was a while ago.",
        "Meg: Well, we're older, wiser. Your hair's longer.",
        "Dusty: Why'd you bring me here, Meg?",
        "Meg: To remind you, as much as you love Jennifer and Johnny, as much as they shaped who you are, you had a life before them.",
        "Dusty: A life they changed. They changed me.",
        "Meg: They loved you.",
        "Dusty: I want to kill Craig. The guy I used to be would do it.",
        "[Ducks quacking]",
        "Meg: But not now. You wouldn't do that now.",
        "Dusty: I wouldn't be able to look in Johnny's eyes, and know I had his father's blood on my hands.",
        "Meg: The way you say that --",
        "Dusty: I say it like I'm ashamed, because I am. Jennifer wanted me to protect him, and I can't. Sometimes I wish I never changed, you know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Do you want some more coffee?",
        "Jack: Nope. I've got to get back to work.",
        "Janet: Oh, don't be mad at me. I'm just calling it like I see it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, you see it wrong.",
        "Janet: Hey, come in here, you two!",
        "Liberty: Hey guys.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: Uh, hey.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Janet: What's with the shopping bags?",
        "Parker: Craig gave me money to go shopping for Johnny.",
        "Jack: Hey, Craig shouldn't be making you his errand boy.",
        "Parker: It wasn't like that.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it was actually really fun. We had, like, full reign of the whole toy store.",
        "Janet: Well, it wasn't their fault. You know, Craig was just asking Parker to do him a favor.",
        "Jack: Yeah, what -- why are you always defending Craig?",
        "Janet: I'm not always defending Cr -- you guys go deliver the toys, all right? Your father and I need a time out.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, okay. Hey, you didn't tell your dad about the tickets.",
        "Parker: Are you kidding? Did you see him go off in there?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but the concert's tomorrow. Come on, when are we going to tell them?",
        "Parker: I was thinking, maybe after we get home safe and sound?",
        "Liberty: Why didn't I think of that?",
        "Janet: What the hell do you care what Craig does with his money?",
        "Jack: Because he's throwing it right at my son!",
        "Janet: He asked Parker to do him a favor for Johnny. That's not hurting anybody. What's really bugging you?",
        "Jack: He's got money and I don't.",
        "Janet: Jack --",
        "Jack: Come on, Janet. You're my wife. You deserve a house of your own. And instead, I've got you working double shifts to pay for curtains for a house we can't even afford!",
        "Janet: Where is all this coming from?",
        "Jack: I couldn't up the bid on the house, right? I couldn't give that money for the concert.",
        "Janet: Paychecks only stretch so far, Sweetheart. That has nothing to do with you being a good husband or father.",
        "Jack: Did you see the look on their faces? I want to give them things. I want -- I want to give you things.",
        "Janet: I have you. The rest doesn't matter.",
        "Jack: It matters to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm a lousy father. What kind of an idiot lets his kid eat all the brownies he wants?",
        "Carly: That's one mistake down. A couple million to go and you'll be in the running for father of the year.",
        "Craig: Funny. I really blew it.",
        "Carly: Not so much. He'll be fine after his nap. And you'll be fine, once you stop assuming that it's good to give a kid everything he wants.",
        "Craig: Okay. I'll give you anything you want as a \"Thank you\" for today.",
        "Carly: That's not what you're doing.",
        "Craig: Are you accusing me of having an ulterior motive?",
        "Carly: With every breath you take.",
        "Craig: What is it you think I'm after?",
        "Carly: An on-call parental assistant.",
        "Craig: The thought never occurred to me.",
        "Carly: Well, when it does, and it will, let it be known that daddy's little helper isn't going to be me.",

        "Dusty: Just admit it, you're following me around.",
        "Meg: Well, the part about Eliza is true. But yes, I am worried about you.",
        "Dusty: I'm fine.",
        "Meg: Do you need help with it?",
        "Dusty: No, no, I'm almost done. Jennifer gave him this blanket when he was a baby. Just doing what you told me. Helping him remember her any way I can.",
        "Meg: Are you going to put a picture of you in there?",
        "Dusty: You think Craig would let him keep it?",
        "Meg: Probably not.",
