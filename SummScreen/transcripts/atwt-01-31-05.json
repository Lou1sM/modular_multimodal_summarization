        "Casey: The housekeeper -- sorry, I don't really remember her name.",
        "Rosanna: No, not Phyllis. Anyone else, anybody else outside?",
        "Casey: Nope. The party won't really start for a while. Is will here? Where should I set up?",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. What?",
        "Casey: The sound system. I'm the deejay, remember?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, right. Um --",
        "Casey: Dude, I thought you bailed on me. Where do you want me to set up?",

        "Paul: Dude! I am so totally in awe of your executive abilities.",
        "Rosanna: Um, honey, um -- Barbara, she's locked up, right?",
        "Paul: Yeah, she's probably drinking out of a tin cup as we speak. But the important thing is, is that will is back here where he belongs and we finally have our life back.",

        "Emily: I'm actually waiting for Alison.",
        "Hal: Oh, well, I can take you home.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's okay. I told her that Barbara was back in prison and she insisted on picking me up and taking me to met.",
        "Hal: Metro, great idea. I tell you what, why don't you give me a few minutes to wrap things up and I'll meet you over there. Then I can take you home afterwards.",
        "Ely: I don't think that's such a great idea.",
        "Hal: Why not?",

        "Jack: I left a message with Julia to see when J.J. can come for another visit.",

        "Jack: You're amazing.",
        "Carly: Why? Because I promised to be polite?",
        "Jack: Because you haven't said, \"I told you so.\" Not once.",
        "Carly: I don't need to. Julia's actions speak for themselves. We are not going to let her hurt us, Jack, not anymore. We just won't let that happen.",

        "Jack: Well, they're finally asleep. How come it takes me so much longer to get through their bedtime stories than it does you?",
        "Carly: Because I don't play every character in costume.",
        "Jack: You don't? Any more pie in the fridge?",

        "Jack: They're asleep. I was hoping to take advantage of this time alone.",
        "Carly: Well, we will, when I get back. Okay? I won't be gone long. Oh, Emma -- what are you doing here?",

        "Emma: Well, it was very quick. But Iva's feeling better. I came straight from the airport.",
        "Jack: And we were your first stop? Hey, I guess we rate.",
        "Emma: Well, I wanted to talk to Carly before I went home.",
        "Hal: I was kind of looking forward to having you and Daniel back home now that all this craziness is over.",
        "Emily: I need more time.",
        "Hal: How much more time? Is it because Will was so upset?",
        "Emily: Will had every right to be upset. Will saw me in Fairwinds. And then he had his mother whispering into his ear that I was trying to frame him. But you --",
        "Hal: Me? I stood up for you, Emily.",
        "Emily: Eventually. But let's face it, you didn't at first.",
        "Hal: What are you talking about? I told Paul that I believed you long before he jumped on board.",
        "Emily: But there was a little speed bump, remember? You doubted me first and then you came around later.",
        "Hal: I had to look at the evidence. It's what I do. I'm a cop.",
        "Emily: And I'm your wife! And having faith in me is supposed to be automatic, and it wasn't. And I have a problem with that.",
        "Alison: Em!",
        "Emily: Hey, honey.",
        "Alison: This is so great! I'm so glad they cleared you.",

        "Alison: But thank God you did. He really came through for you, didn't he?",

        "Casey: Cool. Thanks. Did you bring my vinyl?",
        "Margo: I lugged the box down. I put it in the car. I think you can take it from here.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Margo: Okay. Roseanne? You are a brave woman, having a bunch of hormonal teenagers in your home.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I wanted to do it for Will. I wanted to make things up to him.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and in a lot of ways -- I mean, Will would never say this, but this is kind of a celebration of Barbara's first night in jail.",
        "Margo: Ooh, ooh. Well, you know, it's gotta feel good, though, to know what finally happened here, huh?",
        "Paul: Yes, it is.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what if we don't know?",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",
        "Rosanna: Well, what if we thought -- we thought the incidents had stopped, but what if they haven't?",
        "Margo: The evidence against Barbara is pretty damning.",
        "Rosanna: Has anyone talked to Emily since Barbara was put away?",
        "Margo: Yeah, she talked to Tom today. You know what? They're pretty sure that the case against Barbara is gonna stick.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. Well, that's good.",
        "Paul: Can I talk to you for a sec?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Okay. Excuse us, Margo.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, no problem.",

        "Rosanna: I don't know --",
        "Will: Maybe we should start with some old school.",
        "Casey: Nah. We've gotta kick it off. Get them pumped up.",
        "Rosanna: I don't want to go into it right now. Will's having a good time. I don't want to ruin things for him.",
        "Paul: Wow, okay, if what you're talking about is gonna ruin Will's time, we really do need to talk about this. Come on.",
        "Rosanna: Wait, but, Paul --",
        "Paul: Margo, could you do us a favor? Could you hold down the fort for a few minutes? We're gonna step out. If the caterers show up before we come back, they've got instructions.",
        "Margo: Yeah, it's no problem. [Blaring rock music plays] Whoa! Problem, problem!",
        "Rosanna: Sorry. Paul, sweetie -- wait. Look, maybe I'm just being silly -- you know, I should stay and make sure that the party goes --",
        "Paul: Okay, look, at this point, we're pretty much just in the way. All right? We'll step out, we'll have a quick drink, we'll be right back. I really want to know what's on your mind. All right, all of the hauntings, all of the mind- games -- everything that Barbara did, it's over now. You can relax.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, let's go. We need to talk.",
        "Paul: All right.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I hope we didn't leave anyone in the lurch.",
        "Paul: Come on, Rosanna, they're gonna be fine. You --",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Been really jittery ever since I brought Will home. You wanna tell me what's going on?",
        "Baby: Mama.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know --",
        "Paul: It doesn't have anything to do with Will living with us, does it?",
        "Rosanna: No, absolutely not! Please don't think that. If I'm having second thoughts about anything, it's about living at Fairwinds.",
        "Paul: But you were the one who wanted to live at Fairwinds.",
        "Rosanna: I know, I know. I fought you on it, but I'm beginning to think that you were right -- that being there is maybe making it hard for me to let go of Cabot. I thought it would bring me closure, but instead it's like he's still there -- only not in a safe way, like a memory. More immediate -- it's threatening. I don't know. Maybe all those hauntings just got to me. It's just all made me really jumpy.",
        "Paul: Okay, you have every right to be jumpy. But remember, there is nothing other-worldly about this, okay? This is my very real, very insane mother playing with our heads. Which, thank God, she won't be able to do anymore.",
        "Rosanna: Are you sure? What if it happens again?",
        "Paul: She's locked up, Rosanna. There's no way --",

        "Will: You know, the 6:00 news is probably about how my dad put my mom in jail today. I don't think anybody's coming to my freak-show party.",
        "Casey: You kidding? The scandal factor alone will have people lined up around the block.",
        "Will: Yeah, right.",
        "Casey: I'm serious. We're gonna need a doorman to keep the whole school from crashing. Actually, do you think Rosanna has one of those velvet ropes we could --?",
        "Will: I don't know about that, but she might still have the guest list. I'll check.",
        "Casey: Hey, Mom --",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Casey: Feel like working the door?",
        "Margo: What, I'm dragging your music around and now you want me to be your bouncer?",
        "Casey: No -- you're my super cool Mom that I know I can always count on.",
        "Margo: Oh, you are so full of it. All right. Where's the list?",
        "Casey: Thanks, Mom. It'll only be for a little bit.",
        "Margo: Okay. 'Cause I charge time and a half after 9:00.",
        "Casey: You all right?",
        "Will: You and your mom are pretty close, huh?",
        "Casey: We have our moments, but most of the time, yeah, we're cool.",
        "Will: You're really lucky. I just hope you know that.",

        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, of course -- come in, come in.",
        "Emma: Thank you.",
        "Carly: Sit down. So, does this have something to do with Lily and I putting that compass in Julia's bag?",
        "Emma: Yeah. Carly, I thought that was a very, very nasty trick and it's been weighing on me ever since I've been away. I thought I needed to come here from the airport before I went home to just clear the air.",
        "Carly: Okay. I'm listening.",
        "Emma: Listen, no matter how you and Lily feel about Julia, I do not want to be put in the middle of any revenge plots. Do you understand? Julia and her son are guests in my home, and I expect you and Lily to treat her with respect --",
        "Carly: You're absolutely right. Lily and I had no business trying to make Julia look bad. And putting you in the middle was just wrong, and I'm sorry.",
        "Emma: You are?",
        "Carly: From the bottom of my heart. Lily and I even tried to apologize to Julia. I promise you, it will never happen again.",

        "Holden: After the day I've had, I'm not surprised. I can't believe Jack and I got into it the way we did.",
        "Julia: I'm sorry. I feel really terrible about the whole thing.",
        "Holden: Oh, please don't -- I still got Luke to deal with. I need somebody in my life who is okay.",
        "Julia: Do you think you're gonna be able to get him to understand, honey?",
        "Holden: I hope so. We've been through so much together. He's an amazing kid.",
        "Julia: Yeah, well he takes after his dad.",
        "Holden: I didn't raise him alone.",
        "Julia: No, I didn't mean it like that. I'm sure Lily's a wonderful mother.",
        "Holden: Have you seen how Luke is generous with J.J.?",
        "Julia: Yeah.",
        "Holden: How patient he is? Lily -- she taught Luke well. She taught him how to be a great big brother. It's just gonna take him a little time to adjust to it being over between his mom and me.",
        "Julia: Listen, don't think about any of that, okay? Just relax, and let me take care of you a little bit.",
        "Holden: What's that?",
        "Julia: How did that get out there? Ooh, this was in my memory box. Oh, my gosh.",
        "Holden: How old is he there?",
        "Julia: Four. I wish I had his baby pictures.",
        "Holden: Where are they?",
        "Julia: Here and there. You know, I had to leave a lot of stuff behind. But I take really good care of the things I did hang onto. I have no idea how it ended up on the floor.",
        "Holden: You don't? I do. J.J. Faith used to go in our drawers all the time. She'd pull stuff out, and toss it on the floor.",
        "Julia: Yeah, he gets pretty sentimental. He could've done that. He likes to look at old photographs and stuff like that. Anyway, let me just put it away, okay?",

        "Holden: What does this have to do with J.J.?",
        "Carly: Oh, God, I'm so sorry -- you know, this is coming out all wrong. I probably shouldn't even have come here tonight. It's just that I'm watching our family fall apart and I hate it. You and Jack are like brothers and look what's happened to the two of you. I just think that we need to be very careful and try very hard to be sure that J.J. doesn't get hurt in all of this.",
        "Julia: Since when do you care what happens to J.J., Carly? You haven't exactly been subtle about wanting him out of Jack's life.",
        "Carly: Jack cares about J.J., and I care about Jack. And if Jack wants your son in his life then I'm gonna make sure that the situation is the best that it can be. So whatever's going on between the two of you, let's just all keep our heads, okay? That's it. That's all. You guys go back to whatever you were doing.",

        "Carly: Emma came by just as I was about to leave. They didn't catch you, did they?",
        "Lily: No, it was horrible. I was in the bedroom and then they came in and they started to -- thank God you called when you did.",

        "Emma: Well, I don't know. It seemed to me she apologized a little too quickly.",
        "Jack: Well, we've had discussions about the situation with Julia. Carly knows she was way over the line, and she promised to back off. Listen, we are not going to do anything to put you in the middle ever again.",
        "Emma: Well, good. As long as we're talking here, there's something -- there's something else that's really been bothering me.",
        "Jack: Let's get it out on the table.",
        "Emma: Well, I mean, I don't condone what Carly did, but after what she's been through with Julia I kind of understand it. But what I don't understand is, why would Lily be on this \"get Julia\" bandwagon? I mean, is there something happening that I don't know about?",
        "Jack: That's something you're gonna have to ask Lily. Lily and Holden.",

        "Alison: Isn't this great? Thank you so much, Paul, for working so hard to prove that Emily was innocent. If she'd had gone to prison, I don't know what I would've done.",
        "Paul: The only person going to prison is Barbara. I'm just trying to convince Rosanna that it's gonna be for a very long time.",
        "Emily: Yeah, actually, I think Paul's right. Tom and Hal both say that there's enough evidence to convict her this time.",
        "Rosanna: You were at the station all evening?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm. As a matter of fact, Tom said he's going to get in touch with you about dropping those charges if you're still willing to do that. Rosanna: Yeah, of course. Sure. [Phone ringing] Oh, that's me. Excuse me one second. I hope everything's okay at home. Hold on a second. Margo: Hi, it's me. I just thought you should know the caterers haven't shown up yet, and Will's getting a little nervous.",
        "Rosanna: They should be there by now.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well I'm wondering if they got the directions straight. You know, that turnoff isn't very well-lit.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I thought they understood. I'll call them and see what's going on. Thanks, Margo. It's the caterers. They haven't show up yet, and Will's freaking out.",
        "Alison: Why? What's going on?",
        "Paul: Will's having some people over at the house. Kind of a welcome home thing.",
        "Alison: Oh, would you guys mind if I stopped over to say hi?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, would you? Oh, that would be great. I would really appreciate that and I'm sure Will would love it.",

        "Paul: All right.",
        "Emily: Did I say something I shouldn't have?",
        "Paul: No. Rosanna's a little worried that the charges against Barbara aren't gonna stick. Do you have any I can't believe it's not butter!?",

        "Casey: Just keep moving.",
        "Will: You don't get it. Everybody thinks I'm a freak. You don't know what that's like.",
        "Casey: I don't? My mom's 5-0. You have any idea what I've had to put up with? Dude, everybody thinks they're a freak on the inside. Some people just hide it better. Look, here's what you do. Whenever you need to chill out, just come out here and change the music.",
        "Will: Cool. [Doorbell chimes] It's mingle time.",
        "Margo: May I announce your guests as they arrive?",

        "Man: Oh, dear, I've gotten it all wrong. My boss is just gonna kill me. Sorry, sorry to bother you.",
        "Rosanna: This is crazy. I should go and just make sure everything is okay. No, no, no. You stay here. You stay here and celebrate. You know, the kids don't need a of grown-ups hanging around. I'll meet you back at home.",
        "Paul: You've got car keys?",
        "Rosanna: I've got car keys. How will you get home?",
        "Emily: Oh. Well, I'd offer you a ride, but I actually rode with Alison, so --",
        "Paul: You know, we finish this champagne, we're gonna have to take a taxi.",
        "Rosanna: Stop. Listen, I'll contact tom about dropping the charges, okay?",
        "Emily: Thank you very much, Rosanna.",
        "Paul: Come on, I'll walk you out.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",

        "Rosanna: No, no, no, no, no, no. You stay. You stay. You celebrate. You deserve it. Emily is understandably grateful for everything that you've done. I'll see you at home, okay?",
