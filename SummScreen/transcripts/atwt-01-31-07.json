        "Brad: Easy, Bud. Easy.",
        "Vienna: Jack, please! Don't fight with your brother over of me. Thank you. I don't know why this always happens. It's something about me that makes men turn into animals.",
        "Jack: Vienna, this isn't about you.",
        "Vienna: Are you sure about that?",
        "Brad: If good 'ol Jack says so, it must be true.",
        "Vienna: And stop that! I swore to myself never to get in between two brothers again. That one time in Shanghai -- that was enough.",
        "Jack: I don't think you have to worry about history repeating itself.",
        "Brad: He's right, Vienna. This has got nothing to do with you. We were just talking about our cousin, Luke. And it seems he's turned out to be --",
        "Jack: Okay, would you please just knock it off, Brad.",
        "Brad: Would you lighten up? I wasn't going to say anything inappropriate.",
        "Vienna: There's only one thing that could make you this angry. It's Carly, isn't it?",
        "Jack: No, Vienna, it's not. And I don't want to get into that with you, please.",
        "Vienna: Now, now. You know what, there must be something I can do to get your mind off your ex-wife, huh?",
        "Parker: Nice, Jack. Glad you're having a good time.",
        "Jack: Damn it. Parker! Parker!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I hope you girls brought your appetites. Because your mom has been cooking up a storm in there.",
        "Natalie: That looks really good.",
        "Lily: Doesn't it? Now save some room for dinner. Faith?",
        "Faith: You and Natalie can pig out if you want to. I'm not hungry.",
        "Natalie: Are you still sick?",
        "Faith: Natalie, be quiet.",
        "Lily: Hey, hey. Who's sick? Something wrong, Faith?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I sure would like to get this meeting with Emily over with as soon as possible.",
        "Dusty: Really? I couldn't tell.",
        "Lucinda: I should never have let you talk me into having Worldwide buy that miserable rag.",
        "Dusty: You're not gonna complain when you see the profits.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, great. Where is she? Where is our partner, Emily?",
        "Dusty: She should be here.",
        "Lucinda: She's off on the wrong foot with me.",
        "Dusty: Maybe she got held up at tom and Margo's. Her kid's going to boarding school, she went over there to say good-bye.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, great. She's gonna be in a fine mood to talk business.",
        "Dusty: Let me see what I can find out. Excuse me. Have you seen Emily Stewart? Blonde, attractive?",
        "Bartender: Yes, Mr. Donovan. I told her you were running late, but she left.",
        "Dusty: Emily, where did you go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Wow. Beautiful suite.",
        "Steve: Thank you. I always request this room when I'm in town.",
        "Emily: You obviously know what you like.",
        "Steve: So what would you like to drink? Vodka okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Yeah. I don't usually order vodka, but there's a first time for everything, right?",
        "Steve: Right. Always a first time --",
        "Emily: Thank you. So, are you in town on business or --",
        "Steve: Hey. We both know we didn't come up here to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You're right. You're right. I have lied to you. But that was a long time ago. And I promised you that I'd never do that again.",
        "Gwen: I know you did.",
        "Will: But?",
        "Gwen: Look, sometimes you feel cornered, okay? And you go off and you do something --",
        "Will: And then what? I start acting like a lunatic? I loose my mind? I start making stories up?",
        "Gwen: I would never say that!",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Adam: Hey -- everything okay?",
        "Will: Adam, not now. It's really not a good time. So could you please just leave?",
        "Gwen: No. No, no, no, wait. He should just stay a minute, okay? He can help.",
        "Will: Gwen, don't.",
        "Gwen: Hold on, all right? Look, I found this.",
        "Adam: What's that?",
        "Gwen: It's one of the bonds that Barbara gave us to finish the demo.",
        "Adam: How's that possible? Will put them all in the safe at Crash. They were stolen.",
        "Gwen: Exactly. So do you have any idea how it ended up our house?",
        "Will: Don't stop there, Gwen. Tell him what you really think -- that I stole the bonds because I'm insecure. That I don't want you to have a career of your own that doesn't involve me, right? I'm sure he'd agree with you. That's what you want, isn't it?",
        "Gwen: Stop telling me what I want.",
        "Will: Well, I know what you don't want. And that's to listen to my side of things right now. I can tell by the way you're looking at me.",
        "Adam: Wait a second, both of you. Now there's got to be a reasonable explanation for this. And I think I know what it is. Now Will, when Barbara gave you the bonds, you went straight to Crash and put them in the safe, right?",
        "Will: Yeah. You heard me tell your mom the whole story.",
        "Adam: All right, easy. Gwen, you said you found this one bond here?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Adam: Where? Can you show me?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I found it right over there.",
        "Adam: Oh, okay.",
        "Will: Come on. Adam, what does this have to do with me not being a thief? How's it going to prove that to Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Look, it's not about you being a thief, okay? Don't put words in my mouth.",
        "Adam: Wait a second. Okay, when you guys moved in, how much of this stuff was already here?",
        "Will: All of it. Everything is Lucinda's.",
        "Adam: Then isn't it possible that this bond also belongs to Lucinda? I mean, you guys could've knocked it loose from someplace and not even notice, right?",
        "Will: Yeah, that is possible, thank you.",
        "Adam: Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I was cleaning the other day, and moved a bunch of furniture around.",
        "Adam: It makes sense. And we can prove it, too. Look, these numbers -- they're part of series. All we gotta do is make sure that this bond isn't one of the ones that Barbara gave to Will.",
        "Gwen: We don't have any of others to compare it to those.",
        "Will: We'll call the bank. My mom's banker is the same woman who handles my trust fund. So she'll track the serial numbers for us.",
        "Adam: Perfect. What's her number?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith, are you not feeling well?",
        "Faith: No, Natalie's talking about a girl in my class who had to go home early today, and my teacher said it was the stomach flu.",
        "Lily: Oh, I hope you're not coming down with it.",
        "Faith: Mom, can you please stop worrying about me? You make everything into such a big deal when it's not.",
        "Holden: Wow, whatever you're cooking smells great.",
        "Lily: Unfortunately, it's still going to be another 10 or 15 minutes. We're not going to eat when I thought.",
        "Holden: I don't think I can wait that long.",
        "Lily: You'll have to try, please.",
        "Holden: Did you get the buffet table set up?",
        "Lily: No, I was so busy with the fantastic appetizers.",
        "Holden: All right, I'll help you out since you did all the cooking.",
        "Lily: See that? True love, right there.",
        "Natalie: I want to help, too.",
        "Holden: Let's go. The more the merrier.",
        "Lily: Good, good. Okay, okay, go. All right, Faith, you wash up. And can you tell Luke to come down for dinner and join us, please? And have one of those appetizers. They're so -- so good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why'd you take off like that?",
        "Parker: What do you care? You were obviously busy.",
        "Jack: I'm never too busy for you, Parker.",
        "Parker: I don't see why I have to be here if J.J. and Sage don't.",
        "Jack: That's because Lily invited you, and J.J. and Sage had plans they can't get out of.",
        "Brad: Hey, come on, what's the matter, Parker? Don't you want to help welcome your Uncle Brad home?",
        "Parker: I see you every day at the farm.",
        "Brad: True, but a good Snyder never turns down a party.",
        "Parker: I'm not a Snyder.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you are, Buddy.",
        "Jack: All right, Brad, I think it's best if you and your date didn't stick around.",
        "Brad: This is my dinner. You're seriously telling me to take a walk because some stupid crack that I made that wasn't even about Luke?",
        "Jack: Let's make this clear, okay? Lily asked you to leave. I'm just making sure you follow through.",
        "Vienna: Jack, I'm sorry if my being here has made things more difficult for you.",
        "Jack: Vienna, I just don't want anything to ruin Lily's dinner.",
        "Brad: Like showing the guest of honor the door before he's had a bite to eat? Something like that?",
        "Jack: There's a drive-thru a couple miles down the road. Next time, maybe the guest of honor will think twice before spouting his mouth off.",
        "Brad: You got it.",
        "Jack: Come on, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I told you so.",
        "Dusty: Don't start.",
        "Lucinda: Emily is unreliable, this thing was a mistake from the get-go. I should go and have my head examined for letting you talk me into this.",
        "Dusty: Have a drink, would ya?",
        "Lucinda: Now that's a good idea. Darling, why are you so intent and insistent on helping this woman?",
        "Dusty: You know what she did for my son.",
        "Lucinda: Well, so you have noble motives. Great. But after everything that she did to you?",
        "Dusty: Are you going to be like this all night?",
        "Lucinda: All night? You think I'm going to hang around indefinitely with you?",
        "Dusty: I'm going to call Emily right now, find out where she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You're right. I don't think either one of us has any interest in talking.",
        "Steve: It's overrated. Especially when we have this suite to ourselves. To do whatever we'd like. [Cell phone rings] Do you need to get that?",
        "Emily: Yeah, let me just check. Thank you.",
        "Steve: I guess not.",
        "Emily: It can wait. It all can wait. I don't want to think about anything. I don't want to talk about anything.",
        "Steve: Any other requests?",
        "Emily: Can you help me forget about the whole world?",
        "Steve: I could. But that would leave only the two of us.",
        "Emily: For one night, I'd like that. Oh, I'm sorry. I have one request. I don't know what to call you. I don't know your name.",
        "Steve: Steve.",
        "Emily: Steve. Is it really Steve?",
        "Steve: What's yours?",
        "Emily: Does it really matter?",
        "Steve: You won't be too offended if I say no, will you?",
        "Emily: Not at all.",
        "Steve: Now it's your turn to do something for me. Take your clothes off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: It's all going to backfire on you, you know.",
        "Dusty: Emily's gonna show up, don't worry.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, sure, because you left her a stern voice message? Darling, please.",
        "Dusty: Because it's important, she'll show.",
        "Lucinda: Is it important? All I see around here is you bending over backwards for that woman, and she doesn't even turn up for a meeting that has been arranged entirely for her benefit.",
        "Dusty: Lucinda, she bent over backward when it mattered. When she saved my son.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, well, one unselfish act in her lifetime. Are you going to be in debt to her for the rest of your life?",
        "Dusty: Is that what you think I'm doing?",
        "Lucinda: I don't know what you're doing. I can't understand what you're doing. Obviously, you empathize with her because she's lost a child, and you've lost a child. But why do you set her up as a paragon of journalistic enterprise? Come on. And that is not going to get Johnny back.",
        "Dusty: Who said it would. Listen to me. I'm helping Emily because life's kicking her around and she deserves a break. I just hope she knows what she's doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Steve: No. Leave the heels on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Come fix yourself a plate, Faith!",
        "Faith: Yeah, right. Told you, not hungry. Hey, Parker.",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Jack: Faith, dinner almost ready?",
        "Faith: You can't hear them chowing down?",
        "Lily: Oh, good, Parker, you're here. I'm so glad you're here. Thanks for coming. Oh, he's pleasant.",
        "Jack: Yep.",
        "Lily: Yeah. Is Brad still here?",
        "Jack: No, he left. I'm sorry about what he said. He didn't know that Luke was gay. Not that that's any kind of excuse. But he tends to speak before he thinks. Actually, that happens more often than not.",
        "Lily: That's okay. I like your brother, I do. But I am not going to have Luke have to deal with that kind of ignorance in his own home.",
        "Jack: I agree with you 100%. Where is Luke?",
        "Lily: I don't know. Faith, did you tell Luke to come join us like I asked you to?",
        "Faith: He's doing his homework. And he'll be down when he's ready.",
        "Lily: Okay. So why don't you eat something for yourself.",
        "Faith: I told you, I'm not hungry!",
        "Jack: Pleasant.",
        "Lily: Honey, whether you're hungry or not, this is a family dinner. And you're going to be sitting at the table with us.",
        "Faith: Whatever.",
        "Lily: Okay. Well, the buffet is set up if everybody wants to start helping themselves to dinner.",
        "Jack: Parker, sounds good. Wanna go?",
        "Parker: I didn't know we were coming here for dinner, so I ate at Jamal's. Can I just hang outside while you guys eat?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Faith: How come Parker doesn't have to sit at the table and I do? Why can't I just go outside with Parker?",
        "Lily: Because you haven't eaten anything all day. Holden, please --",
        "Holden: Okay, why don't you guys go get started? I'll be there in a minute.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Holden: What's going on? Why are you giving your mom such a hard time?",
        "Faith: I'm not. She's just being a total drama queen.",
        "Holden: Oh, come on.",
        "Faith: I'm just not hungry, that's all. Why does she have to make it into something else?",
        "Holden: Your mom spent a lot of time on this dinner.",
        "Faith: For Brad, not me. And she kicked him out, so what does it matter now?",
        "Holden: Well, she had her reasons for doing that. And we're still here. All right, I'll tell you what. Why don't you and Parker go outside? You can do that only if you promise me that you'll eat a little bit later.",
        "Faith: Fine. Let's go.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Faith: So, is it weird having your uncle living at the farm with you?",
        "Parker: He's okay. He's loud. Smokes a lot of cigars. I like where we used to live better.",
        "Faith: Vienna's pretty.",
        "Parker: If that's what you're into.",
        "Faith: I can't believe it's almost February. It's so warm out.",
        "Parker: My teacher says it's called global warming. The whole world's messed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hi. Thank you. Thanks for coming by on such short notice.",
        "Banker: I was reviewing Barbara's portfolio when you called.",
        "Will: This is my brother, Adam, and this is Gwen. This is Carol Meredith. So we think we mixed up one of the bonds that my mom loaned me with one of Lucinda Walsh's.",
        "Banker: I have the transaction records right here. May I?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: So if this isn't one of the bonds that my mom gave me, then it won't match up with any of the numbers on the list, right?",
        "Banker: Right. Here it is, third one in the series. Does that answer all your questions?",
        "Will: Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. Thanks you for coming by, again. I swear to you that I didn't touch these bonds once I put them in the safe.",
        "Gwen: What are you saying, Will? That the banker lied?",
        "Will: I have no clue how this happened. But promise you that I had nothing to do with those bonds getting stolen. Well, don't everybody talk at once!",
        "Gwen: Can you just give me a minute?",
        "Will: You need a minute? For what? Well, never mind. You said it yourself. If I lied to you once, why wouldn't I do it again, right?",
        "Gwen: I'm not accusing you of anything, Will. But the more the more that you act like I am, it makes --",
        "Will: What? The harder it is for you to believe me? If I'm such a thief, if I'm a liar -- then what do you think happened?",
        "Gwen: I don't know.",
        "Will: Well, what was my first lie, Gwen? I wanted you have a singing career? That your dream was my dream? If I lied about that, then what the hell, why not? Just steal the money and make it look like a bank robbery, right?",
        "Gwen: Oh, my God, stop!",
        "Will: Well, that's what you think happened, isn't it?",
        "Gwen: What am I supposed to say?",
        "Will: How about, \"No, Will. I know that you would never do something like that.\" You know what? You talk about honesty, and about not keeping secrets from each other. Well, if you want to know what happened, why don't you just ask me, and I'll tell you the truth?",
        "Gwen: Okay, did you do it? Did you steal the bonds?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: That meal is the best thing to come out of Brad's visit.",
        "Holden: Is it just a visit?",
        "Jack: With my brother? How the hell am I supposed to know?",
        "Holden: Not the reunion you envisioned, huh?",
        "Jack: I didn't envision any reunion, period. And his timing couldn't be worse.",
        "Holden: Well, you know you can hide out here any time you want.",
        "Jack: Thanks, I appreciate that. And thanks for inviting Parker. The car ride home will give us some one on one time. We haven't had a lot of that lately.",
        "Holden: Yeah. How's he dealing with all the changes?",
        "Jack: As far as he's concerned, Carly's abandoned him. And I can't blame him for feeling that way.",
        "Holden: She left you, too.",
        "Jack: I left her first. And Parker -- let's just say he hasn't been shy about pointing that out to me.",
        "Holden: That's got to be tough.",
        "Jack: I couldn't love that kid more, Holden. I couldn't love him more. And sometimes, when he looks at me, I feel like -- I swear, I feel like I'm staring at pure hatred.",
        "Holden: He doesn't hate you. He's just confused. He's scared. It's natural. He's just acting out. And he's doing it to you because he knows he can get away with it. He knows that you're not going to leave him.",
        "Jack: Between Hal's death and Carly running off like that, he's told me that he feels like he doesn't belong anywhere. It's hell. It's hell to hear.",
        "Holden: Did you talk to him about the adoption?",
        "Jack: Well, I talked to him. He shot that down rather quickly. And I just left him alone with that. Maybe that was a mistake, I don't know.",
        "Holden: You know, he's acting this way partly because of the situation, and partly because of his age. I'm telling you, even if Carly were here, I don't think it would be all that different.",
        "Jack: So you're saying I should just let sleeping dogs lie?",
        "Holden: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.",
        "Jack: Oh, geez. Thanks for all the help. You're very, very helpful. Incredibly helpful, actually.",
        "Holden: You did say something about a little one on one time with him? You should do that. Plan a trip.",
        "Jack: Well, I've thought about it, yeah. But I don't think -- you know, I've got to get him on board first. And I don't know if I could deal with an entire weekend of the silent treatment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: So, you're like, into the environment and stuff?",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Faith: You just said that thing about global warming.",
        "Parker: Oh. I like science class. We get to blow up stuff sometimes.",
        "Faith: I'm sorry about your parents. I know they split up. That stinks.",
        "Parker: Pretty much.",
        "Faith: Remember at New Year's how I thought my parents were getting divorced?",
        "Parker: They seem all right now. Looks like you were wrong.",
        "Faith: Yeah, but my dad does put up with a lot.",
        "Parker: Well, at least your mom's still here. Mine's supposed to be in jail right now, just like her boyfriend.",
        "Faith: You know, there's worse things that a mom could be.",
        "Parker: Yeah? Yeah, like what?",
