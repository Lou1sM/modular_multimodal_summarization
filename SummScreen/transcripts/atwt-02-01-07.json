        "Jack: Katie.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Katie: I guess I'm the last person you expected to see.",
        "Jack: What's going on? Something wrong?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I would have gone to Margo with this, but she has a lot on her mind with Tom just getting home from the hospital and everything.",
        "Jack: Come on in, come on in. Please.",
        "Katie: The kids around?",
        "Jack: They're upstairs. So what is it you wanted?",
        "Katie: I really hate to make things worse. But it's from Simon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Why do you have this?",
        "Nurse #1: Dr. Hughes pulled it because of the autopsy.",
        "Meg: They're performing an autopsy on Sarah Shaughnessy's, right?",
        "Nurse #1: Right.",
        "Meg: So why are you sitting here reading this? You're doing it because?",
        "Nurse #2: We were just curious.",
        "Meg: Well, let me satisfy your curiosity. Sarah Shaughnessy' was a nice woman, and she came in here for minor surgery. And instead of checking out in a couple of days, she died. Do you need more details?",
        "Nurse #2: Why did her husband pull a gun on you?",
        "Meg: Because he loved his wife very much. He didn't come here to hurt anybody. He just wanted to know why -- why this had to happen.",
        "Nurse #2: I'll put the file away.",
        "Meg: No. I'll do it. There must be something else. I must have missed something.",
        "Craig: Feeling guilty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Adam, go away.",
        "Adam: I just wanted to make sure you were okay.",
        "Gwen: I'm fine. Can you just leave, please?",
        "Adam: Why?",
        "Gwen: Because I don't want to talk about the bonds, or how one of them showed up in our house. And I don't want to talk about Will. I don't want to think about any of it.",
        "Adam: You're just going to ignore the fact that you found one of those bonds at your place? That Will probably stole it and then hid it --",
        "Gwen: Adam, please, can you go?",
        "Adam: Okay.",
        "Gwen: Will wouldn't do something like this. He wouldn't wreck our chances of finishing the demo. He wouldn't ruin all of our work. He just -- he wouldn't.",
        "Adam: Then why'd you run away from him?",
        "Gwen: I wanted to think, alone.",
        "Adam: In a dorm room?",
        "Gwen: It's my dorm room. It's paid for.",
        "Adam: And that's why you're here, right? You and Will supposed to be in college together. Pretending to be just two normal kids. That you're not this amazing singer. That you could be happy living in this small town performing at a local club, reminiscing about your almost-shot at the big time.",
        "Gwen: God, we're supposed to be in this together. We're supposed to want what's best for each other, always. We're supposed to be happy.",
        "Adam: Yeah, happy. I was hoping to get some of that, too.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, well, you're not going to be the big time producer that makes me a star. So maybe you should get over it.",
        "Adam: You think that's what i care about right now? That that's why I came here?",
        "Gwen: Well, why did you?",
        "Adam: I'm scared, just like you are, Gwen. I'm worried about my brother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What is this, Iris? Are you celebrating? You drinking a toast to pulling a fast one on me?",
        "Iris: You know what, I just remembered. Gotta go. Ooh.",
        "Will: You know what? You made Gwen think I stole from her!",
        "Iris: Let go of me, or I'm gonna call the cops.",
        "Will: Go ahead. Call them. You can use my phone.",
        "Iris: Oh, you know what, I think I'm gonna do that later. Really, I'm gonna do it later. 'Cause I gotta have a meeting with my parole officer.",
        "Will: You can forget your parole officer. Because once I call the cops and tell them about the registered bonds you stole, you're going back to jail.",
        "Iris: Registered bonds? I don't even know what the hell that is.",
        "Will: Don't play me, Iris.",
        "Iris: Look, you know what, I didn't take anything. You're crazy!",
        "Will: You want to find out how crazy I am? Keep lying to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will's fine.",
        "Adam: How can you say that? After what he did --",
        "Gwen: You know what -- I don't know what happened not for sure and until I do I'm not going to jump to any conclusions.",
        "Adam: You're not even going to allow yourself to think that something may be wrong? That he may be unraveling before our eyes.",
        "Gwen: It's not happening.",
        "Adam: I've lived through it once before Gwen believe me, it can happen again.",
        "Gwen: You know, you want to stop talking like that. I don't understand it. He's not a crazy person!",
        "Adam: Okay, I sorry -- I guess he's just holding onto you and your life together anyway that he can. There's nothing crazy about that.",
        "Gwen: I didn't mean to yell.",
        "Adam: You love him.",
        "Gwen: So do you. I just don't want to believe it. I don't want to believe that he would intentionally hurt me like that.",
        "Adam: And if he did it unintentionally?",
        "Gwen: That would be worse.",
        "Adam: Yeah. You know, when I first came back here, and saw the way Will was with you, I was blown away.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Adam: The fact that you two were married for one. That he loved you so much and he wasn't afraid to show it. That was a big change.",
        "Gwen: From what?",
        "Adam: Well when he got out of the hospital, we didn't talk much. But when we did, it was kinda like he had checked out, you know? He wasn't really invested in anything. You changed him.",
        "Gwen: Well he changed me. You should have seen I didn't have anything or anyone. And he was there for me. And he never let me down. Not once. That's why this doesn't' make any sense. And I know there has to be another explanation.",
        "Adam: Like what?",
        "Gwen: I wish I knew.",
        "Adam: Hey, come on. Let's try to let it go. Try to relax.",
        "Gwen: Barbara. What are you doing here?",
        "Barbara: I've been looking all over town for you and Will. Where's Will?",
        "Gwen: I thought he was at the house.",
        "Barbara: I thought so too. I went there first. Adam -- why aren't you out looking for your brother instead of here, with his wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Does Gwen know you're pushing her mama around like this?",
        "Will: Gwen doesn't care what I do anymore.",
        "Iris: Did she leave you?",
        "Will: You know what, she'll be back. When she finds out the truth about what you did.",
        "Iris: I didn't do anything --",
        "Will: This place is a little too busy for a real conversation. Let's go for a ride just me and you.",
        "Iris: Stop -- stop it, all right. I'll tell you everything.",
        "Will: Why don't you start with $10,000 in bonds that you stole?",
        "Iris: $10,000? I had nothing to do with that kind of money!",
        "Will: I put the bonds in the safe last night at Crash. You followed me. You stole them. Admit it Iris.",
        "Iris: Oh, Will, I'm so sorry.",
        "Will: Not as sorry as you're going to be when you're back in jail.",
        "Iris: No, I'm sorry because -- you look like you're in a lot of trouble Honey and I just really can't help you because I didn't do it.",
        "Will: Yeah, right.",
        "Iris: No, it's the honest to God's truth. I -- there's no way I could have done that last night. I was in these back-to-back AA meetings and I didn't get home until late.",
        "Will: AA meetings? Is that the best alibi you can come up with?",
        "Iris: Hey -- I go to a lot of AA meetings, all right? It's a condition of my parole.",
        "Will: So why were you throwing back a drink when I walked in here?",
        "Iris: Well Will, see sometimes twelve-steps, it just doesn't stick with me. You see -- I don't know. I get weak. I mess up. I just -- what can I say?",
        "Will: You're lying.",
        "Iris: No, really I'm not! There's no way I could have been at Crash last night because I had all of these meetings. They're like a marathon meeting, see?",
        "Will: Prove it!",
        "Iris: Well, since you asked so nicely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I thought it might be illegal to hold onto it, not to show it to you seeing as Carly and Simon are basically fugitives now. At least it sounds like Carly's safe.",
        "Jack: He doesn't even mention her.",
        "Katie: Well he says he's happy. I think if she'd left him, he wouldn't be so happy.",
        "Jack: Postmarked Australia.",
        "Katie: Yeah, that must be where they're hiding out.",
        "Jack: It's a big continent. He's got a lot of contacts. I wouldn't be surprised if he mailed the letter from there and he and Carly are hiding out someplace else.",
        "Katie: It sounds like something he would do.",
        "Jack: Why you so upset about this Katie? It's not like you're selling Simon down the river. We don't know any more about where they're hiding out now than we did before.",
        "Katie: I don't care really anymore if he ever gets caught, I just want Mike back!",
        "Jack: I thought that had already happened.",
        "Katie: It did -- for a little while. And then Mike found this letter that Simon wrote me before I had a chance to talk to him and he thought I was hiding it from him.",
        "Jack: Oh --",
        "Katie: He said he could never trust me again. So I've pretty much lost him forever.",
        "Jack: Oh, I doubt that. I doubt that -- you and Mike you have something special. He'll be back.",
        "Katie: Not this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: The gunman's wife, that is her chart isn't it?",
        "Meg: I was about to file it.",
        "Craig: But you thought you'd second-guess yourself first? Maybe throw in a little self-pity, with a dash of railing at the fates about how unfair it all is?",
        "Meg: My patient died. I don't have a right to feel sad it?",
        "Craig: Meg you've been a nurse for a long time. I assume you've lost patients before.",
        "Meg: A few.",
        "Craig: But this one -- she's haunting you. Why?",
        "Meg: I don't owe you any explanation, Craig.",
        "Craig: Of course you do. I saved you from that mad gunman, remember? So you owe me more than an explanation. You owe me your life.",
        "Meg: I don't think so.",
        "Craig: Dinner, then?",
        "Paul: Hello. Can I talk to you? If you're busy maybe I'll talk to you later.",
        "Craig: Crystal ball whispering to you again, Paul?",
        "Paul: It's more of a scream than a whisper. It's really scary actually.",
        "Craig: For a big, brave guy like you?",
        "Meg: Craig was just leaving. Weren't you, Craig?",
        "Craig: I'll be back.",
        "Meg: He was baiting you.",
        "Paul: Oh yeah, what else is new?",
        "Meg: You didn't jump down his throat. That's new.",
        "Paul: Craig Montgomery doesn't scare me nearly as much as unwanted messages from the great beyond.",
        "Meg: You had another one?",
        "Paul: No, but -- I've decided to stop fighting this -- gift or curse or whatever it is you want to call it. So, I checked myself in -- and they've given me every kind of test imaginable. I've had MRI's and CT scans and REM analysis -- whatever that is.",
        "Meg: Did you get the results yet?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I have a screw loose. But it's a very tiny screw -- it's so tiny in fact that it has no magnetic resonance.",
        "Meg: So there's nothing wrong with you. That's good news.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and the visions have stopped for now.",
        "Meg: So whatever caused these visions -- they're gone.",
        "Paul: For now. But I'd like to help you. So can I hold your hand?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: Well you want to find out why the patient died. I want to help you so -- so let me touch you.",
        "Meg: No! Don't touch me!",
        "Paul: Look you asked me to help you.",
        "Meg: You misunderstood me.",
        "Paul: You wanted to find out how the gunman's wife died.",
        "Paul: Look you asked me to help you.",
        "Meg: You misunderstood me.",
        "Paul: You wanted to find out how the gunman's wife died. What's to misunderstand?",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you to do that.",
        "Paul: What's the big deal? Look I see things and you need something seen.",
        "Meg: Okay well do you want to keep having these visions?",
        "Paul: No -- it's like my own personal horror movie? But Meg if it will help you get to the truth --",
        "Meg: I changed my mind. They're performing an autopsy right now. That'll tell me everything I need to know.",
        "Paul: Why are you acting so weird?",
        "Meg: I'm not acting weird you don't need to come to my rescue Paul. We're not engaged. We're not anything anymore.",
        "Paul: We're not friends?",
        "Meg: Of course we're friends.",
        "Paul: Then let me help you.",
        "Meg: Why -- why so you can use your so called powers to get close to me? So I will need you? That won't work. I don't need anything from you, Paul.",
        "Craig: All through here, Meg?",
        "Paul: Yeah, so it seems. If you ever do need anything --",
        "Meg: I can handle it myself.",
        "Paul: Anything at all.",
        "Meg: Thanks Paul.",
        "Craig: He upset you.",
        "Meg: Yeah, exes do that. You should know.",
        "Craig: Is that all it is? Ex-lover syndrome?",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Craig: You sure?",
        "Meg: Could we just leave this alone?",
        "Craig: I'm just trying to learn from Paul's mistakes, strengthen my advantage.",
        "Meg: You have no advantage with me.",
        "Craig: But if Paul said something that got to you, like asking questions about your dead patient and why her gun-toting husband singled you out -- I'd want to know about that.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Craig: So I can make it all better.",

        "[Door slamming]",
        "Jack: Hey, Parker. Can I get you something?",
        "Parker: I just wanted a soda.",
        "Jack: Okay, no caffeine. Not this late.",
        "Parker: Whatever.",
        "Jack: Are you going to say hi to Katie?",
        "Parker: Hello.",
        "Jack: You hungry? I could fix you something.",
        "Parker: You don't have to act innocent and everything. I mean I saw what you were doing.",
        "Katie: Oh no, no, no -- we weren't doing anything.",
        "Jack: Parker you know what's going on here. I am not seeing anybody. Not Katie, not Vienna, no one.",
        "Parker: You just like to keep them hanging all over you.",
        "Katie: No, no I was very upset -- and your dad was just being really sweet.",
        "Jack: Katie, you don't have to explain yourself. Parker knows that nothing really was going on, right?",
        "Parker: I guess. Since she's married. What did I say?",
        "Jack: Nothing Parker. Why don't you go on up -- I'll be up in a minute to say good night.",
        "Katie: Parker wait listen -- I just wanted to say that I'm so sorry about everything that's happened with your mom. I know you miss her.",
        "Parker: And I know what you are. You're a liar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Getting my money back, getting you to admit that you set this whole thing up, that's all that matters cause that's what it's going to take for Gwen to believe me and you know what, I don't really care, if it doesn't happen I'm so crazy, who knows what I'll do.",
        "Sponsor: Iris!",
        "Iris: Oh Bets, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Sponsor: What are you doing here? In a bar? Come on, have you slipped?",
        "Iris: Yeah, I kind of did.",
        "Sponsor: Come on you were doing so well.",
        "Will: Yeah, I bet she was.",
        "Iris: Betsy, this is my son-in-law. Will Munson.",
        "Sponsor: How do you do?",
        "Will: This is your sponsor? You could have called anybody.",
        "Iris: She's legit take a look at her! Betsy, remember how we went to all of those meetings last night? You know those like four back-to-back meetings?",
        "Sponsor: What about it?",
        "Iris: I need you to tell Will I was there. With you.",
        "Sponsor: Why?",
        "Iris: Please -- I just need you tell him that okay?",
        "Sponsor: You know the rules Iris anonymity is number one. I can't violate that.",
        "Iris: Well, anonymity is going to land me back in jail and I don't want any part of it. Betsy please, I'm begging you! Please, just tell him I was there with you.",
        "Sponsor: Iris -- Iris was having a tough time, so we stayed through several meetings until she felt more in control.",
        "Will: This is your proof? You could have called anyone to back up your alibi.",
        "Sponsor: What's going on here? Are you in trouble?",
        "Iris: Yeah, I think I might be. See, but I don't blame Will for not believing me. I've done some bad things to him and my daughter, but not this time.",
        "Sponsor: Iris was at those meetings. If you don't believe me, I'll put you in touch with other people who can vouch for her.",
        "Will: Okay, I'll take the list. With phone numbers.",
        "Sponsor: I'll get my book.",
        "Will: Thank you.",
        "Iris: You were so full of yourself. Now there's no way you can pin it on me.",
        "Will: I'll find a way. I know you did this, Iris.",
        "Iris: You're just going to have to face the facts, Willy-boy. You didn't need help in losing Gwen. You did it all on your lonesome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: We don't know where my brother is.",
        "Barbara: Did you and Will have a fight?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: About what? Him?",
        "Gwen: The bonds that you gave us were stolen from Crash.",
        "Barbara: I knew something had happened. I got a phone call from my banker. She said someone was inquiring about the serial numbers on the bonds.",
        "Gwen: One of them turned up at the house and we wanted to check it out.",
        "Barbara: But they were stolen at Crash --",
        "Adam: Yeah, then how did one of them end up back at Will and Gwen's place. That's what we were trying to figure out. That's why we called your banker.",
        "Barbara: Do you think Will did this?",
        "Gwen: This is between Will and me.",
        "Barbara: Did you accuse him of it? Why?",
        "Gwen: He knew that we needed those bonds in order to finish the demo. And maybe he didn't want that to happen.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no! That doesn't make any sense at all! He hates taking money from me! He hates being indebted to me. You know that! Otherwise he never would have done it. Did you call the police, Gwen?",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Barbara: After you found the bond at your place, did you call the police?",
        "Gwen: No, I didn't even think about that. I mean, why would I?",
        "Barbara: That's good. That's good.",
        "Gwen: What are you doing?",
        "Barbara: I'm going to write you out a check.",
        "Gwen: Barbara, I don't want that.",
        "Adam: Well no, wait, wait, wait. Hear her out.",
        "Barbara: This way you can finish your demo and no one -- not even the police will know about this mess.",
        "Gwen: I'm not calling the police, Barbara. I would never do something like that.",
        "Barbara: You listen to me, all right? I know how good you are for my son and he can be good for you too.",
        "Gwen: He is.",
        "Barbara: I know my son. And I know how important your happiness is to him. And you know what, as far as the bonds go, its money. It doesn't matter. What's important is you and Will. That's what's important here and if financing your demo is all that stands between the two of you. Please, take my check.",
        "Adam: Thanks, Barbara. Very generous of you.",
        "Gwen: Adam, we can't --",
        "Adam: We can't what? Can't finish the demo? Can't follow through on what you keep telling me Will wants just as much as you do? What we can't do is throw this away, Gwen.",
        "Iris: Oh, Gwen. I heard what happened to the money and your project. Honey, I am so sorry. What the hell's going on here?",
        "Barbara: We were having a private conversation.",
        "Iris: Well, this is my daughter. And if you think I'm not going to comfort her in her time of need --",
        "Gwen: Mom, Mom please --",
        "Iris: It was Gwen's rotten luck to get stuck with that son of yours.",
        "Barbara: Excuse me?",
        "Iris: Oh you heard me the first time, Barbie. Will was trying to get me to take the fall for him!",
        "Gwen: What were you doing looking for Will?",
        "Iris: Honey, I wasn't looking for Will. More like he found me and tried to muscle me into a confession!",
        "Gwen: What are you talking about?",
        "Iris: Honey, lucky for me, I didn't do it. But he wants you to think that I did!",
        "Barbara: Listen to you, you felon!",
        "Iris: Oh Honey, like you haven't seen the wrong side of a jail cell. Huh? Like Mommy, like son.",
        "Gwen: Mom, shut up.",
        "Iris: No, I am gonna tell it like it is, Honey. Will was so jealous of my baby's talent that he wanted to take away the biggest opportunity of her life!",
        "Adam: Okay, I think we've heard enough. Let me show you the door, Iris.",
        "Iris: What? You should be kicking her out!",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry about her.",
        "Barbara: What she does is not your responsibility.",
        "Gwen: Barbara about the money --",
        "Barbara: Honey, I just want you to get back into the recording studio. This is my pleasure. There's just one thing I want you to guarantee for me in return.",
        "Gwen: Barbara, the demo's gonna be good. I promise you, it's a small investment, Adam's amazing --",
        "Barbara: No, no, it's not about that. I just want you to promise me that you're going to save your marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Apologize, Parker. Now.",
        "Katie: No, no, it's okay.",
        "Jack: No, it isn't. Apologize.",
        "Parker: I'll say it if you make me. But I'm not sorry for what I said because it's true. She is a liar. I saw your book. And I saw what you wrote about my mom.",
        "Jack: How did you get hold of a copy of Oakdale Confidential?",
        "Parker: Some kids at school. They were saying things. Calling my mom names.",
        "Jack: What other people say doesn't matter.",
        "Parker: I know, but they kept saying it. Even when I tried to blow it off. Then this girl, Larissa, she brought in her mother's copy of your book. And right there where anyone could see it was everything that people were saying about my mom --",
        "Katie: Listen, Parker, what I wrote it's just a novel. It's fiction. I didn't expect anyone to believe it.",
        "Parker: Then why did you use my mom's real name? And Jack's? Everyone knew who you were writing about.",
        "Katie: Okay, well that was my mistake. But I was just making a bunch of stuff up.",
        "Parker: No, you weren't. My mom did everything that you wrote in that book. That's why she got arrested and she was going to jail!",
        "Jack: Parker!",
        "Parker: She wrote about it and its true!",
        "Jack: No, it isn't.",
        "Parker: So Mom didn't steal those diamonds? Then why did she run?",
        "Jack: She went into business with Simon. Yes. And when things went wrong she made a lot of bad choices. But that doesn't make her a bad person. It doesn't. You understand? Apologize to Katie.",
        "Parker: What for?",
        "Jack: For being rude. For calling her a liar.",
        "Parker: She is a liar. She said she's sorry Mom left, but she's isn't.",
        "Jack: Parker --",
        "Parker: She's also a liar about saying that she's sorry that she wrote that book. So you can believe her if you want to, but I'm not going to and you can't make me!",
        "Jack: Parker -- hey, Parker!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What are you going to do, Craig? Turn back time? Bring Sarah Shaughnessy's back to life? Even you can't do that.",
        "Craig: I can listen.",
        "Meg: Since when?",
        "Craig: Meg, there are two things that you can be sure of with me. One, I won't judge you.",
        "Meg: And the other?",
        "Craig: Whatever you've done, I've done worse. So talk to me.",
        "Meg: Craig --",
        "Craig: Yes?",
        "Meg: There's two things you can be sure of with me. One, I do have deep, dark secrets. And two --",
        "Craig: You're not going to share them with me.",
        "Meg: Smart man.",
        "Bob: Meg, I just got some disturbing information about Mrs. Shaughnessy.",
        "Meg: Did you find out why she died?",
        "Bob: Yes. And since you were part of it, I thought you'd like to be the first to know.",
        "Craig: I'll leave you two to your business. Meg, I'll be in touch.",
        "Meg: What's going on?",
        "Bob: As you know, we performed an autopsy.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Bob: Well, the autopsy revealed evidence -- biochemical evidence, of anaphylactic shock. It was caused by a medication that was administered to the patient that was not charted as an allergen.",
        "Meg: And since I took her history -- well, it sounds like the findings are pretty conclusive.",
        "Bob: Yes, Mrs. Shaughnessy died because of the medication that we gave her here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: When I wrote that stuff in my book about Simon and Carly stealing the diamonds -- I did make it up, Jack. I had no idea they had really done it.",
        "Jack: I know.",
        "Katie: But if I would have just left it at that, it would have been fine. People would have gossiped a little bit, but nobody would've taken my book seriously. Instead, I had to push and push and push.",
        "Jack: Katie, you were just doing what you thought was right.",
        "Katie: Come on, Jack. You and I both know why I did it. I wanted to get back at Simon for choosing Carly over me.",
        "Jack: And her? Because he loved her?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Yeah, and the entire time I had the greatest guy in the world. I didn't care I wanted more. Parker's right to hate me.",
        "Jack: Parker's angry all the time. JJ's in overdrive trying to keep everybody happy and Sage -- doesn't understand why her mother left her. I don't understand it either, to tell you the truth.",
        "Katie: Jack, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? What can I do?",
        "Jack: You know, there is something and I hate to ask you this.",
        "Katie: No, please, ask me! What is it?",
        "Jack: I need you to stay away from the kids. Parker has read the book now, I know JJ's read it. And Sage -- she's probably heard some things.",
        "Katie: No, right, right.",
        "Jack: Listen, I know -- and I know it's not your fault, Katie, but --",
        "Katie: No, its okay you want me to keep clear of the kids. It's fine. I totally, totally understand. I don't want to hurt them anymore than I already have.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Katie: What about you?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry?",
        "Katie: You know, if I run into you at Java or the police station. Do I have to stay away from you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: You're overplaying our hand, Iris. If you make Gwen suspicious and she starts to think that we're behind this --",
        "Iris: Hey, I didn't steal those bonds. And I wasn't about to let Will pin it on me.",
        "Adam: Look, I understand that, okay? But you can't create scenes like this.",
        "Iris: I did everything that you told me to do. You told me to sneak into Gwen's house and put that bond right where she was going to find it, and I almost got caught doing it!",
        "Adam: Great, you did your part. I did mine. Now what do you want from me?",
        "Iris: Barbara gave you that check? I want my cut. And I want it now.",
        "Adam: You want me to tear off a corner and give it to you? I gotta cash it first, Iris.",
        "Iris: Yeah, well, then hurry up and do it!",
        "Adam: You'll get what you're after, but only if you play this my way.",
        "Iris: Don't you even think you can gyp me, Squirt!",
        "Adam: I'm trying to make sure that neither one of us gets caught! You gotta lay low for a while.",
        "Iris: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Adam: Hey, you want to go back to jail?",
        "Iris: Hey, you want to join me?",
        "Adam: Learn to control yourself. And stay away from the booze. It makes you stupid.",
        "Iris: Excuse me?",
        "Adam: And stay away from me.",
        "Iris: Oh Honey, I got no problem doing that. You just cash that check and get it to me!",
        "Gwen: You were using the money as a bribe.",
        "Barbara: I was just trying to help.",
        "Gwen: You don't need to pay me to stay with your son, Barbara. I love him.",
        "Barbara: Honey, sometimes love is not enough. You two are still getting to know each other. Trying to figure out who you are. What it is you want.",
        "Gwen: I don't want your money.",
        "Barbara: But you want this singing career and you want Will. Don't you?",
        "Gwen: Yes, but your money --",
        "Barbara: And if he's made an error in judgment is that reason enough to throw it all away?",
        "Gwen: If he could hurt me like that --",
        "Barbara: If he's done anything wrong, Gwen, it's my fault. Because I made too many mistakes with him. I smothered him with my neediness. I stole his childhood. I let so many things happen to him that it's a miracle that he can love anyone at all, but he does, he loves you. And he's clearly so afraid of losing you.",
        "Gwen: Is that supposed to make me feel better? He's afraid of losing me, so he betrays me and then lies about it?",
        "Barbara: Honey, Honey could you try to understand why he might behave like this? Think about what he's been through this year. First he lost his sister -- then he lost his father.",
        "Gwen: I know. And I want to be there for Will, but I can't be everything to him.",
        "Barbara: No one expects you to be. And when this all straightens up, things will be fine. He's just afraid right now.",
        "Gwen: Why are you pushing this so hard? Why can't you just let us figure it out on our own?",
        "Barbara: Because I'm afraid there might not be enough time for that. In the past, when Will was afraid that he was going to lose someone close to him -- fear can drive people to do desperate things, you know.",
        "Gwen: Are you talking about what happened with Rose d'angelo again.",
        "Barbara: He didn't mean to hurt her any more than he's meant to hurt you.",
        "Gwen: You really think he did it. You think he stole the money.",
        "Barbara: I think he needs time. And I think he needs a woman who can love him as much as you do. You've made all the difference to him. You've given him happiness, please don't take that away from him.",
        "Adam: Barbara, maybe you should go now.",
        "Barbara: Take the money, Honey.",
        "Adam: Of course we will.",
        "Barbara: Thank you for loving my son.",
        "Gwen: His own Mom thinks he stole those bonds, Adam.",
        "Adam: Whether he did or not, does it really matter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Seeing you reminds me of some good things too. I know it wasn't your fault that Carly left.",
        "Katie: So if I want to call you sometime to grab a burger or something?",
        "Jack: A burger?",
        "Katie: Salad?",
        "Jack: Salad?",
        "Katie: Okay, no eating for awhile.",
        "Jack: It's just -- I've got a lot to deal with here.",
        "Katie: I was just trying to get even with Simon. Trying to prove to Mike how much I loved him. Now I've lost them both and my friends too.",
        "Jack: If Simon hadn't sent that letter --",
        "Katie: You know what? I am so over blaming Simon and Carly for my marriage falling apart. I slept with Simon. I broke Mike's heart. If it hadn't been the letter, it would've been something else because the truth is, it wasn't Simon that Mike couldn't forgive -- it was me. Looking at my face every day reminded him of how much pain I put him through. I guess I have that effect on a lot of people right now.",
        "Jack: I really gotta go check on Parker.",
        "Katie: Okay. Jack, I really, truly am so sorry. Parker probably won't ever believe that --",
        "Jack: I do.",
        "Katie: Please don't stay mad at me forever. Bye.",
        "Jack: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hello? Hello? Hey! Whoever's here? Come out!",
        "Bob: You're taking this very hard.",
        "Meg: Because I was the one that filled out the admission forms. If there was an allergy and it wasn't noted then, I was --",
        "Bob: Meg, I'm sorry. Please excuse me. This in no way is your fault.",
        "Meg: Well you just said --",
        "Bob: The patient died from a reaction to a medication, but it was her own doing -- not yours.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, I don't understand.",
        "Bob: Well, the police went through her belongings and they found a diary where she stated how she intended to commit suicide by doctor.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Bob: She was going to hide her allergies, so that the medical personnel would inadvertently take her life. I mean it's a real tragedy but -- I'm sorry if this upset you in any way.",
        "Meg: Thank you for letting me know, Bob. Thank you very much.",
        "Bob: Don't mention it. Now get back to work.",
        "Craig: Coffee?",
        "Meg: Thanks. I thought you'd left.",
        "Craig: Bob looked so serious, I thought I'd better hang around in case you got fired I'd give you a ride home.",
        "Meg: No, I'm not getting fired.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I could tell that by the smile. So your troubles are over?",
        "Meg: They seem to be. According to Bob.",
        "Craig: Bob and that diary. I guess that's the last thing you expected.",
        "Meg: Were you listening to -- when I spoke to Bob? Because that conversation was confidential --",
        "Craig: Didn't hear a word.",
        "Meg: So if you weren't listening how did you know about the diary?",
        "Craig: How could I hear anything? I was in the cafeteria getting your coffee. Hot enough for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: Look, let's fast-forward just a little bit. Your album's just dropped and it's a huge hit. What's the first thing you want to do?",
        "Gwen: I want Will.",
        "Adam: You already have Will.",
        "Gwen: No, I want him right now. I made a mistake.",
        "Adam: How?",
        "Gwen: When I found that bond in our house, my head just started going -- I didn't know what to think. I didn't know how he could've taken it.",
        "Adam: That's understandable.",
        "Gwen: No, it's not. And I didn't really listen to him and I could see that he was so upset and that I should've listened to him. And now everybody thinks that he did this.",
        "Adam: And you don't? Be honest, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: You want me to be honest? I know what's true in my life. Will loves me, and he's my best friend. And I want to be with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Mom, now is really not a good time.",
        "Barbara: I think you'll change your mind when you hear what I've done.",
        "Will: I have to tell you something, too. It's about the registered bonds --",
        "Barbara: I know all about it. And I don't want you to worry. Everything is going to be fine.",
        "Will: What? What are you talking about? What did you do?",
        "Barbara: I gave Gwen a replacement check.",
        "Will: Why? Mom, why would you do something like that?",
        "Barbara: So she can finish the demo. Isn't that the idea?",
        "Will: Yeah, if that's the real reason why you did it. Unless you did it to replace the money because you think I stole it.",
        "Barbara: It doesn't really matter.",
        "Will: It matters, Mom! Gwen took money from you without even asking me about it?",
        "Barbara: Actually, Adam took the check from me.",
        "Will: But she was there, right? And she was just okay with it?",
        "Barbara: I can be very persuasive. Look, Will, Honey, Gwen loves you so much. And after she's had a little time to think this through, she'll see that you -- things just got a little out of hand.",
        "Will: I can't even --",
        "Barbara: Look, Will, all you have to do is you have to go to her. Get things back on an even keel.",
        "Will: Well, where is she?",
        "Barbara: She's at the dorm. Go and beg forgiveness if you have to do that. Adam's there too. Just trust me on this.",
        "Will: Let me get this straight -- you and Gwen and Adam sat down and had a little meeting about me. How I lost my mind again. How I'm out of control, I'm a thief, I started lying!",
        "Barbara: You're being unreasonable, Will.",
        "Will: You want me to be reasonable right now? I'm sorry Mom, but I can't! I'm the lunatic! I'm all screwed-up, right?",
        "Barbara: No, no I never said that! That's not true --",
        "Will: Well maybe you like the words that they used better. Poor, sad, pitiful Will. You know what? If that's really what you think Mom? You can all go to hell!",
        "Barbara: Oh, you! You who can stop this overreacting, all right! I didn't say that! Gwen never said that! Maybe I misspoke? I don't know.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "[Barbara leaves]",
        "Gwen: Will? It's me. Are you okay?",
        "Will: Oh, I'm great.",
        "Gwen: I need to see you. I want -- can we work this out?",
        "Will: You wanna work this out? Now you want to work this out?",
        "Adam: Gwen? It's okay. Its okay, I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Brad: Would you like to join us upstairs for a drink?",
        "Katie: I may be alone, but it's better than this.",
        "Paul: I have this feeling that something is happening. Something really bad and it's driving me crazy.",
        "Meg: You're not doing this to help me, your doing this so you can have me."
