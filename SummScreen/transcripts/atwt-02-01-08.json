        "Jack: We'll cover more territory if we split up. I'm going to check this way. You check out these stores here, okay? I'll meet you in the parking lot after.",
        "Carly: Okay. Parker! Stop, Parker!",
        "Jack: Hey, Guys. How you doing, huh? You, go home. Now! Parker, wow, you're busted. Huh, Buddy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: She fell right to sleep.",
        "Barbara: Just like her daddy. Just an angel. Just like he was.",
        "Gwen: Still is.",
        "Barbara: Well, I guess I'll get going.",
        "Gwen: Do you want to stay for a little bit?",
        "Barbara: I don't want to be in the way.",
        "Gwen: No, you're not at all. Actually, I just had a big craving for Java hot chocolate.",
        "Will: Well, I'll go get some.",
        "Gwen: It's not really good unless you drink it there, 'cause when you bring it home the whipped cream's already melted. It's kind of gross. Oh, I mean, we can go another time. Unless -- you want to baby-sit.",
        "Barbara: I'd love to.",
        "Gwen: Is that okay?",
        "Will: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waiter: It's freezing out there, Sofie. You're so lucky. You can just take an elevator home.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, it's great \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So you two have fun, and take your time. Hallie and I have a lot of catching up to do.",
        "Will: Did you two plan this?",
        "Gwen: No, I swear. It's not a problem, right?",
        "Will: No, not really.",
        "Barbara: She'll be fine.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, and I told you the extra bottles are in the fridge.",
        "Barbara: And the diapers are in the drawer.",
        "Gwen: Yes.",
        "Will: We won't be gone long. She'll probably sleep the whole time.",
        "Barbara: If she doesn't, I know what to do. Hey -- thank you very much.",
        "Will: Should we really be doing this?",
        "Gwen: I promise you, your mom can't wait to show us that she's the perfect grandma.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Henry. Perfect timing. Can you -- can you give me a hand?",
        "Henry: Yeah, would you mind telling me what the hell is going on here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Katie: Sorry! Leave it at the door or come back tomorrow.",
        "Vienna: It's Vienna. Open up!",
        "Katie: It's kind of late.",
        "Vienna: Please, Katie. I need you. Oh, wow. Get that goop off your face, get dressed and come with me. Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Whose idea was it to close the diner?",
        "Brad: It was mine. Well, using the diner was Vienna's idea.",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah. Why am I not surprised?",
        "Brad: This is perfect for a really special date with Katie.",
        "Henry: You know, I know this is an alien concept to you, Brad. It's alien to Vienna at times as well, but this is what we call a business. And in order to make money, the door has to be open for the paying customers! I don't even know why you're bothering anyway, because Katie does not want to be with you.",
        "Brad: You see, that's what she thinks she thinks. But deep down, she's crazy about me. See, she is in denial.",
        "Henry: What? Where are you getting this stuff?",
        "Brad: Vienna.",
        "Henry: Ah-hah. Okay. I don't know who's in denial, I don't know who's delusional, but you're both nuts!",
        "Brad: Henry, Henry, you know what? This is the perfect time, perfect place for me to tell Katie how much she means to me, okay? If it doesn't work out, fine. That's it. Then I'm going to leave her alone, forever.",
        "Henry: Seeing you rejected again, gosh, that might be worth losing a night's business. Yeah.",
        "Brad: She's not going to reject me. All right? She is going to love this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I am not setting foot out of this room tonight.",
        "Vienna: Oh, but it's an emergency. Henry and I have been fighting. It's very serious. Come with me to Al's and talk to him. You're the only one he will listen to.",
        "Katie: Oh Vienna, you two have fought before. You always make up.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. This is different. He is completely unreasonable. If you care about us the same way we care about you, come with me. Please, Katie.",
        "Katie: Do I have to?",
        "Vienna: Yes! Yes, do it for love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You can't just keep breaking the rules every time something doesn't go your way.",
        "Parker: Why not?",
        "Jack: Hey. Lose the attitude.",
        "Carly: Parker, listen to me. I know you're angry with me. I love you so much. I'll do whatever I can to help you. What can I do?",
        "Parker: You really mean that?",
        "Carly: Yes. I swear it.",
        "Parker: Okay. Simple. Get rid of Sam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay, come on, hide!",
        "Henry: Why? Why?",
        "Brad: Katie's coming.",
        "[Brad groans]",
        "Henry: You're killing yourself.",
        "Katie: I knew it. Henry already feels bad about your fight. He must have done this to make up with you. I gotta go!",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. Katie, wait! I have a confession to make.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, do I do what Parker wants? Do I fire Sam?",
        "Jack: Well, I'd be lying to you if I told you I wanted Sam to stick around -- but I can't tell you what to do with your life. And I don't think we should reward Parker's bad behavior by giving in to him.",
        "Carly: Right, no. I don't want him to think disobeying his parents is a good strategy to get what he wants.",
        "Jack: Okay, even if you let Sam go, do you really think things are going to change?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I just had this feeling that unless Sam is gone, Parker is never going to be reasonable. We have to give it a try. Parker has to come first, doesn't he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You have a confession to make?",
        "Vienna: It's Henry -- he terrifies me.",
        "Katie: Henry? Oh, come on.",
        "Vienna: The real Henry Coleman, he can be a beast when he's aroused. Can you go look for him in the kitchen? Please?",
        "Katie: This is the nuttiest thing I've ever heard.",
        "Vienna: Henry! Brad!",
        "Henry: Hey! I don't appreciate being called an animal even in a fake fight. Especially if it's not in a good way.",
        "Vienna: I called you a beast, not an animal.",
        "Henry: Oh yeah, right. So why are we playing cupid for Brad here? He's not going to force himself on Katie. It's a recipe for disaster.",
        "Vienna: It's a recipe for true love! And if you can't see that, then maybe our fake fight is real.",
        "Henry: Are you serious?",
        "Vienna: Yes. But we can't fight here. Good luck with Katie. Come on.",
        "Brad: I'm gonna need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Would you stop looking at your watch? Your mom's taken care of more babies than we ever have.",
        "Will: I know, but she's not acting herself tonight. She's bothered by something.",
        "Gwen: She wasn't acting like herself because everybody in town had met Hallie except her. It's good for her to see that we trust her alone with the baby.",
        "Will: You're right. But maybe we should call her just in case.",
        "Gwen: Stop. Stop worrying. I promise you, your mom and Hallie are going to be fine.",
        "Sofie: They didn't bring the baby. They must have left Hallie with a sitter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: Mm, you know what? As much as I'd like for us to lose ourselves, we really should get back to work. I mean, even though the doors aren't going to be open, there's still plenty to do.",
        "Kit: Oh, Baby, why don't you forget about work, huh? Sometimes a man and a woman just gotta unwind, you know?",
        "Carly: Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "Sam: Oh, that's okay. We actually, we were just starting to brain-storm about promoting the club. What do you think of open mic night?",
        "Carly: Sam. I'm so sorry. You can't work here anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I looked for him everywhere, Vienna -- Brad? What are you doing here? Where's Henry and Vienna? Oh. You set this up?",
        "Brad: It's just you and me. We have all night. Seriously, what's up with the money suit?",
        "Katie: I can't believe Henry and Vienna set me up like this.",
        "Brad: No, don't blame them. This was my idea.",
        "Katie: Can't trust anyone, huh?",
        "Brad: I have a beautiful evening planned.",
        "Katie: I was in the middle of something really important when Vienna dragged me down here.",
        "Brad: Okay, you know what? Just --",
        "Katie: I gotta go. I really --",
        "Brad: Wait, wait. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Just take a look at this fantastic meal. Vienna helped me. It's all your favorites.",
        "Katie: It does look pretty good.",
        "Brad: It would be a shame to waste. We worked really hard.",
        "Katie: I am kind of hungry.",
        "Brad: Be my guest. [Chair slides] I am really glad you're here. We have been through so much -- and uh --",
        "Katie: Is there any hollandaise sauce?",
        "Brad: Yeah, right here. These past few weeks, I've learned a lot about myself, about my real feelings.",
        "Katie: Mmm -- mmm, oh, this is delicious.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Is this Emma's recipe, or Vienna's? 'Cause you couldn't have done this all by yourself.",
        "Brad: No, I told you, I had some help. But my feelings for you are --",
        "[Dog whining]",
        "Katie: Whoa, what was that? Did you hear that?",
        "Brad: What? No. I didn't hear anything.",
        "Katie: Shh, shh. Right there again. It sounds like someone's crying.",
        "Brad: That's Henry and Vienna's dog, Pepper. He was running around, and you know, just getting his nose into everything, so I tied him up. Okay, what I'm trying to tell you how I --",
        "Katie: No, no, no. I am not going to concentrate on food when there's a dog suffering.",
        "Brad: He's not suffering! He's just tied up. He's got --",
        "Katie: I just want to make sure he's okay.",
        "Brad: Water and a stinky bone to chew on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: That's it? You're firing me?",
        "Kit: No, you can't fire him!",
        "Carly: I have to. I'm so sorry, Sam. You've been such a help around here. I really appreciate it.",
        "Sam: Great, great. But you're still giving me the old pink slip.",
        "Carly: I know that you and Kit are a team. I know that, I respect that.",
        "Kit: Then why are you trying to kick him to the curb without even asking me?",
        "Carly: It's my son. For some reason, he has a problem with Sam. And as long as Sam is still working here, things are only gonna get worse. Sam, I'm so sorry. I have to do what's best for Parker.",
        "Sam: Oh, I understand. I mean, your kid is what's important. I get it.",
        "Kit: No, wait a minute. I don't understand. You can't do this. I'm the boss, too.",
        "Carly: Maybe it's for the best, you know. It's not like you're making a great living here.",
        "Sam: Well, it's not about the money. I'm just trying to help Kit get her dream going, that's all.",
        "Carly: Maybe now you could think about accepting some of those offers you've been getting. You know, take your act on the road. Make a name for yourself.",
        "Kit: The road? Uh-uh. I just got back and you want us to split up again?",
        "Carly: No, I don't want that. I don't know what else to do!",
        "Kit: Okay, Carly, let me make it easy for you. If Sam goes, I go. And my money goes with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Look, I'm going to sound like a broken record here, but I really, I don't want to fight with you anymore. You and I -- we're alike in some ways. We're both stubborn, and we don't back down when we think we're right.",
        "Parker: Isn't that the way it should be?",
        "Jack: Well, don't confuse integrity with being bullheaded. Especially with people you love, you gotta learn to bend sometimes. Now your mother, she's doing what you want. She's telling Sam that he's got to go. It's not easy for her. Sam worked really hard for that club. She's making a huge sacrifice for you.",
        "Parker: She's going to be better off once he's gone.",
        "Jack: Okay, well, you won this round, Buddy. But you gotta give us something in return.",
        "Parker: What do you want me to do?",
        "Jack: Well, I want you to work hard in school. I want you to keep seeing this therapist. And I want you to help out around here. Bottom line, I want you to stop being such a bonehead to your mother and me.",
        "Parker: Honest, Dad, once that creep Sam is gone, things can get back to normal. I promise.",
        "Jack: Good. Then we have a deal? Come here. All right, go finish your homework.",
        "Parker: Thanks for believing me, Dad. Things are going to get better now. I promise.",
        "[Door shuts]",
        "Carly: Jack, we have a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Did you ever think that we'd be so lucky? That we'd have a family?",
        "Will: Yeah -- but I want to get home and rescue Hallie from Nana Barbara.",
        "Gwen: Well, let's just give them some time to bond, okay? Did you see your mom's face when she finally got to hold her?",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. She got really choked up.",
        "Gwen: She's lost a lot, will.",
        "Will: Maybe I was wrong keeping her from the baby, but I'm still not sure that we can trust my mom.",
        "Gwen: She just wants her kids, I don't know, to have like a perfect life. She doesn't always do the right thing. But her heart is in the right place. Let's just give her another chance, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Ms. Ryan. I thought Will and Gwen wouldn't let you baby-sit.",
        "Barbara: Well, they've had a change of heart, I'm happy to say. What are you doing here, Sofie?",
        "Sofie: You know, I just saw the light on and I thought I'd visit with Hallie for a couple of minutes. Can I come in?",
        "Barbara: No. You can't. I'm sorry. That's absolutely out of the question.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Are you a good boy? Who's a good boy? Did big old bad Brad have you locked up back there, you should be happy that Pepper is a forgiving pooch.",
        "Brad: Yeah. He is great.",
        "Katie: Aw, you were so lonely back there. Weren't you?",
        "Brad: Katie. Katie. Katie, like I was saying.",
        "Katie: Isn't he amazing?",
        "Brad: Yes, he is awesome, cute, cute, awesome dog. Look, can you just give me a second?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brad: You know, I want to talk to you. It's really, really important.",
        "Katie: What? Oh, sorry.",
        "Brad: I didn't know you were such a dog lover.",
        "Katie: Oh, I love all little animals, especially cute, little furry ones like this. Sorry, you were saying?",
        "Brad: Uh, yeah. Okay, as you can see, I went through a lot of trouble to get you here. And, um -- it's because, well -- you mean a lot to me.",
        "Katie: You mean a lot to me too. You're such a good friend. Well, most of the time.",
        "Brad: See that's just it. I like you more than a friend. You're --",
        "Katie: Wow! Whoa! You bad boy. Bad, bad, bad, Pepper. Bad, bad, bad, boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I am sure that Brad really thinks he wants to settle down with Katie, but he has no idea what that means. Because he is a -- he's a manimal, is what -- [Cell phone ringing] He's a manimal, that's what he is. And you're whole plan is doomed. Oh, look! It's Brad. His date must be going really well if he has time to give me a jingle.",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm.",
        "Henry: Hello, Brad. How's it going?",
        "Brad: Terrible. Can you and Vienna please come and get your mutt? He's hogging all of Katie's attention.",
        "Henry: Brad is being upstaged by our dog.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Come on, Pepper.",
        "Katie: I see you two made up. Traitors. That was a dirty trick.",
        "Vienna: Oh, come on, it was a little white lie. Just hear Brad out. To understand is to forgive. Come on, Henry.",
        "Katie: And you! I am disappointed in you.",
        "Henry: Katie! I swear! I'm an innocent victim in all this!",
        "Katie: Well, I guess since the dog ate my dinner, we should just call it a night.",
        "Henry: Yes. Would you look what you've done? This is a fiasco!",
        "Vienna: Well, come on. Let's go, Henry.",
        "Henry: No, no, let's just wait. Okay, she might forgive us if we give her a lift to the hotel.",
        "Vienna: No, no. No need for that. Katie will finish her date with Brad.",
        "Henry: What? Are you crazy? Did you see the look on her face?",
        "Vienna: Would you like to make a little bet?",
        "Henry: Well, you know I love to gamble, but this is a sure thing. And whenever anyone offers me a sure thing, I become very, very worried. What are you up to, Vienna?",
        "Vienna: Come on.",
        "Henry: Vienna.",
        "Vienna: Come on.",

        "Katie: I'm exhausted, Brad. I -- thank you. I'm just going to go.",
        "Brad: Change your mind?",
        "Katie: Door's locked. We're locked in. Before you know it, your carpet can look dirty.",
        "Katie: The back door's locked, too. We're trapped.",
        "Brad: Maybe it's a sign that this was meant to be.",
        "Katie: No, it's a sign that my friends are out to get me.",
        "Brad: Our dinner may have been ruined, but it doesn't mean we can't have dessert.",
        "Katie: I'm not really in the mood.",
        "Brad: It's your favorite.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's not fair.",
        "Brad: Strawberry cheesecake.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no, no. The good one with the little chopped up strawberries?",
        "Brad: Oh, yeah. Yeah, just the way you like it.",

        "Carly: I couldn't do it.",
        "Jack: Why not? I just told Parker that Sam was history.",
        "Carly: I know. I wanted to. I tried to, Jack, but if Sam goes, Kit goes with him.",
        "Jack: Let her go.",
        "Carly: I don't have the money to buy her out. And even if I did, I can't run Metro by myself.",
        "Jack: Okay, so hire someone else, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack! Did you hear what I said? I don't have the money!",
        "Jack: Oh, this is just -- this is great. You messing with Parker's head, you made me out to be a liar.",
        "Carly: I don't want to argue about it. I just want to find a way to keep our promise to him.",
        "Jack: I totally agree with you there.",

        "Barbara: I can't let you in. And the baby is asleep.",
        "Sofie: I just want to peek in at her. I'm her biological mother, I have a right.",
        "Barbara: I understand that you are, but Gwen and Will made no mention of the fact that you were going to stop by. And you know what the protocol is for visitation.",
        "Sofie: How can you keep me from my own baby?",
        "Barbara: I'm sure you can work something out with Gwen and Will. And I will say good bye right now, you're letting the cold air in.",

        "Barbara: Mm-hmm. It was a awkward to say the least. Would you mind making a phone call to her, and letting her know about protocol visitation?",
        "Bonnie: No problem. I'll give Sofie a call right now.",
        "Barbara: She's probably headed home to the Lakeview by now.",
        "Bonnie: Well, I'm at the Lakeview right now, so I'll just -- I'll just wait for Sofie and give her a little friendly reminder.",
        "Barbara: I appreciate it. Thank you.",

        "Carly: What about Brad? He makes a lot of money, doesn't he?",
        "Jack: No, no. No, no, bad idea.",
        "Carly: What? It's not a bad idea. Why is that a bad idea?",
        "Jack: 'Cause, Carly, I don't want to owe him for getting us out of this mess.",
        "Carly: I don't have any options, Jack. What am I supposed to do?",
        "Jack: You keep your word to your son, Carly. When I told him that you were letting Sam go, you should have seen the look on his face.",
        "Carly: So in order to make Parker happy, I have to give up Metro and forget about building a new life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Ooh, we should do a segment on Oakdale Now, that way we could taste- test them all.",
        "Brad: Or maybe we could do a show on romantic Valentine's Day desserts.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's a good idea.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: We have to have some kind of twist though.",

        "Brad: No! No, I -- I was trying to propose.",

        "Jack: Firing Sam doesn't mean you're throwing away your future, Carly.",
        "Carly: If I do fire him, and he and Kit leave town, you know that's no guarantee that Parker's going to stop acting out.",
        "Jack: No, it's not. Kids always find something to be miserable about.",
        "Carly: I alienate Parker if I don't fire Sam. And if I do fire Sam, then I lose everything that I've worked for.",
        "Jack: Okay, then talk to Parker. Tell him what you just told me. He's a smart kid. He'll understand what's at stake for you.",
        "Carly: I need you to be there with me when I talk to him. Would you do that? To back me up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Did you wake up? Yes, you did. You want to spend more time with your Nana, don't you? How's this feel? Does this feel good? Rocking back and forth. Oh, yes, your daddy loved that when he was a little boy. Oh, you are so sweet. You are so sweet. Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Sofie, hey, hey, can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Sofie: What about?",
        "Bonnie: Um, I just heard that you went over to see Hallie tonight.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Bonnie: No, no. But you did upset Barbara Ryan. She just thought it was strange that you, uh, that you stopped by unannounced.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I just wanted to see the baby.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, I know. I know, but the reason that we signed the adoption agreement was to avoid awkward situations like this.",
        "Sofie: It didn't have to be awkward. Barbara Ryan was rude.",
        "Bonnie: She had every right to refuse you access. Now, if you want to visit, just set up a time with Gwen and Will in advance. I think you need to take another look at the agreement that you signed, especially the section on visitation rights. I believe that it's very clear.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, you're telling me I need permission to visit my own baby.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, look, Sofie. I know this isn't easy for you. But Hallie is Gwen and Will's baby. You agreed to the terms, and you need to follow them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: So you didn't fire Sam, after all?",
        "Carly: I tried, Parker, but it's not as easy as I thought.",
        "Jack: It's a question of money, Parker.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right.",
        "Carly: It's true. If I fire Sam, Metro will go under.",
        "Parker: But you're the boss.",
        "Carly: It's not up to just me. Kit is my business partner, Honey. She gets a say, and she doesn't want Sam to go.",
        "Jack: Your mother needs Kit's money to keep Metro running. Sam and Kit, they go or stay together.",
        "Carly: We love you so much, Honey. We'll do anything we can for you, but this just isn't possible.",
        "Parker: You know, Dad told me you'd take care of this, but I should have known that you wouldn't have done what I wanted.",
        "Carly: I tried, Sweetheart.",
        "Parker: No, you didn't, or Sam would be gone!",
        "Jack: Okay, calm down.",
        "Parker: You know what, why should I? She's a liar!",
        "Jack: Stop that! Don't talk to your mother like that!",
        "Parker: So, you're going to take her side now? You know what, when you find out how much of a creep Sam is, you'll be sorry you didn't listen to me!",

        "Henry: This is crazy. We're losing a whole night's business. And we're out here paying for coffee out of paper cups in the cold to boot.",
        "Vienna: You and I have a bet. So we have to wait here and see who wins.",
        "Henry: Okay, I'm going to win. All right? The question is, when Katie leaves Brad in the lurch, which I know she will, what do I win?",
        "Vienna: You are bound to lose.",
        "Henry: How can you be so sure about that? Aren't you cold?",
        "Vienna: Oh, it's a small sacrifice to make for true love.",
        "Henry: I say phooey to true love, if I'm freezing when I could be warm.",
        "Vienna: You just hate to lose a bet.",
        "Henry: See, there it is again. It's a confidence there, I don't like it. I can only mean one thing, the fix is in. What have you done, Vienna?",
        "Vienna: I locked them in. We'll let them out in an hour or so.",
        "Henry: What? What? No! Foul! No. No bet! No bet! That's a -- how could you do something like this? That's not fair to Katie.",
        "Vienna: Everything is fair in love and war!",
        "Henry: Okay, maybe, but in gambling there are rules. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I wanted this to go so much better. I wanted you to wear the ring, not swallow it. I'm not playing any games here. I have never felt this way about anyone. Really. I've changed because of you. And you know, you made me want to settle down and be faithful to one woman, that's you. What I'm offering, Katie, is real. I'm not perfect, far from it, you know, but I'm trying. And I know that you didn't want to get involved with me, but it's not my fault that my name is Snyder. It's not my fault that my brother hurt you. I would never hurt you like he did. I swear. So, think about it. We could have a future together, if you'd just -- just give us a chance. All I want to do is to make you happy. I love you, Katie.",

        "Sam: You're sure? I want you to do what's best for Parker. You know, I don't know why he hates me. I really tried to be friendly.",
        "Carly: I know, Sam. But you know, I'm sure it has a lot more to do with me than it does with you. I'll handle it.",
        "Sam: I'm staying.",
        "Kit: Oh, thank you, higher power. What is with this kid, Parker, anyhow? What's he got against you?",
        "Sam: I have no idea. I think we deserve a cold beer after that close shave, what do you think?",
        "Kit: Aw, Baby, I'm in the program. Don't go tempting me with no beer.",
        "Sam: All right, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about that. I'm just glad that we're able to stay here together.",
        "Kit: Yeah, I know. You go ahead, you have your drink. I got some settling in to do anyhow.",
        "Sam: All right. That's fine. You know what, actually I got to do some rehearsal with Cowboy Jack.",

        "Cowboy Jack: A lot of good that will do ya, with Kit breathing down your neck every second of the day.",
        "Sam: Well, what do you want me to do? Kit's the reason why I'm getting to stay.",
        "Cowboy Jack: Use your head, dummy. If you can't be alone with Carly in Oakdale -- then take her away somewhere. Somewhere -- private.",

        "Henry: I swear, I had nothing to do with this. I had no idea what Brad was planning. It was Vienna.",
        "Katie: Well, then it's up to you to get Vienna under control. Tell her to stay out of my love life. I never want to be put in that position again!",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry for interrupting you and Katie, but Henry wouldn't stay away when he found out that I'd locked you two in here.",
        "Brad: Doesn't matter. It was a total bust anyway. You know, Katie's -- she's just -- she just too gun-shy. Thanks to my brother.",
