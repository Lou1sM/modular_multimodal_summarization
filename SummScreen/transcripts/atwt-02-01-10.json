        "Holden catches up with Damian on the docks and they have it out. Holden wants to turn him in, but Damian reminds him of how hard of a time Holden will have proving any of what he did. He taunts him about Lily's love of him despite it all. A guilt-ridden Molly tells Lily what happened, but Lily can't judge since she trusted Damian too. Lucinda is thrilled to hear Damian's gone, but Lily is riddled with guilt for allowing him near her family. Lucinda assumes now Holden and Lily will find their way back. Noah learns about Lily being hurt, but then he is forced to tell Luke about his agreement with Dr. Oliver. At first, Luke is very upset and wants him to reconsider, but then he realizes Noah has to take this opportunity to recover his sight, which upsets Noah in the end. Dr. Oliver is ready to move into Katie's; this frustrates Henry a great deal, which only eggs the doctor on. Henry pleads with Katie to reconsider; he can move in, but she doesn't want to risk their friendship and stands firm on her decision. However, later she researches the doctor online. Henry tries to make nice with Dr. Oliver as a ploy, but Dr. Oliver gets the upper hand, which makes Henry more frustrated. Later, after Katie waxes on about Dr. Oliver's accomplishments, Henry decides secretly to get rid of him. This is about the same time, Katie and Dr. Oliver are able to enjoy a bit of each other's company strangely enough. Luke learns the truth about Damian. Lucinda overhears Molly leaving a message for Holden, as she tells her that she is confident Lily and Holden will be back together in no time. A shaken Holden comes back to the farm with cut and bloody hands. He has memories of fighting with Damian and dragging him away. Holden later goes to see Lily and Luke and tells them that he let Damian go because he needed him out of their lives and he didn't want a trial dragging all of this back up. Luke tells Holden how lucky that he is that he is his real dad, but when he hugs Holden, he winces in pain. Holden covers saying he needs to go in Meg. Luke and Noah run into each other downtown, but Luke is afraid to share what happened earlier because he doesn't want to break Dr. Oliver's \u0091rules'. Noah wants to change his mind and not go down this road, but Luke won't let him, as he walks away. When Molly sees Holden, she tells him that she is moving to the Lakeview, but then she sees he is hurt and bloody. Holden gives her an excuse about cutting himself when he changed a tire, but combined with that and the pain she sees him in, she demands to know what happened between he and Damian because he doesn't make a good liar."

        "Damian: You can't stop me from getting on that ship, Holden, so do the smart thing here. Turn around and walk away.",
        "Holden: After everything you've done to Lily, to Meg? No way.",
        "Damian: Lily will be fine. You'll be right there, won't you, to pick up the pieces of her broken heart?",
        "Holden: Where is Meg, Damian? I swear, if you've done anything --",
        "Damian: I haven't seen your sister ever since the inn.",
        "Holden: I don't believe you.",
        "Damian: She's obviously not here, right? Your sister is disturbed, Holden. If you care so much, go find her and get her the help she needs.",
        "Holden: She was fine until she got involved with you.",
        "Damian: [Scoffs] You give me too much credit.",
        "Holden: No, you drove her crazy and tried to kill her, and then you tried to stuff her in that chest. And Lily --",
        "Damian: Lily chose me!",
        "Holden: Because you tricked her into marrying you.",
        "Damian: That's a lie. She couldn't wait to be my wife.",
        "Holden: And then when she found out everything that you'd done, you tried to take her out of the country, away from her kids.",
        "Damian: Lily wanted to be with me, and that just kills you, doesn't it?",
        "Holden: You know what? It's over, Damian. This ends right now.",
        "Damian: Killing me won't erase me from Lily's heart any more than I could erase you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I've loved Holden my whole life, just like you have. But the difference is Holden loved you back. That's why it felt different this time. This time, it really felt like Holden was open to the idea of moving on away from you, away from the memories of what --",
        "Lily: I don't want to hear this, Molly.",
        "Molly: Believe me, Lily, I really don't want to say it. I just -- I wanted him. I wanted him for as long as I could have him, so I lied, even though I know the truth always comes out. And of course, it did. Holden was furious and came running to your rescue, just like Damian said he would.",
        "Lily: What if Meg had died, or Holden? Damian pulled a gun on him, Molly. He was ready to use it.",
        "Molly: I know. I don't expect you to ever forgive me for this, but if it's any consolation, I'll never forgive myself.",
        "Lily: You made one mistake. I made the wrong choice a hundred times a day, every day, for months.",
        "Molly: Damian had us all fooled, Lily.",
        "Lily: Not Meg. And I just -- I wouldn't believe her. I mean, if I had, maybe I could have stopped Damian.",
        "Molly: Nobody blames you.",
        "Lily: I blame myself.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Lucinda: Lily. Thank heavens you're all right.",
        "Lily: What are you doing here, Mother?",
        "Lucinda: Holden called me. He told me that -- that you'd been brought in here by ambulance, that Damian is wanted by the -- the police. For heaven's sake, what happened? Are you all right?",
        "Lily: No. No, I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dr. Oliver cannot tell you who you can have in your life.",
        "Noah: Luke, he won't perform the surgery unless I stay away from you. I -- I don't have a choice. And if I ever want to see you again -- I mean it, literally see you -- I've got to do what he says.",
        "Luke: This has got to be some sort of ethical violation.",
        "Noah: He doesn't have to perform the surgery if he doesn't want to. He's not saving my life. And it may not even work. But if there's the slightest chance I -- Luke, I want to try, and whatever that takes, I'm willing to do that.",
        "Luke: What are you saying?",
        "Noah: I told him I'm okay with it.",
        "Luke: So you're gonna go through this without me? Noah, we are supposed to be partners.",
        "Noah: I know, I know, but --",
        "Luke: But? But what?",
        "Noah: Look, its only gonna be for a few months.",
        "Luke: So in other words, you're picking Dr. Oliver over me. Don't I get a choice? Noah, you are not the only person in this relationship. And you just met the guy. I don't care what kind of brilliant surgeon he is. He doesn't know what you need.",
        "Noah: I'll get by.",
        "Luke: [Scoffs] What about me? I need you, too, Noah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Um, who the hell is this guy?",
        "Katie: I just told you. This is Dr. Reid Oliver, my new roommate.",
        "Reid: You didn't say anything about a threesome.",
        "Henry: A threesome?",
        "Katie: Henry doesn't live here.",
        "Henry: No, I -- not technically I don't live -- I don't get my mail here. But, uh, I'm here a lot. I'm actually here almost all the time. I have my own key.",
        "Reid: So do I. And I will be getting my mail here.",
        "Katie: Uh, Reid, this is Henry Coleman, my best friend. Dr. Oliver is the one who prescribed the antibiotics for Jacob's earache.",
        "Henry: That's great. And now you're gonna move in with him? Do you think that's such a good idea?",
        "Katie: Um, yeah. I'll have a doctor in the house.",
        "Henry: You know, Oakdale is a small town. Why haven't I seen you here before?",
        "Katie: He just moved here.",
        "Reid: If you frisk me, I'm gonna expect you to take me out to dinner.",
        "Henry: [Laughs] What kind of doctor are you again?",
        "Reid: Brain surgeon.",
        "Henry: With a minor in pediatrics?",
        "Katie: Henry --",
        "Henry: Listen, don't you remember that doctor in England, the one that turned out to be a serial killer?",
        "Reid: Harold Shipman. I examined his brain as part of a neurological study into the origins of evil. Don't worry. I haven't used what I learned to kill anyone -- yet. I got to get back to the hospital. Why don't we do this later, just the two of us?",
        "Katie: Sure.",
        "Reid: I'll text you when I'm finished rounding.",
        "Henry: Uh, has he signed the lease yet?",
        "Katie: Not yet.",
        "Henry: That's great. That will save me the trouble of ripping it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I knew I could count on you to do the smart thing. This way, we all get what we want. I'll disappear as soon as the ship reaches international waters, and you -- well, you get to comfort Lily and Luke, track down your sister. You'll be everyone's hero once again.",
        "Holden: Wherever that freighter's going, Damian, you're not gonna be on it. You're gonna answer for everything that you've done.",
        "Damian: If you believe that, you're a bigger fool than I thought. You call the police, you'll be the one hurting your family now. Imagine what a trial will be like.",
        "Holden: For who? You? I don't care.",
        "Damian: No, Luke and Lily, Meg if you find her, sitting in a courtroom, reliving your death.",
        "Holden: Like you give a damn.",
        "Damian: Lily on the stand, talking about our marriage in explicit detail.",
        "Holden: Your marriage is irrelevant.",
        "Damian: You would put them all through that?",
        "Holden: I think they would do anything to put you away.",
        "Damian: And what if it doesn't work, huh? There's no guaranteeing I'll be convicted.",
        "Holden: You're guilty.",
        "Damian: It's one thing to say it, Holden, even to know it. It's another thing to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.",
        "Holden: Grady told Molly everything.",
        "Damian: Hearsay.",
        "Holden: So we'll put him on the stand.",
        "Damian: Do you really think he'll admit to taking a bribe? And even if he does, what does that do to his credibility? Juries don't like dirty cops.",
        "Holden: You tried to kill her. You strangled Meg. You left her in a chest.",
        "Damian: Are we talking about the woman who's been institutionalized for weeks, who tried to slash Lily's throat with a piece of broken glass, who snuck into our hotel room and attacked me with a syringe full of poison?",
        "Holden: Because you drove her to it.",
        "Damian: Or maybe just reacted in self-defense, Holden, to protect myself and my wife from a deranged fugitive. I only need to convince one person, and you know how convincing I can be.",
        "Holden: Once a jury hears that you paid Sharkey, you paid him to do things to Meg in that institution --",
        "Damian: You have no proof of that. And as for your unhappy, unfortunate, obsessed little sister, she's done nothing but help my case every step of the way. She's the very definition of a hostile witness.",
        "Holden: You're never gonna get away with this.",
        "Damian: The truth is, I stand an excellent chance of going free. Or you could do the best thing for everyone involved and let me get on the ship.",
        "Holden: Why should I do that? You'll just come back, like you always do.",
        "Damian: That's a chance you're gonna have to take, Holden, because if I stay, I will win Luciano's trust again. And Molly will need an ally if she wants to continue playing house with you.",
        "Holden: Shut up.",
        "Damian: And then there's Lily, my wife, the mother of my son. She's forgiven me before. She will again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: How are you, really?",
        "Lily: I'll live.",
        "Lucinda: No, Lily, you can't blame yourself for everything that has happened.",
        "Lily: Why not?",
        "Lucinda: Because this is the way Damian operates. He blinds people to his agenda. He casts spells. Look at poor, deranged Meg.",
        "Lily: So in other words, I'm just putty in his hands?",
        "Lucinda: That's not what I meant.",
        "Lily: Yes, it is. Damian can be very persuasive when he wants to be --",
        "Lucinda: We're not talking about persuasion. We're talking about manipulation.",
        "Lily: It doesn't matter what you call it, Mother. I made the choice to believe him. It was my decision to marry him again when I knew it was way too soon.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, it -- you were grieving the -- the loss of your husband.",
        "Lily: Don't, don't! Don't make excuses for me, okay?",
        "Lucinda: Okay. All right.",
        "Lily: You warned me! Emma warned me. Meg warned me. I've known for years the kind of man that Damian is. I married him despite all of that. I put him into my home, amongst my children, a mother. I made the worst choices. How am I ever going to explain this to them and ever regain their trust?",
        "Lucinda: You're going to tell them the truth. You are going to tell them the truth. Don't underestimate these children. They're more resilient than you think they are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, Damian left town, and the way he said goodbye, it sounded really permanent.",
        "Noah: Why did he leave?",
        "Luke: See, that's just it. I don't know. I went by his office, and he told me that I was gonna hear a lot of really terrible things about him and that I shouldn't pay attention to them. And then he gave me the company and said that maybe he'd see me again one day.",
        "Noah: What about your mom?",
        "Luke: Well, my dad said that she hit her head, but I think she's gonna be okay.",
        "Noah: Luke -- Luke, I'm so sorry.",
        "Luke: It's not your fault.",
        "Noah: No, but I've been so obsessed with myself, I've been completely ignoring you. You should have just told me to shut up and listen.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm telling you now.",
        "Reid: Mr. Mayer, I thought we had an understanding.",
        "Noah: We do, but Luke -- I can't push him away just because you don't like him. If that means that you're not gonna go through with the surgery --",
        "Luke: Noah, Noah, stop. I'm okay. Don't worry about me.",
        "Noah: No, but you shouldn't have to go through this by yourself.",
        "Luke: The most important thing is that you get your sight back. So don't worry, Dr. Oliver. I know the new rules, and I will obey them.",
        "Reid: Good.",
        "Luke: But that doesn't mean I don't hate you for keeping me away from Noah when we need each other the most.",
        "Reid: It's just sound medicine.",
        "Luke: Whatever. We'll do it your way because Noah thinks that you're gonna help him, but I hope you live up to your own hype. Otherwise, you have to answer to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Is it just Reid you have a problem with or the whole idea of me having a roommate in general?",
        "Henry: Just Reid.",
        "Katie: Why? You don't know anything about him.",
        "Henry: I know that he's very impressed with himself. I know you're gonna have to raise the ceiling to accommodate his head.",
        "[Katie laughs]",
        "Henry: See, I -- see? You agree with me. And I also think he's very insensitive to the feelings of others, namely me.",
        "Katie: This was your idea in the first place!",
        "Henry: No, it was not.",
        "Katie: Yes, it was! You agreed with me that it's hard to live alone, especially with a newborn.",
        "Henry: It is.",
        "Katie: So, I'm trying to make it easier on myself. What am I supposed to do? Sit here alone every night after I put Jacob to sleep?",
        "Henry: No, no, no! But you don't need Dr. McBrainy to keep you company.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Henry: 'Cause you got me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: It's your call, Holden. Let me get on the ship or turn me in to the police and take your chances with a jury.",
        "Holden: If you're so sure you'll get off, why leave the country at all?",
        "Damian: Because unlike you, I don't want to put Lily and Luke through a long, sordid trial. I'd do anything to spare them any unnecessary pain.",
        "Holden: A few months ago, you had no problem letting them think I was dead.",
        "Damian: I assumed you were, Holden.",
        "Holden: Based on nothing.",
        "Damian: Based on what I saw!",
        "Holden: What you saw was an opportunity!",
        "Damian: No. I saw your truck after the accident. It was nothing but burnt, twisted metal. Lily and Luke saw it, too, and they were devastated. So I made a decision. I decided to take care of them the best way I knew how.",
        "Holden: You laid claim on them. That's not caring. That's ownership.",
        "Damian: You never understood me, Holden. There's only one reason I do anything -- because I love my family more than my own life. Can you say the same?",
        "Holden: Lily and Luke aren't your family. They're your victims. You conned them into believing that you're capable of real love, but you're not, because you only care about yourself.",
        "Damian: If you believe that, you must think Lily's a fool.",
        "Holden: You took advantage of her when she was totally vulnerable.",
        "Damian: I know you like to think that. You would like everyone to think that. But the truth is, Lily married me out of love, Holden.",
        "Holden: She was overwhelmed, and you preyed on her. She didn't think I was dead till you lied to her about the DNA test. But in your world, the end justifies the means, doesn't it, Damian?",
        "Damian: Lily and I were happy together.",
        "Holden: Your relationship was built on a lie, and you used Luke to get to Lily. Thank God you didn't get her pregnant.",
        "Damian: Shut up, Holden!",
        "Holden: You wanted to trap her, 'cause that's the only way you could hold onto her. You wanted to take her out of the country, away from her family. But you know what? It's over, Damian. That's it. I'm gonna make sure that Lily and Luke turn their backs on you forever.",
        "Damian: You can't take my wife and my son away from me.",
        "Holden: I don't have to. You've done that yourself.",
        "Damian: No, no. I was there when Lily needed me. You had your chance when you came back from Kentucky. You could have fought for her, but you blew it! You walked away. And you will again, because you're not capable of loving without conditions.",
        "Holden: Is honesty too much to ask of someone you love?",
        "Damian: Your standards are impossible to live up to, Holden! That's why she's with me! Even after you came back from the dead, she chose to be my wife.",
        "Holden: Because you lied to her!",
        "Damian: Lily and I shared a bed and a life together. She wanted me. She still does, Holden. And as long as I'm alive, I will always be a part of her life, and I will always be Luciano's real father.",
        "Holden: You aren't Luke's real father. You never have been, and you never will be. Luke is my son in every way that matters. And once he finds out what you've done to his mother and to the rest of his family, he will never want to see you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: All Dad would say on the phone is that you hit your head, and now Damian's left town, maybe for good.",
        "Lily: You saw Damian.",
        "Luke: He asked me to come by the office, and when I got there, he was getting his passport and some papers together. He told me that he was leaving the country, and he left me in charge of Grimaldi shipping.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Luke: And he kept saying that -- that everything he did, he did out of love. Mom, what is going on? What did Damian do?",
        "Lucinda: Wait just a moment. Damian has left? He's left for good? Hallelujah. May he never darken our doorstep again.",
        "Luke: Grandmother, how can you say that? He's my father. And from the way things sound, I might never see him again.",
        "Lucinda: From your lips to God's ears.",
        "Luke: Why? I don't understand. Mom, how can you let her talk like that? Can somebody please explain to me what's going on?",
        "Lucinda: What's going on is that Damian has shown his true colors to everyone at last.",
        "Lily: Mother, please. Let me handle this.",
        "Luke: Look, I -- I don't want to be handled. I just want somebody to explain to me what's happening.",
        "Lily: I will, Luke, but not here. Let's go home.",
        "Lucinda: Wait a minute, Darling. Aren't you gonna have an MRI?",
        "Lily: I don't need it. I am fine.",
        "Lucinda: You don't know if you're hurt or not!",
        "Lily: Mother, damn it, I just want to go home! Luke, will you get my coat, please?",
        "Luke: Are you sure this is a good idea?",
        "Lily: Yes. I just want to go home.",
        "Lucinda: Where's Holden?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Lucinda: Well, Molly must have found him by now.",
        "Lily: She may have. I mean, they have plenty to talk about.",
        "Lucinda: Well, he's got more important things to focus on right now.",
        "Lily: Stay out of it.",
        "Lucinda: I'm glad you're well. Will you make sure that your mother gets home?",
        "Luke: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: Really glad that you're well. You make sure she's safe, right?",
        "Lily: Luke, I don't know what I would do without you.",
        "Luke: It just feels good to be needed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: We cannot live together, Henry. We're too close.",
        "Henry: Close is a good thing.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. You're my best friend, and I don't want to lose you.",
        "Henry: Then great. This way, we'll be together all the time.",
        "Katie: Yeah, fighting over the bathroom and who's gonna take out the trash.",
        "Henry: I -- I'll do the man jobs. I don't mind.",
        "Katie: No. I will do my own man jobs, thank you very much. I have made up my mind.",
        "Henry: Look, you know, this guy could be strange or -- or psychotic.",
        "Katie: Or insane, like you.",
        "Henry: No, he is nothing like me. He -- oh, my God. What if he doesn't like old movies, Katie? You know how a man is when he gets control of the remote. I -- it's not gonna be Tracy and Hepburn anymore. It could be the sports network all the time.",
        "Katie: We cannot live together, Henry.",
        "Henry: Why not?",
        "Katie: You know why. We almost lost each other after Brad died. We are friends again, and I don't want anything to screw that up.",
        "Henry: Like what?",
        "Katie: Like Brad. You living here would just be a constant reminder of what happened. I would be a reminder to you. Reid was not a part of that, so that's why he's perfect, because he doesn't -- come with all the bad memories.",
        "Henry: Okay, so, uh -- so you do like him.",
        "Katie: No, no. Are you kidding me? I didn't even sleep with Simon. Why would I sleep with a total stranger?",
        "Henry: It's been known to happen.",
        "Katie: Not to me. So, can you help me out later?",
        "Henry: Yeah, of course I can. Listen, if you even get the slightest, weird vibe from this guy, would you promise not to go through with this?",
        "Katie: I promise. Oh, before I forget, Jacob needs his antibiotics every four hours. The next one's at 4:00.",
        "Henry: Okay. Oh, and before I forget, would you ask Dr. Big brain if he studied babysitting at Harvard?",
        "Katie: As a matter of fact, he did tell me he was part of an infant study.",
        "Henry: As the control group?",
        "Katie: Goodbye, Henry.",

        "Molly: Hey, Holden, it's Molly. Um, yeah, I was looking for you at the hospital, but you were probably avoiding me. I don't blame you. I know I messed up, and I should probably just walk away, but I can't. You mean too much to me. I think you care about me, too. Just please call me. I'm here when you're ready.",
        "Lucinda: [Clears throat] I -- I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you. [Sighs] You've had your fun. A fling with Holden. Now it's time for both of you to go home. [Grunting]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm glad you're feeling better, thanks to Dr. Oliver. Yeah, and guess what? He's gonna be staying here, so next time you're not feeling well, we will have an expert right here in the house. I just Henry could be happier for us, but he just worries because he loves us so much. [Laughs] Yeah. You know that. And Dr. Oliver, he's -- well, he's -- [Groans] There -- there you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Dr. Oliver. Wait a second. Hey, I -- I know you heard me. Would you please stop, please?",
        "Reid: If you're here to challenge me to a duel, I left my sword in my other lab coat.",
        "Henry: No, no. I'm -- I'm here to apologize. Look, Katie -- Katie's husband died a few months ago, the same day that Jacob was born, actually.",
        "Reid: Ouch.",
        "Henry: Ouch. Yeah, ouch. And anyway, she's a little lost right now, and she's spending a lot of time alone, and for Bubbles -- that's this nickname I give to Katie -- for Bubbles, being alone is not such a good thing. So I'm -- I'm glad that you are moving in with her.",
        "Reid: What do you mean, lost?",
        "Henry: Well, how would you feel if the man that you love was shot and killed before he had a chance to see his kid?",
        "Reid: I'm not quite sure how to answer that.",
        "Henry: Well, you'd be a mess. And if you were Katie, then that would mean long crying, hysterical jags to like 3:00 A.M., and inappropriate laughter and sudden mood swings and rage and then smashing the dishes, which scares the beejeebees out of the baby. But you being a world-famous brain surgeon, I'm sure you can handle all that. Cutting into noggins all day, so you must have nerves of steel, which you are going to need.",
        "Reid: I sleep with earplugs.",
        "Henry: [Sighs] Great. Well, I tried that, too. Good luck, Doc.",
        "Reid: I don't blame you for wanting to keep a beautiful woman like Bubbles all to yourself.",
        "Henry: Don't call her that.",
        "Reid: Truth is, I'm rather moody myself. Even world-famous brain surgeons have needs. And with a hottie like Katie on the other side --",
        "Henry: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't talk like that. No, no, no, don't -- she's a -- she's a mother. You will scar Jacob for life.",
        "Reid: Babies are resilient. I learned that at Harvard. Don't worry, Uncle Henry. You can trust me.",
        "Henry: Why should I?",
        "Reid: You know, I don't know. Excuse me. I have some patients to see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I warned you, I think. I think I did. I warned you. Holden and Lily are inevitable. They are unsinkable. Molly, I'm sorry. You are just a seat filler in the theater of Holden's life, and your services are no longer required.",
        "Molly: Thanks, Lucinda, for your input, but that's really Holden's decision now, isn't it?",
        "Lucinda: Well, obviously, he's made it. I -- I'm sorry. I overheard it. He's avoiding you. He's not returning your phone calls. I mean, the silence is deafening.",
        "Molly: He is looking for his sister, Lucinda!",
        "Lucinda: Uh, I -- I think there's much more to it than that. If I were a gambling woman, I would say I'd put money on it you had something to do with all this unpleasantness.",
        "Molly: I made a mistake.",
        "Lucinda: That's shocking.",
        "Molly: But he knows it. He knows what happened, and he'll find his way to forgive me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no. Not even you believe that. No. Lily and Holden -- you can't fight it. All you can do is protect yourself.",
        "Molly: It's too late for that.",
        "Lucinda: You got to cut bait, walk away while you still have your dignity.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I just really thought that Damian had changed.",
        "Lily: We all did, Luke, and that's what's so --",
        "Luke: Evil.",
        "Lily: It's more complicated than that. Damian desperately wanted us to be a family, and he almost made that happen.",
        "Luke: Yeah, by manipulating us, Mom.",
        "Lily: Damian has always had demons, and when his back is against the wall, they come out in terrible ways. He will fight to the death for what he loves, and that's all he knows.",
        "Luke: You still love him, don't you?",
        "Lily: I hate what he did, Luke. I -- I just -- I can't turn off my feelings. It -- it wouldn't be love then. It's okay for you to still love him, Luke. He is a part of you.",
        "Luke: [Groans] I wish that he weren't.",
        "Lily: I'm glad he is.",
        "Luke: How can you say that?",
        "Lily: Because you are the most loving and wonderful son that I could ever wish for. Damian gave you to me. I will always be grateful to him for that.",
        "Luke: Do you think we'll ever see him again? Dad --",
        "Holden: The hospital told me that you checked out. Are you doing okay?",
        "Lily: Where have you been?",
        "Luke: You were with Damian, weren't you?",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Has he been arrested?",
        "Holden: No. I -- let him go.",
        "Lily: Why are you shaking? What happened?",
        "Holden: Damian happened.",
        "Luke: How could you let him go after everything?",
        "Holden: It wasn't the plan. But after I talked to you, I went to go find him.",
        "Luke: Where was he?",
        "Holden: He was down at the docks. He was trying to catch that freighter, just like you said. 20 minutes later, and I would have missed him.",
        "Lily: What happened when you found him?",
        "Holden: I wanted him to rot in prison for everything that he had done. I was about to call Margo, and that's when he said that if there was a trial that there was no guarantee he'd be convicted, so he asked me to let him go.",
        "Lily: And you let him?",
        "Holden: I -- I realized that if I didn't, he would just be hanging over us, and I didn't want that for you, so I agreed.",
        "Luke: He convinced us that you were dead. That's the only reason we ever stopped looking for you.",
        "Holden: I know that, Luke. He caused us all a lot of pain. I -- I still can't even believe what he did to my mother, but I just figured it was -- it was best, and we should all just move on with our lives.",
        "Luke: Is that even possible?",
        "Holden: Yes. That's why I let him get on that ship. That's why I let it sail away -- so that he would not hurt this family any more.",
        "Luke: Did he say where he was going?",
        "Holden: No, he did not, and I didn't care to ask.",
        "Lily: What about Meg? Doesn't she deserve justice?",
        "Holden: The best thing for Meg right now is that she never sees or thinks about Damian Grimaldi ever again.",
        "Lily: What makes you think he won't come back?",
        "Holden: He won't. There's nothing here for him, and he knows that.",
        "Luke: I'm sorry I ever trusted him.",
        "Holden: It's okay. He's your father.",
        "Luke: [Scoffs] No. No, you are my father, and I am so lucky for that.",
        "[Holden groans]",
        "Luke: What's -- what's wrong?",
        "Holden: Its okay, it's okay. I'm fine. Um, I -- I need to find my sister.",
        "Lily: You haven't found Meg yet?",
        "Holden: No. I just wanted to come here first and make sure you guys were okay.",
        "Lily: We are now.",
        "Holden: Good. Then I'm glad.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, Holden.",
        "Holden: Hi.",
        "Lucinda: It's so good to see you back in this house.",
        "Holden: Nice to see you, too. I -- I can't stay. I need to -- I need to go find my sister. Nice to see you.",
        "Luke: You know what? I'll walk you out. We left the hospital so quickly, I didn't get a chance to pick up your prescription.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Luke: Hey! Finally, all's well with the world.",
        "Lily: Is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Okay, I tried. I really tried. I gave the guy a chance. I did. But I don't trust him. I don't care if he did go to Hah-vard. I really don't. The guy is sleazy. He is sleazy, and you don't need sleaze right now. I will find you a roommate, Katie, all right? A female, preferably a nun.",
        "Katie: Could you be more over-the-top?",
        "Henry: W -- why, 'cause I don't want you living with a serial killer?",
        "Katie: He's not a killer. Henry, he's actually quite the opposite.",
        "Henry: How do you know that?",
        "Katie: Because I searched him. And it turns out that Dr. Oliver is one of the top neurosurgeons in the world.",
        "Henry: [Stammers] So? That doesn't make him a good roommate.",
        "Katie: We'll be fine! Besides, we probably won't even see each other that much, between his patients and the show.",
        "Henry: I thought you said you wanted a roommate so you wouldn't feel so alone.",
        "Katie: I think just knowing he's around will help. Besides, if you get too crazy, he can give you a home lobotomy.",
        "Henry: You know, you better clean out the freezer, because severed heads take up a lot of room.",
        "Katie: Don't forget to give Jacob his antibiotics. Be good to Uncle Henry, okay? He's a little -- fragile today.",
        "[Henry scoffs]",
        "Katie: Showoff.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hi.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Molly: Don't worry. I'm -- I'm not gonna make a scene. I'm moving to the Lakeview.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Molly: Okay?",
        "Holden: I don't know what you want me to say, Molly.",
        "Molly: I want you to tell me you don't hate me.",
        "Holden: I don't hate you.",
        "Molly: Somehow, I thought that was supposed to make me feel better. But surprise, it doesn't.",
        "Holden: I -- I don't follow.",
        "Molly: Just knowing that you don't hate me makes part of me want to stay and fight for you, but I'm so sick and tired of fighting for lost -- oh, my God.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Molly: You're bleeding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You're not gonna like this. It's really awful. I won't lie to you. You're just gonna -- no, you're just gonna have to hold your nose and -- and swallow, okay? There you go. There you go. There you go. Oh! Oh, there you go. Good. You just have to swallow it. There we go. Just like I have to swallow your mommy's new roommate.",
        "[Baby laughs]",
        "Henry: [Laughs] You're right. Maybe I don't. No, actually, I do not. I do not have to roll over for the good doctor. You've given me a great idea. If we can find a way, we're gonna get rid of him. How about that? Hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Did you bring the lease?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Um, didn't you want to talk about rent?",
        "Reid: Nah. I'm just gonna send the bill to Bob Hughes anyway. He owes me at least that for putting me on hangnail duty.",
        "Katie: What about neurosurgery?",
        "Reid: If I could find somebody in this town with a brain, I might consider it. But so far, no such luck.",
        "Katie: Oh, wait. Um, I need to know when you're gonna move in, because I want to make room for your stuff.",
        "Reid: I have no stuff. I was kidnapped and brought here against my will. I don't even have an extra pair of socks.",
        "Katie: Okay. I could take you shopping, you know?",
        "Reid: Eh, just point me in the direction of the nearest discount department store. I'll buy 50 pairs of underwear, 50 shirts. If I'm not in Dallas by the time I run out, euthanize me.",
        "Katie: Um, I do you have a washer and a dryer.",
        "Reid: Okay. Good. Well, if you could use biodegradable soap only, you know, that would be great.",
        "Katie: Uh, no, I'm not gonna be doing your laundry for you. I can show you how the machine works, then you're on your own.",
        "Reid: I don't have time to wash my shirts spin dry.",
        "Katie: Do you ever do anything but work?",
        "Reid: I went to Vegas once.",
        "Katie: Oh, did you have fun?",
        "Reid: It was a medical conference. If they have actual daylight in that city, I never saw it.",
        "Katie: For a guy who went to Harvard, you sure have a lot to learn.",
        "Reid: I guess it depends on the teacher.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Noah, what are you doing out here?",
        "Noah: Um, just waiting for Maddie. She went in -- in the bookstore for a few minutes. Is your mom all right?",
        "Luke: She has a bump on her head, but she'll be fine. The doctor called in a prescription, so I came here to get it.",
        "Noah: And what -- what about you? How are you doing?",
        "Luke: Uh, I don't want to get into it.",
        "Noah: I am sorry about shutting you out before.",
        "Luke: It's not that.",
        "Noah: What is it?",
        "Luke: It's just that if I get into it, I'm probably gonna break down, and then you're probably gonna want to comfort me, and before you know it, we've broken Dr. Oliver's stupid rule, so it's not worth it.",
        "Noah: I don't care.",
        "Luke: Well, I do. Noah, you don't understand how much I want to tell you what I'm thinking and what I'm feeling. But more than that, I want you to see again. I don't want Damian to mess that up, also. So, do you want me to wait with you until Maddie gets back?",
        "Noah: Oh, no. That's -- that's all right. I'll -- I'll be fine.",
        "Luke: Okay. Well, take care of yourself then.",
        "Noah: You too. Wait, wait, Luke, wait. This is stupid. You were right.",
        "Luke: I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: What was Holden thinking? Just banish Damian? He'll be back! He'll be back like a virus.",
        "Lily: According to Holden, Damian left because he wanted to spare the family from a trial.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, please. No, no, no. He didn't want to have to admit what he'd been up to. He doesn't care about sparing you. He only cares about himself. He certainly doesn't care about sparing the Snyders any pain. He hates the Snyders. Holden knows that.",
        "Lily: Mother, will you stop?",
        "Lucinda: What? What am I saying wrong?",
        "Lily: It's what you're not saying! I messed up. I didn't listen to you. I fell for his lies, and because of that, he was able to do horrible things to this family! But maybe he loved Luke and me enough to spare us one more humiliation and just walk away.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, please.",
        "Lily: Look, Holden wouldn't let him go if he didn't believe it was true. Why can't you just accept that?",
        "Lucinda: I want to. I -- I would love to. I'd love to believe that. The only thing that's gonna keep Damian from coming back for you is a stake through his heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: It's just a little blood, Molly. I -- cut myself while I was changing a tire.",
        "Molly: You got to clean it before it gets infected.",
        "Holden: You know what? It's fine, really.",
        "Molly: No, it's not. You're gonna ruin your shirt. Take it off and show me where Emma keeps the peroxide.",
        "Holden: You know what? I'll deal with it later. Right now, I should just take your bag out to the car for you. [Groans]",
        "Molly: You're really hurting.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I'm just a little tired. That's all.",
        "Molly: Tired isn't painful, and you're not the kind of guy that cuts himself changing a flat. Where did you go when you left the hospital?",
        "Holden: I went to see Damian.",
        "Molly: I take it you found him.",
        "Holden: Down at the docks.",
        "Molly: Is that how you cut yourself?",
        "Holden: You're always looking for a story, Molly, and there is no story.",
        "Molly: I may be a liar, Holden, but you're not. So tell me, what happened between you and Damian."
