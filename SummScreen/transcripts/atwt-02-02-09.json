        "Emily: Ali, Ali. Come on, what are you doing? Ignoring me? Is this because I asked you to stay away from Casey?",
        "Alison: No, and I don't want to talk about it right now --",
        "Emily: Ali, don't do this. Don't do that. Maybe I was wrong.",
        "Alison: No, you weren't. I only wish I could have seen it sooner, too. I could've saved myself some of the humiliation.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? What happened?",
        "Alison: You don't want to know.",
        "Emily: I do, I do. You're my sister. If you're upset, I want to know what happened.",
        "Alison: I didn't want to admit it -- especially to you. But I did have feelings for Casey. And now that I know that it was one-sided, I feel like a bad sister as well as a fool.",
        "Emily: Wait, how do you know Casey doesn't have feelings for you?",
        "Alison: Because he totally blew me off. Left me waiting for him like a loser.",
        "Emily: Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry.",
        "Alison: You have nothing to be sorry for. I just only wish -- I'd listened to you in the first place.",
        "Emily: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So? Tell me.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Luke: What happened with you and Alison?",
        "Casey: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Luke: What? How is that possible?",
        "Casey: Well, she shut me out, that's how.",
        "Luke: So the roof was a bust?",
        "Casey: What roof?",
        "Luke: The hospital roof -- where you met Alison.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Luke: Yesterday.",
        "Casey: Dude, I have no clue what you're talking about.",
        "Luke: You were supposed to go meet Alison so she could tell you how she feels about you.",
        "Casey: What? Since when?",
        "Luke: Since I thought you felt the same way and told her to go for it!",
        "Casey: How was I supposed to know about this?",
        "Luke: Jade.",
        "Casey: Jade?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I talked to Jade yesterday. She said she was looking right at you and that she'd give you the message.",
        "Casey: I did run into Jade yesterday, but she didn't say anything about meeting Alison. As a matter of fact, she told me that I should just take \"No\" as an answer where Alison's concerned.",
        "Luke: She what?",
        "Casey: Wait, wait, wait, if she knew Alison was waiting, why didn't she tell me?",
        "Luke: I think I'm about to find out. You wait right here.",
        "Jade: Oh, hey, Luke, what's going on?",
        "Luke: That's what I want to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: That's weird.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Dusty: Waking up to your face. It's been a while.",
        "Meg: Well, I was hoping not to wake you up at all.",
        "Dusty: Well, now you know I made it through the night.",
        "Meg: How are you?",
        "Dusty: Better -- better than yesterday.",
        "Meg: I know it's probably not easy for you staying here now that Johnny's gone.",
        "Dusty: Thank you and Eliza for staying over.",
        "Meg: Are you kidding me? You saved me from worrying about unwanted visitors at the farm. And Mama -- oh my gosh, she probably got her first decent night's sleep in a month.",
        "Dusty: Thank you for being here, you're a great friend.",
        "Meg: Am I as good a wife?",
        "Dusty: I didn't have time to find out.",
        "Meg: Well, it's definitely the shortest marriage that I've ever had.",
        "Dusty: Give me five minutes, I'll take you to breakfast.",
        "Meg: No, I'll have to take a rain check.",
        "Dusty: You got to be somewhere?",
        "Meg: I'm going to see Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Have you forgotten what Craig Montgomery has done to this family?",
        "Paul: No, of course not --",
        "Barbara: Then, how could you have helped him get Johnny away from Dusty?",
        "Paul: Dusty tried to steal my wife! There's no way he's going to get away with that.",
        "Barbara: Getting Johnny away from Dusty didn't win your wife back, did it? If anything, it alienated her more.",
        "Paul: It's always so nice to have your support.",
        "Barbara: I have already lost one grandchild because of your hatred. And I'm not going to lose Eliza, too.",
        "Paul: Well, neither am I. Which is why I had to expose Meg and Dusty's marriage for what it is. Or more specifically, what it's not.",
        "Barbara: What are you talking about?",
        "Paul: Well, technically, Meg is still my wife. And that's the key, Mom. That's how Meg and I are going to find our way back to each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Don't go see Paul. I won't let you.",
        "Meg: You're not my husband, remember? You can't tell me what to do.",
        "Dusty: This is nothing to joke about.",
        "Meg: I'll be fine.",
        "Dusty: You were always right to make a clean break from Paul.",
        "Meg: Except that's not what happened. He still thinks we have a chance. And, I need to get it across to him that we don't.",
        "Dusty: Well, how are you going to do that?",
        "Meg: By facing him. I have to make him understand that starting today, I am going to take necessary steps to make sure our divorce is legal, binding, and permanent. With limited visitations are strictly enforced and supervised.",
        "Dusty: Can't your lawyer relay that message?",
        "Meg: He's not going to believe it unless it comes from me.",
        "Dusty: It's not a good idea to see him on your own.",
        "Meg: I have to do this, Dusty. Please don't try and stop me.",
        "Dusty: Why put yourself in a dangerous position where Paul's going to be trying to change your mind.",
        "Meg: Whatever spell Paul had on me was broken in the hearing room. I stopped seeing the man that I wanted him to be and -- finally saw the man that he really is.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you leave Eliza with me? It'll be safer.",
        "Meg: You really don't believe that I'm over him, do you?",
        "Dusty: Of course. Be careful. When Paul sees the slightest opening, he goes in for the kill.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe I will leave Eliza with you. As long as you don't mind.",
        "Dusty: I don't mind at all.",
        "Meg: Okay, I already gave her a bottle but she still might be hungry. I meant to go down to the kitchen last night to get some more milk --",
        "Dusty: No worries.",
        "Meg: You really are a natural, aren't you?",
        "Dusty: All the good it did me. Good luck. You're going to need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. You're the last shoulder I should be crying on over Casey.",
        "Emily: It's okay.",
        "Alison: No, it's not. I lied to you. I told you I didn't feel anything, but I did. So, it probably serves me right that Casey's totally backed off now. I mean, it's so stupid --",
        "Emily: Stop beating yourself up. It's not your fault, okay? You had every right to think that Casey had feelings for you.",
        "Alison: I did?",
        "Emily: Yes, that's what he wanted you to think. Because that's what he wanted me to see.",
        "Alison: I don't understand --",
        "Emily: Ali, he was really upset when I broke things off with him. He wanted a future with me -- marriage, kids, the whole nine yards. Think about it, you don't just stop having feelings like that.",
        "Alison: So, you're saying he never got over you?",
        "Emily: Yeah, and what better way to get back at me for breaking his heart than to go after my little sister?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I mean, I never got the feeling that Casey was out to settle a score with you or anything.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know, but I'm not saying it was on a conscious level, you know? He's that immature he would do it without even thinking about it. I'm just glad you woke up when you did. Can you imagine if you had really fallen for him?",
        "Alison: Yeah, imagine that.",
        "Emily: I'm just sorry that I came down so hard on Ali. When you were nothing more than a pawn in Casey's game of revenge.",
        "Alison: I'll get over it. `",
        "Emily: Yes, you will. Just like Casey will get over me someday.",
        "Alison: I should go. I have to get to work.",
        "Emily: What do you mean? You didn't even order your breakfast.",
        "Alison: I'm not really hungry anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: When you saw me yesterday, you had already talked to Luke?",
        "Jade: Yeah, so?",
        "Luke: So, why didn't you tell him to go meet Alison? You couldn't have forgotten that quickly.",
        "Jade: Well, I didn't.",
        "Casey: So, you just decided not to?",
        "Jade: Yeah, pretty much.",
        "Luke: Jade, why would you do that? You knew how important it was.",
        "Jade: It's not like I didn't have good reason.",
        "Casey: I would like to hear one.",
        "Jade: Emily.",
        "Luke: Emily?",
        "Casey: What does she have to do with any of this?",
        "Jade: I was there, remember? When you almost busted down her door? You really ripped on her for getting in between you and Alison.",
        "Luke: All right Jade, can you just please get to your really good reason?",
        "Jade: Okay, I understand it's not Emily's place to tell you to stay away from Alison --",
        "Casey: Damn straight it isn't!",
        "Jade: But when I heard you guys, I realized it's not a good idea. It's pretty warped.",
        "Casey: Excuse me?",
        "Jade: You and Emily were married.",
        "Casey: Yeah? And?",
        "Jade: And it's too close for comfort, Casey. One of you was going to get hurt. And I didn't want it to be you.",
        "Luke: So that's it? That's your reason?",
        "Jade: Yeah, I was trying to help!",
        "Casey: Who asked you to?",
        "Jade: I was trying to be a friend.",
        "Casey: You know, friends like you, you just -- never mind. I got to go find Alison and make things right.",
        "Jade: Talk about ungrateful. What?",
        "Luke: What's the real reason?",
        "Jade: I told you. I was trying to spare him.",
        "Luke: Jade, I know you, remember? I know that you don't do good deeds unless there's something in it for you. And I want to know what that something is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Didn't waste any time assuming the role of step-daddy, did you?",
        "Dusty: I got to go -- the baby's hungry.",
        "Emily: You're going to save her day, too, aren't you? Aren't you at least going to thank me?",
        "Dusty: For what?",
        "Emily: For giving you the brilliant idea of getting married in the first place.",
        "Dusty: Turns out it wasn't so brilliant.",
        "Emily: Don't tell me -- what? Meg has a dark past, too?",
        "Dusty: No, she doesn't need one. She's got Paul.",
        "Emily: What did Paul do? Storm the church and refuse to forever hold his peace?",
        "Dusty: No, he stormed my son's hearing. He told the judge that there was a glitch with the divorce which means Meg and I were never legally married.",
        "Emily: Was he right?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I lost my son.",
        "Emily: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I bet you are.",
        "Emily: I am. I'm very sorry. I know how much that little boy means to you. That's why I offered to marry you in the first place.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. It was all about my son.",
        "Emily: Yeah, it was, whether you want to believe that or not. You know what -- if you weren't so quick to reject my brilliant idea, you might still have your son.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I doubt it.",
        "Emily: Really, really -- well, you know what? If the judge is going to grant custody to Craig Montgomery, I'm sure that he would be willing to forgive my past.",
        "Dusty: If this is I told you so, I don't want to hear it.",
        "Emily: Okay, whatever. But I bet you wish you took me up on my offer now, don't you?",
        "Dusty: No, Emily, I don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: As relieved as I am that Meg is not married to Dusty, I don't think you can assume that she's going to come running right back to you.",
        "Paul: Well, at least the door is still open.",
        "Barbara: Does that really matter if she's made it clear that's not what she wants?",
        "Paul: She hasn't made it clear. Meg only married Dusty so that Dusty could keep Johnny. I'm the one she loves. We belong together.",
        "Barbara: And I don't think you should pressure her before she's ready. If not, she could retaliate.",
        "Paul: What do you mean?",
        "Barbara: You know exactly what I mean. She could deny you access to the baby.",
        "Paul: She wouldn't do that.",
        "Barbara: If she felt threatened, she could.",
        "Paul: No, she loves me, she wouldn't hurt me like that. She'll come around. You'll see. And then -- we'll be a family again.",
        "Barbara: I just worry about you getting your hopes up.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Mom. Don't worry about it. I know what I'm doing. And here is your proof. I'm so glad you came.",
        "Meg: This won't take long.",
        "Paul: No, take as long as you like, please. Stay, this is your home, too.",
        "Meg: I didn't know you would be here.",
        "Barbara: Well, I didn't know I was going to see you either. How's my beautiful granddaughter?",
        "Meg: Eliza's fine.",
        "Barbara: Is she at the farm with your mom?",
        "Meg: I thought it would be best if I came alone.",
        "Paul: It's too bad, 'cause, you know, I got some stuff here for her. It would be great if I could show it to her --",
        "Meg: Paul, you and I need to talk.",
        "Barbara: I'm going to go make some tea. Anyone else?",
        "Meg: No, thank you.",
        "Barbara: Okay.",
        "Paul: If you don't want tea, you want something else? I could make you a little something. I was going to make you a little something the last time you were here. But, you know, we really didn't get to it.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and you know why.",
        "Paul: 'Cause I crossed a line.",
        "Meg: Not the first time.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I really wanted to apologize. I even went to the farm. But, your mom didn't think it was a great idea. She didn't want me anywhere near you.",
        "Meg: Can you blame her?",
        "Paul: Actually, yeah, you know? If I had had a chance to apologize, maybe you wouldn't have done something so stupid and drastic as marrying Dusty.",
        "Meg: I married Dusty to help him hold on to Johnny. And he might've been able to do that if you weren't so hell-bent on holding on to me.",
        "Paul: Okay, all right, fine, you're angry about what happened in the courtroom.",
        "Meg: Oh, why wouldn't I be?",
        "Paul: I did what I did for your own good. I did it for the sake of our child.",
        "Meg: You're scaring me.",
        "Paul: What are you talking about?",
        "Meg: You said that exact same thing when you lied to Jennifer about her child. You said that you were doing it for her own good, too.",
        "Paul: All right, I can see that you're upset. But, when you find a way to get past what happened in that courtroom --",
        "Meg: I am never going to get past it! What you did to Dusty and the memory of your sister was beyond cruel --",
        "Paul: Why are we still talking about Dusty? Hasn't Dusty caused enough trouble for us already?",
        "Meg: He hasn't done anything! You did!",
        "Paul: I did what I did because -- because I want more than anything on earth for us to be together and to be a family. And I know you don't want to admit it, but I know you feel the same way. Otherwise, you wouldn't come here like -- you're here, you came here today.",
        "Meg: You know why I came here today, Paul? I've instructed my lawyer to speed up the divorce.",
        "Paul: Stop it, don't, don't, and don't do this --",
        "Meg: I'm asked him to do whatever he needs to do to finalize it. Including allowing visitations -- limited visitations with you and Eliza.",
        "Paul: You can't do that.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I can. And I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Excuse me, I'm looking for someone.",
        "Alison: The information desk is on the second floor.",
        "Matt: Yeah, they're the ones that sent me up here. Do you know Casey Hughes? 'Cause the girl downstairs said I could probably find him on this floor?",
        "Alison: Oh my God! Matt?",
        "Matt: Alison!",
        "Alison: What -- what are you doing here? I mean, are you already out --",
        "Matt: Yeah, out of prison? Yeah, right? Time flies, huh?",
        "Alison: Well, I'm sure it didn't for you.",
        "Matt: Well, it's over now. And I'm ready to move on, so --",
        "Alison: By coming back here?",
        "Matt: Yeah, the scene of the crime. Right.",
        "Alison: No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to --",
        "Matt: No, it's all right. I debated starting over somewhere new. But I really like this town, you know? When I was doing time I used to think a lot about what kind of life I could've had here if I hadn't blown it. So, I figured I'd give it another shot, you know?",
        "Alison: Well, I am all for second chances.",
        "Matt: So, what about Casey? How's his second chance panning out? Is he still hitting the books over at O.U.?",
        "Alison: Oh, you know -- that kind of fell through --",
        "Matt: What happened?",
        "Alison: You know, he can tell you about that.",
        "Matt: Is he working here today, or --",
        "Alison: No, I wouldn't know.",
        "Matt: But I figured that you --",
        "Alison: No, it's not like we really hang out that much. I mean, especially now, so --",
        "Matt: Did something happen between you two?",
        "Alison: Well, that depends on what you mean by something.",
        "Matt: Do you want to take a walk, bring me up to speed?",
        "Alison: Well, I just clocked in.",
        "Matt: Can't you take an early break or something?",
        "Alison: Okay, let me just let someone know. Hi, I'm think I'm going to take my break now instead of later.",
        "Nurse: You just got here.",
        "Alison: I know, but I really need to go to the park and just get some air. Okay?",
        "Casey: Hey, Linda, is Alison working today?",
        "Nurse: She's supposed to be. She just left with some guy.",
        "Casey: What guy?",
        "Nurse: They were going to the park to get some air.",
        "Casey: Great. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Do you have a thing for Casey?",
        "Jade: No!",
        "Luke: Jade.",
        "Jade: Okay, I don't have a thing for Casey Hughes. Why can't I just be doing something nice?",
        "Luke: Because that's so not you.",
        "Jade: What if I'm trying to change?",
        "Luke: And you start by not telling Casey that the girl that he likes is up on some roof waiting for him? And you lied to me.",
        "Jade: I didn't lie.",
        "Luke: Yes, you did. You told me that you'd tell Casey and you didn't.",
        "Jade: But why are you so gung-ho about getting them together anyway?",
        "Luke: Because they're my friends and they worked really hard on getting I and Noah back together.",
        "Jade: No, if I remember correctly, it was me and Casey who did that, okay? And why does she need someone to relay a message anyway? She can do it herself?",
        "Luke: Because she's scared, Jade. She doesn't know if Casey has the same feelings for her.",
        "Jade: Maybe he doesn't.",
        "Luke: Oh, please. Did you see how quickly he went out of there to find her? Look, they have feelings for each other and they just need to admit it to each other. And they would've have had that chance if you would've done one simple thing --",
        "Jade: Okay. I messed up. What do I do to fix it?",
        "Luke: You figure it out. And then maybe I'll forgive you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Maybe Casey was just tired of me putting on the brakes every time we got close.",
        "Matt: You did that because?",
        "Alison: Well, it mostly had to do with my sister.",
        "Matt: The one that runs the newspaper? Isn't she a little -- I'm sorry. I mean, I'm all for thinking outside of the box, but --",
        "Alison: The age difference didn't bother them. Until after they got married.",
        "Matt: Casey got married?",
        "Alison: They got it annulled.",

        "Alison: And after that, Casey and I just started hanging out -- as friends.",
        "Matt: But you wanted it to be more?",
        "Alison: No, I didn't think so at first -- but, you know, as time went on, I started to wonder if it could turn into something.",
        "Matt: So, what's the problem?",
        "Alison: Well, our timing, mostly. It always sucked. When Casey was interested, I'd push him away. And, you know, when I was finally willing to give it a shot -- I got stood up. Big time.",
        "Matt: Maybe something came up and he couldn't make it.",
        "Alison: No, if it mattered enough, he would've been there. But it didn't. And I didn't. And now I'm done.",
        "Matt: Well, it doesn't sound that way to me.",
        "Alison: No, I mean it. I mean, I can't --",

        "Dusty: Why are you always weighing in on things that are none of your business?",
        "Emily: I'll back off. Why should I worry about you? You've got it all under control. Lose a child, boom, get a substitute -- just like that.",

        "Paul: Why are you being so cruel? Is this really about Dusty not getting Johnny?",
        "Meg: That's part of it, yes. But Dusty has done nothing but be there for me --",
        "Paul: Who cares! Why is that more important than what we do? What's more than our family being together?",
        "Meg: There is no we, Paul. We are not a family.",
        "Paul: Were you lying to me when you said that you and Dusty are just friends?",
        "Meg: You're not even listening.",
        "Paul: You know, all this time -- all this time you've been accusing me of betraying you, but my father was right. You've been betraying me.",
        "Meg: Yes, Paul, that's it! I have been betraying you! I've been doing all of this because it's Dusty who I love! Not you! It's been Dusty all along!",
        "Paul: I knew it. I knew it. You swore to me. You swore to me that my father was wrong.",
        "Meg: Paul, I just did that because you pushed me.",
        "Paul: You can't deny it now, you can't.",
        "Meg: I would never do anything like that.",

        "Matt: Thanks.",

        "Alison: He's gone now.",
        "Matt: You wanted me to kiss you to what -- make him jealous?",
        "Alison: No, I wanted him to see I had moved on.",
        "Matt: With me?",
        "Alison: I don't think he knew who you were.",
        "Matt: Well, since I'm trying to make amends with the guy, I sure hope not.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Matt: No, you shouldn't have. But the fact that you did, makes it pretty clear that you haven't moved on. Maybe you should tell Casey that.",
        "Alison: No, I can't.",
        "Matt: Why not?",
        "Alison: Like I said, we're just not meant to be.",

        "Paul: You don't know. I don't think I know her.",
        "Barbara: What are you saying?",
        "Paul: She finally admitted it. She finally admitted she's in love with Dusty.",
        "Barbara: She was angry.",
        "Paul: She's been angry before.",
        "Barbara: People say things say things in the heat of an argument --",
        "Paul: And now she's going to try and erase me from Eliza's life. And I'm not going to let that happen. She is my daughter, too.",
        "Barbara: Yes, yes. She is. And if you have to fight for Eliza, you have to do it carefully, legally, you have to go before a judge. And so I'm going to call my legal team and find the best custody lawyer around --",
        "Paul: No! It would take months before we even get a hearing. By then, Meg will have kept Eliza away from me for so long that my little girl will have totally forgotten who I even am.",
        "Barbara: You're scaring me.",
        "Paul: Why, 'cause I don't want to lose my little girl?",
        "Barbara: No, because you sound like your father. Even before you were born, he threatened me with ultimatums. He tortured both of us, Paul. You remember everything, don't you?",
        "Paul: I am not my father.",
        "Barbara: I know you're not your father. And I know how upset you are, but somehow, you're going to have to dig way down and find some kind of patience here and calm. And deal with this the right way. Or, you're going to end up back in the hospital and you will lose Eliza. And you will never be a part of her life again.",
        "Paul: You're right, aren't you? Meg and everybody else is waiting for me to have some kind of a meltdown. I gotta prove Meg wrong.",
        "Barbara: Right. So, I'm going to call my legal team and I'm going to get a recommendation for an attorney.",
        "Paul: Yeah, listen, before you do that, could you maybe do me a little favor?",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Paul: Just, you know, call Meg and see if you can go see the baby?",
        "Barbara: Honey, as much as I would love to see my granddaughter -- but after everything that's happened just now --",

        "Dusty: So, you told him he was right?",
        "Meg: Yes. I couldn't take it anymore. So yes, I told him I wanted to be with you. It felt like it was the only way I could just get him to stop. You're mad at me?",

        "Meg: Well, Barbara was there when I left. So, if anybody can calm him down, she can.",
        "Dusty: I wouldn't put it past him to show up at the farm. Maybe you and Eliza should stay here again.",
        "Meg: We'll be fine.",

        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: But on the other hand, I would -- I would love a glimpse of my little grandchild. And I know you've had a lot to contend with today, but it would certainly do me a world of good just to see her beautiful face.",
        "Meg: I'm not going back to Fairwinds.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, of course not. We could go to the Lakeview.",
        "Meg: I don't know, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: We don't even have to go up to my suite. We could meet in the lobby or in the lounge. Please. I know it's an imposition, and a lot has gone on today. I just don't -- I don't want to lose contact with my granddaughter.",
        "Meg: If Paul shows up --",
        "Barbara: No. No, Honey, he won't. I promise.",

        "Dusty: That doesn't mean he won't.",
        "Meg: I really don't think Barbara would expose the baby to a volatile situation.",
        "Dusty: Well, maybe not intentionally. Just call her back and tell her you changed your mind.",
        "Meg: I can't do that.",
        "Dusty: All right, I'll give her a call for you.",
        "Meg: You're doing it again.",

        "Dusty: Don't you think its strange Barbara called to see the baby right after you and Paul had a fight over visitation?",
        "Meg: Barbara loves her family. She was so happy when I was pregnant. And everything she's been through, Eliza was her best hope for the future. I feel like I need to honor that.",

        "Meg: We're meeting in the lounge. It's a public place.",
        "Dusty: It'll be safer if I go with you.",

        "Luke: What? What happened?",

        "Barbara: I don't, I don't. But my son is in pain. And I know you feel reluctant to allow him near Eliza, but he's not going to do anything to hurt her. And if you just give him another chance to prove that he can be --",
        "Meg: Do you know how many chances and I have given him? And I always end up regretting it.",
