        "Lily: I brought Damian into my house, knowing what he was capable of. I put my children's lives in danger.",
        "Lucinda: I -- I believe I warned you about that many, many times.",
        "Lily: Yes. Yes, you did. Everyone did. I didn't listen.",
        "Lucinda: All right, now -- what are you going to do when Damian asks you to forgive him?",
        "Lily: He won't.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, he will.",
        "Lily: This time is different. This time he went too far. I will never forgive him for this.",
        "Lucinda: You said that before.",
        "Lily: Mother, he made my children think their father was dead! He made them think their aunt was crazy.",
        "Lucinda: He's gonna come up with some fabulous story and explain it all away. Absolutely adorable, how he did it all for you. And he's probably gonna end up making you think he did.",
        "Lily: It doesn't matter. Holden said he's gone, and he's not coming back.",
        "Lucinda: Well, good. I hope Holden's right.",
        "Lily: Either way, it's over. I am done with Damian.",
        "Lucinda: You may be done with him, but he's never done with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know what? I'm gonna go clean up.",
        "Molly: Why are you bleeding?",
        "Holden: I already told you. I was changing a tire, and I slipped.",
        "Molly: Don't lie to me, Holden, because you are so not good at it.",
        "Holden: Molly --",
        "Molly: What happened between you and Damian?",
        "Holden: I told you. I saw Damian on the docks. He was getting ready to leave the country, and I made a decision. I let him go.",
        "Molly: Why?",
        "Holden: Because I didn't want -- I didn't want my kids to have to go through a trial that was ugly. I didn't want to see Meg have to relive everything that he put her through. And I didn't want Luke to have his father humiliated in public.",
        "Molly: Nobody is that selfless, Holden. Not even you.",
        "Holden: What do you want from me, Molly?",
        "Molly: The truth.",
        "[Holden remembering]",
        "[Grunting]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I let him go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Yes. I'd like to know if the Snyder family made their appointment. No, the patient's name is Liberty Ciccone. Snyder is the stepfather's name. Oh, great. That's great. And tell the doctor I'm grateful. Thank you.",
        "Teri: Checking up on them?",
        "Dusty: I want to make sure they made their appointment. It wasn't easy to get.",
        "Teri: If you don't trust Jack to get them there, why didn't you just take them yourself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Man, those doctors were impressive. They really know their stuff.",
        "Janet: I know. Dusty was right. It pays to see the top specialists, huh? Which one did you like best?",
        "Liberty: What's the difference?",
        "Janet: Well, you have to pick the one that's gonna be your specialist.",
        "Liberty: Um -- you just pick.",
        "Jack: Why don't we go and unpack? We got some time before our next appointment. We can grab some lunch.",
        "Liberty: Guys, what's the point?",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, we need to get all the information we can so that you can decide what you want to do.",
        "Liberty: Decide? What? What is there to decide? I -- I can choose chemo and radiation or chemo and radiation.",
        "Janet: Liberty, come on. Be optimistic.",
        "Liberty: Why? None of them could even promise that this was stuff that actually worked.",
        "Janet: Well, of course they can't promise anything.",
        "Liberty: Okay, fine. That's great. So they're guessing. So I guess it won't matter that I actually skip lunch.",
        "Janet: Liberty -- she is being so negative.",
        "Jack: Actually, she's being realistic. They can't promise it will work.",
        "Janet: It has to. Otherwise -- I guess I just was hoping that they weren't gonna tell me they made a mistake and that she doesn't have leukemia.",
        "Jack: That's not gonna happen, okay? Listen, but that doesn't mean that she can't beat this.",
        "Janet: You know, maybe I should stay in Liberty's room, just in case she decides to do something crazy or take off.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: No. I spent months pulling us apart. It's gonna take a while to put us back together.",
        "Janet: I really am glad you're here.",
        "Jack: I wouldn't be anywhere else.",
        "[Jack remembering]",
        "Carly: You can never leave me again.",
        "Jack: You're right. I could never leave you again.",
        "Carly: Okay. You -- you finish things with Janet if you're sure that's what you want.",
        "Jack: Yes. I will talk to Janet. Then --",
        "Carly: Then you come back to me. [Echoing] Come back to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Hello. Craig. No, I'm -- I'm sorry. I can't meet you for dinner. I'm in New York. I -- I have a meeting with some buyers from Monte Carlo. No, Craig, I can handle a pitch meeting on my own. Not unless you can tell me the difference between argyle and arabesque. That's what I thought. Don't worry, okay? I'm fine on my own. In fact, right now, I prefer it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I believe you.",
        "Holden: Good. I have to call Lily.",
        "Molly: Of course you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Holden. Have you heard from Meg?",
        "Holden: No, not yet. But Margo called in the state police and the FBI, but there's still no sign of her.",
        "Lily: How could she just disappear?",
        "Holden: I don't think she knows what we found out about Damian, and I think that she's afraid that if they find her, they might lock her up again.",
        "Lily: I am so sorry, Holden.",
        "Holden: Look, about the kids, I haven't told them anything yet, but they're gonna find out sooner or later.",
        "Lily: I know.",
        "Holden: I think they should hear it from us. Right now, they're out at the barn with my mother. You think maybe you could stop by?",
        "Lily: Sure. I'll be there soon. Holden thinks that we should tell Natalie and Ethan about Damian before they find out from somebody else.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, that's the first good idea anyone's had. I -- I can be here when you get back, or -- I don't think that you should be staying here alone.",
        "Lily: Mother, I don't need a guard. Damian's not coming back.",
        "Lucinda: I don't care what Damian promised to Holden. If Damian thinks there's the slightest chance that you will give him a second chance, he will be back. From where I stand now, he might not be wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: It might be better if you weren't here when Lily stops by.",
        "Molly: Oh. I'll go, just as soon as you tell me how you got hurt.",
        "Holden: Molly, I told you, I was changing a tire.",
        "Molly: Yeah.",
        "Holden: Where are you going?",
        "Molly: To check your car for a spare tire.",
        "Holden: A -- all right. Just --",
        "Molly: You weren't changing any tire, Holden, were you?",
        "Holden: What difference does it make? Damian's gone. He left. He's not gonna be able to hurt Lily, Luke, or anyone else ever again.",
        "Molly: What did you do to him?",
        "Holden: Nothing. So let it go, Molly.",
        "Molly: It's not like you to lie.",
        "Holden: Molly, I told you everything that you need to know.",
        "Molly: And that's supposed to convince me?",
        "Holden: Why do I have to convince you of anything? Damian's gone. He left. Stop being a reporter for one minute and accept everything that I've told you, okay?",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Molly: On faith?",
        "Holden: That's right. The same faith that I had in you when you told me that Damian didn't bribe Grady.",
        "Molly: I have said I'm sorry for that.",
        "Holden: And I accepted your apology.",
        "Molly: Really? Because I don't think you did, because you keep bringing it up.",
        "Holden: Maybe that's because I'm still dealing with the consequences of your actions.",
        "Molly: And I am unbelievably sorry. Please don't make the same mistake I did, Holden.",
        "Holden: I'm not.",
        "Molly: Listen, people get backed into a corner. They feel desperate. Their judgment gets clouded. They do things they regret. It happens to everyone.",
        "Holden: And that's why I forgave you. I've been there.",
        "Molly: With Damian?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to hurt him. I wanted to make him feel the same sort of pain that he put my sister through and the way he manipulated Lily.",
        "Molly: And you.",
        "Holden: Yeah. But you know what? I wasn't gonna sink to his level, Molly. As angry as I was, I knew that the right thing for everyone to do would be to let him go. Aah!",
        "Molly: Take off your shirt.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Molly: I believe you, but I want to take a look at this cut. Unless you want Lily to do it. Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: It's not as bad as it looks.",
        "Molly: Oh, God. You did not do this changing a tire. You got into a fight with him. And if he did this to you, what did you do to him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I am still married to Damian. He's still Luke's father. I can't change that.",
        "Lucinda: We can't do anything about the connection with Luke, but you can definitely get a divorce.",
        "Lily: You know what? This has all happened so fast. I need time to get my bearings.",
        "Lucinda: Don't be foolish, Darling. Don't be foolish. This mistake was a marriage that -- that was not meant to be. It was based on lies, on manipulation. So put it all behind you as fast as you can.",
        "Lily: What do you want me to do, just throw myself at Holden, beg him to take me back? Do I really look that pathetic?",
        "Lucinda: We both know you want him. You go get him. I'll take care of everything else.",
        "Lily: Don't you dare. Mother!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Three parties of four are coming in at the same time tonight. You got to be on your game.",
        "Teri: What are you doing?",
        "Dusty: What am I doing? I'm managing the club while your sister's in New York with Liberty.",
        "Teri: And Jack. Don't forget about him. Hey, does it bother you that he's with them?",
        "Dusty: No. They need time together to rebuild the family.",
        "Teri: Do you really think that's possible?",
        "Dusty: You don't?",
        "Teri: I mean, Jack treated her like dirt. If it was me, I wouldn't be able to stand the sight of him.",
        "Dusty: Well, you're not her. She wants him back.",
        "Teri: Yeah, but you've done more for Liberty than Jack has.",
        "Dusty: I made a few calls. That's all.",
        "Teri: For a kid you barely know.",
        "Dusty: She is Janet's daughter.",
        "Teri: Is that the only reason?",
        "Dusty: Don't you have work to do?",
        "Teri: Sure thing, Boss. Sorry if I struck a nerve.",
        "Dusty: Whatever. Why don't you get back to the kitchen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay, Liberty wants to go out, and I think she should stay here and rest until her next doctor's appointment.",
        "Liberty: I'm tired of resting and doctors. I need a break, okay, and there's a costume exhibit at the Met that I really, really want to go to.",
        "Janet: I don't want you to wear yourself out.",
        "Liberty: I will be gone for an hour.",
        "Jack: You want to go alone?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I -- I need some time to myself.",
        "Janet: See? I know. New York is a big city.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it's a museum, guys. I'm not -- I'm not running a marathon. I'm not bungie-jumping off the Empire State Building here.",
        "Janet: What happens if you feel faint?",
        "Liberty: I will sit down.",
        "Janet: I don't think it's a good idea.",
        "Liberty: If you're gonna treat me like a cancer patient every minute of my life, I might as well give up now. What's the point?",
        "Janet: Don't say that ever!",
        "Liberty: I'll say it whenever the hell I want to say it.",
        "Janet: I -- I don't know what I'm supposed to do.",
        "Jack: I think you're doing fine.",
        "Janet: She hates me?",
        "Jack: No, she doesn't. But maybe she's right. She needs to lead as normal a life as she possibly can, and I think maybe you need to let her be more than a sick kid.",
        "Janet: Well, maybe if she took this a little more seriously --",
        "Jack: You raised a feisty, intelligent, fearless kid. She's not gonna change because she's sick. In fact, you don't want her to. She's gonna need all that to get through this.",
        "Janet: So what am I supposed to do, nothing?",
        "Jack: No. You're supposed to make sure that she stays who she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I'm like a prisoner here. Bread and water and doctors.",
        "Carly: She just wants what's best for you.",
        "Liberty: What's best for me is spending some time by myself.",
        "Carly: Well, New York can be a dangerous place.",
        "Liberty: It's a costume exhibit. What, am I gonna get, like, mauled by a rogue thread?",
        "Carly: No, but you still have to get there and get back, and it's easy to get lost. It took me a half an hour to find this dress shop.",
        "Liberty: Where?",
        "Carly: On Madison.",
        "Liberty: Wait. You're here, in New York?",
        "Carly: On business.",
        "Liberty: I didn't know that. Hey, you should come to the museum with me.",
        "Carly: Your mother doesn't want you to go.",
        "Liberty: Alone. But if I say that I'm with you --",
        "Carly: No. That -- that is a very bad idea. If Jack and your mother find out I'm here, they're gonna think I followed them.",
        "Liberty: Why would they think that?",
        "Carly: Just trust me. It's best for everybody if we all just stay on opposite sides of Manhattan.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Talk to you later. Bye. [Liberty sighs] Hey. I'm going to the museum, so if anything happens, I'll call 911, tell them to let you know where to claim my body.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Liberty: What does that mean -- \"Okay\"?",
        "Janet: That means that Jack convinced me to let you go.",
        "Liberty: He did?",
        "Janet: Yes. He said an hour at the museum won't do any damage.",
        "Liberty: Really?",
        "Janet: So there you go.",
        "Jack: One hour means one hour.",
        "Liberty: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Cab fare and admission to the Met.",
        "Liberty: Thanks. Okay.",
        "Janet: One hour.",
        "Liberty: You don't have to worry.",
        "Janet: I wish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: It looks really bad, Holden. I think you need to go to the hospital.",
        "Holden: Stop, stop. Aah, ow!",
        "Molly: No, see? You could have a cracked rib. You might have internal bleeding.",
        "Holden: I'm fine.",
        "Molly: No, you're not.",
        "[Car approaches]",
        "Holden: That's Lily. Just, uh, tell her I'll be right down.",
        "Molly: Sure. That's what I love to do -- give Lily messages.",
        "Lily: Molly.",
        "Molly: Hey.",
        "Lily: Didn't know you would be here. Are my kids still outside with Emma?",
        "Molly: Yeah. They're looking at the horses.",
        "Lily: Where's Holden?",
        "Molly: He'll be right down.",
        "Lily: What's that?",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Lily: That.",
        "Molly: Well, it looks like tomato sauce.",
        "Lily: No, it doesn't. It looks like blood.",
        "Molly: I should know better than to think I belong in the kitchen. I was trying to slice vegetables and almost took my finger off.",
        "Lily: I thought you said it was tomato sauce.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Holden: Hi.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Holden: I thought I heard your car.",
        "Molly: Cut my finger chopping vegetables.",
        "Lily: And evidently, she bleeds tomato sauce.",
        "Holden: Can I get you something to drink?",
        "Molly: Hey. Let me get it. What would you like?",
        "Holden: I'll have a beer.",
        "Molly: Okay. Lily?",
        "Lily: Nothing, thanks. Why don't I go outside and get the kids.",
        "Holden: We should probably talk about what we want to tell them first.",
        "Molly: Here you go.",
        "Holden: Thanks.",
        "Molly: While you two do that, I'm gonna call the police and get a progress report on Meg.",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Molly: You're welcome.",
        "Holden: Sit down.",
        "Lily: You two seem better than the last time I saw you.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, we're, uh -- we're getting along.",
        "Lily: Great.",
        "Holden: So -- what do you want our kids to know about your husband?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: I -- I know it's not your regular route! I don't care what the dispatcher said to you! I need you to come back and take -- same to you, Pal!",
        "Dusty: What's the problem?",
        "Teri: I told this guy that he needed to drop this off in the kitchen, but he refused.",
        "Dusty: Well, let me help you.",
        "Teri: No, I got it. Hey, listen, I got it.",
        "Dusty: You're leaking flour everywhere!",
        "Teri: So!",
        "Dusty: I got it!",
        "Teri: Don't do that! Don't do that! Don't do it! Oh, my God.",
        "[Dusty laughs]",
        "Dusty: You think this is funny?",
        "Teri: Yes, yes. You have no idea. Don't worry about it. I'm -- I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna clean you off.",
        "Dusty: You're gonna help me?",
        "Teri: It's on me, too, so don't worry about it.",
        "Dusty: It's on you?",
        "Teri: This is helping. I'm help -- I'm helping.",
        "Dusty: Are you getting it off?",
        "Teri: I got it, all of it.",
        "Lucinda: I won't even ask what's going on here.",
        "Teri: Hey, knock yourself out. I'm gonna go get a -- a broom. Something.",
        "[Lucinda laughing]",
        "Lucinda: It's amazing. No matter how old you get, the girlfriends are always the same age.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hi. Um, your sign says $20. I'd like a reading. Okay. [Liberty laughs] What's wrong?",
        "Palm reader: Your lifeline is very short.",
        "Liberty: What does that mean?",
        "Palm reader: I need another $20 to tell you that.",
        "Liberty: I don't have another $20.",
        "Palm reader: Then you just have to wait and find out.",
        "Liberty: What do you mean, \"Wait and find out\"? Can you just tell me --?",
        "Palm reader: Sorry.",
        "Carly: What kind of witch are you to say that to a child?",
        "Palm reader: Hey, I'm no witch. I'm a palm reader.",
        "Carly: Come on, Liberty. She's just trying to scare more money out of you.",
        "Liberty: She said my lifeline was short.",
        "Carly: So what?",
        "Liberty: That has to mean something.",

        "Carly: Exactly. And I'm gonna live forever, just like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Those doctors today were very encouraging.",
        "Janet: I know. But she's still facing months of chemo and radiation and side effects. And -- and they're not even sure that any of that is gonna work.",
        "Jack: No, but they didn't say it wouldn't.",
        "Janet: I guess. That feels good.",
        "Jack: I'm guessing you don't want me to stop.",
        "Janet: Never.",
        "Liberty: Hi. I'm back with five minutes to spare. And look who I ran into. What I don't understand is why didn't someone think of this sooner.",
        "Janet: What are you doing here? What's wrong, Liberty?",
        "Liberty: Mom, nothing's wrong.",
        "Janet: Are you sick?",

        "Carly: Nothing. I'm sorry. I didn't -- I didn't mean to barge in.",
        "Janet: What? What are you doing? How did you get here?",
        "Liberty: Mom, I called her.",
        "Janet: So you asked her to come to New York.",
        "Liberty: No, no.",
        "Janet: Then why is she here.",
        "Liberty: Because she's my friend, and she happened to be here, so I asked her to go to the museum with me.",
        "Janet: I thought you wanted to be alone.",
        "Liberty: No. I just -- needed to get away from you.",
        "Jack: Uh, you know, we're gonna be leaving in a few minutes. Why don't you go lie down and rest in your room?",
        "Liberty: Oh, I'm not tired. Oh, I get it. That took a second. Let's just talk behind the sick girl's back.",
        "Janet: Great. I knew I shouldn't have let her go, even if it was for just an hour.",
        "Jack: What are you doing here, Carly?",
        "Carly: Uh, I'm in New York on business. And when Liberty called me, she told me about the costume exhibit. She thought I might be interested in going.",
        "Janet: Why did she call you in the first place?",
        "Carly: I don't know. Maybe because I'm not involved in all the -- the medical stuff. Maybe she just needed a break.",
        "Janet: And so you just had to fly out to be by her side?",
        "Carly: Actually, Janet, I said no. I thought it might bother you.",
        "Janet: You're right.",
        "Carly: I was worried about her on her own, so I -- I went to check on her.",
        "Janet: And you were just kind of hoping that she might invite you to come hang out with us, right?",
        "Carly: I certainly did not intend to end up here. But when I saw Liberty at the museum, she was with some phony palm reader who was ripping her off.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: Who was telling her that she didn't have long to live.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God!",
        "Carly: Obviously, I didn't want to leave her there, so I -- I brought her back here.",
        "Janet: I knew we shouldn't let her go out on her own.",
        "Carly: It's okay. She's okay. Just a little upset. Well, I, um -- I have a lunch appointment. Good luck with the doctors.",
        "Janet: Carly, thanks for watching out for her.",
        "Carly: My pleasure.",
        "Jack: Let me call you a cab.",
        "Carly: No, Jack. I'm quite certain there are plenty of cabs downstairs.",
        "Jack: Let me make sure.",

        "Dusty: So, what are you doing here? Are you just here to bust my chops?",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Oh, I -- I forgot. I came for a recommendation. See, I'm interested in your expertise. I want to know, um, the best private investigator that you know.",
        "Dusty: Really? Who are you trying to find?",
        "Lucinda: Who said I wanted anyone found?",

        "Holden: Well, I was thinking that what might help is if we stopped shuffling them back and forth. I think we need to stay in one place.",

        "Holden: No, no. I meant your place.",
        "Lily: You would -- you would do that? You would let me bring them home?",

        "Carly: Uh, Jack, stop it, please. It's not my business.",
        "Jack: I want you to understand.",

        "Liberty: 'Cause that's what you're telling me to do.",

        "Dusty: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Teri: Racing off to Detroit when Parker and Liberty got lost, arranging doctors' appointments, making trips to New York for them. I mean, you can't just tell me that you're doing that for Janet just because she's your employee or your friend. You're doing that because -- because you're in love with her.",

        "Holden: You know how we always tell you guys that lying is wrong? Well, Damian -- he told some lies, and he did a lot of bad things. He hurt a lot of people, especially your mom.",

Did you hear them say the name \"Damian\"? Yeah? Oh, God. Do you think that you would recognize that man that said it if you saw him in a picture? Is this one of the men you saw fighting? It is, isn't it?",

        "Chapman: You're right. That is a lot of incentive. I'll bring him back.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no, no. You must make sure that he never returns.",

        "Holden: We all make mistakes.",

        "Dusty: 'Cause I'm not. And that's not the reason there can't be anything between us.",

        "Dusty: You're a beautiful woman. You'll find someone that deserves you.",
