        "Rose: Can I ask you a question?",
        "Paul: A serious question?",
        "Rose: Define \"serious.\"",
        "Paul: Okay, something that doesn't have anything to do with conga lines or drinking tequila out of some stripper's navel.",
        "Rose: No, I'm talking about a bottom-line, for-real question.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rose: If you don't want jokes, how could you want me?",
        "Paul: Wait a minute. I never said I don't want to laugh again. I just -- I just want to know how long we are going to dance around the issue.",
        "Rose: Which issue?",
        "Paul: Our last six months. You know, you being in Italy, me facing a life sentence, us being engaged through the whole thing, making do with a couple of phone calls. These are things that need to be addressed. That sound about right?",
        "Rose: Yeah.",
        "Paul: And we can't do that by tossing around a few jokes and pretending like everything's fine, like everything's normal. We just need to figure out why things happened the way they did.",
        "Rose: Then what?",
        "Paul: Maybe you and I can find a place to connect again.",
        "Rose: I thought that's what we were doing right here right now.",
        "Paul: Okay. A place a little -- a little deeper than laughing about tiny umbrellas in big drinks. Am I right?",
        "Rose: In a way. In another way, it sounds like you're giving me the boot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Don't let anybody ever hear you say that. Don't even let them know you thought it.",
        "Will: Why not?",
        "Alison: Because if you say anything at all about me and that fire to Dr. Michaels or your dad or your mom, they'll put me in jail faster than you could say, \"I made it up.\"",
        "Will: But I didn't make anything up. And besides, a lot of people said I started the fire, but I'm not in jail.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but that's just because you're a little kid. I'm not a kid. They'd put me in jail for years. Is that what you want?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Alison: Okay, then. Then promise me you'll never say my name, anything about that fire in the same sentence. Okay? Will, promise me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Welcome home, lullaby.",
        "Lucy: Dad, this is amazing. Isn't it amazing, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: Amazing indeed. Very well done, Montgomery. Very well done.",
        "Craig: Thank you. Thank you. We've got enough ramps in here to fill an amusement park. You're gonna be able to get around this place in no time.",
        "Lucy: What was that funny little door we passed?",
        "Craig: That's a little elevator. I had it completely refurbished.",
        "Lucy: For me? Dad, this is great. I can't wait to show Aaron.",
        "Craig: Aaron?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I already invited him to come over. That's okay, isn't it?",
        "Craig: Well, I thought you said you were going to take it easy with Aaron.",
        "Lucy: That was before. I mean, at first it kind of felt weird between us because I couldn't remember anything. But I don't know, it's -- it's not weird anymore.",
        "Craig: Why is that?",
        "Lucy: Well, he doesn't push me, dad. He makes wherever I am okay. I like him. And I like us just where we are. Who needs a bunch of memories when right now is so good?",
        "Rosanna: That's a wonderful attitude, Lucy.",
        "Craig: Listen, sweetness, do you want to go see your bedroom?",
        "Lucy: Sure. Oh, wait. Let me try to find it myself. I bet you anything I know the colors you chose for me.",
        "Craig: All right. Okay. Go ahead. Do you think you could stay within a few hundred miles of my side on this?",
        "Rosanna: All right. What would you like me to do?",
        "Craig: I want you to lock the door. And if the doorbell rings, ignore it.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Aaron: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Oh!",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you, but the front door was open.",
        "Rosanna: No, that's all right. Why don't you just come in, Aaron? I would like to have a word with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Just tell me if you want me to stop.",
        "Molly: Oh, Jack, don't talk. Don't talk. And please -- please don't stop. Jack?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Is -- is Lucy around?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, actually. She and her father are taking a tour of the grounds.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I bet. This place is huge. Oh, I got you and Mr. Montgomery a housewarming gift.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thank you very much. That's very sweet of you. I think I'm gonna wait to open it until Craig gets back. Hope you don't mind. But come on in. Don't worry. I don't bite. At least not lately, anyway. Look -- I don't want to beat around the bush, so let's get right to it, shall we? You know that Lucy and I have had our share of difficulties in the past.",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and by extension, you and I have had some run-ins as well.",
        "Aaron: Yes, I remember that very well.",
        "Rosanna: Well, Lucy doesn't remember the hostilities between us, and I think that's one reason why we've managed to become quite friendly.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, she was telling me before that you guys were talking and stuff, so --",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and it's lovely. It really is. And it's important to me. So I was hoping that you and I might take the opportunity to start over as well.",
        "Aaron: As if nothing happened?",
        "Rosanna: As if the past were just that. Look, I -- I may have treaded on your toes a little bit, and I'm very sorry. Perhaps we could try again?",
        "Aaron: Wow. You want us to start over? Well, you know, you know, Lucy and I are kind of doing the same thing. So -- sure. Why not?",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Lucy: Rosanna, you've got to see my room. It's so -- Aaron, you're here.",
        "Aaron: Whoa, you've got to be careful with that. You almost creamed your dad.",
        "Lucy: You've got to see this place. It's huge. It's like a museum or a fortress or something. Every time you turn a corner, you expect to see a knight in a suit of armor. Oh, you've got to see my room. Dad had it fixed up exactly like in Montega, so I feel more at home. And I do. Thank you.",
        "Craig: Ah, that's the smile I live for. Hello, Aaron. I guess I didn't hear the bell.",
        "Rosanna: He came in because we left the door open when we were bringing in all that luggage. Look, he bought us a housewarming gift.",
        "Craig: Oh. A bag -- of coffee beans. Well, we could sure use that. Yes, indeed. Can't we, everyone?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, and there's -- there's actually a coffee grinder in there, too.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, one can certainly tell that you have roots in Seattle. Thank you very much. I love good coffee.",
        "Aaron: Luce? What do you say we take a tour of the place?",
        "Lucy: I'd love to. Okay, daddy?",
        "Craig: Yeah, sure, sure. Just watch out for the ramps. Yeah, okay.",
        "Aaron: Where to, your majesty? Your wish is my command.",
        "Craig: Luce -- remind me to take a couple of these beans, throw 'em out the window and pray for a beanstalk.",
        "Rosanna: You know that hating Aaron isn't going to get you anywhere.",
        "Craig: Well, can't you see that she's falling for that hormonal delinquent all over again?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, she's crazy about him. Yes.",
        "Craig: Then why are you treating him like he belongs here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Michaels: It's about that time.",
        "Will: I have my afternoon therapy session now.",
        "Alison: Already? But it's just been a few minutes. Can't I please explain to him why I can't come around anymore?",
        "Dr. Michaels: Will simply needs a little time out, Alison. That's all. It's not forever.",
        "Alison: But I --",
        "Dr. Michaels: No, you're just gonna have to excuse us.",
        "Will: I won't tell anybody you started the fire, I promise.",
        "Alison: Thank you. You're the best.",
        "Emily: How'd it go?",
        "Alison: Great. Everything's cool.",
        "Emily: Really? Until just now, things didn't look so cool to me.",
        "Alison: What, are you spying on my private conversation?",
        "Emily: I care about you, Alison, and I'm tuned in to you. Something is on your mind, something big.",
        "Alison: Well, my stepbrother, who's in the hospital after all this mess with the fire just happened, I'd say that that's pretty big.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, Will's a part of it. I believe that. I think Aaron's a big part of it, too.",
        "Alison: Well, if you already got it so figured out, then what do you need me for, Emily?",
        "Emily: To help me understand.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Emily: So I can help you.",
        "Alison: The only way that you can help me is to get out of my face.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no. You listen to me. There's not a move you can make that I don't already know. Now, you start talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You think I'm dumping you?",
        "Rose: Yeah. Maybe. I can read between the lines. I have a gift --",
        "Paul: Sweetheart, why would I be here if I were dumping you?",
        "Rose: 'Cause you're a mensch. You want to let me down easy.",
        "Paul: Okay, all right, I'm lost, because I'm -- I'm over here trying to tell you how much I want to get closer to you, and you think that I want to break up? You sure you're not the one trying to let me down easy?",
        "Rose: Do you know how incredible Italian men are? Hmm?",
        "Paul: I think I've heard.",
        "Rose: Oh, yeah, they are. They're -- they smile at you, pull out your chair for you, make you feel like a million bucks even though they don't know you.",
        "Paul: I didn't realize that was --",
        "Rose: And I managed to go to bed alone every night for six months and lay there in my pensione and wake up the next morning and only one guy on my mind.",
        "Paul: Who was that?",
        "Rose: You. You're tattooed on my heart.",
        "Paul: I was thinking about you, too, babe.",
        "Rose: You were in jail. What do you mean, thinking about me? I'm sorry. No jokes.",
        "Paul: There's no one else for me, no one but you.",
        "Rose: Then what is the verdict here?",
        "Paul: Well, sweetheart, we are either meant for each other or we are damn crazy.",
        "Rose: I know we're crazy. It's the other part that's got my head spinning here.",
        "Paul: You're not sure you belong with me?",
        "Rose: I'm not sure the real Rose belongs with anybody.",
        "Paul: You seem like the same Rose to me.",
        "Rose: Oh, yeah? Yeah? The boardroom Rose or the showroom Rose?",
        "Paul: Is there a difference?",
        "Rose: Yeah, yeah, the Rose that came from Jersey, shaking her tail feathers for a living, I enjoyed that very much, by the way.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on. I saw you over at Worldwide, too. You loved wheeling and dealing over there, too.",
        "Rose: That was showbiz, honey. That was dressed up, like the exec, playing the part, yeah. I loved that. But my own salon, hair, makeup, it's gonna be the real me, 100%.",
        "Paul: All right, well, I can handle your career change.",
        "Rose: Hello, I'm talking about a complete make-over here. I can't expect you to sit by while that happens to me.",
        "Paul: Why? Why not? Besides, it might speed things up if I -- if I'm with you. You know I have a pretty good mind for business.",
        "Rose: Yeah, big business. Talking about renting a storefront, used to be known as yuppy puppy. Little.",
        "Paul: Yuppy puppy?",
        "Rose: Yeah.",
        "Paul: All right, let's go take a look at it. Come on.",
        "Rose: Are you serious?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm absolutely sure. I can -- i can judge a good piece of real estate. Let's go.",
        "Rose: This might be a big mistake.",
        "Paul: Well, it wouldn't be our first, now, would it? Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I'd ask you what's wrong, Jack, but I don't know if I want you to tell me.",
        "Jack: I'm married.",
        "Molly: Jack, I know, but --",
        "Jack: It's over. I understand that. But I'm still married. I can't pretend I'm not, and I can't forget. Molly?",
        "Molly: It's okay. It just -- it takes my body a little while to catch up. Or slow down. You know what I'm saying?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry.",
        "Molly: Don't. Okay, I get it. I mean, Mike and I aren't even married, and I can't help but -- I don't want to go there, okay?",
        "Jack: I just wanted to pound something, put my fist through a wall. I don't know, anything to make it go away, and then, all of a sudden, there you were.",
        "Molly: And there you were.",
        "Jack: I wanted -- I don't know what I wanted. I can tell you I didn't want to stop.",
        "Molly: Beats crying, huh?",
        "Jack: I am so sorry, Molly.",
        "Molly: Stop it. Don't apologize. Because we don't owe each other anything.",
        "Jack: I know. It's just so weird. It's exactly what Carly and Mike --",
        "Molly: No, and we definitely don't owe Carly and Mike anything, okay? Not even another thought.",
        "Jack: Okay. You hungry?",
        "Molly: You don't have to feed me.",
        "Jack: I know that, but still -- are you hungry?",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "Molly: Kind of. No. Stay. Hey, it's Molly McKinnon in suite 707. Can I get two grilled cheese sandwiches? French fries, extra ketchup, big, hot pot of tea and lots of honey. Thanks.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Something warm. It'll help.",
        "Molly: Maybe. But what I really need --",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Molly: I need to hold on to you for a little while.",
        "Jack: I know. Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Yes.",
        "Aaron: We made it!",
        "Lucy: Not a sound.",
        "Aaron: It's not even cold, either. You see, Luce? Even mother nature's on our side.",
        "Lucy: You're right. This place feels -- I don't know -- enchanted or something.",
        "Aaron: I think we found our spot.",
        "Lucy: Were we always able to do that?",
        "Aaron: What, like, read each other's minds?",
        "Lucy: Exactly. Were we always able to do that, or is it something new?",
        "Aaron: No, we were always able to tune in to each other. But think about it -- about a month ago, you were like, \"Aaron who?\" I mean, you didn't know me or trust me. So today -- yeah, today is something new. It's a new start. Man, is everything different since your accident.",
        "Lucy: You mean because I can't walk?",
        "Aaron: No, Lucy. No, I mean -- you're gonna walk. I know it. It's just that people are different -- you know, since you got hurt. It's just amazing how people can change.",
        "Lucy: Like who?",
        "Aaron: Like -- Alison. I mean, she used to be a total flake. I mean, now she can hold down two jobs with no pay. And they don't even feed her.",
        "Lucy: And that's different for her?",
        "Aaron: Oh, the girl can chow down, believe me. And pitching in? It's a foreign concept.",
        "Lucy: For some reason, I don't think Alison was the person you were thinking of when you said people had changed.",
        "Aaron: Ooh, you're taking this mind-reading game seriously. Lucy -- I don't want to start anything. I mean, are you sure you want to know this?",
        "Lucy: I want to know everything, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Your dad used to hate my guts.",
        "Lucy: What? No. I mean, he's obviously upset that I ran away with you, but he never blamed you for it. He's never led me to believe that he had anything personal against you.",
        "Aaron: He hasn't, huh? Anyway, you know, maybe it was just me, then. I don't know.",
        "Lucy: Well, my dad holds things back because he thinks he's protecting me or something. He's terrible at it. He can't lie to me.",
        "Aaron: You know him better than I do.",
        "Lucy: Aaron, do you think I'm wrong about my father?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: I treated Aaron like a guest because that's what he is. I was being polite.",
        "Craig: He's no good for Lucy.",
        "Rosanna: He's very good for Lucy. She laughs now. Do you know that there are studies that say that people who are happy recover faster?",
        "Craig: From what?",
        "Rosanna: One catches more flies with honey than with vinegar.",
        "Craig: Does one -- honey?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. And you might try to remember that the next time you find fault with me before my baggage even hits the floor. Mm. Was that an apology?",
        "Craig: No. It's just a reminder that this is our house. And I shouldn't have snapped at you. I won't anymore. But don't worry -- Aaron Snyder's not gonna be an issue in our lives much longer.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I can't wait to hear your foolproof plan about how you're going to get him out of the picture. Good luck.",
        "Craig: All I want is for Lucy to recover and have the choices that a happy, healthy 17-year-old should have. And that is not gonna be possible with dog boy hanging around, drooling.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I seem to recall being in love and 17 as one of the happier states in life.",
        "Craig: Well, sure, that's fine. But what if -- 18, hanging around Emma's kitchen, feeding a -- a baby?",
        "Rosanna: You're painting an awfully bleak picture, Craig.",
        "Craig: Well -- I will do everything I have to do to protect Lucy.",
        "Rosanna: Does that include plotting with a spoiled brat half your age?",
        "Craig: Yes, well, Alison has yet to be useful.",
        "Rosanna: You're evading.",
        "Craig: You want details?",
        "Rosanna: No. No, no, no. I said \"hands off.\" I promised that, and that's what I will deliver. But -- I have to warn you. Don't trust Alison Stewart.",
        "Craig: I know. I know. Now excuse me while I go find Lucy and -- you-know-who.",
        "Rosanna: No. Allow me. I'm nicer.",
        "Craig: And prettier.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Alison: Hello?",
        "Craig: Hey, Alison. You were supposed to report to me.",
        "Alison: Oh, hi, Lucy. Um -- sorry I'm late. It's just -- stuff came up.",
        "Craig: Okay, okay. How about you meet me at the Fairwinds gazebo? Now.",
        "Alison: Yeah, Lucy. That's great.",
        "Craig: Don't drive up to the house. Park by the carriage house and walk.",
        "Alison: Okay, Lucy. That's really cool. I'll be over there soon, okay? And, Lucy, I'm really glad that you called. I have to go now, warden. What, do I have to wrestle you to get out?",
        "Emily: No. No, you can go. But you just remember -- my offer still stands. Whatever's going on, Alison, I'm here for you, okay?",
        "Alison: Thanks, but I'm fine. Stop looking at me like that! Really, it's the truth. You may not realize this, but I've given up lying.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You know, I woke up this morning to an empty bed, an empty house. No sounds of a little kid sneaking snacks out of the fridge. My life as I knew it was over. And you know what I did? I went to work. And I blew up at everybody that crossed my path.",
        "Molly: Know what I did?",
        "Jack: Hmm-mm.",
        "Molly: I told myself that I could sleep. Tried. I couldn't. And then I blew up at Mike.",
        "Jack: You still wanna break something?",
        "Molly: Not as badly as I wanted to before. You?",
        "Jack: Not so much.",
        "Molly: Well -- imagine how relaxed we'd feel if we'd actually done it.",
        "Jack: Mm, yeah, but then I would've felt like a jerk and a total hypocrite.",
        "Molly: I guess drowning your sorrows with sex isn't your style, is it?",
        "Jack: I guess not. Part of me wishes it were.",
        "Molly: It's okay if you have to go.",
        "Jack: I guess I'd better. Uh -- shouldn't we talk about this or something?",
        "Molly: Pick apart our motives? Talk about how desperate we were and that we had every right and that we should forgive ourselves for getting carried away? There'll be time for that.",
        "Jack: You just let me know when.",
        "Molly: I will.",
        "Jack: I'll be thinking about you.",

        "Mike: Hey, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?",
        "Molly: No. Not exactly.",

        "Mike: Hey, Jack. Sorry to interrupt the revenge.",
        "Molly: Mike, get out!",
        "Mike: Thought I was doing you a favor, dropping by some things you might need.",
        "Molly: There is nothing that I need that you can give me now.",
        "Mike: Looks like Jack's taken care of that, hasn't he?",
        "Jack: Back off, Mike. Molly's had enough grief out of you.",
        "Mike: Wow! Instant payback. I mean, I get it on with Carly, and you can't wait to get it on with Carly's husband, huh?",
        "Molly: I don't owe you an explanation for anything.",
        "Mike: Hey, why explain? You know what? That takes up a lot of time. And that's definitely something you don't waste -- time. I was gone all of what, an hour? And already you're settling the score.",
        "Jack: I said back off, Mike!",
        "Molly: Jack, it's okay. You know what? You can think whatever you want about my reasons for sleeping with Jack. But I don't care. Because my making love to Jack had absolutely nothing to do with you.",

        "Rose: Here it is. Whoo! Wet dog. Stinks. Well, that's all right.",
        "Paul: It's pretty -- you know what? I'm gonna -- I'm gonna check the sinks, see if there's running water.",
        "Rose: Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.",
        "Paul: Check for leaks.",
        "Rose: I can see it now. You know, we're gonna do hair color in the back. Manicure station right here. And the people -- the customers who are not waiting for me on line outside can sit right here for me. And if they give me any lip, here, I'll just lock 'em up in this cage. Hey, maybe I'll crate-train Ms. Walsh. It's a dump. But it's got something, you know? I'm thinking, like, '80s retro.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I'm thinking there's a clog.",
        "Rose: Oh.",
        "Paul: This water's on. Why isn't it spraying?",
        "Rose: Don't worry about it.",
        "Paul: Something should be spraying.",
        "Rose: I can get the plumbers for that.",
        "Paul: No, we need to see what kind of shape this place was left in, right? I can fix this. And then we will be able to tell plumber exactly what --",
        "[Rose shrieks]",
        "Paul: All right. All right.",
        "[Rose laughing]",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rose: Well, that was -- very helpful.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and that is at no extra cost to you.",
        "Rose: So, what'd you do there, Mr. Clean?",
        "Paul: I'll show you. Come here. Come look.",
        "Rose: Mr. Clean, I don't think so.",
        "Paul: Rose, trust me. Trust --",
        "Rose: Okay.",
        "Paul: Really.",
        "Rose: Let me see. What did you do?",
        "Paul: There was a clog in here, and I just fixed it. See? It was right in there. See that?",
        "[Rose screams]",
        "[Paul laughing]",
        "Rose: That is just nasty!",
        "[Paul laughing]",

        "Aaron: Your dad wanted me to stay away from you, or leave town. I didn't do either, and I think it drove him a little crazy. But it's not all his fault. I'm not saying I didn't blow it big time with your dad.",
        "Lucy: Well, like how?",
        "Aaron: Well, a bunch of stuff. I mean, we didn't really get off on the right start. I kept you out real late. And we drove to Chicago to see this concert. We didn't even end up seeing the concert, and we got in a lot of trouble for it.",
        "Lucy: Well, that doesn't sound too awful.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, it made your dad crazy. It was all downhill from there. I mean, the closer we got, the madder he got. I'll be honest with you, Lucy. Your dad and I never really got along.",
        "Lucy: But you do now. So what's changed?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. I guess we want the same thing now. Just want to see you get better. What's wrong, Lucy?",
        "Lucy: Nothing. Thank you. For not lying to me. I want to know how things really were. And my memory is so random -- I just feel like you're the one person who will always tell me the truth.",
        "Aaron: Always.",
        "Lucy: I know.",

        "Alison: This is gonna be trickier than I thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Mm! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait! What about the hands-off-while- we-think policy that we were talking about?",
        "Paul: Oh, there is an exception to that policy in case of a flood.",
        "[Paul laughs]",
        "Rose: It's so good to hear you laugh. I have missed that so much!",
        "Paul: Yeah. Feels good.",
        "Rose: Hey, you know what? I have an idea. How about, if we can just laugh like this once in awhile, I won't tell another joke? How about that?",
        "Paul: That is impossible. If you weren't a smart mouth, you wouldn't be you.",
        "Rose: I just want to be the Rose that works for you.",
        "Paul: Are you being you right now? I love it.",
        "Rose: Look, I can't promise you how this is gonna turn out.",
        "Paul: I'm not asking you to be a fortuneteller.",
        "Rose: No.",
        "Paul: I just have this -- I have this feeling, Rose, and -- it's good enough for me.",
        "Rose: What feeling is that?",
        "Paul: Hope? I think there's a lot of hope for us.",

        "Craig: Where are Lucy and Aaron?",
        "Rosanna: They're gone.",
        "Craig: Gone where?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I couldn't find them.",
        "Craig: Well, excuse me, will you, while I get rid of that sex-crazed punk.",
        "Lucy: Aaron, slow down!",
        "Aaron: You got wheels now, Luce!",
        "Rosanna: Yes, the boy makes her laugh. By all means, destroy him.",
        "Craig: And this is what it's come to? You're going to ride my every little exaggeration?",
        "Rosanna: Go on. Get out of here. You're driving me nuts.",
        "Craig: All right. Grr.",
        "Lucy: Oh, where is he going?",
        "Rosanna: To walk the grounds.",
        "Aaron: Hey, that's what we just did.",
        "Lucy: There's even a side door with a ramp, so I can go all the way out to the gardens.",
        "Rosanna: Oh.",
        "Lucy: Dad thought of everything.",
        "[Rosanna laughs, sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Ah, what about our agreement, Alison?",
        "Alison: What about it?",
        "Craig: You guaranteed me Aaron would be out of Lucy's life and into yours. What happened?",
        "Alison: Well, I guess between my stepbrother being in a psych ward, my sister hounding me like a private eye, me changing tires and emptying bedpans, I've been a little bit busy!",
        "Craig: Ah, I see. Well, if you can't handle this, maybe you should go home.",
        "Alison: No way. Did you think I hiked across this frozen driveway just so I could catch a glimpse of Lucy and Aaron pawing at each other?",
        "Craig: Doing what?",
        "Alison: That's right. Right here in this -- I don't know what the heck you call this thing, but --",
        "Craig: A gazebo.",
        "Alison: Right. Great place for a grope. Which, by the way, wouldn't have happened if you held up your end of the deal. I can't do this alone. And if we don't move faster, it'll be too late to break up Lucy and Aaron, if it isn't too late already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Do you think I'm stupid?",
        "Molly: No, Mike. I just think you have the market cornered on treating people like they're stupid.",
        "Mike: I go, I mess up really bad, and I hurt you. So you go and you sleep with Jack, and you tell me it's not about me?",
        "Molly: I know this is gonna be really difficult for you to grasp, but not everything is about you. Not anymore. My life is my life. And there isn't a part of it that you can touch.",
        "Mike: Do you always get this mad at people that you don't care anything about?",
        "Molly: Thanks for the analysis, Dr. Freud, but if I even gave half a damn about you, I wouldn't be feeling so good right now.",
        "Mike: Oh, you feel good?",
        "Molly: Yeah. I feel extraordinarily good. I feel satisfied, fulfilled. Taken care of. Get it?",
        "[Molly sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I can't believe I've been here so long! I better get going. I gotta get back to the garage.",
        "Lucy: Well, you'll be back soon, right?",
        "Aaron: How's tomorrow?",
        "Lucy: Great.",
        "Aaron: And the day after that? And the day after that? And the day after that?",
        "Lucy: Well, I'll have to check my calendar. I could be running the marathon by then.",
        "[Aaron laughs]",
        "Rosanna: Are you leaving so soon, Aaron?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. I wanna let Lucy get some rest.",
        "Rosanna: Well, thank you again for the lovely present.",
        "Aaron: You're welcome. Lucy, see ya.",
        "Lucy: This is so right, you know?",
        "Rosanna: You mean, you and Aaron?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I mean, a couple weeks ago, I liked him. But -- not like this. It feels like we keep getting closer and closer.",
        "Rosanna: Mm. That's a good feeling, isn't it?",
        "Lucy: You really do know, don't you? I'm really glad you're here, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Me, too.",
        "Lucy: If I ask you a question, will you tell me the truth?",
        "Rosanna: Well, if I can. Yes.",
        "Lucy: Dad used to hate Aaron. How bad was it?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I heard Lucy say that, what she can't remember, she lets Aaron remember for her.",
        "Craig: That's dangerous.",
        "Alison: That's how much she trusts him. So, since she totally believes everything he tells her, then certain versions of history --",
        "Craig: Lies, you mean?",
        "Alison: Oh, whatever. Certain stories I was going to tell her won't work. So what am I gonna do to make her turn against him?",
        "Craig: Alison, keep your voice down. Pull yourself together and -- pay attention. I have a plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey. You okay?",
        "Molly: No.",
        "Jack: You lied.",
        "Molly: And I used to be really good at it. And now it just felt really -- weird. You mad?",
        "Jack: Mad? No. If anything, I'm flattered. Why'd you do it?",
        "Molly: I had to.",
        "Jack: Don't you think telling the truth would have been better?",
        "Molly: And boast that I'm a better person because I didn't give in to the moment the way he did with Carly?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, at least you'd have the truth on your side.",
        "Molly: Spoken like a true g-man.",
        "Jack: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you think that I told Mike that we slept together to get back at him?",
        "Jack: Didn't you?",
        "Molly: No. There's one thing that I told Mike tonight was true. I need to look out for myself from now on. I need to protect myself. My life is my own.",
        "Jack: So I was your cover?",
        "Molly: He brought by a duffel bag of my stuff, Jack. Tomorrow, it'll be my keys or my mail. Just one thing at a time, until he pulled me back in. And I can't let him do that.",
        "Jack: All right. So you pushed him away.",
        "Molly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: You're brave.",
        "Molly: No. I'm scared. 'Cause I can't let that man back in my heart, Jack. I can't let him hurt me like that again. See, I think you're the one who's brave.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: For stopping an extraordinarily sexy woman from giving me an extraordinary night?",
        "Molly: Thank you for saying that.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Molly: Ah, my ego needed the boost.",
        "Jack: No, I don't even want to know what I missed out on tonight. I'm not just saying that. You're an incredible woman, Molly. Thank you.",
        "Molly: What are you thanking me for?",
        "Jack: Being you. Listen, anytime you want to talk it over --",
        "Molly: Sure. Hey. Sorry you didn't get to eat.",
        "Jack: I'll call you.",
        "Molly: Okay. And after the anger it all turns silent and the everyday turns solitary so we came to February."
