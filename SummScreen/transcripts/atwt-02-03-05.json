        "Mike: You found me.",
        "Katie: Oh, great. Listen, because I was talking --",
        "Mike: Whatever it is, it will have to wait. I've got to get to another job. All right? You guys got a minute? Come here. I've got a meeting at Memorial, okay? But that doesn't mean we need to slack off. All right? We've got a lot of extra work ahead of us. Okay? So, once we get done at the hospital, we've got to come back over here. Which means we are going to pull a lot of long hours. That's why I need \u0096",

        "Alison: Aaron, I just got your message, what happened?",
        "Aaron: You are not gong to believe this one.",
        "Alison: It's about Dusty?",
        "Aaron: I came by to ask if I could manage Metro, you know, since he and Craig are moving on.",
        "Alison: Okay. What did he say?",
        "Aaron: I had it all planned out, you know? A million reasons why I'd be the guy for this job. A million ways to knock down any argument they gave me. I was ready to go down for a fight.",
        "Alison: If you tell me that Dusty Donovan turned you down --",
        "Aaron: I get two words out, and you know what he says to me? \"Go for it, kid.\" Throws me the keys!",
        "[Aaron laughs]",
        "Alison: You're kidding!",
        "Aaron: He moves on!",
        "Alison: That's amazing! You're amazing! Oh, this is the best news ever!",
        "Aaron: I know. I'm completely blown away. I mean, I can't believe he believes in me. He trusts me.",

        "Aaron: Nope, nope. Not yet. Not yet.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Aaron: Because first I have to figure out how to do this job without blowing it.",

        "Sierra: Be sure and look at this. Great, thank you.",
        "Jennifer: Good morning, Sierra.",
        "Sierra: Ah, hi.",
        "Jennifer: Welcome aboard.",
        "Sierra: Thank you. And I see that you're doing some great things with Street Jeans.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, thank you. Well, it's only the beginning. I can't wait to show you our ideas for the future.",
        "Sierra: And I can't wait to hear them. But first, I want to introduce you to who took over Jordan's position.",
        "Craig: Ah, Jennifer! What a pleasure.",

        "Julia: Still no dial tone.",
        "Holden: So, what do you think?",
        "Julia: They're great. Thank you very much.",
        "Holden: Sure, a little furniture polish and I think they'll be okay.",
        "Julia: They're beautiful. I was wondering where you'd dashed off to while I was in the shower.",
        "Holden: I thought that having breakfast at the table, sitting in chairs, would be nice. Until we get like civilized people.",
        "Julia: Okay, well, there's only one problem with your civilized breakfast scenario.",
        "Holden: What's that?",
        "Julia: We don't have pots or pans, or plates, or silverware, or a coffee maker. Or coffee.",
        "Holden: No coffee?",
        "Julia: No coffee. And I am about to go through withdrawals in like five minutes. It's really not pretty. I'm talking shakes, massive headache -- it's not something you want to be around for.",
        "Holden: Hmm. You know what? I think I've got a fix for that.",
        "Julia: You do?",
        "Holden: Guaranteed cure.",
        "Julia: Well, if you're thinking what I'm thinking --",
        "Holden: Uh-hmm?",
        "Julia: I think that we'd better put a rush on the mattress order. Because as much as I like roughing it -- and I do -- there're some things I still prefer doing in a bed.",
        "Holden: Got it.",
        "Julia: Okay.",
        "Holden: All right. So I'll put that on my list. We need coffee, a mattress, pots and pans, what else?",
        "Julia: Just you.",
        "Holden: You kiss me like that again, I may not leave.",
        "Julia: Oh.",

        "Lily: Again, how could that be possible? He left at exactly the same time this morning. Are you sure? Thank you for calling.",
        "Carly: What's wrong?",
        "Lily: Everything is wrong. Luke -- he skipped school again today.",
        "Carly: Well, what do you think happened? Could he be with Holden?",
        "Lily: That's who I'm calling right now. He turned off his phone again. He only turns off his phone when he's with her. Does he think the world just stops turning when he's with that woman? That his family just goes into hibernation? I can't take this anymore. I'm at the end of my rope.",
        "Carly: All right. Just hang in there a little bit longer. Once our plan goes into effect --",
        "Lily: If by plan, you mean this laughable hope against hope that some man from Julia's past is going to walk through that door and solve all our problems? The answer to our prayers? Dream on.",
        "Carly: Well, wait a minute. Now the manager at his apartment complex promised me that she would give him the message.",
        "Lily: Right. A message from someone he's never heard of. You really think he's going to take that seriously? He's probably already blown it off.",
        "Carly: Well, well -- look who just waltzed in that door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hold still.",
        "Katie: I just had the craziest d\u00e9ja-vu.",
        "Mike: On account of all the times I've had to nurse you back to health?",
        "Katie: Oh, I, um -- recall a couple of times I had to lick your wounds.",
        "Mike: It's funny how I managed to stay out of danger while you were gone.",
        "Katie: Must be a coincidence.",
        "Mike: Right. Coincidence. There you go. It's almost as good as new.",
        "Katie: Thank you. What?",
        "Mike: Something ain't right.",
        "Katie: Oh -- oh, no, the paint! Oh, I forgot.",
        "Mike: There's paint on the bleachers.",
        "Katie: I know, I was painting different colors to see what they look like in this light. I should've warned you.",
        "Mike: I've got a meeting at Memorial --",
        "Katie: I know. I'm so sorry.",
        "Mike: What am I supposed to do now?",
        "Katie: I know exactly what to do. Drop your drawers, Kasnoff. I'm about to make you a very happy man.",

        "Carly: Shh. Let's see if we can hear who he's calling.",
        "Keith: Yeah, hi, can I have the number to Memorial Hospital, please?",
        "Lily: It is him. Look. It really is him. We did it. We did it.",
        "Carly: I guess Julia is as irresistible as she thinks she is.",
        "Keith: Yeah, hello. Can you connect me with Julia Larrabee? Could I have her floor, please? Well, then, could I have human resources? Yes. Yes, it's important.",
        "Lily: Okay. You can say \"I told you so\" as many times as you want. He's hot on Julia's trail.",

        "Julia: Luke, what are you doing here? If you're looking for your dad --",
        "Luke: I followed him here. And I just saw him leave.",
        "Julia: Okay. Come in. I'd offer you something, but I'm fresh out of everything.",
        "Luke: I don't want anything from you, except for my father back.",
        "Julia: Okay, Luke, come on.",
        "Luke: God, I can't believe I felt sorry for you. When my Uncle Jack got his memory back, I felt bad that you and J.J. got dumped. Because J.J.'s a nice kid, except for the fact that his mom is a complete fake.",
        "Julia: Come on, Luke, you don't even know me.",
        "Luke: Oh, you want to bet? Look, you may have my dad fooled for now, but I can see right through you. And pretty soon, he will, too.",

        "Lucinda: Paolo -- come Michelangelo. Artista! Oh! [Lucinda giggles] [Dusty clears his throat] Oh, hi. Hi. Sit down.",
        "Dusty: I thought we had a meeting.",
        "Lucinda: We do. Sit down. Take a chair.",
        "Dusty: You sure you don't want me to come back? I hate to interrupt a woman in the throws of ecstasy, you know?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, darling, I'm perfectly capable of doing business as usual. Unless of course, you're too distracted?",
        "Dusty: Well, of course, I'm distracted. I'm a guy.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Yes, I am naked. I'm naked under the sheet. Even I get naked. All right, so now that that question is answered, can we -- could we do some work?",
        "Dusty: I'm ready if you're ready. If you say so.",
        "Lucinda: All right. Okay. Oh, uh -- this is Paolo. He can't shake hands with you, because his hands are otherwise engaged.",
        "Dusty: Ciao.",
        "Lucinda: Paolo, amico, ti presento Dusty Donovani.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Dusty: Ciao, amigo.",
        "Lucinda: He doesn't speak much English. He doesn't have to. His hands speak volumes.",
        "Dusty: Uh-huh. Uh, what did you want to see me about?",
        "Lucinda: Well -- well, darling, um, we're starting a new business relationship. These crucial weeks, they're very important. They're so important, and I just wanted to touch base with you, find out how you're doing.",
        "Dusty: I'm fine. I'm doing fine.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. [Lucinda laughs] Pants on fire!",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Lucinda: You're miffed that Craig joined the company at the same time that you did.",
        "[Dusty laughs]",
        "Dusty: Yeah, of course I am. That's no secret. I don't like the guy.",
        "Lucinda: Neither do I. And he's not going to last.",

        "Jennifer: If this is a joke, it isn't very funny.",
        "Sierra: We are doing a little restructuring at worldwide",
        "Jennifer: And Craig is taking over Street Jeans?",
        "Sierra: Why don't you take a seat, and we'll discuss it?",
        "Jennifer: No, I would rather stand. On second thought, I would prefer not to be here at all. This man destroyed my family. He ruined my mother's company, to say nothing of what he actually did to my mother. And he didn't stop there. He is responsible for the end of Carly's career.",
        "Craig: Carly went on hiatus.",
        "Jennifer: He tried to frame my brother for murder. Need I say more?!",
        "Sierra: Why don't you take a deep breath, okay? You've had such success with your company. It would really be a shame to --",
        "Jennifer: No, the only shame would be in working for a man who has none. I can barely stand to breathe the same air as he does, so please, do not ask me to report to him.",
        "Craig: I think there are all things we'd like to forget, Jennifer.",
        "Sierra: Craig --",
        "Craig: And we can either forgive and forget and move on or not. This is only a business, so the only thing I want is what's best for the company. That means profits, for you and for us.",
        "Jennifer: Not interested. Sorry we've wasted our time.",
        "Sierra: You know, I really hate to do this, but Street Jeans is a Worldwide company, and our decision is final. So you need to find a way to work with Craig.",
        "Jennifer: And what happens if I quit?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: First things first, we've got to check the inventory, see what we need before we reopen. Second thing, we've got to call -- we've got to call Rafi and tell him that's it a go. And we're gonna need a staff meeting -- write this down -- staff meeting. Make sure everybody's cool with what's going on here.",
        "Alison: Oh, you think that they're going to have a problem with that? They love you. You don't need a bunch of meetings to prove that.",
        "Aaron: I know, I know, but you know, it's different now, Ali. If something goes wrong, I can't run to Dusty. I got to handle it myself.",
        "Alison: And what's gonna go wrong?",
        "Aaron: Well, first of all, the cooler in the back is on its last legs. It breaks down twice a week.",
        "Alison: So call a repairman.",
        "Aaron: Actually, I don't even need to call a repairman. Just a good thump on the side, and she gets working again.",
        "Alison: Okay, say you know everything there is to know about this place.",
        "Aaron: Well, I know about the cooler, and I know about stocking inventory and that Wycleff has the best wines.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Best wines, cheapest. Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: And you know, you know how to handle the customers. And I've seen you, and you know how to do that better than anyone. So give yourself a break. You've totally earned the right to manage this place.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I guess I have.",
        "Alison: And you got the job without having to convince Dusty. And you know that you don't have to convince me. So what are you worrying about?",
        "Aaron: It's just, I've never -- I've never been in charge of something so big before, you know? I was the gopher guy, and now I'm the go-to guy, and that means I have to turn a profit now. And can I put up the numbers?",
        "Alison: Of course you can. Trust me. You're going to make Holden and Dusty and this whole club proud.",
        "Aaron: That's good, as long as the one person I make proudest is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What is the holdup? You helped me with my cheek. Let me help you with your pants.",
        "Mike: I still don't -- I don't think it's a good idea.",
        "Katie: Why not? Just let me help you. It's my fault that I didn't warn you about the bleachers. And I mean, you have that big meeting at Memorial, right?",
        "Mike: I've got a meeting with the bigwigs about our progress.",
        "Katie: Okay, and you don't want to walk in looking like a slacker. So just take off your clothes, let me wash them, and you will be on your way.",
        "Mike: You know what? I'll just -- I'll go home, I'll change.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, wait. You don't have enough time to go home. Those need to get in the wash now, or the paint's never gonna come out. Oh, I remember these. These are your favorites, huh? And now they're all worn in, just like you like them.",
        "Mike: Yeah, but -- I do not have time to go home.",
        "Katie: Oh, is that the problem? You're afraid I can't handle the behind that's building a denim dynasty? Well, let me tell you something. It's nothing I haven't seen before, thousands of times.",
        "Mike: Look, we don't need to get into this, okay?",
        "Katie: You're afraid I'm gonna take one look and just lose all self-control?",
        "Mike: It wouldn't be the first time.",
        "[Mike laughs]",
        "Katie: Well, it's not like I can't get a visual anytime I want. All I have to do is close my eyes. In fact, I think I'll just close my eyes right now. I'm closing.",
        "Mike: Okay. All right, fine. You win.",
        "Katie: Oh, two best words in the language -- well, second best. All right, I am gonna go run and find you something to slip into while I make a new man out of you. Chop-chop, we don't have all day.",

        "Craig: Oh, why quit now? You just got here. You haven't even had a chance to put together the presentation you probably spent half the night doing.",
        "Jennifer: I had no intention of making this presentation to you.",
        "Craig: Why not? I'm a great audience. You should be shopping it around. In nine months, everything will be pass\u00e9. You better pitch it now, huh? You have nothing to lose.",
        "Sierra: I'd love to see what you came up with.",
        "Craig: And I will be as quiet as a grave.",
        "Sierra: Ready when you are, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Very well. I will make this presentation for Sierra's sake. I'm not promising anything after that. Well, Street Jeans is going places -- places you've never even imagined.",

        "Luke: Look, my dad can see the truth, and that's what's gonna happen with you. He's just a little blind right now. He'll get over it though.",
        "Julia: I know it makes you feel better to think that, but your dad's not with me, Luke, because he's been blinded or because I'm tricking him. He's with me because he wants to.",
        "Luke: He already has a family.",
        "Julia: I know, and when he gets back here, the three of us should sit down and talk about this honestly.",
        "Luke: There's nothing to discuss! Look, you obviously don't care what you're doing to my mother. But what about my little sisters? What have they done to you? And did you ever feel bummed out that J.J. doesn't have a father? Well, neither do we.",
        "Julia: No, that's not true, okay? Your dad is doing everything he can to make sure he takes care of everyone here. It's a difficult situation. But I think all of us are saying and doing things that we are going to regret.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm just trying to stand up for my family, and I'm not going to take that back.",
        "Julia: What about going through my stuff, Luke, huh?",
        "Luke: What are you talking about?",
        "Julia: Do you want to take that -- you want to take that back? My stuff at Emma's. Somebody went through my stuff.",
        "Luke: Look, if I want to know something, I ask. If I want to say something, I say it. All I want to know is why you're wrecking my family?",
        "Julia: This is a hard thing, okay, when parents split up. It's difficult.",
        "Luke: Oh, you want to act like they're divorced. They're not. They're separated. What? Did he say something? They're getting divorced?",
        "Julia: No, no, no, you know? But no matter what happens between your parents, they both love you.",

        "Keith: Well, what do you think I want? I want to see if you're okay. You're so close. I don't -- I don't understand why you didn't call me if you were in trouble.",

        "Lily: How do you know that?",
        "Carly: Well, he didn't drive all the way here from Chicago just to make one phone call and get shut down. Trust me, he is not through with Julia yet.",

        "Holden: What is going on? Why is he skipping school again?",
        "Lily: I don't know. He probably thinks that his father is falling in love with another woman, so his world as he knows it is falling apart.",
        "Holden: That's not fair, Lily.",
        "Lily: You have no idea. You won't allow yourself to see what this is doing to the children. They miss their father, Holden.",

        "Carly: Hey, this is just the beginning. We are not gonna give up yet.",
        "Lily: No, it's great. Keith was a great idea, but he's too little, too late. Julia already has Holden wrapped around her finger. I might as well kiss my marriage good-bye.",

        "Julia: Just wait for your dad.",
        "Luke: Why, so both of you can try to -- try to convince me that I'm too young to understand or that this is the best thing for everyone? 'Cause trust me, I understand, and I think it reeks. I feel bad for J.J. having a mother like you.",
        "Julia: Well, you can think whatever you want about me.",

        "Julia: But your father loves you.",
        "Luke: I know how my father feels about me and he's not my problem. You are. What, I'm supposed to like the fact that you've ripped my family apart, or that my father can't find time for anybody except you and J.J.?",
        "Julia: That's not true.",
        "Luke: Oh, you act like you're just some sweet, misunderstood mother, looking out for her child. No, you're looking out for yourself. And my mother knows that, and so do I. It won't take long for my dad.",
        "Julia: Wait. Just wait, Luke. Look, stay and wait for your dad. You hate me. That's fine. Don't be mad at him, okay? He's a good guy.",

There are plenty of kids in the heartland who want to look cutting-edge but without getting into gangster territory, and I do believe that Street Jeans can fill that niche perfectly.",
        "Sierra: Well, that may be, but it's still a fledgling company, and I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves.",

        "Craig: No, no. You have a nice product, a nice concept, but it needs to be nurtured. You don't want to dump it onto the big market too soon, or you'll crash and burn. I can show you how to avoid that.",
        "Sierra: You should listen to him. He knows what he's talking about.",

        "Lucinda: If that girl -- if that girl has one flaw, it's her eternal optimism. Jungle creatures like Craig don't change their spots or their stripes or even their modus operandi. No, no, no, no. He's going to start out full-throttle charming, and then that old ego is going to rear its ugly head.",
