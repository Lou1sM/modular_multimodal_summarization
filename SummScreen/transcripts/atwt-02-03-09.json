        "When Eliza goes missing, Meg turns her terror and anger on Barbara assuming that she was a party to helping Paul kidnap her daughter. Barbara assures her that she would never be involved. The police are called, as Jack takes lead on the case. However, Jack finds no leads of Paul being seen by anyone. Meg feels guilty that she started this ball rolling when she threatened to take Eliza away from Paul to hurt him and now he is hurting her back. Dusty supports Meg. Josie leaves a goodbye letter for Dusty and heads out of town. She is stunned to find Paul in her backseat ordering her to drive or he will shoot her, as he holds something to her shoulder under a blanket. Josie tries to talk some sense into Paul, but he believes there is no turning back and Meg left him with no choice. Josie learns that Paul was never holding a gun on her. A frantic Barbara calls Paul, who finally picks up, and begs him to come home. He won't come back and orders her not to tell the police she talked with him or she will never see him or Eliza again. Carly, Craig and Johnny hang out after Parker goes to a friend's house for a \u0091sleepover.' Liberty is supposedly doing the same thing, but little do their parents know, thanks to Craig's money they are going to see Metallica in Chicago. When Janet runs into the parent of the girl Liberty is supposed to be with, she finds out that Liberty set her up. Janet goes to speak with Carly, as they worry about their kids being out overnight together. Craig admits to giving Parker money and him mentioning the concert. Carly and Janet are furious, as Craig offers to go find them and Carly goes with him. Janet calls Jack with news of what their children have been up to, as Jack is furious. Later, Craig and Carly bring home the kids, as Jack, Janet and Carly light into them and ground them both. Jack is furious with Craig, as is Carly. Carly witnesses a sweet moment between him and Johnny, but she can't get past what Craig did again involving Parker and she and Craig fight; she thinks Jack was right and he isn't good to be around her son. Craig pleads his case explaining he is trying to be a friend to Parker when he pushes his parents away, but Carly won't have it and orders him out of her life. Meg continues to frantically worry about Eliza when the tunnels under Fairwinds are another dead end. Dusty assures Meg that Paul would never hurt his baby; he knows Paul loves Eliza. Josie and Paul wind up hiding out at TV station where Josie is exhausted; Paul tells her to go to sleep and they will figure things out when she wakes up. Dusty reads Josie's letter and calls her; he is sorry she felt she had to leave, but he wonders if she has news about where Paul took Eliza. Paul sees the call, from Dusty, hears the message and deletes it all while Josie is sleeping nearby."

        "Meg: How?",
        "Dusty: By going straight to the source. Where is he?",
        "Barbara: Who?",
        "Dusty: Your son, Paul. He took Eliza -- where?",
        "Barbara: No, Dusty, no!",

        "Dusty: Where is he, Barbara? Where did he take Eliza?",
        "Barbara: Listen to me, would you? I was sitting right there with Meg, when the lights went out. I'm as confused as anybody else. I don't know what's happening here.",
        "Meg: Yes, you do. So just stop lying to us and give me back my baby!",
        "Josie: What's going on?",
        "Clerk: We lost power for a minute. The lights went out. But everything's okay now.",

        "Clerk: Lakeview hotel.",
        "Josie: Donovan -- maybe saying this in a letter is the easy way out, but I just couldn't face you again. I've decided it's time for me to move on. There's obviously no place for me in your life or in Oakdale. Just know, I will always wish you the best. Josie. Could you put this in Dusty Donovan's mailbox for me? Thank you.",

        "Janet: Who's Sasha?",
        "Liberty: She's just this girl from my English class. Actually, I think you met her mom for, like, five minutes at that car wash thing?",
        "Janet: The car -- yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right, right, right.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, and I mean, she just called me and invited me. And I really don't want to sit here and watch you work while Brad and Katie are out of town. So --",

        "Carly: Where? Is your daddy talking to me? Is that what he's doing?",
        "Craig: Wow, you have a magic touch. That's the first time he's smiled since we got here.",
        "Carly: Well, that's because little boys don't typically like shopping in high- end boutiques, Craig. There's nothing fun or shiny in there.",
        "Craig: You haven't met Courtney. Lisa's new sales clerk. Very shiny.",
        "Johnny: Can we go to your house?",
        "Craig: Sorry. Clearly, the thrill of picking new school clothes has worn off. Hey, Buddy, not tonight. We can't go to Carly's every day. She's a very busy woman.",
        "Johnny: Please?",

        "Barbara: My God, what do you think of me, Meg?",
        "Dusty: Where was Paul the last time you saw him?",

        "Barbara: He wanted me to meet with Meg and see Eliza.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Barbara: He wanted me to see her, to make sure that she was okay.",
        "Meg: He knew she's okay. He knows I would never let anything happen to her.",

        "Josie: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, you can't. You can't do this. This isn't right.",
        "Paul: She's my baby girl. Nobody's going to keep her from me, not even Meg.",
        "Josie: Meg would never do that. This is dangerous. She's not even in a car seat.",
        "Paul: I'm wearing a seat belt. You just keep driving.",
        "Josie: What do you want from me?",
        "Paul: Well, you're leaving town, right?",
        "Josie: How did you know that?",
        "Paul: Well, I saw you putting stuff in the trunk. Wasn't hard to figure out.",
        "Josie: Okay, where are you planning on going?",
        "Paul: Wherever you're planning on taking me.",
        "Josie: Well, that's good. Because I'm planning on turning this car around, and I'm taking you back.",

        "Jack: Paul?",
        "Barbara: We don't know that.",
        "Dusty: Yes, we do. Your son's a psychopath.",
        "Jack: Can we calm down, please? Start from the beginning.",
        "Meg: Barbara called me. She asked to meet down here so she could see Eliza.",
        "Jack: So you were here when it happened?",
        "Dusty: She was following orders from Paul.",

        "Jack: Reynolds -- I want you to pull Paul Ryan's plates from the DMV and put out an Amber Alert. Also, I want statements from everybody who was in the lounge or the lobby at the time the lights went out. Someone had to have seen something.",
        "Dusty: Pull the security tapes too, would you?",
        "Meg: Jack, Eliza's still a baby. Paul could've walked out of here with her under his jacket, and nobody would've known.",
        "Jack: Its okay, it's okay. I'm going to do everything I can to find her, okay?",
        "Meg: But you will find her, right? Promise me nothing will happen to her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: You're not going to shoot me.",
        "Paul: No?",
        "Josie: No, because if you do, then the car will go off the road and we'll crash.",
        "Paul: Well, I've survived worse.",
        "Josie: You would do that to your little girl? I don't think so.",
        "Paul: If I'm as crazy as everybody thinks I am, what's to stop me?",
        "Josie: You're her father, Paul. That trumps everything.",
        "Paul: You're no shrink. Your job is to keep driving.",
        "Josie: And your job is to protect your daughter.",
        "Paul: I'd rather die with Eliza than live without her.",
        "Josie: You would really do that to Meg? You would take away her little girl that way?",
        "Paul: You shut up about Meg. What do you know about Meg?",
        "Josie: I don't think you're crazy, Paul. I think that you're hurting right now. But things are going to get better. I know that they will.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, you thought you had a shot with Dusty, too. Turns out you've been wrong about a lot of things.",

        "Jack: Any luck reaching Paul?",
        "Barbara: I keep trying, he won't pick up.",
        "Jack: Stay on it. If Paul did send you here on purpose --",
        "Dusty: Of course he did.",
        "Jack: You're the one person he's going to try to contact, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Okay.",
        "Jack: Any idea where he might've gone with Eliza?",
        "Meg: No. If he's not in Barbara's suite, I don't know where he'd go.",
        "Dusty: You searched the house?",
        "Jack: And the grounds. No sign of him. One thing we know for sure is that the cars are accounted for.",
        "Meg: So, he's on foot?",
        "Jack: Looks that way. I've sent units to the bus station, train station, airport --",
        "Meg: Airport? So he might try to leave the country with her?",
        "Dusty: No, we'll find them before that happens.",
        "Meg: Okay, what can I do? What can I do to help find my child?",
        "Jack: Keep your phone on. Keep your phone on, and try to get some rest. It could be a long night.",

        "Sasha's mom: I called in a takeout order for Carter.",
        "Janet: Carter -- right, right, right. Are you Sasha's mom? Right, right, I'm Liberty Ciccone's mother, Janet. I met you at the car wash a long time ago.",
        "Sasha's mom: Oh, yes, Liberty is such a doll.",
        "Janet: Well, she takes after me. So, cheeseburger and fries? Cheeseburger and fries, that's it? What are you going to feed the rest of the family?",
        "Sasha's mom: Oh, it's just me tonight, I'm afraid. Sasha's in with her father in Indiana. His mother isn't feeling well.",
        "Janet: Sasha's in Indiana? I am so sorry to hear that.",

        "Carly: Well, Johnny conked out in Parker's room before I could even start that video.",
        "Craig: Chip off the old block.",

        "Carly: Hello.",
        "Janet: Hi. Is Liberty here?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Janet: Is Parker?",
        "Carly: No, he's spending the night --",
        "Both: At a friend's house.",
        "Janet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: How did you know that?",
        "Janet: Because that's the exact same story that Liberty gave me. Only, guess what? It ain't true.",
        "Carly: Oh. Come in.",
        "Craig: Mrs. Snyder, hello.",
        "Janet: Hi. Could you call Parker, please? Because I keep trying to call Liberty, and she is not picking up.",
        "Carly: Sure. Oh, straight to voicemail. But you know what? I'll call Chase's house. That's the boy he's with.",
        "Janet: Well, I can pretty much guarantee you that he's not there. No, no, he and Liberty are together somewhere. I don't know where. And since it's an overnight thing, I can pretty much guess what they might be doing.",
        "Carly: Okay. Let's not panic, though. Let me call Chase's mom and we'll be sure.",
        "Craig: I think you can save the phone call.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Craig: She's right. Liberty and Parker are probably together.",
        "Carly: Well, how would you know that, Craig? You didn't give him your car again, did you?",
        "Craig: No, no, no. Nothing like that.",
        "Janet: Well, what is it like, then?",
        "[Clears throat]",
        "Craig: Remember how I asked Parker to buy Johnny some toys yesterday?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Craig: Well, I gave him some money to spend on himself as a thank you. And when I did, he said something about tickets to --",
        "Janet: Oh, my God. Metallica.",
        "Craig: That's it.",
        "Janet: In Chicago.",
        "Carly: Chicago? Craig, I'm going to kill you.",
        "Janet: Oh, no. Not if I kill him first.",
        "Carly: Exactly how much money did you give Parker?",
        "Craig: I'm not exactly sure.",
        "Janet: Oh, great. You hand him a fistful of cash. And now, the kids are in Chicago with who knows how much money. You know, Jack and I told them that they couldn't go to that concert. You completely undermined us.",
        "Craig: Well, I wasn't trying to undermine anyone. I didn't know I was doing anything wrong.",
        "Carly: Yes, you did. That's why we're hearing about this now. Because you got caught.",
        "Craig: You're acting like I did this on purpose.",
        "Carly: Didn't you?",
        "Craig: Of course not! Parker did me a favor, I just wanted to pay him back.",
        "Carly: Since when do you ask a 16-year-old for favors, anyway?",
        "Craig: I thought he would know better than I what a boy Johnny's age would like to play with. So I asked him to go to a toy store for me.",
        "Carly: And what did you think he was going to do when you handed him all that money?",
        "Craig: Certainly nothing bad. I assumed since he'd mentioned the concert to me, he'd already cleared it with you.",
        "Carly: Well, he hadn't. And now, we don't know where our children are, or when they'll be home.",
        "Janet: I'm going to call Jack.",
        "Craig: No, there's no point in calling Jack.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Craig: Because I'm going to go to Chicago. I'm going to find Liberty and Parker, and I'll bring them both home for you.",
        "Janet: How do you expect to find them?",
        "Craig: You said they went to see Metallica. I'll start there.",
        "Janet: In a sea full of people? You really think you can find them?",
        "Craig: When I want something, I have ways of getting it.",
        "Janet: Carly?",
        "Carly: Well, I guess I would feel a little better knowing that they're at least with one adult.",
        "Craig: You're absolutely right. Excuse me. Would you like to ride shotgun?",
        "Carly: Wait, aren't you forgetting something?",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Carly: Your son -- little boy, sleeping upstairs, real cute, little? You can't just leave him here.",
        "Janet: I'll watch him.",
        "Craig: Are you sure?",
        "Janet: Yes. I'm fine. I already skipped out on my shift. I might as well go for broke.",
        "Craig: Thank you very much.",
        "Janet: Don't thank me. Just bring those kids home safely.",
        "Craig: I will.",

        "Jack: No one matching Paul's description's been seen at the airport, either. What have you got off the Amber Alert?",
        "Cop: We haven't gotten a single call yet.",
        "Jack: Damn it. Well, I don't think we're going to get anything new until morning.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Jack: Excuse me for a second, would you? Hey, Janet.",
        "Janet: Hi, how ya doing?",
        "Jack: Oh, it's been a rough night. I'm happy to hear from you.",
        "Janet: Well, I think you might change your mind after you hear what I have to say.",
        "Jack: What now?",
        "Janet: Well, don't get mad, but I'm at Carly's.",
        "Jack: I thought you were working.",
        "Janet: Yeah, I was. But now, I am babysitting Johnny, while Craig and Carly go to Chicago.",
        "Jack: What? How'd you get roped into that?",
        "Janet: They went to go find Liberty and Parker.",
        "Jack: Parker and Liberty are in Chicago? Since when?",
        "Janet: Well, do you remember when Craig asked Parker to buy those toys for Johnny?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Well, as a thank you, Craig gave him a little extra cash. And he went and bought Metallica tickets with that cash.",
        "Jack: We told them they couldn't do that.",
        "Janet: No, Honey. We told him that we couldn't afford it. Liberty and Parker found a way around that.",
        "Jack: I cannot believe this.",
        "Janet: Well, you know what? They'll probably be home by the time you're finished with your shift, so --",
        "Jack: I think I want to be there when they walk in the door.",
        "Janet: Jack, you don't have to do this.",
        "Jack: Yes, I do. I'll see you soon. Hey, Reynolds, I've got to take care of something. If anybody calls in with a new lead on Ryan, I've got my cell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: This is all my fault.",
        "Dusty: No. Paul set this in motion.",
        "Meg: I was the one that threatened to keep Eliza from him. And now, I used her to hurt him. And he's using her to hurt me.",
        "Dusty: What can I do?",
        "Meg: Just keep me from falling apart. I need to be strong for my little girl. And I don't think I can do it on my own.",
        "Dusty: You're not alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
