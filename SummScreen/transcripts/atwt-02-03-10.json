        "Carly: Oh! Jack! You're back already.",
        "Jack: We -- we flew in last night.",
        "Carly: I'm just getting in now.",
        "Jack: I can see that. I hope the rest of your trip was a success.",
        "Carly: It was good. Yours?",
        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. We got a lot of helpful information from the specialists.",
        "Carly: Great. And Liberty? Is she okay?",
        "Jack: Off and on. She's still angry. But right now, that's probably a good thing.",
        "Carly: I think so, too. So, what are you doing here?",
        "Jack: S -- sorry. Yeah, I had to pick up this permission slip for Sage's school trip.",
        "Carly: Yeah, right. I -- I think I was supposed to have that in a couple of days ago.",
        "Jack: You've had a lot on your mind.",
        "Carly: So have you.",
        "Jack: Well, at some point, we need to talk about, uh, their winter breaks.",
        "Carly: How about right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You've been working too much.",
        "Alison: Well, I have no choice. I mean, I have to save up, uh -- thank you -- I have to save up vacation days, you know, for our wedding, I mean, unless you want to get married in the on-call room on one of my five-minute breaks.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I was actually wondering if my granddad can perform the ceremony, like -- like the captain of a ship.",
        "Alison: No. No way. We are having a real church wedding with all the trimmings, even if it kills me.",
        "Casey: See, that's the thing, you know? At this rate, I don't think you're gonna make it to Valentine's Day. I'm worried. You're so tired all the time.",
        "Alison: Well, I -- I try to sleep, but I can't. I mean, it's -- I keep having these weird dreams and waking up.",
        "Casey: What kind of dreams?",
        "[Alison remembering]",
        "Alison: [Dreaming] What are you doing here?",
        "Mick: Waiting for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Half the time, I -- I don't even remember them.",
        "Casey: You -- you're just stressed out, you know, working, planning the wedding. You know, maybe you should let me take care of the wedding plans.",
        "Alison: Yeah. I don't think so. I'm not getting married in some after-hours basement club with Weezer playing our wedding march.",
        "Casey: Um, and why not? That sounds good to me. Seriously, we need to find out what can help you sleep. And I, of course, have a few ideas.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm sure you do.",
        "Casey: Mm.",
        "Alison: You know, you're right though. I was just -- it's just pre-wedding stress. I'll be fine.",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Emily remembering]",
        "Mick: Emily, what are you doing here?",
        "[Emily gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You still got this.",
        "Carly: What? Oh.",
        "Jack: Yeah, we, uh -- we got this when we went to that, uh, Cubs game together. Remember?",
        "Carly: God, that was a long time ago.",
        "Jack: A whole other life.",
        "Carly: Take it if you want it. It's yours.",
        "Jack: No. I couldn't do that. This is its home. It belongs here. So, we're, uh -- we're cool with Sage taking that ski trip with the Thompson's?",
        "Carly: Yeah. She's been talking about it for weeks. J.J.'s been researching the trails for her from school and -- and e-mailing her.",
        "Jack: It sounds like she's gonna have a great time.",
        "Carly: Well, good. Then I'll give her the thumbs-up when she gets home today. She'll be thrilled.",
        "Jack: And -- and I guess, uh, Parker, uh -- his plans are gonna be on hold until he figures out what's gonna happen with that -- that brace.",
        "Carly: You know, I think he'd probably want to stick around anyway to be near Liberty.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you're probably right. So, that, uh -- that settles that.",
        "Carly: I guess we didn't need the coffee.",
        "Jack: Listen, Carly, what I said to you in New York, I -- I shouldn't have said it.",
        "Carly: You mean you -- when you told me that you thought like you were being unfaithful to me while you were with Janet?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Well, I wish that you'd realized that a little earlier.",
        "Jack: I know. But I didn't -- I didn't want it to raise expectations.",
        "Carly: Well, how can it? You can't have it both ways, Jack? You made the choice to go back to Janet, try to work things out.",
        "Jack: Yes, I know that, but it was unfair of me. I'm sorry. It just slipped out.",
        "Carly: The truth often does.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: I'm gonna get that. Hello, Janet.",
        "Janet: Hi. I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.",
        "Carly: It's -- it's no problem. Is Liberty okay?",
        "Janet: Can I come in?",
        "Carly: Yeah, sure. Sorry.",
        "Janet: Great. Thank you. No, really. It's okay. Um, actually, I'm here because of Liberty. The doctors in New York said that we should build a support team around her, surround her with people who are positive and that will keep her motivated while she's going through the treatments.",
        "Carly: That sounds like a very smart idea.",
        "Janet: Do you need to get something out of the kitchen?",
        "Carly: No. I -- I thought I heard something. Anyway, I -- I'm sure that Parker will help in any way that he can.",
        "Janet: I know he will. I know that. I was also kind of hoping that you'd pitch in.",
        "Carly: Me?",
        "Janet: Yeah. Uh, you can say no. Uh, I would understand that after everything that we've been through and our situation.",
        "Carly: I'm surprised you're even asking.",
        "Janet: Well, this is about Liberty, not me, and she feels comfortable around you. And she really looks up to you, and you have fashion in common and --",
        "Carly: You don't have to sell me on it, Janet. I'm in.",
        "Janet: You are?",
        "Carly: Of course.",
        "Janet: Thank you. Okay.",
        "Carly: We all want to keep our kids safe. It matters to us more than anything.",
        "Janet: The last few nights, I've been sneaking into her room after she's already gone to bed, just to -- [Sighs] Just to watch her breathe, like I did when she was a baby. And last night, she woke up, and she caught me staring at her, and she could see the pain, the fear in my eyes. And I just ended up making her feel more scared. You know, I'm supposed to be making her feel strong and brave. But I -- I ended up making her more afraid that she's gonna die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: You seem upset.",
        "Emily: No, it's, uh -- it's odd. When I -- when I tripped over your bag when I -- when I walked in here -- seeing it --",
        "Mick: Go on.",
        "Emily: It triggered something.",
        "Mick: What?",
        "Emily: I don't know, some kind of memory or --",
        "Mick: Of what?",
        "Emily: I am not sure. That -- that's the thing. I can't remember. The -- the memory's gone.",
        "Mick: But it troubled you.",
        "Emily: Does that make sense?",
        "Mick: Well, it could be of no real consequence. Your body's getting back into the swing of things from the coma. I would imagine that a lot of odd sensations will come with that.",
        "Emily: Yeah. [Stammers] I can't shake the sense that the memory had something to do with what happened to me right before I passed out.",
        "Mick: Well, it could be that your mind is trying to make sense of it by, uh, going through random memories. I'm no psychologist, but that seems to be the most logical explanation, don't you think?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I -- I suppose. I don't know.",
        "Mick: Listen to me. Are you listening, Emily? Sometimes it's best not to remember. Some memories are too painful.",
        "Emily: Some memories are too painful.",
        "Mick: You need to focus on the future, on having a baby with Paul. Your body and your mind are ready. Time to get the ball rolling, okay?",
        "Emily: You're right. It's time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I wish you would stop being so negative about Mick. He's trying to help you and Emily.",
        "Paul: I'm just curious, Mother, why all of the sudden it seems like you are this guy's biggest fan.",
        "Barbara: Because he's a good person and because -- because he's trying to help you. And you need to give him another chance.",
        "Paul: Explain to me why I should do that?",
        "Barbara: Okay, then, Paul, trust me on this, all right? Because pretty soon, you're gonna see that he really has our best interests at heart.",
        "Paul: See, I don't even know what that means. Do you know something about this guy that I don't know that you need to clue me in on?",
        "Barbara: Okay, stop it right now. Stop turning my innocent comments into something darker.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe all of your comments aren't so innocent.",
        "Barbara: That proves my point.",
        "Paul: No, something odd is going on with the two of you, and it's been going on since he's been sticking you with his needle.",
        "Barbara: I beg your pardon.",
        "Paul: There is something very strange happening here, and I want to know what it is!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: [Groans] You know, I could always, uh, blow off this meeting with my dad and stay.",
        "Alison: You are terrible!",
        "Casey: Aah!",
        "Alison: And hell-bent on breaking the agreement we made to wait.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but -- what do you expect? I'm a guy. You're hot.",
        "Alison: Well, listen, guy. You're gonna have to get out of here and let me try to get some sleep, or else I'll lose my hotness.",
        "Casey: Oh, that is impossible. Bye. Sweet dreams.",
        "[Alison sighs] [Alison chants] 89, 88, 87, 86 -- 85 --",
        "[Alison dreaming]",
        "Alison: Why are we here?",
        "Mick: Come inside and find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I keep breaking down in front of you. I'm sorry. This is embarrassing.",
        "Carly: It shouldn't be. It's completely understandable.",
        "Janet: Well, there's no time for that. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I have too much to do for Liberty.",
        "Carly: What if I -- I got her involved in some kind of design project? It might take your mind off of being sick, and she really is very talented.",
        "Janet: Do you really think so?",
        "Carly: Absolutely.",
        "Janet: Well, then, I think that would be great.",
        "Carly: Good. I'll get to work on that right away.",
        "[Janet sighs]",
        "Janet: Thanks. Thanks for putting up with me.",
        "Carly: Janet, I think you've been nothing but incredibly brave and strong.",
        "Janet: I don't feel like I've been much of either.",
        "Carly: Trust me. You are.",
        "Janet: Thanks.",
        "Carly: I'm glad you stopped by.",
        "Janet: Me too.",
        "Carly: Would you mind telling me what the hell you were doing in there all this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Mick, are you here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You guys have done so much already, and I want to thank you for that. You know, you've both really made Ali feel like she's part of the family.",
        "Tom: Well, I wish you two all the happiness in the world.",
        "Casey: Yes.",
        "Tom: It's about time you got some.",
        "Casey: Tell me about it.",
        "Tom: I want you to know I'm very proud of you.",
        "Casey: Yeah? Even with my, uh, decision to become a lawyer like you?",
        "Tom: If that's what you want.",
        "Casey: It is. I -- I've been looking into all the prelaw courses I have to take.",
        "Tom: Really? Intimidating much?",
        "Casey: Uh, you know, I'm up for a challenge.",
        "Tom: Good, good, as long as you know what you're in for.",
        "Casey: Yeah. A bunch of all-nighters.",
        "Tom: I'm not talking about the classes, Case.",
        "Casey: What do you mean?",
        "Tom: Um, this may be really hard for you, so you need to go into this with your eyes wide-open. Um, you may not be able to pull this off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I don't want to discuss this anymore. I just want to see my granddaughter.",
        "Paul: Okay, but this conversation's not over.",
        "[Barbara sighs]",
        "Emily: What conversation?",
        "Paul: Oh, good. You're both here.",
        "Barbara: Hi, Emily. How are you feeling?",
        "Emily: Fine. Better than fine. Like nothing ever happened.",
        "Barbara: That's wonderful. Hi, Mick.",
        "Mick: Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I'm gonna go, um, upstairs and see my granddaughter. Excuse me, would you?",
        "Paul: What's going on? Hello. I asked you a question.",
        "Emily: Everything's wonderful. Mm. Better than wonderful. I'm so happy you're home.",
        "Paul: Yeah, me too. I'm glad you're feeling better.",
        "Emily: I am. Much better. And I'm ready.",
        "Paul: You're ready? You're ready for what?",
        "Emily: To focus on our future on making our baby. It's time to get the ball rolling.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I was going to come out.",
        "Carly: But you couldn't find the doorway?",
        "Jack: Well, I hesitated, and then by that time, it was too late.",
        "Carly: Too late for what?",
        "Jack: Well, it would have looked strange, me waiting all that time, so I just -- I stayed in there.",
        "Carly: Did you feel like you had something to hide?",
        "Jack: No. But Janet, she tends to --",
        "Carly: Tends to what?",
        "Jack: Jump to conclusions. And I didn't want that. She's pretty mixed up right now, and I didn't want to add to it.",
        "Carly: It's not like we were doing anything wrong, Jack. We were just having a cup of coffee.",
        "Jack: Is that really all it was?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jack: And if we both know that --",
        "Carly: What are we gonna do?",
        "Jack: I can't keep pretending anymore, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack, maybe we should talk.",
        "Jack: We never stopped loving each other.",
        "Carly: So what are we gonna do? Are we gonna stay away from each other from now on, pretend that we don't know the other exists?",
        "Jack: I can't do that.",
        "Carly: I can't either. [Laughs]",
        "Jack: What? What's so funny?",
        "Carly: Oh! I made a pact with Molly yesterday. We decided that we were gonna give up on men and focus on work. Now you've come along, and you've made that impossible.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. It's not like any of this was planned.",
        "Carly: That's the problem, isn't it? Love never is. [Voice breaking] I -- I need to not love you so much. How am I supposed to do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Are you serious? You're thinking about having a baby right now?",
        "Emily: I never stopped wanting to have a baby with you.",
        "Paul: Really? You didn't stop when you were in a coma? That's what you were thinking about? \"Oh -- zzz -- baby.\"",
        "Emily: Don't do that. Don't -- don't act like that.",
        "Paul: What? Actually, I think for once, I'm the one who's being responsible.",
        "Emily: This is what we've wanted. This is what we've always wanted. It's -- it's the reason for Mick's treatments. It's what we've talked about and -- and been excited about for weeks. I don't understand why suddenly, you're so hesitant.",
        "Paul: Because you just got out of the hospital, and I don't think your body is ready to deal with having a baby.",
        "Emily: I am. I am absolutely ready.",
        "Paul: Why? Because he says so? Mick's not even a doctor.",
        "Mick: You're right. I'm not.",
        "Paul: So your opinion doesn't mean much, does it?",
        "Mick: Well, Paul, my treatments have been going very successfully with Emily.",
        "Paul: Yeah, until she wound up in the hospital. [Sighs] Do you mind? This is kind of a private conversation.",
        "Mick: Of course.",
        "Barbara: Well, Eliza is sound asleep, and I didn't want to wake her up, so --",
        "Paul: That's just as well. Emily and I have some things we need to discuss.",
        "Barbara: Everything all right?",
        "Paul: Everything's fine. I'd like for us to be left alone.",
        "Barbara: Oh. Well, Mick, I -- I think I am due for another treatment, if you have the time.",
        "Mick: Matter of fact, I do.",
        "Barbara: Good. I'll call you later.",
        "Paul: What is going on?",
        "Emily: Nothing.",
        "Paul: Nothing? Did I do something? Are you mad at me?",
        "Emily: No, I am ready to move forward with getting pregnant, and for some reason, you are suddenly against it.",
        "Paul: I never said I was against it.",
        "Emily: But you don't want to have a child with me anymore, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I -- I get shafted because of my prison record?",
        "Tom: No, no, I'm not telling you to give up on this dream.",
        "Casey: Okay. So what then, you know? I -- I just shouldn't expect so much for myself?",
        "Tom: No. The -- D.A., mayor, members of the city council -- they may all decide to weigh in on this thing.",
        "Casey: And -- and not in a good way? You know, so much for a great new start.",
        "Tom: You are making a great new start. Your mom and I are incredibly proud of you. You're staying out of trouble. Your grades are up. You're doing really well at your job. You're about to marry the woman that you love.",
        "Casey: And then what does it come to at the end of the day, Dad, huh? I'm still an ex-con. I guess I'm gonna have this thing hanging over me for the rest of my life.",
        "Tom: But it doesn't have to limit you.",
        "Casey: No, it just prevents me from finding a real career. What kind of husband is that gonna make me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: When are you going to tell Paul the truth?",
        "Mick: When I feel the time is right.",
        "Barbara: And when is that gonna be? He's already far too suspicious of you.",
        "Mick: No. He's suspicious of Mick Dante. But he's still allowing me to live at Fairwinds.",
        "Barbara: Did you ever think that's maybe because he wants to keep an eye on you?",
        "Mick: Well, I have no doubt about it. My son's no fool.",
        "Barbara: I'm glad you recognize that.",
        "Mick: Living at Fairwinds gives me an advantage.",
        "Barbara: Which is?",
        "Mick: I can keep my eye on him, as well. And when I feel like he's ready, I can tell him everything.",
        "Barbara: Somehow, I think there's more to this story than that.",
        "Mick: You know me too well, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: And I'm curious about something else, too.",
        "Mick: What's that?",
        "Barbara: How have you managed -- to have Emily not remember that you were with her when she slipped into a coma, in fact, that you caused it?",
        "Mick: It wasn't hard. I can be very persuasive.",
        "Barbara: That's not an answer.",
        "Mick: It's the only one you're gonna get. A magician never reveals his secrets.",
        "Barbara: Magic is only an illusion. I thought we were dealing with science.",
        "Mick: We are dealing with miracles.",
        "Barbara: And my miracles are not progressing as quickly as I would have liked.",
        "Mick: You are so impatient. Don't you feel younger?",
        "Barbara: Yes. I'd like the rest of me to follow suit.",
        "Mick: Well, I think you look radiant.",
        "Barbara: As radiant as Alison Stewart?",
        "Mick: [Exhales sharply] Are we back to this?",
        "Barbara: I would feel a lot more confident and less suspicious if you weren't chasing her around like a schoolboy behind the bleachers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Of course I want to have a child with you, Emily. But not at the expense of your health.",
        "Emily: It won't be. I'm fine. It's time to get the ball rolling.",
        "Paul: Okay, see, when you talk like that, when you say things like that, it's like -- it's like you're not even you.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? When you talk, you don't sound like you either. You sound like someone who doesn't love me.",
        "Paul: Of course I love you.",
        "Emily: Someone who doesn't want to have a child with me.",
        "Paul: That's why I want us to be careful. I don't want something to go wrong because we didn't take a little time to step back, 'cause we didn't take the time to have a full medical workup first.",
        "Emily: I don't need a full medical workup. They never would have released me from the hospital if I wasn't perfectly normal. I'm fine, and Mick agrees.",
        "Paul: Mick is not a doctor. He -- half the time, I don't even know what the guy is talking about!",
        "Emily: If you are turning your back on Mick, you are turning your back on us and our future.",
        "Paul: No, I am not. I'm trying to protect our future. You -- no. All I want to do is keep you safe. That's all I want. And that way, nothing will go wrong when you do get pregnant. Please, you need to trust me.",
        "Emily: Where are you going?",
        "Paul: I'll be back.",

        "Barbara: It's lovely. What's the occasion?",
        "Mick: Does there have to be a reason for me to give you a present?",
        "Barbara: A reason? No. A motive? Most definitely.",
        "Mick: Look inside at the inscription.",
        "Barbara: \"From J to B, with eternal love.\" Charming.",
        "Mick: And sincere.",
        "Barbara: It's -- it's beautiful.",
        "Mick: It's a token of my appreciation and undying affection.",
        "Barbara: Really?",
        "Mick: I want to thank you for believing in me, believing in second chances.",
        "Barbara: You're welcome. What's the catch?",
        "Mick: There's no catch. There are no strings attached whatsoever.",

        "Mick: I told her that she was ready to get pregnant.",
        "Paul: You did?",
        "Mick: There was no reason she couldn't.",
        "Paul: Based on what? On what information is that based on?",
        "Mick: My test results.",
        "Paul: I don't care about your stupid little test results.",
        "Barbara: Would you --",
        "Mick: I have been monitoring her blood work and her organ functions very close.",
        "Paul: My wife is not a lab rat.",
        "Barbara: Calm down, Paul.",
        "Paul: You understand something. You are in my house because my wife wants you there, but I don't like it! Now you back off, and I mean now, or you will be thrown out of my life and my house so fast, your head will spin. Do you understand me?",

        "Jack: I know it means a lot to her, having you in her corner.",
        "Carly: Whatever I can do.",
        "Jack: You're amazing. You know that?",
        "Carly: No. I'm just a mom. And when I think about one of our kids being in that situation, I'd be going crazy myself. I'd want all the help I could get.",
        "Jack: What about us?",
        "Carly: There can be no us. And I'll deal with that the best I can and because I have to. I will hide my feelings.",

        "Paul: Well, guess what? You failed.",
        "Mick: Well, she asked my opinion, and I told her what I thought -- that she is ready to get pregnant.",
        "Paul: You don't know anything about my wife.",
        "Mick: I understand that this is a decision that the two of you have to make together. I won't cross that line again. Excuse me.",
        "Barbara: What the hell was that all about? What are you doing?",
        "Paul: That was me defending my family! That's something you might want to try sometime!",
        "Barbara: You absolutely refuse to give that man any credence at all.",
        "Paul: Really? And how about you? You take every single word that he says as gospel.",
        "Barbara: I have faith in him. That's something that you might have a little bit of if you had helped --",
        "Paul: All I need is assurance that nothing else is gonna happen to Emily!",
        "Barbara: Mick is giving you that.",

        "Paul: Well, you're \"B,\" I guess. \"From J to B, with eternal love.\" Huh. Who the hell is \"J\"?",
        "Barbara: I don't know. Mick found it in an antique store.",
        "Paul: No, he didn't. That inscription -- that's new. Why would a guy named Mick put a \"J\"? Who is this guy, and why are you covering for him?",
        "Barbara: I can't tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I can't believe there aren't any other lawyers who have a criminal record.",
        "Casey: There probably are. I'm just saying it's gonna be a nightmare to get the bar to approve. I mean, letters of recommendation, proof of good conduct.",
        "Alison: Well, you have plenty of people who would vouch for you. I'll be the first. I'll write whatever you want.",
        "Casey: See? You're the best. I love you.",
        "Alison: I love you. And I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: Hey, I haven't given up yet. But if your heart was set on having a lawyer as a husband, you might want to rethink that.",
        "Alison: My heart is set on you -- only you -- and I want you to do whatever makes you happy. And if that's law, then -- then we'll do whatever you need. We'll get the letters that you need and -- and we'll convince the bar that -- that you're the best lawyer to come along since your father.",
        "Casey: We might have to shoot a little lower.",
        "Alison: I'm just saying that I'm backing you up in whatever you do.",

        "Emily: Oh, you -- you're back. I'm sorry.",
        "Mick: What's going on? Is it Paul? Talk to me.",
        "Emily: We had a fight. I tried to convince him that I'm ready to move forward with getting pregnant, but he wouldn't hear it. He doesn't want a child with me, and he doesn't trust you.",
        "Mick: I know. He came to see me and made that abundantly clear.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. Are you okay?",
        "Mick: Everything's fine, Emily.",
        "Emily: Everything's not fine. He doesn't want this. He won't let me move forward with the IVF process.",
        "Mick: Well it's not his body. It's yours. You can make this decision yourself.",
        "Emily: Well, obviously, I can't make a baby on my own, and Paul does play a pretty big part in it.",
        "Mick: Then, uh -- that's why if Paul's not willing to give you a baby right now, then I will.",

        "Janet: Are you okay? You look upset.",
        "Jack: No, I'm fine. How's Liberty?",
        "Janet: [Scoffs] I don't know. She barely said a word at breakfast, and she left to go to school early.",
        "Jack: At least she felt up to going. That's a good sign.",
        "Janet: I hope so. Uh -- I went to see Carly today.",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah?",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Jack: About what?",
        "Janet: Well, you know how the doctors said that we should put together a support team for her? I asked Carly to join it. I mean -- Liberty likes Carly, and they have a lot in common, you know, as far as the fashion thing goes. And I figured that if -- if Carly can give something to Liberty, something to do that will keep her positive and -- and staying upbeat, then I think that's a good thing.",
        "Jack: Hey, you're not gonna get an argument from me.",
        "Janet: So we'll take it day by day, see how it goes.",
        "Jack: I think you're handling this great.",
        "Janet: Really? 'Cause I don't think I am. The whole time I was there, I kept saying, \"I can't believe I'm here. I just want Carly to move a million miles away, never see her again.\"",
        "Jack: Yes, but you kept that to yourself for Liberty's sake.",
        "Janet: For Liberty's sake.",
        "Jack: So I repeat, I think you're handling this great.",
        "Janet: Just tell me I don't have to worry about anything else.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Janet: I mean as far as you and Carly is what I mean.",
