        "Gwen: Hey, thanks for letting your mom babysit Hallie. All right, I know it wasn't easy for you, but I think it's really important that they spend time together.",
        "Will: Well, if it's less stress for you then I'm all for it. But it's time for the babysitter to go home. 'Cause the sooner we get Mom out of here, the sooner we can enjoy ourselves.",
        "Gwen: That is if Hallie stays asleep for like three or four hours --",
        "Will: We can do a lot in three or four hours.",
        "Gwen: I know. Like sleep. I'm kidding. It's just a joke. That was a good one.",
        "Will: Mom, you left the door unlocked.",
        "Gwen: Oh, we probably just forgot to lock it. Wow, she really wore you out.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I just dozed off for a few minutes. Did you have fun?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, we did. Thank you for watching Hallie. How was she?",
        "Barbara: She was wonderful. She got a little fussy, and I got her up and I rocked her a little bit, like I used to rock you, and she went right back down and hasn't made a peep since.",
        "Gwen: Where's Hallie?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Elevator dings]",
        "Sofie: You know -- you know I am your mommy and I made such a big mistake giving you away, but I'm going to take you away from here and we're going to be together forever, okay? Okay, okay. Okay, come on. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know, you were lucky I was able to talk the clerk into giving me this key.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you were very convincing. You really think this thing's gonna work?",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, I hope so. It's not going to be easy to get Chris to admit that he poisoned his father and murdered dusty.",
        "Paul: Well, you just gotta get him to slip up, say something incriminating.",
        "Emily: Yeah, and then the charges against Holden are dropped, and you get to be Meg's hero, right?",
        "Paul: What if Chris points the finger at you?",
        "Emily: Will you stop speculating and plant the damn bug?",
        "[Elevator dings]",
        "Chris: Hey, thank you so much for the extra towels. I appreciate it.",
        "Emily: It's Chris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Emma always says, if you want to forget your troubles, keep busy. So, I've checked the homework, I've made the lunches, and I still can't stop thinking about what's going on with you.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, my mother also has a saying about getting a good night's rest and waking up with a clear head.",
        "Lily: I cannot sleep. I keep going over everything in my mind. There's got to be a way to clear your name.",
        "Holden: Lily, I know that it doesn't look good right now, but it will work itself out. You're safe and that is all that matters to me.",
        "Lily: You know, I need to make an official statement to the police. They need to know that I saw Emily leave the room where Dusty was killed that night.",
        "Holden: No. No, you're not making a statement. I am the prime suspect until further notice.",
        "Lily: Why won't you hire one of my mother's attorneys from Chicago? They can get the charges dropped.",
        "Holden: Lily, I didn't kill Dusty. I will beat the charges. I'm not going to jail.",
        "Lily: No, you still need an attorney. Just like Emily.",
        "Holden: If I cooperate with one of your mother's lawyers, they will want me to point the finger at you. And I will not do that. I will not put you in harm's way. Period.",

        "Luke: What?",
        "Noah: Yeah, I know you're worried about your dad.",
        "Luke: I know he didn't kill Dusty. There just has to be some sort of way to prove it.",
        "Noah: Your parents are working on it, right?",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I wish I could do something.",
        "Noah: Don't stress, okay? They need you to -- be you.",
        "Luke: Good ol' dependable Luke. Muck out the stables, take care of the kids.",
        "Noah: Hey, they're lucky to have you around. Hey, careful, that's a little hot.",
        "Luke: Oh, I am such a klutz.",
        "Noah: Hey, you really do need a break.",
        "Reg: Hey, Luke Snyder. Where have you been?",
        "Luke: Hey, Reg, sorry I didn't make it to the committee meeting. I've been crazy busy. Look, this is my boyfriend, Noah.",
        "Reg: Reg Addington.",
        "Noah: Nice to meet you.",
        "Reg: Now I see where you've been spending your time. Good going. Now, we still need you on the social committee though.",

        "Reg: For questioning.",
        "Luke: Oh, well some of us are through that phase.",
        "Reg: And that's a good thing. Are you guys free this weekend? Tony's parents have a house up on the lake and a bunch of guys from the alliance are going to be there. Should be a blast. There's an extra bedroom if you two are interested.",
        "Luke: Umm -- can we get back to you?",
        "Reg: Yeah, sure. Call my cell. It's gonna be a blast. It would be great if you could be there. Just let me know.",
        "Luke: So, do you think we should go?",
        "Noah: Could be just what you need, you know? Time to chill out, relax.",
        "Luke: A nice relaxing weekend at a lake house -- get to meet some other gay couples -- socialize.",
        "Noah: Sounds really great, doesn't it? Especially the part about sharing a bedroom.",

        "Chris: What we had is over. Now leave.",
        "Emily: Can't we -- can't we talk about this?",
        "Chris: You lied to me, you cheated on me. There is nothing left to talk about.",
        "Emily: Do you think we have something worth saving?",
        "Chris: No, you need to go, now.",
        "Emily: Do you remember how good we were together? I mean, I know -- I know you don't trust me, but can't you give me one more chance?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: When are you going to stop protecting me?",
        "Holden: I've been doing it most of my life. It's a hard habit to break.",
        "Lily: Yeah, it's hard to get used to you being on my side after everything we've been through.",
        "Holden: Well, things have changed. Our kids, they need you.",
        "Lily: I know. And when I think about the -- [Cell phone rings] I don't recognize the number.",

        "Neil: No, but I have the information he was waiting for -- before he was killed.",
        "Lily: Did you go to the police?",
        "Neil: I'm not talking to the cops. I'd like to keep my business under the radar.",
        "Lily: What kind of information do you have?",
        "Neil: I was analyzing some residue in a coffee mug. Donovan made it clear that he didn't want the results to fall into the wrong hands.",
        "Lily: Tell me what you know.",
        "Neil: Donovan requested that I contact you if anything happened to him, but I can't tell you over the phone. I need to do this in person.",
        "Lily: Can we meet tonight?",
        "Neil: Fine. There's a bar in Milltown called Yo's.",
        "Lily: I know it.",

        "Emily: I'm not lying to you now. I promise, I'm not. I'm lonely without you, Chris.",
        "Chris: You are pathetic. I can't believe I used to love you.",
        "Emily: I know. I should've told you the truth about what happened with Dusty. I should've. It was a mistake, okay? I made a mistake. And you have to understand one thing, I never cared about Dusty the way I care for you.",
        "Chris: So what you had with me was real and what you had with Dusty -- what was that exactly, huh?",
        "Emily: A one-night-stand.",

        "Barbara: I couldn't help it, Will. I couldn't!",
        "Gwen: Hallie?!",
        "Barbara: I put her in the crib. Where's the car seat? Where's the car seat?",
        "Will: Was it the crib or the car seat?! What do you think she did, she got up and strapped herself in?",
        "Barbara: I'm half asleep, Will. I know what happened.",
        "Barbara: Sofie showed up here, she wanted to see the baby. And when I refused, she got upset and then I made her leave.",

        "Barbara: The baby was fussy, Will.",
        "Gwen: Sofie took her.",
        "Barbara: Okay, and after she left, I called Bonnie McKechnie. And you should call Bonnie, maybe she knows something.",
        "Will: Why the hell did you call Bonnie?",
        "Barbara: I thought maybe she could talk to Sofie about the visitation agreement.",
        "Will: Mom, why wouldn't you call us after Sofie left?",
        "Barbara: I handled it, Will!",
        "Will: No, you didn't!",
        "Gwen: Okay, stop it, all right. If Sofie took Hallie, we know she's not going to hurt the baby, all right. I'll just call Sofie, have her bring Hallie back.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",

        "Will: You don't know that, Mom.",
        "Gwen: She's just -- she's really upset because we've been shutting her out, that's all.",
        "Will: That doesn't give her the right to take our child. The reason we're shutting her out is because she doesn't respect boundaries.",
        "Barbara: Let me help. I can fix this.",
        "Will: No, Mom, you can't. You're not going to help.",
        "Gwen: Okay, just stop. We just need to go to the Lakeview and find Sofie.",

        "Luke: You hate sleeping on my grandma's couch, don't you?",
        "Noah: Emma's been really good to me. Your family's great. I love living on the farm, but -- you know, it does cut down our alone time.",
        "Luke: Well, there's going to be other people at the this party this weekend.",
        "Noah: You know what I mean. What?",
        "Luke: I don't -- I don't know. I don't know. It's weird. I -- you know how much I want to be with you.",
        "Noah: Me too.",
        "Luke: And all the time I was in the wheelchair and I didn't have -- the use of all my moving parts, and now I'm better. And things are just so messed up with my parents.",
        "Noah: Hey, if you don't want to go right now because you're worried about your dad, I completely get that. Okay, we can do this some other time. I want this to feel right.",
        "Luke: This isn't about my feelings for you. I love you. And I really, really want to be together.",
        "Noah: I think about it all the time. I mean, sneaking kisses on the porch and holding hands walking around the pond is great, but -- you can't blame a guy for wanting more.",
        "Luke: I want it too. So bad. But there's just so much going on with my father right now.",
        "Noah: I know. You're right, um, your family has to come first. Um, it's cool.",

        "Lily: Okay. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Dusty never made me feel the way you do. Oh, he betrayed me and I hated him for it. I don't care that he's dead. Really, I don't care that he's gone. It's better for the both of us.",
        "Chris: You talk too much.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I was afraid to tell you the truth about him. I was afraid if I told you the truth that you would leave me. But he said things about you. He said things about you that made me doubt you. I don't know, things that couldn't possibly be true.",
        "Chris: Yes --",
        "Emily: But it doesn't matter if they're true. You know, the things that you said -- it doesn't matter now -- because Dusty's gone.",
        "Chris: Dusty's not our problem anymore.",
        "Emily: No. It's just you and me.",

        "Emily: What are you talking about?",
        "Chris: No, you didn't come here to tell me you love me. You came here to find something on me.",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Chris: So where's the damn bug?",
        "Emily: No -- would you stop it? Would you look at me? Do you really think I would do that to you?",

        "Will: She took the baby.",
        "Aaron: What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: She came by the house when Will and I weren't there. She wanted to see Hallie, but Barbara wouldn't let her.",
        "Will: So she came back, she broke in and we think she ran off with Hallie.",
        "Gwen: We're just really hoping that she's upstairs in her room.",
        "Aaron: Well, did you call her?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I just left her a message. Listen, we gotta go up.",

        "Sofie: You shouldn't. I can take care of myself.",
        "Aaron: Hey, listen, Sofie I have to ask you a question. Did you take Hallie?",
        "Sofie: You mean my baby? I have every right to be with her.",
        "Aaron: Where are you?",
        "Sofie: I can't tell you.",

        "Emily: What are you talking about? What are you doing? Stop!",

        "Noah: But I thought you didn't want to go.",
        "Luke: I changed my mind.",
        "Noah: Why?",
        "Luke: I don't know. It might be fun. You know, meet some other gay couples, make some new friends. Be alone together.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but -- you know, if you want to wait --",
        "Luke: Why would I?",
        "Noah: Well, 'cause it's going to be a party. You know, in a house full of guys. It might not be the most romantic.",
        "Luke: Anytime I'm alone with you is romantic to me.",
        "Noah: Me too. This is really going to be great. Umm -- I mean, I'm looking forward to it.",

        "Lily: I told you to come alone.",
        "Lily: We blew it. This could have been the information that exonerated you.",
        "Holden: We don't know that. It could've been nothing.",
        "Lily: It was all we had to go on. [Cell phone rings] Hello?",

        "Emily: Bob's coffee mug -- in the research lab. Dusty had it sent out for analysis. He was killed waiting for the test results.",

        "Margo: Yes, of course I did. But he hasn't returned my phone calls yet. You know, Emily, this is a lot of very valuable information that could've been useful at the beginning of the investigation. It just begs the question, why you're coming forward with it now. What's in it for you?",

        "Evan: Okay, well, as outrageous as Emily's allegations are, it could be a problem. I mean, if she starts spreading rumors, its bad news for memo 21. She publishes a newspaper, she could easily sway public opinion. And the last thing we need right now is bad PR that could derail our project.",
        "Chris: Well, I agree, but how do we stop her?",

        "Emily: I'm telling you the truth. I couldn't say anything earlier because of Chris. We umm -- we sort of had a deal. I agreed to keep Dusty's suspicions quiet about him, if he agreed to keep quiet about me.",

I know there's no excuse for what I did, I'm just -- I'm telling you this because I need you to understand that what I did at the time, I felt like I had nothing left to lose.",

        "Gwen: I don't know, I feel like it's my fault. I kept pushing her to see Hallie. I just, I remember what it felt like not being able to be with my baby. I didn't want her to feel that same pain. And I just drove her to do this.",
        "Will: Gwen, you had no way of predicting how Sofie was going to react.",
