        "Brad and Katie are frustrated by the intrusion into the lives as they try to make a baby even though they signed up for this. Brad and Katie give the cameramen the slip and head to see Henry and Vienna. Henry and Vienna help hide Brad and Katie, as Henry bemoans the fact that they are trying to have a baby. Vienna and Henry dress up as Brad and Katie, go back to their home, and fool the cameramen filming them from afar. Vienna and Henry have a big disagreement when she tells him that she wants children and Henry tells her that he doesn't. Brad and Katie enjoy some alone time as they \u0091practice' to try having a baby. Meg worries continually about her missing daughter as those around her assure her that Paul would never hurt Eliza. Holden and Dusty argue about his role in Eliza going missing, as Meg goes home with Holden to keep the peace. Lily visits Dusty, as he struggles with guilt thinking he brought this on for Meg because he pushed Paul too far. Lily defends what he was trying to do and explains it later to Holden. Jack still has no leads on Eliza or Paul. Paul and Josie continue to hold up at the TV studio. Paul takes Josie's cell phone battery, as they argue about how he needs to turn himself in. Paul pleads with her to give him a week with his daughter and then he will do that; he just wants to bond with her. Josie is affected by the way he is with Eliza. However, when Josie sees a phone and Paul leaves the room, she makes a quick call to Dusty to tell him that Eliza is safe and Meg will get her back, but she has to have patience. Paul walks back in the room and she realizes he was testing her; she tells him that she just wanted Meg to know her baby was ok and that she didn't tell Dusty where they were. He has to now hold up his end of the deal \u0096 one week. Dusty rushes to Meg to tell her what Josie told him. Meg is cautiously optimistic, but can't help but be thrilled to know her baby is actually safe and could be coming home soon."

        "Katie: You up?",
        "Brad: I am now.",
        "Katie: What do you have today?",
        "Brad: The only thing I have on my calendar is to kiss every inch of this beautiful, sexy creature I found in my bed.",
        "Katie: I can make time for that.",
        "Brad: Yeah?",
        "Mac: Guys?",
        "[Katie gasps]",
        "Katie: We should get started. We need to set up.",
        "Brad: Will you get the hell out of here?!",
        "Mac: But the footage --",
        "Brad: Now! Come on! This has got to stop.",
        "Katie: Brad --",
        "Brad: No, I'm serious. This has got to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: So I told Pepper he's not allowed to eat from your plate.",
        "Henry: He shouldn't be allowed to eat from anyone's plate, Sweetheart.",
        "Vienna: And I said to him, if it happens again, he's not allowed to come down with us for breakfast.",
        "Henry: Honey, he's a dog. I don't think he comprehends cause and effect.",
        "Vienna: He's bright, and he's had extensive training.",
        "Henry: He's had expensive training. I don't know about extensive, judging by how little he knows.",
        "Vienna: What's wrong?",
        "Henry: I'm not hungry.",
        "Vienna: Well, you said you were starving.",
        "Henry: Yeah, that was before the mutt stole my muffin.",
        "Vienna: Oh, don't be mean. That was a very hard training program. I promise -- I promise that he will get it the second time.",
        "Henry: What are you saying, he failed?",
        "Vienna: Yes, they said that they're sure that he'll pass the next time around.",
        "Henry: I'm sure they did. They know a soft touch when they see one.",
        "Vienna: He's a sweet little dog, isn't it?",
        "Henry: I was talking about you, Sweetie!",
        "Vienna: I just think that if you were a little bit more affectionate to him, he would be more obedient.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and we can just throw decades of behavioral science right out the window.",
        "Vienna: I don't care what the experts say. I know my Pepper.",
        "Henry: Well, all I can say is, it is a good thing that we don't want kids because I think they'd be in therapy for the rest of their lives.",
        "Vienna: I think they would be wonderful and gorgeous. But then again, we won't find out, will we?",
        "Henry: No. No, we won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Eliza?! Eliza, where are you, Baby? Where is she?",
        "Dusty: It's okay. She's not here. It was a dream. It was just a dream. It's okay. We're going to find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Maybe they already left the state. Amber Alerts don't always work. I hope you're right. All right, thanks, Jack.",
        "Lily: Nothing?",
        "Holden: Nothing yet.",
        "Lily: What does he think?",
        "Holden: He's not making any predictions.",
        "Lily: Have you spoken to Meg?",
        "Holden: No, I sent her an e-mail. I left her a voice message -- nothing. You know what? I'm going to try her again.",
        "Lily: Well, I'm sure she's okay. She's with Dusty.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry, but that logic escapes me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: She just sounded so close.",
        "Dusty: You need sleep.",
        "Meg: I'm trying. But I keep having these dreams that she's right here, and then I wake up, and it hits me all over again. How could Paul take a tiny baby away from her mother? How could he do that to her?",
        "Dusty: We're going to find them.",
        "Meg: When?",
        "Dusty: Soon. Try to sleep.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: It's him!",
        "Dusty: Hello?",
        "Holden: Where's Meg?",
        "Dusty: Right here. It's your brother.",
        "Holden: Where are you?",
        "Dusty: At my place. She's trying to rest.",
        "Holden: She can rest at home.",
        "Dusty: She's comfortable here.",
        "Holden: Tell her I'm coming to get her.",
        "Dusty: You don't need to do that. She's okay.",
        "Holden: I'm on my way.",
        "Dusty: I'll tell her.",
        "Holden: And by the way, if I were Paul, and you answered the phone, I'd probably hang up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You looking for this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Can you tell me why my sister would go within 100 miles of this guy after everything that he's done?",
        "Lily: You think this is Dusty's fault?",
        "Holden: You don't?",
        "Lily: He didn't kidnap Eliza. Paul did.",
        "Holden: Don't you think Dusty knew that Paul would freak out when he found out that Meg was married to him?",
        "Lily: Your sister could have said \"No.\"",
        "Holden: And she should have. But now is not the time for me to tell her off.",
        "Lily: And now is not the time for her to see you tell Dusty off, either.",
        "Holden: I'll do my best.",
        "Lily: Let's remember that the main goal is not to punish Dusty. It's to get that poor baby back, away from Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I thought you might be tempted to turn me in. Turns out I was right.",
        "Josie: That's not what I was doing.",
        "Paul: It's what I would do.",
        "Josie: Well, I'm not you. I wouldn't abuse my child.",
        "Paul: I'm not abusing my child!",
        "Josie: You stole her from her mother! You made me drive for hours without a decent car seat. And now you have us all living in a dressing room.",
        "Paul: And it's nice here. Look, this --",
        "Josie: Oh, please. Have you even thought about Meg? About what she must be going through?",
        "Paul: Meg brought this on herself the day she married Dusty.",
        "Josie: Even you don't believe that.",
        "Paul: You know what? If you're so worried about Meg, why didn't you turn me in when you had the chance? You could have done that last night. There were plenty of people all over the place.",
        "Josie: Yeah, I was hoping that you would do it.",
        "Paul: Why would I do that?",
        "Josie: Paul, like I said, if you bring her in voluntarily, maybe there's a chance you won't have to go to jail.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well that's a chance I'm just not willing to take.",
        "Josie: Okay, I am done trying to protect you. I don't even know why I expected better from you.",
        "Paul: You really shouldn't have.",
        "Josie: Yeah, you're right. I'm not going to be a part of this for one more second.",
        "Paul: What exactly makes you think that you have a choice?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: As long as you knock next time, then we're cool. All right, they get it.",
        "Katie: Do they?",
        "Brad: You know, they're just -- they're just doing their jobs. You know, they have orders to capture the moment of conception.",
        "Katie: The moment?",
        "Brad: Well, as soon afterwards as possible.",
        "Katie: I don't know if I can do this.",
        "Brad: We can back out of this anytime we want.",
        "Katie: But it's the only way Kim will put you back on the air.",
        "Brad: You know, I'm not sure that it's worth it. Starting a family, it's sacred. You know, I'm not sure that we would be selling it out.",
        "Katie: That's beautiful. I don't think I can get pregnant like this.",
        "Brad: You mean by talking? No, I don't think so.",
        "Katie: My reproductive cells need privacy. They're very shy.",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, mine aren't really enjoying the attention too much, either. I think -- I think they're planning a jailbreak as we speak. That's it.",
        "Katie: What's it?",
        "Brad: I think I have come up with a plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: That wasn't necessary.",
        "Vienna: I don't want you to blame Pepper for starving to death.",
        "Henry: And I don't want you to think I'm a hard-hearted pet owner. I just -- the vet told us that he should not eat table food.",
        "Vienna: Have you ever looked at that canned dog food? It's not fit for human consumption!",
        "Henry: It's not supposed to be for human consumption.",
        "Vienna: Well, Pepper has very refined tastes.",
        "Henry: Sweetie, he's a dog. You can't indulge him the way I indulge you.",
        "Vienna: Oh, that's sweet.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and just -- just promise me, okay? No more table food.",
        "Vienna: Okay. Can he sleep in your sweater drawer?",
        "Henry: Fine.",
        "Vienna: Okay, no more table food. Promise.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Henry: Hello? Speaking. Yeah, yeah. Hold on for just a second. It's Metro's linen service.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. It's our day off.",
        "Henry: I know, I know, I know. It'll just take a second. I'll take it outside. Yeah. Uh-huh.",
        "Vienna: Oh. Don't you worry, Pepper. Mommy won't let you starve to death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay, so we just have to make sure that Liberty is gonna -- is off to school, okay, and then we'll get back to the bedroom.",
        "Katie: Anyone want coffee?",
        "Joe: We're good. We'll just set up inside.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Brad: Okay. We'll be right in.",
        "Katie: You are a genius.",
        "Brad: You inspire me.",
        "Katie: Was it something I said?",
        "Brad: No, it's just the way you look with all your clothes off.",
        "Katie: Well, whatever it was, it was brilliant.",
        "Brad: Well, I got another idea, about how you can thank me for the first one.",
        "Katie: Well let's get out of here before they realize we're gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Listen. There's no need to argue. She wants to be here. I'm trying to make things comfortable for her.",
        "Meg: Holden, hey. I miss her so much.",
        "Holden: It's going to be okay. Jack, he's got the entire P.D. on it. The FBI is getting in on it. Let me take you home.",
        "Meg: No, I'm okay here.",
        "Holden: Right, but I think you should come with me.",
        "Dusty: She doesn't need you telling her what to do.",
        "Holden: Oh, because you got everything covered?",
        "Meg: Holden.",
        "Holden: I'm not the one who convinced her to do something to turn her crazy husband even crazier.",
        "Meg: Dusty needed help to save Johnny from Craig.",
        "Holden: Yeah, and it's amazing how everyone ends up worse than they were before he decided to save them.",
        "Dusty: Is that true? I don't know if that's true, actually.",
        "Holden: Johnny's with Craig instead of Lucy. Eliza is with Paul instead of Meg. Great job.",
        "Meg: Okay, stop it! My baby is gone, and all you two can do is fight with each other? I'm going with Holden, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: You can stay here if you want to.",
        "Meg: I know. Thank you for everything. I mean that. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: How exactly are you planning on keeping me here? Holding another baby bottle to my head?",
        "Paul: Well, that worked the first time.",
        "Josie: Well, maybe they've got some fake guns around here.",
        "Paul: I'm pretty sure I can get my hands on a real gun.",
        "Josie: Okay, so you shoot me. What is your plan then?",
        "Paul: I don't know. After shooting you, I don't really have a plan.",
        "Josie: I find that a little hard to believe.",
        "Paul: Things happened really quickly.",
        "Josie: Well, you should've figured them out before you took her.",
        "Paul: I just wanted to spend a little bit of time with my baby girl without that bastard hanging over. Is that -- is that really too much to ask?",
        "Josie: These are questions for Meg.",
        "Paul: Meg married Dusty! And then she didn't even tell me about it! You know what that's like? I get the worst news of my life from him?",
        "Josie: This isn't about you and him! This is about your daughter!",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I don't get to see my daughter if I go to jail. So if you're thinking about trying to make that happen, you better be ready to go to jail right alongside me.",
        "Josie: There is no need to threaten me.",
        "Paul: I'm not threatening you. I'm just spelling it out for you. If you go to the cops, if you sell me out, I'm just going to tell them that it was all your idea.",
        "Josie: If that's your way of repaying someone who was just trying to help you, then you have even more problems than I thought.",
        "Paul: You're the one that's going to have problems when you're in jail.",
        "Josie: And what are you going to do? Take Eliza on the run?",
        "Paul: If I have to.",
        "Josie: What you have to do is bring her back.",
        "Paul: I can't.",
        "Josie: Yes, you can, Paul. You just take out your phone and call Meg. And then call the police.",
        "Paul: No. That's not going to happen.",
        "Josie: Okay, then I am out of here. I will give you one hour to call the police, and then I am going there myself.",
        "Paul: No, wait --",
        "Josie: What are you going to do, beat me and force me to stay?",
        "Paul: I don't know, I'm thinking about it.",
        "Josie: Then go ahead, or get the hell out of my way!",
        "Paul: Okay, you know what? Stop. Hold on a second. This little spitting contest, it's not getting either one of us anywhere.",
        "Josie: You're right.",
        "Paul: So let's just back up for a second and try and to talk to one --",
        "[Eliza crying]",
        "Paul: Great, you woke her up. Come here, baby girl. Aww, shh. It's okay. I know, she's making a lot of noise. Trying to get her to shut up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: We did it. We lost them!",
        "Brad: Yes! Hey, guys!",
        "Henry: Hey, you! What happened? It looked like you just robbed a bank.",
        "Brad: Well, better yet, we stole our lives back. You know, and now we need to get a room.",
        "Vienna: Okay. What's wrong with your house?",
        "Brad: We're being stalked.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God. That's horrible. Have you spoken to the police?",
        "Katie: No, it's of our own doing. Well, mine, actually.",
        "Brad: Well, I cannot let her take the blame -- all the blame. You know, I agreed to it too.",
        "Henry: Agreed to what?",
        "Katie: Oh, to having a video crew shoot us trying to have a baby.",
        "Brad: It was the only way Kim would give me my job back.",
        "Katie: But it's turned into a nightmare. They're everywhere. They're in our house, they're in our bedroom -- everywhere.",
        "Henry: Look, wait, wait -- get back to the point about having a baby.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. We're trying.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God! That's wonderful!",
        "Katie: Thank you!",
        "Henry: Or not.",
        "Vienna: Henry!",
        "Henry: No, with all due respect to the fact that we were all children once, do you guys have any idea what you're getting yourselves into?",
        "Katie: Of course.",
        "Brad: I have a kid, remember?",
        "Henry: Liberty is not exactly a kid.",
        "Brad: Yeah, don't remind me.",
        "Henry: I'm just talking about all the things you missed. Like the sticky fingers, and the food in the hair, and the little sneakers with wheels in them that leave tracks everywhere.",
        "Vienna: Henry, they know what children are like.",
        "Brad: I'm going to go get us a room right now so we can keep trying to make love.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God. Are you serious about this?",
        "Katie: Yes. We wanted a child for so long. We just figured this was the best time.",
        "Henry: Why? Because you're enjoying your life too much?",
        "Vienna: Will you stop! This is wonderful news. You're turning into a miserable old grouch in your old age.",
        "Henry: Are you calling me old?",
        "Vienna: Yes!",
        "Katie: And she meant it in a good way.",
        "Henry: There is no good way! Fine, have fun at my expense. But don't say I didn't warn you.",
        "Brad: There's not an empty room in the place.",
        "Katie: What? Are you serious?",
        "Brad: Yeah, they've got some sort of convention. We're going to have to find some other place to go.",
        "Katie: Too late. We're busted!",
        "Vienna: What, what?",
        "Brad: That's the crew that's been haunting our dreams.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not too late. Come with us.",
        "Henry: This will not end well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You had no right to lay into Dusty like that. He was only trying to help.",
        "Holden: The more he helps, the worse things get.",
        "Meg: Oh, that's not fair. I know you two have history.",
        "Holden: No, that's not what this is about.",
        "Meg: It sure sounded that way.",
        "Holden: I know what he does. He gets you to think that he's looking out for you, and then when something awful happens, he's never the one who gets hurt.",
        "Meg: That's not true.",
        "Holden: He got Lily blamed for his death, and he wasn't even dead! And now he's charmed you into marrying him.",
        "Meg: I'm not married!",
        "Holden: Lucky for you.",
        "Meg: And no one had to charm me into anything. It was my decision. I wanted to help him keep Johnny.",
        "Holden: And look what it's done to you!",
        "Meg: Paul did that to me!",
        "Holden: Because you got involved with Dusty.",
        "Meg: That's not Dusty's fault.",
        "Holden: Oh, he's never -- he's never at fault for anything, is he?",
        "Meg: He's was trying to help me through this.",
        "Holden: All right, you know what? Can we just stop? Can we just take Dusty out of the picture here for a minute, and just focus on getting your daughter back?",
        "Meg: That is what I'm focused on!",
        "Holden: Well then, why don't you let your family help you out? We don't have any agendas here. All we want is to get you through this and get your daughter back. So why don't you let us do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Dusty: Your husband's not here. He picked up his sister and left.",
        "Lily: Did he give you a hard time?",
        "Dusty: I deserve it.",
        "Lily: Dusty, this isn't your fault.",
        "Dusty: I dragged his sister into this mess.",
        "Lily: You were trying to hold onto Johnny.",
        "Dusty: That's my problem.",
        "Lily: She must have wanted to help you, or she wouldn't have done it.",
        "Dusty: I should've known how Paul would react. I'm the reason he did this.",
        "Lily: He did this because he's completely unstable.",
        "Dusty: I married the woman he just had a child with. I made a bad situation worse.",
        "Lily: If you hadn't, somebody else would have. We've all known it was just a matter of time with Paul. From the moment Meg got pregnant, we couldn't stop it, and neither could you.",
        "Dusty: Your husband doesn't seem to agree.",
        "Lily: My husband is wrong.",

        "Paul: Sorry.",
        "Josie: Paul!",
        "Paul: I didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Josie: Will you please just let me go?",
        "Paul: I thought we should talk.",
        "Josie: Talk? Talk about what? You can't keep running forever.",
