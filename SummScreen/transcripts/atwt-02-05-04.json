        "Paul: Relax. Come on, take it easy. I'm not gonna betray you.",
        "Molly: It's just that I promised Craig that wouldn't say a word to anybody about Annabelle Fettle or Cabot's adoption. If he finds out that I told you --",
        "Paul: He's not going to find out. I'm very good at keeping secrets.",
        "Molly: Okay -- it's been a really long time since I trusted anybody.",
        "Paul: Well, thank you then. We're on the same side now. And you can count on me to protect you, no matter how bad it gets.",
        "Molly: Protect me? Protect me from what? Paul, what are you going to do?",
        "Paul: What am I going to do?",
        "Molly: Yeah.",
        "Paul: I'm gonna go home. I gotta make a couple of phone calls.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Do you think he knows how much we love him?",
        "Craig: He knows everything.",
        "Rosanna: Sometimes this just all feels too good to be true.",
        "Craig: When it's like this, just us -- it gets better and better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Annabelle: Think I could get a smoke? Never mind. I should probably cut down. First thing I want you to know is that I've always had a deep respect for the Mounties. Except for those hats. And the pants. Anyway, like I said, I'm making a full confession. All the details about the babies and the phony adoptions. But you gotta do something for me, too. You gotta give me the name of that back-stabber who turned me in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You're no more psychic than I am. You have been pretending to get in touch with my wife's dead sister. When all along, all you really wanted was to get in touch with my wife's bank account.",
        "Lois: Your husband obviously has a problem with me. I suggest you work it out between you.",
        "Holden: You're not going anywhere.",
        "Lily: Holden --",
        "Lois: Is this really necessary?",
        "Holden: Not until you tell my wife that you've been conning her from the very beginning.",
        "Lois: I'm not going to tolerate this any longer.",
        "Jack: You can tell Mrs. Snyder the truth here. Or you can tell me down at the Oakdale Police Station.",
        "Lois: I never meant to hurt anyone. I'm so sorry. Oh, Lily, you have to believe me.",
        "Holden: Lily. Lily, wait.",
        "Lily: Why? So you can tell me what a fool I've been?",
        "Holden: No, I would never do that. Hey, come on. I'm still on your side here. And I always will be.",
        "Lily: I wanted her to be right. I wanted to believe that Rose was still with me.",
        "Holden: She is. But you don't need some phony psychic to tell you that. All you need are your memories, your love --",
        "Lily: It's not enough. You took something away from me today. And I've already lost so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Mike! Oh, my God! How did you know to find us?",
        "Mike: It doesn't matter. Where's Simon?",
        "Katie: He went to go get us new passports to get us out of the country.",
        "Mike: He's got some guy setting up a meeting?",
        "Katie: Ah, well, yeah -- well, something went wrong, and so he's trying another way. I don't even know where he is. All I know is that if he doesn't get what we need, we are going to be stuck in Oakdale with all these people running after us trying to kill us.",
        "Mike: Okay, I'll tell you what, well, while you're waiting, there's something you need to know. Remember that guy who shot at us at the church? Simon paid him to do it.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Mike: You know? That he tried to scare you, to make sure you'd leave with him?",
        "Katie: Yes, Simon told me all about it. But there's more to the story.",
        "Mike: Oh, there always is. How many times does that guy have to lie to you before you can figure this whole thing out?",
        "Katie: Simon didn't want to lie to me, Mike. He was running out of time and he was scared that I was going to get killed.",
        "Mike: Stop, let's start a whole new life. This is ridiculous.",
        "Katie: Mike, I cannot leave. Not now.",
        "Mike: Why not?",
        "Katie: He showed up a little while ago bleeding to death because Simon's enemies were after him. They shot him, Mike. So Simon wasn't lying. See, there are people after him.",
        "Mike: All right, you know, I'm getting you out of here right now. Let's go.",
        "Katie: Mike, stop it. I'm not going to walk out on Simon.",
        "Mike: You know what? He walked out on you.",
        "Katie: He had good reason.",
        "Mike: So do you.",
        "Katie: He needs me, Mike!",
        "Mike: For what?",
        "Katie: You're not going to want to hear it. Simon just -- he needs someone to give him strength. To stay alive.",
        "Mike: You know what, he can find that from someone else. I'm not letting you do this.",
        "Simon: I'd say that's up to Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, I did not mean to upset you. But I was afraid that if I didn't shake you up a little bit, you would never see the truth about this woman.",
        "Lily: Why didn't you just come to me personally to tell me what you know about Lois? Remember that, Holden? A little one-on-one conversation?",
        "Holden: I tried. I tried everything. But nothing seemed to work. And the more I tried, the higher you built this wall between us.",
        "Lily: Because you refuse to see what's happening to me. Ever since Rose died, I feel this pain inside of me, and it won't go away. It's from morning till night. Nothing will make it stop! Nothing will make it go away!",
        "Holden: Lily, I know that you're suffering. And I'm sorry if I embarrassed you, but I ran out of ideas. I didn't know what else to do.",
        "Lily: You're not the only one running out of ideas, Holden. I feel like I did when Rose and I were trapped in that well. And I would look up and I would see nothing but darkness. But Rose isn't here anymore to make me feel better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Molly: I'm so glad you came back by, you know, its dead here right now. So it's a great time for us to have a long chat.",
        "Carly: That's what I was hoping.",
        "Molly: How is Sage? I'm sorry I haven't seen her for so long. Maybe I can take her to the park this weekend.",
        "Carly: That's a great idea.",
        "Molly: That's not what you want to talk about, is it?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Molly: Surprise, surprise, Carly has an agenda.",
        "Carly: It's about Rosanna.",
        "Molly: Of course it is. What other reason would you possibly have for dropping by to see me?",
        "Carly: I really don't want this to turn into an argument.",
        "Molly: Go on. What is it?",
        "Carly: Craig told me that you have some information about Cabot's adoption.",
        "Molly: What does that have to do with you?",
        "Carly: I don't want that information to get out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, look at him. He is so intuitive.",
        "Craig: Rip that up. I'm going to call Harvard right now. I think you're ready.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, stop.",
        "Craig: Veritas, baby.",
        "Rosanna: No.",
        "Craig: Veritas.",
        "Rosanna: I want to enjoy every minute of him.",
        "Craig: He's very fast. One minute he's playing with teddy bears, and the next, he's all grown up.",
        "Cabot: Hello there, Mother. Dad. I trust you are both having a wonderful afternoon.",
        "Craig: It's been fine, son. How about you?",
        "Cabot: The tennis game with Chad was an out and out disaster. He caught me changing the score on three different occasions.",
        "Craig: Oh, well that's too bad. But creativity is not a bad thing, son. It just takes practice.",
        "Cabot: Thanks for the encouragement. Might I have a moment?",
        "Craig: Sure, anything. What's on your mind?",
        "Cabot: Um, my trust fund. I was wondering how much money was in it, and when I could get the check?",
        "Rosanna: How can you even suggest such a thing? My son will never behave so crassly.",
        "Craig: What do you mean \"no chance.\" At least I was honest.",
        "Rosanna: You dog.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna has never been happier. She and Craig are enjoying each other, they're enjoying their child. I would hate to see that come to an end.",
        "Molly: Did Craig tell you what he did?",
        "Carly: No, I don't know any of the details. I just know that it has something to do with Cabot's adoption. If Rosanna were to lose that baby, I don't think she'd ever get over it.",
        "Molly: I realize you and I aren't as close as we once were, Carly.",
        "Carly: Molly --",
        "Molly: But in case you forgot, I don't make a habit of destroying other people's lives for my own amusement.",
        "Carly: I know. I know, I just wanted to talk to you about it. That's all.",
        "Molly: Let me tell you something. If the cops find out about Cabot's adoption, it won't be from me.",
        "Carly: That's not quite the same thing as a promise not to tell.",
        "Molly: It's the best I can do.",
        "Carly: It was nice to see you, cuz.",
        "Molly: Yeah, you, too. Don't be such a stranger. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Now, I don't think that we should impose our dreams on Cabot. As far as I'm concerned, he can grow up to be whatever kind of man he wants. Can't you? Yes.",
        "Craig: Are you telling me you're not going to give him a little nudge in the right direction?",
        "Rosanna: Well, of course I will. It's a mother's prerogative.",
        "Cabot: These problems in the rain forest have gone far enough. I'm going to South America. I won't be back until this crazy world of ours is back to normal.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, darling, I'm so proud of you.",
        "Cabot: Your guidance has made it possible, Mom. Without you, I wouldn't be the man I am today.",
        "Craig: Are you kidding? Once he hits Rio, it's bye-bye ozone, hello, bossa nova.",
        "Rosanna: It's my fantasy. I'll thank you to stay out of it.",
        "Craig: Can I try a little fantasy for both of us?",
        "Rosanna: All right, be my guest.",
        "Craig: You and me -- 25 five years from now, still in love, still parents of two beautiful children who adore us.",
        "Rosanna: I like that very much.",
        "Craig: It's all ours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Yes, I am calling from the United States. Well, I'm calling to see if you've made any progress in your search for Annabelle Marie Fettle. Oh, she's in custody. Well, I'll tell you whatever I can. I know that she broke her unalienable adoption for a man that lives here in Oakdale, Illinois. Oh, no, I couldn't possibly tell you his name. Craig Montgomery. M-o-n-t-g-o-m-e-r-Y. Yes, Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: How many people need to die before you realize how wrong this is?",
        "Katie: Mike, don't. It's not as if Simon had anything to do with killing that man.",
        "Mike: You've got a dead body outside. Do you think it's going to stop? It's just the beginning.",
        "Simon: Thanks for your opinion, Mike.",
        "Mike: Listen, man, if you really care about her, you will let her leave right now.",
        "Simon: Oh, with you?",
        "Mike: I'm not the issue. She is. Now you said you'd take care of her and you haven't.",
        "Simon: We're going to be fine as soon as we get out here in the morning.",
        "Mike: What are you going to do? Are you going to wait for the next warehouse to blow up? Only this time maybe Katie will be inside of it?",
        "Simon: No, there are no more exploding warehouses in our future. No more guns.",
        "Mike: Really, you can guarantee that? You can look me in the eye right now and promise that you can keep Katie safe? Huh? And I'm not talking about for a week, I'm not talking about for a month, I'm talking about for the rest of her life. Can you do that? That's what I thought. Look, man, she believes that you're an honest man. I think it's about time to tell the truth. If she stays with you, she is going to die young.",
        "Simon: I tried telling you this before.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and I told you that I am staying with you no matter what. So I don't care.",
        "Simon: Mike is right. Maybe the best thing that you can do for yourself is to stay here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: You actually exposed the charlatan in the middle of her act?",
        "Holden: I knew that Lily wouldn't believe me if I told her that her psychic was phony. So I came up with this plan -- but it backfired.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no, not entirely. No, not if she backed off. That's a step in the right direction.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but -- but what do I do now? Lily's been so distant with me. Now she's angry to boot.",
        "Lucinda: You need some help, darling. You just gotta find somebody who can really get through to her.",
        "Holden: A shrink? Forget it.",
        "Lucinda: Dr. Michaels? No, you've tried that. Have you tried -- [Clears throat] Dusty?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Now, now, Rosanna's upstairs giving Cabot a bath. What's so important?",
        "Carly: I talked to Molly.",
        "Craig: Oh, well -- and what did Molly say?",
        "Carly: I told her how important it is for her to keep quiet about Cabot's adoption. It was kind of weird.",
        "Craig: It was weird? Weird doesn't tell me anything. What?",
        "Carly: She said that if the cops find out, it won't be from her. It sort of sounded like maybe she had already told somebody.",
        "Craig: Any idea who it could be?",
        "Carly: No. I could be wrong.",
        "Craig: Well if Molly talked, then I've got to do something about it -- fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Paul: Who is it?",
        "Rosanna: It's Rosanna.",
        "Paul: Rosanna, what are you doing here?",
        "Rosanna: You have to help me. They're trying to take Cabot away from me.",
        "Paul: Who's they?",
        "Rosanna: The Canadian police. I've tried everything to stop them but they won't give up. [Knock on door] That's them. That's them right now. Please -- you have to take Cabot. You have to take him; you have to go out the back way, please! You have to hide him for me. Please! Please, I don't want somebody to take him from me, I love him so much. Please help me --",
        "Paul: Rosanna --",
        "Rosanna: Please! Please!",
        "Paul: Oh, God -- what have I done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh, Molly -- we have to talk.",
        "Molly: Yeah, well, I'm working, Craig. Somebody has to.",
        "Craig: You can take a break.",
        "Molly: I will. When I feel like it.",
        "Craig: I talked to Carly --",
        "Molly: Ooh, that's a big shocker.",
        "Craig: She said you weren't exactly clear on whether or not you told anyone about Cabot's adoption.",
        "Molly: How do you expect me to remember everything I said to Carly? Frankly, I have more important things on my mind, Craig.",
        "Craig: I think you said something to someone and I wanna know what you said and to who.",
        "Molly: You know, I'm not going to let you make this my fault. You're the one who's been dealing with illegal babies. You're the one that should pay for it.",
        "Craig: What did you say?",
        "Molly: I don't owe you, or Carly, any report on my activities.",
        "Craig: If you tell me the truth, maybe I can fix it.",
        "Molly: The truth? The truth is, life's tough. It's every baby for himself.",

        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Detective Snyder.",
        "Filloux: Detective, this is special investigator Emil Filloux of the Canadian Mounted Police. I'm calling in regard to a case of illegal adoption of an infant male. It concerns one of your citizens.",
        "Jack: You got a name?",
        "Filloux: Last name, \"Montgomery,\" first name, \"Craig.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Are you two done deciding my future? The last time I checked, I thought that was my job.",
        "Mike: You're right. What are you going to do?",
        "Katie: Well, I'm still Simon's wife, so -- as long as he's alive, I'm going to stay with him.",
        "Mike: Good luck.",
        "Katie: Mike, wait, hold on -- if you are really worried about me, then -- why don't you help us?",
        "Mike: I do construction, all right? Settling international gang wars, that's not my job description.",
        "Katie: But you do have a supply boat going to Costa Rica, right?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Katie: So maybe we could get out of the country that way. I mean, of course, we'll still need passports and everything --",
        "Mike: I'm not going to be responsible for shipping you to your death.",
        "Katie: Simon, can I have a minute with Mike?",
        "Simon: Yeah.",
        "Katie: You are an incredible person.",
        "Mike: I really don't need to hear this.",
        "Katie: Yes, you really do. 'Cause I want you to know without any doubt in your mind that everything I said to you the last time we were together is true. I do love you, and I always will.",
        "Mike: No offense, but you got a funny way of showing it.",
        "Katie: You want to know why I can leave you? Because you're gonna be fine. But Simon is different. He needs me now more than ever. He needs me because I'm all he has. So my decision is the same. And I know you think it's crazy. And maybe you're right, maybe I will get hurt. But -- warning me about it is not gonna do any good anymore. You just -- if you love me enough, you'll -- you'll help us get out of here.",
        "Simon: So what happened?",
        "Mike: You got your way again. I'm gonna help you get out of this.",
        "Simon: You think I'm pathetic, right? Nothing to show for my life. Risking everyone's neck to hold onto Katie. You can say it.",
        "Mike: I don't think you're pathetic. Insane. I mean, only a crazy person would believe that he could keep Katie alive. Especially when his whole life's devoted to just staying ahead of the next bullet.",
        "Simon: You're right. I probably won't be able to protect Katie by myself.",
        "Mike: Well, admitting that now doesn't do any good. She's staying with you. It's a matter of time before it's all over, though.",
        "Simon: Maybe something can be done about that.",
        "Mike: That's why I'm here.",
        "Simon: Listen, I think I have a way if we work together, we can keep Katie safe. Problem is, there's a bit of a downside.",
        "Mike: What is it?",
        "Simon: She's gonna hate us both for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Someone made you for an illegal adoption.",
        "Craig: Carly, don't tell Rosanna yet",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: You okay?",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. I was just thinking about leaving, and when I'm gonna see my family again. Did you see Mike?",
        "Simon: No, no.",
        "Katie: He is going to help us leave the country in his supply boat. He's out right now just setting every thing up.",
        "Simon: You must've done quite a sales job.",
        "Katie: Oh, it doesn't take a lot of selling with Mike to do the right thing. Besides, he does still care about me. He doesn't want to see me get hurt.",
        "Simon: Neither do I. There's a good chance that may happen. You know, I've been closing my eyes to the truth, because I wanted to be with you so badly --",
        "Katie: It's okay. We'll take care of each other. We'll keep each other safe.",
        "Simon: Safer than you're gonna be here?",
        "Katie: What are you saying?",
        "Simon: What I'm saying is that I've been selfish. And I can't do it any longer. I had no right to ask you to come back with me, Katie.",
        "Katie: Okay, listen to me, because I'm not going to say this again. Simon, I will never, ever leave you.",

        "Dusty: Is your wife here?",

        "Dusty: Oh, we're friends all of a sudden? I didn't get that memo.",
        "Holden: Lily is in trouble. And I don't know what to do about it.",
        "Dusty: What's going on?",
        "Holden: She's still going through her own private hell. She's been going through it ever since Rose's death. She's distant with me. She's distant with the kids. She hooked up with some psychic who told her that she could contact Rose on the other side.",
        "Dusty: That doesn't sound like her.",
        "Holden: I have tried everything that I know how. Nothing seems to work. She just keeps getting farther and farther away.",
        "Dusty: And where do I fit in?",
        "Holden: You and Lily seemed to bond over Rose's death. And I'm hoping that maybe you can talk to her. Try and get her through it.",
        "Dusty: Put myself between you and your wife? No, it's not gonna happen.",

        "Molly: Did you tell anybody about Annabelle Fettle, or Cabot's adoption, Paul?",
        "Paul: Why do you ask?",
        "Molly: Because Carly and Craig have both come to me pressuring about keeping it a secret.",
        "[Paul sighs]",
        "Paul: You're letting him influence you again. I really thought we were past all that.",
        "Molly: Listen, if you want to hurt Craig, you go right ahead, that's your business, but Cabot is an innocent child. And I won't be any part of destroying that kid's life.",
        "Paul: You won't be any part of anything like that. Just relax, Molly.",
        "Molly: You didn't answer the question. Did you tell anybody about Cabot's adoption?",
        "Paul: What Craig did was wrong! Babies are not commodities to be bought and sold on the open market.",
        "Molly: I never should have trusted you.",
        "Paul: You needed to tell someone the truth. And I needed to bring someone to justice. We both got exactly what we wanted.",

        "Rosanna: Hey, twice in one day?",
        "Carly: I was in the neighborhood.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I'm glad you came back. [Doorbell rings] Wow, busy day.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: Hmm.",
        "Carly: Aren't you gonna find out who that is?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, Phyllis will get it. You know, you haven't happened to -- have seen Craig, have you?",
        "Carly: Craig let me in. He wanted me to tell you that he had to go back to Metro. But he'll be back as soon as he can.",
        "Jack: Hello?",
        "Rosanna: Oh.",
        "Jack: Hi. I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Carly: Just visiting. Is Cabot awake? Maybe we could visit with him for a few minutes.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, he's supposed to be sleeping, but -- I could see if he's still up.",
        "Carly: Would you? Because Jack hasn't seen him in weeks.",
        "Jack: Wouldn't want him to forget me.",
        "Rosanna: All right. Well, I'll just be a minute.",
        "Carly: Okay, good. What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: I got a call from the Canadian Police. They think Craig's involved in some illegal baby adoption.",
        "Carly: What are you going to do?",
        "Jack: I'm gonna bring him in for questioning.",
        "Carly: No! You can't do that.",
        "Jack: Why not?",
        "Carly: Because --",
        "Jack: What do you know about this, Carly?",
        "Carly: Craig cut some corners when he adopted Cabot. And if word gets out about that, then my sister could lose her baby.",
        "Jack: Why didn't you tell me about this before? You were protecting him?",
        "Carly: No, I'm not protecting Craig. If he were put into jail tomorrow, I wouldn't even see him off at the bus. Rosanna's the one I'm worried about, Jack. This information could destroy her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Craig is going to blame me for busting him to the cops. Carly's going to blame me for ruining her sister's life. Does that seem fair to you when I haven't done a damn thing?",
        "Paul: Molly, you need to calm down. And let me show you how you're going to be able to handle this.",
        "Molly: No, thanks. You know what? You said that you weren't going to betray me, Paul.",
        "Paul: And I didn't betray you. What I did was protect both of us.",
        "Molly: How?",
        "Paul: I didn't tell the Canadian authorities who I was. I told them that I was Annabelle Fettle's ex-boyfriend. And that I was tired of seeing her break the law. That's what's going to be on the record. That's what Craig and Carly are going to have to accept.",
        "Molly: Well, they're not. They're not. Carly and Craig are never going to believe that. They're going to assume that I was involved.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, let them assume whatever they want. You just keep denying everything, and there's no way they will be able to connect you.",
        "Molly: Next time I have a secret, I'm never telling it to you.",
        "Paul: Let's not lose focus here, Molly. I may have been the one to report the crime, but Craig was the one who committed it.",
        "Carly: You can call Mounties. You can tell them that you questioned Craig. That he showed you documentation that the adoption is legal. Then maybe they'll figure their tip was bogus --",
        "Jack: And I'm supposed to risk my career for Craig, why?! Because he'd do the same exact thing for me?",
        "Carly: Because I want you to save my sister.",
        "Jack: There's no time, Carly. The Mounties are sending someone down here to investigate.",
        "Carly: You could refuse to cooperate.",
        "Jack: That's not going to make any difference to them. Whatever Craig is hiding, it's gonna come out.",
        "Craig: Jack, Carly -- where's Rosanna?",
        "Carly: Upstairs with Cabot.",
        "Craig: I'm gonna tell her I'm back.",
        "Jack: No, Craig, wait. You're gonna have to come down to the station.",
        "Craig: Why's that?",
        "Jack: To answer questions about Cabot.",
        "Craig: Jack, I can't go traipsing down to the police station every time you want a little company.",
        "Jack: This didn't come from me. Annabelle Fettle was arrested in Canada. The police are sending someone to Oakdale. They're expecting to talk to you.",
        "Craig: Why me?",
        "Jack: Well, someone made you for an illegal adoption.",
        "Craig: All right, all right. Carly, don't tell Rosanna yet. Yet.",
        "Carly: It's over. The best thing you can do is tell her the truth yourself.",
        "Craig: I am not going to lose my family, Carly.",
        "Jack: C'mon, Craig.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, are you leaving so soon? I thought you wanted to see Cabot.",
        "Jack: I -- I do. Ah -- hey, buddy. He got big.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, and handsome, too, huh? You know, if I didn't know he was adopted, I'd think he looked exactly like his daddy.",
        "Craig: Listen, I've gotta go with Jack for a little while. Do you want me to pick up dinner, do you wanna go out?",
        "Rosanna: You're leaving again?",
        "Jack: He's got business at the police station.",
        "Craig: I won't be long.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Jack: Thanks for bringing Cabot down. He's a beautiful kid.",
        "Rosanna: My husband just lied to me. Would you happen to know why? It's serious, isn't it?",
        "Carly: Yeah, it is.",

        "Dusty: You know, if Lily came to me for help that would be a different story. I would do everything I could. You know that.",
        "Holden: But she can't. She won't. That's why I'm asking. Lily needs someone that she can open up to. Someone who was as close to Rose as she is. You and I both know that I would not be doing this if I were not desperate. [Phone rings] Hello? Okay, thanks for letting me know. That was Lucinda. Lily's over at the house.",
        "Dusty: Oh, good. So things are under control. She'll talk to her mother.",
        "Holden: Lucinda means well, but she's impatient. That's not what Lily needs right now.",
        "Dusty: And what about your cousin Jack or your mother?",
        "Holden: Do you think this is easy for me to ask you to do this?! I'm doing it because I care about Lily, and I don't want her to end up right along with Rose. And I would expect you to help me for those very same reasons.",

        "Mike: Yeah, you are both now employees of Kasnoff and Associates.",

        "Mike: There's a fax machine at the bait shop down the road. I just had someone from my office fax the paperwork over.",
        "Simon: So, what do we do now?",
        "Mike: Well, the ship leaves tonight. It's -- the documents will get you on board and out of the country.",
        "Katie: And then what?",
        "Mike: Once you hit Central America, there's gonna be a few stops along the way. Just pick one, and there will be someone there to sneak you into the country.",
        "Simon: I think we should carry our own papers, in case we get separated. I owe you for this.",
        "Mike: I'm not looking for payback. It's all about keeping Katie being safe.",
        "Simon: Well, I'll wait outside. Katie --",
        "Katie: Yeah?",
        "Simon: I just want you to know, you are the most glorious person I've ever known.",

        "Dusty: No, I'm here to see how you're feeling. That's all.",
        "Lily: I don't need a shoulder to cry on.",
        "Dusty: Wait, who's talking about crying? I don't want to see any tears. I -- I just think we've been making a mistake. I think your sister was all about laughter and fun. And we haven't been honoring her spirit with any kind of song and dance or laughs of our own. You know, we gotta --",
        "Lily: Just stop it! You are not going to make stop feeling what I'm feeling about Rose's death! So, take your song and your dance and just get out! And tell Holden to never do something like this ever again.",
