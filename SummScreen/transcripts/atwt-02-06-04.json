        "Lily: Get out!",
        "Dusty: You don't even know why I'm here.",
        "Lily: Oh, I heard what you said. I shouldn't be crying in the wake of Rose's death. I should be singing and dancing and having fun --",
        "Dusty: Will you just hear me out, all right?",
        "Lily: No! I'm so sick of everyone telling me how I should be feeling now that Rose is dead. Whatever you're offering me here, I don't want to hear it. I've heard it before. Whether it's your ear, your pity, your shoulder to cry on. I don't want it! Just get out! And leave me alone! Now!",
        "Dusty: Close the door.",
        "Lily: Not until you're on the other side of it.",
        "Dusty: Who are you to kick me out of Rose's house? Tell me?",
        "Lily: This is my property. I own this house.",
        "Dusty: Rose is your property? Your pain? Your suffering? Your loss? You think you're the only one that can't sleep at night? I think -- I think all the time about her, you understand? I mean, when I finally do get to sleep, I dream about her, too.",
        "Lily: And when you wake up, who's next to you? Molly? Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: Nonsense, that's over and you know it.",
        "Lily: But Rose was my sister, my twin sister. To you, she was nothing but another notch on your belt!",
        "Dusty: To me, she was everything! She was sexy -- she was -- she was my friend. Dammit! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. Isn't it? Isn't it?",
        "Lily: She left me, Dusty. She left me here!",
        "Dusty: She didn't leave you by choice. You know that.",
        "Lily: After she died, I could feel her, I could feel her! I could actually see her! Now, there's nothing. I don't know where she is. I can't find her! I need to find her! I need to find her. I need a way to find her!",
        "Dusty: I know a way. I think I know a way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Rosanna -- what are you doing here?",
        "Annabelle: This is what you get for selling me out! You want to know what he did? I'll tell you.",
        "Jack: You keep your mouth shut.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, I'll take care of everything.",
        "Rosanna: What's there to take care of? Why did she say that we should tell our baby good-bye?",
        "Craig: She's nuts. There's been a little misunderstanding. That's all.",
        "Rosanna: Is what she said true?",
        "Craig: There's been a little problem with Cabot's adoption.",
        "Rosanna: You promised. You swore!",
        "Craig: I know, I know! Look, I trusted her. We all trusted her.",
        "Annabelle: I'm not taking this rap alone! He knew from the start! He knew everything! You laid down a truckload of money to get that baby. No way did you think it was legal!",
        "Craig: We have a contract.",
        "Rosanna: Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me. Tell me. Is what she saying true? What have you done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I would have been here a lot sooner if you'd just picked up that phone of yours. Where's Katie? Don't mess with me, Mike. Where is my sister?",
        "Mike: She took off a little while ago looking for Simon.",
        "Margo: And you just let her go?",
        "Mike: I'm hoping that by the time she gets there, he'll be long gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Simon! Simon! No, no, no! You can't be gone! Simon, you can't do this to me again! Please, you can't!",
        "Simon: You're right, I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Did you see Bonnie?",
        "Jessica: Well, hello to you, too.",
        "Sarah: Sorry, it's just --",
        "Jessica: Yes, I did see Vonnie.",
        "Sarah: Okay. Ben's parking the car, and I just thought, you know, he'll be here any minute. I just wanted to know, did you give her my letter?",
        "Jessica: I said I would, didn't I?",
        "Sarah: Well, did she open it right away? What did she say?",
        "Jessica: She is very happy that you're staying with Ben and me, and she's very pleased that you're doing well. Hi.",
        "Ben: Hey. I missed you.",
        "Jessica: Really? I wasn't even gone overnight.",
        "Ben: Well, I still missed you.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie sends her love. And Sarah and I were just talking about that.",
        "Ben: Oh, well, don't let me stop you.",
        "Sarah: Well, it's just girl stuff. It can wait until later, right, Jessica?",
        "Jessica: Absolutely. So how was your day, honey?",
        "Ben: It was long, and -- and I'm very hungry. So, Sarah, why don't you see when Curtis is due for a break? Maybe he can join us for dinner.",
        "Sarah: Okay.",
        "Ben: You lied to Sarah about that letter. Didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, darling, if you're going to stand outside in the freezing cold, well, you better -- you better have this. Okay. All right, that's better.",
        "Holden: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: You're welcome.",
        "Holden: How are the kids?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, fine. Emma's getting them ready for bed. Everything's fine. Now, I know you're -- or I imagine that you're probably beating up on yourself right now, but I think having Dusty talk to Lily, it was a good idea.",
        "Holden: Because it was your idea?",
        "Lucinda: We had to do something.",
        "Holden: I just wish we had done something else. I don't trust that guy.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, with Lily reaching the point where she's hiring fake psychics to bring Rose back from the dead, I mean, what the hell harm can Dusty do to her?!",
        "Holden: Dusty has a way of screwing things up.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Well, what did you ask him to do?",
        "Holden: I asked him to be her friend. I asked him to just be there for her, to talk to her.",
        "Lucinda: You are such a hero. You're a veritable hero. I know, we know that you wish that she would come to you.",
        "Holden: I keep waiting for the moment when Lily finally comes running, when she finally says to me, \"Holden, I need you to help me get through Rose's death.\" But instead, the best I can do to help my wife is to send her to Dusty Donovan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So this is what's supposed to help me over the death of my sister? Some foundation?",
        "Dusty: That's the insurance money I got from Rose's death. What else am I gonna do with it?",
        "Lily: What do you need me for? You wanna start a foundation, go for it.",
        "Dusty: I need your help.",
        "Lily: Oh, I got it. This is the plan. This is my distraction. Hmm?",
        "Dusty: I like you so much. But if you think I'm prepared to work my tail off to put you through therapy -- I'm doing this for Rose.",
        "Lily: You don't need me. You're a businessman. You know how to raise money, put people together.",
        "Dusty: I think you know that the success for this kind of thing depends on someone like you who is a good socialite. You know, this is your expertise. It's not mine.",
        "Lily: Please. Thank you so much for that idea. That's great. I don't have time.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah, what are you doing instead? You're hanging out here in your shrine to Rose. You can go down to the beauty shop, maybe hope she shows up or something?",
        "Lily: I thought you understood --",
        "Dusty: I do understand! I think we should both understand -- that we gotta stop pretending like she doesn't exist anymore. And if we're gonna spend time missing her, let's make it count.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about? Building soup kitchens and after-school programs? That's gonna help me get over my sister's death?",
        "Dusty: Who is your grief for anyway?! You?! Rose? You don't think I wanna go back? If I could have one moment with her, to hold her, to -- there can be no wallowing. You understand? That wasn't what she was about. It's not what we're about. It's not an option. We gotta do what she would have done.",
        "Lily: If I had been the one that died, do you see Rose running out opening up a hospital?",
        "Dusty: No, she probably would've opened up a cheesy mall or something. Who cares? It doesn't matter. She would've had strength to move on, to rise above. That's what we gotta do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You booked passage for Simon on a supply ship?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Why? Because now, suddenly, do you trust the guy?",
        "Mike: As long as he stays out of town and leaves her behind, that guy's my new best friend.",
        "Margo: What time does the boat leave?",
        "Mike: Within the hour.",
        "Margo: What pier?",
        "Mike: Where are you going?",
        "Margo: Well, I'm going to arrest Simon for staging that shootout in the church. At least then if I have him in protective custody, at least I can keep him safe.",
        "Mike: But he's leaving.",
        "Margo: And so is Katie. She's going to chase after him! What other way do I have to protect my sister? Where is he?",
        "Mike: She's okay, she's safe. I promise you, he will not take her. You've gotta let Simon go, Margo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Thank God I got here on time. I thought I was too late. I thought the ship had already left.",
        "Intercom: All passengers to pier three for boarding.",
        "Katie: Hurry, get someone to open this gate for me. I gotta get in here.",
        "Simon: I can't do that.",
        "Katie: Right, we don't wanna call attention. See if you can pick this lock. Honey, you can do this. We just have to hurry. We don't have much time!",
        "Simon: You can't come with me.",
        "Katie: But you just said that you wanted --",
        "Simon: What I said was -- I meant I couldn't leave without saying good-bye.",
        "Katie: No. No, there's gonna be no more good-byes tonight. Please, Simon, please! You have to let me come with you.",
        "Simon: It's impossible.",
        "Katie: I'm not gonna let you go alone. You're so tired from being on the run. You've been making mistakes. You said so yourself. Please, don't tell me I can't come with you. I have to!",
        "Simon: You are only going to slow me down.",
        "Katie: No, don't do this. Please don't do this to me again. Simon, please.",
        "Simon: We only have a few minutes left before I have to leave. Please, let's not spend it arguing. Mike and I talked about this. This is the best way.",
        "Katie: You and Mike talked about this? What about me? What about what I think, what I want?",
        "Simon: What are you doing?",
        "Katie: I'm climbing over this fence because I'm coming with you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: How much did you pay that woman for her baby?",
        "Craig: What does that matter?",
        "Rosanna: Just how much? Was it 40,000? 100,000? A million?",
        "Craig: Who cares?! Why money?",
        "Rosanna: Because the amount would have been a clue. It would have been a tip- off. If you had to pay an exorbitant amount to get a baby, then you would have known. You would have known more than anyone that something was shady. So how much did you pay?",
        "Craig: Nothing mattered except bringing home a baby to you. All right, I was desperate.",
        "Rosanna: What? Desperate enough to steal a child?",
        "Craig: No! No! No! Look, so what if the documentation was a little messy, so what if it cost a little more. You were counting on me.",
        "Rosanna: No, don't blame this on me. I wanted a baby. I wanted a baby more than anything! That's why I was willing to start a process that was legal. A process that you did everything in your power to disrupt! I mean, if I remember, the only reason you were so desperate to get a baby was to get yourself out of hot water with me. You knew if you came back to Oakdale and you put a baby in my arms that you'd be back in my good graces.",
        "Craig: That's right. That's right. But I never knew there would be these kind of problems.",
        "Rosanna: I am such an idiot. I don't believe that you could practically walk in the door with this beautiful, perfect little thing, without any investigations or interviews or waiting period. But I asked you? I asked you?! I begged you?! I made you promise me that everything was in order and you promised me!",
        "Craig: I didn't know.",
        "Rosanna: You named him Cabot Montgomery! You put our names together on that baby! On that perfect, beautiful little thing! It was ours! Our names, our baby, our -- he was all wrapped up with him. His smile. His eyes, his perfect little hands and fingers.",
        "Craig: We're not gonna lose him.",
        "Rosanna: We've lost him! We don't have any choice! And it's because of you!",
        "Craig: I didn't know.",
        "Rosanna: You had to have known. The only question is when you figured it out. When was it? When you paid the money? When Annabelle came wondering around, was she blackmailing you? When the medical records didn't match, was that when you knew? When did you figure it out?",
        "Craig: Well, look, look, sure, I had doubts about Annabelle Fettle. Who wouldn't? But we have paper. He's our son. He is our son. Listen, I don't even know the moment that happened. But I can't even conceive him being with anybody else. He is ours.",
        "Rosanna: He was.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no, no. We are not gonna lose him. I am gonna fix this, and we will be a family.",
        "Rosanna: Don't, don't, don't. Don't ever touch me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: How did I let myself get talked into this? Dusty is part of the problem. He has his own sick obsession with Rose. You put Dusty and Lily together, who knows what might happen? Dusty might push her farther over the edge.",
        "Lucinda: Am I hearing jealousy?",
        "Holden: Yeah, maybe you are. So what? Am I out of line to want my wife to need me instead of that --",
        "Lucinda: She loves only you.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I keep telling myself that. And I'll tell you something -- I loved Rose very much. But right now, I hate her for dying and taking my wife with her.",
        "Lucinda: Where are you going?",
        "Holden: I'm going to get my wife and bring her home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm just so tired of everyone trying to fix me -- my mother, my husband, even my children. Those babies draw me these beautiful pictures, trying to make me happy. They talk softly around the house, hoping that I won't start crying again.",
        "Dusty: They need you.",
        "Lily: I know. And I want that back. Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm not looking for Rose. Maybe I'm just trying to find myself again. I just wanna be Holden's wife. I wanna be the children's mother. I just can't do it!",
        "Dusty: Why don't you work with me?",
        "Lily: Would you stop with this foundation? Don't you hear what I'm trying to say? I don't want it!",
        "Dusty: What do you want? What is it? What do you want?",
        "Lily: I don't wanna feel this anymore. I don't wanna feel the grief and the memories and why I spent most of my life not even knowing Rose existed. I want that back. I want her -- I don't want this. I don't want this tacky necklace and her boxes and all her horrible makeup. And if you have this foundation with her picture on it and at the top of every letterhead, I can't deal with that, no!",
        "Dusty: You wanna forget about her?",
        "Lily: Maybe I should burn all of her things. Maybe that will help me feel that she never existed in my life. Maybe then I'll have a little peace!",
        "Dusty: Okay. You got it.",
        "Lily: Dusty? Dusty -- what are you doing? Where -- where are you going? Dusty, wait!",
        "Dusty: You wanna do the honors? This is what you want, right? You wanna get her out of your mind? Out of your life forever? Are you ready? Go ahead.",
        "Lily: Put those things back inside. Go back inside.",
        "Dusty: I want you to do it. I want you to do it. Huh? If it's gonna make you more at peace, let's do it.",
        "Lily: No. No, Dusty, no, please!",
        "Dusty: These are all her things. This is a reminder of your twin sister, and if we get rid of it, it's gonna be like she never lived. And that's what you want.",
        "Lily: No, Dusty, don't! Don't destroy her things! Don't!",
        "Dusty: That's more like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: By the time she gets to the dock, Simon will be onboard.",
        "Margo: You really think this is what's good for her? Having to spend the rest of her life wondering whether those thugs are gonna catch up with Simon, whether they're gonna someday shoot him? You think that's the best way for her to spend the rest of her life?",
        "Mike: No, but it was the only thing we could do to make her stay here, the only thing that would keep her safe, all right.",
        "Margo: Good, good, she's gonna stay here in town. But can I tell you something, Mike?",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Margo: She certainly is not gonna stay with you.",
        "Mike: Well, that's a chance I'm gonna have to take, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: Get down from there. Listen to me. Look at me. I love you. And I want you to be happy. But if you come with me, all you're gonna be is a fugitive. I'm sorry it's taken me so long to face that fact, but now that I have, you can't come with me. I won't allow it.",
        "Katie: Simon, I'll follow you. I'll get on a plane, and I will be there when you get off the boat.",
        "Simon: I'll get off the boat somewhere you won't be able to find me.",
        "Katie: No. I'll find you. I've found you before, and I'll do it again.",
        "Simon: But before, I was always looking over my shoulder, longing for you. But this time, I'm not turning back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You said life wasn't worth living without me, and it's not worth living without you either. Please!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: The judge ordered that there was to be no contact between Sarah and Bonnie. No contact.",
        "Jessica: And there hasn't.",
        "Ben: But you made Sarah believe that you guys are somehow getting away with the judge's ruling. Aw, man, this is jacked up all the way around. Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first, we lie to Sarah about delivering the letter. Then you have to lie about Bonnie's reaction. Then you gotta lie about some kinda response to the letter. I mean, there's no way you can keep it up, Jess. It's doomed. You need to just tell Sarah the truth.",
        "Jessica: I can't.",
        "Ben: All right. I'll tell her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You don't want to destroy your sister's memory, you're just -- you're angry. 'Cause she left you behind. There wasn't a bright color that she didn't love.",
        "Lily: So -- a foundation?",
        "Dusty: You gotta understand something. I need to do something for Rose. You've gotta build something. Something she would love, put her stamp on it. Remind people, you know? Who she really was.",
        "Lily: It would kinda be like Rose's name in lights. You know, she would like that.",
        "Dusty: Yes. Tell me that you're going to help me.",
        "Lily: Oh, I -- I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Dusty: Please.",
        "Lily: Maybe.",
        "Holden: I was out for a walk. And I thought I heard you screaming, Lily. So, I -- is everything all right?",
        "Lily: You two did set this up. Didn't you? Didn't you?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Did it help?",
        "Lily: Oh, yes. Yes, Holden, you are my hero. First you prove that that psychic I found was a fake. And now, you've shown me there are two other people in this world that I cannot trust. I'm going to put Rose's things away. And then I want you to go. Both of you go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Now, Rosanna, we can keep Cabot. There is always a way. But we have to stand together on this. All right?",
        "Rosanna: You want to stand together? To do what? Talk? I have nothing left to say to you. Be happy? How? You wanna -- you wanna love each other? I have no love left for you.",
        "Craig: Rosanna -- Rosanna!",
        "Jack: Inspector Filloux has some questions for you. Come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: If you were just going to leave again like this, why did you bother coming back in the first place? Why didn't you just keep letting me think you were dead?",
        "Simon: I missed you so much. I talked myself into thinking I could keep you safe and still be with you. But I was wrong.",
        "Katie: I'm stronger than you think. I'm stronger that you give me credit for.",
        "Simon: I don't underestimate you, Katie Frasier. You're stronger than any ten men I know. You're love is fierce and never quits. That's why I chose you as the one person who I could spend every single day with for the rest of my life.",
        "Katie: If you can love me like that, then how can you just leave like this?",
        "Simon: Loving you like that? How can I risk you?",
        "Katie: Please, Simon -- please let me go with you. Please! Please!",
        "Simon: I would do anything in the world for you, but leaving the safety of family and your home, I just can't do that.",
        "Katie: So you're just going to leave me here?",
        "Simon: I messed up big time, Katie. I've messed up big time. I want you to move on with you're life. I want you to be happy.",
        "Katie: I made love to you. I chose you. That's what I'm trying to get you to understand. I understand what I'm leaving. I understand what I'm giving up. I understand the danger. I made that choice already. So, please, please, we belong together. You said life wasn't worth living without me. And it's not worth living without you, either. Please!",
        "Simon: Katie --",
        "[Both crying]",
        "Katie: We'll find a place to live. We'll build our cottage there. We will have our children there. We can do this, Simon, I know it. We can be happy again. We can make a life.",
        "Simon: Someday -- you'll understand.",
        "Katie: No, Simon! Stop right there, damn it! I am not finished with you. You need to understand something. When I thought you were dead, and you had no choice in leaving me, I could have loved you forever. But if you leave me right now when I am begging you not to, I swear I will hate you forever. Do you hear me? I will hate you, I swear!",
