        "Casey continues to try to dodge the reason why he thinks Nate is wrong for Maddie, and winds up only angering Maddie further. She finally blows up at him, sending him out the door. For a couple that have strong feelings for one another, they seem to be farther apart then ever. Gwen calls 911, as Will worries that he might have killed his mother. When Gwen won't leave his side, they decide to leave since they have done all they could for Barbara. Jen continues to worry about Barbara, and when she can't reach her by phone goes up to her suite, surprising Will and Gwen who are about to leave. They hide out as Jen finds Barbara's unconscious body. They call 911 but are surprised to see the EMT's show up while they are on the phone. Barbara is whisked away to the hospital as Jen wonders who could leave Barbara in this condition? Jen calls a guilt ridden Will and pleads with him to come to the hospital. Later, Will talks with an unconscious Barbara hoping that she won't remember what happened, but wishing she would be ok. After he leaves, Barbara's eyes suddenly open wide. Carly eavesdrops on a conversation Jack and Nick have about going undercover at a strip club to bust the mob. Carly is determined to get Jack's job back for him and to run Nick out of town in the process. When Nick arrives undercover at the strip club, Carly isn't far behind. Lily, Holden and Luke wonder about the mystery girl Jade. She seems overly happy to see Lily, but Lily doesn't know her. When they locate the girl's backpack by their driveway, they ask why she was there? Jade seems evasive at first, but when they press her, she blurts out that she is looking at the face of her mother."

        "Jack: You don't say?",
        "Nick: Yeah, I got the files right in here.",
        "Carly: The Anatoly case? That's your case, isn't it? That's the gambling ring. That's your case. You did all the groundwork.",
        "Jack: Carly, go home. Tell the kids I'll see them at breakfast, okay?",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: It's you. I can't believe it.",
        "Lily: Do I know you?",
        "Jade: No. I'm Jade. Jade Taylor.",
        "Lily: I'm Lily Snyder. This is my son, Luke. My husband, Holden. Dr. Hale said you wanted to see us.",
        "Jade: I did.",
        "Lily: Well, here we are.",
        "Jade: It feels like a dream.",
        "Lily: You're bound to be a little fuzzy because of the accident.",
        "Jade: I don't care about that.",
        "Dr. Hale: Oh, excuse me, I have to examine the patient now.",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Lily: Okay.",

        "Maddie: You completely sabotaged my date.",
        "Casey: I took the trash out, that's all.",
        "Maddie: You knew we were outside and you came out anyway.",
        "Casey: Get real. The guy was working to get you alone all night.",
        "Maddie: Hello! I didn't want it to be work.",
        "Casey: You have no idea what you're saying.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Casey: Nate is not the guy you think he is.",
        "Maddie: Oh? And how do you know what I think?",

        "Jennifer: That's fine.",
        "Dusty: Jen? Have a look at the menu.",
        "Jennifer: I just wish my mom hadn't cancelled.",
        "Dusty: Well, maybe she wants the night to herself.",
        "Jennifer: That's not it. She found out this afternoon that Paul hated her so much that he won't even let her touch the papers in his estate. And this morning, Will told her that he wants her out of his life for good. I mean, that's a pretty bad day.",
        "Dusty: Would you feel better if she was here talking about it?",
        "Jennifer: I just don't think that she should be alone right now. I mean, I know how I would feel if Johnny cut me out of his life.",
        "Dusty: Well, that wouldn't happen.",
        "Jennifer: I'm serious.",
        "Dusty: So am I. You're not your mother.",
        "Jennifer: She's hurting.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, it's no wonder Barbara is where she is after the way she treated you guys.",

        "Gwen: She's still breathing.",
        "Will: I didn't mean to make her fall.",
        "Gwen: It looks like she clobbered her head on the table.",
        "Will: She wouldn't put the phone down. So I grabbed it and I pushed her.",
        "Gwen: Hey, she fell. It was an accident. I'm calling 911.",
        "Will: I'll try to -- what? Mom?",
        "Gwen: Hello? I need an ambulance at the Lakeview.",
        "Will: Mom? Please wake up, Mom.",

        "Gwen: I don't know the number, it's Barbara Ryan's suite. Please hurry. [Gwen doesn't hang the phone up all the way.]",
        "Will: Mom?",
        "Gwen: Hey, an ambulance is coming. We probably shouldn't move her. I don't know what else to do.",
        "Will: Leave.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: Gwen, I'm serious. You've got to get out of here right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You know, Anatoly has to have another way to launder the money. We've got him on bookmaking, racketeering --",
        "Jack: Drugs.",
        "Nick: What?",
        "Jack: The heroin trade in the market district -- that's Anatoly. You knew that, right?",
        "Nick: Of course I did. It's just -- there's probably more.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I've got a source working on that.",
        "Nick: Well, the point is, he cannot be running all of his money through bookmaking. I mean, he's got another spot, and I found it.",
        "Jack: The Galaxy Strip Club?",
        "Nick: Right.",
        "Jack: Took me a while to track that one down, Nick.",
        "Nick: So then I guess you already know about the poker tables in the back of the Galaxy's main room.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I got one V.I.P. table there, yeah.",
        "Nick: Yeah, but that's where we can get the high rollers.",
        "Jack: We get leads on where their business is headed. We find someone we can turn. I figure it's an undercover job. But we've got to work slow, okay? We don't want to throw too much cash around. Not at first. These guys won't trust the flash.",
        "Nick: Exactly. Get to know the manager, become a regular, be real quiet.",
        "Jack: Show them a serious man of business, yes.",
        "Nick: That's right. I'll go over there tonight. I bet you I will be at the top table within a week or two, tops.",
        "Jack: Wait, you?",
        "Nick: Of course.",
        "Jack: No. No way in hell you should be the one undercover.",

        "Lily: Don't worry, Jade. We're not going anywhere. We'll be right outside.",
        "Jade: Okay.",
        "Lily: That's so strange.",
        "Holden: Are you sure you don't know her?",
        "Lily: No, I have no idea who she is. Luke, do you know her? Have you seen her at school?",
        "Luke: No, no, I've never seen her before today when she hit my car.",
        "Holden: Wasn't it the other way around?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Luke: Right. Hey, can I go get a soda? I'll just be right down there, just at the end of the hall?",
        "Holden: Go.",
        "Luke: Thanks.",
        "Holden: How nice, the attitude is back.",
        "Lily: He does, he feels horrible about hitting her, believe me. But he wasn't drinking. Now that we know that Jade's going to be okay, that's really all I care about.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm going to go check on him.",
        "Lily: Oh, okay. How is she?",
        "Jade: Thanks for staying.",
        "Lily: Staying? I told you that I would. And the doctor gave us the good news.",
        "Jade: That I can go?",
        "Lily: That's what he says. Are you absolutely sure? I can't imagine someone being hit by a car and having no internal injuries.",
        "Dr. Hale: No, we scanned her from head to toe. There were no internal injuries. But if you still have pain in a few days --",
        "Lily: She'll call her doctor. Right? Or come back here. Right?",
        "Jade: I'll be fine.",
        "Lily: That's not the answer. So, I'll make sure she does.",
        "Dr. Hale: I'll go write the discharge papers now.",
        "Lily: Thanks. Are you sure that you're ready to leave? If you're worried about the bills, don't worry about that. We'll take care of everything. We're just happy that you're okay.",
        "Jade: It's all we. You keep saying \"we.\" Who is that?",
        "Lily: My husband. My family. It's just a figure of speech.",
        "Jade: No, it's not.",
        "Lily: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Jade: I'm better than I've been in a long time, thanks to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You care about me.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I mean, because you've had my back. And you covered for me when I missed curfew, so --",
        "Maddie: Right, so you're grateful.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Not just that, but yeah.",
        "Maddie: And you pay me back by making look like a total dweeb in front of Nate?",
        "Casey: I was looking out for you, Maddie. The guy lied. That wasn't his sister who called. And I didn't want you to get hurt or think it's something it's not.",
        "Maddie: Something it's not? He kissed me out there. That's what you interrupted.",
        "Casey: A kiss.",
        "Maddie: Yes.",
        "Casey: So?",
        "Maddie: So!",
        "Casey: And that means what? He's a guy!",
        "Maddie: Right. He's a guy. So of course he's really not interested in me? That's your little mind, Casey, okay. Nate's totally different.",
        "Casey: Like you'd know.",
        "Maddie: You think that I don't know the difference between a guy who's just working me and a guy who is actually interested in me?",
        "Casey: No, you don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Okay, I know that my mom's not your favorite person, but come on.",
        "Dusty: I'm just saying, you know why your mother ended up where she is.",
        "Jennifer: She's still human.",
        "Dusty: Of course she is. I'll have the steak.",
        "Jennifer: You hate my family, don't you?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, I found you in tears today over Paul. Paul, who allowed you to believe your baby was dead for months. Now you're so worried about your mother, you can't even order your first meal of your day. So, no, I'm not crazy about your family.",
        "Jennifer: I'll have the fish.",
        "Dusty: I love you. If anybody gets in the way of your happiness, I have a problem with that.",
        "Jennifer: I know. I know. Thank you for that.",
        "Dusty: So if your mother's giving you the night off, it's a good thing. Who are you calling?",
        "Jennifer: I'm going to check on her.",
        "Dusty: We can send her some fish if you want.",
        "Jennifer: You're lucky I think you're cute.",
        "Dusty: Cute?",
        "Jennifer: Sexy?",
        "Dusty: Is that a question?",
        "Jennifer: Okay, that's wrong. The phone's busy. That never happens. She either picks up or it goes straight to voice mail. The phone's off the hook. She never does that. I'm going to go check on her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, why are you still here?",
        "Gwen: I can't --",
        "Will: The EMTs are going to be here any minute. You have to go.",
        "Gwen: I'm not leaving you.",
        "Will: You have to.",
        "Gwen: No, I won't leave you like this.",
        "Will: Gwen, if you're here when they get here, you're gonna get blamed.",
        "Gwen: Don't worry about me.",
        "Will: Gwen, you fought with my mother in public, in this hotel, people saw you. Lisa saw you.",
        "Gwen: No, it was an accident.",
        "Will: It was my accident, not yours. This has nothing to do with you.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm not leaving you to take the blame alone. I'm with you. You can't talk me out of it.",
        "Will: Okay, fine, fine, then we'll both go.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: We'll leave the door open. The paramedics will be here any minute. I don't know what else to do for her, do you?",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: Well then, let's go.",
        "[Doorknob rattles]",
        "Jennifer: Mom? [Knock at the door] Mom, are you in there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You know, there are a lot of reasons why I should be the one who works the inside.",
        "Jack: Give me one.",
        "Nick: Because I'm a poker champion.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Nick: I've won tournaments.",
        "Jack: You're twenty-what?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure youth is on your side here, buddy.",
        "Nick: Actually, it is. If they see some young punk that walks in and drinks too much, is a little too loud, all right, maybe they'll get careless, think I'm harmless.",
        "Jack: Well, that's a gamble.",
        "Nick: Yeah, well we're lucky that's the business that they're in. Besides, you're too high of a profile in this town. I'm an unknown.",
        "Jack: Who's had his face plastered all over the news thanks to the bombing at WOAK? You're Oakdale's biggest star right now.",
        "Nick: Nobody remembers that. Maybe except you.",
        "Jack: What do you say we run this by Hal.",
        "Nick: Jack, there's no way that you can do this with working your second job.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Nick: The security guard thing.",
        "Jack: How do you know about that?",
        "Jack: Look, my personal finances are none of your damn business, Nick.",
        "Nick: Listen, all I'm trying to say is that I used to work security for the bears, all right? Off hours. The money was great. Listen, you work the paper trail during the day keep feeding us tips.",
        "Jack: Like an informant.",
        "Nick: That's not -- that's not what I meant.",
        "Jack: Forget it. Good luck, good luck. You know what, it's all yours.",
        "Nick: Snyder, you're still on this case, and I need back-up.",
        "Jack: You sure as hell do.",
        "Nick: You know, Lieutenant Munson asked us to make this happen, all right, and if you've got a problem with it, speak up, because I need to know now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You think that I'm so clueless that I couldn't even tell if Nate is playing me?",
        "Casey: That's not a bad thing, Maddie. It's nice.",
        "Maddie: So now it's nice to be an idiot?",
        "Casey: You don't have a lot of experience, and that's okay.",
        "Maddie: Oh thank you so much.",
        "Casey: Why are you being such a brat about this?",
        "Maddie: Because -- because you're so condescending. \"Poor Maddie, she's a loser.\"",
        "Casey: I didn't say --",
        "Maddie: \"Nobody would ever date her.\"",
        "Casey: I didn't say that! Just -- you're new at this, right?",
        "Maddie: New at what? And whatever your answer is, it doesn't mean that I don't know. What?",
        "Casey: Have you ever had a real boyfriend, Maddie? Any guy?",
        "Maddie: You mean, the way you go for any girl? No. And the way you're experienced? No.",
        "Casey: Will you just listen? Like, don't jump, just hear me?",
        "Maddie: Fine.",
        "Casey: You see a guy like Nate and you like, make it this big thing. But for him, it's just a night.",
        "Maddie: So you think that I'll blow it out of proportion.",
        "Casey: Yeah. You don't want to throw yourself at him and then get rejected, because then you'd feel like a fool.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, and that would be terrible. I would feel terrible.",
        "Casey: Yeah, you would, and I'd hate that.",
        "Maddie: Would you?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Maddie: Because you care.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I don't want you hurt.",
        "Maddie: Go to hell, Casey.",
        "Casey: Wait, everything I say, you take wrong.",
        "Maddie: Well, what do you want me to think? You tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hits the spot, huh?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I was thirsty. Don't worry, Dad, I'm not going to explode. Or die. So, can we just drop it? Just for tonight?",
        "Lily: Jade, I'm glad that you're okay, I don't think that I had anything to do with it.",
        "Jade: You did. I mean, you stuck around. Most people wouldn't care about a stranger.",
        "Lily: But we do. We all do. We all feel responsible.",
        "Holden: Good news. Dr. Hale just gave you the green light to go home.",
        "Jade: I can leave tonight.",
        "Luke: Jade, I'm so sorry.",
        "Jade: It wasn't your fault. You couldn't have seen me coming. I should've looked before I jumped into the road.",
        "Lily: Okay, well, nevertheless, I'm sure your parents are going to have some questions, and we'd be more than happy to talk to them.",
        "Holden: Did we call her parents?",
        "Lily: No, not yet. Jade, if you want us to call your parents, we'll do that.",
        "Jade: No.",
        "Holden: No?",
        "Jade: There's not -- I mean, you can't call my parents.",
        "Lily: Okay. Our phone numbers. Can you get that card that we have?",
        "Holden: Yeah, sure.",
        "Lily: And here, please call us if you need anything at any time, okay?",
        "Jade: I promise.",
        "Holden: Can we give you a lift somewhere?",
        "Jade: Yes. Please.",
        "Holden: Where do you want to go?",
        "Jade: I need to go back to where the car hit me.",

        "Jennifer: Mom? Mom, I'm coming in. Mom! Mom, hey, Mom, Mom!",
        "Dusty: What happened? Call 911. Jen, call 911.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. Hello, yes, I need an ambulance or a doctor or something at the Lakeview. It's penthouse four. My mom -- she's unconscious. I don't know what happened. I don't know if she fell or -- I don't know, she's just out.",
        "Dusty: Over here.",
        "Jennifer: They're here. How did they get here?",
        "EMT #1: Pulse is thready, but respiration's okay.",
        "EMT #2: You said she fell?",
        "Jennifer: No, we don't know, we just got here. She hit her head? If she hit her head -- my mom had a brain tumor a couple years ago. I don't know, she's been okay, but said that it could recur and --",
        "Dusty: It's okay. It's all right, they're gonna check for everything, right fellas?",

        "Will: Yeah?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, and they don't know what's wrong. They've called a neurosurgeon to do a consult. I don't know how much you know about what happened a couple of years ago.",

        "Jennifer: And now she's lost her baby. Her first son. And she and Will were fighting. I guess I've always thought that she was so completely relentless, but maybe she's done with it, you know? Maybe she's just worn out?",
