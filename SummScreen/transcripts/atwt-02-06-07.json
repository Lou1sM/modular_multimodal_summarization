        "Lily: Faith, you forgot your lunch -- what did you just put in your bag?",
        "Faith: Nothing.",
        "Lily: That's not really supposed to be an answer, is it?",
        "Faith: Yes, it is.",
        "Lily: Okay. Stop right there. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Don't look at me like that, I want to know what you put in your bag.",
        "Faith: I told you, it's nothing. Just something for school.",
        "Lily: Let me see.",
        "Faith: What?",
        "Lily: If you're taking something to school, I'd like to know what it is. Now. Faith --",
        "Faith: Mom, no, don't --",
        "Lily: I want to see what it is. I want to see what you're bringing to school. Is it a toy, is it a -- laxatives? Why would you need -- oh, my God -- when you were sick last night --",
        "Faith: I was.",
        "Lily: I asked you, I asked you if you made yourself sick, you said no.",
        "Faith: Because I didn't.",
        "Lily: Did you take any of these?",
        "Faith: No!",
        "Lily: I don't believe you. Faith -- Faith, what are you doing to yourself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, thank you.",
        "Tom: Well --",
        "Margo: Hey.",
        "Tom: Look who learned to check his voicemail.",
        "Margo: They do grow up.",
        "Casey: Hey, it sounded really important. Was there a break in the robbery at Crash?",
        "Margo: No, unfortunately, nothing new there.",
        "Tom: That's going to change soon. So, can I tell him?",
        "Margo: Oh, by all means, steal my thunder.",
        "Casey: All right, you guys are just a little too excited. So, it's kind of freaking me out.",
        "Tom: Okay, you know your mom has been acting as chief of detectives since Hal passed away. Well, today, they're officially promoting her to that position.",
        "Casey: They are!",
        "Margo: Ta-da, yes. There's going to be a ceremony, and the mayor's going to be here, the commissioner -- I'd really like it if you and Adam could make it.",
        "Casey: Yeah, Mom, this is awesome. I'm so proud of you.",
        "Margo: Oh, thank you. I just wish that it was, you know, under better circumstances.",
        "Casey: No, Hal would be proud of you, too. You deserve this.",
        "Margo: Yes, I do. And I do love you. And don't worry. I'm on duty. Just solving this robbery case at Crash, it's my top priority. Because Will and Gwen are your friends, and you worked so hard with your brother on this. And the money is yours, too. So, after this ceremony, I'm going to get busy on the case. And your mama is going to find whoever stole those bonds.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Ten grand? That's a lot of ponies. Ooh, I think I just lost my appetite.",
        "Maddie: Everyone feels terrible about it. Lisa doesn't want it even getting out in the papers.",
        "Henry: Do the cops have any leads?",
        "Maddie: No, not really. They think it's an inside job.",
        "Henry: But you don't agree.",
        "Maddie: I have a hunch who's responsible.",
        "Henry: Ah, the old Coleman hunch. Rarely has it lead us astray. All right, spill it. Who do you think burgled the bonds?",
        "Maddie: Jade Taylor.",
        "Henry: Jade Taylor?",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Henry: Don't you think that's just wishful thinking on your part, huh?",
        "Maddie: It would be a lot easier to prove if I had, you know, actual proof. But I haven't really come up with any sources.",
        "Henry: I see. And the reason that I'm springing for this continental breakfast becomes very clear. All right, tell brother Henry how he can help you out, Kitten.",
        "Maddie: Okay. So, if she went the bank and tried to cash those bonds, the police would know about it, right?",
        "Henry: Oh, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. The last place you want to go with money that's not yours is to the bank. And the security cameras always capture your good side when you're doing something bad. If there's any life lesson I can impart to you over pancakes, let that be it.",
        "Maddie: Good to know.",
        "Henry: Don't tell me that's all you've got.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, pretty much. Maybe she's just holding off until the coast is clear.",
        "Henry: Maddie, as any good thief will tell you -- well, as it was once explained to me -- always leave yourself more than one way to get out of a tight fix.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Adam dreaming]",
        "Gwen: I can't trust him anymore, Adam. Will, he's destroyed it. It's over.",
        "Adam: Are you sure?",
        "Gwen: He's not the man that I thought that I married. He doesn't share my dreams.",
        "Adam: You deserve so much better than Will, Gwen. You're amazing. You know that?",
        "Gwen: Because of you.",
        "Adam: No --",
        "Gwen: The way that you believe in me. The way that you inspire me. It took me so long to realize --",
        "Adam: What?",
        "Gwen: It's you. You're the one that I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will? Hey, look, I'm sorry that I left last night. You're right, we have to trust each other. Hey, listen, look, I believe in you too much not to \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen? Gwen, it's me. Please open up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith, you're scaring me.",
        "Faith: I didn't take anything.",
        "Lily: I look at your face, and I want to believe you.",
        "Faith: Then believe me.",
        "Lily: I can't. You have made that impossible.",
        "Faith: That's mean.",
        "Lily: I'm not trying to be mean. I'm just scared to death right now. How long has this been going on?",
        "Faith: What?",
        "Lily: How long have you been throwing up your food, taking laxatives?",
        "Faith: I didn't do that.",
        "Lily: Your brother and your sister both heard you last night. I asked you, you said you had an upset stomach. You lied to me.",
        "Faith: I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: What exactly are you sorry about?",
        "Faith: I'm sorry you don't believe me.",
        "Lily: Faith, wait, wait, stop, stop. Please, look at me, look at me. What you're doing is called purging. And it's very, very dangerous.",
        "Faith: Let go of me. I'm not doing that.",
        "Lily: Is that why you're taking these? So you don't have to throw up?",
        "Faith: They're for a friend.",
        "Lily: Okay, don't play games with me. Faith, I know that these are not for a friend.",
        "Faith: How do you know that? You don't know all my friends.",
        "Lily: Listen, right now, I'm telling you right now, I'm not going to accept any more lies from you, Faith.",
        "Faith: You're not being fair, Mom.",
        "Lily: This is not about fair. This is about me being concerned for you. You don't have to do this to yourself. You don't have to make yourself sick. You're a beautiful, beautiful girl. You don't have to be worried about your weight.",
        "Faith: You're just saying that because you're my mom and you have to.",
        "Lily: No, I'm saying that because it's true.",
        "Faith: Whatever.",
        "Lily: Faith, do you have a problem with the way that you look? Please talk to me. Please.",
        "Faith: Why? So you can tell me that I'm wrong, or I'm a liar? You're the one who won't tell the truth.",
        "Lily: The truth about what?",
        "Faith: That I'm fat because I eat too much. But I can stop myself. You have to take your stupid pills.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: So, if Jade didn't take the bonds to the bank, what did she do with them?",
        "Henry: Well, if I was in her position, with $10,000 burning a beautiful hole in my pocket --",
        "Maddie: And you didn't want to get caught.",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, please, that goes without saying. I'd probably investigate one of those check cashing places.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but wouldn't the cops think about that, too?",
        "Henry: Yeah, probably. But these places tend to show a reliable discretion when these matter are concerned. Especially the one on Gardner and Overland.",
        "Maddie: Gardner and Overland?",
        "Henry: Yeah. No, no, Maddie, no, no.",
        "Maddie: What? I'm just going to go over there and ask a few questions. And if I happen to get a few answers that I could use, then I will say thank you and be on my way --",
        "Henry: No, zip it, no! I forbid it.",
        "Maddie: You forbid it?",
        "Henry: I forbid it. Those places are not safe. And the guys that work there, they're a little shady. They've got the tattoos and the body hairs, and the rings in the nose --",
        "Maddie: That's funny. You just described Gus, my lab partner in physics.",
        "Henry: That's cute. Can't you just get Will and Gwen, like, a nice card, or treat them to a latte?",
        "Maddie: Do you remember last summer when everyone thought that I was crazy? And they were pointing at me behind my back and whispering? Who was there for me, Henry? Besides you, besides you. Will and Gwen and Casey. And they stood by me until the end.",
        "Henry: So, you owe them, yeah?",
        "Maddie: Whoever stole those bonds stole Gwen's dream of becoming a singer. And they stole something from Casey, too. He's been trying so hard to make this happen for her. And if I didn't try to make it right, then what kind of friend would I be?",
        "Henry: You are too good for this world, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Mom, you know, I really don't want you to think about the robbery. Not today. I mean, you've got enough going on.",
        "Margo: I'm a woman. I multi-task.",
        "Casey: I know. But I mean, today's your big day. I want you to enjoy it. Not to have to think about it so much.",
        "Margo: Well, thank you, Baby. But I think my new bosses expect me to earn my promotion. And the way to do that, is to solve the case.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but if you don't, it's not like they're going to fire you. I mean, there'll be other cases, right?",
        "Margo: Wow, did you see that? Naive optimism.",
        "Casey: Fine, make fun of me. I'm just trying to be supportive.",
        "Margo: Oh, come here, I know that, Baby. I love you.",
        "Tom: Hey, what just happened? You seem upset.",
        "Casey: No, it's just -- this is a big day. Mom's been working so hard for so long. It's about time they finally give her credit for it, you know?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I'm kind of eager about that.",
        "Casey: Mom, I mean it, I'm proud of you. You are going to do great.",
        "Margo: Thank you.",
        "Casey: And Dad? Seeing you getting better -- until I realize how lucky I am, you guys are amazing parents. I know that I haven't always been the best kid you could ask for.",
        "Margo: All right, stop right there. We can't send you back.",
        "Casey: No, I just wish sometimes I wish I was more like you.",
        "Tom: Well, if you were anyone else, you just wouldn't be my guy, would you?",
        "Casey: Thanks, Dad.",
        "Tom: Look, let me tell you the truth. What you've done to turn things around in the last year, has blown me away.",
        "Casey: I really, I haven't done anything.",
        "Tom: Yeah, okay. So, don't sell yourself short. I mean, recoveries, promotions, those are great rewards. They are things that we celebrate. But what you've accomplished in the last few months? Getting accepted into college, going to work on this demo with your brother, I mean, that's something to be proud of.",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah, you're right. You know, I think I'm going to get Adam and tell him about the news. And then, we'll meet you back here for the ceremony.",
        "Margo: Okay, we're saving you front row seats.",
        "Casey: All right.",

        "Gwen: Will \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Adam: Now's not a good time.",
        "Will: I want to talk to Gwen, where is she?",
        "Adam: After yesterday?",
        "Will: After yesterday, what?",
        "Adam: We really don't have anything to say to you.",
        "Will: Who the hell do you think you are. I want to see Gwen!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith, I don't know what you think you saw, but you've got a very wrong impression.",
        "Faith: Where are they, Mom?",
        "Lily: What are you doing?",
        "Faith: I know their in here.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about?",
        "Faith: These! You take these so you won't be hungry, right?",
        "Lily: I want you to give me those --",
        "Faith: I saw you take them last night, and you only took two bites.",
        "Lily: I want you to stay out of my purse. Do you understand me?",
        "Faith: Then stay out of my backpack!",
        "Lily: I'm going to go into your backpack, I'm going to go into your bedroom, I'm going to open up the walls in your room, if I think you're doing something wrong!",
        "Faith: What about what you're doing? And you don't take these to lose weight? You see, you don't want to answer because you know I'm right.",
        "Lily: That's enough! That's enough. You have to listen to me Faith. You're a little girl. You have no idea what you're doing to yourself. Binging and purging, taking laxatives -- it's very unhealthy.",
        "Faith: So is being fat!",
        "Lily: You're not fat! Okay, I know your body is going through changes right now, but that is very normal. You can't stop it, you can't fight it.",
        "Faith: None of the other girls in my class look like this!",
        "Lily: I can guarantee you, every single girl in your class is as self- conscious as you are. There's not one girl your age who is full of confidence. I know that, I remember --",
        "Faith: You don't know anything!",
        "Lily: I know that I am worried about you.",
        "Faith: You don't care about how I feel at all! You just don't get it!",
        "Lucinda: Hey, hi. What's going on in here? I could hear you outside.",
        "Faith: Mom's trying to make me fat, just like she is! But I don't want ever be like her. I won't let her do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tev: Can I get a large coffee, black?",
        "Maddie: Hi, excuse me. You work at that check cashing place down the street, right?",
        "Tev: Who wants to know?",
        "Maddie: Well, I kinda already know you do. I sort of followed you here.",
        "Tev: Oh, I see. Should I be flattered or frightened?",
        "Maddie: Helpful I hope. I'm Maddie.",
        "Tev: Tev.",
        "Maddie: Hi, nice to meet you. So, do you mind if I ask you a question?",
        "Tev: Yes, it depends on what you want to know.",
        "Maddie: Have you cashed any registered bonds recently? I'm just curious.",
        "Tev: Seriously?",
        "Maddie: I know, it's a really silly question --",
        "Tev: I wish I could help you out, but --",
        "Maddie: Please, please? I'm only asking because my best friend -- well, my ex- best friend -- she has a bit of a problem. She likes to take things that don't belong to her.",
        "Tev: Is she a kleptomaniac?",
        "Maddie: No, she's a thief. Well, you know, boys and money and clothes. The bonds I'm looking for were a birthday present from my grandmother, and I think that my best friend stole them from because I didn't invite her to my party.",
        "Tev: It's a raw deal, yeah?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, you're telling me. Talk about bffs, right? So, it's $10,000, which is just a drop in the bucket for my grandmother. So I'm not going to press charges or anything --",
        "Tev: What are you going to do?",
        "Maddie: Smack some sense into her and give her the help she so desperately needs.",
        "Tev: What does this friend of yours look like?",
        "Maddie: Okay, she's tall, sort of exotic-looking -- model thin -- I don't know, I guess some people might find her attractive.",

        "Gwen: No, what's up?",
        "Margo: Well, I wanted to talk to you and Will. So -- can I come in?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, sorry, come in.",
        "Margo: Something has happened, and I wanted to tell you and Will myself, because it's going to be in the news. They're appointing me Chief of Detectives. So, there's going to be a swearing-in ceremony later on this afternoon at the Lakeview. And lots of department brass, and blah, blah, blah --",
        "Gwen: Wow! That's incredible. Wow, I'm really happy for you.",
        "Margo: Well, thank you. Thank you, thank you. So, I wanted to, you know, let Will know myself. Because -- well, you know, because of his dad.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that's right. Hal was Chief of Detectives for a long time.",
        "Margo: Yeah, he was the man. I still think I'm going to walk in the station, he's going to be yelling, \"Who made this coffee? Did you use sandpaper?\"",
        "Gwen: Yeah, actually, Will does a really good impression.",
        "Margo: Oh, Adam -- you ought to hear Adam. He is Hal! I know he wanted so much for his dad to see the success that you guys are having with your music.",
        "Gwen: Oh, it's nothing compared to your promotion.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, thank you. I don't think I can do half the job that Hal did. He was one of a kind, and I really want Will to know that.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, he'll really appreciate you stopping by.",
        "Margo: So, is he around?",
        "Gwen: No, actually -- you know, I don't know where he is right now.",

        "Will: Adam, where is she?",
        "Adam: I don't know!",
        "Will: You're lying.",
        "Adam: Look, you think she wants to see you now? You're out of control.",
        "Will: She thinks I did this. I didn't steal the bonds, I got set up.",
        "Adam: Nobody set you up.",
        "Will: Where the hell is she? What are you doing here?",
        "Adam: Look, you know what? She was upset last night. The way you went off on here. We talked, I fell asleep, nothing happened.",
        "Will: Just like nothing happened in L.A.?",
        "Casey: Whoa, Will, Will!",
        "Dorm guy #2: Get him out of here!",
        "Will: Casey, come on! I didn't do this. Get off me!",

        "Casey: What happened?",
        "Adam: Don't worry about it.",
        "Casey: Don't tell me not to worry about it. You were beating the hell out of each other. Now, who found one of the bonds?",
        "Adam: Gwen, all right? At their place.",
        "Casey: That's impossible.",
        "Adam: Would you just let it go? It's done.",
        "Casey: No, you know Will's telling the truth. He didn't steal those bonds, I did. I didn't go anywhere near their place. So, how -- when you found out it was me, you said you were going to take care of it. This is what you meant, right? You set Will up.",

        "Lily: Faith, I want you to apologize.",
        "Faith: For what?",
        "Lily: For talking to me like that, and yelling at your grandmother.",
        "Faith: I didn't say anything that wasn't true.",
        "Lily: Okay, you know what? That's it. Go to your room. Please, go to your room and stay there.",
        "Faith: What about school? I have a test.",
        "Lily: A test that you're going to have to make up at another time. You're not going anywhere until you calm down.",
        "Faith: You're grounding me?",
        "Lily: Don't push me.",
        "Faith: I hate you!",
        "Lucinda: Ooh, look's like I got here at just the right time. She doesn't hate you, Dear. She'll never hate you.",
        "Lily: No, no, it's worse than that. She hates herself. She thinks that she is fat.",
        "Lucinda: That's ridiculous. She's a perfectly charming, fine young girl.",
        "Lily: She's been starving herself. And when she is eating, she's purging.",
        "Lucinda: Purging, are you sure?",
        "Lily: Yes, I'm -- her brother and her sister heard her throwing up last night.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, so this is you taking her to task? Oh --",
        "Lily: Yeah, I didn't want to believe it. I had doubts. But -- I'm so stupid!",
        "Lucinda: Honey, how could you know? How could you have any suspicion that anything like this was happening?",
        "Lily: All I had to do was open my eyes. My eyes were opened for me this morning. I found these in her bag.",

        "Lucinda: You want me to talk to her?",
        "Lily: No, I'll handle this myself. I just don't know where this came from. Is it something she watched on television, is it all those magazines she's always reading? This image she has about her weight, it just doesn't make any sense.",
        "Lucinda: Darling -- I want to say something, and I don't want you to take this the wrong way. You know that I'm saying it from love. But I think it's quite possible that she got the idea that she's overweight from you.",

        "Maddie: I really have nothing to say to you.",
        "Jade: But you seem to have plenty to say about me.",

        "Jade: How did I know you were going to continue your little witch hunt from the night before?",
        "Maddie: Oh, I don't know, maybe your guilty conscience told you.",
        "Jade: I didn't steal those stupid bonds.",
        "Maddie: Oh, Jade, thank you. Thank you so much. Now that you said that you didn't steal them, I can sleep, and I believe you --",

        "Maddie: Okay, you stole those bonds to get back at Will and Gwen because they are finally happy, and you can't stand that.",
        "Jade: You're just trying to get back at me, because I called you out on what a psycho you were this summer. And I know you're never going to forgive me because I wasn't the Slasher. Because then it would be me locked up instead of your sister.",
        "Maddie: You know what, Jade? You're right. You're right. You didn't do that. But you did do this, and I'm not going to stop until I prove it.",

        "Margo: Yeah. Are you sure that's all it is?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I just think I'm really tired.",
        "Margo: Oh, 'cause, you know, I'm a mom. And a cop. And I'm shamelessly honest, so there's not much that people can put past me. It's a gift. And a curse. So, what is it? Come on.",
        "Gwen: It's just that when I saw you outside and you said there's something you needed to tell Will and I, I thought it was going to be about the robbery at Crash.",
        "Margo: Oh, Honey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know that's got to be hard for you. I know that was a big dream of yours for a long time. And Adam's, too. I mean, he just can't talk about anything else. I can't get him to shut up, actually.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, he's been really amazing through all of this. Especially since we were, you know, so close to actually getting it done.",
        "Margo: And you will, you will. This is just a minor setback. We'll find who did this.",

        "Margo: Well, I know there haven't been a lot of leads lately, but you know, don't give up on this. I'm not giving up.",
        "Gwen: I'm not. I just think that there are, you know, like, a lot of other cases that are probably, you know, more important.",
        "Margo: Huh -- that's funny. That's just what Casey said. So, I'm going to tell you just what I told him. This case is the top of my list.",

        "Casey: How?",
        "Adam: I ain't telling you that.",
        "Casey: No, why not?",
        "Adam: Because it's not important.",
        "Casey: How can you say that it's not important? Will's your brother, man. Why would you let Gwen think that -- oh, Dude, no, you guys aren't hooking up, are you?",
        "Adam: No, what the hell's your problem?",
        "Casey: Well, I know it happened in L.A.!",
        "Adam: That has nothing to do with this.",
        "Casey: Well, you spent the night here.",
        "Adam: Yeah, 'cause she was upset.",
        "Casey: Oh, she was upset. And you didn't think that would be her reaction after you let her think that Will was criminal?",
        "Adam: You know what? I know what I did to Will stinks, okay? I don't need you to tell me that. I'm the one who has to live with it.",
        "Casey: Well, and whose fault is that?",
        "Adam: You know, you have no idea why I did this, do you?",
        "Casey: I think you did it to get closer to Gwen.",
        "Adam: I did it for you, you idiot. To save you. You stole $10,000, Casey, to pay off your gambling debts, then you trashed the place to cover your tracks. You think the police are just going to drop the investigation and pack it in? Wake up!",
        "Casey: Look, I know I messed up --",
        "Adam: No, you did more than mess up, okay? You broke the law. And I had to come up with something to make sure they wouldn't figure out it was you.",
        "Casey: And the only way to do that was to set Will up?",
        "Adam: After you, he's the next logical suspect, isn't he?",
        "Casey: And what if he goes to jail?",
        "Adam: He's not going to -- they're not going to prosecute him for stealing from himself.",
        "Casey: This is messed up, this is really messed up --",
        "Adam: Would you listen to me? Everybody knows Will does things, right, out of desperation? This just looks like more of that.",
        "Casey: Well, you've got it all figured out, huh?",
        "Adam: Well, I had to come up with something that makes sense. And it makes sense for Will to do this to keep Gwen. I mean, she's the only good thing he's got in his life. He doesn't want to lose her to her career.",
        "Casey: Wow. That makes him look really pathetic.",
        "Adam: Well, this is one time when that's a good thing. It made everybody feel sorry for him. Nobody's going to press charges, not Barbara, not Lisa. Nobody gets hurt.",
        "Casey: Except for Will and Gwen and their marriage.",
        "Adam: Well, that's a chance I had to take.",

        "Adam: What do you mean?",
        "Casey: Will didn't do this, I did. And I can't let him take the blame for it, all right? I'm going to tell Mom it was me.",
