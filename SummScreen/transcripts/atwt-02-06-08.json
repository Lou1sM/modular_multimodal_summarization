        "Carly finds Cowboy Jack burning in her fireplace and blames Parker. Will and Gwen come up empty in Chicago while looking for Sophie. Carly calls Jack about Parker, as Sam calls to ask if Parker took Cowboy Jack again. Parker demands Sam tell his parents that he is setting him up. Lily will not leave town, as requested by Holden. Lucinda and Evan meet up and admit to being in cahoots, but he is also unmasked as the one who poisoned Bob, and the one who was Dusty and the lab tech's killer. Evan holds a syringe to Lucinda because he wants her to give him $10 million dollars and a jet, and Lucinda agrees. Sophie arrives in NYC with Hallie, but she runs into trouble when she loses her wallet. Sophie calls Aaron for help, as she begs him not to tell anyone where she is. After talking to Margo, Will finally convinces Gwen they need to head back to Oakdale. Jack and Carly call the Psychologist to come see Parker. She believes they need to spend a lot more time together as a family and Parker will feel more secure and act out less. Jack and Carly agree. Lucinda calls Lily and pretends she is talking to Gregory, her banker. Lily realizes Lucinda is in trouble and takes off to find her. Carly decides to give up Metro in order to make things right with Parker. Lily shows up at the hospital to save Lucinda, but ends up also being held hostage with Lucinda as well. Lily learns the truth of what Evan has done and Lucinda's involvement. Holden goes to see Margo worried about Lily's well being. Lily calls Holden and tells him to bring $10 million dollars to her at the hospital. Holden leaves the station without letting Margo in on her call, but Margo has a hunch and has him followed. Aaron tries to convince Sophie to go home and explain what happened to Will, Gwen and the Police. Sophie finally seems to agree and a happy Aaron calls Will and Gwen with the terrific news. Sam is upset to hear of Carly's decision. Sophie gives Aaron the slip, and he is forced to call Will and Gwen back now with the bad news. Carly and Jack tell Parker that she has given up Metro, and this seems to bring them closer. Cowboy Jack suggests that Sam get rid of the \u0091bratty kid' for good. Holden brings Evan the money, but Margo shows up and Evan sees this realizing he was double-crossed. He grabs Lily and holds the syringe to her neck."

        "Carly: I know. We found him, Sam.",
        "Sam: I hate to even say this. Was it your son again?",
        "Parker: Tell them the truth, you creep! Tell them you set me up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Yeah, that's right. Lily Snyder, Lucinda Walsh. Three days, two nights, full spa --",
        "Lily: I'm sorry, but Mrs. Snyder is going to have to cancel. She decided to stay home with her husband.",

        "Lucinda: In heaven's name, what -- what have you done?",
        "Evan: What needed to be done. No more, no less.",
        "Lucinda: You -- you poisoned Dr. Hughes? For what -- what?",
        "Evan: Science.",
        "Lucinda: Science. Okay, and Dusty -- Dusty was killed. What was he? A part of a science project?",
        "Evan: It couldn't be avoided.",
        "Lucinda: And the poor technician -- the poor lab technician -- why? Did he get in the way of -- of precious research?",
        "Evan: My research will revolutionize medical science. Million of lives will be saved. The lives of three people are a small enough price to pay.",
        "Lucinda: Three people? You killed two people -- who \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I am not leaving town until we find out who killed Dusty.",
        "Holden: Lily, this is not just about Dusty's murder anymore. It's about what happened to Bob. It's about Neil -- this lab tech, whoever killed him -- they did it because you and I were getting too close to the truth.",
        "Lily: That's why I cannot leave now.",
        "Holden: No, that's why you have to leave now. You could be the killer's next target. I have to protect you.",
        "Lily: What about you? You're in just as much danger.",
        "Holden: I can protect myself. But I cannot -- cannot lose you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Evan Walsh, have you lost your mind totally? You think you can get away with killing me?",

        "Lucinda: Now, wait a minute. You think that you can go around killing people randomly with impunity? You are a disgrace to your family's name. And I have no intention of allowing you to continue any further with your delusions.",
        "Evan: Unfortunately, Lucinda. This isn't about your intentions anymore.",

        "Evan: I'm not going to let you stop me, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: Look -- the police are going to find out. It could take them a while probably, but they'll find out. And you know where you'll be and what will happen to your famous research. Where will to be? You won't be the wonderful -- the wonderful medical researcher with the breakthrough. You'll just be a mad man running around with a syringe. Is that what you want --?",
        "Evan: Nothing will get in the way of my research.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Okay. If that's what you want, then let me help. I can help. I have money. I have lots of money. You're going to need money -- you're going to need a lot of money to get away from here. And I can give it to you and you can find a new place for your research. In Switzerland. Or Mexico. Far, far away from the Oakdale Police. Yeah. Right.",
        "Evan: I see your point.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Evan: All right then. I want $10 million. Yeah, $10 million and a private jet to fly me -- to fly me to somewhere tropical. With a good exchange rate. And no extradition.",
        "Lucinda: It's done. It's done. I can manage that. First thing in the morning, I will go to my --",
        "Evan: No, now!",
        "Lucinda: I'll go to my banker and in a few -- darling, you can't expect me -- you can't expect me to slip my -- my card into the ATM machine here at the hospital. Come on, Baby. You've got to be reasonable.",
        "Evan: I am. Oh, I am. $10 million and a private jet. I'd say my step- grandmother's life is worth that amount. Wouldn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, I'm not leaving you. Not now.",
        "Holden: Lily, think about the kids. They need their mother.",
        "Lily: They need their father, too.",
        "Holden: I told you, I can handle it.",
        "Lily: Please -- please don't ask me to walk away from this. Please. We need to do this together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You set me up! You put that stupid dummy in the fireplace, not me!",
        "Sam: What -- what are you saying? Is Cowboy Jack over there?",
        "Parker: You know he is because you brought him here.",
        "Sam: Come on, Parker. Lying isn't going to do either one of us any good.",
        "Jack: Give me that! Sam, hi, yeah, it's Jack. Listen, we've got your dummy here. Carly and I will take care of Parker.",
        "Carly: There is no reason to be rude to Sam. This is not his fault!",
        "Parker: Yeah, right. Because it's mine. As usual.",

        "Will: Hey, Margo. It's Will.",
        "Margo: Yeah, hi. How are you guys?",
        "Will: We're hanging in there. Have you heard anything on your end?",
        "Margo: No, I'm afraid not. Uh, this is a really bad connection. Where are you calling from?",
        "Will: We're in Chicago. We checked the place where Sofie stayed last fall. But so far, nobody's seen her.",
        "Margo: Oh, she may not even be in Chicago.",
        "Will: Well, it's the only lead we've got. So, we've got to check here.",
        "Gwen: Hey, hand me the phone. Margo, yeah, hi, it's Gwen. Listen, we haven't even been here that long. We were thinking of checking baby stores -- Sofie's going to need to buy formula and clothing, right?",
        "Margo: I hate to say this, but I think you guys are going about it all wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Okay, hold on, baby girl. It's okay. It's okay. It's going to be okay. [Hallie crying] You're fine. Um, where did -- where did I put your pacifier? Where is your pacifier? I don't know. I don't know. Where did Mommy put it? Oh, there. Okay. Okay -- okay. Okay, Baby. I got it. There you go. There you go, that's better. That's better. Don't worry, Mommy's here. Okay, don't worry. Everything's -- everything's going to be fine. Everything's going to be fine. Okay. Okay. Okay, Baby. Okay, come on.",
        "[Sofie drops her wallet and she doesn't notice and she walks down the street]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Honestly, Parker, at this point -- I don't know what to do with you.",
        "Parker: Well, are you guys going to send me away to that camp for the bad kids? Because that's exactly what Sam wants. Me out of the way so he can have a clear shot at Mom.",
        "Carly: Oh, Parker, Sam is not interested in me. Kit is his girlfriend, you know that --",
        "Jack: This isn't about Sam or Kit, okay? It's about us as a family. We're not going to send you away. But we are going to deal with this. All of us, together. Right now, however, you're going to go upstairs, you're going to cool off.",
        "Parker: I keep telling you, I did not touch that dummy. Sam planted it in the fireplace, just like he put it in my bed before. He is trying to get me in trouble.",
        "Jack: Did I tell you you're doing a good job of that yourself? Upstairs. Go. Now.",
        "Carly: What are we going to do?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure.",
        "Carly: We can't let Parker get in more trouble.",
        "Jack: We won't. I think I know how to fix this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: Sofie Duran, life and times. All the good it'll do.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, there's nothing here. There's no phone numbers -- there's no references, there's --",
        "Manager: That's what I was trying to tell you.",
        "Aaron: So the cops don't have anything to go on either.",
        "Manager: Not unless they saw something in that file that you didn't.",
        "Aaron: All right. Well, back to square one.",
        "Manager: I'm sorry, man.",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: It's not the emerald city, is it, Baby? But that's okay. That's okay, we're not going to be here very long. But as long as we have each other, right? Right, I'm just gonna -- I'm just gonna see how much money we have left. Okay. Okay. Where's my wallet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, listen to me. Going to Chicago isn't going -- isn't going to help to find Hallie. You guys are too emotionally involved in this. Even if you do track down Sofie, you might scare her off.",
        "Will: Margo, what do you think we should do?",
        "Margo: Come back home. Let the police handle it.",
        "Will: Maybe she's right. Maybe we should leave the search to the cops and just go home.",
        "Gwen: No. No, Will, please. The police are never going to look as hard as we are.",
        "Will: Gwen, what if she's right? What if we accidentally make things worse?",
        "Gwen: We're not going to. Please, I keep thinking about Billy. That if I'd taken better care of myself, he might be alive right now. I didn't do everything I could to keep Billy with me. I have to do everything I can to find Hallie. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I lost all our money baby girl. What are we supposed to do? I know, I know, I know. It's cold and you're tired. I know, I know -- I know, I know, I know.",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "Sofie: Oh no, please don't cry.",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Aaron: Sofie?",
        "Sofie: I need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Come on. Hey, Aaron didn't call.",
        "Will: Well, he probably just hasn't found anything out yet.",
        "Gwen: He said he'd call after he got a look at Sofie's file.",
        "Will: Look, don't worry about it. Once he finds out anything about Sofie or Hallie, he'll call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I'll help you, Sofie. Okay? No problem. Just tell me where you are.",
        "Sofie: Promise -- promise you won't tell Gwen and Will where I am. Promise! Or I am going to hang up right now!",
        "Aaron: I promise. Are you guys okay?",
        "Sofie: I don't know. I don't know. [Hallie crying] I think -- I think maybe she's -- she's hungry and cold. And maybe she needs a diaper changing. I know how to take care of her. I know I can. I just lost all my money and --",
        "Aaron: It's okay. Okay? I have money. We'll help you and Hallie. Whatever you need, okay? Just tell me where you are.",
        "Sofie: I'm in New York City.",
        "Aaron: Where can I meet you?",
        "Sofie: I'm in Churchill Park near a conservatory pond. It's cold. Please, come right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: We've been out here a long time, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: I'm not giving up.",
        "Will: I'm not asking you to give up. I'm just asking you to consider what Margo said. We should go home.",
        "Gwen: No. Hallie needs us.",
        "Will: What happens if Sofie goes back to Oakdale, and the cops find Hallie? She's going to need her mom and dad there for her. Hallie wants us to go back. She needs us to go back. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker's latest trick.",
        "Carly: We don't know how we're supposed to react to this.",
        "Dr. Seidman: Well, I'm glad you called to fill me in. It seems like Parker's acting out has reached a new level.",
        "Carly: Well, we've been trying to hold our ground. Not giving in to him.",
        "Jack: This is the result.",
        "Dr. Seidman: Well, to start with, I do think we should increase the frequency of Parker's therapy sessions. Although that's not the most important thing we can do for him right now.",
        "Carly: Well, what should we do then? Because we would do anything. You know that.",
        "Dr. Seidman: Well, in my opinion, what Parker needs now more than anything is to spending more time with the two of you.",
        "Carly: Well, we're working on that. I mean, Jack has cut his hours at the station. I wanted Parker to come and work with me at the club. We're making sure that he gets as much one-on-one time with both of us as possible.",
        "Dr. Seidman: Both of you together or separately? I mean, what Parker needs now is to spending time with you and Jack together. And his brother. And his sister. As a family. Security is the big issue for Parker right now. The more secure he feels the less likely he is to act out. If it's okay, I'm going to go upstairs and hear what Parker has to say.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Dr. Seidman: You two talk it over. And see what you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I'm begging you. Please. Just go. You will not be able to think straight if I'm afraid that you're in danger. And I really need to think straight right now. Please. Go sit. I need to take care of a few things in the barn. I'll be back in a few minutes.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Lily: Hello?",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Gregory! It's Lucinda Walsh. Hey, I hope my favorite banker isn't too tied up to help me out with a life-saving favor.",
        "Lily: Mother, I think you dialed the wrong number? It's Lily.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Gregory, a man can't be so hostage to his daily routine that he can't help out a friend in dire straits.",
        "Lily: What's wrong? Are you in trouble?",
        "Lucinda: That's exactly right.",
        "Lily: You just tell me what I need to do.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I'm so happy you understand. Yes, this is what I need. I need $10 million, in cash, and it's to be delivered to me, here at Memorial hospital in Room 408. That's just wonderful that you understand. This is a matter of life and death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Dr. Seidman is right. We need to do whatever we can to help Parker no matter what it takes.",
        "Jack: So we spend -- we spend more time together as a family.",
        "Carly: Right. I think spending more time with you and the kids will be great.",
        "Jack: Then why do you seem a million miles away? What's going on, Carly?",
        "Carly: Nothing, I'm -- I'm just thinking -- if I want to do it right, if I want to focus 100% on my family, then I can't let anything distract me. So I have to give up Metro.",

        "Lucinda: Hi, Honey.",
        "Lily: Hey!",
        "Lucinda: What are you doing here in the hospital? Are you bringing in little Ethan for a check-up or something?",
        "Lily: You called me. You said something about $10 million? Why would you need $10 million?",
        "Lucinda: I think they're paging you at the desk, Darling. I heard them paging you. Why don't you go and find out what it's all about?",
        "Lily: What is going on?",
        "Lucinda: Please, Darling. Please.",
        "Lily: What kind of trouble are you in? What's going on?",
        "Lucinda: Please! Sweetheart, Lily -- I wanted you to go for help. I didn't want you to be here.",
        "Lily: Dusty? He killed Dusty?",
        "Lucinda: Yes. Yes, he did. Honey, why don't you ever, ever listen to a thing I say?",
        "Lily: Why would Evan kill Dusty? He didn't even know him. Did he? Did he know him?",
        "Lucinda: The three men stood in the way between Dr. Schweitzer, and his research project and his organ playing.",
        "Evan: Don't make fun of me, Lucinda. My work will revolutionize medicine.",
        "Lily: So it was all you? Right from the start?",
        "Evan: Well, I mean, it wasn't all me. Not right from the start. Right, Grandma?",
        "Lucinda: I had nothing to do with killings.",
        "Evan: Oh, she's being modest.",
        "Lily: What is he talking about?",
        "Lucinda: Don't listen to him. He's a lunatic.",
        "Evan: Your mother may not have been the one who poisoned Bob, or killed Dusty, or Neil Perkins. But she was the one who tapped me for a little assignment right here in Oakdale, several months back. And she was the one who told me to do everything necessary to make sure it was carried out.",

        "Carly: I did this. I have to fix it.",
        "Jack: No, we have to fix it.",
        "Carly: It's up to me, Jack. I'm going to start by getting rid of Metro.",
        "Jack: You don't want to do that? You put so much time and money into the place.",
        "Carly: None of that matters compared to my son. I'll do anything for him. I'll take this back to Sam. I'll let him know what my plans are. And he and Kit will just have to understand.",

        "Sofie: I think she's hungry. I ran out of milk, and I don't have any money left.",
        "Aaron: That okay. There's a pharmacy around the corner. We'll get some formula, warm you up, then we're going to head home.",
        "Sofie: No, you promised you wouldn't tell Gwen and Will where I am.",
        "Aaron: I didn't tell them. But the cops are after you. Taking Hallie, that wasn't cool. You're in a lot of trouble right now.",
        "Sofie: I know, that's why I can't go back!",
        "Aaron: It's okay. It's okay. I know how we can fix it. Okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: The last time Hallie wore this, it was tight on her. If we ever get her back, she'll be too big.",
        "Will: Gwen, we're going to get her back.",
        "Gwen: How do you know that? Honestly, how do you know? Because I'm running out of ideas.",
        "Will: Hold on. Wait right here. I've got something for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Listen, Aaron, thank you, thank you for the money, you really came through for us. But I have a plan. Hallie and I are going to go to Canada. The police won't be able to find us there.",
        "Aaron: You realize what you're doing is kidnapping.",
        "Sofie: She's my baby!",
        "Aaron: Sofie, if you bring her back to Oakdale, you can change your mind about the adoption. Okay, it'll be perfectly legal then. Listen, I got tickets. I've got plane tickets back to Oakdale, okay? We go home, we tell the cops that you meant no harm. Okay? Bringing Hallie will be, like, will be like a show of good faith. You know? Proof to everybody that you want what's best for your child. Okay? Here's the plane tickets. You go home, then you can decide whatever you want to do. I'll be there. Okay, I'll be there to help you. What do you say?",

        "Lily: You brought Evan to Oakdale? Dusty is dead!",
        "Lucinda: Honey, Dusty's dead.",
        "Lily: He was working for you?",
        "Lucinda: All I wanted was my company back. I wanted Craig out! I wanted to discredit him with the board of directors. That science project was meant to fail!",
        "Evan: Well, then you picked the wrong man.",
        "Lucinda: Well, obviously, I did! I didn't know you were a lunatic like the rest of your God-forsaken family! I would have saved myself a lot of trouble if I had!",
        "Lily: Trouble? You think this is just a little trouble?",
        "Lucinda: I didn't know what the kid was going to do.",

        "Lucinda: It's Holden --",
        "Lily: It probably is Holden. If you don't let me talk to him, then he's going to come looking for me.",
        "Evan: All right. Answer it. Get rid of him.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lucinda: Me? Okay. All right. Yeah, hi, Holden.",
        "Holden: I'm trying to find Lily. Is she with you?",

        "Holden: Nat said she got a call from you before she left the house.",
        "Lucinda: Um, did she? Well, you know, it was just a motherly telephone call. You know how it is. We cannot be too careful these days. And I was thinking about her health.",

        "Evan: It's time for me to get out of here. Which means it's time for the two of you to finally serve your purpose.",

        "Lily: Don't -- no, no.",
        "Evan: It looks like I'm going to have to get my cash some other way.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Hey! It's done. It's done. Let's go. You and me -- we're going to take a walk. We're going to take a walk to Oakdale Mutual. And she stays here. And we go.",
        "Evan: Oh, we go?",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Evan: Right. Right, I leave Lily behind, and she goes running to the cops. Forget it.",
        "Lucinda: All right then, fine, she can go. I'll stay here. I'll stay here with you, and she goes.",
        "Evan: So that she can get lost and end up at the police station? Is this really your best effort?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, it's best because you'll have me! You'll have me as a hostage. And a reason for my daughter to come back!",
        "Evan: Seeing how much your daughter despises your role in our little plan here, who's to say she'll be in the mood to follow through. No, no, no, ladies, you know what they say? One hostage is good, two is even better. So we are going to stay right here, and figure out a way to make the money come to us.",

        "Holden: Margo, something's happened to Lily. I'm afraid that she might be in danger. You have to help me find her.",

        "Evan: To whom?",
        "Lily: To Holden. Because he's the only who can get us the money. It's our only option.",
        "Evan: All right call him. But try anything clever, and mommy dearest gets her booster shot!",
        "Lily: Holden, it's me.",
        "Holden: Lily, thank God. Where are you?",
        "Lily: Just listen. Don't -- don't say anything. I need you to do something very important. I need $10 million in cash.",
        "Evan: Unmarked bills.",
        "Lily: Unmarked bills. Bring it to Memorial hospital, Room 408. And don't tell anyone.",
        "Holden: Will do.",
        "Margo: Was that Lily?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, she's fine. False alarm.",
        "Margo: Oh, good. Good. Glad to hear it.",
        "Holden: Sorry to bother you. Have a good day.",
        "Margo: You, too. I need a plainclothes policeman to follow Holden Snyder, ASAP. He just left the building.",

        "Carly: We'll pay for the repairs, of course. And Sam, I know that you probably are really tired of hearing me say this, but I am so sorry.",
        "Sam: No harm done. A little sandpaper, some paint, varnish, and old cowboy will be as good as new.",
        "Carly: Good, well I'm really glad to hear you say that. Because Kit is going to need you and Cowboy Jack to keep pitching in around here.",
        "Sam: Carly, we'll always be here to help you.",
        "Carly: Well, unfortunately, Sam, it's going to have to just be you and Kit from now on. I have to give up Metro. For Parker's sake.",

        "Parker: Sure. Just like last time.",
        "Jack: Hey, your mother was willing to fire Sam. And Kit threatened to go with him if she did. This time she's giving up her interest in the club altogether.",
        "Parker: So, she won't see Sam anymore?",
        "Jack: Your mother loves you, Parker. She's giving up something she worked really hard on, so you'll understand that you're her first priority.",
        "Parker: Whatever. I've got homework.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: His therapist thinks that Jack and I need to be there for Parker a lot more than we have been. I don't want this to be a problem for you and Kit. I really don't.",
        "Sam: Sounds like you're the one with the problem. How're you going to give up this club?",
        "Carly: I guess I have to try to find somebody to buy me out. And if I can't, I lose the money. My son comes first.",
        "Sam: Are you sure about this?",

        "Sofie: Go tell her she's fine. Go tell them she is with her mother.",
        "Aaron: I am going to tell them that you took good care of her, and that you love her. But you have to send Hallie back to them.",
        "Sofie: Can't it wait? Just one night. Just one more night and I can give Hallie a bath, and I can dress her in her little PJs, and I can pretend everything's fine. Just one more night for me and my baby. Please? And then I will do anything you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, this says six to nine months.",
        "Will: I bought it a couple of weeks ago. I was hiding it for a surprise.",
        "Gwen: Why are you giving it to me now?",
        "Will: To prove to you how sure I am that by next summer all three of us are going to be at the beach. And Hallie's going to be splashing in the water, trying to eat the sand and everyone's going to be telling us what a cute little girl we have.",
        "Gwen: I love you for believing that. I really do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry. But I can't let Gwen and Will keep worrying about this. It's time to go back, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: You're right. You're right. What was I thinking? Where am I supposed to give her a bath and put her to sleep? I have no place to stay. We're going to come back with you. And Hallie can sleep in her crib tonight. And Will and Gwen won't have to worry anymore.",
        "Aaron: Great. Good.",
        "Sofie: Here let me -- let me just go over to the restroom and I'll change her, and then we can go. Okay, I will be right over there. I promise.",

        "Gwen: Okay, tell Hallie that we love her. And that we can't wait to see her. Will and I are going to go to the airport. And then we're going to get on a flight.",
        "Aaron: Listen, you don't have to do that. We have tickets on the next flight to Oakdale.",

        "Carly: It doesn't matter. If it's what Parker needs, it's what I'll do.",
        "Jack: You're not alone. We're doing it together.",
        "Carly: Right. But don't worry, I know, even though you're saying that we're together, that you don't mean together. I won't get my hopes up.",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, hey -- we're still a family.",
        "Carly: Thanks for saying that. And I won't do anything to jeopardize it again.",

        "Cowboy Jack: This really burns me up.",
        "Sam: Funny, you ought to be a comedian.",
        "Cowboy Jack: I'm serious. You can't let Carly quit. If you really want to be with that pretty lady, you got to get her away from that bratty kid. Once and for all.",
