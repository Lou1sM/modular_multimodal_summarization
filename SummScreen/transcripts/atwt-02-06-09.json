        "Matt gets in the middle of a spat between Alison and Casey. She finally explains why she had Matt fake the kiss at the park. Matt implores Jade to give Alison and Casey a chance. She has an attitude and questions why he would even care. Casey feels Alison is doing a 180 on him when she insists on just being friends. Dusty is livid that the police can not trace Josie's call or the car. Security questions Paul of how and why he slipped past the front desk when he's not supposed to be there at the studio. He tells Josie that she can go home; she should not be punished for what he did. Later Dusty's P.I, picks up the car in Brooklyn and he tells Meg he is heading to New York. She argues that he should let Jack and the police follow the leads and not interfere and make this worse. He agrees to her face, but then calls for the jet to be ready to go to New York. Paul calls Meg just to tell her that Eliza is safe and he is bringing her back. Paul gives Josie a big wad of money to keep her afloat until she can get her career going. Luke is sick and tired of everything being talked to death and not spontaneous with Noah. Holden hopes Meg is still speaking to him for giving his views about her marrying Dusty. Jade apologizes to Casey for interfering with the Alison situation. Alison explains to Matt that she and Casey need to grow up, it didn't work out between them. Dusty catches up with Josie and demands to know where Paul and the baby are. Holden comforts Meg and is happy about her news that Paul is returning Eliza. When his back is turned, Paul is hit over the head with a baseball bat and the man takes off with Eliza in the car."

        "Alison: Hey!",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.",

        "Casey: Who's talking?",
        "Alison: You just spoke to me.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. I blocked it out after you cut me to ribbons.",
        "Alison: You know, you really need to grow up.",
        "Casey: Yeah? Why don't you try it?",
        "Matt: You know what? You're both right.",

        "Paul: I think we're out of formula.",
        "Josie: And how are we going to get more?",
        "Paul: I don't know. We could go to the store.",
        "Josie: Uh, don't you think that might be a little dangerous?",
        "Paul: You think they've put our wanted posters up in the supermarket aisles?",
        "Josie: Paul, we're fugitives on the run with an infant child. Who knows what they're going to do?",
        "Paul: Right. They're going to turn us into a TV movie.",
        "Josie: How can you be joking about this?",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, I'm having the time of my life.",
        "Josie: Really?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Josie: Hiding with your daughter in a TV studio --",
        "Paul: With my daughter. That's the truth. You have no idea how long I waited to be a father.",
        "Josie: Well, I know that you and Meg lost a baby.",
        "Paul: Yeah, it wasn't the first time I lost a baby, either. No one should have to live through that.",
        "Josie: Well, I'm glad you have this time with her now.",
        "Paul: Thanks to you.",
        "Josie: I just wish that you and Meg could've figured out a way to do this together.",
        "Paul: Your boyfriend made sure that's never going to happen.",
        "Josie: I wish you would stop calling him that. Dusty is not my boyfriend. If he were, I wouldn't be here and neither would you.",
        "Paul: He would have figured out another way to screw up my life, though. He always does.",
        "Josie: Yeah, well -- anyway, if we're going to get that formula, we should probably go before --",
        "Paul: Shh, shh, shh.",

        "Casey: Look, Dude, I don't need your advice, but maybe your girlfriend here does.",
        "Alison: You know what? Don't bother trying to explain, Matt. Just do yourself a favor and don't get in the middle of this.",
        "Matt: Because you two are dealing with this so well by yourselves?",
        "Casey: There's nothing to deal with.",
        "Alison: That's right.",
        "Matt: It's obvious you need help.",
        "Casey: Well, not from you.",
        "Matt: I'm the reason you're not talking to each other.",
        "Alison: No, you're not.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's not your fault that you can only score on girls that are desperate.",
        "Alison: Go to hell!",
        "Casey: Oh, the truth hurts, Babe.",
        "Matt: I was not trying to score with anybody.",
        "Casey: Oh, did I get this backwards?",
        "Alison: Okay, this conversation is over.",
        "Matt: Wait -- wait a minute.",
        "Alison: I have to get to work and so does he.",
        "Matt: Then why don't you save yourself some time by cutting the crap? If you don't tell him, I will.",
        "Casey: Tell me what?",
        "Matt: Come on, Ali.",
        "Alison: Leave it alone, Matt.",
        "Matt: I can't do that. That kiss that you saw in the park? Is totally fake.",

        "Dusty: Josie's call came in hours ago. You guys still don't know where she is?",
        "Cop #1: We didn't have time to set up a trace.",
        "Dusty: Well, what about the car? Have you located the car?",
        "Cop #2: We put the VIN out on the national bolo. And the Amber Alert on the baby, but no hits yet.",
        "Dusty: Is that all you do? Wait around for a hit?",
        "Meg: Okay, Dusty --",
        "Cop #2: We'll keep you posted, Ma'am.",
        "Dusty: You're walking away from the lady you're supposed to help.",
        "Meg: Hey --",
        "Holden: Hey, do you want to tell me what you're doing?",
        "Dusty: I'm motivating these guys.",
        "Holden: They're not in charge of the investigation. Jack is.",
        "Dusty: And where's Jack?",
        "Holden: He's working on a lead.",
        "Meg: How do you know that?",
        "Holden: Because he told me.",

        "Dusty: He should tell Meg --",
        "Holden: He told me because I'm family. You're not.",
        "Dusty: So what?",
        "Holden: So? This, none of this, is any of your business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Uh, we are extras. And we were here the other day and they asked us to come back to shoot some more scenes.",
        "Security guard: Your scenes are later this afternoon.",
        "Paul: Well, the baby kind of freaked out the first time because of all the noise and the lights and stuff. And the producer thought it would be a really good idea to come in early, you know, to get acclimated. You know how movie actors can be --",
        "Security guard: Anyone authorize some extras to come in early?",
        "Paul: It was the producer, the old guy -- do you remember his name?",
        "Josie: No.",
        "Security guard: Explain why the desk never checked you in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Ali saw you coming. She asked me to kiss her. That's all it was.",
        "Casey: Is that true? Why -- why would you do that?",
        "Alison: What's the difference?",
        "Casey: It makes no freaking sense. That's the difference.",
        "Alison: Okay, well, I don't have time to explain it to you.",
        "Matt: Make time.",
        "Alison: Leave me alone.",
        "Matt: Don't do this, Ali. Just tell him what you told me.",
        "Alison: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Matt: I think that there is.",
        "Alison: I don't care what you think.",
        "Matt: Just tell him.",
        "Alison: Haven't you done enough damage?",
        "Casey: Come on, Ali, just -- let's go up to the roof and talk about this.",
        "Alison: Yeah, 'cause that worked out so well last time.",
        "Casey: I didn't know you were up there. Jade never told me.",
        "Alison: It doesn't matter.",
        "Casey: Can you just please level with me?",
        "Alison: I know Jade never told you. I don't care.",
        "Matt: It won't hurt you to talk, Ali.",
        "Casey: Five minutes. Please?",
        "Alison: I'll deal with you later. Let's go.",
        "Casey: Thanks, man.",
        "Matt: This is your shot. Don't blow it.",
        "Casey: I won't.",
        "Matt: Nice morning, isn't it?",
        "Nurse: It is now.",
        "Jade: Excuse me, I'm looking for Casey Hughes. They said he was working on this floor.",
        "Nurse: Oh, he just went up the stairs.",
        "Jade: Thanks.",
        "Matt: Why are you looking for Casey?",
        "Jade: Excuse me?",
        "Matt: He's busy right now.",
        "Jade: Doing what?",
        "Matt: It's personal business. You probably shouldn't wait around.",
        "Jade: Oh, if it's so personal, why do you know so much about it? And who are you to tell me what to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Listen, listen, if you are straight with me right now, I will never, ever ask you again.",
        "Alison: What do you want to know?",
        "Casey: Why did you kiss Matt when I got to the park?",
        "Alison: I told you. I was angry at you for blowing me off when I was up here.",
        "Casey: But you're not angry now.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Casey: And the whole thing between you and Matt --",
        "Alison: He just did me a favor.",
        "Casey: Well, remind me to thank him.",
        "Alison: Well, he got us up here, didn't he? So, let's cut him some slack.",
        "Casey: Okay. I will, if you promise you're not angry at me anymore.",
        "Alison: I'm not. So -- let's get to why you're angry at me.",
        "Casey: Because of the park. Seeing you all over Matt when you keep saying \"No\" to me all the time.",
        "Alison: It wasn't real.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know that now. And yes, I am cool with that.",
        "Alison: You know, I'm surprised you weren't suspicious of it in the first place.",
        "Casey: How was I supposed to know?",
        "Alison: How about the fact that I hardly know Matt?",
        "Casey: You went out with him before.",
        "Alison: Once. And he's been in prison since then. You think I'd just jump on him the minute I saw him?",
        "Casey: No, no. I guess you're right. I should've thought that through a little more.",
        "Alison: You should've.",
        "Casey: I guess that's what I'm not really good at.",
        "Alison: Okay, I thought we came up here because we were going to be straight with each other.",
        "Casey: I am.",
        "Alison: Then you need to drop the whole cute, \"Gosh, I'm such a doofus\" thing.",
        "Casey: I didn't know that's what it was.",
        "Alison: There it is again.",
        "Casey: Okay, I'm sorry, it's subconscious. Sorry.",
        "Alison: Well, save it for someone who actually needs it. 'Cause you don't need it with me.",
        "Casey: Okay. Can I ask you a question?",
        "Alison: Sure.",
        "Casey: Why'd you let Luke convince you to come up here in the first place?",
        "Alison: Why do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Nobody knows what Meg is going through better than me.",
        "Holden: You know what -- we appreciate your sympathy. But we do not need your help.",
        "Meg: Okay, that's enough.",
        "Holden: Meg --",
        "Meg: If anyone, anyone at all, wants to help me get Eliza back, then I'm not going to push them away. She is the only thing that matters to me right now. And as long as she comes home, I don't care who gets the credit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: Okay, what's the plan?",
        "Paul: We need to get out of New York City. 'Cause if those security guards call the cops, and those cops have spoken to Oakdale Pd, they could put it all together -- figure out we're here.",
        "Josie: Where do we go?",
        "Paul: Well, I'm thinking Florida.",
        "Josie: Florida?",
        "Paul: Yeah, at least it's warm.",
        "Josie: We could be more noticeable?",
        "Paul: No, no, come on, we'll be a family on vacation. What's the big deal?",
        "Josie: Okay, okay, but one week, including driving time.",
        "Paul: Fine, play in the sand until my time is up.",
        "Josie: Okay. What, what --",
        "Paul: Where's the car?",
        "Josie: It was right here.",
        "Paul: So, where the hell is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: I'm an old friend of Casey's. Who are you?",
        "Jade: I'm a friend of Casey's, too.",
        "Matt: I don't remember you from the last time I was here.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I don't remember you, either. So why don't you just bug off and leave me alone.",
        "Matt: You can't see him right now. He's busy.",
        "Jade: With what?",
        "Matt: His girlfriend.",
        "Jade: And what girlfriend is that?",
        "Matt: If you don't know, you must not be as close to Casey as you thought.",
        "Jade: Oh, I'm close enough.",
        "Matt: Then I'm sure he'll tell you all about it, later.",
        "Jade: They're on the roof, aren't they?",
        "Matt: You're not going up there.",
        "Jade: What are you going to do, stop me?",
        "Matt: Seriously? I'm not kidding about this.",
        "Jade: What are you, Alison's big brother or something?",
        "Matt: So then, you do know.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I told you we were friends.",
        "Matt: Just friends? You're not hot for him?",
        "Jade: No. Why, are you?",
        "Matt: It's funny. Casey's a good man, we've been through a lot together. And I owe him.",
        "Jade: For what?",
        "Matt: It's a long story.",
        "Jade: Yeah, you'll have to tell me all about it next time we chat.",
        "Matt: I think I'll tell you about it right now. Someplace else.",
        "Jade: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Matt: You look like you could use some coffee. On me.",
        "Jade: Let go of me!",
        "Matt: I'm sorry, I'm just not going to take \"No\" for an answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You still didn't answer the question.",
        "Alison: Do I have to spell it out for you?",
        "Casey: Well, that would make it easier, yeah.",
        "Alison: I was up here because I thought, you know -- you and I could work things out.",
        "Casey: Because you're into me.",
        "Alison: 'Cause we see each other all the time and I thought we should try to find a way to get along.",
        "Casey: Because you're into me.",
        "Alison: Do you really need me to say it?",
        "Casey: It would help.",
        "Alison: I thought I might be.",
        "Casey: Into me?",
        "Alison: Yes, okay! What is wrong with you?",
        "Casey: No, what -- what is wrong with us? Look, look, I mean. You want it to happen, I want it to happen. So why isn't it happening?",
        "Alison: Well, I'm not going to just like rip off my clothes and throw myself at you, Casey.",
        "Casey: That -- that is not what I meant.",
        "Alison: But that's what you're used to?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Alison: Well, guess what. You know, sometimes you have to work for it.",
        "Casey: I've been working my butt off. It's not like you've been easy.",
        "Alison: Well, excuse me for not being easy.",
        "Casey: No, listen, why do you keep turning around everything I'm saying?",
        "Alison: I'm not.",
        "Casey: I just don't understand why this keeps happening.",
        "Alison: Isn't it obvious?",
        "Casey: No, not to me.",
        "Alison: We don't work together.",
        "Casey: How can you say that? We've been having so much fun these past few months.",
        "Alison: As friends. Which is probably all we should be.",
        "Casey: But, I think we could be more than friends.",
        "Alison: I don't know, Case. You know -- you want simple and easy. And I am not that.",
        "Casey: You don't think I could do complicated? I dated your sister, remember?",
        "Alison: Thank you for reminding me.",
        "Casey: Yes, yeah, that probably wasn't the best thing to say right now. I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Considering how that ended for you, do you really want to jump back into the same gene pool?",
        "Casey: Okay, listen, can we just skip the whole \"Curse of the Stewart women\" here? It's just hard enough as it is.",
        "Alison: Which is exactly my point. I am not what you need.",
        "Casey: Let me decide that for myself.",
        "Alison: I just -- I don't think you're being objective here.",
        "Casey: You know what this is beginning to sound like?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Casey: Like you're trying not to say what you feel. Like maybe I'm not what you need.",
        "Alison: Maybe that's true. Maybe you're not. Maybe it's true for both of us.",
        "Casey: But, instead of being afraid, how about we take a chance and find out?",
        "Alison: I don't know if I could be the girlfriend you want me to be.",
        "Casey: You can be the girlfriend you want to be. The real question is, do you want to?",
        "Alison: What do you want?",
        "Casey: Right now?",
        "Alison: Yeah. And be honest.",
        "Casey: I want to jump your bones.",
        "Alison: Which just proves why this is never going to happen.",

        "Noah: What is it?",
        "Luke: Oh, no, no, no you don't.",
        "Noah: Oh, come on, it's only a week away.",
        "Luke: What is?",
        "Noah: Please. You order me a Valentine's Day gift? Obviously.",
        "Luke: You think you're so smart, don't you?",
        "Noah: I do. I bet I know what it is. It's the film noir collection that just came out on DVD --",
        "Luke: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, not even close.",
        "Noah: You didn't buy me that gray Jacket, did you?",
        "Luke: What gray Jacket?",
        "Noah: You know, the one we saw on that guy in the restaurant. Do you listen to anything I say?",
        "Luke: Well, when you're looking at some other guy, no, I don't.",
        "Noah: Not the guy, the Jacket.",
        "Luke: Don't worry, I did not get you a Jacket.",
        "Noah: So, what is it?",
        "Luke: It is -- a listing.",
        "Noah: A listing?",
        "Luke: Feast your ears on this. Unique one bedroom, one bath, with views of the park. Exposed brick, working fireplace, walk-in closet, eat-in kitchen. I mean, is that an apartment, or is that an apartment?",
        "Noah: Uh -- that depends.",
        "Luke: On money? Noah, you wouldn't guess how cheap it is.",
        "Noah: Luke, who is this apartment supposed to be for?",

        "Dusty: No, it's 'cause Paul's insane!",
        "Holden: Yeah, he is. So why would you ever do anything else to provoke him?",
        "Meg: This was not Dusty's fault!",
        "Holden: Everything he touches blows up in someone else's face. Is that what you want, for you?",
        "Dusty: It won't. It won't happen to her.",
        "Holden: You know what? Why don't you just take your track record and go help someone else? We'll let you know when it's all over.",

        "Meg: I don't know. But why shouldn't we let him try?",

        "Josie: I don't think so.",
        "Paul: Why not?",
        "Josie: It's an alternate side of the street parking. It was probably towed, not stolen.",

        "Holden: Meg, your decisions have consequences. Not just for you. But for your daughter.",
        "Meg: I know that.",

        "Matt: You okay? I just saw Casey. He told me it didn't work out.",
        "Alison: I told you it wouldn't.",
        "Matt: So what's the problem?",
        "Alison: You actually said it before. We both need to grow up.",
        "Matt: But that's why I think you guys are right for each other.",
        "Alison: Well, somebody has to be the grown-up. And neither of us knows how.",
        "Matt: There's a lot more to it than that.",
        "Alison: And you know this how?",
        "Matt: Well, prison gives you a lot of time to think. What you did wrong, how you screwed up your life, how you wrecked your relationships. You can really get to understand why you do what you do. And then you realize a lot of that works the same way for other people.",
        "Alison: Well, I guess it's cheaper than a psych degree.",
        "Matt: I've actually been thinking about doing that. Going back to school.",
        "Alison: You should. It helped me get over some big mistakes I made.",
        "Matt: You're not over the yet.",
        "Alison: What do you know about it?",
        "Matt: I don't mean to insult you. It's just, I think that's what keeps getting between you guys. The past. Everybody's got one. But, the trick is to keep it from screwing up the future.",
        "Alison: Well, that is a trick I haven't mastered yet.",
        "Matt: Yeah, me neither. That's why I'm thinking school might help.",
        "Alison: Well, it might if you're serious. By the way, if I don't want to flunk out myself, I have to get back to work.",
        "Matt: What are you going to do about Casey?",
        "Alison: Nothing. It's over.",

        "Luke: Yeah, but I should have thought it through first.",
        "Noah: Yeah, especially of the how we pay the rent part.",
        "Luke: Well, if that's the issue, I'm pretty sure my parents will help us --",
        "Noah: No, no, Luke. When we get our own place, I want it to be truly ours. You know, I want us to split the rent. You know, equal share, 50/50.",
        "Luke: That sounds so good.",
        "Noah: Which part?",
        "Luke: You said when we get our own apartment. You didn't say if, you said when.",
        "Noah: That's 'cause it's going to happen.",
