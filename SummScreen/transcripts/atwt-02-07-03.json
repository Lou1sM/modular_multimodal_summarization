        "Bartleby: What do I have to do to convince you I mean business? I mean, be a bloody shame to have to harm one of God's gorgeous, fuzzy, little creatures, but -- I will if I have to. Do I have to, Simon?",
        "Simon: No. No. I know you're serious.",
        "Bartleby: Then no worries, mate. The rabbit gets to live, and so does your wife. Or not.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Simon: What are you doing home so early?",
        "Katie: Well, checkups are quick when you're healthy. This must be your friend from back home?",
        "Bartleby: Ma'am, the pleasure is mine.",
        "Katie: Simon, aren't you gonna introduce us?",
        "Bartleby: You must be the little missus. Simon, you slight. You've been holding out on me. She's far lovelier than you led on, you old so and so.",
        "Katie: Oh, I like him already. And Snickers likes you, too. Mr. --",
        "Bartleby: Shears. Bartleby Shears at your service. Simon's old mate from years ago. I'm sure he goes on and on about me. Damn glad to meet you, Mrs. Frasier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: Is all of this absolutely necessary?",
        "Evelyn: It's your call, detective.",
        "Margo: Uncuff Mr. Travers.",
        "Marshall: Thank you, Detective Hughes. Evelyn, don't you think arresting me in the hospital and dragging me here in cuffs smacks of overkill? I am cognizant of the charges, aware of the process, and -- and willing to cooperate.",
        "Evelyn: Well, good. I'm hoping you'll be even more cooperative after spending the night behind bars.",
        "Jessica: You're not gonna lock him up. There's no way in hell I'm gonna let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Aaron.",
        "Burt: Well, look at what the cat dragged in.",
        "Alison: I was just telling Burt how you went in search of the timing belt. Telling him you were on business. Well, I guess since you're empty-handed, then --",
        "Aaron: Yeah, yeah. I think they're expecting a shipment sometime today, so I'm gonna drop by later on.",
        "Burt: It's a timing belt, people, not the end of the world. Now, get back to work.",
        "Aaron: Thanks a lot.",
        "Alison: No sweat. Second nature.",
        "Aaron: That's all I need today, to lose my job, too.",
        "Alison: \"Too\"? What happened with Lucy?",
        "Aaron: Well, I tried to talk to her, but she wouldn't listen. She doesn't want to see me anymore.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, Aaron. I was hoping that you would change her mind or something.",
        "Aaron: No you weren't, but forget it. Now, I don't want to talk about this to you or anybody else. I'm gonna get changed. I'll be right back.",
        "Alison: Take your time. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Ah, all for me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that depends. Do you mean me or the sandwiches?",
        "Craig: Oh, I mean all.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, you always do. How's Lucy?",
        "Craig: She doesn't want to talk much after that thing with Aaron. I was hoping maybe you could use some of your womanly wiles to get her to open up.",
        "Rosanna: You know, you can't rush these things. When she needs me, she'll come to me. Do you want some lunch?",
        "Craig: No. Mallory called.",
        "Rosanna: Mallory?",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: You mean the publicist from Monte Carlo? What does she want? Her severance pay?",
        "Craig: No, no, Vanities magazine wants to run a spread on some of Carly's designs. She's been trying to keep them off as long as possible, but the editor's beginning to suspect something is up. She's -- she's trying, but she can't keep it up much longer.",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's quite the quandary.",
        "Craig: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: Is Carly still the chief designer for Monte Carlo?",
        "Craig: Yeah, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Rosanna: Well, how about as far as Carly's concerned?",
        "Craig: Well, she doesn't have anything better going on in her life at the moment.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, except for an illegitimate child, and a husband and ex-lover and cousin who wish her dead. Other than that --",
        "Craig: Yes, yes, you're right. She has nothing going on in her life at the moment, so she might as well sketch. Huh? Listen, Monte Carlo is going to be one of the many jewels in your crown.",
        "Rosanna: Mm. Well, for the conquering hero, one for the road.",
        "Craig: Ah, I shall return.",
        "Rosanna: Good luck. Well, what do you say, bear? I personally loathe eating alone. Shall we chow down and perhaps hibernate? No?",
        "Lucy: Rosanna, did my father leave?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, hi. Yes, just a minute ago. You just missed him.",
        "Lucy: Good. Actually -- I need to know something, but you can't tell my dad.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. What's on your mind?",
        "Lucy: It's kind of private. Okay, well, I was kind of wondering -- how do you tell if you're not a virgin anymore?",

        "[Paper rustling]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Mike: Hang on. Keep your shirt on.",
        "Molly: Don't worry. From now on, that's exactly what I intend to do, especially around you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartleby: Nice place you've got here. Any little ones yet?",
        "Katie: No, not yet.",
        "Bartleby: Oh, pity.",
        "Katie: Well, that could be changing any minute.",
        "Bartleby: Oh, nothing quite like young love, is there? Every moment's just ripe with possibilities.",
        "Katie: So you guys know each other a long time?",
        "Bartleby: Oh, Simon's my favorite old drinking buddy from years back until some beautiful Sheila domesticated him.",
        "Katie: Oh, he's not that domesticated. Actually, if you guys want a guys' night out, then I'm totally cool with it. I think wives should be understanding about those things, don't you?",
        "Bartleby: Well, aren't you just as sweet as sugar?",
        "Simon: Actually, Bart was leaving when you got here, honey. So why don't I walk you out to the car and we can discuss that business on the way?",
        "Katie: Business?",
        "Bartleby: Oh, it's -- it's kind of embarrassing to talk about, actually. I was in Chicago, and I ran short on funds. Then I remembered the mate was out here conquering the wild Midwest, and he was good enough to float me a fifty till the missus can squeeze some through the wire.",
        "Katie: Oh. Simon. We can do better than a fifty.",
        "Simon: No, it's --",
        "Katie: Come on, no --",
        "Simon: No, it doesn't -- it's fine, hon.",
        "Katie: Here, here, here, here. Any friend of Simon's is a friend of mine. Let's see what we've got. Hundred?",
        "Bartleby: Katie, no, I couldn't.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, we insist. You have to take it, right?",
        "Bartleby: Well, that's right generous of you. She's one in ten million, Simon. If I were you, I would take extra-special care of this one. You wouldn't want anything to happen to her.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I can't concentrate on this wreck. I can't concentrate on anything right now.",
        "Alison: Just give a girl some notice next time you're about to flip out.",
        "Aaron: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I know I've been a real big pain today.",
        "Alison: And I've been really good about not saying \"I told you so.\" But what is it gonna take for you to realize that it's time to get over her? Okay, I'm not saying a word.",
        "Aaron: Good.",
        "Alison: Okay, but just hear me out. I know you think you and Lucy are in love and everything, but is this really your definition of love? Getting kicked to the curb every other minute?",
        "Aaron: It's not as simple as that, okay?",
        "Alison: You have been accused of burning down a barn, scarring Lucy's precious leg in a motorcycle accident, making her run halfway across the country with you, and you know what? I'm sure her father blames you for making her miss most of her senior year in high school. And what does Lucy do during all of this?",
        "Aaron: She's trying to get her life back, and we're not having this conversation right now.",
        "Alison: And you know, I'm trying to get my life back, too. Why? Because I put myself on the line for you over and over again. So I think I'm entitled to say that this great love affair that you think you have going on, you're in it all by yourself.",
        "Aaron: Are you through yet?",
        "Alison: No. When someone loves you, they don't keep hurting you the way Lucy's done. The way I see it, she isn't even a decent friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hmm, what brought up this question about your virginity?",
        "Lucy: You promise you won't tell my father any part of this conversation?",
        "Rosanna: Absolutely, I promise. Your secrets are safe with me. But I have to tell you, if I think that this is something that your father should know, I'm going to do everything in my power to convince you to tell him yourself.",
        "Lucy: All right. Aaron told me that we -- that he and I --",
        "Rosanna: Made love?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, while we were on the road, in some barn.",
        "Rosanna: And you're wondering whether it actually happened or not? You have no memory of this?",
        "Lucy: I remember next to nothing about being away. I know I had a fight with Alison towards the end, but that's pretty much it. I even had to ask her about that, and that's when she told me it was because I found out Aaron had slept with some girl in North Carolina.",
        "Rosanna: And Aaron denied that?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, and now I don't know who to believe.",
        "Rosanna: Do you think that Aaron would say that the two of you had made love if it weren't true?",
        "Lucy: Maybe.",
        "Rosanna: And what would be his reason for that?",
        "Lucy: I don't know. Maybe to distract me from thinking there was another girl. Okay, so what if he is telling the truth? Did I -- do what he said we did? Because if we did, then I must have really loved him. If I loved him that much, Rosanna, how -- how can I throw that away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Ah. Me and Mike Kasnoff. Shouldn't you be in the hospital, pouring concrete instead of booze?",
        "Mike: It's nonalcoholic, and it's none of your business.",
        "Craig: Everything is my business. Listen, I heard Molly had taken up residency, but she's not in her room. Do you have any ideas?",
        "Mike: Yeah, yeah, I got an idea. Hire yourself a private detective to find out where Molly is. I'm sure your fianc\u00e9 can arrange it. What do you want with Molly anyway?",
        "Craig: Carly Tenney. Since it's a safe bet she's not with Jack, I figured who better to put me onto her than Molly?",
        "Mike: Drive on up to Milltown.",
        "Craig: Carly's not there.",
        "Mike: But Jack is. You find Jack, you'll find Molly.",
        "Craig: Molly and Jack, together?",
        "Mike: In every sense of the word.",
        "Craig: Does Carly know?",
        "Mike: No. She's in Cancun. She and Jack were supposed to go there for their honeymoon.",
        "Craig: She went alone?",
        "Mike: Parker.",
        "Craig: Ah, good, a real man. So Carly takes off with Parker on her honeymoon, and Molly -- [Craig chuckles] -- Takes off with Jack. This is too bad. You ought to mix in a little Joe with that. Lester, can we have a cup of coffee for our friend?",
        "Mike: You can believe whatever you want, but I've got to go to work.",
        "Craig: And so do I. Thank you, Lester.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Ah. So, what can I do for you today?",
        "Molly: Um, actually, Jack, it's what I can do for you. You are officially off the hook.",
        "Jack: Uh, \"off the hook\" like I'm all that and a bag of chips?",
        "Molly: No. Thank you. I just want to say thank you. I appreciate the fact that you let me use you to make Mike jump to all the wrong conclusions.",
        "Jack: I don't care what his conclusions are. We don't have to explain anything to anybody, Molly.",
        "Molly: Especially Mike. But I want to explain to him what he really saw that night.",
        "Jack: Yeah? What did he see?",
        "Molly: Two really good friends, mad as hell, ripping each other's clothes off and coming seconds from doing something that they could never take back.",
        "Jack: Let him think what he wants. Let them all think what they want.",
        "Molly: By \"all,\" are you talking about Carly?",
        "Jack: No, by all, I'm saying the entire general population of Oakdale.",
        "Molly: Jack, you're talking about Carly. Admit it. You are, because you know that if she found out that the love of her life, her husband, had sex with her former best friend and cousin, it would kick things up a notch. They did unto us, and she would think that we did unto them. The perfect act of sweet revenge.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Molly: Yeah. But there was no revenge. We both know that. Because somebody came to his senses and found some kind of self-control.",
        "Jack: Is that want you want to tell Mike?",
        "Molly: It's what I need to tell Mike, Jack, before this whole thing blows up in our faces.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Simon: All right, mate. You've had your fun.",
        "Bartleby: You're gonna have to start taking me a little more seriously, mate. I need your answer, and soon. And don't make the mistake of going and talking to the cops about me again. We wouldn't want anything to happen to that beautiful wife of yours.",
        "Simon: You stay the hell away from my wife.",
        "Bartleby: It's in your hands, mate. Toodle-oo.",
        "Katie: Interesting character. Seems like fun.",
        "Simon: Yeah, Barty? Yeah, he's a real laugh riot.",
        "Katie: You know, when he asked if we had any kids, it got me thinking. I don't know why I was so adamant about waiting till we get to Australia to start getting pregnant. What are we waiting for? Let's get serious about this.",
        "Simon: I thought we were serious.",
        "Katie: Well, of course we've been practicing and everything. But I say we get rid of the birth control now, instead of next month. What's wrong?",
        "Simon: Nothing.",
        "Katie: I mean, I totally understand if you have doubts. It's natural.",
        "Simon: Look, I don't have any doubts. I -- I never dreamed of having a family till I met you.",
        "Katie: So there's nothing stopping us now.",
        "Simon: Look, I want to start a family with you, Katie. I do, but --",
        "Katie: But what?",
        "Simon: I've gotta go.",
        "Katie: You've gotta go? Where?",
        "Simon: The car. It's been -- running a little roughly lately. I should take it to the garage.",
        "Katie: Right at this moment?",
        "Simon: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, now. It's way overdue for service.",
        "Katie: Okay, I'll come with you.",
        "Simon: No, it's fine. Please, just -- stay here. I won't be long.",
        "Katie: Okay. Um -- while you're gone, I'll get things ready to start on the little one?",
        "Simon: Yeah. Yeah, do that.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Simon: You lock up tight when I go, okay? I love you.",
        "Katie: Mm. I love you, too.",
        "Simon: Just lock up tight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: The man just got out of the hospital. And you're gonna try to bury him in a jail cell without a trial? What kind of power trip is this, Evelyn?",
        "Evelyn: This is no power trip, Jessica. This is me trying to salvage the D.A.'s office after you and your lover dragged it through the mud!",
        "Margo: What did Evelyn have to say?",
        "Jessica: She keeps pressing that Marshall be held without bail. Keeps insisting he's a flight risk. Can you believe this?",
        "Margo: All right, Jessica. She's under a lot of pressure.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well, we're all under a lot of pressure, Margo. How are you holding up?",
        "Marshall: I'm fine.",
        "Jessica: I'm gonna try to convince the judge to set a reasonable bail.",
        "Marshall: Look, Jessica --",
        "Jessica: Yeah?",
        "Marshall: Look, I know what you're up against. So, no matter what happens -- thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I've thanked you at least a couple million times for everything you've done to help me out. Haven't I?",
        "Alison: Sure, yeah. You appreciate me. What girl doesn't want to be appreciated?",
        "Aaron: Alison, if I've said something wrong --",
        "Alison: Never mind! You go on and keep wasting away over a girl who doesn't even care you exist. I know I'll never measure up to her, so why should I even try?",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that supposed to mean? You wouldn't measure up to Lucy?",
        "Alison: It's all the fumes, you know? It goes straight to my head. I -- I'm not even making sense anymore. Just pretend I'm not even here, like you usually do.",
        "Aaron: No, Alison, we have to talk about this.",
        "Alison: There's nothing to talk about. I've forgotten about it, and so should you. Now, we better get some work done around here if we're gonna keep our jobs.",
        "Aaron: Okay -- better let me help you with that, okay?",
        "Alison: I can't keep on relying on you, right? Time to fly solo? All right, so -- so this thingy is hooked up to that thingy over there. And then the fluid goes through the tube, which is hooked up to the almighty distributor cap. And that's where all the action is, the distributor cap. [Alison sighs] You oughta rename it the \"Lucy\" cap, right? So --",
        "Aaron: What are you trying to do, Alison?",
        "Alison: This thing won't budge!",
        "[Aaron laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You wanna tell Mike the truth? Feel free. But don't do it because you're worried about things blowing up in my face. My marriage is over. Whatever Carly hears or doesn't hear -- I don't give a damn.",
        "Molly: Yeah, well, I do. And you're a better man than that, Jack. You proved it in my hotel room. So you might say your marriage is over, but we both know you still love Carly.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'll get over it, Mol.",
        "Molly: Come on! You guys have risen from the ashes hundreds of times before. Marriages survive betrayals, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, she betrayed you. Don't forget. Do you want something to eat?",
        "Molly: No. And yeah. And I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to trust her or anybody else ever again, but I'm talking about you.",
        "Jack: Well, let's talk about you! Why do you want to tell Mike the truth? Is it because you're worried that he's gonna tell Carly that he saw us together in your hotel room, or is it because you still love the guy, Mol?",
        "Molly: All I know is it feels really wrong to lie about us. And I don't want revenge. I just want --",
        "Jack: You're the one who started the whole -- okay, look. Like I said before, whatever you want is fine with me.",
        "Molly: There's something else I have to tell you. Something you're gonna end up hating me for.",
        "Jack: Something that's gonna make me lose the best friend I have in Oakdale right now? Let's hear it.",
        "Molly: Jack, I knew that Carly slept with somebody else the night before your wedding. And I knew it, and I didn't want to keep it a secret, but she made me. She --",
        "Jack: Mol, Mol, Mol! Forget about it. I don't hate you for that. You and Carly are closer than most sisters. I'm sure there's tons of secrets you keep for each other that you never tell anybody.",
        "Molly: That's a conservative estimate.",
        "Jack: You didn't even think to ask who the guy was, though? I mean --",
        "Molly: She said it was Craig. And he went along with it till he found out she was pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Molly's car in Jack's driveway. You dirty dogs.",
        "Jack: So Craig knew all along. And he lied to protect Carly?",
        "[Doorbell rings] [Jack laughs] This is too good to be true.",
        "Craig: Exactly. You two rascals didn't waste a second. Did ya?",
        "Jack: What do you want, Montgomery?",
        "Craig: I was looking for Molly.",
        "Molly: Well, you found her.",
        "Craig: Yes! Yes, Mike Kasnoff said you might be here.",
        "Molly: Mike?",
        "Craig: Yes, I ran into him at the Lakeview lounge. I suppose he was -- sitting around waiting for you. Anyway, I told him I went up to your room. He said you might be over here.",
        "Molly: Why were you looking for me, Craig?",
        "Craig: I thought you could tell me where I might find Carly.",
        "Molly: We're no longer joined at the hip, so --",
        "Jack: She's in Cancun, Craig. Now, why don't you get out there and have a real affair with her instead of just the made-up one you guys conjured up to throw us off-track?",
        "Craig: I see you've been brought up to date, Jack. That must be novel for you. And it turns out I'm not the one you should have worried about.",
        "Jack: Mm.",
        "Craig: How ironic.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you must feel like a jerk, though. All the time and money you spent trying to get her into your bed, and all it took was an old flame and a bottle of champagne.",
        "Craig: Oh, I got her into bed. At least I had the sense to get out. Which is more than I could say for the two of you. Molly, this rebound roulette, you know, is fraught with peril. Jack is married, et cetera, et cetera. Jack, I am surprised at you taking advantage of Molly.",
        "Molly: Back off. Jack didn't take advantage of anybody.",
        "Jack: No, Molly --",
        "Molly: I am the one that came on to Jack --",
        "Jack: Mol, Mol, Mol, Mol. He doesn't need to know all the details. Molly's a very desirable woman, Craig. We're both consenting adults. We don't have a problem with our relationship. Why should he? In fact, why don't we throw all of our keys into a punch bowl, huh? Play some musical beds. Mike can take another shot at Rosanna, and you can have Carly, if you want her. Hold on just a second. I'll find her for you.",

        "Simon: Margo. Hey.",
        "Margo: What, the celebration's over? What are you doing here?",
        "Simon: Uh -- I came to have a word to Jack. But he seems to be on vacation, so I'll just --",
        "Margo: Well, is there anything that I could help you with?",
        "Bartleby: Wrong move, Simon. Now let's make sure your first mistake is your last mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You know, I think I know how you might feel. Betrayed, let down, unsure of everyone's motives. I've spent a great deal of my life in that place, and it's no place for a girl like you. You know, no matter what happens with Aaron, you have the rest of your life ahead of you. And a broken heart does heal. I'm living proof. You'll fall in love again. There are -- there are tons of wonderful, unforgettable men out there who will love you. And you could love them, if you let them. You will love again, and you'll be happy.",
        "Lucy: You wouldn't know that by looking at me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to dump all this in your lap.",
        "Rosanna: It's okay. It's what family's for. And we're almost family, right?",
        "Lucy: Right. I mean, how are you doing? I'm not the only person who's been in the hospital lately. Are you okay?",
        "Lucy: Well, I kinda meant -- dad told me what kind of operation it was.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I know what you meant. And I'm fine. You know, I -- I'm not gonna be having any children of my own. And I've accepted that and -- I know there's nothing I can do to change that, so --",
        "Lucy: Did you want children? I'm so sorry, Rosanna. Is that why you're being so nice to me?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, don't think that.",
        "Lucy: I don't. I just -- I feel like I'm safe with you. Like you really care about me. That's why I want to trust you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.",
        "Rosanna: No, it's okay. It's okay. I'm not crying because I'm sad. I'm happy. Really. And I'm so proud. You know, I -- I know I could never take Sierra's place. I would never try. But I promised her that I would look after you. I would try my best to take care of you. And the fact that you trust me, I feel so honored. Really, I promise you, I'll do everything I can to never let you down.",

        "Alison: Ew, I'm covered in oil. This is so gross.",

        "Alison: Thanks a lot.",
        "Aaron: Oh, come on, Alison! You have to admit -- that was funny.",
        "Alison: Imagine how funny it would be for me to see you covered in an oil slick.",
        "Aaron: Oh, you wouldn't do that.",
        "Alison: Give me one reason not to.",
        "Aaron: Because -- because I just got these cleaned, okay? All right. All right, already. Look, I'll get you a soda. Is that cool? You want a soda?",
        "Alison: And half your sandwich.",
        "Aaron: Okay, you drive a hard bargain. Just relax with that, okay? Here.",
        "Alison: Thanks. Mm. I like this.",
        "Aaron: Turkey and Swiss?",
        "Alison: Hanging out with you. I like hanging out with you more than any other guy I've even known. More than anyone, maybe.",
        "Aaron: Right. A girl like you gets a kick out of hanging out in a garage, eating a turkey Swiss sandwich.",
        "Alison: Well -- what kind of girl am I?",
        "Aaron: You know, a party girl. Girls who have been around.",
        "Alison: What makes you so sure I'm so experienced?",
        "Aaron: Oh, come on, Alison. You know.",
        "Alison: No, tell me.",
        "Aaron: How about the way you treat Lucy? How you always tease her about being a virgin? Hmm? I mean, it's nothing to be ashamed of. I mean, it's just that you and Lucy are two totally different girls. That's all.",
        "Alison: More different than you know. You don't know the first thing about me.",
        "Aaron: I can read you like a book.",
        "Alison: If you could, then you'd know why it bothered me so much that you slept with Lucy.",
        "Aaron: Bothered you? Why?",
        "Alison: Because she lost her virginity before me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Making love for the first time is supposed to be this major milestone. And to think I've waited practically my whole life for it and then not even being able to remember whether it happened or not?",
        "Rosanna: It'll all come back to you.",
        "Lucy: But -- a doctor could tell me.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, he could, technically. But accessing all of the emotions attached -- that's up to you.",
        "Lucy: I'm glad you're here. I could never talk about this with my father. My mom, she just -- I'd be on the first flight back to Oakdale.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you know, it wouldn't be so bad to tell your mom, now, would it?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but it always ends up the same when she comes back here. My mom and my dad wind up angry with each other. I don't think anyone wants that. Especially you. You've got a wedding to plan. You know, what you said today -- it sounded like you've had a lot of heartbreak in the past. I'm glad you fell in love again. I'm glad my dad makes you happy.",
        "Rosanna: You know, your dad really wants your happiness. He really loves you. But you have to decide what makes you happy. And you have to believe that if you take baby steps and are patient, you're going to remember what's right. And I promise you, I'll help you as much as I can.",
        "Lucy: You will?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, sure. I mean, why not?",
        "Lucy: Can we start now?",
        "Rosanna: Sure. How about we start by making a list of everything you remember about Aaron? Okay? Okay.",

        "Molly: So you're honestly going to try and tell me that you're here looking for Jack Snyder when you should be home celebrating with your beautiful blond wife?",
        "Simon: Ah, it's just a guy thing, you know? No big deal.",
        "Molly: Is everything all right?",
        "Simon: All right? Yeah, no. Couldn't be better. Good.",
        "Molly: 'Cause, I mean, forgive me for asking, but you do seem just a little jumpy. So is there anything I can do for you?",
        "Policeman: Excuse me, detective?",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Policeman: The guy being interrogated has asked for a glass of water so he can take some pills?",

        "Jessica: Of course you are.",
        "Evelyn: And if I were to do any special favors for you, everyone would think that I'm letting the former district attorneys get away with murder, and I'm letting Marshall walk just like he let Steinbeck walk. Can't afford to jeopardize my office --",
        "Jessica: Your temporary office, Evelyn. Don't get too comfortable.",
        "Marshall: That took long enough. How'd it go?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- Margo, don't start, okay?",
        "Marshall: Look, if you're here to take me to my cell, I'm ready.",

        "Aaron: What was I supposed to say? \"Congratulations\"? \"Oh, my God\"? What?",
        "Alison: Forget it. I don't even know why I opened my big fat mouth in the first place. You just think I'm a bigger loser than before.",
        "Aaron: Ali, I don't think you're a loser. As a matter of fact, I think we're very much alike. I mean, you're a thousand times more intense.",
        "Alison: I know. I know, and I -- I try to tone down. But sometimes I can't help it. I go all crazy, and I go off the deep end sometimes. And I just -- I just do it because -- I care about you.",
        "Aaron: Well, I care about you, too, Ali. But that's why we're friends.",

        "Lucy: Is this gonna get you in trouble with my father? I think all he really wants is for Aaron to disappear.",
        "Rosanna: This is about you knowing your own mind. All right? And do you remember what you told me about my wedding, how I should have the wedding that I want no matter what anybody else wants or thinks?",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: You have to have the life you want, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: I don't know if I'm strong enough for that yet.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you know, the Lucy I remember before the accident -- she was pretty strong. The thing I admired the most about her was the way she would stand up to anyone when she thought she was right.",
        "Lucy: I did?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. I could tell you quite a few stories. But I won't, because I'm sure you will remember them in time. And don't worry about your dad being angry. I can handle him.",

        "Molly: Okay, look, since you are obviously not deep enough to comprehend what's really going on between Jack and me, I would appreciate if you would keep it quiet to Rosanna, Carly, or whoever else might listen, for that matter.",
        "Craig: And why would I say anything? I'm too shallow to comprehend such complex issues.",
        "Molly: Craig!",
        "Craig: Oh, come on. I'm the very voice of discretion. Besides, Jack said we're all consenting adults. At least, you two are.",
