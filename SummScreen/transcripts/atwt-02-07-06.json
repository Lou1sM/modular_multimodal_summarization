        "Maddie: I'll get it.",
        "Casey: Don't bother, I doubt it's for you.",
        "Maddie: Fine, it's your house.",
        "Casey: I'm glad you still remember. Oh, hello, Henry.",
        "Henry: Oh, hello. Don't be happy to see me.",
        "Casey: Oh, no, I'm thrilled, really. Any friend of Maddie's is a friend of mine.",
        "Henry: Well, I think being an actual brother counts a little bit more than being a friend, don't you, Casey?",
        "Casey: Whatever?",
        "Maddie: Never mind him, Henry. I'm so happy you're here.",
        "Henry: Yes, I'm so happy. What was so urgent that you needed to see me right away?",
        "[Maddie sighs]",
        "Maddie: Do you mind?",
        "Casey: Would it matter if I did?",
        "Maddie: You have got to get me out of here ASAP.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Wow, nice house.",
        "Lily: Thanks.",
        "Jade: Thanks for inviting me in.",
        "Lily: Well, it was too cold to talk outside and obviously there are some things we need to clear up.",
        "Jade: I know you think that i sound crazy, but I'm not. I know exactly why I'm here. I know exactly what I'm saying. I came here to find out about my mother.",
        "Lily: There's no way, absolutely no way that I could be your mother.",
        "Holden: Why would you think that?",
        "Jade: Wait, you don't understand?",
        "Lily: No, I do. See, you've been in a car accident. You're a little confused right now. You just need to rest, that's all.",
        "Jade: I'm not confused about anything. Let me explain. I came here to see what my mother looked like and now I'm looking at her face. It's beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What if it's worse than they think? What if she dies?",
        "Gwen: Your mom's not going to die from hitting her head. I'm sure she's going to wake up any second.",
        "Will: When I tried to get through to her at the hospital, she didn't hear a word I said. I could tell. She didn't even move. When someone's unconscious that long, it's not good.",
        "Gwen: Look, stop thinking like that.",
        "Will: How could I not be worried? If something happens to her, it's my fault. I'm responsible.",
        "Gwen: It was an accident.",
        "Will: No it wasn't. I got really mad and I pushed her really hard.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but you weren't trying to hurt her. You were just trying to get the phone away from her. Stop making yourself crazy. No one is going to die.",
        "Will: It doesn't matter. I've got to go to the cops.",
        "Gwen: And tell them what?",
        "Will: Tell them the truth. I've got to turn myself in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: How is she?",
        "Nurse: Her vitals are in the normal range.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, thank God. Mom, how do you feel?",
        "Barbara: I'm a little weak. How did I get here?",
        "Jennifer: Well, we found you on the floor at your suite. You were unconscious and then the paramedics brought you to the hospital. What happened?",
        "Barbara: How long have I been out?",
        "Jennifer: We're not sure. It seemed like might have fallen and hit your head. Does that sound right?",
        "[Barbara remembering]",
        "Gwen: Will, stop!",
        "[Screaming]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mom, do you remember what happened?",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes. I remember everything. I know exactly what happened to me. And who did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: That's what I'm talking about. You're killing me, sweetheart. Come here!",
        "Butch: Can I help you?",
        "Carly: Oh, hi.",
        "Butch: Hi.",
        "Carly: Maybe, who are you?",
        "Butch: I'm the manager. Who are you?",
        "Carly: Me?",
        "Butch: Yeah.",
        "Carly: I --",
        "Butch: Are you here for the job?",
        "Carly: You mean doing that? [Carly laughs] No, no, I don't think so. No.",
        "Butch: Lady, you're either here looking for someone or something, so which one is it?",
        "Carly: I am here about a job, just not that kind of job. I'm not a stripper.",
        "Butch: You know, that's funny. I can kind of tell. What kind of job were you thinking about?",
        "Carly: Well, I heard that you were looking for waitresses.",
        "Butch: Yeah? Where'd you hear that?",
        "Carly: You know, here and there.",
        "Butch: Turn around.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Butch: Let me check out your caboose.",
        "Carly: I beg your pardon?",
        "Butch: Look, this isn't a Lakeview, all right? The guys don't come here for the food. Even if you want a waitress job, you gotta look good. Come on. Yeah, you'll do.",
        "[Carly laughs nervously]",
        "Carly: Gee, thanks.",
        "Butch: Go grab your uniform in the dressing room.",
        "Carly: You want me to start tonight?",
        "Butch: You got someplace better to be, princess?",
        "Carly: No, I just thought that you'd have some paperwork to fill out. Some forms.",
        "Butch: No, no, no, no. The only thing that you need to fill out is that uniform. All right? I don't even need to know your real name. Everything's under the table here. $50 a night cash, plus tips. You want to get something extra going on with one of the customers, I don't want to know about it, understand?",
        "Carly: Yeah, no, no. You don't have to worry about that. That's never going to happen. Ever.",
        "Butch: You got any questions, you ask Chardonnay. Go ahead, go change. She'll help you out.",
        "Carly: Chardonnay?",
        "[Applause]",
        "Butch: You having a good time?",
        "Nick: Yeah, I'm doing all right. Listen, I was looking for a little different kind of action.",
        "Butch: Whoa, whoa, whoa, pal. In my club, the girls only dance, all right?",
        "Nick: That's not the action I really meant.",
        "Butch: Enlighten me.",
        "Nick: You know, like five card stud, Texas hold'em. You know, whatever you got.",
        "Butch: This look like Vegas to you?",
        "Nick: No, that's why I'm here. You know, I can't stand Vegas. It's like Disneyland on acid, you know? Here's the deal. What's it going to take for me to get in the loop? Hmm?",
        "Butch: Keep going. Follow me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Okay, what happened?",
        "Maddie: It's not one thing, it's everything.",
        "Henry: With Casey? I thought you two were getting along.",
        "Maddie: He's an idiot.",
        "[Henry laughing]",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Maddie: Because he thinks I'm an idiot.",
        "Henry: Well, now, how could he accuse you of that? You're precocious. Maybe you're stubborn. But he'd have to be an idiot to call you an idiot.",
        "Maddie: My point exactly.",
        "Henry: Okay, then specifics, Madeline. What, did you two get in a fight?",
        "Maddie: He has this lame idea that he can just tell me what to do.",
        "Henry: Example.",
        "Maddie: He thinks he can tell me who I should and shouldn't hang out with from school.",
        "Henry: From school. Somebody that's off limits in his book?",
        "Maddie: Sort of.",
        "Henry: A male somebody?",
        "Maddie: As if that mattered.",
        "Henry: Hmm, I can tell by your nonchalance that it must.",
        "Maddie: Henry, where are you going with this?",
        "Henry: Maybe, Madeline, maybe he's jealous.",
        "Maddie: Who?",
        "Henry: Casey.",
        "Maddie: No, no. He's not like that, Henry.",
        "Henry: How can you know that for sure?",
        "Maddie: We're getting off the subject.",
        "Henry: I thought this was the subject.",
        "Maddie: No, the subject is \"get me out of here.\"",
        "Henry: That's just not going to be very easy right now, okay?",
        "Maddie: Why not? Go get the car. I'll go pack. Pull up, I'll put my stuff in and we can go someplace else.",
        "Henry: Someplace else is the problem. I am sorry, sweetheart. Like it or not, but you're stuck here for a little while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: No way are you going to go to the cops and turn yourself in for something that was a complete accident. There's no reason to get the cops involved. Especially since your mom is going to be fine.",
        "Will: I pray that you're right, but it doesn't change the fact that she got hurt while I was trying to steal from her. How am I supposed to talk my way out of that?",
        "Gwen: We'll get a lawyer.",
        "Will: I can't believe I let myself get pushed so far that I tried to rob my own mother.",
        "Gwen: It's my fault. You were doing it for me.",
        "Will: No, I was doing it for us. I just never thought it would get to this point.",
        "Gwen: She put us here.",
        "Will: That doesn't make what I did okay.",
        "Gwen: I'm not saying it was right.",
        "Will: No, you told me not to do it and I should have listened to you, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: It doesn't matter. We're in this together. This is happening to both of us, so if you go to the cops, I'm going with you.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Will: It's Jen. Hey, Jen, how's Mom?",
        "Jennifer: She's regained consciousness.",
        "Will: Thank God. She's awake.",
        "Jennifer: The doctors are running some other tests but they don't think there's any neurological damage.",
        "Will: Okay, so she's got her eyes open and she knows who you are and everything?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, she's completely aware. You know, she understands what I'm saying and she's answering questions.",
        "Will: Did she say anything about what happened to her?",
        "Jennifer: She said she remembers everything, but they're trying to track down Dad so that she can give him her statement.",
        "Will: She didn't say how she got hurt?",
        "Jennifer: No, no, she wants to wait until Dad can get here. Are you coming back in?",
        "Will: Yeah, I'll be right there. Jen said she remembers everything, but she's going to wait for Dad so she can give an official statement.",
        "Gwen: Oh, Will, you have to talk to her before he gets there.",
        "Will: I don't think that's going to do any good. She must hate me right now.",
        "Gwen: But if you sit with her and explain to her that it was an accident, that you didn't mean to hurt her.",
        "Will: I don't think it matters. I don't think she's going to listen to me.",
        "Gwen: It's worth a shot.",
        "Will: You want to come with me?",
        "Gwen: You know I do, but you know how she feels about me so i should stay here while you talk to her.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: I'll wait for you right here.",
        "Will: Okay. You know how much I love you. I couldn't get through this without you.",
        "Gwen: Things are going to be okay. She'll forgive you. I'm sure of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Maybe I better start over. I think you've all gotten the wrong idea.",
        "Lily: Uh, Jade, all I know is that you're under a very mistaken impression that I am your mother. I am not.",
        "Jade: I'm sorry. Of course you're not my mother. What I meant was, you have the same face. I knew that she had an identical twin, but it's so amazing to actually see it.",
        "Lily: Whoa, wait a minute. You're talking about my sister Rose?",
        "Jade: Yes.",
        "Lily: You're telling me that you're --",
        "Jade: Her daughter. That's right. Rose d'angelo was my mother. This is my buddy.",
        "Jade: I know this is a pretty big surprise. I never meant to spring it on you like this. I had this whole plan worked out in my head of how I was going to tell you. Of course, that plan didn't include getting hit by a car.",
        "Luke: That's my fault.",
        "Jade: No, it wasn't. I ran right in front of you. No one could've stopped in time. But luckily, I'm still in one piece, and once then we all ended up face to face, I couldn't put it off any longer. It sort of forced my hand. I can tell you're all pretty shocked. Maybe we better talk about this tomorrow.",
        "Luke: No, no, no, no, don't go. I'm sure you guys want to deal with this tonight, right?",
        "Holden: Oh, you mean, instead of dealing with you?",
        "Luke: No, I just --",
        "Holden: There'll be plenty of time for that but I do agree. I think this -- I think this takes precedence.",
        "Lily: If there's any truth to it.",
        "Jade: I have no reason to lie.",
        "Lily: Rose and I were extremely close, we shared everything. She never once said she had a daughter. And she would not keep that secret, not from me.",
        "Jade: I didn't expect you to take my word for it but I do have some proof.",
        "Lily: Really? I'd be very interested in seeing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Are you going to even bother telling me why you can't get me out of here? Or are you just going to leave me hanging while you -- Henry, what are you looking for?",
        "Henry: Where the Sam Hill do they keep the hooch around here?",
        "Maddie: Tom and Margo actually work for a living so they don't really have time to come home and booze it up.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on, Maddie! They deal with hardened criminals all day long, you're telling me they don't need a little reinforcements when they come through that door at night.",
        "Maddie: Quit dodging and answer my question. Why can't I leave with you?",
        "Henry: Because there is no place for you to go to.",
        "Maddie: Let me live with you.",
        "Henry: No, this is the best place for you right now. You don't need to be with me.",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Henry: I'm under a lot of pressure right now and I wouldn't be a very good live-in companion.",
        "Maddie: Henry, please, I have seen you at your worst, okay. I think I can handle it.",
        "Henry: Give it a few weeks. I've got to tell you something, I've got some irons in the fire. My ship is coming in. I can see a silver lining in that cloud that's been hanging over me for so long. I'm all out of clich\u00e9s, baby. But I think you get my drift, don't you?",
        "Maddie: Yes I do. But I don't think you understand the urgency of my plight.",
        "Henry: A-ha! Creme de menthe? Oh Lord, who are these people, mad?",
        "Maddie: Please, please, please. I can not bear it any longer, okay. Okay, all right, I will let you -- I give you permission to use a little of that money from B.J. Henry, we can share a place. You can use it and we can share a place.",
        "Henry: That money -- that money's off limits for now, okay?",
        "Maddie: You're right. I shouldn't even mentioned -- what was I thinking --",
        "Henry: I don't know. Shame on you, shame on you. Oh God! What am I supposed to drink this or gargle with it?",
        "Maddie: What am I supposed to do?",
        "Henry: Why don't you try making up with Casey? What the hell?",
        "Maddie: I would rather stick my head in a lion's mouth. Are you still gonna drink that?",
        "Henry: Yes! It's that bad, huh? Listen, for every problem there is a solution.",
        "Maddie: You sound like my calculus teacher.",
        "Henry: What we need to do is -- what I need to do is figure out the best way to help you, what would that be?",
        "Maddie: There's only one thing that could do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: All right, Barbara, why don't we start at the beginning and you tell me everything that happened.",
        "Barbara: I'd really rather do this with Hal.",
        "Margo: Well, Hal's working another case and can't be pulled away. So, if this is a matter for the police, I'll be very happy to take your statement. However, if it's something more personal --",
        "Barbara: It's both. I want to make a statement and I plan on pressing charges.",
        "Margo: Very well. Then let's start with how you got hurt.",
        "Barbara: I was in bed, and I thought I heard noises in the living room. When I walked in, someone was there, robbing me. And when I tried to chase them out, things turned violent. And the intruder grabbed me and pushed me. Apparently I hit my head and I was knocked unconscious. The next thing I remember is waking up here, in the hospital.",
        "Margo: Did you get a look at this intruder?",
        "Barbara: Yes.",
        "Margo: And did you recognize him?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I did.",
        "Margo: Was it someone you know?",
        "Barbara: Yes. It was Gwen Norbeck. She broke into my suite. And she attacked me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Butch: All right. Not bad. Not bad at all. As long as you don't spill beer on anybody, you'll probably work out. Get, go pick up an order from the bar.",
        "Chardonnay: You're new.",
        "Carly: Yeah, hi.",
        "Chardonnay: I'm Chardonnay aka Sylvia Turnblatt.",
        "Carly: Tiffany, aka Tiffany.",
        "Chardonnay: You came on just in time. I was afraid I'd have to start waitressing.",
        "Carly: Oh, does that happen a lot?",
        "Chardonnay: Whenever Butch is short-handed, we have to pull double duty. Believe me, it's no fun. Guys can get a little dangerous when you serve them drinks after they've seen you naked.",
        "Carly: Oh, I can imagine.",
        "Chardonnay: Nah, you probably have no idea. What are you doing, taking a job like this? You don't seem like the type.",
        "Carly: It's just a job, right? I need the money.",
        "Chardonnay: Talk to me at the end of your first shift.",
        "Carly: I'm not worried.",
        "Chardonnay: Good. Just make sure the guys are clear about something -- hands off. And be careful with the back room boys. They can get rough, especially when they're losing.",
        "Carly: Thanks for the tip.",
        "Chardonnay: Any problems, come to me. Good luck.",
        "Carly: Thanks. Thanks.",
        "Player #1: I hear ya, man. Nothing like the smell of cheap beer.",
        "Nick: I smell expensive perfume. It's a little too familiar.",
        "Butch: Whoa, whoa. There a problem, pal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Butch: You got a problem with my new waitress?",
        "Nick: No. It's just that my girlfriend used to wear the same kind of perfume. Blondie over here reminded me of her, that's all.",
        "Carly: What happened to her? I bet you broke her heart.",
        "Nick: Actually, she broke mine. Why don't you come stand over here, Blondie, maybe you'll bring me more luck than she did.",
        "Carly: In your dreams.",
        "Butch: Let's go, Tiffany, back to work.",
        "Nick: Tiffany. That's a nice name.",
        "Carly: Miss Tiffany, to you.",
        "Nick: I'm out.",
        "Butch: Of the game?",
        "Nick: No, just out of this hand. I'll be right back. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Carly: I'm working, what does it look like?",
        "Nick: It looks like you're trying to blow my cover!",
        "Carly: How was I supposed to know you were here?",
        "Nick: You followed me here. What, did Jack put you up to this? I knew he couldn't stand the fact that I was flying solo on this!",
        "Carly: Jack doesn't even know I'm doing this.",
        "Nick: Then why the hell are you here?",
        "Carly: That is none of your business.",
        "Nick: I think it's all of my business. This is my sting operation.",
        "Carly: Well, how was I supposed to know you were working undercover?",
        "Nick: You know what? Save it, Carly. You've got thirty seconds to explain what you're doing here, or you're going to wish you never even came to the gala club. Now start talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What are you doing? Mom, it wasn't Gwen who did this, and you know it.",
        "Jennifer: Will, calm down. She's trying to lie, Margaret. She's trying to hurt Gwen, but it wasn't Gwen that pushed her. I did. What?",
        "Barbara: Will, you can't defend her anymore. First, the incident with Lisa, and now this.",
        "Margo: Wait, what -- what incident with Lisa?",
        "Barbara: Lisa gave Gwen a job at the Lakeview, but then she had to fire her when she found out that Gwen had taken a diamond necklace from a guest suite.",
        "Will: You can't prove that she did that!",
        "Margo: Was this reported to the police.",
        "Barbara: No, it wasn't, but I was there when Lisa accused Gwen of the theft.",
