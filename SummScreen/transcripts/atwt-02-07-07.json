        "Jack: Nice flowers.",
        "Katie: They're Margo's favorite.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know.",
        "Katie: How do you know that?",
        "Jack: Tom's a good husband.",
        "Katie: I don't know what to write.",
        "Jack: And you're a published author.",
        "Katie: Guess I deserved that one. How's Parker?",
        "Jack: He'll be fine. Our family's a work in progress these days.",
        "Katie: Yeah and a little less crowded. At the house, I mean. I ran into Vienna at the Lakeview. Seems her taste in men has plummeted. She was about to get a room with some loser.",
        "Jack: Katie, no offense, and I'm not saying this to defend Vienna, but I don't want to hear about it.",
        "Katie: Oh, speak of the devil. Look who just crawled out from under his rock.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So, shall I bow now?",
        "Margo: Yes, please.",
        "Kim: Darling, we are so proud of you!",
        "Margo: Oh, thank you. I just never thought it was gonna happen this way, you know?",
        "Tom: Yeah I know, Babe.",
        "Margo: I always thought when Hal became the commissioner, then I'd make my move up --",
        "Bob: I'm sure that Hal would be very happy that they chose you.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, it doesn't make it any easier.",
        "Kim: Listen, I've got a crew. We're gonna film the whole ceremony.",
        "Margo: Wow!",
        "Tom: Well, that's perfect 'cause I'm already taping the news, so we can watch it like -- I don't know? A hundred times?",
        "Kim: Even more perfect -- why don't I send you a copy of the master.",
        "Margo: Nice to have connections.",
        "Kim: Listen, I'm gonna have a conference with our line producer. Talk to you later.",
        "Bob: Well, Honey, how do you like the limelight?",
        "Margo: Well, Honey, it's more like the hot seat.",
        "Bob: Listen, I wanna check with my service before things get started. Listen, kids, this is one of the good days. Enjoy it.",
        "Tom: So, when was the last time somebody called us kids? That feels pretty good to a guy that just had a heart attack.",
        "Margo: And that is why God made brilliant cardiac surgeons -- so that fathers and sons would not miss out on days like this. And Honey? This is not a small conference room. This is a very large conference room. And what's up with that sign?",
        "Tom: Okay, my mom might have gone a little overboard.",
        "Margo: Yeah, you think?",
        "Tom: So how did things go with Will this morning?",
        "Margo: Um, well they didn't -- they didn't. He wasn't there, but I did talk to Gwen.",
        "Tom: How is she?",
        "Margo: She's a wreck.",
        "Tom: So the robbery really set back the cd, huh?",
        "Margo: Well, no 'cause Barbara came up with some more money, so Adam and Gwen are gonna be able to carry through with the project.",
        "Tom: And all she has to do is dedicate the album to Barbara?",
        "Margo: No, I don't think so. It's just something's not quite right there.",
        "Tom: Barbara?",
        "Margo: No, no, it's Will and Gwen. Something's not right with the two of them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Wait, you're joking. Gwen thinks you stole the bonds?",
        "Jade: Your own money?",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm used to people thinking I'm crazy, not stupid.",
        "Jade: Why would she think that?",
        "Will: Well, she found one of the bonds in the cottage. I have no idea how it got there.",
        "Maddie: And she didn't believe you?",
        "Will: No. We actually had a huge fight about it and she spent the night at the dorm. And I went to see her this morning and --",
        "Maddie: And?",
        "Will: Adam was there. And from the look of things, he was with her all night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Casey, what's going on?",
        "Adam: Nothing!",
        "Gwen: Case? Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Adam: Casey can't skip one stupid meeting to go to our mom's --",
        "Casey: That's not it!",
        "Adam: Would you go to your room and chill out --",
        "Casey: No! Gwen has to know and I'm telling her everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, good, you two know each other.",
        "Brad: What's she doing here?",
        "Jack: Is this the loser you were telling me about?",
        "Katie: The Lakeview love machine himself.",
        "Brad: What did you tell him?",
        "Katie: How can you work with this guy?",
        "Jack: Oh, it's so much worse than that.",
        "Brad: You know, your friend has a habit of nosing into other people's business?",
        "Jack: Yeah, tell me about it. Katie, I don't work with him. I live with him. This is my brother.",
        "Katie: That's funny.",
        "Brad: You didn't notice the resemblance last night?",
        "Jack: Brad Snyder, Katie Peretti.",
        "Brad: I need to talk to you?",
        "Katie: I see your manners haven't improved.",
        "Brad: It's just for a moment.",
        "Katie: Don't let me get in your way.",
        "Brad: You sure you don't want to listen? You can put your two cents in?",
        "Katie: I had a preview of how you operate -- not a fan.",
        "Jack: What's going on, Brad?",
        "Brad: She a close friend?",
        "Jack: Margo's sister. I've known her for years. Katie busted you with Vienna?",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah, don't look so happy about it. Anyway, I have been out all day on the job hunt. I got a couple interviews lined up --",
        "Jack: Yes, you look very good in my clothes.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I look very nice in a tie. But I'm short on cash. I need a trim.",
        "Jack: How much?",
        "Brad: 40 should do it.",
        "Jack: What's in the pipeline?",
        "Brad: I don't want to jinx it.",
        "Jack: Fine, here's 20.",
        "Brad: Can't get a decent trim for less than 40.",
        "Jack: You can if you go to the place on Brewer. No appointment. No styling. Just a plain old haircut. Works for me and the boys. Don't judge me.",
        "Brad: Thank you.",
        "Jack: And I want to hear all these interviews later.",
        "Brad: You got it. You got it. Been a pleasure, Baby.",
        "Katie: My name is -- he is so annoying. Are you sure you're brothers? He's nothing like you.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Thank you very much for noticing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Look, just because Adam was in Gwen's room doesn't mean that anything happened.",
        "Jade: I'm sorry, will. I really am. I hope you and Gwen work things out.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, right. She probably snitched money from Lily too, so she could pay off her alibi.",
        "Will: Look, I know you don't like the girl, but why would Jade steal the bonds?",
        "Maddie: Hello, if you and Gwen split, she'll just bat those eyes and pretend that's she's so sorry and reel you back in.",
        "Will: Jade knows that's not happening.",
        "Maddie: Can I get you anything? Gwen loves you.",
        "Will: So, then how could she think that I'd accept money from my mom and then steal it back just to ruin her career?",
        "Maddie: She doesn't believe that! She just needs to talk things out.",
        "Will: Well, I'm the somebody she's supposed to be talking to, Maddie, not Adam. You know, I think deep down maybe Gwen knows the truth.",
        "Maddie: What truth?",
        "Will: That I -- I didn't want the cd to go all the way.",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Will: Fear.",
        "Maddie: Fear? Of what?",
        "Will: That I wouldn't be good enough for her. That she'd be on the road all the time and we wouldn't get to see each other.",
        "Maddie: You can go on the road.",
        "Will: Yeah, but then I'd just be that guy standing in the wings getting in everybody's way.",
        "Maddie: No, you wouldn't.",
        "Will: Look, the point is -- that when I feel myself getting afraid of like that, I stop myself. Because bottom line, I love Gwen. And I want her to be happy.",
        "Maddie: I know. Will, you were set up.",
        "Will: Yeah, but I can't prove it. I thought it was Iris, but she's got an alibi.",
        "Maddie: Big deal. So does Jade.",
        "Will: Well, the problem isn't Iris or Jade or even Adam. It's me and Gwen. We act like a real married couple. But when things get rough -- I don't know? We turn to other people.",
        "Maddie: Gwen didn't turn to Adam.",
        "Will: She spent last night with him. What would you call it? You know what? I don't want to talk about it right now.",
        "Maddie: Will --",
        "Tev: Hello, I thought you were over there.",
        "Maddie: Hi.",
        "Tev: This is Uri. He works for me.",
        "Maddie: Hi, I'm Maddie.",
        "Tev: Funny we'd run into you today.",
        "Maddie: Why? Why's that?",
        "Tev: I asked Uri about those registered bonds when I got back to the shop.",
        "Uri: I just cashed some yesterday.",
        "Tev: He is sure they are the ones you asked me about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Okay, you guys are scaring me. The truth about what? Come on, Case, what is it?",
        "Casey: Gwen, none of this is Will's fault --",
        "Adam: It's not the time.",
        "Casey: Well, when is?",
        "Gwen: Do you want to let him talk?",
        "Casey: Will, he just got caught up in something.",
        "Adam: Why do you want to hurt her?",
        "Casey: Why do you?",
        "Adam: You know, she already knows the score, she sees the way this place looks. All right, look, Will and I had a fight, okay? He came here. He saw me here, he assumed that you and I were -- he just started wailing on me before I could explain. Casey broke it up.",
        "Gwen: Well, is Will okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, he's fine.",
        "Adam: I didn't want to dump all of this on you, but you know, Casey thought that you'd want to know.",
        "Gwen: Well, he was right. You're a good friend.",
        "Casey: I have to go get ready for the ceremony.",
        "Adam: And make it fast. We don't have a lot of time.",
        "Gwen: Look, I understand that you wanted to protect me, but you got to stop, okay? I don't need protection. I don't need protection from Will.",
        "Adam: Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. Okay? I should go check on Casey, he really doesn't like to be in the middle of this. You okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: What the hell are you thinking?",
        "Casey: Just back off.",
        "Adam: You want Tom to end up back in the hospital?",
        "Casey: This is not right.",
        "Adam: You go ahead and shoot your mouth off, you know the big story in the news tonight, right? The son of Oakdale's new Chief of Detectives gets arrested on the day she's sworn in.",
        "Casey: I know.",
        "Adam: And if Will and Gwen can't make it through this, they don't have what it takes anyway. You keep your mouth shut, it all goes away. You got that.",
        "Elwood: Hey you want to play a little game?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Elwood: Come on, I'm feeling lucky.",
        "Casey: Not now!",
        "Elwood: All right, I'm just saying you got all those bonds stashed in the room and -- You keep your mouth shut about those bonds, all right. No one needs to know about them. No one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: I tried to clean up before you got back.",
        "Gwen: That's fine. I went by the house to talk to Will and he wasn't there.",
        "Adam: Want me to try and talk to him again?",
        "Gwen: No. No, I will.",
        "Adam: Gwen, not yet. Please. You know what, Casey and I told you about the fight -- that was only part of it.",
        "Gwen: Great. There's more?",
        "Adam: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: You know I don't know if I want to hear this.",
        "Adam: And I'm not sure if I'm ready to say it. Gwen, I lied to you. I've been lying to myself too, for a long time. And I can't do it anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh,that is really beautiful. I love that.",
        "Nancy: We thought it would be nice if someone would take picture of the whole family after the ceremony.",
        "Lisa: Yeah, and it's gonna look great on your desk, right next to your new title.",
        "Tom: You know, I wish Daniel were here for this.",
        "Nancy: How is he?",
        "Tom: He's home sick. But, hey, he likes school.",
        "Margo: That little brat, you know he's made so many new friends -- I called him last night and he hung up on me.",
        "Lisa: Good for him.",
        "Dallas: Hail to the chief.",
        "Margo: Oh, I like that.",
        "Jessica: Congratulations.",
        "Margo: Thank you.",
        "Lisa: Excuse me I must go check on my refreshments.",
        "Tom: All right Gram, why don't you and I go make a phone call and see what's keeping the boys?",
        "Nancy: Sometimes at their age, it's just as well not to know what it is their about.",
        "Tom: Spoken like a wise woman.",
        "Margo: Any movement on the robbery at Crash?",
        "Dallas: Well, the lab's still sifting through prints and talking to everybody that we could id that was there that night.",
        "Jessica: Well, at least the press hasn't got a hold of the story.",
        "Margo: Lisa and Casey work so hard on that place. I hate to see some punk ruin it for them.",
        "Dallas: Hey, catching punks is our specialty, right?",
        "Margo: And as Chief of Detectives, I intend to put that one behind bars for a long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tev: I described that girl you told me about.",
        "Uri: It wasn't her.",
        "Maddie: Are you sure?",
        "Uri: From what Tev said -- that's a face I'd remember.",
        "Maddie: Or live to regret.",
        "Uri: Besides, it was a guy.",
        "Maddie: A guy? Are you sure?",
        "Uri: I know the difference.",
        "Maddie: What did he look like?",
        "Uri: Different.",
        "Maddie: Different how?",
        "Uri: Weird, like -- movie.",
        "Maddie: A movie? Okay, well, I'm really good at movies. Let's see.",
        "Uri: Revenge -- something.",
        "Maddie: Revenge -- revenge -- revenge, of what, the sixth? There's the pink panther, the mummy, the nerds.",
        "Uri: Nerds.",
        "Maddie: Nerds? Revenge of the nerds?",
        "Tev: Ooh, I love that movie.",
        "Maddie: Okay, there's, like -- there's, like, millions of nerds in that movie.",
        "Uri: He looks a little older than you.",
        "Maddie: Older -- all right, what did he look like? Let's see, hair -- blond, brown? Long, straight?",
        "Uri: It's a lot of money. I don't remember his face. I mean -- glasses.",
        "Maddie: Glasses.",
        "Uri: And he wore a backpack.",
        "Maddie: Okay, every kid has a backpack.",
        "Uri: With O.U. stickers all over it?",
        "Maddie: He goes to Oakdale University?",
        "Tev: Uri said he had his name on the backpack.",
        "Maddie: Well, and he signed the bonds, right? So, okay, what is his name? What's the name?",
        "Uri: Elroy, something. I don't -- I'll check back at the shop.",
        "Maddie: Elroy? You don't mean, Elwood?",
        "Uri: That's it. Elwood. What kind of a crazy name is that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elwood: Now, if I can calculate the odds of either suit coming up --",
        "Casey: Shut up and hit the button.",
        "Elwood: Sweet! Jacks full. Hey, you sure you don't want to play?",
        "Casey: No, what's your problem, Man?",
        "Elwood: Whoa. Hey, I was just trying to --",
        "Casey: You're always just -- all right? Forget it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So, what did you lie to me about?",
        "Adam: Just, let me say a few things first. You know, when I first came back into town and I heard you sing, I was blown away.",
        "Gwen: By some local talent who was way too pitchy?",
        "Adam: Oh, I didn't say that. Did I really say that?",
        "Gwen: It was honest.",
        "Adam: No, it was cocky. There you were, clear and strong. That voice. I kept thinking, why did I have to travel a couple of thousand miles to find my dream when it was waiting for me all along here in Oakdale.",
        "Gwen: Oh, come on, Adam. I mean, without you, I'd still be doing open mic night at Crash.",
        "Adam: No. No, somehow you would have made it. I'm just glad it was me instead of some schmuck who was only in it for the money.",
        "Gwen: Oh, come on, and you weren't?",
        "Adam: Okay, yeah, I guess everybody's in it for the money, but, you know, the good ones stick around. Those first few weeks --",
        "Gwen: I wanted to beat you with a stick.",
        "Adam: Yeah, I don't blame you. And I was afraid that if I didn't keep focused, if I didn't work you till you dropped, that you'd see through me. I'm not sure when it started to change, but one day I realized that every song, every lyric felt as if you were singing just to me. Not to any audience or to anybody in the studio. Not even to Will.",
        "Gwen: Adam --",
        "Adam: And then we went to L.A., and we kissed. I know we said that we were just caught up in the moment, but it was more than that please don't go.",
        "Gwen: I don't know what to say.",
        "Adam: Oh, nothing. Just listen. I tried to stop this Gwen, I really did. You know, I thought that if I pushed you to the point where you hated me that we could keep things under control, not cross this line between us. That didn't seem to work. Fighting to make this demo only brought us closer.",
        "Gwen: I can't listen to this right now, Adam. Honestly, I can't even think straight.",
        "Adam: I know, which is why it's really unfair for me to unload all this on you right now. But you know, Gwen, I know there's a lot of trouble between you and Will right now. Maybe things can't get any worse. But maybe they can. I'm just saying, sometimes people go through things like this and they come out stronger, they even come out happier. I believe that. I believe we both can come out much happier, together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: How do you do it?",
        "Jack: Do what?",
        "Katie: All of it. Work, the kids -- and you seem to stay on the sunny side of the street, always.",
        "Jack: The what?",
        "Katie: You're really happy for Margo, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, of course I am. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Katie: Well, didn't you kind of want the job? I mean, don't you feel a little slighted or let down?",
        "Jack: Katie, Margo's my friend. Besides the fact that she has seniority, she deserves it. She's always had my back.",
        "Katie: God, I want to be you when I grow up. [Jack laughs] And I'm really sorry that I was so intense about what's-his-name and Vienna earlier.",
        "Jack: Oh, forget about it.",
        "Katie: It's just that I'm trying to put other people first now and mind my own business.",
        "Jack: Well, what are you going to do with all that spare time on your hands?",
        "Katie: I'm just going to try and be a better person, you know? A better me. Better sister, better friend --",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Katie: It's really important to me to make things up to Parker, if I can.",
        "Jack: Oh, Katie, that's my job.",
        "Katie: I just wish he'd never read my book.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, you try to protect your kids the best you can. But maybe, in the long run, this is better that he knows.",
        "Katie: No, not this way.",
        "Jack: If you hadn't exposed Carly and Simon and what they did with those jewels, something else would have.",
        "Katie: I just hate that it was me.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, don't get too hard on yourself. I've always touted myself on being a good guy, you know?",
        "Katie: You are.",
