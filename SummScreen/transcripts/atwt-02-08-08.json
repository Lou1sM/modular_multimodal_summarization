        "Lily is reunited with her family. Chris wonders if Bob can forgive him? Lucinda is dealing with a lot of guilt; Luke reminds her that she is not to blame, but Lucinda thinks she is. Jack finds some hockey tickets on his desk and decides to take Parker. Sam pretends he is going to say goodbye to Carly, but he has other plans and he talks to Cowboy Jack about his plan with the hockey tickets being sent to Jack. Will and Gwen tell Margo that Sofie is with Hallie in NYC. Hallie spikes a fever and Sofie doesn't know what to do, as she encounters a Police Officer. Holden asks Meg about her spending time with Paul, but she assures him that although she loves Paul, she is not going back to him. Parker thinks Sam is behind the tickets, but Jack thinks he is being ridiculous. Bob forgives Chris, but he thinks Chris should think about relocating since others may not be so forgiving. Holden and Lily talk about second chances and starting over. Carly finds out Sam cancelled the band they booked and not the other way around, and Sam admits to being in love with her. Carly is very upset and explains that they will never be together. Sam promises to leave once he finishes his beer. Sofie calls Chris for help, but hangs up when he explains that Hallie needs to come back to Oakdale Memorial to be examined. Sam becomes aggressive and won't leave without a kiss from Carly. Sam knows no one is waiting for Carly at home. Sofie gets a ride to the airport just as Aaron is running up to her. Aaron calls Will and Gwen to tell them that he lost Sofie again. Meg wants to give Worldwide back to Lucinda, but a guilt-ridden Lucinda doesn't want it. Lily thinks Lucinda should reconsider when someone gives you a second chance. Lucinda finally agrees to take back ownership of her Company. Will and Gwen learn from Chris that Sofie called him and that Hallie is sick. Parker calls Carly when they get home and realize she is not home yet. A scared Carly explains that she is on her way, but Sam physically stops her from leaving. Carly tries to bargain with Sam, but he is infuriated that she has been leading him on and pushes her to the floor and tries to push himself on her. Will and Gwen are with Chris when Sofie shows up back home with a sick Hallie. Holden and Lily talk about getting back together, but there can't be anymore secrets. Lily admits that she has one, but she can't tell him because it would hurt her mother and get him into trouble. Holden decides to trust her and not ask anymore questions. Lily and Holden decide to try again. Sofie is angry with Gwen for changing her mind about letting her be involved in Hallie's life. Gwen takes some of the blame for how she handled this, but she is furious because Sofie took her child. Will shows up with Margo and Sofie is arrested. Carly and Sam struggle, as he violently tries to attack her; someone shoots Sam from behind."

        "Luke: Mom! What happened? [Door closes] I got out of class, and I heard on the news that you and Grandmother were held hostage --",
        "Lily: Everybody's okay. Everything's fine. I'm so glad that you're here. I want us to all be together today.",
        "Luke: Well, they said that the guy who did this was killed. What happened?",
        "Holden: Faith, why don't you take Nat and put a movie on, okay?",
        "Faith: But I want to hear what happened.",
        "Lily: Just go in there, and I'll be in in a minute, okay? We'll watch a movie together? Evan Walsh killed Dusty and another man that was helping him. He used your grandmother and myself as hostages to get away. There was a struggle, and he was killed.",
        "Luke: By who?",
        "Holden: It was an accident. Evan, he was just, he was out of control. He's the one who poisoned Bob Hughes.",
        "Luke: Poison? Like what they found in the syringe?",
        "Holden: And after Dusty had found out what Evan had done --",
        "Luke: Evan killed Dusty. So you're cleared! I knew they'd realize that you were innocent, but I still don't understand why you didn't defend yourself.",
        "Lily: He was protecting me.",
        "Holden: I'm just glad the truth came out.",
        "Lucinda: I hope I'm still welcome in this home.",
        "Luke: Why wouldn't you be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I brought Evan into this hospital. I was so sure memo 21 was important research.",
        "Bob: I knew it was a mistake, but I never thought that Evan Walsh was a murderer.",
        "Chris: Because of me, you almost died.",
        "Bob: Given the substance that he used, I am lucky to be alive. Sadly, Dusty and his colleague were not as fortunate.",
        "Chris: I'll never forgive myself for that. And I don't blame you, Dad, if you can't either. But I'm here to ask you to try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, I don't want to be an intruder at a quality family moment.",
        "Luke: Well last time I checked, you were family. I'm glad you're okay.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey -- thank you, Darling.",
        "Lily: You're always welcome here, Mother.",
        "Faith: We can't get the DVD player to work. Grandma! I'm so glad to see you!",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Sweetie. Hi kids. You stay close to your mom. Stay close to your mom. I left something in the car. I'll be back.",
        "Luke: Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.",
        "Lucinda: Oh!",
        "Luke: Will you tell me what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Forensics report confirms that the substance found in the syringe that killed Evan matches the one that killed Dusty.",
        "Margo: Excellent. So Holden is officially in the clear.",
        "Jack: Sometimes a little reward works better than discipline.",
        "Margo: That's a lovely sentiment, but does it really apply to a murder investigation?",
        "Jack: Two tickets to tonight's hockey game. Are these from you?",
        "Margo: I don't feel I have to buy your love, Jack.",
        "Jack: Okay, who would give me hockey tickets? Oh, maybe they're not for me. Maybe they're for Parker, from his coach. Yeah, he knows that we've been having trouble with him.",
        "Margo: So how's it going with the therapy?",
        "Jack: Oh, it's going. She says that Carly and I need to spend more time with Parker -- as a family.",
        "Margo: Then you should. You should go -- go do that.",
        "Jack: No, I didn't say anything.",
        "Margo: No, you don't have to, really. Honestly. Just seeing what Lily and Holden went through -- it's good to have family around when the chips are down. Go --",
        "Jack: You sure about that? It's not exactly a slow day here.",
        "Margo: Our murderer is dead. He's not going anywhere.",
        "Jack: Well, all right, maybe this'll get through to him. Nothing else has. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sam: I wonder if Jack took the bait.",
        "Cowboy Jack: You better hope so, otherwise that kid's gonna be over here spyin' on his mom, ruining your last chance.",
        "Sam: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Sam: Yeah, I'm just getting things together here, and then I will be out of your hair for good.",
        "Carly: I am sorry that it had to be this way. I think it's best if you move out, and then Kit and I can decide what to do with Metro.",
        "Sam: Understood.",
        "Carly: I guess this is good bye then. I plan on closing early so I can spend some time with Parker.",
        "Sam: Okay.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Excuse me.",
        "Carly: Hello.",
        "Jack: Hey, Carly. Parker's coach gave him two tickets to tonight's hockey game. Now we've got a couple problems -- number one, it's a school night. Number two, he's grounded.",
        "Carly: Does he think it'll help?",
        "Jack: You don't think so?",
        "Carly: Actually, I think it's a great idea. Dr. Seidman said we have to help Parker feel like he's a part of a family again. What better way than a hockey game with his dad, right?",
        "Jack: Thanks, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I owe you Margo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Margo, we've been trying to reach you -- no one would put us through.",
        "Gwen: You told us the police were on this -- now Sofie has our baby somewhere in New York City.",
        "Margo: Wait, wait a minute. How do you know Sofie's in New York City?",
        "Will: She called Aaron, and he took a flight out there, and he found her and Hallie -- and now they're gone again.",
        "Gwen: Please -- too much time is passing. You have to help us find our baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie -- where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "Sofie: Come on, Hallie. Come on. I gave you a bottle. I changed your diaper. What's wrong with you? Oh my God. Oh my God. You're burning up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: That was missing children's division, NYPD. They're putting out an APB.",
        "Gwen: Do you really think they're going to be able to find Sofie based on that photo on Aaron's cell?",
        "Will: Come on, we can still catch a flight to New York.",
        "Margo: No, no. Please, don't do that.",
        "Will: I'm not going to sit here and do nothing while a crazy woman runs off with our daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "Sofie: Mommy's here. Mommy's here. It's going to be okay, I promise. I promise.",
        "NYC cop: Stop right there, Miss. Looks like you've got a problem.",
        "Sofie: I'm fine, Officer. My baby's just a little upset, that's all.",
        "NYC cop: Hold on. [Hallie cries] Your kid looks sick.",
        "Sofie: No, she's okay.",
        "NYC cop: Yeah, you're a doctor?",
        "Sofie: I'm her mother. I can handle this.",
        "NYC cop: Walking around in the cold while she cries her head off?",
        "Sofie: We're just out for some fresh air.",
        "NYC cop: I know what's going on. You don't have insurance, right?",
        "Sofie: I hadn't even thought of that.",
        "NYC cop: It's okay. Any ER has to treat your baby. Hold on a minute and I'll take you there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Grandma, I always know when you're hiding something.",
        "Lucinda: Can I never hide anything from you?",
        "Luke: Well, now that I'm in college, nothing gets by me.",
        "Lucinda: Smarty -- [Luke laughs] I just feel so terribly responsible for this whole ghastly ordeal.",
        "Luke: Why? Because Evan Walsh was your step-grandson, or whatever? Hey, you guys weren't even close.",
        "Lucinda: And I'm smart. I'm smart -- I'm supposed to be smart. I should have anticipated what he was capable of.",
        "Luke: You are smart.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah --",
        "Luke: And nobody could have anticipated this.",
        "Lucinda: I could have. I could have.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Oh, I finally got Ethan down.",
        "Faith: Want to help us make brownies?",
        "Holden: I need to steal Aunt Meg for a minute.",
        "Meg: What is it? Is Lily holding up okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, considering everything that she went through, she's doing great. I saw you at the hospital with Paul.",
        "Meg: Lily was held hostage. She barely escaped with her life, and you're upset I was talking to Paul?",
        "Holden: What did he want?",
        "Meg: He thought he could get me back by getting you off the hook.",
        "Holden: Please tell me it didn't work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Three people died, so many others were hurt.",
        "Chris: I couldn't feel worse.",
        "Bob: I hope you learned something by this.",
        "Chris: I realized I don't have all the answers. I mean, I saw a lot in Darfur, but I have a lot of learn about running a hospital.",
        "Bob: When you do have a passion for your work. But to be a chief of staff, you've got to look at all sides. And have the ability to make tough decisions. And sometimes you -- you disappoint your friends and your colleagues, and sometimes, you make enemies.",
        "Chris: I see that now.",
        "Bob: I believe you do.",
        "Chris: Does that mean you can forgive me?",
        "Bob: Of course I forgive you. I love you. You're my son.",
        "Chris: Dad -- Dad, thank you. You don't know what that means to me. I know I can never make it up to you, but I promise I'm going to try.",
        "Bob: Son, because I can forgive you doesn't mean that other people can. You should seriously think about whether you should stay in Oakdale.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Mommy's trying. Hey -- I don't know what to do. Please just tell me -- tell me how I can help you.",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, how's practice? I went out on a limb and I ordered you a cheeseburger, some fries, and a chocolate shake.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, I hope you got it to go, because if I'm not home in 15 minutes, Mom's going to freak.",
        "Jack: She's going to freak -- oh, coach didn't tell you, did he?",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Jack: Yeah, he was -- he probably didn't want to disappoint you in case we rejected his idea.",
        "Parker: What are you talking about?",
        "Jack: Two tickets to tonight's playoff game, courtesy of Coach Branford.",
        "Parker: That's impossible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm sorry you got caught up in my family problems, Sam. You have been a good friend, and a big help around here. I wish things could have worked out differently.",
        "Sam: Oh, don't worry about it. Things will always turn out for the best.",
        "Carly: Well, I appreciate your positive attitude. Now, I'm going to see if I can balance these books, or there'll won't be any business left to sell.",
        "Sam: Yeah. [Sam sighs] Cowboy, why do I get the feeling that I'm not going to get a goodbye kiss?",
        "Cowboy Jack: It's up to you. It's time to make your move.",
        "Carly: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Okay, there's no way my coach gave you these tickets.",
        "Jack: He left them at the station with a note, Buddy.",
        "Parker: Okay, but you didn't see him or talk to him. Don't you think that's a little weird?",
        "Jack: I worry about anonymous ticking packages left on my desk, not center ice seats. Come on, I thought you'd be thrilled to go to this game.",
        "Parker: But I don't know -- it just -- it doesn't feel right.",
        "Jack: Oh, don't -- don't go there again --",
        "Parker: I think this is Sam.",
        "Jack: No, why? Why can't you just drop it for five minutes? Come on, we're going to be late for the game.",
        "Parker: I need you to believe me, Dad. Sam is up to something. I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You want me to leave Oakdale?",
        "Bob: No -- I didn't say I wanted you to leave. But I think there are others who may have trouble getting past what your mistake has cost this hospital.",
        "Chris: Well, obviously I'll step down as chief of staff. That's your job. But I was hoping to stay on staff here, Dad. I'm still a good doctor.",
        "Bob: Of course you are. But why not start new someplace else -- someplace where it will be easier for you to prove it?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Chris: Excuse me, Dad. Hello, Dr. Hughes.",
        "Sofie: Dr. Hughes, its Sofie Duran.",
        "Chris: Now's not really a good time.",
        "Sofie: Please -- please help me. It's Hallie. I think she has a fever.",
        "Chris: Well, bring her in, I'll have a look at her.",
        "Sofie: I'm not in Oakdale.",
        "Chris: Where are you? Are you with Gwen and Will? Sofie -- please tell me where you are.",
        "Bob: What's going on?",
        "Chris: I don't know. But I'm going to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Look, Guys, I know how hard this is, but believe me, letting the police handle it is the fastest way to find Hallie.",
        "Will: Maybe here, but New York is a huge city. Our missing child report is probably buried on some cop's desk.",
        "Margo: No -- believe me, they take missing minors very seriously. They've got a lot of professional eyes and ears out looking for her.",
        "Gwen: But none of them care as much as we do.",
        "Margo: Well, exactly my point. You're much too emotionally involved. If you go to New York, you're going to end up scaring Sofie off, just like Aaron did. And besides, what if she comes back here?",
        "Gwen: She's right.",
        "Margo: I'm right -- well, go, I'll keep you posted. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "Chris: Hey, Sofie, please don't hang up. I want to help. Okay, babies get fevers all the time, but you have to treat them.",
        "Sofie: Should I get her some baby aspirin or something?",
        "Chris: Well, I can't diagnose this over the phone, I have to see her. And if it's serious, we'll have to admit her and run some tests. Wherever you are you need to bring Hallie home.",
        "Sofie: Oakdale is not Hallie's home anymore. I am her mother and she is with me now.",
        "Chris: The toughest part of being a parent is knowing when your child's needs are more important than your own. So please just tell me --",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Evan Walsh was a psychotic killer.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah --",
        "Luke: You can't be held responsible --",
        "Lucinda: I know, I keep telling myself that, I do, but -- oh, my hand is shaking. Look at that, I -- I could have stopped this.",
        "Luke: No, no, you must be shock, Grandma. Because this is not your fault.",
        "Lucinda: But Darling, I'm on the board. You know, on the board at the hospital, I could have made sure that we delved better into Evan's research, his background, and I could have made sure that Chris didn't forge ahead with this project. Maybe, I could have stopped him, maybe.",
        "Luke: Look, Grandmother, you're not the only person on that board. And nobody saw this coming. So you can't blame yourself.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey. As usual, as usual, you're smarter than your years -- get out of here, go in with your family. Go -- go inside. This family hasn't had anything to celebrate in such a long time. I'm okay.",
        "Luke: Grandma, I want you to remember that you and Mom were the victims. And I am so happy that you got out alive.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, but Dusty wasn't so lucky. Oh, Honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I almost has a child with Paul. That's a connection we'll always have.",
        "Holden: That doesn't mean that you belong with the guy.",
        "Meg: I love Paul, whether you like it or not. But I know I can't go back to him. I am done with self-destructive relationships.",
        "Holden: Good. I'm glad to hear it.",
        "Luke: Grandmother's outside. She doesn't want me to say anything, but she's upset.",
        "Lily: I'll go.",
        "Meg: No, no -- let me. I have something that will help the both of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Sofie: It's okay -- shh.",
        "Cab driver: Do need a ride?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, my baby's sick. I need to get to the airport, but I don't have any money.",
        "Cab driver: Get in.",
        "Sofie: But I can't pay you.",
        "Cab driver: I live in Queens, near the airport. It's on my way.",
        "Sofie: Okay, okay --",
        "Aaron: Sofie! Sofie! Sofie! No.",

        "Sam: Cowboy Jack was just telling me I better get a move on. And he's right. I've got to stop stalling and hit the road here. I don't want to cause you and your son any more problems.",
        "Carly: Thank you. I'm glad you understand.",
        "Sam: So, I'll go upstairs and finish packing.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Carly: Metro.",
        "Singer: Hey, it's Joe from the Redeemers.",
        "Carly: Yeah, sorry, no time for redemption this week.",
        "Singer: No, no -- the Redeemers, the band. We were supposed to play there.",
        "Carly: Oh, it's you. Well, I'm glad -- I've been wanting to talk to you.",
        "Singer: Uh, well we'll forgive you for canceling if you rebook us.",
        "Carly: You'll forgive me? You left me without an act on one of my busiest nights!",
        "Singer: Oh, it was the guy that works for you. It's Sam. He cancelled our gig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I just don't buy into your theory about Sam.",
        "Parker: I'm telling you, this guy is trouble.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. You want to play detective? Riddle me this, if the guy hates you so much, why would he give you outstanding tickets to the game of the year?",
        "Parker: I don't know. Maybe that's how his sick mind works.",
        "Jack: I'm not going to feed into your little obsession anymore. All right, these are outstanding tickets and there's no way I'm letting them go to waste. So, come on, eat up. You're going to have fun tonight whether you like it or not.",
        "Parker: Fine, but could we at least stop at Mom's first? I have to drop off my books.",
        "Jack: Nice try. If it makes you feel any better, we will stop by and check on your mom -- after the game.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: That was Joe from the Redeemers on the phone. He said that he didn't cancel at the last minute, Sam. He said that you fired him. You're not going to deny it?",
        "Sam: I can't. It's true.",
        "Carly: Would you care to explain?",
        "Sam: Yeah.",
        "Carly: I'm waiting.",
        "Sam: I'm in love with you, Carly. These past months, seeing what an amazing woman you are, how strong and caring -- I'm sorry, I just -- I just couldn't help fall for you.",
        "Carly: I had no idea you felt that way.",
        "Sam: Oh, come on. We've had our moments.",
        "Carly: You're with Kit!",
        "Sam: Which is why I thought if I got Kit out of town, something might happen.",
        "Carly: Oh God, you didn't tell Kit that I was leading you on, did you? Because I would never do that.",
        "Sam: No, no, I know, I know. You're too good for that. And I know you would never move in on another woman's guy. I just thought that -- I just thought if we were alone together, get everyone else out of our hair --",
        "Carly: Let me make this perfectly clear to you, Sam! Nothing will ever happen between us. Never. You got that?",

        "Will: What kind of car?",
        "Aaron: I didn't get a good look. Dark sedan -- I didn't see the license plate. But listen, I'm going to keep looking. Okay, but I'm not going to lie to you, she could have gone anywhere.",
