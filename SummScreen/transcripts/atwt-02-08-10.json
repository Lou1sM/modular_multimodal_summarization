        "Janet is a basket case, as it is Liberty's first day of chemo treatment, as Jack tries to offer her support. Liberty tries to be strong, but she is hiding her fears a bit. Carly prepares to go be supportive of Liberty today knowing she has to be near Jack and Janet. Liberty perks up when Carly comes by so they can talk about fashion and sketch since Carly has brought her a sketchpad. Janet puts her own feelings aside and wants Carly to be with Liberty, as she gets her treatments while Janet and Jack wait outside. Susan finds Allison at the hospital and questions as to why she is there. Finally, Allison admits that she needs the morning after pill. Susan realizes Allison slept with Mick and calls her on it. Allison realizes the err of her ways, but she tries to explain what happened even though she isn't quite sure herself. Susan thinks she needs to stay far away from Mick because she doesn't trust him in fact she blames him for Emily's coma. She is worried because if Allison can't say goodbye to Mick without looking back then she shouldn't be getting married. Paul is set to knock Mick out when Barbara tells him that Mick is James. Paul and Emily are shocked but refuse to believe what Barbara and Mick are saying; they believe Mick is simply conning them and Barbara is falling for it. Emily has Mick arrested, but not before Paul pulls out a strand of Mick's hair. Barbara tries to plead Mick's case, but Paul is furious with her and orders her out of his house. Emily goes to share the news of Mick's arrest with Allison, who is guiltily about to take her morning after pill. Allison is stunned and horrified to hear the story, but she is adamant that there is another reason for this. Mick couldn't have done what he did. After Emily leaves, Allison rushes to take her morning after pill. Carly supports Liberty, as they talk about sketching her prom dress, but then Carly asks Janet to sit with her since she thinks she really needs her mother. Carly and Jack bond more, as he is appreciative she came here. Susan tells Carly and Jack about a back-up plan to be put on the bone marrow list in case chemo doesn't work for Liberty. Carly thinks they should do get tested together, as Jack is happy just to be near her too. Mick is at the police station talking about how he wants Paul, his son, around when they get the DNA tests to prove who he is. Janet is not thrilled at first to learn about Jack and Carly got tested, but when she hears it was Susan's idea, she softens and apologizes. Carly says goodbye to Liberty, as she asks her if she still loves Jack. Carly doesn't want her to focus on anything like that now, as Liberty quickly changes the subject and wants to show her something she sketched. Jack promises Janet he will get her through this, as he hugs her when Carly walks out and sees this. Paul and Emily talk about Mick's con and Emily is distraught over the realization that they won't get pregnant. Paul promises her other options, as they hug and Emily worries this isn't over. Paul decides to take Mick's hair to a lab and they will know for once and for all. Allison rushes in to talk with him, as Mick is thrilled. She demands answers, as Mick is a bit cryptic. He promises he has always been honest with her, as he struggles to try to explain. Allison is overwrought because of all they said he did. She needs answers, as Mick seems poised to tell her when a furious Barbara interrupts and orders Allison out. Allison cannot believe he could be James, as Barbara explains that she needs to run along; she knows James because they have decades of history and Allison is nothing to them. Barbara doesn't want Mick to talk anymore, as Mick ends up siding with Barbara and decides he cannot say anymore. Allison leaves, as Mick watches her go intently."

        "Janet: So, one of the scariest side effects is that her white blood cell count could be lowered.",
        "Jack: What does that mean?",
        "Janet: That means she's gonna be more susceptible to infection.",
        "Jack: Okay, I don't want you to worry. Dr. Hearn said he's gonna monitor her very carefully through this entire process.",
        "Janet: Honey, what if she gets the flu while her defense system is down, huh?",
        "Jack: Janet --",
        "Janet: I mean, and then something other than cancer could kill her. It's ridiculous!",
        "Jack: Okay, stop. You've got to -- you've got to stop this. Liberty's first bout of chemo is today. If she sees how scared you are, how is that gonna help her?",
        "Janet: I don't know. But look. Everything I read, every time I learn something, more and more, it gets scarier and scarier.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen, you have to stop reading. Stop reading. Just trust Dr. Hearn. I know you're scared, but you have got to believe that what we're doing is gonna save Liberty's life. She's gonna feel sick. She's gonna feel weak. And yeah, she may lose her hair. But none of that matters if we beat the cancer, right?",
        "Janet: Right.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Janet: I got to snap out of this. I can't let her see me like this. It's ridiculous.",
        "Liberty: It's too late.",
        "Janet: Hi. Honey, you want something to eat? I made you some minestrone soup. I know it's your favorite. And I've got some turkey. I think you should eat a little something. You know, have something.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I'm not hungry, Mom. No, no.",
        "Jack: Well, you should really have something. They say it's important. Hey, listen, I -- I bought you this book. It's the next one in the vampire series you're reading, isn't it?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Thank you, thanks.",
        "Janet: And, hey, I want you to hold onto that, okay, because I'm almost finished with the first book, and I want to know what happens next.",
        "Liberty: What happens next is I'm about to get poison pumped into my body to try and kill something that's trying to kill me. So can we just keep it real, please?",

        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Keep it together, Carly. You're doing this for Liberty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Ali, are you okay? They told me at the nurses' station you were in here.",
        "Alison: Hey, Mom.",
        "Susan: I thought you were off today.",
        "Alison: Uh, yes, I am.",
        "Susan: So why are you here? Something wrong?",
        "Alison: Uh, no, it is nothing for you to worry about.",
        "Susan: You don't sound very convincing. Are you sick?",
        "Alison: No, I am fine.",
        "Susan: Well, you're at the hospital on your day off, waiting in an exam room.",
        "Alison: I'm meeting a friend.",
        "Susan: Ali, if something's wrong, why don't you just tell me? Because you know I'm just gonna nose around anyway until I find out.",
        "Alison: Okay. Fine. I'm here because I need the morning-after pill.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Didn't you hear me? Let him go! He's your father!",
        "Paul: What did you just say?",
        "Barbara: Mick is James. He's your father.",
        "Paul: Are you joking?",
        "Mick: It's true, Paul.",
        "Paul: I -- I don't even know how to respond to this.",
        "Barbara: I know it sounds insane.",
        "Paul: No, yeah, it -- it does. Completely insane, and desperate.",
        "Mick: This isn't how I wanted you to find out, Son.",
        "Paul: Oh, don't stop it. Don't call me that. You can drop the act, Mick. This is it? This -- this is the best that you can come up with?",
        "Barbara: I swear he's telling the truth. He's your father.",
        "Paul: My father is dead.",
        "Barbara: No, he's not!",
        "Paul: Have you completely lost your mind?",
        "Mick: What do you think you've been paying for the past few months? I've discovered treatments that reverse the aging process.",
        "Paul: This is it?",
        "Mick: I'm proof it actually works.",
        "Paul: This is your big scam, pretending to be a guy who deserves to be dead?",
        "Mick: Well, I'd like to rectify that, Paul. I've come to make up for the damage that I've done.",
        "Paul: The damage that James has done.",
        "Barbara: He's telling the truth. Everything checked out -- the fingerprints, the scars. Everything matches. He is James Stenbeck. There is no question.",
        "Paul: Are you buying any of this?",
        "Emily: Not for a second.",
        "Paul: Me either.",
        "Barbara: Oh, oh! Stop it, Paul! Leave him alone!",
        "Paul: Stay out of this, Mother. This is between us.",
        "Barbara: You're making a mistake.",
        "Paul: Now, my mother may have fallen for your nonsense, and you may have fooled my wife for a short while, but it stops here. It ends with me.",
        "Mick: Look into my eyes, Paul. It's me. Look past this young face. It's James.",
        "Paul: All I see is a pathetic con man trying to take all of my money.",
        "Mick: No.",
        "Barbara: He's not after your money!",
        "Paul: You preyed on my mother's vanity, and you -- you preyed on my wife's desire to have a child. That is sick. You are sick.",
        "Mick: Everything I've offered them is legitimate, and I am proof.",
        "Paul: No you're not. You don't even look like my father.",
        "Mick: It's an imperfect process.",
        "Paul: You're either a liar -- or you're insane. Either way, I want you out of my house and away from my family.",
        "Barbara: Let him prove to you he is who he says he is.",
        "Paul: How is he gonna do that, Mother? How? There is nothing that he could say or do that would prove to me that he is the reincarnation of James Stenbeck.",
        "Mick: Yes, there is, Paul. Just give me one chance -- one chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Have you talked with Casey?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Susan: Well, don't you think you should if you two are about to get married.",
        "Alison: Mom, I don't want to have a discussion about this, okay? I've already made up my mind. This is what I have to do, okay? So just please leave it alone.",
        "Susan: Oh, Ali, it wasn't Casey, was it?",
        "Alison: Mom --",
        "Susan: Oh. Here we go again.",
        "Alison: I made a mistake.",
        "Susan: Yeah, you sure did. And it's not the first time you've made a mistake like this, is it?",
        "Alison: Oh, great. Right, right. Just bring on the judgmental attitude. That's what you're best at.",
        "Susan: Well, how do you expect me to react? You're about to get married. How many times have you told me how much you love Casey a -- and how -- how ready you are to make a lifelong, serious commitment?",
        "Alison: I was. I am.",
        "Susan: Then why did you sleep with somebody else?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Susan: Who was it?",
        "Alison: It doesn't matter.",
        "Susan: It was Mick Dante, wasn't it?",
        "Alison: Why would you even assume that?",
        "Susan: Because Barbara Ryan told me that there was something going on between you two.",
        "Alison: There isn't.",
        "Susan: Except the sex part.",
        "Alison: It was one time.",
        "Susan: Well, that's all it takes.",
        "Alison: Mom, don't you think I feel terrible about this?",
        "Susan: I know you do. But that's not the point.",
        "Alison: Then what is the point?",
        "Susan: If this is what you're doing now, then I'm sorry, but you're not ready to get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, why don't you show me some of the styles you like in here? Carly says you're really good at design.",
        "Liberty: Not right now.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on. It will be a nice distraction.",
        "Liberty: I said no, Mom, okay? I -- I really don't want to read a book or pick out my new cancer wardrobe. I just want this whole stupid thing to be over with. I am gonna go to the bathroom.",
        "Janet: Do you want me to go with you?",
        "Liberty: No. I think I can handle it.",
        "[Jack groans]",
        "Jack: I wish I could say it's gonna get easier, but I don't think it will.",
        "Janet: Well, it's not exactly what I wanted to hear.",
        "Jack: You're doing great.",
        "Janet: Am I? 'Cause I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I can't show her that I'm scared, and I'm not doing cheerful very well, either. I don't have a whole lot of options.",
        "Jack: Just be honest. I think that's what Liberty needs more than anything else right now. She -- she needs to know that it's okay to be scared.",
        "[Liberty sobs]",
        "Janet: I just wish she would let me be a mother and comfort her.",
        "Jack: It will happen.",
        "[Janet sighs]",
        "Janet: I'm not so sure.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen, the deeper you get into this, the more she's gonna need you. You know that. You got to be ready. You can't give up on yourself.",
        "Janet: I won't, as long as you don't give up on me, either.",
        "Jack: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Liberty: Carly.",
        "Carly: Oh, hi.",
        "Liberty: Hi.",
        "Carly: I -- I wasn't sure if you'd gone in for your treatment yet or not.",
        "Liberty: No, no. They're torturing me by making me wait. It's cruel. What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: I -- I brought you a little care package -- just some stuff to sketch with. I wasn't sure if you'd want it now or --",
        "Liberty: That's really nice. Thank you. I wouldn't show my mom. I don't think she's be too happy about it.",
        "Carly: It was her idea, actually.",
        "Liberty: But she was so upset about the idea of us working together.",
        "Carly: Well, it's not work, really. It will just be fun. And if something comes of it down the road, who knows?",
        "Liberty: Cool. Thank you so much, really.",
        "Carly: It is my pleasure.",
        "Liberty: Hey, so you want to stick around for a little while?",
        "Carly: If you'd like me to, sure.",
        "Liberty: I really would.",
        "Janet: Hi, Carly.",
        "Carly: Hello. Jack.",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Carly: Uh, I brought some sketching stuff for Liberty so she can get a little work done.",
        "Liberty: She said it was your idea, Mom.",
        "Janet: Well, I'm all for, uh, you know, whatever keeps you positive throughout all this.",
        "Nurse: We're ready for you now, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Oh. So you'll stick around while all this is happening, right?",
        "Carly: Uh, I don't know.",
        "Janet: Oh, I -- I think it's a great idea, you know, if you have time.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Carly: Of course. Sure.",
        "Liberty: Right. Fantastic.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Janet: Liberty --",
        "Liberty: Yeah?",
        "Janet: If you need anything, we'll be right here.",
        "Liberty: Mom -- everything's gonna be fine, okay? I'm gonna be fine. Okay.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Jack: You, uh -- you sure you're okay?",
        "Janet: It doesn't matter if I am or not. What matters is that Liberty is.",
        "Liberty: Hey, I have an idea. I think I might start sketching my prom dress.",
        "Carly: That's a great idea.",
        "Liberty: I know! I'm so excited. Okay. 'Cause I've been thinking a lot about it, and it was something that's, like, really light and flowy so that when I'm dancing -- I mean, you can picture me, right?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Liberty: I'm, like, tearing it up on the dance -- ow.",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Liberty: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.",
        "Carly: Nurse.",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry. That hurt. Did I mess something up?",
        "Nurse: No, you didn't knock the I.V. out. But you need to keep your arm still, okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Carly: You all right? All right, well, keep telling me about this dress. Just, uh, use the other arm, okay?",
        "Liberty: No, that was it. Just, you know, something light and flowy.",
        "Carly: It sounds good. What kind of fabric are you imagining? What color?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. Might not even make it to prom.",
        "Janet: I remember when Liberty was born. She was so tiny. I was afraid to pick her up. I was afraid I was gonna break her. And I knew right then and there that the most important thing was keeping her safe and taking care of her. And I have spent her entire life trying to do just that.",
        "Jack: And you've done a wonderful job. She's who she is because of you.",
        "Janet: Then why can't I handle it now?",
        "Jack: Okay, don't sell yourself short, Janet. You're here. You're with her. You're getting her the best treatment available. There's nothing else you can be doing. She knows that.",
        "Janet: Uh, how is she? Is she okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, she's good. She's all right. I just, uh -- she needs her mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: What does this mean really mean to you, anyway?",
        "Alison: Casey? I love him.",
        "Susan: I'm talking about Mick Dante.",
        "Alison: Mick and I are -- we're friends.",
        "Susan: Friends, with benefits?",
        "Alison: Mom, will you please stop with that?",
        "Susan: I'm sorry. Uh, explain. I'll keep quiet, I promise.",
        "Alison: We would just meet up, and we'd talk. I mean, he's lived as a confused life as I have, and we connected.",
        "Susan: Kindred spirits. Is that it?",
        "Alison: In a way.",
        "Susan: And as a kindred spirit, did he press you to have sex with him?",
        "Alison: No, it wasn't like that. It just -- it happened. It -- it surprised us both. But I had been thinking about him a lot, and worrying and even, um, dreaming about him.",
        "Susan: Oh --",
        "Alison: Mom, I don't know how to explain it, okay? It just -- it's like when I'm with him, it's -- it's just unreal. It's like -- it's like I'm there, but it's not really me, like sort of an out-of-body experience.",
        "Susan: Well, has he been giving you anything, like pills or those injections he's been giving Emily?",
        "Alison: No, no, it's not like that at all!",
        "Susan: Are you absolutely, 100% sure?",
        "Alison: Yes. Why would you even ask me that?",
        "Susan: Because I'm not convinced that he didn't cause Emily's coma.",
        "Alison: He didn't. He was the one who figured out what was wrong with her.",
        "Susan: I don't trust him. And I am very worried that you're this involved with him, especially now.",
        "Alison: Mom, I'm obviously not going to sleep with him again.",
        "Susan: I don't think you should ever see him again. Just turn your back on the guy and focus on the one that you're gonna marry.",
        "Alison: I want to do that. I want that more than anything.",
        "Susan: Good, because if Casey finds out that you slept with Mick, you're gonna lose him, and that would be terrible for you.",
        "Alison: He is not gonna find out, okay? He can't.",
        "Susan: You better pray that's true. I'm gonna write a prescription for the morning-after pill. You can pick it up downstairs at the pharmacy. My advice -- take it and don't look back.",
        "Alison: Thanks for the advice.",
        "Susan: I mean it. I'm serious. Your whole life's on the line here. If you can't let go of Mick without a second thought, then don't get married. Don't do that to Casey. Don't do that to yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: I came back to Oakdale for you, Paul. I thought if I could approach you as someone else and win your trust that way that I had a better shot.",
        "Paul: You say you came back to Oakdale for me, but you left Oakdale in a coffin.",
        "Mick: Well, how many times have I eluded death before? You must admit I am good at it.",
        "Paul: James was good at it. But you're not James.",
        "Mick: I am James. Soon you'll accept that.",
        "Paul: Don't hold your breath.",
        "Mick: I know that I've done horrible things to you, to your mother, to Emily. Blackmail --",
        "Paul: Rattling off statistics isn't gonna convince me.",
        "Mick: Do you know what it was like for me the last time I was here, to lay on my deathbed and realize that my son wanted me to die? What kind of man could make his son hate him so much?",
        "Paul: Well, if you have to ask that, you're not my father.",
        "Mick: When I realized that I could have a second chance to come back here with you and make up for the things that I'd done wrong, I had to at least try.",
        "Emily: Well, you tried and you failed, and now your little game is over. That's him.",
        "Cop: Mick Dante -- you're under arrest.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Emily, you've got to be kidding me.",
        "Emily: Sorry, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: What are the charges?",
        "Paul: Fraud, assault, impersonating a lunatic.",
        "Mick: These handcuffs won't hide the truth, Paul.",
        "Paul: What do you know about the truth? Get him out of here, will you?",
        "Barbara: Don't do this, Paul. Don't do this.",
        "Mick: Its okay, Barbara. He has to do what he has to do.",
        "Paul: Hey, you know what? I do. Hold on a second.",
        "Mick: Second thoughts?",
        "Paul: No, not so much. Get him out of here.",
        "Barbara: You do realize that your only chance of getting pregnant was just arrested?",
        "Emily: Would you stop it, Barbara? Wake up! It was never possible. It was all part of his stupid scam. He fooled us all.",
        "Barbara: No. No, he didn't. It was real. The treatments were real.",
        "Paul: There is no way that that kid is my father.",
        "Emily: I -- I got to go. I got to warn Alison.",
        "Barbara: She has nothing to do with this.",
        "Emily: She thinks they're friends. She needs to know to stay away from him.",
        "Paul: Sorry. And he'll pay. I swear he'll pay.",
        "Emily: He better.",
        "Paul: Ma, how long have you known?",
        "Barbara: That he's James?",
        "Paul: That he was pretending to be James.",
        "Barbara: A few weeks.",
        "Paul: It didn't occur to you to clue me in on the -- the little joke?",
        "Barbara: Your father wanted to tell you in his own time.",
        "Paul: He's not my father. Stop calling him that. But he's just as bad. And you -- you let him into my home, and he built up Emily's hopes, and he put her in the hospital. You give me one good reason why I shouldn't throw you in jail right next to that bastard?",

        "Alison: \"I'm off to get my tux fitted. Love you, Case.\"",

        "Alison: Hey, what's up?",
        "Emily: I've got some news you're not gonna like.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Emily: Mick Dante was just arrested.",
        "Alison: Why? What happened?",
        "Emily: He's the one who put me in the coma. He's been lying to all of us. He's not who he says he is.",
        "Alison: Slow down. What do you mean, he put you in the coma? That's impossible.",
        "Emily: Alison, trust me, he's responsible.",
        "Alison: I -- I don't understand. What -- what happened?",
        "Emily: The day I blacked out, I found a bunch of pictures from a file from his bag. They were pictures of Paul at different stages of his life. He had an entire dossier on Paul.",
        "Alison: So? That doesn't mean anything. Paul's his investor. He's probably just checking up on him.",
        "Emily: That's funny. That's exactly what he said when I confronted him.",
        "Alison: When was that?",
        "Emily: The day I collapsed. Of course, he denied he was doing anything wrong, but I pressed him for the truth because I didn't believe him, and he finally admitted it. He wasn't who he said he was. And then suddenly, everything went black.",
        "Alison: Where was this?",
        "Emily: Out at All Angel's Church. He was up in the bell tower. I don't know what he was doing up there. God only knows.",
        "Alison: Oh, my --",
        "[Emily sighs]",
        "Emily: And the next thing I know, I'm waking up in the hospital, days later.",
        "Alison: Because you passed out. It was -- it was -- it was because of the mixture of the herbal supplements and -- and Mick's injections. You -- you can't blame him for that.",
        "Emily: Alison, there's something else.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Emily: He's claiming to be James Stenbeck.",
        "Alison: James Stenbeck? What? That's crazy. He's dead.",
        "Emily: I'm not saying it's true. I'm just telling you that's who he's claiming to be.",
        "Alison: James Stenbeck? I -- what? I don't understand. Why would he -- why would he say that?",
        "Emily: I don't know. Maybe he's lost his mind.",
        "Alison: No, no. None of this makes sense. Mick is a good guy. I know he's a little off.",
        "Emily: Alison, listen to me. Mick Dante is a con man. He fooled us all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Here you go.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: You're welcome. I'm glad you're here. Although it's killing me, seeing you.",
        "Carly: Don't. Talking about it, acknowledging it just makes it worse.",
        "Susan: Carly, Jack, hi.",
        "Carly: Hi, Susan.",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Susan: Is this where Liberty is getting her, uh, uh, chemo treatment?",
        "Jack: Yeah. She's in there with her mother right now.",
        "[Susan sighs]",
        "Susan: How is she holding up?",
        "Jack: Scared. It's her first session.",
        "Susan: I'm praying for her.",
        "Jack: Thank you. We all are.",
        "Susan: Well, she's in good hands with Dr. Hearn. But -- and hopefully it won't come to this, but, uh --",
        "Jack: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I don't know. To keep his scam going, I suppose.",
        "Alison: So none of it's true? The drug treatments, the possibility that you would be able to get pregnant -- it was all a lie?",
        "Emily: Yeah. I just can't believe it took this to make me realize it.",
        "Alison: Em, I'm so sorry. I mean, I know you had your heart set on the treatments working.",
        "Emily: Thanks. But don't worry. Mick's gonna pay for what he did to everybody, I promise.",
        "Alison: This is all my fault.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Alison: I -- I was the one who brought him to you.",
        "Emily: Nobody blames you.",
        "Alison: Well, I should have known. I should have figured this out.",
        "Emily: How could you?",
        "Alison: Because I was -- I was close to him. He -- he opened up. He -- he told me things.",
        "Alison: What things?",
        "Alison: He said that he was conflicted inside, that he felt like he had these two opposing forces fighting inside him.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Sane and insane. [Emily groans] Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to dump all this on you, but I really thought you needed to know.",
        "Alison: Well, I did. Thanks.",
        "Emily: You gonna be okay? Do you want to come back with me? I got to go back to Paul.",
        "Alison: Uh, no. I -- I have some things I have to take care of.",
        "Emily: Okay. Come here. I promise, nobody blames you, Ali. He used all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: You're all gonna be in for a surprise when these prints are tested and matched. Make sure my son Paul is here when the results get back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, I am glad we did that. I hope it's not necessary, of course, but --",
        "Carly: Yeah, of course.",
        "Jack: You okay? You look a little pale.",
        "Carly: No, I'm fine. I'm good. I'm -- whenever I get blood drawn, I -- get a little woozy.",
        "Jack: You sure? Well -- why don't you let me take you to the cafeteria, and I'll grab you a soup or a salad or something like that?",
        "Carly: No. That's not necessary.",
        "Jack: See, I disagree.",
        "Carly: Jack, I'm not your concern.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: Oh!",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I had a hard time accepting this, too.",
        "Paul: And yet you did. I can accept the fact, Mother, that James might have been behind all of this, some kind of last laugh from the grave. His mistake was going after me. He should have gone after his other son. He should have gone after Henry. Henry he could have fooled the way he fooled you.",
        "Barbara: This isn't about Henry. This is about you, about making amends, about starting over with a clean slate.",
        "Paul: Mom, how can you be so naive, so -- so all of the sudden?",
        "Barbara: And you are so blind to an amazing possibility.",
        "Paul: No, Mom. You're the one who's blind. He lured you in, and you fell for it because of your own desperate need to feel young again.",
        "Barbara: I do feel young again. I am younger. The treatments are working.",
        "Paul: No, they're not, Mom. They're not. Mick didn't turn back the clock. You're older now than when you met Mick, and I'm poorer now than when I met Mick.",
        "Barbara: People have told me that they see a change in me. You've told me that I look younger. Isn't that what you've said?",
        "Paul: I was being polite. To me, you just look like a fool. And I need for you to get out of my house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: I knew you'd come. Who, uh, told you? Emily tell you? She didn't waste any time. I can explain to you everything, whatever you want to know.",
        "Alison: Just tell me one thing. Who the hell are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I know it's not the most nutritious snack, but, uh, chocolate is medicinal in some cultures, you know?",
        "Carly: It's good.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Carly: You want a bite?",
        "Jack: No, thank you. Feel better?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Thanks.",
        "Jack: How's she doing?",
        "Janet: She's okay. She's resting. She's almost finished for the day. Where did you guys go?",
        "Jack: Uh, we went to have some blood drawn to see if we're a match for a bone- marrow transplant.",
        "Janet: Why would you do that?",
        "Jack: Just a safety net, in case.",
        "Janet: In case what? The chemo fails? You're already jumping to conclusions? This is her first session.",
        "Jack: No. No, I -- I know that. We just thought --",
        "Janet: You just thought -- \"We.\" You and Carly. I asked you to come here to support Liberty, not instill more fear.",
        "Carly: Janet, it's not like that.",
        "Janet: What was it like then, huh? You're already acting like the chemo is gonna fail, it's not gonna work.",
        "Jack: No, it was Susan Stewart's idea. She said all the families should get tested, just in case. It might not be necessary. God willing, it won't be. I'm just trying to cover all the bases here, Janet.",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Carly: I'm gonna go. Just gonna say good-bye to Liberty.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey. I was just about to try and call you again.",
        "Emily: Oh, I'm sorry. I should have -- I should have called.",
        "Paul: Don't worry about it. Hey.",
        "Emily: How's your mother?",
        "Paul: I threw her out.",
        "Emily: Good.",
        "Paul: How's Ali?",
        "Emily: How do you think? She freaked out.",
        "Paul: She did?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, he suckered all of us, even me.",
        "Emily: No. That's not true. You were suspicious about him from the very beginning.",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah. That's why I gave him boatloads of money and let him shoot you up with God knows what.",
        "Emily: No, you know what? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm sure it was nothing toxic. Otherwise, it would have -- it would have shown up in my blood work, right?",
        "Paul: Well, maybe we should check again, just to be sure.",
        "Emily: I feel perfectly healthy. Why did he do it?",
        "Paul: For money.",
        "Emily: I don't mean -- I don't mean the scam. Why pretend to be James? Did he really think you were gonna believe something so ridiculous?",
        "Paul: Doesn't matter. Maybe James did plan this before he died. That's what he did. He hurt people.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but he's dead. Where's the payoff?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. All that matters now is that it's over.",
        "Emily: Is it? Paul, there's no way this could be true?",
        "Paul: What could be true?",
        "Emily: That Mick really is your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Damn it, answer me. Who the hell are you really?",
        "Mick: There's no easy answer to that.",
        "Alison: You told Paul and Emily that you're James Stenbeck, but that's impossible. He's dead, and you're more than 30 years younger than him. So why would you lie about that? You owe me the truth. Please. I've seen how tortured you are inside. I know how much pain you're in. Unless that was a lie, as well.",
        "Mick: No. No, no, no, no, no. Alison, I never lied to you about anything. You are the only person that I've been completely honest with, no matter what.",
        "Alison: Then tell me the truth now, please. You're not James Stenbeck. You can't be. He -- he was a monster. I mean, the things he did to people -- he was a murderer. Why would you lie about that? What's really going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hi. Must have dozed off.",
        "Carly: I just wanted to let you know that I'm gonna go. But I'm gonna call you very soon, because we have to work on that prom dress, right?",
        "Liberty: Yes. Thank you, Carly. Could I ask you a question?",
        "Carly: Of course.",
        "Liberty: Are you still in love with Jack?",
        "Carly: Uh -- no, Liberty, don't -- don't worry about that right now. You just rest, okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Carly: I'll see you soon.",
        "Liberty: Wait, no. Just stay a few more minutes. I really want to show you something I've been working on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I hate to think there's even a possibility that the chemo won't work.",
        "Jack: We have every reason to believe it will. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't have a backup plan.",
        "Janet: She has to survive this.",
        "Jack: I know. We'll help her through it. Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What are you gonna do with that?",
        "Paul: DNA testing. And once the lab proves that Mick Dante isn't James Stenbeck, they'll both be out of our lives for good.",
        "Emily: I hope you're right.",
        "Paul: If it weren't so sick, I might laugh. You okay?",
        "Emily: I was so sure, you know? I was so happy. I really thought we were gonna be able to have a baby.",
        "Paul: I could kill him for what he put you -- what he put us through.",
        "Emily: It's not ever gonna happen for us, is it?",
        "Paul: Hey, don't say that. There's plenty of other options. And I'm not gonna give up. You gonna give up?",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Emily: I don't know what else I can do.",
        "Paul: Well, we'll figure something out. We still have each other. Nobody can take that away from us, not Mick, not James, not even my mother. Come here. We still have each other, so we win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: I need you to do something for me, Alison.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Mick: Trust me. You are the only person that's been really able to talk to me, to understand me, to understand what I've been through. That connection that we shared -- that's real. That's honest.",
        "Alison: How do I know that? How do I know that's true, Mick, when I just found out that everything else about you is a lie?",
        "Mick: Okay. Remember -- remember when I told you that there's like a battle going on inside between who I think I should be and who I really want to be?",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Mick: That -- that is at the heart of what's going on right now.",
        "Alison: You know, I really want to believe you, Mick, but how could you do what you did to Emily, to Paul? You lied about the treatments. You made them believe that they could have a baby.",
        "Mick: There's so much more going on here than you can imagine.",
        "Alison: Then tell me, please.",
        "Barbara: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Alison: Do you know he's claiming to be James Stenbeck?",
        "Barbara: He is James Stenbeck, and you have no part in this, so get out.",
        "Mick: Barbara, calm down.",
        "Alison: You don't honestly believe that he --",
        "Barbara: What I believe is of no consequence to you. I have decades of history with James, and you're just a blip on his radar. So get lost. Go marry Casey Hughes. Be a good little wife and stick to things you understand.",
        "Alison: Mick, please, tell me.",
        "Barbara: Don't say another word. There's a lawyer outside who wants to talk to you. And I'm not gonna ask you to leave again.",
        "Alison: Mick, please.",
        "Mick: I think Barbara's right. I should talk to my lawyer.",
        "Alison: So that's how it's gonna be?",
        "Mick: Yes.",

        "Holden: I'm your father!",
        "Meg: Are you afraid of me?",
