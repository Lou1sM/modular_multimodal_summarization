        "Dusty tells Sierra about a plan he has to open a family spa in California. She says she likes the idea, but she needs to go with him to check it out. He gets defensive and says he doesn't need her to hold his hand. She insists that is not the case, this is just a business risk and she would like to be involved. Katie and Margo look outside to see Henry sobbing on the porch. Katie realizes that she is breaking his heart, as he's obviously much more attached to her than she realized. Margo warns she should break it off. When she tries to do so, Henry insists he knows that this is all for Mike and he doesn't care. He continues to make wedding plans. Katie begins to cry when she sees how much Henry cares for her.",

        "Dusty: We can finance it by selling your mining interests out west, which give you a marginal profit anyway. We take this one spot in California, use it as a model for our franchise, and we build from there.",
        "Sierra: A family spa?",
        "Dusty: State of the art facilities for everyone, child care, nutritionists, personal trainers, weight room, pool room, track -- everything. It's a straight deal. And potentially, a huge money maker for Worldwide. What do you say?",
        "Craig: Well, I found out Jennifer Munson can actually smell coffee. She's gonna work with us.",
        "Sierra: Uh, that's great, but do you mind giving us a second? Dusty and I are right in the middle of something.",
        "Craig: Sure. I can come back.",
        "Sierra: I love this project.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I'll be late tonight.",
        "Jennifer: Wedding renovations.",
        "Mike: Got to get Katie and Henry to the gym on time, wedding or not.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, I think there's gonna be a wedding. It's kind of too big for it just to be a ploy.",
        "Mike: You don't know Katie. There's no ploy too big when she's trying to prove a point. I'll call you. Oh, I don't believe it.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Mike: Katie never gave me back my paint samples, which means I've got to go to the cottage and pick them up. But of course, she already knew that.",
        "Jennifer: Sounding a little paranoid, Mike.",
        "Mike: I'll work on that. See you soon.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jennifer: Jennifer Munson.",
        "Craig: Jennifer, its Craig Montgomery. Where are you?",
        "Jennifer: Metro.",
        "Craig: Stay. I'll be right there. I've got an idea for your new line I think you're going to like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Look at him. That's Henry Coleman. He's supposed to be the most shallow, self-involved freeloader on earth. And look at him? Do you have any idea what that man has done for me?",
        "Margo: So, it's nothing new.",
        "Katie: I know, but this wedding -- he has gone out of his way to make every detail perfect, just the way I would want it, even though he knows that I'm praying it won't happen. Oh, my God, this is breaking his heart. I'm breaking his heart. Go ahead, say it.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no.",
        "Katie: No, you warned me about this.",
        "Margo: Well, at least you see it now, huh?",
        "Katie: Margo, what am I gonna do?",
        "Margo: The only thing you can do -- call this wedding off now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Phyllis, Rosanna's car still isn't in the driveway. Have you seen her?",
        "Phyllis: Not since she left for the police station.",
        "Paul: She should be back by now. I'm sorry. Thank you. Hey, it's Paul, again. Listen, it's late, and I thought you'd be back by now, so call me when you get this, all right? I'm starting to worry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Is anyone going to answer my question? What are you doing here, Rosanna?",
        "Barbara: The same thing that you're doing here -- harassing me. And you know what? I won't take it from either one of you. I am not going to plead guilty to crimes I did not commit.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I -- I couldn't leave without trying.",
        "Emily: She's a waste of breath. I already told you that.",
        "Rosanna: But she's a mother, too, Emily. That's what I find so hard to forgive. You know I have a child that I lost, and I would do anything if I could just hold him again. And here you are with the chance to do the right thing, the one thing that would get your children back, and -- oh.",
        "Emily: Rosanna?",
        "Emily: Rosanna, sit down.",
        "Rosanna: Oh.",
        "Emily: Take a deep breath. Are you okay? Can I get you something?",
        "Barbara: Oh, spare me.",
        "Emily: I think a glass of water would be nice, but that's all I need.",
        "Emily: Okay, all right. I'll go get it. Just ignore her.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, Barbara, listen to me. We don't have much time. I think I can get you out from these charges, and then I can get my son back, but I have to convince Emily that I am the one who drugged her, not you.",
        "Barbara: Well, you're gonna have to use the drug again to do it.",
        "Rosanna: That's right.",
        "Barbara: Okay, remember, Tamekamine. Tamekamine in the tea with honey to mask the flavor.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Barbara: Just go slowly. Make sure there's enough in her system so she doesn't walk out on you.",
        "Rosanna: I'll handle it.",
        "Barbara: Well, you'd better, or I'm gonna be spending the rest of my life in here.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no. It'll work. I'll convince Emily that I'm the one that drugged her, you'll go free, and I'll get my son back.",
        "Barbara: It has to work.",
        "Rosanna: Remember, you can't breathe a word about this to anyone.",
        "Barbara: Who do I talk to these days?",
        "Emily: Rosanna, here.",
        "Rosanna: Oh.",
        "Emily: Drink up.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Oh. Oh, yes. Wow, that really helps. I should go. Thank you so much for the water.",
        "Emily: Oh, sure. Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Emily: Get home safely.",
        "Rosanna: I will. Okay, thank you.",
        "Emily: Sure. It's just you and me.",
        "[Barbara laughs]",
        "Barbara: My favorite thing.",
        "Emily: You're gonna sign the deal, Barbara. I'll make sure of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Dr. Silverman, I need a favor, and I need your absolute discretion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I can't call off the wedding. It's too late.",
        "Margo: You just said that you don't want to break Henry's heart anymore. You can't keep using him like this.",
        "Katie: I'm not using him -- I mean -- I didn't mean to use him, Margo. I never -- oh, my God, I can't believe I never realized this before. I mean, I love Henry and he loves me, I just didn't think he was in love with me.",
        "Margo: Katie, the guy had himself committed to a mental institution because he wanted to keep an eye out for you. Are you telling me you honestly didn't know his heart?",
        "Katie: Well, he almost said something once, but then -- we didn't want to ruin what we had.",
        "Margo: Well, you could now.",
        "Katie: But the wedding was Henry's idea, all of it. Not mine! I mean, he's -- he's worked so hard to make every detail perfect. He loves the idea of a wedding day.",
        "Margo: Because he thinks that you guys will have a happily ever after. Look, if you think that you could hurt him now by calling the wedding off, imagine how he's gonna feel when you drop him dead at the altar, huh? Katie, do it now.",
        "Henry: Hey, there's my beautiful bride to be. It's cold out there. I just remembered a very critical detail, and I hope it's not too late. Yeah, hello, this is Henry Coleman, the Coleman/Paretti wedding. I'm just calling about the status of that wisteria. Yeah, yeah, I was serious. I realize it's not in season here, but I am sure, sweetheart, that is in season somewhere in the world, okay?",
        "Margo: Good luck. I'll return the dresses later.",
        "Henry: What? Gardenias? That is -- that is so '80s nouveau. No, no, no. What? White carnations? That is very sturdy of you, ma'am. Listen to me, listen to me. Hello, hello, my fianc\u00e9 wants wisteria, and wisteria it shall be, all right? Money is no object, I'm not worried about it, you shouldn't worry about it. Get them on a plane. Good, good, I'm glad to hear that. All right? Just call me within the hour. All right, thank you. This is fun!",
        "Katie: Henry, how did you know that I used to love wisteria?",
        "Henry: You told me.",
        "Katie: I did? Maybe once in passing.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no. It was -- it was a lovely, long, intricate tale, and wisteria had a cameo part in it. You were seven, and you were dreaming about the home that you would own one day, and you had bowers of wisteria.",
        "Katie: How did you remember that?",
        "Henry: You say it, I remember it. Hey, look. I get my dreams, you get yours. Fair is fair.",
        "Katie: This wedding? That's your dream?",
        "Henry: What? What is it?",
        "Katie: Um -- about the wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I know you're not sure if we can work together, but I think this idea will settle it.",
        "Jennifer: So what's the idea?",
        "Craig: Television. The buyers we're after don't exactly subscribe to glamorous magazines. They don't care about underfed, overdressed models in Milan.",
        "Jennifer: Uh-huh. But they will love Mike Kasnoff.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. Mike Kasnoff is over.",
        "Jennifer: What -- what are you talking about? He's a huge hit.",
        "Craig: Well, in print maybe, but we're talking about a whole new medium here. We're talking about the talkies. We need a star, and I know exactly what kind of star.",
        "Jennifer: Really? Well, what kind?",
        "Craig: Nashville.",
        "Jennifer: Country music?",
        "Craig: Country music.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Yeah, it's great, Craig, but you know, it's really not the kind of music I associate with Street Jeans.",
        "Craig: Well, that's what the TV does. You put the right picture and the right sound behind your product, you're in a whole new \"jean\" pool. Millions of potential consumers who didn't even know you existed -- and that's right, I said millions.",
        "Jennifer: You think we can sell this idea to Sierra?",
        "Craig: Well, I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: I think this franchise idea is a winner.",
        "Dusty: If it's done correctly. The spa is located right here. We buy it, we own the concept, we're golden.",
        "Sierra: Well, I think we should go see it in person, make sure it's as good as it looks on paper.",
        "Dusty: I can be on a plane tomorrow.",
        "Sierra: Well, we'll both go.",
        "Dusty: Say again?",
        "Sierra: Well, I think I need to see it for myself. Don't you? Dusty?",
        "Dusty: I don't need my hand held, if that's what you mean. I don't work that way.",
        "Sierra: You know, I'm not going to Napa to supervise or second guess you. Really, I have complete faith in you. It has nothing to do with that.",
        "Dusty: I noticed that Craig has a lot of free reign around here.",
        "Sierra: That's because he took over an already established business. What you're talking about is starting from scratch, and that's riskier than what Worldwide usually does.",
        "Dusty: I thought that was the point -- pushing the envelope.",
        "Sierra: It is, but I want to be able to look my mother in the eye and tell her that I saw it myself, and I am completely, 100% behind it.",
        "Dusty: I get it.",
        "Sierra: Good. Well, I am gonna go to the travel desk and get started on our plans and let Craig know what we're doing.",
        "Dusty: Craig needs to know?",
        "Sierra: Well, of course he does. I mean, what if he needs something? I mean, you know, in business, if something in business comes up that he needs. What?",
        "Dusty: How do you do it? How can you stand to be anywhere near him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: The more I think about getting into television, the more I like it. And the country music thing, you're right. It does have a universal appeal.",
        "Craig: Well, see, that's what we want. We want the whole new world to know who you are and what a great idea you came up with.",
        "Jennifer: Craig, you're such a good salesman, but you don't have to sell me on a good idea. All you have to do is remember that just because we're working together does not mean we're friends. And just because you come up with one good idea does not mean I'm ready to let you start calling all the shots.",
        "Craig: No, no, Street Jeans is your company.",
        "Jennifer: Good. So back to this new campaign. Are you sure there's no room for Mike in it? Hello?",
        "Craig: Mike Kasnoff, your good friend?",
        "Jennifer: What's your point?",
        "Craig: I don't think you want my relationship advice.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you're right.",
        "Craig: The worst thing in business is letting it get personal. You ruin a good business, you ruin a good relationship. So if you really care about Mike Kasnoff, you may -- you may want to think about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You know I love you.",
        "Henry: Of course you do.",
        "Katie: And I would never hurt you on purpose. And I would die if I knew that you were hurt, and it was my fault, and I could have stopped it.",
        "Henry: As well you should. [Katie sighs] Hey, come on, it's me. Look, don't worry, this is Henry -- Henry that knows you inside and out. I am not an idiot. I know this is about other things for you. It's about Mike. Isn't it?",
        "Katie: I thought it would make him come around.",
        "Henry: Right, and that's -- that's the only reason that you went through with it. I know.",
        "Katie: But don't you hate that? I mean, it's not fair!",
        "Henry: Well, it stings a little sometimes. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.",
        "Katie: You don't deserve that.",
        "Henry: But listen -- listen to me. Listen, come here --",
        "Katie: Henry --",
        "Henry: Most of the time, the wedding makes me so happy. Katie, it makes me so happy, you have no idea. This has gone beyond my fantasies. I -- even if we don't get any further than the altar, this will be the best day of my life.",
        "Katie: That would be enough for you, the one day?",
        "Henry: It's all we have. It's all we have is one day. And if I could get to spend it with you, then it's a good day.",
        "Katie: You are the sweetest man on earth.",
        "Henry: Tell it to my bookie, huh? I have a surprise for you. I just remembered. I'll be right back.",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Mike: Is Katie here?",
        "Henry: Uh, yeah, yeah, she's -- crying.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Henry: Bride stuff, you know? She's been emotional all day. Make it quick, okay? I'll be back in a minute.",
        "Mike: Sure. Okay, you can cut it out. If this emotional bride act is for me, you're wasting your time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So what are you here to harass me about, Emily, huh? Let's make it quick, 'cause I have to call my attorney before lights out.",
        "Emily: Forget it, this is my time.",
        "Barbara: Oh, a perk of being Mrs. Chief of Detectives. You know, I really don't care what you have to say. What I have to do is plan my defense. So if you don't mind --",
        "Emily: No, I mind, actually. Everybody minds. There's no defense for what you did to me, Barbara. What you nearly cost me. Not to mention what you did to Rosanna, Paul and Will. So let's be very clear. If you think you're gonna walk from this, forget it. I've seen the case against you.",
        "Barbara: It's all circumstantial.",
        "Emily: Except my testimony.",
        "Barbara: And what can you testify to?",
        "Emily: You drugging me. Giving me instructions to haunt Rosanna. All of it.",
        "Barbara: You don't remember anything. You've said so 100 times. It's all a blank.",
        "Emily: Prove it. I will tell the jury every sick and dangerous thing you did to me. And guess what? They'll believe me. Put that with the rest of the evidence, you're cooked, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: You would say you remember what you don't? You would lie under oath?",
        "Emily: Without batting an eye. I will make sure you go to jail for the rest of your miserable life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi. I was about ready to send out a search party.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. Have I been gone long?",
        "Paul: Yeah. You didn't check your messages?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I guess I forgot.",
        "Paul: Where were you?",
        "Rosanna: I was at the police station, talking to Barbara.",
        "Paul: Oh. That must have been fun. Why did you subject yourself to that?",
        "Rosanna: Hope springs eternal. I guess I thought I could convince her to sign the deal.",
        "Paul: Let me guess -- she didn't budge. She's gonna plead not guilty and fight the charges.",
        "Rosanna: So she said.",
        "Paul: You know, I really wish you would have told me that you were gonna do that. I would have waited for you. I really don't like the idea of you taking her on by herself.",
        "Rosanna: I survived.",
        "Paul: Honey, I think that there's gonna be a trial. One where you will have to testify.",
        "Rosanna: Maybe not.",
        "Paul: I think it's pretty likely. And I think that you should use this time to relax, put some distance between yourself and the case and Barbara.",
        "Rosanna: Sweetie, you're so worried about me. I scared you, didn't I, when I asked you if you thought Cabot was still alive.",
        "Paul: It did come out of left field for me. I mean, I'm not surprised that it came up. And I would give anything for it to be true.",
        "Rosanna: Look, I -- I don't want to worry you. Come on. You've taken care of me for months now.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I signed up for forever.",
        "Rosanna: Well, not for this. Not for a haunted woman jumping at shadows and blaming all the wrong people.",
        "Paul: That's not your fault.",
        "Rosanna: Look, the point is that it's all going to be over soon, and what's coming next is going to be hard, but no matter what, I need you to believe me when I tell you that it's gonna get better.",
        "Paul: Oh, I believe you. It's really nice to hear you say it, though.",
        "Rosanna: What do you say to a bottle of wine and a Jacuzzi?",
        "Paul: Oh, yes and yes.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Well, why don't you go ahead and get it started, and I'll be up in a minute or two. I just have a little business to take care of, okay?",
        "Paul: All right. Don't be long.",
        "Rosanna: I won't.",
        "Phyllis: Dr. Silverman is here.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thank you, Phyllis. What are you doing here? I was just about to call you and ask you to meet me someplace.",
        "Silverman: Oh, sorry, I must have misunderstood.",
        "Rosanna: Did you bring what I asked for?",
        "Paul: Rosanna, there's no more red and none of -- none of the white's cold. Hi.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Rosanna: Some year-end financials that needed to get posted.",
        "Paul: Didn't realize this call would be in person.",
        "Rosanna: Neither did I.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God, what an amazing man. I am marrying an amazing man. And you know what? I think I might just be the luckiest girl in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi, I'm Paul. Paul Ryan.",
        "Rosanna: Scott Zimmerman from accounting and compliance at Cabot Motors. Some year-end financials that needed to get posted.",
        "Paul: Didn't realize this call would be in person.",
        "Rosanna: Neither did I. Scott's very dedicated.",
        "Paul: Oh. Well, I'll leave you to it then.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Thanks, honey. Won't be long.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: This is exactly why I didn't want you in my home. Absolute discretion.",
        "Silverman: I understand, but Ms. Cabot, Tamekamine can be a dangerous drug. In the wrong hands with the wrong dose --",
        "Rosanna: I will be careful, doctor. I promise.",
        "Silverman: I'm risking my license.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm sure you were careful to make sure this drug can't be traced to you. There is a reason you have been such a well-paid retainer over the years, Dr. Silverman. For moments just like these. Now you can take a well-paid vacation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: You know, Craig is really none of your concern.",
        "Dusty: Why is he yours? I mean, what else does he have to do to you?",
        "Sierra: It's none of your business.",
        "Dusty: Do you think he's changed? He's a reformed man now? It doesn't happen. He got scared, so he changed some stripes to be in Lucy's good graces, to have you smile at him again. It's shallow, real skin-deep stuff.",
        "Sierra: You know, I understand why you have such strong feelings about Craig. Really, I understand completely. But don't you think that maybe I know him a little bit better than you do?",
        "Dusty: Did you think he was capable of killing your husband?",
        "Sierra: That's enough. Just drop it, all right?",
        "Dusty: No, I can't. If you let him into your life again, you're asking for nothing but trouble -- nothing.",
        "Sierra: My trouble. It's my trouble. It's my decisions and my life, all right? So if you -- if it really bothers you for me to tell Craig about my travel plans, I'll just stay here. Go ahead, go to California all by yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mike and I have a great working relationship. It's been fun.",
        "Craig: That's nice, but you're the head of a major clothing company now. There's tough decisions to be made.",

        "Craig: Can Mike Kasnoff take it?",
        "Jennifer: Mike has just been doing me a favor. He was the inspiration behind the line, but it's not anything he ever planned on. He'd be just as happy running his own construction company.",
        "Craig: Then why don't you let him?",
        "Jennifer: Because he's been there since day one. I've gotten used to having him around.",
        "Craig: Nice to have the support getting off the ground.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, it was. Not that I can't handle it on my own.",
        "Craig: That's right. And now would be the time to let Mike Kasnoff go off and do whatever he does best. But, whatever you decide, I'm sure will be fine.",

        "Emily: Well, you know what? It's too late. You can't stop me.",
        "Barbara: I know that, but I am trying to help you here. I'm gonna walk away from these charges. I will be exonerated. But if you perjure yourself, you're gonna be left holding a bag of lies.",
        "Emily: You are unbelievable.",

        "Mike: My paint book. The paint samples that I brought over here?",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Mike: I left them for you. You were supposed to make a choice. You pretended like you needed more time. Yeah, that way you knew I'd have to come back over here. Just in time to find you in tears and convince you not to go through with this wedding.",

        "Katie: This is not about you, Mike. This is about Henry.",
        "Mike: Henry made you cry? What did he do, pawn your wedding dress?",
        "Katie: Don't you dare make fun of him. Do you have any idea what that man has done for me? What he would do for me? He loves me, Mike, just the way I am, no matter what I do. I don't have to be a certain way, I don't have to play games. He loves me. He loves spending time with me. And, oh my God, what an amazing man. I am marrying an amazing man. And, you know what? I think I might just be the luckiest girl in the world.",
        "Mike: You sound surprised. Like you didn't know you were lucky to be getting married to Henry.",
        "Katie: I didn't. I mean, well, I did. I just -- oh, I was so stupid. It was right there in front of me the whole time. It's always been there, I just took it for granted.",

        "Mike: That wasn't the question.",
        "Katie: Mike, this is better than \"in love.\" What Henry and I have is, is strong and steady and nothing can kill it. Yeah, I'm gonna marry Henry and if I'm lucky, I will get to spend the rest of my life making him happy. Here. You pick the color. Whatever. Anyway, it's going to be a beautiful wedding.",
        "Mike: Okay.",
        "Katie: Or ask Henry if you see him out there. He'll know.",
        "Mike: Yeah, he has a good eye.",
        "Katie: Mike -- thanks.",
        "Mike: For what?",
        "Katie: For being Henry's best man. I mean, aside from me, you're his best friend. And I know it really meant a lot to him that you said yes.",

        "Sierra: I wouldn't believe you if you did.",
        "Dusty: I watched him almost kill your daughter. I watched him almost kill Lucy. Literally. I watched him kill that part of her that was just yearning for some truth. From her father! I take that personally, you know? So, that's it. You want to hear some more gut instincts?",
        "Sierra: In business only.",
        "Dusty: Fair enough.",
        "Sierra: You know, I know this is hard for you with Craig. It is hard for me, too. But, I don't know, I can't -- I can't give up hope on him. Not just for my sake, but for our daughter's.",
        "Dusty: So do me a favor and check out this place with me in California. I really value your input. And I'm sure you'd never let my attitude come in the way of your business. You're too smart for that.",
        "Sierra: And just when I thought we could be friends, you start sucking up.",

        "Jennifer: Hold off. Don't you think we should wait until Sierra signs off on this?",
        "Craig: All I need is a commitment from you. And all Sierra needs is to know that you and I have a good working relationship.",
        "Jennifer: If you make this happen, Craig, things are good. But I have a challenge for you, just to make things interesting.",
        "Craig: Oh, I like challenges.",

        "Katie: Wow! Henry, this is way too much.",
