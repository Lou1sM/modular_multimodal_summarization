        "Jack tells Carly about Gwen having an arrest warrant issued for her, and naturally Carly wants to desperately help out, but Jack suggests this time she leave it to the police because when she gets involved things usually go horribly wrong. Carly has bigger fish to fry anyway with going undercover at the Galaxy Strip Club in order to get Jack's job back. She agrees to go into \u0091work' that night, but when Jack surprises her by taking the night off, he is stunned when she tells him she doesn't want him staying home! Barbara convinces Jen to make a public plea for Will's return, against Jen and Kim's better judgment. They think Barbara will do better with Will, and he will come home, if she drops the charges against Gwen. Barbara will not be deterred. A mysterious woman tells Jen that the grief for her older brother has been misguided. Emily continues to believe Paul is alive and well and Meg is the key to finding him. Emily cons Emma into telling her where Meg is. She forces Henry to help her find out which hotel Meg is staying at, by holding BJ's money over his head. Henry locates Meg at a Mexican hotel and leaves her a message pretending to be Paul in hopes she will come home. Emily is right; Paul is close; he has disguised himself as someone from France, who is staying in a run down Oakdale motel, and is making mysterious phone calls. Maddie helps Will and Gwen find a place to stay while on the run. They end up holed up at the closed down Metro. Maddie goes and gets them lots of food from Java, but is forced to lie to Henry when he sees her with all this food and mistakenly thinks she has an eating disorder. As she is heading out the door, she runs smack dab into Casey who is also real curious at what she is doing with all the food she has."

        "Carly: Hello? Yeah, this is tiffany. Tonight? No, I wasn't scheduled to work now for -- I'll get back to you. Bye. Did you forget something?",
        "Jack: Who was on the phone?",
        "Carly: Just some PTA thing. I thought you were headed into work.",
        "Jack: I told Nick to go on without me.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Jack: Carly, I really need you to tell me who you were talking to just now.",
        "Carly: I just did.",
        "Jack: Was it Gwen?",
        "Carly: No. No, it wasn't Gwen. It wasn't. Jack, why would I lie about talking to my sister? What's going on?",
        "Jack: A call just came through on the scanner. There's an APB put out for Gwen's arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Don't call the cops, okay?",
        "Maddie: You should not be up here.",
        "Gwen: Maddie, its okay. We're not doing anything wrong.",
        "Maddie: Yes you are. You're hiding.",
        "Will: We're not hiding. We were just --",
        "Gwen: Maddie, we were making out, okay? And you came up here with your friend, Nate?",
        "Will: And we got embarrassed. That's all. So how have you been?",
        "Maddie: Oh, come on, Will. I know what you guys are up to. I know you're running from the cops.",
        "Gwen: Maddie.",
        "Will: Wait, no --.",
        "Maddie: Are you kidding? I live with Detective Hughes, okay? She told me that Gwen attacked your mother and tried to kill her!",
        "Gwen: I didn't do it.",
        "Maddie: Someone did.",
        "Will: It's the truth! Maddie, she didn't do it. I hurt my mom.",
        "Maddie: You tried to kill your own mother?",
        "Gwen: It was an accident. We didn't mean to hurt anybody.",
        "Will: Maddie, listen.",
        "Maddie: Seriously, do not come near me, I will scream. I swear I will!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Thank goodness you're here. I just pray that Will hears this and he comes home.",
        "Kim: He just was so desperate. I begged him to come and stay with Bob and me. And he was so insistent that he and Gwen couldn't be separated. And then I had to go and give him a hard time about the two of them sharing a room.",
        "Barbara: Well, thank goodness you did, because if you hadn't you would've that girl in your house scoping out your antiques, eyeing your jewelry. She would've bashed your head in they way she did mine!",
        "Kim: Barbara, that's ridiculous.",
        "Barbara: Gwen Norbeck does not deserve your kindness. What she needs is a prison cell and a life sentence to go with it.",
        "Kim: Okay, okay. You're angry at Gwen. The important thing now is to get Will back here safe and sound, right?",
        "Barbara: Of course. Of course.",
        "Kim: Okay, good. In that case, I have an idea guaranteed to bring him back.",
        "Jennifer: That's great, what is it?",
        "Kim: You have to drop the charges against Gwen.",
        "Barbara: After everything she's done? She broke into my home and she attacked me.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, Will brought her here.",
        "Kim: Listen, you scared the living daylights out of her. The longer those two are out there on their own, who knows what they are going to get into.",
        "Jennifer: And Will is definitely not going to come back until he knows that Gwen is safe. You refuse to believe how much he loves her, Mom.",
        "Barbara: He thinks he loves her.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, well, the point is he will not come back if she has any risk of going to jail. Do you want to lose Will, too? Like we lost Paul? Please. Please, Mom. Aunt Kim's right. Drop the charges.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Henry.",
        "Henry: I want my money.",
        "Emily: Well, first you give me what I want and then I'll give you some of what you want.",
        "Henry: Some of what I want? I have close to a million dollars.",
        "Emily: No, actually, I've got it, and I got it hidden very safely.",
        "Henry: I'm so sick of being in cahoots with you, you know that?",
        "Emily: Well, too bad, I am too but we're stuck with each other. So what do you know?",
        "Henry: I'll tell you what. You give me a thousand of my dollars and I'll tell you what i know.",
        "Emily: Are you trying to get caught?",
        "Henry: No, I'm not trying to get caught. I just need the money --",
        "Emily: Legally, that money still belongs to B.J. Green. And if you go around spending chunks of it, you're just going to get yourself in big fat trouble.",
        "Henry: I know how to be discreet.",
        "Emily: I'm just trying to save you from yourself. Now, tell me what you know about Emma?",
        "Henry: She is on her way here. Today is the day that Java gives food to the homeless. She is coming here to pick it up.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's good. That's very good.",
        "Henry: How? How is it good? How is knowing Emma Snyder's schedule help you in the slightest?",
        "Emily: Because Emma's gonna can lead us to Meg and Meg is gonna lead me to Paul.",
        "Henry: Right. It's going to lead you, Emily. Just you. I'm done with this. We don't even know where Paul went after he left that cabin. For all we know, he's dead somewhere in the woods.",
        "Emily: Paul's not dead. I can feel it in my heart. And he's close, Henry. He's very close.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: This room is -- it's probably not up to your standards, Mr. Pollock. But it's the best we've got. I hope its okay.",
        "[With a French accent]",
        "Paul: It's perfect.",
        "Manager: You've got your hot plate and some of that fancy tea you wanted. But the room is kind of small.",
        "[With a French accent]",
        "Paul: Oh, no. The room suits my needs.",
        "Manager: Which are?",
        "Paul: Very personal, yeah?",
        "Manager: Right. It's just, you're kind of, well -- different from our other guests. What part of Europe are you from anyway?",
        "Paul: I've traveled extensively.",
        "Manager: Well, isn't that something? And now you're here in Oakdale. Well, you're paying top dollar, so if there's anything you need --",
        "Paul: Privacy. I require absolute privacy and discretion, yeah?",
        "Manager: You bet. Nobody will know you're here. For what you're paying, I'll even forget you're here myself!",
        "Paul: That's very funny, yeah. Do you have a newspaper for me?",
        "Manager: Yes, sir. Local and Chicago papers right here. Okay, we're all set. I'll check on you later, Mr. Pollock.",
        "Paul: No you won't.",
        "Manager: Eh?",
        "Paul: I do not wish to be disturbed right now or ever by anyone.",
        "Manager: Right. No calls, no maid service, no interruptions. Got it. You a writer or something?",
        "[Paul mumbles]",
        "Paul: Thank you, Mr. Toklar.",
        "Manager: Yeah. You're welcome, sir.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Paul is probably long gone.",
        "Emily: No, Henry, he had weeks to get away, but he chose to stay locked up in that cabin.",
        "Henry: Recuperating from a gunshot.",
        "Emily: Paul's has lots of money and connections. He stayed because he chose to stay. I think there's something here he wants.",
        "Henry: You think that something is you? Why hasn't he contacted you since he knows that you know that he's alive?",
        "Emily: Because he's a fugitive.",
        "Henry: Yeah and he's probably a little perturbed that you tried to kill him, Emily, don't you think? You're not gonna give me my money unless I help you find Paul, are you?",
        "Emily: Not one red cent.",
        "Henry: Fine. Where do you think he would go?",
        "Emily: I think he's with Meg. Because she was with him. She was with him from the very beginning, right? And it makes sense since she's fallen off the face of the planet.",
        "Henry: And you think they're together.",
        "Emily: Yes, they're definitely together.",
        "Henry: I don't understand why you want to find this guy. Let him runaway, Emily. Let him hide. Let him disappear. If he shows up, what happens? You get busted for trying to shoot him and you go away. And then you'll make a deal and the cops find out I got B.J.'s money and then I go away. Why can't you just let sleeping dogs lie?",
        "Emily: Because I can't, Henry. I need to find Paul. I need to know what he's planning. I need to know what he feels about me right now.",
        "Henry: How he feels? Sweetheart, he gave you the heave-ho on the way to the altar.",
        "Emily: No. No, don't you see? He was trying to do the right thing, Henry. He was trying to be generous. And he wasn't being cruel. You have to help me find him. Please!",
        "Henry: Okay, Emily. Here's the game plan, all right? When Emma shows up, we don't go near her. We don't approach her.",
        "Emily: Why? Why not?",
        "Henry: Because we don't want to tip her off that we're looking for Meg and drive Meg further underground. We don't speak. We watch.",
        "Emily: We watch. We follow.",
        "Emily: Follow. Or not.",
        "Emily: Emma, I'm so sorry. I'm so glad we bumped into each other.",
        "Emma: How are you, Emily?",
        "Emily: I'm awful. Actually, I'm really awful. And it's all because of Meg.",
        "Emma: What are you saying? Are you accusing my daughter of --?",
        "Emily: Oh, no! No. I'm sorry. It's not what Meg's done to me, it's what I've done to her. And I promise you're the only one who can make it right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Of course I want Will to come home. Honey, you know that.",
        "Jennifer: Then drop the charges, Mom. When I go on the air, I can say there's no reason for Will and Gwen to run anymore.",
        "Barbara: Will will think it's some kind of trick.",
        "Kim: No he won't. Jen will be very convincing. I mean, for heaven's sakes, she's going to be doing this on the air in front of thousands of witnesses.",
        "Jennifer: Even better, you could go in there with me.",
        "Barbara: On camera? I can't do that. I just came from the hospital.",
        "Kim: Okay, so don't go on air. Just drop the charges!",
        "Barbara: If I drop the charges, then Gwen Norbeck is free to go out there and hurt somebody else.",
        "Jennifer: Mother, she is not a bad person.",
        "Barbara: But I could've died, Jen!",
        "Kim: Barbara, do you want your son back?",
        "Barbara: Of course I do.",
        "Jennifer: Then it's worth it.",
        "Barbara: No, it's not. I'm not going to reward Gwen Norbeck for attacking me in my own home. I'm not going to drop those charges under any circumstances.",
        "Jennifer: Not even to save Will?",
        "Barbara: If Will comes home still bound to that girl, I have not saved him. I've doomed him. No, no. If the only way to break her hold on my son is to get her sent to prison, then that's what I'm going to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Just back off!",
        "Gwen: Hey, Will is not going to hurt you, okay?",
        "Maddie: He just admitted to me that he tried to kill his mother! He's got to like her a lot more than he likes me, okay?",
        "Will: Maddie, you obviously don't know my mother.",
        "Maddie: So why'd you do it? Why'd you hurt her?",
        "Gwen: Will's mom does not like me, all right? She's been trying to break us up for a long time.",
        "Will: Lately she's been completely off the charts. She got Gwen evicted from her apartment and made her lose her job at the lake view.",
        "Maddie: So you attacked her for revenge?",
        "Gwen: No! He didn't attack her. She fell.",
        "Maddie: How?",
        "Gwen: We might as well tell her everything.",
        "Will: Okay, so, lately we've been homeless. I got this really, really stupid idea that Gwen tried to talk me out of. That I should steal money from my mother.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Will: It was a thousand dollars. She keeps it tucked away in case of an emergency. She wouldn't have even missed it.",
        "Gwen: And Will was going to put it back as soon as we got on our feet.",
        "Maddie: But she caught you?",
        "Will: Yeah. Even though Gwen was totally against it, she came with me and then Mom came in and saw Gwen and then totally blew up and she started making all this noise about calling the cops. All I did was try and get the phone away from her and she fell and she hit her head.",
        "Maddie: Did she blackout or something? Is that why she doesn't remember?",
        "Will: She remembers, all right.",
        "Maddie: So then why is she trying to blame Gwen?",
        "Gwen: She's lying, Maddie. That's how much she hates me.",
        "Maddie: I don't understand. It's your word against hers, two against one. Why would the police believe her over you?",
        "Gwen: 'Cause when I got fired from the Lakeview, I said some things.",
        "Maddie: Like what?",
        "Gwen: I told her that she would pay, and that I would make sure that it happened.",
        "Maddie: Oh, boy.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know. So it's going to be really hard for anybody to believe us, but i swear to you, Maddie, I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt. So will you help us?",
        "Maddie: I don't know. If detective Hughes finds out that I saw you and didn't call, I could be an accessory.",
        "Gwen: Hey, we don't want you to get in trouble.",
        "Will: We're just looking for a head start here.",
        "Gwen: Please, Maddie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Gwen did threaten Barbara. In public.",
        "Carly: Oh, so what? Jack, if I had a Nickel for every time somebody in this town wanted to kill Barbara Ryan, I'd be richer than she is.",
        "Jack: Where do you think Gwen will go?",
        "Carly: She's got no place to go, thanks to Barbara. She has no home. She has no job. And she can't come to me, can she? You're here.",
        "Jack: Well, I could leave.",
        "Carly: Sweetheart, I think you know what I mean. You're a cop, she's a kid. She and Will are running scared.",
        "Jack: We'll find her.",
        "Carly: Right. Right, well, then, let's go.",
        "Jack: I mean \"we\" the police, not \"we\" you and me.",
        "Carly: What, do you think, that I could just sit here and do nothing while my baby sister's out there running from the cops?",
        "Jack: What else are you going to do? Drive up and down every street? Knock on every door?",
        "Carly: If that's what it takes! Jack, she is my sister. If I don't help her, who will?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Okay. All right. I'll help you.",
        "Will: Thank you, Maddie. We're never gonna forget this.",
        "Gwen: We won't ever say that we ran into you. We never saw you. You never saw us. Okay?",
        "Maddie: Okay. Wait a minute! It's daylight. Cops are still looking for you. Where are you going?",
        "Will: We'll hide out somewhere for today and then buy a couple of bus tickets.",
        "Maddie: Do you know what an APB means?",
        "Will: Yeah, my father's chief of detectives. I know what it means.",
        "Maddie: Then why would you go anywhere near a bus, or a train or a plane? That's the first place they're going to look.",
        "Gwen: Hey, what about the old mill?",
        "Maddie: And how will you get down there?",
        "Will: Well, we could hide out here, at least until it gets dark.",
        "Maddie: Okay, well, does anyone in your family know you come up here? Your mom or your sister?",
        "Will: It wouldn't be the first place my dad or Jen would think of, but eventually. I mean, we need to get out of here.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Where are we gonna go?",
        "Maddie: Okay, I know. Come on, follow me. Okay. Here you go. Here's my phone. Anybody else you know willing to help you, give them a call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I've been trying to reach Meg for the longest time, and I can't seem to find her, and I'm sick about it! I owe her an apology.",
        "Emma: An apology for what?",
        "Emily: A few months ago, I had mentioned to my mother that I saw Meg with a bunch of medical supplies. It was after she stopped working at the hospital.",
        "Emma: Yes, yes, yes, your mother told me.",
        "Emily: Oh, geez, I was afraid of that. I'm sorry. You must have been so worried. I can only imagine what you must have thought, that she as dealing drugs or stealing or something. And I couldn't have been more wrong.",
        "Emma: Did you find out what she was doing with those supplies?",
        "Emily: Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah, it was completely innocent.",
        "Emma: Oh, really?",
        "Emily: Yes, yes. She was just -- you know what? I can't say another word.",
        "Emma: I would really like to know.",
        "Emily: No, you know what? I've learned my lesson this time. I'm gonna keep my mouth shut, and I'm going to talk to myself. I really need to talk to her. Like I said, I owe her a huge apology.",
        "Emma: I'm sure she'll appreciate that, Emily.",
        "Emily: Well, see, the problem is, I've looked all over town for her, and I have no idea where she is.",
        "Emma: She's not in town.",
        "Emily: Oh, where is she?",
        "Emma: She's in Puerto Vallarta.",
        "Emily: Oh, she's in Mexico?",
        "Emma: Mm-hmm, yes, she's having a lovely time. She called me this morning. Said she arrived safely.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's nice. She's vacationing. I hear it's really nice down there.",
        "Emma: Yes, so I hear. Excuse me. Val. I came by to pick up those food donations.",
        "Waitress: I'll get them for you, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Emily: So Emma, exactly where in Puerto Vallarta is Meg?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: You still have time to change your mind.",
        "Barbara: That's not going to happen. Besides, I am sure that Will and Gwen are still in town somewhere, and if Will hears his sister --",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Barbara: I've got to go.",
        "Kim: Wait a minute.",
        "Barbara: There's something I've got to do. I'll be back. I'll be back.",
        "Jennifer: Will, if you're listening, or if anyone who cares about my brother knows where he is and hears this, please call us as soon as possible. I'm certain that he and his friend, Gwen Norbeck, are still together. And I just don't want them to get into any further trouble. Which is what will happen if they continue to run from the police. Please, Will, please come home. I've already lost one brother, and that's been really hard for me, and I don't want to lose you, too, Will. And I know you think that you don't matter, but you do. You do. My son needs an uncle. I need my brother. I need my brother so much. So please, just come -- come back. Come back now.",

        "Will: The thing about Maddie --",
        "Gwen: What, you don't trust her?",
        "Will: She lives with Casey. What if he finds out she's trying to help us.",
        "Casey: Whoa, where's the party?",
        "Henry: I'm looking for a guest named Meg Snyder. She would -- she's there? Hello, my flower.",

        "Paul: Yeah, it's me. Listen, the timetable for what I require has become more pressing. Yeah. Much sooner than I had planned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Emma, if you could just tell me the name of the hotel down there, then I can talk to her. I'll call her today.",
        "Emma: In Mexico? Why?",
        "Emily: You have no idea how guilty I have felt these last few days. I really need to make amends with her.",
        "Emma: Listen, I'm really sorry, Emily. I'm afraid I can't help you.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but don't you think it would be better for Meg, you know? She can enjoy her vacation knowing all these horrible rumors are gone and are put to rest. I just need the name of the hotel, that's it.",
        "Emma: I don't know it. I don't know it. She called me. She left a message. She told me she arrived safely, and that she was having a lovely time. I'm afraid I don't know where my daughter is staying in Puerto Vallarta.",
        "Emily: Can you guess?",
        "Emma: Listen, Emily, whatever it is that you have to say to my Meg is going to simply have to just wait.",
        "Waitress: Here you go, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Emma: Thank you so much. Oh, this is wonderful. Thank you. Bye.",
        "Emily: Bye.",
        "Henry: Ooh, so close. You just had to push it, didn't you?",
        "Emily: If she had known the name of the hotel that Meg was in, she would have told me.",
        "Henry: Yeah, it's too bad about that. Now, about that $1,000 you promised me.",
        "Emily: First we find Meg.",
        "Henry: How? Puerto Vallarta is not exactly small. We can't just hop a flight, and then get off the plane in Mexico and shout Meg's name. Which is a good thing, too, because as much as I love the sun, I don't think I want to be traveling with you right now. You're a little bit --",
        "Emily: Stop it! I don't want to find Meg just to find Meg, okay? I want to find Meg to get her to come back to Oakdale.",
        "Henry: Why would she leave 80 degree weather to come back here to the land of ice and cold?",
        "Emily: We'll think of something, okay?",
        "Henry: Emily --",
        "Emily: No, we'll think of something. We switched the cell phones, right? So we know -- I mean, we can guess that they're not in contact with each other, right?",
        "Henry: Maybe he is with her.",
        "Emily: He is here.",
        "Henry: Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. You can feel him.",
        "Emily: So we bring her back to Oakdale, okay? We bring Meg back, and we know that Paul is going to make contact with her, and that brings me one step closer to Paul.",
        "Henry: Okay, let's just do a reality check here. Of all the gin joints in Puerto Vallarta, we have no idea which one Meg is in.",
        "Emily: Yes, but you can find anyone anywhere without a single clue.",
        "Henry: Oh, flattery will get you nowhere.",
        "Emily: How about a thousand bucks?",
        "Henry: Okay, get your phone. The daylight is burning.",

        "Carly: What if something bad happens, Jack? What if Gwen and Will get cornered, and some cop gets trigger happy --",
        "Jack: Listen to me for a second. Will you listen to me? Hal is chief of police. Will is his son. There's not a cop on the force that's going to risk hurting either one of those kids. Okay? We'll find them.",
        "Carly: And then what will you do? You're going to arrest my sister, Jack?",
        "Jack: Carly.",
        "Carly: Because she's innocent!",
        "Jack: Then we'll get a lawyer, and we'll prove that. But we can't do anything until we find them, except wait.",
        "Carly: Well, I hate waiting. Especially when I'm waiting for bad news or worse news. At least you get to go out there and do something.",
        "Jack: If I could stay here with you, I would. [Cell phone ringing] I would. Yeah, Nick, what's up? Sure. Can I call you back? Good. He needs more input on the gambling case. I got to go.",
        "Carly: That should be your case. You should be the one telling him what to do, not the other way around.",
        "Jack: I love you, too. I do. Which is why I need you to promise me something. When I leave here, I will leave you alone --",
        "Carly: I will not go looking for Gwen. I promise. Because she might call me, or -- oh, come on, Gwen. Pick up.",

        "Carly: Oh, boy, you got a lot of nerve showing up here.",
        "Barbara: Are you hiding her?",
        "Carly: If anything happens to my sister because of you --",
        "Barbara: She will have brought it on herself. She attacked me in my own home!",
        "Carly: She wouldn't attack a flea.",
        "Barbara: She's a menace.",
        "Carly: And you are a lying, vindictive witch, so?",
        "Barbara: Did Gwen come to you for help?",
        "Carly: I wish she had.",
        "Barbara: Well, let me remind you of something. My son is still a minor. And things will go very badly for you if you help him leave town with her.",
        "Carly: Oh, Barbara, you got me quaking in my boots. Where do you think you're going?",
        "Barbara: To search your house.",
        "Carly: I heard you had a concussion, Barbara. Would you like another?",
        "Barbara: My son is talented, educated and intelligent. He has a future! And I will not let your money grubbing sister drag him down and ruin his life the way you ruined Jack's.",
        "Carly: What are you talking about?",
        "Barbara: Concealing a fugitive. I'm sure that you have her here hidden right under your husband's nose.",
        "Carly: No, I wouldn't do that.",
        "Barbara: Why? Make trouble for Jack? How many times have you asked him to break the law for you? Once, twice?",
        "Carly: Go to hell, Barbara!",
        "Barbara: This time, though, he won't be demoted. He'll be kicked off the force. And just think. You can form your own little merry band of desperadoes. You, you husband, and your harlot sister.",
        "Carly: You want me to hit you?",
        "Barbara: Oh, I'd love that. Then you and Gwen can have adjoining cells. Just think of that. Think of what that will do for Jack's career. Oh, right. Thanks to you, he doesn't have one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Okay, here it is! Your new hiding place.",
        "Will: Metro? Maddie, this place has been closed for months.",
        "Maddie: I know, isn't it great?",
        "Gwen: Hey, it's locked up. How are we supposed to get in?",
        "Maddie: There was a construction crew -- here we go. Must have left this here. Here you are. It pays to be a coffee addict. Since this place is right below Java, I've been scoping out what's going on around here. There have been guys in and out doing renovations, but no one's been here for at least a month, so I don't know. My guess is someone wanted to reopen it, and they ran out of money. And I don't know. But anyway, no one has checked up on it in a very long time.",
        "Gwen: That's great. This might actually work.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, and you guys bunk here for weeks, and no one will be the wiser. And you can come up with a really excellent departure strategy, and I will be the only one who knows. Okay, why aren't you going in?",
        "Will: I'm trying to remember the code.",
        "Maddie: Huh?",
        "Will: There was an alarm when some of my friends were running the place.",
        "Gwen: So somebody opens this door, then --",
        "Will: The rent-a-cops will be here in like 30 seconds.",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry. I should have thought of that. I didn't even --",
        "Gwen: Hey, what are you doing?",
        "Will: If the alarm goes off, just run. This is my buddy.",
        "[Alarm ringing]",
        "Maddie: Oh, my God, save yourselves! I'll just stay. I'll stay, and I'll --",
        "Gwen: No, its okay, Maddie. The alarm's supposed to do that until Will puts in the code.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Well, what if they've changed the code.",
        "[Alarm stops]",
        "Gwen: You're a genius I don't know how to thank you. It was enough you not turning us in, but finding this amazing place to stay.",
        "Maddie: It's a little Dusty.",
        "Will: We're inside, and we're out of the cold. You've bought us some time. That's huge.",
        "Maddie: I can do more.",
        "Will: Maddie.",
        "Maddie: No, really, I could be your link to the outside world.",
        "Gwen: No, really, you've done enough.",
        "Maddie: Please, this is nothing. I'll bring you food! You guys must be starved from being on that roof all night. Okay, relax, sit here. I'll be back before you know it!",
        "Will: Well, we're hiding from the cops in a deserted bar. What do you think?",
        "Gwen: Maybe now would be a good time to start drinking.",

        "Emily: Okay, what scam are you going to use this time, Henry?",
        "Henry: I don't know. Sweepstakes winner, a dead brother, a dead brother who is a sweepstakes winner. I have no idea. I'll play it by ear. Si, Senor? You certain you don't have a guest named Meg Snyder? It's really important. She's my sister and our Madre is terribly ill -- right, I understand. Gracias, senor.",
        "Emily: No?",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, here, we got a few more. Try this.",
        "Henry: All this lying is making me thirsty. Why can't we do this at a nice bar?",
        "Emily: Because I need you focused and clear-headed, not three sheets to the wind.",
        "Henry: Chimichanga. Hola! Hola. Senor, I'm looking for a guest named Meg Snyder. She's there? No, no, no, no, I don't want to patch me through to her. No, I don't want you to patch me through. If you could actually get a message to her. Can you write this down, please? Can't communicate the same way. Situation critical. Come back immediately. Thank you so much. Gracias, thank you. Thank you. Hasta la vista, baby.",
        "Emily: You are so good.",
        "Henry: I'm great. So are you.",
        "Emily: Well, thanks. But see, I lie in the pursuit of the greater good. You lie because it's a way of life. Maybe it was fate that brought us together in the woods that day, Henry.",
        "Henry: Yes, that has distanced me from my fortune. Speaking of which --",
        "Emily: Oh, sure. Here's 20 bucks. Don't spend it in one place.",

        "Barbara: Say that three times while clicking your ruby slippers, and it might come true.",
        "Carly: Jack is still a cop.",
        "Barbara: He was one of the best detectives on the force, on the fast track to lieutenant. And what is he doing now? He's a part-time desk jockey moonlighting as a security guard.",
        "Carly: I will get his old job back. You'll see.",
        "Barbara: Give it up, Carly. Give it up. Jack's career is down the tubes, all because he had the misfortune of falling for you. Well, I'm not going to let your sister do that to my son, because I will find Gwen. And when I find her, I will make sure she never comes near my son again. I'm not going to let some little guttersnipe ruin Will's life the way you ruined Jack's.",

        "Barbara: You're going to what? Get him back on top?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Oh, God help him. Because your help always backfires. Oh, but you know, while you're helping Jack, why don't you help Gwen? It'll only bring her a world of hurt.",
        "Carly: Get out! Get the hell out of here!",
        "Jack: Barbara! My wife asked you to leave.",
        "Barbara: You know, Jack, I am so worried about Will.",

        "Carly: She was just being her normal hateful self. It doesn't matter.",
        "Jack: It looks like it matters. Honey, I know you're still concerned about Gwen. But don't let Barbara goad you into doing something crazy, okay?",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: You won't go looking for Gwen?",
        "Carly: No, Jack. I can't help Gwen now. At least now for now, and I -- I have to learn to accept that there are certain things that I cannot change.",

        "Carly: But I will change the things I can.",
        "Jack: And those are?",
        "Carly: Well, just me for starters. I will be a better wife for you, Jack. I will. You deserve it, and I will do anything for you.",
        "Jack: I know, baby. I know that. Hey, and for the record, they don't come any better than you.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: I'm going to make a few phone calls, okay?",
        "Carly: Okay.",

        "Maddie: Wow, that sounds like it can last for days. Not that I'm saying that I'm going to make it last for days. It's just a really big sandwich.",
        "Waitress: That's why they call it the hungry man's special.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Well, then, I will take two of those, plus bag of potato chips, tortilla chips. What else? Cole slaw, please, plus the donuts, the four coffees, and the four hot chocolates.",
