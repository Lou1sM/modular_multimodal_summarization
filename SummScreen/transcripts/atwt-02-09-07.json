        "Lucinda: Where's Emily?",
        "Dusty: She's getting ready. Where's Lily?",
        "Lucinda: I had hoped that she would grace us with her presence, but you know, some people just don't feel the impact of a multi-million dollar multi- national --",
        "Dusty: I heard you guys had a fight.",
        "Lucinda: You know, I'm quite annoyed with you. I'm very cross with you. If you hadn't talked me into this whole \"Intruder\" thing, I wouldn't have to suffer through this mess with Emily. Oh, please, pick me. Pick me! Like I'm in some damn beauty pageant. And Lily is a spoiled girl and a stubborn girl.",
        "Dusty: Is this because of this baby food thing she backed up? Are you mad because she made the deal without you?",
        "Lucinda: It was a terrible deal. No due diligence. And I'm talking to her, and I want her to stay -- no, no, no. She takes off because she forgot about her daughter.",
        "Dusty: Well, she's just being a mother to your grandchild, isn't she?",
        "Lucinda: Excuse me, Darling. Lily has ample means. She can hire maids, nannies, chauffeurs, anything. She should be here, front and present when her boss needs her to be.",
        "Dusty: It's after 5:00, but whatever.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you clock-watcher. Go fetch your prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Let's get this thing on the road.",
        "Board member: That woman's a menace.",
        "Dusty: Which one?",
        "Board member: This meeting was supposed to start awhile ago. Why is she on the phone with some kid?",
        "Lucinda: Well, perhaps there's been some family emergency --",
        "Dusty: I'll take care of it. Emily, what's going on?",
        "Emily: I can't go in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Okay. Thank you. Bye. Did you find Faith?",
        "Dr. Seidman: Not on this floor. But one of the aides is having security check the rest of the floors.",
        "Lily: My son hasn't heard from her either. Where could Faith be?",
        "Dr. Seidman: I'm sure she's nearby. I asked her to wait here for you after our session and knock on the door if she --",
        "Lily: Oh, my God, Jack! Is this about Faith? Is she all right?",
        "Jack: Faith? No, Parker's got an appointment.",
        "Dr. Seidman: Detective Snyder, good to see you again.",
        "Jack: Dr. Seidman, yes, I'm sorry I'm a little late. What's this about Faith?",
        "Lily: She disappeared.",
        "Dr. Seidman: I'm sure that she just stepped out for a minute. Where's your son?",
        "Jack: He's supposed to be here.",
        "Dr. Seidman: He hasn't arrived yet.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I was working. The babysitter was going to drop him off.",
        "Dr. Seidman: When?",
        "Jack: 15, 20 minutes ago. Faith's missing, too?",
        "Lily: I left her here with the doctor. I went to work to work on something, and I was a little late getting back. And all of a sudden, she's gone.",
        "Dr. Seidman: Snyder, of course. I should have realized. You two are related?",
        "Lily: This is my husband's cousin.",
        "Dr. Seidman: And your children are friendly?",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Dr. Seidman: Then they're probably together.",
        "Jack: I hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: I can't believe we just left like that.",
        "Parker: If you look like you know where you're going, nobody notices.",
        "Faith: Yeah, it's really cool, but won't Jack be mad when you're not there?",
        "Parker: Probably. What about your mom?",
        "Faith: Yeah, she'll go ballistic.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Faith: Is it Jack?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Faith: Are you going to answer it?",
        "Parker: I'll just put it on vibrate. Hungry?",
        "Faith: Yeah, sure.",
        "Parker: Me, too. We might as well get something while we're waiting for them to find us.",
        "Faith: Might as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Will: Gwen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, if you're writing Santa Claus, you're a couple of months late. You know, I remember you doing that. In fact, I helped you one year. You wanted some God-awful pink, plastic pony and it had a comb for its purple mane.",
        "Katie: Oh, a childhood memory, am I supposed to shed tears?",
        "Craig: Well, we are brother and sister, Katie, even though you don't want to admit it. Speaking of family ties, how come you're not at Margo's ceremony?",
        "Katie: I tried to make it, but then I had a wardrobe malfunction, and by the time I got there, it was over.",
        "Craig: I see. Well, we should at least toast to her success. Can I buy you a drink?",
        "Katie: No, no. I've got to go. I have a meeting at WOAK.",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah, I heard you were hosting something over there.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it's called \"Oakdale Now,\" and it's actually pretty good.",
        "Craig: I'm sure it's great. Tell me about it.",
        "Katie: Please, don't pretend like you care.",
        "Craig: I do. I really care. Is this some of the topics you're going to discuss?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I mean, it's a list of some possible segments, but it's none of your business.",
        "Craig: Well, maybe it should be my business. I can be very creative, you know.",
        "Katie: Oh, right. Maybe you can help me. You can help me with the how-to segment. You can teach the audience how to wreak havoc and alienate everyone in town.",
        "Craig: Oh, I don't think you need any help with that. You've done a pretty bang-up job yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, Will, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this, please. Okay.",
        "Gwen: Maddie, have you seen Will?",
        "Maddie: No, not since the Lakeview. I thought you two left together.",
        "Gwen: No, I caught up with him back at the house, but he wouldn't talk to me.",
        "Maddie: Poor Casey.",
        "Gwen: You feel sorry for him?",
        "Maddie: Well, it's scary getting arrested.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but he did steal Will's money, and let everybody, including me, believe that Will was responsible for it.",
        "Maddie: He had to have had a reason.",
        "Gwen: Right. Do you know if Adam is in there with him?",
        "Maddie: No, he was, but he left.",
        "Gwen: When?",
        "Maddie: Pretty soon after he got here. He just took off. He didn't even say good-bye or anything.",
        "Gwen: Maybe Will's with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: Yeah, what's the departure time on that? Okay, good, I can make that if I hurry. Where's it headed? London? Great, how many seats left? Okay, book me one of those. The name's Munson. Adam Munson.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Adam didn't answer?",
        "Gwen: No, I hope Will got in touch with him. Maybe he can get him to understand.",
        "Maddie: It's going to be okay.",
        "Gwen: I just -- I don't understand how Casey could do this to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I stole the bonds from the safe at Crash. It was just me, nobody else.",
        "Tom: Well, so you said. It would have been helpful if you had mentioned it to your mother and me before telling an arresting officer.",
        "Casey: Well, Maddie was telling everyone that Elwood did it, and he didn't do it. It was me. I couldn't let people think he did it.",
        "Margo: Because you were in debt.",
        "Tom: Well, how much money could you have possibly lost?",
        "Casey: All the money you and Mom gave me, everything I made at Crash -- I gambled it all away. And then I couldn't stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I was on the phone with Daniel. He called to wish me luck.",
        "Dusty: You got a nice kid.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know I do. And then that guy --",
        "Dusty: Kellman?",
        "Emily: Well, he didn't bother to introduce himself to me. You see, he just started yelling at me about how Lucinda never should have bought \"The Intruder\" and how it definitely shouldn't be run by a woman who spent time in a psych ward -- not to mention a jail.",
        "Dusty: What did you say?",
        "Emily: I told him I was on the phone with my son! Which, of course got him even more mad. You know what? I don't need this. I don't need any of this.",
        "Dusty: You don't need a job?",
        "Emily: There are other ways to make money, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: You're going to walk out on your paper and let Kellman run it?",
        "Emily: What? Are you telling me that that guy wants to run my paper?",
        "Dusty: Kellman wants your job. Are you going to let him have it?",
        "Emily: I don't know. What?",
        "Dusty: I thought today was the day.",
        "Emily: The day for what?",
        "Dusty: For proving these guys wrong.",
        "Emily: What do I get out of it, huh?",
        "Dusty: What do you want?",
        "Emily: Respect.",
        "Dusty: Well, then, go for it.",
        "Emily: But what about that guy --",
        "Dusty: That guy -- his name is Chauncey Kellman. You can handle him, believe me.",
        "Emily: And what if I can't?",
        "Dusty: I got your back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Don't even think of putting me in the same category with you. I still have friends, which is more than I can say for you.",
        "Craig: Name five. You can't, can you? Because you wrote a book that set off a chain of events that destroyed a family and lost your husband. And now you're paying the price.",
        "Katie: Gosh, Craig, what happened to your Charles Dickens moment? A few minutes ago, I was an adorable little moppet writing to Santa Claus, and now I'm the wicked witch of Oakdale. Which one is it?",
        "Craig: Oh, you're still an adorable little moppet. And I'm not judging you, I'm sympathizing. I'm sure when you wrote that book, you had no idea what you were setting in motion.",
        "Katie: I didn't. And I'm going to spend the rest of my life making amends. 'Cause I, unlike some people, know the meaning of remorse.",
        "Craig: Katie, I miss you. More than you can even imagine. And if that's not remorse, I don't know what is.",
        "Katie: Is this about Margo?",
        "Craig: No, it's about you and me. And despite our differences, we were always able to admit that we loved each other.",
        "Katie: So, you're not trying to get me to get her to give you another chance.",
        "Craig: What? Why would I do that?",
        "Katie: Because she's not talking to you. Because you had Daniel kidnapped!",
        "Craig: I did what?",
        "Kat: Oh, come on, don't play innocent. Tom had a heart attack because of all of that. If I was Margo, I wouldn't speak to you either!",
        "Craig: You know what you're saying is rumor and third-hand information, at best.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on, Craig, I know what I know, and I know I don't want to have anything to do with someone that would harm an innocent child.",
        "Craig: If Daniel was harmed, it certainly was not me.",
        "Katie: Well, because of you, then.",
        "Craig: And Carly Snyder's innocent children, harmed because of you, perhaps?",
        "Katie: How dare you!",
        "Craig: No, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait! It's just -- we have more in common than ever before. Can't we help each other?",
        "Katie: Help each other how?",
        "Craig: Katie, you're my sister --",
        "Katie: Get your hands off of me!",
        "Craig: Katie --",
        "Henry: Hey, hey, you heard her, Montgomery. Leave her alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Was that a phone call about Faith or Parker? Did someone find them?",
        "Dr. Seidman: I'm needed for a consult. Here is my pager number. Please, get in touch with me the minute you find them, okay? Listen, I'm sure they're fine. Kids their age love to test their independence.",
        "Lily: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
        "Jack: Thank you, Doctor.",
        "Lily: Jack, maybe you should go look for them. Maybe you should call the station, put a search party together.",
        "Jack: Let's just wait a little while longer, okay?",
        "Lily: Why? It's dark. Maybe somebody came in here, and saw them in the waiting room and took them!",
        "Jack: Given the mood that Parker's been in lately? 15 minutes tops, they'd give him right back.",
        "Lily: Faith, too. One minute she's a happy child, the next --",
        "Jack: Then they hit double digits and all bets are off, hmm? You want me to call Holden?",
        "Lily: No, no, no, no, no. He's on a trip. I don't want to worry him. And it's been less than a half an hour. It feels like an eternity. I think I'm going to drive around and look for them.",
        "Jack: No, hey, Lily, wait, come on! You know kids. Maybe they hit a vending machine, they're stuffing their faces, sitting around, talking about what lousy parents we are. Give it a few more minutes.",
        "Lily: How few?",
        "Jack: I've already alerted the hospital security. If they're safe and sound, I'd rather not make too big a deal out of this.",
        "Lily: But what if they're not?",
        "Jack: Ten minutes. Ten minutes and then we panic, okay?",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Jack: Truth be told, Parker's been doing this a lot lately. Sneaking out at night, skipping school. Faith hasn't done this before?",
        "Lily: She took off once on her horse.",
        "Jack: But that's not why you're here?",
        "Lily: No. Oh, my God, what if bringing her here was the worst possible thing I could do? What are you doing? Who are you calling?",
        "Jack: I am going to call hospital security. They were checking security tapes for me.",
        "Lily: Then they'll know if they left alone or if someone took them?",
        "Jack: Well, if they haven't spotted the two of them by now on their tapes, I'll go down and I'll check them myself. What's going on with you? You're so panicky --",
        "Lily: I'm just a little on edge. That's all.",
        "Jack: Yeah, hello, this is Detective Snyder again. Have you spotted those two kids on your tapes yet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: I'm glad we had enough money for these. I've never actually had coffee before. Only hot chocolate, but that has a lot of calories.",
        "Parker: Who cares about calories?",
        "Faith: No one.",
        "Parker: How come you were at the shrink?",
        "Faith: 'Cause my mom has a weight problem. She hates me for it. Isn't that your brother?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Faith: He looks really mad.",
        "Parker: He was born mad. Come on, let's go.",
        "Faith: Where?",
        "Parker: I don't know, let's just go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: And you said that there was a bond in your house? I mean, where do you think it came from?",
        "Gwen: Casey must have broken in and put it there.",
        "Maddie: He wouldn't do that!",
        "Gwen: Maddie, if he's capable of stealing, he's probably capable of --",
        "Maddie: Casey wouldn't -- he didn't do that, either, okay? He's protecting someone.",
        "Gwen: Who?",
        "Maddie: Elwood.",
        "Dallas: All right, so, just wait here.",
        "Elwood: Okay.",
        "Dallas: Stiles, help me log these in?",
        "Cop: What do you got?",
        "Dallas: Registered bonds. Evidence in the Hughes arrest. Found underneath the mattress in Casey's dorm room.",
        "Cop: Okay.",
        "Dallas: I'll be right back to take your statement, all right?",
        "Elwood: Yeah, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Dallas: Right.",
        "Maddie: Why is it that Casey's under arrest and you're walking free when you were the one that cashed the bonds? Why is Casey taking the rap?",
        "Elwood: Hey, hey, just 'cause I cashed them in doesn't mean I stole them.",
        "Gwen: And you know for a fact that Casey stole them?",
        "Elwood: Look, all I'm saying is Casey owed a ton of money to a zillion people, including me. And the bonds were his weird way of paying off, you know? Look, I may be a gambler, but unlike Maddie's boyfriend, I'm no thief.",
        "Gwen: I really messed this up. I have to go find Will.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, and you and I are going to have a little chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I've been gambling online, playing poker, for a long time.",
        "Margo: Well, Maddie said that you quit.",
        "Casey: I wish.",
        "Margo: So, that's why your grades are so bad? Because you've been online all the time?",
        "Tom: So, you've been failing classes?",
        "Casey: Almost.",
        "Tom: And why didn't you tell me?",
        "[Tom groans]",
        "Casey: Dad --",
        "Tom: I'm fine. I'm just angry.",
        "Margo: It's all right. You know what? I can finish this, I can do it alone.",
        "Tom: No, you can't. I'm his lawyer.",
        "Margo: All right, then would you please try and stay calm, please?",
        "Tom: Why didn't you tell me about Casey's grades?",
        "Casey: Because of your heart, Dad. We didn't want you to get upset.",
        "Tom: Did someone drag you into this gambling thing?",
        "Casey: No, it was -- it was just like playing a video game for fun, at first. And then you play a few hands, and then, you win more than you lose, you figure, why not jump in on a cash game? Make it interesting. Elwood and I, we got pretty good at it, and we figured out a way that we could make a lot of money playing together.",
        "Tom: And how did you figure that you two could win money playing together online?",
        "Casey: We -- we figured out a way to cheat.",
        "Margo: Oh, Casey.",
        "Casey: That's how I started owing money in the first place, so I'm sorry. This online gambling rep found out what we were doing, and then I had to pay back my winnings. So I borrowed the money.",
        "Margo: How much?",
        "Casey: About $2,800.",
        "[Tom groans]",
        "Margo: Good God! Who would cover a loan like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Going somewhere?",
        "Adam: Hey, yeah, I just got a call. There's some interest in Gwen's demo, I got to catch a flight and take care of that.",
        "Jade: Yeah, that sounds great.",
        "Adam: It is. Yeah, but you know, I'm going to be late for my flight, so --",
        "Jade: Oh, you can catch the next one, after you explain some things.",
        "Adam: I don't have time to deal with you, Jade.",
        "Jade: You made it look like Will stole those bonds.",
        "Adam: Why would I do something like that?",
        "Jade: So Gwen would doubt him and you could have a chance with her.",
        "Adam: That's just skewed, okay? And Casey already admitted he stole the bonds.",
        "Jade: Yeah, even if he did, you were the one who planted evidence against Will.",
        "Adam: How? How'd I do that?",
        "Jade: You did it, Adam.",
        "Adam: Prove it.",
        "Jade: You're heading out of town.",
        "Adam: I told you, I got a call, okay? I have to go. It can't be helped.",
        "Jade: While one of your brothers is in jail and the other one is trouble. Why don't you try again?",
        "Adam: Why is this your business?",
        "Jade: Will deserves better than this.",
        "Adam: Try again.",
        "Jade: You used me, Adam. And I am sick of having people think they can walk all over me and get away with it --",
        "Adam: Jade -- Baby, I didn't use you. I wanted you, okay? Just like you wanted me. And the sex was good, right?",
        "Jade: Yeah. Yeah, it was great. And I'm really going to miss you, Adam.",
        "Adam: I'll miss you, too.",
        "Jade: Why don't you give me a good-bye kiss?",
        "Adam: What -- what are you doing?",
        "Jade: Making sure you have an interesting trip. Fetch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elwood: And Casey kept losing. That's why he needed the money.",
        "Maddie: He told me he quit gambling. Why didn't I see it? If he was in trouble, why didn't I know?",
        "Elwood: I'm sure he just didn't want to hurt you. I mean, he's an addict, Maddie. They're good at hiding things.",
        "Dallas: Elwood, I'm ready to take your statement.",

        "Margo: So, all this happened because of gambling, but still, you didn't quit?",
        "Casey: I tried, Mom. I did. I tried a million times. But you know, you just keep thinking, one more round -- and then when you win, it feels like everything's going to be okay. So I'd get people to stake me and I'd pay back what I owed with my winnings. But then it got to where I owed way more than I could win. And it just got out of control.",
        "Tom: But you could have come to us, Casey.",
        "Casey: I wanted to. I really did. But your heart and --",

        "Margo: Tom, Tom!",
        "Tom: Okay? You have nobody to blame but yourself. We did not raise you to lie and steal. You owe us an explanation. Why didn't you come to us?",

        "Dusty: And if you had a relapse, would \"The Intruder\" fall apart?",
        "Emily: Are you asking me if \"The Intruder\" can run without me? Yes, it can. And you will probably make a profit. But with me onboard, Worldwide will make a much larger, more consistent profit.",

        "Emily: Because I don't look down at the people who read my product. And you see, I know for a fact, you're legitimate newspaper numbers are dropping, while mine are steadily rising, fueled and supplemented by the web instead of competing with it. You bought this paper because you know it's a cash cow. And I'm here to tell all of you, that there is no better milkmaid to run this baby than me. And I've got the numbers to prove it.

        "Craig: Oh, woof, snarling dog right on cue. Easy, boy. Look, I'll leave you to you're delusions, but one day you're going to wake up and you're are going to realize that mike is not coming back, okay. He doesn't care and if you keep pushing away the people that do care, one day they won't come back either.",
        "Henry: Let us hope that he makes good on that threat.",
        "Katie: You know, he's right. Sometimes I feel like I've ruined as many lives as he has. And that's scary.",

        "Will: My wife did. Adam did. My mom did. Because you made them think that I did it!",
        "Tom: How on earth could Casey possibly --",
        "Will: He planted one of the bonds at my house and made it look like I stole my own money. Didn't you! Tell them you did it! You made sure Gwen would find it. And you knew that she would think that I stole the money from Lisa's. And if she told that would be enough for the cops to come after me instead of you! You planted the money and you kept your mouth shut, just enough to get off clean, right? Except you didn't care that it was going to ruin my life, my marriage. How could you do that, Casey? How could you set me up like that? You're supposed to be my friend.",
        "Tom: Will, Margo and I need to talk to Casey privately.",
        "Will: Why, so he can tell you more lies? You were so sure everyone would believe I was such a jealous maniac. It wouldn't be such a stretch that I'd sabotage Gwen's career, right?",
        "Margo: All right, that's enough Will!",
        "Will: I'm not leaving until he admits what he did!",

        "Jack: Oh, you're in trouble, that's for sure. How much yet? I really don't know. Do you have any idea how terrified I was that something awful happened to you. What's the point of having a cell phone, Parker, if you're not going to answer it?",
        "Parker: I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Okay. Right now, I'm a little more relieved than I am mad, but that's going to change. It will, and when it does, you'll probably be grounded for a while.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Jack: About the therapist -- listen, I know how difficult it is without your mom here. I do. I know how hurt you are. But one thing I can promise for sure is that everything is going to get better if we work together. If we communicate with each other. You see, if we help each other. Then everything will be okay. Do you believe me?",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Do you understand running off like that it was thoughtless and dangerous? I didn't want to scold you in front of Parker, but you should never, never should've run off like that. You should have waited for me.",
        "Faith: I did. You were late. You forgot about me as usual.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Stiles: No problem.",
        "Margo: Man, this just gets worse and worse.",
        "Tom: It is certainly going to complicate Casey's defense. We need to get over to the courthouse before Will's statement goes into the system. If the judge tries to slap on an obstruction of justice charge, he'll never get out if here tonight.",
        "Margo: No, no, I'm not going to leave Casey now.",
        "Tom: We need to go talk to the judge, tell him that we support our son, otherwise he goes into lock up. We need to talk to the judge now.",

        "Casey: It's like Will said. I stole the money, and I didn't want to get caught.",
        "Maddie: So you framed your best friend?",
        "Casey: I was desperate.",
        "Maddie: Just now, with Will, why didn't you defend yourself?",
        "Casey: What was I supposed to say?",
        "Maddie: Something's not right.",
        "Casey: Maddie, don't start --",
        "Maddie: You wouldn't do that to Will. You wouldn't plant a bond in his house. That's just too sneaky.",
        "Casey: Fine! Then I'm a sneak, I'm a thief and I'm a lousy best friend! I admit it all of it! So just leave it alone.",
        "Maddie: You want me to leave it alone because there's more to it, and you know that I won't stop until I figure it out.",
        "Casey: There's nothing to figure out.",
        "Maddie: Okay, okay, we'll start simple. If you didn't do it, somebody else did. Who did it, Casey? Listen to me, I was really mad that you lied to me about the gambling. But if you keep lying to me about this, you're going to end up with a huge jail sentence for something you didn't even do and --",
        "Casey: You'll hate me?",
        "Maddie: No, it'll break my heart. Because I'll never find anyone to love me the way that you do. Okay, so please, you have to tell me. Please -- tell me what you wouldn't tell your parents, and what you didn't tell Will. All right? Please tell me.",
