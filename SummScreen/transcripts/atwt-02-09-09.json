        "Henry and Carly try to come up with ways that they can get Metro back in the black when Craig arrives with ideas. Craig thinks that Henry's idea of new drinks \u0096 namely the Hopetini - is not thinking broadly enough. He thinks Carly needs her own label of alcohol. It takes a while, but Carly is intrigued. Carly and Craig have fun taking shots of Vodka, as they brainstorm. They finally come up with a name \u0096 Midnight Sun, as Carly draws a logo. Craig and Carly, in their inebriated state, agree to forge a partnership again. Craig flirts shamelessly with Carly, as they get more drunk, but Carly cautions that they will be just friends if they want to get into business together. Katie wants to continue to try to have a baby, but Brad is too concerned for her health. Katie tires to convince him every seductive way she can to reconsider, so Brad leaves. Brad opens up to Henry about Katie and her desire to get pregnant despite it being possibly harmful to her. Henry thinks he needs to put his foot down and demand they use protection. Katie is moping at home; she decides she will get pregnant no matter the risk when she throws away her birth control pills. She goes looking for Brad and convinces him that she doesn't want to be intimate to try to get pregnant. Brad falls for it when Katie implies that she has taken her pill. Paul calls Barbara for help, as he explains what happened to Eliza. Barbara agrees to come with money. Dusty demands to know from Josie where Paul is. Josie explains that she left Paul, who was heading home to Meg. Dusty doesn't believe her and drags her along as he checks out her story at Car Rental Agencies. Josie thinks that Dusty and Paul are alike \u0096 they both do whatever they want to get what they want and they don't worry about who they hurt in the process. Barbara comes to NYC with a distraught Meg in tow. Meg and Paul argue, as he assures her that he never meant to hurt her. They are coming up empty with the car agency and Paul wants to canvas the neighborhood, but a furious Meg won't let him out of her sight. Paul, Meg, Barbara, Dusty and Josie come face to face. After an initial altercation between Dusty and Paul, Barbara wants them to put aside their differences and find Eliza. They come up with more dead ends, as Dusty finally demands they go to the police. They are headed there when Paul sees his rental car. He races to look inside only to find Eliza's car seat empty. Meg is devastated and turns to find comfort in Dusty's arms, as a helpless Paul and Josie watch."

        "Henry: Happy days are here again.",
        "Carly: Oh Henry, what planet are you on? Don't you see all the red in this book? This economy is bleeding us dry.",
        "Henry: Well, speaking of dry, why don't you try the new martini I whipped up?",
        "Carly: No, Henry, you're not listening to me. I'm really serious. The money that Craig loaned to keep this place afloat, it's not going to get us much farther. If we don't turning a profit, we're going to be closed by St. Patrick's Day. So, while it may seem like a fantastic time to get loaded, we need to keep a clear head here.",
        "Henry: Our customers don't. They need a reason to part with their money. And there's a lot of reason right here.",
        "Carly: A martini?",
        "Henry: Not just any martini. A hopetini. A drink full of promise for the rosy days to come, infused with ingredients guaranteed to wash the blues away.",
        "Carly: What are you talking about?",
        "Henry: Listen, if people think they're spending their money on something special, they will keep spending it. And there's a lot of special in here.",
        "Carly: Is it legal?",
        "Henry: What do you think? No, mango juice -- [Both laugh] Mango juice, grenadine and just about everything I could find in the fridge. But I'm telling you, if people down about three of these, they will see the light and we'll be back in business.",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "Henry: Carly, if cosmetic companies can sell hope in a jar for 100 bucks a pop, we can sell it in a martini for ten. Please, I guarantee your outlook on the world will be ever so much rosier.",
        "Craig: Isn't it a bit early in the day?",
        "Carly: Oh, get off your high horse, Mr. Montgomery. This is strictly business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Katie?",
        "Katie: I'll be right out.",
        "Brad: Hey, you know, I got a feast of comfort food. I got you your cole slaw, I got your cornbread, I got your honey glazed -- Honey -- you look hot. You look really, really hot. Okay, code blue, code blue, code blue, code blue.",
        "Katie: What's wrong?",
        "Brad: We can't do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: How did you find me?",
        "Dusty: It wasn't hard. Where's Paul?",
        "Josie: You're too late.",
        "Dusty: Stop covering for him.",
        "Josie: I'm not covering for him.",
        "Dusty: Tell me where he took Eliza. Tell me!",
        "Josie: He's on his way back to Oakdale. He's bringing the baby back to Meg.",
        "Dusty: Don't lie to me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Stop! There's a baby in that car! Oh, what am I going to? What am I going to do? Meg! What am I going to tell her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Oh God, please bring my baby home safe.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: Paul? Paul, are you there?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm here.",
        "Meg: I know I said to call on your way, but I didn't expect to hear from you this soon. Is Eliza okay?",
        "Paul: Meg, I'm not sure.",
        "Meg: What do you mean?",
        "Paul: Something's happened.",
        "Meg: Paul, you promised. You gave me your word.",
        "Paul: And I meant it.",
        "Meg: Why are you doing this to me? Bring my baby home. I trusted you.",
        "Paul: Look, I was on my way there. I had to get some cash.",
        "Meg: What are you talking about?",
        "Paul: I didn't see -- I didn't realize -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Meg: What's going on? What happened?",
        "Paul: She's gone. Eliza's gone. I was doing exactly what I promised you I would do, Meg. I was with Eliza, and we were on our way back to you.",
        "Meg: Liar.",
        "Paul: No, it's the truth. I swear to God, it's the truth. And then something happened. Someone took her.",
        "Meg: What? Who?",
        "Paul: I don't know who. But -- I will get her back. I swear to you, I swear to God, I won't rest until I get our little girl back.",
        "Meg: No, you're making this up. You want me to think that you don't have her, so you can take her away and I won't be able to find her.",
        "Paul: No, I wouldn't do that. Look, I know I shouldn't have taken her. I was so scared that I would never see her, that I was going to lose her! I know I shouldn't have done it.",
        "Meg: Stop making excuses and bring her home!",
        "Paul: I will. As soon as I figure out who took the car.",
        "Meg: What car?",
        "Paul: The rental car. I stopped the rental car to go to the ATM to get some cash. And then, the next thing I know, I was on the ground and the car was gone, and Eliza was in the back seat.",
        "Meg: You left her alone?",
        "Paul: For seconds. And I was never more than just a few feet away.",
        "Meg: Okay, tell me where you are, all right? Tell me where you are, and I'm going to come, and I'm going help you find her, all right?",
        "Paul: No, you're going to call the police.",
        "Meg: Do you realize what you're doing to me? I need to know where you are!",
        "Paul: No. You give me a chance to find her. I swear to God, I won't let you down.",
        "Meg: Paul! Paul! Paul!",
        "[Meg sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: Let go of me.",
        "Dusty: Tell the truth.",
        "Josie: Stop treating me like a criminal.",
        "Dusty: You helped someone kidnap a kid.",
        "Josie: I didn't help Paul.",
        "Dusty: Oh, it's just a coincidence that I got your good-bye note at the same time Paul kidnapped Eliza?",
        "Josie: I didn't even know that they were in my car until I heard Eliza cry. Paul was hiding with her in the back seat. I felt what I thought was a gun on my back, and Paul ordered me to drive him to New York.",
        "Dusty: No opportunities to grab the kid and run?",
        "Josie: He didn't trust me enough to leave me alone with her for one minute. The one time he did, he caught me calling you.",
        "Dusty: Where is she?",
        "Josie: I told you. He's taking her back home now.",
        "Dusty: You expect me to believe this?",
        "Josie: I don't care what you believe.",
        "Dusty: Well, what changed his mind?",
        "Josie: I went through all of the reasons with him that he would never get away with it, and he realized that I was right. Now look, I didn't ask to be a part of this. And now I am out of it. So can I please just go?",
        "Dusty: I ought to let you go, just like that, huh?",
        "Josie: Why not? You have no reason to stay here. If you get back to Oakdale quickly enough, you could be in time for the mother and child reunion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Come on, come on, come on.",
        "Katie: What is the problem?",
        "Brad: You know what the problem is. Bob says you need your rest.",
        "Katie: So I'll lie back and you can do the work.",
        "Brad: No, I'm not taking any risks where your health is concerned, okay? Bob says you can't be trying to get pregnant right now. And you know?",
        "Katie: But he didn't say that we couldn't have sex, did he?",
        "Brad: I mean, that's all you want?",
        "Katie: Don't you?",
        "Brad: You have no idea.",
        "Katie: I have a rough idea.",
        "Brad: We're safe, right? The thingy -- is that in? No thingy, no sex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You can't get enough of me, can you?",
        "Craig: Well, I did wonder if you enjoyed our morning in the bushes as much as I did.",
        "Henry: Should I leave?",
        "Craig: And now that my son is home from school and napping safely under the watchful eye of his nanny, I thought it was a good time to come down and check into my investment.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, no, no, no. That was a loan, not an investment. And I'm going to pay you back, just as soon as I can get people to stop worrying about their 401ks and start having fun again.",
        "Henry: And I was just telling Carly how we are going to do that.",
        "Craig: Really? I'm all ears.",
        "Henry: Well, we need to give our clients the one thing they need the most. Introducing the hopetini -- a combination of alcohol, fruit and mystery juices, that is guaranteed to lift the spirits of even the most economically challenged. Go ahead, try it.",
        "Craig: Well, that'll give them hope, all right. Hope that they never have to come back in here.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on. It can't be that bad.",
        "Craig: You didn't even try it first? Did you?",
        "Carly: I was about to, when you came in here and being all judgmental.",
        "Henry: Yes, it does need some work. However, I dare you to come up with something better.",
        "Craig: I could do that with one arm tied behind my back.",
        "Henry: Oh, okay. Well, then I'll leave you to it.",
        "Carly: No, Henry, he didn't mean that.",
        "Craig: Yes, actually, I did.",
        "Henry: I'm not going to stay here to be criticized. Call me when the critics have left.",
        "Carly: Henry!",
        "Craig: Carly, a new drink menu is not nearly enough to turn your business around.",
        "Carly: Who asked you?",
        "Craig: No one. But since I have a lot more experience in business than you do, maybe you should start listening.",
        "Carly: Thanks, but Henry and I will think of something.",
        "Craig: Hope in a glass? Carly, you're thinking too small.",
        "Carly: And you're not thinking at all. If you were, you'd realize that you've overstayed your welcome, Craig. Yet again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Yes, my baby was in the car! Please, just call the police and give them the license number. And when they find her, tell them to bring her to you. And I will come pick her up. Oh, Eliza, hang on. Hang on, Eliza.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Barbara: Paul? Thank God!",
        "Paul: Yeah, Mom, I need your help.",
        "Barbara: Are you and Eliza all right? I have been so worried.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know.",
        "Barbara: Look, you've got to bring her home. And if you do it soon, I don't think that Meg will press charges.",
        "Paul: Mom, you need to shut up for a second and just listen, okay? I'm in trouble.",
        "Barbara: What happened? Did you get arrested?",
        "Paul: No, it's Eliza. I was on my way. I was bringing her home.",
        "Barbara: I knew it. I told Meg that you would come to your senses.",
        "Paul: Mom, I got carjacked.",
        "Barbara: What? What happened? Are you all right? Is the baby -- the baby's not hurt, is she?",
        "Paul: I don't know. Some thug, he knocked me out. And the next thing I know, the car is going away. And she's in the back of the car.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God, Paul.",
        "Paul: Look, I called Meg. I've already told her. And I promised that I would bring her back. But I need your help.",
        "Barbara: Well, what can I do?",
        "Paul: Well, I think maybe I could get some information if word gets out that I'm willing to pay for it.",
        "Barbara: Honey, Honey, Honey, you can't play the hero. Just call the police and let them take care of this.",
        "Paul: Look, Mom, I don't have a lot of time. Meg probably already called the cops. And she should. But I'm going to get my little girl before they take me in.",
        "Barbara: Where are you right now?",
        "Paul: I'm at the rental car agency. I'm hoping that the cops find the car and bring Eliza back here.",
        "Barbara: All right, all right. I'll come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: It's been an hour and she's still not picking up the phone.",
        "Josie: You can't hold me hostage just because Meg's not taking your calls.",
        "Dusty: If Paul were bringing the baby back to Meg, she'd call me.",
        "Josie: Maybe not. He just left! He rented a car. He might not have even told her he was coming.",
        "Dusty: Which agency did he rent the car from?",
        "Josie: I don't know.",
        "Dusty: You weren't there when he got it?",
        "Josie: I left him at the TV studio we were hiding in. He said he was just going to walk around until he found a rental agency.",
        "Dusty: In the cold? With a baby?",
        "Josie: Paul took good care of Eliza. He was always worried if she was hungry or tired --",
        "Dusty: Or kidnapped, stolen from her mother?",
        "Josie: I'm just saying, he wouldn't let anything happen to her.",
        "Dusty: Well, that remains to be seen. Let's go.",
        "Josie: Where?",
        "Dusty: Let's go pick up your car.",
        "Josie: I told you --",
        "Dusty: Find out where Paul picked up his rental.",
        "Josie: I don't know where he picked up his rental.",
        "Dusty: Maybe you don't want to be there when I find out he didn't rent a car at all.",
        "Josie: Okay, you know what? If going with you is the only way to make you believe I'm telling the truth, then let's get started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, boy. All right. Since you're obviously not going to leave until you've had your say, go ahead. Tell me how you're going to spare me from gloom and doom.",
        "Craig: Well, as I was saying, you need to think bigger, Carly. Any old club can create a new cocktail or two. What you need is your own brand.",
        "Carly: Like soap?",
        "Craig: Or cereal or shampoo or vodka. As in, designer vodka.",
        "Carly: You're kidding, right?",
        "Craig: Haven't you heard? Vodka is the new form of artistic expression of the fashion elite. And since you happen to be a designer already in your own right --",
        "Carly: Okay, so you want me to go from approving fabric swatches to making moonshine?",
        "Craig: Not exactly.",
        "Carly: Craig, I don't have the foggiest idea how to make vodka.",
        "Craig: You don't have to. It's not about what's in the bottle, it's about what's on the bottle. Namely, you. Or at least a creative manifestation of you. If you were to come up with an out-of-this-world label, I guarantee you we would have more business than we ever imagined.",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Carly: Well, I hate to confess it, but I am a little intrigued.",
        "Craig: I thought you might be.",
        "Carly: I just have one little question, though. What do you mean, \"We\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. All right, all right, all right. All right. You're mad.",
        "Katie: No, I'm not mad. But if you're not going to have sex with me, I might as well do something productive.",
        "Brad: I always want to have sex with you. Just not if it means getting you pregnant. At least not right now.",
        "Katie: Isn't that why we got together in the first place, to have a baby?",
        "Brad: Yeah, it wasn't a health risk at the time.",
        "Katie: I've been doing a lot of reading, actually, since we talked to Bob. And I'm not so convinced that it's such a big risk.",
        "Brad: Bob's a good doctor.",
        "Katie: He's a great doctor. But he's very conservative.",
        "Brad: That's fine. When it comes to you, I don't take risks, I don't take chances. All right? You know, and he says you're not supposed to be getting pregnant right now. That's that.",
        "Katie: But it's my body! If I want to take the chance, why can't you?",
        "Brad: Will you listen to me? I love you too much to put you at risk for anything, including a baby. Come on. Come on, look at me. Look at me. It's going to happen.",
        "Katie: What if it doesn't?",
        "Brad: I'm okay with that.",
        "Katie: Because you already have a child.",
        "Brad: No. No, no, no, no, no. Because I have you. And you're enough for me. So for now, can you just try to let me be enough for you? Even in sweats, you're irresistible. Oh, and I'm out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Police siren blaring]",
        "Paul: Yeah, I just called about the carjacking. Look, you told the police that there was a baby in the car, right? I don't understand. I mean, I called as soon as the guy drove away. How far could he have gone? Yeah, I'm sure everybody is trying their hardest, but it doesn't seem to be working. So maybe they should try harder, huh? Hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Dusty: I'm not taking any chances. You'll probably leave and tip off Ryan.",
        "Josie: I don't even know where he is.",
        "Dusty: So you say.",
        "Josie: You really think I'd lie about that? Look, I got Paul to agree to bring her back. What more do you want from me?",
        "Dusty: Well, we don't even know if he did that yet. Until we do, you're sticking with me.",
        "Josie: And, what? I just sit here in the car, while you go check every car rental agency in the neighborhood?",
        "Dusty: No. You're coming with me. Paul rented a car from one of these agencies, and we're not going to stop until we figure out which one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Thank God. I don't know how you got here so quickly --",
        "Barbara: I did.",
        "Paul: Please tell me you have this money.",
        "Barbara: I've got everything you need. There's something else you need to know.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: Where is she? What have you done with my baby? I have had all I can take. Give her back to me, Paul. I know you have her!",
        "Paul: I wouldn't do something like that to you. I would never torture you like that.",
        "Meg: You already have. You left me wondering if I'd ever see my baby again. You left me with no idea of what had happened to her. Or wondering if she had suffered. Or wondering if she was --",
        "Paul: I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: No, you're not. You're not, Paul. You wanted to hurt me because I left you, and you did. Okay, it wasn't enough that I already lost one child because of you and your insane jealousy. Now you've taken another one from me?",
        "Paul: No, I would never do anything like that. You have to know that I would never hurt you like that.",
        "Meg: No, I don't know anything anymore. Everything you've said to me has been a lie for so long.",
        "Paul: I never lied to you. I didn't lie when I said I loved you. I didn't lie when I said that I love Eliza. I would never intentionally hurt either one of you. Please.",
        "Meg: What happened to you?",
        "Barbara: What's that? What's that, what is it?",
        "Paul: Nothing. The guy who took the car, he hit me over the head.",
        "Barbara: You need to see a doctor.",
        "Paul: No, I need to find my child.",
        "Meg: My child!",
        "Barbara: Are you sure that you're all right?",
        "Paul: I'm -- Mother, I'm fine.",
        "Barbara: Tell me what happened after we last spoke.",
        "Paul: I called the rental agency. They called the police, they reported the car stolen. And they're gonna -- they're trying to track it down.",
        "Meg: Do they know there's a baby in the car?",
        "Paul: Yes, of course they know there's a baby in the car. That's the first thing I told them. Well I don't know, Meg! It's a big city. But look, I'm hoping that they return the car, the cops will find it, and bring it to the rental agency with Eliza safely in the back seat.",
        "Meg: And what if they don't? What if they've done something to her?",
        "[Meg sobbing]",
        "Barbara: It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You can't have a problem working with me. I mean, it's not as if we haven't done it before.",
        "Carly: That was then, Craig. This is now.",
        "Craig: But together is the only way that this could work. You see, you would be the image. The charming spokesperson with her signature on every label. I would be the money, investing in the product, overseeing distribution.",
        "Carly: Hmm. You've got it all figured out, haven't you? What's next, a national ad campaign?",
        "Craig: Why not international?",
        "Carly: You're serious.",
        "Craig: Absolutely. j",
        "Carly: Craig, in this economy, do you think people are really going to spend a lot of money on some fancy bottle of booze?",
        "Craig: You know, Henry wasn't too far off the mark. In the concept, anyway. People do need hope. But more than that, they need escape. And what better place to find that than inside of a vodka bottle, wrapped in your lovely design?",
        "Carly: Well, aren't we forgetting something here? Aren't we forgetting what's in that lovely designed bottle?",
        "Craig: Well, we wouldn't be the first entrepreneurs to jump into the pool without knowing how to swim. Lucky for us, most vodkas are the same, except for the label.",
        "Carly: I think there are some pretty big name distillers who would disagree with you there.",
        "Craig: Only because they don't want to admit that I'm right.",
        "Carly: You're pretty sure of yourself, huh?",
        "Craig: Isn't that why you like me?",
        "Carly: Is that what this is about? You trying to get me to admit that I like you?",
        "Craig: It's about showing how much I like you. And I'd hate to see you crash and burn with this bar.",
        "Carly: Boy, you're laying it on thick, aren't you?",
        "Craig: Carly, when are you going to take back the controls and start living the life that you deserve to live?",
        "Carly: You're absolutely right. I mean, really, what do I have left to lose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Oh, come on. Things can't be that bad.",
        "Henry: Actually, they are.",
        "Brad: Not you and Vienna?",
        "Henry: No, no. Me and Carly.",
        "Brad: What? No way, what is with that woman? First Holden, now you.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no. It's not like -- no, no, back up. It's business. It's Metro business. I'm here checking out the competition to get some ideas on how to bring in more customers.",
        "Brad: Good for you.",
        "Henry: And what is your excuse for being in a bar in the middle of the day?",
        "Brad: It's me and Katie.",
        "Henry: What? I thought things were back on track with you guys.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you know, they are. It's just, you know, until she decided that all she wants to do is have sex.",
        "Henry: And this is a problem, why, exactly?",
        "Brad: Because it's all about procreation.",
        "Henry: I thought that was the goal now, and the premise of your new TV show.",
        "Brad: It was. But we can't now. I mean, not after everything Katie's body's been through with the bone marrow transplant for Johnny. And you know, she's just not supposed to get pregnant for a while.",
        "Henry: She must be devastated. If there's one thing that she hates, it's not getting what she wants right when she wants it. And she's wanted a baby for as long as I can remember.",
        "Brad: Yeah. Yeah, she's really bummed. I mean, it doesn't mean she can never have kids. She just has to wait.",
        "Henry: Well, if you ask me, I think the whole baby-makes-three scenario is just completely overrated. I say wait forever.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you don't have a woman chasing you around every chance she gets, though.",
        "Henry: Yes, I do.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but Vienna doesn't want to have a baby.",
        "Henry: Oh, no? Then why was she this close to going to the sperm bank earlier?",
        "Brad: I thought you guys didn't want to have kids.",
        "Henry: We didn't want to have kids, until she caught the baby bug from you and Katie. Fortunately, that didn't last very long.",
        "Brad: Don't get me wrong, I want to have a kid just as much as Katie does. You know, just not if it puts her health at risk.",
        "Henry: Then put your foot down.",
        "Brad: Why do you think I'm here?",
        "Henry: You don't have to swear off sex completely. I mean, there are precautions you can take to keep the stick from turning blue.",
        "Brad: Getting Katie to use them is the problem.",
        "Henry: If she won't, then it's up to you, my man. Put your foot down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: \"Mommy and me time.\" No, I am not giving up. No, I am not giving up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: When are you going to give up? We've been to, like, five rental places.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, and not one of them rented a car to Ryan. How is that possible?",
        "Josie: I know what you're thinking.",
        "Dusty: What I'm hoping is that you're not sending me on some wild goose chase so Paul has time to get away.",
        "Josie: You really think I'd do that?",
        "Dusty: You don't want me to answer that.",
        "Josie: You're right, I don't. Look, you have no reason to trust me. I let Paul hire me to pretend to channel Jennifer. And I lied about it. But you know what? I'm starting to think that wasn't the worst mistake I made.",
        "Dusty: What did you do that was worse?",
        "Josie: I fell in love with you. If I hadn't done that, you wouldn't still be able to hurt me so much.",
        "Dusty: There's another agency around the corner. Are you coming?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I just called the rental agency. There was still nothing.",
        "Meg: It was her favorite one. You gave it to her. Sometimes, when she got fussy, it was the only thing that calmed her down.",
        "Paul: I didn't know that. Maybe if I had --",
        "Meg: What, what? You would've made sure that you took it with you when you kidnapped her?",
        "Barbara: I keep trying to call my P.I. and the guy's not picking up.",
        "Paul: All right, give me back the money, and I'll canvas the neighborhood. And you two go back to the rental agency.",
        "Meg: And do what?",
        "Paul: And you tell them that you are her mother. And you show them your face. And maybe they'll call the cops and put some heat on this investigation. I'll be right back.",
        "Meg: You are not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I mean, you should've listened to me when I warned you about Paul. Now he forced you into being an accessory.",
        "Josie: If I'm an accessory, then so are you. When you married Meg, you pushed Paul over the edge. Did you really think that he wouldn't react to that? Or were you just not thinking about him at all?",
        "Dusty: I was trying to find my son.",
        "Josie: Oh, well that didn't work out so well, did it? Not only did you lose Johnny, but you turned Paul into a man desperate enough to resort to kidnapping.",
        "Dusty: Oh, okay, okay. It's me. I'm responsible for Paul's actions. I see.",
        "Josie: No, you two aren't that different, you know. You're both willing to do whatever it takes to get what you want, no matter who it hurts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: How do I know you won't take the money and leave?",
        "Paul: I would never do anything like that.",
        "Meg: You wouldn't even call the cops for fear that they would take you in. You only care about protecting yourself.",
        "Paul: That's not true. I want to find Eliza as much as you do.",
        "Meg: Oh, really? Okay, well, wherever you go, I'm going with you.",
        "Paul: Mom, would you please talk to her?",
        "Barbara: He's right, this could be dangerous.",
        "Meg: Okay, no, no, no, no, no! You're not going to talk me into letting him have his way. You started this, and I'm going to make sure that you see this through.",
        "Paul: Fine. Let's go.",
        "Dusty: Meg, what are you doing here?",
        "Paul: What'd you do? Hang up on me and hit speed dial?",
        "Meg: I told you to stay out of this.",
        "Dusty: I found out where they were. How could I stay out of it?",
        "Paul: You said you didn't tell him.",
        "Josie: I didn't.",
        "Dusty: Who cares what he thinks? He said he was going to bring the baby back to Meg. Where is she? Where's Eliza?",
        "Meg: She's gone.",
        "Dusty: Gone?",
        "Dusty: What did you do with her? Tell me.",
        "Meg: Hey, hey! Stop it!",
        "Dusty: Tell me!",
        "Paul: Get off of me, Dusty.",
        "Barbara: Paul was carjacked. Eliza was in the back seat when the car drove off.",
        "Dusty: How could you let someone take her?",
        "Paul: I didn't let anybody take her, you self-righteous son of a bitch!",
        "Barbara: Stop it, stop it! Right now! Okay? We all want the same thing. We just want to get our little girl back! So let's just put our heads together and figure out how we can make that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I've got to tell you, you're absolutely right. They pretty much all taste exactly the same to me.",
        "Craig: Which is why the vodka is almost unimportant. We can get any distiller to supply that. The magic is in the container. The shape of the bottle, the design on the label. We come up with the right combination, all we need is a distributor who has access to premium shelf space and we're set.",
        "Carly: And you think that I can come up with that combination?",
        "Craig: I think you were born to do it. And I think I was born to sell it. See, we're a team made in heaven.",
        "Carly: As long as we can keep things strictly business, Craig. Do you think you're capable of doing that?",
        "Craig: As irresistible as you are, I think I can handle it. Seriously, I provide the start-up money, you handle the creative end, we split the profits 50-50. So, do you think we should expand the line to include flavors?",
        "Carly: Hey, you know, I read something recently about some guy in Italy who came up with chocolate vodka. It's selling faster than they can make it.",
        "Craig: So you do know something about this.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. Reading one article in a travel magazine does not an expert make?",
        "Craig: It's a start. Try that, see if you like it.",
        "Carly: That's nice. It's sort of sweet and bitter at the same time.",
        "Craig: Kind of like a certain woman I know. Here, try that one. Uh-huh. Oh, that's hot.",
        "Carly: Oh, that's hot. It is.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Should be. It's chili pepper. All right.",
        "Carly: No, no, I think that's it.",
        "Craig: No, you want to get a feel for what you're selling, don't you?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I don't really feel much of anything right now, actually. And if I didn't know any better, I might think that you were trying to seduce me.",
        "Craig: I wouldn't need alcohol to do that.",
        "Carly: You think I'd be yours for the taking? Well, think again, okay? 'Cause if we're going to be working together, there's not going to be any hanky- panky. Got it?",
        "Craig: Well, you're the one who brought it up. And by the way, the only thing I'm interested these days is fatherhood and business.",
        "Carly: Right.",
        "Craig: Right. So get your mind out of the gutter. Tell me, do we have a deal or don't we?",
        "Carly: Deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I never thought I'd be hiding out in a bar to avoid having sex with my wife.",
        "Henry: Sex-starved spouse at 1:00.",
        "Katie: I thought I might find you here. Are you okay?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, just doing a little research and development. But you can have my seat. I think I'm all done here. Good luck.",
        "Brad: Are you coming here to tell me what a horrible husband I am for not wanting to have a baby with you?",
        "Katie: Do I look like I came to tell you you're a bad husband?",
        "[Brad scoffs]",
        "Brad: Are you trying to drive me crazy?",
        "Katie: No, not at all.",
        "Brad: Then why, when you know that we can't?",
        "Katie: We can.",
        "Brad: My mind hasn't changed, okay? I am not going to put your health in danger, damn it.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Brad: So this isn't about a baby?",
        "Katie: What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Well, what do you know? For once in your life, you told the truth.",
        "Paul: I was bringing her back.",
        "Dusty: The car agency's going to call if they hear anything. Meanwhile, we should go to the nearest police station and file a report.",
        "Paul: No, I'm going to stick around here.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Paul: Because I'm the only one who saw the guy who took the car. And he came up from behind, so I didn't see his face. But I could tell what he was wearing. Barbara's off, she's calling the P.I. I'm going to go to every one of these businesses and give them a description.",
        "Dusty: Well, give your description to the cops. Unless all you care about is saving your own skin.",
        "Paul: Look, you want to call the cops, you go right ahead. I'd go to jail forever if I thought it would bring our little girl home. Meg, you say the word, and I'll turn myself in.",
        "Meg: Dusty's right. The police need to talk to you.",
        "Paul: Fine.",
        "Meg: But if you didn't see a face, you won't be able to identify the carjacker in a mug shot.",
        "Dusty: Anything he can remember will help.",
        "Paul: I shouldn't have assumed that you betrayed me.",
        "Josie: It's okay.",
        "Paul: No, it's not. You gave me what will might be the last moments I have with my little girl. And I shouldn't forget that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: No, no I've had enough.",
        "Craig: Sit down, sit down. We're not finished. We have to come up with a name for our revolutionary new product.",
        "Carly: Well, whatever you think is fine with me.",
        "Craig: No. Now, we're partners. Besides, you're the creative end. I need your expertise. So take slow sips, and tell me what you see.",
        "Carly: Right now, I see a spinning room is what I see.",
        "Craig: Okay, just close your eyes and tell me what image comes to mind.",
        "Carly: Cool. Ice. Bright.",
        "Craig: What music do you hear?",
        "Carly: Mandolin, sweet and tragic.",
        "Craig: What do you feel?",
        "Carly: Smooth. Warm.",
        "Craig: Beautiful. It should be beautiful. And romantic. Think of a movie.",
        "Carly: Yes. Right. A classic. Way too long, hours long. Russian -- the funny hats.",
        "Craig: Oh, ah -- \"Dr. Zhivago.\"",
        "Carly: \"Dr. Zhivago.\" That's it. \"Land of the midnight sun.\"",
        "Craig: That's it!",
        "Carly: What? What's it?",
        "Craig: The name of our vodka! Midnight sun.",
        "Carly: Oh, I like it!",
        "Craig: Me, too. I like it a lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Are you sure everything's okay?",
        "Katie: Positive.",
        "Brad: And the thingy is?",
        "Katie: Right where it should be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I knew I could count on you. A label that tells the world, this is more, much more than a bottle of booze. This is a masterpiece.",
        "Carly: Well, I think since we're both three sheets to the wind, maybe we ought to just reserve judgment. Okay?",
        "Craig: Let's drink to it.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Really, I'd better not.",
        "Craig: One more won't hurt.",
        "Carly: Oh, all right. But that's it, then.",
        "Craig: To midnight sun. And all the possibilities it brings.",
        "Carly: To our new business partnership.",
        "Craig: Oh! Oh, you okay?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. Yep.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Carly: I think I should go home.",
        "Craig: Ah, you know, you're really in no condition to drive.",
        "Carly: I'm going to call a cab, then.",
        "Craig: Nonsense. I'll take you.",
        "Carly: You're as plastered as I am. I need a cab, please.",
        "Craig: We could share.",
        "Carly: I need two cabs, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Should be right around the corner.",
        "Paul: Here, here, let me help you. Come here -- just give me the bag.",

        "Dusty: Don't tell me you changed your mind about the cops.",

        "Paul: Right there!",
        "Meg: Eliza! My baby. My baby. My baby, let me see here. Oh, my God. Where is she, where is she, where is she? Where is my baby? Where is my baby?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Craig: We're running a little behind schedule. But you have to admit, that was important.",
