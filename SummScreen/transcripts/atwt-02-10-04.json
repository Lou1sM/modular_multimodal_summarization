        "Susan: Oh, Aaron, I hope you don't mind. I was just --",
        "Aaron: No, hey, you can clean the fridge, too, if you want. I'll come back later.",
        "Susan: Oh, no thanks. I've seen that fridge.",
        "Aaron: You here to see Alison?",
        "Susan: Yes, and the door was open, so I just, yeah, walked right in. Hey, I was wondering if Alison had had second thoughts about moving in here with you.",
        "Aaron: No, she hasn't mentioned it to me.",
        "Susan: Really? Because she hasn't unpacked her bag yet. I couldn't help but notice --",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Susan: Do you know where she went?",
        "Aaron: I think Emily took her to a support group.",
        "Susan: Oh. What support group?",
        "Aaron: It's, like, for people who've lost their babies. You know, she thought it would be a good idea if she attended.",
        "Susan: Oh, it probably will be.",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Susan: Well, maybe this gives us a chance to have a chat. You and me. I thought you might want to know that I've taken out a restraining order against Chris.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, Ali told me. Very good move.",
        "Susan: He came to the house and -- but mainly I did it because of what you told the police in Chicago. And I've been wanting to go over that with you, because Chris keeps insisting that he's innocent. Are you absolutely sure that you saw Chris push Alison off that ledge?",
        "Aaron: As sure as I am standing here, Susan. He did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I'm walking around missing a child that I never even had. I guess I didn't realize how much I wanted to be a father until it was too late.",
        "Jill: Why don't we all just take a short break?",
        "Chris: I didn't expect to see anybody that I knew.",
        "Emily: Neither did we.",
        "Chris: Don't worry. I'll be out of your way in a minute.",
        "Alison: No, Chris, wait.",
        "Chris: Alison, your mother got a restraining order against me, okay? I don't want any more trouble.",
        "Alison: I know, but I still think that you should stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hey, there you go. Contracts to the B.R.O. Valentine's Day party. It's got names, dates, liabilities, everything else you might need. If you need anything else, just call me whenever.",
        "Paul: Thank you very much, Molly. So, you hear anything from Craig?",
        "Molly: No, Paul, he's probably too busy watching his family fall apart.",
        "Paul: Because of me.",
        "Molly: Us. You may have busted in with the Mounties, but I'm the one that told you about the illegal adoption in the first place.",
        "Paul: Well, some people might say you and I make a good team.",
        "Molly: Well, I wouldn't be one of them.",
        "Paul: If you're gonna adopt a baby, you can't cut corners. Craig played fast and loose with a human life. He deserves everything he gets.",
        "Molly: Are you saying you're happy with the way things turned out?",
        "Paul: It's not a matter of being happy or unhappy. I just did what had to be done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You're going to regret that APB, Jack. We can find Rosanna and Cabot on our own.",
        "Jack: Yeah, with the Canadian Police force breathing down our neck? Listen, once Special Investigator Filloux showed up, it was over, Craig. He knew there was no baby upstairs. And now he knows that Rosanna's breaking the law!",
        "Craig: She is protecting her family!",
        "Jack: No, she was trying to hide from the truth. That her husband's involved in an illegal adoption and that she's going to have to give up that child.",
        "Craig: But that has yet to be decided, Jack. Rosanna and I have resour -- we have plenty of resources. We can still find a way to keep Cabot.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder. Well, thanks for letting me know, Emil. All right. That was our friend the investigator.",
        "Craig: Did they find Rosanna?",
        "Jack: No, but they got in touch with Cabot's birth mother. She's been worried sick these past few months, Craig. She wants her baby back as soon as she can get him. So, so much for your negotiation. There's no way you're keeping that child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look, I realize it's a risk. But the only way that I can keep Cabot is for us to both leave the country.",
        "Carly: I know what he means to you. But running away is not the way to fight this.",
        "Rosanna: Look, are you saying you're not gonna help me?",
        "Carly: Rosanna, I got you out of Oakdale so we could regroup and make a plan. So why don't we do that? Maybe we could come up with something --",
        "Rosanna: You know, you can help me or not. But I am taking Cabot, and we are going to disappear. That is my decision. And not you, or anybody else is gonna stop me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jill: Would anyone else like to share? What about our new arrivals?",
        "Emily: Well, actually, I'm just here for moral support. I'm the one who suggested that my little sister come here tonight. But I told her that, you know, if she didn't feel comfortable, she didn't have to say anything.",
        "Alison: Right. And I -- I don't feel ready yet.",
        "Jill: That's all right, no pressure. You're just welcome to stay and listen.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Jill: You know, we still have some time left. Would anyone else like to --",
        "Alison: Wait. Maybe I'm just putting this off. I have some things that I need to say. So maybe now's the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: You know, there was a time, Paul, not very long ago, when I was able to read people like a book. Just by a gesture, maybe something that they said, but, I swear to God, the longer I know you, the less I know about you.",
        "Paul: Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.",
        "Molly: Well, you can start by telling me the real reason you're going after Craig about Cabot's adoption.",
        "Paul: I thought I was perfectly clear. What Craig did was unjustifiable.",
        "Molly: What? Going up to Canada to buy himself a baby? Or trying to frame you for Rose's murder? That's what I thought. This was all just payback, wasn't it?",
        "Paul: If Craig had gotten his way, I'd be serving a life sentence for Rose's murder. The woman I was very much in love with. Did you really think I could just turn the other cheek?",
        "Molly: I don't blame you for wanting to punish Craig. But what about Rosanna, Paul? Did she deserve to be punished, too?",
        "Paul: I'm very sorry that Rosanna's in the middle of all of this.",
        "Molly: And don't get me wrong. We are not friends or anything. But she's a mother. And I've seen her with Cabot, and she loves him very much.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, it's not over yet. Rosanna could wind up keeping Cabot when all is said and done.",
        "Molly: How?",
        "Paul: Unfit mother. Birth mother could be unfit. Criminal, history of drug abuse.",
        "Molly: Oh, come on, that is so wishful thinking, and you know it.",
        "Paul: Come on, Molly. You got something against happy endings?",
        "Molly: No, I don't. But if Rosanna loses Cabot, she's not gonna be happy for a very long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: When Cabot's mother -- when she sees how much he means to us, there's gotta -- who's to say she won't be eager to keep him in our lives like that?",
        "Jack: Would you be if positions were reversed?",
        "Craig: Well, Jack, I'm trying to work on some constructive solution here.",
        "Jack: It's a little late for that, Craig. I mean, even you had to know that your little game wouldn't last, right? And pinning your hopes on some poor kid who had her baby stolen, it's not constructive, buddy, it's deluded.",
        "Craig: I called her once.",
        "Jack: Who?",
        "Craig: Cabot's mother.",
        "Jack: How'd that happen?",
        "Craig: I got the number from Annabelle Fettle, the broker. I wanted to make sure that the adoption was -- but when I heard her voice, I -- I hung up. I was afraid of what I was gonna find out.",
        "Jack: Okay, what you gotta get straight is that your problems, they weren't caused by Annabelle Fettle or Cabot's mother. You brought these on yourself.",
        "Craig: You enjoying this, Jack? Enjoying watching this get all dissolved in front of my --",
        "Jack: No. No, I'm not. Maybe I should be. But I -- I know what you're going through, Craig. I know how deep that pain goes and how long it lasts. Because, you know, even to this day, I'm constantly wondering what JJ is doing, and what he looks like and -- the difference is, you did this to yourself. So I'm sorry, you don't deserve any sympathy, from me or anybody else. Not this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna, you are my sister. I want you to be happy, but this has gone way too far. If you try to leave the country with Cabot, I'm gonna have to try to stop you.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's great. Thank you. Thank you for your support. The door is that way.",
        "Carly: No, Rosanna, please --",
        "Rosanna: No, what? Listen to reason? There is nothing reasonable about this.",
        "Carly: I know that. It's horrible. But breaking the law is not the way to solve it.",
        "Rosanna: You know, you're really incredible. I thought that I could count on you. But instead, you're just like Craig. You're all talk. You're never there when I really need you.",
        "Carly: Who are you calling?",
        "Rosanna: I'm gonna call my assistant. If I have to resort to paying for loyalty, so be it.",
        "Carly: No, listen to me. Just listen --",
        "Rosanna: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Leave that alone.",
        "Carly: Please. Just hear me out. Before I go.",
        "Rosanna: All right, I'm listening.",
        "Carly: If you leave the country with Cabot, you will be making a bad situation even worse. And any chance that you have of keeping Cabot legally will be gone.",
        "Rosanna: It's already gone. After what Craig has done, no court in the world is gonna let me keep him.",
        "Carly: No, Rosanna, you don't know that for sure.",
        "Rosanna: But I'm not gonna stand around and wait to find out. I'm Cabot's mother. I don't need a judge to tell me that.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, he has another mother. The woman who carried him for nine months. The woman who gave birth to him.",
        "Rosanna: But Cabot has no idea she even exists.",
        "Carly: But she knows he does. She could have lost a baby that she loves very much.",
        "Rosanna: That's not my fault!",
        "Carly: Okay, Rosanna, say you stick to your guns, and you do try and leave the country. The police are gonna be looking for you. You can't just hop on a plane.",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's fine. I'll find another way about it. You know, that's the good thing about money. It buys you options.",
        "Carly: And then what? You live the rest of your life as a fugitive? Wondering if that next phone call is gonna be the one that lands you in jail?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know what I'm gonna do. It'll be a different kind of life, I'm sure, but at least I will be with Cabot.",
        "Carly: In constant danger. And in the end, Rosanna, you will still lose him. Eventually, they will find you. You know they will find you.",
        "Rosanna: It's not -- it's not fair.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Rosanna: It wasn't supposed to be like this.",
        "Carly: I know. The important thing is that you keep Cabot safe. That you keep yourself safe.",
        "[Rosanna sobbing]",
        "Rosanna: I don't want to go back to Oakdale and just hand him to some stranger. I can't do that. I have to have some time.",
        "Carly: Yes. You can take all the time you want. I'll call Jack, and I'll tell him we're on our way.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Hey, maybe you could just -- maybe you could just go and find him, you know? And ask him to come here?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I could do that. Why?",
        "Rosanna: Well, because, you know, if we're driving back to Oakdale, we might get stopped by the police. And then they would put me in handcuffs, and they would take Cabot away from me right there on the street. I mean, that would be very bad.",
        "Carly: Okay. Here's what I'll do, honey. I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna find Jack. I'm gonna tell him privately where you are, and then we are gonna come back and we're gonna get you together. Okay?",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Thank you. What I said before, I'm sorry --",
        "Carly: It's forgotten, Rosanna. I just wish there was a way I could help you keep your son.",
        "Rosanna: You've been a wonderful sister. I'm always gonna remember that.",
        "Carly: Okay, I'll go. Bye, sweetheart. You be good to your momma, okay? I'll see you soon.",
        "[Cabot crying]",
        "Rosanna: See you. Hang on, sweetie.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Paul: Hello?",
        "Rosanna: Paul? It's Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much for coming. You're the only hope I have left.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: No, darling, your timing is absolutely perfect. My eyeballs are falling out. My memory is going to pieces. My fingers -- I'm playing internet bridge. I'm an addict.",
        "Clark: Wow. Internet Bridge. That must be really challenging.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm beating the machines. But never mind my small triumphs. Tell me all about your lovely young life, sweetheart.",
        "Lucy: Oh, we can't stay very long.",
        "Lucinda: No? Catching a movie?",
        "Lucy: Oh, just dinner. But Clark wanted to stop by and see you first.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, darling, don't tell me you want me to pick up the check?",
        "Clark: No ma'am.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. You've just got a soft spot for me, is that it?",
        "Clark: It's more like you're my good luck charm.",
        "Lucinda: Oh.",
        "Clark: Our first date was made right here. So --",
        "Lucinda: Wow. Well, I mean, I can't take any credit for that. I was just a bystander.",
        "Clark: Well, Lucy is about the best thing that's ever happened to me. So anybody who's been a part of that, I'd -- like to thank.",
        "Lucinda: Well, darling, you're very, very welcome. Now, here, you've got a guy who really appreciates you, Lucy. I hope he's taking you someplace nice.",
        "Clark: Oh, we're going to Metro. In fact, I need to check on the reservations. Can you excuse me?",
        "Lucinda: Well, use the phone here. Here.",
        "Clark: Oh, that's all right. I've got my own. Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Oh, well, how -- how quaint, a young man who doesn't mind expressing sentiment.",
        "Lucy: Does that mean you like him?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you sweet thing. You sweet thing, you sweet thing -- when you ask a question like that, you might get an honest answer.",
        "Lucy: I know.",
        "Lucinda: I think he is -- he's quaint and he's quite charming. But he knows that he's charming. I don't think he's right for you.",
        "Lucy: Why not?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I mean -- he's just -- he's too self-conscious now. He's doing the hair and all that. I just don't think he's right. No -- I want for you somebody much more --",
        "Lucy: Like Aaron?",
        "Lucinda: No. No, I wasn't going to say that. Although Aaron -- Aaron's charm is real. It is unforced.",
        "Lucy: You're right. Aaron's a great guy. But we don't belong together anymore.",
        "Lucinda: Oh.",
        "Lucy: It took me a while to realize that, but now that I have, I'm a lot happier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Aaron, I wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you stood by Alison, even though she --",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's not fun to be lied to.",
        "Susan: Making you think you were the father of that baby was --",
        "Aaron: Yeah --",
        "Susan: Horrible.",
        "Aaron: I know, but I think she -- she's sorry about it now.",
        "Susan: Well, she should be. You must have been disappointed when you found out the truth.",
        "Aaron: Disappointed? No, no. I think disappointed is when you go to the movies and it's -- and it's sold out. I got married, Susan. I got this apartment. You know? I was willing to take another job so your daughter wouldn't while she was pregnant. And it all just disappeared. You know, what I thought was important -- suddenly wasn't anymore. And I have nothing. I don't have anything to take its place.",
        "Susan: I am sorry that you had to go through that. And if it's any consolation, I think you handled it like a man.",
        "Aaron: I didn't think I had a choice.",
        "Susan: I wish that -- well, um -- would you tell Alison that I stopped by and that I would really like to see her.",
        "Aaron: Well, you know, I, I -- Susan, I know where they have their support meetings. If -- you know, if you want to go, I'll, you know --",
        "Susan: I'm game if you are.",
        "Aaron: All right. Yeah, let's go.",
        "Susan: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I lost my baby. I took a bad fall. I was all right after awhile, but my baby didn't make it. But what made everything worse was the baby's father was arrested for pushing me. He's still waiting to go to trial. I know that he thinks that I blame him. But mostly -- mostly I blame myself. I was so in love with him when I got pregnant. But I didn't believe that he wanted anything to do with me. And so I lied and -- I said that somebody else was the baby's father. I knew that that was a terrible thing to do. But I just can't imagine that he would want me -- and our baby -- to die. But even if he did, it's -- I realize now that maybe if -- if I just hadn't gotten everything off to such a bad start. Then maybe none of this would have even happened. If I had just told him the truth from the beginning. Then everything could have been different. And our baby would still be here.",
        "Jill: Thanks, Alison. Is there anything else you want to add? Thanks, everyone. I'll see you next time.",
        "Chris: I need to talk to you, Ali.",
        "Alison: I don't think so.",
        "Chris: No, don't shut me out. Okay? Look -- everything that I said the other day was true. Okay? I know that you think that I'm just trying to get you to drop the charges, but I'm not. Okay? I want to fix this, Alison. And I think that we can.",
        "Alison: How? How do you ever think that that's gonna happen?",
        "Emily: Just leave her alone, okay? She didn't come here to be with you, Chris.",
        "Chris: Look -- just hear me out one last time. Okay? Then you never have to talk to me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: There should be photos of my wife and Ms. Cabot on file. Pass them out to the state police, please? And try to explain the situation to them. Also, I want someone to check out every single gas station within 100 miles of this place. Convenience stores, too. I mean, that baby, she's gonna -- I'll -- I'll -- I'll call you -- I'll call you back. Are you okay?",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I didn't handle this the way you wanted me to.",
        "Jack: Do you ever? Where's Rosanna now?",
        "Carly: She's in a cabin in the woods, about an hour from here.",
        "Jack: Is she gonna keep on running?",
        "Carly: She wanted to. She wanted to take Cabot and leave the country. But I talked her into coming back.",
        "Jack: Then why didn't she come with you?",
        "Carly: She's afraid to leave the cabin. She doesn't want to be stopped by some cop she doesn't know. She wants me to bring you back, and we can all drive back together.",
        "Jack: The baby, too?",
        "Carly: It's going to kill her, Jack, but she'll give him up without a fight.",
        "Jack: All my training and experience, and you're the one who puts this to bed.",
        "Carly: Is that a compliment or are you just biding your time before you strangle me?",
        "Jack: If we'd had the time, I'd show you without words.",
        "Carly: We gotta go.",
        "Jack: Okay, yeah. I'll call them from the car.",
        "Craig: Jack, I called Rosanna's office -- where are Rosanna and Cabot?",
        "Jack: We're on our way now.",
        "Craig: I'll get my coat.",
        "Carly: Don't bother, Craig. There's no way I'm letting you anywhere near my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Listen, um -- I know that you know how to pilot a plane. And I need to get out of the country.",
        "Paul: I suppose a commercial airline is out of the question?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I can't have any record of where I've gone.",
        "Paul: You're taking a big chance. With a child involved, they're just gonna keep coming after you.",
        "Rosanna: I know. But it's my only option. I can't lose Cabot, that's all I know. I need your help. I can't do it alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Do you see a man who loves you? Because I swear, I do. With all my heart.",
        "Susan: That's him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: When I first met Aaron, I thought it was great that he was not like me. You know, he was different. It was exciting, but it obviously couldn't last.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, darling. And you think this -- with Clark? The two of you, you're more simpatico?",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah. I mean, it helps that we go to school together. We hang out with the same people, same classes, same teachers. And he's really into the college thing. So we have a lot in common.",
        "Lucinda: What about his heart? What about what really moves him. What about his enthusiasm? That's the best way to estimate a young man.",
        "Lucy: You know, Mom once told me I didn't have to fall in love with every guy I dated. I didn't really know what she meant at the time. But I think I do now.",
        "Lucinda: Bravo, bravo, Sierra. Good advice.",
        "Lucy: Besides, I just -- I just want to have fun my senior year, you know? Go out to parties with my friends and spend time with my new brother. Being with Aaron just -- I didn't really know if it was real, you know?",
        "Clark: Well, we're all set at the Metro.",
        "Lucy: Great. Yes. Okay.",
        "Lucinda: All right.",

        "Clark: That comes way too easy, Ms. Walsh. You don't have to remind me.",
        "Lucinda: Drive carefully.",

        "Craig: Carly, this is my wife and son. You can't keep me from my family.",
        "Carly: I'd like to know something, Craig. What does the word \"family\" really mean to you?",
        "Craig: Oh, come on, Carly!",
        "Carly: No, no, I'm curious. Because to most people, it's --it's very clear. Family is the people they love, the people they would do anything to protect.",
        "Craig: Do you have any doubt that I love Rosanna and Cabot?",
        "Carly: No. But the way you love them is so twisted, it would almost be better if you didn't love them at all.",
        "Craig: Well, look, I didn't intend for this to happen. But guess what? I can fix this, Carly.",
        "Carly: It's too late.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Carly: Rosanna has agreed to give up Cabot.",
        "Craig: She what?",
        "Carly: That's how brave she is. But that pain -- and the hurt that she's gonna carry around for the rest of her life -- that all comes from you. So here's the real question, Craig. Do you really want Rosanna to face you right now? Or do you recognize that maybe you've done enough damage already?",
        "Craig: All right, all right. All right, all right. I won't talk to Rosanna. But I want a few minutes with Cabot.",
        "Jack: It's gonna have to wait until he gets back.",
        "Craig: No, no, Jack -- he'll be in custody, Jack. I won't have a chance to say goodbye.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, Craig. But you're staying home this time.",
        "Craig: Well, hurry up. Jack? Jack? Will you call me when you get there? Let me know they're all right?",

        "Alison: I thought that they were straight, Chris. I said that I didn't blame you. What more do you want?",
        "Chris: Ali, you said you made mistakes. Okay? Well, I've made them, too. I was jealous and full of myself -- and all I did was drive you away when I really just wanted you to come back. Okay, but -- what I'm trying to say is we weren't out on that roof because of you. We were there because --",
        "Alison: I don't want to talk about it!",
        "Chris: Look, neither do I, Ali. Because thinking about that night, our baby -- what could have been is like, burning a hole in my chest. Okay? But I can't turn away from us. Not if we have a chance of moving on.",
        "Alison: You pushed me, Chris. I could've died along with my baby. That's not real easy to forget.",
        "Chris: Ali, are you saying that because you remember that? Or because you've been told that's what happened? Because I could never hurt you like that, Ali. Okay? It was icy out there. I was reaching for your hand. You slipped. I tried to catch you.",
        "Alison: That's what you say, but --",
        "Chris: Ali -- I've been blind and stupid. And I will admit that until I am blue in the face. But I could never hurt you like that. Don't you see it? I love you. Now, then -- it's never gonna stop.",

        "Molly: Oh, that's great. Nice to meet you. We'll just be a minute. Excuse us.",
        "Madison: I heard the rumors. But I didn't think they were true. You and princess Lucy? Not a pretty picture.",
        "Clark: Keep moving, Madison. I've got nothing to say to you.",
        "Madison: You never did. Did I ever mention how uninteresting you really are?",
        "Clark: Why don't you just get out of here, okay?",
        "Madison: I don't know, Clark. Maybe I'll stick around, tell Lucy everything I know about you.",
        "Lucy: What's going on?",
        "Molly: Your father's phone must be off. I've tried to get in touch with him all night. And I have heard nothing. Do you know where I might find him?",
        "Lucy: Is there a problem?",
        "Molly: No. I just really need to check in with him.",
        "Lucy: Well, why don't I try to reach him? What do you want me to say?",
        "Molly: Nothing. Never mind. As a matter of fact, I can just check with him in the morning. Its fine, no prob -- go back to your date. He's a cutie.",
        "Lucy: Molly, wait. You're hiding something. I want to know what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I wish that you wouldn't say that. I don't want to hear about how much you love me.",
        "Chris: Look, look -- you're saying that because you've been listening to your mother. Okay, Ali, she thinks that I want you to change your story just to get me off the hook. But I could never try and kill another human being, Ali. And you're right. If you don't know that by now, I am wasting my breath.",
        "Alison: You say one thing. And Aaron says something else. What am I supposed to believe is the truth?",
        "Chris: Think back to that night. Okay, now that you're calm and that you've had time to think. See my face. Hear my voice. I was so terrified that something would happen to you. Couldn't you see it in my eyes? Couldn't you see how desperate I was not to lose you?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I'm not sure.",
        "Chris: Ali, what do you see now? Do you see a man who loves you? Because I swear I do. With all my heart.",

        "Lucy: Is there anything I can do to help?",
        "Molly: As soon as you see him, tell him to call me. Why so tense?",
        "Lucy: I don't know -- I guess -- everything has just been so stable at home. Especially since Cabot arrived. When everyone's that happy, it's usually a sign that something bad's gonna happen.",
        "Molly: Are you here to have fun or worry about your family? See, that's what I thought. Now get back to your hunky guy.",
        "Lucy: Okay. But if something happens, you'll tell me, right?",
        "Molly: And ruin your night? What kind of friend do you take me for anyway, Lucy?",
        "Clark: Lucy won't believe anything you say to her. She'll just think you're jealous because I'm with her now instead of you.",
        "Madison: Right. Like my heart is breaking.",
        "Clark: Lucy and I are none of your business. So why don't you just take your attitude and get out of my face.",
