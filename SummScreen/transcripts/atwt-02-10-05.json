        "Carly: Hi, it's me.",
        "Lily: Yes, I just finished looking at the room reservations.",
        "Carly: Did Keith check into the Lakeview?",
        "Lily: Last night, and he's still up in his room. Are you keeping an eye on Julia?",
        "Carly: Like a hawk. It was a good idea for us to split up. And from the looks of things, she's on her way to meet Romeo right now.",
        "Lily: How do you know that?",
        "Carly: The outfit's tight, the hips are loose and the mouth has an inch of lipstick on it.",
        "Lily: Maybe she's on her way to work.",
        "Carly: Nursing is definitely not on the agenda, unless she's trying to give her patients coronaries. You just keep an eye on things at the Lakeview. And I'll keep you posted.",
        "Holden: Julia.",
        "Julia: Holden, hi.",
        "Holden: Wow, look at you. You always look amazing, but this morning you look really amazing.",
        "Julia: I do?",
        "Holden: Yeah. I thought you'd be at the hospital by now.",
        "Julia: I guess I didn't to tell you. My supervisor, he gave me the day off.",
        "Holden: Yeah?",
        "Julia: Yeah.",
        "Holden: Why's that?",
        "Julia: I just -- I have a million errands to run, you know?",
        "Holden: Must be some really important errands.",
        "Julia: Well, yeah. As a matter of fact, they are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Alison: Do you expect me to wear this?",
        "Aaron: Not for more than two minutes. Ali?",
        "Alison: Hmm?",
        "Aaron: These doctor's orders things? It has to stop.",
        "Alison: Mm. You're arm is getting stronger.",
        "Aaron: Oh, my arm is fine. [Alison laughs] I'm almost back to normal and all I can think about is touching you all over.",
        "Alison: I need you, too. More than you know. Oh, no, we can't do this. We can't do this.",
        "Aaron: Why not? Why, because of Rafi? I'll send Rafi home.",
        "Alison: No, I'm not worried about Rafael. I'm worried about you. Dr. Harris said that we still have weeks to go before it's safe to make love.",
        "Aaron: What does Dr. Harris know?",
        "Alison: He is a doctor!",
        "Aaron: Ali, the way I felt when he did that rule and the way I feel now, it's night and day. I am so cured.",
        "Alison: And maybe you are. But if Dr. Harris checks you out and says you're okay, than I will slip into this thing so fast, your head will spin. But you need to get his okay. I'm not going to let you risk your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I can't talk long. Jessica said that Paul's on his way.",
        "Rosanna: And you'll be able to keep him there long enough for me to do what I have to do?",
        "Barbara: I can handle my own children, Rosanna. Can you handle things on your end?",
        "Rosanna: I think so.",
        "Barbara: That's not good enough. You have to be sure.",
        "Rosanna: I am. Only, I wish it didn't have to be like this. Emily doesn't deserve this.",
        "Barbara: You know, that's completely irrelevant. No one deserves a fate from James Stenbeck, but he we are. You need Cabot. And I need my freedom so I can be with my children. So shall we dispense with the moral dilemmas and discuss procedure? Now, now you have the drug, but do you have enough?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Barbara: And you know exactly how much to put into the tea?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I do. And I'll mix in some honey like you said.",
        "Barbara: Good. Now, the most important thing is the hypnosis. You have to come up with a trigger word or a combination of words that will signal Emily's brain.",
        "Paul: She in here?",
        "Barbara: I have to go. Paul, you're here.",
        "Paul: Yeah, this had better not be about Rosanna.",
        "Barbara: No, it's not about Rosanna. It's about Emily. She actually came to me and told me that she's going to state under oath that she remembers me drugging her.",
        "Paul: Interesting.",
        "Barbara: But we both know she doesn't remember a thing. She's going to perjure herself and she doesn't even care. Don't you understand what this means, Paul?",
        "Paul: Enlighten me -- quickly.",
        "Barbara: In your determination to destroy me, you're letting the real villain go free. Free to hurt you and everyone else around you all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Phyllis: Emily Munson to see you, Mrs. Ryan.",
        "Rosanna: Um, yes, send her right in. Thank you, Phyllis.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, hello. I'm so glad you could come.",
        "Emily: Well, I think your idea to work together on Barbara's case was a good one.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, well, we're both going to have to testify, so I thought it would be important if we were on the same page. Anyway, it's very nice to have a friendly face for tea. There you go. Earl Grey?",
        "Emily: Oh, no, thanks. Really, after what Barbara did to me, I don't think I could ever touch a cup of tea again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: You know how it is when you move and you unpack and you realize that you have, like, a million things that you need.",
        "Holden: It's just I never pegged you as a woman who thought she wouldn't get the best deal unless she was dressed to kill.",
        "Julia: Well, hey, I'm not above a little lipstick and blush to knock 20% off. It's pretty girly of me, huh?",
        "Holden: Do I look like I mind?",
        "Luke: Dad?",
        "Holden: Hey, Luke. I didn't see you come in.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I got that.",
        "Julia: Hi, Luke.",
        "Holden: Aren't you going to say hi?",
        "Luke: I thought you and I were gonna have a talk.",
        "Holden: That's still the plan.",
        "Luke: Alone.",
        "Holden: Luke --",
        "Julia: It's okay. I -- I'm leaving anyway. I just came here to get a cup of coffee and I ran into your dad, that's all.",
        "Holden: We'll catch up later.",
        "Julia: Okay, yeah.",
        "Holden: I've been thinking about our talk the other day and I think that I owe you and your sisters an apology.",
        "Luke: For leaving us?",
        "Holden: You know that I didn't leave you guys.",
        "Luke: Oh, right. How you left Mom. But Faith, Nat and me, we still eat breakfast without you. Still do our homework without you. So, same difference.",
        "Holden: I wanted to apologize, because I didn't handle the situation -- separation very well, and I'm sorry for that.",
        "Luke: You're just not sorry you left.",
        "Holden: You remember the other day when you asked me why I stayed at the house so long, it's because you thought that there was still something between your mom and me.",
        "Luke: Well, there is. I know it.",
        "Holden: Well, I thought that, too. And that's why I stayed, because I thought that we could fix things. But we couldn't.",
        "Luke: Well, how do you know if you didn't really try?",
        "Holden: We did try. But it just got to the point where some things in our marriage were just not salvageable. And I didn't know how to tell you that. So, when I finally did leave the house, you were unprepared. And for that, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that things seemed so abrupt. I apologize. Can you forgive me for that?",
        "Luke: I guess. It's just that's not what bugs me the most.",
        "Holden: What is it then?",
        "Luke: Julia.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know you resent her. And I'm sorry about that, too.",
        "Luke: You are?",
        "Holden: My feelings for her, they developed pretty fast. I know that seems unfair to you and your sisters. But it's not something that I planned.",
        "Luke: So this thing with her, it's not like you and Mom? Holden no, it's different. And just because it happened fast doesn't mean that it's not real. Relationships, they can be very complicated.",
        "Luke: So what you're saying is, you're not giving Julia up?",
        "Holden: No, I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: The real villain will walk free? That's odd, because you've always maintained that Emily being drugged was just nonsense.",
        "Barbara: No, I've always maintained my innocence.",
        "Paul: But now you're saying that Emily was drugged, just not by you.",
        "Barbara: Emily is a very clever psychotic. She was very convincing yesterday when she insisted that she had been hypnotized.",
        "Paul: Of course she was convincing she was drugged. She was hypnotized to terrorize my wife. And you did it.",
        "Barbara: No, no! She made an assumption. It was just an assumption. That's all. She couldn't actually remember me doing such a cruel thing, because I didn't do it. And if she's going to lie just to put me away, it's not going to work, Paul.",
        "Paul: Why not? Lying's always worked for you.",
        "Barbara: So you admit it? So you admit that she's going to lie?",
        "Paul: Emily is going to save everyone from a long, drawn-out trial and more heartache.",
        "Barbara: Except that someone did manipulate her and now that someone is going to go free.",
        "Paul: I guess it's true what they say -- you live long enough you do see everything.",
        "Barbara: What are you talking about?",
        "Paul: I thought you'd run out of ways to twist the truth. I'm out of here.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, no. Paul, wait, wait, wait! Jess, Jess --",
        "Jessica: I'm here. What is it?",
        "Barbara: Paul just admitted to me that Emily is going to perjure herself when she testifies at my trial tomorrow. I want him arrested. Right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: No tea. Right. Um, I will just have Phyllis make you a lovely cup of coffee.",
        "Emily: No, Rosanna, really. I'm sort of getting off caffeine. Trying to get my system back to normal. That's fine. I'll just have Phyllis make you some decaf.",
        "Emily: No, I'm fine, really.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Um, I know I'm parched. And I know we have a lot of talking to do. So surely you'll join me for something. Um, iced tea? Lemonade?",
        "Emily: How about a glass of water?",
        "Rosanna: Water? Just water?",
        "Emily: That'd be great. Thanks.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, water it is.",
        "Emily: I get such an odd feeling visiting this place.",
        "Rosanna: Really? Why's that?",
        "Emily: I don't know. I guess the idea of me breaking into Fairwinds and doing all those horrible things to you. You're far more understanding than I would be, if I were you.",
        "Rosanna: Well --",
        "Emily: You know, when I think about it, I have to admit I have a very difficult time forgiving myself.",
        "Rosanna: I've had a lot of dealings with Barbara, Emily. So I know exactly how she uses people. She's the villain here, not you.",
        "Emily: Well, thank you for that. You know, honestly what helped me get over the guilt I felt from being used was your kindness.",
        "Rosanna: Wait, Emily -- I can't do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Rosanna, I'm sorry. Talking about all this must bring back really bad memories for you. I'm sorry, it must be so hard.",
        "Rosanna: No, I'm fine, really.",
        "Emily: No, no, I think it's harder than you're letting on. You probably keep a lot inside, don't you? That's probably why you passed out with Barbara the other night.",
        "Rosanna: No, I -- maybe. I think I probably passed out, because I was dehydrated, which you're going to be soon, if you don't drink that.",
        "Emily: Thanks. Mm. Wow, very lemony.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, it's not too much, is it? I --",
        "Emily: No, it's actually very good. I put lemon in my water, too.",
        "Rosanna: Oh?",
        "Emily: Daniel, on the other hand, hates it. I love it. It reminds me of a summer day.",
        "Rosanna: Huh.",
        "Emily: My poor Daniel. He has spent so much time away from his mother these past few months. [Emily sighs] I will be so relieved when this entire ordeal with Barbara is over.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, with any luck it will all be over with in no time.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Especially if we put our heads together about our testimony.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Why don't you go first? Tell me everything you remember about what happened.",
        "Emily: Okay. Well, the first thing I remember is Barbara kept offering the tea. It didn't seem like anything at first. I mean, it seemed a kind enough gesture -- really innocent, almost. Then I remember feeling sort of tired and listless. You know, like I had a cold or a flu or something. And Hal kept insisting that I see a doctor, but I felt like it was going to go away. And it didn't. I just felt more -- and more -- um -- was that Cabot's toy?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. It's one of the last things of his that I kept.",
        "Emily: Mm. It's lovely. Shiny --",
        "Rosanna: He loved it. And when I look at it, I remember how much I loved him.",
        "Emily: Poor Rosanna --",
        "Rosanna: I miss him so much. I would do anything to get my child back. Anything. Do you understand how I feel? Do you understand that I must have my child back?",
        "Emily: You must have your child back.",
        "Rosanna: And to get him back, you must do what I tell you to do.",
        "Emily: I will do what you tell me to do.",
        "Rosanna: Good. Then let's begin, shall we?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafael: What's with Aaron? He's been in a real foul mood ever since he got back.",
        "Alison: He doesn't like waiting.",
        "Rafael: For a delivery?",
        "Alison: What's this? Is this the letter that I helped you write to your family back in Montega?",
        "Rafael: Yeah, uh --",
        "Alison: So what's it doing all ripped up?",
        "Rafael: I told you I was going to translate it into Spanish. I didn't need to keep that version.",
        "Alison: Only you didn't translate it, did you? You didn't send them a letter at all?",
        "Rafael: No. No, I didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Dr. Harris, thank you so much for coming by.",
        "Ben: Hey, lucky for you, it's on my way to the hospital. What's wrong?",
        "Aaron: Well, nothing. Nothing and that's the problem. I feel great! But Ali -- Ali, she still thinks that it's what you said before. That it's not a very good idea --",
        "Ben: What? About not having sex because of the surgery?",
        "Aaron: Yes, yes. Did you bring my latest test results?",
        "Ben: Well, I took a look at your MRI. It's great. Healing in the area of the lesion is nearly complete. Recovery is way ahead of schedule.",
        "Aaron: That's perfect. Then, I'm good to go, right?",
        "Ben: Well, you need to have a physical exam first before I can clear you for any strenuous activity. But I'll set it up. Get you into the hospital tomorrow.",
        "Aaron: Tomorrow? Tomorrow? Um, no, can we do it right now? Can we do it right now? I'm gonna explode if I wait any longer, Dr. Harris. Please, you have a bag. What's in the bag?",
        "Ben: There are no monitors in the bag. You've held out for this long, Aaron. I'm pretty sure you can hold out for one more day. Right? All right, all right, all right. Look, I've got a little bit of time right now. If you can go to the hospital right now --",
        "Aaron: Right now.",
        "Ben: -- We can take care of you.",
        "Aaron: Right now. Let's go in the car. Let's go, let's go. Guys, I'll be back in a few, okay?",
        "Alison: Where are you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I am committed to my relationship with Julia. I know that's not what you want to hear, but it's the truth.",
        "Luke: But what about mom?",
        "Holden: Because of you kids, I will always be very deeply connected to your mother.",
        "Luke: Right, but not connected enough to give her another chance?",
        "Holden: It's about more than just giving each other chances. Your mom, we have been through a lot. We've been married for a very long time. And I just think that maybe you're a little too young to understand --",
        "Luke: I understand more than you think. I just don't get why you and mom never went to counseling. Well, did you?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Luke: Well, then isn't that what couples are supposed to do? Isn't that -- isn't that what families do?",
        "Holden: Sometimes.",
        "Luke: Well, then why can't we?",
        "Holden: I don't know. I guess I thought that I had done everything that I could. Maybe you're right. Maybe we should go to counseling.",
        "Luke: You mean that?",
        "Holden: But getting counseling doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to walk away from Julia and go back to your mother. Getting counseling means that we all need to sit down and talk openly about things and learn how to move on.",
        "Luke: And give each other second chances, right?",
        "Holden: Yes, give each other second chances. And you need to give Julia a second chance. No more cold shoulder. We all need to try to be a little more understanding from now on.",
        "Luke: Including you?",
        "Holden: Of course.",
        "Luke: I just think that if you were with Mom a little more and you got to know her like it was just beginning, then maybe you'll love her all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Desk clerk: Yes, sir. Ms. Larrabee is here to see you? Very well, I'll send her right up. Room 1214.",
        "Julia: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Hey. So, where is she now?",
        "Lily: She's on her way upstairs.",
        "Carly: Well, how are we going to find out what's going on?",
        "Lily: I have the room number and the service elevator is waiting. Come on.",
        "Keith: Good morning.",
        "Julia: Hi.",
        "Keith: You look good.",
        "Julia: Really? Thanks, I didn't sleep much. I was thinking about you all night.",
        "Keith: Come in.",
        "Lily: I can't believe -- did I hear -- did I hear that right? He really going to -- is she gonna --?",
        "Carly: You saw that outfit. She ain't handing out bibles.",
        "Lily: But she's supposed to be crazy about Holden. She's gonna sleep with this guy now?",
        "Carly: \"Oh, Keith, I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about you all night.\" What do you think little miss hot pants meant by that?",
        "Lily: I'm calling Holden.",
        "Carly: Wait. Are you sure that you want to be the one to tell him? You know, it seems like it's always the messenger that gets killed.",
        "Lily: What difference does it make? I'm dying anyway. She's gonna break his heart, Carly. And then everybody that I love will be destroyed.",
        "Carly: Go for it.",
        "Lily: Holden?",
        "Holden: Lily, hi.",
        "Lily: I know I shouldn't be calling you, but I really need to talk to you about something. Could you come to the Lakeview?",
        "Holden: Can I meet up with you later?",
        "Lily: Well, can't we do it now?",
        "Holden: Okay. I'm on my way. That was your mom. I'm gonna head over to the Lakeview to see her.",
        "Luke: Well, will you talk to her about the counseling thing?",
        "Holden: Maybe, maybe. We'll see.",
        "Lily: He's on his way.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Rosanna: I spiked your tea. I hypnotized you.",
        "Emily: It was you.",
        "Lily: Room 1214.",
        "Holden: What is this?",
        "Lily: It's where Julia is.",
        "Julia: I need your help, Keith. And I know you're gonna help me.",
        "Keith: How are you so sure?",
        "Julia: Because you love and you would do anything for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafael: I'm just not ready. You know, to tell my mom and my sister and everybody back home that this boxing thing was a bust, you know?",
        "Alison: Well, the longer that you hold off telling them, the harder it's going to get. Believe me, I know.",
        "Rafael: It's not just about pride. They were counting on me to send money back home. To help them out, to help bring them here.",
        "Alison: Well, don't you see that I.N.S. guy today?",
        "Rafael: Yeah. He's coming by to sign off on Aaron sponsoring me.",
        "Alison: And after that you'll find out whether or not you can stay in the country for sure.",
        "Rafael: And then I can tell my family what happened, is that what you're saying?",
        "Alison: Well, it would be a good start.",
        "Rafael: You think I'm a coward, don't you?",
        "Alison: No. I think that you should do what feels right for you. I sure don't think that you have anything to be ashamed of. I hope you know that.",
        "Rafael: I'm gonna go bring me more boxes up.",
        "Alison: Where did you disappear to?",
        "Aaron: Did you miss me?",
        "Alison: Always.",
        "Aaron: Well, maybe you'd like to tell me how much you missed me?",
        "Alison: Oh, Aaron -- unless Ben Harris walks through that door to tell me that he's signed off on us doing it, you need to quit, okay?",
        "Ben: Sorry, my pager went haywire here. What?",
        "Aaron: Tell her, doc.",
        "Ben: Aaron has had an amazing and complete recovery.",
        "Alison: You mean we can --",
