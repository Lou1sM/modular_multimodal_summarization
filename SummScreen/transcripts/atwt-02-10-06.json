        "When Carly insists that Jack go into work that night, he wants to know what she is hiding? Carly covers by saying she doesn't want him losing another job because of her. After Jack leaves, Carly goes into \u0091work', where Nick is anxiously awaiting her. She needs to leave soon after though, because the babysitter's child is sick. Nick gives Carly a ride home when her car won't start. He accompanies Carly to her front door and is in the process of slowly wiping her lipstick off so Jack won't see it, when Jack opens the door demanding to know what is going on? Margo comes face to face with Paul in his motel room, when searching for Will and Gwen, but he is disguised as a French man. He continues to fight his respiratory infection, which Margo picks up on. Casey attempts to apologize to Maddie, but his attempts cause another argument with her. He is curious as to why she has so much food? She covers by saying she is bringing it to Nate, but when Nate shows up he is obviously oblivious to his supposed date with Maddie, and she is forced to lie again. Maddie brings Gwen and Will their food at the Metro and then figures out a plan to keep Margo off their heels. Maddie later meets up with Margo and tells her that she was on the rooftop and found takeout food boxes and a bus ticket with departure times circled. Casey is confused as to why she would be helping his mom find Will and Gwen when she was defending them to him earlier? Mike tells Katie they have to postpone their April wedding. He has to go help his brother on an architectural project that fell through, but it has the potential to make them a lot of money. Katie agrees to let him leave for three weeks, but fights her feelings of superstition, when Mike knocks over and breaks a wedding object. Jen is tortured about Paul's death and contemplates getting in touch with the psychic who had told her that her grief for Paul is misguided. She hides her feelings about this subject from Dusty, and later secretly makes plans to meet up with this woman, who we see is working for Paul."

        "Jack: Kim's not gonna fire me for missing one day. I got someone to cover for me.",
        "Carly: Jack, you have to go into work tonight.",
        "Jack: I'd rather stay home and take care of you. You're upset enough already about Gwen, and Barbara just made things worse. Honey, we have pulled in so many different directions. We really haven't had time to just be together.",
        "Carly: Yes, I know. And we will find that time, I promise. It's just that things are so tight right now, Jack. We can't afford to miss even one paycheck.",
        "Jack: Maybe. But that isn't what this really is about, is it?",
        "Carly: What? What else would it be about?",
        "Jack: Why don't you tell me why you really don't want me staying home tonight?",
        "Carly: Okay. Okay, I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Butch: Hey! See you're back for more, eh?",
        "Nick: Yeah. Just waiting for the game to get started. I was hoping that little blond waitress is gonna be working tonight.",
        "Butch: Tiffany? I thought she reminded you of some ex-girlfriend you wanted to forget?",
        "Nick: You know, I'm not gonna hold that against her. Listen, she gave me good luck last night, you know?",
        "Butch: Hey, don't worry about it. She's on her way.",
        "Nick: Hey, are those same guys gonna be in the game tonight?",
        "Butch: I don't know. Maybe. Does it matter?",
        "Nick: Well, I mean, they gave a run for my money. Especially that guy in the middle. What was his name?",
        "Butch: If they didn't tell you, it's probably 'cause he didn't want you to know. Come on.",
        "Chardonnay: Don't worry. She'll show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, lunch is ready.",
        "Will: There's still no sign of Maddie. Do you think maybe she got into trouble? It shouldn't take this long to get muffins and coffee.",
        "Gwen: I'm sure she's fine, but I'm starving, so I can't wait. Besides, pretzels with mustard and stuffed olives are some of my all-time favorite snacks.",
        "Will: Yeah, but maybe Casey found out something.",
        "Gwen: Relax. Have an olive.",
        "Will: How can you be so calm?",
        "Gwen: I don't know, but for some crazy reason, I'm happy. I've decided I'm not gonna let myself worry about what could happen.",
        "Will: Gwen, we're on the run. My mother's gonna try and pin her accident on you. If Casey finds out that Maddie's trying to help us, and he tells his mother, then --",
        "Gwen: We're still together. Nobody's split us up yet. Just stop worrying and kiss me like you mean it, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What is the food for, Maddie? You're not gonna eat all that.",
        "Maddie: No? Nate's going to help me, and I don't -- whatever you have to say, I don't care.",
        "Casey: What if it's I'm sorry?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, like those two words would ever come out of your mouth.",
        "Casey: They just did, all right? I was a jerk, and I really am sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Wedding planner: Beautiful. I can build a whole wedding around that dress.",
        "Mike: What dress?",
        "Katie: Ooh. Hey! You're not supposed to see the dress before the wedding.",
        "Mike: It's just a picture. It doesn't count.",
        "Katie: Well, I don't want to take any chances. Nothing -- and I mean nothing is gonna jinx this wedding for us.",
        "Mike: Okay.",
        "Katie: So we'll move on to the invitations. Mike can help us with that. I really love this one. I want to go simple, you know? Something like this, but grey or ivory.",
        "Mike: You might want to hold off on the wedding invitations for now.",
        "Katie: Honey, we can't. If we want to get married in April, we have to give everybody ample notice. We're still planning on getting married in April, aren't we?",
        "Mike: Not anymore.",

        "Jennifer: Can I get you something, Ms. --",
        "Lacoste: Lacoste. Oh, and please, call me Mina. And a glass of water would be very nice. Um -- I need to know what you meant when you said that my grief for my brother Paul was misguided. I mean, did you know him?",
        "Lacoste: No, I'm afraid not.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, well, I've never met you before, so I'm just having a hard time understanding where all this is coming from.",
        "Lacoste: Well, like I said, I sometimes see things.",
        "Jennifer: You mean like visions?",
        "Lacoste: Well, for want of a better word, yes.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. Look, I -- I don't mean any offense, but I personally don't believe in psychics.",
        "Lacoste: Well, I'm not asking you to believe anything. It's just that when I meet people, I sometimes get these feelings. And often, they -- they end up being true.",
        "Jennifer: And with me, you have the feeling that I have been misguided?",
        "Lacoste: I get the sense that you're still in a great deal of pain and conflict. You need to make peace with your brother.",
        "Jennifer: My brother Paul, who's dead?",
        "Lacoste: Yes.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm afraid it's a little late for that.",
        "Lacoste: No, my dear, it's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I wish I could see you, Jennifer, tell you I was alive. But it's still too soon. Not yet, not until --",

        "Margo: Oakdale PD. Open the door.",

        "Margo: Oakdale PD. Open the door now.",
        "Manager: I'm sure any of the other guests can give you the information that you want. Mr. Pollock left explicit instructions not to be disturbed.",
        "Margo: Oh, wow. Well, that's too bad, because I really need to talk to him. So either you open the door now, or I will arrest you and Mr. Pollock for obstruction of justice. Gonna open the door now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Look, you can't make peace with someone who's dead, except in your own heart, which is what I'm still trying to do.",
        "Lacoste: You don't understand.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Dusty: Hey. You think Johnny will dig this or what? I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company.",
        "Lacoste: Well, it's all right. I need to be going. Maybe we can continue our conversation at another time.",
        "Jennifer: Um, yeah. Honey, why don't you take that in to Johnny while I say good-bye to Ms. Lacoste?",
        "Dusty: Sure.",
        "Jennifer: Look, if you know something about what happened to my brother Paul, please tell me.",
        "Lacoste: Now is not the time. Here, take this. It's my card. Please, call me. We can maybe arrange a time when we can speak more comfortably and in depth--",
        "Jennifer: \"Madame Lacoste\"? You're a psychic, a professional? Why didn't you tell me that to begin with?",
        "Lacoste: I didn't want to scare you off before you could hear me out.",
        "Jennifer: This is just -- this is ridiculous. I don't have time for this. Please, just go.",
        "Lacoste: I can help you if you will let me. If you change your mind, please call.",
        "Jennifer: Good-bye, Ms. Lacoste.",
        "[Jennifer sighs]",
        "Dusty: I think he really digs it. I'm such a sucker for a smile, I'll do anything. How are you?",
        "Jennifer: Fine. Um, fine. Did you see my mom when you went to get Johnny? Was she back there?",
        "Dusty: No. She's asleep. Are you sure you're fine? It looks like that lady upset you.",
        "Jennifer: No. No, no. Um, she saw the broadcast, and then she thought she had some information about Gwen and Will, but it turned out to be a dead end.",
        "Dusty: Is there any reason you don't want to tell me the truth?",
        "Jennifer: Why do you think I'm not telling you the truth?",
        "Dusty: Jenny, what's going on?",
        "Jennifer: Nothing. It's nothing. It's -- it's nothing for you to worry about. There were just some things that I can't talk to you about right now.",
        "Dusty: Its okay, it's okay. I thought we didn't keep secrets from one another.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not keeping secrets. I just -- I just think that this is a conversation that you don't want to be having.",
        "Dusty: A conversation about what?",
        "Jennifer: Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: The truth is, Jack, I don't want to be responsible for you losing another job. I feel bad enough about getting you into trouble with Hal.",
        "Jack: I told you, I already cleared it with Kim. And you're not the reason I got suspended. I made a choice to protect you, and now I'm paying the price. You've got to stop feeling guilty about that.",
        "Carly: I'm trying.",
        "Jack: Try harder. Honey, you've got enough on your mind right now, like your sister. At least if I stay home tonight, I can keep you from flying off the handle with some crazy plan to get her off the hook.",
        "Carly: Oh, I see. Oh, this is about you baby-sitting me, right? Because you have no faith in me whatsoever, do you, Jack?",
        "Jack: Carly, I love you to death. You know that. You get into trouble when there's a crisis. You're like Lucy Ricardo on the edge.",
        "Carly: It's not as if I go looking for that trouble.",
        "Jack: I know that, honey, and I know you've been making a big effort, especially where Nick Kasnoff is concerned. You've worked hard not to --",
        "Carly: Knock his block off?",
        "Jack: Exactly.",
        "Carly: Especially because he deserves it. And you deserve your job back.",
        "Jack: That'll happen. Just -- your concern about your sister is what worries me. I'm not sure you can show the same restraint.",
        "Carly: Why don't you give me a chance to prove to you that you can trust me? Go to work, and when you come home, I will have a nice, romantic dinner waiting for you. Maybe I'll even put on that skimpy little number I bought for the bedroom.",
        "Jack: Okay, you win. Well, it looks like I'm going in tonight.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Be good.",
        "Carly: I will, I promise. Hi, it's Carly. Um, can you still watch the kids tonight? Right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, you're still worried about something.",
        "Will: I'm just -- I'm just wondering if we're ever gonna get to the point where we can be out in the open, you know, not running, not hiding, just normal.",
        "Gwen: You know, after everything we've been through, normal might be a pretty big letdown.",
        "Will: Yeah, but couldn't we just experience it for once, just to know for sure? And I'm also not completely positive that Maddie's our best connection to the outside world.",
        "Gwen: You know what? I trust her. And it's only till we know our next move. And if she's willing to help, we can't be very picky.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Clank]",
        "Maddie: My ears are ringing. Are you actually apologizing to me?",
        "Casey: I shouldn't have made it sound like Nate would never show an interest in a girl like you.",
        "Maddie: So now you're saying that he could show an interest in a girl like me?",
        "Casey: No, I'm saying that he'd be an idiot not to be.",
        "Maddie: Where is this coming from, and why now?",
        "Casey: I'm just trying to be nice, that's all. I mean, is that so hard to comprehend?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. As a matter of fact, it is.",
        "Casey: How is it that you can take even an apology and make it seem like an insult?",
        "Maddie: Oh, so now I'm the one that's messing this up?",
        "Casey: Yeah. As a matter of fact, you are.",
        "Maddie: Well, maybe I don't think your apology is sincere enough. Maybe you're just -- you're just trying to get on my good side.",
        "Casey: Why?",
        "Maddie: Why do you think?",
        "Casey: I don't know, and that's why I'm asking.",
        "Maddie: You know what? It would have been a lot easier if you just kept being a jerk.",
        "Casey: You know what? I'm done, all right? Good luck with your date.",
        "Nate: What date? Hey, Maddie. What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, now that it's just the two of us, what's going on? Why can't we count on getting married in April?",
        "Mike: Well, the thing of it is, I got a call --",
        "Katie: Oh, no, don't tell me. It's Jennifer.",
        "Mike: Jennifer?",
        "Katie: You've hit a snag in the divorce, and you're worried that it's not gonna be finalized in time for an April wedding.",
        "Mike: No, no, no, no. It's nothing like that.",
        "Katie: Then what, B.J.? Did he contact you? Did he threaten you?",
        "Mike: Stop. Listen to me, okay? I've got to leave town right away.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I did not mean to spring it on you like this. And believe me, I don't want to put off our wedding any more than you do.",
        "Katie: Then why do we have to? Where do you have to go in such a hurry?",
        "Mike: Well, I got a call from my brother.",
        "Katie: Mark?",
        "Mike: Yeah. He's got a big development project in Latvia, and he's having some problems with some of the architects, and he needs me to come and consult. But I need to leave right away.",
        "Katie: Honey, it's kind of out in the blue.",
        "Mike: I know, I know. I told him I wanted to check with you first, but he needed an answer on the spot.",
        "Katie: And you told him you'd do it?",
        "Mike: Look, it's just a few weeks, you know? And I haven't seen him in a long time.",
        "Katie: I know. I know it would be good for you to reconnect with your brother. It's just --",
        "Mike: It's terrible timing, I know.",
        "Katie: Yeah. And can't you reconnect over the phone for now?",
        "Mike: It's not just about reconnecting with my brother. I mean, this is a huge job and a chance to make a lot of money. I mean, with the wedding coming up, every buck counts, right?",
        "Katie: If there even is a wedding still.",
        "Mike: Hey, hey, hey. There's gonna be a wedding. There's no way in the world there's not gonna be a wedding, okay? We just have to put it off for a little bit. But now, we get to have it in style, okay?",
        "Katie: I don't care if we get married in burlap as long as it happens.",
        "Mike: It's going to happen, I promise you. You serious about getting married in burlap? Because --",
        "Katie: Oh, shut up. You know I'm not serious about that. I want lavish.",
        "Mike: And that's what you're gonna have, okay? Lavish, extravagant, over the moon.",
        "Katie: Okay, I believe you. And if you need this time to spend with your brother, who am I to stand in your way?",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Is it cold in Latvia this time of year?",
        "Mike: I imagine. Why?",
        "Katie: 'Cause I got to figure out what to pack. And when do we leave?",
        "Mike: We?",
        "Katie: You didn't think I was gonna let you go alone, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I thought you said you were meeting him, Maddie? What gives?",
        "Nate: Yeah, what gives?",
        "Maddie: Well, I -- thanks a lot, Casey. Thanks for blowing my surprise.",
        "Nate: What surprise?",
        "Maddie: I was bringing you this mini-picnic.",
        "Nate: Really?",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nate: You know, I didn't think that you wanted us to hang out anymore.",
        "Maddie: I never said that.",
        "Nate: Well, you didn't have to.",
        "Maddie: I don't know what you're talking about. You must have the wrong idea.",
        "Nate: You know, you're a really hard girl to figure out.",
        "Casey: Yeah, tell me about it. Enjoy your muffins.",
        "Nate: You know, I'm glad we cleared this up. I was really kind of bummed. These look great.",
        "Maddie: Stop it. They're not for you.",
        "Nate: What, you just said that --",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I know what I said. I was improvising, okay? I have to go.",

        "Maddie: No, you can't. Uh, here, take this one. Now, go home and wait for my call.",
        "Nate: You know, I really think all that calculus really got to your brain.",
        "Maddie: No, trust me, I am saner than ever. It's just -- I'll tell you another day, and I'll explain. I promise I will. Just for now, please go, okay?",

        "Gwen: Hey, nobody's comin'.",
        "Will: We didn't imagine that noise.",
        "Gwen: But maybe it came from next door.",
        "Will: It didn't come from next door. It came from right outside. I'm gonna go find out what it was.",
        "Maddie: Whoa! It's just me.",
        "Will: I thought you weren't coming back.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, sorry. I got caught up.",

        "Maddie: No, no, no, no. Here.",
        "Will: There's probably an award out for us.",
        "Maddie: You think I'd turn you in for cash.",
        "Gwen: Hey, he's just antsy. He didn't mean anything by it.",
        "Will: Maybe I just -- I don't think we're really safe here anymore, so maybe it'd be a good idea to start moving out.",
        "Maddie: Oh, after all the trouble I went to try to get you food and making sure nobody followed me? Sure, go ahead. Go out in the open. Go ahead, run. That would definitely be safer.",
        "Will: Do you have a better idea?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.",

        "Nick: What's the matter, trouble with Jack?",
        "Carly: Put a lid on it. I'm really not in the mood, Nick.",
        "Nick: What, did Jack all of the sudden get suspicious about where you were headed?",
        "Carly: Everything is just fine. You are the one who almost blew it for me today. What was the big idea bringing my bracelet to the house?",
        "Nick: So Jack might get suspicious. Once he found out you misplaced it -- I was trying to help you out.",
        "Carly: Oh, give me a break. You came over because you knew it would get under Jack's skin to see you in our house.",
        "Nick: You think I've got nothing better to do than to play mind games with your husband? I saved your butt, Carly. Admit it.",
        "Carly: Well, next time, butt out.",
        "Chardonnay: You made it.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, barely.",

        "Chardonnay: Don't let that one get away, sweetie. He's hot.",
        "Carly: Hi. Hi, Mrs. Lebo. Is everything okay with the kids? Oh, that's terrible. Does your son have a fever? Oh. Oh, well I really can't come home right away, because I don't have any way to watch the kids. No, don't. Please don't call Jack, all right? Just sit tight, I'll get there as soon as I can.",
        "Carly: Hey, I've got to go.",
        "Chardonnay: But, you just got here.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know. But it's an emergency. I need you to cover for me with Butch.",
        "Chardonnay: But you're already in hot water with him.",
        "Carly: Please.",
        "Chardonnay: All right. I'll see what I can do. No promises. Will you be back?",

        "Dusty: Whatever problems I had with your brother, he was your brother and you love him. I know that.",
        "Jennifer: It's just -- all this stuff with Will has just got me scared. I don't want to lose the only other brother that I have left. And I guess that fear is bringing up all the guilty feelings about Paul.",
