        "Jack: Hit me again.",
        "Janet: Honey, maybe you should go back to the farm and take a nap instead?",
        "Jack: No, what I need to do is go to the station, see what I can do to help.",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, if Meg's baby is somewhere in New York, what can you do from here?",
        "Jack: Not a damn thing.",
        "Janet: And if you fall asleep in the middle of Sage's play, she is going to be so mad at you.",
        "Jack: No, no, no. That is not going to happen, because you're going to be sitting next to me to nudge me if I doze off.",
        "Janet: I'm not going.",
        "Jack: Janet.",
        "Janet: Jack, we talked about this. This is Sage's big day. And to have her mother there and her stepmother, at the same time -- it could be kind of tricky.",
        "Jack: It doesn't have to be.",
        "Janet: It is for a girl her age. She and I are just now starting to get along, I don't want to mess that up.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but you said it yourself, you're her stepmother. You have every right to be there.",
        "Janet: It's not about rights, Baby. This is about making Sage happy. And you know damn well Carly doesn't want me to be there.",
        "Jack: You don't know that.",
        "Janet: Where's my ticket?",
        "Jack: Uh -- ticket?",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Jack: I was supposed to get some tickets too. No, she was supposed to drop them off this morning.",
        "Carly: Hey, hi. I'm so sorry I'm late dropping these off. I had sort of a busy morning.",
        "Jack: Yes, two tickets.",
        "Carly: Yes, well, you're both going, right?",
        "Janet: I don't know.",
        "Carly: No, you have to. No, Sage is so afraid that there won't be enough people there who believe in fairies that will clap to save her life.",
        "Jack: See?",
        "Janet: We'll both be there.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Carly: Good. Thank you.",
        "Jack: So Sage is worried about today?",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, she goes back and forth. But I finished her costume last night, and she was so sweet dancing around the living room with her wand. I'm going to have to bring so many tissues because I'm just going to embarrass the poor girl.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Excuse me.",
        "Jack: You have to take that?",

        "Dusty: The cops have nothing new.",
        "Meg: Well, what did they say when you told them about fingerprints in the rental car? I mean, they must have some kind of trace --",
        "Dusty: They haven't found anything yet.",
        "Meg: Why is he keeping her? I mean, if he just wanted the stolen car, why didn't he drop the baby off at a hospital or a church, or --",
        "Josie: Maybe he will. Once he realizes that the police are after him. What?",
        "Meg: He doesn't want me thinking about that. He might get too scared if the police get too close. Then he might want to get rid of her.",
        "Josie: How's Barbara?",
        "Paul: She's resting. All of this is a little bit much for her. Anything?",
        "Dusty: The cops are working on it.",
        "Paul: So, what, you're saying they still don't have a clue?",
        "Josie: Well, if that's the case, then maybe -- maybe you should try.",
        "Paul: Josie, don't.",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about?",
        "Josie: We need to find Eliza. And since the normal methods aren't working, maybe Paul needs to look inside instead of outside. It's worked before.",
        "Paul: Don't you think that I've been praying for something like that to happen? I've been doing everything I can to bring one of these visions on. It's just not happening.",
        "Josie: Why not?",
        "Dusty: Because it's stupid, and it's a waste of time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Carly. I've been trying to reach you all day.",
        "Carly: And I've been ignoring you. Do you wonder why?",
        "Craig: If we're going to be business partners, you have to talk to me.",
        "Carly: I'm really happy about this whole vodka thing -- I'm really, really glad that you came up with the idea --",
        "Craig: We came up with the idea.",
        "Carly: But I have to go home, all right? I have a lot of things to do.",
        "Craig: And I have a distributor for our vodka.",
        "Carly: Already? How did you manage that?",
        "Craig: Well, it's not a done deal. We have to meet with the guy and do our pitch. But he's interested, and I got us an appointment.",
        "Carly: Well, that's incredible! I mean, if this actually happens, if this actually works --",
        "Craig: We only have one shot at this guy, so, we have to make this count.",
        "Carly: What's his name?",
        "Craig: Aristotle Theophilus.",
        "Carly: That's a mouthful.",
        "Craig: He owns his own global distribution network for fine wines and liquors.",
        "Carly: Global? We could go global!",
        "Craig: So, what you need to do is go home, change into something professional, yet provocative, grab your portfolio and I'll pick you up in half an hour.",
        "Carly: Wait. A half an hour?",
        "Craig: Yes, we have to go to Chicago this afternoon and meet with him.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Craig, I'm sorry, I can't. I can't do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We need to find the baby. We don't need Paul's hocus-pocus to pull us off track.",
        "Josie: But he's done it before. When we were looking for Johnny. He had that vision of Johnny's lion --",
        "Dusty: That was nothing. I would have ended up on a safari.",
        "Josie: It was a clue, any clue is better than nothing, right?",
        "Dusty: Not if it doesn't lead you anywhere. Please, drop it.",
        "Josie: Sorry.",
        "Meg: Do it.",
        "Paul: Meg, I've tried.",
        "Meg: You've seen things. With Parker, with me. Things that were true. You even saw things with Johnny.",
        "Paul: But you can't just conjure something like that up. The visions either come or they don't.",
        "Meg: They come when it's with people you care about. And you don't love anyone more than you love our little girl. Please try. I don't care how weird it is. Please, you have to try.",
        "Paul: What if Dusty's right? What if it just makes thing worse? What if it leads us to the wrong place?",
        "Meg: Anything is better than doing nothing! Please. What did you see?",
        "Paul: Nothing. This isn't going to work. As much as I want it to work, it's not going to work.",
        "Meg: No, no, no. You need more time.",
        "Paul: Look, all I can think about is watching that car pull off, with her in it.",
        "Meg: Look, all that matters is that we find her, okay? Here, close your eyes. Close your eyes. It's her bedtime. And you're sitting in her rocker in her nursery. The lights are dimmed, and her mobile is on, and you can see shadows of the moon and the stars twinkle around in the room. You're holding our sweet little girl, and she's all snuggled up in her nightie. And she's holding your hand, and watching you, smiling at you. Because she knows you're her daddy, and you'll keep her safe.",
        "Paul: I didn't keep her safe.",
        "Dusty: This isn't working.",
        "Meg: You can save her now, Paul. Please try.",
        "[Dog howling]",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: I can hear an animal. An animal howl.",
        "Josie: What kind of animal?",
        "Paul: A wolf. Maybe it's a wolf. I don't know.",
        "Dusty: First a lion, now a wolf? This is a joke.",
        "Meg: Was it a real animal? Like in a zoo?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Meg: Why don't you try again?",
        "[Dog howling]",
        "Paul: It's a dog. It's a dog. Pulling a sled, maybe. And children are laughing. I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: Can you help us?",
        "Dusty: Let's see what we can find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, I thought you were serious about providing for your family.",
        "Carly: I do provide for my family. And that takes more than money. Sage is performing is her school's production of \"Peter Pan\" today.",
        "Craig: Fine, what time?",
        "Carly: There's not enough time to go to Chicago and come all the way back. We're going to have to change the appointment.",
        "Craig: No, I can't. He's leaving for Europe tomorrow. He won't be back for a month. I was lucky to get him to squeeze us in.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry that I can't do it, my kids come first. And what about Johnny? You bored of fatherhood already?",
        "Craig: Not at all, what I did was get him a terrific nanny so I can actually do business and provide for him at the same time.",
        "Carly: Well, a nanny can't take the place of Mommy when you're playing Tinkerbell.",
        "Craig: Would you please just tell me what time this show is at?",
        "Carly: It's late this afternoon.",
        "Craig: Well, that's plenty of time.",
        "Carly: Well, Craig, there's more to it than just sitting there in the audience. I have to pick Sage up from school, I have to get her in a costume and do her make up and then bring her back to school in time for the performance.",
        "Craig: Maybe you should get a nanny. What if we get someone else to pick her up and get her back to school? That buys us two extra hours. That's plenty of time for you to get back and see her glide across the stage in all the glory.",
        "Carly: She's really looking forward to this.",
        "Craig: And you will not miss one precious moment of her theatrical triumph. And if we make a deal with this guy, you'll have even more to celebrate. Do you feel that?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Craig: This is it, Carly. The chance of a lifetime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What are you looking at? Oh, you've got to be kidding me.",
        "Jack: I'm an observer. I observe. I'm observant.",
        "Janet: Every time you observe Craig and Carly, your head spins around and smoke comes out of your ears.",
        "Jack: Do I look upset to you?",
        "Janet: You look nosy to me.",
        "Jack: Hey, listen, I knew that was him calling her before. Do you think I let that bother me?",
        "Janet: If it didn't bother you, you wouldn't be looking. Come on now, help me with the salt and pepper shakers. I got to get out of there in time for Sage's play.",
        "Jack: Sage's play doesn't start for like five hours.",
        "Janet: I know. But I have to look perfect. I got to home, I got to shower, I got to change, I got to do the hair and make up.",
        "Jack: And what will we do for the other four hours?",
        "Janet: Seriously, Jack! This is the first time I've been to a function at Sage's school. Kids that age are very sensitive. I don't want to mess things up.",
        "Jack: Honey, Honey, look at me. You're beautiful. And everyone adores you.",
        "Janet: Everyone except your daughter.",
        "Jack: Come on.",
        "Janet: And that's okay. It's doesn't matter.",
        "Jack: Sounds like it does.",
        "Janet: Well, all right, I just want to look perfect. I want to wear the right thing in front of the parents and the other kids. Do you get me?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I do. I got the napkins. You get the salt shakers.",
        "Janet: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Go for it. But, just so you know, if you're trying not to stand out in the crowd, forget it. It ain't gonna happen.",
        "Janet: Why not?",
        "Jack: Because you shine, Janet Ciccone Snyder. You're beautiful inside and out, and there's no hiding that.",
        "[Carly clears throat]",
        "Jack: Oh!",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Sorry to interrupt.",
        "Jack: What's going on?",
        "Carly: I need a favor.",
        "Jack: I knew that was coming.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Janet: Stop it. What do you need?",
        "Carly: Well, I have to go to Chicago today because I this fantastic opportunity --",
        "Jack: Well, what about Sage's play?",
        "Carly: Well, I'll be back in time for that. But I was sort of hoping that you could pick her up from school, and do her make up and get her in her costume, and get her back to school?",
        "Jack: You want me to do her makeup?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm going to try and be back in time, but if there's any traffic at all --",
        "Janet: I can do it. I can do -- her makeup. I can do that.",
        "Carly: It needs to be subtle.",
        "Janet: I can do subtle. Really. I can!",
        "Carly: Okay, thank you. Her costume's at the house.",
        "Jack: I'll swing by and pick it up when I get her.",
        "Carly: Okay. I'll have everything in a garment bag by the front door then.",
        "Jack: Sounds good.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Jack: Well, you don't want to keep Craig waiting, right? The business in Chicago, it's with Craig, no?",
        "Carly: Yeah, so?",
        "Janet: So?",
        "Jack: So good luck. I'll see you at Sage's play.",
        "Janet: And I will make sure that Sage looks spectacular. In a subtle way.",
        "Carly: Okay, thank you.",
        "Jack: You're right. It feels good staying out of Carly's business. What? What's wrong?",
        "Janet: Do you think her idea of subtle and mine are the same?",
        "Carly: What are you texting me for?",
        "Craig: I got nervous when you were in there for so long. Is Jack giving you a hard time?",
        "Carly: No, he wished me luck.",
        "Craig: Good. He's backing off.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Craig: Which should make you happy.",
        "Carly: It does. We should get going because I have to be back in just a couple of hours. Without fail.",
        "Craig: You will be. Wow. I'd buy whatever you're selling.",
        "Carly: Thanks, but I can't go.",
        "Craig: What is it now?",
        "Carly: I forgot Sage's pixie dust. What if we get all the way to Chicago, and I realize that I've forgotten something else?",
        "Craig: You'll have plenty of time. What are you afraid of, Carly?",
        "Carly: I suppose I'm afraid that this might actually work. That I won't ever have to worry about money again.",
        "Craig: No. You're serious.",
        "Carly: I'm serious. See, every time I've had any kind of major success, something terrible has happened and I've ended up more broke than I ever was. And if that happens this time, the kids will suffer, too, you know. And I just can't take that kind of risk.",
        "Craig: You don't trust me?",
        "Carly: I trust you to make us money. I just don't know if I trust how you're going to do it.",
        "Craig: I promise you this is completely legit.",
        "Carly: Would you believe you?",
        "Craig: Playing the angles is really exciting when you have nothing to lose. But I do have something to lose, Carly.",
        "Carly: Johnny.",
        "Craig: He is my last best chance to be a father and to get it right. I'm not about to blow this now. So we may be rich, we may be broke, but I swear, we won't be indicted.",
        "Carly: Money changes people.",
        "Craig: Pixie dust, I forget, what does it do again?",
        "Carly: Make you fly, of course.",
        "Craig: Makes you fly. Take the leap, Carly. For our kids. I'll warm up the car.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know, you've looked through the guide book like four times. There's nothing in there. It's not going to help. That's it. That's it. That's what I saw.",
        "Meg: What's the picture? Where is it? Where is that?",
        "Dusty: It's a statue of a husky in central park near a playground. We may as well try it.",
        "Meg: What about the rose petals? Are there any flowers there?",
        "Dusty: Not in February.",
        "Josie: Let's just get over there. We'll know what it means when we see it.",
        "Paul: I'll tell my mom we're leaving.",
        "Dusty: It's a long shot. Try not to get your hopes too high.",
        "Meg: Too late! Let's go get our little girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: There's it is. There's the statue.",
        "Dusty: Okay, careful. Let's be discreet here.",
        "Josie: Paul, does this feel right to you?",
        "Dusty: Is that what you saw?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Dusty: Where to next?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Josie: You saw flowers, right? Do you see anybody around here with flowers?",
        "Paul: I was hoping.",
        "Meg: Well, we had to try.",
        "Josie: Look at the woman.",
        "Meg: Roses. She's carrying roses.",
        "Josie: Looks like they're waiting for somebody.",
        "Dusty: Is that the guy?",
        "Paul: He's not the guy who took the car. But there's something about him.",
        "Meg: I'm going to talk to them.",
        "Dusty: Wait. You go talk to them. Get them to follow you somewhere. Meg and I will take their place -- see what they're waiting for.",
        "Paul: No, you go deal with the couple, Meg and I will stay here. I am Eliza's father.",
        "Dusty: If the couple is waiting for the carjacker to talk about the baby, you'll be recognized.",
        "Meg: Paul.",

        "Sage: Wait until you see my costume. It's beautiful!",
        "Janet: Oh, you know what? We took a sneak peek. And you are so going to look like a fairy princess.",
        "Sage: Tinkerbell is not a princess. Just a fairy. Where's Mom?",
        "Jack: She had to go to Chicago for a meeting, but she promised she'd be back in time for the show.",
        "Sage: But who's going to do my hair and make up?",
        "Janet: Me. I will.",
        "Sage: Mom did it really special. Did she tell you how to do it?",
        "Janet: Don't you worry about a thing. If there's one thing I know, it's how to make a girl look pretty.",
        "Sage: Are you sure?",
        "Janet: I'm positive.",

        "Carly: All right, where's the valet guy?",
        "Craig: You know, I think that went really well.",
        "Carly: He didn't say yes. He just said he'd think about it.",
        "Craig: That's to be expected. But I could tell he was really interested in what you had to offer. I mean your design for Midnight Sun.",
        "Carly: Whatever. We'll debrief in the car. Where is this guy? You know, I know we should have parked on the street. That's what we should have done.",
        "Craig: Well, I wanted to do that, but no, you thought the valet would be faster.",
        "Carly: Since when do you listen to me?",
        "Craig: We'll be back in plenty of time.",
        "Carly: Yeah, but if I hurry, I could still help Sage get dressed, you know? Oh, there he is. Hey! Why is he walking the other way? Craig, do you have the ticket?",
        "Craig: Of course I have the ticket.",
        "Carly: All right, well, go give it to him, get the keys and get the car yourself, okay?",

        "Ari: How fast can we get into production?",
        "Carly: Well, you know, I think because we thought you were going to be out of the country --",
        "Ari: I love your concept, so why wait? Come in. We'll work out a deal and get started.",
        "Carly: Okay, well, thank you very much. But really, we can't --",
        "Craig: We can't wait to start working with you. But it's freezing out here. Why don't you go inside, and we'll be right back in. Thank you. All right, this is it. Now let's go.",
        "Carly: No, wait, you know what? Just give me the ticket, okay? I'll go back to Oakdale, and you stay here and handle business.",
        "Craig: What if he wants to make a change in the design? No, we can't walk away from this, Carly. We'll be back in time. I promise you.",
        "Carly: This better not take long.",
        "Craig: That's the spirit. Come on.",

        "Paul: Are you here about the baby?",
        "Man: Yes, we are.",
        "Paul: I saw the flowers.",
        "Woman: We were told that they should be red.",

        "Paul: Do you want the baby?",
        "Dusty: You're shaking. Take some deep breaths.",

        "Dusty: No, it's too risky. If they're selling the baby they're going to want the money upfront.",
        "Meg: Oh my God, I didn't even think -- they're selling her?",
        "Dusty: They might be watching us right now, so take it easy.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. It's okay to be nervous. Anybody buying a baby off the black market's going to be nervous.",
        "Meg: You know, he said -- if we want to see the baby we don't have any money.",
        "Dusty: Here he comes.",

        "Dusty: Do you have the baby?",

        "Dusty: Well, you have to understand. She and I have never done anything like this before.",
        "Meg: Look, we brought it all. Every last penny. We just hid it nearby. But we've brought it, okay? We just want to see her, please?",
        "Thug #1: Wait here.",
        "Meg: She's all right. She's really all right. Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?",
        "Dusty: I've got to follow him.",
        "Meg: No, you can't! You can't.",
        "Dusty: I can't let him get away.",
        "Meg: He said to wait here. We have to wait here or he's not going to bring Eliza back.",
        "Dusty: What if he doesn't come back?",
        "Meg: No, look, he might be looking at us right now. Making sure we are who we say we are. Please, Dusty, we're so close. Eliza's so close. Please.",
        "Dusty: All right. We'll find a way to make it okay.",
        "Woman: Where are you taking us?",

        "Man: Not one more step.",
        "Woman: Charles, don't make him angry.",
        "Man: We've got the money, just give us the baby.",
        "Paul: You're going to buy a baby? You're disgusting.",
        "Man: Are you a cop?",
        "Woman: We just want a child.",
        "Paul: Yeah, our child! Somebody else's child! That child has a mother and father who love her! But because of you -- because of your willingness to pay -- someone stole our baby. And we want our baby back. We want our Eliza back! Why'd you steal our baby?",
        "Thug #2: Did you get the money?",
        "Thug #1: Just five grand.",
        "Thug #2: That'll get us out of town. We can sell the kid to somebody else.",

        "Janet: Hey!",
        "Jack: What do you got?",
        "Janet: Hi! Oh, I went to the drugstore, I had to get more makeup. You know, I had to get all the colors, like a rainbow of colors. You ready?",
        "Sage: Maybe we should wait for mom.",
        "Janet: Oh, no! Oh, come on. I'm good at this. Yeah, when I was a little bit older than you, I actually was in a couple of plays myself. Yes, I was. At the community theater, I did \"Sweet Charity.\" I played this --",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: Girl who works hard for her money. Anyway, the director, Mr. Archibald, told me the secret to good theatrical makeup is to make sure the audience can see every emotion on your face, from all the way in the back row.",
        "Jack: Honey, just so you know, the auditorium has, like, ten rows tops.",
        "Janet: Good, then they'll definitely be able to see her.",
        "Jack: Okay, maybe we should wait until we get to the school. There'll be other mothers there, and they can help --",
        "Janet: I'm a mother.",
        "Sage: And Mrs. McDonnell said we have to have our makeup done before we get there.",
        "Jack: I know, Honey. I know that, but --",
        "Janet: Honey, why don't you -- why don't you go upstairs? Go upstairs and let us girls do our thing, huh?",
        "Jack: I have to stack some wood on the porch, actually.",
        "Janet: Okay! Let's go stack some wood, then. Go on!",
        "Jack: Subtle.",
        "Janet: Remember sex? Because you're not going to be getting any for a very long time if you don't stop making me nervous! Okay. Tinkerbell -- what's she like?",
        "Sage: Didn't you ever read the book \"Peter Pan\"?",
        "Janet: Read the book? I thought it was just a -- no, I saw the movie with Liberty when she was a little girl. But all I remember was this bouncing thing of light.",
        "Sage: Is that why you got light-up barrettes?",
        "Janet: Yeah, these are cool. I wanted to be prepared, you know? Just in case. Are you going to be bouncing around a lot onstage?",
        "Sage: Well, I have a couple of lines. It's hard for me to remember. Mom usually helps me. I wish she was here.",
        "Janet: Me too. Because you know what? To be honest with you, I don't have a clue as to what \"Subtle\" means.",
        "Sage: Then what are we going to do?",
        "Janet: We're going to -- we're going to do our best.",
        "Sage: What if we mess up?",
        "Janet: Well, if we mess up, we'll laugh about it, and try and do better next time.",
        "Sage: I'm scared I'm going to forget my lines.",
        "Janet: Well, you know, if you want to, your dad and I, we can help you practice later.",
        "Sage: Will we have time after we do all this makeup?",
        "Janet: Sure. 'Cause you know what? We are almost -- almost done.",
        "Sage: But we didn't use everything.",
        "Janet: Yeah, you're right. Something's missing. I remember. I remember! Tah- dah! Where is it? Ah, look!",
        "Sage: What's that?",
        "Janet: It's Tinkerbell makeup.",
        "Sage: Can I see?",
        "Janet: Yeah. Here. Just a little bit there, a little bit there. Oh, my goodness! Ah! Okay.",
        "Sage: It's all glittery.",
        "Janet: I think Tinkerbell should glitter, don't you?",
        "Sage: Totally! I'm going to get my wings!",
        "Janet: Okay. Hey, you were hovering.",
        "Jack: I was observing. It's what I do.",
        "Janet: You like what you see?",

        "Carly: Craig, I'm going to launch you into the stratosphere if you don't get me home in time for this play.",
        "Craig: I know we're running a little behind schedule. But you have to admit, that was important.",
        "Carly: So is Sage's play.",
        "Craig: I promised I'd get you there and I will.",
        "Carly: Okay, well your car better go 150 miles an hour, because that's what it's going to take for you to get me there on time.",
        "Craig: I'll tell you what, I'll just go get the car myself, and I'll be right back.",

        "Dusty: I don't think --",

        "Dusty: He's not coming back.",
        "Meg: Yes he is! He wants the rest of the money. He just went to get Eliza.",

        "Paul: They're gone. They were going to buy our baby! I should have called the cops. What -- what's going on? What happened?",
        "Dusty: Some guy wanted money in exchange for the baby, and told us to wait here.",
        "Paul: How long ago did he leave?",
        "Dusty: Half an hour.",
        "Paul: Why didn't you follow him?",
        "Meg: He would have gone after him. But I wouldn't let him. It was all my fault.",
        "Dusty: It's not your fault.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe Josie knows something. Where's Josie? She's gone.",
        "Paul: You know, you two should be back at the police station looking at mug shots, not driving around.",
        "Dusty: A few extra minutes won't make any difference. So this is where they stole the car, huh? Which means they gotta live in this neighborhood.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well the cops have already canvassed this neighborhood. What makes you think that you're going to find something that they missed?",
        "Dusty: They got $5,000 in cash and a baby that they want to get rid of. So they're going to try to be leaving town. They probably have to do some things first.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Dusty: Pack. Maybe brag to a few friends. You really think Josie's going to answer?",

        "Dusty: Some people won't talk to cops, but they'll talk to a mother who's looking for her kid.",
        "Paul: Or they might talk to a couple of guys who are willing to throw some money at them.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, that's right. We show a picture of Eliza, and we offer money for information.",
