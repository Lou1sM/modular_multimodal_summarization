        "Lily: You know what? You are so cute, maybe we should put some first-class stamps on you -- put you in the mailbox for Valentine's Day. 'Cause you're so cute!",
        "Holden: Hey, what are you guys doing?",
        "Luke: Close your eyes. Don't look!",
        "Lily: Uh, we're just -- scram. Get out of here. C'mon' c'mon, c'mon. Don't look, don't look.",
        "Holden: Where's Natalie?",
        "Lily: She's sleeping upstairs.",
        "Holden: What's going on over there?",
        "Lily: It's just a surprise. That's all you need to know.",
        "Holden: You know what? Having you like this again -- playing with the kids, laughing, having fun, that -- that's the best surprise that I could ever get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Right you are, my boy. It's official. Tom said that the D.A. In Chicago has agreed to drop all of the criminal charges against Chris.",
        "Kim: It's about time!",
        "Nancy: We never doubted you for a second. I knew that the truth would come out.",
        "Chris: Well, the truth came out because Alison stopped listening to what everybody else thought and started listening to what she knew in her heart -- that I could never hurt our baby.",
        "Kim: I know, honey. I just -- I just wish it had happened sooner.",
        "Chris: Look, she stood up for me, Mom. That's the important thing. Against her mother, her sister, Aaron, the cops -- what?",
        "Kim: Uh, sorry. I just -- I was just thinking that this has been a very confusing time for everybody. And I was wondering if maybe it was a good time for you and Alison to have a little space. You know, take a little breather.",
        "Chris: Absolutely not. Holding back my feelings for Alison is what started all this trouble in the first place. I'm not gonna make that mistake again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Tell me that you didn't do this.",
        "Susan: Honey, I thought you'd be pleased! Look, all you have to do is sign right here and your marriage to Aaron will be null and void.",
        "Alison: You mean you didn't already sign it for me?",
        "Susan: Darling, I'm just trying to make things a little easier.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well this is my responsibility, not yours.",
        "Susan: That's right -- your responsibility. And from what I've seen the last few months, you need a lot more help in that area than you even realize.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, now I just have to figure out where I want to put that. Aaron, I have an easel over here. Would you help me for a second?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Molly: Wow, who'd have thunk it? The Ryan family, \"back and better than ever.\"",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, well, we couldn't have done it without Paul. I never knew he could be so forgiving.",
        "Molly: A real prince.",
        "Barbara: Okey-doke. Now, let's see what that thing looks like up here, okay?",
        "Jennifer: Mm-hmm. Right about here.",
        "Lucy: Molly, has my father been in yet?",
        "Molly: No, Lucy, no sign of him.",
        "Lucy: It's as if he's disappeared.",
        "Molly: Well, I haven't seen him since he stopped by for you last night. I don't mean to pry or anything, but are you ready to talk about what happened?",
        "Lucy: It's Cabot. Something's wrong with his adoption, and Rosanna and my father have to give him up. It's so awful, Molly. I don't know what we're gonna do without him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Cabot? Where's my baby? Where am I?",
        "Carly: So, how's Rosanna?",
        "Paul: She's fine, I guess. I don't know. Last night, she said she wanted to be left alone. I've tried to respect her wishes.",
        "Carly: She's asleep, I hope. The poor thing. Ripped my heart out, watching her last night give that baby up.",
        "Paul: Can't even imagine.",
        "Carly: Thank you for whatever you said to her last night that made her decide to give the baby to the police and for taking her here, and being so good to her. You're being a wonderful friend.",
        "[Rosanna sobbing]",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Rosanna: He's gone! Oh, my God. My baby is gone!",
        "Craig: I'd like to see my wife.",
        "Paul: She doesn't want to see you.",
        "Craig: You like having Rosanna crying in your apartment all night?",
        "Paul: Don't be an idiot, Craig. I hate this. This is horrible.",
        "Craig: Oh, oh. I see now. You're just as self-involved and vengeful as your parents. I mean, isn't this the revenge you wanted all along",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm not the one who stole a baby and thought I was so clever that I wasn't gonna get caught. Guess what, Craig? You got caught. All I did was help a friend in need. And if that friend says that she doesn't want to see you -- you're not gonna see her. How is she?",
        "Carly: She woke up; hoping last night was a bad dream. You know, I can't even imagine the pain she must be feeling. Was that Craig at the door?",
        "Paul: Yeah. He's tried sending notes and flowers and telegrams -- I'm surprised he hasn't tried skywriting. But I made a promise to try and keep him from her, and that's what I'm gonna do.",
        "Carly: Well, you can't just stay here and play bodyguard all day.",
        "Paul: I don't see why not.",
        "Carly: Isn't tonight your big B.R.O. Shindig?",
        "Paul: I'll stay here as long as it takes. I ordered enough champagne; they probably haven't even noticed I'm not there.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm gonna go, okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Call me, I guess.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you do the same. Call me if you need anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Carly.",
        "Carly: No. No, Craig. She doesn't want to see you.",
        "Craig: She has to. I have to explain to her that --",
        "Carly: Do you honestly think there is any way that you can explain what you've done? She lost her baby because of you.",
        "Craig: I have to convince her that it had nothing to do with my --",
        "Carly: I have helped you for the last time, Craig. You're on your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Oh, hi, Dad. You're early.",
        "Hal: Too early to take my wife out for a Valentine's Day dinner? What's going on here?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, we're getting ready for the party.",
        "Hal: What?",
        "Jennifer: To announce new developments at B.R.O. Dad, I sent you an invitation.",
        "Hal: Oh. It -- it must've fallen in the trash. Let's get the hell out of here before --",
        "Barbara: Emily. I'm so glad that I ran into you. I never had a chance to thank you for dropping the assault charges.",
        "Emily: There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you, Barbara. But if you think for a minute I've forgiven you for whacking me over the head with a rolling pin, you are crazier than I thought.",
        "Barbara: Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?",
        "Emily: Yeah, as a matter of fact, there is. Just stay as far away from me as humanly possible, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Well, you'll be able to change your mind someday about that. I mean, if Paul can forgive me, then maybe --",
        "Hal: Paul forgives you? Since when?",
        "Jennifer: If you had even checked your invitation, you would know. Paul is back at B.R.O.",
        "Barbara: \"Back and better than ever.\" That's our motto.",
        "Jennifer: Paul is willing to forgive and forget, for Will's sake.",
        "Hal: You don't say. Now, I didn't hear anything in the weather report about hell freezing over. Do you want to go to a party tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: What you have to understand is that I almost lost my baby in Chicago. If anything had happened to you --",
        "Alison: I -- I know.",
        "Susan: I know I'm not always the most attentive mother. I know I can be annoying, but you have to let me mother you -- just a little while longer.",
        "Alison: Mom, I love Chris. And Chris loves me. And I don't know what's gonna happen, but that's for me and Chris to decide. Not me and Chris and you. You have to learn to trust me. If you can't do that, then maybe moving home was the biggest mistake I've made.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Hi, honey, on your way out?",
        "Chris: Yeah, I bought something for Alison, so --",
        "Kim: Oh, Chris. Don't you think you should let her rest? Kind of recoup a bit? Why don't you drop it by later?",
        "Bob: You know, I -- I got an idea. We're invited to this party that sounds like fun. Why don't you join us?",
        "Chris: Thanks, Dad. I don't really feel like a party.",
        "Nancy: It'll be good for you. Show everyone that your legal troubles are over and that you have nothing for which to apologize.",
        "Chris: \"Back and better than ever.\" You know what? You may be onto something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Happy Valentine's Day.",
        "Alison: Oh, my God! They're beautiful! Thank you.",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. So, there's this party at metro tonight. B.R.O. is starting over again, and they're having this big celebration. And it being Valentine's Day and everything, I was hoping tonight could be our new beginning, too. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Careful, you'll get glitter all over you. And glue.",
        "Holden: Listen, I -- I know that it's not easy for you to be smiling and making valentines, but the kids and I -- we really do appreciate it.",
        "Lily: The children need me to be a good mother, and that's what I'm doing. I'm trying. And this foundation with Dusty, I'm doing it for you. I am a mother. If you think it's going to help me get over Rose's death, I don't wanna do it. I don't. I'm expected to do it. Just, please, don't expect too much.",
        "Holden: I won't. But right now, I need to steal you away for a few minutes while the kids are having dinner.",
        "Lily: Okay. What for?",
        "Holden: Because I have a surprise for you -- something special, something that I think, in a very small way, might help you keep Rose in your life. Be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Barbara: Like the sign says, we're \"back and better than ever\"!",
        "Reporter: So what does the future hold for this newly reconstituted B.R.O.?",
        "Barbara: Well, I'm gonna let my son answer that question for you when he gets here. In the meantime, why don't you all just mix, mingle and meet. Where is he?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I think he just probably wants to be fashionably late, Mom. He'll be here. You just -- you go over, dazzle those reporters, and I'll be right there.",
        "Barbara: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: Paul -- you better be dead already, because if you are backing out this now, I'm gonna kill you myself. Oh, where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Go to your party, Paul. You did a masterful job at keeping Craig away, but I think I can manage by myself.",
        "Paul: I'll call you, okay?",
        "Rosanna: Okay. I've got your number. Hey, and listen -- you've really done a lot for me the last couple of days. You've been a terrific friend. I've never really had a friend like -- like you before, so I know it may not sound like much, but thank you. Thanks.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Rosanna: What took you so long? Come on in, Craig.",
        "Rosanna: The family that you are talking about, it never even existed! The whole thing was built on a lie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Turn around. Hey, no peeking. Happy Valentine's Day.",
        "Lily: A baby Rose bush?",
        "Holden: Well, it's not just any baby Rose bush. It's a hybrid. Do you remember that guy that I told you about that I met at that conference a few months back?",
        "Lily: Oh, yeah.",
        "Holden: Well, he developed it. I traded him a colt for the pleasure of naming this little beauty, and now it's yours.",
        "Lily: What did you name it? \"Rose of the angels\" D'Angelo.",
        "Holden: What do you think?",
        "Lily: It's incredible. Thank you.",
        "Holden: The best part is that it's late blooming, so when all the other roses have faded, this one will still be full of life -- just like Rose always was.",
        "Lily: I love you so much.",
        "Holden: You know, Lily, I've been afraid that I was losing you.",
        "Lily: No. No, no, you would never lose me. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Say what you have to say and get out.",
        "Craig: All right. Everything I did, I did because I loved you. All I ever wanted was to make you happy.",
        "Rosanna: So you allowed me to fall in love with a child that you knew I would never be able to keep?",
        "Craig: I thought he was ours forever! I made plans for him. I was gonna give him the world, Rosanna. He was my child just as much as yours. I lost him, too.",
        "Rosanna: You didn't want him to begin with.",
        "Craig: Well, sure, at the beginning, that is true. A baby was the last thing I wanted. I told you that, but you wouldn't listen. All right, so, sure, I sabotaged the opportunity we had to adopt. But I saw that you were not happy. So I went into this only because I knew it was what you want. And then -- and then, when I -- when I found Cabot, you were right. I changed. I fell in love with him. He brought my family back. He filled the hole that I'd had in my heart ever since Bryant died. He brought us together.",
        "Rosanna: And you tore us apart.",
        "Craig: No! No! No, I didn't. I sure didn't mean to! My intentions were the best! Oh -- so we sustained a little damage here, okay? Doesn't mean you throw it all away, right? You work at it. You make it better. And then, when you're ready to adopt again --",
        "Rosanna: What are you saying?! This cannot be resolved! Cabot cannot be replaced. That family that you are talking about, it never even existed! The whole thing was built on a lie!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Finally.",
        "Paul: Finally, yeah. It looks like the party's in full swing.",
        "Barbara: It sure is. Are you ready to talk to the press?",
        "Paul: You know what? Tonight, I feel like there's nothing I can't do.",
        "Barbara: I don't remember the last time I felt this way. You know that?",
        "Paul: What, happy?",
        "Barbara: You just multiply that by infinity, and you're getting a little bit close.",
        "Paul: Well, that is exactly what I wanted to hear.",
        "Barbara: I'm gonna go get that photographer. You don't move, okay?",
        "Paul: You got it.",
        "Molly: I hear Rosanna had to give up the baby. How's that feel? How does that make you feel knowing that you and I are the ones responsible?",
        "Paul: You know what, Molly? This is not the right time for me to be talking about this.",
        "Molly: Oh, you're right, it's not. 'Cause this is the time you have to pretend that you forgive your mother and go along with this big sham of a party, right? How do you do that?",
        "Emily: Oh, honey, there's Alison. I'm gonna go say hello. I'll be right back.",
        "Paul: Hal -- hey, I thought you tossed your invitation.",
        "Hal: Well, when I heard that you and Barbara had made the peace, let's just say it was something I just had to see for myself.",
        "Paul: Well, we're doing this for Will.",
        "Hal: Yeah, that's what I keep hearing.",
        "Paul: The guy needs a stable environment to come home to when he's done with all of this, and I'm gonna make sure he has that. If I gotta make peace with Barbara, then that's just the way it's gotta be.",
        "Hal: Hey, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Hi. Hi.",
        "Hal: Really something, ain't it? Have you ever seen anybody do a faster 180 than your mother and Paul?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I had my doubts about this instant reunion, as well. But you know what's keeping it working, Dad, is us working together. You know? You're so excited to back at B.R.O.",
        "Paul: Absolutely. I've been in this business a long time -- my whole life. It's in my blood.",
        "Aaron: Looking good there.",
        "Alison: Thanks. I thought I should tell you that my mother went right to work on getting an annulment for us.",
        "Aaron: Wow that was fast.",
        "Alison: Yeah, so all we have to do is sign, and it's like our marriage never even happened. It is kind of weird, right?",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah. It's like everything we went through --",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Aaron: -- All we gotta do is sign a paper and its -- its over.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but you're okay with the way that everything worked out.",
        "Aaron: Oh, totally. Oh, definitely. Ali, I'm great.",
        "Alison: You've been really great to me, and I know that I put you through a lot.",
        "Aaron: No, listen, it's cool. Look, I'm just very happy to see you smiling.",
        "Alison: You're the best friend a girl could have.",
        "Lucy: You know, I was right. I shouldn't be here. I should be home with my father and Rosanna.",
        "Clark: Like I said a couple million times already, there's nothing for you at home. This is something your folks have to take care of by themselves. So let me do my part and take care of you. Just put yourself in my hands. I promise, you won't regret it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You didn't have to get me anything, honey. [Jack laughs] Oh, you didn't!",
        "Jack: I did.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack. How did you remember that I wanted this? It costs a fortune!",
        "Jack: Small price to pay for fantasy.",
        "Carly: Oh, I love it, I love it!",
        "Jack: Oh, thank you. You see, I've got this image of you wearing this, a pair of incredibly high heels and a smile. I know you've had your hands full with the kids lately, with your family and your friends, and you really haven't had a minute to yourself. And you certainly haven't had a chance to design anything these days. So I thought you deserved something special -- something just for you. Happy Valentine's Day.",
        "Carly: You are gonna have a very happy valentine's day, too.",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no, we don't have time for that. The baby-sitter's gonna be here any minute, and we've gotta get changed.",
        "Carly: For what?",
        "Jack: I'm taking you to Metro.",
        "Carly: Isn't that where they're having the big party's for B.R.O.?",
        "Jack: Why, yes, it is. And as a matter of fact, I found the invitation right here in the trash can.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. No. The only reason that Barbara sent me that is to try and make me jealous because of this fashion venture, and that it's happening without me.",
        "Jack: Oh, no, it isn't, 'cause you're gonna wear this. You designed it, right? It's a million times more original than Barbara Ryan could ever come up with.",
        "Carly: Jack, she's never gonna hire me.",
        "Jack: So what? There's gonna be photographers there, right? Reporters, people from the industry. You show up wearing this, and people are gonna forget that Barbara Ryan's in the room. In fact, it's gonna be worth it just to see the look on her face when you outshine anything she could ever design.",
        "Carly: Why, Jack Snyder, I think I'm beginning to rub off on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I -- I thought maybe you would like to know that the -- the charges against Chris were formally withdrawn today.",
        "Susan: Yes, I know. He was here. He asked Alison to go to the party at Metro.",
        "Kim: Yeah, I know, I know. In fact, that's one of the reasons I thought this would be a good time for me to speak to you.",
        "Susan: Oh, really? What about?",
        "Kim: About Chris and Alison.",
        "Susan: Oh. Sit down.",
        "Kim: Thank you. Bob and I -- to be perfectly honest, we're just really grateful that Chris has finally made some decisions about his life and decided that he wants to be a doctor. And you know firsthand what it's like to be a young intern and the kind of responsibilities that they take on, and that there's not much time left for anything else. Right or wrong, we had always assumed that when Chris finally did get involved with somebody, it would be somebody who had a little more maturity, closer to his age and somebody who shared the same goals. And as far as Alison is concerned, I mean, she's a young girl. And she should be free at her age to -- well, I mean, she hasn't even finished her education. For crying out loud, what does she need to be tied down to a serious relationship?",
        "Susan: What indeed? And since you've come all the way over here to tell me that my daughter is not educated or good enough for your son --",
        "Kim: Wait a minute.",
        "Susan: -- Let me tell you a couple things about your son. He is not exactly the prince you've convinced yourself he is.",
        "Kim: Okay. Fair enough. But wasn't it a little much for you to rush out and slap a restraining order on him? Especially after your daughter had put him through all those lies and --",
        "Susan: He was charged with attempted murder! What'd you expect me to do? Roll out the red carpet for the guy?",
        "Kim: Wait a minute, kiddo! She put him through all kinds of manipulations, and I thought he conducted himself pretty well. Besides which, you have known Chris since he was born. He was a colleague of yours. On top of which, when Rick Decker was gonna add you and Alison to his body count, Christopher saved your life. I would have thought you might have remembered that. But not you. You're still the same little old backstabber you always have been.",
        "Susan: Oh, I get it. This isn't about Chris and Alison. This is about us -- you and me.",
        "Kim: Oh, that's ridiculous.",
        "Susan: This is about what happened with Bob all those years ago, me and bob.",
        "Kim: A waste of time.",
        "Susan: You resent me! You still haven't forgiven me after all these years! Does Bob know? Have you forgiven Bob yet?",
        "Kim: If that were true, wouldn't you just love it? Sorry, old girl. I forgave the whole thing a long time ago.",
        "Susan: But you just can't forget. Is that it?",
        "Kim: Well, Susan, now that you mention it, how the hell can I forget you? You never stay out of my life long enough so that I can forget you. Long before Bob and I were ever involved, you were so busy running around trying to find a way to destroy my life. And as for the Hughes family -- well, you and your daughter seemed to have made it your mission in life to drop in occasionally and take a crack at destroying our family. Forget you? Fat chance! I am so sick of the Stewart women. I don't trust any of you any further than I can throw you.",
        "Susan: Say hi to Bob.",

Because when you left me, you took a part of me with you. And I just -- I don't know if I'm gonna get her back. For the rest of my days I want you by my side",

        "Hal: Well, one minute you're so furious at Barbara, you can't say her name without frothing at the mouth, and the next you're ready for your close-up, all smiles and back in business with her. She kissed you a second ago. I mean, when did you ever let that happen without getting a tetanus shot first?",
