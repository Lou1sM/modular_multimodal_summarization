        "Meg: Penicillin, 500 milligrams. Propanadol, 60 milligrams.",
        "Paul: You shouldn't worry. I'm sure you didn't miss anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cheri: Stop right there. What exactly do you think you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I know you want to think that I wouldn't set Will up. And that I'm a better person than this, but I'm not.",
        "Maddie: You are. You look out for other people.",
        "Casey: Not this time. I owed way too much money, I didn't know how to make things right.",
        "Maddie: There's got to be more to it than that.",
        "Casey: More than stealing from my own mom, and then stealing from my best friend? Trashing my grandma's club? And then embarrassing my mom in front of everyone she works with. And I blew you off to gamble. I mean, I can go on and on.",
        "Maddie: There has to be a reason, though.",
        "Casey: It's because I couldn't face what I'd done. All right, I let down every person that ever trusted me. You know what that feels like?",
        "Maddie: It has to feel terrible.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and the worst part is it doesn't even matter that I'm sorry.",
        "Maddie: It matters to me. And I just wish that you would have told me what was going on.",
        "Casey: So, you could've worried?",
        "Maddie: No, I could've helped you.",
        "Casey: Nah, no one can help me.",
        "Maddie: People want to try. And you need to help yourself by admitting what really happened with those bonds.",
        "Casey: I just did!",
        "Maddie: You left something out.",
        "Casey: Like what?",
        "Maddie: Like the fact you weren't the one that made Will look like a thief and a liar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Go away, Jade.",
        "Jade: Just listen.",
        "Will: What? To you defend Casey and trash my brother? Forget it.",
        "Jade: Everything I've told you about Adam is true. He's the one who set you up. He's scamming you.",
        "Will: Well, I guess you haven't heard, but Casey just confessed to that.",
        "Jade: Well, if he did, he lied.",
        "Will: You're the one who's lying. You just want to get back at Adam because he dumped you.",
        "Jade: This is not about me. This is about you! Ever since your brother's been home, he's been working you. You can't trust him.",
        "Will: And I can trust you? I'm sorry. I made that mistake before. It's not going to happen again. So, please just leave me and my brother alone.",
        "Jade: Will, Will, if Adam is all about helping you and being loyal, tell me one thing. Why is he leaving town tonight?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What are you doing out here all by yourself?",
        "Adam: I was just going to ask you're the same thing.",
        "Gwen: Well, I've been looking all over for you.",
        "Adam: Yeah?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I called everywhere I could think of. Why aren't you picking up your phone?",
        "Adam: I forgot to charge my battery. Why are you looking for me?",
        "Gwen: I thought maybe you could help me talk to Will. Hey, what's with the backpack? Are you going somewhere?",
        "Adam: Yeah, this was totally last minute, but I've got to go to London.",
        "Gwen: Wait, tonight? Why? What's the rush?",
        "Adam: This guy, this record exec I know from L.A. You know, he gave me a call and he listened to some of your songs and he's thinking he might want to sign you.",
        "Gwen: What, what guy? What record company? What songs --",
        "Adam: Martin at Coram? You remember? Oh, you might not. Anyway, I sent him the unfinished demo, you know the first five tracks.",
        "Gwen: Wait, without telling me?",
        "Adam: Yeah, I wasn't sure he'd be open to a pitch, but if he liked it, I know I'd be able to get the financing to finish it -- I just didn't want to tell you, because if it didn't work out, I didn't want you to be disappointed.",
        "Gwen: So you were only going to tell me if it was good news?",
        "Adam: Yeah, that was kind of the idea. You know, I'll call you from over there. I got to get to the -- I can't miss the flight --",
        "Gwen: Whoa, whoa, wait, hey! Look, you can't leave right now. There's way too much going on here.",
        "Adam: Look, Gwen, I really can't pass this chance up.",
        "Gwen: It's not for my sake. Your brother just arrested. I think you need to be here for him.",
        "Adam: I can't. You know, you and me, we've already lost a momentum on our career. I can't let this go by.",
        "Gwen: Whoa, hold on. What are you going to do? Walk to the airport?",
        "Adam: Yeah, I was going to hitch. The battery in my car died, and I couldn't call anyone because my cell phone was dead.",
        "Gwen: Wow. Batteries are just dying all over the place.",
        "Adam: Besides, you know, you were with Will, and my parents are tied up with Casey --",
        "Gwen: What are you so angry about?",
        "Adam: I'm fine.",
        "Gwen: No, you didn't look fine when you were arguing with Jade. I went to Tom and Margo's looking for you. And I showed up when I saw what looked like a pretty nasty fight.",
        "Adam: I didn't see you.",
        "Gwen: Well, you took off before I had a chance to catch up with you.",
        "Adam: What about Jade? Did you talk to her?",
        "Gwen: No, I should've gone after her and made her tell me where Will was. She always seems to know these things.",
        "Adam: Stay away from Jade, okay? She's toxic. And whatever crap she says about me, don't believe it.",
        "Gwen: Don't worry, believe me, there's not a word that could come out of that girl's mouth that I would believe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I told Adam that I was on to him. That I knew that he lied to turn Gwen against you.",
        "Will: And you've never done anything like that.",
        "Jade: All right. Fine. I deserved that. But I know how he thinks. And you can give me that, at least.",
        "Will: No, I don't think you do.",
        "Jade: He didn't even deny setting you up.",
        "Will: Well, maybe he felt like he shouldn't have to defend himself to you.",
        "Jade: Or maybe he wanted to shut me up so he can get out of town before the truth comes out! Which is going to be a little difficult without his keys.",
        "Will: How's that?",
        "Jade: I tossed them in the bushes at Margo and Tom's. He's probably still crawling around looking for them.",
        "Will: And you're proud of that?",
        "Jade: I'm helping you out.",
        "Will: No, you're just jealous because he took interest in Gwen, because he believes in her talent.",
        "Jade: No, that's why you're jealous. Adam is a user and he should be stopped.",
        "Will: So you're going to rope me in to fight your battle for you? You can forget it!",
        "Jade: You're not listening.",
        "Will: Do you want to fight with me, with Adam, with anyone who's going to take you on. But I'm not going to do it.",
        "Jade: You'd rather fight with Gwen?",
        "Will: I just got back from seeing Casey. And he confessed to everything. To breaking in at Crash, planting the bond --",
        "Jade: Yeah, that's because he's too decent to turn in his own brother, which is more than I can say for Adam.",
        "Will: You can save your conspiracy theory, Jade.",
        "Jade: Fine. Don't listen to me. But look at the facts. Look at your marriage. It's falling apart. And look how the robbery brought Adam and Gwen closer together.",
        "Will: Yeah, it's like you had a hand in it.",
        "Jade: I saw how much my lies about being pregnant hurt you and Gwen. And I'm trying to make up for that.",
        "Will: And make Adam suffer.",
        "Jade: So you don't even care that when I flat-out accused him of trying to make it look like you were jealous of Gwen's success, he didn't even deny it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I really wish it wasn't true, but I stole those bonds.",
        "Maddie: And I get why you did it. I grew up around gamblers, remember? My mom was always about to make a killing on the next big race, or the next number that was going to hit. It was the wrong kind of hope, and it made her do stupid things.",
        "Casey: This was beyond stupid.",
        "Maddie: You honestly believed that you were going to be able to pay everyone back.",
        "Casey: I know, how crazy was that?",
        "Maddie: At least you wanted to make good on what you owed.",
        "Casey: And I still have to -- somehow.",
        "Maddie: And you're going to. Okay? And that's why no one, not even you, can make me believe you would set Will up. You wouldn't do that to your best friend. You wouldn't let him take the fall for something that he didn't even do.",
        "Casey: Why? I already have. Remember when I got Gwen pregnant?",
        "Maddie: Come on, that was -- you've changed since then.",
        "Casey: Obviously, not that much.",
        "Maddie: But if you didn't want to point the finger at Will, who did? And why do you want to protect them?",
        "Casey: It's not like that.",
        "Maddie: Who are you covering for?",
        "Casey: No one! All right, I'm still the same screw-up I've always been. Ask my parents. They see it, and so should you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yeah, I'm back. I can handle Casey's booking if you want me to.",
        "Margo: Yeah, you brought him in. You should carry through.",
        "Jack: I hated arresting him, Margo. You got to know that.",
        "Margo: It's your job, Jack. I've been there myself.",
        "Jack: Yeah, with me. When Carly left the country and you looked the other way when you heard my story.",
        "Margo: Apples and oranges, Jack. Besides, Carly was being sought be Leonian law enforcement --",
        "Jack: I just wish there was something I could do for Casey.",
        "Margo: Well, you can. You can pray that Tom can convince the judge to grant an immediate bail hearing.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's going to be a tough call. Judge doesn't want to show favoritism.",
        "Margo: Yeah. And being my son isn't going to be a real plus for Casey in lock up.",
        "Jack: I can make sure -- can make sure there's a guard down there.",
        "Margo: Look, I don't want my son here overnight.",
        "Jack: I can make sure there's a guard there at all times --",
        "Margo: All right, all right thanks, thanks, thanks.",
        "Jack: Can I do anything for you? Do you want anything?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I'd like a break. I think I'm due for one, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You're right. I am on top of everything, this time.",
        "Paul: Why are you so out of sorts?",
        "Meg: I'm tired, okay? I've been pulling some extra shifts. Why are you here, Paul?",
        "Paul: I have an appointment with my neurologist, Dr. Kipner.",
        "Meg: Well, he's heavy into research.",
        "Paul: That's what my mother heard. I'm hoping he can make it so visions of pools of blood don't just appear suddenly in front of my eyes.",
        "Meg: Well, I hope it works for you. I mean that.",
        "Paul: Can I ask you a question?",
        "Meg: What now?",
        "Paul: Well, you said before that you were on top of things this time? Don't you usually triple check a dose?",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Paul: So what's different?",
        "Meg: Nothing. Why are you harping on this?",
        "Paul: No, I'm just curious.",
        "Meg: Well, don't be.",
        "Paul: What is okay? It's not okay to be concerned about you?",
        "Meg: How many different ways do I have to tell you we're not together again?",
        "Craig: How is Oakdale's Florence Nightingale?",
        "Meg: Feeling more like Typhoid Mary.",
        "Craig: Stop. You're a terrific nurse.",
        "Meg: Terrific nurses don't kill their patients, Craig. And if anyone finds out, I will never work again.",
        "Craig: Do you want to keep your voice down? I think there's more cops in this hospital than doctors. And I thought we agreed that you didn't kill anyone.",
        "Meg: I know. You keep saying that, but it doesn't make it true.",
        "Craig: What happened was a tragic accident.",
        "Meg: Caused by my negligence.",
        "Craig: It's over, Meg. Put it behind you.",
        "Meg: I can't! You covered up what I did with a fake diary. But I know my patient wasn't suicidal. I know it was my fault that she died and I'm the one who has to live with that.",
        "Craig: And you think that guilt and shame is going to resurrect her?",
        "Meg: How can you be so callous? And not just about Sarah? Both of us could end up in jail if they found out what we did.",
        "Craig: I knew the risks, and it was worth it, if I can keep you from feeling responsible for something that was out of your hands. I just -- I just wanted to take that away.",
        "Meg: I know you did it for me.",
        "Craig: Great. Then make peace with it. And remember you're not alone. For now on, we're in this together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm having a cocktail. I don't know why that is any of your business.",
        "Cheri: From what I saw, it looked like you were about to do a little business of your own.",
        "Emily: Exactly what are you implying?",
        "Cheri: Oh, I'll come straight out and say it. This is my territory. Exclusive to me and my girls.",
        "Emily: Excuse me?",
        "Cheri: I don't know who you work for, or if you fly solo.",
        "Emily: I don't work for anyone. And I haven't done anything wrong. Now, get out of my way.",
        "Dusty: Is there a problem?",
        "Emily: No, no, there's no trouble here. Nothing wrong. I accidentally took this nice lady's seat when she was in the ladies room. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.",
        "Cheri: Oh, it's all right. I'm just a creature of habit. I like my spot.",
        "Emily: Well, that was weird. Hey, Chaz. How's it going?",
        "Chaz: How's it going?",
        "Emily: Good.",
        "Dusty: I never expected to see you here.",
        "Emily: It's funny. I've never been. This is my first time.",
        "Dusty: Mine too. This guy wanted to drink scotch somewhere other than the Lakeview.",
        "Chaz: Well, let's order already. Emily?",
        "Emily: A vodka martini, thank you.",
        "Chaz: Two single malts neat. And another vodka martini for the lady.",
        "Dusty: How about you? How did you end up here?",
        "Emily: Me? I'm going to make right on those promises I was tossing around at the Worldwide meeting. Increase circulation. I'm meeting a source.",
        "Dusty: Oh, so you're doing a story? That's good.",
        "Chaz: I hope it's not a happy hooker.",
        "Emily: Why would you think that?",
        "Chaz: You don't have any clue who you were just talking to?",
        "Emily: She is?",
        "Chaz: She calls herself Cheri. She runs a high-priced call girl operation right out of here.",
        "Emily: What are you kidding? I had no idea.",
        "Chaz: She's very polished, but she is one tough broad. You do not want to cross paths with this chick.",
        "Dusty: Are you speaking from personal experience, Chaz?",
        "Chaz: Donovan, don't be a wise guy, all right? I like the ladies, not working girls.",
        "Emily: Okay, okay, I will certainly steer clear of Madame Cherie in the future.",
        "Dusty: That would be smart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Darian: Hey, that last minute shot at the buzzer, awesome.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but you had like, four team rebounds. I mean, coach is going to make you M.V.P.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, hi.",
        "Luke: Oh, hey, Grandma.",
        "Lucinda: Fresh young face. Do you have time to hang out with me?",
        "Luke: Yes, please. Please, please slide in.",
        "Lucinda: Slide in.",
        "Luke: But a question, since when did you ever go to al's?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, -- well, when I was undergoing chemo, I had one of the oncologists said that I should have milkshakes. You know, a milkshake. To keep up my strength and -- I'm addicted.",
        "Luke: Hey, I'll never tell.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. So, do you and Darian, Shamar -- do you come here after practice every time?",
        "Luke: How do you know their names?",
        "Lucinda: I've been to six games this season.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I don't expect you to memorize the team roster.",
        "Lucinda: Shamar's a little streaky, but he makes a decent lay-up. Gary, Gary, you know he's not bad at the free throw line, when he focuses. Of course, you, my Darling, you -- they don't hold the candle to you because you are the star.",
        "Luke: Oh, and I guess you being my grandmother wouldn't make you biased or anything?",
        "Lucinda: Not at all. Not at all. So, where are the guys rushing off to?",
        "Luke: They have plans.",
        "Lucinda: Plans that didn't include you?",
        "Luke: They had dates, Grandma. With girls. Somehow, I'd be a little out of place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So, the MRI didn't show anything abnormal?",
        "Dr. Kipner: I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan. But there's no physiological explanations for you --",
        "Paul: I don't need for you to explain anything to me, I need for you to make them stop. Like, please shock me, drug me, whatever.",
        "Dr. Kipner: I think our best course is to give this time.",
        "Paul: I don't want to spend any more time in this twilight zone. That's why I came to you.",
        "Dr. Kipner: Well, you might be better off with my colleague. She specializes in emotional causes --",
        "Paul: No, no. No more shrinks. You don't understand. When I have these visions, my whole life stops. I can't take it anymore.",
        "Dr. Kipner: Just give it some time. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Knowing you and I are in anything together really isn't a comfort.",
        "Craig: You know, I really wish that you didn't make me out to be such an ogre.",
        "Meg: Oh, it seems to me that you earned that reputation all on your own.",
        "Craig: Oh, really? As I recall, I've consistently been a gentlemen where you're concerned.",
        "Meg: That's true.",
        "Craig: Yes, it is. After all, I didn't let you embarrass yourself when you had too much to drink.",
        "Meg: I guess I did throw myself all over you.",
        "Craig: In a very charming way. And as tempted as I was, I didn't want any regrets between us.",
        "Meg: I appreciate that.",
        "Craig: I'm glad. Don't think I didn't kick myself after.",
        "Jack: Meg, are you still on duty?",
        "Meg: I just finished a shift.",
        "Jack: Can I borrow you for a couple of minutes?",
        "Meg: Fine. I guess.",
        "Craig: I'll let you have some privacy so you can discuss the latest crisis in the clan --",
        "Jack: No, it's not a family matter. It's a police matter, Craig, and it concerns both of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Well, I'm not in jail yet, so I take it the bail hearing is coming through?",
        "Tom: Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Because of the additional complaint that Will Munson filed against you for obstruction of justice, you are going to have to be rebooked on every charge.",
        "Casey: So, what does that mean?",
        "Tom: Well, you see, it speaks to intent. When you set up a friend, it makes you look like a very calculating human being.",
        "Margo: And that will be a consideration before the judge can consider a decision.",
        "Tom: And I already had to speak to the judge to ask him not to make any exceptions for you because you're my son. I just never thought I'd have to do that.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry, Dad. I really am.",
        "Margo: That can be, you know, an act of desperation. Not that it's okay.",
        "Tom: But to try to make Will Munson look culpable, that requires some real thinking.",
        "Casey: I really wasn't thinking.",
        "Tom: And Will Munson of all people, he's been like a brother to you.",
        "Margo: And he just lost his father just a few short months ago. And what does this going to do to his marriage to Gwen?",
        "Tom: You're aware that this marriage might not survive this, right? So tell me something, how did it get this far?",
        "Casey: I'm sorry.",
        "Tom: What!",
        "Margo: You know what I'm going to say, don't you?",
        "Tom: Yeah, just save your breath.",
        "Margo: This is exactly the kind of stress you were told to avoid.",
        "Tom: My son is going to have a criminal record for deliberately implicating a lifelong friend. So, I'm supposed to, what? Ignore that?",
        "Margo: But it's not going to help anybody if you go back to the hospital with another heart attack. So, please, Tom, there's got to be a reason for this. We just don't know it yet.",

        "Casey: No, and the worse part is that they hate me.",

        "Adam: Me? Casey's the one who got caught.",
        "Gwen: Casey's the one that got caught? Did your brother have help setting up Will? Is that why you're in such a hurry to get out of here?",
        "Adam: Gwen, I told you why I was leaving.",
        "Gwen: Tell me this. Did you help Casey steal those bonds?",
        "Adam: No. I was with you when it happened.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I remember. I also remember thinking when I found that bond, I was like, wow, he really doesn't seem as freaked out about this as I do. Why is that, Adam? Because you already knew it was going to be there?",
        "Adam: It was the only way.",
        "Gwen: Casey didn't plant that bond, you did.",

        "Gwen: Will is your brother. You knew what was at stake for him, you knew what this could cost him.",

        "Lucinda: Why? You feel they've been discriminating against you?",
        "Luke: No, well, there's this one teacher, Mrs. Goodwin. She doesn't know, she's trying to be nice --",
        "Lucinda: Well, that answers that question. But what does she do?",
        "Luke: She tried to get me to join the drama club. Because I'm so sensitive and she can tell that I have talent.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Dear.",

        "Luke: Yeah, I just wish they wouldn't do it.",
        "Lucinda: So, have you said to Mrs. Whatever-her-name-is, no, you're not going to do this --",
        "Luke: Well, she wanted me to try out for some part in this play, and I told her that I would think about it. But then I didn't show up at the auditions.",
        "Lucinda: Maybe you should have.",
        "Luke: Are you kidding me? I can't act. I hate it when we even have to like, read aloud in lit class.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you don't have to do that, you can do something else. You can be a stage manager. You can work on sets. You can --",

        "Lucinda: Well, that's so you would -- you would have your sports friends, and then you, also on the other hand, you have --",
        "Luke: Oh, now, you're doing it, too.",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Luke: You think that, you know, I have a much better chance of meeting a nice boy like me if I get involved with one of the plays. But, for all you know -- for all you know, there could be more gay guys involved in sports than in the drama club, and the show choir combined.",
        "Lucinda: Touch\u00e9. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely -- I'm stereotyping -- Honey, I don't want you to do anything you don't want to do. All I want is for you to be happy.",
        "Luke: You know what? I am happy. I mean, yeah, things could be better, but compared to last year, when I was walking around and hiding, just terrified of who I was. Well, compared to that, I'm on top of the world.",

        "Meg: Definitely.",
        "Jack: Well if that's the case, that doesn't help his position at all, planting the diary. He's trying to get back at the hospital, right? But the diary makes it seem like she took her own life.",

        "Jack: Well, maybe there was negligence after all. And this diary is just an attempt by someone at the hospital to cover it up.",
