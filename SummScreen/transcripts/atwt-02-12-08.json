        "Chris: Hallie's fever's down, she responding well to the medication. She's going to be okay.",
        "Gwen: Good. Can we take her home?",
        "Chris: I'd like to keep her overnight for observation, but she can go home Tomorrow.",
        "Gwen: Why Tomorrow? Come on.",
        "Chris: It's just one more day and then she's all yours.",
        "Gwen: I know, I'm sorry, it's just that we almost lost her. It's kind of hard.",
        "Will: She's safe now that Sofie's behind bars.",
        "Chris: Now that Hallie's out of the woods, what do you intend to do about Sofie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I don't want to see him.",
        "Aaron: Sofie, hear me out.",
        "Sofie: We have nothing to say to each other. Let's go.",
        "Cop #3: You really want to go back down to the holding?",
        "Aaron: Talk to me, come on.",
        "Sofie: What do you want?",
        "Aaron: Are you okay? Do you need anything?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, you've done enough.",
        "Aaron: Listen, I'm gonna hire a lawyer, okay? So we can schedule a bail hearing. Get you out of here by today. I asked my dad, he's going to loan me some money.",
        "Sofie: No, I don't want your money. I don't want your help.",
        "Aaron: Sofie --",
        "Sofie: All I want is for you to get out of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I've been so worried about Hallie, I didn't even think about Sofie.",
        "Will: She kidnapped Hallie.",
        "Chris: Well, she brought Hallie home and got her the medical attention she needed.",
        "Will: So what?",
        "Chris: Maybe you shouldn't be so hard on her.",
        "Will: It's none of your business.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, look, we're obviously still very freaked out about what Sofie did to us.",
        "Will: She belongs in jail.",
        "Chris: Well, I think there's another side to Sofie's story and you need to hear it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Casey: Matt.",
        "Matt: Hey, Man. You got the money?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I got it. You can have it today.",
        "Matt: All right. I am hanging out over at a place called Yo's.",
        "Casey: Are you going to be there for awhile?",
        "Matt: Uh, I don't have all day. And I really need that money.",
        "Casey: Chill. I'll head over and drop it off in a few. Hey, Alison, what's up?",
        "Alison: Hey. Hallie was admitted to the hospital last night.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I heard. Have you talked to Will and Gwen about it?",
        "Alison: Uh, not yet, but I'm gonna head over there now and see if they need anything. I'm sure they're just really fried after everything they've been through with Hallie's kidnapping.",
        "Casey: Yeah. How is the kid doing?",
        "Alison: She's better. Thank God.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Why don't you come with me, see for yourself?",
        "Casey: Uh, sorry. I can't. But tell them I'm glad the baby's okay. Okay?",
        "Alison: Wait, wait, wait. You can't take five minutes out of your day to check on your friend's baby? What's up with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's good to be home, isn't it?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Jack: That arraignment went fast. Tom's experience is really gonna pay off. I have this feeling that he's gonna get the charges dropped in no time.",
        "Carly: And then you'll go back to normal things -- like hockey practice and homework, taking out the garbage.",
        "Parker: You think things are gonna be normal? Mom, I just spent the night in jail.",
        "Carly: You must be starving. I'll get you something to eat, okay?",
        "Parker: I'm going to go take a shower.",
        "Carly: Okay. What are we gonna do?",
        "Jack: He just needs time.",
        "Carly: He told us, Jack. He told us that Sam was a liar, that we shouldn't trust him. But I didn't believe. Why didn't I believe in him?",
        "Jack: Everything's going to be okay, Carly.",
        "Carly: No, you know, you don't know that. I'm the mother. I'm supposed to be able to fix this, and I can't.",
        "Jack: So I called school, and I let them know that you weren't going to be in today. And that J.J. was going to pick up your homework assignments.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Carly: Hey. You know, we've been through bad stuff before.",
        "Parker: Not this bad.",
        "Jack: I'll call Tom. And we'll get a strategy together for how we're going to help you, all right?",
        "Parker: Good luck with that.",
        "Carly: Parker, don't be so negative, Honey. No one is going to punish you for saving me.",
        "Parker: Wanna bet?",
        "Jack: Parker, we are doing everything we can to protect you. You know that, right?",
        "Parker: It's too late. Sam's dead. I killed him.",
        "Jack: Okay, we are going through all the formalities because we have to. But in the end, everyone will understand that you did this to help your mom.",
        "Parker: What if they don't?",
        "Carly: Hey. Look at me. You saved me from a horrible man. No one will punish you for that.",
        "Kit: Well, ain't this sweet? I hate to interrupt family time, but now I get my say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You caught me at a bad time.",
        "Alison: Casey, your best friend's baby was just kidnapped.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know that, but she's back now. I'll call them later.",
        "Alison: You're not dressed for work, so it can't be that.",
        "Casey: Are you a detective now?",
        "Alison: Okay, if you don't want to tell me, fine, no problem. I'll just tell Will and Gwen you were too busy to see their sick kid.",
        "Casey: Oh, come on, give me a break.",
        "Alison: You give them a break. Now would be a good time to show that you're still a friend. I mean, unless you don't feel that way.",
        "Casey: You don't know how I feel. Besides, I don't want to bother them. If they've got a sick kid on their hands, the last thing they need is me hanging around.",
        "Alison: Okay. Whatever. I get it, you're busy, you got a lot of stuff to do. Don't let me stop you.",
        "Casey: No, no, no. You can't guilt me into this.",
        "Alison: Don't worry. I'll tell them you had important plans you couldn't break.",
        "Casey: You're something else. Okay. I'll go with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You could give Sofie a break. You could influence the judge, maybe get her some leniency.",
        "Will: Look, there's no excuse for kidnapping. Gwen's a mom too, but I guess that doesn't count.",
        "Gwen: Listen, we just, we haven't had a chance to talk this over yet. We can't answer these questions right now. I'm sorry.",
        "Chris: Yeah, you're right. You're right, I'm sorry guys. I'll check on Hallie later.",
        "Will: What's his problem?",
        "Gwen: Sofie reached out to him, he probably feels a certain level of responsibility to her.",
        "Will: Well, I'm his cousin, I think family should count for something.",
        "Gwen: Well, we can figure that out later.",
        "Will: There's no way I'm letting Sofie get away with what she's done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie, I know you don't want to talk to me, but I'm only trying to help. You should know that by now.",
        "Sofie: All I know is that you let me down.",
        "Aaron: So I'm still going to hire a lawyer to get you out of here. You don't deserve to be in jail.",
        "Sofie: You know, I wouldn't even be in jail if it weren't for you. You told Gwen and Will where I was.",
        "Aaron: I thought you were leaving the country. I only did it because I was concerned about you and Hallie.",
        "Sofie: Now I lost everything because of you. The last thing I want is your help. I'll get out of this on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Maybe a little sugar will sweeten you up.",
        "Vienna: Not only were you gambling yesterday, you were dreaming about it and I do not approve. If anything, you should be dreaming about me, not some inside straight with deuces wild.",
        "Henry: I know, I know, I know, Leibshin. How can I make it up to you? I know you want me to. How bout if I find that special little place that drives you crazy? Wow. It get chilly in here, or is it just me?",
        "Vienna: No, it won't work, Henry.",
        "Henry: What? What won't work? Give me a chance here, Honey. Come on.",
        "Vienna: Why should I? If I give you anything, you just gamble it away.",
        "Henry: No, that's not true. Let's, let's start over here. All right? What do you say that we, uh, you know that --",
        "Vienna: No! Forget it, Henry. You know what? No more sex as long as you're gambling!",
        "Henry: But I'm not.",
        "Vienna: Better yet, no more sex as long as you're thinking or dreaming about gambling!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: Sam's dead and you didn't even call me, Carly?",
        "Carly: I am so sorry.",
        "Kit: I'm out on the road and I get call from a cop telling me my Sam is dead. Do you have any idea how that made me feel?",
        "Carly: I know. It's awful. It is.",
        "Kit: Yeah. It is. 'Cause your Parker killed my Sam.",
        "Jack: Hey, you need to calm down.",
        "Carly: Kit.",
        "Kit: Don't you tell me what to do.",
        "Carly: There are things about Sam that you don't know.",
        "Kit: Oh, like what? He's dead, Carly. He's dead! What else is there to say?",
        "Jack: I mean it, back off, Kit.",
        "Kit: Oh, like your boy? Did he back off when he blew Sam away?",
        "Carly: Hey! He said stop it.",
        "Kit: Yeah, he should have been locked up the minute he started spreading rumors about Sam. He's a murderer.",
        "Jack: All right, that's it. You got to go. Now.",
        "Kit: Sam loved me. All he wanted to do was make people happy, and your son goes and kills him.",
        "Carly: This is not Parker's fault. This is Sam's fault! He's dead, Kit, because he tried to rape me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey. I got here as soon as I got your message. So much for quality family time last night, huh?",
        "Margo: Yeah, no kidding. It's gonna take a while before we can reschedule.",
        "Tom: What's that?",
        "Margo: Parker. Tom, the D.A. wants to charge him as an adult.",
        "Tom: You can't be serious. He's a kid.",
        "Margo: I know. Legally, he meets the criteria to be tried as an adult. And the D.A. wants to present it as murder one, premeditation.",
        "Tom: Well, the D.A. is making a mistake. He was protecting his mother.",
        "Margo: He got the gun before he knew Carly was in trouble.",
        "Tom: Hey. You're taking the wrong tackle on this.",
        "Margo: This is not my call. I present the evidence, the D.A. runs with it.",
        "Tom: Then you use your influence to help Jack. He's one of your best friends. You've known Parker his entire life.",
        "Margo: I would do anything for Jack or anyone in his family. There's a pattern of behavior here. Parker has been acting out against Sam for some time now. I mean, he stole his dummy, he set it on fire.",
        "Tom: You only know that because Jack confided in you.",
        "Margo: If the D.A. wants to try him as an adult, there is nothing I can do about it.",
        "Tom: Well then you better know, I'm going to fight ya on this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: You're a liar. Sam ain't no rapist. You led him on.",
        "Jack: That's it, you got to go.",
        "Kit: Get your hands off me!",
        "Carly: He attacked me, Kit.",
        "Kit: Oh, you've always been so jealous of me and Sam. So Parker goes and kills him so you and Jack can get --",
        "Jack: Sam tried to force himself on Carly! Parker stopped him!",
        "Kit: Oh, that's bull! Your son is a cold-blooded murderer. I'm gonna make sure they throw the book at you, Kid! They're going to lock you up and throw away the key!",
        "Jack: Get out! Get out! Get out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: How can I control what I'm dreaming about?",
        "Vienna: No, I would prefer if you were dreaming about me.",
        "Henry: I do, I do. I dream about you all the time. One of my favorite recurring dreams is with you playing the star forward on O.U.'s women's basketball team. I mean, the hoops I go through for you.",
        "Vienna: You're dreaming about me and other women?",
        "Henry: Well, I think they're the cheerleaders, actually. They're cheering for us. They're saying, \"Go, Henry, go Vienna, all the way. Rah, rah, rah! Sis- boom-bah!\" You know?",
        "Vienna: You know what? This is even worse than I thought it was. Not only are you gambling in your sleep, but you're unfaithful to me in your dreams.",
        "Henry: Vienna, Honey, Honey, Honey, Honey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie, we're friends. Can't we work this out?",
        "Sofie: There's nothing left to say.",
        "Aaron: Well, if you need anything, you can call me. Hey, Chris. Sofie won't let me hire a lawyer or help her fight the kidnapping charges, so maybe -- if you're heading in there, maybe she'll listen to you.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I'll see what I can do.",
        "Aaron: Okay, great. Thanks, man.",
        "Chris: Yeah, yeah. Sofie?",
        "Sofie: How's Hallie?",
        "Chris: She had an infection, but I gave her some antibiotics. She's going home tomorrow.",
        "Sofie: Home. I'm glad she's okay.",
        "Chris: I didn't come here to talk about Hallie. I'm here because I'm worried about you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey! What are you -- what is all this? You have to stop spending all your money on Hallie.",
        "Alison: How is she?",
        "Gwen: She's doing a lot better.",
        "Will: Thanks for coming by, man.",
        "Casey: I thought you could use all the friends you could get.",
        "Will: Yeah, tell me about it.",
        "Casey: Pretty rough, huh? [Cell phone ringing] Sorry about this, Guys. Hey.",
        "Matt: You get lost?",
        "Casey: Not exactly.",
        "Matt: I've been waiting. If you don't have the money, just tell me, straight up.",
        "Casey: No, I got it. I had to stop at the hospital to check on a friend.",
        "Matt: Are you done?",
        "Casey: I just got here. I said I will meet you, and I will. Hang tight.",
        "Matt: This is not cool, Casey.",
        "Alison: What the hell are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I think there's a reason why you took Hallie.",
        "Sofie: There is. I wanted my baby, and Will and Gwen wouldn't let me see her. I never should have given her up.",
        "Chris: Did your doctor talk you about post-partum depression?",
        "Sofie: No.",
        "Chris: It's a very real condition. Your doctor should have told you.",
        "Sofie: Well, I don't have my baby, so it doesn't matter.",
        "Chris: Yes, Sofie, it does. It's affecting you more than you realize. Remember -- remember when we first met at the hospital? I could tell you were sad.",
        "Sofie: I lost my baby. Of course, I was sad.",
        "Chris: No, but post-partum depression is a very real condition. You could lose sleep. And it can affect you when you're trying to make rational decisions.",
        "Sofie: Like deciding to kidnap my daughter? I knew what I was doing, and I don't need a medical condition to justify it.",
        "Chris: I'd be willing to testify for you. And a judge would probably only give you probation if you got yourself into some sort of treatment program.",
        "Sofie: Look, I appreciate that you are trying to be nice to me, but I didn't ask for your help, and I don't want it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Why are you getting in my face?",
        "Alison: You don't just waltz into a hospital, visit your friend's sick baby, and then answer your phone the minute it rings. It's rude.",
        "Casey: No, it's none of your business what I do. I told you I had plans, and I forgot to cancel them. You don't have to jump down my throat.",
        "Alison: Okay, I didn't realize this would be such an imposition for you.",
        "Casey: No, no, what's with you? I already have one mother. I don't need another one.",
        "Alison: I shouldn't have invited you here.",
        "Matt: Hey, Hughes!",
        "Casey: Matt! I didn't expect to see you here. What's up?",
        "Matt: Hi, there. You don't look sick.",
        "Alison: I'm not.",
        "Matt: Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? I'm Matt.",
        "Alison: Hi, I'm Alison. I used to be Casey's friend. I won't keep you.",
        "Matt: You move fast, Man. Good going.",
        "Casey: You should not have come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Kit's got a big mouth. She's can't do anything to you.",
        "Parker: You don't know that.",
        "Carly: She wasn't there, Honey. She didn't see Sam attacking me.",
        "Jack: Parker, she was just mouthing off. Nothing -- nothing she says matters. Nothing.",
        "[Doorbell ringing]",
        "Tom: Hey, sorry to drop by unannounced.",
        "Jack: Is there news?",
        "Tom: Parker, I'd really like to talk to your parents privately.",
        "Carly: Parker, take your plate to the kitchen, okay? Tom? What is it?",
        "Tom: The D.A. is thinking about trying Parker as an adult.",
        "Jack: What?! Can't Margo do something?",
        "Carly: What exactly does that mean?",
        "Tom: If Parker's convicted, we're looking at 20 to life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: This just came from forensics.",
        "Margo: Are they sure about this?",
        "Cop: Absolutely.",
        "Margo: Well, this definitely complicates things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Go talk to Tom, Jack. I'll be right there.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Parker: I'm okay.",
        "Carly: You don't have to be so brave, you know.",
        "Parker: I want to hear what Tom has to say.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Tom: Jack, Margo's gotta do this by the book.",
        "Jack: Well, can't she speak to the D.A.? Isn't she on our side here?",
        "Parker: I heard what you told my parents.",
        "Tom: Yeah, Parker, I'm going to do everything I can to fight that, but I did want to let your parents know so there weren't anymore surprises.",
        "[Doorbell ringing]",
        "Jack: Excuse me. Margo.",
        "Margo: I am so sorry to intrude, but I have to go over a few things with Parker.",
        "Jack: You covered the bases last night.",
        "Margo: I know, but I have a few more questions.",
        "Carly: Tom told us about the D.A.'s plan.",
        "Margo: It's a tough situation, but nothing's written in stone yet.",
        "Jack: So why are you here?",
        "Margo: I want to take Parker to Metro. I have to clarify a few details.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, no. No, he does not need to go through this again. Do we have to do that, Tom?",
        "Tom: Your son is a suspect in a murder investigation. I highly recommend that you cooperate at this point.",
        "Jack: Can't we do this at the station?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Parker: I -- I don't want to go back there.",
        "Carly: Then you don't have to, Honey.",
        "Jack: Carly, maybe we should do what Margo wants. Maybe this will help Parker.",
        "Carly: He just got home, Jack. He's exhausted.",
        "Margo: We should go over the details while they're still fresh in his mind.",
        "Jack: I'll be right there with Parker.",
        "Carly: I don't like this. This feels like some kind of set-up, Jack.",
        "Jack: Let Parker walk through it, and then maybe Margo will wake up and realize that Parker shouldn't be charged with a crime at all.",

        "Will: Okay.",
        "Chris: I think Sofie's suffering from post-partum depression. She needs to be checked out by a doctor.",
        "Will: You're a doctor.",
        "Chris: She needs a psychiatrist. You know what? I know what she did to you was a terrible thing, and you have every right to be upset, but I'm asking you. Could you just consider giving her a break? If you don't, I'm afraid of what's going to happen to her.",

        "Will: I still don't see why we should give her a break.",
        "Gwen: She brought Hallie back. She deserves credit for doing that.",
        "Will: The only reason Sofie came back was 'cause she didn't have any money. She had a plane ticket that Aaron bought for her, but if she had money, we might never have seen Hallie again.",
        "Gwen: But she didn't. She came back. How can you tell your daughter that you put your birth mother in jail?",
        "Will: Sofie belongs in jail. She kidnapped Hallie.",
        "Gwen: We did the same thing when we ran away with Johnny. I think that she deserves another chance, especially if she's suffering from post-partum. Come on.",

        "Carly: I'm not going to calm down! She won't even take my statement. I was almost raped for God's sakes! If she'd listen to what happened here, she wouldn't push it this far! You cannot do this to my son!",

        "Gwen: No, no, no. You guys have already done way too much. And just thank you so much for coming. Really, you're the best.",

Look, I'll be honest with you, I have been dreaming about beautiful women since I was old enough to suck my thumb. Look what it got me. It got me you. You are all my dreams come true. I -- this is going to sound very corny -- whenever I thought about loving someone so beautiful and so perfect, I thought it was going to be just a fantasy, yet here you are. And I can't help myself, Sweetheart. I think about you. I dream about you every day and every night.",
        "Vienna: You do love me. Don't you, Henry?",

        "Margo: Okay, Parker, do you remember holding the gun? Can you show me?",
        "Parker: He was on top of her, he was pulling at her clothes, he was kissing her, but then he sat up for a second. And I pulled the trigger and he dropped. I heard him hit the floor.",
        "Margo: All right, thanks. I know this is really hard for you. You're doing a good job. I need you to be very clear with me now. How many times did you shoot Sam?",

        "Carly: Why won't she let me make a statement? The man was attacking me.",
        "Tom: Margo has to establish a timeline. She will hear your side of things. Parker, why didn't you say anything to anyone about Sam's threats before this happened?",
        "Parker: I did! No one believed me.",

        "Alison: Yeah, you did act kind of weird the other day when you didn't want to hold her.",
        "Casey: Well, it was a lot to take in at once. Our lives just went in different directions.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, I apologize. I didn't mean to push you, and I think sometimes I need to think before I speak a little more.",

        "Tom: Then do something about it.",
        "Margo: Well, Hal would play this by the book. So, my report stands. Parker is known as a troubled teen. He broke into a locked cabinet, he took a gun, he went to Metro, he shot and killed a man.",
        "Tom: He was protecting his mother. Get Carly's statement on record. She's a victim, too.",
        "Margo: Honey, there's no way that Parker could have known that Sam was trying to rape Carly. This has premeditation written all over it.",

        "Carly: Okay. 20 years to life? How can they even consider doing that to him?",
        "Jack: I'm just as scared as you are. I'm a cop. If I can't protect my own son, what's the point?",
