        "Tom: You know, I could've dropped your bags off at the house. You do remember home, don't you?",
        "Margo: Yeah, that place where we never see each other?",
        "Tom: Yeah, that's the one. So why did you have to get back to the station so quickly?",
        "Margo: Well, you know, you're gone one night, a lot of things can happen.",
        "Cop: Lieutenant?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Oh, thanks, Malone. Oh, man. See? Less than 24 hours. Malone? Cause of death?",
        "Cop: Forensics has to confirm, but it looks like an overdose.",
        "Tom: Hey, don't keep me in suspense. What happened?",
        "Margo: It's a college kid, honors students, he collapsed at a party. Died at the hospital. He's Casey's age.",
        "Tom: Oh, my God.",
        "Margo: Yeah, so, I've got to get right -- right on this one.",
        "Tom: So have the parents been notified?",
        "Margo: Yeah, thank God I missed the fun parts. I just got this guilty feeling of relief that it wasn't Casey, you know?",
        "Tom: It's only human.",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Tom: Why don't I go check on him?",
        "Margo: Oh, thank you.",
        "Tom: Listen.",
        "Margo: Yeah?",
        "Tom: Don't work too hard.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Cop: Lieutenant, there's one more thing you should know about the victim. He was at your son's birthday party last night.",
        "Margo: What birthday party? What -- don't. This day's already getting off to a great start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Casey groaning]",
        "Casey: Oh, man.",
        "Jade: Casey?",
        "Casey: Jade? This is weird.",
        "Jade: Yeah, tell me about it.",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Casey: Oh, God, be there in a second!",
        "Luke: Casey? Jade, I -- I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Jade: Yeah, and from the look on Casey's face, I don't think he did either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, Alison, hey. Uh, can I talk to you a minute?",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, I'm kind of busy, but what's up?",
        "Margo: Did you know that Casey had a birthday party last night?",
        "Alison: Uh, yeah, some of his friends threw it for him last minute.",
        "Margo: Did you -- did you go?",
        "Alison: It kind of worked out that way. But I mean I didn't even know the party was happening until I was there, so, why?",
        "Margo: Did you know that one of the kids died as a result of an apparent overdose?",
        "Alison: Uh, I had heard someone got sick last night, but I didn't --",
        "Margo: Yeah, it was Reg Addington. Did you know him?",
        "Alison: Oh, my God -- yeah, he worked on Luke's campaign. Reg was a good guy.",
        "Margo: Did you ever know that he had any drug usage past?",
        "Alison: No, I don't think so. I mean, I didn't really know him.",
        "Margo: How about any of the other kids at the party? Did you ever see them using?",
        "Alison: Margo, I don't do drugs anymore and I stay away from people who do.",
        "Margo: I know, I'm sorry, it's just I thought, you know, with your past as an addict, you might recognize the behavior --",
        "Alison: You know, if you're trying to pin this on me in some way, just forget it. There is nothing going on between me and Casey, so you don't have to lock me up to get rid of me.",

        "Carly: Hi!",
        "Craig: Hi.",
        "Carly: Perfect timing. Come on in. I have something to show you.",
        "Craig: Something good, I hope.",
        "Carly: Yes, I have been working on some designs.",
        "Craig: Oh, looks like you've been busy.",
        "Carly: It's a simple concept, really. Midnight Sun, the vodka lover's vodka.",
        "Craig: I like it.",
        "Carly: You do, really?",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah. Lines are clean. It's smooth. It's sensual. It's just what we're looking for.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, let's hope the distributor likes it. Has Ari sent the contracts yet, by the way? Or better yet, has he sent the money?",
        "Craig: Well, first rule of business. Never count your money until the check clears.",
        "Carly: Is there a problem, Craig?",
        "Craig: It's just a minor setback.",
        "Carly: How minor?",
        "Craig: The kind of minor where the deal fell through because Ari pulled out.",
        "Carly: That's sounds pretty major to me, actually.",
        "Craig: No, it's not bad as it sounds.",
        "Carly: It's not bad? It's awful! It's terrible! How could this have happened?",
        "Craig: Well, who knows? Credit is tight. Maybe he got turned down for a loan. Maybe his wife wants a house in Palm Beach. It's business. You can't take it personally.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry, but I think I have to take it personally when I can't put food on my table.",
        "Craig: Don't worry. Don't panic. You're in good hands. I've already set up a meeting with another distributor in New York.",
        "Carly: For when?",
        "Craig: Later this morning. So you'd better get dressed.",
        "Carly: No, Craig, I can't just drop everything and run out of town. I have to make arrangements for the kids, you know? I have to work things with Jack.",
        "Craig: Well, then, do it fast. Because this deal is too big to let it slip away.",
        "Carly: No, I'm sorry. I'm not going to let you coerce me into running off with you.",
        "Craig: It's a business meeting, not a honeymoon. Now we are this close to making a fortune together. Are you with me or not?",
        "Carly: No, Craig. I'm not going to let you put me in this position.",
        "Craig: You mean, on the road to untold riches?",
        "Carly: I'm a mom, you know? I cannot phone that in from New York.",
        "Craig: It's one meeting. We'll fly there and back today. I have my jet waiting for us.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. With champagne chilling onboard, no doubt.",
        "Craig: In case we need to celebrate.",
        "Carly: No, I'm sorry. I draw the line at deserting my children with absolutely no warning.",
        "Craig: You'll only be gone while they're in school. Now why don't you go on, put on one of those knockout dresses from the Carly Tenney design collection, fix your lipstick, and let's get going.",
        "Carly: Okay. But only if I'm back by the time Sage gets home.",
        "Craig: All right, if you insist.",
        "Carly: I'm serious. Last time you made me miss her play.",
        "Craig: You'll be back by the time the school bus pulls up to the curb. I promise.",
        "Carly: Well, I think for you, promises are made to be broken.",
        "Craig: This from the woman who broke off our wedding.",
        "Carly: We're business partners, Craig. Business partners and that's it.",
        "Craig: And as business partners, we owe each other a certain amount of loyalty.",
        "Carly: Well, you think that I'm being disloyal because I choose to put my family first? And what do you know about this new distributor anyway? How do you know he's on the up and up? How do you know he's not part of the mob, for example?",
        "Craig: His name is Harry Siegler. He made a fortune producing a circus. Strictly family entertainment. His clowns weren't connected, as far as I know.",
        "Carly: Funny.",
        "Craig: He's a legitimate businessman. He got where he is by taking risks. Which is what we should do.",
        "Carly: Well, there are risks and there are risks.",
        "Craig: Come on, where is the -- the take-no-prisoners Carly? The woman that I knew that wouldn't let anyone or anything stand in her way!",
        "Carly: Well, she doesn't know what she wants.",
        "Craig: Yes, she does. This is what she wants. Her dazzling design on the back of every glossy magazine in the country. Her vodka lover's vodka being served in every watering hole from Hong Kong to Reykjavik.",
        "Carly: I think you're right. That is what I want.",
        "Craig: That's right. And how bad do you want it?",
        "Carly: Oh, I want it a lot.",
        "Craig: Well, then what are you waiting for? Let's go get you rich!",
        "Carly: Okay! All right. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What are you guys doing here anyway?",
        "Noah: We came to see your mom, actually.",
        "Casey: Well, she's not here.",
        "Luke: Obviously.",
        "Casey: My head hurts.",
        "Jade: Yeah, we both need some aspirin.",
        "Luke: Case -- Casey, where's your mom?",
        "Casey: She and my dad went out of town last night.",
        "Jade: Oh, lucky for us. Here, take this. It'll make you feel better.",
        "Casey: I'm not sure anything's going to make me feel better right now.",
        "Luke: You guys were pretty wasted.",
        "Casey: We took a lot of shots last night. Come on, it was my birthday!",
        "Luke: Is that all you did?",
        "Jade: Yeah, what else?",
        "Luke: Well, we noticed some drug activity at the bar last night.",
        "Casey: Is that why Reg passed out?",
        "Noah: Reg died.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Luke: We went to the hospital and the doctor said they're wasn't anything they could do. They think he OD'd.",
        "Jade: Oh my God.",
        "Casey: I thought he was just hammered, you know, on booze --",
        "Luke: No. Whatever it was, it was more than booze. And we think we know who gave it to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Alison, you have a problem answering my questions?",
        "Alison: I wasn't aware of any drug activity, okay? I don't know why you're treating me like a suspect?",
        "Margo: I don't know why you're being so paranoid?",
        "Alison: I'm not even hanging out with Casey anymore.",
        "Margo: But you were at his birthday party, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah, but -- it's not like I'm interested in him or anything.",
        "Margo: All right, fine. This has nothing to do with your non-relationship with Casey.",
        "Alison: Then why are you grilling me?",
        "Margo: Because I am investigating the drug-related death of a young man who died at my son's birthday party.",
        "Alison: But I wasn't even there when it happened.",
        "Margo: You were at the birthday party. I would appreciate your cooperation.",
        "Matt: Hey, Alison. Lieutenant Hughes, long time no see.",
        "Margo: Matt O'Connor? I didn't know that --",
        "Matt: Oh, I got an early release from Statesville -- for good behavior.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, I guess that paperwork just slid right by me. You look good -- considering.",
        "Matt: I can't complain. I probably should've checked in with you when I came back to town.",
        "Margo: That would've been smart.",
        "Matt: Then, I guess you should know I'm planning on sticking around. And I have a part-time job. I hope that's cool.",
        "Margo: As long as it's good, honest work.",
        "Matt: It is. I'm staying out of trouble. Trying to get my act together.",
        "Margo: Have you seen Casey since you've been back?",
        "Matt: Yeah, we've run into each other. And I've been hanging out with Alison.",
        "Margo: Oh, I see. All right. Okay, okay --",
        "Alison: I mean, just as friends.",
        "Margo: No, it's not against the law, Alison.",
        "Matt: I couldn't help but hear what you guys said before -- about somebody OD'ing at Casey's party.",
        "Margo: Yes, Reg Addington. Did you know him?",
        "Matt: No. But I was there last night working. I have a part-time job bartending at Yo's. I gave my statement to the police. But I'll keep my eyes open.",
        "Margo: That would be appreciated.",
        "Matt: It's the least I can do. I owe you a lot.",
        "Margo: That's true. So, we'll be in touch then. Alison.",
        "Alison: That was loads of fun.",
        "Matt: She's a cop. She has to be tough sometimes.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, running into her was the last thing I needed today.",
        "Matt: You seem kind of stressed.",
        "Alison: It's just -- it was a rough night. I just have a lot on my mind.",
        "Matt: You mean Casey?",
        "Alison: Can we not talk about it, please?",
        "Matt: Sure, sure. I just stopped by to see if you want to go for a power walk in the park. You know, when you're on your break.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess I could use some fresh air and exercise. Can I meet you later?",
        "Matt: Absolutely. It's a date.",
        "Alison: Thank you. You're a good friend, Matt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: This never should have happened. Reg was a really good guy.",
        "Noah: I just -- I couldn't believe it when they told us he was dead.",
        "Casey: It doesn't make sense. I never even thought he was using.",
        "Luke: Well, we think it might have been a setup. We found these in Reg's coat pocket.",
        "Casey: Did you tell the police?",
        "Noah: Well, that's why we came here to talk to your mom.",
        "Luke: We think Elwood gave Reg the drugs.",
        "Noah: Well, we don't know that for sure.",
        "Luke: Noah, we saw them together outside the bar, right before Reg collapsed.",
        "Jade: Elwood. That's the guy that Casey beat up last night, right?",
        "Casey: Yeah, he deserved it. He tried to set me up for grand larceny. If he'd gotten away with it, I would be at Statesville right now.",
        "Luke: Which is exactly where Elwood should be if he gave Reg those pills.",
        "Noah: Look, we can't prove that.",
        "Casey: I'll make sure my mom gets this.",
        "Noah: That is our only evidence, so --",
        "Casey: Well, if you didn't see the drugs change hands, it might not be enough.",
        "Luke: Well, we have to make Elwood pay for what he did.",
        "Casey: Maybe I can help.",
        "Noah: Um, how?",
        "Casey: After what he did to me, let's just say, I'll return the favor.",
        "Noah: Whatever you do, you have to make sure that it's -- legal.",
        "Luke: What are you doing?",
        "Casey: Wait. It's voicemail. Hey, Elwood, it's Casey. I'm sorry about last night. I was hoping we could meet in the park on the west side? I need a favor, it's kind of urgent. Thanks.",
        "Luke: So what's the plan? Are you going to catch Elwood dealing?",
        "Casey: I'll set everything up. You just make sure the cops come.",
        "Luke: Are you sure this is going to work?",
        "Casey: Don't worry about it, man. I got it all covered.",
        "Jade: Look, Casey, just because your mom's a cop, doesn't mean you have a badge too, okay? Are you sure you want to get involved?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Elwood and I have a score to settle.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Okay, this is it.",
        "Carly: It's a pretty classy address. I was expecting a big top with peanut shells on the floor.",
        "Craig: Siegler's circus days are behind him. He's a real mover and shaker now.",
        "Carly: Well, he's about to meet his match.",
        "Craig: You seem pretty confident.",
        "Carly: Why do you think I wore this outfit?",
        "Craig: Well, it does accentuate the positive.",
        "Carly: Thank you. And how about my lipstick? Too much? Not enough?",
        "Craig: Just right.",
        "Carly: Good. Because I'm not going to give this guy a chance to say no. Mr. Three-ring-circus won't know what hit him!",
        "Craig: Now that's the Carly I know and love! Let's do this.",
        "Craig: You nailed it!",
        "Carly: I hope so!",
        "Craig: Are you kidding? You had Siegler in the palm of your hand! I could almost hear his heart pounding.",
        "Carly: He did seem pretty excited, didn't he?",
        "Craig: Yeah, he's just a little bit smitten.",
        "Carly: I want this deal to happen, I really do. But I am not going to count on it.",
        "Craig: You know what? I don't think we're going to have to worry.",
        "Carly: That's what you said last time.",
        "Craig: Carly, you're a winner. Give yourself some credit.",
        "Carly: I did do a pretty good job, didn't I?",
        "Craig: You were awesome! Well, that's it, we have to celebrate. Come on, let me buy you lunch.",
        "Carly: No! No, Craig we don't have time. We have to get back.",
        "Craig: Are you ever going to trust me?",
        "Carly: Probably not.",
        "Craig: We're in New York. The city with the world's finest restaurants. It's just lunch!",
        "Carly: No, Craig, you promised that you'd have me back before school gets out.",
        "Craig: And I will, if you quit stalling, and get in the car. Come on, you're going to love this place. The food is great, and the vodka's not bad either.",
        "Carly: Oh, what have you got up your sleeve?",
        "Craig: Just trust me. You won't regret it.",
        "Carly: Oh, I regret it already. What else is new?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Matt, what're you doing here?",
        "Matt: I could ask you the same question.",
        "Casey: I'm waiting for somebody.",
        "Matt: Who?",
        "Casey: The guy I got into a fight with last night.",
        "Matt: Well, you messed him up pretty good. You sure he's going to be able to make it?",
        "Casey: I don't know, but if he doesn't, I'm going to hunt him down. I think he's dealing drugs. A friend of ours OD'd.",
        "Matt: Yeah, I heard. I'm sorry, man. That really bites.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it does. And if Elwood's responsible, he's going to pay.",
        "Matt: I sorry we couldn't do anything to stop it.",
        "Casey: Well, I'm doing something now.",
        "Matt: What are you up to, Case?",
        "Casey: I'm going to set a trap. If he sold those drugs that killed Reg, I need to know.",
        "Matt: Do you want me to stick around and back you up?",
        "Casey: No, no. I've got it covered, okay?",
        "Matt: Are you sure man?",
        "Casey: Yes, yeah, yes I'm good, man.",
        "Matt: Okay. Good luck.",

        "Margo: Hi! What's up?",
        "Tom: Hey baby, we've got a problem at the house.",
        "Margo: What's going on?",
        "Tom: Looks like Casey's been a busy boy.",
        "Margo: I'm not going to like this, am I?",
        "Tom: I doubt it.",
        "Margo: I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Jade, why did you sleep with Casey?",
        "Jade: Why not? He's hot, okay? He's a big boy. He's 21. All nice and legal.",
        "Luke: So you like -- gave him the ultimate birthday present?",
        "Jade: I don't get what the problem is, okay? It's not like I hit him over the head and forced him into bed with me.",
        "Luke: You didn't even make it into bed.",
        "Jade: So? We were in a hurry.",
        "Luke: Jade, how many times have we talked about you waiting to find the right guy?",
        "Jade: Why can't Casey be the right guy?",
        "Luke: Oh, come on! The whole point of last night is so that he would end up with Alison.",
        "Jade: Well, Alison made it very clear, she wants nothing to do with him.",
        "Luke: Look Jade, I know what you're doing. You throwing yourself at Casey to get over that Robby guy who almost got you thrown in jail.",
        "Jade: What are you, my therapist now?",
        "Luke: No, but you don't have any real feelings for Casey. Come on Jade, when are you going to grow up and get a real relationship?",
        "Jade: Not everyone can be as perfect as you, Luke. Look, Casey's not perfect either. Maybe that's why he's the right guy for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elwood: Hey, Casey.",
        "Casey: Hey. You looking for somebody?",
        "Elwood: Well, I just wanted to know why you wanted to meet in the park. Did you bring a bunch of friends so you could all jump me at once?",
        "Casey: Look, I know you hate my guts, but I wanted to say I'm sorry.",
        "Elwood: Well, it was awesome being your punching bag, but apology not accepted.",
        "Casey: Come on, man, we used to be friends.",
        "Elwood: Until you got me in trouble, big time, with my parents. I almost got thrown out of school because of you!",
        "Casey: I almost got sent back to jail because you planted those stolen goods on me. So let's just call it even.",
        "Elwood: Whatever. I don't need this.",
        "Casey: No, look -- hey. While you were inside man, I've been having a rough time.",
        "Elwood: Yeah, well, nothing's worse than being locked up.",
        "Casey: Yes, I know. But I've been messing up a lot lately.",
        "Elwood: Oh, so what else is new?",
        "Casey: I got kicked out of school. And I got a job as a janitor.",
        "Elwood: Oh, is this the part where I start crying?",
        "Casey: I'm not asking you to feel my pain. I'm just saying -- cleaning toilets, mopping the floor, it kind of gets to you. I need something to take off the edge, if you know what I mean?",
        "Elwood: No, I don't have a clue. What?",
        "Casey: Come on, man. We've both done time. You know the drill.",
        "Elwood: No, I don't. Why don't you enlighten me?",
        "Casey: I know you're holding. So, can you just give me some downers? Some painkillers?",
        "Elwood: What are you -- wait -- did Luke and Noah put you up to this?",
        "Casey: No, are you kidding me? They don't do drugs.",
        "Elwood: Forget this. I don't need this.",
        "Casey: Look, wait -- let me talk to you.",
        "Elwood: Get off me!",
        "Casey: I'm just asking you to help me out.",
        "Elwood: Well, help me out. Don't call me again.",
        "Matt: Hey, man --",
        "Matt: Hey, man -- did it work?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I don't know. But I put a little present in his backpack. He doesn't know it's there, but he'll find out soon enough.",
        "Matt: You planted drugs on him?",
        "Casey: He did it to me before. We'll just, say it's payback.",
        "Matt: Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: What's Casey doing here?",
        "Casey: I was just about to leave. Alison -- I'm sorry about last night. I was wasted. I shouldn't have given you a hard time.",
        "Alison: That's okay. Matt was there. And he took real good care of me.",
        "Matt: We hung out together -- at the bar. And then I took her home.",
        "Alison: Why should Casey care? I mean, he was busy with Jade.",
        "Casey: What does that mean?",
        "Alison: You took Jade home and had sex with her, right?",
        "Casey: You know what? You can have her. Knock yourself out.",

        "Carly: Where are we?",
        "Craig: Brooklyn.",
        "Carly: You brought me to Brooklyn for lunch? Why?",
        "Craig: We're not just here to have lunch. We're here to doing research -- crucial research. Shall we?",
        "Carly: I don't see why not.",
        "Carly: Didn't we already do this once before?",
        "Craig: Do what?",
        "Carly: You ply me with vodka using the old, \"We have to become experts on all things vodka\" excuse?",
        "Craig: It's true. But it is our responsibility to know our product backwards and forwards. And this place is known for its eclectic varieties. Russia, Finland, Poland, Belgium, Canada, Japan --",
        "Carly: Okay, I get it. The united nations of vodka.",
        "Craig: You ready for your first taste?",
        "Carly: Didn't you tell me that all vodkas are alike.",
        "Craig: Well, I only said that so you wouldn't be intimidated.",
        "Carly: Don't you know me well enough to know that I am not easily intimidated?",
        "Craig: Good, then won't have any problem becoming a connoisseur.",
        "Carly: Is that a fancy word for lush?",
        "Craig: To succeed in business, one must know the competition. And make no mistake, this is business, not pleasure.",
        "Carly: Oh, I wasn't sure you could tell the difference.",
        "Craig: And in order to compete, one must know the enemy. Now concentrate. This will help you develop your palate -- or at least how to fake it.",
        "Carly: Oh boy, okay. What have I got to lose?",
        "Craig: Now that's the spirit! So to speak. Nostrovia!",

        "Tom: Who else?",

        "Tom: Hmm, I don't know. Do you think that this would be a clue, Lieutenant?",
        "Margo: Woo, woo -- well, we knew that Casey's 21st birthday was going to be a big blowout. But you said trust him. You said he's an adult. You were wrong!",
        "Tom: Yes, Sweetheart, I should've listened to you.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, he's a big boy now.",
        "Tom: Look, I know its small comfort, but at least we know its Alison, not Emily.",
        "Margo: Wrong again, Counselor. Alison just told me that she and Casey aren't seeing each other anymore.",
        "Tom: True? Then who's has the bad taste in underwear?",
        "Margo: I don't know. But I think she likes to party.",
        "Tom: I guess he figured we were out of town, it's his big celebration, what the heck?",
        "Margo: Tom, the kid who OD'd last night? He was at Casey's party.",
        "Tom: Tell me you're kidding.",
        "Margo: Oh, I wish I was. Casey cannot be hanging out with kids who are doing drugs -- I mean, not while he's on parole. Not even if he's not on parole.",
        "Tom: I'll try to find him, see if I can straighten him out.",

        "Matt: Do you want to talk about it?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Matt: When you came back to Yo's last night, you didn't say much. But obviously something happened when you went to check on Casey.",
        "Alison: I saw Casey with Jade. They looked like they didn't want to be interrupted.",
        "Matt: I'm sorry you had to see that. Why didn't you tell me last night?",
        "Alison: I felt like such an idiot.",
        "Matt: It's not your fault, you know.",
        "Alison: Sure it is. I kept telling Casey that there was no chance for us. So if he decides he wants to be with someone else, I don't really think I can blame him. Do you?",

        "Jade: Hey, Casey. What's up?",
        "Luke: Did you find Elwood? Is he dealing?",
        "Casey: I put up some feelers but he was acting nervous. He said he didn't know what I was talking about. So, I tried something else.",
        "Noah: What'd you do?",
        "Casey: I slipped those pills into his backpack. So all you have to do is get the cops to pick him up.",
        "Noah: And that doesn't matter to you that it's totally illegal?",
        "Casey: So was Elwood giving Reg the drugs that killed him! Come on, we know he did it. You guys saw him give Reg the drugs.",
        "Luke: Well, we didn't actually see anything.",
        "Casey: You saw enough. And once they find the same drugs in his backpack, they're going to send him to Statesville.",
        "Noah: It's a big risk. You don't know that?",
        "Casey: Do you guys want to get this guy nailed or not? If you guys don't go to the cops, I will.",
        "Luke: No, no -- we'll go. When can you get off work?",
        "Noah: I can slip out early.",
        "Luke: Come on. We'll see you guys later.",
        "Jade: Don't let Noah get to you. He can be a real pain sometimes. I think what you did was great.",

        "Casey: Not really.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well I'd like to talk to you in private.",

        "Carly: No, wait -- that one. I don't know. You know something? I either love the vodka business or I just love vodka.",

        "Carly: You did, and it is. And you know, this is more fun than I've had -- since I don't know when.",
        "Craig: Tell you what -- let's put your memory to the test.",
        "Carly: What is that? What're you doing?",
        "Craig: Oh, be still. Be still. This is your final exam -- we're going to subject you to a little blind tasting. Now, how about this? Tell me what that is.",
        "Carly: Czech Republic.",

        "Carly: Potatoes.",
        "Craig: And how do you know?",
        "Carly: Because it's creamy. A slight burn. And no fruit finish.",

        "Carly: What time is it?",
        "Craig: It's 1:30.",
        "Carly: No! We'll never get back by the time school lets out, Craig!",
        "Craig: Relax, relax. Oakdale is an hour behind New York. If we leave now, we'll get back in plenty of time for you to meet Sage and make a gallon of hot chocolate.",

        "Margo: Oh, sorry. Yeah, the kid who OD'd at Yo's.",
        "Luke: Yeah, we were actually there. Do you remember Casey's old roommate, Elwood Hoffman?",
        "Margo: No one forgets Elwood?",
        "Luke: All right, well, we saw Elwood and Reg outside the bar. It looked like something was going on.",
        "Margo: Like what?",
        "Luke: Like, when Noah and I showed up, they acted really weird. Like they were wondering if we had seen something.",
        "Margo: And how soon afterwards did Reg collapse?",
        "Luke: Maybe a couple of minutes. Elwood took off before the police got there. We think he sold Reg some bad drugs.",
        "Margo: All right, thanks for the tip. Is there anything else?",
        "Luke: No, no.",
        "Margo: All right, guys, I'm really sorry about your friend.",
        "Luke: Thank you. Well, that went well.",

        "Matt: Well, it's too cold to go back to the park anyway.",
        "Alison: It's true. Oh God, I wish it weren't so long until spring. I just feel like having a picnic out in the middle of the woods, you know? Just away from everybody.",
        "Matt: Does that include me?",
        "Alison: No. You could be the one exception.",
        "Matt: Thanks, Alison. But the truth is, you deserve a lot better.",

        "Casey: You know what, Dad? I'm sick and tired of you and Mom having a problem with every girl I happen to like. It's none of your business, okay?",
        "Tom: Look, I know you're supposed to be able to make your own decisions when you're 21. But do you wonder why your mother and I are so worried about who you hang out with? A kid died at your party last night.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know. And I'm going to do whatever it takes to make sure that never happens again.",
        "Tom: What does that mean?",
        "Casey: Nothing, okay? Can you just trust me this once?",
        "Jade: Is everything okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, we just finished up.",

        "Jade: Oops. No wonder the old man didn't look too happy.",
        "Casey: He's not the only one. There's my mom, Noah, Luke --",
        "Jade: Yeah, everyone seems to be against us. What does that tell you?",
        "Casey: I guess we're doing something right!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh great, thanks, I'll take it from here. So, Elwood, didn't think I'd see you so soon.",
        "Elwood: I want to call my parents. Or should I call a lawyer?",
        "Margo: No, no, no, I don't think that'll be necessary. Did you know a kid named Reg Addington?",
        "Elwood: Name's not familiar.",
        "Margo: No, well let me refresh your memory. He was at Yo's last night, he died of an overdose, he mixed a prescription drug, Hydrocodone with alcohol.",
        "Elwood: It's a shame.",
        "Margo: Yeah, you have any idea where Reg would get a hold of a drug like that?",
        "Elwood: No. Why? I had nothing to do with this.",
        "Margo: Do you mind if I look in your backpack there?",
        "Elwood: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Margo: Malone.",
        "Cop: He's clean.",
        "Margo: Yep, that's what I was afraid of.",
        "Elwood: So, can I go now?",
        "Margo: Go ahead. Stay out of trouble.",
        "Elwood: Don't worry. I will. Say hi to Casey for me. Later guys.",
        "Tom: Hey, Beautiful, how's it going?",
        "Margo: Not so good. The lead I thought I had on who sold the drugs to the kid who OD'd. It was a dead end.",
        "Tom: Ah, that's too bad. I, on the other hand, was able to solve one mystery. I believe I have a positive id on Casey's sleepover guest.",
        "Margo: Oh, she and the missing thong?",
        "Tom: It was Jade Taylor.",
        "Margo: Jade Taylor. What did we do to deserve this? Man --",
        "Casey: So, give us some good news. Elwood's in jail, right?",
        "Luke: No. The cops couldn't find anything on him. So Elwood walked.",
        "Casey: Damn it! He must've found the pills and got rid of them.",
        "Noah: Yeah, so much for your plan, Casey.",
        "Luke: You know what Noah, let's not lay it on, okay? I'll see you guys later.",
        "Casey: I -- I just don't believe this.",
        "Jade: So what's next, big guy?",
        "Casey: We got to find another way to nail him.",
        "Jade: No, I'm not talking about that. I mean, what's next with us?",
        "Casey: Oh. Well -- I guess we could pick up where we left off?",
        "Jade: Sounds good to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Matt, what are you doing?",
        "Matt: Well, I couldn't change the weather and make it spring, so I figured I'd at least give you the picnic.",
        "Alison: Wow, you are too much! I see you spared no expense.",
        "Matt: Only the best. I went to Mabel's. Double mustard, no sauerkraut, right?",
        "Alison: That's right. I can't believe you remembered that!",
        "Matt: The whole time that I was in jail, I tried to bring back every good memory I ever had in my life. It's like, when you're locked up 24/7, it really helps.",
        "Alison: You're a good guy, Matt.",
        "Matt: Have a seat.",
        "Alison: Thank you. It feels like springtime already.",
        "Matt: It's a good feeling, right? Now -- do you want some ketchup for your fries?",

        "Carly: No, thanks. I can handle it. Or, maybe I should just sit down. Yeah, I think so.",
        "Craig: Now that's a good idea. Put your feet up. Drink plenty of water. Take two aspirin, you'll be good as new in no time.",
        "Craig: Meanwhile, I'll go make that hot chocolate for Sage.",
        "Carly: No, really, Craig. I can do that.",
