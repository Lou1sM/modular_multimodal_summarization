        "Casey: Okay. Hi. I'm -- I'm Casey Hughes, and today's my last day as a single man because tomorrow's my wedding day. Of course, I got people lined up to work the camera, 'cause, you know, I'm the groom and stuff, but I just wanted to be the first person to say something on-camera, you know, for prosperity. Okay. So, in less than 24 hours, I am going to marry Alison Stewart. I'm a little nervous, obviously, because she's awesome and amazing and beautiful, and I really don't know why she is marrying me, but she would be here right now, but she's doing her bride stuff because she's the bride. Anyway, I don't really know what she's doing, but I'm guessing it has to be important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: Didn't you hear what I said? You are the only person who can stop me from hurting the people that you care about.",
        "Alison: I don't understand. Why do you want to hurt them?",
        "Mick: No. I told you, I don't want to, but I can't control it.",
        "Alison: Because James Stenbeck is somehow making you do these things?",
        "Mick: Yes, that's right.",
        "Alison: Mick, James Stenbeck is dead.",
        "Mick: No, I know. I know he's dead, but it doesn't matter. He's in here. He's in my head, and I try to fight him off, but I can't. It's too hard.",
        "Alison: Wait. Is that what you're doing when you get your nosebleeds?",
        "Mick: Yes, and the headaches. Exactly. That's what happens when I try and resist him, when I try and think for myself, and it's like his thoughts are in my head and I have to do what he wants.",
        "Alison: No. You're still Mick Dante. You don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.",
        "Mick: No. It doesn't matter who I am most of the time. When he takes over, Mick Dante is gone. I am James Stenbeck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Hi.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Susan: Where's Paul?",
        "Emily: He was just texting me. He's out shopping for Alison's wedding gift.",
        "Susan: Oh. I can't believe she's getting married tomorrow.",
        "Emily: I know. Alison and Casey? Who could have ever imagined.",
        "Susan: That's not what I meant.",
        "Emily: What's wrong?",
        "Susan: She was supposed to meet me after her shift for some last-minute shopping, but she left work early, and now she's not answering her phone.",
        "Emily: Well, where is she?",
        "Susan: I don't know. And there's more, and maybe you should brace yourself for this.",
        "Emily: What? What? What do you mean?",
        "Susan: Mick Dante escaped from the hospital.",
        "Emily: Are you kidding me?",
        "Susan: Nope. That's why I'm so worried.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. For me, for Paul.",
        "Susan: And for your sister. You don't know?",
        "Emily: Don't know what? Mother, what are you talking about?",
        "Susan: You can't say anything.",
        "Emily: I'm not gonna promise not to say anything until you tell me what you're talking about. What's going on?",
        "Susan: She slept with him.",
        "Emily: What?! Who told you that?",
        "Susan: She did.",
        "Emily: What? Wait. Why -- why -- why would she do that?",
        "Susan: I don't know, and she's not sure herself.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. I don't believe this.",
        "Susan: I know. It's bad.",
        "Emily: Oh. You have no idea how bad it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Where is he? Where's that little science experiment?",
        "Barbara: I don't know where your father is.",
        "Paul: He's not my father!",
        "Barbara: You know, the sooner or later, you're going to have to accept it, Paul!",
        "Paul: Here's all I have to accept.",
        "Barbara: What are you doing with that?",
        "Paul: What do you think I'm doing with this?",
        "Barbara: I'm not gonna let you shoot your father!",
        "Paul: He's not my father! James is dead! This kid is just somebody that James managed to brainwash!",
        "Barbara: And if you believe that, why do you want to shoot him?",
        "Paul: It's the only way to stop him!",
        "Barbara: You're not making any sense.",
        "Paul: I'm not asking you again. You tell me where he is.",
        "Barbara: I don't know.",
        "Paul: Don't you lie to me.",
        "Barbara: Why? You gonna shoot me, too?",
        "Paul: You brought him in to my life. Now, one way or another, I'm gonna get rid of him, this time for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You are not James Stenbeck. Please tell me that you know that you're not him.",
        "Mick: It doesn't matter.",
        "Alison: Yes, it does! You have to hold on to that. It's the only way to help you through this.",
        "Mick: I've tried.",
        "Alison: Well, he is dead! He can't control you. Yes, he was an evil monster who hurt a lot of people, including you, but --",
        "Mick: No, he didn't hurt me. He loved me, and I loved him.",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Mick: He took me in, treated me like I was his son, let me look up to him like he was my father, and in return, he wanted me to come back here and destroy Paul and everyone he cares about.",
        "Alison: But why would he want you to do that?",
        "Mick: Because Paul betrayed him.",
        "Alison: No. No. James ruined Paul's life over and over again, and now he's trying to destroy yours, too.",
        "Mick: No. I owe him everything.",
        "Alison: You can't let him force you to do this!",
        "Mick: You don't understand! He doesn't have to force me!",
        "Alison: You make it sound like you --",
        "Mick: No! I make it sound like I want to do this? I don't, but I knew that this was coming. I did. I knew it was just a matter of time.",
        "Alison: Fine. Fine. You said that I could stop this, then that is what I'm gonna do.",
        "Mick: You see, I knew that I needed you from the moment I saw you. We were meant to meet each other. This is destiny.",
        "Alison: The only reason that I helped you then, Mick, was because I thought you seemed desperate. That's all.",
        "Mick: Then why did you sleep with me?",
        "Alison: Helping you was a big mistake. It's made my life miserable, not to mention my sister's.",
        "Mick: Then why are you here? Why did you come with me when I left the hospital?",
        "Alison: Well, I don't know.",
        "Mick: Because I asked you to, and you couldn't say no. You know that I needed you, that I need you to fight this.",
        "Alison: Well, I don't even know if I believe you!",
        "Mick: I'm telling you the truth.",
        "Alison: That James Stenbeck has programmed you to destroy his family and that -- and that you can't stop it and you're not even sure if you want to?",
        "Mick: Yes.",
        "Alison: I-I don't -- why does he want to do -- how did you even get involved with him?",
        "Mick: I told you, he took me in.",
        "Alison: Just like that?",
        "Mick: Yeah. I had nothing. I was nothing. I ran away from home, and no one even tried to find me. I was living on the streets. I was living in the woods when the weather got bad. Stole what I could, foraged the rest, and one day it was pouring, I was soaked and I was freezing, and I had nowhere to go, and I noticed this cabin in the woods, and I thought it was deserted. So, I broke in, and then I realized that I wasn't alone.",
        "Alison: James was there.",
        "Mick: I thought he was gonna kill me, but he didn't, and later he said he saw something in me right away.",
        "Alison: What was he doing there?",
        "Mick: He was hiding out, just like I was. So, we hid out together, and he treated me better than anyone ever had, and he made me feel like I mattered. And after a while, he started to call me \"Son,\" told me I gave him more respect than his real son ever had.",
        "Alison: He never gave Paul a reason to do anything but hate him.",
        "Mick: I didn't hate him. I loved him, and he trusted me. If he needed anything done, he would tell me, and I would get it done, and I didn't care what it was. I only cared that he needed it done.",
        "Alison: Even if you knew what you were doing was wrong?",
        "Mick: Back then, I didn't think about it. I only wanted to prove myself to him, but as time went on, the things that he was asking me to do, I -- I just started wondering, \"How much do I really owe him?\"",
        "Alison: That must have been hard for you.",
        "Mick: I never meant to hurt anyone. I just couldn't disappoint him.",
        "Alison: He manipulated you.",
        "Mick: No, I think he knew that my heart wasn't in it the way it used to be. I think he was scared that he was gonna lose me soon.",
        "Alison: Did he?",
        "Mick: No.",
        "Alison: Why not?",
        "Mick: Because he took away my ability to think for myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: And here is the great grand dude! Okay, listen. Do you have anything you want to say to the camera?",
        "Bob: Absolutely. What do you want me to say?",
        "Casey: You can start off by saying how I'm your favorite, number-one grandson.",
        "Bob: Okay.",
        "Casey: Good one, good one.",
        "Bob: Well, you know I love you, kid.",
        "Casey: Okay, yes. So, what do you think about me and Alison getting married?",
        "Bob: Well, I'm thrilled. I think you make a perfect couple.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Bob: Yes. I think you'll have a long and happy life together.",
        "Casey: Thanks. Can I ask you something?",
        "Bob: Sure, you can.",
        "Casey: When you and Kim were getting married, were you nervous at all?",
        "Bob: Are you kidding? I was shaking like a leaf. You know, the first time that I performed surgery, I thought, \"I'll never be anxious about anything again,\" and then came the wedding day, and it made surgery look like making a sandwich.",
        "Casey: But why were you so nervous? I mean, you were sure you loved Kim, right?",
        "Bob: I've never been more sure of anything in my life, but it's a big deal.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's a huge commitment. I mean, saying you're gonna spend the rest of your life with this one person and planning to have kids with them, start a family?",
        "Bob: Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm talking about the wedding day.",
        "Casey: Oh, okay.",
        "Bob: I mean, I never had any doubts about all that other stuff that you just mentioned, but -- do you have doubts?",
        "Casey: Me? Doubts about Alison? Are you kidding me?",
        "Bob: I take that as a yes.",
        "Casey: Absolutely.",

        "Henry: Listen, you got to let me out of here, all right? Take that mask off! I don't have tuberculosis! You're gonna regret locking me up in here! Dr. Hughes happens to be a very good friend of mine!",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Orderly: Room 715. It's for you. Detective Hughes.",
        "Henry: Oh, Margo! Thank God! You have got to help me out. I am being held against my will! What? No, not by Mick Dante. Why would -- he said what? Does he know James is dead? Does Barbara know about this? You really think he's dangerous? No, of course I won't go near him, Margo. I'm trying to tell you that I am a prisoner here in -- Margo? Margo? [Coughing] Help! Tuberculosis! It's getting worse! You got to help me!",
        "Orderly: I'll call a doctor!",
        "Henry: You don't understand! You don't understand! I'm feeling very weak!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I'm not gonna let you do something that you're going to regret.",
        "Paul: No chance of that. Tell me, where is dear old dad?",
        "Barbara: I don't know how many times I have to tell you, I don't know!",
        "Paul: You tell me where he is or, so help me, I will shoot you.",
        "Barbara: You'd shoot me?",
        "Paul: Do you remember what he did to my wife? You take his side on this, Mom, and you and I, we're through. What's it gonna be, him or me?",
        "Barbara: All Angels Church, in the bell tower. He likes it up there.",
        "Paul: You better not be lying.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: James Stenbeck?",
        "Emily: That's right.",
        "Susan: James is dead. Not only that, he would be twice Mick Dante's age.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know, but Mick claims that the injections he gave to me and Barbara, he gave to himself. It saved his life and reversed the aging process.",
        "Susan: And Barbara believes this?",
        "Emily: Evidently, yeah.",
        "Susan: Do you?",
        "Emily: No. No. I think the guy's insane.",
        "Susan: But?",
        "Emily: I saw it with my own eyes. Okay, I saw Paul pluck the hairs out of Mick's head, and he ran a DNA test, Mom. It's almost an exact match to James.",
        "Susan: Maybe there was a mix-up in the lab or --",
        "Emily: Maybe. I don't know. You know what? It doesn't matter. Whoever this guy is, he's dangerous.",
        "Susan: I can't believe he convinced so many people to buy in to this.",
        "Emily: No. You don't -- you don't know. He had this way of getting in to your head and making you believe what he's telling you, and if he has Alison, Mom -- we got to get her.",
        "Susan: We got to find her.",
        "Emily: We got to find her, fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I knew that James Stenbeck could be persuasive, but --",
        "Mick: No. It was more than that. He would tell me that he wanted to talk to me, and then later, I could barely remember anything that he said.",
        "Alison: You make it sound like he was brainwashing you.",
        "Mick: Yeah. He had this device, this thing, and he would shine the light in my eyes, and then the next thing I knew, my head was full of thoughts, these ideas that I knew weren't mine, but I couldn't resist them. I couldn't --",
        "Alison: God. That sounds terrible.",
        "Mick: To tell you the truth, I liked it at first. I liked being James. I could do things that I couldn't do as myself. I had more guts.",
        "Alison: But you fought it.",
        "Mick: Not until I met you. You made me want to fight it. You made me want to be myself again.",
        "Alison: Look, Mick, what you need is professional counseling, someone who knows how to reverse the psychological programming. You're gonna have to turn yourself in.",
        "Mick: Do they have those people in prison?",
        "Alison: You don't have to go to prison, okay? Casey's mom is the chief of detective. She will listen to me. I will make her understand, okay? But we need to go now, while James isn't controlling you.",
        "Mick: We're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I have no doubts about Alison. I know I want to spend the rest of my life with her.",
        "Bob: Well, then, what's the problem?",
        "Casey: Me. I want our marriage to be as good as yours or my parents'. You know they're strong, they're dependable, they're responsible, and she deserves that.",
        "Bob: Mm-hmm.",
        "Casey: And I'm not sure I have what it takes.",
        "Bob: Nonsense. I mean, the fact that you're worried about it is -- is a good sign.",
        "Casey: It is?",
        "Bob: Well, you love Alison. You -- you want to be with her. You want to take care of her, share things for the rest of your life.",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah. All the way.",
        "Bob: Well, you got what it takes. I mean, well, you got to work at it. I mean, you can't take things for granted, but if you get the right girl like I did, it's the best decision you'll ever make in your life.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Casey: I'll get that.",
        "Emily: Hey.",
        "Susan: Hi.",
        "Emily: We're -- we're looking for Ali.",
        "Casey: She isn't here.",
        "Emily: Have -- have you heard from her?",
        "Casey: I thought she was with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: I'm not turning myself in. I'm not going to prison.",
        "Alison: Okay. Will you please let go of my arm?",
        "Mick: You're gonna tell them where I am.",
        "Alison: No, I wouldn't do that, but you do need help, and I just want to make sure that you get it.",
        "Mick: They're not gonna believe me.",
        "Alison: Margo will listen, okay? I will make sure that she knows that this isn't your fault.",
        "Mick: That doesn't matter! I hurt your sister, I lied to Barbara, I cheated Paul out of thousands of dollars! They don't care if I go to jail! They're gonna lock me up, and then I'm gonna lose you.",
        "Alison: Mick, you don't have me to lose.",
        "Mick: How can you say that?",
        "Alison: Because it's the truth.",
        "Mick: We made love.",
        "Alison: And then I went home to Casey, which is where I want to be. It's where I belong.",
        "Mick: You're lying to yourself.",
        "Alison: I'm not.",
        "Mick: You've had many chances to walk out of here. Nothing I said has scared you off. What does that tell you?",
        "Alison: It tells me that you're here to hurt my sister and her husband and that I won't let you do that. I can't.",
        "Paul: Mick Dante! I know you're here! I'm coming for you!",
        "Alison: It's Paul.",
        "Mick: Shh, shh. Keep quiet.",
        "Alison: He knows that you're up here.",
        "Mick: Maybe not.",

        "Barbara: God, you came to your senses, Paul! Henry?",
        "Henry: Can I come in, please? I'm freezing.",
        "Barbara: You're in a hospital gown.",
        "Henry: I know that.",
        "Barbara: W-why?",
        "Henry: Look, I can tell you. It's a very long story. Please let me in, please?",
        "Barbara: Yes. Come on in. What were you doing in the hospital?",
        "Henry: I wasn't just in the hospital. I was in quarantine.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Henry: Tuberculosis.",
        "Barbara: You've got to get out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: Same thing you are.",
        "Paul: Where is he?",
        "Alison: Why? What -- what's that for?",
        "Paul: You don't need to worry about that.",
        "Alison: Paul, this is a church. It's not right to have a gun in here.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I'm not so worried about what's right. Is he up there?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Paul: You just came from there! Do you not know what he did to your sister?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know.",
        "Paul: So, answer me. Is Mick Dante up in that bell tower or not?",
        "Alison: Paul, I just want to know what the gun is for.",
        "Paul: You don't really want to know what the gun is for.",
        "Alison: Okay, Mick's not here. Not anymore. He -- he's gone.",
        "Paul: But he was here.",
        "Alison: Yes. I-I followed him after he escaped from the hospital.",
        "Paul: Did you help him?",
        "Alison: No! I-I had no idea what he was planning to do.",
        "Paul: What happened after you got here?",
        "Alison: I tried to talk to him to convince him to go back and turn himself in.",
        "Paul: How'd that go?",
        "Alison: He's afraid that he'll be put in jail.",
        "Paul: He should be. Where did he go?",
        "Alison: All he said was that he's leaving town.",
        "Paul: He's not leaving town.",
        "Alison: Paul, he was scared. I don't know. Something about being put in a cell really spooked him out.",
        "Paul: Oh, my heart just bleeds for him.",
        "Alison: He's not here, okay? Will you just leave it at that, please?",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess. I'm just -- I'm a little spooked myself.",
        "Paul: He's not gonna hurt anyone, not ever again.",
        "Alison: I know that. He's gone.",
        "Paul: You should call your mom, call your sister. You've got a wedding to worry about. Don't forget that.",

        "Bob: Why don't you tape these lovely young ladies while we wait for Alison?",
        "Emily: What do you mean?",
        "Casey: Oh, I want to get everyone saying something for the wedding video.",
        "Susan: Oh. Maybe we should wait and do that at a different time?",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah. I think we need to go find Alison.",
        "Bob: This won't take long, and we'll hear from Alison, and you'll know where to meet her.",

        "Barbara: You're sure you're not sick?",
        "Henry: Yes, of course I'm sure! It was that lunatic quack that's been treating Noah. Forget about him. Forget about the doctor. Listen, Margo told me about Mick Dante.",
        "Barbara: What did she tell you?",
        "Henry: She told me that he's going around saying he's the ghost of James Stenbeck or something crazy like that.",
        "Barbara: She told you that?",
        "Henry: Yeah, she told me like that. So, I thought I would warn you.",
        "Barbara: I already know.",
        "Henry: Yeah, of course. Of course you would already know. I just think we should be careful until they catch this guy, because he's obviously not playing with a full deck.",
        "Barbara: Mick is James.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Barbara: I know this is very hard to understand, but he's your father.",
        "Henry: What are you talking about?",
        "Barbara: Mick Dante is James Stenbeck.",
        "Henry: Barb-- okay. First of all, the kid's barely out of his 20s.",
        "Barbara: No, I understand that. I understand it, but, you see, James discovered some kind of a youth serum and he used it on himself.",
        "Henry: He's dead.",
        "Barbara: No, he is not. He is very much alive.",
        "Henry: Sweetie, have you been hitting the schnapps? Is that what's going on?",
        "Barbara: I know how hard this is to understand, I really do.",
        "Henry: You really believe this, don't you?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I do. He's back because he wants to make things up to Paul and up to you, and he discovered this serum that can make you younger, actually make you younger, and he is living proof of it.",
        "Henry: Oh, my God. This is why you've been letting him treat you. You want to be younger. Is that it?",
        "Barbara: Well, among other things.",
        "Henry: What? What other things? Why would you do something like this?!",
        "Barbara: Well, I did it for me. And I did it for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: I don't know where I would be without you.",
        "Alison: Dead. He's not going to give up, okay? You -- you need to be careful, Mick. He's gonna keep looking for you, and when he does find you, he will kill you.",
        "Mick: I won't let anything happen to you, either.",
        "Alison: Are -- are you even listening to me?",
        "Mick: Yeah. I don't care about Paul. I just care that you're on my side.",
        "Alison: Mick, you have to find some way to reverse this programming or you're gonna be a danger to everyone.",
        "Mick: Not you.",
        "Alison: You just said that you're here to hurt everybody I care about, so, yes -- yes, you are a really big danger to me.",
        "Mick: But I'm fighting it.",
        "Alison: That's not good enough!",
        "Mick: Well, I don't want some psychiatrist picking through my brain, telling me why I am the way that I am! I just want you.",
        "Alison: And I'm here, and I'm trying to help, but I --",
        "Mick: What?",
        "Alison: Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to do, okay? I can't hide you from Paul forever, and I can't just walk away, but you're telling me now that the main reason you're here is to destroy my sister's family.",
        "Mick: I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: What do you want me to do?",
        "Mick: It's simple. Come away with me.",
        "Alison: I-I can't just leave with you, Mick.",
        "Mick: But if I'm not in Oakdale, I'll be free of the programming.",
        "Alison: Well, how do you know that?",
        "Mick: Because everyone that James wants me to hurt is here.",
        "Alison: What would stop you from coming back?",
        "Mick: You would.",
        "Alison: I can't fight James Stenbeck.",
        "Mick: But I can if I'm not here, and if I'm with you, then we'll be free and we can go anywhere you want, anywhere in the world.",
        "Alison: I -- I'm getting married tomorrow.",
        "Mick: So, then we'll leave tonight.",
        "Alison: I can't.",
        "Mick: Yes, you can. You don't want to marry Casey.",
        "Alison: Yes, I do. I love him.",
        "Mick: No. You love the life that he can give you. You love the family. You love the respect. That is different from being in love with him.",
        "Alison: No. I am in love with him.",
        "Mick: Then why did you sleep with me?",
        "Alison: I was confused.",
        "Mick: No, you weren't confused. You were looking for a way out.",
        "Alison: You're wrong.",
        "Mick: You are getting married tomorrow, and you want to stop it.",
        "Alison: I don't want to.",
        "Mick: Be honest with yourself. Be honest with yourself like you were when you were lying in my arms right here.",
        "Alison: I don't even know why I'm listening to you. You're not -- you're not even sane! I don't even know what the hell I'm doing here with you!",
        "Mick: You are here with me because being here with me is the place that you most want to be.",
        "Alison: Stop! I can't listen to this anymore. You just need to leave, okay?",
        "Mick: Alison --",
        "Alison: No! You -- you have to go! And if you don't turn yourself in, then Paul will find you, and he will kill you.",
        "Mick: No. I'm not gonna leave without you.",
        "Alison: I'm not going with you, okay? I'm going to marry Casey. So, just -- now go! Just -- I never want to see you again!",
        "Mick: Shh. No, no, no, no. Don't say that.",

        "Henry: You did what for me?",
        "Barbara: Look, Henry, you know, you have to admit, we got off to kind of a rocky start. You were using me.",
        "Henry: You know how sorry I am about that.",
        "Barbara: I do. And I was using you, and I was not quite so sorry about that, because we did have some very lovely times.",
        "Henry: Yeah. With all due respect, Vienna left me because of our times together. So, I don't look back on it as fondly as you do.",
        "Barbara: Well, I suppose not, but, I mean, however, it did happen. For me, it was -- well, it was exactly what I needed.",
        "Henry: Barbara, you are a very attractive woman. You don't need me to prove that to you.",
        "Barbara: Oh, but I did. You see, after the cancer diagnosis, I thought that my life was over, and then you came along and you showed me that it -- it doesn't have to be.",
        "Henry: Well, I'm -- I'm glad I could help you with that. What does this have to do with Mick?",
        "Barbara: I was in a very strange place after us, and -- and -- I mean, even though I had beat the cancer, I was still feeling very vulnerable, and I felt like it could come back and take me away, and I felt old.",
        "Henry: Oh, God. You are not old.",
        "Barbara: Well, the thing is, despite all your faults, Henry, you are alive.",
        "Henry: What faults?",
        "Barbara: Oh, come on, Henry. You're selfish. You're petty.",
        "Henry: I am not petty. I just streaked through Old Town to see you!",
        "Barbara: That's exactly what I'm talking about! See how alive you are? And that's how you made me feel. And, so, despite everything else, I realized, in the end, I just couldn't compete with Vienna or Katie.",
        "Henry: I never meant for it to be a competition.",
        "Barbara: Well, you probably didn't, but that's how it was in my mind.",
        "Henry: And then Mick comes along with his treatments and you thought --",
        "Barbara: I thought that not only could I feel younger, I could really be younger.",
        "Henry: Hey, hey, it's -- a con man always has a nose for his mark, and the whole fountain of youth thing, that's one of the oldest scams in the book.",
        "Barbara: Because there's always an older, richer woman willing to pay to be younger and silly.",
        "Henry: Would you listen? Listen to me. You don't need to be younger. You don't need to be anything but what you are right now, which happens to be a very attractive, exciting woman, who's also sexy as hell.",

        "Paul: At the church. She's the one who told me that Mick got away.",

        "Paul: He can run, but he can't hide from me. After what he did to you, I'm gonna wipe that rat off the face of the earth.",

        "Paul: No. You see, that's not gonna happen, because I'm gonna tell them right from the beginning what I'm doing.",
        "Emily: Are you crazy?!",
        "Paul: I have a DNA test that proves that he's James Stenbeck.",
        "Emily: You don't believe that for a minute!",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter what I believe. James Stenbeck is legally dead. I can't go to jail for killing a corpse. It's pretty clever. Don't you think?",
        "Emily: You'd still be killing a human being, Paul.",
        "Paul: That's the last thing this guy is.",

        "Casey: Well, I texted you, too.",
        "Alison: Yeah. My battery went dead.",
        "Casey: Who cares? I'm just glad you're back. Come on, come on. Inside. You're freezing. You know, I heard that creepy Mick Dante guy busted loose from the hospital. I was a little scared he got to you.",

        "Barbara: Yeah.",

They deserve what you're going to do to them. They celebrated my death. Paul and his brother and his mother, they were relieved that I died. You hurt them. I gave them everything, more than I ever gave you, and you, you mourned me. You felt the pain of my death, but they rejoiced. They're still celebrating. That wedding tomorrow -- that's Alison's wedding. I'm not gonna ruin that for her. That little girl doesn't care about you. Yes, she does. Then why is she marrying Casey Hughes? You're a distraction, that's all. She'll never love you. She's just like the rest of them. That's why you need to take care of all of them at the wedding. They'll all be together. You need to make them suffer. I don't want to hurt them. They've been good to me. Don't be stupid! I'm the only one who was ever good to you! And now you are me. No. I'm not. It's too late.
