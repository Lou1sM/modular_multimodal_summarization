        "Katie: Oh, Margo. I'm so sorry. I don't know --",
        "Margo: Katie, are you okay?",
        "Katie: Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm just a klutz.",
        "Margo: You know, I called the cottage, like, over 20 times and you weren't there, so I thought I'd try here, but what are you doing here? What are you doing back at work so soon?",
        "Katie: Well, folding linens and filling water pitchers just keeps my mind off everything.",
        "Margo: Katie, why don't you talk to me?",
        "Katie: There's nothing to talk about.",
        "Margo: A husband you've been grieving for so long suddenly returns and then you lose him again in a matter of days. That's a subject to talk about. Folding sheets isn't gonna take the pain away.",
        "Katie: Well, it sure beats crying.",
        "Margo: Yeah, that may be. But if anybody has a right to cry, it's you, baby. When you were engaged to Mike, you were finally happy after all this time. Simon shows up, you lose them both. So talk to me.",
        "Katie: I just really don't want to talk about Simon or Mike. I just want to get on with my life, okay?",
        "Margo: Okay, good idea. Fold sheets.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Come on. Why don't you come to Metro with me? Paul Ryan's having a party. Everybody would love to see you. It would give you a break from folding sheets.",
        "Katie: Margo, I appreciate it. But I'll pass.",
        "Margo: My cell phone is always on, waiting for you to call.",
        "Katie: Thank you. I love you. Sorry, I've done this so many --",
        "Mike: Hello, Katie \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you know how sexy you are in this dress? Yeah, only the hottest chick in the room. That's why the reporters can't get enough of you.",
        "Carly: For tonight, anyway.",
        "Jack: Oh, you heard them all whispering, \"that's her design.\" Obviously they think this should be your night, not Barbara's. Doesn't that make you happy?",
        "Carly: A little. But mostly it reminds me of when it was my night. I was so close, Jack, right before the crashing and burning of Monte Carlo. Maybe I grabbed a little of the spotlight tonight. But what about tomorrow?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I'm sorry, Paul, but I'm not buying this little love fest between you and Barbara, not for one minute.",
        "Paul: She doesn't have any complaints. Why would you?",
        "Hal: Barbara believes only what she wants to believe, but not me. You know, if this were really about Will, you would have made peace a long time ago instead of putting the kid in the middle of your little family war. So don't tell me that this is for his sake, damn it, because I'm not buying, and frankly, neither would Will.",
        "Paul: Mom and I are trying to build something. I don't know why you would want to tear it all apart.",
        "Hal: Because I know you and Barbara way too well, Paul, and one thing I know beyond a doubt is that it won't take long for this whole cozy, little affair to go south and for other people to start getting hurt.",
        "Barbara: Is this how you're welcoming our reconciliation, Hal? By bullying us?",
        "Hal: Well, it's better than lying through my teeth. But I guess that's your job.",
        "Barbara: You know what one of the main reasons was that we decided to have this little soiree? It was for you. So would believe that Paul and I are serious about starting over.",
        "Paul: You know, Hal, if you can't support us, then I'm gonna make sure when Will gets out, that he knows that you were against us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: It just kills me how much time we've wasted, and I don't want to waste any more.",
        "Alison: Me neither, but moving in together -- Chris, that's huge.",
        "Chris: I know. That's the point.",
        "Alison: So then we have to be sure about this, because, I mean, you know how our parents are going to feel about this, don't you? They'll think that we're moving in too fast.",
        "Chris: I don't care how they feel, okay? I care how we feel. Alison, we have loved each other for a long time, only we were too scared to tell each other. I need you to know I'm not afraid anymore. I'm with you now, Alison. And I want to know if you're with me.",
        "Alison: This is the best Valentine's Day of my entire life.",
        "Chris: I take it that's a yes? Okay, definitely a yes. Okay, well, I'd better break the news to my folks before they break their necks trying to figure out what's going on. Wish me luck?",
        "Alison: I don't need to. You are my good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clark: To the sweetest eyes that have ever glanced my way. Come on, drink up, so we can dance. They got some pretty good music here, huh? Good sound system.",
        "Lucy: I can't. Clark, I'm sorry. I just can't do this.",
        "Clark: You promised. You said you were going to have a good time. Just try.",
        "Lucy: I know. I know, I'm trying. But I just can't stop thinking about my Dad and Rosanna.",
        "Clark: What's wrong?",
        "Lucy: Nothing. Nothing, I'm -- I feel kind of light-headed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Rosanna -- don't leave --",
        "Rosanna: Please! I can't talk about this anymore. It's over!",
        "Craig: I am not going to give up on this family and I'm not going to let you throw it away either!",
        "Rosanna: Please get out -- before I say something that I'm going to regret. Please, go!",
        "Craig: I am going to do whatever it takes. I will make time for this; I will go with you to counseling, to family therapy -- whatever you need.",
        "Rosanna: Family therapy?! What good is a family therapist going to do us? We don't have a family anymore. You saw to that.",
        "Craig: No! No!",
        "Rosanna: No!",
        "Craig: I have always been there for this family!",
        "Rosanna: Just get out of here! Oh, what is this?",
        "Craig: My chest --",
        "Rosanna: This is crazy! This is crazy! Even for you. You think faking a heart attack is going to get me to stay with you?!",
        "Craig: Call an ambulance \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Tomorrow is gonna be great, and the tomorrow after that, even better, you gotta believe, baby. I do.",
        "Carly: What I believe is that I may very well be doomed to never have a window on Fifth Avenue, a giant billboard that says \"Tenney Originals\" --",
        "Jack: Would you shut up?",
        "Carly: But, if I always have you and Parker and Sage in my life, I will be the richest woman in the world.",
        "Jack: Okay, we came, and we conquered -- let's get the hell out of here.",
        "Carly: You read my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I think I should just sit down.",
        "Aaron: Excuse me, man. Luce? Luce, are you okay? Are you feeling all right?",
        "Clark: Chill out, man. She's just a little light-headed.",
        "Aaron: Look, I saw her from the bar, okay. It looked like she was gonna pass out. I think look, maybe you ought to see a doctor. Look at me, Luce. Oh, man, you look really out of it. Okay, look, look, I'm going to tell Molly it's an emergency. I'm going to take you to Memorial to get checked out.",
        "Lucy: Aaron, this is none of your business. I just -- I just need to go home.",
        "Aaron: Fine, we'll go home. Look, I've got the club van out front. Look, there's a big back seat, you can lie down, so whatever you want --",
        "Clark: Listen, what part of \"none of your business\" don't you understand?",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, all right. Dr. Harris is right there. Let him check her out, she's not feeling well.",
        "Clark: You're done here, man. Lucy's with me now. If she still wants to go home, I can take her home. So, back off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Living together is a big step.",
        "Kim: Not to mention a terrible idea.",
        "Chris: Mom --",
        "Kim: Well, it's only been a few days ago that Alison was trying to have you put in prison. I'm sorry. I'm tired of biting my tongue about this subject.",
        "Bob: I'm sure he's aware of how you feel about Alison.",
        "Chris: I know that you think that she's too young for me.",
        "Kim: Among other things, yes.",
        "Chris: Mom, I respect your feelings. I really do. But frankly, I think a lot of them are holdovers from the past that have nothing to do with me. So, I'm sorry if you don't like the family she comes from, but I'm serious about Alison and I'm doing this whether you like it or not.",
        "Kim: You're wrong about this. This is not about my past. It is about your future. You said you were going to try to live at home your first year of residency so you could save some money, and get out of debt.",
        "Chris: Plans change, Mom. Besides, you're not telling me money is why you object?",
        "Kim: Okay. You and Alison move in together now and, from the very beginning, you are behind the eight-ball. Now, is that the way you want to start your lives together? Under a mountain of debt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: You just lost a baby. You're still legally married to Aaron Snyder. And until a few days ago you thought Chris tried to kill you! Now you want to move in with him and play house? Are you insane? Or is it me? You can jump in here anytime.",
        "Emily: Actually, that's okay. You're doing a great job ruining everything all on your own.",
        "Susan: I'm -- I'm ruining things?",
        "Emily: Mom, c'mon. She's a grown-up, okay? Look at her. It's her life. And if she and wants to move in with Chris, then we've got to support her. Okay, so, let's support her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Curtis: Got some new info.",
        "Ben: Okay.",
        "Curtis: Know how you wanted me to apply to some backup colleges?",
        "Ben: Yeah, you know, just in case.",
        "Curtis: I think I found a place.",
        "Ben: Gold coast college of Big Sur? Oh, come on, you've got to be kidding.",
        "Sarah: What's so funny?",
        "Ben: No, nothing. Excuse me; I have to go knock somebody out.",
        "Jessica: Now, Ben \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: How do you think that's gonna make Will feel when he finds out you are the one whose trying to keep our family from being whole again?",
        "Hal: You know, just the fact that you would use him as a threat proves this whole \"reconciliation\" thing is an act.",
        "Barbara: Why are you so suspicious?",
        "Hal: Don't you people see what you people are doing? You are leading Will around. You are trying to make him think whatever you want him to think. That's how this started.",
        "Paul: You're trying to make him think that you're the only one who loves him. Well, you're not. Take a number. Get in line.",
        "Hal: Behind a couple of lying users? I don't think so.",
        "Paul: Hal, you want to insult me? That's fine. But don't you dare insult my mother. And all of your doubts are insult to Will and Jennifer as well. I want an apology. I'm serious. And I'm waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Maybe one of us should say something.",
        "Katie: You -- you shouldn't have come looking for me. I told you already. I can't see you anymore.",
        "Mike: I -- didn't come looking for you. I just came to pick up my last check for the burn unit job.",
        "Katie: Oh -- of course that's why you're here. You look good. I like you're hair.",
        "Mike: Thank you. It's time for a change.",
        "Katie: I guess it'll be easy for you, on your job in Central America. You leave pretty soon, right?",
        "Mike: No, actually I sold the supplies to a contractor down there. And there's a local guy who's gonna be taking over the project. It's too bad, though. It would have been nice to stay out of this cold weather for a while. Look, I'm -- I just want you to know that I hope your life takes you to a good place, because you deserve that. No matter what's gone down between us, I've always just wanted you to be happy.",
        "Katie: I know me too. For you, I mean.",
        "Mike: I guess this is sort of goodbye then, huh?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Mike: Good luck.",
        "Katie: Mike, wait. I just want to tell you that -- I don't know, I don't have the words.",
        "Mike: I heard you loud and clear when Simon left. You said everything. You don't owe me anymore.",
        "Katie: No, I --",
        "Rosanna: Katie! Katie!",
        "Katie: Rosanna? Oh, my God, Craig, what happened?!",
        "Rosanna: He started having chest pains and then he collapsed.",
        "Katie: He had a heart attack?",
        "John: No, no, no, this is a panic attack. It can present as a coronary depending upon the severity of the thing, but this one looks pretty severe.",
        "Katie: Oh, Craig? Thank God, you're okay. Craig? Is he unconscious?",
        "John: No, no, I've sedated him. We're keeping him overnight for observation.",
        "Craig: Rosanna -- [Craig mumbling] Don't leave me. I'll be out of here soon. We can talk.",
        "Rosanna: Craig --",
        "Craig: Just -- just say you won't leave me --",
        "Rosanna: I won't leave you.",
        "Mike: Are you okay?",
        "Rosanna: No. [Rosanna giggles] It's only fitting, though.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Rosanna: That the last words between Craig and I were a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: You want an apology from me? Fine. You call me the minute you see pigs in a v-formation, flying south.",
        "Paul: Hal, I'm not joking around here. I got no problem talking to Will.",
        "Hal: Think twice before you ever use my son against me again. I don't take it lightly. And once more, this whole happy B.R.O. family thing is a load of bull. And you know what? I think you know that, Paul, because you know your mother too well.",
        "Barbara: That was very risky, saying you would go to Will.",
        "Paul: You know what, Mom? It's the Ryan clan from now on. Okay, you and me, and Will and Jennifer. Anybody messes with us, they can expect a fight. That goes for Hal, too.",
        "Barbara: I have never felt so safe in my whole life, you know that?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Paul: Hello.",
        "Rosanna: Hi, Paul, it's Rosanna. I'm so glad you picked up. I'm at the hospital.",
        "Paul: The hospital? You okay?",
        "Rosanna: Well, it's Craig. He's had some sort of attack.",
        "Paul: He had a heart attack?",
        "Rosanna: No. I think it was a panic attack of some kind. Anyway, I'm going to wait here until he is stabilized, and then I am leaving.",
        "Paul: Well, is there anything I can do?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I know you have your big B.R.O. party tonight, but I was wondering if you could do me a favor.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you name it.",
        "Rosanna: I -- I don't want to leave without saying goodbye to Lucy. And I can't seem to get a hold of her. Is she there? I've tried her cell phone, but maybe it's too loud in there, she can't hear it.",
        "Paul: Ah, yeah, I'll get her to call you?",
        "Rosanna: You know, better yet, could you ask her to meet my at your place -- I could meet her there and then I could, you know, say good-bye in person.",
        "Paul: Sure, no problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Aaron, your five minutes was up about fifteen minutes ago. There's a lot of empties on the bar you can take care of.",
        "Aaron: Okay, Molly, um -- look, Lucy's really sick. I might need to take her home.",
        "Clark: No, no. She came with me. I'll take her home.",
        "Molly: See, she's in good hands. Aaron, the bar?",
        "Clark: Don't worry, Lucy, I'll have you home in no time, okay?",
        "Paul: Is Lucy leaving? 'Cause I gotta talk to her.",
        "Aaron: It's gonna have to wait. She's dizzy, or something.",
        "Paul: Oh, I'm sure she's okay. It looks like her friend has everything under control, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Well, so life is pretty good with Ben and Jessica, huh?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, and Curtis is a total riot.",
        "Margo: Yeah, great, and school? Oh, oh, Casey said that you guys have some classes together.",
        "Sarah: Yeah. Casey's really cool. He introduced me to some of his friends and stuff.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, that's my kid, the social director. But you know what, the most important thing is that you're adjusting, and I know that, you know, that can be kinda hard.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, well, it's okay. I mean, I can do what it takes to blend in as long as Jessica keeps taking my letters to Bonnie.",
        "Margo: Excuse me? Jessica is taking letters from you to Bonnie -- in prison?",
        "Ben: Gold coast college of Big Sur? Not an acceptable backup to Morehouse and Princeton.",
        "Curtis: Sounds great to me, Dad. It's a block away from the Pacific Ocean. There's surfing, tie-dye classes.",
        "Ben: What are you talking about? Since when did you aspire to become a hippie?",
        "Jessica: How you fellas doing?",
        "Ben: Maybe you can talk some sense into this hardhead son of mine? His backup plan is to go to slacker U. And major in bead making.",
        "Curtis: Gotcha! My buddy sent this to me as a joke. I guess it worked, huh?",
        "Ben: Man, what are you trying to do? Give me a stroke?",
        "Curtis: I'm applying to some backup schools for real.",
        "Ben: For real?",
        "Curtis: Yeah.",
        "Ben: Johns Hopkins? That's my alma mater.",
        "Curtis: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I've waited too long to make this commitment. But, now that I've made it, it feels good. So, we won't be living in the lap of luxury. But you guys always said, love was more important than money, anyway.",
        "Kim: Oh, okay. Alright -- I can't believe I'm about to say this -- but, since you two are so intent on being together, maybe Alison should move into our house for now.",
        "Bob: Who are you? What have you done with my wife?",
        "Alison: My mother's on her rampage again. Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Kim: Alison -- I've just been telling Chris that instead of the two of you moving into an apartment and strapping yourselves financially, maybe you should move into our house for a while. What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Stop!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You should have seen Parker sitting next to Sage's crib singing \"The Goodnight Song.\" It was so adorable; it makes me want to cry.",
        "Jack: You're thinking about Rosanna and Cabot again, aren't you? Is it selfish to hope that we could find a little time --",
        "Carly: What? Just for just us?",
        "Jack: Snuggle up, maybe. Sip some wine. Do some things that might make St. Valentine blush?",
        "Carly: Oh, I think I could probably put my problems aside long enough to make you mine.",
        "Jack: Baby, I'm already yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: And just like that, he's gone.",
        "Mike: I've been out of the loop. I had no idea you were going through so much.",
        "Rosanna: It's okay. How could you? You have your own life you have to think about. I'm sorry; I haven't even asked you about what's going on with you.",
        "Mike: Another time. I'm sorry, Rosanna. I know how much that little boy meant to you.",
        "Rosanna: Thanks. Thanks. It seems like this is all I do lately.",
        "Mike: You lost a child, how do you expect to feel? For what it's worth, I'm sorry about you and Craig, too.",
        "Rosanna: It's ironic, isn't it? It takes something as awful as losing Cabot to find my strength.",
        "Mike: What do you mean?",
        "Rosanna: It's this marriage. I have to put an end to it. It's killing me. Maybe it's good they're keeping him overnight. It'll make leaving him that much easier.",
        "Mike: Hey, come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: This is a joke, right? You're not really asking me to move into your house, right?",
        "Kim: Well, since the two of you are so determined to live together, maybe this is the best solution. At least you won't be spending yourselves into oblivion.",
        "Chris: Whoa, Mom -- okay, the last thing you need is our music, our late hours and our dirty dishes in your sink. Okay, we very much appreciate the gesture. But Alison and I both work, all right? And we can make it on our own.",
        "Alison: But thank you anyway, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Kim: If you change your minds --",
        "Chris: Don't worry, Dad, we won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: This is so nice.",
        "Ben: Yeah, there's no place I'd rather be than right here with you.",
        "Margo: May I cut in, please?",
        "Ben: I don't know.",
        "Margo: I just need to borrow Jessica for a minute before I leave.",
        "Jessica: I'll be right back.",
        "Margo: Why are you're delivering letters from Sarah to Bonnie when there is a court order that prohibits it?",
        "Jessica: Okay, Margo, first of all, it's not what you think. I just told Sarah I would deliver the letters. I'm not really doing it.",
        "Margo: Well, that's a good idea. Why are you lying to her?",
        "Jessica: Simply so that she would stay with me and Ben and Curtis and have a real family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mom, you're positively glowing.",
        "Barbara: I tell you, Jen, I haven't felt this happy or alive in ages. Do you know that your father just tried to undermine our commitment to each other, and if you can believe this -- Paul put him in his place.",
        "Jennifer: Well, Mom -- Dad has a right to disagree.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I'm not asking you to side against him in this. It's just -- I'm saying I am so thrilled that Paul has taken up for me, for all of us. Do you know that he told him that we are bound and determined to make this new family of ours work, and that we're doing this for Will and we're not gonna be torn apart. I have longed and waited to hear that from him.",
