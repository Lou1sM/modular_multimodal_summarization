        "Jack wants to know what is going on between Nick and Carly when he finds them together when Carly says she was going to be home alone? Jack and Carly argue about her lying. His trust has been broken, but Carly thinks Jack is simply mad because Nick brought her home. She covers by trying to explain she felt obligated to look for Will and Gwen and didn't want to involve him because he is a cop. Either way, Jack leaves angrily and Carly decides going undercover at the strip club isn't worth her marriage. Katie is worried if Mike leaves, their wedding will go up in smoke. He promises that they will be fine. She needs to stay in Oakdale and plan their wedding so when he gets home they can tie the knot. Mike is glad Nick is going to stay at the cottage for a while longer to look after Katie when he is gone. Katie continues to notice Nick's subtle comments about Carly. When he looks longingly at the handkerchief he wiped Carly's lipstick on, we have to ask what kind of feelings does he have for her? Lucinda meets Jade, and is skeptical. She thinks her accident with Luke might have been too coincidental. She pleads with Holden to get a DNA test. Jade asks Lily a personal question \u0096 is she pregnant? Meg arrives back in Oakdale expecting a message from Paul (thanks to Henry's phony message), and is surprised to hear there is no message. Paul disguises himself as the French man as he eavesdrops on Jen's conversation with Madame Lacoste, who now changes her tune, and tells a shocked Jen she thinks Paul is in fact alive. A disguised Paul comes face to face with Jen, who doesn't recognize him. He later slips Meg a matchbook with a message on it and she realizes who the strange man was."

        "Carly: Jack? What are you doing home?",
        "Jack: Mrs. Lebo called me from work. She said she couldn't stay with our kids because her own son was sick.",
        "Carly: Right. She said she had to leave. I told her that I'd be right there.",
        "Jack: Apparently you took too long. And why is that? Where have you been?",
        "Nick: I can explain.",
        "Jack: I didn't ask you, I asked my wife. You told me you were staying in tonight. And now you're with him?",
        "Nick: She had car trouble --",
        "Jack: Once again, I will tell you to stay out of this!",
        "Nick: I'd say I'm already in it.",
        "Carly: Jack, just listen to me, please. I know I made you a promise and I broke that promise. I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: \"I'm sorry\" isn't gonna cut it this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Take a look, Mike. And then ask me again why I don't want Nick living here any longer.",
        "Mike: Okay, so it's a little messy.",
        "Katie: A little messy? It's a pigsty. This is just how he lives. And I don't even think he's trying that hard to find another place.",
        "Mike: At the moment, that's a good thing. I want him right here looking after you while I'm gone. You'll be safer that way.",
        "Katie: The only danger I'm in is tripping over one of his shoes maybe or guitar cases and breaking my neck.",
        "Mike: I will have a talk with him about straightening the place up before I go.",
        "Katie: I won't hold my breath.",
        "Mike: Hey, look. Okay, he may be a pigpen, but he's pigpen with a gun. I will feel a lot safer knowing that he's got you covered while I'm gone.",
        "Katie: Then just don't go.",
        "Mike: Well, hey, it's just a few weeks. You said yourself, you wanted me to reconnect with my brother. I thought you were okay with this.",
        "Katie: I know. I did. I thought I was, too. The more I think about it, I hate the idea. I mean, what if the job takes longer than you expected? Or leads to something better?",
        "Mike: I'll turn it down.",
        "Katie: Like you turned this down right in the middle of planning our wedding?",
        "Mike: Katie, what is this? You said you understood.",
        "Katie: I know. I'm trying. I swear to you that I'm trying. But I'm just -- I don't know, I'm scared.",
        "Mike: Of what?",
        "Katie: I'm scared that if you go, we can kiss our wedding good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey. Luke!",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah. What's up?",
        "Holden: How long do you think you can keep avoiding me? The house isn't that big, you know.",
        "Luke: I'm not avoiding you, Dad. Everything's cool. Now, I gotta go, Jade's waiting for me.",
        "Jade: They're so adorable.",
        "Lily: They really took to you, the girls. That was some bedtime story you told them. Where'd you learn it?",
        "Jade: I just made it up, just now.",
        "Lily: Really? That's impressive. Everything okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah, everything's great.",
        "Holden: Yeah, sure.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Lily: Good, okay. Excuse me.",
        "Luke: So are you ready to burn those cds that we talked about?",
        "Jade: Can't wait. Come on.",
        "Lucinda: Hi, everybody. Oh, I'm glad to see you young man, I have a special present for you. Hello.",
        "Jade: Hi.",
        "Lucinda: Hi, dear. Are you a new friend from school?",
        "Luke: Actually, this is my new cousin.",
        "Lucinda: Your new cousin? Holden.",
        "Lily: Oh, no --",
        "Lucinda: What is he talking about?",
        "Lily: I wanted to have some time to prepare you but now that you're here -- I would like you to meet Jade, Rose's daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, Charlie.",
        "Charlie: Hello, Ms. Snyder, welcome back.",
        "Meg: Thank you. You know, Mexico was great, but I feel so good to be back. Any messages for me?",
        "Charlie: No, I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: Are you sure? Because I got an urgent phone message from someone while I was away. They didn't leave much information and I was kind of hoping they'd call me here.",
        "Charlie: You don't know who it was?",
        "Meg: Well, I have a pretty good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You really think my sister's going to go for this?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Well, she seemed -- at first, put off by the idea that I was a psychic. But she was really upset when she called just now. She said she wanted to meet with me as soon as possible, which is always a good sign.",
        "Paul: It's just that Jennifer's always been such a practical girl. I'd be really surprised if she went for all this stuff.",
        "Madame Lacoste: I remind you, Mr. Ryan, this was your idea.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know. I didn't say it was a good idea.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Your sister's in a lot of pain. She seems wracked with guilt, she's looking for answers. If she called me back, it's because she's ready to explore other possibilities.",
        "Paul: I really hope so.",
        "[Paul coughs]",
        "Madame Lacoste: You sound terrible. You should see a doctor.",
        "Paul: I don't trust doctors.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Well, there must be someone here you can call to help you.",
        "Paul: There was. But she's long gone by now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Charlie: It's a madhouse since the news broke about Mrs. Ryan's son.",
        "Meg: What news? About Paul? Did they find him?",
        "Jennifer: He was talking about Will, not Paul.",
        "Meg: Jennifer, hi.",
        "Jennifer: I don't understand. Why would you think they found Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paul coughing]",
        "Madame Lacoste: You really should go to the hospital.",
        "Paul: I can take care of myself. And you really should mind your own business.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Fine.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. It's just, right now, my entire focus is on my sister, Jennifer.",
        "Madame Lacoste: I'll report back to you after I meet with her.",
        "Paul: No need to do that. I plan on being there.",
        "Madame Lacoste: In spirit, you mean?",
        "Paul: No, in the flesh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, this is a surprise. It's Jade, is it?",
        "Jade: That's right.",
        "Lucinda: And when did you get to Oakdale?",
        "Jade: Yesterday. I mean, that's when I met my family. And they're everything I've ever dreamed of.",
        "Lucinda: And you are Rose d'angelo's daughter. Well, we had no idea. Lily, you must as surprised as I am.",
        "Lily: Of course, I'm completely shocked, absolutely.",
        "Jade: But everyone's been so nice to me.",
        "Lucinda: Well, of course they have. Luke, I brought all these things for the girls it just occurred to me, I don't have a funny card. Could you possibly -- can you step out and maybe get me something.",
        "Luke: Of course, we actually have to get some blank cd's. Because I just remembered that I'm out. Would it be ok if we go downtown?",
        "Holden: I'm not so sure that's such a good idea.",
        "Lucinda: It's just a tiny expedition. I'm sure it's all right, Holden.",
        "Luke: C'mon, please Dad?",
        "Holden: Ok, fine. One hour. And don't get sidetracked by Kevin, or any of your other friends.",
        "Luke: Ok, I won't. Okay? You ready to go?",
        "Jade: Yeah, let me just grab my stuff. I'll be right back.",
        "Lucinda: I'll walk you out. Now, look, I sprung you for a little bit. Don't you repay me by drinking again.",
        "Luke: Grandma, you don't have to worry about that. I'm cool.",
        "Lucinda: Cool is not a reassuring word.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe it should be.",
        "Jade: All set.",
        "Luke: We will be back in half an hour.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, have you two collectively and simultaneously lost your minds? How can you let that girl into your home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack, I was so worried about Will and Gwen that I just couldn't help it. I had to go and look for them.",
        "Jack: You decided to ask Nick to give you a hand. Is that it?",
        "Carly: No. No, of course not. The car broke down. And Nick happened by.",
        "Jack: What a coincidence.",
        "Nick: Actually, it wasn't. I was on the way to see you at WOAK. I was gonna run a few ideas by ya, about the gambling case.",
        "Carly: You see? I'm lucky he was in the right place at the right time.",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, you were so lucky weren't ya? Where's the car, now?",
        "Carly: It's right where I left it.",
        "Nick: I had it towed. It's probably at Burt's garage by now.",
        "Jack: You're Mr. Quick-on-your-feet today, aren't ya?",
        "Nick: What am I to leave her on the side of the road stranded?",
        "Jack: How about we talk about this later because you can bet that we will. Right now, I'd appreciate it if you left so I could have a moment with my wife, alone.",
        "Nick: Sure. I understand. You all right, Carly?",
        "Carly: Fine, thanks for the lift.",
        "Nick: Any time.",
        "Carly: You know, Jack, I'm sorry but I really think that you're overreacting here. A little bit.",
        "Jack: Oh, really? You lied to me, Carly. Then you come home with a guy I can't stand. How do you expect me to react?",
        "Carly: I'm not going to have this argument with you right now. I'm going to go up and change.",
        "Jack: No, you're not. You're going to take your coat off, have a seat, and then you're going to explain to me why it is you just lied through your teeth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I assumed -- I mean, since they never found Paul's body, I just thought that maybe -- look, Jennifer, I'm sorry. I've been out of the town and I'm a just a little jet-lagged. What's happened to Will? Is he all right?",
        "Jennifer: We're not sure. He ran off with Gwen again.",
        "Meg: What happened?",
        "Jennifer: Look, I really -- I can't get into it. Excuse me.",
        "Meg: I don't suppose that anybody's turned in my cell phone in the last few days? I somehow ended up with somebody else's by mistake.",
        "Charlie: No luck.",
        "Meg: Oh, well. One last thing. If Emily Munson or Henry Coleman show up in the lobby, could you call up and let me know?",
        "Charlie: Absolutely.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Thank you for coming.",
        "Madame Lacoste: I'm so glad you decided to give me another chance.",
        "Jennifer: As I told you before, I've never had much faith in psychics or anything supernatural. But I just -- I just feel so lost, I don't know where to turn.",
        "Madame Lacoste: And your confusion's made you more open-minded than you normally would be, is that it?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. But I just keep wondering why you said that my feelings about Paul were misguided. What did you mean?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Well, you're definitely very disturbed, obviously by the disappearance of your brother Will, but your deeper pain is still very much connected to Paul. He is in pain, too.",
        "Jennifer: How can that be? He's dead. [Paul coughing] Oh my gosh, that sounds terrible. Maybe we should help this guy. Sir? Sir, are you okay? Do you want me to get you some water or anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Look, our wedding is not going up in smoke. Okay? That's one of the reasons you're not coming with me. Someone has to stay here to keep all the wedding stuff on track.",
        "Katie: I know, I just want us to do that together. I ask you if you want salmon or filet mignon and should we pick the pink flowers or the purple ones? Do we want a swing orchestra or top 40 band?",
        "Mike: Uh -- both. Pink and top 40. See? It's all taken care of. Look, I'm only a phone call away 24/7.",
        "Katie: Phones are cold. I need you.",
        "Mike: It's two or three weeks, that's it. We can handle this.",
        "Katie: I'm gonna call you five times a day. You know this?",
        "[Mike laughs]",
        "Mike: Why don't we just keep our phones connected the whole time?",
        "Katie: Don't tempt me.",
        "Mike: I love you. And I'm really looking forward to being Mr. Katie Peretti. [Both laugh] I'll take you on a proper honeymoon.",
        "[Katie clears her throat]",
        "Nick: Oh, hey, lovebirds. Well, it looks like you guys can finally get rid of me. One of the guys down at the station is renting me out one of his rooms so, I'm gonna be out of here as of tonight.",
        "Mike: No, Nick, you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You knew you were going to go look for Gwen and Will before I even left for work, didn't you?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jack: Then why were you so insistent that I leave?",
        "Carly: I told you, Jack. We need the money. We're barely cutting it here.",
        "Jack: I don't buy it. You deliberately got me out of the house so you can go and do something you promised you wouldn't.",
        "Carly: That's not true. Jack, it wasn't until after you left that I started to worry so much about Gwen that I finally gave in and I went to look for her!",
        "Jack: Were you ever planning on telling me the truth, Carly?",
        "Carly: Of course, Jack. Why are you making such a big deal out of this? It's about Nick, isn't it?",
        "Jack: This has nothing to do with Nick.",
        "Carly: I think it has everything to do with him. You were mad, Jack, because Nick brought me home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: We spoke to one of the nuns at the orphanage.",
        "Holden: She backed up the story.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, have you learned nothing? Have I taught you nothing? A piece of paper and a phone call do not truth make.",
        "Lily: This wasn't your normal phone call. I was speaking to a nun.",
        "Holden: And she asked all the right questions.",
        "Lucinda: I'm sure Lily did, but people can fabricate papers. They can hire people to lie. Have you forgotten how Rose got into our lives? Why would Rose not have told us? Why would Rose keep that kid a secret from us?",
        "Lily: Maybe she was intimidated because Jade is a mixed race child.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no, no, no, no. Darling, no, no, no. Does that sound like the Rose that we knew? No.",
        "Holden: We think that Jade is on the level here.",
        "Lily: I do believe so.",
        "Lucinda: But you do want to be safe rather than sorry. So you have thought that you should possibly call Joe, Rose's father, and ask him about it. Or do you just want to be awash in sentimentality and forego good judgment?",
        "Lily: You know what? That's a very good idea. I'm gonna call Joe right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You keep coming back here. I'm guessing this is where your friends hang out.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but it's pretty dead tonight.",
        "Jade: Do they -- your friends have anything to do with why you're in so much trouble with your parents?",
        "Luke: Oh, no, that's my fault. I can't blame them for that.",
        "Jade: So what did you do?",
        "Luke: Just some stupid stuff.",
        "Jade: Meaning, you don't want to talk about it. Right?",
        "Luke: Well, like I said, it's just some stupid stuff.",
        "Jade: It must run in the genes.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Jade: I mean, I hate talking about myself, too.",
        "Luke: Oh, then you must be going crazy, the way my parents have been grilling you.",
        "Jade: No, I understand. They're just trying to make sure I'm not some nutcase looking for a handout.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't think you are. I'm glad you're here. I finally have someone in the house that I can talk to.",
        "Jade: As long as you don't have to give away too much about yourself, right?",
        "Luke: I guess so. Yeah.",
        "Jade: Let's make a deal. I won't ask you too many questions about yourself and you don't ask me. We could talk about everything except who we are. How's that?",
        "Luke: Well, that sounds good.",
        "Jade: But I do have one question about my mom.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't know if I can answer it, but sure.",
        "Jade: I know she was murdered before she was supposed to get married.",
        "Luke: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Jade: Who was the groom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Paul coughing]",
        "Paul: Danke. I'll be fine. Thank you.",
        "Madame Lacoste: It's all right. You don't need to worry about that man.",
        "Jennifer: Is that another feeling of yours?",
        "Madame Lacoste: You should focus on other things right now. I mean, we were talking about your brother, Paul.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, you're right. Uh -- you said that he was in pain. How can that be?",
        "Madame Lacoste: His soul is restless. He brought me to you. I picked up on his energy. His anguish. At first, I didn't know what he was trying to communicate to me or who he was but when I saw you on the television talking about your other brother Will, I could see beyond your words to an even deeper pain. Then it all came together for me. Paul is close, Jennifer. Very close. I can feel him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: So, Paul's spirit is close to me, that's what you're trying to say.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Yes.",
        "Jennifer: And he wants something?",
        "Madame Lacoste: I believe so.",
        "Jennifer: And how much is it going to cost me to find out what he wants?",
        "Madame Lacoste: I have no financial interest here.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, of course not.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Look, you can think I'm a charlatan if you want. I'm used to it. But you know I'm right when I say that you were filled with sadness and remorse that follows you around like a shadow. It fills your dreams. But it's hard for you to talk about, especially to your loved ones.",
        "Jennifer: No, they don't understand.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Of course not. How could they? Paul was a hated man when he died, wasn't he?",
        "Jennifer: By so many people. And they all can't understand why I feel so much guilt.",
        "Madame Lacoste: They want you to be the victim.",
        "Jennifer: No, but they don't understand that Paul's a victim, too. I pushed him to do it.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Do what?",
        "Jennifer: Kill himself.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Your brother committed suicide?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, and it's my fault. I said so many horrible things to him before he died. I called him selfish and hateful. And I told him I would never forgive him. I made him feel worthless and I cut off all hope of reconciliation. And so he took his own life.",
        "Madame Lacoste: It's not your fault.",
        "Jennifer: No, but it is. It is. Don't you see? I pushed him into a corner. And the only way that he felt like he could say he was sorry was by killing himself. Oh, my God, what have I done? [Jennifer sobbing] I should have -- I should have stopped him.",
        "Madame Lacoste: You can let go of that now. It's not your fault. We're going to make things right again. I promise. It's what Paul wants. I know it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I would really like to talk to Paul if I could. I mean, I have so many questions about my mom.",
        "Luke: Uh -- Paul killed himself a few weeks ago.",
        "Jade: That's terrible. Why?",
        "Luke: It's a really long story. And we should think about going. I mean, my dad has a really short fuse with me these days.",
        "Jade: Well, then let's not give him any more reasons to blow up at you then.",
        "Luke: Hey, the most important thing for you to know about Rose is that everyone loved her, especially my mom. She was just a really great person. She had a big heart and she was cool with just about everything.",
        "Jade: I wish I could've met her.",
        "Luke: She would've been really proud of you.",
        "Jade: You don't even know me.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I can tell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Yes, thank you, Joe. It was good to talk to you, too. I will. Bye bye.",
        "Lucinda: Well?",
        "Lily: Well, Joe said that --",
        "Lucinda: Well, well, well?",
        "Lily: Rose did disappear for a few months around the time that Jade was born.",
        "Lucinda: Rose was running away all the time, darling.",
        "Lily: You're just not going to give her the benefit of the doubt?",
        "Lucinda: No! I can't. I've had years of painful experience.",
        "Lily: Well, you heard what Joe said.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, fine. Joe said something, that's perfect. That's just wonderful. And we've got a nun that might not be a nun. An orphanage, and maybe it's not an orphanage. That pretty girl didn't go to a foster home. We have the piece of paper -- I wanna adopt her myself tomorrow.",
        "Lily: I believe her. And I want her to stay.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my darling child. Lily, baby, baby, baby.",
        "Lily: That poor girl, she's got nowhere to go.",
        "Lucinda: Sweetheart, take care, darling. Don't write a new will or anything like that. Keep her at arm's length until we know more about the father and her.",
        "Lily: I think we know all we need to know at this point.",
        "Lucinda: You can hardly ever say that about anybody these days.",
        "Lily: It's Natalie. I think she's coming down with something. I'll be right back.",
        "Lucinda: Please, tell me that you're not suckered in by all this as Lily is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Don't make that about my problems with Nick.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't think we'd be having this conversation, Jack, if Nick wasn't the person who brought me home.",
        "Jack: The guy gets on my nerves! I'm not going to deny it. Especially when he blatantly flirts with you in front of me. And I can't stand the fact that because he's basically co-opted my job, I now have to moonlight as a security guard and that takes me away from you and the kids. But that doesn't bother me half as much as finding out you lied to me.",
        "Carly: For the last time, Jack, I didn't decide to go and look for Will and Gwen until after you went to work. It's not my fault the car broke down! It's not my fault that Nick happened to drive by and offer me a ride! What should I have done? Should I have said no? What choice did I have?",
        "Jack: You could've called me.",
        "Carly: I didn't want to pull you away from work, Jack. That's the whole point! I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: You broke my trust, Carly. Again. And in my book, it doesn't get any worse than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: I'll stay here as long as you need me to keep an eye on Katie.",
        "Katie: See, that's the thing. I don't really think I need anyone to keep their eye on me, 'cause I am fine by myself.",
        "Nick: You don't want to take any chances, though.",
        "Mike: Hey, look. The thing of it, Nick -- you gotta start keeping this place looking a lot less like a frat house.",
        "Nick: Okay, I promise. I'll have this place spic and span by this weekend. I'll keep a good eye on her while you're gone, all right? Between Jack Snyder and me, she's going to be safer than safe.",
        "Mike: What's Jack have to do with it?",
        "Nick: Well, Jack's moonlighting as a security guard over at WOAK. So with me watching her at the home front, Jack will have her back at work.",
        "Mike: Hmm, that's the best news I've heard all night. Although, I doubt Carly would agree. She's going to be spending a lot of time alone now.",
        "Nick: Oh, I wouldn't be worrying about Carly. She's got her nights pretty much covered.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: If you had just leveled with me with what you were gonna do, I could've helped you, Carly. We could've looked for your sister together. And then you wouldn't have needed Nick's help.",
        "Carly: Jack, it wouldn't have made any sense for you to come with me. You're a cop. If we'd found Gwen, you would've had to bring her in, and then she would have hated me even more. And if you decided to keep quiet and not bring her in, you would have gotten into even more trouble at work. I didn't want to put you in that position again.",
        "Jack: It wasn't your choice to make, it was mine.",
        "Carly: Come on, baby. I've already apologized to you, like, ten times. Can we just skip to the making up part? Hmm?",
        "Jack: Don't even try.",
        "Carly: You know, there's no point in you going into to WOAK now. We have the night to be together. We should take advantage of that, don't you think?",
        "Jack: Not this time, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack -- Jack, wait! Jack, wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I think Jade is who she claims to be.",
        "Lucinda: Oh --",
        "Holden: But don't worry, I'm not going to let her take advantage of my family.",
        "Lucinda: I'm not worried about you, darling. I'm worried about Lily. Lily's relationship with Rose was -- well, symbiotic. It was sick. And I'm just afraid that she's going to get all sentimental and squishy and she'll do whatever this girl asks her to do. Please, I want you to get a dna test. Please.",
        "Luke: What are you guys doing out here? It's freezing.",
        "Jade: You must be chilled to the bone. Here, take my scarf.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, darling, that's fine. I'm fine, I have hot blood.",
        "Luke: Hey, Dad, I was telling Jade about your collection of old jazz records. Are they still out in the garage?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, I think they're there.",
        "Luke: Can -- can we go take a look at them?",
        "Holden: Sure. You're a jazz fan?",
        "Jade: Yeah, I like all kinds of music.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, go ahead. Enjoy.",
        "Jade: I will. And it was really nice meeting you. I hope we'll be able to get to know each other better very soon.",
        "Lucinda: I'm sure we will.",
        "Luke: Let's go.",
        "Jade: Okay.",
        "Lucinda: She likes jazz.",
        "Holden: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucinda: Holden, please. Your family has just begun to stabilize itself. Please.",
        "Holden: Lucinda --",
        "Lucinda: Don't -- don't introduce something new that is going to throw everything off balance.",
        "Holden: I'm not worried about Jade. Truth is, I kinda feel sorry for the girl.",
        "Lucinda: Maybe that's exactly what she wants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: How can you make everything right again between Paul and me?",
        "Madame Lacoste: First, talk to me about him a bit. What are the good things you still feel about your brother?",
        "Jennifer: He was loving and caring towards me, always. Even when he kept a horrible secret, he thought he was doing it to protect me. And I'm not trying to justify what he did, but I think that I understand it better now.",
        "Madame Lacoste: What was the secret that he kept?",
        "Jennifer: Why does that matter?",
        "Madame Lacoste: I'm just trying to get a sense of your relationship.",
        "Jennifer: He let me believe that my baby was dead.",
        "Madame Lacoste: And why did he do that?",
        "Jennifer: Because my baby's father is a horrible, horrible man. And Paul thought that by keeping me son out of my life, he would keep this man from hurting me.",
        "Madame Lacoste: There's a certain logic to that, don't you think?",
        "Jennifer: You don't even know him. Why would you defend him?",
        "Madame Lacoste: All I know is that he -- a strong sense that he wants to be forgiven. And I admit, you have every right to be angry. There's no reason for you to feel guilty about that.",
        "Jennifer: You said that you could help me get through the pain. You said you thought that Paul had something he wanted to tell me.",
        "Madame Lacoste: I believe he wants you to stop blaming yourself for his dying.",
        "Jennifer: But that's just your guess, you don't know for sure?",
        "Madame Lacoste: No. The answers don't always come to me at once. Very often, they filter in slowly. But the closer that I can get to you, the closer I can get to Paul. Then I'll know better what he's after.",
        "Jennifer: What are you saying? That you -- that you can channel his spirit?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Spirits are all around us, Jennifer. They speak to us. We just need to listen.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I don't know if I believe that.",
        "Madame Lacoste: It's a lot to ask, I know. But the first step is --",
        "Jennifer: What was that?",
        "Madame Lacoste: I don't know. I may have been wrong about something.",
        "Jennifer: About what?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Your brother. At first, it seemed his communications were coming from the spirit world, but --",
        "Jennifer: But now?",
        "Madame Lacoste: I have a feeling, a very strong feeling, that he may still be alive.",
        "Jennifer: Why would you think Paul is still alive?",
        "Madame Lacoste: I'm not sure. It could be that he's hurt or close to death. He's reaching out. He's trying to get a message to you that he needs your help.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, you need to tell me -- tell me what you saw when you touched my hand.",
        "Madame Lacoste: It was just a feeling.",
        "Jennifer: No, please, tell me -- tell me more.",
        "Madame Lacoste: It's no good. I can't. It's gone. I feel drained. I -- I have to go. I need --",
        "Jennifer: No --",
        "Madame Lacoste: -- To rest.",
        "Jennifer: No, wait. This is it? You just -- you tell me that my brother's alive and then you just go?",
        "Madame Lacoste: I have no control over my gift, Jennifer. If the visions leave, I can't make them -- command them to appear. I have to clear my mind and just wait. If you want to pursue this, call me tomorrow.",
        "Jennifer: I can't believe -- I can't believe you're doing this to me.",
        "Madame Lacoste: I'm sorry. That's the way it must be. Good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You said Carly has her nights covered. How would you know?",
        "Nick: She's got a house full of kids, doesn't she? I mean, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out it keeps a person pretty busy.",
        "Katie: Yeah, that's true. Mike's right, though. Carly's probably missing Jack a lot. It's too bad he has to work so much right now.",
        "Nick: Yeah, it's a shame. All right, I'm gonna get a beer. Anybody want one?",
        "Both: No thanks.",
        "Mike: I think you need to go change into something more comfortable. I will get rid of Nick and then we can say good-bye like we mean it.",
        "Katie: Even though I don't want to say good-bye?",
        "Mike: Neither do I.",
        "Katie: All right, get rid of him as quick as possible.",
        "Mike: I'm on it. [Mike clears his throat] On second thought -- [ Mike whistles ] You need to disappear. I'll pay for a hotel room.",
        "Nick: No, no, no. Don't worry about it. You don't have to pay for the hotel room. Go up there say good-bye to your sweetheart in style. All right? I'll be out of here in no time. All right?",
        "Mike: Thanks, man.",
        "[Nick remembering]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: All right, that's it. Nick Kasnoff can go to hell without my help.",
        "Holden: Jade ran right out in front of the car.",
        "Lucinda: And why would the girl do a crazy thing like that?",
        "Holden: I don't know. I think she was scared, so she ran out into the street. Luke never saw her coming.",
        "Lucinda: None of us did.",
        "Holden: The important thing is, she's okay.",
        "Lucinda: And a near tragedy at the hands of your son. That helps her cause.",
        "Holden: Oh, come on. You don't think she did it on purpose just so we had to save her?",
        "Lucinda: I got to this stage in life where I -- I don't put anything past anyone. Get the DNA.",
        "Holden: All right, I'll talk to Lily about it.",
        "Lucinda: Don't talk to her. Don't talk! Do it! Get it before Lily gets too close to the girl and it's too late.",
        "Lily: Hey. Where's Luke?",
        "Jade: Oh, he's in the garage getting some old albums.",
        "Lily: Ah, Holden's old jazz collection.",
        "Jade: Mm-hmm. You've got some great pictures here.",
        "Lily: Oh, yes.",
        "Jade: My parents -- I mean the ones who raised me -- they really weren't big on family photos.",
        "Lily: I love having them around.",
        "Jade: I know. I can see. You look so beautiful in this one.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you. What? Are you thinking that you can't believe how much I look my sister.",
        "Jade: No, that's not it. It's -- never mind.",
        "Lily: What? No, no, what is it?",
        "Jade: Can I ask you a personal question?",
