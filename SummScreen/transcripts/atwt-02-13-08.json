        "Vienna and Henry continue to butt heads about his gambling so she is not happy to see Gray show up at their diner. Matt shows up at Casey's house, asks about Adam, and eyes a picture of Tom and Margo. Vienna asks questions of Gray, as he continues to shamelessly flirt with her. Meg is cleaning out her office when Craig sees her throw away a picture of Paul prompting him to tell her that he hopes that means they still have a chance. Meg is stunned that he would still think that. Lucinda continues to struggle with her feelings of guilt over Dusty's death. Paul tells Lucinda he has a plan for Craig that she may want to get in on. Meg tells Craig that they will never be a family because his own family even wants nothing to do with him, which says something about him as a person. Craig promises he will never give up on trying to find Lucy and Johnny. Margo overhears Matt's voice and thinks it is Adam. Matt pretends to be a friend of Casey's from Oakdale University that had to drop out because his family had no money. Casey is not pleased with Matt's story. Paul and Emily meet up. Henry is getting annoyed with Gray and tells him to leave. Gray pushes his buttons after he offers him in on a poker game. Craig lashes out at Meg. Emily calls Craig with a proposal. Margo wants Matt to convince Casey to go back to school after Matt pretends to be excited about school. Matt alludes to the fact that he doesn't have a home so Margo and Tom offer him a room in their house, much to Casey's chagrin. Meg learns from Paul that he owns Worldwide now, as he offers her a job with him. Meg reminds him that they aren't getting back together, and while Paul pretends to accept this; he just thinks they will make a good team. Emily pretends to have information for Craig \u0096 for a price. She tells him that Lucinda talked to Lucy and will talk to her again today at 3PM. Henry shows up to play poker with Gray, as Vienna worries where he went. Henry loses, but then wins and wants to leave, but Gray goads him into one more hand. Henry loses in heartbreaking fashion and realizes he can't cover the bet. He will give Gray the diner, but Gray has other ideas and makes an Indecent Proposal. Meg turns Paul down on his offer. Paul sees their picture in Meg's trash and takes it. Craig listens while Lucinda supposedly talks to Lucy in Barbados and immediately books a flight. Casey is upset with Matt; if his mom finds out that they were in prison together, she will kill them. Matt promises he will be long gone before then. Henry tells Gray where to put his offer and goes home to Vienna, who is sure he has been gambling, but Henry tells her that he was getting Swedish dog biscuits. Vienna feels terrible that she doubted him. Matt wonders since Casey got his money so fast, if there is more where that came from? Lucinda tells Emily and Paul that she sent Craig on a wild goose chase and since she has contacts all over, she can keep this up for a while. Craig is boarding a flight to Barbados. Paul wonders what Emily wants out of this plan? Paul and Meg both think of one another. Emily tells Paul that Meg will never forgive him, but Paul answers \"never say never.\""

        "Henry: I'm feeling frisky. What do you say, we close up a little early, and do something wicked?",
        "Vienna: Ooh, I like the sound of that. What do you have in mind, Mr. Frisky?",
        "Henry: Well, I've got my eye on a filly named Sweet Justice and there's 50 bucks burning a hole in the register, so I was thinking, why don't we --",
        "Vienna: No. I mean it, Henry. No more gambling! Now have a bite of my pepparkakor and forget all about those silly horses.",
        "Henry: Hey, no -- no, thank you.",
        "Vienna: What? But I thought you loved my pepparkakor. I -- oh, I -- I see what's going on. You're tired of me, aren't you?",
        "Henry: Oh, Liebchen, no!",
        "Vienna: Well, you say that I'm irresistible and that you love and adore every single inch of me. But that's not enough, is it? Living a conventional life and running a diner is too boring. You want adventure and action and danger --",
        "Henry: Vienna, Sweetheart, you are -- all the excitement that I need.",
        "Vienna: Well --",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Spicing things up every now and then, you know, doesn't sound too bad.",
        "Henry: I like the sound of that.",
        "Gray: Henry! It's good to see you again.",
        "Henry: Yeah --",
        "Gray: So, this is the famous Al's diner that I've heard so much about.",
        "Henry: Yeah, best food in Oakdale. You won't be disappointed.",
        "Gray: No, I don't think I will be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You got your money. What are you doing here?",
        "Matt: You can't get rid of me that easy.",
        "Casey: This isn't a good time --",
        "Matt: Dude. I'm hurt. I thought we were friends, Man.",
        "Casey: Look, I'm sorry but I cannot do this here.",
        "Matt: Oh, you don't want an ex-con hanging around. I get it.",
        "Casey: No, no, it's not like that --",
        "Matt: Hey, no worries, Man. No worries. You've got a nice place to live, you've got your old life back. You don't need complications, Dude. I'll see you around.",
        "Casey: No -- no, come in, it's freezing out there.",
        "Matt: Are you sure?",
        "Casey: Yeah, my parents are at work. It's cool. You want a soda?",
        "Matt: Yeah, sure.",
        "Casey: What do you like?",
        "Matt: I'll take whatever you've got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Why did you invite him here?",
        "Henry: Well, we have a sign that says, come in, we're open. It seems to be working.",
        "Vienna: I don't want your gambling buddies here. This is a family restaurant.",
        "Henry: Sweetie, he's probably just going to have a quick lunch and be on his way. I will find out what he wants, okay?",
        "Vienna: No, I will deal with this. What would you like?",
        "Gray: I don't know. It all looks so good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Who's this dude?",
        "Casey: Adam. My brother.",
        "Matt: I don't ever remember you mentioning him. You two close?",
        "Casey: We were. Not any more.",
        "Matt: What happened?",
        "Casey: It's a long story and it didn't end very well. Let's just leave it at that.",
        "Matt: That bad, huh?",
        "Casey: Yeah -- hey, come on, I'm getting reacquainted with my game system. Do you want to lose?",
        "Matt: You are going to regret that invitation -- I am the master.",
        "Casey: You wish!",
        "Matt: You wish? Where is it?",
        "Margo: Hey, Casey, I'm home!",
        "Matt: I thought we were going to be burning --",
        "Margo: Adam?",
        "Matt: How do you start it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lucinda remembering]",
        "Dusty: So what's in it for you?",
        "Lucinda: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Dusty: Chris's champion. Allowing memo 21 to move forward. There's got to be something in it for you.",
        "Lucinda: Chris's champion? I always want what's best for Memorial and for Oakdale. You tell me, what else could there be?",
        "Dusty: The fallout from this isn't going to be pretty. I hope you're ready for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I wasn't ready, Darling. I'm sorry. It should never have happened.",
        "Paul: Lucinda, are you talking to yourself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, it looks today might not be such a bad day after all.",
        "Meg: Give it up, Craig. I signed the papers. Worldwide belongs to Lucinda now. You'll never get it back.",
        "Craig: It's not the corporation that I want to get back, Meg.",
        "Meg: You're hopeless.",
        "Craig: Oh, I see you finally put Paul Ryan in his place. Well, that's a good sign.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You don't look so hot.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah? Thanks a lot. Thanks.",
        "Paul: Oh, I'm sorry. You'll bounce back, I'm sure. You always do.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah, I'll bounce back. Sure. Dusty's not going to be bouncing back anytime soon.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, that's not your fault. I'm glad you're okay. You and Lily came close to losing your own lives.",
        "Lucinda: I'm sorry Lily had to suffer because of all of this. Evan Walsh, he used his name and my reputation for that damn research project. I was helpless. I couldn't stop him.",
        "Paul: No, what could you do?",
        "Lucinda: I could have -- I could have been more suspicious. Dusty was. Of course, he paid for it.",
        "Paul: Look, I think it's terrible that Dusty is dead, but you didn't put the needle in his arm. Evan Walsh did that. Now, Evan Walsh is dead, too. So --",
        "Lucinda: It's a terrible blow for the hospital. It's reputation, for heaven's sake. Good thing, Bob Hughes, he's going to recover. That's the only bright spot in this whole tragedy --",
        "Paul: Actually, you know what? There is -- there is one other bright spot. You got what you wanted.",
        "Lucinda: Huh?",
        "Paul: Worldwide -- well, Worldwide is yours again.",
        "Lucinda: I guess I've got you to blame for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Are you spying on me?",
        "Craig: Oh, quite the contrary. I had no idea you were here. I certainly didn't know I was going to get this kind of wonderful reception.",
        "Meg: This has nothing to do with you.",
        "Craig: Actually, no, you're wrong about that. And a picture speaks 1,000 words, and that picture tells me, I still have a chance.",
        "Meg: You don't give up, do you?",
        "Craig: You know me better than that, Meg. No, I'm never going to give up on us.",
        "Meg: There is no us, Craig. There never was and there never will be.",
        "Craig: You're wrong. We had something special. You know it and so do I.",
        "Meg: That doesn't change who you are. The only person you really care about is you.",
        "Craig: Well, that might have been true before you came into my life, but you changed me. You made me a better man.",
        "Meg: Yeah, you know what? Even I'm not a miracle worker.",
        "Craig: Don't underestimate yourself. You could still make me the man you want in your life.",
        "Meg: It's too late, Craig. Like I said, leave me the hell alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I thought you'd be celebrating. I thought you'd be thrilled to get Worldwide back.",
        "Lucinda: Oh yeah? At what price?",
        "Paul: At what price? Craig is destroyed. That's -- that's priceless.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah, I would've thought that. And in fact, I did think that once. I would've done anything -- moved heaven and earth -- to get my company back.",
        "Paul: Well, you've succeeded.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm such a success then why do I feel like such a dismal failure?",
        "Paul: What if I told you that I could make everything better? I just might have a plan that could solve both our problems.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, it's very interesting.",
        "Paul: Great. Glad you think so. So, it's settled then.",
        "Lucinda: Hold on a minute. Just because I like it, that doesn't mean I'm going to go along with it.",
        "Paul: Come on, Lucinda -- it's a win-win.",
        "Lucinda: Unless Craig manages to outsmart us, as he's done in the past.",
        "Paul: What if I told you that I could make Craig Montgomery disappear?",
        "Lucinda: Now you're losing me, Darling. Because the end of the world would come and Craig would be creepy-crawling out of the baseboards.",
        "Paul: No. The time is now. The time is now. He's lost Meg, he's lost Worldwide, he's vulnerable now. The time is now.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah? You want to take advantage of him while he's down?",
        "Paul: What? I mean, unless that offends your newfound high moral standards.",
        "Lucinda: No -- no. I can make an exception in this case. Sure I can, if it means getting Craig out of Oakdale for good.",
        "Paul: Great. Then I say, let's go for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You can't have me, Craig! I'm not some kind of business acquisition you can just snap up like a hostile takeover.",
        "Craig: Oh, I never thought you were that easy, but you were always worth the challenge.",
        "Meg: You know, you are delusional if you think you're going to get me back.",
        "Craig: I learned from my mistakes, and I'm only asking for a chance to prove that. We can still be together, Meg. A family.",
        "Meg: You're not exactly the ideal family man, Craig. Your oldest son is dead. Your daughter, Lucy, took your youngest son away from you. She knew from painful experiences what a disaster of a father you are. So, if she can't trust you, why should I?",
        "Craig: You're right. I have lost everyone that is most precious to me, and I'm not going to let that happen again. I have not given up on getting Lucy and Johnny back. I am not giving up on you, Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Adam! Oh, Casey? What's going on?",
        "Casey: Mom, I didn't think you would be home so early.",
        "Margo: Well, I guess not. Um -- who's this?",
        "Matt: I'm Matt. Matt O'Connor. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Margo: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Matt O'Connor. I don't think Casey's ever mentioned you.",
        "Casey: Matt and I ran into each other this morning --",
        "Matt: Casey and I were buddies at Oakdale U.",
        "Margo: Oh, is that so?",
        "Matt: Yeah. Casey never mentioned me?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Casey: Matt was a transfer student. He wasn't in school with me for long.",
        "Margo: Oh.",
        "Matt: I've been trying to talk Casey into going back.",
        "Margo: How's that going for you?",
        "Matt: It's a tough sell.",
        "Margo: Yeah, tell me about it.",
        "Matt: I keep saying, don't be a quitter, Casey.",
        "Margo: Don't be a quitter, Casey!",
        "Casey: So, Mom, what are you doing home in the middle of the day?",
        "Margo: Well, even the Chief of Detectives gets time off for good behavior.",
        "Matt: Wow. Casey, you didn't tell me your mom was such a big deal.",
        "Margo: It's not such a big deal. It's actually kind of a drag.",
        "Matt: You probably need some down time. I'll get out of your way.",
        "Casey: Yeah, catch you later, Matt.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no -- stay, stay! Stay for lunch. We've got plenty of food.",
        "Matt: Sounds great. I'm really starving. Casey, is that cool?",
        "Margo: It's cool with Casey.",
        "Casey: Yeah, sure.",
        "Margo: Okay, Honey, why don't you get the rest of the groceries out of the car, and I will get to know Matt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: So, what can I get for you, Mr. Gerard?",
        "Gray: Gray. What do you recommend?",
        "Vienna: Everything is good. Everyone loves my pepparkakor.",
        "Gray: Beautiful and a cook -- Henry is a lucky man.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. I'm the lucky one. Henry is smart, generous and faithful, but unfortunately, he also love high stakes games. So, if you're here to corrupt him, I won't let that happen. Henry has better things to do than playing games, unless it's with me, of course.",
        "Gray: You have my word. I do not want to get on your bad side. So tell me, what is a beautiful woman like you doing working in a diner?",
        "Vienna: Well, Henry and I own this establishment. Not only am I the cook, I'm the waitress and hostess, and I make sure our customers are happy.",
        "Gray: I'm sure you're very good at what you do.",
        "Vienna: So, what would you like?",
        "Gray: You know, I really can't decide.",
        "Vienna: Try the pepparkakor, you can't go wrong.",
        "Gray: I think I will. I think I'm in very good hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Hey Casey, did you pick a major yet?",
        "Casey: Nope.",
        "Margo: Nope! Wouldn't think of it! Doesn't want to go back! Even though his dad and I want him to, and we'd cover all the costs.",
        "Matt: Ah, he's hopeless. You know, my parents actually can't afford to help out. That's why I had to drop out to save up some money, but I can't wait to go back.",
        "Margo: Well, I hope you can convince Casey of that, too. If you can, his dad and I would mightily grateful. Speak of the devil.",
        "Tom: Uh-oh. Talking about me again?",
        "Margo: Only good things, Baby. Come on in. This is Casey's friend, Matt O'Connor.",
        "Tom: Pleased to meet you, Matt.",
        "Matt: How are you doing?",
        "Tom: Hey, Case.",
        "Casey: I didn't know you would be home, too. If you guys want some time, me and Matt will head out --",
        "Margo: Whoa, Casey. We're so happy that you're back home, would you just stay? I asked Matt to join us for lunch.",
        "Tom: Oh, Matt. You're about to discover that Margo's cooking is infamous.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well Tom burns toast.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Matt: I'm sure it'll be great. It's been a while since I've had a home-cooked meal.",
        "Casey: Let's go finish our game before lunch.",
        "Matt: Yeah, let's go.",
        "Tom: That's kind of nice to see Casey getting back in the swing of things. But who's that kid?",
        "Margo: Oh, it's somebody he went to Oakdale U. with. He seems like a really nice guy.",
        "Tom: And, what's on your mind?",
        "Margo: It's just when I walked in here, Honey, and I heard the kids -- kids. Just for a second, I though --",
        "Tom: Yeah, I know. Adam.",
        "Margo: I miss him.",
        "Tom: Yeah, me too, Baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: So, what are you doing in Oakdale?",
        "Gray: I'm exploring new business opportunities. Investing. So, you are clearly a woman with an eye for the finer things in life. And you've made a success of this place.",
        "Vienna: Thank you. It hasn't been easy, but it's been a labor of love.",
        "Gray: You know, your eyes sparkle when you're excited. Most women require fine jewelry or furs to achieve that effect. But with you, it comes naturally.",
        "Henry: Excuse us. Something's burning.",
        "Vienna: Oh no.",
        "Henry: It's not the stove -- it is me. I thought you were trying to get rid of him, not get him to propose.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry, you're jealous. That's so sweet. But I would never look at any other man. I only have eyes for you.",
        "Henry: That may be true, but Gray's eyes have practically been undressing you, and I'm not going to let him get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi, thanks for meeting me here.",
        "Emily: You were very cryptic on the phone. What's going on? Ooh, how very cloak and dagger of you. You know, you're lucky I'm a sucker for a good mystery.",
        "Paul: Well then, you're going to love this. It's got a great surprise ending.",
        "Emily: Okay, tell me more.",
        "Paul: Okay, I'll be blunt. Emily, I really need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Thanks for coming. You can pay on the way out.",
        "Gray: No, I'm not finished yet, Henry.",
        "Henry: Yeah, you are.",
        "Gray: I was enjoying getting to know your lovely wife.",
        "Henry: Actually, Gray, we're not married. But I can assure you, our bond is unbreakable.",
        "Gray: Why not tie the knot? I mean, if I had a woman like Vienna, marriage would only be the beginning.",
        "Henry: Yeah, it's a little unconventional, I agree, be we couldn't be more committed to each other, okay?",
        "Gray: It's a shame the lady doesn't play poker. She'd be a welcome addition to our table.",
        "Henry: Yeah, don't hold your breath. We have better things to do.",
        "Gray: Aw, that's too bad, Henry. I'm on my way to a game right now. I was hoping maybe you'd join me. You did rather well the other day. I was thinking maybe I'd recoup some of my losses.",
        "Henry: Maybe some other time.",
        "Gray: Yeah, you don't want to upset Vienna -- causing trouble in your non- marriage could get tricky.",
        "Vienna: What did he say to make you get smoke out of your ears?",
        "Henry: Nothing, nothing -- I just -- I remembered that I -- we need doggie biscuits.",
        "Vienna: No, Pepper can wait --",
        "Henry: No, no! Won't take me, but a second. I'll be right back, Sweetheart, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Lucy made a huge mistake when she took Johnny from me. Not a day goes by that I don't think about him. Do you know that he must be talking non-stop by now. I mean, can you imagine what it would be like, not to know the sound of your own child's voice? Not to know what his laugh sounds like? There is nothing that you can say to hurt me, that can possibly compare to the pain I feel in losing my son.",
        "Meg: Your own daughter ran away from you so she could protect her little brother. What does that tell you about yourself?",
        "Craig: Oh, get off your high horse, Meg. What the hell do you know about love, or about honesty? You couldn't even keep your wedding vows.",
        "Meg: I tried to love you.",
        "Craig: It was just a little too complicated, wasn't it? Seeing as you were still in love -- you still are in love -- with Paul Ryan. Whack job, who's even more manipulative and controlling than I am. Good luck with that. [Cell phone rings] What do you want?",
        "Emily: Meet me at Yo's in ten minutes.",
        "Craig: Why on earth would I do that?",
        "Emily: Trust me. You'll be very interested in what I have to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, Matt really enjoyed his criminal law course when he was at O.U. Casey, you know, it's not too early for you to start thinking what courses you want to take when you go back.",
        "Casey: Actually, since I'm not going back, it's way too early.",
        "Tom: You know, keep an open mind, because you can't get very far these days without one or two degrees.",
        "Matt: You know, since I had to drop out, I really miss it. I can't wait until I get the money to go back.",
        "Tom: What are you going to study when you get there?",
        "Matt: I actually plan on going to law school.",
        "Tom: Really? Well, Oakdale U. has a great program. That's where I went.",
        "Matt: Well, it's the best. It's not cheap. You know, between tuition and rent, even with loans, it'll take me a while to save up enough.",
        "Margo: Well, why, where are you living?",
        "Matt: I'm actually crashing on a friend's couch. I guess you could say I'm homeless.",
