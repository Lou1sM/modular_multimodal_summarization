        "Henry: I'll pick him up and bring him to the wedding myself. Can he be ready in five? I'll be there. Mike, Mike -- hey, how do I look so far? Huh? Hey, would you check on this bower and make sure it doesn't collapse? I had no idea wisteria could be so heavy.",
        "Mike: Henry, you're vibrating.",
        "Henry: Well, it's Katie's wedding day, Mike. Everything needs to be perfect.",
        "Mike: All right, then settle down. Otherwise you're going to pass out at the altar. Okay, man? Breathe. In and out.",
        "Henry: Breathe -- hey, that's a good idea. Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go. Okay.",
        "Mike: Where? You're supposed to be getting married soon.",
        "Henry: I will be back. I will be back. Just check on the bower and make sure that the wisteria doesn't block anyone's view, okay?",
        "Katie: I know I was wrong. I know that now. I just -- I need a chance to make it up to you. Can you give me that chance?",
        "Mike: All right. Groom here. Katie there.",
        "Katie: What Henry and I have is strong and steady and nothing can kill it. Yeah, I'm gonna marry Henry and if I'm lucky, I will get to spend the rest of my life making him happy.",
        "Jennifer: Mike? Penny for your thoughts. Hell, I'll even go up to a dollar.",
        "Margo: Hey -- is Henry here?",
        "Mike: He's out running errands.",
        "Margo: Okay. Come on. Coast is clear. Come, come, come.",
        "Katie: Oh, my -- oh, this is so beautiful. Mike, did you do all this?",
        "Mike: I just -- I just hammered the nails. Henry was the one who masterminded the whole thing. He seemed to know exactly how he wanted it to be.",
        "Katie: It's beautiful.",
        "Mike: Yeah. Yeah, it looks really good.",
        "Margo: Come on, we're here to hang your dress up, okay? Come on.",
        "Katie: Yeah, my dress, right.",
        "Margo: Let's go.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: What exactly was that?",
        "Mike: That was just Katie liking how everything looked and me being glad.",
        "Jennifer: Funny, you sure don't look glad. In fact, you look downright morose. Maybe we should talk about why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Acacia: And this is our newest addition, a mud bath.",
        "Dusty: Mud?",
        "Sierra: Yeah, very interesting, huh?",
        "Acacia: At Casa Lodo, we like to offer our couples the opportunity to detoxify together. We find that cleansing can become spiritual as well as physical.",
        "Sierra: Hmm, intriguing. [Phone ringing] Oh, excuse me. Hello?",
        "Craig: Sierra, do you have a minute?",
        "Sierra: Craig, I'm in a meeting.",
        "Craig: I want to talk to you about this proposal for Street Jeans.",
        "Dusty: Hey, that mud's hot!",
        "Craig: Is that your good friend Dusty?",
        "Sierra: Yeah. He's in the treatment room with me.",
        "Craig: Treatment? Are you all right?",
        "Sierra: I'm great. But this proposal is supposed to be in writing. So why don't you put it all down and I'll read it the second I get back from California. All right?",
        "Kevin: Mr. Montgomery? Kevin Mahoney, Mahoney Artist Management.",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah, yeah. I talked to your assistant.",
        "Kevin: She passed the message on. What can I do for you?",
        "Craig: Well, sit down, sit down. You've heard of Street Jeans, the clothing company, new company -- but backed by lots of old money.",
        "Kevin: I've seen the ads -- \"Vogue,\" \"Tre Chic\" -- it's good stuff.",
        "Craig: Thank you. We're moving into a major TV campaign. We're trying to brand Street Jeans as something -- something more than urban wear.",
        "Kevin: Very nice. Where do I come in?",
        "Craig: We want your client, Scott Reeves, and the whole Blue County Band.",
        "Kevin: Pass. Scott doesn't do commercials.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm sure he doesn't. But I've got some production ideas and figures here you may want to look over so you know what we're really talking about. You may want to run these by your client, see what Scott thinks.",
        "Kevin: Well, no promises, but I'll talk to Scott this afternoon. I'll run it up the flagpole and see if he salutes.",
        "Craig: All right. Aye, aye then. I look forward to hearing from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I thought baths were supposed to make you clean.",
        "Acacia: Don't confuse this with the stuff in your backyard. Our mud is a pesticide-free mixture of white clay, Irish peat, and hot spring mineral water, thoroughly cleaned between treatments, of course.",
        "Dusty: You clean the dirt. That's a new one, huh?",
        "Sierra: You sound like you've never been to a spa before in your life.",
        "Dusty: Well, I haven't. This is my first time.",
        "Sierra: Well, then book him a treatment.",
        "Dusty: In this stuff?",
        "Acacia: Oh, she's right. You should experience the mud.",
        "Dusty: I don't think so!",
        "Sierra: Why not? It would be relaxing. You know what? Put us both down for the next available appointment.",
        "Acacia: You got it.",
        "Dusty: No, miss, excuse me. Excuse --",
        "Sierra: No, I'm sorry. You know, you are not going to weasel your way out of this. If you expect to sell the spa experience to both men and women, you have to be willing to try it yourself.",
        "Dusty: It's not my thing.",
        "Sierra: Dusty, come on. Men have come a long way. And this whole spa franchise was your idea. And you know what? If you want me to go along with it? I think you need to put up or shut up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I just have to check on a few things.",
        "Alison: I thought Rafael said he locked up.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, he hasn't been here long enough to know, like, you gotta like jiggle the thermostat. And like, the bar faucet -- if you don't twist it real tight, it's going to drip all night. What?",
        "Alison: You're going to make a good manager. Just do what you have to do. We've got some time to kill before Katie's wedding anyway.",
        "Aaron: You know what? You're right. And Ali --",
        "Alison: Yeah?",
        "Aaron: We're all alone.",
        "Alison: No Celia.",
        "Aaron: Mm-hmm. And no Rafi. And no doctor's orders. Come here.",
        "Alison: I don't know, I don't know. When I said that we had some time to kill, I didn't mean that much time.",
        "Aaron: Ali, come on. So if we're a little late just a little bit, who cares? Katie's always late. Watching you the last two weeks has been torture, Ali. I love you so much.",
        "Alison: I love you, too. And boy, am I ready!",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Emily, you were about to tell us who drugged you.",
        "Rosanna: After you've slipped in the service entrance, I want you to look in the attic, find Cabot's stocking and put it in a conspicuous place.",
        "Rosanna: Once you've purchased the doll, you understand where to leave it? You understand what you have to do?",
        "Emily: I understand. I can't do this.",
        "Tom: What do you mean?",
        "Emily: I can't do this. I can't think. I have to go clear my head.",
        "Hal: Emily, Emily!",
        "Jessica: Emily, you can't walk out during deposition!",
        "Paul: Emily, what happened?",
        "Emily: Tom, I can't do this. Please.",
        "Paul: Why did you freeze up in there?",
        "Emily: Please, please.",
        "Tom: You were fine with it a few minutes ago. In fact, you couldn't wait to get started. What changed?",
        "Jessica: Emily, we have you on record as saying you don't remember who drugged you and there's no real evidence that you were drugged.",
        "Paul: There's plenty of evidence, Jessica. This whole thing reeks of my mother.",
        "Emily: Stop! Please just stop it!",
        "Hal: Everybody, just back off, will you? Honey, it's okay. It's all right. Just a couple more questions, that's all.",
        "Emily: I can't.",
        "Hal: Yes, you can. It's our one chance to get Barbara out of our lives for good.",
        "Rosanna: What is taking them so long?",
        "Barbara: Oh, Emily. She's such a drama queen. But she does appear to remember what you wanted her to, doesn't she? Another minute or two, she'll tell the D.A. that she's the one who did all those things.",
        "Rosanna: I hope so.",
        "Barbara: You still have doubt?",
        "Rosanna: Well, what if I didn't have enough time to make an impact on her? She's going to remember you drugging her, not me.",
        "Barbara: Rosanna, if that happens, James will not be a very happy boy.",
        "Rosanna: Don't you think I know that?",
        "Barbara: Listen, the truth is, even if she does remember you, she still may point the finger at me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, great. Let's just try to be positive, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I'm the one facing jail time here.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, you're not gonna go to jail. I guarantee it.",
        "Barbara: Your guarantee -- that's very comforting.",
        "Rosanna: Don't push me, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I'm just trying to be realistic.",
        "Rosanna: Nothing is going to stop me from getting my child back.",
        "Barbara: I used to be like you. I used to think that a mother's love could accomplish anything.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then you should thank your lucky stars that I still do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Time out.",
        "Aaron: No, wait. No, no. Ali, this is our moment.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Aaron: We've been waiting forever for this. Come on. What's wrong?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I just don't want our first time to be on a barroom floor.",
        "Aaron: It's our second time and I don't care.",
        "Alison: But it's our first time in love. Shouldn't this be special?",
        "Aaron: Everything we do is special.",
        "Alison: That's so sweet. And I want this just as much as you do, it's just -- it's just --",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Alison: Well, we've been through so much. And we've learned that it's not enough to be lovers. But you have to be friends, too.",
        "Aaron: And we are. We are.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know. I want to make love to you so bad. I just want it to be as beautiful as our friendship.",
        "Aaron: Then it will be.",
        "Alison: Really? You don't mind waiting?",
        "Aaron: I hate waiting. But not as much as I love you.",
        "Alison: We've got to go.",
        "Aaron: Katie's wedding?",
        "Alison: Yeah, before I rip your clothes off with my teeth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Thank God you guys are here! I was afraid the guests were going to have to dance to workout tapes.",
        "Casey: Sorry, man, we ran into some traffic. Where do you want us to set up?",
        "Henry: Right over there. You did get everything that I asked for, right? All of Katie's favorite songs?",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah, yeah. What I couldn't get in stores, I just got off the net.",
        "Henry: The net? What are you crazy? Do you want the feds in here, arresting the entire wedding party?",
        "Casey: Henry, chill, man! All the tunes are paid for. We're good.",
        "Henry: They're paid for. Of course they are. I will chill. I will breathe. I will breathe.",
        "Will: Uh, dude, if we're get the rest of the stuff --",
        "Casey: Oh, you got plans. All right, come on.",
        "Henry: Thanks, guys. Thanks.",
        "Casey: What time does the movie start?",
        "Will: 7:00.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Henry: Hey!",
        "Craig: Oh! And where is my little serial bride sister?",
        "Henry: Oh, she's gonna be so happy you're here, Craig.",
        "Craig: Well, I sure so hope so. You know, not all of her engagements end in actual weddings. You should be flattered.",
        "Henry: That's a lovely sentiment, Craig. Lovely.",
        "Craig: Congratulations. Is Jennifer Munson around? I heard she was going to be here.",
        "Henry: What? There's going to be a scene, is there? Tell me there's not gonna be a scene.",
        "Craig: No, no, no scene. Just tell me where she is.",
        "Henry: Probably with Kasnoff. Mike.",
        "Craig: Mike Kasnoff?",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm, my best man.",
        "Craig: Oh, cozy.",
        "Henry: Yeah, we go way back. We have a lot in common.",
        "Craig: Both love Katie.",
        "Henry: That's right. And we both want her to be happy. Which is why he did all this work in here so that she could have a beautiful wedding.",
        "Craig: Oh. You sure he's okay with you marrying Katie?",
        "Henry: Why not? He's in love with Jennifer.",
        "Craig: You sure?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Oh, dammit!",
        "Jennifer: Hurt?",
        "Mike: You have no idea.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, I think I do. When Jordan and Rosanna slept together --",
        "Mike: I didn't mean like that.",
        "Jennifer: Really?",
        "Mike: Yes, really. I'm fine.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. It's just odd. You know, a girl that you used to be engaged to is marrying someone else today.",
        "Mike: Jen, you know I care about Katie. You know, it's starting to look like her and Henry have really found something good.",
        "Jennifer: Who are you trying to convince? Me or you?",
        "Craig: Ah, Jennifer! Good news. Mike.",
        "Jennifer: Craig, I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Craig: I just talked to Kevin Mahoney, Blue County's agent. Things are good.",
        "Jennifer: Is Scott Reeves going to meet with us?",
        "Mike: I'm going to get a band-aid. I'll be right back.",
        "Craig: Kevin loves the Street Jeans.",
        "Jennifer: Is Scott Reeves going to meet us?",
        "Craig: Kevin is going to call us back and say yes any minute.",
        "Henry: Mike. Thank goodness, Mike. I lost a stud.",
        "Mike: You're getting married today. All the women in America are losing a stud.",
        "Henry: You're my best man. Will you fix this? Please, please?",
        "Mike: You know, you shouldn't be running errands anyway.",
        "Henry: I had to pick up a very special guest, and he's a little high maintenance.",
        "Mike: Who is it?",
        "Henry: A surprise for Katie. Well, my lips are sealed. Don't ask. My God. Look at that. That's perfect. What would I do without you, huh?",
        "Mike: Oh, you'd survive.",
        "Henry: Mike -- you know, next to Katie, you're the best friend I never had.",
        "Mike: If you start blubbering, I'm outta here.",
        "Henry: It's hard not to. Some things -- some things need to be said. You're a good man, Mike.",
        "Mike: If I was a good man, I -- never mind.",
        "Henry: Looking at the altar and wondering, \"what if?\"",
        "Mike: Let's not do this.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry, my friend. We don't have a choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: 64 -- don't think I don't know why you're having me count. So I won't talk about anything else.",
        "Katie: There's nothing else to talk about.",
        "Margo: Other than the fact that you're about to become Mrs. Henry Coleman.",
        "Katie: He thought of everything, Margo. When I saw that altar, I almost cried.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well who'd have thought he'd get wisteria this time of year?",
        "Katie: Yeah, 'cause that's Henry. He remembered it and thought about it because I told him once that when I was little, I used to dream about living under a bower of wisteria.",
        "Margo: All right, fine. So he's starting this marriage off by fulfilling that dream.",
        "Katie: Not just that dream, all of my dreams.",
        "Margo: Honey, that's a pretty tall order for any man to fill. What if he can't deliver?",
        "Katie: Everything is going to be fine, Margo. I love Henry.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, Katie, I was there when you walked in and you saw Mike standing there by the altar. And you know what?",
        "Katie: I have to get into my gown.",
        "Margo: You have never looked at Henry Coleman the way you just looked at Mike. Baby, you don't have to go through with this.",
        "Katie: I want to.",
        "Margo: Why? Because you think that this marriage will fill some sort of hole in your heart? That's not possible. So unless you find a new heart, you'd better do the right thing and call this off.",

        "Sierra: How do you feel?",
        "Dusty: I feel like a spoon in yesterday's oatmeal.",
        "Sierra: Why don't you try to relax?",
        "Dusty: I am. I am relaxed.",
        "Sierra: Well, close your eyes.",
        "Dusty: What do you want? You want me to fall asleep in here?",
        "Sierra: Just shut your eyes. Come on. Okay. Okay, just imagine that the soft, warm walls are mother earth. No, no, better yet -- make it the womb.",
        "Dusty: You're crazy! You know that? I can't take too much of this new age stuff. You gotta take it easy.",
        "Sierra: It's not new age. You know, this goes way back to the Indians.",
        "Dusty: Look what happened to them.",
        "Sierra: Look what's happening to you. Don't you feel relaxed?",
        "Dusty: I do feel a bit restful, yes.",
        "Acacia: Ready for your facials?",
        "Dusty: Facials?",

        "Barbara: Then start looking guilty. Here they coming.",
        "Tom: Okay. We're ready to resume, Emily.",
        "Jessica: Emily, I'd like to remind you, you are under oath. And the penalty for perjury is very strict.",
        "Tom: I've already gone over that, Jess.",
        "Jessica: Yes, but the witness has made some statements that have been less than reassuring. I just want to make sure Emily is acutely aware of the consequences of false testimony.",
        "Emily: I plan on telling the truth.",
        "Tom: Good. Let's begin where you left off. Can you recall who drugged you?",
        "Rosanna: Maybe we should stop. Emily seems stressed.",
        "Rosanna: You understand what you have to do?",
        "Emily: This can't be! This can't be right!",
        "Tom: What, Emily?",
        "Emily: I was wrong. Barbara didn't drug me. She didn't have anything to do with it.",

        "Katie: I want to marry Henry, Margo. He loves me. All of me. And I can count on him. Not just for the small things, but the big things, too -- like loyalty. Henry would never lie to me, he would never cheat on me. And most importantly, he would never leave me. And I haven't always had that in my life.",
        "Margo: All right. Okay, all right.",
        "Katie: I am the most important person in the world to him, Margo.",
        "Margo: I know, Katie. But --",

        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Katie: Thanks. Now, I need to get dressed. Don't want to keep my groom waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You're getting married to Katie and I'm your best man. Period.",
        "Henry: She was the love of your life, mike. You were supposed to go down the aisle together.",
        "Mike: I loved Katie once, but I'm in love with Jennifer now.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, but we both know how this started, hmm? Let's face it. What we don't know is how it's going to end.",
        "Mike: It's going to end with people throwing birdseed or confetti, or whatever people throw these days.",
        "Henry: I hope so. I hope it does. I just -- I need you to understand something, okay? [Henry sighs] I'm willing to step aside if there's someone Katie that loves more, someone that loves her in return.",
        "Mike: Are you asking me to stop your wedding? 'Cause I won't do that.",
        "Henry: I'm asking you to help me make her happy. Because, for some reason -- I do not understand why -- her happiness is my life's purpose.",
        "Reverend MacKenzie: Excellent. We have a groom and a best man ready. So can I assume there is a bride somewhere waiting in the wings? I cannot tarry. I have another wedding to perform.",
        "Henry: Absolutely. She's just changing into her gown, reverend. There's nothing to worry about. We're right on schedule.",
        "Reverend MacKenzie: So this is the altar? Rather unconventional, isn't it?",
        "Henry: You just make sure she wants to go through with it, okay? I'll sell him on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: As soon as he started talking about the print ads, I knew we had him. So your Scott Reeves is as good as delivered. We can celebrate as soon as he signs the contracts.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe you should get us a meeting before you pop the champagne, Craig.",
        "Margo: Hey, I'm Margo Hughes. I remember you.",
        "Craig: Ah, sibling humor. I get it, almost always. How's Katie?",
        "Margo: She's happy. Very, very happy. And she won't allow anyone to tell her otherwise. Oh, no. This is not the last-minute advice she needs.",

        "Katie: No, I told you yesterday --",
        "Mike: I know, you told me that you love Henry. That no one has ever accepted you, loved you for who you are. You know, I can sit here and recite it in my sleep, it doesn't make it true. He's not the only person who loved you like that. I did, too.",
        "Katie: Well, if you loved me like that, then why am I marrying someone else?",
        "Mike: Because you're thinking I'll stop the wedding.",
        "Katie: No, I don't want it to be stopped. I love Henry. Okay, maybe it started out as something else, but it changed. I changed. I just don't need the same things that I did.",
        "Mike: The same things? What were those things?",
        "Katie: I have to finish getting ready --",

        "Henry: Yeah, always. But there is a difference between knowing it and living it, Margo. I woke up this morning -- crazy, crazy thing. I started to believe that maybe she could marry me. That she's supposed to be my bride.",

There will be times in this journey -- as in any journey in life -- which will require your care and understanding to help keep their union strong. Be willing to open your heart and your mind and listen to them and guide them so that their individual journeys may always bring them back to each other. As we gather here today to celebrate the beauty of love and to unite Katie Peretti and Henry Coleman in marriage -- should there be anyone with cause why this couple should not be united, speak now or forever hold your peace.",
