        "Nick: Go home and get a couple hours ok.",
        "Jack: We're not going to discuss my wife or my kids, okay? And here's why. We're partners on the job. And that's just about it. I'm going do my job, you're going do yours, and we're going get along just ducky.",
        "[Jack calls Carly]",
        "Jack: Hey. Sorry I didn't catch you.",
        "Carly: Not sorry enough to call my cell phone.",
        "Jack: I won't be home for dinner break. I got the night off at WOAK and I need to work an extra shift at the station to catch up. You know, stay ahead of things. So, tell the kids I'll try and call before bedtime.",
        "[Jack hangs up]",
        "Carly: Oh. \"Bye, Carly. I forgive you. I love you. I'm not really dying of exhaustion. I don't hate every single moment of my life, I just sound like it.\"",

        "Maddie: Hey guys! Sorry it took so long. I took the long way so wouldn't be followed and I ran into Casey which was totally unexpected. I had to give him the slip.",
        "Gwen: This is like the Mary Poppins' bag.",
        "Will: This is all?",
        "Maddie: Yep, that's it. Oh, wait a minute. No it's not. Happy Valentine's Day.",

        "Madame Lacoste: I may have been wrong about something. At first it seemed his communications were coming from the spirit world.",

        "Jennifer: You planned in advance?",
        "Dusty: You wanted courtship. You got it. If you're wondering what to wear, I like that green silk dress. Jenny?",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Green dress? Yeah, you got it.",
        "Dusty: What's wrong?",
        "Jennifer: Nothing.",

        "Paul: Where have you been? You were supposed to be here yesterday!",
        "Meg: Paul, I didn't know if this was a trap. And I had to make sure that Henry and Emily didn't follow me.",
        "Paul: Why are you back in town?",
        "Meg: Because you called!",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: I got an urgent call in Mexico and it sounded like you were in trouble. So I raced here. I went up to the cabin and you weren't there. So I thought I was too late. That you were dead in the snow somewhere. And I started looking everywhere that I could think of until I finally collapsed and gave up. You know what? You scared me nearly half to death.",
        "[Paul groaning]",
        "Paul: Ow! Meg, I didn't call you! I would never call you!",

        "Lily: A few more minutes.",
        "Jade: I cannot believe you could wait all day.",
        "Lily: Well, Faith had school, Natalie had a play date, I had a million errands to run. Sit down. Jade, I know you think you have this sense that I'm pregnant, but I don't want you to be disappointed.",

        "Holden: I agree. And so does your mom.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: We both think before this goes any further, that Jade needs to get a blood test.",
        "Lily: Holden, that's not the big news.",
        "Holden: Lily, if there's something going on that's more important than some girl landing on our doorstep, then I think I need to know about it. That would be --",
        "Lily: This is a pregnancy test, Holden.",
        "Holden: And it's --",
        "Lily: Positive. Happy Valentine's Day. You're going to be a daddy again.",

        "Holden: Of course. Of course, it's wonderful news. I mean -- it's a baby -- you just shocked me. Your surprised me. I have to tell you, it's probably the best thing that could've happened to us right now.",
        "Lily: Aw.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I totally forgot that it was Valentine's Day.",

        "Maddie: You're welcome. That's the least of it.",
        "Gwen: No, we're starving. This is big.",
        "Maddie: Bigger than -- I don't know, getting the cops off your trail?",
        "Will: No, that would count, too. Did your plan really work?",
        "Maddie: Yep. I told Margo that I found a bus schedule on the roof where you guys hang out and she has everybody looking at the bus terminals. So nobody should be here. You're safe for a while.",
        "Gwen: Oh, you're a genius!",
        "Will: Yeah, really. That's awesome! I'm going to put this in the back.",
        "Maddie: So you made your nest.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you know, kind of like a squirrel or a rodent.",
        "Maddie: No, kind of like -- okay, remember in \"It's a wonderful life\" when they can't go on their honeymoon and Donna reed fixed up that old house? You remember that?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I don't think it smelled quite like bourbon.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, it's still a love nest.",
        "Gwen: So what about you? Are you doing anything for Valentine's Day?",
        "Maddie: Homework. It's a school night.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, maybe, but that's wrong.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I know, it bites. Whatever, I have hope.",
        "Gwen: There's a special guy?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. No, not really. Not for me, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: It's not like I was expecting to hear from you, okay? The message was just cryptic and I couldn't think of who it would be.",
        "Paul: I wouldn't call you because I wouldn't want you to get into any kind of trouble.",
        "Meg: A little late for that. So somebody else left that message?",
        "Paul: It must've been Emily. Emily and Henry almost caught me.",
        "Meg: What? How?",
        "Paul: They called the cell phone that you left me.",
        "Meg: My phone. I was using it in my room, then the next minute it was gone. They were there?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "[Paul coughing]",
        "Meg: Are you still doing that? How often? Okay -- so they found you?",
        "Paul: They would have. I think. I don't know. That's why I left the cabin. I couldn't take that chance.",
        "Meg: So you came here in that get-up?",
        "Paul: Yeah. And you decided to drop by the Lakeview, why? You can't say you were looking for me.",
        "Paul: I have a plan.",
        "Meg: This is about Jennifer, isn't it? You're trying to come back from the dead. For her. Are you out of your mind, Paul? This is a stupid game, and it has to end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Why would you think Paul's alive?",
        "Jennifer: It's possible. I mean, there was a time when you thought so.",
        "Dusty: That was before your father found his car in 60 feet of water.",
        "Jennifer: But he could have fallen in the river and survived. Think about Jack Snyder.",
        "Dusty: Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Just say that it's possible. Why can't you give me that?",
        "Dusty: Is that what you want? False hope?",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: Don't be sorry.",
        "Jennifer: No, I am. Because you have planned this wonderful night in advance and I just feel like I'm a mess.",
        "Dusty: You look fabulous. I got nothing.",
        "Jennifer: Hey. I have something.",
        "Dusty: You do?",
        "Jennifer: Yes I do. A wonderful man.",
        "Dusty: Are you sure you believe that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey, did you get my message?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, every word of it. That's why I'm here. I brought you some fortification.",
        "Jack: Dinner? [Carly opens up her jacket, she's wearing her outfit from the strip club]",
        "Carly: In a way. Come and get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Baby, why are you so scared?",
        "Katie: I don't know. It feels like tempting fate to be apart right now. How long did it take us to get here?",
        "Mike: A hundred years.",
        "Katie: I'm serious. It feels like forever ago that you showed up at Memorial with your finger lopped off, wanting me to help find it.",
        "Mike: That's impressive. You knew you wanted me right there, didn't you?",
        "Katie: Right then and there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly, what are you --?",
        "Carly: Shh!",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Jack: Listen, honey --",
        "Carly: Before you say anything, I know that you're mad at me, Jack. And you'll still be mad at me after this. And you'll still have two jobs to work. And we'll still have three kids and two mortgages. And a car payment. But right now, you are the hottest guy I have ever known. And you're still mine. And I want that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So tell me, do you know how far along you are?",
        "Lily: Let's do the math. Not that long. I thought I might be pregnant. Since we weren't trying, I think I was in a bit of denial. And then Jade asked me if I was pregnant. It's like she knew somehow.",
        "Holden: Lily.",
        "Lily: I'm just glad that she's here in time for this. We're having a new baby on the way. What? What? What is it?",
        "Holden: Just be careful with this girl.",
        "Lily: If she's Rose's daughter, as far I'm concerned, it's like she's one of our own.",
        "Holden: If she is, yes! But I still think that we need to get that blood test. [Lily groans] A baby.",
        "Lily: Yes. Let's go back to that.",
        "Holden: Okay, this is what we're going to do. Tomorrow you should make a doctor's appointment. I'll go with you.",
        "Lily: Good, we'll get a sonogram. I'm so glad you're happy about this.",
        "Holden: Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mr. Donovan, you are one thing that I am sure of. I know what a wonderful man you are.",
        "Dusty: But maybe you're not sure I'm here for the long run? I mean, is that why you're hanging onto this thing with Paul?",
        "Jennifer: No, no, no.",
        "Dusty: Because I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Jennifer: Okay.",
        "Dusty: You don't believe me?",
        "Jennifer: You can't promise that.",
        "Dusty: Yes I can. I can. I know my reputation. I know I haven't always been there for everyone in my life. But when I'm there, I'm there. I don't run.",
        "Jennifer: I love you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Why are you taking these risks?",
        "Paul: They're my risks.",
        "Meg: Uh, no. This is my life too.",
        "Paul: No it's' not. That's why you had to go!",
        "Meg: Oh, I did? Then why did you give me those matches at the Lakeview yesterday? I didn't recognize you. You were gone as far as I knew. The only reason I'm standing here right now is because you got me here.",
        "Paul: Well, I saw -- I saw you, and I didn't -- I couldn't understand why you were back here. I had to make sure you weren't in any kind of trouble.",
        "Meg: You're so noble these days. So what was it, really? You were afraid that I was back to turn you in? Or was it that cough you can't keep down?",
        "Paul: It was, I don't know, maybe a little bit of all of the above?",
        "Meg: Well, you look like hell.",
        "Paul: Thanks, you look great. You got a little color.",
        "Meg: Did you take those antibiotics I left?",
        "Paul: Yeah, of course I took them. Why wouldn't I take them? No, I swear I took them.",
        "Meg: Here, sit. Sit.",
        "Paul: What, you just carry one of those around?",
        "Meg: Shut up. Okay, breathe. Come on, breathe. You sound like hell, too.",
        "Paul: I can still get around.",
        "Meg: Which means that you're well enough to go someplace where you could get real medical care. So why are you still here, Paul?",
        "Paul: Because I couldn't let Jennifer feel what she's feeling right now. And look, nobody asked you. I know how you feel about it and nobody asked you. What? Fine. You know what? You're free to go.",
        "Meg: Don't dismiss me.",
        "Paul: No, Meg -- you want me to say please? Fine. Please, Meg, go. I mean it. What the hell do you care what I do? So stick around.",
        "Meg: Why do I care? What a good question.",
        "Paul: Wait, no.",
        "Meg: I don't, okay? I don't give a damn what you do. You're on your own.",
        "Paul: Meg, hold on a second. Look, I don't mean to sound ungrateful. You have been more than dedicated.",
        "Meg: Look, you paid me for a service. You got it. End of story.",
        "Paul: Well, I think it's more than that.",
        "Meg: Is it?",
        "Paul: I don't know. You tell me. Why are you so upset?",
        "Meg: Look, I get misty eyed over road-kill, okay? Don't flatter yourself.",
        "Paul: Wow, okay.",
        "Meg: You want me gone, I'm out of here.",
        "Paul: No, wait, wait. I don't want you gone. I don't. I really like bossy nurses. I do. Look, honestly, I'm just trying to help you out here. Do yourself a favor. Be smart and walk away.",

        "Gwen: Yeah, me too. She's helped us out a lot. I really like her.",

        "Will: Mm-hmm. Stay here.",
        "Gwen: What is it? Oh no, you're kidding.",
        "Will: A lot of bands used to play here.",
        "Gwen: Somebody just left this behind?",
        "Will: Well, maybe they were really bad and their friends couldn't take it anymore. This could be the remains from an intervention.",
        "Gwen: You know, I thought it looked familiar. My band said they were sending it away for tuning.",
        "[Gwen tuning the guitar]",
        "Will: Uh-huh, they lied.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, no kidding.",

And I'm only doing it so that you guys can, you know, have some alone time for Valentine's Day or whatever.",

        "Mike: Look, I have one just like it.",
        "Katie: Oh, look, they match.",
        "Mike: Honey, that way we can text each other any time we want. Day or night. And if the phones don't work, you can always reach each other.",
        "Katie: Okay, this is sounding better all the time.",
        "[Mike laughs]",
        "Mike: Maybe Casey will teach you how to use it.",
        "Katie: It can't be that hard.",
        "Mike: I'll bet you got a message.",
        "Katie: You think? \"I love you, Kat.\"",
        "Mike: I left the end off.",
        "Katie: That's okay, I get the idea.",
        "Mike: Aw.",
        "Katie: I love you too, Mi. [Laughter] More than you'll ever know. So hurry back, okay? Promise me.",
        "Mike: I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I couldn't walk away. But when it comes right down to it, I don't have anyplace to go.",
        "Paul: You can go anywhere you wanted in the whole world, Meg. You know, if you need more money --",
        "Meg: It's not the money. I never thought I would say that. Thanks to you, I'm rich. I should be living it up, right?",
        "Paul: I'd hope so, yeah.",
        "Meg: Puerto Vallarta.",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Meg: That's where I went. I booked the most luxurious resort, the best suite, spa treatments every day, dancing every night.",
        "Paul: Men throwing themselves at you? Probably nothing new there, right?",
        "Meg: Well now it could be about the money. That's new.",
        "Paul: Relax. Enjoy it.",
        "Meg: I couldn't. Because the only think I could think of was that there's nobody waiting for me back home. There's nobody missing me. Nobody who needs me. That's a rotten feeling. That's why I packed my bags when I thought you'd called. It felt like coming back home to real life.",
        "Paul: Did you miss all this?",
        "Meg: I know.",
        "Paul: This is not real life.",
        "Meg: No. But it'll do for now.",
        "Paul: So, stick around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Come on.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: Why not?",
        "Gwen: The guitar's out of tune, I'm out of tune.",
        "Will: Oh, blah, blah, blah.",
        "Gwen: No blah, blah, blah, it's true.",
        "Will: No, it's not. Come on.",
        "[Gwen groans and sighs] [Will whispers] Gwen, Gwen, Gwen!",
        "Gwen: Okay, if you start yelling \"Freebird,\" I'm gonna walk out into the cold and turn myself in.",
        "Will: Come on, you know you want to.",
        "Gwen: Will, the whole music thing, having my own band, it was just part of a deluded fantasy to get out of my life. And now that you're in it, I want my life. Problems --",
        "Will: That is -- that is so sweet. Now go sing.",
        "Gwen: Okay. [Gwen sighs] Let's see what we have here. Without you the ground thaws the rain falls the grass grows without you the seeds root the flowers bloom the children play.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walter: Hughes -- your grandmother sends her apologies. She'll be here as soon as she can.",
        "Casey: Hotel crisis?",
        "Walter: It's Valentine's Day, everyone wants to get a suite.",
        "Casey: All right. Thanks, Walter.",
        "[Casey daydreaming]",
        "Maddie: Wardrobe hint, Hughes? Those look better on a girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nate: Hughes? Hughes?",
        "Casey: Hey, Nate. Did you like the candy?",
        "Nate: What?",
        "Casey: The candy. From Maddie? You know, your Valentine's Day date?",
        "Nate: I don't have a date tonight. My dad's in town, I'm meeting him.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Thank you for coming home with me tonight, Jack.",
        "Jack: I hope I don't pay for it tomorrow.",
        "Carly: I think Nick was being sincere.",
        "Jack: What? Did you just say something nice about my partner?",
        "Carly: Make sure you write it down, because it'll never happen again. I'm just happy to be with you.",
        "Jack: And you haven't even gotten my present yet.",
        "Carly: No -- oh, no, Jack!",
        "Jack: Wait, wait, wait.",
        "Carly: Oh, you shouldn't have. And for once, I actually mean that. We can't spend our money like this.",
        "Jack: We didn't, I did.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack. Oh, it's really pretty.",
        "Jack: You like it?",
        "Carly: Yes. Oh, look -- oh, it's beautiful! Thank you.",

        "Carly: Okay. Oh, Jack.",
        "Jack: It's wonderful.",
        "Carly: You take such good care of me, you know that? [Jack chuckles] You do.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well --",
        "Carly: So, why don't you let me take care of you?",
        "Jack: Oh, honey. You do. Every time you smile at me.",
        "Carly: Oh, I think I can do a lot better than that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know it's dangerous to be here, right? Emily and Henry, they could find me, they could turn you in. Someone could follow you here. There's like 1,000 different things that could go wrong. You know that?",
        "Meg: Okay. And you know it's foolish to think that Jennifer will forgive you if she finds out you're alive.",
        "Paul: Yes. That's one thing that could happen that would hurt me -- one thing for me. Like 1,000 things for you.",
        "Meg: Okay, thanks. You win.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I win. I'm really glad you're back.",
        "Meg: Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Can I ask you something? Seriously.",
        "Dusty: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: Is it waterproof?",
        "Dusty: You're talking about your watch?",
        "Jennifer: What did you think I was talking about?",
        "Dusty: I'm guess I'm not thinking.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I hope that it's waterproof, because I never want to take it off. And I'm holding you to what you said.",
        "Dusty: Deal.",
        "Jennifer: I mean it. I can't lose anyone else.",
        "Dusty: You won't lose me. And I don't want to lose you to a ghost. You understand?",
        "Jennifer: I'm gonna get my head straight about Paul, I promise. Because I don't want to lose you, either. I'm with you, from now until always.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Casey: I know you're up to something. Does it have anything to do with Will or Gwen?",
        "Will: We're gonna take the money and we'll get out of here tonight. Are you with me?",
        "Jennifer: If my brother is out there, you have to help me find him.",
        "Paul: Let's turn the heat up a little bit, see how she reacts.",
        "Meg: You're the one who killed him, and you've been covering it up ever since. What if her reaction is to finish what she started -- by killing you for real?"
