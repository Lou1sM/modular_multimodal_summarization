        "Bob: That's a very serious indictment. I think you should have a union rep present when we talk about this. Or a lawyer.",

        "Brad: You're killing me. You're killing me.",
        "Jack: Don't blow this, please. Think of it as an experiment, see if you can act like man for an entire night. I'll see ya.",
        "Chuck: Try these. I'll be right back.",
        "Brad: This is not how I'm spending this night. Vienna, hey, it's Brad. Look, I wanted you to know that I have decided to forgive you. Okay, okay, okay, just calm down. Remember how I told you I was going to make this Valentine's a night that you wouldn't forget? Well, I've got something to show you.",

        "Will: He went that way, look --",
        "Jade: Over there.",
        "Jade: Will, look through there. I think I see something this way.",

        "Will: Margo. Hello.",
        "Margo: Hi, Will, it's Margo. I'm really sorry to bother you. But is Adam with you?",
        "Will: No, he's not.",
        "Margo: Well, have you seen him?",
        "Will: Not since the ceremony.",
        "Margo: Will, these are not just empty words. I'm really sorry to bother you on tonight of all nights.",
        "Will: No, it's okay. It's just that I don't know where Adam is, and I haven't seen him.",
        "Margo: You sound upset, is there anything that I can do?",
        "Will: No, I'm good. I'm just sorry I couldn't help you.",

        "Margo: Well, I guess there's no reason he shouldn't be furious. But he didn't sound like that.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Margo can't find Adam, either.",
        "Will: No.",

        "Will: No.",
        "Jade: What is it?",
        "Will: The way she sounded on the phone, like she was really upset but still trying to be nice to me.",
        "Jade: Maybe she's trying to soften you up.",
        "Will: No. I think what you said before was right.",
        "Jade: This is a strange night. You think something I said was right?",
        "Will: I think that maybe we should go and tell Margo about Adam.",
        "Jade: And risk not finding him? I think we're getting pretty close.",
        "Will: It's just, after talking to her, you know, I'm not so mad anymore. I'm just kind of sad.",
        "Jade: Yeah.",
        "Will: And I should tell Margo myself. I mean, she's always been really fair to me. So I owe her something.",
        "Maddie: So they know it was Adam, too.",
        "Gwen: They'll come -- they'll come looking for him, the police. We have to get him buried.",
        "Maddie: What happens if they don't ever find him?",
        "Gwen: He ran away.",
        "Maddie: My God, Gwen. I didn't mean for this to happen. If you want to just go, you go and leave me here --",
        "Gwen: No. We finish what we started. We just make sure that nobody ever finds out what really happened.",

        "Brad: I want this guy's job. Nice.",
        "Vienna: I want you to know that I almost never give someone a second chance.",
        "Brad: And I will never need another one.",
        "Vienna: How basic.",
        "Brad: Well, I take you as a one perfect rose kind of woman.",
        "Vienna: Think bigger.",
        "Brad: I cannot tell you how sad it was for me to have to leave you at Java. But look, I got this big project going on and Kim needs a smart guy like me to come down and pitch it to the other execs on the team.",
        "Vienna: Uh-huh. So this big project of yours, is that what you wanted to show me?",
        "Brad: Well, being here with you tonight, so beautiful, all of a sudden, I don't know, business is the last thing on my mind.",
        "Vienna: We won't be disturbed?",
        "Brad: It's just the two of us tonight. The only two people in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I am so sorry for what I did. And I'm so sorry for letting you down.",
        "Bob: What happened? Why are you so sure that you're responsible?",
        "Meg: I was -- I was preoccupied when I took Sarah Shaughnessy's medical history. She told me all about her allergies, but I missed one. A crucial one. I failed to note it on her chart.",
        "Bob: You gave the patient a medication that she was allergic to?",
        "Bob: When did you realize what you'd done?",
        "Meg: I guess I've known it immediately. I didn't want to face the truth.",
        "Bob: What about this diary? Did you plant that diary and make entries that would get you off the hook?",
        "[Meg remembering]",
        "Craig: You and I, we both lied to Jack and to Bob. I fixed that diary for you.",
        "Meg: I never asked you to.",
        "Craig: I know, I know. But we -- we're in this together now. As you know, I don't have a great relationship with the local authorities here, right? And I didn't hesitate to help you when you needed it. So like it or not, we're a team so we all make decisions together now, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Meg? It's a simple question. Did you put that diary in Mrs. Shaughnessy's room?",
        "Bob: Meg, was that diary fake or not?",
        "Meg: I don't see why that matters anymore.",
        "Bob: Oh you don't, do you?",
        "Meg: What really matters is that I now remember her telling me about that one particular allergy. And we both know that it wasn't recorded in her chart. That it was my responsibility and I failed.",
        "Bob: When the patient died?",
        "Meg: And so she died.",
        "Bob: That's not the end of the story, is it?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Bob: Her husband wound up being shot by the police for terrorizing a floor in this hospital. And now we have an ongoing investigation by the police that's going to turn into a criminal case. And you watched all of this unfold and said nothing or continued to lie.",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Bob: And you know nothing about this diary now?",
        "Meg: I've told you the truth now. Why does the diary matter?",
        "Bob: Well, I'm sure that when the police hear what I have to tell them, it'll matter a great deal. How could you do this? How could you do this to a patient? How could you do it to this hospital?",
        "Meg: I know it was all my fault.",
        "Bob: No, no, not really. No, it's mine.",
        "Meg: Don't say that.",
        "Bob: No, I hired you and I knew that you had lied before. You had falsified medical records. You had violated the very ethics of our profession, and I ignored that. And look what's happened. You are no longer a nurse in this hospital. Now, I've got to notify the police, the medical board and the board of this hospital and tell them what you've told me. You know, if I were you, I would reconsider your thoughts about a lawyer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: You sure you don't want something more than soup?",
        "Margo: I didn't want that, you just didn't give me a choice.",
        "Kim: Well, you're right, I didn't. That's because you have to eat something and then you have to get some rest.",
        "Margo: Well, I don't want to do that either.",
        "Kim: Well, I'm not asking you what you want to do. You just can't run on empty, that's all. So your family's going to need you tomorrow and the day after, and the day after that.",
        "Margo: I know. Where is he?",
        "Kim: Margo --",
        "Margo: It's just not like him. He knows what happened to Casey. He knows what a horrible night this was tonight. It's just not like Adam to just leave, especially not tonight.",
        "Kim: Maybe --",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Kim: Bob said he was going to be stuck at the hospital for -- you know, maybe Adam went there to talk to him. Let me --",
        "[Knocking at the door]",
        "Margo: I knew it. I knew it. I knew something was wrong. I knew it. Will, is Adam with you?",
        "Will: No, but --",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, come in, come in. I'm sorry. It's just, I'm worried. I can't find him. I've been calling and calling. He's not answering his phone.",
        "Will: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.",
        "Kim: Bob's not picking up, either.",
        "Margo: All right, what's going on?",
        "Will: You're not going to like this.",
        "Margo: Just tell me what's going on.",
        "Will: All right, we're just going to say it then. It wasn't Casey that set me up, it was Adam.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Will: He must have figured out that Casey stole the money, and he set it up to make it look like I did.",
        "Margo: Why? Why would he do that?",
        "Will: Gwen. He wanted Gwen.",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Will: We were out looking for him when you called me and I felt like I should be the one to tell you.",
        "Margo: You were out looking for him?",
        "Jade: He was running away. I spoke to him here tonight and he was all packed.",
        "Margo: But his car is still here --",
        "Jade: I tossed his keys away. I was trying to keep him here, so he took off on foot.",
        "Margo: That doesn't make any sense.",
        "Jade: He wanted Gwen all along.",
        "Margo: But Casey -- Casey said -- Tom and I told him that obstruction of justice and planting evidence was the worst crime.",
        "Kim: What?",
        "Margo: Casey said nothing. He just asked, \"Where's Adam?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Maddie cries]",
        "Maddie: I can't believe I did this. What if they find him? I'm going to say it was me. It was just me.",
        "Gwen: No one's going to find him.",
        "Maddie: Gwen, I just -- I just want to let you know that I won't let this ruin your life, okay?",
        "Gwen: We have to go. It's getting late, come on. We have to keep playing dumb so nobody knows.",
        "Maddie: Just a second. You go first.",

        "Vienna: Would you mind closing that door, please?",
        "Katie: Don't you think it's a little late to be worried about your reputation?",
        "Brad: You know, you have the almost unnatural ability to ruin my fun.",
        "Katie: Won't I toss and turn about that one tonight.",
        "Brad: What are you doing here? And don't you knock?",
        "Katie: No, I don't normally knock when entering my own office.",
        "Vienna: Your office?",
        "Katie: You two are a real class act. What, no room at the no-tell motel? Too many pizza boxes in his back seat?",
        "Brad: Your office?",
        "Katie: Yeah, there were signs, like, perhaps, my nameplate, which, obviously, you threw on the floor.",
        "Brad: Oh yeah. You know what? There's just -- it's a mistake. It's a misunderstanding. The guard showed me the wrong office, that's all.",
        "Katie: There's a right office?",
        "Brad: Hey, you know that is -- that's silk.",
        "Vienna: You know what? Brad works here now. He has a very big project going on.",
        "Katie: Oh, and we all know how much you love a man with a big project.",
        "Brad: Almost as much as you love being the black hole of fun. All right, Vienna, let's get out of here, Baby.",
        "Katie: Can you put me through to Kim Hughes, please? Fine, go. But just so you know, I'm contacting Kim Hughes and I'm going to make sure that you and your big project never step foot in this building again.",
        "Brad: Like you could do that.",
        "Katie: Oh, maybe. Maybe I could. Just maybe I could, if I tell her what you and miss congeniality were doing on my desk.",
        "Vienna: Oh, so according to you, it's okay to sleep with someone else but your husband, as long as it doesn't include office furniture?",
        "Katie: Just go. Both of you. Oh, and take this.",
        "Jack: Well, it's good to see that you're off to a rockin' start.",
        "Brad: Were you checking up on me?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Brad: Were you checking up on me?",
        "Jack: I came back to make sure you had cab fare home. The manager couldn't find where you were.",
        "Katie: He was checking the viability of foreign markets.",
        "Jack: I see. Well, now that you've had your little fun for the evening, maybe you could, I don't know, get back to work?",
        "Brad: Come on, Vienna.",
        "Jack: Did you have to take it out on the tie?",
        "Katie: No, I had to take it out on your brother. I'm calling Kim right now. I'm getting him kicked the hell out.",
        "Jack: Well, actually -- I don't think you want to do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I'm okay. You can go now.",
        "Kim: No, I'm not going to leave you alone.",
        "Margo: I don't believe it. I don't believe it for a second, what Will said about Adam.",
        "Kim: You'll know when you talk to Casey.",
        "Margo: Yeah. It'll be good to have him out of the cell for an hour, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Your mom called from the car. She said she'll be here in a few minutes.",
        "Casey: Did she say what it was about?",
        "Dallas: She didn't say.",
        "Casey: Hey, can you do me a favor?",
        "Dallas: Depends.",
        "Casey: Maddie was here earlier and she's pretty upset about all this and about something I told her. So, I'm worried about her --",
        "Dallas: No problem. I'll look into it.",
        "Casey: You know, I said I'd take care of her after this summer. I'm doing a heck of a job, huh?",
        "Margo: Thanks, Dallas, I appreciate it.",
        "Dallas: Any time, Lieutenant.",
        "Casey: Didn't expect to see you again tonight. Everything all right with Dad?",
        "Margo: Yeah, he's fine. Listen, something has come up.",
        "Casey: Yeah?",

        "Will: Do you need a ride?",
        "Jade: No, my car's out front.",
        "Will: You think Casey's going to talk about Adam?",
        "Jade: Why wouldn't he? Why shouldn't he pay for what Adam did?",
        "Will: Well, they've always been close and Casey really looks up to him.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well, I don't think anybody's going to be looking up to Adam ever again.",
        "Will: I felt so bad for Margo. The look on her face when I told her about Adam.",
        "Jade: One last piece of advice for tonight? Stop feeling bad for other people. Feel bad for yourself.",
        "Will: Yeah. I know, in a way, I'm better off than anyone in Margo's family. I don't know what's going to happen to them. Honestly, I don't. Gwen and I, you know, we got through this, and Adam didn't win. And I can't believe I'm going to say this, but a lot of that is thanks to you.",
        "Jade: Oh well, I guess you could say I owed you one. And it's kind of nice having people be mad at someone else besides me for a change.",
        "Will: It's all made for a pretty long night, so let's just go home.",
        "Jade: Yeah and when you get there, tell Gwen I said I'm happy for you. Both of you.",

        "Meg: Now the question is, can I find its mate?",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Meg: There's no sense in both of us going down.",
        "Craig: You're not going down.",
        "Meg: Guess what. I already have.",
        "Craig: Don't think like that. I've got terrific lawyers, and there are so many extenuating circumstances.",
        "Meg: Craig, Craig! Listen to me. Listen to me. I don't need you to help me anymore. Please.",
        "Craig: Look, I'm really sorry if the diary is giving you problems. Just let me handle it.",
        "Meg: No. Don't do anything. Look, I'll never forget you barging through that door and tackling that guy. You saved my life. But you can't fix it. What I've done is really wrong. And I won't -- I can't cover it up anymore, and I won't let you do it, either. It's time that I pay the piper.",
        "Craig: The light from that kind of thinking would take 8 million years to reach me.",
        "Meg: It's just who I am. Mama always said --",

        "Katie: Fired? What, he really had a job here? I thought he was lying.",
        "Jack: He was filling in for one of your crew members. I was hoping this would turn into something, you know, permanent.",
        "Katie: Oh, that was not the information to get me to change my mind about calling Kim.",
        "Jack: He needs a chance, Katie. Just a chance.",
        "Katie: He needs to get hosed down! Every time I see him he's all over that Finnish floozy.",
        "Jack: I thought she was Swedish.",
        "Katie: Whatever. She's always draped all over him, smiling sweetly, and then she rakes me over the coals.",
        "Jack: Oh, okay, I see. So it's her that you have the problem with.",
        "Katie: She's constantly throwing Simon in my face. And the fact that I hurt Mike.",
        "Jack: That's gotta be rough.",
        "Katie: I deserve it. I know I do. I would take it from you. I'm not going to take it from her. I want her out of my life. And right now, WOAK is pretty much my life, so I want them out.",
        "Jack: Okay, look, look -- you probably won't even have to worry about her bothering you much longer, even if Brad does take the gig.",
        "Katie: I don't know, from what I see, wherever he is, she is.",
        "Jack: Well, the way I look at it, her attraction for Brad might be diminished when she finds out what his position at WOAK really is.",

        "Brad: You know, Honey, I would really love to show you, but I gotta get back to work.",

        "Dallas: Perfect timing, right? I mean, I was just about to knock and you were just about to -- go out in the dark in your pajamas?",
        "Maddie: I had some trash to take out.",
        "Dallas: After everything that happened in here, you're worried about some trash?",
        "Maddie: If you're looking for Margo, I don't know where she is. She's not here.",
        "Dallas: Well, she's down at the station. I just came by to make sure you were all right.",
        "Maddie: Me? Yeah, I'm fine. Why would you ask that?",
        "Dallas: Casey asked me to. He said that he told you something that really upset you.",
        "Maddie: Oh, no, I'm fine. He doesn't have to worry about me.",
        "Dallas: You know, right before I left, Margo went in there to talk to him again. Maddie, what's going on? Did something else happen?",
        "Maddie: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Dallas: Well you see, Margo always plays it by the book. And you don't take anyone out of a detention cell without there being a very good reason.",
        "Maddie: Well, she's worried about Casey. We all are.",
        "Dallas: Right. It has been a hell of a day, right?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Dallas: Look, let me talk to Adam real quick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I just had a very interesting conversation with Will and Jade -- about Adam.",
        "Casey: Yeah?",
        "Margo: Yeah, according to them, you didn't set up Will. You didn't plant the bond in Will's house.",
        "Casey: What would make them say something like that?",
        "Margo: They said that Adam did it. That he planted the bond, all so he could get Gwen to himself.",
        "Casey: He wouldn't do something like that.",
        "Margo: Well, you're the one person who can prove Jade and Will wrong. All you have to do is say that you planted the bond in Gwen and Will's home. But you never said that, did you? Not once. You said that you gambled, you said that you stole money from me, you said that you stole the bonds, you said that you trashed the club, but you never -- never admitted to cover-up. Even now, when I'm asking you point blank. So setting up Will, obstruction of justice, that's what your father couldn't get past. That's what made him so furious, that's why he came at you with both barrels. And you sat there, and you took it. All you ever said was, \"Where's Adam?\"",
        "Casey: Yeah, you need to talk to Adam about this.",
        "Margo: Because you didn't put the bond in Will's house, did you?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Margo: Did you know that Adam did it?",
        "Casey: You need to talk to him.",
        "Margo: Was he covering-up for you? Or was it what Jade said. Was it about Gwen? Ah! I know. I've got to ask Adam.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Oh, Casey, why did you lie to me?",
        "Casey: Because I already hurt you guys so much that I --",
        "Margo: Yes?",
        "Casey: I wanted you to have one son you could still be proud of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I'm sorry I'm so late.",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey, that's all right. I'm just glad you're here now. Margo needs all the support she can get tonight.",
        "Bob: What's been going on?",
        "Kim: Well, I think I should let her tell you. But she's been dealing with all of this all by herself.",
        "Bob: All by herself, right. You just happen to be at the police station in the middle of the night.",
        "Kim: Which leads me to ask you, what are you doing here? Sweetheart, you could have gone on home.",
        "Bob: Oh, I've just had a great day. I'm here on business. Officer, is Detective Jack Snyder here? I have to report a crime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen?",
        "Gwen: I'm in here.",
        "Will: What's wrong? Come here. It's over, okay? It's over.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry.",
        "Will: Don't be. You didn't do anything.",
        "Gwen: Yes, I did. I was horrible to you.",
        "Will: Adam did it, okay? You understand? Adam did it. Look at me. He made you think what he wanted you to think because he wanted you for himself.",
        "Gwen: No, no. I should have walked away. I should have walked away after L.A.",
        "Will: This is not your fault.",
        "Gwen: Yes, it is. I wouldn't see him for who he was. And I turned on you when you didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Will: You were set up, all right? It doesn't matter.",
        "Gwen: Yes, it does. I didn't have enough faith. I wanted to be famous, I wanted to be a big deal, so I did whatever he said, whatever he wanted. Please -- oh please, please, you have to forgive me, please.",
        "Will: We were both in a bad place, okay? You did everything you could to make up, and I was the one that walked out, I hung up. I'm the one who's sorry.",
        "Gwen: Don't you say that!",
        "Will: It's the truth, I am sorry. And I'm sorry you got hurt one more time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Why does your very big project need the gloves of a worker?",
        "Brad: Okay, that's an amazing question. I'll tell you. Okay, between you me and the walls, okay, it's a secret. Okay, Andrew Carnegie, have you read his biography?",
        "Vienna: I finished it last night.",
        "Brad: Well, then you know. He owned thousands of companies, made billions of dollars. But he never owned one company without doing one of the real jobs. He was going to own a steel mill, he would work in the plant. He was going to coal mine, he would work in --",
        "Vienna: Okay, so you're going to own this television station?",
        "Brad: No, no, of course not. The network. All right, so when I take it over, and everybody's working for me, they'll know I've been there with them, in the trenches. Shh, shh, shh. No, seriously. Now you've got to go, otherwise you're going to blow my cover.",
        "Vienna: I don't really know what you are. But you are certainly not a bore.",
        "Chuck: Do you think it would be too much trouble if we asked you to actually do some work?",
        "Brad: Oh yeah, man, no problem, no problem. But isn't it time for a break?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So the fact is, I have so much on my plate right now, I don't have time to worry about Brad or his financial issues. He needs this job. I need him to have this job, Katie.",
        "Katie: And I'm one of the reasons you have so much on your plate. Fair enough. I won't say a word.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Katie: But just tell me, how did you end up with a brother like that? I've met him, what -- three or four times? He makes me want to throw things.",
        "Jack: Ah yeah, well Brad has a tendency to rub people the wrong way at first. But, give it a couple of weeks. You'll want to kill him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Meg.",
        "Meg: Craig, please, just let me go. I can't keep up this tough girl act much longer.",
        "Craig: Please, just let me do something.",
        "Meg: You can let it be over. I killed Sarah Shaughnessy's. I put her husband and her sister through hell. I've disgraced this hospital, my own family. I need to face the music.",
        "Craig: Alone?",
        "Meg: Alone. Please, just let me get to my car before I start crying, okay? Thank you for trying to help. But I think it was a lost cause from the very beginning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: He probably left a couple of hours ago, but he didn't take his car -- wait a minute. I took this picture at Christmas time. I never dreamed I'd be using it as an APB. Take that.",
        "Bob: I think we should go home.",
        "Margo: Yes. My work is done here. Hal used to say that every night when he left, and every night I laughed. He loved Adam so much, he was really so proud of him.",
        "Bob: Let's go home.",
        "Margo: My work is not done here.",
        "Kim: What are you doing?",
        "Margo: Adam, it's your mom. Listen, I know what you did to will. And there's an APB going out on you tonight. I can help you, Adam, but only if you come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Uh, why do you want Adam?",
        "Dallas: Well, his mom's having a really rough night. I thought she could use his support.",
        "Maddie: Oh, right, of course. It's just that Tom is sleeping. And he's a really light sleeper, and if he got disturbed, Margo would kill me. So -- as a matter of fact, you know what, you should probably go, because if he sees your squad car in the driveway, he's gonna really have --",
        "Dallas: Maddie, are you all right?",
        "Maddie: Well, yeah -- well, no, I'm really worried about Casey.",
        "Dallas: Right.",
        "Maddie: Okay, well, thank you for stopping by, and I'm sorry I'm so --",
        "Dallas: Look, look, look, its okay. Don't worry about it.",
        "Maddie: When you see Casey, could you tell him that I said \"I'm sorry\"?",
        "Dallas: You're sorry?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. I am.",
        "Dallas: Sure.",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",

        "Gwen: You have to promise me -- promise me that you'll never ask me to forgive you ever again.",
        "Will: I don't understand.",
        "Gwen: Just don't. Because --",
        "Will: Because?",
        "Gwen: Because I can't take it. I can't take it.",

        "Maddie: That you told me about Adam before you told anyone else.",
