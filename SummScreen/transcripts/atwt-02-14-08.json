        "Holden: All the times we nearly lost each other -- I'm not sure I can remember them all.",
        "Lily: I remember.",
        "Holden: All we have ever needed is each other. We have survived crisis after crisis. We've overcome everything that life has thrown at us. What makes you think that we can't get of this well. This is nothing! This is a walk in the park.",
        "Lily: Please, I need you to come back to me. Luke needs you. I need you. Our baby needs you. Please. Say it again. And again. And again.",
        "Holden: I guess we're pretty lucky, huh?",
        "Lily: We are blessed.",
        "Holden: This last time, with Evan, all he had to do was let his hand slip, and I could have lost you forever.",
        "[What could of happened had Evan jabbed Lily with the needle]",
        "Holden: I will not let you do this to her.",
        "Evan: Stay back!",
        "Holden: Lily! Lily, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. We need a doctor in here! I got you, Lily. I got you. I won't let you go.",
        "[Lily dies and they show now what Holden and their kids life would have been like without her]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Ethan crying]",
        "Holden: Okay, Buddy, it's all right. Dinner's almost ready. I think you have to carry that second number.",
        "Natalie: No, that's wrong.",
        "Faith: I'm not eating this. It's disgusting.",
        "Holden: You know what? You girls, you need to cut me some slack here. Okay? I'm not used to cooking dinner and checking homework. Your mother, she was so much better at this. What? What is it?",
        "Faith: Don't make me eat any more.",
        "Natalie: Our teacher said to practice these problems with our parents.",
        "Holden: You know what? I just need to feed your brother first, okay?",
        "Natalie: You never have any time for me anymore!",
        "Holden: Hey, Buddy, I'm doing my best here. This parenting thing, it's a two person job. I just don't know if I can do it alone. Here you go.",
        "[Lily's ghost appears]",
        "Lily: You're not alone.",
        "Lily: You know the best part about heaven? I can see the future. And I have seen it. I've seen all the cute boys that you're going to date. And one very, very special young man who is going to adore you as much as I do. He's going to love everything about you. Everything. Even the things that you think are unlovable. He's very young right now, but he is looking for you. And he wants to find you. And you have to make it easy for him to find you. So that when he is ready to be with you, you're ready too. You're going to be just as happy as I was with your father.",
        "Holden: What made you calm down and get sleepy all of a sudden, but thanks. Your old man needed that.",
        "Natalie: Hey, Dad, you were right about carrying that second number, it worked.",
        "Holden: Excellent. You get a gold star.",
        "Faith: So can we make brownies now?",
        "Holden: I thought you weren't hungry.",
        "Faith: I ate an apple. The brownies are for the bake sale tomorrow. Didn't you get the note from Natalie's teacher?",
        "Holden: You know what? I don't think we have all the ingredients to make brownies. And you know what? Look at this kitchen.",
        "Natalie: But I have to bring something to the bake sale!",
        "Holden: All right, all right, fine. We'll make brownies somehow. Just need to clean up this mess first. Can't believe how easy that was. Lily? You did this? Natalie's homework, Faith's appetite, Ethan going to sleep. Even the brownies. How did you --",
        "Lily: We made a vow. Remember? For better or worse.",
        "Holden: Till death do us part.",
        "Lily: Bodies can be parted. Not souls. Not soul mates.",
        "Faith: Who are you talking to?",
        "Holden: Your mother. I was just -- I was apologizing for making such a mess in this kitchen.",
        "Faith: Looks okay now.",
        "Holden: Yeah, you're right. It does, doesn't it?",
        "Faith: Good job. Mom would have been proud of you.",
        "Holden: Bodies can be separated. But not souls. Not soul mates. Admit it. You've been helping me.",
        "Lily: I kind of bent the rules a little. We're only supposed to observe. Meddling is a no-no. But I -- I couldn't take watching you suffer.",
        "Holden: I don't want you helping from -- wherever. I want you here. With me.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry, Holden.",
        "Holden: I miss you so much.",
        "Lily: I know.",
        "Holden: You weren't perfect, I wasn't perfect. But together we were so --",
        "Lily: Perfect.",
        "Holden: What was that you said before? About how bodies can be separated?",
        "Lily: But not souls.",
        "Holden: Not us. Never again.",

        "[This scene shows Noah as a sailor and Luke lives in New York City]",
        "Luke: Thanks for the ego boost, Noah. But if I hadn't met you, you would've met some other guy who'd realize how wonderful you are.",
        "Noah: Are you kidding me? With my dad? Where would I have met this guy? Basic training?",
        "Luke: You never know.",
        "Noah: Luke, nobody would have had the guts to stand up to my dad, but you. If I hadn't met you, I would've enlisted. And everything would've been different.",
        "Luke: Well, hey, I can see you as a pilot, or a soldier, or a sailor. Oh, that might be kind of cool, actually. No one can resist a man in uniform, right?",
        "Sailor: Six months at sea, and we got 24 hours in New York! Come on, Mayer, first we'll get drunk at one of those strip clubs. And then I'm going to get a lap dance. How would you like a girl in a g-string dancing just for you?",
        "Noah: Actually, it's my first time in the city. And, you know, I think it would kind of lame to spend the whole day in a bar at one of those, you know, whatever. It's the greatest city in the world, right? I want to check it out.",
        "Sailor: All right. Your call, man. But me? I'm going to get me some of that whatever.",
        "Noah: All right. Well, I'll see you back on board.",
        "Noah: Oh, sorry.",
        "Luke: I'm not usually such a klutz.",
        "Noah: I wasn't looking where I was going. Typical tourist.",
        "Luke: I shouldn't be walking and reading at the same time. Could get hit by a bus.",
        "Noah: I'm just in town for the day. Shore leave.",
        "Luke: Oh, cool. Well, take care of yourself. You know.",
        "Noah: All right. I will. Luke! Luke, wait! Luke! Luke! Luke Snyder! I've been chasing you for blocks. You New Yorkers walk fast.",
        "Luke: Actually, I'm from Oakdale, Illinois. But when in the Big Apple --",
        "Noah: I thought you'd be fit to be in the navy. Anyway, you dropped this.",
        "Luke: Oh, thank you. Thank you! This is 50% of my grade and it's due tomorrow. My laptop crashed, and this is my only copy.",
        "Noah: Lucky I found it.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, lucky.",
        "Noah: I wanted to go to college, too, but my father made me enlist.",
        "Luke: Oh, well, that can be cool. I'm sitting here reading about history. And you're out there making it. Besides, you get to see the world.",
        "Noah: It is pretty cool. I mean, I'm always the first one off the boat, with guidebook in hand. I've only got 24 hours shore leave, but I've already earmarked enough stuff to last me a week.",
        "Luke: Well, if you don't mind an Illinois boy's take on things, I'd love to show you around. You know, as I way of saying thanks for saving my GPA.",
        "Noah: Yeah. I'd like that.",
        "Luke: Mark Twain, Jackson Pollock, John Lennon.",
        "Noah: Were all gay?",
        "Luke: No. They all lived here at one point or another. This is Greenwich Village. Lots of famous writers and artists got their start here. It's historic.",
        "Noah: So, do you spend a lot of your time here?",
        "Luke: Actually, don't laugh, I've never been here before. I always felt kind of weird coming here by myself.",
        "Luke: That's the Stonewall Inn. 1969? Stonewall riots. Anyway, it's historic. So, you want to hit the Statue of Liberty next. Is that cool with you?",
        "Noah: Yeah. Yeah. Cool.",
        "Luke: Imagine what it was like for immigrants coming to this country hundreds of years ago? This was the first thing they saw.",
        "Noah: Bet it was reassuring. This huge monument built to freedom.",
        "Luke: It must've felt kind of like a promise. You know, like here in America you could be anything you wanted to be. Even gay.",
        "Noah: Are you?",
        "Luke: Yeah. So, what, is this the famous don't ask, don't tell?",
        "Noah: Are you asking?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Noah: I am.",
        "Noah: That was the best shore leave ever.",
        "Luke: You really love New York, huh?",
        "Noah: Not just the city.",
        "Luke: Am I ever going to see you again?",
        "Noah: You want to?",
        "Luke: Definitely. I mean, when you ship out, I don't want anything bad to happen to you.",
        "Noah: Well, here. Take this. They give these out for bravery. But I think when I come back, we'll both need it.",
        "Luke: When you come back?",
        "Noah: Will you wait for me?",
        "Luke: I'll be right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[This scene was filmed in black and white shows Margo as a defense attorney and Tom as a district attorney]",
        "Margo: I think if I had failed the police exam I would have gone for something a little easier, like the bar.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Tom: So, Hughes vs. Hughes for Oakdale D.A.? You know, we could probably sell tickets to that one.",
        "Margo: No, no, no. No, no prosecuting for me. That's what you're best at. I'm visualizing something like Margo Hughes, defense attorney. Friend to the little guy, protector of the downtrodden.",
        "Margo: Golly, I really can't blame Emily Stewart for putting a bullet or eight into Paul Ryan under the circumstances.",
        "Tom: So, there are circumstances where it is acceptable to break the law and shoot a man in cold blood?",
        "Margo: You bet 'cha.",
        "Tom: And what, pray tell, are those?",
        "Margo: You'll see Mr. District Attorney. I'm Emily Stewart's defense attorney. We'll be seeing you in court.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Judge: Would both attorneys approach the bench? Since this is a preliminary hearing to establish whether Ms. Stewart should be remanded to stand trial, I intend to give both of you leeway in presenting your evidence. However, I will not have this courtroom turned into a circus. Do I make myself clear?",
        "Tom: Crystal, your honor.",
        "Margo: We wouldn't dream of causing a scene.",
        "Tom: The prosecution calls Paul Ryan to the stand. Mr. Ryan, could you please describe the defendant, Ms. Emily Stewart, to the court.",
        "Paul: She's nuts. Certifiable.",
        "Tom: Would you care to elaborate?",
        "Paul: She shot me. You should lock her up, and throw away the key.",
        "Tom: Your witness.",
        "Margo: Is it nuts then, once a woman is proposed to, and the proposal has been accepted, to anticipate a wedding? And is it certifiable for that woman to retaliate when the aforementioned wedding is called off?",
        "Tom: Objection. Counsel is leading the witness.",
        "Margo: Yes, I am leading the witness to realize that his actions are to blame for Ms. Stewart's utterly reasonable reaction.",
        "Judge: Overruled.",
        "Tom: Counselor is supposed to be cross-examining my witness, not testifying herself.",
        "Margo: Paul Ryan maliciously led on a woman he knew to be fragile. He played with her emotions, and then heartlessly dumped her. He drove her to the brink, leaving Ms. Stewart no choice but to strike out against him as she did.",
        "Tom: Says who?",
        "Margo: Says anyone with an X chromosome.",
        "Tom: Men have one of those, too.",
        "Margo: So, it's unanimous!",
        "Judge: Court is adjourned for the day. And Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, take it outside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Push someone hard enough, and attempted murder easily becomes justifiable homicide. All done, pinky. My turn.",
        "Tom: You can keep repeating it all you want, but you'll never make Emily the victim in this case. Paul Ryan is the one with the bullet wound in his chest.",
        "Margo: And poor Emily has a hole in her heart. There's all sorts of ways to be victimized.",
        "Tom: Well, you need to brush up on your jurisprudence, my dear.",
        "Margo: Hey! That hurt!",
        "Tom: Lighten up.",
        "Margo: You lighten up! You act like you're all offended by my interpretation of the law, and what you're really upset about is your own wife wiped the floor with you in court today! Ha.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Call your first witness, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Margo: The defense calls Emily Stewart. So, Ms. Stewart, how did you feel when Mr. Ryan called you, quote, certifiable?",
        "Emily: Like I always felt when Mr. Ryan called me that. Like he was the first man who ever really truly understood me.",
        "Margo: So Mr. Ryan was aware of your emotional difficulties when he proposed to you?",
        "Emily: Oh, yes, he was. He said that we were both two very deeply disturbed people, and that rather than make two other perfectly sane people miserable, we ought to stick together and see if we could just make each other happy.",
        "Margo: So, you were all set to marry and live happily even after?",
        "Emily: Yes, I was. Until I saw Paul, my fianc\u00e9, with another woman. All those beautiful things he said to me, all the plans we made. Gone. Tossed away. Like I was disposable.",
        "[Emily remembering]",
        "[Gunshots]",
        "Emily: My poor little heart was broken. I'm afraid I wasn't myself.",
        "[Meg screaming]",
        "[Gunshots]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Ms. Stewart, do you always carry a gun?",
        "Emily: No. I bought it that day.",
        "Tom: For what purpose?",
        "Emily: To shoot my fianc\u00e9.",
        "Tom: A clear case of cold-blooded, premeditated attempted murder, your honor. The prosecution rests.",
        "Margo: Redirect, your honor? Ms. Stewart, how well do you know our district attorney?",
        "Emily: Intimately. But not well.",
        "Judge: I beg your pardon?",
        "Emily: He's my son's father.",
        "Tom: I object!",
        "Margo: That's what I said.",
        "Tom: It's irrelevant.",
        "Judge: Overruled. I want to hear this.",
        "Margo: Do you think Tom likes you?",
        "Emily: About as much as he'd like a burst appendix. The fact is, you don't like me much, either.",
        "Margo: Well, I don't have to like you. I have to defend you. Which is what our district attorney doesn't understand. He has an agenda, your honor. He is using this case to punish the mother of his child!",
        "Tom: I object!",
        "Judge: I agree. The prosecution has engaged in a flagrant conflict of interest. Charges against Ms. Stewart are dropped. Case dismissed.",
        "Tom: Hold on a minute --",
        "Margo: Too late! You lose!",
        "Margo: Truce, pinky?",
        "Tom: No, thanks. I'm driving.",
        "Margo: Where are you going?",
        "Tom: Away. Far enough away that I can start forgetting that my wife humiliated me in open court.",
        "Margo: But I won the case. That's not humiliation. That's my job.",
        "Tom: Then keep doing it. You just won't have Thomas Christopher Hughes to kick around anymore.",
        "Margo: I won't let you leave. No! Sit. Stay.",
        "Tom: I'm not your lap dog, Margo. And I can't stay after the way you treated me. You see, you've only left me with one choice.",
        "Margo: Tom, no! You're -- you're misunderstanding -- don't be ridiculous. Nothing I possibly could have done could justify you shooting -- oh, oh, oh!",
        "Tom: Face it kid. You're all wet.",
        "Margo: Why, I \u0096",
        "[They kiss]",

        "Will: You know, you're not the only person who would have different if we'd never met. I was -- I was pretty messed up, too.",
        "Gwen: I don't know. I think it all worked out the way that it was supposed to. I wouldn't change anything about us being together.",
        "Will: I would.",
        "Gwen: Like what?",
        "Will: Make it happen a lot sooner.",
        "[This scene shows Gwen as singer]",
        "Casey: No, come on. That's why we both came out here.",
        "Gwen: No, it's cold. Don't you think it's cold?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I'll make you warm.",
        "Gwen: It's late. And I got to go to work. I got to go to work.",
        "Casey: Let's do this first.",
        "Gwen: Come on. Knock it off. Knock it off. Come on. Stop.",
        "Casey: Will, what the hell has got into you?",
        "Will: The girl is not into you!",
        "Casey: Back off, man!",
        "Will: Hey. Why'd you take off?",
        "Gwen: Leave me alone.",
        "Will: I just wanted to make sure you were okay.",
        "Gwen: That's really nice. It's none of your business.",
        "Will: You know, no offense, but I think I saved you some trouble back there.",
        "Gwen: Really? Because maybe trouble is what I'm looking for. It's kind of my thing. You know, you can ask anybody.",
        "Will: I'm asking you.",
        "Gwen: Wow. Look at the time. I got a gig at Yo's. So, I got to go. Okay. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey, I'm looking for a girl. I think she's a waitress here. She's blonde, kind of has an attitude.",
        "Bartender: Half the chicks here fit that description.",
        "Gwen: You stalking me?",
        "Will: No, I heard you sing. And you have an amazing voice.",
        "Gwen: Thanks. That's a really great line. I bet you have a million more just like that. Listen, anyway, I'm a -- just because you saw me with your horn-dog of a friend earlier, doesn't mean I'm easy. So --",
        "Will: That's not why I waited for you.",
        "Band member #1: Hey, Gwen. You coming?",
        "Gwen: No, I'm okay. I've had enough partying for one night. Thanks.",
        "Band member #1: How about your cute friend, here?",
        "Gwen: Oh, if you want him, you can have him.",

        "Will: You.",

        "Gwen: See, I can't even believe I let you talk me into coming back here. The coffee wasn't good the first time around.",
        "Will: Well, it's either Al's, or the bench outside in Old Town.",
        "Gwen: I know that bench really well.",
        "Will: It's kind of late. Do you have anybody waiting up for you at home?",
        "Gwen: No. I'm an emancipated minor. I moved out of the house when I was 16. My mom and her boyfriend of the minute decided that would be best for everybody.",
        "Will: I think if my mom had it her way, then my whole family would still live at home. Forever. We're dysfunctional that way. So, the last time I saw my mom, she was crashing her car into the psychiatric hospital. She was expecting to break me out, and she got sentenced there instead.",
        "Gwen: Wow. That stinks. I thought my family was bad.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess neither of us really fit in with the families we ended up in.",
        "Gwen: No, I don't really fit in anywhere. So, how about from now on, this is our place.",

        "Carly: But what if it's not the whole movie that's bad? What if what it needs to make it a classic is a different ending? Where's the beautiful smile to go with that beautiful dress?",
        "Sage: Don't marry Mr. Potter, Mommy. Please. He smells funny.",
        "Carly: I'll let you in on a little secret. That's the smell of money. Old money. And once I marry Mr. Potter, you, and Parker, and J.J. will have everything you've ever dreamed of. A huge house, and all the clothes, toys, and video games a child could ever want.",
