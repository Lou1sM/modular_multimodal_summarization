        "Jack: Parker -- Parker! What are you still doing here?",
        "Parker: Having breakfast.",
        "Jack: Your brother and sister already caught the bus, Buddy. You should be done with your chores by now.",
        "Parker: I guess I'll be late for school then.",
        "Jack: That's not acceptable, Parker.",
        "Meg: Hey. Come here. Thanks, Pal.",
        "Parker: No biggie. Guess I'll do my chores now.",
        "Jack: What was that all about?",
        "Meg: I had a meltdown in the barn. I was fine one second and then the next I was sobbing. Parker came in to do his chores, saw me, left and made sure that Sage and J.J. didn't walk in on me. He's a good kid.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Jack: To some people. Meg, I talked to Dr. Bob.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I -- knew that was coming.",
        "Jack: You told him you were responsible for Sarah Shaughnessy's death?",
        "Meg: She told all her medical allergies when I was taking her history. I was a little preoccupied, so I failed to take the right notes.",
        "Jack: That's pretty serious.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. So, is this where you arrest me for manslaughter?",
        "Jack: What about the notations in Sarah's diary? The ones where she -- she was planning on committing suicide.",
        "Meg: I had nothing to do with it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but somebody made those entries. And whoever did it was obviously protecting you.",
        "Meg: What difference does that make, Jack? She died. She died, and it was all my fault.",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay, Meg. That was an accident. But falsifying a diary? That's a crime. You gotta tell me who did that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: How you doing? How you doing?",
        "Katie: I'm excited! I can't believe it's already my first segment of \"Oakdale Now.\"",
        "Kim: Good, good. You look perfect. Don't change a thing. Listen to me. I want to make sure that this is a typical workday out here at the studio, so if something goes wrong, I want you to just keep going on. We're going to keep the camera --",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Kim: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Okay, no pressure.",
        "Kim: We'll just work it out. Okay?",
        "Katie: Okay, let's do it.",
        "Kim: All right, let's go. Stand by. And -- action!",
        "Katie: My typical day here at WOAK begins in my office/dressing/conference room. Since this place is the foundation of my workday, it is crucial to achieve a sense of peace and balance. I mean, I'm a bit of a neat freak, I have to admit. So, everything has its place, everything is in its place. And as you can see, this -- w-w-wah! I'm okay. I'm okay. Just -- I'm cool. I'm just gonna get up now.",
        "[Brad sighs]",
        "Katie: What the --",
        "Brad: You know, is the babbling really necessary? Can't you keep it down? I'm sleeping here.",
        "Katie: Cut.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: No, no, no, it's not an emergency. But if you do hear from Adam, would you give me a holler? Yeah, at this number. Thanks, Terrance. Thanks. Good morning, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Margo. I -- I didn't expect anyone to be up this early.",
        "Margo: Well, Tom was up at the crack of dawn. He had to see if he could move Casey's bail hearing up. And I've been calling all of Adam's friends in L.A. waking them up. They're none too pleased, but nobody has heard from Adam.",
        "Maddie: You think he went to L.A.?",
        "Margo: Oh, Maddie, last night, Will and Jade came by and they told us that Adam -- Adam was the one who set Will up, who planted the bond at Will's house. It wasn't Casey.",
        "Maddie: Why would he do that?",
        "Margo: Well, I wish -- wish I could ask him that question, but my son has disappeared. Only God knows where.",
        "Maddie: You want some coffee?",
        "Margo: Yeah, sure, I do. See, what happened was Tom and I came home last night and we saw Adam's car parked outside and we just assumed that he was upstairs in bed. But when I checked on him later, he wasn't there and -- I don't know where my son is. I'm going out of my mind here.",
        "Maddie: I'm really sorry. Margo, I really wish I could help.",
        "Margo: Well, maybe you can. When's the last time you saw Adam?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gwen dreaming]",
        "[Gwen screams]",
        "Adam: You and Maddie took my life.",
        "Gwen: No, Adam, please we didn't mean to.",
        "Adam: And I'll take everything you love, starting with your voice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: No. No. Will! No, no.",
        "Will: Gwen?",
        "Gwen: No!",
        "Will: Gwen.",
        "Gwen: No!",
        "Will: Gwen, wake up! Wake up. It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Gwen: Will!",
        "Will: It's okay. I'm here. Everything's okay now. It was just a bad dream. All right? Everything's okay now. You're fine, right?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: Can I get you some water or something?",
        "Gwen: No, I don't want you to leave. Please don't leave me.",
        "Will: That really got you spooked. It must have been a bad dream.",
        "Gwen: I'm going to get some coffee. Do you want some?",
        "Will: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What was the -- what was the dream about?",
        "Gwen: It was about a bunch of stuff.",
        "Will: Well, you were screaming.",
        "Gwen: What did I say?",
        "Will: You kept yelling no. No, what was that about?",
        "Gwen: I was -- I was afraid that you were going to leave me.",
        "Will: I'm never going to do that.",
        "Gwen: The last few days you were so mad at me. You wouldn't talk to me.",
        "Will: Well, yeah. Casey and Adam did a real number on us. But we're fine now. We're back, right?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I want us to be.",
        "Will: Okay. I know. We're good. Everything's good. I think today we should just spend it together. You know, making plans, talking about the future.",
        "Gwen: That sounds good. You start.",
        "Will: Okay. Well, first, I have this really great idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I saw Adam -- when you saw him. At the police station when Casey got arrested.",
        "Margo: But nothing after that? Not since then? Oh! You made it! You made bail. Oh!",
        "Tom: Well, it was a job, but once I explained to the judge about Adam's involvement in this, at least as far we know it, he was a little more receptive.",
        "Margo: Well, you are a miracle worker. So, now, is everybody hungry?",
        "Casey: I definitely am. It was true what they say about jail food -- it sucks.",
        "Tom: Well, we're going to make this a working breakfast. We have some decisions to make as far as what happens to Casey next.",
        "Maddie: Actually, this is a family thing. I'm going to run to Java and grab something.",
        "Casey: Wait, no. Don't you have study hall first two periods?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but I don't --",
        "Casey: Then can she stay? You can stay.",
        "Margo: Yeah, sure, if she wants to, yeah.",
        "Maddie: I really don't need to be here, Case.",
        "Casey: Maddie, we said no more secrets. And this time, we're sticking to it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: How can one person do so much damage",
        "Brad: Actually, it wasn't just one person. I got together with some buds last night on our coffee break for a little poker, little pizza. No harm done. I think there's some slices left over if you want. It's great for breakfast.",
        "Katie: Kim, I am so sorry. I mean, what is this guy doing? This is ridiculous!",
        "Kim: It's okay. Just keep going. We'll handle it in editing. Go ahead, keep rolling.",
        "Katie: Oh, we're still rolling, okay -- well, you are a lucky audience. You are getting a whole taste of what TV is all about, it's never boring. So, allow me to introduce Bradley -- Bradford?",
        "Brad: Just plain Brad.",
        "Katie: Just plain Brad Snyder, everybody, one of my coworkers here at WOAK. The last time Brad and I saw each other, he was pouring beer all over me and now it seems he's taken over my office. But he was just leaving.",
        "Brad: You know -- no, no, my momma told me never to leave a lady's place messier than when I came in.",
        "Katie: Really? No, you don't have to do that.",
        "Brad: No, but I insist. I insist.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, this would be a perfect time then, to give our audience a little sneak peak at one of the segments I was thinking about for \"Oakdale Now.\" Life is messy, so I was gonna ask you to email me tips on household cleaning and actually that reminds me of something that someone told me the other day. When you have a big cleaning job, think of the room as a clock. Start at twelve and systematically work your way around the room, until you get back to twelve, so you make a big job a little more manageable. Ow!",
        "Brad: Hi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I don't have anything to say about that diary.",
        "Jack: They claim that Sarah Shaughnessy's was planning on committing suicide was fabricated. Entered into her diary for one reason -- to protect you.",
        "Meg: So?",
        "Jack: So? If you don't tell me who that is, there's no reason to look at anybody else but you, Meg. All the evidence that we have, it all points to you, you will be convicted!",
        "Meg: I didn't do it, Jack!",
        "Jack: You don't have to tell me that!",
        "Meg: Then why are you yelling at me?",
        "Jack: Because I'm sick of all the women I care about -- getting involved with men who mess up their lives. Instead of turning state's evidence, you're standing there defending Paul Ryan.",
        "Meg: Paul? You think Paul had something to do with the diary?",
        "Jack: He wants you back. So, he makes the grand gesture and gets you off the hook. And you're so grateful that you take him back and you'll love happily ever after. Isn't that the way it's supposed to work?",
        "Meg: Nice theory.",
        "Jack: Did Paul do this? Doesn't really matter, I'll just have him brought in for questioning anyway.",
        "Meg: No, don't do that.",
        "Jack: All right then talk to me. Tell me. Who made those entries?",
        "Meg: How should I know?",
        "Jack: It was Craig, wasn't it? Craig Montgomery.",
        "Meg: I'm not answering any more questions -- not without a lawyer.",
        "Jack: Oh, if you're worried about incriminating Craig, don't worry about that. Nothing seems to stick to him. He always makes sure that he never gets caught -- much less convicted.",
        "Meg: Okay, so then we're done, right?",
        "Jack: Well, wait a minute. Aren't you curious of how he's gonna get away with this? By making sure that he leaves a trail that points to somebody else.",
        "Meg: He wouldn't do anything to me.",
        "Jack: I'm not talking about you. His target will be his competition. So, if I were you, I'd give your boyfriend, or your ex, a heads-up. 'Cause if I start looking at Craig, I can guarantee you that every piece of evidence I find, will lead me straight to Paul.",
        "Meg: I don't know or care about what anybody else did.",
        "Jack: You don't have that luxury.",
        "Meg: I just know what I did! I caused Sarah's death. And because of me, her husband came to the hospital with a gun. I did that, Jack. Me! No one else.",
        "Jack: What does Craig have on you, Meg?",
        "Meg: Would you just leave this alone?",
        "Jack: No, I can't. And you shouldn't either. You were that woman's nurse, Meg. I thought you took that seriously.",
        "Meg: I do!",
        "Jack: It's not bad enough that you kill the woman, now you're gonna let Craig murder her reputation on top of it?",
        "Meg: How can you say that to me?",
        "Jack: He let all of her friends and her family think she committed suicide. Do you have any idea the devastation that caused them?",
        "Meg: They don't believe that anymore, now that I told the truth.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but the lie is still sitting there! And it's a criminal act. A felony! Are you gonna go down for that too, out of guilt? Or are you gonna give Sarah Shaughnessy's family what they deserve? The truth. Just tell me who falsified that diary.",
        "Meg: I can't.",
        "Jack: Paul. What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: I heard what happened to Meg. She here?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'll get her for you. But, first, let's -- let's you and me have a little chit-chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I promise my viewers that \"Oakdale Now\" will be one of the best magazine shows you have ever seen. We will expand your mind, body, spirit, your wardrobe, your look, with visits from some of Oakdale's most fascinating people.",
        "Brad: Hey, what the hell is this?",
        "Katie: Well, Brad, that is called a butt-busting buddy. I used it in my butt busting with your babe video.",
        "Brad: Oh, that's absolutely fabulous, Katie. But you know, we all know what an expert at butt-busting you are. You know, you've certainly busted mine up one side of this town and down the other. Could you show me exactly how this works?",
        "Katie: Maybe later.",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, I think the folks at home would love a demonstration now. Wouldn't you, folks?",
        "Kim: Yes.",
        "Brad: See?",
        "Brad: Personally, I like a woman with a little meat on her bones. And if you ask me --",
        "Katie: I didn't.",
        "Brad: You have meat in all the right places.",
        "Katie: I do not have meat!",
        "Brad: Because you used the butt-buster buddy, right?",
        "Katie: Right!",
        "Brad: Well, show me. Show us.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, let's see with this one you stand on the band, hold out these and you just do a basic squat.",
        "Brad: Squat? A squat?",
        "Katie: A squat! Make sure you see your toes, pull in your abs and make sure you squeeze those butt cheeks, you know --",
        "Brad: Got it. But are you supposed to do it with a buddy, you know? Kind of like this? Come on, work with me.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'll work with you? And then I'll kill you.",
        "Brad: At least I'll die happy. That's one hell of a tight butt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Given the fact that the club he broke into didn't belong to a stranger. I don't think his grandmother wants him going to jail.",
        "Margo: So Lisa then will serve as a character witness.",
        "Tom: And Dad, Kim, anybody we can pull in. The fact that it's a first offense -- I think it's gonna help.",
        "Margo: Okay, so now, Casey, there's something else we need to deal with.",
        "Casey: The gambling. Yeah, I know we need to convince the judge that I quit.",
        "Margo: No, you're going to quit. Regardless of what the outcome of the trial is. Gambling is an addiction and you're going to control it for you.",
        "Casey: I've tried that though.",
        "Margo: Well, your dad and I have done some research, Baby.",
        "Tom: You're going to be seriously supervised. Limited computer use, and a block on any web site having anything to do with gambling.",
        "Casey: No offense, Dad, but you're going to have to do better than that. I mean, there are thousands of places to gamble on the web, and they're not all going to get blocked. I don't even need a computer. I can use a cell phone or a pda. There are wireless internet cafes, I could use the wi-fi at Java. You know, I'm just being real about this.",
        "Maddie: Gambling is like alcohol. It's everywhere.",
        "Margo: Yeah, it is. It's a disease and you are going to control it.",
        "Tom: And your grandfather has found a group through the hospital that specializes in gambling problems.",
        "Margo: They have meetings every day, sometimes they have several a day. And there is a lot of people there that understand what you're dealing with.",
        "Casey: You act like you still have to sell me on this. I'm already in.",
        "Tom: Good.",
        "Casey: The hard part's going to be going back to the dorms where half the universe is still gambling. I mean, I guess I could switch roommates.",
        "Margo: No, you're not going back to the dorm. You're moving back home here.",
        "Maddie: You are?",
        "Casey: But I thought you didn't want me living here while Maddie was living here.",
        "Maddie: Maybe they'll want to kick me out.",
        "Casey: No, no, look, I get what you're saying about me and that's fine, but you can't just kick Maddie out. She hasn't done anything wrong.",
        "Maddie: No, Casey, it's okay.",
        "Casey: No, it's not!",
        "Margo: No, Maddie -- Maddie we want you to stay.",
        "Tom: I mean, we're going to have to run this by your brother, but I believe that you are a very good influence on Casey. And we love you like you were one of our own. So, if you'd like to continue staying here, we'd love to have you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What's the good idea about? Are we gonna hitchhike to UI?",
        "Will: No, we'll do that next month. This month I think we should finish your demo.",
        "Gwen: How are we gonna do that?",
        "Will: You're the most talented singer I've ever heard. We gotta finish, right?",
        "Gwen: With what?",
        "Will: With the money Mom gave you to replace the bonds that Casey stole.",
        "Gwen: It's not just the money, Will. Everything is really different now.",
        "Will: How? You still got to take your shot at your career -- that hasn't changed.",
        "Gwen: There's a lot of production stuff that still has to be done. I don't know how to do any of that.",
        "Will: Okay, so we'll hire a new producer and we'll just use the tracks that you and Adam already did as a base.",
        "Gwen: No --",
        "Will: Gwen, this is gonna work. We can make it go really fast, we'll get the demo done and then we'll start shopping it around.",
        "Gwen: No, not right now. I can't think about any of that right now.",
        "Will: Well, that's how you feel right now, but I know in a couple of days you're gonna be missing the studio like crazy.",
        "Gwen: You're making it sound a lot simpler. Without Adam's connections --",
        "Will: Adam's connections? You're the talent! He was just a middleman. You know, maybe we'll call that Gordon Richards guy and we'll set up a meeting with him, see what he says.",
        "Gwen: I don't want to meet with him.",
        "Will: Why not?",
        "Gwen: Because I don't want to! I don't want to touch anything that Adam touched! Don't you get it?",
        "Will: So, when you and Adam were doing this stuff together it was everything that you wanted. But now that it's just me and you, you don't want it at all.",
        "Gwen: Look, that's not what I meant. I would love to work with you.",
        "Will: Okay.",
        "Gwen: Where are you going?",
        "Will: The library.",
        "Gwen: Oh, come on, please, don't be like that.",
        "Will: You know what? Damn my brother!",
        "Gwen: Don't talk about him like that!",
        "Will: Well, I'm just saying how I feel. You should try it sometime?",
        "Gwen: I am! I am saying what I feel, I don't feel like dealing with music right now!",
        "Will: Adam comes in here, he plants a bond in our house and he wrecks -- he wrecks everything up that's between us. I don't know where he is right now, but wherever he is, he might as well still be standing right here because we're still messed up!",
        "Gwen: How?",
        "Will: You don't want to sing anymore? What's that about?",
        "Gwen: I trusted him. Okay? I didn't think he was capable of hurting me or you like that. And when he came at me, when he said --",
        "Will: Came at you? When? What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: In the studio. You know how he would get. How critical he would get. Please just understand right now --",
        "Will: Okay, fine, then we'll give the singing a rest for awhile. And we'll do other stuff, you know? I don't care what we do as long as we're together. That's all that matters to me.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, me too.",
        "Will: So what's it going to be? Do you wanna go back to OU? Wanna start taking classes again, study together? Just like how it was when we met.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: So it kind of works like this, right? Yes!",
        "Katie: No!",
        "Brad: Yes!",
        "Katie: No! That is not working out, that's groping.",
        "Brad: You know, I gotta hand it to you, you are really good at this. I mean the exercising, the pamphlet that you wrote to go along with the equipment is well -- it's kind of a waste.",
        "Katie: You barely even looked at it!",
        "Brad: Well, you know, I think you should stick to writing fiction.",
        "Katie: Why, Brad, you can read? You must have read my book -- \"Oakdale Confidential.\"",
        "Brad: Actually, no, Katie, I did not. It's really not my speed. I wouldn't know a good book if it whacked me on top of the head.",
        "Katie: Really? Well, let's try it and see.",
        "Brad: You wanna wrestle? Do you wanna wrestle?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brad: Come on let's go. Two out of three. Come on, let's go.",
        "Katie: I didn't say anything about wrestling. Stop touching me. Stop it!",
        "Brad: Come on, come on!",
        "Katie: This is ridiculous! This is so embarrassing, Kim! Please, let's just get this bozo out of here and get back to work.",
        "Brad: You know what? Forget about it. Forget about it, you know, I'm through wasting my time trying to save your little busted butt of yours --",
        "Kim: Brad, Brad.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Kim: Come on back here right where you were. Keep rolling! Now, what was that you were saying about wrestling?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: If this is about Parker --",
        "Jack: Why would I want to talk to you about Parker?",
        "Paul: I know that you and Lily are upset at me for hanging out with Parker --",
        "Jack: Oh, I was upset that you came up with a cover story for them, yeah. But, this is about Meg's patient.",
        "Paul: The one who died?",
        "Jack: What can you tell me about that?",
        "Meg: Leave him alone, Jack! Don't answer any questions, Paul.",
        "Paul: What's going on?",
        "Jack: What are you moving back in with him?",
        "Meg: Of course not.",
        "Paul: Well, if you need a place to stay --",
        "Meg: Look, I can't stay here. I can't live like this. I need to get away from all of your questions.",
        "Jack: Okay, we'll make the farm a neutral zone, all right? I won't talk about the case here.",
        "Meg: No, you'll just wait for Paul or Craig or anybody else to show up, and then you'll eavesdrop on every word I say, hoping somebody will incriminate themselves.",
        "Jack: Now, there's an idea.",
        "Meg: I'm responsible for Sarah Shaughnessy's death. I will not let you use me to hurt somebody else, Jack.",
        "Jack: Well, what are you going to tell your mother about you leaving?",
        "Meg: Don't tell her about this, please. When she comes home, I need to tell her myself.",
        "Jack: No, I think you should give her a call. I'm not going to say anything, but if the kids let something slip, or she talks to one of her friends at the hospital --",
        "Meg: Okay, look, when it comes to me, she doesn't need another disappointment.",
        "Jack: Meg, you don't have to do this.",
        "Paul: Can I talk to Meg, please?",
        "Jack: If she wants that, yeah.",
        "Meg: Yeah, it's okay.",
        "Jack: Meg, you'll tell me where you land, right?",
        "Meg: Don't worry, Detective, I won't leave the jurisdiction.",
        "Jack: It's just-- we're family first! I'll call.",
        "Meg: Okay. So, why are you here?",
        "Paul: I heard about what happened at the hospital.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I got fired. So you're here to gloat?",
        "Paul: About how you lost your job. And I know how hard you worked to get another chance with Bob, but I'm glad you took my advice.",
        "Meg: You think you're the reason I --",
        "Paul: I accused you of lying, I accused you of recruiting Craig to cover up your lies, and now all of a sudden, you go to Bob and you confess? Yeah, I think I might have had something to do with it.",
        "Meg: You didn't.",
        "Paul: Well, you have no job and you have no place to go.",
        "Meg: Okay, so let me guess, you want to help, right?",
        "Paul: More than anything.",
        "Meg: I don't need your help, Paul! I don't want your help! I don't need anybody's help! Okay, just leave me alone!",
        "Paul: So, where are you going to live?",
        "Meg: I don't know! I don't know where I'm gonna go. I just know I don't belong here anymore. I don't know where I belong -- come here, come here! Sit down! Sit down! Will you sit down? You had another vision, didn't you? Didn't you?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Meg: Are you cold? Can I get you a blanket?",
        "Paul: It was you. My vision was of you. You -- you can't leave here.",
        "Meg: I can't stay here just because you think you had something --",
        "Paul: I don't think, Meg, I know. You're in danger. I would stake my life on it.",

        "Parker: I brushed down the horses, cleaned the stalls, and put the garbage out for pick-up.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Parker: Are you going to let me go to school now? What?",
        "Jack: I want you to try and see that therapist I found.",
        "Parker: I don't want to.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you made that more than clear when you ran away. But as long as I'm the parent, and you're the kid --",
        "Jack: I'm just some guy who's loved you since the day you were born and wants nothing but happiness for his kids. You don't think I'm your parent, that's cool. But you'll always be a son to me. Deal with it.",
        "Parker: Mom walked out on J.J. and Sage, too. How come they don't have to go to a therapist?",
        "Jack: Because I'm worried about you. They're not ditching school. They're not sneaking out in the middle of the night --",
        "Parker: Sometimes I have to get away. To think --",
        "Jack: Yeah, I understand that. You've got a lot going on. Your sister passed away, then your dad. And as far as your mother goes -- you don't know when she's going to come back.",
        "Parker: I don't care if I ever see her again.",
        "Jack: See, you don't mean that. It's not enough to pretend you don't care, but sometimes -- sometimes we need help to figure it all out. That's why I want you to see this therapist.",
        "Parker: I'm going to get detention if I'm late.",
        "Jack: I'm just trying to do right by you, and J.J. and Sage. To make it better for you guys. I can't keep doing that if you're going to put up these walls and not let me in, Parker. You think maybe you could help me out, Buddy?",
        "Parker: Is that one of my new chores now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's the same version every time. Your bracelet falls off your wrist. This time it lands on a rock. I don't know where.",
        "Meg: So, what's so life-threatening about that?",
        "Paul: It's the way I feel when it's happening. Like I'm going to die. Only they're not my feelings, Meg. They're your feelings.",
        "Meg: Okay, so I'll stay away from rocky areas.",
        "Paul: You think this is a joke? I have been right about every vision that I've had.",
        "Meg: Well, you're not being very specific with me, Paul. I mean, this life- threatening event, it could take place five minutes from now, five years from now.",
        "Paul: I feel its close.",
        "Meg: Well, I don't care.",
        "Paul: What does that mean?",
        "Meg: I don't care what happens to me.",
        "Paul: How can you even say that?",
        "Meg: You know what? I need to get out of here.",
        "Paul: You're going to go to him, aren't you?",
        "Meg: Always, always comes back to that, doesn't it? This is between you and Craig. I'm just some chip on the table, aren't I? Well, who's going to win the hand this time?",
        "Paul: I don't know. You tell me.",
        "Meg: This is one of your tactics, isn't it? Up the ante with a vision of impending doom.",
        "Paul: Look, I'm trying to save your life.",
        "Meg: That's not your job! I wish everybody would just leave me the hell alone.",
        "Paul: Promise me that you'll be careful. Please? Will you promise me that?",
        "Meg: Good-bye, Paul.",
        "Parker: Hey, Paul. What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: I came to see Meg. How are you doing, Parker?",
        "Parker: I'm okay. Hey, do you want to give me a ride to school? It's on your way, right?",
        "Paul: I can't. I have an appointment.",

        "Casey: You won't.",
        "Maddie: You don't know that for sure. Look, what happened last summer? Who could have seen that coming?",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, who knows I'm going to kick this gambling thing.",
        "Maddie: You will. Because you're strong. Stronger than you think.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well how do you know that?",
        "Maddie: Because you saved my life. And now all you have to do is save yours.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I don't know if I can. Honestly, I don't know if I can. If you left the room, I probably would be on the computer, gambling in five minutes. And I'd get that same jolt that I always got when I would get into a game. And look at me right now. I'm at rock bottom and I still can't walk away. I can't say no. I can't.",
        "Maddie: You don't have to do this by yourself.",
        "Casey: I know. That's why I need that group that my mom was talking about. I need my parents. And I need you. I definitely need you through this, especially.",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Casey: Because you get me. I mean, you made me confess about Adam, before anybody else. And you knew that I wouldn't backstab Will like that, too.",
        "Maddie: Maybe you shouldn't mention that to anyone.",
        "Casey: Mention what?",
        "Maddie: That you told me about Adam before you told anyone else.",

        "Gwen: Why do you keep asking me that?",
        "Will: Because I feel like we went to bed in one place and we woke up in a whole different universe. You don't want to sing anymore, you don't want to go back to school?",
        "Gwen: I -- I just don't want to do any of those things right now.",
        "Will: Yeah, but you saying that makes me think that you just don't want to do those things with me.",
        "Gwen: I love you, okay? Please, it doesn't have anything to do with you.",
        "Will: You were dreaming and you were screaming no. And you said my name.",
        "Gwen: I asked you not to leave.",
        "Will: You said you were trying to keep me from leaving, but all you've been doing since you said that has been pushing me away. So, what was the dream about?",
        "Gwen: It was stupid.",
        "Will: Just tell me.",
        "Gwen: You accused me of doing this really horrible thing. And you were right.",
        "Will: Well, what did you do?",
        "Gwen: I listened to Adam. Okay? He said one thing, and you said another thing, and I believed him. Okay? I mean, how stupid was I? You're my husband, you gave up everything for me. You came to me when I didn't have anyone.",
        "Will: You think that stuff was hard for me? I mean, being without you is not an option.",
        "Gwen: Please, you asked me to tell you my dream, I'm trying to tell you, okay? I buried --",
        "Will: What? What did you bury?",
        "Gwen: I buried the trust that we had for each other. It was something that we always had, no matter what anybody else thought, we could always trust each other. And I let you down. I didn't trust you. I should have never believed Adam.",
        "Will: That's okay.",
        "Gwen: No. No, it's not okay. You didn't love me anymore in the dream, you didn't love me and you left me.",
        "Will: Hey, never. That is never going to happen, all right? I promise. You know, it's kind of funny. I promised you that I'm never going to leave you, but a minute ago you were saying you needed some alone time. So what do I do? Do I go to the library or do you want me to stay?",
        "Gwen: Go to the library. I'm going to try to get some more sleep.",

        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Brad: But you know, you should think about going to see one of those -- what do you call it? Voice coaches. Because you have a tendency to swallow your words.",

        "Casey: Adam, you know -- I kind of talked myself into thinking that what he did to Will was just spur of the moment. You know, you do something stupid and then you feel bad right after, but you don't know how to make it right. But he just ran. I mean, he just ran. He left me hanging, he left Will hanging. I mean, how could he do that?",
        "Maddie: I know, I really wish Adam would have come to you. I wish he would have done the right thing.",
        "Casey: Yeah, me, too. And I'm starting to realize that sometimes that's impossible. Can you forgive me?",
        "Maddie: Of course I can forgive you. I just don't know if you're ever going to be able to forgive me.",
        "Casey: No way. What's that mean? What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Maddie: I just -- I don't know if I'm what you need right now.",
        "Casey: Are you crazy? Of course you're what I need right now. I couldn't get through this without you. Just the fact that you're here right now. I mean, how did I get this lucky?",
