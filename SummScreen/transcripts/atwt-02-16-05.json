        "Aaron: Do you think we could send Rafi's sister out for a walk? Couple hours?",
        "Alison: Oh, poor Celia. She was treated like cargo all the way here from Montega. She's probably sound asleep.",
        "Aaron: Well, that's perfect. If she's sound asleep, then she can't hear anything.",

        "Katie: Let's just cleaning up tomorrow, okay?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Sure. You tired?",
        "Katie: Exhausted. It was a beautiful wedding, Henry. I think everybody had a pretty good time, don't you?",
        "Henry: Yeah. If I had known we were going to get all the way to the \"you may kiss the bride,\" I would've planned a proper honeymoon.",
        "Katie: Oh, don't worry about it. We can't afford one anyway.",
        "Henry: Well, maybe not a, you know, exotic locale with a private lagoon and five-star dining, but you know, I found this Bay City Hotel -- it's got a bridal suite, and view of the water and -- a free continental breakfast --",
        "Katie: The truth is, I didn't even really think of a honeymoon.",
        "Henry: No. Of course you didn't. How could you? A million other things on your mind. Especially now.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: Bubbles, we both know there's a wedding guest that hasn't left yet. Mike's still here. If you -- if you want to stay behind, I totally understand, so --",
        "Katie: You know what? You know what I want to do? I want to go home. If that's okay with you, Mr. Coleman?",
        "Henry: Anything you say, Mrs. Coleman.",
        "Jennifer: Mike? I'm sorry I had to slip out of the ceremony. A business thing came up that I couldn't postpone, and I wanted to explain, but I couldn't find you.",
        "Mike: No problem.",
        "Jennifer: Where were you?",
        "Mike: Oh, I just went outside to get some air.",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry to keep asking this, are you okay?",
        "Mike: I'm fine.",
        "Jennifer: What about us? Are we okay?",

        "Julia: Holden, hi.",
        "Holden: Hi. I'm sorry. I should have call first.",
        "Julia: No, it's okay. You're always welcome here. You know that. Come in. So, what's up? Is everything okay?",
        "Holden: I told Lily that I wanted to go ahead with the divorce.",
        "Julia: Wow. I'm sorry. That must've been really hard for you. Is everything okay?",
        "Holden: We start seeing a marriage counselor tomorrow.",

        "Carly: Six letters -- second letter \"e\" -- another word for disappointment? It's \"regret.\" Boy, I was sure hoping that somebody around here might be in the mood to accept an apology or two. The kids are over at Emma's. She made a bunch of heart-shaped cookies for them to decorate for Valentine's Day. I was sort of hoping that you and I could work on something heart-shaped ourselves. In case you need an explanation for the 100 million phone messages I left on your voice mail --",
        "Jack: I didn't call you back because I didn't know what to say.",
        "Carly: So, I guess that means that Holden called you, and told you about Julia and Keith.",
        "Jack: What'd you expect?",
        "Carly: I wanted to tell you myself, Jack, so I could explain --",
        "Jack: No, can you explain looking me in the eye and making me a promise, Carly, and then going out and breaking that promise? I thought you were really going to try. I thought after everything we've been through -- I thought I could trust you.",
        "Carly: We were wrong. Lily and I were completely and totally, unbelievable wrong about the whole thing. And I'm sorry. We found this picture of Julia with a man that she'd never mentioned before -- how were we supposed to know it was her brother? And we thought he was just another guy on the long line of guys whose lives she'd ruined, and we were that Holden was going to be the next person on that --",
        "Jack: And that justifies tracking down a complete stranger, Carly, and luring him here, hoping for, what, some kind of spontaneous combustion?",
        "Carly: It wasn't a science --",
        "Jack: No, it's exactly what it was! Only twice as dangerous. How could you do this, after you know what happened with Les?",
        "Carly: I was afraid of that, too. And so Lily and I checked Keith out. I talked to somebody who knows him, so I could make sure that he's not dangerous --",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah, you checked him out. Well that makes all the difference in the world. Does that excuse the fact that you lied to me? You went behind my back, and manipulated people's lives?",
        "Carly: We were trying to keep Holden from making a big mistake, Jack, and I just thought --",
        "Jack: No, you didn't think. That was the problem! You had this idea in your head and you ran went with it, and to hell with everybody else. After the year we've had, we should be celebrating Valentine's Day with a bottle of champagne, but instead, what are we doing? We're arguing again for the millionth time about a woman who's not a threat to you. Who is no longer in my life. Don't you see, Carly? Julia's not the problem here. You are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: You and Lily are going to marriage counseling?",
        "Holden: It was the only thing that made sense.",
        "Julia: After what she just tried to pull with Keith? Are you completely forgetting that?",
        "Holden: No, I am not forgetting that.",
        "Julia: What then? You saw her try to manipulate us, now she's dragging you into counseling? When are you going to stop letting her control your life?",
        "Holden: Julia, I have kids. I have a son who's disappointed in his father. I have two little girls who have no idea what's going on here. I'm trying to do the right thing. I'm trying to do what's best for everyone.",
        "Julia: What about me? What about us? When are you gonna do what's right for us?",

        "Celia: Hi! I didn't hear you guys come in.",
        "Aaron: I'm surprised you heard anything with this music on so loud.",
        "Celia: I hope it wasn't too loud.",
        "Alison: Oh, don't worry about it.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, we just try to keep things pretty down here, 'cause, you know, neighbors and all.",
        "Celia: They'll forgive you when I get famous. I'll make sure they all get free tickets to my first concert.",
        "Alison: Wow, you really have your dreams laid out for you, huh?",
        "Celia: Well, now that Rafael's a boxing champion, he's going to be meeting stars, producers, people like that. And I'm gonna get him to introduce me. And once they hear my voice? It'll be nothing but first class for both of us.",
        "Aaron: Oh. That's a lot of confidence.",
        "Alison: You really have your heart set on being the next J. Lo, huh?",
        "Celia: I just want to be the first Celia Ortega. Even more famous than her brother. But don't tell him I said that. I wonder what's taking him so long to come back and get me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafael: Mrs. Walsh. Hi.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, Rafael, how you doin'? You here meeting someone fun?",
        "Rafael: I'm actually here to see you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Do I sense a problem afoot?",
        "Rafael: Yeah. I've been looking for Ms. Esteban, but she's out of town, or something --",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, she's on business. She'll be back in a day or two.",
        "Rafael: Okay. I think that's going to be too late.",
        "Lucinda: Anything I can do to help?",
        "Rafael: I hope so.",
        "Lucinda: Am I allowed to know what it is, this problem?",
        "Rafael: Yeah. Okay, it's like this. My sister, Celia, who thinks I'm this big millionaire boxer or whatever, arrived this morning in a box of oranges and I don't know what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: No, no, Henry, please. We don't have to do this.",
        "Henry: Oh, we're doin' it! No, if we're going to do this, we're gonna do it right! All right?",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Henry: I can't see where I'm going.",
        "Katie: Okay, okay, okay! Now put me down now. Please.",
        "Henry: As you wish, princess bride. Almost forgot I was carrying you. You're light as feather.",
        "Katie: Flatterer.",
        "Henry: Oh, I can't forget one more thing. You must be freezing. Hello, buddy. Now the family is complete.",
        "Katie: You really did think of everything.",
        "Henry: Aw, shucks, ma'am, it was -- it was nothing.",
        "Katie: Thank you for a most beautiful wedding day.",
        "Henry: Thank me? I should be thanking you. Katie, it went beyond my wildest hopes. It really did.",
        "Katie: Yeah? But here we are.",
        "Henry: In our little house. Just the two of us. Together. Yup. What a day. I'm dead on my feet. What do you say we just hit the hay, huh? Sound good?",
        "Katie: Oh, I don't know. I mean, it is our wedding night.",
        "Henry: Yeah. I guess I never thought about what would happen after the wedding that I thought would never happen.",
        "Katie: What do we do now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: What are you talking about? You and I are fine.",
        "Jennifer: Are you sure about that?",
        "Mike: Yeah. What happened here today had nothing to do with us?",
        "Jennifer: Mike, what did happen?",
        "Mike: What do you mean?",
        "Jennifer: Well, you watched your former fianc\u00e9e marry another man and now you look like you've run over by a bus. It makes a girl kinda wonder.",
        "Mike: Well, I'm just surprised they went through with it. That's all. But they did. You know, and Katie's moved on, I've moved on -- we're history.",
        "Jennifer: You've been saying that since they got engaged. And when they asked you to be best man, and when they asked you to remodel the gym. You keep saying that it's settled, but you seem very unsettled.",
        "Mike: Well, part of me is wondering how it's going to work out. You know, I mean, a wedding is one thing, a marriage is something else. I am concerned about whether Katie and Henry can make it over the long haul.",
        "Jennifer: They're on top of the world, Mike. There's nothing for you to be concerned about. If anyone needs to be concerned, I think it's me.",
        "Jennifer: I was watching you while Katie was saying her vows. And for a minute there, I was sure that you were gonna stop the wedding.",
        "Mike: I wouldn't do anything like that.",
        "Jennifer: But you wanted to. I think -- I think I know what's really going on here now. Why you needed to step out for some air, and why you were wound so tight during the wedding.",
        "Mike: Do we have to talk about this now?",
        "Jennifer: We have to talk about it eventually, so why don't we just deal with it now? Face it, Mike. You still haven't dealt with your feelings for Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Neither one of us ever thought in, like, a million years we'd be sitting here as husband and wife, so -- I mean, I -- I pictured the ceremony and I got as far as the vows, but I never got us into bed together. No, not that I've ever pictured that -- you know I would never picture anything like that. I'm just saying, I know you don't love me like that, Katie, so I'm not expecting --",
        "Katie: Henry.",
        "Henry: Yeah?",
        "Katie: It's not you, okay? I'm just not ready.",
        "Henry: Those vows you said today, those were the most incredible things that anyone has ever said to me. And if everything came to a crashing halt right now, it would still be the best day of my life.",
        "Katie: Good.",
        "Henry: So, since we're still unconsummated, you don't have to be afraid to tell me that you didn't expect it to get this far.",
        "Katie: I'm your wife because I wanted to be your wife.",
        "Henry: I saw Mike's face at the wedding. You know, he still -- he still really loves you.",
        "Katie: None of that matters anymore, okay?",
        "Henry: You always said that --",
        "Katie: It stopped being about Mike long before I ever walked down that aisle.",
        "Henry: Just hear me out, hear me out. Despite what you said at the ceremony, I know how you feel about Mike. If there comes a time that the two of you feel like you want to try to get together again, just tell me first. That's all I ask. Just let me know so I can give you my blessing, or whatever.",
        "Katie: That'll never happen.",
        "Henry: Never say never. Just tell me the truth. I can walk away like a gentleman.",
        "Katie: Okay, I'll keep that option in mind.",
        "Henry: We've lied to a lot of people to get what we want, you and me -- but we've never been dishonest with each other. Let's not start now.",
        "Katie: Why are you saying all this?",
        "Henry: Because above all else, I really want you to be happy.",
        "Katie: I love you so much, Henry Coleman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Your sister, Celia, mailed herself to you in an orange crate all the way from Montega?",
        "Rafael: Believe it or not, yeah.",
        "Lucinda: I guess you never mentioned to your family about the fiasco of the boxing match?",
        "Rafael: I wanted to, but, you know, I wanted to straighten everything out with the I.N.S. first, and then figure out how to bring them here, and then tell them the truth.",
        "Lucinda: Wow, you should've been more forthcoming. I'm sure the family would've understood.",
        "Rafael: I know. I just -- I didn't want to let them down. You know? I mean, how do you find the words to tell your family you've failed?",
        "Lucinda: You haven't failed. You didn't fail. There was nothing you could do about the boxing match.",
        "Rafael: Yeah, well, I hope Celia sees it that way, because she pulled this crazy stunt, thinking I'm famous. If I think what could've happened to her. You know, she could've gotten hurt, she could've been arrested, she --",
        "Lucinda: She could be killed, dear. She's a very fortunate young lady.",
        "Rafael: Yeah. Well, she survived, and I think that's going to be the easy part. I mean, what's next? You know, she came here illegally, so it's not like I can just send her on a plane and, you know, send her home. And if the I.N.S. finds out me harboring her, we'll both be deported, and I can't let that happen to her. She's my little sister. I love her more than anything. I'm like the only person that can protect her right now, and I need help. Will you help me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: If Rafael doesn't come get me soon, I might have to sleep here tonight.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe not. But I've got a great idea for what you should do while you're waiting. After a long, hot shower, you'll feel like a brand new person. And use this conditioner. Leave it on for a half hour, and it'll leave your hair feeling smoother than silk.",
        "Celia: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Is that what you use?",
        "Alison: Yeah, all the time. See?",
        "Aaron: Ah, I love it.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I love that conditioner, too. So use it, and get to it!",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Celebrity style! Do it up!",
        "Alison: Yeah, you deserve it.",
        "Celia: Thanks!",
        "Aaron: Yeah. And the bathroom is down the hallway, to the left.",
        "Celia: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Have fun! You are a genius.",
        "Alison: I thought she'd never leave.",
        "Celia: Guys?",
        "Alison: Yes, everything all right?",
        "Celia: I just want to thank you for being so nice, and letting me stay here and everything.",
        "Aaron: Oh, don't mention it.",
        "Alison: My pleasure.",
        "Celia: And when my first single goes gold --",
        "Alison: You can compose it while you're taking a long, luxurious shower.",
        "Aaron: Shower, yeah. That's what all the biggest stars do. I guess it's good for their vocal cords. That's what I hear! So have fun!",
        "Alison: Bye!",
        "Aaron: Okay, great.",

        "Holden: When I say that I'm trying to do what's best for everyone, that includes you.",
        "Julia: I know, I know, I know. I know. I just wish I could understand why Carly and Lily want to hurt me so much. I mean, first Lily tries to bribe me to leave town, and then Carly and Lily frame me for stealing, and then this thing with Keith -- that was just the last straw.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know. For me, too.",
        "Julia: How can you even say that when you're giving her another shot?",
        "Holden: Wait a minute, who says I'm giving her another shot?",
        "Julia: You just said that you're going to see a marriage counselor.",
        "Holden: No, not to save the marriage. We're going to see a marriage counselor to help us end it -- in a healthy, civilized way.",
        "Julia: Really? Oh. Oh, well, that's different. That's good. That's -- I'm sorry, I thought you were saying that you were going to see a marriage counselor. I feel really silly.",
        "Holden: Lily and I are not getting back together. And I wish that this whole counseling thing was my idea, but it wasn't. It was Luke's.",
        "Julia: Really?",
        "Holden: Yeah, he brought it up this morning when we talked. It was before all this happened at the hotel, and it made me realize that I needed to get some help in ending the marriage. For the kids' sake. And after this whole incident with your brother, it's obvious that lily needs to get some help, too.",
        "Julia: Yeah, she does.",
        "Holden: No matter how difficult it is for her, she needs to learn how to accept that our marriage is over. Some things just weren't meant to last forever.",

        "Jack: If her marriage is over, it's over, and I know you hate hearing that, but that's the way it is, Carly. I hate it as much as you do. My heart breaks for Lily and the kids, but this is between her and Holden.",
        "Carly: And Julia.",
        "Jack: We have enough to deal with in our own lives, Carly. We have a family, and a marriage, and occasional visits from a little boy named J.J.",
        "Carly: I know. You're right. And I promise --",
        "Jack: No, don't. Don't, okay? No more promises. Because, frankly, they don't mean much anymore.",
        "Carly: Jack, wait --",
        "Keith: You must be Jack. I'm Keith. Julia Larrabee's brother. I think we better get few things straight.",

        "Aaron: Depends on your definition of all right is. How are you doin'? You all right? [Alison sighs] Huh? You will be, okay? Even if we have to leave this town and change our names for privacy. When we do, I'm gonna get you.",

        "Holden: I really appreciate that. But right now, what I need is to put some distance between you and my family.",
        "Julia: What does that mean to us?",
        "Holden: You know, I don't know much about anything right now, and I don't know what's going to happen in my future. But I do know I want you in it. I want you in my life.",

        "Holden: But that's the future.",

        "Carly: I know.",
        "Keith: Julia told me everything, you know, how you guys met, your amnesia -- it must have been tough for everybody.",
        "Jack: Julia and J.J. got me through it. And I don't think I'll ever be able to thank them enough for what they did for me. I'm -- I'm just sorry that so many people were hurt afterwards.",
        "Keith: Yeah, I'm sure you are. I appreciate you keeping your commitment to J.J., even though you didn't stand by the one you made to his mother.",
        "Carly: Well, J.J., he's a great kid.",
        "Keith: Yeah, I think so. Of course, I'm a little biased. But that is the reason why I'm here.",

        "Jack: Thanks. I have to take this.",
        "Keith: Take your time.",
        "Jack: It'll only be second.",
        "Carly: Well, you know, that phone call could take forever, so why don't I just write you the directions myself, okay? I'm sure that J.J. is going to be really happy to see you.",
        "Keith: Yeah, well, I thank you for hooking me up with him, as well as my sister. She needs somebody to fight for her right now. And that's what I'm here to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Finally -- air. This thing has been strangling me all night.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, as beautiful as this dress is, it was not designed for comfort.",
        "[Imitating Dracula]",
        "Henry: Shall we slip into something more comfortable?",
        "Katie: Henry, you're reading my mind. Okay, now this is comfort. [Henry laughs] It is so good to get out of those clothes.",
        "Henry: Next wedding we have, we're doing in in PJs.",
        "Katie: With a barefoot reception.",
        "Henry: Barefoot -- hey, speaking of the reception, how was the food?",
        "Katie: We had food? [Henry laughs] I don't know, I didn't eat anything.",
        "Henry: I didn't, either. I was too busy happy, happy, happy.",
        "Katie: Well, you must be starving. I know I am.",
        "Henry: Yeah. All right, tell you what. You put Snickers away for the night, and I'm going to whip us up something delicious in the kitchen.",
        "Katie: We don't have any food in the kitchen.",
        "Henry: I'm going to make you a honeymoon meal you'll remember for the rest of your life.",

        "Jennifer: Mike? You're really beginning to frighten me. You've been so quiet.",
        "Mike: I was just thinking about what you said. And I think you're right. You know, maybe I'll always feel something for Katie. I've been trying to deny it for awhile, but there it is. We were best friends for a while. We fell in love. We got engaged. You can't love somebody like that and not be changed forever by them. I guess Katie will always be a part of me.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. You know, Mike, you don't have to sugar coat it. I think I know what you're trying to say.",
        "Mike: No, no, no, no. Please, wait, wait. I just got to get some things off my chest. There was a moment there, when in another place and another time, I thought it could've been me and Katie up there. And my past with her flashed through my mind.",
        "Jennifer: And you wanted to be back there. I guess that's exactly what I was seeing.",
        "Mike: No, no. What you were seeing was me letting go. There's nobody else's hand I want to hold. There's nobody else I want to wake up to in the morning. I have everything I want, and I'm exactly where I want to be. And the reason you saw me with the bouquet is because Katie wanted you to have it.",
        "Jennifer: It's so beautiful.",
        "Mike: I got something else for you.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Mike, you didn't have to do this.",

        "Jennifer: Mike, it's beautiful. I love it. Would you mind? It's beautiful. I have a gift for you, too.",
        "Mike: Well, where is it? You gonna give it to me, or do I have to kiss it out of you?",
        "Jennifer: That wouldn't be such a bad thing. But I think I left it at home.",
        "Mike: Then what are we doing in a smelly, old locker room?",

        "Keith: Julia's had a hard enough life as it is. She doesn't need you and your friend running around making trouble for her. She had to endure a lot growing up. We both did. You know? And she's come through it. And she's straighten her life out for the most part.",
        "Carly: Really?",
        "Keith: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Well, Holden has three children, Keith. Did you know that? And he had one of the happiest marriages in this town. And Julia could have gone after somebody who was unattached, but she didn't do that. She went after him. Is that -- that straightening her life out?",
        "Keith: Look, she's a good person. She's a great mother and she's a loyal sister. And if she's your friend, she will do anything for you. But, if you're her enemy, then you're my enemy, too, okay? And if you guys keep causing trouble for her, you will answer to me.",

        "Jennifer: What is it?",
        "Mike: Something I've been dying to do all night. You left the wedding early, and missed most of the reception, so I did not get a chance to dance with the woman I love. What day is it and in what month this clock never seems so alive I can't keep up and I can't back down I've been losing so much time cause it's you and me and all other people and nothing to do nothing to lose",

        "Henry: Me, neither.",
        "Katie: Who knew getting married could be so exhausting?",
        "Henry: I can't move. I have pain in muscles I never knew I had. My brain is pudding. And yet, I repeat, I repeat -- best day ever. Makes a guy wish it didn't have to end. Nothing to do nothing to prove and it's you and me and all other people",
        "Henry: Maybe it doesn't have to. Maybe I could just hold you tonight?",
