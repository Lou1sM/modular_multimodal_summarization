        "Holden: Okay, so why don't we grab a booth inside, and get a bite to eat?",
        "Lily: I think that's a good idea. Faith?",
        "Faith: Whatever.",
        "Lily: Have I told you how glad I am that you are home?",
        "Holden: Thank you. I'm just sorry that you had to deal with all this on your own.",
        "Lily: I know you came back as soon as you could --",
        "Holden: I just can't believe what she's doing -- purging, the laxatives --",
        "Lily: I know. Our little girl. The thought of her feeling that way about herself is terrible.",
        "Holden: Well, we're dealing with it. We're gonna get her the help that she needs. She's going to be okay.",
        "Lily: I'm so glad we were there -- the both of us, there at her therapy session. Even though we were just in the waiting room, at least she knew we were there for her. We should go in.",
        "Holden: So, I have a question.",
        "Faith: What?",
        "Holden: I've been away for awhile. How's school going?",
        "Faith: I wouldn't know. I keep getting pulled out to see a shrink.",
        "Holden: Well, your health is our top priority right now. So if it means that you miss a little school, that's the way it's gonna have to be.",
        "Lily: Oh, why don't we order something, and you can tell us about your session with Dr. Seidman.",
        "Faith: She said I didn't have to talk about it.",
        "Lily: I think she meant with your friends, Faith.",
        "Faith: No. She meant with you.",

        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Casey: Come on, Adam. The least you can do is pick up your phone. Where are you?",
        "Maddie: Casey, don't! Just leave him alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, its okay.",
        "Gwen: No, it's my wedding ring. I have to find it. I know it's here. Help me find it.",
        "Will: Gwen.",
        "Gwen: No -- it could've come off in the bed, right? Maybe it's in the bathroom. I know it's here.",
        "Will: It's not.",
        "Gwen: Don't say that.",
        "Will: When we were in the shower, I noticed you weren't wearing it.",
        "Gwen: Why didn't you say anything?",
        "Will: What was I supposed to say? I know why you weren't wearing it.",
        "Gwen: Wait a minute, what do you mean that you know why I wasn't wearing my ring? I would never take it off.",
        "Will: Well, you would if you thought that I stole the bonds to keep you from having the career that you were supposed --",
        "Gwen: I know that you didn't do any of those things.",
        "Will: You know that now. But yesterday? That's a different story. Look, I'm not saying this stuff to make you feel bad. But you thought that I was jealous of you and Adam, right? And the success you guys were gonna have.",
        "Gwen: No. No, I didn't want to believe any of those things, I really didn't. I was just -- I was so stupid.",
        "Will: Well, you were set up. By Adam and Casey. So was I.",
        "Gwen: I don't -- please, I don't want to talk about them.",
        "Will: Look, all I'm saying is that I understand why you took it off if you thought that I wasn't the guy that you married.",
        "Gwen: I know that you're the person that I married. I love you. And even with Jade, even with everything, I never would've taken my ring off. I'm sorry. I ruined this -- you didn't do anything.",
        "Will: You didn't ruin anything. Would you calm down, please? Just take a deep breath. Okay, just try to think. When was the last time you remember having it?",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: Did you remember something?",
        "Gwen: No, it's just -- I can't sit around. I gotta -- I gotta retrace my tracks.",
        "Will: Okay, slow down.",
        "Gwen: No, I can't. I have to find it before it gets dark out.",
        "Will: All right, well just wait for me and I'll go with you.",
        "Gwen: No, you can't!",
        "Will: You don't want me to go with you? Gwen, if you're this upset, then I don't want you to be alone.",
        "Gwen: No, it's just that I've messed up so many times. But this time -- this time was the worst.",
        "Will: Well, why are you acting like this is the end of the world? People lose things, its part of life. I'm not mad, it's okay.",
        "Gwen: No, it's not okay. You gave me that ring, and I vowed that I would never take it off.",
        "Will: Well, you didn't mean to. It was an accident.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Yeah, it was an accident.",
        "Will: Okay, so, stop beating yourself up about this.",
        "Gwen: Stop being so nice to me. You're my husband! I doubted you! I should've believed you, nobody else. Everything is different now.",
        "Will: Nothing's changed. I still love you. You love me. Adam and Casey -- they messed us up for awhile, but we're fine, right? Everything's okay.",
        "Gwen: Right.",
        "Will: All right. So, if you want to go do this by yourself, fine, I'm not gonna stop you. But you gotta do something for me, okay? When you find the ring, come straight home, so I can put it back on your finger.",
        "Gwen: I love you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What are you doing? I was trying to call Adam.",
        "Maddie: I know.",
        "Casey: Then why'd you take --",
        "Maddie: Because I don't think -- I don't think you should be talking to him.",
        "Casey: I shouldn't be talking to him? He's my brother.",
        "Maddie: I know, but he hurt you. And he was supposed to be looking out for you, and he just made it worse.",
        "Casey: I know what he did, Maddie. I let him do it.",
        "Maddie: No, you trusted him. You thought that he was on your side and he wasn't.",
        "Casey: Maybe if he comes back, he can help me make up for what I've done.",
        "Maddie: You don't need him for that, okay? You can do this on your own.",
        "Casey: You know, I don't blame him for bailing on me, either. After the way things went down, I deserved it.",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Casey: He sweated blood for Gwen's cd. And when I stole those bonds, it was like saying his months of hard work didn't mean squat. But he still tried to save me.",
        "Maddie: By pointing the finger at Will!",
        "Casey: And it killed him, Maddie, but he thought that was the only way.",
        "Maddie: You know what, can we -- can we just not talk about Adam for like a minute?",
        "Casey: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Maddie: Its okay, you don't have to apologize. I'm sorry for ripping the phone out of your hand. I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Casey: No, I do have to apologize. I lied to you about gambling. I mean -- really, I don't think you know how bad that makes me feel.",
        "Maddie: I do. Listen, you're gonna get help and you're gonna make it all up to everybody, okay?",
        "Casey: How? I couldn't even stop it, how am I going to be able to fix it? Adam said he'd help me. Now he's gone. I can't believe I let this ruin every good thing in my life. My parents, school. I mean, Will and Gwen -- they probably hate me.",
        "Maddie: No one could ever hate you, Casey. What are you doing?",
        "Casey: I can't just spend my life waiting. Waiting for Adam to call, for my dad to tell me when my court date is. I have to do something.",
        "Maddie: Where are you going?",
        "Casey: To Will and Gwen's. Even if they don't want to hear it, I have to apologize.",
        "Maddie: Casey, there's nothing you can say to them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, Buddy. How was school?",
        "J.J.: Fine.",
        "Jack: You had that big test today, right? Math?",
        "J.J.: Yeah.",
        "Jack: How'd that go?",
        "J.J.: Okay.",
        "Jack: Where's Parker? You and Parker were gonna ride the bus today, right? J.J., I asked if you and Parker were gonna ride the bus today.",
        "J.J.: I heard you! I don't know where he is, okay? Parker isn't my problem!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Okay, Faith, you're right. You don't want to talk about your therapy session, you don't have to. Okay?",
        "Faith: Good.",
        "Lily: I'm gonna order something at the counter. I'll be right back.",
        "Holden: You mind telling me why you're so mad at your mother?",
        "Faith: The moment you left, she started flipping out. We had one fight because she went into my backpack. Now she's punishing me by making me see a shrink.",
        "Holden: You know that's not why you're seeing Dr. Seidman. You're seeing her because of what you're doing. Skipping meals, making yourself sick, taking laxatives.",
        "Faith: I didn't take any laxatives! And I don't need a shrink.",
        "Holden: Is that why you ran off after your last appointment?",
        "Faith: Is that what she told you? Because that's not what happened. I went to my appointment and after, I waited for her to pick me up and she never did.",
        "Holden: Faith --",
        "Faith: Do you see the way she treats me. She watches every thing that I eat. She even follows me into the bathroom.",
        "Holden: Okay, all right. She's your mother. And I don't want you talking about her that way. And the next time she tells you to do something, I want you to do it. You understand?",
        "Faith: Why are you on her side? Why are you ganging up on me?",
        "Holden: Nobody is ganging up on you.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Faith: Can I answer that? Or do I have to ask Mom first?",
        "Holden: Just make it fast.",
        "Faith: Hello?",
        "Parker: Do you know why they call it Al's diner? Because if you eat their food, you die.",
        "Faith: What?",
        "Parker: It's Parker. Look outside, but don't let your dad see. Having fun?",
        "Faith: No.",
        "Parker: So ditch them and let's get out of here.",
        "Faith: I don't know if I can.",
        "Parker: Just make something up. They'll never know.",
        "Lily: Who's on the phone?",
        "Faith: It's Morgan. We have a science lab due tomorrow. And since you took me out of school early, we didn't get to finish it. So she wants to know if we can do it now.",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Holden: Now is probably not a good time.",
        "Faith: But if we don't do it, I'll get an F, and so will she.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: All right, all right, you can go.",
        "Faith: I'll be right there.",
        "Parker: Sweet. And nice lie.",
        "Faith: Thanks. What are you doing?",
        "Lily: I'm going to take you back to school.",
        "Faith: I was just gonna walk.",
        "Lily: No, you're not walking.",
        "Faith: Why? Its two blocks. You don't trust me?",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: Yes, I trust you. So, if you'd like to walk back to school, you can walk back to school. Faith?",
        "Holden: Faith? Don't you want to say something to your mom?",
        "Faith: Thanks.",
        "Lily: You're welcome. What? What's wrong?",
        "Holden: I'm just trying to figure out why she's so angry.",
        "Lily: You mean, why's she so angry at me. Clearly, she has no problem with you, so that just leaves little old me.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, we can't have everything turn into a battle between you two. It's just gonna make everything worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Ready?",
        "Faith: Yeah, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm really having a hard time keeping my patience with her, Holden.",
        "Holden: I know.",
        "Lily: You heard the way that Faith talks to me. I can only be pushed so far.",
        "Holden: Me, too. Believe me, it was all I could do from losing my temper just now.",
        "Lily: She knows how to provoke us. She does. And when she does that, it distracts us from the real problem. That's why I thought it would be a good idea for her to see Dr. Seidman.",
        "Holden: And I agree with you -- it is. I just don't understand how this spiraled out of control so fast. Before I left, she was just moody. And when I come back, and she's -- I don't know.",
        "Lily: Why don't you just say it? What did I do to make her act like this?",
        "Holden: That's not what I'm saying at all. Lily, I'm not criticizing you. You've done everything right.",
        "Lily: But I haven't done enough.",
        "Holden: I just think there's too much going on right now.",
        "Lily: Too much what?",
        "Holden: Your mother told me that you threw yourself into this job.",
        "Lily: You talked to my mother about that?",
        "Holden: Yeah, it came up in passing.",
        "Lily: My job came up in passing? Did she complain to you because we had a disagreement about one project?",
        "Holden: No, it wasn't like that.",
        "Lily: Really? How was it like? You're not gonna say anything. Okay, I'm just gonna call my mother. Clearly, she has no problem pointing out all the things that I do wrong.",
        "Holden: Lily, your mother and I, we were talking about your job, because that's the reason that Faith was left waiting at the doctor's office.",
        "Lily: I can't believe you just said that. I was running late. I did not forget about Faith.",
        "Holden: I know.",
        "Lily: Was that what you told my mother? You know what, I don't like the two of you talking behind my back. If my mother has a problem with me, then she should take to me about it.",
        "Holden: She doesn't.",
        "Lily: Well, then obviously, you do. So tell me, when do you think that I started getting so preoccupied with my own life that I did not notice what was going on in my own daughter's?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: What is this place?",
        "Parker: This is where Paul lives.",
        "Faith: No, it's not. I went to his place once with my Aunt Meg. He lives downtown.",
        "Parker: Not anymore. He like, flipped out or something, and now he lives here.",
        "Faith: So why are we here?",
        "Parker: We never really got to thank him for getting us out of trouble with our parents at java the other day.",
        "Faith: Don't you think we should've called first?",
        "Parker: Faith, you think he has a phone up here?",
        "Faith: He might have a cell phone.",
        "Parker: Paul won't mind. He's cool. He's not like Jack or your dad.",
        "Faith: Parker, don't.",
        "Parker: It's open, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're one tough kid, you know that? The way you take all this stuff, and you keep it inside and you deal with it -- you deal with it on your own. It's a very grown-up thing to do. Problem is, J.J., you're not a grown-up. You shouldn't have to do deal with that on your own.",
        "J.J.: It's okay. I know you're worried about Parker. And he was here first.",
        "Jack: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "J.J.: It's just that, he's been your kid longer.",
        "Jack: Hold on a second. J.J., I love you, too. Who was here first doesn't matter. You're just as much my son as Parker is. I couldn't love you any more if I tried. Man, you have been so good through all of this. You do your homework and all your chores every single night without being asked. The way you helped me with Sage in the morning, getting ready for school. I'd be lost without you, Kid.",
        "J.J.: It's just -- things that Mom would do if she was here.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, Parker, he doesn't know how to handle everything that's happened. Not like you. He's hurt and he's angry, and so he's acting out, thinking that'll make him feel better.",
        "J.J.: But it doesn't. It just gonna make him madder.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know.",
        "J.J.: So why do you let him get away with it?",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Jack: That's the question of the month, isn't it? I thought that if he got all this anger out it would help him -- it would help him move on, but clearly, that is not happening. So I gotta come up with a better plan. Which is why I have to know where he is. J.J., it's not like you're telling on him.",
        "J.J.: Well, I don't know where he is.",
        "Jack: J.J. --",
        "J.J.: I don't! He doesn't talk to me anymore, just like he doesn't talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: What do you think? Isn't it, like, the coolest fort in the world?",
        "Faith: Have you been here before?",
        "Parker: A few times.",
        "Faith: Have you heard of any of these?",
        "Parker: No. Hey, if we had matches, we could take this with us for when it gets dark.",
        "Faith: You know, Parker, I don't think we should be here if Paul's not.",
        "Parker: Chill out, it's fine. Unless you want to go home.",
        "Faith: No.",
        "Parker: You're not scared, are you?",
        "Faith: No.",
        "Parker: Cool. Then we'll just wait for Paul.",
        "Faith: You can stay if you want. This place is just too weird.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So, you think that Will and Gwen will kick me out if I try to apologize?",
        "Maddie: I don't know. I think maybe you should wait. Okay, I understand that you want to say you're sorry. It's just that right now --",
        "Casey: Right now, I'm the guy that messed up their lives, and",
        "Maddie: No, you're not!",
        "Casey: Maddie, come on. I did those things. And now this is the way it is.",
        "Maddie: And they'll forgive you. Maybe not today, but one day.",
        "Casey: Mad, you don't know that.",
        "Maddie: Real friends give second chances, okay? No matter what you've done, if they know that you didn't mean to do it, or you didn't mean to hurt anybody, they'll understand.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Things will never be the way they used to be. You wanna come with me to Will and Gwen's?",
        "Maddie: Why?",
        "Casey: You're obviously upset, and maybe if you see me do the right thing for once, it might make you feel better.",
        "Maddie: I can't, I'm sorry. I can't, Casey.",
        "Casey: All right, well, can you at least tell my parents where I went? 'Cause if they come home and I'm not here, they might think -- I don't know, that I'm like Adam.",
        "Maddie: No, you're not at all like Adam, okay? Not at all.",
        "Casey: Thanks for standing by me.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Casey: You know, I've given you a million reasons not to.",
        "Maddie: You don't need to thank me.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I do.",
        "Maddie: Casey --",
        "Gwen: Maddie, hey, hey, where do you think you're going?",
        "Gwen: Tell me you weren't about to just tell Casey about Adam.",
        "Maddie: No, I --",
        "Gwen: Maddie, you can't!",
        "Maddie: Listen, I know. I know, okay? But you didn't see him. He thinks everybody hates him. He thinks that his brother ran out on him. He's so sad.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. But I do not feel sorry for him. He brought it upon himself.",
        "Maddie: He's just trying to make things right. He has no idea that nothing is ever going be right again.",
        "Gwen: Can you forget about Casey, please, for one minute? Okay, I need your help.",
        "Maddie: Why? What's happened? Will didn't find out --",
        "Gwen: No, he doesn't know. It's my ring -- Maddie, it's my wedding ring. I can't find it. I think I lost it when we buried Adam.",
        "Maddie: No, that's impossible. You lost it somewhere else, doing something else.",
        "Gwen: No. No, I didn't, Maddie. We have to go back.",
        "Maddie: Back? I -- no!",
        "Gwen: Maddie, if somebody else finds my ring before I do --",
        "Maddie: No! No one is gonna find it.",
        "Gwen: If somebody finds Adam and my ring is with his body, how long do you think it's gonna take for them to figure out who was responsible for what happened to him?",
        "Maddie: We should've told someone what we did.",
        "Gwen: No, we couldn't do that, and you know why. Maddie, please. Please, Will gave me that ring. You were with me when he gave it to me, you know how much it means to me. I have to get it back.",
        "Maddie: I can't. I can't. I'm sorry.",
        "Gwen: Fine. Fine, I'll go by myself.",
        "Maddie: Wait. This is my fault. I was -- I was the one that killed him.",
        "Gwen: No. No, no, no, it was an accident. Maddie, look at me, okay? That's all that it was, and now I need your help so I can make sure that nobody ever finds out what we did. Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Maddie: Okay, how are we going to do this?",

        "Lily: Is it affecting my ability to be a mother?",
        "Holden: No!",
        "Lily: No? Did she tell you about this contract that I have with this baby food company?",
        "Holden: Yeah, she mentioned it. She didn't go into details. And if you want to talk about it, I'll listen.",
        "Lily: I think it's great. My mother does not. I'd like to prove her wrong.",
        "Holden: And I'm sure you will. Listen, I got some stuff I need to take care of out at the farm. It's getting kind of late and I need to do it before it gets dark.",
        "Lily: Okay. I'll pick up Faith at school when she calls. If she calls.",
        "Holden: You're still gonna be here?",
        "Lily: I will be here. I'll be here eating this fat-free, flavorless muffin and I have a business meeting in about 20 minutes. What more could a girl want?",

        "Parker: We're not running away. And nobody broke in. The door wasn't locked.",
        "Paul: My bad.",
        "Parker: We just wanted to thank you. You know, for sticking up for us with our parents.",
        "Paul: Well, I lied. I probably shouldn't have lied. Did you get in any kind of trouble for hanging out with me?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: So, you took off, too, when you were our age?",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I did it a little differently, though.",
        "Faith: How?",
        "Paul: All right, listen, first of all -- you know, your parents aren't that bad. They're actually really cool people who love you a lot, even though it doesn't feel like that right now. My dad was a -- a really bad guy. He hurt a lot of people.",
        "Parker: Did he hurt you?",
        "Paul: Yeah. But he was my dad -- not a whole lot I could do about it. But to answer your question, when I was your age, yes, I would run away, but I would use my head instead of my feet.",
        "Faith: How?",
        "Paul: Well, my mom had all of these art books. And there were all these pictures in it of famous paintings. And when things got real bad, I would just lock myself in a room with one of these books, and I'd look at all of the pictures and go to all of the places in my head. Places where James Stenbeck didn't even exist.",
        "Faith: My grandmother Lucinda doesn't like him.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, he was a really bad man.",
        "Faith: Out of all the books you looked at, which one is your favorite?",
        "Paul: Well, it was this one painting by this guy named Henri Rousseau called \"The Sleeping Gypsy.\" It was this gypsy asleep in the desert, and he had these stripes and his guitar next to him and this great, big moon. And he just looked so peaceful sleeping there. And there was this enormous lion watching over him.",
        "Parker: Cool. Was he gonna eat him?",
        "Paul: No, no. I think he was there to protect him, you know? To keep him safe while he slept. And I used to imagine that I was this gypsy, and I had this big, powerful animal watching over me, keeping all of the bad things in the world away from me because I was just a little kid. And then later, I would pretend that I was the lion, and I would pretend that I could protect the people that I loved --",
        "Faith: Like your mother?",
        "Paul: Yeah, sure, like my mother.",
        "Parker: I'd be the lion. That way, nobody could ever hurt me.",
        "Paul: I haven't thought about that painting in a long time.",
        "Faith: It's because you haven't needed it.",
        "Paul: It's just a painting. I'll tell you, though, if I had it, I'd put it up right here, over this fireplace.",

        "Casey: The whole way over here, I was trying to figure out a way that I could explain all the things that I've done to make you understand. But the best thing that I can come up with is that I'm sorry. I was gambling, and I lost control, I got stupid and desperate. I stole from you, from my mom. I messed all this up. The worst part of it is, though, is what I did to you and Gwen. If I could take one thing back, that would be it. Because you've been a great friend, and you didn't deserve this. So if you hate me, I don't blame you.",
        "Will: I don't hate you. I hate what you did. I hate why you did it. But I could never hate you. But that's just me. I mean, I can't speak for Gwen. She's blaming herself right now for not trusting me.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but that's not her fault -- that's my fault. And I'll tell her that. I'm gonna try to make things right, and I'm gonna pay you back.",
        "Will: I don't care about the money. It was never about the money. I just didn't want Gwen to think that I could do something like that to her. But you and Adam really messed things up for us.",

        "Casey: I know. I wanted to. But I didn't know how. I mean, I didn't want you to know that I messed up again.",
        "Will: Yeah, because I've never been there before. Look, there's something I want to ask you, something I don't really get.",
