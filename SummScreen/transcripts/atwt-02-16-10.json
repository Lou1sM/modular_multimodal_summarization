        "Casey: Say that again?",
        "Emily: Don't listen to him, Casey. He'll say anything to torture us.",
        "Barbara: Don't provoke him. All that matters is getting Paul to the hospital.",
        "Alison: Casey, no.",
        "Casey: Listen, I don't know what your problem is or your game is at all or what unfinished business you have with your family. Just leave Alison out of this.",
        "Mick: Well, I wish I could, but facts are facts.",
        "Casey: Alison would never sleep with you. I know that, and everyone in this room knows that.",
        "Mick: Do they? Well, let's ask them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: This is not a request. This is the perp's demand. Nothing that even smells like a cop car gets through that perimeter. Do you understand me? Look, this guy has already assaulted an officer and shot one of the hostages, so I am not taking any chances here. What? What do you mean swat's on their way? Who's heading that team? You tell him no sirens. And he better pray that nobody in that church spots him, or I'll shoot him myself. [Margo sighs] What are you doing here? You should go home.",
        "Tom: I went to get my cell phone out of the car.",
        "Margo: No, no. I don't want you here.",
        "Tom: Well, I'm not letting you do this alone.",
        "Margo: Look, its bad enough that Casey is in there. I don't want you here. I want you out of the way. I want you out of danger.",
        "Tom: Well, that's what I want. So do your job, get our boy and Alison out of there safely, and we'll all go home together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: Emily, front and center.",
        "Paul: No. She stays put. Whatever she has to say, she can say from -- from right here.",
        "Mick: Now, Son, you shot me enough times to know that the guy with the gun wins. Emily -- Emily!",
        "Emily: Oh! Okay.",
        "Mick: Now, Casey here is your ex-husband, correct?",
        "Casey: What's that have to do with anything?",
        "Emily: Yeah, yes. Casey and I were married.",
        "Mick: And you ended that union. Rather, he ended that union because you were so terrified of becoming pregnant that you had your tubes tied. That was a bit extreme, wasn't it? And what does that say about you?",
        "Emily: It had nothing to do with him. If you wanted to embarrass me, you succeeded. Is that what you wanted?",
        "Mick: You forgot about our impromptu poll. Now, you and your sister are close, yes?",
        "Emily: Yes.",
        "Mick: And sisters confide in each other, don't they?",
        "Emily: Yes. But she never --",
        "Mick: I'm sorry. I -- I totally forgot to explain the rules of the game. It's really simple. If you lie, you die.",
        "Casey: Listen, we all know Alison never slept with you.",
        "Mick: Do we? Okay. If you're so confident about that, ask her.",
        "Casey: Alison, what's going on? Why is he doing this?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Mick: Oh, look, Casey. Mommy's calling. Its okay, it's okay. She can wait. Alison, you were saying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Damn it, damn it, damn it! He's not picking up. Why?",
        "Tom: Hey, take a breath and take a step back. So, this guy thinks he's Stenbeck. What would James Stenbeck do?",
        "Margo: He would play me. He'd mess with my mind. Oh, James loved his games.",
        "Tom: All right, fine. So -- so wait till he calls you.",
        "Margo: No, there's no time for that. Swat's coming in.",
        "Tom: But Dante said no cops.",
        "Margo: The state police overruled my orders.",
        "Tom: Why?",
        "Margo: Because they know it's my son in there. They know that I'm not impartial. And they're right. If -- if Dante held a gun to Casey's head, I'd give him whatever he wanted.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, he tried to let Casey go before he let me and the others leave.",
        "Margo: Casey and Alison stayed in there why?",
        "Tom: Because Dante wasn't gonna let Alison go, and Casey wasn't gonna leave without her. Hey, what are you thinking?",
        "Margo: James always has a master plan. We've got to assume that Dante has one, too.",
        "Tom: And this plan involves Alison?",
        "Margo: He crashes her wedding, he takes her as hostage why?",
        "Tom: Because he wants to put a stranglehold on you. She's about to marry our son.",
        "Margo: No, no. If he was after me, he'd -- he'd insist that Casey would stay there, and Alison would be let go.",
        "Tom: Do you want me to call Susan?",
        "Margo: I want you to call Susan. I want you to find out if there is a connection between Alison Stewart and Mick Dante that we don't know about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Leave her alone. Can't you see she's scared of you?",
        "Mick: I asked her a simple question.",
        "Casey: You're waving a gun around! You're threatening to shoot people if you don't hear what you want to hear. Alison didn't sleep with you. You're a liar.",
        "Mick: Indeed I am often, but not in this case.",
        "Casey: I am gonna jam that lie down your throat.",
        "Alison: Casey, don't! It's not a lie.",
        "Mick: Finally, the truth comes out! Tell him the rest, Sweetheart.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Mick: Aw. She's leaving out the best part. Now, a gentleman never kisses and tells, but she seemed to enjoy it at least as much as I did.",
        "Alison: Casey!",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Tom: Oh, my God!",
        "Margo: I knew it! I knew that we shouldn't trust him!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Mick: Hello, Margo.",
        "Margo: I will give you five seconds to open this door!",
        "Mick: Next time, I won't miss.",
        "Margo: Two --",
        "Henry: Shouldn't you deal with the angry policewoman?",
        "Margo: Three --",
        "Mick: Barbara, tell Margo to relax.",
        "Margo: Four --",
        "Barbara: Margo, its okay! Wait! Nobody's hurt! It was just an accident!",
        "Margo: I want to hear my son say that.",
        "Mick: Speak now or forever hold your peace.",
        "Casey: I'm okay.",
        "Mick: Good boy. Must be every bride's dream, seeing her groom willing to die for her honor, such as it is.",
        "Emily: Will you stop it? Haven't you hurt her enough?",
        "Casey: What did you do to her? You drug her, threaten her?",
        "Mick: I didn't do anything. Girls always go for the bad boy. Just ask Barbara, or Emily, or your sweet, sweet mother. She and I were lovers once, as well.",
        "Henry: Don't take the bait.",
        "Casey: Alison would never go near you, much less -- what did he do to you?",
        "Alison: Let them go. You don't need them. Mick, look at me. This isn't you. I know you are somewhere in there.",
        "Mick: Mm, don't think he is.",
        "Alison: Did you kill the cop, the one who arrested you before, the one who you stole the gun from? What happened there?",
        "Mick: Ah, I see. Because if I haven't killed someone already, then the Mick part of me might be encouraged to let you go. Is that it?",
        "Alison: You are not a killer.",
        "Mick: The technique I used on the police officer can both incapacitate and kill. You start by placing your hand on the victim's neck.",
        "Casey: Get your hands off of her.",
        "Mick: And then it's just a simple matter of finding the right spot.",
        "Alison: Mick? Mick, it's you, isn't it?! Mick, stop this! Don't let him use you!",
        "Mick: Tie them up. Tie them both up. Tie her to her groom.",
        "Henry: With what?",
        "Mick: Oh, you're more useless than your brother. There is rope behind the altar. Get it.",
        "Barbara: How long have you been planning this?",
        "Mick: Pick up a collection basket, and pick up the cell phones.",
        "Emily: What are you gonna do with them?",
        "Mick: Quiet. Tie them both together. They need to talk things out.",
        "[Cell phone rings] [Mick groans] Hello.",
        "Margo: What happened in there?! Who did you shoot?",
        "Mick: No one yet. The gun went off. It was a mistake. Actually, we were playing quite nicely. My favorite family game, truth or dare.",
        "Margo: Casey and Alison aren't even family. Send them out.",
        "Mick: Uh, can't do that. Two of my best opponents.",
        "Margo: Send Paul out, then. He's been shot. He needs to go to the hospital.",
        "Mick: No one's leaving till I win the game.",
        "Emily: He's bleeding. You have to let Paul go.",
        "Paul: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Henry: Listen, Dad, you've missed out on a lot of family moments. I can tell that. So why don't you and I make up for that? We'll slip out of here. We'll have a -- we'll have a Haut Brion '82, maybe a steak. What do you say?",
        "Barbara: Henry, don't waste your breath. He is not your father. He's just been programmed to think like James. He's a poor imitation.",
        "Mick: [Growls] We're gonna go have a chat. One of you tries to escape, I kill them both.",
        "Alison: Emmy, he means it. Don't try to get away.",
        "Emily: No. Ali, no!",
        "Henry: No, no, stop. You're just gonna make him crazier than he already is.",
        "Paul: We're gonna be fine. We'll just do what he says.",
        "Emily: No. Alison won't. Oh, God, what she said. She called me \"Emmy.\" It's -- it's this thing she used to do when she was a little kid.",
        "Barbara: What did it mean?",
        "Emily: She's telling us to go.",
        "Mick: Did neither of you learn anything from your first marriages?",
        "Casey: I hope they gun you down.",
        "Alison: Casey --",
        "Mick: No, this is good. Let him go. We're sharing. Is there anything else you'd like to get off your chest? Don't be shy.",
        "Casey: When I get out of here, I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna tear you apart.",
        "Mick: Be careful. Your struggling is discomforting your wife, fianc\u00e9. Oh, we're rethinking that, are we?",
        "Casey: Get out of my face!",
        "Mick: I know that this is a personal matter between the two of you, but I fear that Alison will be a little uncomfortable broaching the subject, so, Casey, what are you gonna do when this is all done? Marry her, live your live in sin, become her porn producer? After all, she is quite skilled. [Gasps] Gasp, horror, shock. How could words so cruel come from the lips of the man who courted you, who claimed to love you?",
        "Alison: You're not Mick, not when you talk like that.",
        "Mick: James Stenbeck, now and always. I'm curious, Alison, how will you get Casey to forgive you? Will it be the born-again virgin routine, or will you release your inner wanton?",
        "Casey: Just get out of here! Leave us alone.",
        "Mick: All right. I do have hostages to tend to.",
        "Alison: Wait. Don't leave! Stay.",
        "Henry: Listen. If I have to choose between being shot, doing nothing, and shot trying to escape, I vote escape.",
        "Barbara: Well, we have to try now, because we're not gonna get another chance. Help me with Paul.",
        "Emily: We -- we cannot just leave Casey a -- and Alison here!",
        "Henry: Casey's a strong guy, and I didn't tie that rope as tight as I should have.",
        "Barbara: You said that she was buying us time anyway.",
        "Emily: Honey, are you gonna be able to do this?",
        "Paul: I couldn't run a marathon, but I can make it to the door.",
        "Barbara: Come on, Paul.",
        "Emily: Okay. Be careful.",
        "Alison: You told me how James Stenbeck took you under his wing, and he cared for you like a son. That's why you feel like it's your duty to defend him.",
        "Casey: Who cares?",
        "Mick: No one. Alison's trying to distract me. Do you think the message that you gave to your sister was lost on me? They should be just about ready to try and make their escape. You better hope I get there --",
        "[Gun cocks]",
        "Mick: Before they do. Otherwise, I'm gonna be very angry. I'm gonna have to punish Emily.",
        "Alison: Wait. It was my idea. Don't hurt her! Mick, please!",
        "Captain: You've got 10 minutes. After that, this is my operation.",
        "Margo: Understood.",
        "Tom: So, what are you gonna do?",
        "Margo: I'm gonna pray that Dante calls me in the next 10 minutes.",
        "Emily: Margo -- Margo, its Emily. Can you hear me?",
        "Margo: Emily! Emily, where's Dante?",
        "Emily: He's in the next room. Margo, you got to get us out of here. This door is locked. We can't get out.",
        "Margo: I need to get a battering ram for that. Emily, where is his exact position so we can take him out?",
        "Barbara: He took Alison and Casey somewhere! We don't know where! Hurry!",
        "Tom: What are you gonna do? Dante's in there with Casey. He hears the cops breaking in, he's gonna kill him!",
        "Margo: We got to get him out of there.",
        "Emily: Margo, I -- I don't know how much longer Paul can wait. Please hurry. [Gasps] [Sobs]",
        "Margo: Emily. Emily, what's going on?",
        "Paul: Let her go.",
        "Mick: Or what? You can't even walk on your own. Don't worry, Margo. I've got everything under control. You know how families get at weddings.",
        "Margo: What about Alison and Casey? What have you done with them?",
        "Mick: Well, they're working through some issues right now. I have a feeling there won't be a couple much longer.",
        "Emily: What have you done with Alison and Casey?",
        "Mick: I've merely stirred the pot. They're simmering now.",
        "Henry: Excuse me, Dad. Uh, Paul and I are your sons. You've got a score to settle, fine. I got nobody waiting or weeping for me. Just let them go, and I'll stay.",
        "Mick: There may be hope for you yet, Henry. But Paul is still the number-one son. I'm not done with him yet. If he disappoints, maybe I'll allow you to make the supreme sacrifice.",
        "Paul: You want to finish me off? Fine. You go ahead. You do whatever you want. But you let Emily go.",
        "Mick: Sorry. What's that? I couldn't hear you. Maybe I could hear you better if you were on your knees!",
        "Emily: Oh, God!",
        "[Paul screams]",
        "Emily: Stop.",
        "Mick: Now beg! Go on. Beg for her life.",
        "[Paul screams]",
        "Mick: You're actually considering it, aren't you? How could you after what she's done?",
        "Paul: She loves me.",
        "Mick: While you were waffling on her treatments, I offered to give her a child -- my child. Do you know what she said? Her only thought was how we could keep you in the dark about it.",
        "Emily: No, no! I never said that. You're twisting around my words!",
        "Mick: When I harvested her egg, she wasn't thinking about the deep, abiding love that you two supposedly share. All she wanted to know was she could get her hands on that baby.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Emily: That's not true! That's not true. I always wanted Paul's baby. It was always -- it was always to have a family with Paul. You gave me hope. You gave us hope, but there was no hope. You're a monster!",
        "Mick: Oh, I may be a monster, but you are nothing but a common whore who does what she has to to get what she wants. Now, do you want to beg for her life, son, or should I go ahead and make you a widower?",
        "Emily: No, God!",
        "Mick: Much less messy that way.",
        "Emily: Please, please tell me you don't believe him. Please.",
        "Paul: I detest -- but I love you more.",
        "[Emily sobs]",
        "Paul: I'm begging you -- please, I'm begging you, please, let Emily go.",
        "Mick: What is wrong with you? She didn't think twice about betraying you, and you are still begging for her life? You disgust me!",
        "Barbara: Stop it. Stop torturing him.",
        "Mick: Oh, here we go. Just like old days. Here comes mommy to save her little boy. How do you expect him to grow into a real man with you constantly smothering him?!",
        "Barbara: You are a freak. You are not his father.",
        "Mick: Oh, you're nobody's idea of a mother, either, Barbara, or a wife. I molded you. I enhanced what was beautiful about you. And how do you repay me? By turning my son into your lapdog?",
        "Barbara: What about all the times that you abused me, threatened me, deserted me? I was not about to let my son grow up to be anything like you -- like James!",
        "Mick: Your beauty is no longer dazzling, Barbara. I have no problem keeping a clear head.",
        "Henry: You don't know what beauty is, or bravery, but they begin with \"B,\" and they stand for Barbara! Oh, oh! Almost had him.",
        "Mick: [Laughs] Aiming a little low these days, Barbara, chasing after a man who's half your age who only seduced you to get my money, didn't you?",
        "Henry: Guilty as charged.",
        "Barbara: I do not regret my time with Henry.",
        "Mick: Spare me.",
        "Barbara: If I die now, I know that I will have been with a man 10 times better than James Stenbeck ever was!",
        "Mick: Well, well. If things don't work out for Alison and Casey, then you and Henry can get married. It would be a shame to waste all these flowers. Although we could save them for the funeral.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I know you won't talk to me. You probably hate me. And I don't blame you at all. But, Casey, will you please help with these knots. Casey, say something. Do something!",
        "Casey: You want me to do something?",
        "Alison: No!",
        "Casey: You want me to do something?",
        "Alison: Stop! Stop it! You're hurting me! I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: [Scoffs] When did it start? When you wouldn't sleep with me again, when you said you wanted to wait till our wedding? Were you doing it with him already?",
        "Alison: No, no. It was only once.",
        "Casey: When?",
        "Alison: It doesn't matter.",
        "Casey: When?",
        "Alison: A few days ago.",
        "Casey: What was it about him? I want to know! You owe me.",
        "Alison: He needed me. This thing James Stenbeck has done to him -- that's not who he is. He -- he tried to stop it. I saw that. I -- I saw --",
        "Casey: So -- so this one time you slept with him, it was gonna heal him? Was it out of pity?",
        "Alison: No. I don't know. I -- I can't explain why I did it. I -- I felt like I was in a dream even when I was awake.",
        "Casey: So were you drugged?",
        "Alison: No. I wish he had. I wish that I could blame this on him. But it was me. I don't know what it was about, but I couldn't -- I couldn't stop myself. And I know that it was wrong, and I'm so sorry.",
        "Casey: If you wanted him that badly, why --",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Casey: All this time, I thought I wasn't good enough for you. I knocked myself out trying to be better for you. But I guess the joke was on me. No, you haven't changed a bit. I should have known. Right before you married Aaron, you slept with Chris, and you turn around and do the same thing to me!",
        "Alison: You just almost tore Mick apart for calling me names, and now what are you calling me, Casey?",
        "Casey: God, I wish I could see your face right now. I want to be looking at you when I tell you I never want to see you again.",
        "Alison: Here's your chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Captain: I have sharpshooters in place and demolitionists ready to blow the door.",
        "Tom: Captain, can we have a moment. Listen, whatever happens, you're not to blame. You did the best that you could.",
        "Margo: Tom, that's our baby in there. There must have been something else I could say, some way I could change things.",
        "Tom: It's been impossible from the beginning. Dante is not rational. He's not gonna negotiate, and he's not gonna let them go.",
        "Margo: Today's Casey's birthday.",
        "Tom: I know.",
        "Margo: I just -- just want time back, time when both Casey and Adam were little and I could hold them and I could keep them. I could keep them safe.",
        "Tom: Honey, that's it. That's it!",
        "Margo: What? What are you talking about?",
        "Tom: What you said about the boys being little. I -- I have to get in touch with Reverend Shaw.",
        "Margo: W -- what? About what?",
        "Tom: Do you remember when -- when Adam did a Christmas pageant here? It was snowing.",
        "Margo: A tunnel. There's a tunnel.",
        "Tom: From the classrooms to the church.",
        "Margo: Yes, so they -- so they would stay warm. And the school is still there.",
        "Tom: I bet the tunnel's still there, too.",
        "Margo: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Get away from me! Where are you going?",
        "Alison: To stop Mick.",
        "Casey: Let the cops do that! If we're lucky, they'll shoot him.",
        "Alison: What are you going to do?",
        "Casey: We got to get out of here. And then I got to let my mom get back with the cops.",
        "Alison: If the cops rush Mick, he will panic, and he could hurt someone. I've got to talk to him.",
        "Casey: No, no, Ali. I can't let you go out there.",
        "Alison: Just let me go.",
        "Casey: I can't.",
        "Alison: You hate me now. Why don't you just let me go?",
        "Casey: When did you stop loving me? You had to stop loving me, right, to sleep with him?",
        "Alison: I do love you.",
        "Casey: You know -- I can't stop thinking about the other day when I came home and you were sleeping in the bed. It looked like you were dreaming, I guess, smiling. You looked so beautiful. Leaned down and kissed you on the face. You didn't even open your eyes. You reached back, and you kissed me. I thought you were dreaming about us, but now -- who were you really dreaming about? When you open your eyes, who do you want to see?",
        "Alison: You. I want you. I love you and -- and to be married to you for the rest of my life. Damn it. He is what I chose. And I can't change it, and I can't take it back.",
        "Casey: Please, don't go out there. Come with me. We'll go to the cops, and they'll keep us safe.",
        "Alison: I've got to try to get through to him. And if there is any part of you that wants to stop me, just don't.",
        "Casey: Ali -- Ali!",
        "Alison: I was dreaming of him. Remember that. I was dreaming about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: While you are in the begging mood, how about you beg me for forgiveness for the years of disrespect and betrayal for being a crushing disappointment?",
        "Paul: No. I'm -- I'm done. I'm done. I'm done begging.",
        "Mick: Sure about that?",
        "Paul: My whole life -- I've been scared of what my father can do to me. But even through a cyborg like you, he can't touch me, because I have something in my life that James Stenbeck never had or could even hope to understand.",
        "Mick: Enlighten me.",
        "Paul: Love. Love. The kind of love that James was never capable of giving to me or to anybody else. I love you.",
        "Emily: I love you.",
        "Paul: I love you, and I want to spend whatever time I have left loving you as much as you love me.",
        "Barbara: Game's over. You lose.",
        "Mick: Time you had left is up.",
        "Emily: No! [Crying]",
        "Barbara: Paul!",
        "Alison: Mick! Don't shoot. I'm ready to go. Just come with me. Mick, you don't belong in this church, and neither do I. We've both been pretending.",
        "Emily: Alison, please, stay away from him.",
        "Alison: He won't hurt me. And you won't hurt Casey, either. Casey's not why you're here. I heard what Paul said. James Stenbeck was incapable of love. But you're not. I know you're not.",
        "Mick: You don't know me.",
        "Alison: I know Mick Dante, and he's just as much James' prisoner as we are. And I know how you suffered, and I know how much you want to do what's right.",
        "Mick: Stop justifying what you've done! You cheated on your fianc\u00e9! You were not with him out of love. You were with him to get respect.",
        "Alison: No, that's not true.",
        "Mick: And you weren't drawn to Mick Dante out of compassion. It was lust -- lust for life, lust for a passionate, exciting life. He gave you things that this boy couldn't offer, and you jumped at it.",
        "Alison: No. No.",
        "Mick: You want me to believe you? You want me to go with you? Admit it. You tell him who you really are and why he will never be enough for you.",
        "Casey: She already did. She told me how she dreams about you, how she can't help herself and that she wants -- what she wants is you.",
        "Mick: You told him that?",
        "Alison: Please, come with me.",
        "Mick: No. Stay back. You betrayed me once, called in the cops. That's not gonna happen again.",
        "Alison: I was pretending, just trying to be the person I thought I should be. But that's over now, just like James Stenbeck is over. Mick -- come with me. I'm yours. I'm only yours.",
        "Casey: Alison.",
        "Margo: This guy is a Stenbeck clone. Stenbeck always has a way out. You guys blast in there, and you're gonna think that you've got him. He's gonna set up a decoy. It could be one of the hostages. It could be my son. Please. Come on, you've got kids. Please, you've got to let me do this.",
        "Captain: All right. We'll cover the other exits.",
        "Margo: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Please. This church is giving me the creeps.",
        "Henry: Yeah, that's a good idea, before Daddio comes back and finishes us off, right?",
        "Margo: Where is he? Where's Dante?",
        "Henry: He's gone.",
        "Emily: Yeah, thanks to Alison. She offered herself in our place.",
        "Tom: Casey?",
        "Barbara: He went after them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: We have to keep moving. The police are gonna know by now that we ran away, okay? Come on.",
        "Mick: I'm gonna keep moving on my own. You're a little conspicuous in that wedding dress.",
        "Alison: Well, where are you gonna go? Are you gonna run away?",
        "Mick: Gathering details for the police, Alison?",
        "Alison: No, I --",
        "Mick: Look, you don't have to keep pretending you care about me. Everyone's safe.",
        "Alison: Mick -- it's you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay, lay down. Are you okay? You all right? Margo, where the hell is the ambulance?",
        "Margo: They're sending it in now.",
        "Barbara: [Sighs] Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Henry: Its okay, it's okay. That's what it's there for.",
        "Tom: Any word on Casey?",
        "Margo: I'm going after him.",
        "Tom: Well, where's your backup?",
        "Margo: Practically the entire police force is looking for this guy.",
        "Tom: Well, I'm not married to them. Call for backup.",
        "Margo: I am not taking anyone off this search. This is a hunt. I'm not sending anyone on a hunch. I'm gonna go. I got to get to him before it's too late.",
        "Tom: I want you both coming out of there safe. Do you hear me?",
        "Margo: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mick: What is it?",
        "Alison: It's a change. You were just so completely him, and I kept looking and waiting for you to show up. Just when you do it, it's so fast and --",
        "Mick: Scary?",
        "Alison: Sad that James can just completely take you over like that, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. It must be awful.",
        "Mick: What's awful is knowing that you don't trust me anymore.",
        "Alison: Can he come back?",
        "Mick: I'm glad that you saved Paul and everyone in the church, and I'm really grateful that you tried to save me, but you don't have to keep pretending that you care about me.",
        "Alison: I do care about you, Mick.",
        "Mick: I'm sorry for a lot of the things that I've done. I'm sorry that James takes me over. I'm sorry that I shot Paul. I'm sorry for all the cruel things that I said and did in that church. I am not sorry that I stopped you from getting married.",
        "Alison: You hurt Casey. We both did.",
        "Mick: Better to hurt him now than destroy him later. You did not want to be Mrs. Casey Hughes.",
        "Alison: No. I truly wanted to be his wife.",
        "Mick: You wanted to belong to someone.",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Mick: And you do. I love you. I know I don't deserve you, but I love you.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Mick: What? Why are you smiling?",
        "Alison: Because -- it's you again. It's really you.",
        "Mick: I know that I have no right to ask this, but, um, would you be with me? Would you come with me, whatever happens?",
        "Casey: Alison!",
        "Alison: No! You'll have to shoot me first.",
        "Casey: No, get out of the way.",
        "Margo: Police! Drop the gun, Dante. Drop it!",
        "Mick: Good-bye, Alison.",
        "[Tires screech]",
        "Mick: Oh, my God!",
        "Alison: Mick! Mick!",
        "Emily: I don't know what I would do if I lost you.",
        "Paul: I'm right here. Come on. My father, in the flesh or in the spirit or otherwise is never gonna hurt me again.",
        "Emily: James has a way of coming back to haunt us every time.",
        "Paul: I'm a new man. Did you hear what I said? Did you? Give us a baby.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, no. No.",
        "Paul: We can start right here.",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Paul: Come here.",
        "Emily: No, just listen -- listen to what I have to say, okay? You -- you said it. You said it from the very beginning, but I wouldn't listen to you. You're right. We don't need a child to fill this gap in our lives. We have each other.",
        "Paul: That's enough for you?",
        "Emily: You bet it is.",
        "Barbara: What are you still doing here?",
        "Henry: [Sighs] You gave me a look after I said that no one would be waiting or weeping for me.",
        "Barbara: Because you were wrong. You have Katie.",
        "Henry: Not even close.",
        "Barbara: Look, you took me to the wedding to make her jealous.",
        "Henry: I took you to the wedding because I was jealous. I wanted to be with Katie, but she doesn't see me that way. And you do.",
        "Barbara: But I'm old and desperate.",
        "Henry: That is exactly how James wanted you to feel. You need to get back to who you were -- strong, sexy. You beat cancer, Barbara. That's a lot tougher than James Stenbeck.",
        "Barbara: Thanks for trying to buck me up.",
        "Henry: I'm just trying to remind you of what you already knew. The years have made you better. You're not that wimpy, sappy ing\u00e9nue that fell in love with the wrong guy, okay? You are a formidable woman -- a woman who fights and wins. And quite frankly, you're more gorgeous than ever.",
        "Barbara: You need to leave. You need to go out there and find yourself a woman with more staying power than Vienna and more insight than Katie and someone who's a lot younger than me.",
        "Henry: You know what you need to do? You need to turn around. You need to lie on your back. And you need to close your eyes. And you need to stay right here.",
        "Barbara: That feels really good.",
        "Henry: It does feel really good. That's all that matters.",
        "Barbara: For now.",
        "Henry: For now.",

        "Alison: Is -- is he gonna make it?",
        "EMT: You're a nurse, Alison. You know the drill.",
        "Alison: Internal injuries?",
        "EMT: Doesn't look good.",
        "Tom: Hey. How are you?",
        "Casey: A little rope burn, but I'm fine. How's, uh, Granddad and Kim? Uh, Mom said you went to check on them.",
        "Tom: Yeah, I did. They're -- they're fine. Where's Alison?",
        "Margo: That's what Casey wanted to talk to us about.",
        "Casey: Together, so I only have to say it once.",
        "Tom: What is it?",
        "Casey: Back there, I found out that Alison slept with Mick.",
        "Tom: Oh --",
        "Margo: I don't understand. Did -- did they know each other before he came to Oakdale?",
        "Casey: No, no.",
        "Margo: Then when?",
        "Casey: A few days ago.",
        "Tom: Did Dante tell you this?",
        "Casey: Alison admitted it.",
        "Tom: Well, maybe she just did that to pacify him in the heat of the moment.",
        "Casey: No. She meant it.",
        "Margo: That's why he wouldn't release her in the first round of hostages?",
        "Casey: Yeah. But it's -- its good he didn't. She really got through to him. If she hadn't, I don't know how many people would have died today.",
        "Tom: Aw, Case --",
        "Casey: Can we just go home? I want to get this suit off.",
        "Margo: I have to check on Dante's status.",
        "Casey: Okay. I'll wait in the car.",
        "Margo: Okay. We'll be right there. How could she do that to him?",
