        "Chris: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Alison, we came here to rent an apartment, not buy one. You have to cut her some slack. I'm sorry. She gets a little enthusiastic sometimes.",
        "Alison: Well, just picture it, Chris. With furniture all in it -- our furniture. With, like, a big, poofy couch right over there.",
        "Chris: Yeah, Alison, I don't think I have your imagination. All I see is empty.",
        "Realtor: Well, here. Here's a brochure. I can give you a tour of one of our model units. And that's furnished, of course.",
        "Alison: There. What more do you want? And can we do it now? I wanna close the deal as soon as possible.",
        "Realtor: Follow me.",
        "Alison: Okay. I love what you're doing.",
        "Chris: What am I doing?",
        "Alison: Pretending not to like the place so we can get a lower price. You are so smart. And handsome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Granted, lying generally isn't a good thing, but --",
        "Ben: Wait -- generally isn't a good thing?",
        "Jessica: But you have to admit, in this case, lying to Sarah has produced some major benefits.",
        "Ben: I'll admit that there has been a change in Sarah's attitude. Since you told her that you've been giving Bonnie her letters, she has been cooperative, responsible, a whole different person. But if that change is based on something that isn't true, the whole thing's gonna come back on you, Jess. I can guarantee --",
        "Sarah: Hey!",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Sarah: You're home early.",
        "Jessica: Ben's working the late shift. So I wanted to spend a little time with him before he went to work.",
        "Ben: So, how are you, Sarah? How was school today?",
        "Sarah: Um, well -- actually, I have some news. I got elected to the student council.",
        "Jessica: You're kidding! That is wonderful.",
        "Sarah: Thanks. You think Bonnie will be proud?",
        "Jessica: Of course she will.",
        "Sarah: I can't wait to tell her. I'm going to go write to her now.",
        "Jessica: And congratulations again! Now, you see that? A couple of weeks ago, she wouldn't have been running for anything.",
        "Ben: You know, there's one problem with a house of cards. Just a little gust of wind, the whole thing comes crashing down.",
        "Jessica: Maybe, but by then -- you're just never going to get this, huh?",
        "Ben: The positive side of telling lies to a troubled teenager? No, Jess, I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I am not trying to be a hero, Lucy. But whatever Clark did, he hurt you. And he's gonna pay for it.",
        "Lucy: Is he? Other people have hurt me a lot worse.",
        "Aaron: You talking about me?",
        "Lucy: At least Clark didn't say he loved me first.",
        "Aaron: That's not fair, Luce.",
        "Lucy: It's not fair. You know, I've said that myself. It's not fair you slept with Alison. It's not fair that you married her. Maybe now you know how it feels.",
        "Aaron: What do you want from me?",
        "Lucy: I want you to stop pretending that I'm your responsibility. Just because Alison doesn't need you anymore, doesn't mean I do.",
        "Aaron: I'm just happy you're all right.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry you had to see that.",
        "Paul: Oh, no, please. Don't worry about me. You okay?",
        "Lucy: Fine.",
        "Paul: Lucy, I agree with Aaron about something. This guy, Clark, needs to be stopped. He drugged you, Lucy. And I think we both know what would've happened if I hadn't shown up when I showed up. You need to go to the police, and you need to fill out a report.",
        "Lucy: I told you, I don't want to make a big thing out of this.",
        "Paul: I know. You just want the whole thing to go away. But if you don't stop him now, he's just going to hurt someone else. We'll go see your Aunt Margo. I'm sure she can protect you.",
        "Lucy: Margo's busy with Katie and my Dad. I'd hate to give her one more thing to worry about.",
        "Paul: All right then -- I do have one other suggestion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Thanks for letting us come over, Jack.",
        "Jack: Sure. What's up?",
        "Lucy: I, um -- I went on a date last night with this guy I go to school with. I can't believe I actually thought he was a nice guy. He, um --",
        "Paul: He put a drug in her drink and tried to rape her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Rosanna -- where's she going?",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "Craig: You're lying.",
        "Carly: No, she said she needed to get away. No details.",
        "Craig: Come on, Carly. Warm, cold -- what? Give me a clue. Help me out.",
        "Carly: You wanna know something, Craig? Even if I knew where Rosanna was going, I wouldn't tell you.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no. You'd make me sweat, but you'd come through. Come on -- what?",
        "Carly: Not if you tortured me. Because I love my sister. And she will be happier without you",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You lied to Rosanna over and over again. What did you think was going to happen, Craig? She would just accept that way of life?",
        "Craig: Wha -- what are you talking about? We were in a good place, I -- I thought.",
        "Carly: Do you honestly believe that?",
        "Craig: Hey, Carly, I tried. I did my best.",
        "Carly: We can't change who we are. And who you are is an arrogant, self- absorbed, soulless man with no regard for the truth. Rosanna learned that the hard way, Craig. And that's why she's finished with you. I've known it for a long time. And I will not be around it anymore.",
        "Craig: So what. I'll get Rosanna on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: You want the good news now? Or shall I string it out until you're at the breaking point?",
        "Kim: The board voted to reinstate Chris?",
        "Bob: It was unanimous!",
        "Kim: Oh, that's wonderful! Oh, isn't that wonderful news? Oh, I'm so glad. We gotta go out and celebrate. Just the thr -- I was going to say just the three of us.",
        "Bob: Wishful thinking, huh?",
        "Kim: I guess so. Especially considering the fact that Chris and Alison are out looking at apartments.",
        "Bob: Well, maybe they won't find one. Maybe they'll get into a huge argument, decide that they're making a terrible mistake and never talk to each other again.",
        "Kim: We shouldn't be doing this. Chris wants to be with Alison, and you and I have to stay out of it.",
        "Bob: You've been talking to my mother again.",
        "Kim: What was your first clue? I just don't understand. I mean, once you get past that blonde, blue-eyed, \"I'm so vulnerable\" -- I mean, what's so irresistible about her? She has no goals in life. She has no education --",
        "Bob: Didn't somebody say that we shouldn't be doing this?",
        "Kim: It was your mother. And she's not here now.",
        "Bob: Okay, I know this is tough. It's tough on me, too. I mean, I thought that Chris would wind up with somebody around his own age, maybe a fellow doctor. Or at least somebody who can get me tickets to the bears' game.",
        "[Kim sighs]",
        "Kim: You're gonna keep making jokes?",
        "Bob: And you'd better keep laughing. Because if we stop laughing --",
        "Kim: I know, I know, honey, I know. I just -- it's so hard. I try, but -- Chris and Alison are just a disaster waiting to happen, and there's not a thing we can do about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Did you see the kitchen? It kind of makes me wanna cook.",
        "Chris: Really?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I could get, like, a bunch of cookbooks and have dinner waiting for you when you get home.",
        "Chris: And I could buy you an apron for your birthday, and you'd like that?",
        "Alison: And during the summer, we could have dinner on the terrace. And did you see the hot tub? I could buy, like, a million candles, and it would be our own little paradise.",
        "Chris: You mean staying at my parents' house isn't paradise?",
        "Alison: Well, we could have parties and invite everyone we know. I know that it's natural to be a little nervous. But -- I am, too. But we'd be starting our own -- our new life. And I know that we would be happy. Please, Chris, just think about it.",
        "Chris: No, I'm still thinking about us in that hot tub. Oh!",
        "Alison: Chris!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: My knees wouldn't work. I was spinning. And the next thing I knew, he was all over me.",
        "Paul: I was in the parking lot, and I heard a noise. So, I went to the car, and I pulled the guy off of her.",
        "Jack: All this happened after you had the drink he gave you? And there was no alcohol in the drink itself? Its okay, you can tell me.",
        "Lucy: No. It was ginger ale. But he kept saying I should finish it so we could get out on the dance floor. I -- I should've known what he was doing. I was just --",
        "Paul: Lucy, don't do that to yourself. There's no way you could've known what was going on.",
        "Jack: Paul's right. But after what you told me, it does sound like you were drugged.",
        "Paul: So, what does she do?",
        "Jack: Unfortunately, not much. That's one of the problems with cases like this. To bring charges, the police have to be brought in while it's happening so we can order blood tests. Everything's on record.",
        "Lucy: Is it too late to take one now?",
        "Jack: Whatever this Clark guy gave you, it's most likely out of your system now, Lucy.",
        "Paul: What about an eyewitness? I mean, I saw the guy trying to force himself on her. Doesn't that count for something?",
        "Jack: A teenage kid getting aggressive with his date -- and he could say that she encouraged him.",
        "Lucy: But that's not true.",
        "Jack: I know that, but it's your word against his.",
        "Paul: So, this kid just gets away with it?",
        "Jack: Oh, I didn't say that. Not enough evidence to bring charges. But I could have a little talk with him, off the record.",
        "Lucy: What will you say?",
        "Jack: I'd suggest that he finds another way to be popular. Only it wouldn't be much of a suggestion.",
        "Lucy: Thanks. I kind of wanted to forget about this whole thing.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm glad that you didn't. Kids like Clark have to be stepped on early.",
        "Lucy: I'm glad, too. But there is one more thing the two of you could do for me.",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah, sure. What is it?",
        "Lucy: Don't tell anybody about this. Especially my father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So, the plane is owned by Cabot Industries. I need just need to know where it went.",
        "Airport employee: I'm sorry, sir, I'm not allowed to give out that information.",
        "Craig: Well, the plane is owned by my wife.",
        "Airport employee: Then perhaps you should ask her.",
        "Craig: Was that supposed to be funny? All right, look -- how much? What do you want? Hundred -- two hundred? What? How much? How much?",
        "Airport employee: I'm going to call security.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. You're not calling anybody until you tell me what --",
        "Margo: Craig, Craig --! O.P.D. -- I'll take it from here.",
        "Airport employee: Thank you.",
        "Margo: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: I was trying to find out were Rosanna went, and that idiot wouldn't tell me where the plane went.",
        "Margo: You fake a heart attack, you sneak out of the hospital behind my back -- I think at the very least I get to slap you or something.",
        "Craig: You don't want to do that.",
        "Margo: Yes, I do! I'm worried about you, Craig. I love you.",
        "Craig: You never let me down, Margo. I just wish some others would learn from your example.",
        "Margo: You know what you need to do, Craig? You need to go back to the hospital. 'Cause John was right.",
        "Craig: No, no!",
        "Margo: You need to be examined before you can be discharged.",
        "Craig: There is nothing wrong with me that finding Rosanna won't fix. In fact, can't you lean on somebody and find out where that plane went?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I could. But I won't.",
        "Craig: I just need to talk to Rosanna.",
        "Margo: Why don't you just go home, Craig? Just go home and take a good long look at yourself. And think about how you can change. Because if you don't do that, Rosanna and Cabot aren't the only people you're going to lose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You know, it's not like I'm enjoying this. And I could use a little support.",
        "Ben: Hey, well, that's what I'm doing. I am giving you the support you need to tell Sarah the truth.",
        "Jessica: So, you're suggesting I make a full confession?",
        "Ben: As soon as possible.",
        "Jessica: One day I will. When my relationship with Sarah is stronger. But if I tell her now, she could lose confidence in me. And I may never gain that back.",
        "Ben: Look, Sarah already knows that bonnie has been ordered not to have any contact with her. And you have a responsibility as an officer of the court. Now, I'm sure that Sarah can understand and accept that. She's certainly not going to want to jeopardize your career.",
        "Sarah: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Sarah: I'm headed to the kitchen. Anybody want anything?",
        "Jessica: No, that's okay. So, listen, how's the homework situation?",
        "Sarah: Ah -- just math. It looks pretty easy.",
        "Jessica: Perfect. Because in celebration of your being elected to the student council, I think we should go on a shopping spree.",
        "Sarah: Are you serious?",
        "Jessica: Deadly serious.",
        "Sarah: Okay, I'll go wait in the car.",
        "Ben: Jess --",
        "Jessica: Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Place is falling apart already.",
        "Alison: Are you okay?",
        "Chris: I'm fine. But this place --",
        "Alison: No, no. It was just one thing. They probably just haven't nailed it in yet.",
        "Chris: Yeah, or maybe they weren't going to bother.",
        "Alison: No, but they're still working on the place. You saw the pictures. Once it's finished, it's going to be perfect.",
        "Chris: I'm sure it will be, Ali. Only --",
        "Alison: You just don't want to live here with me.",
        "Chris: No, no. An hour ago, we were talking about renting. And now we're talking about buying. It's a total 180.",
        "Alison: I know. But that's what's so exciting.",
        "Chris: Ali, I'm all for excitement, and you know that. Okay? But we make a commitment like this, I mean, we could be stuck with it for years.",
        "Alison: Are you talking about the condo or me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Daddy? I guess he's not back yet.",
        "Paul: I'm gonna stay here until he does get back.",
        "Lucy: No, please. You've already done so much.",
        "Paul: I haven't done a thing. Please, stop saying that. So, what's it like to live at Fairwinds?",
        "Lucy: It's great. At least it was.",
        "Paul: Why, what does that mean?",
        "Lucy: So many rooms and no noise. With Cabot and Rosanna gone, it'll be kind of lonely.",
        "Paul: I hope not. I don't think I ever remember anybody ever being happy here.",
        "Lucy: My Dad and Rosanna were. Most of the time, anyway.",
        "Paul: My mother had some of the worst moments of her life in this room right here.",
        "Lucy: You think the house is cursed?",
        "[Paul laughs]",
        "Paul: No, I -- wouldn't go that far. I'm not so sure I believe in curses. Just saying I'm not sure I'd want to live here.",
        "Lucy: Well, I would move out tomorrow if I could. But then my Dad would be alone.",
        "Paul: Lucy, I overheard Rosanna telling you that looking after your father is not your job. And I think that's probably true.",
        "Craig: What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: I just brought Lucy home. We were waiting here for you.",
        "Craig: Get out of my home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Lucy, what are doing with -- this is not a friend to our family.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, Paul's -- Paul's been amazing to me.",
        "Craig: Oh, I'm sure he has.",
        "Paul: Your daughter's having a rough time, Craig.",
        "Craig: What does that mean?",
        "Paul: She's very upset about Rosanna leaving. I'm just trying to help her out.",
        "Craig: Lucy's my daughter. Good-bye.",
        "Paul: Didn't mean to intrude.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucy: Paul --",
        "Craig: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: Paul, I -- I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: No, no. Please, you don't need to be sorry. It's nothing that you've done. Look, if I were you -- ah, never mind.",
        "Lucy: No, what? Please.",
        "Paul: Your father's very angry and he's going to be looking for someone to take that out on.",
        "Lucy: My father would never hurt me.",
        "Paul: Not on purpose, no. I don't think he would. But he's miserable. And when people are miserable, they tend to make the people around them miserable, too. Do you have my number?",
        "Lucy: Thanks. Well, that was embarrassing.",
        "Craig: I'm not going to argue about a bloodsucker like Paul Ryan. With Rosanna and Cabot gone, you and I are gonna need each other a lot more than ever.",
        "Lucy: Well, I don't want to argue either. But I can't stay here with you, Daddy. I'm sorry, I just can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You know, it's like everything Lucy and I have been to each other -- you know, all the good stuff, all the memories -- it's like nothing. It's like it never happened. I went there to help her and she told me to get out. Oh, come on. Please, don't tell me you think she was right.",
        "Curtis: All right, I won't say it.",
        "Aaron: I mean, I made my mistakes -- we all do. All right? And I guess I just don't expect her to forget about them, you know? But --",
        "Curtis: Yeah, but what?",
        "Aaron: Nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Listen, you can't fool me. I know the only reason you took me shopping was so you could get little those shoes for yourself.",
        "[Jessica laughs]",
        "Jessica: Well, if you tell Ben how much they cost, you're grounded until you're 30.",
        "Curtis: Hey, you guys.",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Sarah: Hey.",
        "Curtis: Is it Christmas again already?",
        "Jessica: Well, we just thought we'd do a little celebrating. Sarah was elected to student council.",
        "Curtis: All right, all right!",
        "Jessica: Ah! That is so cold.",
        "[Sarah laughs]",
        "Curtis: So, you want to show me what you got?",
        "Sarah: I'll do a fashion show when we get home. Could you order me something to drink? I'll just go wash my hands. I'll be right back.",
        "Jessica: Sure, sure.",
        "Curtis: So, then, everything's cool?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, why shouldn't it be?",
        "Curtis: I don't know. I mean, Sarah was acting kind of jumpy last night --",
        "Jessica: Jumpy? What do you mean \"jumpy\"?",
        "Curtis: Asking questions about trust -- how you can tell if a person's lying or not. But you two are good, so she must've meant somebody else.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, well -- I'll ask her what's going on. I won't mention that you said anything.",
        "Curtis: Thanks. I gotta run.",
        "Jessica: Okay. [Jessica remembering] So, you're suggesting I make a full confession?",
        "Ben: As soon as possible.",
        "Sarah: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Hey.",
        "Sarah: Let's order something to eat. I'm starving. Shopping tires me out.",
        "Jessica: Sure, let's sit down.",
        "Sarah: Okay.",
        "Jessica: Um, listen, Sarah, before we order anything, there's something I want to discuss with you. Um --",
        "Sarah: Sure.",
        "Jessica: Your letters to Bonnie.",
        "Sarah: Oh, yeah. You know what I like best about my letters to Bonnie? It's like -- I don't know, I feel like she's still watching out for me. Like, no matter what happens at school or at home, nothing can hurt me. It's kind of crazy, you know?",
        "Jessica: No, no. Not at all.",
        "Sarah: Well, thank you. And it's all because of you. Sending my letters to Bonnie -- I mean, it's one of the nicest things anyone's ever done for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Look, Ali, my commitment to you has nothing to do with where we live. I love you. And I am going to prove that to you every day for the rest of our lives.",
        "Alison: I guess I'm just still getting used to that. Well, okay -- I guess if you don't want to buy a place then we can just keep looking for rentals.",
        "Chris: No, no, no. I didn't say that I don't want to buy it. Okay? It's just -- we're gonna need a down payment, and that's a lot of cash.",
        "Alison: I've got some. There's some money my Dad put in an account for me awhile ago, and I have some money from working at the hospital --",
        "Chris: No, no, Ali. I don't want you to dip into your savings. I'm just trying to figure it out if I can swing it myself.",
        "Alison: You're sure? Seriously?",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I have some money in the bank. Bonds that were bought for me when I was born. Plus, all the money I've been saving since I've been living at home -- and you know what, Ali?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Chris: I can't think of any other way I'd like to spend it.",
        "Alison: Oh, my gosh -- we're going to have our very own place!",
        "Realtor: Excuse me. You want me to come back later?",
        "Chris: No. Actually, we would like for you to draw up some contracts.",
        "Realtor: Well, I could tell you guys were smart. Chris, Alison -- I'll get those papers started right away.",
        "Chris: Yes. Would you mind if we waited here?",
        "Realtor: Okay. Well, it's your place.",
        "Alison: Did you hear that? This is our very own place! Oh! [Chris sighs] And I'm going to paint each wall a different color. I can get some of those floor pillows. Make this place, like, super comfy.",
        "Chris: Wait -- Ali, this place isn't gonna be ready for a long time. I mean, where are we gonna live until then?",
        "Alison: I don't know. We can find something cheap. Like that place I had with Aaron.",
        "Chris: That might work.",
        "Alison: Well, whatever. We'll figure it out. I can't believe this. After everything, we finally get a happy ending.",

        "Carly: I did. Craig didn't leave her any choice.",
        "Jack: How is she doing?",
        "Carly: She's unbelievably brave. She had the next 20 years of her life all planned out. And now --",
        "Jack: Oh, honey --",
        "Carly: It's gone.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Cabot and I'm sorry that Craig had to prove what a low-life he is. But look -- Rosanna still has you. And when she gets back, we'll both help her put her life back together.",
        "Carly: What makes you think she's coming back?",
        "Jack: Did she tell you any different?",
        "Carly: She told me she's never going to live in this town again.",
        "Jack: Well, that's what she feels now. But it could change.",
        "Carly: I don't think so, Jack. She didn't even give me an idea of where she was going. All she gave me -- was this.",

        "Realtor: Okay, your monthly maintenance fee breaks down like this. And I'm obligated by law to tell you that number can go up at any time. And your total payment for each month -- there. Any questions?",

        "Chris: I mean that we can't rent another apartment.",
        "Alison: So then what are we supposed to do? Go back to living with our parents? It would be torture if I had to go back to my mom's.",
        "Chris: All right. All right. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Look, we got a little ahead of ourselves. We're not going to be able to --",

        "Craig: What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you rejecting me for some reason?",
        "Lucy: I'm not rejecting you, Daddy. I'm angry about what you did, but that doesn't mean I don't still love you.",
        "Craig: All I did was try to make us all happy, okay? So just stay. We can get through this together. Just sit down. Please.",
        "Lucy: This place just makes me too sad. Everywhere I look, I see Cabot and Rosanna.",
        "Craig: Well -- so we'll have a ritual cleansing. We'll put Rosanna's stuff in storage. And Cabot's, we'll -- we'll -- give to charity. Huh?",
        "Lucy: That's not gonna fix it.",
        "Craig: Well, I -- I know it's too formal. We can sit down with a designer and make it a fun space where we can hang out -- you can hang out with your friends. You can have parties and -- huh? Huh?",
        "Lucy: That's really sweet of you, Daddy. But it doesn't change anything.",
        "Craig: Look -- you have to give yourself some time with this. I know, I know. It's gonna take a few days. Give it a few days.",
        "Lucy: I can't wait a few days. I'm afraid if I don't leave tonight, then I never will. So will you please just let me go --",
        "Craig: Hey, I want you to get out there. I want you to show the world what you -- but not now, sweetness. Please, please, not now.",
        "Lucy: I already called grandmother. She thinks it's a good idea that I go stay with her.",

        "Carly: You finished?",
        "Jack: It's out of my system.",
        "Carly: She insisted that I take it. She was so gracious about it and loving about it. She made it seem like I'd be doing her a favor.",
        "Jack: Honey, she loves you a lot. She made that clear, even before the check.",
        "Carly: I would much prefer to have her around than any amount of money. But I took it. Because I think -- I think maybe she's right.",

        "Carly: Rosanna wants me to use her money to start my own company, Jack. She wants me to be the designer that she thinks I can be -- the designer that I am. And I'm going to do it, Jack. I'm going to give it everything I've got.",
        "Jack: Great! Honey, you -- 100% support from me.",
        "Carly: When we were at the party for B.R.O. And the flash bulbs were going off and people were asking me about my dress -- I forgot how much that I loved that world, Jack. And then Rosanna offers me that kind of money and -- it just seemed like perfect timing.",
