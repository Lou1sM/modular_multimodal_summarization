        "Emily: Hey. Hey, you okay? You in any pain? Can I get you anything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hope Liberty's chemo goes easier today.",
        "Janet: So do I. The last couple times were really rough on her. I'd do anything to take her place.",
        "Jack: I know, I know. I tell you what. You make sure she gets through today. When I get home, I'll take care of you.",
        "Liberty: \"Possible bone-marrow donor list.\" Mom, what is this?",
        "Janet: Nothing.",
        "Liberty: What is this?",
        "Janet: It's nothing. It's just a list. It's no big deal, okay?",
        "Liberty: No big deal? If you're looking for bone-marrow donors, that means my chemo isn't working, Mom. What's happening? Am I dying?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Wow. You sure know how to dress to impress.",
        "Carly: Well, it's worth the effort if, uh, Morris Calman invests in Monte Carlo.",
        "Craig: A few things we need to go over before Morris gets here.",
        "Carly: You already faxed me the financials.",
        "Craig: It's not about the numbers. Economy being what it is, I haven't been able to find anyone else willing to back us, so this has to be played exactly right or Monte Carlo is not going to happen.",
        "Carly: Well, I told you, I'm up to speed. What else do you want me to do?",
        "Craig: Pretend to like me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: It's not what you think.",
        "Casey: None of it was.",
        "Alison: I was doing rounds, and I was just wondering how Mick was doing.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I hope the guy makes a full recovery so once he gets out, the cops can throw him into jail for the rest of his miserable life.",
        "Alison: Casey, he ruined my wedding, too, okay? If I had known what he was capable of --?",
        "Casey: You slept with him! You didn't know what he was capable of?",
        "Alison: I never expected that to happen.",
        "Casey: Neither did I. You know, I expected to be on my honeymoon today, but obviously, you and your boyfriend there had other plans.",
        "Alison: Casey, please.",
        "Casey: Just please what?",
        "Alison: Please don't hate me.",
        "[Casey scoffs]",
        "Alison: I know I messed everything up. I don't know how to tell you how sorry I am.",
        "Casey: So don't. Whatever you have to say isn't gonna cut it.",
        "Alison: I love you.",
        "Casey: You expect me to believe that after what you did?",
        "Alison: What happened with Mick --?",
        "Casey: What happened was you chose him. You dreamt about him. Isn't that what you said?",
        "Alison: I didn't mean for you to get hurt. I -- I wish that I could take it back. I wish that I was stronger. And I tried so hard --",
        "Casey: Obviously not hard enough.",
        "Alison: God, it was a one-time thing, Casey. Please, don't let this cancel out our whole relationship.",
        "Casey: You slept with him. How can you say you love me if you slept with him?",
        "Alison: Don't you dare tell me that I didn't love you. I do love you. I wanted to marry you!",
        "Casey: Why? Why would you want to marry me if you were so miserable already that you had to go with another guy?",
        "Alison: I wasn't miserable. I was never miserable, not for one second. I never stopped loving you.",
        "Casey: Don't tell me these lies. Just stay away from me, okay? I'm done.",
        "Alison: Tina, will you cover for me, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Alison was right. Mick was -- was on your father's payroll. He was under your father's control.",
        "Paul: That doesn't make it okay, Emily. He hurt you. He shot me. He ruined your sister's wedding. He was ready to kill everybody. That is not okay. He needs to pay for what he's done.",
        "Emily: I think he already has.",
        "Paul: Well, not as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Emily: It doesn't matter, okay? The police are gonna deal with Mick. You, on the other hand, need to take care of yourself. Bob told me that the -- the bullet almost damaged your femoral artery. You could have died. Missed it by a hair.",
        "Paul: Because on top of everything else, he's a lousy shot, Mick Dante.",
        "Emily: You are not allowed to joke anymore, okay? I almost lost you. Stop kidding around.",
        "Paul: I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "[Whispering]",
        "Emily: I thought I turned this off.",
        "Paul: Get it.",
        "Emily: It's, uh -- it's Hunter. I -- I forgot. I have a conference call. I'm -- I'm gonna reschedule.",
        "Paul: No. Why don't you go take it? Hey, I'm still your boss. Go take the call.",
        "Emily: Excuse me? You're my investor. Big, big difference. But you know what? If you -- if you promise to forget about Mick, focus on getting better, I'll let you boss me around later. How about that?",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Emily: I love you.",
        "Paul: I love you.",
        "Emily: Sorry.",
        "[Paul groans]",
        "Paul: Ow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, you're not dying. You're doing great.",
        "Liberty: Right.",
        "Janet: No, I know this is hard on you, but you know how sometimes they say the cure can be worse than the disease? I know you're feeling run-down, but that's because the chemo's working.",
        "Liberty: Mom, then why are you looking for bone-marrow donors?",
        "Janet: Because Susan Stewart said it would be a good idea for us to look for a match so that we're not scrambling around at the last minute, trying to find, you know, a donor, just in case, well, God forbid things take a turn.",
        "Liberty: And you don't think that's gonna happen?",
        "Janet: No, not at all.",
        "Liberty: So this is just a precaution?",
        "Janet: And a distraction. Keeps me busy. Keeps me from hovering.",
        "Liberty: That's good.",
        "Janet: And the most important thing of all is that once you're well, these names are all gonna be in the national registry, so they can save somebody else's life. And that's all because of you.",
        "Liberty: Can you swear to me that you're telling me the truth right now?",
        "Janet: I swear I am telling you the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, okay? I just need to feel like I'm doing something to help you. And if that means I have to call every human being on the planet with a drop of Snyder blood, then damn it, I'm gonna do it.",
        "Liberty: I can still tell you're kind of worried, mom.",
        "Janet: Honey, I'm your mother. It's what I do. You know me. Here. Put your coat on. We have to get to our appointment. We don't want to be late, okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Janet: All right, Sweetie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What do you mean I have to pretend to like you?",
        "Craig: I let him believe that you and I have worked out our differences in a positive, dare I say affectionate way and that we're thrilled to work together again.",
        "Carly: You did not.",
        "Craig: He's happy for us. That's why he took the meeting.",
        "Carly: He's happy for us?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Did you tell him we're a couple?",
        "Craig: No, no, no. He misunderstood, and I just didn't bother correcting him.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] Oh, I see. So now I have to act like I'm your -- your girlfriend and bat my eyes and -- oh, I can't believe you.",
        "Craig: It's only for an hour or so.",
        "Carly: You know what? Forget it. We don't even have financing, and you're already manipulating me.",
        "Craig: Fine. If you want to go through the rest of your life mooning over Jack and what might have been, be my guest. But if you want a second shot at being a designer, start batting those lashes, Baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Liberty: Walter, hey.",
        "Janet: Hey. Sorry we're late, but we're ready to go.",
        "Walter: Well, I talked to Hearn. Tried to reach you at home. He's gonna suspend chemo for a little while.",
        "Janet: That's great. That means its working, right?",
        "Liberty: No more chemo, Walter -- is that a good thing?",
        "Walter: Well, your white count's a little low. It's taken another hit today. He's gonna start you on a new cocktail once you've had time to rest and recover.",
        "Liberty: Wow. So I just go home then and we just stop fighting this?",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Walter didn't say anything about not fighting, right? We're just, uh -- we're gonna take a breather, right?",
        "Walter: That's right.",
        "Janet: Okay. Thank you. Sweetie, I want to -- I want to get you home. A hospital is not exactly a good place for your immune system right now. Come on.",
        "Liberty: I just can't believe Dr. Hearn is giving up on me already.",
        "Janet: He's not giving up on you. We're gonna go home, we're gonna give him a call, and he is gonna tell us what the next step is, and then we're gonna take it.",
        "Liberty: Mom, stop. This is bad, and you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Every designer has their version of the little black dress.",
        "Morris: Uh, I don't claim to be an expert, but it's hot.",
        "Carly: Well, that's expert enough for me, Mr. Morris.",
        "Craig: Isn't she the best?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Well, you're biased, Darling. I'm just so, so happy you agreed to meet with us. I hated how things turned out the last time we all worked together.",
        "Craig: Sweetheart, he doesn't need a recap.",
        "Carly: Craig and I have learned from our mistakes and do not intend to repeat them, do we, Sweetheart?",
        "Craig: Absolutely not.",
        "Carly: And I do believe that the three of us could make Monte Carlo quite a profitable business this time.",
        "Morris: Uh, I'll need to get an okay from my partners.",
        "Craig: You can phone from the lobby if you want privacy.",
        "Morris: Good. See you in a bit.",
        "Craig: I am so proud of you. Mmm!",
        "Jack: Carly. What the hell are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Casey, stop -- running away from me.",
        "Casey: I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Alison: You don't have to talk to me. Just listen. God, is being around me that terrible to you?",
        "Casey: What do you think?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: You said that already.",
        "Alison: I just need you to know that I'm not lying. I do love you.",
        "Casey: And -- and what is that supposed to mean, huh? That you didn't sleep with Mick?",
        "Alison: I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Casey: Yes, but you did. And it doesn't make it all better. Where did it happen? I said where?",
        "Alison: The bell tower?",
        "Casey: The bell tower? You slept with him in the church where we were gonna get married? If you couldn't have cheapened it any more --",
        "Alison: You have every reason to hate me. And if I could go back and make a different choice, I would, but I can't.",
        "Casey: You mean you wouldn't have chose him? Don't do me any favors. You know, I was scared to death that everyone I loved was gonna be killed today. I'm hurt, humiliated. And what was supposed to be the happiest day of my life turned into a nightmare and a joke. And now I feel like the world's biggest chump.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Paul: Maybe you were James' pawn. It's not impossible for me to believe that something like that might be true. But I will never forgive you for what you have done. Emily and I had all but given up on having a baby, and you come to town, and you see that she is vulnerable, and you just dig in. You give my wife false hope. You don't care what happens as long as she doesn't figure out that it's a hoax. And when she does figure it out, you put her in a coma. My wife could have died, and you didn't care, just so long as your little plan didn't fall apart. Wow. I got to give it to dear old dad, you know? He never gave up. But he doesn't control me. Not anymore. So just know what I'm doing, I'm doing because it's what I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay. I'm gonna go wash up, and then I will make you your favorite, mac and cheese.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I'm not hungry, Mom. Thanks, though.",
        "Janet: Well, Sweetheart, you never know. Once you start smelling it cooking, you might get your appetite.",
        "Liberty: Maybe. Hi. Um, this is Janet Ciccone. I was just calling to see if any of the people that were registered as possible bone-marrow donors for my daughter were -- were any matches. Nobody. Yeah, there's always hope. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What are you doing here, Jack?",
        "Jack: I'm working, Carly. There was a hit-and-run outside. I'm looking for witnesses. Why are you kissing Craig? Or is that part of the job now?",
        "Carly: Get off your high horse. I thought you were gonna stop judging people. Isn't that what you said? I guess that resolution wore off right quick.",
        "Jack: [Sighs] You're right. I apologize. I am sorry. But I walked in and I saw the two of you together, I lost it a little bit. You can't go down that road again, Carly. Craig is dangerous.",
        "Carly: Are you talking about me or you?",
        "Jack: Both. I know I don't have a claim on you, and I have no right to be jealous. But guess what? I am.",
        "Carly: Come on. You -- you don't think --",
        "Jack: No, I don't think. When I came in here and I saw the two of you, I wasn't thinking. I just reacted.",
        "Carly: Well, at least you can see that. That's progress.",
        "Jack: So, what was that, Carly? Why did you kiss him?",
        "Carly: It's not real. Just trying to woo an investor -- that guy on the phone over there.",
        "Jack: I still don't understand where the kissing comes in.",
        "Carly: Well, we have to pretend we like each other. It's a long story, but it's not real.",
        "Jack: Yeah, maybe not for you. But Craig was into it, and you're just feeding into this fantasy he's got about the two of you.",
        "Carly: That's his problem. I need this, Jack. I need something in my life. I can't just sit around, being miserable because things didn't work out between the two of us. I need a project. I need something that I can hold in my hands when I'm done with it.",
        "Jack: I understand that, but why does it have to be with Craig, Carly? He lied to you. He dumped you for your sister.",
        "Carly: Thank you so much for reminding me.",
        "Jack: You've opened the door. He's never gonna quit. You know that.",
        "Carly: You know what? I've had enough of this! I -- I need to live my life without you in it, which means you don't get a say in what I do or who I do it with. How many times do I have to say it before you hear it? I want you to leave me alone.",
        "Jack: Fine. I'll leave you alone.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: But I know you. And the reason you're so upset is because you know I'm right. Craig is no good for you.",
        "Carly: Some people could say the same thing about you.",
        "Jack: Maybe. But unlike Montgomery, I don't have an agenda.",
        "Carly: Of course you do. You can't be with me, but you don't want me to be with anybody else.",
        "Jack: You win. Just be careful.",
        "Craig: I thought Jack was gonna drag you out by your hair.",
        "Carly: I don't want to hear it from you either.",
        "Craig: Oh, don't worry. I wouldn't presume to tell you what to do. You're a strong, independent woman.",
        "Carly: Can we just stick to business, please?",
        "Craig: Fine. All I was going to say is that Jack should be taking care of his wife, not following you around.",
        "Carly: He's not. He's working.",
        "Craig: Then what was that all about?",
        "Carly: Ask him if you want to know so badly. What's taking Morris so long?",
        "Craig: Oh, he, um -- he works with his three sons. He likes to pretend that he cares what they think, so before he makes a business deal, he calls all three and asks about the grandkids, the whole deal. It always works out, though, because the boys just do whatever Morris wants them to.",
        "Carly: And you think he wants to back us?",
        "Craig: If he didn't, he wouldn't bother calling. He'd just say no. Frankly, I think he just wanted to make sure that you and I are gonna play nice with each other from now on.",
        "Carly: You went a little overboard with that kiss.",
        "Craig: And yet it worked. We're back in business. Isn't that great?",
        "Carly: Yeah, great. And since you're so positive we've got a deal, you won't mind wrapping it up on your own.",
        "Craig: Car -- Carly, you can't leave! [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey. Dear old dad. How are you? I was, uh, just about to kill you. Any final words? Uh, are you telling me to turn it off? You want me to pull the plug? With pleasure.",
        "[Mick breathing heavily]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What are you doing?",
        "Alison: I'm moving out. I know I can't stay here anymore.",
        "Casey: You're not gonna get an argument from me.",
        "Alison: I didn't think I would.",
        "Casey: So, where are you gonna go?",
        "Alison: Back to my mother's. Yay.",
        "Casey: Uncomfortable much?",
        "Alison: She won't say anything. Not that she has to. Every time she looks at me, it reminds me of what a disappointment I am. But whatever. I can't really be mad at her. I brought it on myself.",
        "Casey: You're right. You did.",
        "Alison: I know that you're angry with me, Casey, but I'm -- I'm moving out. I'm leaving. I'm doing everything I can to make this easier on you.",
        "Casey: Oh, it's a little late for that, don't you think?",
        "Alison: Right. Well, if there was ever an indication that I'm not up to the task of being a Hughes, I sure found the best way to prove it. I don't belong here, Case. I'm not sure I ever did.",
        "Casey: Welcome to my world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I need to talk to you, now. You got a lot of nerve, making a scene like that in the middle of an important business meeting. You could have blown that whole deal for me, the way you were acting.",
        "Jack: I know. I said I was sorry. I walked in. I saw the two of you together. I -- I admitted I was jealous.",
        "Carly: Do you think you're the only one who's jealous, Jack? So am I.",
        "Jack: Of what?",
        "Carly: Janet, that she gets to be your wife, that she's the one that you go home to. And I'm sure that probably makes me a horrible person, considering everything she's going through, but then what's new, right? No one's ever made the mistake of calling me a saint.",
        "Jack: I guess it's hard on both of us then, isn't it?",
        "Carly: The difference is I don't go charging into your life, trying to interfere.",
        "Jack: Carly, I can't stop caring about you. And Craig -- I really don't care that he says this is just business. He said that when you two went into the vodka company together. So you know what that tells me? It tells me he wants you back.",
        "Carly: Do you have so little faith in me? Do you think I'm so weak that I would just let myself be taken in by him again?",
        "Jack: Come on, Carly. That's not what I said, and that's not the point.",
        "Carly: You're damn right it's not. The real point is that you go home to your wife every night, and I'm alone. Well, you know what? Maybe it feels good to be around a man who actually wants me. Maybe that's what I need.",
        "Jack: You think I don't want you?",
        "Liberty: Hey. Um, is Jack here?",
        "Cop: Yeah. He's in there.",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jack: What is it?",
        "Liberty: It's Liberty.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Hey. I, uh --",
        "Liberty: Hi.",
        "Jack: Aren't you supposed to be at a chemo appointment?",
        "Liberty: Oh, yeah. But they canceled it. Something about my white blood cells being completely nonexistent. Uh, but they'll figure something out, try something eventually.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Uh, okay. That's -- that's okay. There are -- there are a lot of alternatives they can try, right?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, like a bone-marrow transplant. It's not really for me.",
        "Jack: Why not?",
        "Liberty: I know you guys all got tested.",
        "Jack: Yes, as a precaution. That's -- that's all.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but there are no matches.",
        "Jack: I'm -- I'm not even sure they know that yet, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: No, yeah. Well, I -- I called the lab, and they told me. And those are my blood relatives, so --",
        "Jack: Okay. Hey, but listen, we'll find somebody. We've only scratched the surface of the Snyder clan, okay? And then we haven't even started with the Ciccones.",
        "Liberty: Good luck with that.",
        "Jack: There may not be even a possibility that you'll need one, okay? It's -- it's good to stay positive. You have to.",
        "Liberty: Jack, I am. I'm -- I'm fine. I just -- I haven't told my mom that there are no matches yet.",
        "Jack: Oh.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, and I think kind of looking for donors has kept her going, and I'm just really worried that she's gonna be upset when I tell her. So would you maybe mind coming home with me and helping me break the news?",
        "Jack: Yeah. No, not at all.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Jack: Did you -- did you -- did you walk all this way just to talk to me?",
        "Liberty: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? Um -- I'm just gonna need a minute, and I'll drive you back to the farm.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Jack: We'll talk to your mom together, all right?",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",

        "Craig: Morris, I don't understand. You -- you saw us here. You see how tight Carly and I are. There's obviously not gonna be a problem.",
        "Morris: Chaos follows this woman around with men and business. Uh-uh.",
        "Craig: You just did a background check, didn't you? All right, all right. I won't lie to you. Carly's had some issues. But so have I. A lot of issues. Carly had some difficulty recently, but she handled it. She's come through the other side, and she's ready to work. And her talent has never been an issue. And with my business experience, we cannot go wrong. All we need is the financing. Morris, we can work this out.",
        "Morris: I'm sorry. It's too risky. It was good seeing you. Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Uh, no. I didn't call before. No, it's -- this is -- I am Janet Ciccone-Snyder. I'm calling on behalf of my daughter, Liberty Ciccone. Right. Well, I'm just calling to see if you've gotten the results of the blood test yet. No one. Okay, thank you. Liberty, can you come down here, please? We need to talk. Lib? Oh, my God. Hey! What are you doing? Don't scare me like that, please.",
        "Liberty: Mom, its okay. I'm -- I'm here. Sorry.",
        "Janet: What are you doing home?",
        "Jack: Liberty wanted my help talking to you. It seems there's a problem with the donors.",
        "Janet: The lab told me that somebody called pretending to be me. Was that you?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. They haven't found a match.",
        "Janet: Oh, well, I mean, you know, that's okay. It's no big deal, right?",
        "Liberty: It's -- it's not?",
        "Janet: No. I mean, I still have a whole list of people to go through. And then if that doesn't work, we've got the national registry, so all is not lost, Honey.",
        "Jack: Yeah. And like I said before, this may not even be an issue.",
        "Janet: Right.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Are -- are you sure that you're okay, Mom?",
        "Janet: Yes. Honey, I am fine. But please do me a favor and talk to me before you go and do something that's gonna make you upset, all right? I'm your mom. Let me worry about the hard stuff, please?",
        "Liberty: All right. I love you. Come here.",
        "Janet: I love you, Sweetheart, more than you know. Now go upstairs and get some rest. I don't like you looking so pale.",

        "Paul: I'd love to be able to do it, you know? I really would. I would love to be able to pull the plug on my father one last time. It's something James would do. It's something you would do. I guess that's just not me. Besides, I think you want it too much, you know? Dying for you would be the easy way out. Good luck. Think you're gonna need it.",

        "Alison: What?",
        "Casey: Us, the wedding. Everything was going good.",
        "Alison: It was good.",
        "Casey: I thought so, too. I thought I was getting my life back on track. I just -- I just wanted everything to keep getting better, you know? That's why I surprised you with the ring on Christmas. I thought everything was perfect. I didn't want to lose you. Maybe I pushed you into marrying me when you weren't ready.",
        "Alison: You didn't push me. I said yes. I wanted to. But maybe you're right. Maybe it was too fast. Maybe I was trying to prove something to myself.",

        "Emily: What?",
        "Paul: Standing over Mick Dante. He's in bed. He's on a respirator. He's looking up at me. And he wants me to kill him. And it would have been so easy. I just would have had to flick a switch. And I didn't do it. And I didn't do it because I looked at my life, and I liked it. I want to hang on to it. Killing Mick would have put this, would have put us at risk. I don't ever want to do that.",
        "Emily: I'm so glad.",
        "Paul: Me too. I might actually turn into somebody that I like, eventually.",

But I saw the other you, the real you, and I -- I wish that I could have helped you more. I know that you thought of me as this savior, but I'm not that good. I tried, but I couldn't keep hurting Casey like that. I wish so much that I could have been the person that you needed.",

        "Janet: Teresa got tested at Memorial.",
        "Jack: Janet, look, I know this is hard, but I also know that you would do absolutely anything for your little girl. So if that means calling your parents, Janet --",
        "Janet: Hey, Jack, Jack -- they hate me, Jack. Liberty is the reason they are not talking to me.",
        "Jack: Okay. I'm not --",
        "Janet: How are they gonna want to save her life?",
        "Jack: I'm not saying its right. But a pregnant teenager is a far cry from a beautiful granddaughter that may need her family's help to save her life.",
        "Janet: Great. So they get to be the heroes.",

        "Janet: You're right. You're right. Liberty is all that matters. It's just -- it's been so many years, Jack.",
