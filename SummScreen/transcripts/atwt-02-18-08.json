        "Will and Gwen ask Allison to talk with Aaron about testifying for them, but Allison thinks that is going to be a tough sell since Aaron is very loyal to her. Sophie's lawyer is very confident they have the case wrapped up though. Lily tells Holden that she wonders if he is really sincere about starting over and if she should go back to living at home? Jack tells Carly and Parker that he is going to be tried as an adult. Carly promises herself that she won't let Parker go to jail. Carly interrupts Lily's conversation with Holden to ask if Lily will come see her. Luke learns from Noah that his father sent him a letter, so Luke reads it to Noah. The letter wishes that they could work things out, but is noticeably lacking in an apology. Noah wants nothing to do with him, but Luke wonders if he should deal with it so he can let go of his anger. Allison asks Aaron to testify for Will and Gwen, but he explains that Sophie already hates him and he doesn't want to stab her in the back anymore. Allison tells Will and Gwen that Aaron isn't going to testify. Bonnie, Will and Gwen sadly return to court empty handed. Carly asks Lily for her jet to take Parker out of the country. Lily is unsure at first, but Carly reminds her that she would do the same for her kids. Lily finally agrees. Noah is upset with Luke when he thinks he is siding with his dad. Aaron asks Holden for advice on what to do about testifying. Holden reminds him not to forget there is a baby involved whom he needs to do right by. Carly tells Parker they are leaving town. Parker is unsure at first, but Carly assures him that this is the only way to guarantee he does not end up in jail. Aaron shows up to testify at Will and Gwen's hearing, and speaks highly of Sophie as a person, but he also tells the judge that it was Sophie who chose to give up her baby. He also explains that Sophie chose not to put her baby first. He thinks that she will make a good mom \u0096 one day \u0096 just not now. Lily comes home to a candle light dinner that Holden set up, but is distracted by Carly's request. She finally admits to Holden what Carly wanted from her after Holden pressures her about no more secrets. Jack shows up just in time to stop Carly from leaving with Parker. Carly and Jack disagree over how to handle this, but Parker is the one who decides he wants to go home. Noah's letter goes missing from his knapsack at the farm. Holden is proud of Lily and tells her that he wants to do the tough but right decision too; he wants her to stay with him and the kids at the Farm from now on. Noah and Luke ask Holden and Lily if Natalie and Faith are around because something is missing of Noah's, but they haven't been around. Noah pretends he must have lost the item somewhere else, but looks nervous. Will and Gwen thank Aaron, and Allison reminds him that he did the right thing, but he thinks he destroyed Sophie's life in the process. Sophie tells Aaron that she never wants to see him again. Parker asks Jack to not be hard on Carly. Carly apologizes to Jack for acting without thinking. Jack tells Carly that he would have done the same thing she did. Jack and Carly renew their promise to stick together as a family to make it through this crisis, as they hug tightly."

        "Alison: How did it go? Did the judge rule?",
        "Will: Not yet.",
        "Gwen: How's Hallie?",
        "Alison: She's an angel. She's sleeping. I can't believe you guys are going through this.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I don't honestly think that I can give her up at this point.",
        "Alison: Does Bonnie think that's a possibility?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she's really worried.",
        "Will: We gotta find someone who can testify that Sofie willingly gave up her baby, and that we didn't force her.",
        "Alison: Well, I can do that. I mean, as soon as I told you guys it was Sofie's and Cole's baby, you guys wanted to back out of the adoption.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. The judge says that we need someone who knew Sofie's state of mind.",
        "Alison: I mean, is there anything I can do? Do you want me to stay with Hallie?",
        "Will: No, that's fine, we have someone coming.",
        "Alison: All right.",
        "Gwen: There is one thing --",
        "Alison: Name it.",
        "Gwen: Could you talk to Aaron? We need him to testify against Sofie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Graham: Hey, I wanted to check in on you, see how you're holding up. You ready for this afternoon?",
        "Sofie: I really hate this waiting thing. I just want my baby back.",
        "Graham: Well, maybe you should call housekeeping, get a crib in here.",
        "Sofie: What, you don't think the judge will believe that I can provide a decent home?",
        "Graham: Unless the Munsons come up with some unforeseen evidence or witness, you're going to have your baby back by tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Do you really think Aaron could help your case?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I mean, he was Sofie's only friend when she was pregnant. They worked together. She confided in him.",
        "Alison: That's very true.",
        "Will: Do you think he would testify that she definitely wanted to give up her baby?",
        "Alison: I mean, you know Aaron. He's so loyal. And for whatever reason, he has a really soft spot for Sofie, so --",
        "Gwen: It's our only chance. We need to show the judge that we didn't force Sofie into this adoption.",
        "Will: We'd go to him ourselves, but we don't want him to feel like we're guilting him into it. And after my mom's testimony backfired, we can't risk that happening again.",
        "Gwen: Please? Please, Aaron listens to you.",
        "Alison: I wouldn't be so sure of that. I'll try, okay? But don't get your hopes up. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What is this?",
        "Lily: Oh, you know what it is. It's your mother's winter stew. I followed the recipe to the \"T,\" but I'm sure it's nothing like your mother's.",
        "Holden: I'm sure it's terrific. Mama would be very proud. You seem like you're in a better mood.",
        "Lily: Yes. As a matter of fact, I feel like a new person.",
        "Holden: Really? I think we should celebrate. What? What is it?",
        "Lily: Well, you know that you said I could stay here while I recuperate.",
        "Holden: Yeah? So?",
        "Lily: So, I'm better now. I thought maybe it might be time for me to move back to the house.",
        "Holden: Are you sure you're ready for that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I could really use some caffeine after that lecture. Buy you some coffee?",
        "Luke: Two hours of medieval feudal states? You better make it a double tall venti grande --",
        "Noah: Let me just make sure I can pay for it.",
        "Luke: What? What's the big deal?",
        "Noah: It's nothing. It's just a letter.",
        "Luke: Well then why can't I see it? What, did that cute guy on the swim team give you a valentine?",
        "Noah: Get out.",
        "Luke: Let me see. It's from your father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Here you go.",
        "Parker: I already told you I'm not hungry.",
        "Carly: Come on, Parker. You can't shut down. You have to take care of yourself. You have to eat. You have to talk things over with me, with your dad, with Dr. Seidman.",
        "Parker: I don't see how talking can keep me out of jail.",
        "Carly: Well, keeping everything bottled up will certainly make things worse. If we all work together, we'll get through this. Isn't that right, Jack? On second thought, Parker, why don't you go upstairs for a moment?",
        "Jack: No, stay. We have to deal with this as a family. And you both need to hear what I have to say. I just talked to the D.A. They're trying Parker as an adult.",
        "Carly: They can't do that. He's just a boy! Jack, you have to do something!",
        "Jack: I wish to God I could. But the judge's decision is final.",
        "Carly: He only shot Sam because he was defending me!",
        "Jack: Well, we'll have a chance to explain that at trial.",
        "Parker: This means I could go to jail for a long time, right?",
        "Jack: It means that the stakes got higher, yeah, but we'll have to fight it out in court. Tom's an excellent lawyer.",
        "Carly: We are not letting you go to prison, Parker.",
        "Parker: You keep saying that, but you don't have any say in it, do you?",
        "Jack: Parker!",
        "Carly: I'm not letting them put my son in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I thought you were happy here.",
        "Lily: I am. I am. But I don't want to take advantage. I'm feeling better. I'm thinking more clearly. And I know that you only let me stay here because you were feeling sorry for me.",
        "Holden: No, no, that's not true. That's not true at all.",
        "Lily: You've taken very good care of me. You protected me during Dusty's murder investigation. You helped me get over what happened with Evan Walsh.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but that's all behind us now. I thought we were gonna make fresh start.",
        "Lily: You're a good man, and I don't want to take advantage anymore. You don't have to keep taking care of me.",
        "Holden: Lily, you're not taking advantage. And you proved that you're capable of taking care of yourself and the rest of us.",
        "Lily: You're wrong. You drew up divorce papers, Holden. You were furious with me. And we really haven't talked about what it means to be starting over. What does that mean?",
        "Holden: I thought it was obvious.",
        "Lily: So did I. But then I started thinking. I mean, are we just doing this for the sake of the children? And they're happy. They're doing really well, and that's great. What about you? I want you to be honest with me. Do you really want me to move back to the house?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Hello?",
        "Carly: I need to see you.",
        "Lily: I'm kind of in the middle of something, Carly.",
        "Carly: Please, Lily, it won't take long. Can you come over right away? It's an emergency.",
        "Lily: Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can. I'm sorry, that's Carly. She needs to see me right away.",
        "Holden: More bad news about Parker?",
        "Lily: I hope not.",
        "Holden: Okay, all right, you go. I'll take care of everything here.",
        "Lily: I won't be long. Just, please, think about what I said. Don't try to protect my feelings. I want you to be honest with me about where we go from here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You didn't open it.",
        "Noah: I couldn't.",
        "Luke: Well, how long have you been carrying it around?",
        "Noah: A while. I was going to throw it away, but I -- I couldn't.",
        "Luke: Well, that means you're curious.",
        "Noah: No. Why do I -- why would I care what he has to say?",
        "Luke: Because it's your father. Do you want me to open it?",
        "Noah: Go ahead.",
        "Luke: \"Son, if you're reading this, it means you haven't given up on your old man. I know I was unfair to you, and looking back, there are many things that I would do differently. But I want you to know that everything I did, I did out of love. I hope you can see that one day, and that with time, we can be as close as we once were. With love, your father.\" Wow.",
        "Noah: Yeah, imagine -- a whole letter telling me he loves me without once using the word \"Sorry.\"",
        "Luke: Well, it sounds to me like maybe he wanted to apologize, but didn't know how.",
        "Noah: He wants something.",
        "Luke: Well, don't you want to know what?",
        "Noah: No. I don't want anything to do with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Aaron: Hey, Ali. I thought you were babysitting. What -- does that mean that the hearing is over? What did the judge say?",
        "Alison: That's why I'm here. Gwen and Will asked me to talk to you about Sofie.",
        "Aaron: Well, if they think I'm going to get her to drop the case, they're wrong, because she's not talking to me. She thinks I betrayed her when I blew the whistle on her in New York.",
        "Alison: Why blame you? She came back on her own.",
        "Aaron: Yes, I know that, with the ticket I bought her. But in her eyes, I'm on Will and Gwen's side.",
        "Alison: Well, they're beyond trying to change her mind at this point. In fact, they have to go back to finish the hearing this afternoon. There's still one more witness they need to hear from.",
        "Aaron: Who's that?",
        "Alison: You.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I hope she can sleep. She seems really fussy.",
        "Will: You know, I read in one of those books that babies can tell when you're stressed.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, holding her is the only thing that really makes me feel any better.",
        "Will: I know it's hard, but right now, for both of your sakes, you got to try to relax.",
        "Gwen: I can't lose her, Will. I can't.",
        "Will: Don't worry, okay? Aaron's going to come through for us. I know he is.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "[Gwen sobs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Gwen and Will need you to testify against Sofie at the hearing.",
        "Aaron: No way.",
        "Alison: You're the only person who knows what was going through her head when she gave the baby up.",
        "Aaron: I can't do that to Sofie.",
        "Alison: Look, you were there when she left the hospital because she couldn't even be near the baby. She wanted nothing to do with Hallie.",
        "Aaron: I know, okay? But if I take Will and Gwen's side, Sofie's not going to forgive me.",
        "Alison: I don't get it! What is your loyalty to that girl? She ripped Hallie from her crib!",
        "Aaron: Sofie is Hallie's biological mother.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and you're her godfather. And you owe it to that little girl to make sure she has a good home and parents who can actually take care of her.",
        "Aaron: Hey, listen, I did what I had to do to make sure nothing bad happened to Hallie. I was Sofie's friend, and I'd still like to be. I'm not going to stab her in the back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I can tell from the look on your face, he said no.",
        "Alison: I did my best, I swear.",
        "Will: So, maybe I should go talk to him.",
        "Alison: I don't think it'll help. He's really loyal to Sofie, even though she's not even speaking to him right now.",
        "Gwen: What are we going to do? We need Aaron's testimony.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Bonnie: Hey. I thought I'd pick you guys up, so we could go over everything one more time before the hearing.",
        "Gwen: Listen, we need more time.",
        "Bonnie: No, Gwen, what we need is to convince that judge that Sofie knew exactly what she was doing when she signed those adoption papers. How's that witness coming?",
        "Will: Aaron said no. And we're out of ideas.",
        "Bonnie: Well, you know what? If Aaron is Sofie's friend, maybe it's for the best. But I think we should get going.",
        "Gwen: Our sitter is not even here yet.",
        "Alison: I'll wait for the sitter and I'll just meet you guys there.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Will: Thanks, Ali.",
        "Bonnie: All right, let's go. If we're late, the judge is not going to be happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: What is going on?",
        "Carly: Jack and Parker are inside. I can't let them know what I'm doing.",
        "Lily: Which is?",
        "Carly: I need a favor, Lily. A big one. I need to borrow your mother's jet.",
        "Lily: Why do I get the feeling I don't want to know why?",
        "Carly: You don't, believe me.",
        "Lily: Okay, if you going to use the jet, you need a flight plan, a passenger list.",
        "Carly: You have to promise me that you will not breathe a word.",
        "Lily: What are you up to, Carly?",
        "Carly: I have to get Parker out of here. Tonight. And no one can know where we're going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I was thinking -- maybe you should give your father another chance.",
        "Noah: I can't believe this. You, of all people, should know what he's capable of.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe he's trying to make it up to you and doesn't know how.",
        "Noah: What could he possibly do to make up for killing my mother and trying to kill you?",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, it's not about forgiving him. It's about letting all this stuff go. Trust me. No good can come with carrying around a bunch of hate.",
        "Noah: Luke, don't you see? He's never gonna be sorry about what he did.",
        "Luke: But look at what it's doing to you. I just think that maybe it would do you some good if you resolve issues with him.",
        "Noah: That's impossible! He's a murderer and a bigot, and I don't want anything to do with him, ever again! You know what really gets me about this? That you would side with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Dad? Oh, I'm sorry. Looks like you have plans.",
        "Holden: That's okay. You're always welcome here, you know that. You hungry?",
        "Aaron: No, no, I don't have much of an appetite.",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Aaron: Will and Gwen want me to testify in their custody hearing.",
        "Holden: And you don't want to do it?",
        "Aaron: No, I do. I do, but I don't. I mean, I'm on their side in a lot of ways. I mean, they're great parents, and it would kill them if they lost Hallie.",
        "Holden: So what's the problem?",
        "Aaron: They want me to talk about things only I know about because Sofie told me -- in confidence.",
        "Holden: Oh, I see.",
        "Aaron: The first time that Sofie agreed to the adoption, you know, she was so into her boyfriend, Cole, at the time, she was willing to do anything just to keep him.",
        "Holden: Including giving up her baby?",
        "Aaron: Yes. I tried talking her out of it, but it's like she was under some kind of spell, you know, with this jerk, doing whatever he wanted her to do.",
        "Holden: Hmm. Not the best quality for a mother to have.",
        "Aaron: No. But she trusted me. After Cole walked out on her, and she decided to give Gwen and Will the baby anyway, she told me things. She told me things that she didn't tell anybody else. Now, how can I turn around and use that against her? You know, if, for some reason, she loses the baby because of me, she's never gonna forgive me.",
        "Holden: That's a tough place to be. I respect you, though. You don't want to hurt Gwen and Will or Sofie.",
        "Aaron: Well, it's a no-win situation.",
        "Holden: Yeah. You know what? Bottom line, there's one person that you have to make sure that you don't hurt here -- Hallie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Be seated, please. Are we ready to continue?",
        "Graham: We are, your honor.",
        "Bonnie: Yes, your honor.",
        "Judge: I have been through the testimony so far. And I have to say, this is not an easy case. I have sympathy for both sides. But the strong-arm tactics of the adoptive parents' mothers do seem to suggest an element of coercion.",
        "Will: You can't judge us by our mothers.",
        "Bonnie: Don't interrupt. I'm sorry, your honor.",
        "Judge: You requested a delay in order to produce another witness. Are you ready to proceed?",
        "Bonnie: Yes, your honor, I --",
        "Aaron: Excuse me, your honor. I'm sorry, I hope I'm not too late. I'm here to testify.",
        "Judge: And you are?",
        "Aaron: I'm Aaron Snyder. I'm a friend of Will and Gwen's and -- and Sofie's. Maybe I can shed some light on why Sofie wanted to give up her kid.",
        "Graham: Objection!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm sorry, I can't help you. I cannot help you run away. Is this what you want for Parker? To be a fugitive for the rest of his life?",
        "Carly: No. Of course not. I want him to grow up happy and healthy in his own home. But they are not gonna let that happen. The judge wants to try him as an adult. He could go to jail for 20 years because of me. I'm the reason he pulled that trigger.",
        "Lily: I understand. Believe me, I do. But don't you think by running, you're only making matters worse?",
        "Carly: He was protecting me, Lily. I have to protect him. I look at Parker, I don't see an adult. I see my little boy. And I cannot bear the thought of him in jail. Please. Think about everything you did to help Luke. Can I do any less?",
        "Lily: Hello, this is Lily Snyder. I need the jet to be prepared for a flight this evening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: What's all this?",
        "Holden: Well, you made the stew, so I thought I could do my part. What? You're not in the mood?",
        "Lily: Oh no, no, it's not that. I know I said I wanted to talk, but I'm a little distracted.",
        "Holden: What did Carly say?",
        "Lily: Exactly what you thought she would say. The D.A. wants to try Parker as an adult.",
        "Holden: Hmm. I guess I better call Jack.",
        "Lily: No. No, don't. Because not that many people know about it just yet.",
        "Holden: Why did she tell you?",
        "Lily: I'd rather not say.",
        "Holden: Lily --",
        "Lily: She made me swear not to say anything.",
        "Holden: Lily, come on. We promised that we weren't going to keep things from each other. This obviously involves you. And with Carly, odds are it's probably something that's going to get you into trouble.",
        "Lily: I can't -- I can't do it to her. I'm sorry --",
        "Holden: Lily, come on, don't do this to us. Whatever it is, don't let another secret come between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, where'd you go? I wanted you to talk to Parker with me.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I just needed some air. I can't believe Margo let this happen.",
        "Jack: Oh, it's not her fault. We just got to fight harder, that's all. We promised Parker we wouldn't let anything bad happen to him. We can't break that promise.",
        "Carly: We already have.",
        "Jack: We can still win this, Carly. But we've got to stay strong. Parker has to see us confident.",
        "Carly: Unfortunately, I don't have as much faith in the justice system as you do.",
        "Jack: I promise you, we will get through this.",
        "Carly: Believe me, Jack, I do want what's best for Parker. And I will do whatever it takes to make sure he's okay.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm glad to hear that. Now, I've got to get back to the station. I've got some work I've got to do. I'll be back to check on him.",
        "Carly: Okay. Parker! Get your clothes.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Carly: We're leaving.",
        "Parker: Where are we going?",
        "Carly: Remember the night of the shooting, you asked me to take you away and I said no? I changed my mind.",
        "Parker: So have I.",
        "Carly: I told you I wouldn't let them put you in prison. This is the only way I can be sure that won't happen.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, Dad's not going to like it. He just gave me a whole speech about facing what I did and fighting for justice.",
        "Carly: Jack's a cop. Of course he believes in justice. So do I, in theory. But I wouldn't bet the farm on it. I'm sure not going to bet you on it!",
        "Parker: Where would we go?",
        "Carly: You decide. We'll go wherever you want.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but even if we run away, or if I change my name, it's still me, right? So, what's the point?",
        "Carly: The point is to get away before they put you away. And then you can figure out what's next. You can take all the time you need.",
        "Parker: I'll go pack my clothes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Okay, okay -- you're right, you're right. No more secrets. No more secrets. Carly asked me to get my mother's jet to take Parker out of the country.",
        "Holden: I hope you said no.",
        "Lily: I did.",
        "Holden: Good.",
        "Lily: And then I changed my mind.",
        "Holden: Lily, you could be charged with aiding and abetting.",
        "Lily: I know, Holden, but if one of our children -- wouldn't you do anything to help them?",
        "Holden: Carly should not be making this decision alone.",
        "Lily: Jack wouldn't approve it, you know that.",
        "Holden: Yeah, for good reason.",
        "Lily: Just be honest, what would you do? What would you do if it were Luke or Ethan?",
        "Holden: There is only one choice, and you know what that would be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: I'd like to hear what this young man has to say. Mr. Snyder, have a seat. Now, what can you tell me about Ms. Duran's state of mind at the time of the adoption?",
        "Aaron: I just want to say that, um, I feel real bad for Sofie. I think she's a great person, I really do. I think she's going to make a great mother one day. But just not right now.",
        "Graham: Objection. This man's opinion has no bearing on --",
        "Judge: Just please confine your answers to Ms. Duran's state of mind when she gave the child up for adoption.",
        "Aaron: Before Gwen and Will even knew who the birth mother was, Sofie wasn't sure about even having the baby. Cole, her boyfriend at the time, wanted her to have an abortion, and Sofie agreed. But she just couldn't go through with it.",
        "Graham: Which shows she wanted to keep the baby --",
        "Judge: Counselor, I'm warning you --",
        "Aaron: She was hoping that he would change his mind, but he didn't. He told her that she had to decide between him and the baby. Cole was the one who suggested that Sofie give her up for adoption.",
        "Judge: Did it seem to you that she was being coerced?",
        "Aaron: Yes, at the time. And then Alison and I figured out what Cole was up to, that he was trying to sell the baby. We then told Gwen and Will. They were absolutely against adopting the baby under those circumstances. As a matter of fact, they even offered to help Sofie keep the baby. Then Cole broke up with Sofie and she freaked out. She told me she didn't want the baby. It was completely her decision to give her up for adoption. I don't think she was emotionally ready to have a kid.",
        "Graham: Yes, that may have been true then, but she's ready now.",
        "Judge: Are you sure that this is how Ms. Duran felt at the time?",
        "Aaron: Well, we worked together, we were friends. But I'm Hallie's godfather, so obviously, I'm very close to Gwen and Will. And I just want what's best for Hallie.",
        "Judge: And what, in your opinion, is best for Hallie?",
        "Aaron: That would be for you to decide. All I know is -- is that Gwen and Will were able and ready to be great parents from the beginning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Noah, wait. I didn't mean to upset you.",
        "Noah: Luke, you are the one person I thought I could count on to understand. How can you say I should forgive my father?",
        "Luke: Well, I don't say it because I think he deserves it. I'm saying it because I think you deserve it. You deserve to let go of all this anger. Look, Noah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.",
        "Noah: Yeah, me too. My dad is still making my crazy.",
        "Luke: Well, that's -- that's what I'm saying. Look, no matter what I say, whether you decide to make up with your dad or not, you need to know one thing. No matter what, I'm going to be on your side. You got that?",
        "Noah: I got it.",
        "Luke: Good, now how about you help me with the barn chores? Put some of that anger to good use.",
        "Noah: Let me just put my bag down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie is a good person. But the fact is, it wasn't her instinct to put the baby first. So, I think Gwen and Will deserve to be Hallie's parents.",
        "Judge: Thank you, Mr. Snyder. There is a lot to absorb here. I'm going to have to go over all the testimony in detail. And I'll let you know when I've reached my decision. This hearing is adjourned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: We didn't get to say good-bye to J.J. or Sage.",
        "Carly: I'll call them when we're out of the country, okay?",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, they're going to hate you and hate me.",
        "Carly: Sit down. Sweetie, right now, this is the way I can protect you. And once we get settled, I will figure out a way to reunite us all. I will never abandon this family again. Do you hear me?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Okay, now we have to tell the pilot where we're going to go, so it's up to you. Anywhere you want. What do you think of that?",
        "Jack: I think it's the worst idea you've ever had.",
        "Carly: How did you find us?",
        "Jack: That's not important. I'm just glad I got here in time to stop you. Parker, come on, let's get out of here.",
        "Carly: You stay right there. If he doesn't leave with me now, he could end up in prison. Is that what you want?",
        "Jack: No, Carly, of course not. But skipping town, that's -- that's not the answer. At least with a trial, he has a chance at a good outcome.",
        "Carly: There's also a chance for a bad one. And I'm not going to risk that.",
        "Jack: Even if you get away with running, it's not going to solve anything, Carly. He -- he'll be burdened for the rest of his life, guaranteed. Not to mention the fact that he'll be ripped away from everything and everyone he cares about.",
        "Carly: He'll have me. He'll be free. He'll be safe.",
        "Jack: What, you call this free? Living in hiding. He'll be ripped away from his family and friends forever. Did you even think about that? No. No. Because you don't think anything through. You just do the first thing that pops into your head, no matter how crazy.",
        "Carly: And what if he goes to jail? The son of a cop. What will happen to him then? Did you think about that? How will you protect him then?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: What kind of friend am I? Agreeing to help Carly and then ratting her out.",
        "Holden: You're a good friend, who's looking out for her and for her family.",
        "Lily: Somehow, I don't think she's going to see it that way. Isn't that one of the things we teach our children not to do? Not be a snitch?",
        "Holden: We had to tell Jack.",
        "Lily: I'm beginning to think this honesty thing is a little overrated.",
        "Holden: You know, Aaron came by earlier. He's facing a tough decision about whether or not to testify at Gwen and Will's custody hearing.",
        "Lily: So what did you tell him?",
        "Holden: I told him not to take the easy way out.",
        "Lily: Sometimes, you have to do things that are difficult.",
        "Holden: And that's what you just did. I'm very proud of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: You know, I don't know how you do it, but even when I've completely made up my mind about something, you always get me to reconsider.",
        "Luke: Read the letter again. See if it's sincere.",
        "Noah: That's weird. I could have sworn I left this closed -- you didn't -- you didn't go into it for anything, did you?",
        "Luke: Uh, I was the guy mucking out the stall next to you. When would I have done that? I mean, maybe you just forgot that you left your bag open.",
        "Noah: It's gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I know that was hard. You did a really good thing.",
        "Will: Hey, thank you. We really appreciate you stepping up for us like that.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, thank you. Because of you, we have a better chance of keeping Hallie.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I wish I felt better about it.",
        "Alison: You should. You may have saved Hallie from a really hard life.",
        "Aaron: Well, I hope so. Because I may have just destroyed Sofie's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie! Sofie! I'm -- hey, I'm sorry. Look, I had to tell the truth the way I saw it. Look, I know you feel like I betrayed you --",
        "Sofie: You're damn right I do.",
        "Aaron: All I've ever wanted was what's best for you and the baby.",
        "Sofie: Who asked you, Aaron? You know, I never wanted your help, you just kept showing up to save the day. And now you probably ruined any chance I had of fixing the mistakes I've made.",
        "Aaron: Sofie, I'm your friend, okay? I've always been your friend. I still want to be.",
        "Sofie: You're kidding, right? Because I never want to see you again for as long as I live.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Just turn around, Jack, and let us go. I'll call you as soon as we land.",
        "Jack: Believe me, if I thought that this were the answer, I'd have my bags with me right now.",
        "Carly: This is the only way we can protect him --",
        "Jack: No, it's not, Carly! You know what it's like to be a fugitive. Do you want that for Parker?",
        "Carly: I don't know what else to do!",
        "Jack: Well, as hard as it is, he's got to stay and face this!",
        "Parker: Stop it! Okay, it's my life, not yours. And if I'm old enough to be tried as an adult, I'm old enough to choose what I want. And I want to go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: That was the pilot. Jack got there in time. The plane is not going anywhere.",
        "Holden: Good.",
        "Lily: You know, if you hadn't pushed me, I wouldn't have told you about Carly's plan. Maybe you're rethinking about our little dinner together.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I am.",
        "Lily: I said that I wanted to talk to you and I wanted you to tell me whether or not you wanted me to go back to the house or not. But I don't think I can handle any more truth today.",
        "Holden: You know what? You know what? I've been telling everybody not to take the easy way out. So I think maybe I should take my own advice.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Holden: You did the right thing with Jack and Carly. You've been working hard, and it's made me realize that maybe I need to work a little bit harder myself.",
        "Lily: It still doesn't make it clear what it means for us to start over.",
        "Holden: A lot's happened. I want to try again. I want to work at it. It's not going to be easy. So, why don't you stay out here at the farm? Stay with me and the kids.",
        "Lily: Nothing would make me happier.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: It's not here anywhere.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe it fell out.",
        "Noah: No, it was buried inside. Somebody took it.",
        "Luke: No, that's crazy. Who would want it, and who would even know what it is? Maybe one of my sisters is playing a practical joke or something. Oh, sorry.",
        "Holden: It's okay. What's up?",
        "Luke: Faith and Natalie weren't playing outside, were they?",
        "Lily: No, the girls aren't here.",
        "Luke: Was anybody out on the porch?",
        "Lily: No. Is everything okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah, something's just missing from Noah's backpack --",
        "Noah: You know what? It's really no big deal. I'm sure I dropped it on the walk over here. It's probably nothing to worry about.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I feel like waking her up so I can play with her.",
        "Will: The sitter said she was happy the whole time.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Gwen: Do you think the judge made a decision already?",
        "Will: There's only one way to find out. Hello? No, Mom. We don't know anything yet. We haven't found out. So, I can't talk right now, but I'll let you know as soon as we know something. Bye.",
        "Gwen: Please, please, please. Please let us keep her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: How could I ever have given you up? [Cell phone rings] Please, God, give me another chance to be her mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie, I know you hate me right now, and you're probably not going to call me back. But I just wanted to let you know that I'm thinking about you and I hope you're okay. Good-bye.",
        "Alison: You look like you could use some company.",
        "Aaron: I hope you're happy, because I just made an enemy for life.",
        "Alison: Hey, I didn't make you do anything.",
        "Aaron: I know. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to take that out on you.",
        "Alison: How about a mocha, on me?",
        "Aaron: Maybe another time.",
        "Alison: Aaron, you did the right thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'll make tea.",
        "Jack: What you did was tough, kid. You did the right thing, though. I'm proud of you.",
        "Parker: Yeah. I'm not a kid, remember? Don't be so hard on Mom. She was just trying to help. I'm going to go unpack.",
        "Carly: Damn it!",
        "Jack: Hey, are you okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Jack, I'm so sorry. I didn't think. I just get upset and I react.",
        "Jack: I understand why you did it. And if I weren't a cop, I probably would've done the same thing.",
        "Carly: No, you wouldn't have. You always do the right thing. It has nothing to do with your job.",
        "Jack: I've been trying to put a positive spin on things. It's just -- there's no good way to look at the situation. We have to focus on sticking together, Carly. That kid needs both of us right now.",
        "Carly: I think I may need him a little more right now than he needs me.",
        "Jack: No, I don't think that's true. He acts a lot tougher than he really is. And there's no way he wouldn't been so intent on protecting you from Sam if he didn't love and care about you and need you so much. Hey, I promise you we will do everything possible. And it will take the strength -- all the strength that we both have, but we are going to get through this. We have to.",

        "Katie: You want me to admit it? Fine. Yeah, it bothers me to see Brad with Bonnie.",
        "Margo: If that's what you want, why don't you go after him?",
        "Vienna: I'll do -- anything.",
        "Chris: Yes, yes, yes --",
        "Emily: You don't think Meg actually would have stayed with you, do you?",
