Katie makes an appointment with a fertility specialist when Margo is with her, as Margo is confused and Katie isn't ready to explain the whole thing. Margo is bothered by the fact that Katie is leaving Brad in the dark though. Henry is worried that Vienna is pregnant, as he admits to Brad about how he found Vienna punching holes in his condom. This strikes a nerve with Brad, who starts to think that Katie is trying to get pregnant even though Bob told them to wait. Brad looks for Katie's diaphragm and can't find it, as he later accompanies Henry to the hospital so Henry can get information on vasectomies. Brad finds Katie at the hospital and she covers her lie, which bothers Margo more. Later, when Katie sees her stuff is moved, Brad confronts her about his suspicions and admits her searched for her missing diaphragm. Katie almost comes clean but then claims that she threw it away because she was getting a new one. Brad feels badly for doubting her, as Katie is wracked with guilt over perpetuating her lie. Josie tries to get through to Paul because she believes the best in him, as Paul tries to dissuade her by planting a kiss on her, as Josie pushes him off. Meg turns down Dusty's offer for help wanting to do it on her own. Dusty intercepts an envelope from Paul wanting Meg to have all his asset and Fairwinds. He goes to see Paul and interrupts him and Josie without sharing this with Meg. Paul is furious because he thinks Meg sent him over, as they have it out. Josie can't stand by and watch Paul self-destruct over Meg, as she bids him goodbye. Paul confronts Meg, but she tells him that she knew nothing about the papers. Meg explains that she doesn't want his or Dusty's help. Paul becomes insecure over Dusty but when their arguing awakes Eliza, they work as a team to quiet her, and Meg seems moved by Paul's paternal way. Josie tries to talk with Dusty to explain herself but in the end, she realizes that she has to say goodbye to him. She hopes that he takes a good hard look at what his life has become and works to get himself back on track. Even though Meg is moved by Paul with Eliza, she explains that he won't be seeing her at the farm anymore \u0096 only a neutral location as the judge suggested. Paul pleads with her to reconsider putting their daughter through that, but Meg stands her ground. Paul stops trying to pressure and leaves without a word, as an emotional Meg starts to tear up after he leaves."

        "Brad: Hey, what is taking you so long? Get in here! We've got five or six hours until Liberty gets home, and we are going to -- we are going to use every minute of it. Hey, what's wrong? Did you forget your thingie?",
        "Katie: I got my period.",
        "Brad: Okay. Well, I don't understand. Are you --?",
        "Katie: Am I what?",
        "Brad: You seem like you're really upset. Do you want me to rub your back or something? Come here. Come on.",
        "Katie: I hate this. I feel like I'm never going to have a baby.",
        "Brad: We're not trying to have a baby anymore. At least not right now.",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Brad: So you not being pregnant, that is a good thing. Because if you were, Dr. Bob said that it would be -- that it'd be dangerous.",
        "Katie: I know what Dr. Bob said. I remember very well.",
        "Brad: Then why are you so disappointed about not being pregnant? It's not like you were expecting you would be. Right? Katie, right?",
        "Katie: Sorry, I'm just being silly.",
        "Brad: No, that's not it. There's something else. Something you're not telling me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Is Vienna in the back?",
        "Waitress: She just left.",
        "Henry: Did she go to the bank for some change or something?",
        "Waitress: She said she'd be gone all afternoon.",
        "Henry: I just called her. I told her I was on my way. Which is why she is not here. Voicemail? My confectionery, darling dumpling? Is this some ploy to record my sweet nothings for future playback? I'd much prefer to talk dirty to you in person than a machine. So just give me a call as soon as you get this. I would love to chat. And find out if you are pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Can we just drop it?",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah, as soon as you tell me why you're so surprised that you got your friend or you know, whatever.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I got my period. And I'm not surprised, I'm just -- like you said, a little disappointed.",
        "Brad: But if we're not trying to get pregnant, this is totally normal, so I don't understand why it's suddenly such a big deal.",
        "Katie: I didn't say it was rational. But because I have my period, things are not happening that I would like to be happening, and I just wish we didn't have to wait for so long.",
        "Brad: You don't know how long it's going to be. Look, as much as I want a family, I want you to be healthy more.",
        "Katie: But I am healthy. I feel healthier now than I did before the transplant.",
        "Brad: Great. And as soon as the doctors confirm that in a couple months, we're gonna start again. Look, in a couple years, you're gonna be -- you're gonna be waddling around with your belly out to Tuscaloosa, and you'll be thinking the time just swished by.",
        "Katie: A couple of years?",
        "Brad: Sooner, sooner. The important thing is that you're healthy, and that the baby is gonna be healthy. It's gonna be here sooner than you think.",
        "Katie: Soon.",
        "Brad: Soon.",
        "Katie: I like the sound of that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're a single mother. Your baby needs you. I'm assuming you want to spend as much time with her as you can.",
        "Meg: Well, I won't be doing this too much longer. I need to earn a living.",
        "Dusty: No, you don't. Let me worry about that.",
        "Meg: That's not your job.",
        "Dusty: No, but I have a lot of money, enough to spread around. The least you can do is let me help you out.",
        "Meg: I don't want your help.",
        "Dusty: Why? What are you afraid of? That Paul is gonna see me hanging around you and Eliza, it's gonna set him off again?",
        "Meg: No, no, it's not that. I like seeing you, Dusty. You're my friend. I'm not turning down your company. I'm turning down your financial assistance.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Meg: Because I want to carry my own weight. Besides, you don't owe me anything.",
        "Dusty: I'm not doing it 'cause I owe you. I'm doing it because I want to. And it's tough raising a kid on your own.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I kind of figured that out.",
        "Dusty: What if your car breaks down or something? Or you break your leg, how are you gonna get to work?",
        "Meg: How about I let you sign my cast, would that make you happy?",
        "Dusty: Things happen, that you know, you don't plan on, and suddenly, you need more than a part-time job and good intentions.",
        "Meg: Okay, well, I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.",
        "Dusty: What if there's a flood, and the bridge is closed, huh? Who are you going to call?",
        "Meg: Not you.",
        "Dusty: And not Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I asked you to leave everything alone! Why couldn't you just do that?!",
        "Josie: You're not going to jail, Paul. Most people would be happy about that.",
        "Paul: You didn't do me any favors, you know, the judge giving me just a slap on the wrist, it's not -- it's a nightmare.",
        "Josie: How can you say that? You get to see your daughter every couple of weeks.",
        "Paul: I get to ruin her life and Meg's. Thanks a lot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I won't take anything Paul is offering.",
        "Dusty: You didn't testify against him today. So he thinks you still love him.",
        "Meg: I do still love him, but I won't go back to him, and I won't take money from him, or you.",
        "Dusty: Why make it so hard on yourself?",
        "Meg: Dusty, it's no accident that I fell for you and Paul, at different times in my life. In a lot of ways, you two are exactly alike. Protective and complicated and stubborn. Do you know who else is like that?",
        "Dusty: You, Meg.",
        "Meg: Yes, that's right. So don't pretend for a second that if our positions were reversed, and I offered you the house and the money, that you would take it.",
        "Dusty: What are you gonna do?",
        "Meg: Go back to work. Live here until I find somewhere else I can afford.",
        "Dusty: What's that going to prove?",
        "Meg: That my daughter can respect me.",
        "[Eliza crying]",
        "Meg: Look, if you want to help, you can warm this up for me. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: You got it.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Messenger: I got a delivery for Meg Snyder?",
        "Dusty: Okay. You want me to sign for it?",
        "Messenger: Yeah, right on the X. Okay.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Messenger: Ohh! It's open.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry about it.",
        "Messenger: I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: Unbelievable!",
        "Meg: Ahh, perfect timing.",
        "Dusty: You need anything else?",
        "Meg: No, thank you. I'd better get this back up to Eliza.",
        "Dusty: Give her a kiss for me.",
        "Meg: I will. You could see yourself out.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, listen, you were right. If things were reversed, I wouldn't take your money. But I wouldn't shut you out, either. Even if you did have a savior complex, you know what I mean?",
        "Meg: So you're saying you're available for bottle warming, et cetera?",
        "Dusty: Whatever. I'll see you around.",
        "[Eliza crying]",
        "Meg: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Hey, would you like to go get some lunch?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm not really that hungry.",
        "Brad: Not even for dessert? Apple pie a la mode from Al's?",
        "Katie: Mm, maybe later.",
        "Brad: I'll tell you what. I'll go get it and bring it back.",
        "Katie: You would do that for me?",
        "Brad: Don't you know already I'd do anything for you, crazy.",
        "Katie: Great. Yeah, I do, I do a lot of crazy things. But I love you so much.",
        "Brad: That's the craziest thing of all. You loving me. Don't you ever stop. I'll be right back.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Margo: Ohh, hey, hi, taking off?",
        "Brad: Yeah, hi, Margo. Can you do me a favor? Katie's kind of depressed.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, what's wrong?",
        "Brad: This whole pregnancy thing, can you stay with her until I get back?",
        "Margo: Yeah, sure, I got a couple hours, no problem.",
        "Brad: All right, thanks.",
        "Margo: Katie?",
        "Katie: Is Brad gone?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Honey, he said that you were depressed about something. Katie?",
        "Katie: Hi, this is Katie Snyder. I was in last week, I spoke with -- Melanie, yes, hi. I was just wondering if I could get an appointment today. Yeah, sure, I'll hold.",
        "Margo: What? An appointment for what?",
        "Katie: Oh, this doctor, he's -- yeah? Oh, no, no, no, really? It's kind of an emergency. Is there any way you could squeeze me in today? Ten minutes? Yeah, I'll be right there.",
        "Margo: What? Katie, where?",
        "Katie: I am -- I'm going to see a fertility specialist at the hospital.",
        "Margo: Really? I mean, it hasn't been that long since you and Brad got serious about trying to have a baby. Don't you think you should give it some time?",
        "Katie: No, I've waited long enough as it is. Oh, I should write him a note.",
        "Margo: A note? Katie, what are you -- talk to me.",
        "Katie: I don't have time right now.",
        "Margo: Well, all right, then I'll go with you.",
        "Katie: I wouldn't be able to drop you back at home.",
        "Margo: Well, fine, I'll drive my own car.",
        "Katie: Don't you have to go to work?",
        "Margo: Aren't you in a hurry? Let's go, let's go, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waitress: May I help you?",
        "Brad: Yes, you can! Can I get an apple pie a la mode with chocolate chip ice cream to go? And can I get that ice cream on the side, and make sure that you give me a scoop --",
        "Henry: Giselle, just give him a scoop with extra chocolate chips. His wife is very particular. And some chocolate syrup with it, as well.",
        "Brad: You know, sometimes I think you know Katie better than I do.",
        "Henry: Well, I'm beginning to know pregnancy tests better than I do. You've had experience with this. Which one of these is best?",
        "Brad: It's not my department. All I know is you pee on it, and it tells you if you're pregnant or not.",
        "Henry: You make it sound so simple. Like people do this every day.",
        "Brad: They do.",
        "Henry: Well, Vienna doesn't. Or she won't. Not if I'm around to observe the results.",
        "Brad: I don't understand, you guys keep changing your mind. I mean, I thought you said you didn't want to have kids, and now Vienna's taking pregnancy tests. I mean, which is it?",
        "Henry: No kids. No kids, that was the understanding. And I thought Vienna was on board with that, until I caught her punching little pinholes in my condoms.",
        "[Brad laughing]",
        "Henry: What, do you think that's funny?",
        "Brad: Yes. But how did you figure it out?",
        "Henry: I caught her in the act, Brad. Look, you gotta keep your eyes on these women, all right? They're sneaky. What?",
        "Brad: Katie didn't take her thingie into the bathroom.",
        "Henry: Okay?",
        "Brad: She always takes her thingie into the bathroom just before we -- I gotta go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Josie: Paul, listen to me.",
        "Paul: You need to leave.",
        "Josie: You have another chance here. You can go to therapy. You can get the help that you need. And instead of wasting years in some prison cell, you can spend that time getting to know your daughter. You have so much to offer her.",
        "Paul: No, I don't get to offer her anything because Meg's never going to let me anywhere near her.",
        "Josie: Well, maybe not now, but that could change.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Josie: She just needs to learn to trust you again. And she will when she sees that you're not dangerous.",
        "Paul: But I am dangerous. And it's not gonna happen because Meg knows something that you don't know, Josie. I'm not gonna change.",
        "Josie: If you love Eliza --",
        "Paul: I'm not gonna change, Josie. Every time I try and turn my life around, I can't do it. And all I wind up doing is hurting the people that I care about, every single time.",
        "Josie: You did not hurt Eliza in New York. You protected her. You fought for her. And that is the same thing that you did for Meg. You are a good person, Paul. You are.",
        "Paul: You really think so?",
        "[Paul kisses Josie hard]",
        "Josie: Stop it! Paul, no!",
        "Paul: You still think I'm a good person? Don't do that. Hey. What?",
        "Josie: I keep trying to change. I make decisions, I try and do the right thing, like leaving. And then the second that I try to leave --",
        "Paul: I hijacked you.",
        "Josie: And at first, I was scared. But then, it felt right, like -- like I was supposed to help you and Eliza.",
        "Paul: Okay. Maybe I help you now. What is it that you want?",
        "Josie: Dusty. I want Dusty.",
        "Paul: You got anything else on your list? Is there, like, a second thing on your list?",
        "Josie: You're so full of it, you know that?",
        "Paul: How? How am I full of it?",
        "Josie: Wanting to go to jail to prove that you love Meg and Eliza?",
        "Paul: Meg is never gonna forgive me for everything that I've done to her. And she's never gonna trust me again.",
        "Josie: Maybe if you give her some time --",
        "Paul: And she's right to not trust me, you know? Because she gives me an inch, and I just don't leave her alone. I don't do anything, I lie to her, I provoke her, I mislead her, and I hurt her because I just want her to feel something for me. I want her to feel anything for me.",
        "Josie: You're not going to jail. Use this time. Be the man that Meg and Eliza need you to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Katie? Katie!",
        "Henry: She not here?",
        "Brad: No.",
        "Henry: She left a note. Said she forgot about an appointment.",
        "Brad: What appointment?",
        "Henry: It doesn't say.",
        "Brad: That's weird.",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, why didn't call me? She would rather -- she would rather talk than write any day of the week.",
        "Henry: Well, let's not -- let's not overreact here, okay? Just because Vienna decided to trick me into fatherhood doesn't mean that Katie's doing it.",
        "Brad: No, something is definitely off with her, okay? When she found out she got her period, she -- it was like she was gonna cry. Break down and just start crying.",
        "Henry: It's called PMS, champ.",
        "Brad: But when she found out she wasn't pregnant, she was shocked. Only, what's there to be shocked about if you're using birth control?",
        "Henry: Okay, maybe Katie is up to something. What are you going to do about it?",
        "Brad: I'm going to find out the truth. It's empty. She is. She's trying to get pregnant behind my back.",
        "Henry: That does not prove anything. Maybe she just put it somewhere else.",
        "Brad: Come on, this is Katie we're talking about. You know her, I mean, she's a neat freak. A place for everything, and everything in its place. And this is the place for her diaphragm.",
        "Henry: Maybe she found a new place, Brad.",
        "Brad: Let's look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Do you want to tell me why you're in such a rush? Why you can't just let nature take its course?",
        "Katie: Because this isn't the first time that I've tried to get pregnant. And I don't know, I might need some help. And if I need that help, then I want it as soon as possible.",
        "Margo: Katie, Honey, you're so young. You've got time.",
        "Katie: Do you know how many husbands I've had?",
        "Margo: Well, I don't know how you count. I mean, do you count that you got married twice -- come on. You and Brad aren't in any trouble, you're not having problems, are you?",
        "Katie: No, no, Brad and I are better than ever. Which makes me want to have his baby now more than ever. Especially before something awful happens.",
        "Margo: What? Awful like what?",
        "Katie: Like one of us gets sick, or Brad decides that we can't afford a baby right now, or I don't know, whatever.",
        "Margo: So you are seeing a fertility specialist on your own so that Brad doesn't get a chance to weigh in?",
        "Katie: It's my body.",
        "Margo: No, no, it's not. Not since you took those vows. You belong to him, he belongs to you. And moreover, lying in a marriage is not the way to run it, you know. Why don't you just call him?",
        "Katie: You're right.",
        "Nurse: Katie? The doctor will see you now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: No call back from Vienna?",
        "Henry: Nope, Liebchen is definitely avoiding me. Did you find the diaphragm?",
        "Brad: No, I looked in the bathroom, I looked in all her drawers, I looked in all my drawers.",
        "Henry: What about the kitchen? Right, right, yeah, it's probably not in there.",
        "Brad: I just can't believe that she would pretend to use birth control when she wasn't. I just thought I could trust her.",
        "Henry: You probably can, most of the time. But women, they march to their own drum. You never know what they're thinking.",
        "Brad: What do you think Vienna is thinking?",
        "Henry: That she knows me better than I know myself. And that deep in my heart, I really do want a kid.",
        "Brad: Is she right?",
        "Henry: Who wouldn't want a miniature Vienna? Those eyes and the laugh. Imagining her pregnant, I mean, I get it, I'm human. Plus I'm madly in love with her, which doesn't hurt.",
        "Brad: So you do want this.",
        "Henry: Only up to a point.",
        "Brad: What the hell does that supposed to mean?",
        "Henry: Newborn, infant, toddler -- I can handle that. But then there comes that pivotal moment when you figure out that they are learning things from you, both good and bad. And I would not be a good role model, Brad.",
        "Brad: You'd be a good dad.",
        "Henry: Oh, don't you start! Listen, even though I love Vienna, she must be stopped. I will not be coerced into making her pregnant.",
        "Brad: Look, I'm not gonna get Katie pregnant, neither, okay, not until the doctors say it's safe. So how are we going to do this?",
        "Henry: We could stop having sex.",
        "Brad: Maybe you could.",
        "Henry: Did I just say that? No. Or --",
        "Brad: Or --",
        "Henry: Or I have been toying around with the idea of a vasectomy.",
        "[Brad laughing]",
        "Henry: I take it that does not appeal to you?",
        "Brad: Hell, no, no. Hell, no. Okay, I do plan on having children eventually.",
        "Henry: Well, it is reversible.",
        "Brad: Look, I don't want any scalpel anywhere near that neighborhood, okay? Once is enough, never mind twice.",
        "Henry: Right, yeah, okay. I'm going to the hospital to get some information. Do you want to come with?",
        "Brad: I'm going to find another way to protect Katie from herself.",
        "Henry: Okay, but remember, the only safe sex is no sex.",
        "Brad: Well, let's go to the hospital and find out about vasectomies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What makes you think that you have the right to walk into my house whenever you feel like it?",
        "Dusty: Well, since you love Meg so much, I didn't think I would be interrupting anything, but I guess I was wrong.",
        "Josie: It wasn't like that. Paul was upset, and so was I --",
        "Dusty: No need to explain. I gotta talk to Paul.",
        "Josie: Yeah, I'll go.",
        "Paul: No, Josie, please, stay. Dusty's not going to say anything worse about me in private that he hasn't already said in public.",
        "Dusty: Got something for you. Turning over Fairwinds and all your assets and property to Meg? You think with all these big gestures, you'll have her back where you want her? Hmm? 'Cause she doesn't want anything from you.",
        "Paul: How do you know?",
        "Dusty: She told me. She's not taking your money.",
        "Paul: Is she taking yours? I can find out easily enough, you may as well just tell me.",
        "Dusty: She wants to do things on her own. I respect that decision. So should you.",
        "Paul: She turned you down, didn't she? What'd you offer, Dusty? A house, a car, a yacht?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah, beautiful yacht. Yeah, I'll see you later.",
        "Paul: Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on! What are you really so angry about? What are you here for? What are you really here for?",
        "Dusty: I'm tired of you trying to control Meg, and so is she.",
        "Paul: I don't think that's it. You know what I think is getting to you? I think that you want to be her savior, and she turned you down, and you just can't take it.",
        "Dusty: She doesn't want to hear it from you, and she doesn't want your money.",
        "Josie: Just go, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Kind of protective, aren't you, Josie?",
        "Josie: I'm trying to look out for you, okay? This isn't helping anyone.",
        "Dusty: No, you're right. You're right. Meg wants nothing to do with you.",
        "Paul: I still get to see Eliza, and I still get to pay child support, and legally, there is nothing that Meg can do about that.",
        "Dusty: She'll find a way.",
        "Paul: Why would she do that? Why wouldn't she want Eliza to have everything that she needs?",
        "Dusty: She wants to do everything on her own. She wants you out of her life. Period.",
        "Josie: Dusty, wait! Hey, I know that you think there was something going on back there between Paul and me, but --",
        "Dusty: It doesn't matter.",
        "Josie: It matters what you think about me. And I'm telling you, I don't have any romantic feelings for Paul.",
        "Dusty: Whatever. I keep telling you, he's bad news.",
        "Josie: He's trying to change his life, to do the right thing.",
        "Dusty: Meg had his child, and she can't change him. If you think you can, good luck with it.",

        "Henry: You know, they might give us a two-for-one deal if we sign up for vasectomies at the same time. What do you think?",
        "Brad: That I don't even want to think about it. Count me out. I'll wait for you at the coffee.",
        "Henry: Chicken.",
        "Brad: Proud of it. Margo? What are you doing here? I mean, you're not sick or something, I hope?",
        "Margo: No, no, I'm here with Katie.",
        "Brad: Well, I didn't think she had something scheduled today. Who's the doctor? What is it about?",
        "Margo: Those are all really very interesting questions. Ones I'm sure that Katie can answer for you.",
        "Katie: Honey, hi! It's so good to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: That's great, now what? Now what? What do you think of all this now?",
        "Josie: About what?",
        "Paul: She sends that guy over here! That guy! She knows I hate him! She intentionally sends him! It's like a slap in the face!",
        "Josie: You don't know that she sent him.",
        "Paul: She didn't do anything to stop him. What did I do? Why am I being punished? All I'm guilty of is trying to do the right thing for Eliza and for Meg, and this is what I get in return? I'm going over there.",
        "Josie: Why?",
        "Paul: Why? Because Meg can talk to me, or Meg can have her lawyer talk to my lawyer, but she's never gonna send Donovan over here to give me a message again.",
        "Josie: Or what? You're going to kidnap her baby, break her heart? What could you possibly do to Meg that you haven't already done? But you know what? If you want to go, go.",
        "Paul: What, you're not gonna stop me? You're not gonna try and talk me out of it?",
        "Josie: Could I?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Josie: Then what's the point of trying?",
        "Paul: I don't know, it's strange. I don't know you that well, but you don't usually give up that easy.",
        "Josie: I finally get it. It took me a while, but I can see now that you are in a battle for Meg, and it doesn't matter if you have to fight Meg or Dusty or yourself. There's no room in your life for anything but that fight. And I am done trying to protect people from themselves.",
        "Paul: Right, even Dusty?",
        "Josie: Good-bye, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Yes, it was just a routine checkup, but I'm fine.",
        "Brad: What a relief.",
        "Katie: What are you doing here?",
        "Brad: I came here with Henry to -- we're just checking into insurance.",
        "Katie: Oh. So do you need to stay here and do that?",
        "Brad: No, I'd rather come home with you. Look, I'll go find him and tell him I'll see him later, okay?",
        "Katie: I'll meet you in the parking lot.",
        "Brad: Okay, all right.",
        "Margo: I don't like being made part of your lie.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Margo. It's just that it was too soon to tell Brad about all of this.",
        "Margo: Hello, he's your husband. He's the one person who should absolutely know that you're consulting a fertility specialist.",
        "Katie: Just let me handle it, okay?",
        "Margo: Why don't you and Brad go and talk to Bob? He's a great doctor, and I'm sure he can explain your options, okay?",
        "Katie: I'm not going to talk to Bob. It's unnecessary. Everything's fine. I gotta run. I gotta meet Brad. Thank you.",

        "Meg: What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: You got a problem with me, you deal with me. Don't send Dusty Donovan to do your dirty work.",
        "Meg: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "Paul: Everything that I offered to you, I offered to you in good faith.",
        "Meg: Okay, will you keep your voice down? Eliza's sleeping.",
        "Paul: If you weren't going to accept my offer, you could have had the respect for me, the decency to turn me down to my face.",
        "Meg: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Paul: The papers that I had my lawyer draw up. Giving you Fairwinds, transferring all of my assets over to you, over to Eliza.",
        "Meg: When was this? I didn't see any papers.",
        "Paul: Dusty -- wait, you didn't send Dusty to my house to return these?",
        "Meg: Are you saying Dusty --",
        "Paul: So he intercepted them, he acted on his own?",
        "Meg: He had no right to do that.",
        "Paul: Yeah, he had no right to do that.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. I'll talk to him. I'll make that clear. I'm sorry he bothered you.",
        "Paul: No, please, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have thought that you wouldn't -- I -- anyway, listen, I'm making you an offer that I hope that you won't refuse.",
        "Meg: Paul --",
        "Paul: Meg, please. Do it for Eliza. Please. Fairwinds is hers. Raise her there. Give her everything that she would have had if we were still a family. Come on, go on, take them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: If you're gonna give me a message from your buddy, Paul, forget it.",
        "Josie: No messages, Donovan. But I do have something that I'd like to say for myself.",
        "Dusty: I'm not sure I want to hear it.",
        "Josie: You always think the worst of me.",
        "Dusty: Not always. There were times --",
        "Josie: I was starting to think that I imagined that. The way that you look at me now, it's like we were never together. Like you never knew how much I -- I had a whole speech prepared.",
        "Dusty: Well, you started off wrong. You should have said I always act like I think the worst of you.",
        "Josie: Oh?",
        "Dusty: The truth is, I'm mad at myself for trusting you.",
        "Josie: I guess -- I guess I should be sorry about the way that we met.",
        "Dusty: Working with Paul? Conjuring up my dead wife, you're not sorry for that? Why is that?",
        "Josie: I can't be sorry that I met you. I just can't. I kept hoping that you would get to know me, give me a chance to reverse your bad impression.",
        "Dusty: I tried, but you ended up with Paul.",
        "Josie: I'm not with Paul. I never was. I feel sorry for him, and that is as far as it goes.",
        "Dusty: Your compassion is misplaced.",
        "Josie: Well, it extends to you, too.",
        "Dusty: I don't need it, Josie.",
        "Josie: Right. What you seem to need is my absence. So I'm leaving. For good this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You were kind of quiet on the ride over. Something happen at your appointment?",
        "Katie: No, it was just routine, you know, like I said. I'm going to go change. You want to fix us a couple of sandwiches?",
        "Brad: Ham and cheese?",
        "Katie: Yes. Ooh, and we can have that apple pie a la mode for dessert.",
        "Brad: Maybe cookies. You -- love cookies.",
        "Katie: Yeah, whatever. Brad! Were you looking for something in my drawer?",
        "Brad: Of course not!",
        "Katie: Maybe Liberty was looking for something while we were out.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. No, no, I can't let Liberty take the rap. You've been drumming into my head about how important it is for us to be honest with each other, so I'm gonna tell you the truth.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Brad: I did, I went through your drawer. Not just that one. I went through all of them.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Brad: I was looking for your diaphragm.",
        "Katie: I don't understand.",
        "Brad: Henry told me he caught Vienna poking holes in his condoms, you know, because she wanted to get pregnant without, you know -- she wanted to make it look like it just happened without trying to make it happen. So I thought --",
        "Katie: You thought I was doing the same thing?",
        "Brad: Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I should have -- I should have trusted you. I do. I do, but this is going to bug me until I know what's going on. So I have to ask you -- where's your diaphragm?",
        "Katie: Don't put me in the same category as Vienna. Our situations are entirely different.",
        "Brad: You both want to get pregnant.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but Henry doesn't want to have a child, whereas you want a baby just as much as I do, don't you?",
        "Brad: Of course I do. Look, I know how much you hate it when I bring up what Dr. Bob said, but he's a very smart guy. And if he thinks you shouldn't be getting pregnant until you're 100%, we're gonna wait. Right?",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Brad: Right.",
        "Katie: So let's eat.",
        "Brad: All right, I'm on it. All right. So I just have to ask you, where is your diaphragm?",
        "Katie: Brad -- I threw it away.",
        "Brad: What? How could you do that? I mean, we talked about this. I mean, we said we were gonna wait, at least until the doctor said it was okay. We agreed to that.",
        "Katie: No, no, you don't understand. No, I threw it away because I'm getting a new one.",
        "Brad: Since when?",
        "Katie: Well, they wear out, you know? And I didn't want to take any chances, so that's why I was at the doctor's today. I was getting fitted for a new one.",
        "Brad: Oh, wow. I feel like an idiot.",
        "Katie: No, no, you shouldn't. I should have explained it a little bit better. I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: No, I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: No, you don't need to apologize.",
        "Brad: No, the hell I don't. I mean, we're always talking about how we -- honesty and trust. I mean, you would never do something like that. I'm sorry, I should have known better. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Put the papers away, Paul.",
        "Paul: Look, this isn't some trick to try and get you back. I really want Eliza to have this.",
        "Meg: Okay, then set up a trust fund for her, and when she's 21, she can live in your house and spend your money. But until then, she's my responsibility.",
        "Paul: So everything that Dusty said is true.",
        "Meg: Look, it was wrong for him to take the papers from me. But if he said that I am not taking anything from you, he's right. I don't want this. Any of it.",
        "Paul: So is Dusty gonna support you? Is that what's happening? Is he going to ride to your rescue one more time, save you from big, bad Paul?",
        "Meg: You know, I thought you came here to talk to me, to ask me what I wanted.",
        "Paul: I did.",
        "Meg: You know, I'm just so sick and tired of every man assuming that I need to be taken care of. You know, my mother ran a farm and raised six kids on her own. I think I can raise one little girl, and that's exactly what I intend to do.",
        "Paul: I'm not saying that you can't. I just don't want you to be exhausted in the meantime.",
        "Meg: Well, I don't want your money, Paul.",
        "Paul: I need to have some kind of contact with her. And how can I do that, if you won't let me help?",

        "Meg: She's been fussy all day. I think we woke her up.",
        "Paul: Sorry. Daddy will learn to keep his voice down one of these days.",
        "Meg: I think she wants to be held. Hey, you can hold her.",

        "Josie: I'm going -- I can't tell you. If I did, I'd just be waiting and hoping for you to walk in the door some day. But this way, I can pretend that you're not coming because you just don't know where to look.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry, Josie.",
        "Josie: Will you do something for me?",
        "Dusty: If I can.",
        "Josie: You've lost your son, and maybe you think that you can start a new family with Meg. But what you don't realize is that you've lost yourself, too. Find that guy. Make him happy. Even if you have to walk through fire to do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I can stick around, you know, give her a bottle.",
        "Meg: This is the last time you'll be seeing her here, Paul.",

        "Meg: Well, from now on, your visits will be limited to a neutral place with a court-appointed social worker.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on. Look, I know that's what the judge said. But do we really need to raise Eliza like that?",

        "Paul: Please don't do this.",
