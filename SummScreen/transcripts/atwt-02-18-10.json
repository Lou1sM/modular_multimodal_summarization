Parker tells Jack and Carly that he knows they want to be together and they are sacrificing their happiness because Liberty is sick.

        "Dusty: I didn't think you were coming in today.",
        "Janet: I thought it'd be best if I kept busy.",
        "Dusty: You don't need to be here. I've got things covered.",
        "Janet: You trying to kick me out or something?",
        "Dusty: Just want you to be where you should be.",
        "Janet: I'm fine, okay?",
        "Dusty: Anything happen?",
        "Janet: Liberty's chemo treatments aren't going the way we had hoped.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry. Sorry to hear that.",
        "Janet: The chemo's compromising her white blood cells. It's making her more susceptible to infection.",
        "Dusty: So what are they going to do?",
        "Janet: Well -- they have to suspend the chemo until they can figure out the right dosage.",
        "Dusty: Any matches for a donor yet?",
        "Janet: No, and I have called very body.",
        "Dusty: Your whole family?",
        "Janet: Well, not my parents.",
        "Dusty: I know you have a rough history with your parents.",
        "Janet: Try no history at all, okay? They haven't spoken to me since I got pregnant.",
        "Dusty: I hope that's not going to stop you from asking.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? If they were home, I would get down on my knees and beg them to get tested. But according to Teresa, they're in Italy on vacation.",
        "Dusty: Well, they can't be gone long. Doesn't your old man have a business to run?",
        "Janet: Yeah, Ciccone Hardware.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Janet: That's my phone. Excuse me. I've got to take this.",

        "Carly: Yes, Craig, I am aware that that I'm the one who asked to take me to dinner, but I changed my mind. It's my prerogative. I like to think of it as a moment of temporary insanity. But -- but I don't care what you think, Craig. Bye.",

        "Jack: Is this a bad time?",
        "Carly: Depends. What's wrong?",
        "Jack: Nothing. I just -- I, uh -- I wanted to apologize for leaving like that at the police station.",
        "Carly: It's okay. It's -- its good you left when you did. Liberty needed you.",
        "Jack: I know that.",
        "Carly: And -- and we never should have let ourselves get carried away like that. We have to be stronger than this, Jack.",
        "Jack: I'm trying. It's just -- it's not easy. I can't get you out of my head.",
        "Carly: Try harder, because this has to stop. I can't keep asking you to leave me alone.",

        "Molly: I'm not ready to produce a story yet. I'm still gathering facts on Damian Grimaldi's disappearance. The last thing we want to do is jump the gun and put out false information.",
        "Producer: We don't need to answer any questions, just intrigue the audience.",
        "Molly: They won't be intrigued. They'll be confused. Look, my -- my story is all over the place right now. I just need a little more time.",
        "Producer: You're supposed to have an in with the family.",
        "Molly: I do, and I am taking full advantage of it. Look, I -- I don't want to blow it because I don't have all the facts. I -- I'm on top of this. I am. And it's going to be a great story. I just need a few more days.",

        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Holden: Ethan ready?",
        "Lily: Should be. Thank you for agreeing to take him to Colby's birthday party.",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Lily: And you're okay with picking him up? I mean, I don't want to put you out.",
        "Holden: No, no. It's -- its fine. How are you? Any news?",
        "Lily: About Damian? No. Mother's hired a private investigator to look into it.",
        "Holden: Why would she do that?",
        "Lily: Because I need to know where he is, Holden.",
        "Holden: If you ask me, it's just a waste of time. Damian doesn't want to be found.",
        "Lily: Only one of the Grimaldi ships set sail that day, the \"Fortuna.\" No one on the docks remembers seeing Damian. But that doesn't mean --",
        "Holden: Lily, I saw him get on a ship.",
        "Lily: The \"Fortuna\"?",
        "Holden: I don't know the name of it. But he did get on a ship.",
        "Lily: Well, if he's planning on leaving, why didn't he get on one of his own ships? I mean, especially if there's a possibility he was hurt?",
        "Holden: I can't answer that.",
        "Lily: Can't or won't?",
        "Ethan: Dad!",
        "Holden: Hey, Buddy!",
        "Lily: Hey, Sweetie, listen. Colby's present's on the dining-room table. You want to go get it? Good, go get it.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: I think you're not being honest with me, Holden. I think something happened between you and Damian on the docks that you're not telling me, and I want to know what it is. I've learned a few things since the last time we talked.",
        "Holden: Like what?",
        "Lily: A crew member on the \"Fortuna\" told Luke that he saw a bloody body on the deck but then when he got there, it was gone.",
        "Holden: Was he able to make an I.D.?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Holden: Well, then, it could have been anyone. It could have been another crew member. It could have been a stowaway.",
        "Lily: Or Damian.",
        "Holden: Lily, you're jumping to conclusions.",
        "Lily: Am I? Damian was at the docks. You were the last person to see him. You said you saw him get on a ship.",
        "Holden: He did get on a ship.",
        "Lily: Well, there were several ships in the dock, but the only one that sailed that day was the \"Fortuna.\" The crew member saw a bloody body on the deck, and then it disappeared. What if it was Damian? What if he was so unstable that he fell overboard and he drown?",
        "Holden: Well, then, he's dead. That's the end of it.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: Lily, look, this is all just speculation. You don't know one way or another. We may never know.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Holden: I got to take this. Hello.",
        "Molly: We've got trouble.",
        "Holden: What is it?",
        "Molly: Not over the phone. I'm at the station. How quickly can you get here?",
        "Holden: I've got to take Ethan to a birthday party. But after I drop him off, I can stop by.",
        "Molly: Good.",
        "Holden: I have to go. Ethan, you ready, Buddy?",
        "Lily: Listen to me. I know you despise Damian. You won't be shedding any tears over him.",
        "Holden: That's right. I don't care what happened to him, as long as he's out of your life.",
        "Lily: It's more than that.",
        "Holden: Lily, Damian's gone. Whatever happened to him is out of our hands. Your life is here. Your family is here. Damian almost destroyed that. You have to let it go.",

        "Parker: Did -- did I interrupt something?",
        "Carly: No. Aren't you going to be late for physical therapy?",
        "Parker: I've still got some time.",
        "Jack: Well, I -- I should get going.",
        "Parker: Oh, no, please. Please don't leave on my account. You two were clearly, um, in the middle of something when I came in. So please feel free to continue.",
        "Jack: Carly -- Carly and I were -- were just talking.",
        "Parker: Uh-huh. Sure. I'll -- I'll see you guys later.",
        "Carly: Should I expect you for dinner?",
        "Parker: I think I'm going to go check on Liberty after my sessions so prob -- probably not. I'll just get something at Al's. Will I see you at the farm later?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Parker: Okay. Bye.",
        "Jack: Uh, be careful, though. I know you're feeling better, but you should still take it easy behind the wheel.",
        "Parker: Good advice.",
        "Jack: Okay, that was weird.",
        "Carly: Our own son is suspicious that we're fooling around.",
        "Jack: He doesn't seem too upset by it.",
        "Carly: How he feels about it isn't the point.",
        "Jack: I know. So, you going to be having dinner all alone tonight?",
        "Carly: It's not the first time. It won't be the last.",
        "Jack: Would you like some company?",
        "Carly: No. Bad idea.",
        "Jack: It's just dinner, Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack, it wouldn't be just dinner, and I think we both know that.",

        "Dusty: You back from your trip?",
        "Rocco: What trip?",
        "Dusty: You didn't take a trip to Italy?",
        "Rocco: No. Who is this? I'm calling from Oakdale, regarding your granddaughter, Liberty. She's very ill.",
        "Rocco: I don't know who you are, but I don't have a granddaughter.",
        "Dusty: You know that's not true, Mr. Ciccone, so hear me out.",
        "Rocco: Don't call this number again.",

        "Dusty: Hello? Hello?",
        "Janet: What's the matter?",
        "Dusty: Just a supplier. He needs a course in manners. Is everything all right with you?",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: You going to be okay to run the fort for a little while?",
        "Janet: Sure.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I've got a lot to do. I've got errands to do, I've got to pick up the dry cleaning, and I have to stop by Metro to talk to Dusty about last year's taxes.",
        "Jack: You're making excuses.",
        "Carly: And you've got to go home to your wife. Am I still making excuses? I'm just trying to live my life and not get sucked into this insane game that we're playing.",
        "Jack: It's not a game.",
        "Carly: It is. And I can't keep being the one to put on the brakes. It's not fair.",
        "Jack: You're right. It's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Someone on Damian's ship, a crewman, saw a body lying on the deck, a man that was beaten up pretty bad. He disappeared before the crewman could get to him.",
        "Molly: That's good. That means he's not dead. He's moving around.",
        "Holden: Or he was swept overboard, which seems to be the prevailing thought.",
        "Molly: But there's no proof it's Damian.",
        "Holden: Molly, I know what kind of shape he was in when I left him on that deck. If he was too weak to hold on, it's possible that he fell into the water.",
        "Molly: But you don't know if that's what happened.",
        "Holden: You know what? Look, the situation is not looking good. And I think it's best if you just distance yourself from it, and from me.",
        "Molly: Not an option, Holden. We're in this together.",
        "Holden: Molly, be sensible here. It's one thing to cover for me if I had a fight with Damian, but if this turns into a murder investigation, I'm not dragging you into it.",
        "Molly: Nobody's getting dragged anywhere. We're going to figure this out together.",
        "Holden: There's nothing left to figure out. I'm turning myself in.",
        "Molly: Whoa. Holden, turning yourself in is possibly the worst thing you could do right now.",
        "Holden: The way I see it, it's the only thing I can do.",
        "Molly: And what exactly would you be confessing? There isn't even a body. Nobody can even verify that the wounded man on ship was Damian.",
        "Holden: Odds are, he was.",
        "Molly: The police aren't interested in odds, Holden. They want evidence, which you don't have. So they'll push you, and they'll grill you, and they'll grill Lily, and they'll put your whole family through the hell of an investigation that may not even have any merit. Is that what you want?",
        "Holden: You know I don't.",
        "Molly: Okay, good. So let's get to the bottom of this ourselves.",
        "Holden: Lucinda hired a private investigator to look into it.",
        "Molly: Oh --",
        "Holden: How long do you think it's going to take them to find out what I already know, what you know? Molly, I -- I just think it's best if I go to the police before they come to me.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry, Holden, but I really think you're acting out of panic and guilt.",
        "Holden: Lily and Luke need closure. It's the only way they're going to stop obsessing over what happened to Damian and move on.",
        "Molly: Mm-hmm. And if you're in jail, does that bring them closure? We don't even know what really happened here. For all we know, Damian's on some beach somewhere in the middle of the Mediterranean, sipping Campari.",
        "Holden: Or he's lying at the bottom of the ocean, thanks to me.",
        "Molly: Fine. If you find that body and you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that you caused his death, then you know what? By all means, let the conscious be your guide. But if not, I am begging you, please don't do anything you're going to regret.",
        "Producer: Molly, they need you in the control room.",
        "Holden: I need to go pick up Ethan.",
        "Molly: Are we on the same page?",
        "Holden: I have to think about it. I'll call you.",
        "Producer: Listen, Molly --",
        "Molly: Yeah, I'm sorry. I can't do this right now. I really have to follow a lead that won't wait.",

        "Liberty: Parker, hey. What are you doing here?",
        "Parker: Just checking on you. It looks like you just found out you have cancer or something.",
        "Liberty: Oh, ha, ha, ha! Ironic. I did. Didn't you have a physical-therapy appointment or something, gimpy?",
        "Parker: Yeah, but I blew it off. You said you needed help with your homework, remember?",
        "Liberty: Wow, who knew? Getting sick kind of has its upsides.",
        "Parker: No, but seriously, how are you feeling?",
        "Liberty: Half dead. [Yawns] How are you?",
        "Parker: My -- my leg still hurts.",
        "Liberty: Well, if you went to your physical-therapy appointment, you could do something about it.",
        "Parker: But coming here and giving you a hard time is just much more fun.",
        "Liberty: No! You're not allowed to ruin your life 'cause I'm dying.",
        "Parker: You're not dying.",
        "Liberty: I'm totally dying. Are you ready? Are you ready for this? I do a really good dying. [Liberty groans] Parker --",
        "Parker: You know what? That -- that was by far the worst death that I've ever seen.",
        "Liberty: Just stick around. The real thing's going to be amazing. Very theatrical.",
        "Parker: You know what? Liberty, stop. Your cancer jokes suck. You know what? New rule. From now on, you're not allowed to be funny about this.",
        "Liberty: Don't take funny away from me, Parker. It's all I got.",
        "Parker: No. Liberty, that's not true. You have me, and I'm going to be here every day, all the time, whenever you need me.",
        "Liberty: What about school and therapy?",
        "Parker: None of that stuff is as important as you are.",

        "Carly: Janet.",
        "Janet: Hi. You scared me.",
        "Carly: Sorry. I -- I'm here to see Dusty.",
        "Janet: Oh, he's not here. He'll be back in about an hour or so.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Janet: I'll let him know you stopped by.",
        "Carly: Thanks. So, how's Liberty? How did the first round of chemo go?",
        "Janet: Not too well. It compromised her immune system, so we had to hold off for a little bit.",
        "Carly: How are her spirits?",
        "Janet: I don't know. She's not really saying much to me these days.",
        "Carly: She's scared.",
        "Janet: I know! I know that. Maybe you can give her a call. You know, she really -- she had a good time working with you the other day. I think it'd be nice if you did that.",
        "Carly: I will certainly call her, then. And how are you?",
        "Janet: Managing.",
        "Carly: You know, I can't even begin to imagine. Oh, you are probably so sick of hearing people say that.",
        "Janet: Quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of the whole damn thing.",
        "Carly: I know I've told you this before, but you are incredibly brave.",
        "Janet: Well, thanks to Jack. I'd be a basket case if he hadn't come back home.",
        "Carly: Well, then, it's -- it's a good thing he did. I got to go. Tell Dusty I'll call him later.",

        "Rocco: Good afternoon. Can I help you?",
        "Dusty: Rocco Ciccone?",
        "Rocco: That's me. And I know everyone in town, so you're either new or just passing through.",
        "Dusty: Just passing through.",
        "Rocco: What can I do for you, Stranger?",
        "Dusty: You can try to save your granddaughter's life. Her name's Liberty, in case you forgot. She's very sick.",
        "Rocco: You're the guy who called earlier?",
        "Dusty: That's me.",
        "Rocco: I thought I made myself clear.",
        "Dusty: I guess I didn't.",
        "Rocco: You wasted a trip, Mister. We've got nothing to talk about.",
        "Dusty: Your granddaughter has leukemia. She's 18 years old. The chemo didn't work. She needs a bone-marrow transplant.",
        "Rocco: Why didn't Janet get tested?",
        "Dusty: She did, as did a lot of other people who care about your granddaughter, including myself. So far, nobody's a match.",
        "Rocco: What about that miserable excuse of a father, Brad Snyder?",
        "Dusty: Brad died just recently.",
        "Rocco: What a loss.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Yeah, he actually stepped up as a father these past few years.",
        "Rocco: So, who are you, and why are you here asking me and not Janet?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause Janet thinks you're in Italy. Besides, she doesn't think you'd put yourself out.",
        "Rocco: Well, she's right.",
        "Dusty: I have a little more faith as a father and a grandfather you'll do the right thing.",
        "Rocco: Oh, so you're the new man in her life? Did you at least have the decency to put a ring on her finger?",
        "Dusty: No, it's not like that. We're just friends.",
        "Rocco: [Laughs] You're just friends. Isn't that the same? Janet will never change. They're all just friends.",
        "Dusty: Hey, Mr. Ciccone, with due respect, that's no way to talk about your daughter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hi. I'm sorry to stop by like this, but I was hoping I could ask you a few questions.",
        "Lily: What about?",
        "Molly: Damian's disappearance.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Molly: I'm doing a piece for WOAK.",
        "Lily: Molly, I don't know anything about why Damian disappeared. So I can't see how I could help you. And frankly, I don't know if I would if I could. And it's pretty tacky of you to ask me.",
        "Molly: I'm just trying to do my job, covering all the bases. I'm not trying to embarrass anybody or hurt anybody.",
        "Lily: Forgive me if I don't believe that.",
        "Molly: I -- I'm just trying to get the truth. What other agenda would I have?",
        "Lily: I don't know, Molly, but I'm sure you have one, so why don't you cut the bull and tell me what it is?",
        "Molly: I'm sorry you don't trust me, though I'm not surprised. But there is no agenda here, I swear. I am just a reporter doing a job.",
        "Lily: Well, do it somewhere else. I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Molly: Well, I would think you'd want your side of the story made public.",
        "Lily: What story do you mean, exactly?",
        "Molly: The story where Damian Grimaldi swoops in, takes advantage of Holden's disappearance to get you to marry him. The one where he withholds evidence, bribes a police officer, forces Meg into a psychiatric ward just to cover his tracks and then tries to kill her and Holden when things start to fall apart.",
        "Lily: Why on earth would I want to make any of that public?",
        "Molly: Because the people want to know what really happened.",
        "Lily: Well, you seem to have all the elements you need to write a hatchet piece on Damian. What do you need me for?",
        "Molly: Because I'm looking for the other side of the coin, Lily. The side of Damian that was able to seduce someone as smart as you into believing all of his lies.",
        "Lily: Gosh, Molly, when you put it like that --",
        "Molly: You obviously loved him or you wouldn't have married him. Can you tell me why?",
        "Lily: He gave me this. Read the inscription.",
        "Molly: \"Cara, even these beautiful words cannot truly express my love for you.\" Wow. It's hard to believe the same guy who wrote this also turned everybody's lives upside down.",
        "Lily: That's my point exactly. Damian is a good man who ended up going down a dark path.",
        "Molly: And now he's paid for it.",
        "Lily: What do you mean? Do you know something new about Damian's disappearance?",
        "Molly: No. No, just the fact that he had to disappear at all when he seemed to finally be getting everything that he wanted. I mean, that seems like just punishment, don't you think? [Coughing] I'm so sorry. Could you get me some water?",
        "Lily: Are you okay?",
        "Molly: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Yeah, of course.",

        "Lily: Here you go. Here.",
        "Molly: Gosh, thanks. That was really bad. Mm. Thank you. I'm sorry. [Coughs] Lily, the last thing that I wanted was to come here to put you on the spot, back you into a corner. I just really want to show both sides of the man in this piece.",
        "Lily: I'd believe that if it were anyone but you, Molly.",
        "Molly: Naturally. If you change your mind, call me.",

        "Rocco: I can't punish someone who doesn't exist to me.",

        "Rocco: She never reached out to us to make amends.",

        "Jack: No, Parker, it wasn't. Look, I understand you wanting to spend time with her, and I know she appreciates that. But you've got to take care of yourself, as well.",

        "Janet: Yeah. I could have saved you a trip.",

        "Jack: So, what is it you think your mother and I are sacrificing?",
        "Parker: I'm not clueless, Dad. I see the way you look at each other, the way you guys jump apart and act really nervous whenever someone else walks into the room. You guys want to be together, but you can't because of Liberty. You think I don't know that?",
        "Jack: That's not what's going on, Parker. Uh, I'm married. I'm married to Janet, and I am committed to my marriage.",
        "Parker: You're committed because Liberty's sick. You're making a sacrifice.",

        "Parker: Well, I'm not saying it's simple, but you can't tell me that I'm wrong.",
        "Jack: We're not talking about us, Son. We're talking about you.",
        "Parker: Okay. Deny it. However you guys want to handle it, that's fine. It's none of my business, and I don't want it to be. All I'm saying is that I want to make a sacrifice. I want to be there for Liberty. I want to help her. I want to put that before everything else just for a while. All right?",
        "Carly: We're not going to let you do that.",
        "Jack: No, and you shouldn't have to. Look, spend time with her. Be there for her. Support her. Be her friend. I think that's great. But take an hour out of the day to go to therapy. And do not jeopardize your grades, 'cause I guarantee you, that we will have a problem with.",

        "Parker: Fine. I won't.",
        "Carly: You don't have to sacrifice anything. Liberty wouldn't want you to.",
        "Jack: You can have it both ways. You just have to put a little effort into it.",
        "Parker: Well, I'm sorry. I -- I just don't really get the double standard here.",
        "Jack: Things are different for us. Adults make choices and have to live with the consequences.",
