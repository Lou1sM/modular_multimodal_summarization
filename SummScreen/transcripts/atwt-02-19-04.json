        "Jessica: Sarah? I didn't know you were home.",
        "Sarah: I just came by to pick up some books. I'm heading out. I have to study with Casey.",
        "Jessica: Oh, well, this one time studying can wait. We're having company.",
        "Sarah: Who?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Jessica: Open the door and see.",
        "Casey: So, what did you want to tell me?",
        "Sarah: Keep your voice down. Jessica's in the kitchen. And I can't go out. We have company coming. What's with the cake?",
        "Casey: It's dessert, genius. And I am the company. Well, part of it, anyway. My mom and grandma come in.",
        "Sarah: Okay. Come up to my room.",
        "Ben: Hey, Casey! Good to see you, man. Look, Jessica and I really appreciate all the help that you gave Sarah in the election at school.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, I figured she'd be good for politics. I mean, she loves to talk, loves being the center of attention --",
        "Sarah: Shut up!",
        "Casey: -- Loves pushing people around.",
        "Margo: Hey, hey, hey! We're here!",
        "Lisa: And we are bearing gifts.",
        "Jessica: Thank you so much for bringing that.",
        "Lisa: My pleasure.",
        "Jessica: Thank you. Let us have your coats.",
        "Lisa: Okay.",
        "Ben: What's in the box?",
        "Margo: It's a surprise for Sarah.",
        "Sarah: That's for me?",
        "Jessica: Ben and I wanted to show you how proud we are of you for winning the election. But you cannot open it until after dinner. Who's hungry?",
        "Margo: Me! Free food. Let's go.",
        "Lisa: Thank you.",
        "Ben: Sure.",
        "Sarah: I hate her.",
        "Casey: Which her?",
        "Sarah: Jessica. First, she lies to me, and now she's trying to bribe me. You know those letters I wrote to Bonnie? She never even gave them to her.",
        "Casey: Are you sure?",
        "Sarah: I'm sure I'm going to find some way to get back at her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jane: I already explained everything to the other officers. Could you please just get that awful man out of here?",
        "Filloux: Certainly. In a moment. Did Mr. Montgomery try to harm you in any way?",
        "Craig: Of course not!",
        "Jane: He tried to buy my baby!",
        "[Craig groans]",
        "Filloux: I could have made life very difficult for you, Mr. Montgomery, back in Oakdale. But I felt that you and your wife were victims as much as Ms. Currier was. Why couldn't you leave well enough alone?",
        "Craig: Well, because I love that baby. He lived with us for six months. We're his parents!",
        "Filloux: That is simply not true. The baby has a mother who loves him. It's time you realized you are no longer a part of this child's life!",
        "Craig: How can I just let him go like that? Could you?",
        "Jane: You keep that man away from my baby!",
        "Craig: Wait, wait, wait! Don't take me away! Please!",
        "Filloux: Mr. Montgomery, you leave me no choice. I'm placing you under arrest.",
        "Craig: Wait, wait! No, no, no!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So you really like it?",
        "Jennifer: Mom, I love it. You know, growing up, I always thought your designs were beautiful. But getting to wear them -- wow, we're really doing this, aren't we? All of us, working together.",
        "Barbara: Just as it should be. Well, I guess we'd better get going.",
        "Jennifer: Let me grab my purse and my coat.",
        "Barbara: Okay.",
        "Paul: Here, I'll take this.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Barbara: You know, I can't wait to see the look on our competitors' faces when B.R.O. rises from the ashes to reclaim its rightful spot.",
        "Paul: Okay, tell me you're not going to put that in the press release.",
        "Barbara: Too theatrical?",
        "Paul: Maybe just a little.",
        "[Barbara chuckles]",
        "Barbara: Really? After everything I've survived these last three years -- to have it ending happily, because of you. So I ask you, who more than I deserves a little extra time center-stage, huh?",
        "Paul: No one I can think of.",
        "Barbara: And no one's gonna take it away from me this time either.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Carly: We need to talk business.",
        "Barbara: Well, then it will be a very short conversation -- since you have no business here. Does she, Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Carly, hi! What are you doing here?",
        "Barbara: My question, precisely.",
        "Paul: You know what she's doing here? She's standing in the doorway. Please, Carly -- please come on in.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Paul: Mom and Jennifer were just on their way out. I'll be with you in one second.",
        "Barbara: What is going on, Paul?",
        "Paul: Outside.",
        "Carly: Oh, Paul -- how did you get your mother to sign her own death warrant?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Is what Jessica did really that bad?",
        "Sarah: Casey, Jessica lied to me. Okay? She totally played me. There's got to be some way to get back at her. Think.",
        "Casey: About what? It's not like I've ever been in your situation before.",
        "Sarah: Are you telling me that your mom's never lied to you?",
        "Casey: Sure, but I've never been a foster child living with the mother of my best friend who happens to be in the slammer for accidentally drop-kicking my dad out a window.",
        "Sarah: You know, you are so messed sometimes.",
        "Casey: Likewise.",
        "Sarah: Okay. If you're not gonna take me seriously, then I don't need your help. Okay? So, just forget about it.",
        "Ben: What? What'd I interrupt?",
        "Casey: Oh, Sarah was just giving me her take on Einstein's theory of relativity.",
        "Ben: Well, before the two of you move on to quantum mechanics, why don't you come see if Jessica needs a hand putting this food out on the table?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, we'll be right there. Okay, so just tell me now. Are you going to help me think of something or not?",
        "Casey: Okay. I have an idea.",
        "Sarah: What? What is it?",
        "Casey: You sneak into Jessica's bedroom and fill her hand with shaving cream while she's asleep.",
        "Sarah: Casey, I'm not joking around! Can't you get that?",
        "Casey: No, but the best part is when you tickle her nose with a feather, see? And then she wakes up and -- bam, shaving cream all over her face. What? It could work.",
        "Sarah: No, you know, you are so frustrating sometimes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Is your meeting over with?",
        "Bob: Well, it hasn't started yet. Joshua's running late. What are you doing here? I thought you were going to the station.",
        "Kim: I did go. I couldn't stay. I couldn't concentrate.",
        "Bob: What's wrong?",
        "Kim: When I left the house this morning, I thought I left my keys behind, so I doubled back and went into the kitchen. When I opened the door, the kids were -- busy. She was lying on the counter. Her head was on the stove. I was gone eight seconds.",
        "Bob: What did you expect when you invited Alison to move in with us?",
        "Kim: They've got a perfectly good bedroom upstairs. They don't have to turn our kitchen into a -- a --",
        "Bob: Go on. I'm dying to see what you're going to come up with.",
        "Kim: All right, never mind. Never mind.",
        "Bob: I'll talk to Chris.",
        "Kim: And I suppose I should talk to Alison.",
        "Bob: Is that necessary?",
        "Kim: Honey, you know that talking to Chris about Alison does absolutely no good. He gets two to three feet away from her and all the blood rushes out of his brain.",
        "Bob: Hmm. It used to happen to me. Especially when I was within two feet of a certain lounge singer. You know, it's happening again!",
        "Kim: You never -- stop. I know, I know you're making fun of me. But think about, what if that had been you're mother walking in. She would have had apoplexy!",
        "Bob: My mother's walked in when were being frisky and she's still standing.",
        "Kim: Yeah, there's a lot of difference between being frisky and lying on the kitchen counter. Talk to Chris, okay?",
        "Bob: Okay, I'll do it if -- maybe you and I will be a little frisky later?",
        "Kim: Anytime. Anyplace. Except the kitchen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, doctor, you didn't fall asleep, did you?!",
        "Chris: I just got a call from my Dad. I have to go meet him.",
        "Alison: But we've only been living together for a few days. You have to leave me already? This is practically like our honeymoon.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, you can finish unpacking.",
        "Alison: Okay, but that's hard work. I need some inspiration.",
        "Chris: Alison --",
        "Alison: Hmm?",
        "Chris: C'mon. I really, really need to go.",
        "Alison: Okay. How soon do you have to go?",
        "Chris: Mm -- later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Can I call my lawyer?",
        "Filloux: That's up to you. As soon as your credit card can be verified, your fines will be paid and you'll be free to go.",
        "Craig: I'm not being charged?",
        "Filloux: The baby's mother chose not to press charges. She seems to have some sympathy for you and your wife. If you ever try to harass the baby's mother again, I shall seek attempted kidnapping charges against you. And you will spend a lot of years in a Canadian prison. Do I make myself clear?",
        "Craig: Sure. How soon can I go?",
        "Filloux: I'll let you know.",
        "Craig: Oh, Cabot -- I guess I failed you, boy.",
        "Annabelle: And you didn't do me much good either, bucko.",
        "Craig: What are you doing here?",
        "Annabelle: Waiting to be transferred. I guess nobody told Filloux I was on the premises or he never would have brought you down here.",
        "Craig: Oh, I don't know. This is awfully convenient.",
        "Annabelle: So, you tried to get your kid back, huh? Ooh! Hey! You gave me the money for the kid, so that's on you.",
        "Craig: You never bothered to mention you stole him.",
        "Annabelle: I needed the cash.",
        "Craig: Wha -- what were you doing? You knew we were innocent. You had your money. Why'd you have to open your mouth? Why'd you have tell the cops where to find him?",
        "Annabelle: I didn't.",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah. Right, right.",
        "Annabelle: I'm serious. I didn't say a word about you or the kid.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Annabelle: I didn't turn you in, Montgomery. Someone else did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: There is nothing for you -- what are you looking at me like that for?",
        "Barbara: You know, the woman is a viper, Paul!",
        "Paul: Carly and I are just friends.",
        "Barbara: Did I leave anything in there?",
        "Paul: No, you didn't leave anything in there.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, you're getting upset over nothing.",
        "Barbara: You know, she said she had business here. What kind of business, Paul?",
        "Paul: I ran into Carly at the bank. And she said she was gonna meet with the investment guy, and I said, \"listen, if you wanna set up a trust fund for Parker\" --",
        "Barbara: Parker! Hal handles all of that --",
        "Paul: Mom, this is really no big deal.",
        "Barbara: I am not very comfortable with you having your friendship or a relationship or whatever with her!",
        "Jennifer: Mom, why don't you just let this go?",
        "Barbara: No, I will not let it go.",
        "Paul: Okay, mom, you know that I would do anything for you. You know that. Okay? But I feel like I have an obligation to Carly. She's Rosanna's sister, and Rosanna has done an awful lot for me. I think you know that.",
        "Barbara: You know what? There are certain kind trashy women that prey on men, and that one is the trashiest of them all, Paul.",
        "Paul: Right. So you're going to save me, Mommy?",
        "Barbara: I'm trying to.",
        "Paul: Okay, you know what? I think you're very sweet. I think I can take care of myself. All right? You guys go ahead, I'll catch up. I'm sorry. My Mom was so rude. She's feeling a little insecure these days.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't blame her. Since her son has her signing away control of her company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Alison, is there -- is there anything I can do to help you?",
        "Alison: Oh, I wanted to surprise Chris by cooking him dinner.",
        "Kim: Oh, well, terrific. Terrific. What -- what were you planning on serving?",
        "Alison: Well, I was looking for this canned chili my mother gets. It has a picture of a smiling donkey on the label. Where do you keep that?",
        "Kim: I -- I have a feeling I'm out of that right now.",
        "Alison: Chris likes eggs. I could -- I could make him breakfast for dinner! But does he like his eggs boiled? I think that's all that I can handle.",
        "Kim: You know what? Why don't we have a little chat?",
        "Alison: Oh, I can make some tea. You like tea, right? And then you can tell me all about Chris when he was growing up. He must have been so, so, so cute. And did I tell you how much I love your kitchen?",
        "Kim: Alison, come on and sit down here. You know, I've given a lot of thought to this. It occurs to me that you and Chris really feel as if you have a lot of lost time to make up for. But then, of course, you're sharing our home with other people. I mean, it's not like you're in your own place, or in a hotel or something.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. Did I eat too many cookies? No, I didn't know that they were someone's private stash.",
        "Kim: No, it's okay. This is not about cookies. It's about, um -- I'm talking about an issue of -- intimacy.",
        "Alison: Did I do something wrong?",
        "Kim: No, it's not a case of wrong. It's just a case of what's appropriate. I am not blaming you, okay? I mean, I can understand that this is not the kind of thing you run into every day. You know, I mean, you probably never had to deal with what the boundaries are before. But, you know, there's a certain behavior that is appropriate for the bedroom, but nowhere else, like the kitchen.",
        "Alison: Oh. Oh, gosh. Oh. I mean, Chris and I thought that everyone was gone. How did you --",
        "Kim: Actually, I thought I had forgotten my keys and I came back and walked in and there you were lying on the stove -- the counter. Now, I'm not blaming you, understand? But --",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Alison: Mom, hi! What are you doing here?",
        "Susan: It appears I came just in time. And, for the record, Alison knows her boundaries, because I taught them to her. Maybe it's Chris who doesn't know his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Oh, thank you, Mrs. Grimaldi, I love it.",
        "Lisa: Oh, don't thank me; thank Jessica, she's the one who picked it out.",
        "Sarah: Thanks, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: You're welcome.",
        "Casey: You know, I'm the one who nominated Sarah to run. Is there anything in that box for me? A football uniform, cleats, a cool million?",
        "Margo: How about you settle for a piece of cake?",
        "Ben: Hey, I could go for that.",
        "Lisa: I like that. I'll help you clean up the table.",
        "Jessica: If you don't like it, we can exchange it for something else.",
        "Sarah: No, I like it. Really. Thanks again. God, I don't -- I don't get it. I mean, how can she act so nice to me after what she did?",
        "Casey: Maybe -- I don't know, maybe lying about the letters was supposed to be for your own good or something. Hey, I'm on your side, okay? I just don't see why you're obsessing about this.",
        "Sarah: Okay, listen. Jessica's big on surprises, right? You know, this dinner, this dress. Maybe that's what I'll do to her. I'll give her a nice, big surprise.",
        "Casey: Great. Let's get some dessert.",
        "Sarah: Well, don't you even want to hear what it is?",
        "Casey: It sounds like something I don't even want to know about, for my own protection.",
        "Sarah: Come on. What happened to, \"hey, Sarah, we're buds. You can tell me anything\"?",
        "Casey: I didn't think you were gonna make it your mission in life to get me into trouble.",
        "Jessica: Sarah, would you and Casey mind setting the table for dessert?",
        "Sarah: Sure.",
        "Casey: So, what's your little surprise going to be?",
        "Sarah: Something that could give Jessica a whole lot of problems. Legal problems.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh, I think you turned me in, Annabelle. I think the Mounties arrested you and you started singing like a crow.",
        "Annabelle: Not about you or any of my other clients. And I burned all my records before I went on the run. I never said a word about Cabot.",
        "Craig: All right, then how?",
        "Annabelle: Filloux had an informant. He let it slip while he was questioning me.",
        "Craig: Who was this informant?",
        "Annabelle: Do you really think a Mounties would name names?",
        "Craig: Tell me what he said.",
        "Annabelle: He was trying to trip me up and I wasn't falling for it. But then he drops the news that, \"some guy called from Oakdale, Illinois, about a baby.\"",
        "Craig: You sure he said it was a guy?",
        "Annabelle: Yeah. Because at first I thought he was talking about you, but that didn't make any sense. Why would you sell yourself out? So, Montgomery, it looks like one of your buddies back home ratted you out big time. Whoever he is, he must really hate your guts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's not polite to snoop.",
        "Carly: Who said I was polite?",
        "Paul: These papers don't concern you, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, I think they do. You asked me to design for B.R.O. And if you're planning on throwing Barbara out, not easing her out gracefully, I think I have a right to know.",
        "Paul: Okay, if you think that's what these papers say, you're wrong.",
        "Carly: Don't try to spin your way out of this one, Paul. You told me that you weren't interested in working with Barbara anymore. You didn't tell me that you were planning on taking the company from her!",
        "Paul: Want something to drink?",
        "Carly: All right. If you're not going to be straight with me, I'm outta of here.",
        "Paul: Okay, okay, okay. Look, if I confide in you, then you have to promise that you will design for me?",
        "Carly: Confide and we'll see.",
        "Paul: Yes, I am going to relieve Barbara of her company. I'm going to take possession of all of her assets, professional and personal. I'm going to make it so that Barbara doesn't have a dime to her name. So you tell me, Carly, which part of the plan do you have any objections to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: No, I got it, I got it, I got it! Here. Here's the coffee cups. You guys need any help?",
        "Casey: Nah, ma, we're cool. The problem with your plan is it seems like there's plenty that can go wrong.",
        "Sarah: No, it's easy, okay? Every time Jessica visits Bonnie in jail, she takes books and magazines and stuff with her. And all I'd have to do is slip the open letters into the pile of stuff and let the security staff at the jail find them.",
        "Casey: Great. And when you're living out on the street, because Jessica finds out?",
        "Sarah: She'll never know, okay? Look, she thinks I'm buying the whole big lie. And she's been so busy lately; she'll just assume the letters were there all along. It's perfect.",
        "Casey: And you're cool if she ends up getting disbarred or whatever?",
        "Sarah: Look, she shouldn't have lied to me.",
        "Lisa: Well, table looks very pretty. I think the two of you make quite a team.",
        "Sarah: That's what I've been trying to tell him.",
        "Casey: You want my honest opinion, Sarah?",
        "Sarah: No.",
        "Casey: Your idea bites.",
        "Sarah: Okay, but you'll keep my secret, right?",
        "Casey: Sure. That way, when you change your mind, nobody except you and me will ever know you came up with this stupid plan.",
        "Sarah: Yeah, thanks, Casey. But I'm not going to change my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Mom! You can't just come in here and start yelling at people. I mean, you don't even know what we were talking about.",
        "Susan: Oh, I heard enough to know that Kim was blaming you for having no boundaries. And something about -- not being in the bedroom?",
        "Alison: It's okay. Chris and I -- we -- Mrs. Hughes, I'm really, really sorry. Chris and I will never, ever, ever do that again.",
        "Kim: Thank you. Thank you, Alison. I appreciate that.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, see, Mom? Everything's better. Can I get you guys some tea or something?",
        "Susan: I hope that Chris gets the same lecture. After all, he's lived in this house all his life. He should be a lot more familiar with your \"boundaries\" than Alison.",
        "Kim: You're right. And Bob is speaking to him.",
        "Alison: That's what Dr. Hughes wanted to talk to Chris about? Oh, gosh. This is a nightmare. We just started kissing, and then we got a little carried away. I -- I didn't mean to cause all this trouble.",
        "Susan: Alison! Stop apologizing! This is more Chris's responsibility than yours.",
        "Kim: Nobody's blaming Alison. And you don't even know what we're talking about. We just had a little chat, and we came to an agreement, right?",
        "Alison: Mom, do you want to see my room? It's really, really nice. And you can help me unpack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Mom --",
        "Kim: Hi.",
        "Chris: Hi. Uh, Dad explained what -- I just want you to know that it won't ever, ever happen again.",
        "Kim: It's all right. It's all right. Alison has just assured me of the same thing.",
        "Chris: You spoke to Alison?",
        "Kim: Yeah.",
        "Chris: You didn't hurt her feelings, did you?",
        "Kim: I don't think so. Actually, she was very mature about the whole thing. Isn't it too bad some of that maturity doesn't rub off on her mother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So this guy in Oakdale who blew the whistle on Cabot -- Filloux didn't mention a name?",
        "Annabelle: Hey, all I know is it wasn't me.",
        "Filloux: Mr. Montgomery?",
        "Craig: Hmm?",
        "Filloux: Your credit card has cleared, and your fines have been paid.",
        "Craig: Thank you, Filloux. I just have one question for you.",
        "Filloux: Certainly.",
        "Craig: Who turned me in? Annabelle here said you were tipped off by someone from Oakdale, Illinois. Who was he?",
        "Filloux: Surely, by now, you know better than to believe anything Ms. Fettle says? Now, come, Mr. Montgomery. Let's get you on your way back to the states.",
        "Annabelle: I'm telling you the truth, Montgomery. Some guy in Oakdale set you up. You'd better figure out who has it in for you.",
        "Craig: I already know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Why are you doing this?",
        "Paul: You want a list? Barbara hated you and Emily and Rose. She had you kidnapped. She loves me and Jennifer and Will, so she's got a stranglehold on us. She is sucking the life force right out of us.",
        "Carly: You could just walk away.",
        "Paul: Well, I could. Jennifer, maybe. But Will -- no. As long as Barbara has enough money to buy and sell whoever she wants, Will will be under her thumb. He's my kid brother. He's in a psych ward. He's not even old enough to be in high school. I've got to do something.",
        "Carly: I see. And so your solution is to turn your mother into some kind of bag lady or something.",
        "Paul: Oh, no. She'll have an allowance. I just get to decide how much.",
        "Carly: Ah. As long as she plays by your rules?",
        "Paul: If I control Barbara's money, I control Barbara. And if I do this, who knows? Maybe Will will have a chance to grow up happier than I am.",
        "Carly: Don't you love your mother at all?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I think I've bared enough of my tortured soul. Now it's time for you to tell me. Are you with me, Carly, or not?",
        "Carly: Paul, you don't honestly expect me to come and work for you with all of this going on?",
        "Paul: Sure. Why not?",
        "Carly: Well -- you're kidding yourself -- about controlling your mother. When she finds out what you've done, Paul, she's gonna lose it! And I would rather not be one of the people she comes gunning after. Thank you very much.",
        "Paul: So that's it? You're just gonna turn your back on everything you've ever wanted?",
        "Carly: I -- it just isn't worth it.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on. You don't really believe that, do you? How many shots you think you're gonna get? Carly, you have admitted to me that having B.R.O. behind you would be a huge boost to your career. Our press, our distribution, our factories, our money. All you'll have to do is make beautiful designs. All you'll have to do is become the star that you were always meant to be.",
        "Carly: And step over Barbara's corpse to do it.",
        "Paul: Oh, please, Carly. Don't kid yourself. Given the same opportunity, I'm sure that Barbara would step right over yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, things seem to be going well between you and Sarah. That mean she didn't find out?",
        "Jessica: That I was lying about delivering her letters? No, no, thank goodness. I just want her to focus on things like tonight. Like good friends like Casey and being rewarded for accomplishments, like the election. You know, I just want her to be a happy kid.",
        "Margo: Looks like she's getting there. Thanks for dinner.",
        "Jessica: You're welcome.",
        "Margo: Let's go!",
        "Lisa: Okay.",
        "Jessica: Good night.",
        "Lisa: Good night. Bye-bye.",
        "Casey: Good luck.",
        "Sarah: Yep.",
        "Jessica: 'Night, case.",
        "Casey: Good night.",
        "Jessica: Thanks for coming.",
        "Casey: Thank you.",
        "Ben: Everything was terrific. I'm gonna go load the dishwasher. And you are under doctor's orders to relax.",
        "Jessica: Oh -- thank you. Thank you. So, did you have a good time tonight?",
        "Sarah: Sure. Yeah, it was great. Thanks again for the dress.",
        "Jessica: I'm glad you like it.",
        "Sarah: Jessica, when do you think you're gonna visit Bonnie again?",
        "Jessica: Oh, I don't know. Couple of days, when I can clear my court schedule.",
        "Sarah: Well, you'll let me know beforehand, right?",
        "Jessica: Sure.",
        "Sarah: And I assume you'll just bring some books and magazines, like you always do.",
        "Jessica: Is there something on your mind, Sarah? You're particularly curious tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Did your dad yell at you?",
        "Chris: I'll tell you all about it later. Susan, so nice of you to stop by.",
        "Susan: Alison left a few things behind, so --",
        "Chris: Well, you know you're welcome anytime.",
        "Susan: Hmm. I'll try to remember that.",
        "Kim: Chris, I have to get back to work. You wanna walk me out?",
        "Chris: Sure.",
        "Kim: See you later, Ali.",
        "Alison: See, it's not so bad. The bedroom's nice. And Chris is wonderful! And -- I mean, sure, we're still trying to figure out how not to get into each other's way, but it's not like they're picking on me or anything. [Susan sighs] Mom, what's wrong?",
        "Susan: Honey, I -- our house just seems so hollow since you left. Now it just seems like a big, old, empty house. And I realized that I never got a chance in all that confusion to give you and Chris an alternative to living here.",
        "Alison: Well, we have to save up to get the condo. So we can't really afford to pay any rent. So this is the only place we can afford. Where else could we stay?",
        "Susan: Alison! I have a guest room in my house!",
        "Alison: Mom --",
        "Susan: Our house.",
        "Alison: Mom.",
        "Susan: Listen, why don't you and Chris move in there? I'd give you the run of the place. I'd even move downstairs to the den if you needed more privacy. Oh, come on, honey. Why don't you just move back home? And we can work it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What's the matter, Carly? You don't think I can pull this off? Cheers.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm quite certain you can pull it off. The question is, what happens afterwards, when Barbara's out for revenge? Now, you're her sweet, little baby boy. She's just gonna get mad at you. But me? I'm gonna be shipped off to parts unknown, never to be heard from again. That's what's gonna happen to me.",
        "Paul: You know where you're gonna be? On top, where you belong, with your own blockbuster fashion line.",
        "Carly: Which I can get on my own. I've done it before.",
        "Paul: Yes. Okay, let's say you do that. Let's say you go out on your own, you don't get any help from me, and you do manage, by some miracle, to figure it all out -- all the manufacturing, all the distribution, all of the headaches. There is no way that Barbara is ever gonna let you succeed.",
        "Carly: I have a blank check, remember?",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "Carly: I think that I could possibly buy some success with that.",
        "Paul: Right, it's gonna take a lot more than money to shield you from Barbara's influence. She knows everybody. She knows all the buyers, all the critics, all the venues. And she's gonna make sure that they do everything they can to shut you down cold.",
        "Carly: I'm not gonna let you scare me.",
        "Paul: I can disable Barbara. Take away her money, I take away all of her influence. And if you do dare to go out on your own -- let's say you do. How long do you think it's gonna be before Barbara makes it job number one to make sure that you fail? Now, you can fight her one of two ways. Without me or with me.",
        "Carly: It's not gonna work, Paul. Hal's already suspicious. I saw through it myself! Nobody believes this love fest between you and Barbara.",
        "Paul: The only person that has to believe it is Barbara, and she does -- wholeheartedly. I don't care what anybody else thinks. Now, come on. I'm giving you a chance here, Carly, to get everything that you've ever wanted in your whole life and a chance to stick it to Barbara. Now, come on, this is a no-brainer. I don't know why you don't just say yes.",
        "Carly: I suppose that you would want me to keep this takeover under wraps.",
        "Paul: Oh, absolutely. This goes without saying. You tell anybody about it, my plan won't work.",
        "Carly: I can't keep secrets from Jack.",
        "Paul: So you already told Jack about my offer to bring you back to work at B.R.O.?",
        "Carly: No. But that's just because I couldn't find the right time.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. That's a secret, Carly. Come on. We dump Barbara, and you step right in with your own fashion line already prepared. You take a chance. Launch a new career. And, really, who's gonna come to Barbara's defense, anyway? Who's gonna say that Barbara doesn't deserve all this?",
        "Carly: I'd be keeping something from Jack.",
        "Paul: You are gonna have your own exclusive boutiques in New York and London and Paris. Your clothing is going to be worn by and photographed and talked about by the most famous women in the world! Jack is gonna be so happy for you, he's not even gonna remember why he was angry at you to begin with. Now, come on, Carly. You'll get everything you ever wanted. And let's say your dire predictions do come true and something does get messed up.",
        "Carly: I would -- I'd still have Rosanna's check.",
        "Paul: Yes, you would. And I think that Rosanna would be really happy to know that you and I are working together. I mean, who knows? Maybe that's what she wanted all along. I know that she hoped for you that all of your dreams would come true. Oh, come on, Carly. Say it. Tell me, tell me. Come on. Tell me you'll come on board.",
        "Carly: You had better have complete control over your mother.",
        "Paul: Oh, you can count on it. Hot pants",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: You know, I didn't mean to ask too many questions. I just -- I wanted to make sure that I have a letter ready next time you visit Bonnie.",
        "Jessica: I promise to give you plenty of notice.",
        "Sarah: Okay. You're the best, Jessica.",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "Jessica: I really hate lying to her like this.",
        "Ben: I know.",
        "Jessica: I've really grown to care about her, you know? More than I ever thought I would. Isn't it amazing how something good can come from a tragedy like this? I mean -- I think we're really gonna be okay, this \u0096 makeshift family."
