        "Brad: Watch out, that one's going in the water. Here, you need to work on your follow through. Relax, you are so tense. You need to find your center.",
        "Katie: Yes, and having your hands on my hips makes me find my center?",
        "Brad: That's better. Now you need to get that hip action going. Yes! That's got to be a hole in one! Ow!",
        "Katie: All right, that's about all the time we have for today. Thanks for watching another episode of \"Oakdale Now.\" I'm Katie Peretti.",
        "Brad: And I'm Brad Snyder. Next week, we have an exclusive interview with a rising legal star in Oakdale. She's an attorney who makes any courtroom hot!",
        "Stage manager: And we're out.",
        "Katie: Can the producers please edit out his last few ad-libs?",
        "Stage manager: I'll find out.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Brad: Why are you cutting my plug for the show?",
        "Katie: We haven't had a production meeting yet, Brad. You can't just add segments without approval.",
        "Stage manager: Katie, the director needs you.",

        "Bonnie: Yeah, I'm sure you're gonna come up with something creative.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry for bailing at Gwen and Will's hearing. How'd that go?",
        "Bonnie: We don't know yet. We hope that the court's going to rule in our favor, but --",
        "Brad: I'm sure you wowed the judge.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, thanks. But how about you? I heard about Parker's arrest. How's he doing?",
        "Brad: Not good. Not good. Jack and Carly hired Tom Hughes, we're hoping for the best. Parker's a good kid. He doesn't deserve this. I just -- I don't know. I just wish there was something I could do for him.",
        "Bonnie: Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, Brad.",

        "Customer #2: I can go somewhere else.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no.",

        "Customer #2: I ordered oatmeal and yogurt.",
        "Vienna: Exactly. Please sit down. Excuse us. What is wrong with you?",

        "Bonnie: Oh Brad, I'd love to help in whatever way I can.",
        "Brad: Trust me, you already have.",

        "Casey: You got a recommendation from my mom? When did this happen?",
        "Matt: We talked about it over breakfast. Hey, Man, we're going to be working together. I thought you'd be happy.",
        "Casey: I hate the way you're playing my parents. It's got to stop -- now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What? There's nothing wrong. You know, we've got too much pickled herring in the back. We need to have a special or something.",
        "Vienna: I thought you loved pickled herring.",
        "Henry: Well, not as much as I love you.",
        "Vienna: Oh, don't try to fool me with your kisses. Because I know when you're preoccupied. I need you to be at full attention.",
        "Henry: I'm at full attention, trust me.",
        "Vienna: Good. Because I don't want to lose another customer over spilled milk.",
        "Henry: Coffee. I spilled coffee. And you know, it doesn't matter what -- I don't need anything else. I've got you.",
        "Vienna: Ah, ha.",

        "Henry: Yeah, we're very busy right now.",
        "Gray: I'm sure you're not too busy to talk to me, Henry. Have you come to a decision?",
        "Vienna: I knew it! Something's going on. Tell the truth, Henry. Did you lose another bet?",

        "Sofie: Oh, hey. Hey, I was looking for you.",
        "Chris: Is there news?",
        "Sofie: Not yet. Not yet. I just wanted to thank you for testifying at my hearing. I needed all the help I could get, since Aaron blindsided me.",
        "Chris: I'm sorry. I know you trusted him.",
        "Sofie: Well, at least I have one friend I can count on.",
        "Chris: I'm glad you consider me a friend. I hope my testimony helps you.",
        "Sofie: I hope so, too. But waiting for the judge to make a decision, it's killing me.",
        "Chris: Well, you know, I was actually just about to take a break. Want to go for a walk in the park?",
        "Sofie: I don't know. They could call any minute with a decision --",
        "Chris: You know, cell phones work in the park.",
        "Sofie: That is the truth.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Chris: It is. So you'll go with me?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, why not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm so sorry. Here, here. I'll get you another one.",
        "Meg: No, no. No, thanks.",
        "Paul: Umm, I don't know whether you heard -- but Craig left town. He went to look for his son. I don't think he's going to find him.",
        "Meg: I guess you got your wish.",
        "Paul: Me, no. Not yet. Unless I got you back. Do I?",
        "Meg: You know what, Paul? Don't even go there. I don't want to hear it. But I am going to ask you one more favor. Stop following me.",
        "Paul: I have an errand. I'm on a coffee run. I have a list. I'm trying to make a good impression on my new employees.",
        "Meg: Well, you have an assistant who can get coffee.",
        "Paul: Yeah, we're going to run into each other, you know, at some point. It's a very small town, Meg.",
        "Meg: Why can't you just let it go?",
        "Paul: Because I can't even imagine my life without you.",
        "Meg: We've been over this, Paul. You really need to move on.",
        "Paul: What if I told you that I wasn't trying to get you back?",
        "Meg: I wouldn't believe you.",
        "Paul: Okay, what if I told you that I've made a lot of changes at Worldwide? And I've made some green initiatives and I know that's something that's really important to you. You know a lot about that, so maybe you could tell me your big ideas.",
        "Meg: Unplug your cell phone charger when not in use.",
        "Paul: See, that's great. So I'll give you an office, on a completely different floor.",
        "Meg: Paul --",
        "Paul: I'm trying. I'm trying. I just want to help you get your life back.",
        "Meg: I can get it back on my own. I don't need you to do it.",
        "Paul: So you won't even consider coming back to Worldwide?",
        "Meg: The corporate thing, it doesn't work for me. I tried it and it didn't work. And so, the answer is no. And, honestly, I'm not interested in anything you do anymore. It's over between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Feeling better?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, it's good to get out.",
        "Chris: I like to take a walk after surgery. You know, replay the procedure, think about what I could have done differently.",
        "Sofie: Oh, there are so many things I could have done differently.",
        "Chris: Hey, you're fighting for your baby. That takes guts.",
        "Sofie: You know, I really thought that giving Hallie to Gwen and Will would be the right thing. I just -- I didn't realize how much a part of me she is.",
        "Chris: Sometimes, you know, you need to give yourself a break. Take your mind off things. Tell me about yourself.",
        "[Sofie laughs]",
        "Sofie: There's not much to tell. I'm not that interesting.",
        "Chris: No, I don't believe that for one second. I know you're a mom, but not much else about you.",
        "Sofie: A mom? That sounds nice.",
        "Chris: Well, you must have lived somewhere before you came to Oakdale.",
        "Sofie: Here and there.",
        "Chris: What did you do?",
        "Sofie: Not much of anything. I worked.",
        "Chris: Okay, okay. Let me guess -- you were a -- alligator wrangler?",
        "[Sofie laughs]",
        "Sofie: Not quite.",
        "Chris: No? Okay, okay, okay. A CIA agent?",
        "Sofie: Waitress.",
        "Chris: Waitress.",
        "Sofie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Chris: No, there's more to you than that. What deep dark secrets are you hiding?",
        "Sofie: I'm not very mysterious. I don't want to bore you.",
        "Chris: You're not boring. You're not boring. Everyone has a story, Sofie. What's yours?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I got your message, what's so urgent? Is it Craig?",
        "Paul: Craig? No. No, Craig is hopefully chasing a ghost in Barbados.",
        "Emily: Yeah, and you still owe me for that. I intend to collect.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't doubt that.",
        "Emily: Okay, so where's the fire? I dropped everything to come over here. What is it?",
        "Paul: I have a proposition for you.",
        "Emily: A proposition? Okay, I'm going to leave before that gets me into trouble once again.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. No trouble, I guarantee.",
        "Emily: Well, what is it? Spit it out! I don't have all day.",
        "Paul: What's wrong with you? Did you forget to take your happy pills?",
        "Emily: No. I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at Chris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I was very young when my parents died. And my grandmother raised me. She was everything to me, she was my whole life. And when she got sick, I took care of her best I could, but I lost her, too. I wish she could have met Hallie. She would have loved her so much. And none of this would have happened.",
        "Chris: She would have been proud of you.",
        "Sofie: She would have had an opinion. And after she died, I went to live in a convent school. And the nuns were -- you know, they were nuns. They did their best. They were very kind, but it wasn't home. Then I left and I met Cole.",
        "Chris: The father of your baby.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I should have gotten out of there as soon as I had a chance. Well then, he left me when I refused to sell our baby.",
        "Chris: Then you're lucky he left.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I used to think that I couldn't make it without him.",
        "Chris: Hey -- hey, you have so much more to offer than to be with someone who abandoned you and your baby.",
        "Sofie: I know. I know it was dumb, you know, but he was literally all I had. And I never felt good about myself when I was with him. But now, for the first time in my life, I have something to hold onto.",
        "Chris: Your baby.",
        "Sofie: When I'm with Hallie it's like I'm a real person, like I'm someone who deserves to be loved.",
        "Chris: Everyone deserves to be loved.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: I like your family. Your mom offered to get me a job. What was I supposed to say?",
        "Casey: You didn't have to take her up on it.",
        "Matt: Well, I don't know the rules. I've never had a family before, okay? Not like yours. I was just trying to fit in. Maybe I pushed too hard, but I thought I was being nice.",
        "Casey: You are making me lie to my family.",
        "Matt: I'm sorry, Man. I really appreciate the job and the place to stay, okay? It's helping me get back on my feet, but if it's freaking you out, I'll leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm not jealous. Why would I be jealous?",
        "Margo: Oh, you tell me.",
        "Katie: There is nothing going on between Brad and me.",
        "Margo: Really? Are your eyes turning green?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: You know, I get the feeling Katie doesn't like me.",
        "Brad: Actually, she doesn't like me. But right now, that's a good thing.",
        "Bonnie: Really? I thought this whole thing was so she would like you?",
        "Brad: You know what? Forget about Katie. Just, right now, I want to focus on you, the most beautiful lawyer I know.",
        "Bonnie: Flattery will get you everywhere.",
        "[Bonnie laughs]",
        "Brad: Oh well, good. That's what I'm hoping for. So come on. What do you say you let me take you out, make up for blowing you off yesterday?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. I don't have anything to do. Sounds like fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Well, Gray has something on you. Henry, please, just tell me right now. It can't be that bad.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Henry: I lost the diner in a poker game.",
        "Vienna: You did not.",
        "Henry: I'm so -- I'm so, so, so, so sorry. Please, please forgive me.",
        "Vienna: You gambled behind my back when I begged you not to. How could you do this to me? To us? The diner is our baby!",
        "Henry: I thought Pepper was our baby.",
        "Vienna: No, you have to fix this right now.",
        "Henry: Maybe it's -- maybe it's meant to be.",
        "Vienna: No, how can you say that?",
        "Henry: Well look -- I won the diner in a poker game, I lost it in a poker game. Think about this, we can get on with our lives. Have some adventures. All right? You gotta admit, the routine around here has gotten pretty tired.",
        "Vienna: No, not for me. I'm happy, Henry. And I thought you were happy, too.",
        "Henry: We'll find other ways to be happy, Sweetheart.",
        "Vienna: No, no. We've created a life here, a family, with Pepper and our waitresses and our customers. This is where I want my life. Right here.",
        "Gray: Sounds like your ladylove really wants to keep the diner. So, why don't you tell her the truth?",
        "Vienna: There's more?",
        "Henry: Shut up, Gray.",
        "Vienna: Please, tell me if there's anything we can do to keep the diner? I beg you. Please, please. I'll do -- anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: My probation officer will hook me up in a halfway house for a while.",
        "Casey: Oh no, you can't do that, Man.",
        "Matt: Well, I gotta live somewhere, or else I'll get sent back to Statesville.",
        "Casey: You can't go there. Okay, you can keep living in my house, but you gotta lay off my parents. My mom's buying your little act right now, you know, if she starts getting suspicious, that would not be cool.",
        "Matt: You sure I won't cramp your style?",
        "Casey: As long as you know it's not permanent.",
        "Matt: Thank you, Man. Thank you.",
        "Alison: Don't you guys go anywhere without each other?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I want you off the premises now! Go!",
        "Vienna: No, if Gray has a way for us to keep the diner, we should hear it.",
        "Henry: No, we don't need to hear. We don't need to listen to anything he says, okay. He needs to go and you and I need to get back to work.",
        "Gray: You won't be working for long if you lose the diner, Henry. Or you could play it my way and keep the place. It's a win-win for everyone. I'm gonna give you a couple minutes to think it over.",
        "Henry: Come here. I don't want you to listen to him, all right. He -- the guy's a liar.",
        "Vienna: No, Henry, you are the liar.",
        "Henry: I'm not making a deal with the devil.",
        "Vienna: Why not? If he has an offer, I need to hear it.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. I'm not even going to entertain the possibility, all right.",
        "Vienna: This is my life, too. I think I should have a say.",
        "Henry: He said that we could keep the diner -- if you agreed to spend a night with him. Now, I told him that was completely out of the question. That you wouldn't even consider that.",
        "Vienna: Why not?",
        "Henry: You are not having sex with Gray. Listen to me, I will not allow that.",
        "Vienna: It's to save the diner.",
        "Henry: You would do that?",
        "Vienna: Yes, I would. Because this is how much I love you, Henry. I'd do anything to keep our lives the way they are right now.",
        "Henry: Some things are not for sale.",
        "Vienna: It's just my body. It doesn't mean anything. Katie had sex with Brad to get a baby. And this is -- this is our baby. And -- what's the difference?",
        "Henry: The difference is huge!",
        "Vienna: We're not married. And I had sex before I met you.",
        "Henry: Okay, I don't even want to hear about that. All right, this is not happening.",
        "Vienna: You don't own me.",
        "Henry: No, Sweetie, I don't own you, but I am in love you. And my relationship to you means a hell of a lot more to me than some stupid diner.",
        "Gray: I'm curious to hear what Vienna thinks about my proposal. Vienna, have you made up your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So how are your classes going?",
        "Matt: I temporarily dropped out. 'Cause I'm broke. But lucky for me Casey's letting me crash at his parent's house. Giving me some time to get back on my feet.",
        "Alison: Wow, you're turning out to be the regular Good Samaritan, aren't you?",
        "Casey: Oh, it's no big deal. But Matt's not going to be staying very long.",
        "Matt: Well, I gotta get out of here. So, it was good to see you, Alison. Catch you later, Case.",
        "Alison: I'm impressed. It's hard to keep up with all the nice things you're doing for people.",
        "Casey: Oh, not really.",
        "Alison: Don't be modest. I mean, you really helped out Will and Gwen with, you know, the info about the D.A. --",
        "Casey: Yeah, any good news about the baby?",
        "Alison: Not yet, they're still waiting to hear from the judge.",
        "Casey: I wish there was something else I could do.",
        "Alison: You know, I think it's time someone did something nice for you. Let me buy you breakfast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Well, now I've told you everything. So, what about you? How -- how did you become interim chief of staff at Memorial?",
        "Chris: I took over for my dad when he got sick. Not the ideal way of winning the big job. But it's over. Thank God, he's better now.",
        "Sofie: I'm sure your parents are very proud of you.",
        "Chris: They always had high expectations of me. I disappointed them a lot when I was younger. You know, but it took me a long time to get where I am.",
        "Sofie: I don't see how you could be a disappointment to anybody. I mean, you seem to have it all.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I wish. But someday I will.",
        "Sofie: I spent my entire life imagining having a real family. Maybe I'll have that with Hallie someday.",
        "Chris: You're cold.",
        "Sofie: A little.",
        "Chris: Hey, there's a vendor over there, let me buy you a hat.",
        "Sofie: No, you don't have to.",
        "Chris: You are freezing. Come on. Let's go. [Laughs] Oh, I see the perfect one for you.",
        "Sofie: What?",
        "Chris: Yes, yes, yes. Oh, beautiful.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: We're discussing the situation.",
        "Henry: No, there's nothing to discuss, all right. I have the deed. The place is yours.",
        "Vienna: Henry, can't we talk about this?",
        "Henry: No! That's my final answer.",
        "Gray: That's too bad. I would have given the diner back for one night with Vienna. It would have been worth it.",
        "Henry: Good-bye.",
        "Gray: If that's the way you want it. It's your call.",
        "Vienna: Henry --",
        "Gray: You have one week to vacate the premises.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Oh. Hey, I'm taking Bonnie out -- so unless there's an emergency, don't call, don't text, and don't worry.",
        "Katie: I have no intention of calling or any of that.",
        "Brad: Good, then nothing will interrupt us.",
        "Margo: Oh my God. You are so jealous.",
        "Katie: You want me to admit it? Fine, yeah, it bothers me to see Brad with Bonnie.",
        "Margo: Well listen, little sister, if that what you want, why don't you go after him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Uh, thanks for the offer. But maybe another time.",
        "Alison: Sure. Whatever.",

        "Alison: Yeah. No, I understand. Well, if you get any free time, give me a call.",
        "Matt: Hey, it's me. Checking in. Let me know what's next. I gotta call you back. Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey, I thought you were leaving.",
        "Matt: I was just thinking -- would you like to go out with me sometime?",

        "Vendor: Try this one.",
        "Chris: It's a little big, but it's warm.",
        "Vendor: Very warm, you should let him buy it for you.",
        "Sofie: Oh no, I am not letting you buy this hat.",
        "Chris: Okay, all right, all right. Well, hey -- huh? What about this one? Yeah.",
        "Sofie: No.",
        "Chris: Okay, let me buy you a pair of gloves then.",
        "Sofie: Okay, okay. I made one like this --",

        "Paul: So, what did Chris do now?",
        "Emily: Thank you. Oh, the usual. You know, saving lives, hitting on helpless waifs at the hospital, pretending absolutely nothing happened between us.",
        "Paul: Well really, what happened? I mean, nothing. You just -- you know, cheated on him and then tried to pin a murder on him.",
        "Emily: Does saying that to me make you feel superior, or what?",
        "Paul: You should forget about Chris. You'll do better next time.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, was that just advice? Because you got dumped, too, remember?",
        "Paul: No, no, no. That's a completely different situation. It's not like you were planning to spend the rest of your life with Chris.",
        "Emily: You don't think Meg actually would have stayed with you, do you?",
        "Paul: Meg loves me. That's never going to change.",
        "Emily: You're kidding yourself, you know that.",
        "Paul: No, I'm not. Meg is definitely coming back to me.",

        "Meg: Hey, anybody home? Mama? Holden? Damn you, Paul.",

        "Vienna: I disagree. Sex is not the same as love. What are you so worried about?",
        "Henry: I don't -- what am I -- I don't want you sleeping with another man, ever!",
        "Vienna: Its one night -- and it would save our future and everything we own. Don't ask me to give up our future. I'm doing this for you, because I love you.",
        "Henry: No, listen. This is where I draw the line, okay? Women can't have sex without feelings.",
        "Vienna: Not true. Not true. Because I had sex before you and I felt nothing.",
        "Henry: I am not sharing you with anyone else.",
        "Vienna: You wouldn't be sharing. Its one night. And it would mean nothing.",
        "Brad: What are you two lovebirds talking about?",
        "Vienna: Well, Henry lost the diner in a poker game. And the only way we can keep it, is if I spend one night with the man who won it.",
        "Henry: No man would stand for that, Brad.",
        "Bonnie: Well, from what I remember about Vienna, it's not too far from how she used to support herself back in Europe. [Bonnie laughs]",
        "[Vienna dumps oatmeal on Bonnie]",
        "Bonnie: Oh! Do you know how expensive this dress is?",
        "Vienna: Well, you deserved that ever since the ball in Edinburgh.",
        "Bonnie: The ball where you stole my escort?",
        "Vienna: You were the escort, and way overpriced!",
        "Brad: Okay, whoa, hey! As much as I love a good catfight, you two need to go to your separate corners. Yeah, you're gonna want to get out of those clothes.",
        "Bonnie: Very funny Brad. She ruined this dress. I'm going to have to buy a new one.",
        "Henry: You're going to have to forgive Vienna.",
        "Vienna: No, there is no need to apologize at all, because she deserved that!",
        "Bonnie: Henry, you're very gracious, unlike your insignificant other. Brad, I'm gonna have to take a rain check.",
        "Brad: No, I'll go with you.",
        "Bonnie: No, stay. Make sure Henry doesn't get his eyes scratched out.",
        "Brad: Henry, you've got one tough cookie on your hands.",
        "Vienna: Yes, yes, that's right! And you can tell him that he doesn't stand a chance against me!",
        "Henry: Brad, old pal, would you do me a favor and tell Vienna that she's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I am not going to go after Brad. I don't want him, I never have. I want Jack. The whole thing with Brad was just completely inappropriate. I mean, they're brothers.",
        "Margo: She doth protest so much. Why don't you just do what's making you happy and go with Brad?",
        "Katie: I don't want Brad.",
        "Margo: All right, if you don't want to be with Brad, then why do you care who he is with?",
        "Katie: I don't, I didn't. All right, I can't stand it.",
        "Margo: All right, now what are you going to do?",
        "Katie: I have no idea. I don't know what I want anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: It's just sex.",
        "Brad: There is no such thing.",
        "Henry: See? He agrees with me.",
        "Brad: Henry, stick to your guns. Give up your diner, hold onto your woman.",
        "Henry: Thank you, Brad.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but Henry, he can have the diner and the woman. But men obviously don't understand this. I'm going to talk to someone who does!",
        "Vienna: Katie, I need you!",
        "Katie: What's wrong?",
        "Margo: Oh, Vienna, I'm so glad you're here. You talk to her. I've got to go. And if you need any advice about your life, you just give me a buzz.",
        "Katie: Thank you, Margo, for listening. Again.",
        "Margo: Uh-huh.",
        "Katie: What did Henry do now?",
        "Vienna: He lost the diner.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Vienna: That's not important. I have a way bigger problem.",
        "Katie: Worse than losing the diner?",
        "Vienna: Yes, yes. Can you explain to me why American men are such prudes?",

        "Alison: You want to go out with me? Seriously?",
        "Matt: Yeah. You're hot. I'm available. What's the big deal? Unless -- do you have a boyfriend?",
        "Alison: I mean, I like to know a few things about the guy first before I date him.",
        "Matt: Oh, well maybe you can get a job here, too. Earn some good tips, we'll get to know each other better.",
        "Alison: You don't waste time, do you?",
        "Matt: With a girl as cute as you? No way.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, give me a call sometime and we can talk.",

        "Emily: What is it?",
        "Paul: Okay, you know that I've taken over Worldwide, and I want to expand the media holdings. And I want \"The Intruder\" to, from now on, be underneath the Worldwide banner.",
        "Emily: No, no. Been there, done that. Not interested.",
        "Paul: Why? \"The Intruder\" turned a good profit with worldwide backing last year. It's a no-brainer.",
        "Emily: No, do you have any idea the amount of red-tape Dusty and I went through to get out from under Craig's thumb? I'm not about to let a bunch of stuffed shirts dictate my editorial content.",
        "Paul: Fine, I will give you complete creative control. All right? I'll even expand your budget.",
        "Emily: What's the catch?",
        "Paul: There's no catch, there's no catch. It's -- it's just good business sense. Really, it's good for both of us. I've looked at the numbers.",
        "Emily: Okay -- what's up with this, 'cause it's quite a commitment.",
        "Paul: Well, it's not like you've got to busy yourself with a personal life anymore. I mean, Chris is out of the picture, right?",
        "Emily: Okay, what about you? Huh? Can you guarantee you can do business, good business, while you're still obsessed with Meg?",
        "Paul: My priorities are in order. Okay, maybe I am a little obsessed with Meg, but what's to say that Meg isn't completely obsessed with me?",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Meg: Okay, what part of \"No\" do you not understand?",
        "Meg: I thought I made it quite clear, I need you to leave me alone.",
        "Paul: Wait, hold on -- what are you talking about?",
        "Emily: Nice rose.",
        "Meg: I got that and the pathetic note at the farm.",
        "Paul: I -- I didn't do it.",
        "Meg: Okay, stop lying, all right.",
        "Paul: I'm not. Meg, I've been here since you --",
        "Meg: Okay, Paul, Paul. I know it's very hard for you, but I really need you to leave me alone.",
        "Paul: I have left you alone. You're the one who came over here and started talking to me about a flower.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? You're impossible.",
        "Paul: I didn't give you the flower.",
        "Meg: I thought I would probably get nowhere. And if you keep this up, I will end up hating you.",
        "Paul: Meg --",
        "Emily: What were you saying about not being obsessed with Meg?",
        "Paul: Shut up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Dude, I asked her out. Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Casey: Dude, you can date whoever you want. But just keep a low profile, got it?",
        "Matt: Yeah, message received, Man. What's the big deal?",
        "Casey: We're lying to my parents.",
        "Matt: Casey, chill. It's all going to work out fine, all right? And I won't say anything about, you know, where we used to bunk together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I messed up, big time, Man. But there is no going back now.",
        "Brad: You certainly did, my friend.",
        "Henry: Vienna loves this place, don't ask me why. First, I lost her money, and then her jewelry, and now her Swedish meatball palace.",
        "Brad: Henry, you're being too hard on yourself. You still got the dog. You didn't have to pawn the pooch, did you?",
        "Henry: Gray is filthy rich, but he's got a filthier mind. I don't want him or his money anywhere near Vienna, okay? I don't want Mr. Big Bucks reminding her of everything that she's lost because of me.",
        "Brad: You don't have anything to worry about. Vienna used to care about diamonds and private jets and Italian villas, but she doesn't care about that anymore. She loves being poor with you.",
        "Henry: What is she going to do without the diner, Brad?",
        "Brad: Cheer up, Henry. If anybody can make this work, you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: What's wrong with accepting his proposal?",
        "Katie: It's cheating.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not cheating. I would be saving our future.",
        "Katie: That depends on how you look at it.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. It would just be sex. I save intimacy for Henry. I'm not in love with Gray at all. I only love Henry. And it would be just like you had sex with Brad. It meant nothing to you at all, right? I mean, after all, you turned down his ring.",
        "Katie: Well, this is very different. Does Brad know about this? What does he say?",
        "Vienna: Yes, and he was of no help, because he sided with Henry. But you agree with me don't you? You think I should do this?",
        "Katie: Yeah, no -- mmm. I think I'm the last person you should ask. I mean, I thought I could separate sex and romance, but who knew? All I ended up with -- oh, a package. It's probably from a fan -- no, it's for you.",
        "Vienna: Why would someone send me something here?",
        "Katie: I bet it's from Henry. He's probably trying to make up with you.",
        "Vienna: This is definitely not from Henry.",
        "Katie: Okay, no. Read the card.",
        "Vienna: \"Just one night and you could have so much more. Gray.\"",

        "Brad: Well, you know, I gotta go hunt do n Bonnie. I owe her an expensive meal, and a, you know, brand new dress.",
        "Henry: Well, at least you can afford it.",
        "Brad: Buck up, Henry. Vienna is all yours. And no matter what, Man, she can't be bought.",
        "Henry: I hope you're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh, it's incredible! It's been so long since a man has given me diamond. I almost forgot how fabulous it makes me feel!",
        "Katie: Yeah, but you are going to give it back, right?",
        "Vienna: Are you kidding me? There's no way I'm giving this back.",

        "Margo: Hi, Guys, hi. I took some time off and got us an early lunch here.",

        "Matt: I got the job, thanks to you.",
        "Margo: Oh, excellent. You and Casey working together. Perfect.",
        "Casey: Mom, I didn't expect you to come home and throw together lunch for us.",
        "Margo: I didn't, I just went out and got it. Listen, I am just so grateful that we've got somebody here who's going to help Casey adjust being back home.",
        "Matt: I need to make a phone call. I forgot my cell in the car.",
        "Margo: Oh, okay. They didn't send any mustard. Honey, will you get the mustard?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Matt: Hey, Man, it's me. Yeah, sorry I cut you off before. It's going good. Yeah, I think it will all work out just fine.",

        "Emily: You're slipping. I mean, a rose? Kind of clich\u00e9, even for you, don't you think?",
        "Paul: It wasn't me, back off.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, if it wasn't you, then Meg has a secret admirer. But you don't mind, because you've moved on, right?",
