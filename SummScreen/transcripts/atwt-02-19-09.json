        "Kevin: It was -- it was a good turnout.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'm actually surprised you went to the memorial, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, well, I wasn't as close to Reg as you were, but I feel bad about what happened. It must be tough on the family.",
        "Noah: Yeah, his parents were shocked.",
        "Luke: So was his ex-boyfriend. I just kept thinking, he was the one that liked to party, not Reg. It's just not fair.",
        "Kevin: Can I buy you guys a cup of coffee or --",
        "Luke: Oh, come on, Kev. You hate my guts. Let's not pretend.",
        "Noah: Hey, let it go. Come on, let's go inside.",
        "Luke: Elwood, I didn't see you at the memorial. Wonder why that is.",
        "Elwood: Well, I didn't really know your friend that well. But I'm sorry about what happened to him.",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you are.",
        "Elwood: Well, I guess it's true what they say. Drugs can kill.",
        "Luke: We know, Elwood, it was you. You're the one that killed Reg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Oh my God! It's perfect!",
        "Lily: It certainly makes a statement.",
        "Jade: I didn't think you'd approve.",
        "Lily: What's the occasion?",
        "Jade: I'm trying to impress my new boyfriend.",
        "Lily: Really? When did this happen?",
        "Jade: Um, just before Valentine's Day.",
        "Lily: Well, that's great. Who's the lucky guy?",
        "Jade: Casey Hughes.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's a bit awkward. I mean, you used to date his brother, Adam.",
        "Jade: No, Adam's not in town anymore. That was a long time ago. It's not a big deal.",
        "Lily: If you say so.",
        "Jade: Can you try to at least be happy for me?",
        "Lily: Oh, I am happy for you. And Casey is going to love you in this dress. It's hot. And it's pricey.",
        "Jade: Don't worry, Lily. I'm not going to ask you to pay for it.",
        "Lily: But you're not working, Jade. How can you afford that?",
        "Jade: When I want something, I always figure out how to get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Our friend is dead because of you.",
        "Elwood: I can't believe you're starting in on me again. All right, I had nothing to do --",
        "Luke: You sold him the drugs that killed him, Elwood.",
        "Elwood: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Noah: Look, we saw you two out of Yo's. It was obvious something was going down.",
        "Luke: That's where you made the deal.",
        "Elwood: Give me a break, all right? I had a class with the guy freshman year, all right. We were just catching up, that's all.",
        "Luke: Then why did you cut out so quickly before the cops even came?",
        "Elwood: Look, I'm sorry about your friend. But I had nothing to do with it. So, don't try to pin this on me. So back off!",
        "Luke: You're a damn liar, Elwood and I'm going to prove it!",
        "Noah: Take it easy, take it easy --",
        "Kevin: You really think Elwood sold Reg the drugs?",
        "Luke: Definitely.",
        "Kevin: Did you go to the cops?",
        "Noah: We did. We don't have any evidence.",
        "Luke: They searched him, but they couldn't find anything.",
        "Kevin: Well, maybe he didn't do it.",
        "Luke: No, he did, he did. We have to prove it somehow. Is it true that Elwood's back in school?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, he just moved in. He's actually in the dorm room across from mine.",
        "Noah: Wait, how did that happen? The guy's an ex-con.",
        "Kevin: No one really knows why the administration let him back in, but he's there.",
        "Luke: Not if we can prove that he's selling drugs.",
        "Kevin: Well, if you guys -- if you guys want, I can keep an eye on him for you.",
        "Noah: Yeah, that would be great, thanks.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I'll let you know if I see anything shady. All right, I've got to get back to campus. Um, your coffee's on me, all right. All right, I'll see you guys around.",
        "Noah: Thanks.",
        "Luke: If you want, I'll keep an eye on him for you? Since when is Kevin been on our side about anything?",
        "Noah: Maybe he's just trying to help?",
        "Luke: No, no, I don't trust him. Which means we have to do this ourselves. Elwood is going to be very careful, especially on campus. He's not going to incriminate himself in front of Kevin or anyone.",
        "Noah: You're right. And now he knows we're suspicious, it's going to be tough to catch him off guard.",
        "Luke: Which means, we have to take this investigation to the next level.",
        "Noah: What do you mean?",
        "Luke: If we want to find evidence against Elwood, we have to go to his dorm and break into his room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: And you guys didn't find anything?",
        "Margo: Well, we're still waiting for the toxicology report, but it's obvious someone was dealing bad drugs.",
        "Casey: Any idea who?",
        "Margo: Your friend Luke, he thinks it's Elwood.",
        "Casey: No kidding. Really, doesn't seem the type.",
        "Margo: Yeah, but remember when he stole those manuscripts, tried to plant them on you? Maybe he was, you know, using it to take care of his drug fix.",
        "Casey: Good point.",
        "Margo: So all the time you were living in the dorm with Elwood, did you ever see him hanging out with kids that were using? Casey? Casey, are you listening to me? Are you listening?",
        "Casey: What, what --",
        "Matt: Do you want to go someplace else?",
        "Alison: This is fine. Uh, let's sit here. Oh, I'm starving.",
        "Matt: If you want hot dogs, we could just go to Mabel's.",
        "Alison: No, we're here now. May as well enjoy ourselves. Thank you. Oh, have you tried the Swedish Mac and cheese? It's amazing.",
        "Margo: Hello?",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Margo: Yeah, what, what? What's going on?",
        "Casey: Yeah, where was I? Uh, with Elwood, could Elwood be dealing with drugs? Yes, hell --",
        "Margo: No, forget about Elwood. What's going on with Alison?",
        "Casey: Nothing. Nothing is going on with her. She's not an issue anymore.",
        "Margo: Really? Is that why you're putting ketchup on your coleslaw?",
        "Casey: I wasn't -- I wasn't watching what I was doing.",
        "Margo: No, you were staring at Alison.",
        "Casey: No, there's -- there's nothing going on between -- there never even was!",
        "Margo: Okay, let me ask you something. Did this nothing going on with the relationship happen before or after you went to bed with Jade?",
        "Casey: How -- how can you bring sex into this right now?",
        "Margo: You know, there was a time when you couldn't keep sex out of a conversation when you were with Emily, so what's changed now?",
        "Casey: I knew you would find a way to always bring her into this.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm sorry, Casey, but when it comes to your choice in women, you leave a lot to be desired.",
        "Matt: So do you want coffee or a soda? Alison?",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sorry. Do you ever go online to that website that has those animals with the weird little captions? There was one today that had a hedgehog or a prairie dog or something -- but anyway, it was just hilarious, so --",
        "Matt: That's great, but I was just asking you what you wanted to drink.",
        "Alison: Oh, right, uh, whatever.",
        "Matt: Do you want me to order you a soda, then? Is that okay?",
        "Alison: Uh, sure.",
        "Matt: So, what's the name of the site?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Matt: The website with the animals.",
        "Alison: Oh, um, I forget.",
        "Matt: But it's so hysterical you randomly burst out laughing in the middle of reading the menu?",
        "Alison: Gee, I didn't know laughing was against the rules. I promise to be deadly serious from now on.",
        "Waitress: Do you know what you're having?",
        "Matt: Any ideas, Alison?",
        "Alison: You know, maybe we should sit at the counter? Do you want to move?",
        "Matt: You know, we've changed our minds. We're leaving.",
        "Alison: Oh, are you sure?",
        "Matt: Yeah, I'm positive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You know, this would look fabulous on you.",
        "Lily: You think so?",
        "Jade: Yeah, yeah, you should try it on.",
        "Lily: Okay. I'll be right back.",
        "Emily: What the hell do you want?",
        "Jade: I need you to buy me a dress.",
        "Emily: Why would I do that?",
        "Jade: Because I did what you said. Alison and Casey are done for good. Guaranteed.",
        "Emily: And you know that how?",
        "Jade: Because I know. And Alison knows it, too. She's given up on Casey.",
        "Emily: Okay, okay, keep the tags on the dress because if you're lying, it's going back.",
        "Jade: Oh, that's not all I expect from you. I expect another week's salary.",
        "Emily: Are you out of your freaking mind?",
        "Jade: Oh, and I'm -- I need my money for the weekend, so you should probably pay me by Friday.",
        "Emily: Don't push your luck, Jade.",
        "Lily: What was that all about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: We can't break into Elwood's room.",
        "Luke: Well, if the police can't find enough evidence to arrest him, it's up to us. We have to do something.",
        "Noah: That's what Casey thought. That's why he planted drugs on him. Did it work? No.",
        "Luke: Well, that's why this time we do things a little bit differently. We don't plant drugs. We just go and look for them. And I think the best place to start is Elwood's dorm room.",
        "Noah: Luke, breaking and entering is a felony.",
        "Luke: So is murder. We can't let Elwood get away with this.",
        "Noah: We're better off just asking the police to get a search warrant.",
        "Luke: Noah, if they didn't find anything on the guy when they searched him, what makes you think they're going to go into his room?",
        "Noah: Well, us going into his room is a bad idea. So unless you want to end up in jail, just let it go, okay, please? I've got to go to class. Hey, but don't -- don't do anything dumb, okay? I love you.",
        "Luke: I love you, too. I'm sorry, Noah. I have to do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, I don't know what's wrong with me today. I was kind of out of it at Al's.",
        "Matt: Yeah, because Casey was there.",
        "Alison: No, it wasn't Casey.",
        "Matt: Alison, come on. It's obvious you're not over the guy.",
        "Alison: I am not hung up on Casey. I mean, there was never anything there in the first place.",
        "Matt: Hey, I'm supposed to be your friend. So, if you can't be honest with me, at least be honest with yourself.",
        "Alison: What, you think I'm lying to myself about Casey?",
        "Matt: You tell me.",
        "Alison: I guess seeing him made me uncomfortable.",
        "Matt: Okay, that's a start. But if you're uncomfortable, there's probably a reason, and you need to find out what that is. If you're still into him, I can deal with that. As long as you don't lie to me, I can deal with anything.",
        "Alison: Fair enough. I like you, Matt. I really do. But, yeah, to be totally honest I probably do have some unresolved feelings for Casey. But I know that we just can't be together, so I have to move on.",
        "Matt: That kind of sounds like you're using me to get over him.",
        "Alison: No, I don't want to do that. The thing is though, I like hanging out with you. But I don't have everything all figured out. And I still feel confused sometimes. So, if that's going to be a problem for you then you should probably tell me now.",
        "Matt: No, there's no problem. I just needed to know where you stand.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, I am trying to forget about Casey. And I was hoping that you could help me with that. But I am really sorry that I messed up our lunch.",
        "Matt: Oh, it's nothing to be sorry about.",
        "Alison: Well, my break's almost over. So, I have to get back to work.",
        "Matt: Can I walk you?",
        "Alison: Sure. I'd like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Oh, man. Ew. Where would Elwood keep his stash? Who the heck is \"M\"?",
        "Elwood: What the hell do you think you're doing? I want this guy arrested for breaking and entering.",
        "Guard: Okay, Kid. Come with me.",
        "Luke: Thanks a lot, Kev.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Believe it or not, I do not live to make your life hard. I'm doing my job. I'm trying to find out who's responsible for killing this young man. And I need your cooperation.",
        "Casey: I told you, I don't know anything.",
        "Margo: You might know something that you don't even know that you know. Could you please concentrate, Casey? Was there anything you remember, anything unusual about the party?",
        "Casey: Not really, no. It was a typical bar. Noisy, dark, people dancing -- everyone was having a good time.",
        "Margo: And you didn't see anyone doing drugs?",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Margo: Was there anybody there that wasn't part of the usual crowd?",
        "Casey: Yes, Elwood. He just showed up, uninvited.",
        "Margo: Well, we already questioned Elwood. We didn't get anything.",
        "Casey: Well, did you search him?",
        "Margo: Yeah, we did. Why?",
        "Casey: Well, after what he did to me, it's kind of hard to trust him.",
        "Margo: I know. I don't like the kid any more than you do, but we don't have any evidence to book him.",
        "Casey: Well, you should've found some.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Casey: Nothing. You should just keep an eye on him.",
        "Margo: Well, that's his parole officer's job. I've got a case to solve here, all right?",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Margo: Now what about your friend Matt?",
        "Casey: What about him?",
        "Margo: Well, what's he been using for money since he got out?",
        "Casey: Well, he's been using the money he's got from bartending. You know that.",
        "Margo: Well, I know. I know, he hasn't had that job that long. Could he be subsidizing his income by selling illegal painkillers?",
        "Casey: You are amazing.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Casey: Bad enough you sit across from me here slamming every woman I've ever dated, now you're convicting my friend of being a drug dealer. Thanks for your vote of confidence, Mom.",
        "Margo: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: So, what you need to do is call Holden, tell him you're making a dinner reservation, then when it's time to go, you come down in that.",
        "Lily: That? That dress that I just paid too much for?",
        "Jade: Oh, whatever. Your husband's going to begging for mercy. With any luck, you won't even make it to dinner.",
        "Lily: Why are you keep changing the subject?",
        "Jade: What are you talking about?",
        "Lily: Well, you still haven't answered my question about what was going on with you and Emily.",
        "Jade: Oh, it's nothing. Really.",
        "Lily: Let me guess. She's mad about you dating Casey.",
        "Jade: You got it.",
        "Lily: So she's jealous.",
        "Jade: Oh, yeah. I mean, as much as Casey's told her, he wants nothing to do with her. She can't get over the fact that we're hooking up.",
        "Lily: Is this serious?",
        "Jade: It could be. After he sees me in this little number.",
        "Lily: Jade, can I give you some advice?",
        "Jade: About Casey?",
        "Lily: About Emily.",
        "Jade: I'm not afraid of her.",
        "Lily: Oh, you should be.",
        "Jade: Why?",
        "Lily: Emily Stewart doesn't play by anybody's rules but her own. There's no telling what that woman will do.",
        "Jade: Really? 'Cause there's no telling what I might do, either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: We never did have lunch, you know.",
        "Alison: Eh, that was my fault. And now I have to work so -- I'm probably just going to grab food from the vending machines in between handing out meds.",
        "Matt: That doesn't sound too appetizing.",
        "Alison: Yeah. What are you doing?",
        "Matt: I don't know. Maybe I'll get a ham and cheese from the cafeteria.",
        "Alison: Well, talk about unappetizing.",
        "Matt: I'll be around the building, so I can check on you later.",
        "Alison: Okay, great.",
        "Matt: Don't work too hard.",
        "Emily: Hey, Ali.",
        "Alison: Emily, what are you doing here? Mom's not working today.",
        "Emily: I didn't come to see Mom. I came to see how my little sister was doing.",
        "Alison: Well, I am fine. You could've saved yourself the trip.",
        "Emily: Oh, come on Ali, you're not still mad at me, are you? I said I was sorry. I was out of line for reading the riot act about seeing Casey.",
        "Alison: You were definitely out of line.",
        "Emily: If you want to be with Casey, that's your business. I just hope you can forgive me.",
        "Alison: There's nothing to forgive. You were right.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, it sounded like you just said I was right.",
        "Alison: Yeah. As much as I hate to admit that, but it's true. It was a mistake for me to think that I could be with Casey.",
        "Emily: Why? Oh, what happened?",
        "Alison: Well, nothing happened. Not between Casey and me anyway.",
        "Emily: Well something happened. Something got you upset, what's wrong?",
        "Alison: I shouldn't let it get to me.",
        "Emily: Ali, what made you decide you couldn't be with Case?",
        "Alison: Oh, I don't know. It was probably when I went over to his house, and saw him having sex with Jade Taylor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Noah. Thank God you got my message.",
        "Noah: I can't believe you did this.",
        "Luke: I can't believe I got caught.",
        "Noah: Why didn't you listen to me?",
        "Luke: Look, can we spare me the I told you so's? Please.",
        "Noah: Okay. Tell me what happened.",
        "Luke: Kevin happened. I knew we couldn't trust him. I was right.",
        "Noah: So, what did he do?",
        "Luke: That stuff he was saying about keeping an eye on Elwood -- total bull. Instead he called campus security and got me arrested for breaking into Elwood's dorm room.",
        "Noah: That sucks. But Luke, I did warn you.",
        "Luke: Noah, Noah, Noah, I know. Okay? Did you get me the money?",
        "Noah: Yeah, I emptied out both of our bank accounts, I just hope it's enough to bail you out.",
        "Luke: Well, they can't keep me locked up in here, can they?",
        "Noah: I hope not.",
        "Margo: Please tell me you didn't do what you're accused of doing?",
        "Luke: It's not as bad as it looks.",
        "Margo: It looks bad, Luke. It's a felony. You could be facing some serious time.",
        "Luke: You're kidding me?",
        "Margo: Let's just take a couple of giant steps back here, okay? I saw the two of you at Reg Addington's memorial earlier today. You both looked a little shaken up.",
        "Luke: Well, Reg didn't deserve to die like that.",
        "Margo: No, nobody does. But what were you doing in Elwood's dorm room?",
        "Luke: I was looking for evidence.",
        "Noah: Uh, Luke, you probably shouldn't say anything else without a lawyer.",
        "Margo: You know, I'm going to call your parents.",
        "Luke: Oh, no, no, Noah's here to bail me out. You don't have to do that.",
        "Margo: Sooner or later they're going to find out about it.",
        "Luke: No, that's totally cool.",
        "Margo: Why don't I just tell Lily what's going on? You'll thank me later.",
        "Luke: Oh --",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Luke: My parents are going to freak out. And look, look, before you say anything, I know, I brought this on myself.",
        "Noah: Luke, you wanted justice. That's only natural. But you're not a cop. You can't go around cracking cases by yourself.",
        "Luke: I know. I can't. Not while I'm arrested. But you can.",
        "Noah: No. What, no, no, no. I'm not even hearing this.",
        "Luke: Noah, Noah, please. Noah, please, hear me out. Reg was our friend. He didn't deserve to die like that. And Elwood sold him the drugs that killed him. I can't just sit back and let that happen.",
        "Noah: I feel the same way, but you're in over your head. This is going about it the wrong way.",
        "Luke: Look, I know. I know. Okay. I admit, I made a mistake. I made a big mistake. But we still have to prove that Elwood is guilty.",
        "Noah: Not by breaking the law!",
        "Luke: No, I'm not asking you to do anything illegal, Noah.",
        "Noah: I'm not doing anything, period.",
        "Luke: Okay, please, just -- just look at what I found. I found this note in Elwood's dorm room.",
        "Noah: Oh, so it's stolen property now, too. Great.",
        "Luke: Noah, Noah, Noah, it could be evidence. It could be important evidence. I need you to find out who this \"M\" is. For all we know, it's the one thing that could blow this case wide open.",
        "Noah: Luke, whatever this is that you found, whatever it means -- you've got to turn it into the police.",
        "Luke: But we don't even know what it means. How are we going to get the cops to take it seriously?",
        "Noah: Margo will.",
        "Luke: No, she won't. She doesn't have time. She's too busy booking me and calling my mom.",
        "Noah: Well, if you're not going to tell her, you've got to tell somebody else, because every time we've tried to investigate this it just leads to more trouble.",
        "Luke: No, not necessarily. Look, if this note means something, then we'll give it to Margo. But if it doesn't, no harm, no foul.",
        "Noah: This has gone too far already.",
        "Luke: Noah, please. Reg was our friend and Elwood killed him. Don't we owe this to Reg? Don't we owe him one more try?",
        "Lily: Start talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Ali, I just want to know that you're right about this. Maybe you made a mistake.",
        "Alison: Well, I will if you keep following me around at work.",
        "Emily: No, I mean, I mean about Casey and Jade.",
        "Alison: Emily, I saw it with my own eyes. And believe me, I wish I hadn't. It's an image I did not want seared into my brain.",
        "Emily: God, I don't blame you. It must have been a shock. I just -- no, I just can't imagine somebody like Jade being Casey's type.",
        "Alison: Someone like Jade? What does that mean?",
        "Emily: Nothing. Nothing. Ew, it's not even worth talking about.",
        "Alison: Well, unless you have a problem with Casey seeing her, which you obviously do.",
        "Emily: And you don't?",
        "Alison: Casey can do whatever he wants. I just don't want to have to watch.",
        "Emily: I don't blame you. Well, I guess this proves that Casey's not good for either one of us, huh?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Take it from me, you're lucky nothing ever happened between the two of you.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Lucky me.",
        "Emily: Take care of yourself, okay. Chin up. I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Will somebody please answer my question? How did this happen?",
        "Luke: Noah didn't do anything wrong. I'm the one that's arrested, not him.",
        "Noah: I was just here to bail him out.",
        "Lily: That's very kind of you. I can handle it from here.",
        "Luke: Yeah, Noah, I'll be okay. You should -- you should get back to school. I know you have things you need to do.",
        "Noah: Are you sure?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'm sure. I'll be fine, Noah.",
        "Noah: Okay. All right. Um, I'll get going.",
        "Luke: Noah, thank you -- for everything.",
        "Noah: I hope you can get him out.",
        "Lily: I'll try. You going to explain yourself?",
        "Luke: I broke into Elwood's dorm room. But only because I knew that he sold Reg the drugs that killed him.",
        "Lily: Why didn't you let the police handle this?",
        "Luke: They already took a look at Elwood. They couldn't find anything, so they let him go. It's a done deal. But I'm not okay with that, Mom. I'm not okay with letting a murderer get off the hook.",
        "Lily: Luke, this isn't your job. You can't possibly think you did the right thing.",
        "Luke: Yes! Yes, I do think I did the right thing! Reg didn't deserve to die, mom. Elwood should be in jail.",
        "Lily: And what if that doesn't happen? What if you end up in jail? How does that help anyone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Emily, this is a surprise.",
        "Emily: We need to talk.",
        "Jade: How do you like the dress you bought me? Or more importantly, how do you think Casey will like it?",
        "Emily: I should rip it off your back, you little snake.",
        "Jade: What's your problem?",
        "Emily: What's my problem? I paid you a lot of money to keep Casey and Alison from hooking up. But I never thought you would sleep with him yourself!",
        "Jade: Why are you surprised?",
        "Emily: Because you don't belong with someone like Casey.",
        "Jade: Says who? You know, Casey's a great guy, and we have a lot more going for us than you think.",
        "Emily: Oh, please.",
        "Jade: Casey needs someone who can satisfy him. I don't have to tell you, the guy likes to party -- a lot!",
        "Emily: I'm not going to stand here and compare sex notes with you about Casey.",
        "Jade: Whatever. Just give me my last week's pay, and we'll call it even.",
        "Emily: You're not kidding me. I'm not giving you another dime out of me.",
        "Jade: Oh, you want me to tell Alison that you hired me to mess up her love life?",
        "Emily: Conniving, little -- fine. This is the last time. Do you hear me? The last time.",
        "Casey: What the hell's going on in here? Why did Emily give you that money?",
        "Jade: Uh, she owed me. It's severance pay.",
        "Casey: For what? You never even worked as her assistant.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well, she hired and fired me the same day. I deserve some sort of compensation.",
        "Casey: And you went along with this?",
        "Emily: Oh, it was worth it to get rid of her. She's bad news. You should really keep your distance.",
        "Jade: Casey's not your boyfriend anymore. He doesn't take orders from you.",
        "Emily: Fine. Ignore my warning if you want. But I'm telling you, she's nothing but trouble.",
        "Casey: Emily, I don't need your advice. And I really think you should leave.",
        "Emily: Fine.",
        "Casey: I don't get it. Why is she trying to pay you off?",
        "Jade: Well, I threatened to sue her tabloid for discriminatory practices. She didn't even give me a chance to prove myself. You know, it's probably 'cause I'm not white enough.",
        "Casey: No, no way. Come on, Emily has a lot of faults, but she's not a bigot.",
        "Jade: Well, she's not going to take it to court, she knows she'll lose. You should sue her, too, for sexual harassment.",
        "Casey: I'm not going to do that.",
        "Jade: Why? She was the boss. She had all the power.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but that's when we were good together. I don't regret anything me and Emily had.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well, now it's over, and she's still runs a tabloid and you're cleaning bathrooms at a hospital.",
        "Casey: Jade, Jade, I'm not going to sue Emily. So drop it.",
        "Jade: Okay. Someone has a soft spot for the Stewart sisters.",
        "Casey: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Jade: Just an observation.",
        "Casey: [Scoffs]",
        "Jade: What's wrong?",
        "Casey: I got to go. I got to get to work.",
        "Jade: Well, we have a date tonight. That's why I bought this dress. Do you like it?",
        "Casey: Yeah, you look great.",
        "Jade: But we can hit the clubs, go dancing. I thought that's why you came over.",
        "Casey: Actually, I came here to tell you I'm busy tonight. I'm not going to be able to go out with you. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke, I will do what I can to get you out of here.",
        "Luke: Thank you. I know you don't agree with what I did. But I still think I did the right thing.",
        "Lily: Luke, I just wish that you would understand someday that when you take risks with your life, you're not the only one that gets hurt. Margo, there were some extenuating circumstances here. Luke was so torn up after his friend's memorial service, I really don't think he knew what he was doing.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, that's no excuse.",
        "Lily: I know. But I'm asking you as a mother. Can you please give my son another chance?",
        "Margo: Lily, nobody knows better than I what it's like to watch your son be prosecuted. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, but it's out of my hands. If Elwood decides to press charges, Luke is going down for arraignment.",
        "Lily: Can we at least get him out on bail?",
        "Margo: Well, that's up to the judge to decide. Elwood, well, you're right on time.",
        "Elwood: Well, I wouldn't keep you waiting, Lt. Hughes.",
        "Lily: Margo, do you mind?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Lily: Elwood, I'm Luke's mother. I'm not excusing what he did. Luke was just so distraught over the death of his friend. I just hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive him for this mistake.",
        "Elwood: Believe me, I understand mistakes. I've made more than my share. So -- I'm willing to give Luke the benefit of the doubt. As long as he makes a full apology.",
        "Luke: Forget it. That's never going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: Noah, hey.",
        "Noah: Sorry, sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. Do you know where Casey is?",
        "Alison: Uh, I don't know.",
        "Casey: Not that you care either way, am I right, Ali?",
        "Alison: Yeah, he's all yours.",
        "Casey: What's going on, man?",
        "Noah: Luke got arrested for breaking into Elwood's dorm room. He was looking for evidence.",
        "Casey: Wait, and Luke got arrested?",
        "Noah: Yeah. Elwood caught him and now Luke could be prosecuted.",
        "Casey: Great. Great, my mom is obsessing over this case, too bad she's looking for the wrong guy.",
        "Noah: Do you think you could do us a really big favor?",
        "Casey: Yeah, just tell me what.",
        "Noah: Luke found this in Elwood's room.",
        "Casey: \"Got you covered, M.\"",
        "Noah: I know you were Elwood's freshman roommate. Do you know who is \"M\" person could be?",
        "Casey: I could check it out. I'll get back to you. Okay, man?",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Noah: Thank you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke, you're making this worse.",
        "Luke: I have nothing to say to him.",
        "Elwood: You broke into my room.",
        "Luke: You're the one who killed Reg.",
        "Elwood: I did not give him drugs.",
        "Lily: Listen to me. Elwood is trying to be reasonable. He's giving you another chance.",
        "Luke: Mom, he's a liar and a drug dealer.",
        "Elwood: That's actually not true because there's no evidence against me. Isn't that right, Lt. Hughes?",
        "Margo: That's right, Luke.",
        "Lily: Just apologize so you can go. Do it now so we can get out of here.",
        "Luke: I can't.",
        "Noah: People are trying to help you, Luke. Standing by your principles is getting you nowhere. Meanwhile, everyone you care about is running around in circles. It's not fair. And you know it.",
        "Luke: Fine. Elwood, I'm sorry I broke into your dorm room. But I still think that you gave the drugs to Reg that killed him and I'm going to do everything I can to prove it.",
        "Noah: Luke, not helping.",
        "Elwood: It's okay. I'm not scared of him. Luke, you can investigate me for the rest of your life, but you're not going to find anything. I'm not going to press charges. It's not worth it.",
        "Margo: Good. Great, then you're free to go.",
        "Lily: Elwood, thank you so much. You don't know how much this means to me.",
        "Elwood: Someone had to do the right thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Matt, what are you doing in here?",
        "Matt: Nothing. I was just looking for Alison.",
        "Casey: Man, this is where they keep all hospitals medicine. Can you read the sign on the door? \"Hospital personnel only.\"",
        "Matt: I must've missed it. Have you seen Alison around?",
        "Casey: No, I haven't seen her in a while. Have you checked the nurses' station?",
        "Matt: Oh, yeah, I will. I was thinking she might want to go to Yo's to get something to eat.",
        "Casey: Yeah, knock yourself out.",
        "Matt: Later, man.",
        "Casey: \"M\". As in Matt?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, that note, did you figure out what it was about? Did you find out who that \"M\" was?",
        "Noah: I have no idea. I gave it to Casey. I was hoping he could figure it out.",
        "Luke: Well, does he have any ideas?",
        "Noah: Not offhand. But he'll think about it.",
        "Luke: Noah, we need to do more than just this.",
        "Noah: Why can't you let this go?",
        "Luke: Because I am more sure than ever that Elwood is guilty. That fact that he didn't press charges proves that he has something to hide.",
        "Noah: It doesn't prove anything.",
        "Luke: Yes, it does, Noah! He would love to see me behind bars. But he didn't want the cops involved because he was afraid that they would turn over some rock and find something they didn't expect.",
        "Kevin: Luke, I'm glad you're out.",
        "Luke: Yeah, no thanks to you.",
        "Kevin: It wasn't my idea to turn you over to security. When Elwood called me and told me somebody broke into his room, I never thought I'd find you there.",
        "Luke: Well, you should've suspected something.",
        "Kevin: I wish I did. Look, I seriously want to help you guys. And I'll keep watching Elwood, let you know if anything's out of line.",
        "Noah: Thanks, Kevin.",
        "Kevin: Look, if he's dealing, he needs to be stopped. I don't want to see anyone else get hurt.",
        "Noah: You know, I actually think he meant that.",
        "Luke: You haven't known him for as long as I have.",
        "Noah: I don't understand you. Why are you being so paranoid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Thank God I made it home before the kids got back.",
        "Jade: Where were you?",
        "Lily: At the police station. Luke got arrested. He was lucky, Margo let him go this time.",
        "Jade: What did he do?",
        "Lily: He broke into Elwood's room trying to get evidence. He could've gone to jail.",
        "Jade: Right, but the guy who's selling drugs is running free. God, you've got to love the justice system.",
        "Lily: Oh, Luke is taking this way too far. He won't listen to me. You know what, he would listen to you. Will you talk to him?",
        "Jade: It's kind of hard to change Luke's mind when he thinks he's right.",
        "Lily: You could try. Look at you, so beautiful in your dress. Do you have a date with Casey?",
        "Jade: I did. He cancelled.",
        "Lily: Oh. All dressed up and no place to go. I hate that.",
        "Jade: You know what, I do have someplace to go. I'm going to put this dress to good use.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Kevin could've stayed out of this whole thing. But he chose to get involved. I think that means his heart's in the right place.",
        "Luke: I don't know. Maybe I'm just suspicious of everybody at this point.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, being paranoid can make you do some dumb things.",
        "Luke: Wanting Elwood to get what he deserves isn't dumb.",
        "Noah: No, it's not. But let the cops handle it. Please. One person already died, I don't want you to be next.",
        "Luke: Noah, let's not be dramatic.",
        "Noah: Hey, if Elwood really did do what you think he did, he's a pretty dangerous guy. We don't know what he's capable of.",
        "Luke: Look --",
        "Noah: I can't lose you!",
        "Luke: Noah, I am going to be fine. But Reg was our friend. He was one of us. And I don't want anyone to think for one second that his death didn't mean anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You're a hard man to track down.",
        "Casey: Jade, what are you doing here?",
        "Jade: I thought I'd come for a visit.",
        "Casey: This room is off-limits, you know that.",
        "Jade: Good. Then no one will disturb us.",
        "Casey: I'm supposed to be working.",
        "Jade: Don't you at least get a coffee break?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I do later, and --",
        "Jade: Then let's take full advantage.",
        "Casey: Sorry, um, I have to go.",
        "Jade: Go where?",
        "Casey: Something important just came up.",
        "Jade: What is wrong with you?",

        "Matt: To our first official date.",
        "Alison: Well, it's kind of early in the day to call it a date. And it's not like we can go anywhere. I'm on a break between shifts. So --",
        "Matt: Then to just enough time for lunch.",
        "Alison: It's kind of refreshing, isn't it?",
        "Matt: You can't be talking about the soda.",
        "Alison: No, I'm talking about dating without the drama. I like it. It's relaxing.",
        "Matt: Sure. Just as long as you don't fall asleep on me.",
        "Alison: Well, if I keep working these doubles, that might actually happen.",
        "Matt: Well, as long as I'm not the one putting you to sleep.",
        "[Ali laughs]",
        "Matt: See, now that's a good sign.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Matt: The girl laughed at the boy's jokes. We all know what that means.",
        "Alison: She likes him?",
        "Matt: Yup. Pretty soon she's going to be finishing his --",
        "Alison: His sentences?",
        "Matt: Get that girl a prize!",
        "Alison: Oh, how about a stuffed panda? I like pandas.",
        "Matt: I don't have one on me.",
        "Alison: So, what can you give me instead?",
        "Matt: How about this?",
        "Alison: Who's winning this prize, exactly?",
