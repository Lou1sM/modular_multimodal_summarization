        "Henry: That's it. From now on, you are watching comedies only.",
        "Katie: Turn it back on, Henry.",
        "Henry: Why? So you can sob your way through another box of tissues? Hmm? Devour another gallon of ice cream? Actually, that doesn't so sound bad. But it's the crying, Katie. The crying has to stop. Okay?",
        "Katie: Go away. I don't need your help.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Henry: No, you're a classic. I see a new hairstyle just around the corner.",
        "Katie: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Henry: It means you've done everything -- everything that a woman does to try to forget a man. And nothing has worked. You're still hung up on mike.",
        "Katie: So I'll get over it.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Henry: Call him. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Dr. Hughes? I got a message you wanted to see me.",
        "Bob: Oh, yeah. Thanks for coming by, mike. Listen, the hospital board has approved an expansion for the emergency room. And we'll be accepting construction bids very soon. And I was hoping that you'd submit one.",
        "Mike: Oh, thanks for the offer, but I'm afraid I'm not gonna be around to take advantage of it.",
        "Bob: Are you taking a vacation?",
        "Mike: No, I'm leaving Oakdale for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Who was that?",
        "Chris: My accountant. He's helping me with the mortgage application for the condo.",
        "Alison: And?",
        "Chris: And he ran a credit report on you, Alison.",
        "Alison: And let me guess. I flunked with flying colors?",
        "Chris: Pretty much.",
        "Alison: Well, I didn't used to be so responsible about money.",
        "Chris: He said you owed one credit card company over $300 for the last two years.",
        "Alison: Is it really that much? Well, it was my first credit card. And there was a lot of things that I needed.",
        "Chris: Great.",
        "Alison: But we're still going to get the condo, right? I mean, it's all I keep thinking about.",
        "Chris: And it's all I can think about, too. Alison, I can't wait to live there with you.",
        "Alison: So then it's all going to work out?",
        "Chris: I'm sure we'll think of something.",
        "Alison: Okay. I knew that you could fix it. Will you call me and let me know how it went?",
        "Chris: Sure. You going somewhere?",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah. I just have to run some errands. But -- I'll see you later.",
        "Chris: Okay.",
        "Kim: Hey, how's your application going?",
        "Chris: Uh, not too bad.",
        "Kim: Is there something wrong?",
        "Chris: No, no, it's fine. Alison's credit isn't the best. We may end up paying a higher interest rate.",
        "Kim: Ooh. You know, why don't you try talking to the mortgage broker?",
        "Chris: Well, Phil's doing that later today, Mom. Don't worry. It's gonna work out.",
        "Kim: Listen, I know that you and Alison are really excited about this move. And, actually, I don't blame you, because it is exciting. When you're happy, then I'm happy, too. But while you're busy being happy, don't forget to throw in a little common sense, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Answering machine beeps]",
        "Paul: Carly, it's Paul. Give me a call when you get this. I'd like to finish the conversation we started yesterday. [Answering machine beeps] Carly, it's Paul again. Just wondering if you got home yet.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: My, you are quite the persistent -- it's you. If this is some kind of social call, I'm really not interested in being social with you.",
        "Craig: Now, easy, easy. Canada wasn't fun.",
        "Carly: No. Being thrown in jail never is.",
        "Craig: I saw Cabot.",
        "Carly: That must've been tough.",
        "Craig: No. It's great. I think his birth mother will really take good care of him.",
        "Carly: Did you harass her, Craig? Is that why you wound up in jail?",
        "Craig: Well -- I did slightly misjudge her attachment.",
        "Carly: Right. You offered her money to get him back.",
        "Craig: Oh, I offered her a lot more than that, believe me. But she freaked and called the police. Which is why ended up behind Canadian bars. All thanks to your new buddy, Paul Ryan.",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Craig, Paul is not the one who tipped the police about Cabot.",
        "Craig: Why? Because he's such a nice guy?",
        "Carly: No. Because he cares too much about Rosanna.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Yeah, hi, Rosanna. Listen, I know you probably want to be left alone. But if you change your mind, and you feel like company, please let me know. And I'm looking in on Lucy, like you asked. I check up on her as much as I can. So -- I guess that's it. I miss you. And I hope to hear from you soon.",
        "Barbara: Was that Rosanna?",
        "Paul: Yeah. I was leaving her a message.",
        "Barbara: Ah. I really feel very badly for her. Losing a child that she'd thought was her own. It's very tragic.",
        "Paul: Well, I'm glad to hear you have sympathy for her.",
        "Barbara: I do. I'm also glad that she's left town.",
        "Paul: Why's that?",
        "Barbara: Because she's Craig Montgomery's wife, and yet she's become very dependent on you. And that can only lead to trouble --",
        "Paul: Okay, stop it! Just stop it, mother. Don't you ever talk to me like that again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I can't believe they're letting this Clark guy get away with this. I mean, come on. Anybody that puts a drug in a girl's drink -- I swear -- you know what? Somebody needs to take this punk to school. That's what needs to be done.",
        "Curtis: I'll hold him down for you, buddy. Just let me know.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, I wish. But unfortunately it's not happening. Lucy doesn't want me protecting her anymore.",
        "Alison: Hey! Hi, Curtis. Can we talk for a second? It's kind of important.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Hey, Curtis, I'm on break. What's going on?",
        "Alison: Guess where I'm living.",
        "Aaron: Ah -- I give up.",
        "Alison: No, c'mon. Just guess.",
        "Aaron: With Chris.",
        "Alison: I wanted it to be a surprise.",
        "Aaron: Well, you told me to guess, Ali.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but you didn't have to be right.",
        "Aaron: Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, so, where did you guys find a place?",
        "Alison: Well, we're living at his parents' right now, but not for long. 'Cause we're buying a condo! But it won't be ready for a couple of months.",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What do you mean condo? Where'd you find the money to buy a condo?",
        "Alison: Well, most of its Chris'. But I chipped in some.",
        "Aaron: Wow, that's good. So you guys aren't wasting any time, huh? That's good.",
        "Alison: Well, I know that we're moving fast. But we really want to concentrate on our future. And that's why you and I -- we really have to get moving on that annulment, you know?",
        "Aaron: Right. Well, you said I was gonna be getting some papers or something, right?",
        "Alison: Yep, you know, I've got them right here. And all you have to do is sign them and get them notarized.",
        "Aaron: Okay. All right. Done.",
        "Alison: I know that you don't like Chris, but --",
        "Aaron: No, come on, Ali. That's not what I'm thinking. Please don't try to get into my head right now.",
        "Alison: Isn't that what a friend's supposed to do?",
        "Aaron: Alison, I'm very glad everything worked out for you. And I hope that you and Chris stay together for a very long time. Okay, but right now, it's a very tough time for me. All I want is another shot with Lucy, and she doesn't want me anywhere near her.",
        "Alison: That's terrible. Aaron, I'm sorry.",
        "Aaron: Well, that's not the worst part. The other night at metro, that party? Yeah, Lucy almost got raped, and I'm the one that let it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I know it's kinda early for lunch, but then you didn't have any breakfast.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, I'm not hungry, but thanks for thinking of me.",
        "Kim: Honey, I know you're in a hurry --",
        "Chris: And I know what you're going to say.",
        "Kim: About the condo --",
        "Chris: Right. You don't think I should buy it. But you know what, Mom? It's not your decision -- and it's what Alison and I want to do.",
        "Kim: And I realize that, and I respect it. But, son, buying property together is a really serious business. And you need to ask a lot of questions, and I'm not really sure that's what you're doing.",
        "Chris: Well, if I haven't asked them -- I'm sure my accountant has.",
        "Kim: Yeah, but the thing is, you have to fill in some of the blanks for him. For instance, how are you going to pay for the mortgage? Are you gonna have a joint account? Are you gonna have separate accounts? Who's gonna pay for your furniture? You need that. Your food, clothes, your utilities -- are you gonna split it down the middle?",
        "Chris: Okay, Mom, stop. All right, Alison and I haven't figured out all the details yet, but it's gonna be fine. We'll just figure it out as we go along.",
        "Kim: Have you and Alison decided to get married?",
        "Chris: I don't know, Mother. We haven't discussed it yet.",
        "Kim: Christopher, let me tell you something about women. As a rule, they see marriage as a good thing. And even though they don't say anything about it --",
        "Chris: Okay, Mom, time out here. You want me to tell you where Alison and I are gonna be in ten years?",
        "Kim: Yeah.",
        "Chris: I can't, okay? I can't do that. But what I can tell you is that we are committed to each other, and that's important, at least to us.",
        "Kim: And I can tell you that I know without a doubt in my heart that you and Alison really do care for one another, a lot. But that's still not a reason -- a good enough reason to buy property together.",
        "Chris: You want me to back out of this condo?",
        "Kim: Chris --",
        "Chris: I'm not gonna do it.",
        "Kim: That's not what I'm suggesting -- will you stand still and listen to me for a minute? I am trying to suggest that instead of letting Alison's bad credit ruin yours, you buy the condo yourself. And, if necessary, your dad and I will help financially. Then, after you and Alison are more certain of your future, you can refinance. You can pay us back, and you can put the property in both of your names.",
        "Chris: Mom, that's not how I want to do it.",
        "Kim: You'll still be together. I mean, it's just a little protection for you. Is that such a bad idea?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mom, I'm sorry I flew off the handle like that. I think maybe we need some ground rules. Subjects that we can discuss and then other subjects that are off limits.",
        "Barbara: Sure, honey. Whatever you want.",
        "Paul: My personal life -- no advice, okay? No opinions. What I do after work has got nothing to do with you.",
        "Barbara: I only brought up Rosanna because --",
        "Paul: I don't want to know what your reasons were. I -- the business, my immediate family, that's it. Nothing else is open to discussion.",
        "Barbara: Okay, if that's the way you want it, that's the way it'll be.",
        "Paul: Great. So, anything specific you wanted to talk about concerning B.R.O.?",
        "Barbara: Actually, I was on the phone with Paris this morning. I talked to Henri. He said you had fired our accountant.",
        "Paul: That's right.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I don't understand. Giselle has been with me for over ten years.",
        "Paul: Giselle was duplicating the work of a new software program I just installed. She was costing us money we don't need to spend.",
        "Barbara: Don't you think you should've consulted with me first?",
        "Paul: When you asked me to be a part of B.R.O., You said that I would take care of the business and you would look after all the design elements. Now, has anything changed since then?",
        "Barbara: No, but I just --",
        "Paul: Great, then what's the problem? Unless you've stopped trusting me. I mean, that's a possibility.",
        "Barbara: Oh, no. Of course I trust you. I trust you more than anyone else on this entire earth.",
        "Paul: Great. Then you get back to your sketch pad, and I'll take care of everything else.",
        "Barbara: Well, I have some wonderful ideas for summer. I think you'll be very pleased.",
        "Paul: You see now, that's great, Mom. I can't wait to see them. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Barbara: Bye.",
        "Paul: Bye. I've got some ideas for you, too, Barbara. But I don't think you're going to be happy with them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I saw Annabelle Fettle in jail. She said she wasn't the one who turned me in.",
        "Carly: And you believed her? Craig, the woman is a baby snatcher.",
        "Craig: She got it from the detective assigned to the case. He said a man in Oakdale called the Mounties about Cabot.",
        "Carly: I repeat -- Annabelle Fettle is not a reliable source.",
        "Craig: Well, why would she turn me in? It only makes things worse for her.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe it was somebody else. Just not Paul.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Craig: But, listen, poor little rich boy blames his excruciating life on everybody but himself. He still blames me for his mother. Not to mention the Rose murder fiasco. No, he thought he saw a way to get to me, and he took it.",
        "Carly: There's just one problem with your little theory, Craig. And that is that Paul did not know that Cabot's adoption was illegal, unless you told him yourself, which I seriously doubt.",
        "Molly: You must talk Dusty out of testifying against me. Then the charges get dropped.",
        "Craig: And in return?",
        "Molly: In return, Ii forget that I know anything about you helping the cops have a strong case against Paul Ryan. Or anything about you having an involvement with Annabelle Fettle, \"black market baby broker.\"",
        "Craig: Oh, no, it's him.",
        "Carly: You're looking for a scapegoat, Craig. Somebody to blame besides yourself.",
        "Craig: Listen, Carly, I knew what I did wasn't exactly squeaky clean, but I never knew it was illegal. All right? Paul Ryan caused us to lose that baby. My new son. So you, you smell whatever perfume you want. I'm gonna prove he did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Put the phone down, Henry. I am not calling Mike.",
        "Henry: All right. How about a singing telegram?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Henry: Okay, e-mails? Smoke signals? I don't care. Katie, you have to make contact.",
        "Katie: I wouldn't even know what to say.",
        "Henry: \"Hello.\"",
        "Katie: Hello?",
        "Henry: Hello. Hello. That's all you have to say. And then, nature will take its course and you two will never have to say good-bye to each other again.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Katie: As long as Simon's out there, I can't get involved with anyone else.",
        "Henry: Katie, Simon's gone for good. All right? And Mike, on the other hand, never left.",
        "Katie: I know. But I can't -- I made my decision. I'm sure Mike already feels jerked around enough. It wouldn't be fair for me to go back on my word.",
        "Henry: Do you still love him?",
        "Katie: It doesn't matter.",
        "Henry: It's the only thing that matters. Life without love is -- well, you're looking at it.",
        "[Henry chuckles]",
        "Katie: I have to go.",
        "Henry: Where?",
        "Katie: I'm going to the hospital. I have to pick up my check. Thank you, though, for trying. But Mike and I -- what we had was amazing. But it's finished. See ya.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "[Henry whistling]",
        "Henry: Hello, Mike? Hey, thank God! It's Henry. Henry Coleman.",
        "Mike: Hey, Henry, something wrong?",
        "Henry: It's the water heater at Katie's cottage. Man, I think it's gonna explode.",
        "Mike: How can you tell?",
        "Henry: Um -- well, it's -- [Henry coughing] It's hard to see because of all the smoke.",
        "Mike: All right, all right. I'm on my way.",
        "Henry: All right. How do you break a hot water heater?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: I knew there was something wrong with Lucy, you know, when I went to try to talk to her. And then Clark comes along, you know, telling me to -- being all possessive, telling me to get away from his date and being completely stupid. And then Molly comes by, tells me to go back to work. So, I can't believe I let her leave with that clown. I cannot believe it.",
        "Alison: Well, he drugged her, Aaron. What were you supposed to do?",
        "Aaron: Well, I could've said no to Molly. You know, but instead I backed out. I backed out. I swear, if it wasn't for Paul Ryan, I can't even imagine -- you know, I can't even think about this right now.",
        "Alison: No, Aaron, don't blame yourself. Seriously, I mean, you already just said that Lucy was angry with you. She would've probably just sent you back inside.",
        "Aaron: Maybe. You know, if I wouldn't have messed up so bad in the first place, she would've never ended up with that jerk.",
        "Alison: You're never gonna stop wanting her, are you?",
        "Aaron: I don't think so.",
        "Alison: Well, then maybe I should talk to her.",
        "Aaron: It's not gonna work. I think Lucy's made up her mind.",
        "Alison: Well, minds get made up, and then they get changed. I mean, Chris and I, we were so not happening, and now -- right now, it's the best time in my life.",
        "Kim: Hi, Curtis.",
        "Curtis: Afternoon, Mrs. Hughes. May I show you to a table?",
        "Kim: Thank you. That would be very nice. This is my friend, Mrs. Leonard.",
        "Curtis: Pleasure. All right, follow me.",
        "Kim: Thank you.",
        "Alison: A lot of what happened between you and Lucy is because of me. And the least that I can do is try to help you guys get back together.",
        "Aaron: You think she's gonna listen to you? After you lied about me getting you pregnant? Come on, Alison.",
        "Alison: Well, then, maybe that's the way that I can start. A full confession and a full apology.",
        "Aaron: It's not gonna work.",
        "Alison: But, Aaron, did you forget about how convincing I can be?",
        "Aaron: Then what?",
        "Alison: I'll, you know, try to show her what she's missing. And tell her that finding someone after you've been missing them for so long, it's like the best feeling you can have. And she would be crazy to walk away from it, especially with a guy like you.",
        "Aaron: I don't -- I don't want her to think that I sent you.",
        "Alison: No, she won't. I promise.",
        "Aaron: What did I do to deserve you, Ali?",
        "Alison: You mean that in a good way, right?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Diane: Everything okay? Thank you.",
        "Alison: Chris's mother's over there. Do you think that she saw me?",
        "Aaron: Probably.",
        "Alison: I should probably go and say hello. Well, isn't this a coincidence?",
        "Kim: I'll say. I'm sorry. Alison Stewart, this is my friend, Mrs. Leonard.",
        "Diane: How do you do?",
        "Alison: It's nice to meet you.",
        "Kim: I noticed you were with Aaron Snyder.",
        "Alison: That's why I'm here. I had annulment papers from our marriage for him to sign.",
        "Kim: Are you still friendly with him now?",
        "Alison: Well, yeah. Aaron's a great guy.",
        "Kim: He's also the guy who tried to put my son in prison.",
        "Alison: Only because he thought that Chris was to blame for my accident.",
        "Kim: And then he admitted that wasn't true, didn't he? After weeks of insisting that he was telling the truth.",
        "Alison: Look, I really don't need you lecturing me about Aaron. He's a really great friend, and he's going to stay my friend, whether you like it or not.",
        "Kim: You know, Diane, I really don't like the atmosphere in here today. Let's go. Thank you.",

        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Paul: Finally. I was starting to think maybe you ran away.",
        "Carly: Oh, hi, Paul. I'm sorry; I was just about to call you.",
        "Paul: With some good news.",
        "Carly: You want a decision on the spot about whether I'm coming to B.R.O.?",
        "Paul: Yeah. You're not going to make me beg, are you? Okay, fine, you can't see me right now, but I'm begging. I'm on my hands and knees, and I'm begging you. It's okay. I'm not proud. Just tell me that it's working.",
        "Carly: You know, before I make a decision, there's a question that I need to ask you.",
        "Paul: Shoot.",
        "Carly: In person.",
        "Paul: Okay. Lakeview lounge, 25 minutes?",
        "Carly: I can't. I don't have a sitter. Is there any chance you could come to my place?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Paul: Let's cut to the chase. What is it you wanted to ask me?",
        "Carly: Did you have anything to do with Rosanna losing her son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I can't believe you would even ask me that question, Carly. I thought you knew me better than that.",
        "Carly: It's not an accusation. It's an honest question. And I'd like an answer. Did you have anything to do with --",
        "Paul: Oh, you mean did I go to Canada and illegally adopt a baby? Oh, no, that was Craig. Or did I lie to Rosanna when she asked me how the adoption could have happened so quickly? Oh, no, no, no, that was Craig, too. Or after the baby had been here for a while and Rosanna had fallen in love with Cabot -- you think that I was the one who lied to Rosanna when she asked, over and over again, if there was anything she needed to know about this adoption. You'd be wrong about that, too, Carly. Because that, too, was Craig.",
        "Carly: Okay, I see your point.",
        "Paul: There's only one person responsible for Rosanna losing Cabot, and that's Craig. The responsibility begins and ends with him.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry if I offended you.",
        "Paul: Well, you did insult me a little bit. What Craig did to Rosanna is beyond cruel. And for you to even think that I'm on the same level --",
        "Carly: Oh, give me a break! You're not exactly a boy scout, yourself. I was there, Paul, at your wedding to Rose.",
        "Paul: This has nothing to do with that.",
        "Carly: No, it doesn't. Not directly. But it did show me and everybody else in this town, for that matter, how far you are willing to go for revenge.",
        "Paul: Oh. So, before you even asked me that question, you had already decided that I was guilty?",
        "Carly: I didn't say that.",
        "Paul: Well, I guess it makes sense. I mean, Craig tried to frame me for murder. So, naturally, I tried to take his kid away from him. There's only one problem with that thinking. It's -- Cabot has a mother, too. And I would never do anything like that to hurt Rosanna.",
        "Carly: And that's what I thought.",
        "Paul: I don't even know why you started this conversation.",
        "Carly: Craig was just here. And he seems convinced that you're the person who told the police about Cabot.",
        "Paul: He's trying to absolve himself of all guilt. I thought that would be obvious to you.",
        "Carly: No, it is. I hope you understand. I had to ask. I can see that I was wrong. And we don't ever have to discuss it again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: That didn't take long. [Knock at door] Mike! Thank God you're here! Thank you!",
        "Mike: What happened to you?",
        "Henry: I tried to fix the water heater myself. And I was not born to plumb, obviously. So, yes, take that off. You don't want to get that leather wet.",
        "Mike: Where's all the smoke?",
        "Henry: Oh, it stopped. And I opened the window. So I guess it just --",
        "Mike: You turned off the water heater, right?",
        "Henry: Was I supposed to? Now, that should keep him busy for a while. Now all we have to do is wait for Katie to get home. Man!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Katie? You got a minute?",
        "Katie: Yeah, sure. Oh, if this is about that patient in 419 -- I never told her she could get out of bed.",
        "Bob: Relax. Mrs. Rollins has blamed everyone in this hospital for her fall, except you. No, I was going to ask you to do me a favor.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'll do my best.",
        "Bob: Talk to Mike Kasnoff about staying in Oakdale.",
        "Katie: What did he tell you?",
        "Bob: Well, I asked him to submit a bid on the construction for the emergency room expansion. And he said he was not available. That he was leaving town. For good.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, you know Mike. He can be very impulsive.",
        "Bob: Yeah, so I gather. You know, he did a great job on the burn unit. And it would make my life a lot easier if he would do the emergency room, as well.",
        "Katie: Well, you know you could talk to Ben Harris. They're very good friends. I'm sure he'd be willing to have a talk with Mike.",
        "Bob: And you would not?",
        "Katie: Well -- it's kind of hard to explain, Dr. Hughes. In fact, I can't even explain it myself. But Mike and I, we're just -- I can't. I'm sorry. I can't help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Mrs. Hughes? Can we please talk about this?",
        "Kim: What could there possibly be to say?",
        "Alison: How about, \"I'm sorry\"?",
        "Kim: I just asked a normal question. And it seemed to me there was no reason for you to be so rude.",
        "Alison: You're right. I shouldn't've taken the bait.",
        "Kim: The bait? Is everything in life with you a game?",
        "Alison: I think that you were trying to pick a fight with me.",
        "Kim: Why would I do that?",
        "Alison: Because you don't like Chris being in love with me. And you want me out of your house.",
        "Kim: Let's get one thing straight, kiddo. If I didn't want to have you here, in my home, I never would have invited you to move in.",
        "Alison: I'm not so sure about that.",
        "Kim: Oh, really?",
        "Alison: Well, maybe you figured that if I was around all the time, you could make me look bad in front of Chris. And then he would want to get rid of me on his own.",
        "Kim: Alison, for crying out loud! There's nobody in the world that has ever been able to make you do anything that you didn't already want to do.",
        "Alison: Okay, maybe I didn't go to college, but I know when someone doesn't like me, and you certainly don't.",
        "Kim: And you are certainly wrong. I actually find out that I do like you. I just don't like the things you do.",
        "Alison: All I did and all I wanted to do was go up and say hello and then leave. But then you had to start bugging me about Aaron.",
        "Kim: Well, Alison, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to bug you. But your friend Aaron had been working overtime to put my son in prison. Didn't it ever occur to you that that might bug me? And then I look up, and there you are, standing in the middle of the restaurant with your arms wrapped around his neck.",
        "Alison: So, are you going to tell Chris? Fine, go ahead. Tell him. Because whether I'm friends with Aaron or not, that is none of Chris's business.",
        "Chris: Hey! What's none of my business?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: When are you coming to work for me at B.R.O.?",
        "Carly: Well, I haven't made up my mind.",
        "Paul: Money, fame, the opportunity to do whatever work you want to do -- what part of that are you not sure about?",
        "Carly: The part where I have to lie for you.",
        "Paul: Ah, you see, I don't look at it like that.",
        "Carly: You want me to wait around while your squeeze Barbara out of the company. That's not going to happen overnight. It may never happen at all.",
        "Paul: Thank you. It'll happen, Carly, trust me. You give me some time, Barbara's gonna be crawling to the door, bleeding.",
        "Carly: You really hate her that much?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know it must sound funny. A son is supposed to love his mother. You know, call her on Sundays. Send her for a cruise on her birthday. Something you need to know about me, Carly -- I hate her.",
        "Carly: Because of what she did to Rose?",
        "Paul: Because of what she did to me! She smothered me. She strangled me and told me how much she loved me. She's making me feel like there's no way I'm ever gonna be able to make a woman happy.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. There's too much. I don't think I can be involved in that.",
        "Paul: Okay, look. I can guarantee you that you will have nothing to do with my family. All you'll have to do is design whatever it is that you want.",
        "Carly: Really? No input?",
        "Paul: No. No restrictions. I give you complete artistic freedom. I have faith in you, Carly. You'll come through.",
        "Carly: You already know I'm interested. But I have all that money from Rosanna. Maybe it would be better if I went out on my own, regardless of the hassles.",
        "Paul: What? You're gonna spend all your time dealing with advertising and hiring and firing and marketing? That's what I do for a living, Carly. Believe me, you do that, you're not even gonna have a second to even pick up a pen and a sketch pad.",
        "Carly: I wouldn't be doing it all myself. I'd have a staff. I'd have a personal assistant --",
        "Paul: Yeah, and in ten years from now, maybe you'd make money. But you'd lose money for the first ten years. At B.R.O. that is already out of the way. All you'd have to do is be brilliant.",
        "Carly: And I won't have to deal with Barbara?",
        "Paul: No, not at all.",
        "Carly: There's something else that we didn't discuss --",
        "Paul: Money? Whatever it is, you let me know, I'll break my back to make sure you get it.",
        "Carly: Well, you're making it very hard to say no.",
        "Paul: Well, then say yes. Look, this is right for you, Carly. Barbara's had her turn in the spotlight. Now it's your turn.",
        "Carly: Like I said, you're making it real hard to say no.",
        "Paul: Aw, that's great. That is, that's great. We're gonna do great things together, Carly. You're not gonna regret this.",

        "Molly: Hey, to what do I owe this surprise?",
        "Craig: May I?",
        "Molly: Yeah, I'm not going to be here for very long. But sure.",
        "Craig: I need you to tell me the truth about something, Molly.",
        "Molly: Well, like I said, I'm on my way out.",
        "Craig: Did Paul Ryan call the Canadian authorities and tell them about Cabot?",
        "Molly: I don't know. You know, Paul and I aren't friends. He doesn't tell me what he does or doesn't do.",
        "Craig: I think he might've told you this.",
        "Molly: Craig, I know that you're hurting over losing your son. Pointing fingers isn't going to bring him back.",
        "Craig: Yes, you're right. And he's with his mother -- fine, fine, fine. But I have been betrayed, Molly. And I need to know who betrayed me.",
        "Molly: Well -- good luck with that. Could I have my coat?",
        "Craig: Molly, all around my house are memories of the son I almost had. There's toys. His favorite blanket. And it's very quiet. No crying, no \"twinkle, twinkle.\"",
        "Molly: I feel for you, Craig. I do.",
        "Craig: I know. Because you've gone through this. You know what it's like. How empty a house -- how empty a heart -- can feel when children are taken away.",
        "Molly: It's not the same. Bridget and Michele --",
        "Craig: -- Were stolen out of your life. I know you feel that pain.",
        "Molly: Why are you doing this?",
        "Craig: Because I need you to help me, Molly. As one grieving parent to another. I need you to tell me the truth about Paul Ryan.",

        "Henry: Yo.",
        "Mike: You got a sweatshirt or something? This thing's soaked.",
        "Henry: Yeah, sure. Anything you need. How's the water heater coming?",
        "Mike: It's almost fixed.",
        "Henry: Great! Great. That's good news, you know, because I really wanted to take a hot bath. My skin gets so flaky, you know, when it gets cold like this. And I just -- not interested?",
        "Mike: Not even a little bit.",
        "Henry: I'll get that sweatshirt.",
        "Mike: Good, good.",

        "Chris: Fine. Everything all right here?",
        "Alison: Sure.",
        "Kim: It was just a minor misunderstanding.",
        "Chris: About what?",
        "Alison: I took the annulment papers over for Aaron at Metro. And your mother was there. And I gave Aaron a hug, and she saw us.",
        "Kim: What can I say? Aaron Snyder did his best to put you in prison. And I have a hard time understanding how Alison can shrug that off so easily.",
        "Alison: It was a hug, that's all. It's not like I was making out with him.",
        "Kim: Well, I guess I just don't have the warm, fuzzy feelings for him that you do.",
        "Alison: Well, you don't know Aaron as well as I do. And it's like I said before -- whether I'm gonna be friends with him or not, that is no one else's business.",
        "Chris: You're wrong, Alison. It's my business, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: You can't compare your situation to mine, Craig. I didn't lose Bridget and Michele because I tried some illegal adoption process. I lost Bridget and Michele because Jake died. Look, you went and found your misery. Mine came looking for me.",
        "Craig: Molly, I thought the adoption was legitimate. All right? Now, all I'm saying here is pain is pain. And I think you know what I mean.",
        "Molly: I can't make it better for you.",
        "Craig: I know. You're not doing this for me. You're doing this for yourself.",
        "Molly: How do you figure that?",
        "Craig: Because I think you told Paul about Cabot. And he used it against me. And that destroyed my family, Molly. So I need you to tell me, and I'm going to ask you one last time, did Paul Ryan call the Canadian police and turn me in?",
        "Molly: Craig, wait.",
