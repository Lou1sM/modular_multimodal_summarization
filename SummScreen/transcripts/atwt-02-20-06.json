        "Maddie and Casey let themselves into Barbara's room to search for evidence that Gwen is innocent, thanks to a nanny cam, but seem to come up empty handed when the tape seems to have looped over any evidence. Will and Gwen continue to try to cover for one another. Margo demands to know who was helping them after she shows them items from her house. Gwen claims they believed Casey should help them because he owed them, and when he was not home, they let themselves in and took the stuff. Margo doesn't believe any of their statements. Barbara tries to guilt and blackmail Will into leaving Gwen. He seems to take the bait, but then stuns Barbara when he tells her he is pleading guilty to the charges against him and will get Gwen a public attorney. Barbara is infuriated; she storms out of the police station only to be confronted by Casey and Maddie claiming they have proof from her nanny cam that shows Gwen didn't lay a hand on her. Katie and Jack discuss Nick's blatant flirting with Carly. Katie thinks he is harmless, but Jack isn't convinced. Carly lies to Jack, as she heads to the Galaxy strip club, to quit. Butch doesn't allow her to because a big player named Anatoli is coming in, and she is the only blond waitress in that night, so she needs to stick around. When Carly realizes this man is involved in Jack and Nick's case, she decides to warm up to Anatoli. The big wig takes the bait. Later, when Carly goes to meet Jack, she subtly starts to talk about the Anatoli case to push him in the right direction, but all Jack sees is she is not wearing her wedding ring. Why is that? Emily sees Paul and Meg kissing. She runs back and cries on Henry's shoulder about why every man she loves leaves her. Henry tries to comfort her and in the process gives Emily an idea on how to get on with her life. She calls Dusty and tells him that she has something he and Jen will want to hear. Meg thinks a bond developed between them because she nursed him back to health. She wants to focus on getting far away from Oakdale. Paul has a change of heart. He thinks he is better off dead. He has an idea; he thinks they should run away together. Meg is shocked, but soon she is talked into it, as Paul and she consider their future together."

        "Carly: That doesn't mean that he won't crack it.",
        "Nick: You can't crack a case standing by the water cooler. I'll make sure he gets some of the credit. He did a great job with all the light work.",

        "Casey: The baby cam's gotta be hidden though, right? But, where? Behind the wall or in the ceiling?",
        "Maddie: Well I'm thinking that it could be one of those things where they can move from in here to the bedroom. I don't know just start looking.",

        "Maddie: Don't say that.",
        "Casey: I would, especially if it had evidence.",

        "Henry: I just thought that maybe you could use a pick-me-up, Barbara. I heard about poor Will.",
        "Barbara: That is none of your business.",
        "Henry: No, it isn't. You might remember I used to dabble as a P.I.",
        "Barbara: Is this a business proposition?",
        "Henry: No, no. It's a friendly discussion. And an offer of assistance, if you need it.",

        "Barbara: Why on earth are you talking about charging both of them, Margo?",
        "Margo: Barbara, Will has been aiding a fugitive, bringing her food, hiding her at Metro.",

        "Paul: I'm not sorry.",
        "Meg: I am, Paul.",
        "Paul: For what?",
        "Meg: For crying on your shoulder about Dusty.",

        "Meg: Does it have to be about anything?",
        "Paul: I hope not.",
        "Meg: Look, we've been out of circulation too long.",
        "Paul: Tell me about it.",
        "Meg: And it's natural we'd form a bond.",
        "Paul: You did save my life.",
        "Meg: It happens sometimes.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Meg: You help a patient, and you get close to him.",
        "Paul: I guess I'm just an occupational hazard? Wait, let's not overanalyze this, okay?",
        "Meg: Let's not analyze it at all.",
        "Paul: Better. You good?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Yeah I am.",

        "Butch: Hey. You know the rules. No cell phones.",
        "Carly: Yeah, okay. I was just making sure it's off.",
        "Butch: Well, keep it that way. Okay.",
        "Anatoli: Butch. Long time, no see.",
        "Butch: Anatoli? Welcome back! Great to see you.",
        "Anatoli: It's great to be here. Business is -- good?",
        "Butch: Ah, can't complain. Can't complain. But we missed you around here. Nice to have you back.",
        "Carly: You just gonna stand there? Or are you gonna offer this nice man a drink?",
        "Anatoli: Business first.",
        "Butch: I'll take care of it.",
        "Anatoli: And now I'll have --",
        "Carly: Vodka, rocks. Splash of water.",
        "Anatoli: That is either a very lucky guess, or --",
        "Carly: Or I do my homework.",
        "Anatoli: What else do you do?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: That depends. Vodka, rocks. And a bit of water, please.",

        "Carly: It's Tiffany.",
        "Anatoli: A girl with expensive taste.",
        "Carly: Or a girl who knows what she wants.",
        "Anatoli: They're often the same thing.",
        "Carly: Indeed.",

        "Katie: Any good news?",
        "Jack: Not yet, but I'm only on section three.",
        "Katie: You working over at the station tonight?",
        "Jack: Oh, a little bit. Yeah.",
        "Katie: It's way too quiet over there.",
        "Jack: Not too m not too much better here. Why don't you have a seat? And a cup of coffee?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Sure. It's a little late to be taping, isn't it?",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm not taping tonight. I'm actually killing time. Mike's away.",
        "Jack: On business?",
        "Katie: Yeah. With his brother, mark, in Latvia.",
        "Jack: Latvia? That's the other side of the planet.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: You okay at your house?",
        "Katie: Yeah, fine. Just a little lonely.",
        "Jack: I could set up a security detail if you want me to.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no --",
        "Jack: Not that I think that B.J.'s coming back, or anything. It just pays to be safe.",
        "Katie: No, I don't need it. I'm, I'm -- not alone, actually. Nick's staying with me.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Jack: Whose brainstorm was that?",
        "Katie: Mike's. Look, I know Nick isn't your favorite person --",
        "Jack: We just got off on the wrong foot, that's all. We have to -- work together. So, I'll manage.",
        "Katie: You know, if you need me to -- patch things up --",
        "Jack: I don't, I don't. And you know what -- you couldn't if you tried.",

        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Barbara: I want to see my son.",
        "Margo: Oh, would you calm down?",
        "Barbara: I'll calm down when I see my son!",
        "Margo: Follow me.",
        "Barbara: Oh, honey. Thank God you're all right.",
        "Will: Who called her?",
        "Margo: I did. Gwen -- you need to come and sign your statement.",
        "Will: Why can't she just do it in here?",
        "Margo: It won't take a minute. Come on.",
        "Will: Go home, Mom.",
        "Barbara: I am not going to leave you here like some kind of common criminal.",
        "Will: Why, because you love me?",
        "Barbara: Yes, exactly. Because I love you.",
        "Will: And you want what's best for me?",
        "Barbara: You know I do.",
        "Will: Then drop the charges against Gwen.",
        "Barbara: All right. That can be done.",
        "Will: Mm-hmm. What's the catch?",
        "Barbara: It's quite simple. I will drop all the charges -- if you promise you'll never see that girl again.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Yeah. We helped ourselves to your food. I'm sorry. You can just -- you can add it to the list of charges.",
        "Margo: And the sweatshirt?",
        "Gwen: It came from your house, too.",
        "Margo: Oh, so it just walked out of the house on its own?",
        "Gwen: No -- we broke in. Kind of -- I had this really stupid idea that I would ask Casey for help. I figured that he owed me. So, we went over to your house, and nobody was there. The door wasn't locked, so we went in. We took that stuff.",
        "Margo: Hmm. Did you?",
        "Gwen: Look, I will confess to hurting Will's mom. I will admit to anything. I'll sign whatever you need me to sign. But I want you to do something for me.",
        "Margo: What? I'm listening.",

        "Casey: We tried. She got rid of it.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well I can't just quit on Gwen and Will. Maddie, come on. Let's get out of here.",
        "Maddie: Casey, I'm thinking. I'm thinking.",
        "Casey: Well, think downstairs. Come on. Put that back. Let's go.",
        "Maddie: Casey, I got it!",
        "Casey: Now what?",
        "Maddie: Look! Look, look, look! In here.",
        "Casey: In the pillow?",
        "Maddie: Check it out. Yes. It's the perfect angle to see everything in the room. Do you think you can get it out?",
        "Casey: I can try.",
        "Maddie: Do you think you can hook it up to the TV so we can watch this on a tape?",
        "Casey: Well, hold on.",
        "[Maddie sighs]",
        "Maddie: Just think -- if this was actually in here and running, we could see what happened when Barbara got knocked out. Then we'll really know what happened.",
        "Casey: I think its show time.",

        "[Emily crying]",
        "Henry: I guess I can assume things didn't go as you --",
        "Emily: I am such a fool, Henry.",
        "Henry: We're all fools for love.",
        "Emily: He was kissing her. Henry, he was kissing Meg!",
        "Henry: Did they see you?",
        "Emily: Oh, God. I don't get love, I get leftovers. Could-have-beens, would- have-beens --",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know the feeling.",
        "Emily: My entire life, honestly -- men. My father, Tom, Paul -- none of them ever wanted me.",
        "Henry: There's still good ol' Hal --",
        "Emily: Yeah, Hal -- I came in second to a warm doughnut, Henry.",
        "Henry: It's better than a leggy brunette.",
        "Emily: Meg, why Meg? Why not me? Why?",
        "Henry: I don't know. That pesky bullet, maybe. That's just a guess, but --",
        "Emily: It was a crime of passion, Henry!",
        "Henry: I know. I know. And Meg knows her way around a bullet wound. You can't compete with that.",
        "Emily: What is love?",
        "Henry: It's -- a dry martini.",
        "Emily: Don't you want it? Don't you want it all? The excitement and the devotion and the passion.",
        "Henry: And the inevitable --",
        "Emily: Don't you want that?",
        "Henry: And the inevitable crush of rejection.",
        "Emily: I am so sick and tired of not being good enough. I'm just sick of it! Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to come in second to a woman in a permanent vegetative state?",
        "Henry: No, I don't.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. He never let go of her. He never let go of her. He said he never stopped loving her. I'm so stupid. I should have seen it, but I'm a good liar. See, that's my problem --",
        "Henry: Yes, you are --",
        "Emily: -- And I lie to myself.",
        "Henry: You are --",
        "Emily: I lie to myself better than anyone. I had myself convinced that Paul stayed here because of me. That he was trying to remember, you know, the way it was in the beginning, when we would stay in his -- oh, God, we'd stay in his place, locked up for days, without food and without sleep. Just drinking each other up, making love until we were too exhausted to walk --",
        "Henry: Shh! That's enough. That's enough! Listen, maybe seeing him with Meg today is not the end of the world. Maybe, up close and personal, it was the best thing that could have happened to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul, I have two options -- I can stay and be accused of hiring \"Madame Moron\" to break up Jen and Dusty, or I can leave and maybe have a shot at a half-decent life somewhere.",
        "Paul: Half-decent?",
        "Meg: If I'm lucky. And I'm not feeling very lucky.",
        "Paul: What about Dusty?",
        "Meg: Well, he thinks I've got a fatal attraction. Hide your bunnies and stash your Butcher knives.",
        "Paul: Dusty's an idiot. I just told you that. He's a fool.",
        "Meg: Well, now he's your sister's.",
        "Paul: So -- where will you go?",
        "Meg: Flasta's still out there.",
        "Paul: Long winters.",
        "Meg: Just one of the perks. Look, I don't know where I'm gonna land -- and I really don't care. Anywhere but here is looking pretty good right now. And I've got nothing to hold me here anymore.",
        "Paul: I think you've got more holding you here than you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Like what? Family? Friends? I'm pretty alone at both.",
        "Paul: We all have our sad stories.",
        "Meg: I'm not looking for pity.",
        "Paul: I'm not offering any. For me, being dead has its upside.",
        "Meg: No more income tax?",
        "Paul: Right. No family to disappoint or crazy girlfriends to gun you down. I think, at the end of the day, I would rather have my family love me for being dead than resent me for being alive.",
        "Meg: Well, it's scary, but I actually get your logic.",
        "Paul: I have burned a lot of bridges and I have even less holding me here than you do. So, why don't we just take off together? You wanna run away with me?",

        "Henry: Well, imagine the worst. Emily! Look at you! Come here. You are young and beautiful. You are young and beautiful.",
        "Emily: I wish he were dead!",
        "Henry: You came close, that counts for something, doesn't it? And he didn't call the cops -- you're free.",
        "Emily: Free? To do what? To fall in love with again? Forget it!",
        "Henry: Shh, shh. Listen to me. Listen, someday -- someday, Mr. Right is gonna come riding in on a big white horse. He's gonna swoop you right off of your feet --",
        "Emily: And fall in love with someone else.",
        "Henry: -- And Paul Ryan is yesterday's news. Forget about him! You are a strong, independent woman. Who needs a man, huh? \"You can't live with him, you can't kill him,\" that's what I always say. Are you getting any of this?",
        "Emily: You have been a very good friend tonight, Henry.",
        "Henry: It's nothing. Speaking of money -- I know this is an emotional time, difficult --",
        "Emily: No, no, no! No, no, no. That money is yours -- and you should have it. Especially since you just helped me figure out how to pick up the pieces and get on with my life.",

        "Barbara: Well, it seems that her future is in your hands.",
        "Will: Gwen and I make each other happy. When are you gonna understand that?",
        "Barbara: Two against the world. Honey, the thrill of eating out of cans in a coldwater flat will wear off, eventually. And I know that I'm risking the fact that you may never want anything to do with me again, but -- Will, love, real love, means making hard choices. It means making sacrifices. I'm willing to lose you to save you from a life that's going to wear you down. What are you willing to sacrifice for Gwen?",

        "Margo: I can't just drop the charges against Will.",
        "Gwen: Well, why not? I mean, you guys do that all the time. I plead \"guilty\" and then you let him go. That's how it works, right?",
        "Margo: Do you want to help Will, or do you want to tell the truth?",
        "Gwen: Both.",
        "Margo: Hmm. Can you?",
        "Gwen: Look, Detective Hughes -- Mrs. Hughes, Will is a really good guy.",
        "Margo: Well, you don't have to sell me on that.",
        "Gwen: But, no matter what I do, I always end up hurting him.",
        "Margo: You know what? I bet he feels exactly the same way. But, you know what, Gwen? There are just too many sides of this story that don't add up for me. Will's got his side of the story, Barbara's got her side. There are eyewitnesses who overheard you threatening her. I can't help you on this case if I don't know the truth. So -- wanna tell me? What really happened the night that Barbara got hurt?",

        "Maddie: Well, what do we have -- a whole tape of a baby sleeping? What happened to the night?",
        "Casey: It probably starts recording over itself after a couple days.",
        "Maddie: Oh. This is terrible!",
        "Casey: Listen, Maddie. Look, we need to get out of here before Barbara gets back.",
        "Maddie: No, I called Henry, and he said that she was on her way to the police station. So, she should be a while, right?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Well, we're gonna end up at the police station, too, for breaking and entering if we don't get out of here.",
        "Maddie: You go. I need to think.",
        "Casey: Maddie, you said it yourself -- the tape was our only shot, and it was a dead end. Unless --",

        "Jack: There's a subject?",
        "Katie: Nick.",

        "Jack: Well --",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. But he doesn't mean anything by it.",
        "Jack: Is that it, or are you just giving him the benefit of the doubt because he's Mike's cousin?",
        "Katie: No, Nick has his faults. Believe me, I know. [Jack laughing] But, I really think he -- he's a good person. Besides, I had a talk with him.",
        "Jack: You did? What about?",
        "Katie: Carly. [Jack sighs] He swears it's totally innocent. It's just the way he's wired. Okay, I know it sounds like a bit of an excuse. But Mike trusts him. Otherwise, would he ask him to watch out for me?",
        "Jack: I just hope he's worthy of that trust, Katie. Because from everything I've seen, the guy doesn't respect too many boundaries. And in situations like this, sooner or later, people usually get hurt.",

        "Chardonnay: You mind?",
        "Carly: No! No, I don't mind at all. In fact, I have to leave for a few minutes. So, if Butch asks, you just -- i don't even care what you tell him. Just tell him anything, okay?",
        "Chardonnay: What's up?",
        "Carly: No, it's no big deal. And I won't be long. Just keep everybody happy -- especially that Anatoli guy.",

        "Barbara: Do you?",
        "Will: I hate it, but I get it. The only thing I've given Gwen lately is more problems. And if we end up going to court over all this, who knows how long it'll be before we can have a normal life.",
        "Barbara: Honey, we can end all the legal issues right here, tonight. And if you agree that you and Gwen will go your separate ways, then I -- well, I'll see to it that she gets settled -- help her get started in school somewhere. I won't abandon her.",
        "Will: Really?",
        "Barbara: Really. Will, I'm not heartless. And I know this hurts, but, honey -- you have so much growing left to do.",
        "Will: I guess I thought I'd be doing it with Gwen.",
        "Barbara: Well, the reality is, that at your age, eventually you'd grow apart.",
        "Will: You don't know that.",
        "Barbara: Honey, she's not like us. Now, I know that's difficult to hear, and you don't want to hear that, but it is the truth. And I think you realize that once the novelty wore off, you would see that the only thing you had in common was a knack for getting in trouble.",
        "Will: It has been pretty crazy lately. Wow, this is weird. We've been talking a whole five minutes, and no one's yelling or storming out.",
        "Barbara: Yeah. So, you agree -- this is best?",

        "Barbara: Will --",
        "Will: No matter what happens, we're in this together. Real love is about making hard choices, right? Sacrifices -- that's what you said, isn't it?",
