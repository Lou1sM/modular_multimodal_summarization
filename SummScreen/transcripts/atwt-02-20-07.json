        "Henry: Oh, this is nothing you can't handle. Somebody put on the tube, please.",
        "Katie: Oh, okay. No, no, no no. It's no problem. If you have to run, you have to run. Just get here as soon as you can, okay? All right. Excuse me. Nancy, hi.",
        "Nancy: Hello, Dear. Where's Kim?",

        "Katie: It will. It's gonna start in a few minutes.",
        "Henry: Hey, places everybody. Places everybody.",
        "Katie: Henry, I'm kind of nervous. What if they hate me?",
        "Henry: Oh, many have tried. Most have failed.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",

        "Vienna: What? Don't you want to watch yourself on TV?",
        "Brad: No, I want to watch the basketball game.",
        "Vienna: Oh, look look! I was watching upstairs when they made an announcement that you and Katie were up next.",

        "Lily: I love that outfit. Isn't it gorgeous?",
        "Faith: It's a weird color. I like that one.",

        "Faith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Did she give it to you?",
        "Faith: No, I found it in the trash.",
        "Lily: I doubt that Meg would throw out an expensive bracelet like this.",
        "Faith: You're right, Mom. I stole it, and I'm gonna wear it around so everyone could see. That way I'll get in even more trouble -- possibly be grounded for the rest of my life.",
        "Lily: Don't be sarcastic with me, please.",
        "Faith: Why don't you call Aunt Meg and talk to her? You never believe me anyway.",
        "Paul: Dammit. What the hell does it mean?",
        "Lily: All I'm saying is that Meg might not know that the bracelet ended up in the trash. She might not know that it's missing.",
        "Faith: You're right.",
        "Lily: Hey, where are you going?",
        "Faith: I'll be back.",

        "Lily: I'll come with you.",
        "Faith: To the bathroom? Don't worry. I won't throw up. I wait until after I eat.",
        "Lily: That's not even funny. Don't joke about that -- come on, sit down, sit down. Why -- why does everything have to be a battle with you lately?",
        "Faith: Why don't you trust me?",
        "Lily: You've given me reason not to trust you. You've taken off twice.",
        "Faith: Half the kids in my class do much worse.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: I just wanted to have a night with you -- the two of us together like we used to.",

        "Faith: Whatever.",
        "Lily: I'm telling you. It'll just take one second. Hold on. Lily Snyder. What, what is it? I'm a little busy right now -- I thought we could handle this at the meeting tomorrow. All right, just make it quick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: It's your imagination, Meg. No one's here. Great -- talking to yourself. First signs of a mental breakdown. [Phone rings] What do you want, Paul?",
        "Paul: I know I said I'd stop calling.",
        "Meg: Then stop.",
        "Paul: But I had that vision again -- the weird one with the bracelet.",
        "Meg: So what do you want me to say?",
        "Paul: It was worse than the first time, meg.",
        "Meg: So take two aspirin, and don't call me in the morning.",
        "Paul: Stop joking, all right? I'm trying to save you.",
        "Meg: I threw away the bracelet, okay? It's nowhere near me. So you don't have to call me. You don't have to keep me safe. You don't have to do anything but hang up now.",

        "Brad: No wonder she didn't tell you.",

        "Craig: You people breed like rabbits.",
        "Vienna: You know what, I really don't appreciate your attitude, Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Brad: Neither do I. Look, Jack told me all about you. It's simple. Either beat it, or we take it outside.",
        "Craig: Spoken like a true Snyder. I'll find her on my own. Thank you very much.",
        "Vienna: Why Meg would run off to a cheap little motel is a mystery to me. Who would want to stay at a place named the Wagon Train?",
        "Craig: Wagon train -- you mean the Wagon Wheel?",
        "Brad: Vienna!",
        "Vienna: Hey, she left it on a note right there.",
        "Craig: Thank you Miss Hyatt, you've been very helpful.",
        "Brad: Beat it.",
        "Vienna: That man -- he has always reminded me of this count I met in Zurich once. He was very rich, of course.",
        "Brad: Oh yeah? I'll bet he wasn't on TV.",
        "Vienna: No. He was -- how do you say it? He had a face made for radio. Not like you, you handsome man. You have a face the camera just loves.",
        "Brad: Have you ever heard that old American saying, flattery will get you everywhere?",
        "Vienna: Really?",
        "Brad: So true.",

        "Katie: I'm sure the special report will be over soon.",
        "Henry: They promised to air the show in its entirety.",
        "Katie: Did that warehouse have to burn down tonight?",
        "Henry: It's just to upstage you, Honey.",

        "Henry: Yeah, you want a little more there I love a woman who can hold her pucker.",
        "Nancy: Thank you.",
        "Henry: Sure.",
        "Katie: Well, since we have a little time before the show starts, I just want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for coming. As most of you know, my family is going through kind of a tough time right now, so I couldn't expect my sister and brothers and nephews to be here tonight, so it makes it all that more special to share this with my work family and two of my most cherished friends. I really appreciate you being here tonight. I feel like I'm entering a new chapter into my life, and I just am very grateful to share it all with you.",
        "Henry: Hey, hey, hey, hey. They're cutting back. They're cutting back. Turn up the sound.",

        "Henry: Who cares about the music? Look at you -- you look gorgeous.",
        "Katie: I mean, I'm a bit of a neat freak, I have to admit. So -- everything has it's place, everything is in it's place and as you can see, this -- I'm okay -- okay, just -- I'm cool. I'm just gonna get up now. What the --",
        "Brad: You know, is babbling really necessary? Can you keep it down? I'm sleeping here.",
        "Nancy: I had no idea it was a comedy.",
        "Katie: Neither did I.",
        "Katie: When you have a big cleaning job, think of the room as a clock. Start at 12 and systematically work your way around the room until you get back to 12, so you make a big job a little more manageable.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Katie: Okay, I know this is all so much fun, but there's desserts in the kitchen we haven't even tried yet.",
        "Henry: Shh! We can't hear, Bubbles.",
        "Katie: We've all seen it in production, right?",
        "Nancy: Well, I haven't.",

        "Katie: Oh, oh, look, so sad. A commercial already.",

        "Colleague: Who isn't into that type?",
        "Nancy: Will he be on every week?",
        "Katie: No! No, he won't actually. Hold down the fort for a second.",
        "Henry: Yeah, Bubbles. Bubbles, you've got that look.",
        "Katie: No, I'm fine. Everything's fine. Everything's great. Just keep passing around the food. Excuse me, everyone. I just have to run and check on something very important. But, enjoy the show and I'll be back as soon as I can.",
        "Nancy: Katie, are you all right?",
        "Katie: I'm ecstatic. Who wouldn't be after a debut like that?",

        "Vienna: You were wonderful on that show. So funny.",
        "Brad: No more shop talk.",
        "Vienna: You are going to be a big TV star. Should I be jealous?",

        "Brad: Okay, Vienna, you know, just for kicks and giggles, right? What if -- what if I wasn't on TV? What if I was just a guy down on his luck, wanting to have a good time? Would you still be into that champagne bath?",
        "Vienna: You are so funny. What did I tell you? You know what? You have to promise me you're not going to change when you get even more rich and famous, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I think preliminary market research is a very good idea. I agree. The better we know our potential customer, the more we will succeed.",
        "Faith: Oh, hi, Morgan, Mrs. McCarthy. My mom's on a business call.",
        "Morgan: Hey, cool bracelet.",
        "Faith: Thanks.",

        "Lily: I missed Morgan and her mom. I'm sorry.",

        "Lily: No, I'm going to be off this call in like a second.",
        "Faith: Okay. But they said they would drive me home.",
        "Lily: Faith, you're grounded.",
        "Faith: It's not like I'm going to go anywhere. Mrs. McCarthy is even more strict than you or Dad.",

        "Faith: Thanks, Mom!",
        "Lily: Just don't -- oh, come here. Make sure that she doesn't drop you off too late, okay? Okay? I love you.",

        "Craig: Things get better.",
        "Meg: Okay, yeah? When?",
        "Craig: Well, that's the tricky part. I don't know. But when a son dies, and the other one is missing, and then your daughter turns on you, the one thing that I've learned for sure is that you don't find answers in a place like this.",
        "Meg: So, where do you find them?",

        "Lily: Oh, no, no. He's no boy. He's a man. He's a man, he's my husband, the father of our children. And we need to deal with our children our way.",
        "Lucinda: It's a funny thing, you know, all their lives, I felt that they were my children, too. It's hard to step back. The funny thing is, all their lives they've felt like my kids too. It's hard to step back.",
        "Lily: I know. I know, but if they turn to you or to Holden every time, and not me, I get pushed further and further into the background.",

        "Lily: And I adore you. But sometimes, it's hard to be heard over the crowd.",
