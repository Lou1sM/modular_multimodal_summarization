        "Paul is lucky to be alive after the bomb Craig put in his car, but he has second degree burns over 20% of his body. Margo puts out an APB on Craig who later calls her from his private plane headed to the Caiman Islands and tells her that Paul and Craig deserve to pay for torturing him. Meg struggles with wanting to take care of Paul but later decides she can't help him recover this time. Sofie goes to the hospital to visit Chris and Emily warns her not to hurt or use Chris and Sofie tells her that her relationship with Chris is none of her business. Emily decides to take Paul's offer to let the intruder become a subsidiary of Worldwide. Emily is also worried when she sees Sofie sitting at Paul's bedside because he asked her to stay with him because he didn't want to be alone. Carly and Jack plan to use Cowboy Jack to get Kit to admit she fired the shot that killed Sam. Carly puts a sleeping pill in Kit's hamburger and then the second part of their plan will take place. Parker worries that the plan is going to backfire because any plan that Carly is involved in never works."

        "Barbara: Please, please, tell me he's going to be okay. They wouldn't tell me anything down in E.R.",
        "Chris: He's lucky to be alive. Paul managed to escape with second degree burns on 20% of his body.",
        "Barbara: Oh my God.",
        "Chris: I saw a lot of burn victims in Darfur and believe me, it could've been a lot worse.",
        "Barbara: So he's going to be okay?",
        "Chris: It's serious. It will all depend on how well his body responds to the trauma, but he's getting the best care available. We called in a burn specialist from Chicago.",
        "Barbara: When can I see him?",
        "Chris: Let the nurse get him settled, then you can go in.",
        "Margo: Barbara, how's Paul?",
        "Barbara: They just brought him down from surgery. He's hanging on, barely.",
        "Margo: Good. We're investigating the car bombing as an attempted homicide, but I'll wait until Paul is stable to question him.",
        "Barbara: You don't need to talk to Paul to find out who did this. Get out there and arrest your brother Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Another dead end.",
        "Jack: No phone call, no gas station receipt, no use of an automated toll. There is absolutely nothing, no evidence that Kit came back to Oakdale and fired the second shot that killed Sam.",
        "Carly: There's got to be something, Jack. We have to prove your theory about Kit, or Parker could go to jail for something he didn't do.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well then maybe we gotta move on to plan \"B.\" Maybe -- maybe cowboy Jack can help us catch this killer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What makes you think that Craig is involved?",
        "Barbara: Oh, come on, Margo. What kind of proof do you want? Do you want a bomb receipt? We both know that Craig was behind this.",
        "Margo: I'm supposed to base this on your hunch?",
        "Barbara: It's the same M.O. he used over 20 years ago to get rid of Steve Andropolous. You'd think after all these years he'd come up with something a little more original.",
        "Margo: All right, I understand that you're upset about Paul, so I'll come back later.",
        "Barbara: You know what? I'm just worried about Paul. He didn't deserve this. Craig has gone too far. So get out there and arrest him.",
        "[Margo remembering]",
        "Craig: I have no intention of hurting Meg. Quite the contrary. Paul, however, that's a different story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Dallas, I need you to put out an APB on Craig Montgomery for Paul Ryan's car bombing. Yes, that's right. High priority. He's a definite flight risk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilot: We'll be landing in approximately 50 minutes Mr. Montgomery. Oh, and the current temperature on the Cayman Islands is 82 and sunny.",
        "Craig: Perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh God. You've got to make it, Honey. Hi. I'm here. Paul. What? What?",
        "Paul: Meg. Call Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's a long shot, but we got to try.",
        "Carly: Oh, I don't know. That's just really creepy.",
        "Jack: I thought gas lighting Kit would be right up your alley.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm, crazy plans usually are.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well Kit's not going to be an easy mark, even with Cowboy Jack's help. She's bound to be suspicious.",
        "Carly: Yeah. And, you know, she's a moving target, too. She said she was leaving town today. What if we're too late?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: Better make that to go. I gotta catch a flight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay. I'm gonna head to the station and try to get some help on slowing Kit down. Whatever keeps her here cannot be traced back to you or me.",
        "Carly: And what should I do?",
        "Jack: I'll call you as soon as we hear from her. In the mean time, you should probably put that away until we need him. And make sure that Parker gets to school. It's about time he went back, and he shouldn't be hanging around here if we're going to pull this off.",
        "Carly: Do you think this will work?",
        "Jack: It has to.",
        "Parker: Mom, what are you doing?",
        "Carly: Oh, there you are. I was just about to make you a big breakfast for your first day back at school.",
        "Parker: Nice try, and I'm not going. And I want to know what you and Dad are up to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Barbara: I thought you wanted nothing to do with him anymore.",
        "Meg: I got a call from the night nurse in the E.R. and I just wanted to see how he was. Is he awake?",
        "Barbara: Yes, he is. And unfortunately, he's asking for you.",
        "Meg: Well, don't worry, I'll keep my distance. I just wanted to see if he was all right.",
        "Barbara: Where do you think you're going? He needs you. And he's probably lying in there because of you. So get in there. Now.",
        "Meg: Paul?",
        "Paul: Hey -- stay with me.",
        "Meg: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you were all right.",
        "Chris: I need to check his vitals.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Of course.",
        "Paul: Meg --",
        "Meg: Its okay, Chris will take good care of you.",
        "Paul: Please don't -- please don't go.",
        "Meg: It's all right, he has to do his job. I'll be right outside.",
        "Paul: Stay.",
        "Barbara: Oh my God. What's happening?",
        "Chris: His breathing is shallow. There's fluid on his lungs. He's going into cardiac arrest. I'm going to need you both to step outside please.",
        "Barbara: Oh my God. What did you say to upset him?",
        "Meg: Nothing! You're the one who told me to go in there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't know what you're talking about. Jack and I aren't up to anything.",
        "Parker: I can hear you, Guys. You were arguing about my case. You, Guys should stop wasting your time because I shot Sam. He's dead. There's no defense.",
        "Carly: Well, that sounds an awful lot like giving up, Parker, and that's something we don't do in this family. Which is why you have to focus on getting your life back to normal, and that means going back to school.",
        "Parker: Mom, no way. Okay, I was on the internet last night, everyone knows what I did. They're calling me a crazed killer. They're afraid I'm going to come to school with a gun and start shooting.",
        "Carly: Then you have to prove them wrong, don't you?",
        "Parker: No, things are bad enough. I cannot deal with this.",
        "Carly: Hey, Sweetie, I know it's tough. But you need to get back into a routine, right? And part of that is school.",
        "Parker: No, I'm not going. Besides, nothing they teach me in school is going to help me in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, is Margo around? I need to talk to her.",
        "Dallas: No, she's at the hospital trying to get Paul Ryan's statement.",
        "Jack: About what?",
        "Dallas: You didn't hear? Ryan's car was bombed last night, he was almost killed. Look, I'm trying to track down Craig Montgomery for questioning.",
        "Jack: No, I was up all last night working on Parker's case.",
        "Margo: Dallas -- Dallas.",
        "Jack: Margo, listen, I know it's a bad time, it'll only take a minute. It's important. I think I found a break in Parker's case.",
        "Margo: Dallas, I need you to call the airport, get a list of passengers on all the international flights in the last 24 hours. And check out private charters as well, okay?",
        "Dallas: Okay.",
        "Margo: All right, what is it? Make it fast, Jack.",
        "Jack: I'm not going to bore you with the details. I need your help. The Oakdale PD has to keep Kit Fowler from leaving town.",
        "Margo: Why? Tell me, it's an order.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Paul's blood pressure spiked. He went into cardiac arrhythmia.",
        "Barbara: Is he going to be all right?",
        "Chris: We're doing all we can for him. I called in a cardiac specialist, he's going to do an emergency procedure and we hope it'll stabilize him. I'll send you word when we know more, okay?",
        "Barbara: What was I thinking, letting you anywhere near him?",
        "Meg: Look, I know you're upset, but I want the same thing you do, I want him to get through this and recover.",
        "Barbara: Get out of here. Leave him alone.",
        "Sofie: Hey.",
        "Chris: Sofie, hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Sofie: Final post-natal exam.",
        "Chris: Any word from the judge about your baby?",
        "Barbara: Hallie is not her baby! She is Gwen and Will's baby. And if you had an ounce of human decency or were smart enough, you would drop this pointless custody battle before you lose it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Jack, I can't believe you're gonna fall for one of Carly's harebrained schemes.",
        "Jack: This was my idea, not Carly's. Margo, I can't just sit back and watch Parker go to jail.",
        "Margo: Listen, you're a great detective, but you're too close to this. Kit as a second shooter? I don't --",
        "Jack: Carly's convinced that Parker fired only once. The second shot killed Sam. Now, last night, Kit came by Metro, and I gotta tell you, the way she was acting, something just doesn't add up. Right now, this is just a hunch, but it could pay off. That's why I need this favor. You gotta keep Kit from leaving town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What are you doing here, Sofie? Did you come to thank your partner- in-crime for betraying his cousin?",
        "Chris: Sofie had a doctor's appointment, okay. She had every right to be here.",
        "Barbara: Stop defending the kidnapper, and go take care of my son.",
        "Chris: Paul is in good hands, okay. I know you're upset and exhausted, but that is no excuse for taking it out on Sofie.",
        "Sofie: Thank you for running interference. She kind of scares me.",
        "Chris: Yeah, sorry. Barbara had no right to treat you like that.",
        "Sofie: You're taking care of her son? Will's okay, right?",
        "Chris: Yeah, Will's older brother Paul was in a car bombing. And we've been working on him all night.",
        "Sofie: That's -- that's terrible.",
        "Chris: Yeah, we're doing all we can for him. Hey, but don't let her get to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Do I have to go? Look, I can't deal with the kids and stuff.",
        "J.J.: Don't worry. I'll look after you.",
        "Sage: Yeah, we'll make sure you're okay.",
        "Carly: There. You see, you have nothing to worry about.",
        "Sage: Uncle Brad's in the car, he's gonna drive us to school. He'll stick up for you, too.",
        "J.J.: Come on. Are you afraid of some jerks at school?",
        "Parker: No. Of course not.",
        "J.J.: Good, because we've got your back.",
        "Sage: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I have a feeling I'm really going to regret this, but yes, all right. I'll figure out some way to keep Kit in town.",
        "Jack: Thank you. I knew I could count on you.",
        "Margo: Well, I've been in your situation.",
        "Jack: Then you know why Carly and I have to pursue this.",
        "Margo: I just hope that you can do for Parker what I couldn't do for Casey, and keep him out of jail.",
        "Jack: I'm sure as hell gonna try. Thank you. Thank you, Margo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Beeper beeps]",
        "Chris: It's about Paul Ryan. I got to go. Let me know when you hear from the judge, okay?",
        "Sofie: I will.",
        "Emily: Sofie, right? Emily. Hi, Emily Stewart.",
        "Sofie: Oh, you're Alison's sister.",
        "Emily: Uh-huh.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I'm really not in the mood for another lecture about my custody case.",
        "Emily: Oh, no, no, that's -- that's none of my business. Really.",
        "Sofie: Okay, then what?",
        "Emily: Well, I saw you talking to Chris Hughes. And I actually happened to see you with Chris in Old Town yesterday.",
        "Sofie: So?",
        "Emily: I don't know seems like you're getting close.",
        "Sofie: Okay. Well, why do you care?",
        "Emily: I used to date Chris. And I still care about him. I don't want to see him hurt. Or used.",
        "Sofie: My friendship with Chris is really none of your business. If you'll excuse me. I have a doctor's appointment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: That's my cell phone number. And please call me if there's anything new about my son.",
        "Nurse #2: Barbara Ryan. You -- you have your first radiation treatment tomorrow with Dr. Hearn.",
        "Barbara: I can't even think about that right now. My son's recovery is all that matters.",
        "Nurse #2: I understand, but you really shouldn't put it off.",
        "Barbara: I'll figure it out.",
        "Nurse #2: Do you have another family member that can come with you tomorrow?",
        "Barbara: I'll figure it out. Just call me if there's anything new about my son. Thank you.",
        "Emily: Barbara, I just heard. About Paul. I want you to know that I've assigned our top investigative reporter to the story.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I'm sure your gossip rag will be all over it.",
        "Emily: No, Paul and Worldwide were in the process of acquiring a significant share of \"The Intruder.\" I can assure you, the coverage will be very sensitive.",
        "Barbara: It's good to know that if the price is right, objective journalism is still possible.",
        "Emily: I am here as a friend. How is he?",
        "Barbara: He went into cardiac arrest. They're trying to stabilize him.",
        "Emily: Who did this to him?",
        "Barbara: Oh, you mean your top reporters haven't figured that out? It was Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: What'd you call, a rickshaw?",
        "Desk clerk: The taxi's coming.",
        "Kit: Yeah, so is summer. Call it again. I can't miss my flight.",
        "Dallas: No, I'm sorry. You're not going anywhere. You're coming down with me to the station.",
        "Kit: Why? I didn't do nothing wrong!",
        "Dallas: Yes, you did.",
        "Jack: Dallas, is there a problem?",
        "Kit: Yeah! Your cop buddy here's harassing me.",
        "Jack: Dallas --",
        "Dallas: The rules are strict about transporting a murder victim's body across state lines, she didn't fill out the correct forms.",
        "Jack: Okay. So call the M.E.'s office and get this little misunderstanding worked out. There's no need to drag Kit down.",
        "Dallas: Okay, look, I'll see what I can do. But there's no way this can be settled in less than 24 hours, okay? You, don't leave town. You owe me one, man.",
        "Jack: Sorry about that.",
        "Kit: Yeah, don't expect me to thank you. Now I'm stuck here for another night. I can't even afford a hotel.",
        "Jack: Well --",
        "Kit: I could barely get out of this place!",
        "Jack: I'm sure the Oakdale PD would be happy to put you up.",
        "Kit: Oh, yeah. I'm not that desperate! Cancel that cab!",
        "Jack: It worked. She's stuck in town for at least another day. And she doesn't have any money for a hotel.",
        "Carly: So far, so good.",
        "Jack: And she's pretty riled up. You've got your work cut out for you.",
        "Carly: No, don't worry about that. I can be pretty persuasive when I want to be.",
        "Kit: Damn it!",
        "Carly: Oh! Oh, Kit! Hi. Hi, I'm so surprised to see you. I thought you were leaving town.",
        "Kit: Yeah, well thanks to your cop buddies and their stupid paperwork, I'm stuck here another night. Ain't even got enough for that Wagon Wheel dump.",
        "Carly: Oh, Kit. I'm sorry. I guess you could stay at Metro, or it's probably still technically a crime scene, huh? I guess you don't want any more trouble with the cops.",
        "Kit: What the heck am I supposed to do?",
        "Carly: Well, this may not be your first choice, but you could stay with me?",
        "Kit: With you and your killer son? What are you, nuts? Anyway, why do you suddenly care what happens to me? What are you up to, Carly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I had to come and see you, to see if you were all right. I went to the cabin, and I got you these. I thought they would remind you of our time there together. And how you got better before. I know you could do it again, Paul. Even without me. I can't help you get better this time. I wish I could. But I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Mom, why didn't -- why didn't you call me sooner?",
        "Barbara: Because you and Gwen are going through so much.",
        "Will: He's my brother! Is he gonna be okay?",
        "Barbara: It's very serious.",
        "Will: This is crazy. Who would do this?",
        "Barbara: It's Craig. I'm sure of it. He and Paul have been at each other's throats over Meg. I hate that man. I hate him. I thought I lost Paul last year because of him. And now this. I don't know -- Paul's just got to make it through. You know, not a day goes by that I don't think about your sister Jennifer. And now I think that you and Gwen might lose Hallie. What's happening to our family?",
        "Will: Mom, don't talk like that. Gwen and I -- we're gonna get to keep Hallie. And Paul, he's strong. And he's going to make it through this. You -- don't give up on him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, Paul. I can't do this.",
        "Paul: Meg -- Meg -- Meg -- was Meg -- was Meg Snyder here?",
        "Chris: I didn't see her.",
        "Paul: I heard her voice.",
        "Chris: Probably a dream. The sedative we have you on is pretty strong. You should rest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: That would be a mistake.",
        "Emily: What are you doing? I just want to talk to Chris, and ask him about Paul's condition.",
        "Susan: Paul's stable. Satisfied? Now, why don't you join me for lunch?",
        "Emily: I actually have some -- you know what? On second though, I am famished. Let's -- let's go.",
        "Chris: Hey, so you're okay?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, fine physically, but, you know, I won't really be okay until I get my baby back. Um, is Barbara Ryan still here?",
        "Chris: No, I was just about to call her, so you're safe for the moment. You know, I had a really good time with you at the park. Would you like to go out for coffee with me sometime?",
        "Sofie: I had fun, too. But I don't want to be your charity case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm just trying to do a good deed here. You suffered a terrible loss, Kit. I know that. And I feel responsible.",
        "Kit: You should.",
        "Carly: Look, we're both broke until we can sell Metro. You need a place to stay. Offering you a warm bed for one night is the least I can do.",
        "Kit: I don't want to be anywhere near your trigger-happy son.",
        "Carly: Of course. Parker will be at the farm with Jack. And maybe I can get Jack to put in a good word at the station, they can speed up that paperwork. You can be gone first thing in the morning. Come on. Let me do you this for you. You came to town to make amends, now it's my turn.",
        "Kit: A bed for a night don't make up for losing Sam.",
        "Carly: Of course not.",
        "Kit: I guess I don't really have much choice.",
        "Carly: No. No, you don't. You are coming with me. Come on. And maybe I'll even throw a hot meal into the deal, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: That's plenty.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Susan: Why are you so worried about Paul?",
        "Emily: Are you kidding? Are you forgetting the history that Paul and I had together? Are you forgetting that we used to be married?",
        "Susan: Are you forgetting that you shot him on your wedding day? You and Paul make a bad combination.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, that's all behind us. In fact, we've come to terms with each other lately.",
        "Susan: Why does that give me a bad feeling?",
        "Emily: Well, get over it. Because I've decided to take Paul up on his very generous business offer, and let \"The Intruder\" be a subsidiary of Worldwide. Which is another reason why I'm very worried about him.",
        "Susan: Are you out of your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So how'd it go at school today? Any trouble on your first day back?",
        "J.J.: Well, there was this geek who started in on Parker, and I told him to shut his mouth or I'd shut it for him. And no one else said a word.",
        "Jack: Oh, did you thank your brother for standing up for you?",
        "Parker: I could have handled the jerk. But you really let him have it.",
        "Sage: Parker was just trying to save Mommy from Sam. He shouldn't have to go to jail.",
        "J.J.: I mean, yeah, you should've told me what was going on. We could've stopped Sam together.",
        "Parker: I didn't need your help. J.J. Well, you needed my help at school --",
        "Jack: Hey, hey, enough. J.J., Sage, why don't you go pick out a dessert you might want. Grab a couple brownies for Parker and me, would ya? I'm proud of you for showing up at school today. I know that wasn't easy.",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Listen, there's something else I need you to do for me. I want you to stay out at the farm with your brother and sister tonight.",

        "Kit: I'm on the wagon, remember?",
        "Carly: Uh, right. I'm sorry.",
        "Kit: Look, maybe this is a mistake. I've got to get out of here.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, come on. Kit -- don't go. Excuse me. Do you have a second?",
        "Carly: You must be hungry. Why don't you let me fix you up one of my famous hamburgers, okay?",
        "Kit: Yeah, thanks, but I think I'll skip the McCarly.",
        "Carly: Now, it's sure better than wasting money at some restaurant. Isn't it?",

        "Emily: Would you stop? There's nothing to worry about. Paul and I are going to be business associates. That's all. He can handle all the number crunching stuff I can't stand to do, and I can focus on the creative end, which is what I love anyway.",
        "Susan: Emily, you're giving Paul the control over your newspaper and your life.",
        "Emily: That's not true.",

        "Emily: Well, I wouldn't put it that way, but yes, basically.",
        "Susan: I can't believe what I'm hearing. Look at this guy! Look at what just happened to him! How can you let him anywhere near you or your newspaper? How many times do you have to keep making the same mistakes?",
