        "Katie: No. No, but I do have authority for this transaction. I'm Mrs. Coleman. Right. Yes. That account number is 43885. And you can have that to me right away? Great. Thanks you, bye. Hey! Oh, that was fast.",
        "Henry: Anything for you and Snickers. Speaking of which, there is a ton of bunny supplies in the car, so would you please give me a hand?",
        "Katie: Yes, I'll go upstairs and get my coat.",
        "Henry: Thank you very much. Um -- this is my date book.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Henry: Yeah. What's it doing down here?",
        "Katie: I'll be right back.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no. Come here. I left this in my room, so -- Katie Peretti -- I mean, Katie Coleman. I love the way that sounds.",
        "Katie: Me, too.",
        "Henry: Great, you've got about 30 seconds to tell me why you swiped this and what it is that you're plotting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You've got to do something about this, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: I will. I'll quit.",
        "Mike: But Street Jeans is your creation. Your idea. Okay, Barbara can't just come in and steal it. You've got to stop her.",
        "Jennifer: You sound just like Craig before he zoomed out of here. And now he has lawyers from Worldwide doing everything he can to try to get her out of the business.",
        "Mike: What is she after?",
        "Jennifer: Me. She wants back into my life.",
        "Mike: Can you deal with working with her?",
        "Jennifer: She will make me believe in her again, like always. And then she will hurt me, or Paul, or Will, like always, and I cannot -- I cannot set myself up like that again. Especially after everything I've worked so hard for.",
        "Mike: Sounds like you've made up your mind.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jennifer: Hello, Craig.",
        "Craig: Hello, Jennifer. I'm working on the lawyers.",
        "Jennifer: If Barbara's in, I'm out. End of story.",
        "Craig: Now, there is no Street Jeans without Jennifer. Just hold off quitting a few weeks. All right?",
        "Jennifer: Do I send my resignation letter to you or to Sierra?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maid: Welcome home, Ms. Esteban.",
        "Sierra: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Just don't do anything rash.",
        "Sierra: Hello.",
        "Craig: Hello. California lucrative?",
        "Sierra: Well, as a matter of fact, it was.",
        "Dusty: It was a great trip. You can hug me later.",
        "Sierra: You know, the Napa spa was everything we expected and more. And with Dusty's business plan, I think that we're gonna double our profits in less than a year.",
        "Craig: Oh, goody. Something I have to talk to you about, about Street Jeans. Can I speak to you privately?",
        "Sierra: I know why you're here. You came to gloat.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Sierra: When I was at the airport, I picked up just a few of these. Every single issue -- fashion model turns fashion designer, Jennifer Munson. You are a genius, Craig.",
        "Craig: Oh, I don't know.",
        "Sierra: Oh, come on, don't be modest. You knew that Jennifer was a natural and you stepped up the PR when it counted. With Jennifer, Street Jeans is a slam dunk. Without her, we just have a warehouse full of torn jeans. So, congratulations. I'm so glad you convinced her to come along.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What do you mean, Carly? What do you mean you might've made things worse? How?",
        "Carly: Jack, I swear to you that I did not plan for things to turn out this way --",
        "Jack: What did you tell Lily? Why is she at Julia's?",
        "Carly: Well, Holden promised that he was gonna come here tonight and spend some time with Lily and the kids. But he was late, and we thought that he was lying about why. So Lily asked me to drive over to Julia's and check it out. And I did, and I saw his car parked there. So I just assumed that -- that they were together. And I told Lily. I just called her. I tried to stop her.",
        "Jack: Call her again! Maybe we're not too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What did you just say?",
        "Julia: You heard her. She wishes I was dead.",
        "Holden: Get out.",
        "Lily: I didn't mean it. I'm just upset. Don't you think I have the right to be upset?",
        "Holden: Lily, go home.",
        "Julia: You know what? Maybe you should drive her. Maybe she's not okay to drive herself.",
        "Lily: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Julia: You know what?! I'm just trying to help you.",
        "Lily: Then stop sleeping with my husband!",
        "Holden: Lily -- I'm going to call you a cab.",
        "Lily: I don't want a ride home. I want to fight for my life back. And I'm willing to fight. Why aren't you?",
        "Holden: Just go.",
        "Julia: I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: She didn't hurt you, did she?",
        "Julia: I'm so scared.",
        "Holden: You don't have to worry about that. I'm going to take care of Lily. And I'm going to take care of you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Paul, how can you be mad at me? I was just being straight with you.",
        "Paul: Do you honestly believe that Rosanna would set up this whole haunting thing just to frame you?",
        "Will: I said it made sense. I didn't say that she was doing it to be mean.",
        "Paul: What you said is that she's nuts.",
        "Will: I know how she feels, okay? Her kid is dead. She thinks she caused that. Feeling responsible for somebody's death, that really messes with your head.",
        "Paul: Fine, you believe what you want to believe.",
        "Barbara: Well, look who's here. Would you like to tell me why your brother is so angry?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: All charges against Barbara were dropped. That was our deal.",
        "James: Indeed it was and you were superb.",
        "Rosanna: You never said that there would be something more. What more could you possibly want from me?",
        "James: Well, first, I want you to pack and then I want you to leave Oakdale with me.",
        "Rosanna: You want me to leave Oakdale with you?",
        "James: Don't sound so horrified. It's not as if I'm asking you to leave Paris or Rome.",
        "Rosanna: I can't leave. My husband is here. My sister is here. I can't leave.",
        "James: Would you rather I take that boy and leave you? Because you see, little Jimmy and I are going far, far away where no one can find us. Now, you can join us or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How was I supposed to know that Holden lent Julia his car and that's why it was parked in front of her place?",
        "Jack: You weren't supposed to be anywhere near Julia's place. Why were you even there, Carly?",
        "Carly: I just told you. Holden was late coming home.",
        "Jack: Well, Holden's not your husband! What he does and who he sees and where he parks his car is none of your business!",
        "Carly: Jack, a wonderful marriage is falling apart. Why can't I care about that? Why can't I want to help Lily? What?",
        "Jack: I'm just wondering where I fit into your priorities. Now, we agreed that you were gonna try and stay clear of Julia for my sake.",
        "Carly: Well, I did try. And I just can't help it. I cannot stand that woman.",
        "Jack: Well, get over it! You know how much I adore J.J. And now I'm being kept from seeing a boy that's like a son to me because you can't put a lid on how much you hate his mother?",
        "Carly: Wait, that's not fair. All I did was let J.J. go to see a movie and that brother of hers reached for my throat. He's just trying to find some excuse to get me into trouble.",
        "Jack: You don't need any help in that department.",
        "Carly: Look, Jack, it's obvious that Julia hates my guts. But she loves her kid. She is not going to kick you out of his life. She's gonna let you see J.J.",
        "Jack: Oh, I hope so.",
        "Carly: Jack --",
        "Jack: I promised that he would always be my son, that he would never, ever be taken away from me. And I've let him down, Carly.",
        "Carly: Because of me. Where are you going?",
        "Jack: To Julia's to try to do some damage control.",
        "Carly: You sure you wanna go there now? Lily and Holden are probably still there.",
        "Jack: If Lily and Holden are still there, I'll respect their privacy. I just wish you had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I made you some tea.",
        "Julia: You're so good to me.",
        "Holden: Did you call the hospital?",
        "Julia: I did, but I feel guilty taking off from work.",
        "Holden: How's your neck?",
        "Julia: It's fine. She barely touched me.",
        "Holden: I feel so terrible.",
        "Julia: Hey, stop it. It's not your fault.",
        "Holden: No, I'm the one who put you in the middle of all this. But you know what? That was the last time. It's not going to happen again. Lily is not gonna come near you.",
        "Julia: Oh, really? And how do we know that? I mean, Holden, she knows where I live, she knows where I work. She's been following me for weeks.",
        "Holden: Just do me a favor. Just try and get some sleep, okay?",
        "Julia: Wait a minute. I took off of work. You're not even gonna stay with me?",
        "Holden: I'll be back. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Will and I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Barbara: Is that true, Will?",
        "Paul: Leave him alone. I can't believe you're just out, walking around free.",
        "Barbara: Because I'm innocent.",
        "Paul: Not by any stretch of the imagination.",
        "Barbara: You know what, Paul? You can't have it both ways. You can't believe Emily when she accuses me and then disbelieve her when she has said I am innocent.",
        "Paul: I don't care what Emily says. I know it was you.",
        "Will: Paul, just ignore Mom.",
        "Paul: Shut up. Don't say another word.",
        "Barbara: Why? What do you know? What do you not want him to tell me? Emily named someone, didn't she? And you didn't believe her. Because more than anything, you want me to be guilty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You promised if I got Barbara cleared, that you would give Cabot back to me.",
        "James: We are renegotiating.",
        "Rosanna: Why -- why are you doing this to me? What have I ever done to you?",
        "James: Rosanna, this has very little to do with you. I rather admire you. Except, for your taste in men, of course.",
        "Rosanna: Paul.",
        "James: My son was merely a disappointment. Then he decided to become my sworn enemy. I offered Paul everything a man could dream of. Now, he'll have nothing.",
        "Rosanna: You would force me to leave him?",
        "James: I'm offering you an invitation. You see, Paul really doesn't deserve you. And I've come to the sad realization that neither of my sons is worthy to carry on the Stenbeck name.",
        "Rosanna: What are you going to do to him?",
        "James: I'm not gonna kill him. I don't want him dead. I want him tormented.",
        "Rosanna: Look, I understand that Paul has disappointed you. We all have. But you have to understand that, for Cabot, it's better for him to be around a family and friends. And Paul and I can give him a normal life.",
        "James: Normal? Average? Not my grandson. My grandson is extraordinary. You want Paul? Fine. Fine. Say good-bye to your son.",
        "Rosanna: No. No, you can't do this.",
        "James: Oh, I can do it. And I have done it. Now you see, Rosanna, you have a choice. Your husband or your son. You can't have both.",
        "Rosanna: We can work something out. I'll do anything. I'll give you anything.",
        "James: Come on. Stop whining. You are a very savvy businesswoman. And you know that everything has its price. And the more precious, the more valuable something is -- the more you have to pay.",

        "Henry: Let's see. Were you going to use my date book to contact my former girlfriends?",
        "Katie: I can't tell you why I had it. It's a surprise.",
        "Henry: Oh, that's great. I love surprises. But I gotta tell you, Katie, I'm disappointed in you. I thought I taught to you to be sneakier than this. I mean, why bring the book downstairs? Why not go to my room, do whatever it is you were going to do, and then when you heard me come in, the book would still be right where I left it, and then I would be none the wiser. What's the matter?",
        "Katie: Okay, okay, okay! I will tell you what the surprise is.",
        "Henry: I knew I'd get to you. What?",
        "Katie: All right, what in this house, other than that date book and the clothes your closet, is yours?",
        "Henry: Uh -- nothing.",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Henry: That's a surprise because?",
        "Katie: 'Cause that's what I got you. Your stuff from storage.",
        "Henry: My stuff?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Henry: My martini glass collection? My black satin sheets? My Pamela Anderson poster?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Henry: That is so -- that's so sweet of you.",
        "Katie: How big is Pam?",
        "Henry: Well, you know, she's life-size.",
        "Katie: Then she's bunking in the garage.",
        "Henry: Okay, that's great. Why would you do something like this? This is wonderful.",
        "Katie: Because you surprised me with the most beautiful wedding ever. And you've really worked hard to make this feel like home since I've been back and I wanted it to feel like your home, too.",
        "Henry: This is starting to feel, like, really married.",
        "Katie: Well, you're not just renting a room anymore. You're my husband. This is our place.",
        "Henry: This is -- this has been the greatest 24 hours of my life. And it's our 24-hour anniversary.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Henry: Let's celebrate.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Henry: Go change, get some different clothes on and I will surprise you.",
        "Katie: Okay.",

        "Jennifer: My mother is forcing me to walk away from my dream, my company, my success. And everything was in place. And now she's going to reap all the benefits of it all, and I just hate it.",
        "Mike: So do something about it.",
        "Jennifer: Like what?",
        "Mike: Start a new company.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, sure, I've got a few minutes before dinner.",
        "Mike: I'm serious.",
        "Jennifer: Do you have any idea how hard it is to launch a fashion line?",
        "Mike: Sure. I watched you do it.",
        "Jennifer: But I had Worldwide to back me then.",
        "Mike: And now that you're a proven success, you can get someone else to back you.",
        "Jennifer: Babe, it's not that easy. I mean, do you know the failure rate is in this industry? I mean, Street Jeans was just, like, lightning in a bottle. It was a fluke.",
        "Mike: Jen, it was not a fluke. All right, you looked at a ripped-up pair of jeans and saw a million-dollar idea. If you did it once, you can do it again.",
        "Jennifer: What makes you so sure?",
        "Mike: Because you've got everything you need to succeed in here and here. Okay? And you can take all that talent and all that passion and have whatever you want. All right, you don't have to play second string to anybody. All right? Not Barbara or Craig Montgomery.",

        "Carly: Hey, what happened? Are you all right?",
        "Lily: I lost it!. I completely lost it!",
        "Carly: But Holden wasn't with Julia.",
        "Lily: I know. I didn't realize that until it was too late. She baited me. And I went for her throat.",
        "Carly: You really went for her throat?",
        "Lily: I really went for her throat. If Holden hadn't come in, I don't know what would've happened.",
        "Carly: He saw you?",
        "Lily: He did. And he pulled me off of her. Carly, he was so angry.",
        "Carly: Uh, it looks like you two might need to talk. So I'll go and keep the children occupied.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What the hell were you thinking?",
        "Lily: Oh, I told you, I wasn't thinking. I just reacted.",
        "Holden: You threatened her. Did you hear yourself? You said you wanted her to die.",
        "Lily: She ruined our lives. She took you away from me.",
        "Holden: No, you sent me away.",
        "Lily: I know. I know I put you through hell this past year, and I would do anything, believe me, anything to go back and do things differently. But, Holden, it's one bad year. Of all the years, the wonderful years that we've spent together, you're going to throw it away? All of it. One bad year. What has this woman done to you?",
        "Holden: She paid attention to me. And isn't it ironic that when she started caring about me, you conveniently remembered how much you love me?",
        "Lily: I do love you. I've always loved you. Holden, if you could just stop seeing her for a little while --",
        "Holden: No, no it's too late. The marriage is over. And before you get any more crazy ideas about bribing her to leave town, or blackmailing her, or anything like that --",
        "Lily: I did all of those things because I was desperate, Holden.",
        "Holden: Are you any less desperate now? I didn't think so. So that's why I'm here -- to make sure this harassment of Julia ends today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hi. Everything okay?",
        "Julia: You thought it wouldn't be?",
        "Jack: Well, I heard you might be having some trouble today with Lily.",
        "Julia: I did. But surprisingly, there's no blood on the walls or bodies on the floor.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Julia: Is that it?",
        "Jack: No, not quite. Can I come in for a second?",
        "Julia: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Thanks. Um -- I talked to your brother today. He came by the station, told me about J.J. breaking his leg. Is he all right?",
        "Julia: He's fine.",
        "Jack: Why didn't you call me, Julia?",
        "Julia: My brother doesn't think that J.J. should spend any more time with you.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. You told him he was wrong, right? I mean, J.J.'s my son.",
        "Julia: No, he's not, Jack. You didn't adopt him.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but I would have --",
        "Julia: We were never married.",
        "Jack: -- In a heartbeat! I love that kid. And let me tell you something, that kid loves me. You've got to talk to your brother.",
        "Julia: No, I don't. Jack, I'm sorry, but after what happened today, you don't belong in my son's life anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Come on, Will, let's get out of here.",
        "Will: I'm staying.",
        "Paul: I'm not leaving you alone here with her.",
        "Will: I don't need my big brother to protect me from my mother.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be a problem.",
        "Will: No, it wasn't your fault.",
        "Barbara: You know, I just came in for a cup of coffee. I didn't know you were here. I can go somewhere else.",
        "Will: No, it's a public place. Stay if you want.",
        "Barbara: I need to tell you something, honey. I've made some terrible, terrible choices these last months. I deserved to be locked up for helping James escape and then all the bizarre things I did after that, but I am -- I am very, very sorry for what I did.",
        "Will: You don't mean that.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes I do. And now that I am released, I know what a gift that is and I'm not going to take it for granted. And I know that Paul won't believe this, but I'm better. You don't believe it either, do you?",
        "Will: Some things never change, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Well, then how's this for change? I want you and your brother and your sister to live your own lives. I know now there's a difference between loving your children and controlling them.",
        "Will: When did you figure that out?",
        "Barbara: When I was under house arrest. I spent hours in that house remembering all the wonderful times that we had when you and Paul and Jennifer were growing up together and we were happy. I remembered the kind of mother that I was back then. I wasn't clingy or pushy or controlling. And even though you kids were growing up, and you started to pull away from me, I let you. And I was so proud of you. And I loved you, and you all loved me without me asking you to do it.",
        "Will: Yeah, I miss how we were.",
        "Barbara: Me, too. You know, I've reached out to Jennifer and I'm going to do the same thing to you. And I promise I won't push you, but I just want you to know that, if you need me, I'm here. And now I'm going to go over there and sit down and order something to eat. And you can do whatever you want.",
        "Will: Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I'll give you anything you want. I'll give you my company, all my money, everything that I have. Just don't make me choose between my husband and my son. I can't do it.",
        "James: Now Paul didn't have any problem. He didn't even think twice when he chose you over your son. And you hated him for it. You swore that you would choose Cabot over anything or anybody.",
        "Rosanna: Paul will never let go of me. He'll follow me. He'll never stop looking for me.",
        "James: No, we can't have that now, can we?",
        "Rosanna: No, we can't. My going with you will only put you in greater danger.",
        "James: Unless, of course, you're very convincing, very convincing when you tell him good-bye. That you no longer have any interest in being his wife.",
        "Rosanna: Please tell me how exactly how I'm going to convince him between lunch and dinner I've suddenly fallen out of love with him?",
        "James: Well, you've already laid the groundwork with your plan to free Barbara.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're talking about.",
        "James: Now that the truth is coming out, that you set up your own haunting, you're perfectly positioned, my dear. You can hurt Paul so badly, that he'll never want to see you again.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Holden: I'm taking Julia to the police station so she can petition a restraining order against you.",
        "Lily: You will go that far? You'd embarrass me like that? How could you do that?",
        "James: Make up your mind. Your husband or your son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Oh!",
        "Maid: Ms. Esteban, this package just came delivered to \"Dusty and Sierra Donovan\"?",
        "Dusty: Thank you, honey.",
        "Maid: Mr. and Mrs. --",
        "Dusty: That's from Stanley and Hazel from the spa.",
        "[Sierra laughs]",
        "Sierra: You know, it's just a joke. It's from some people that we met. It's really -- thank you. What is it?",

        "Mike: We were busy.",
        "Craig: Yes, I could tell that. Pardon me. Now, Jennifer, look, I haven't talked to Sierra yet. You could still change your mind.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not changing my mind.",
        "Craig: I'll help you handle bar-bar.",
        "Jennifer: I don't want any part of it, Craig.",
        "Craig: You want to see your dream wrecked by your mother? All those jeans creased, pressed, covered with taffeta?",
        "Jennifer: It's not my concern anymore. If Mom wants Street Jeans, then just let her have it. But she's not getting me in the deal.",
        "Craig: If you walk away from this now and you let her have this, you will be running away from her for the rest of your life.",
        "Mike: Okay, you know, that's enough. Jen has made up her mind. I'm not going sit here and let you try to strong-arm her into changing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: It's wonderful, isn't it? Having him in your arms again, hmm? Come on, Rosanna, make up your mind. Planes, boats and trains await to take us far, far away. Well, come on, little Jimmy. Let's say good-bye to the nice lady.",
        "Rosanna: I'll scream.",
        "James: No one would hear you. And that would upset our boy.",
        "Rosanna: The staff will hear me.",
        "James: The staff has been given the rest of the day off. I knew you wouldn't want to be interrupted with your first visit with Cabot. Rosanna, don't fight me. I will take this boy and you will never see him again. All right? Now, you got to make up your mind, your husband or your son?",
        "Paul: Rosanna?",

        "Dusty: Well, I don't think the Lakeview appreciates mud being tossed around the bathroom, so it's all yours.",
        "Sierra: Oh, come on. You know, I bet my mother has at least a dozen bathrooms on this property. And I'm sure she wouldn't mind letting me try some.",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Sierra: What's this one? Ooh, facial formula. I wonder if it's as good as it is at the spa. Oh, wow, look at that. Ooh, look at that. Oh, I have make-up on. How about you?",
        "Dusty: What, are you kidding me?",

        "Dusty: What about your mother's furniture? You crazy? You wanna tango with that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Mike, while I appreciate you have a certain fondness for Jennifer, this is business. This is Jennifer's business.",
        "Mike: And she's already told you she's quitting the company.",
        "Craig: But if she gives into her mother now, she will regret it for the rest of her life.",
        "Mike: No, she won't. Listen to me, man. This was a very difficult decision for Jen. But it was her decision, all right? She doesn't need any pressure or guilt trips from you. Right?",
        "Jennifer: I couldn't have said it better myself.",
        "Craig: All right, sweetheart. It's your dream. But when you remember everything you have coming up -- the new ad campaign, Scott Reeves all set -- it's going to be very hard to give up. Very tough to give in to your mother, letting this all fall apart just because you won't be there.",

        "Katie: Henry, no, no, no, no, no. We can't afford this.",
        "Henry: Katie, its two-for-one drink night. It's all the appetizers you can eat. It is the perfect dinner for our budget. Now, what do you say, wife?",
        "Katie: I'm with you, hubby.",
        "Henry: That's my girl.",
        "Jennifer: I have thought about all of those things and I will miss being part of it all. But Mike's right. I have made up my mind to go and nothing you can say will change that.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, one of the things we agreed on is that J.J. shouldn't have to suffer for the two of us not being together, Julia. Think about what this is going to do to him.",
        "Julia: I am. Jack, come on. Unlike your wife, I'm always thinking of what's best for J.J. And, unfortunately, right now, that means keeping him away from your wife.",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what? I'll talk to Carly. That's what I'll do.",
        "Julia: So we both know that you're just going to be wasting your breath, Jack!",
        "Jack: Maybe the three of us should discuss this then. If you, Carly and I sit down --",
        "Julia: No, I'm sorry! I've tried! I've tried, Jack. I've tried everything with Carly. I've tried making peace with her. I've tried staying out of her way. But no matter what I do, her and her little partner in crime are constantly coming at me, Jack! They stole from me. They insulted me. They assaulted me. No matter what I do, they just keep coming.",
        "Jack: Okay, I know you're frustrated, I do.",
        "Julia: I am so frustrated. What if J.J. had been here today when you wife sent Lily over here? What if my son had seen her try to strangle me?",
        "Jack: Lily tried to strangle you?",
        "Julia: It doesn't matter. I'm fine. But J.J. does matter, Jack. And you know what, I can't let me son be caught in the crossfire anymore. I'm sorry if you think that I'm doing this to punish you, because I swear to God, I'm not! No! Listen to me! I have to do what's best for him. And if you want to know who's responsible for this war, then you just look at that woman that you chose to spend every night, lying next to you in your bed.",

        "Lily: I'll apologize to Julia.",
        "Holden: Don't. Don't go near her.",
        "Lily: There's got to be something that I can do. I'm trying to save my family, our marriage. You have to help me.",
        "Holden: It's too late. I only came here because I wanted to warn you.",
        "Lily: Warn me?",
        "Holden: I'm taking Julia to the police station first thing tomorrow morning so she can petition for a restraining order against you. Nothing I say or do seems to keep you away from her, so maybe the thought of going to jail will.",
        "Lily: You would do that? You would go that far? You would embarrass me like that? How can you do that?",
        "Holden: What other choice do I have left? It's the only way I can think of to protect Julia from you, and to protect you from yourself.",

        "Will: I don't know what to believe, especially after Emily said that --",
        "Barbara: Emily said what?",
        "Will: Nothing.",

        "Will: What's wrong, Mom?",
        "Barbara: It's just so hard that my children seem to want me to be guilty.",
        "Will: No, it's not like that. It's just that --",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Will: Emily said -- she said that it was Rosanna who drugged her, and made her do all of those terrible things at Fairwinds.",
        "Barbara: Rosanna? Why would she do all of that to herself?",
        "Will: Paul thinks Emily's wrong.",
        "Barbara: And what do you think? Will, know this, I was made a scapegoat in this entire mess, just as when Rosanna blamed you for it. [Will sighs] And if you can believe in me just that much, that's all that matters to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rosanna! Rosanna, where are you? There you are. I've been looking all over for you, baby. What are you doing? Oh. Come here.",

        "Katie: I do not!",
        "Henry: All night long. Oh, yes, this ear, all night long. I don't even -- I'm never going to be able to hear out of this thing again. Look, there's nothing going on right there. [Bowl crashing] Mike! Hey. Hey, we're celebrating our one-day anniversary. Why don't you come over and join us for a drink.",
        "Craig: Looks like we've lost Mike.",

        "Jack: So what are you going to tell him?",
        "Julia: I don't know.",
        "Jack: Please, Julia, don't make him believe that -- that I didn't want him, that I didn't want to be with him, that I didn't want to be his father. Please.",
        "Julia: I'll figure something out.",
        "Jack: So what are you going to do? Are you gonna go back to Chicago with Keith or something?",

        "Carly: I heard. I'm so sorry.",
        "Lily: What am I going to do?",
        "Carly: That's a no-brainer. You are going to keep fighting. And I'm going to help you.",
        "Lily: How?",
        "Carly: By finding out what Julia's hiding. Something happened in El Paso, Lily, something she is not proud of. We are going to figure out what it is, and when we do, we are going to blow that woman out of the water.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I know what it's like to be blamed for something you didn't do. And I was wrong to do that to you, Mom.",
        "Barbara: It's okay.",
        "Will: No, I'm sorry. I wish I could take back some of the things I said.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: This was Cabot's, huh? I'm so sorry that this place keeps bringing up sad memories for you. I can't believe what Emily said. How could anybody believe that you would be capable of doing something like this to yourself? C'mon. Let's get out of here. What's going on? What?",
