        "Lily apologizes to Holden about how hard she was on him about Damian's disappearance, as she tells him about the ring and goodbye note Damian left for her, as Molly happens upon this conversation as well. Holden is happy to hear this news. Luke and Noah talk about their relationship and why Noah feels he has to move out. Luke doesn't really understand, but their conversation is interrupted when Margo arrives to tell Luke about Damian's body being recovered off of the Malta coast. Luke is very upset and Noah tries to comfort him, but Luke doesn't want him to stay out of guilt. Noah tries to help, but Luke is sure that he only will be around for a short time and then he will leave again because he feels he has to and he would rather deal with this alone if that is what Noah plans on doing. Craig talks to his business associate about putting all of his money into Monte Carlo after getting no bites on financial backing, as his associate, Ellis, is sure it is because he wants Carly back. Molly and Holden celebrate by getting a room at the Lakeview, as Holden is thrilled Damian is alive even though he hates him; he really was worried that he killed him. Molly and Holden wind up in bed and making plans to go see Abigail, which couldn't make Molly happier. Carly wants to tell Jack what she knows about Janet and Dusty, but they are interrupted by Janet, who tells Carly that they don't have time to talk because Liberty is back in the hospital. Carly is worried, but Janet isn't too concerned with her reaction; she is more concerned with telling her that she and Jack are going to have a baby for a match for Liberty. Jack tries to stop her and even explains why, but Carly is thrown and leaves quickly. Carly goes to see Craig talking a mile a minute when he wonders what is going on. She wants to drink, as Craig is able to find out why she is so rattled. In a roundabout way, he reinforces subtly that because of this new baby-to-be, her life with Jack is now over; Jack will always do the right thing. Jack and Janet discuss the baby, as Jack is clearly not on board because of the lifetime commitment, which is not loss on Janet who calls him on it claiming it is because of Carly. Jack promises to think about it. Margo finds a young boy on the docks and learns of Damian and another man fighting. Luke tells Lily about Damian, but Lily won't believe it. She is adamant there has been a mistake and calls Margo to tell her about the ring. Inadvertently, she tells Margo that Holden saw Damian on the docks and Margo puts together that the boy saw Holden and Damian fighting and goes to find Holden. Holden is shocked to learn Damian is dead, as Molly doesn't want him to talk. Holden finally admits to fighting and seeing Damian on the docks. Margo takes Holden into the station, as Lily and Luke show up; Lily insists that Holden tell Margo that he wasn't involved. Craig and Jack have another bit of a showdown, as Craig gloats about knowing about news of the baby. Jack wants Craig to back off, but Craig tells him that he has his priorities now with the new baby and Carly can't be one of them. Janet and Carly run into one another, as Janet tells Carly that she appreciates what she did for Liberty, but she wants her now to stay away from her Jack. Carly doesn't understand, so Janet spells it out; she is spending too much time with Jack. She won't let her threaten her family right now when that is all she cares about to survive. Carly snaps and explains that Janet is talking to the wrong person about her marriage. She is ruining her marriage all on her own; she should be having this conversation with her boyfriend, Dusty, as Janet looks stunned."

        "Lily: Thank you for coming, Holden.",
        "Holden: I would have stopped by the house. I was planning on driving by.",
        "Lily: I know, I know, but I wanted to meet you on neutral territory, and I didn't want us to be interrupted.",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Lily: I wanted to apologize. I asked a lot of questions about Damian's disappearance, and I would understand if you resented me for it.",
        "Holden: Lily, its okay. Listen --",
        "Lily: Holden -- Holden, let me finish. You have every right to be angry. And you were angry. I jumped to conclusions, but you didn't know any more about what happened than I did, and I realize that now, and I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: What changed your mind?",
        "Lily: Damian sent me this.",
        "Holden: Where did you get this?",
        "Lily: I found it on the patio this morning. I tried to figure out how it got there, but there weren't any markings on the envelope. So, Damian must have got it there secretly.",
        "Holden: Well, he'd have to. The police still thinking that he might come back, they're watching the house, and --",
        "Lily: He's too careful to let that happen. The important thing is he's alive. He's out there somewhere. He's finally letting us go.",
        "Holden: How do you feel about that?",
        "Lily: I'm fine. It was driving me crazy not knowing what had happened to him, but this is closure. He's never coming back, and I'll never see him again.",
        "Holden: I'd say I was sorry, but --",
        "Lily: You're not a liar, Holden. Not even Damian could turn you into one. He's done so much damage to our family. I'm happy that he's out of our lives. I mean, it's for the best. I can start over again.",
        "Molly: Hey, you two.",
        "Holden: Hi.",
        "Molly: I was walking by and I saw you with your heads together. Am I interrupting?",
        "Holden: No, not at all. Lily was just telling me good news.",
        "Molly: Well, don't keep me waiting. I definitely could use some of that.",
        "Holden: Damian's alive.",
        "Molly: I knew it! Oh, God. Holden, I'm so happy. Didn't I tell you it would all be okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You need help with anything?",
        "Noah: No, it's fine. This is the last of it. Maddie's gonna be here in half an hour or so.",
        "Luke: Noah, are you sure about this?",
        "Noah: Yeah. Luke, I got to get my life back together, and I can't do that unless I'm on my own.",
        "Luke: Well, you weren't on your own earlier, and your life was pretty awesome. I mean, at least I thought it was.",
        "Noah: Yeah, Luke. No, it was amazing, but I'm not that guy anymore. I've got to learn how to do everything all over again, and you can't stand that.",
        "Luke: Oh, that's bull. You're the one that can't stand it.",
        "Noah: No. That -- that's not what I mean. You can't sit there and watch me screw up on something simple without needing to jump in. And I know you try to help, and I love you for that, but I'm not gonna learn how to do anything with you there t-o just do it for me.",
        "Luke: Well, how about you stay and I'll leave you alone?",
        "Noah: You won't, and I won't want you to. It's difficult enough for me to button a shirt right now without having to deal with the emotional stuff, too. That's why Dr. Oliver wanted you to keep your distance.",
        "Luke: Actually, I think it's 'cause he hates me.",
        "Noah: Yeah. That, too. But if I'm gonna go through the surgery and all the rehab that comes afterwards, I need to be able to focus on myself, and I can't --",
        "Luke: No, no. You know what, Noah? I get it. I'm in your way. So go. Move in with your ex-girlfriend. Sounds fantastic.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Luke: Margo.",
        "Margo: Hi.",
        "Luke: Hi. Come in.",
        "Margo: Hi, Noah.",
        "Noah: Hey.",
        "Margo: Luke, is your mother here?",
        "Luke: No. Why?",
        "Margo: I was hoping to talk to the two of you together.",
        "Luke: What happened?",
        "Margo: I'm really sorry to have to tell you this, but I got a call from the authorities in Malta.",
        "Luke: Malta?",
        "Margo: Yes. A body was recovered, and the remains have been positively ID'd as Damian Grimaldi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I must have talked to a dozen investors. Carly had the first two collections already sketched. She had fabric swatches. She even made up a couple of samples. And you know how sound our business plan is.",
        "Ellis: So, what's the upshot? Any bites?",
        "Craig: Oh, everyone was super nice, respectful, impressed. One guy wanted to take one of the samples to give to his girlfriend. I mean, we couldn't have asked for a better response. Nobody wants to throw a dime into start-up these days.",
        "Ellis: Why don't you let me start to look at some other business opportunities?",
        "Craig: How much can I pull together if I liquidate my assets? And I mean everything.",
        "Ellis: Enough to justify a numbered account in the Caymans.",
        "Craig: We won't need that.",
        "Ellis: No.",
        "Craig: I'm gonna put everything into Monte Carlo. If I can't find a backer for this company, I'm gonna do it myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack, this isn't something that I wanted to have to tell you. Well, that's not exactly true. I want you to know it. You do need to know it. I just didn't want it to be me who had to tell you at a time like this.",
        "Jack: Carly, what are you talking about?",
        "Carly: Oh, boy. Okay. I don't quite know how to say this, Jack, but --",
        "[Janet clears throat]",
        "Janet: What's going on?",
        "Carly: I came to tell Jack what's been happening.",
        "Janet: I'm sure what you think you have to say is important, but now is not a good time.",
        "Carly: Why don't we let Jack decide?",
        "Jack: Liberty's back in the hospital.",
        "Carly: Is she okay?",
        "Janet: No, she's not, but you already knew that.",
        "Carly: Janet, would you just -- just tell me what happened to her?",
        "Jack: She has a fever. Ordinarily, that wouldn't be a big deal, but there's an outbreak of chick pox going on at the high school. Liberty hasn't had chicken pox yet, so Dr. Hearn admitted her just to be safe.",
        "Janet: And her immune system has already been compromised. So, they don't want to take any chances. Thank God I've already had the chicken pox.",
        "Carly: But Jack hasn't.",
        "Jack: Exactly. That's why Dr. Hearn wants me to keep my distance for a few days.",
        "Janet: And I am here getting her some books and things so she won't be bored. So, if you have something to say --",
        "Carly: You know what? I can just stay here and talk to Jack if you want to go on ahead. That's fine.",
        "Janet: No. I need him with me. I don't know if you've heard, but her chemo hasn't been working. So they've had to stop treatments until they find something better.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I wish there was something I could do to help.",
        "Janet: Actually, we're helping ourselves.",
        "Jack: We should probably get going.",
        "Janet: Oh, Carly's an interested party. She should know what we're doing.",
        "Jack: There's a lot of things we need to work out first.",
        "Janet: The best way for us to find a bone-marrow match is through a sibling.",
        "Carly: Right. I thought that Jacob wasn't a match.",
        "Janet: He's not.",
        "Jack: Let's not talk about this right now.",
        "Janet: But everybody's gonna find out sooner or later, Jack. Jack and I are going to have a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Are they sure that the body is Damian's?",
        "Margo: Yeah. I'm sorry, Luke.",
        "Luke: Are you handling the investigation?",
        "Margo: No, no. The body was found within 12 miles of the coast. So, the authorities in Malta are handling it.",
        "Luke: How did he die?",
        "Margo: They're not really certain. The body had been in the water for quite some time, so there wasn't a lot of evidence left, and from what the coroner could piece together, he's fairly certain that there was foul play involved.",
        "Luke: I can't believe it.",
        "Margo: Really? 'Cause you came down to the station wondering how your father had disappeared.",
        "Luke: Well, I know. When -- when they found that wallet in the water, I knew something was wrong, but I didn't have any proof. I was hoping I was just being paranoid.",
        "Margo: Well, they want to work fairly closely with us. So, if you do have any information about his last days --",
        "Luke: His last days. That just makes it sound so final. You know, my dad, Damian, hasn't been in my life for that long, but, I mean, to think that he's not coming back --",
        "Margo: You know what? You don't have to talk about this right now.",
        "Luke: No, I do. I do, Margo. I want to remember everything. The last time I saw Damian was at his office. He was headed to the pier where they board the freighters. He had put me in charge of his company when he left, and if I had known that that was the last time that I was gonna see him -- I'm sorry, Margo. I can't.",
        "Margo: No. It's all right. It's all right. If you remember anything else, please --",
        "Luke: I'll call you.",
        "Margo: Yeah. Would you like me to stay and help explain things to your mom?",
        "Luke: No. No. Thank you, but I think I should do that.",
        "Margo: All right. When you do and she's ready for it, would you please bring her down to the station?",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Margo: Well, there's a lot of matters that we have to clear up, and I need to ask her some questions.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Margo: I'm really sorry for your loss.",
        "Luke: Thank you.",
        "Noah: Luke. I'm right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I just wanted to tell you about Damian.",
        "Holden: Well, thank you. I appreciate that.",
        "Lily: And now that you know, I should be getting home, in case the kids need help.",
        "Holden: Well, hold on. Our food hasn't come yet.",
        "Lily: Well, that's okay. I'm sure Molly doesn't mind my leftovers.",
        "Molly: Ouch.",
        "Holden: Listen, I'm relieved to know that Damian's okay. Not only for your sake but for Luke's, as well.",
        "Lily: Look, I know I was aggressive in trying to find out the truth about Damian. I hope you know I didn't do it to hurt you.",
        "Holden: No. I know that. I guess I was just hoping that you could find a way to pretend that Damian never existed, but now I know that's not possible.",
        "Lily: All that matters now is Damian's gone and he won't be coming back, which means Luke and I can move on. We all can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, you don't need to tattoo rule number one on my forehead. Only an idiot puts everything he has into a risky business venture. On the other hand, fortune favors the bold, and it's only temporary. Carly and I learned from our mistakes the last time around. She just needs enough capital to get the company on its feet.",
        "Ellis: You mean to get Carly off her feet.",
        "Craig: Ellis, don't be crass.",
        "Ellis: Come on, be honest. Is this business or pleasure?",
        "Craig: Well, I don't really see the difference.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Are you pregnant?",
        "Janet: Not yet.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: But you're trying to have a child together?",
        "Janet: To save Liberty's life.",
        "Jack: There's a lot we need to discuss first.",
        "Janet: What's there to discuss? Our child would be her closest genetic match. I know this is the answer, Jack. This baby will save Liberty's life.",
        "Carly: I have to go. You should get to the hospital.",
        "Jack: You wanted to tell me something. What was it?",
        "Carly: No. It's just something about Sage. Something about school for Sage. It can wait.",
        "Jack: Why did you do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I feel like I should make some plans, do something.",
        "Noah: Luke, I think you need to tell your mom first.",
        "Luke: What am I gonna say to her?",
        "Noah: I don't know. The truth. And I will be here for you, okay. I don't need to leave today. I will stay as long as you need me.",
        "Luke: Noah, don't change your plans because of me.",
        "Noah: Come on, Luke. Don't be like that.",
        "Luke: You were on your way out that door. So go on. Maddie's waiting.",
        "Noah: Look, I'm not gonna leave you while you're still so upset.",
        "Luke: I don't want you to stay with me because you pity me.",
        "Noah: I don't pity you! Luke, I love you!",
        "Luke: Noah, you've been pushing me away for months, and now that my father dies, you all of a sudden remember how much you love me? No! You just don't want to be the bad guy!",
        "Noah: Well, maybe I'm just telling the truth now.",
        "Luke: What about your independence?",
        "Noah: That is not important right now.",
        "Luke: Well, what about your surgery? You didn't think about that, did you?",
        "Noah: I can work that out.",
        "Luke: You know what? Don't bother, because even if I did let you stay, once I felt better, you'd be right out that door.",
        "Noah: I wouldn't!",
        "Luke: Yeah! You'd like to think that, but you would, Noah! You would! I know you! You would leave. And yet I still love you.",
        "Noah: I love you, too! Why don't you believe me?",
        "Luke: I do! But it doesn't matter! Noah, you need to make a decision. Either you're with me for good or you're not, and if you're not, I'm gonna find a way to get through this on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: This is so decadent.",
        "Holden: We deserve it. Plus, I didn't want to drink champagne out at the farm, not with everything that Janet and Liberty are going through.",
        "Molly: Okay. They're not Waterford, but I think they'll do. You're good at this.",
        "Holden: Okay. To -- to Damian.",
        "Molly: Really?",
        "Holden: Yeah. I hate that lousy S.O.B., but I am so happy that he's alive.",
        "Molly: Me too. But next time, please stick a stake through his heart, if you can find it.",
        "Holden: I really did think that I killed him.",
        "Molly: Thank God you didn't. Aren't you glad you didn't confess to something you didn't do?",
        "Holden: You were right. Thank you.",
        "Molly: Don't. I have so much to make up for with you.",
        "Holden: Let's just call it even, okay?",
        "Molly: Are you sure?",
        "Holden: Positive. Thank you for sticking by me.",
        "Molly: This is what I wanted, to see you happy. No more worries. It's over. You don't have to think about Damian anymore, and now, if you want to, we can move on with our lives together, if you think that that's a good thing.",
        "Holden: I think it's a very good thing.",
        "Molly: You do? Because I would totally understand if you want me to back off.",
        "Holden: Oh, no.",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Holden: You talk too much.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey. Excuse me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute. You haven't done anything wrong, Honey. I just want to ask you a few questions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke, what's wrong?",
        "Luke: Mom, I have to tell you something.",
        "Lily: I have to tell you something, too. Good news. Look.",
        "Luke: That's Damian's.",
        "Lily: Yes. I found it outside this morning with this note.",
        "Luke: I don't understand.",
        "Lily: It means your father's all right. He's saying goodbye. He won't be back. But at least he's out there somewhere. He's alive. Luke, I thought you'd be glad.",
        "Luke: Mom, Damian couldn't have sent you this.",
        "Lily: Why not?",
        "Luke: Margo just came by. She -- she said that --",
        "Lily: She said what?",
        "Luke: She said that they found Damian's body at sea. He's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Carly. What a nice surprise.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, now that we have all the money we need to get Monte Carlo up and running again, I really think that we should go over the business plan, you know? Fiddle with it a little bit. So, maybe we should go to supper and talk about it, huh?",
        "Craig: Yeah, sure. I'll call down and get us a table.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, you know what? No. We can't do that, because I don't have any food in the fridge for the kids at home, but you could come to my house. No. That's probably not a good idea, either. Okay. Well, you know what I'll do? I'll just go back home and think on it, and then I'll give you a call or e-mail you or maybe even pop back over.",
        "Craig: Carly, Carly. What's going on with you?",
        "Carly: Hey, you know what? I just want to show you something that I was thinking about, because I want you to hear about --",
        "Craig: Carly, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. What's wrong?",
        "Carly: I want a drink so badly, I'm crawling out of my skin.",
        "Craig: Okay. Okay. What can I do?",
        "Carly: You could just be your slimy self. Because I would never give you the satisfaction of seeing me fall off the wagon. So, if I just stay with you --",
        "Craig: You'll stay sober.",
        "Carly: You're the lesser of two evils.",
        "Craig: Thanks.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: I'm too exhausted to lie.",
        "Craig: What brought this on?",
        "Carly: Well, what the hell. You're gonna hear anyway. Jack and Janet are gonna have a baby.",
        "Craig: You're kidding.",
        "Carly: No. I went to the farm to tell Jack that Janet -- to talk to him, and Janet practically smacked me in the face with the happy news.",
        "Craig: Is she pregnant already?",
        "Carly: No, but she will be soon. She just wants to be sure that there's a bone-marrow match for Liberty if the chemo fails.",
        "Craig: Oh. I see.",
        "Carly: I can't even complain about this without seeming like some kind of selfish witch. What am I supposed to do here? Of course I want Liberty to get better, you know, but I --",
        "Craig: But you love Jack.",
        "Carly: How do I trump a dying kid?",
        "Craig: You don't. You shut up and take it.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm not good at being noble, and suffering in silence just ain't my bag.",
        "Craig: Join the club. Look, I know -- I know you're hurting, but I can't help but say this could be the best thing that could possibly happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why would you do that? Why would you tell Carly we were thinking about having a baby when we haven't even decided on that ourselves?",
        "Janet: There's nothing to decide. Liberty's life is depending on it.",
        "Jack: No, it's not, Janet! Dr. Hearn is changing up her chemo. He hasn't called it quits, and he hasn't mentioned anything about a bone-marrow transplant for a while now. Okay, if it gets to that point, then yes, we will have to make a decision.",
        "Janet: But it takes nine months to have a baby, and who knows how long it'll take me to get pregnant?",
        "Jack: Janet --",
        "Janet: No! I will not stand by while Liberty's leukemia gets worse!",
        "Jack: Okay, I know you're scared, I do, and I would do anything for Liberty, but this is a life-altering decision we're talking about!",
        "Janet: For Liberty it is.",
        "Jack: What about the baby? What if he or she turns out not to be a match? What happens then?",
        "Janet: That's a chance I'm willing to take!",
        "Jack: No, no! If this happens -- I'm not saying yes. If this happens, then we have to check with Dr. Hearn to make sure it's even feasible.",
        "Janet: No, we don't need to check with Dr. Hearn for anything.",
        "Jack: What about your beliefs? Where does the Catholic Church stand on having a baby for the sole purpose of saving the life of someone else?",
        "Janet: Jack, it's a baby, and we will love it no matter what.",
        "Jack: We talked about this.",
        "Janet: I will not let Liberty go without a fight.",
        "Jack: We talk -- there are plenty of ways to fight this, believe me.",
        "Janet: Why don't you just admit what's really going on here. I see the way you and Carly look at each other when I walk in to the room.",
        "Jack: Oh, please. I have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Janet: Okay. Then let me spell it out for you. Having a baby is a huge commitment, not just for the baby but for the mother, too, and I know that you would do anything to save Liberty's life, except make a commitment to me.",
        "Jack: Don't make this about Carly. You're talking about bringing another human being into the world -- not a donor, not a sibling -- a child, Janet.",
        "Janet: Don't you think I know that?",
        "Jack: No. I think you're so worried about Liberty that you're not thinking very straight.",
        "Janet: What am I supposed to think with my child lying in a hospital bed fighting for her life?",
        "Jack: You're terrified. You're terrified, and you have every right to be.",
        "Janet: I don't know what else to do. Jack, the odds are against us. We're not gonna find another donor unless we do something about it. Please don't say no.",
        "Jack: Just let me think about it. Let me think about it, okay? This isn't just about Liberty. This is about the rest of our lives.",
        "Janet: You're right, and I know you're not the type of guy that makes snap decisions, okay? So, I also know that if we decide to do this, you will be with me all the way.",
        "Jack: I promise you that.",
        "Janet: So you'll think about it?",
        "Jack: I will.",
        "Janet: Okay. Thank you. I'm gonna go get these books to Liberty right now, but maybe when I come back, we can talk some more about this, okay?",
        "Jack: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, please. Spare me the \"Everything happens for a reason\" speech, because even if it's true, it doesn't mean the reason is good.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm not talking hypothetical's, Carly. This is reality. Something always drives you and Jack apart, and yet you keep going back for more. I mean, when's it gonna be enough?",
        "Carly: You don't understand us.",
        "Craig: Actually, I do. But you don't have to listen to me. You can call Parker, Molly. Call Rosanna in Germany. I'm sure she'd love to weigh in on the subject.",
        "Carly: I do not need to take a poll to know what's best for me.",
        "Craig: Apparently you do. You're still bouncing back and forth with Jack, and you're acting as if you believe things are gonna work out between you.",
        "Carly: Well, they still could.",
        "Craig: He's married, Carly, and from the looks of things, he's gonna stay that way.",
        "Carly: Well, if Liberty gets better --",
        "Craig: And she will. Liberty is gonna make it. But then what? Jack and Janet will have a new kid to take care of. Well, there goes the next 18 years. How long are you gonna pine after him?",
        "Carly: I'm not pining.",
        "Craig: You're making yourself crazy, and for what? Janet is never gonna stop needing Jack, and Jack is never gonna stop being there for her. He's a stand- up guy.",
        "Carly: He doesn't love her.",
        "Craig: We both know that's not true. It may not be the crazy love that the two of you once had, but he's devoted to her.",
        "Carly: Because she's got a sick kid.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Craig: The reason doesn't matter. He's not leaving her.",
        "Carly: Shut up, okay?",
        "Craig: I'm sorry. I know this isn't easy for you to hear, but Jack doesn't belong to you anymore, and he's never going to. What you had is gone.",
        "Carly: No. But it will be if he and Janet have a baby together, 'cause he's a good father, and he would never leave her, and Janet knows that. So, this isn't even just about saving Liberty. She wants to save her marriage. I couldn't have done it better myself.",
        "Craig: Well, if Janet has Jack's kid, a piece of him will always belong to her.",
        "Carly: Yep. And how can I compete with that? Oh! Oh, stop! You're so typical! Completely inappropriate! I'll call you about the business plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You're right. This was a very good idea.",
        "Molly: It was all my idea. Do you know, when I came back to Oakdale, I never dreamed this would happen?",
        "Holden: Never?",
        "Molly: Busted. Okay. Never is an exaggeration. I dreamed about it maybe once or twice, but I just figured it was a total fantasy.",
        "Holden: And now?",
        "Molly: It's real, and I still can't believe it.",
        "Holden: Maybe this will help.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. I didn't quite get that. You know what? Maybe it's good that I don't believe it, because I'll never, ever take you for granted.",
        "Holden: You know what? You've never taken anything for granted. Maybe that's because you haven't had things handed to you. That's one of the things that makes you so beautiful.",
        "Molly: Thank you.",
        "Holden: It's true.",
        "Molly: You know how they say that you never completely get over the father of your child? Whoever they are, they are so right.",
        "Holden: Only 'cause you're connected with your kids, but it's not the same thing as love. Not in every case.",
        "Molly: What about our case?",
        "Holden: Actually, I've been thinking about that.",
        "Molly: You have?",
        "Holden: Yeah. I was thinking we should go visit Abigail like we talked about.",
        "Molly: Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: I take it that's a yes?",
        "Molly: Yes, yes, yes! Oh, my God. I don't remember the last time that I was so happy.",
        "Holden: Well, then, it's time. It's time.",

        "Margo: See, there you go, Arthur. You are officially a deputy now. That means you're safe, because we take care of our own. Oh, but look at you. You're still so scared. Why is that? Is somebody after you?",
        "Arthur: It's like I told the other lady.",
        "Margo: Wait a minute. What other lady? What -- what other lady?",
        "Arthur: She asked me about the men in the fight.",
        "Margo: Hey, had you ever seen these men before? No? What happened, huh?",
        "Arthur: I didn't see it all because I was hiding.",
        "Margo: Good idea. I would have done the same thing. But why don't you tell me about what you did see, you know, at the end.",
        "Arthur: One was on the boat and one ran away.",
        "Margo: So, the guy on the boat, was he moving at all?",
        "Arthur: I don't think so. He was bleeding really bad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Damian can't be dead. He sent me this note to let me know he's okay.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe he had somebody else send it. Maybe he sent it before whatever happened.",
        "Lily: So, you think it's true? He's really dead?",
        "Luke: They found his body off the coast of Malta. The police did tests. They confirmed that it was him. Margo thinks that he was murdered.",
        "Lily: I don't believe it.",
        "Luke: Mom.",
        "Lily: No, Luke, we've been through this before with Holden. I knew he wasn't dead, and I let people convince me that I was too grief-stricken to know my own heart. I'm not gonna do it again.",
        "Luke: What are you doing?",
        "Lily: I'm calling Margo. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.",

        "Margo: Oh, Arthur, this is just gonna take a minute, okay? Lieutenant Hughes.",
        "Lily: Margo, its Lily. Luke told me what happened, that they think they found Damian's body, that they think he was murdered?",
        "Margo: I'm so sorry for your loss.",
        "Lily: Don't be. This is some kind of mistake. Damian's not dead. He sent me a message, a note.",
        "Margo: Through the mail?",
        "Lily: No. It came here to the house this morning.",
        "Margo: Do you still have what it came in, an envelope?",
        "Lily: Yes, of course. I'll bring it by the station. Damian got away. He's not dead. Holden was right when he said he saw him get on that freighter.",
        "Margo: Holden was on the docks with Damian before he left?",
        "Lily: Yeah. But so what?",
        "Margo: I just -- I didn't know that.",
        "Lily: Damian is in hiding. He's not dead. The police in Malta have made a huge mistake.",

        "Lily: I'm sure of it!",
        "Margo: All right. Okay, okay. Just bring everything you have into the station, and we'll discuss it later.",

        "Holden: You know, we didn't need to go to the Lakeview. This place is deserted.",
        "Molly: Yeah, right. Give it a few minutes. Somebody will show up. With the number of people who pass through here every day, it's like Emma's the mayor of a small town.",
        "Holden: Hmm. Except everyone's related.",
        "Molly: A small, deeply incestuous town.",

        "Margo: Damian Grimaldi is dead.",
        "Holden: That's not possible.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm afraid it is. His body was recovered off the coast of Malta.",
        "Holden: Are you sure about that?",
        "Margo: The authorities there ID'd it. The remains are definitely his. And, Holden, I understand that you were the last person to see him alive.",

        "Jack: Oh. She's not here. I'll tell her you stopped by.",
        "Craig: I heard congratulations is in order.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Craig: The baby, the one you and Janet are gonna have. Nothing more special than a bouncy, new bundle of joy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Oh, hi. I, um -- I was just dropping some things off for Liberty if she's gonna be stuck here for a while. Just some magazines and some sketching homework. She's asleep, so I left it with the nurse.",
        "Janet: Thank you.",
        "Carly: She's gonna be an excellent fashion designer one day. I'll be proud to say I was there in the beginning.",
        "Janet: Well, I'm glad you're showing an interest in her future, seeing as I am doing everything I can to make sure she still has one.",
        "Carly: Right. Well, like I said, if there's anything else I can do --",
        "Janet: Oh, you've done enough.",
        "Carly: Excuse me?",
        "Janet: I appreciate all the time you have spent with Liberty since she's been sick. But now I just want you to leave my family alone.",
        "Carly: Uh, well, Janet, we've -- we've talked about this. Liberty needs to stay focused on the future, doesn't she? It's helping her fight her illness.",
        "Janet: I'm too exhausted to be polite right now. Carly, you're spending too much time with my husband, and I want it to stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Have you talked to Lily today?",
        "Margo: Yes, a while ago.",
        "Holden: Okay, well, I saw her earlier, and she has proof that Damian's alive. He contacted her. Didn't she tell you that?",
        "Margo: Yes, she did.",
        "Molly: So how can you stand there and say that Damian's dead?",
        "Margo: According to the authorities in Malta --",
        "Holden: No, no. There's got to be some kind of mistake.",
        "Margo: I'm afraid not.",
        "Molly: Lily was positive that note she got was from Damian.",
        "Margo: Yes, and she'll be bringing that note into the station in a while.",
        "Molly: So Lily's the one with the evidence. Why are you talking to Holden? You should be following up with Lily.",
        "Margo: You know what, Molly? This is not a press conference. I'm here to talk to Holden.",
        "Molly: What exactly are you looking for?",
        "Holden: Molly, Molly, back off.",
        "Molly: Just be careful what you say.",
        "Holden: What do you want to know?",
        "Margo: I have an eyewitness that places you at the docks with Damian shortly before he disappeared. And according to this witness, you and Damian got into a rather violent conversation. It got physical. Damian ended up unconscious, covered in blood on the deck of a Grimaldi freighter. Is that true?",
        "Molly: Don't answer. I'm calling a lawyer.",
        "Margo: Holden, is that true? Is that what happened?",
        "Holden: Yes.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What Janet and I choose or choose not to do is none of your business.",
        "Craig: But anything Carly and I do is your business?",
        "Jack: Because you're toxic.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's right. I forgot. You had nothing to do with her drinking. That was all me.",
        "Jack: Well, you were the one that was there, here.",
        "Craig: And you weren't. Which in Carly's case is really the bigger problem.",
        "Jack: Oh, I see what this is, Craig. You got to stop this. You're not gonna get her back.",
        "Craig: Carly and I are starting a business together. It's not the same commitment as a new family, but it does require some personal contact.",
        "Jack: Get an office.",
        "Craig: How do you do it, Jack? How do you keep two magnificent women on the hook?",
        "Jack: You would know a thing about it.",
        "Craig: I know children don't save marriages. You have them for the wrong reasons, it just leads to 18 years of anger and resentment.",
        "Jack: I'm doing okay, which is more than I can say for you. At least I don't walk away from my responsibilities.",
        "Craig: No one can say Jack Snyder's not reliable. I'm counting on you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Janet, I -- I did not come here to pick a fight with you. I care about Liberty. I know that she needs all the encouragement she can get. That's why I'm here. Besides, you asked me to be a part of her team.",
        "Janet: That was before I knew you'd use her as an excuse to get closer to Jack.",
        "Carly: Pardon me?",
        "Janet: You heard me.",
        "Carly: Well, you hear this. I don't need to use a sick kid to see Jack.",
        "Janet: Stay away from him, Carly. I am warning you.",
        "Carly: You know what? I don't really want to do this here.",
        "Janet: Well, that's too bad, because there are only two things that matter to me in this world. One is my daughter, and the other is my marriage. And I will not let you threaten either one of them.",
        "Carly: I'm the threat?",
        "Janet: He's over you, Carly. There are plenty of other men in this world. Find yourself another one. Stay away from mine.",
        "Carly: Janet, you do not need me to destroy your marriage. You're doing a bang-up job of that on your own.",
        "Janet: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Carly: If you really want to save your relationship with Jack, why don't you go and speak the speech to the person who really needs to hear it?",
        "Janet: I have no idea what you're talking about.",
