        "Carly: Will you get any meal at all?",
        "Jack: I grabbed a sandwich on the way in. If they ask me to go out on patrol, then I get a meal break",
        "Carly: Well, that's one good thing about being back in uniform. It was a joke, Jack.",
        "Jack: Right.",

        "Carly: Chances are he'll fall on his face. Besides you're smarter, and you have more contacts. You know how to connect the dots, Jack. You know how to take anonymous tips and evidence you already have and put it together. And you never know when that piece that makes everything fit will show up. You see the whole case, Jack. That's always been your strength.",
        "Jack: You don't have to be my cheerleader all the time, you know?",
        "Carly: Well, what if I want to? What if being your cheerleader is exactly what I want right now?",
        "Jack: Yeah? Well, then maybe you can get a little outfit, like valentine's day?",

        "Madame Lacoste: About what?",
        "Jennifer: About this scam you've been pulling on me, trying to convince me that my brother is alive.",

        "Jennifer: Please. All your premonitions and visions from the psychic world? Yeah, that's -- that's the truth?",
        "Madame Lacoste: No. My spirit guides gave me nothing about your brother.",

        "Holden: Are they true?",
        "Meg: Not exactly, but close enough. Look, I can't make excuses, okay? I wouldn't. They were my choices, my life.",
        "Holden: Meg, where are you really going? Do you even know?",

        "Dusty: Well, if you won't tell me, I gotta wonder if anything you've said is true.",
        "Emily: It's all true! For God's sake, it's true. I will tell you it. Oh!",
        "Dusty: You have a problem, right?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: If you don't want the cops to know that you found Paul, they're not gonna hear it from me.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I just -- I have to know for sure.",
        "Dusty: His whereabouts? They're not gonna hear that from me either. And nobody's gonna listen to Paul. They're gonna be too busy locking him up.",
        "Emily: Yeah, right. Yeah, that's what you'd think, you know? I mean, you would love to see him locked away for the rest of his miserable life, but that's not gonna happen.",
        "Dusty: Why not? He was set to go on trial before he disappeared.",
        "Emily: Yeah, right, for breaking and entering -- breaking into the records room at the hospital. But his real crime was what he did to Jennifer. It nearly killed her. But wait, what's -- it's barely a felony. He's gonna -- six months, tops. And Jennifer, she's probably gonna testify on his behalf, right? Because she's already forgiven him for everything. You know I'm right. And he's gonna stroll back into town, starting all over with his new little girlfriend, Meg. You two can double date.",
        "Dusty: Doesn't hurt me any.",
        "Emily: But they could hurt Jennifer.",
        "Dusty: They could try.",
        "Emily: You'd need to be on guard every day, because Paul will do everything he can to get right in the middle of Jennifer's life.",
        "Dusty: Well, that can't happen.",
        "Emily: No, it can't.",
        "Dusty: What are you saying, Emily?",
        "Emily: You need to make sure Paul stays out of Jennifer's life permanently.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Madame Lacoste: Who is Meg Snyder?",
        "Jennifer: Dusty saw her paying you, so don't even try.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Oh, of course. That was Meg.",
        "Jennifer: Yes, that was Meg. Did she use a different name or something?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Well, she didn't give me her name.",
        "Jennifer: But you can still identify her in court?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Court?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, court. That woman is going to jail for fraud.",
        "Madame Lacoste: She hurt you before this.",
        "Jennifer: Yes, she did hurt me. But worse, she hurt Dusty, because he feels completely responsible for what Meg did to me. And that -- that's not fair. He doesn't deserve that. So I want this woman gone before she can hurt him again.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Well, she cares about him. I can see that much.",
        "Jennifer: What did Meg tell you to do?",
        "Madame Lacoste: She didn't.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, well what, did you get written instructions? Actually, that would even be better. We would then have physical evidence.",
        "Madame Lacoste: No, there's nothing in writing.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then she must've called you.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Yes, she called me.",
        "Jennifer: How do you know each other?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Well, we worked together.",
        "Jennifer: Memorial?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Yes, we worked together on the memorial.",
        "Jennifer: On what memorial? I'm talking about the hospital.",
        "Madame Lacoste: Oh. Look, I -- I really want to help you. I do.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, well, then start helping!",
        "Madame Lacoste: I'm trying, but you keep bringing up this Meg woman.",
        "Jennifer: Yes! I need the details.",
        "Madame Lacoste: But I don't know anything.",
        "Jennifer: Why not?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Because I don't know her. I'd never seen her before that day your boyfriend found us.",
        "Jennifer: Then why was she paying you?",
        "Madame Lacoste: She was sent by the person who hired me.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, wait. Meg was working with someone else? Who is it? I need a name!",
        "Madame Lacoste: She was sent by someone who loves you very much.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Who wanted this to happen in just the right way, and this isn't it.",
        "Jennifer: Wanted what to happen?!",
        "Madame Lacoste: You are so angry.",
        "Jennifer: If you think this is bad, then you just keep this up! Listen, lady, if you don't want to go to jail, then you better tell me right now who hired you. Who sent you to me?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Your brother. It was Paul.",
        "Jennifer: If you don't stop all this beyond the grave garbage, I swear --",
        "Madame Lacoste: Paul is alive, Jennifer I saw him with my own eyes. Paul is alive.",

        "Katie: There's a gambling ring in Oakdale?",
        "Jack: We're investigating a club downtown. Nick's doing some undercover work there.",

        "Anatoly: No, no, it's set. Yes, tomorrow, the usual route. Customs and duties are all paid, we're good? No, I have no worries about it. I'm certain there'll be no problems. Because no way you want to come to me and tell me you had a problem with a simple delivery, am I right? He was dealt with. Yes, I read the papers -- widow, three kids. It's a terrible thing. It's a dangerous world, Bobby. It makes you want to think twice, am I right? So tomorrow, 4:30? And don't be late.",

        "Jade: You should come with a warning label.",
        "Kevin: I know, I know. So here's the situation, okay? Luke is grounded, and I'm kind of off-limits because we got caught with some vodka. So I mean, what do you say about, you know, just helping us out a little bit?",

        "Madame Lacoste: I run ads in the city times classifieds. He made an appointment with me.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, you and my dead brother had a meeting?",
        "Madame Lacoste: He said that people thought he was dead, and that's when he got the idea to disappear. But when he saw that you blamed yourself for his death, he couldn't do it.",
        "Jennifer: What do you mean, when he saw me? Where was he?",
        "Madame Lacoste: He didn't tell me that.",

        "Jennifer: You're making all of this up.",
        "Madame Lacoste: He didn't want it to be too much of a shock to you when he just showed up. But the truth be told, I think he wanted to know that you really missed him, that you really wanted him back.",
        "Jennifer: Well -- oh, gosh, you really are good at this, aren't you?!",
        "Madame Lacoste: Apparently not, or I wouldn't be sitting here. Look, Jennifer, I'm telling you the truth about your brother. The only thing that I lied about was how I got the information. Your brother Paul is alive.",
        "Jennifer: Sorry. Still don't believe you.",
        "Madame Lacoste: When you were 7, you had a diary that you kept in a puzzle box in the top of your closet.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Madame Lacoste: It was purple vinyl. It had a lock on it, but you hid it anyway. Paul said your mother would try to read it.",
        "Jennifer: And she knew how to pick a lock. But I -- I never told anyone that.",
        "Madame Lacoste: But Paul was there. He said it was the first time you might remember where he tried to protect you.",
        "Jennifer: This part of your scam?",
        "Madame Lacoste: Part of reminding you that Paul loves you.",
