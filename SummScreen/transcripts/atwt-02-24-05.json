        "[Techno music plays] There was a time I was blind I was so confused I ran away just to hide it all from you but baby you knew me better than I knew myself they say if you love something let it go if it comes back it's yours that's how you know it's for keeps yeah, it's for sure and you're ready or willing to give me more than what a girl wants what a girl needs whatever makes me happy and sets you free",
        "Celia: Cut the music.",
        "Casey: But you sound great.",
        "Rafael: What are you doing? Come on, get down from there. Where are your clothes? Put your clothes back on.",
        "Celia: But Alison said I could borrow this.",
        "Rafael: Come on. Do as I say.",
        "Celia: But it's not fair. I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Rafael: Celia --",
        "Alison: Tough love?",
        "Rafael: Why are you encouraging her?",
        "Alison: To do what? To be talented?",
        "Rafael: I don't want her getting her hopes up.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, that's a problem. I read how hope ruins lots of kids.",
        "Rafael: I don't want her disappointed, okay?",
        "Alison: Like you?",
        "Rafael: She's going back to Montega, okay? That's where she belongs.",
        "Alison: Rafael, she has dreams. She belongs in a place where she actually has a chance at making some of them come true. And it looks to me like there's only one person standing in the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: When we were talking about children's books, I thought we were talking about children's books -- not actual children.",
        "Henry: Yes, I -- you think I'm rushing things, huh?",
        "Katie: Well, we've only been married -- not even two days. I think maybe, you know, I don't know if we're ready to have kids.",
        "Henry: When do you know?",
        "Katie: Know what?",
        "Henry: When you're ready. I mean, there's a lot of people out there becoming parents whether they're ready or not.",
        "Katie: Um -- I don't know. I think you just know, one day.",
        "Henry: You know, bubbles, most people have this conversation before the \"I dos\".",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, we're not most people.",
        "Henry: I know. You know what I'm talking about. They sit over a cosmo and they talk about how many they want and whether they want a boy first or a girl first or if there's twins that run in your family or twins run -- didn't you ever discuss this with Mike?",
        "Katie: Why do you always bring Mike into everything? Let's just enjoy what we have. I mean, I really kind of like our life the way it is. In fact, I like it so much that I don't really want to change anything between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Let's not do this here.",
        "Jennifer: Why can't you just admit that you love her?",
        "Mike: Because I don't.",
        "Jennifer: Well, tell that to your face every time she walks in the room.",
        "Mike: Okay. Okay. Maybe I'm a little reactive, jealous even. But not for the reasons you think. When Katie and Henry started talking about having kids, it made me realize how much I've always wanted a family of my own.",
        "Jennifer: That doesn't surprise me. You're gonna make a great father someday.",
        "Mike: Someday? You make it sound like I'm waiting for my life to begin. And you know what? I don't think I want to wait anymore, Jen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I didn't miss any calls.",
        "Lily: The private investigator has my home number?",
        "Carly: And your cell.",
        "Lily: What did she say when she called?",
        "Carly: Just that she was on her way over and that we wouldn't be disappointed.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Lily: That must be her. I'll get it.",
        "Nan: Nan Shepherd from Shepherd Investigative Services.",
        "Lily: I'm Lily Snyder. Come on in.",
        "Nan: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi. I'm Carly Snyder.",
        "Nan: It's nice to meet you in person.",
        "Carly: You came very highly recommended.",
        "Nan: Are you two sisters?",
        "Carly: No, no. Our husbands are cousins.",
        "Lily: What did you find out about Julia Larrabee?",
        "Nan: Plenty. And none of it good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: I'm sorry, but the answer is no.",
        "Julia: Lisa, listen. I know that Lily is your friend. But we were friends, too. And the maitre d' said that room was completely packed -- the dining room -- and I know if you talk to him --",
        "Lisa: No, no, no. Do you expect me to help you have a romantic dinner with my friend's husband?",
        "Julia: Holden is Lily's husband in name only.",
        "Lisa: Let them work out their problems.",
        "Julia: Well, he's tried that. And all he got was grief and aggravation --",
        "Lisa: Yeah, well, aggravation, honey -- I think he doesn't even know what aggravation is. But I've got this feeling that you will certainly teach him the meaning of the word.",
        "Keith: Hi.",
        "Julia: Hi.",
        "Keith: Why'd you want to meet here?",
        "Julia: I'm trying to set something up for tonight. So I was just wondering if maybe you could keep J.J. for me? I want to do something special for Holden.",
        "Keith: Why don't you hold off on that special thing until he gets divorced?",
        "Julia: His divorce is just a formality, Keith.",
        "Keith: Three kids is not a formality.",
        "Julia: Why are you being so negative?",
        "Keith: Because you've got a warrant for your arrest in El Paso. So don't pretend that the only thing standing between you and Holden is his wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I scared you off with the family talk, didn't I?",
        "Jennifer: No, um -- we're missing a few essential things like an engagement, a wedding.",
        "Mike: We'll still do all those things. And look, I know this seems like it's coming out of nowhere --",
        "Jennifer: No. I know where it's coming from.",
        "Mike: Well, Jen, I've always wanted to be a dad.",
        "Jennifer: Well, in case you haven't heard, there are ways you can do that on your own now.",
        "Mike: Yeah. I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy, you know? I don't know. I don't want to do it that way. I want a wife. And I want a home. And I want a dozen arms wrapped around me when I come through the door.",
        "Jennifer: A dozen?",
        "Mike: Half dozen? I don't know, I mean, I just thought now that the company isn't on the front burner, we could shift focus.",
        "Jennifer: To diapers and 2:00 feedings?",
        "Mike: To a bigger commitment. I mean, not in the next ten minutes. You know, but we could practice. Practice till we drop. Till it's perfect. Just like you -- absolutely perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: We can recycle those later.",
        "Henry: Conversation over?",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Henry: Let's just -- let's just take it to the abstract here, okay? In theory, do you want children?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Henry: The old-fashioned way?",
        "Katie: Are you asking if I'm ever gonna have sex with you?",
        "Henry: Not in the abstract.",
        "Katie: Right now, for me, having sex and wanting children are two different things.",
        "Henry: What, did you miss basic anatomy class, or --",
        "Katie: I just -- you know, everything's happening kind of fast. We just had the wedding, and we're getting used to being husband and wife -- sleeping in the same bed.",
        "Henry: That's sleeping. Sleeping being the operative word.",
        "Katie: Right, so -- let's just enjoy every little moment, like moving your stuff in, and making this a home. And, don't forget, we do have Snickers.",
        "Henry: Bubbles, when I thought about the pitter-patter of little feet, those feet weren't covered in fur, with whiskers and a nasty carrot habit.",
        "Katie: You're gonna be a great dad someday.",
        "Henry: Well, my Aunt Tillie always used to say \"all good things come to those who wait.\" 'Course, Aunt Tillie confused telephone poles with Christmas trees, so -- okay.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Katie: For understanding.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, all right. You want to shake your hubby a dry one?",
        "Katie: Straight up?",
        "Henry: Oh, you spoil me. [Knock on door] If that is Mike, tell him we're low on vodka, and to go home.",
        "Katie: Well, hello.",
        "Craig: Hello.",
        "Katie: What are you doing here so late?",
        "Craig: Where's Mr. Katie?",
        "Katie: No cracks about Henry, please.",
        "Craig: Actually, I come bearing a wedding gift.",
        "Katie: Oh! Well, you could have given it to us at our reception, if you had actually been at our reception.",
        "Craig: May I?",
        "Katie: Yeah, sure. Come on in. And while you're at it, you might as well just get to why you're here -- the real reason, Craig. What do you want this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Do what you have to do. Okay, this is none of our business, right, Ali? I mean, you know your sister more than anybody.",
        "Rafael: Yeah, Celia? Come on. You can come out of there. Come over here.",
        "Celia: Still mad?",
        "Rafael: I'm not mad.",
        "Celia: You look mad. But you can never stay mad.",
        "Rafael: Okay, so you want to be a star? An American idol?",
        "Celia: Yes.",
        "Rafael: Yeah, I know. Well, I want to be a star, too. I want to be a middleweight champ.",
        "Celia: Rafael, I'm sorry you can't fight anymore. I really am. But that's not my fault.",
        "Rafael: No, it's not, and -- [Rafael sighs] I don't have the right to take your dream away from you, so -- nobody does.",
        "Celia: So, can I stay?",
        "Rafael: Look, if the I.N.S. agrees --",
        "Celia: Thank you.",
        "Rafael: Okay. Well, we got to see Ms. Esteban again. We'll need her help.",
        "Celia: She said she'd talk to those immigration people, didn't she?",
        "Rafael: Yes, but if they say you can't stay, you've got to accept that, okay? No arguing.",
        "Celia: I promise.",
        "Rafael: All right. We might as well go see her now, so -- what, you didn't change.",
        "Celia: I couldn't. My stuff's in the washing machine back at Aaron and Alison's place. That's why I had to borrow this. Looks great on me, doesn't it?",
        "Rafael: Okay, yeah. Just get your jacket, okay?",
        "Celia: Okay.",
        "Aaron: That was real cool, man.",
        "Alison: It makes me wish I had a big brother.",
        "Celia: I'm ready.",
        "Rafael: All right. We won't be long, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Take your time.",
        "Rafael: Thank you, man.",
        "Celia: I won't be any trouble, I promise. And my very first Grammy goes to you. You'll be the first one I thank, after my manager and my boyfriend \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Drugs?",
        "Nan: All prescription, all illegally obtained.",
        "Lily: Julia has a drug problem?",
        "Nan: She didn't steal them for herself.",
        "Carly: Better yet, she was selling 'em.",
        "Nan: No, they were for her husband.",
        "Carly: For Les?",
        "Nan: Lester Sweeney, aka Lenny Swanson, aka Lawrence Swanson --",
        "Carly: Oh, that bum. What a real piece of work.",
        "Nan: Well, according to several co-workers, she showed up at the clinic with her share of bruises. Apparently, he counted on her to supply him with the drugs, and if she didn't come through, he didn't hesitate to take it out on her.",
        "Lily: Why didn't she just tell the police the truth?",
        "Nan: I guess she was too afraid of her husband. So, instead, she took off, and now she's wanted not only on the drug charge, but on a flight rap, too.",
        "Carly: It says here that a Judge Martin signed the bench warrant.",
        "Nan: Yeah, he's a real hard-nose.",
        "Carly: Oh. So, if the Texas authorities were somehow tipped off as to where she is --",
        "Nan: They'd ask the local boys to extradite her back to El Paso.",
        "Lily: She would definitely be put in jail?",
        "Nan: If judge martin has his way, Julia Larrabee will spend a long, long time behind bars.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: That charge is old news.",
        "Keith: Not to the Texas police. Now, listen to me. You got to stop running.",
        "Julia: I'm not running, okay? I'm trying to build a life here, for me and for J.J. -- right here in Oakdale.",
        "Keith: Yeah. With a guy who's married.",
        "Julia: Yeah, with Holden -- unless you scare him half to death by telling him I'm a wanted woman.",
        "Keith: Now, listen. These drug charges -- I know they're not your fault.",
        "Julia: Maybe you should have let les kill me. Huh? Would that have made you feel better?",
        "Keith: Oh, come on. Come on. What would make me feel better is to get rid of this mess once and for all, so this isn't hanging over your head. Now, listen, I know a good lawyer. He'll get the charges dropped.",
        "Julia: It's not gonna matter, okay? The flight charges are gonna stick. As far as the court is concerned, I broke a joint custody agreement.",
        "Keith: Ah, so what, so what? You'll do a little community service.",
        "Julia: What, in El Paso? No. No, thank you.",
        "Keith: Now, listen to me. You got to come clean with Holden.",
        "Julia: Are you crazy?",
        "Keith: Am I crazy? So you're gonna wait for the cops to show up and handcuff you --",
        "Julia: The cops are not -- the cops are not gonna show up, Keith.",
        "Keith: Look, you say you love him.",
        "Julia: I do.",
        "Keith: Then prove it. Tell him the truth, and see how he handles it. See if he sticks with you.",
        "Julia: No. No. You forget it. I mean it.",
        "Keith: No. You listen to me, if you're gonna parade yourself around town with this relationship, and then wait for J.J. to start calling him Dad, that's not gonna happen. So you better fess up to him, or I will!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Lucy's mom should be able to help. She's got connections with, like, half the world.",
        "Aaron: Well, even she doesn't, I don't think it's gonna stop Celia. She'll probably just ship herself back in another crate of oranges.",
        "Casey: Are you serious? She had herself shipped?",
        "Alison: Express mail.",
        "Casey: Cool. Well, I'll finish setting this up before I have to go.",
        "Aaron: Thanks a lot, case. Tell me, how did you get Rafi to change his mind?",
        "Alison: I just told him that dreams matter, and it's not fair to keep Celia from doing what she wants. Anyway, he finally got it. What?",
        "Aaron: You're right. I mean, he's a good worker and he's honest, but if you ask me, Rafi needs a major attitude adjustment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafael: She's gonna stay with me. I'm going to take care of her. I'll make sure she goes to school and has everything she needs.",
        "Sierra: I see. You know, Celia, did you see the game room? I know you saw the pool house, if you go past the sun porch, it's just over there.",
        "Celia: I'll check it out. Thanks.",
        "Rafael: All right, we won't be long.",
        "Celia: Take all the time you want.",
        "Rafael: Okay. Gosh, I'm sorry to do this to you again.",
        "Sierra: No, really. You're not doing anything. You know, I could never repay you for how you helped Lucy after that plane crash. I mean, you're the reason she's alive.",
        "Rafael: You don't owe me anything.",
        "Sierra: But you have my gratitude, and my affection. You have since you were a little boy. I just want to make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. I mean, a girl Celia's age is a huge responsibility. This is not Montega, and the teenagers here are under a huge amount of peer pressure. And we both know that your sister is very headstrong.",
        "Rafael: Yeah, she gets that from our father.",
        "Sierra: But she's gorgeous like your mother. I mean, I wouldn't dream of telling you what to do. But, you sure you're ready to raise a teenage girl?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: That was the longest ride home.",
        "Mike: Torture. Prepare to be amazed.",
        "Jennifer: Again?",
        "Mike: And again. And again. And again. [Jennifer squeals] What's wrong?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Mike, I can't. I'm not ready.",
        "Mike: You were ready a second ago.",
        "Jennifer: It just feels different, like it's not just about us anymore.",
        "Mike: It's all about us.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, I think -- I think maybe I've given you the wrong idea about what I want from my life right now. When I told Craig I was leaving Street Jeans, that was about my mother, Mike. It wasn't about me suddenly deciding that I don't want to work anymore, because I do.",
        "Mike: I'm okay with you working.",
        "Jennifer: But it's not just about working. It's about building a career. And you know the kinds of hours that takes.",
        "Mike: Maybe I could be a stay-at-home Dad.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, yeah. That's fair. You sit home changing diapers, while stacks of blueprints pile up that you can't build.",
        "Mike: It's worth it.",
        "Jennifer: Now. Tonight you feel that way, but we both have to be willing to sacrifice, and I'm not.",
        "Mike: Jen, lots of parents have careers and kids.",
        "Jennifer: Yes, after they're successful, and they're ready. You and I, we're just not there. And if and when we decide to have children, I don't want it to be a reaction to what's going on in Katie's life.",
        "Mike: Oh, don't you -- don't start.",
        "Jennifer: It happened before. I moved in here right after they got engaged.",
        "Mike: That had nothing to do with us.",
        "Jennifer: It was just a coincidence?",
        "Mike: I don't plan my life around Katie! I'm sorry. It's just the way I -- it's me, you know? It's the way I'm wired. I always wanted to be a father. And I was, once. Her name was Nora. I never got to hold her or raise her, but she was mine. And then when Carly was pregnant with Sage, I thought, \"this is it.\" You know? \"I'm finally going to get to be a dad.\" And when that didn't happen, I couldn't let go of that feeling.",
        "Jennifer: That's beautiful.",
        "Mike: We'd make great parents, Jen. I know we would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Your happiness is very important to me. And I'm hoping that you will let me show you how much.",
        "Katie: By giving me a check?",
        "Craig: No, by sharing our lives the way a brother and sister should.",
        "Katie: Are you in therapy?",
        "Craig: No, but I've learned a very precious lesson, finally, that you can never replace those you love most.",
        "Katie: No, you can't.",
        "Craig: Something wrong?",
        "Katie: No, it's not you.",
        "Craig: Henry?",
        "Katie: No, Henry is an incredible husband. He's my best friend. He's everything to me. He's more of a brother than you ever -- I'm sorry, that was really mean.",
        "Craig: No, in most states, a brother is not supposed to be your husband.",
        "Katie: Very funny.",
        "Craig: I know.",
        "Katie: Believe it or not, Henry and I are very happy.",
        "Craig: Can I ask you a personal question?",
        "Katie: You're going to anyway.",
        "Craig: If you had your choice between brotherly Henry and Mike Kasnoff, would it even be a contest?",
        "Katie: Craig, my life is not a contest, and I don't need advice from some bazillion-time loser at love like you.",
        "Craig: Well, I got my answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Julia: I can handle my own life.",
        "Keith: No, you're not handling it. You're making mess out of it again, as usual.",
        "Julia: Oh, thank you. Thank you for the vote of confidence, Keith.",
        "Keith: Now, listen to me, all right? What if you get a traffic ticket? What if they want a make on you? What if Holden wants to take you to Europe?",
        "Julia: For our honeymoon?",
        "Keith: Well, you'd need a passport.",
        "Julia: And what if the sky fell in, Keith?",
        "Keith: There are a dozen ways that this thing could turn up on you!",
        "Julia: It hasn't turned up so far.",
        "Keith: Yeah, but I'm not gonna stand by and watch J.J. see his mother carted off to jail, so you need to face reality for once in your life!",
        "Julia: You want reality?",
        "Keith: Yes!",
        "Julia: Try hiding in a closet, holding onto your kid for dear life while your so-called husband bangs on the closet door with a baseball bat because you forgot to put his beer in the refrigerator. Now, I've had a lifetime of reality, so don't talk to me about reality.",
        "Keith: I know, but this the one chance to get all of this stuff --",
        "Julia: How is Holden gonna go for me?",
        "Keith: If he loves you, he'll understand.",
        "Julia: No! He's gonna go from having a wife whose family practically owns this town to being with a woman who's a fugitive from the law? He's not. He's not gonna trust me with his children. He's not gonna want to be with me.",
        "Keith: I don't think that's gonna happen, but if it does, it's better to find out now, than when J.J. gets attached to him.",
        "Julia: No, it's not! Listen to me, Keith. Listen to me. I swear, if you say anything to anyone, it will be the last time you see me or J.J. I mean it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Katie: When did you stumble on a copy of the good brother handbook?",
        "Craig: I'm showing sincere concern here. And you're angry?",
        "Katie: I'm not angry!",

        "Craig: Such as it is.",
        "Katie: Henry loves me! He married me knowing that I have feelings for another man. And if that's not love, I don't know what is.",
        "Craig: Yes, you do. Yes, you do. I saw the way you were looking at Mike.",
        "Katie: Well --",
        "Craig: You know? And the good news is, he was looking the same way right back at you.",

        "Mike: No, no, I want to. When Carly was pregnant with Sage, I had everything planned out. You know, how she'd look. Where she'd go to school. What I was gonna get her for her first Christmas present. Now, when I see her, it just reminds me of everything that I'm missing in my life.",

        "Sierra: Absolutely. And you know what? Tomorrow, I'll make some calls, and I'll check on your immigration status, okay?",

        "Carly: Why would it? This isn't some scheme that we cooked up. This is real. This is the truth. This is what her life was. And she can't lie. She can't bat her eyes to get out of a bench warrant.",

        "Carly: Well, I have a reoccurring thought about her getting away with stealing your husband! Come on, Lily. It's the right thing to do. We're being responsible citizens. She's a fugitive from the law.",

        "Carly: Oh, honey. Listen, Holden couldn't be any farther away. And Jack's not too happy with me, either. If we let her stay in town, Julia will chip away at both our lives until there's nothing left. I can't even believe I'm talking about this.",

        "Henry: Don't con a con man, Craig. Come on. There's not enough zeroes on that check to make me even consider hurting my wife.",
        "Craig: We were having a very nice conversation, actually. She said you were the brother she had never had. You're supportive and loyal, and even your wedding helped her save face in front of family, friends.",

        "Craig: Yes, still, I wouldn't want to be the guy to stand in for -- I think you catch my drift.",

        "Casey: You haven't really lived until you've been to Al's. It's a diner. It's like a 24-hour joint. Very exciting. So you want to grab a burger?",
        "Celia: I'd love to.",

        "Lily: That little boy is the problem. I want Julia gone as much as you do, but putting his mother in prison --",
        "Carly: Yeah, right. Okay, well, how about this? We go to Julia, we tell her what we know. We give her a chance to pack up and leave town, or we go to the cops.",
        "Lily: What if she runs to Holden?",
        "Carly: She doesn't want him to know the truth, or she would've already told him.",
        "Lily: What if she comes clean, and he decides to defend her?",
        "Carly: From a distance? If she gets sent to Texas, whatever it is that they have together is bound to fall apart. He's not gonna leave town. He's not gonna leave his kids.",

        "Craig: I hope you mean that.",
        "Henry: I do. That's what love is.",
        "Craig: Yes, Henry. You know, you're right. Sometimes I think love is doing what's right for the other person, that is not necessarily right for you. It's good to know that her happiness means so much to you. Good night. Ah, well, I give that about a month. Then it's out with Henry, in with Mike. And clear sailing for me, Jennifer and Street Jeans.",

        "Carly: Well, so we'll find someplace out of the way. And if she wants to play hardball with her restraining order, then we'll trump her with an outstanding arrest warrant. Come on, Lily. Smile. And I'll call you later with the time and place. And Julia Larrabee is as good as gone.",
