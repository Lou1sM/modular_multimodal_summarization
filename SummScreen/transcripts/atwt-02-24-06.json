        "Lily: Hey. Luke's car's not here. Did he go out?",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Where'd he go?",
        "Holden: I told him that he could take Jade to the school concert.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's nice. It's nice that he's showing her around. I think she's starting to like it here. You know what, we should ease up on Luke. We should.",
        "Holden: You think?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Jade -- she needs to meet kids her own age. She can't -- what's that?",
        "Holden: Kevin's student I.D. I found it outside on the porch.",
        "Lily: Kevin was here?",
        "Holden: Obviously. But of course, Luke told me that he hadn't seen him in days. I can't believe I let him snow me like that.",
        "Lily: Wait, wait. What's going on?",
        "Holden: After I agreed to let Luke take Jade to the concert, I asked him if Kevin was going to be there.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "Holden: But he said that Kevin was absent from school, that he hadn't seen him, that he'd been sick. Right. So sick he shows up out on our doorstep, daring me to catch him.",
        "Lily: Okay. Maybe -- maybe Kevin dropped it the last time he was here.",
        "Holden: Lily, it was right on the ground. It would've been easy to find.",
        "Lily: Okay, well, maybe -- maybe, for some reason, Luke had it. And he accidentally dropped it?",
        "Holden: You don't believe that any more than I do. Let's face the fact our son is lying to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Man, that band was horrible. I've heard barking dogs sound better than that.",
        "Luke: It was like the singer had a wire around his throat.",
        "Kevin: And it was wrapped way too tight.",
        "Luke: And he was the best part of the band! I mean, I play better bass than that girl.",
        "Kevin: You play bass?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Kevin: Look, I'm sorry about all this.",
        "Luke: Sorry about what?",
        "Kevin: You know, it was my fault we went to see this lame concert anyway.",
        "Luke: No, don't worry about it. At least it got me out of the house. And besides, you know, it's good to see you.",
        "Kevin: Back at you, man. We should actually thank that cousin of yours. She is extremely hot, by the way. You got anything going with her?",
        "Luke: With Jade? No! Kevin, for crying out loud, she's my cousin!",
        "Kevin: I'm just saying it was cool the way she, you know, covered for you with your parents and everything.",
        "Luke: Well, she just knows that they'd kill me if they knew that I was hanging out with you.",
        "Kevin: Well, yeah. That, too.",
        "Luke: No, thanks.",
        "Kevin: Come on. Kill the bad taste of that band.",
        "Luke: You gotta be kidding, right? My parents are still all over me about the last time we got drunk. They're probably sitting at home with a breathalyzer.",
        "Kevin: That bad, huh?",
        "Luke: Yeah. You have no idea. But, you know, it's not just them. I promised that I'd stop drinking and start taking care of myself. And I kind of want to stick to it. You know, play it safe.",
        "Kevin: The three most boring words in the English language. \"Play it safe.\"",
        "Luke: Well, it's a lot better than \"dead on arrival.\"",
        "Kevin: You are such an extreme freak.",
        "Luke: Well, hey, I just got a new kidney, you know? And I think maybe, just maybe it'd be a good idea to try taking care of it. And besides, I don't need to be drunk or stoned to have a good time.",
        "Kevin: Well, it's your choice. More for me.",
        "Luke: Well, hey, I think maybe we should go back. Jade's probably going to wonder what happened to us.",
        "Kevin: See, you like her. Admit it.",
        "Luke: No, I don't. I just think she's cool, and I'm glad that she's staying with us.",
        "Kevin: Come on, you like her. Say it.",
        "Luke: Come on, Kevin, lay off.",
        "Kevin: Come on, you think she is a babe. She is a babe and she's got you drooling. She's got you drooling!",
        "Luke: No, Kevin, come on. She's not my -- ow! She's not my type.",
        "Kevin: Come on, what is your type then?",
        "Luke: No -- ow!",
        "Kevin: Not until you tell me, what is your type?",

        "[Maddie remembering]",
        "Maddie: I understand, Mrs. Hughes. I'm really --",
        "Margo: Yeah, you're really, really sorry. I get that, I know. I heard you. And you should be. You ever pull a stunt like this again, I will not intervene.",
        "Maddie: You won't have to, because we're never going to do it again.",
        "Margo: Good! Because if you ever do do something like this again, you're going to have to find yourself another place to live. If you can't abide by my terms, and put some distance between you and Casey, and make sure you never pull a stunt like this again, I'm afraid I have no alternative but to ask you to leave.",
        "Maddie: Casey, are you crazy? Stop it!",
        "Casey: Let me get it, let me get it.",
        "Maddie: No, Casey, get out of here! Seriously, you have to get out of here.",
        "Casey: Sorry, I can't. Actually, I'm pretty thirsty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Butch: Tiffany, what are you waiting for? Get up there and start shaking that groove thing for Anatoly, or there's gonna be hell to pay. For the both of us!",
        "[Glasses falling]",
        "Chardonnay: Oh! Hey, watch where you're going, you big klutz!",
        "Nick: Come with me.",
        "Carly: Leave me alone.",
        "Nick: Come with me, or you'll be sorry you ever set foot in this place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Well, now you know the truth.",
        "Dusty: You're a punk. How could you do this to your sister?",
        "Paul: I've got nothing to say to you.",
        "Dusty: Give me one good reason I shouldn't kill you right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Hey, how soon can you get me a taxi or a car service?",
        "Desk clerk #1: Oh, I don't know, Ms. Munson. We've been having trouble getting cabs all night.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no, no, no, no. I have a flat tire and I have to get across town immediately.",
        "Desk clerk #1: Let me see what I can do.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you so much. I'll be over here.",
        "Desk clerk #1: Okay.",
        "Jennifer: Meg! Oh, where are you going so fast?",
        "Meg: Jennifer, I don't have time for this right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Nick: Saving you from making the biggest mistake of your life.",
        "Carly: I don't need you to save me from anything.",
        "Nick: Are you really looking forward to swinging around on that pole? Are you?",
        "Carly: That's none of your business.",
        "Nick: You know, I don't care how much money Anatoly was gonna give you to show him a little skin -- that's the last thing you want to do tonight, trust me.",
        "Carly: Trust you? I don't think so. Nick, I've got to get out of here before Anatoly comes looking for me.",
        "Nick: Let me worry about Anatoly. You've got bigger problems to worry about right now.",
        "Carly: That guy's gonna be a whole lot of mad if I don't get out there in like five seconds, so back off!",
        "Nick: Okay. It's your funeral. Or should I say divorce?",
        "Carly: What are you talking about? Oh, my god! Jack! What the hell is he doing here?",
        "Nick: I was asking myself the same question.",
        "Carly: Did you call him?",
        "Nick: What, are you kidding? He's the last guy I want hanging around here. He'd blow my cover.",
        "Carly: No, he's not going to blow your cover. If he's here, he's here for a good reason. He can't see me like this.",
        "Nick: I suggest you make a speedy getaway.",
        "Carly: How am I supposed to do that?",
        "Nick: You just told me, it was none my business.",
        "Carly: I need your help. What do you want me to do, beg?",
        "Nick: That's an option.",
        "Carly: Nick, please. Will you help me get out of here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Well, I guess when you're adopted, you always want to know more about your birth parents. And that's why Jade went looking for my mom's sister, Rose.",
        "Kevin: But Rose was already dead.",
        "Luke: Right.",
        "Kevin: Wow. That's pretty horrible to find out.",
        "Luke: Yeah, sure is.",
        "Kevin: I mean, Jade just ended up on your doorstep. She's pretty lucky, actually. She just hit the jackpot.",
        "Luke: You sound like my grandma.",
        "Kevin: All right, look, I'm not judging her. But I bet the house that she grew up in isn't half as nice as yours. I mean, why leave? While you're at it, why not adopt me?",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah, right. My parents would go for that. You're public enemy number one, remember?",
        "Kevin: Me? Hell, once they get to know me better, they'll see I'm just a misunderstood teenager coming from a dysfunctional family. All I need is a chance. And I wouldn't mind taking one of those gold cards.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, we should probably get going. Jade's probably worried.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I told you, I can't listen to any more of that garbage. I think it's just cool to hang out in here, you know?",
        "Luke: Yeah, but, I mean, I feel kind of bad leaving her alone.",
        "Kevin: Well, it's not like she's your date or anything.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, let me just go tell her where we are, and that we'll meet up with her after the concert.",
        "Kevin: Whatever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Why don't we just wait until Luke gets home, and we can talk to him about it then?",
        "Holden: Look, it's too late. He already lied about Kevin, what if he's lying about other things?",
        "Lily: But, if he really is at a school concert with Jade, how much trouble can he really get into?",
        "Holden: If Kevin showed up with vodka? Plenty.",
        "Lily: No, I don't believe he would do that.",
        "Holden: I hope not. But the fact of the matter is, he lied to us, and we need to deal with it so that he doesn't take advantage of us.",
        "Lily: I'm sure there's a logical explanation.",
        "Holden: I'm dying to hear it. Jade, what are you doing here? Where's Luke?",
        "Jade: Oh, he's at the concert.",
        "Lily: What happened?",
        "Jade: The band was pretty lame, so I just came home.",
        "Holden: And Luke didn't come with you?",
        "Jade: He offered to. But he was having a pretty good time, so I told him he didn't have to.",
        "Holden: Was Luke hanging out with this kid? His name's Kevin. Jade, I need you to tell me the truth. It's very important. Was he here tonight?",
        "Jade: Um, yeah. He was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: All right, fine. Let's get this over with. I'm half-dead, anyway. Jennifer's not going to be happy, though, when she finds out that you murdered her brother.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I think you hurt Jennifer enough on your own.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know that, Dusty. I live with that every second.",
        "Dusty: Get on your feet.",
        "Paul: Jennifer understands why I did what I did. It may have been wrong, Dusty, it may even have been misguided. But I did it for the right reasons.",
        "Dusty: Did you do it to protect her?",
        "Paul: I don't care if you understand! The only thing that I care about is if Jennifer understands, and she does. Jennifer forgave me.",
        "Dusty: She forgave you when you were dead! She's gonna spit on you, now that you're alive.",
        "Paul: She already knows I'm alive.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Paul: You heard me. She knows I'm alive. That's why she's on her way over here, Dusty. And there's nothing you can do about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Feel better?",
        "Jennifer: No, not really.",
        "Meg: Well, you should. I deserved that.",
        "Jennifer: You know, what I really want from you is an explanation. I deserve that.",
        "Meg: An explanation about what? The psychic? Madame Lacoste?",
        "Jennifer: For starters.",
        "Meg: Look, all I could tell you is it wasn't my idea to use her. But if you want, blame me, that's fine. I don't care.",
        "Jennifer: All right, okay. If it wasn't your idea, then whose was it? Paul's?",
        "Meg: Look, Jen, why don't you just walk away, okay? You're better off.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, stop with the games. I know that Paul's alive. And I know that you've been keeping it a secret. But what I really want to know, once again, is why?",
        "Meg: What difference does it make? If you know Paul is alive, there's only one question you need to be asking yourself right now. What are you going to do about it?",
        "Jennifer: What I do about Paul is really none of your concern.",
        "Meg: Fine. So why are we standing here, wasting each other's time?",
        "Jennifer: Because I can't get past how you keep ending up at the center of everything that goes wrong for me.",
        "Meg: It's not by choice.",
        "Jennifer: And yet, you have deceived me twice -- first with my son, and now with Paul. And each time, you would sit by and watch how much pain I was in, and let me think the worst. Why would you do that me? Why would you do that to anybody?",
        "Meg: Jennifer, I have no excuses, all right? I take full responsibility for my part. But I wasn't acting alone.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no, no, of course. Paul was there, pulling the strings. But at least he had some misguided belief that he was helping me. For you, it was all about getting Dusty, wasn't it? And you didn't care what it took, you didn't care what the cost.",
        "Meg: I guess that's not an unfair assessment.",
        "Jennifer: And look, it ended up costing you everything. Because he hates you now for what you did.",
        "Meg: I know. Pretty ironic, huh?",
        "Jennifer: You know, I feel sorry for you. Because, yeah, you hurt me -- but I've pretty much ended up having everything that I could ever really want. And you? You've ended up with nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Jennifer's not going to forgive you. You know how much guilt you caused her?",
        "Paul: I never meant to make her feel guilty, Dusty. I didn't. I thought that she would be so angry at me that she wouldn't care whether I lived or died. But my sister has so much love and so much compassion in her. When I heard what she had to say about me at my memorial, I was blown away.",
        "Dusty: You don't care about your sister. You only care about yourself.",
        "Paul: Oh, you are so not bright. You never were. I -- everything that I did, I did for Jennifer. Everything. And she will understand that. I will make Jennifer understand that, starting tonight.",
        "Dusty: That would be the worst thing in the world for Jennifer. That's why I'm not going to let it happen.",
        "Paul: What are you gonna do about it?",
        "Dusty: Whatever I have to do, Paul.",
        "Paul: Well, you can try, Dusty, but you'll fail. Because Jennifer will forgive me. We will be a family again.",
        "Dusty: Over my dead body. And I don't plan on dying any time soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Here you go.",
        "Maddie: I told you I didn't want any.",
        "Casey: Of course you do, you didn't get one sip before I gulped yours down.",
        "Maddie: Which was hilarious, by the way. You should think about signing up for the open mic night at the comedy club across the street. You'd have 'em rolling in the aisles.",
        "Casey: What is your problem?",
        "Maddie: Oh, I don't know. Maybe the fact that your mother, only a few hours ago, was threatening to throw me out on the street?",
        "Casey: I told you not to worry about that.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, easy for you to say. I'm gonna be out on the corner selling matches in the snow while you have your cozy room and your tv and all the videogames you can stand.",
        "Casey: Selling matches?",
        "Maddie: It's a figure of speech, Casey.",
        "Casey: It's stupid. My mom is not going to kick you out.",
        "Maddie: Oh, no? So, what if she walks through that door ordering one of those -- I don't know, double mocha whatever she's addicted to, and looks over here and sees us?",
        "Casey: We're talking.",
        "Maddie: Well, yeah, except when you're licking whipped cream off my face.",
        "Casey: What, are you complaining?",
        "Maddie: Yes!",
        "Casey: Yeah, well you weren't complaining when I kissed you. Remember that? I told you not to worry about my mom and then I kissed you. Which was kind of great.",
        "Maddie: I know, I was there.",
        "Casey: And you liked it.",
        "Maddie: You know, that is so not the point.",
        "Casey: Well, then what is the point?",
        "Maddie: Your mom was really serious about this, okay? She wants us to keep distance from each other. And if she walks in here, and she finds us not even being able to manage it for one night, she's gonna hit the roof.",
        "Casey: What I'm trying to tell you is that the roof has already been hit, okay? She had her meltdown, she got it all out, she's fine. In a couple days, she's gonna forget about the whole thing.",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm, just like she forget about teaching you a lesson, and not letting you go to the University of Wisconsin. Which, by the way, you wanted to do more than anything in the whole world.",
        "Casey: Yeah, you know what, that was different. And now, I'm glad it happened. You want to know why? 'Cause I don't want to go to Wisconsin anymore.",
        "Maddie: Casey, why are you so obtuse? Your mother means business about this, okay? If you underestimate her, it'll guarantee that we will never see each other again.",
        "Casey: I will not let that happen. And I will not, under any circumstances, keep my distance from you.",
        "Maddie: Well, you can't do both.",
        "Casey: Watch me.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, okay, well -- I won't be the only one watching.",

        "Luke: I can't find Jade anywhere.",
        "Kevin: Relax. She probably went to the bathroom or something.",
        "Luke: No, I had one of the girls go check. She's not in there.",
        "Kevin: Well, then she just got bored and went home. What's the big deal?",
        "Luke: The big deal is that if she goes home without me, I'm dead meat.",
        "Kevin: She seems pretty cool. I'm sure she'll cover for you.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but you know how my dad's been lately. He's been obsessed with, like, every little thing that I do. What if she goes home and he starts grilling her, and she gets freaked and tells? I'm gonna be grounded for the rest of my life!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You see? Luke is with Kevin. He lied to our faces.",
        "Jade: No, wait. I'm sorry, you misunderstood me. Luke did see Kevin, but it wasn't at the concert. He was here a little while ago.",
        "Lily: Kevin was at the house?",
        "Jade: Yeah, he stopped by for a few minutes. Look, I barely know the guy, but it seemed like he was trying to get Luke to sneak off and hang out with him. And he said no.",
        "Holden: So you're saying that he showed up here for a few minutes and then he left?",
        "Jade: Right.",
        "Holden: Did he say that he would see Luke at the concert?",
        "Jade: They didn't say anything about a concert. I certainly didn't see him there. When I left, Luke was by himself. He seemed like he was just having a good time listening to the music.",
        "Lily: Was there any alcohol being passed around?",
        "Jade: No way. And even if there was, Luke wouldn't have been having any. He told me he wasn't going to do that again.",
        "Lily: He did? He said that?",
        "Jade: Sure. He knows he can't take chances with his health.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, that's good. Because he had trouble getting that at first.",
        "Jade: Not anymore. Whatever rules you're setting for him, he's sticking to them. You should be proud of him.",

        "Jack: Look, Butch -- we got a call about a disturbance. I'm just here to check it out.",
        "Butch: Well, I'm telling you, there's been no disturbances all night. We've had a laid back crowd, as you can see.",
        "Jack: Well, how do you explain the phone call I got then?",
        "Butch: I can't, all right? Unless it's somebody trying to bust my chops. Probably some drunk I had to throw out of here. But I'm telling you, there's nothing to investigate. All right? So, I tell you what, why don't you let me buy you a beer before you take off?",
        "Jack: I think I'll take a little look around first.",

        "Carly: What do I do? Where do I go?",
        "Nick: This door's gonna right into the back. I hope you got your car fixed.",

        "Nick: All right, then what are you doing? Get going.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",

        "Anatoly: Butch, who are these two?",
        "Butch: Well, he's a cop. And she's with him.",
        "Anatoly: And the cop is here why?",
        "Jack: The OPD got a call that there was trouble on the premises. I don't suppose you'd know anything about that?",
        "Anatoly: Let me ask you something, my friend. If the girl knows you, and the cop knows the girl, does that mean he knows you, too? Don't mess with me, boys. If you two are buddies, I need to know. And I need to know now.",

        "Luke: Oh, right. Right. I'm sorry about that.",
        "Jade: I told them that you offered to, but you were having such a good time, I didn't have the heart to ruin it.",

        "Jennifer: Meg, look, I'm not trying to deliberately hurt you. But it's the truth, and I think that you need to hear it. Because you hurt a hell of a lot of people. Not just me. And you have nothing to show for it.",
        "Meg: Except a lot of remorse.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. And you're going to have to live with that for the rest of your life. But hopefully you've learned a thing or two about yourself.",
        "Meg: Believe me, I learned plenty. More than my share. And for whatever its worth, I never felt good about what I was doing to you.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. But you just couldn't let Dusty go. You knew that eventually, when we would find out that Johnny was alive, that that would change everything. You would lose Dusty. Man, but I guess you just couldn't let him go.",
        "Meg: No, I couldn't. You must really hate me.",
        "Jennifer: No, no. I don't waste my time with hate. I would only end up hurting myself.",
        "Meg: So you pity me instead?",
        "Jennifer: I am sorry that you were so blinded by this obsession. Because it made you do really cruel things. And I don't think, deep down, that you're a bad person.",
        "Meg: Maybe I am. I don't know anymore.",
        "Jennifer: Well, at least you can admit that you did a pretty horrible thing.",
        "Meg: And now I get to live with the fact that you and Dusty are together, and better than ever.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. And in an odd way, I guess I have you to thank for that.",
        "Meg: He'll never forgive me, will he? You know, I always thought that we'd be friends one day, but that'll never happen.",
        "Jennifer: Probably not. I mean, even if I could forgive you, I doubt he ever will.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, Dusty's old-fashioned in some ways. He's from the eye-for-an- eye school. I know that he won't be happy until I've suffered the way I made you suffer.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Meg: I don't suppose you could nip that in the bud for me, could you?",
        "Jennifer: I doubt it would do any good. 'Cause you're right -- you cross someone that he loves, and he makes a point of returning the favor.",

        "Dusty: Well, I've got to protect her from you, regardless.",
        "Paul: See, that's what I said. I said the same thing. You sound just like me. Only when I say it, it's wrong. Only you're Dusty Donovan, so I guess the same rules don't apply to you.",

        "Maddie: Oh, ha, ha, ha. You know, you should be thanking me. I was so calm and cool, and collected.",
        "Casey: Good, because if we're going to keep hiding the fact that we're going to be seeing each other, then we're going to have nerves of steel.",

        "Nick: I'll let you in on that when we get back to the station. As of right now, I need to get back inside before they get suspicious.",

        "Jade: That's the point. I don't need a babysitter. You and Kevin seem like really good friends, and you guys should be able to hang out if you want to.",
