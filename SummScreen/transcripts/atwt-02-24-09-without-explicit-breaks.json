Casey also tells Margo that he and Jade were trying to catch Matt but he set him up to take the fall.

        "Margo: I want an answer. Where did the pills come from?",
        "Casey: Matt planted them.",
        "Alison: You have no way to prove that!",
        "Margo: You know what? You will get your turn.",
        "Alison: Sorry.",
        "Margo: Why would he do that?",
        "Casey: Because I'm onto him. He supplied those pills to elwood. And if we're looking for who killed reg, matt's as guilty as elwood.",
        "Margo: We don't have any proof.",
        "Casey: Not yet. But he's dealing. I know it.",
        "Alison: That's ridiculous.",
        "Margo: Have you ever had any indication that matt is involved in drugs?",
        "Alison: No. Nothing.",
        "Casey: Oh! He's not going to let onto her. He wants to get her in the sack. The sooner the better, right?",
        "Alison: What the hell do you know about what matt wants? Or what I want, for that matter?",
        "Casey: He planted those pills on me to get me out of the way, I know that.",
        "Alison: You are not in his way. Not as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Margo: Okay, so then -- why is he jealous of you?",
        "Casey: Ask him.",
        "Alison: You're the one who's acting jealous.",
        "Casey: Because I warned you he was dealing? Because I thought you might want to protect yourself? But no. No, you had to go and tell him what I said, and look what happens. He freaks out, and he turns on me!",
        "Margo: Is that true, ali? Did you warn him that casey was suspicious of him?",
        "Alison: I wasn't sure what casey might do. He's been throwing these accusations around since matt and I started hanging out.",
        "Casey: No, no -- since reg died from the drugs that came from matt!",
        "Margo: Right, all right. All right. Is there anything else that you can tell me?",
        "Alison: Not really.",
        "Margo: Fine. Then thank you for your help.",
        "Alison: I can go? Good.",
        "Casey: She is covering for matt.",
        "Margo: Casey, she seems pretty convinced that he's clean.",
        "Casey: Who are you going to believe? Alison stewart or me?",
        "Brad: Henry!",
        "Henry: Hey!",
        "Katie: Hey!",
        "Henry: Welcome to the coleman golden casino.",
        "Brad: Is this legal?",
        "Henry: There's no law against a friendly game of cards.",
        "Brad: Since when do you think a game of cards is friendly?",
        "Henry: I thought a friendly weekly poker game would be fun for all of us.",
        "Katie: And keep you out of trouble?",
        "Henry: Yeah, well it's better I play with you guys than the sharks I normally hang with.",
        "Katie: Or wouldn't it be better if you didn't play at all?",
        "Henry: Are you casting aspersions on my capacity for self-discipline?",
        "Katie: No, your gambling addiction.",
        "Henry: Trust me, sweetheart, these stakes are nothing I could become addicted to.",
        "Brad: Where is vienna?",
        "Henry: Well, I left my wallet in my jacket upstairs. So she went to get it while I set up. She should've been back by now.",
        "Brad: Well, maybe she decided to stop and fix her make-up.",
        "Katie: Because what else could be on a woman's mind other than looking good for her man?",
        "Henry: I think you just stepped in it, buddy.",
        "Brad: Well, what else is new?",
        "Henry: Here she comes, my partner in business and in life and in love! Hello, baby. Whoa, what? Ow!",
        "Vienna: How could you?",
        "Henry: What -- what did I do?",
        "Vienna: This! This!",
        "Henry: Oh, oh, that.",
        "Alison: I just saw casey. I was hoping that we could straighten a few things out. But I just walked right into a mess.",
        "Matt: Yeah, I'll bet.",
        "Alison: No, not just -- not just him and me. His mother found some pills in his backpack.",
        "Matt: Really?",
        "Alison: He said they weren't his.",
        "Matt: Well, that's what everybody says when they're busted.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know. But I really don't think he's doing drugs.",
        "Matt: Maybe he's dealing. I mean, mopping floors at the hospital can't exactly be a gold mine.",
        "Alison: No, I don't believe that, either.",
        "Matt: Well, it explains why he accused me of being the one dealing. Anything to get the eyes off him, right?",
        "Alison: Matt, he's accusing you of more than that. He told his mother that you planted the pills on him.",
        "Matt: What is his problem?",
        "Alison: I don't think that she believed him.",
        "Matt: I'm doing my best to stay out of trouble, and he's going to get the cops to come after me?",
        "Alison: I mean, she's not going to go after you without proof.",
        "Matt: There is no proof! I'm clean! But he's her son. And me? You know, if I got 20 years, she wouldn't bat an eye.",
        "Alison: She's not going to just take casey's word without proof.",
        "Matt: I hope you're right.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Matt: For what?",
        "Alison: You guys were good friends before I got between you. And as usual, I just screwed things up.",
        "Vienna: How could you do this without even telling me?",
        "Henry: I didn't -- I didn't actually do it.",
        "Vienna: Well, obviously, you were thinking about it!",
        "Henry: No, I didn't think about it!",
        "Vienna: Then why do you have this brochure?",
        "Henry: Because I was gathering information. So I could decide, if I wanted to think about it, which, if I did, I would tell you immediately!",
        "Vienna: You can't talk your way out of this, henry!",
        "Brad: It was a nice try, though.",
        "Katie: It's not funny, brad.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not. This is sneaky and dishonest.",
        "Katie: Maybe you guys should have this conversation somewhere else.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, we have.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and we can't agree.",
        "Vienna: You were going to go and get yourself neutered?",
        "Brad: Can we call it something else?",
        "Katie: This is their discussion, honey.",
        "Brad: Well look, you called it a discussion. But when one of them needs stitches? What do we call it then?",
        "Vienna: How could you go behind my back about something this important?",
        "Henry: How could you?",
        "Vienna: Because I want a baby!",
        "Henry: Yeah, I don't! And I didn't do anything about it. You sabotaged my condoms!",
        "Brad: She poked holes in his condoms. Did you know that?",
        "Henry: Now -- now who's being sneaky and dishonest?",
        "Brad: You know, vienna, he does have a point.",
        "Katie: You know, honey, this is their discussion. Let's go.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Stay, stay. Okay, maybe I was wrong by not telling you about this earlier. But please, you have to admit that you were wrong, too.",
        "Vienna: I admit it.",
        "Henry: Okay. Then can we agree to talk about it next time, like katie and brad?",
        "Brad: Yeah, well that's the key to our happiness. Right, honey?",
        "Henry: Happiness. Now doesn't that sound great, huh? Yeah? Are we okay?",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Vienna: Yes, we're okay.",
        "Brad: Can we play cards now? 'Cause I'm feeling lucky tonight.",
        "Henry: Cards before sex. Good thing we didn't go through with it, huh?",
        "Katie: Go through with what?",
        "Henry: The vasectomies.",
        "Katie: Wait a minute. You were in on this, too?",
        "Casey: Do you really think I'm dealing drugs?",
        "Margo: Are you?",
        "Casey: No! How could -- how could ask me that?",
        "Margo: Because, casey, clearly you are not telling me everything. If you want me to help you, please tell me everything.",
        "Casey: I don't want anyone else to get in trouble.",
        "Margo: Well then, the only one who is going to get in trouble is you.",
        "Casey: Okay, look -- luke found a note in elwood's room. It looked suspicious. And it was signed with the initial \"M.\"",
        "Margo: Matt.",
        "Casey: Yes, which gave us the idea that matt's the supplier.",
        "Margo: Oh, honey, based on an initial?",
        "Casey: Yeah, we were trying to prove that he did it. I made the mistake of telling alison not to get too close. I didn't want her to get caught up in this.",
        "Margo: And she mistook that for jealousy.",
        "Casey: Yes, obviously.",
        "Margo: And are you?",
        "Casey: No! It's -- it's totally over.",
        "Margo: All right, so then that whole thing with jade, that wasn't for revenge?",
        "Casey: Jade has nothing to do with this.",
        "Margo: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "Casey: The minute I warned her, alison went straight to matt. And then he realized that I knew he was dealing. And that's why he planted those pills on me, to make me look like I did it.",
        "Margo: All right, that's all very plausible. But without any evidence, all we have are two competing accusations, casey. And these.",
        "Casey: I swear to you, mom, they are not mine.",
        "Margo: I want that to be true, casey. Because if you are lying again, there is absolutely nothing I can do to keep you from going back to jail. Captioning sponsored by procter & gamble productions, inc. And cbs",
        "Casey: Mom, I'm not lying. Just give me some time, and I can prove it.",
        "Margo: How?",
        "Casey: Just let me check up on some things.",
        "Margo: What things?",
        "Casey: Just give me an hour, and I' explain everything to you.",
        "Margo: Why don't you just tell me? Maybe I can help you.",
        "Casey: No, I can't do that. I -- it involves people who don't deserve to get caught up in this. Please.",
        "Margo: All right, you've got an hour.",
        "Casey: Thanks. That's all I need.",
        "Tom: What's going on?",
        "Margo: Well, welcome home, dear. I found these pills in casey's backpack.",
        "Tom: He's doing drugs?",
        "Margo: Oh, he swears he's not.",
        "Tom: Is he dealing?",
        "Margo: No, he says someone planted them.",
        "Tom: What else would he say?",
        "Margo: And he's going to prove it. He's going to -- he's going to prove it.",
        "Tom: And where's he going to get this proof?",
        "Margo: Well, he didn't tell me that.",
        "Tom: Why does this stuff keep happening?",
        "Margo: I don't know.",
        "Tom: All right, all right, baby. What are you -- what are you going to do?",
        "Margo: I'm -- going to wait.",
        "Tom: And what would you do if it wasn't our kid?",
        "Margo: I would go and get a search warrant.",
        "Tom: Then that's what you need to do.",
        "Brad: You think I want to get a vasectomy? I don't want to sing falsetto.",
        "Henry: That doesn't happen!",
        "Katie: What were you doing there?",
        "Brad: I was just along for the ride.",
        "Katie: This is not disneyland, brad!",
        "Brad: I know that. I know that. I was just -- I was just giving henry some moral support.",
        "Vienna: What's moral about it?",
        "Brad: It's responsible. You know, to make sure you don't contribute to an unwanted pregnancy.",
        "Vienna: Well, I want to get pregnant!",
        "Henry: Do me a favor, brad -- don't help me out.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry. I just want katie to understand why I was there.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm not sure that I do. You hate hospitals. You can't even talk about medical stuff. You wouldn't go anywhere near a scalpel unless you were seriously considering this procedure.",
        "Brad: I want a baby.",
        "Katie: You're not just humoring me?",
        "Brad: Of course not! But you know what the doctor said. It'd be very dangerous for you to be pregnant right now. So I just want to make sure that there are no accidents. That's all.",
        "Katie: I wish I could believe that.",
        "Brad: It's true!",
        "Henry: Why don't we just play cards?",
        "Brad: Good idea.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I don't feel like it anymore.",
        "Brad: Can someone please tell me what the hell just happened here?",
        "Margo: All right, so go through his room. And then the rest of the house, I'll show you were his stuff is.",
        "Cop: How hard core do you want me to get?",
        "Margo: You go through this house like you would any other.",
        "Cop: This is your house, lieutenant.",
        "Margo: All right, then you just leave it a little tidier than usual.",
        "Tom: It's okay.",
        "Margo: No, it's not okay, honey. It's making me physically ill.",
        "Tom: Well, we're not doing casey any favors if we gave him a pass on this.",
        "Margo: Honey, your son's going to go back to jail. How is that helping him?",
        "Tom: He should've thought about that before he got involved.",
        "Margo: Involved? All he's doing is trying to find out who killed his friend.",
        "Tom: And he should've left that up to you.",
        "Margo: Well, we're not getting anywhere. We can't even prove manslaughter, let alone murder.",
        "Tom: Well, you'll figure it out.",
        "Margo: So what if casey already has, huh? What if he's right, and matt did plant those drugs just to throw us all off?",
        "Tom: Do you believe that?",
        "Margo: I don't know. Knowing matt, it's entirely possible.",
        "Tom: Yeah, but it doesn't make it true. Maybe matt really is trying to get his act back together.",
        "Margo: So we give matt the benefit of the doubt, and not our own son?",
        "Tom: No, we try to find out what really happened.",
        "Margo: I'm trying. But it looks like our son's going to go back to jail.",
        "Tom: If it's the right thing to do.",
        "Margo: It doesn't feel right.",
        "Tom: I know it doesn't honey, you're his mom. But you're also the chief of detectives. And you know how to do your job.",
        "Margo: Sometimes I hate doing my job.",
        "Tom: I know. Where you going?",
        "Margo: I'm going to bring him in.",
        "Tom: Okay. I'll go with you. I mean, at least we can try to find him together, huh?",
        "Matt: Margo's not going to believe a word I say if casey tells her that I'm lying.",
        "Alison: I've had my differences with margo, too. And she certainly doesn't like my family. But when it comes to her job, she's always been fair.",
        "Matt: Yeah, even when it's her own son that's at stake?",
        "Alison: I still think she would do what's right.",
        "Matt: I hope so.",
        "Alison: What if you don't wait? What if you go to them before they come after you?",
        "Matt: You mean the police?",
        "Alison: Yeah, tell them you want to make a statement, show them that you have nothing to hide. That way, maybe, you can get out ahead of the wave.",
        "Matt: Yeah. Before it drowns me.",

        "Jade: Yeah, well, she didn't get the message. And she couldn't wait to blow the whistle on you.",
        "Casey: I'm so screwed. My mom found pills in my backpack.",
        "Jade: Yours?",
        "Casey: Of course not! Matt must've planted them.",
        "Jade: Well, he practically told me he was going to do this.",

        "Vienna: I can.",
        "Henry: He didn't get the vasectomy.",
        "Vienna: Just the fact that he even considered it without even telling her? Besides, they both want a baby. He's just afraid of getting her pregnant, but she knows it's going to be okay.",
        "Henry: I'm not following that logic.",
        "Vienna: The point is, she never hid the fact that she wanted a baby. But he hid the fact that he was going to make it impossible.",

        "Henry: It's never their fault, brad, it's always the hormones.",
        "Vienna: No, that's not true! It's very sexist of you to say so! Sometimes it's true, but it's sexist.",

        "Casey: No, no, she's not.",
        "Matt: He sent her to try to buy drugs from me.",
        "Margo: Is that true?",
        "Casey: Why are you even listening to him?",
        "Matt: If you don't believe me, go ask jade.",
        "Margo: Call jade taylor, tell her to come down here. So you're going to make jade lie for you?",
        "Casey: Fine, yes, I sent her.",
        "Matt: I told you!",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Casey: To get proof that he was dealing! That he sold the drugs that killed reg!",
        "Matt: He's lying. He's trying to get himself off the hook.",
        "Casey: I'm not dealing drugs!",
        "Matt: Then why are you holding?",
        "Margo: Who told you that?",
        "Casey: Yeah, who told you?",
        "Margo: Ali? Did you?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I did.",
        "Margo: So what else do you know that you didn't tell me?",
        "Brad: Help me! Please, help me.",
        "Nurse: In here.",
        "Brad: She passed out! She's bleeding!",
        "Nurse: What happened?",
        "Brad: Look, I don't know. I came home, I found her on the floor. She was bleeding. She lost consciousness before she could tell me what happened.",
        "Nurse: The doctor will be in in a moment. Could you please wait outside for a minute?",
        "Brad: No, I'm gonna stay here.",
        "Nurse: Please, sir, you need to do this for her.",
        "Brad: Please, god. Katie, don't you leave me.",
        "Casey: I know we haven't been getting along lately, but you know me. You know I'm not into drugs.",
        "Alison: I don't know what you want from me.",
        "Casey: I want you to tell them that they're not mine, that they have to be his.",
        "Alison: I don't know whose they are, casey! I don't have any idea.",
        "Casey: He's only doing this to save his own butt.",
        "Matt: That is backwards, and everybody knows it. This is about you trying to duck what you did, just like always.",
        "Casey: You think I would give reg something that would kill him?",
        "Matt: Yeah, I do, and I think you want me nailed for it 'cause you want me gone.",
        "Casey: I don't care what you do!",
        "Matt: You care that I've been spending more time with ali than you have.",
        "Margo: All right, come on, enough! Both of you, enough! Listen, if you know anything more about this, I want to hear it now.",
        "Alison: I already told you what I know. Just what they both told me.",
        "Margo: Have you ever seen either one of them using drugs?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Margo: Selling drugs?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Margo: You know anything more about these pills that were found?",
        "Alison: I don'T. I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: Come on, he's not going to admit anything to her!",
        "Matt: Because it never happened.",
        "Margo: You finished the search? Find anything?",
        "Cop: This.",
        "Margo: What's this?",
        "Cop: Found it in your son's room.",
        "Margo: Are you going to tell me this was a setup, too?",
        "Casey: No. It's mine.",
        "Vienna: Brad! Is she okay?",
        "Brad: I don't know -- they're still -- they're still examining her.",
        "Henry: What happened?",
        "Brad: I came home, I found her -- I found her on the floor.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my god!",
        "Henry: Have the doctors told you anything?",
        "Brad: Not yet.",
        "Henry: This is crazy. She was fine when you two left the lakeview.",
        "Brad: Outside, too. I mean, 20 minutes later, I come home, and she's unconscious and bleeding.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my god. She'll be okay.",
        "Brad: That's what I'm praying for.",
        "Doctor: Your wife had an ectopic pregnancy. It ruptured her fallopian tube, and she lost a great deal of blood.",
        "Brad: So what are you gonna do? I mean, how do you fix it?",
        "Doctor: We're going to take her to surgery.",
        "Brad: I don't understand -- how did this happen?",
        "Doctor: It's not uncommon in women taking fertility drugs.",
        "Brad: Fertility drugs? That's not right. This is messed up. I gotta --",
        "Vienna: No, brad. It's not messed up. Just let the doctor do his job.",
        "Brad: No, you don't understand. She knew how dangerous it was for her to get pregnant. That's why we stopped trying. She wasn't taking fertility drugs.",
        "Vienna: Yes, she was.",
        "Brad: What are you talking about?",
        "Vienna: Katie didn't give up having a baby. She was still trying.",
        "Brad: Did she tell you that she was using fertility drugs?",
        "Vienna: No, no, she didn't say, but it makes sense.",
        "Brad: No, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, not after what bob hughes said. I mean, he said that her body could not support a pregnancy right now.",
        "Vienna: She really wants a baby.",
        "Brad: So she lied to me? First about the diaphragm and now this.",
        "Vienna: But she knew that you didn't want to try.",
        "Brad: Yes, of course, vienna, of course I didn't want to try! Because I was afraid something was going to happen to her! And I was right.",
        "Vienna: It'll be okay.",
        "Brad: What if it isn't? What if it isn't? I'm sorry, I just -- I really cannot be around anyone right now.",
        "Henry: You didn't know?",
        "Vienna: That she was taking drugs? No.",
        "Henry: This is crazy. This is --",
        "Vienna: I know it seems that way. But a desire to have a child -- that's a very powerful thing, henry.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and look what it's done to her.",
        "Margo: Where did you get the cash?",
        "Casey: Not from selling drugs.",
        "Margo: That's not an answer.",
        "Casey: Do you really think I would sell poison to people just to make a few extra bucks?",
        "Margo: Where did the money come from?",
        "Tom: You're not helping yourself, casey.",
        "Casey: Like there's a chance I could.",
        "Margo: Answer my questions!",
        "Casey: It's only going to make things worse.",
        "Margo: I can't imagine that's possible.",
        "Casey: Okay. I won it.",
        "Margo: Where?",
        "Casey: At the track. I know a guy who told me about a horse that was a sure thing. And it was.",
        "Tom: And that is even worse?",
        "Casey: Yeah, and that's why i didn't spend any of the money. You know, it was the first time I slipped since I stopped gambling. And it made me want to puke.",
        "Tom: So, did you go to your sponsor? Go to a meeting?",
        "Casey: No, no, I -- I was too embarrassed.",
        "Tom: Well, you should be.",
        "Casey: I will. Look, but it doesn't prove I have nothing to do with those pills. Why would I be dealing drugs if I have all that cash?",
        "Margo: If that's where it came from.",
        "Casey: It did!",
        "Margo: Do you have the ticket?",
        "Casey: No, no, but I could give you the name of the horse and the race. You can look it up.",
        "Margo: Yeah, so could you if you had to come up with a cover story.",
        "Casey: You're not going to believe anything I say, are you?",
        "Margo: You just expect me to, casey. You have a ton of cash, you have a stash of pills, you have a couple of excuses that don't add up. But yet you just expect me to believe you?",
        "Casey: Yes! Yes, I do.",
        "Henry: Why didn't you tell me katie was lying to brad?",
        "Vienna: It wasn't my place. She confided in me. She didn't want him to know that she was trying, and if I told you, you would've told him.",
        "Henry: Yes, you're damn right I would've told him. Maybe he could've prevented her from putting her life in danger.",
        "Vienna: I didn't know that she was getting fertility treatments.",
        "Henry: Is that where you got the idea to poke holes in condoms? From her?",
        "Vienna: She told me that she had stopped using her diaphragm without telling brad. Yes.",
        "Henry: Thank god you didn't end up in the hospital.",
        "Vienna: I wouldn't because I don't have her medical problems. I'm built for childbearing. Among other things.",
        "Henry: It's not funny.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry. All I'm saying is that I wouldn't put my health at risk by getting pregnant.",
        "Henry: What about the health of our relationship, vienna? Have you thought about what all this deception is doing to that?",
        "Vienna: I love you, henry, and you know that.",
        "Henry: I love you, too. But I need to know that I can trust you.",
        "Vienna: And you can.",
        "Henry: No, I can'T.",
        "Casey: You have a choice. You can believe me or not. What's it going to be?",
        "Margo: No, I don't have a choice, casey. I have to order a full investigation.",
        "Casey: Fine, fine. Do what you have to do. Can I go now?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Casey: But I told you everything I know.",
        "Margo: I still have to question jade.",
        "Casey: So, you're going to arrest me?",
        "Margo: I hope not.",
        "Casey: But I'm basically dead meat. You know, I hope you're happy.",
        "Alison: Of course I'm not!",
        "Cop: We got his statement.",
        "Matt: So, can I go now? Are you going to charge me with something?",
        "Margo: No, not at the moment, but I want to know how I can get a hold of you.",
        "Matt: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Margo: Good.",
        "Matt: You ready?",
        "Alison: Sure. I have to get to the hospital anyway.",
        "Matt: I'll drop you off.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Jade: What did you tell them?",
        "Matt: Nothing that isn't true.",
        "Jade: So, now you want to talk to me?",
        "Margo: Well, I didn't know that you were involved.",
        "Jade: In what?",
        "Margo: I want to ask you some questions about your relationship with casey.",
        "Jade: What about him?",
        "Margo: How close is the relationship?",
        "Jade: We're friends.",
        "Margo: Good friends?",
        "Jade: Look, if this is about the other night at your house, it only happened that once.",
        "Margo: Did casey ask you to try and buy illegal drugs from matt?",
        "Jade: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Jade: 'Cause we wanted to find out if he was dealing or not.",
        "Margo: And did matt sell any to you?",
        "Jade: No, but the guy is definitely dealing.",
        "Margo: Well, how do you know that?",
        "Jade: I just know.",
        "Margo: Well, your opinion isn't going to make a conviction.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I know, that's why we wanted to find something concrete.",
        "Margo: All right, relax. I want to ask you something else. And if you lie, I'll know.",
        "Jade: I'm not lying.",
        "Margo: Has casey ever sold illegal drugs to you or anyone else you know?",
        "Jade: Casey? Are you serious?",
        "Margo: I am dead serious.",
        "Jade: Casey's messed up in a lot of ways, but he's no dealer.",
        "Margo: And you know because you know?",
        "Jade: Matt knew I was trying to set him up. He told me to tell casey it goes both ways.",
        "Margo: Matt said that?",
        "Jade: Yeah, and then, like, two minutes later those pills ended up in casey's bag.",
        "Margo: Oh, great. But still, that's not proof.",
        "Jade: What more do you need? You know casey. He's your son.",
        "Margo: Yeah, he is. But I don't know if I really know him at all. What is this \"minced\"? You feed me minced?",
        "Brad: The doctor says you lost a lot of blood, but you're going to be fine. You gave me the scare of my life.",
        "Katie: I don't know what happened.",
        "Brad: You had an ectopic pregnancy. You know what that is?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Brad: I almost lost you. Don't you ever do that to me again.",
        "Katie: I just wanted us to have our baby.",
        "Brad: You should've told me you were getting fertility treatments.",
        "Katie: I wanted it to be a surprise. Brad, I thought -- I really, really thought that I was okay. That I was strong and healthy. And that anything was possible.",
        "Brad: Well, next time you want to surprise me, how about that birthday party you kept hinting about?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you. I wish I would have.",
        "Brad: I wish you would have, too.",
        "Katie: I knew that you didn't want to try anymore.",
        "Brad: Because I don't want to risk your health. I mean, as much as I want a baby, I want you more.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, this is the last time I'll ever keep a secret from you.",
        "Brad: You promise?",
        "Katie: I promise. Do you forgive me?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I forgive you. Of course. You're okay. Nothing else matters.",
        "Casey: Ah, my mom arrest you, too?",
        "Jade: Not yet.",
        "Casey: Well, what did you tell her?",
        "Jade: The truth. That you think matt's dealing, and I tried to help you prove it.",
        "Casey: Did she believe you?",
        "Jade: She wants to.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but she needs proof first.",
        "Jade: But you can't blame her for that.",
        "Casey: Yes, I can. She knows matt. And she knows me.",
        "Jade: She knows you both went to jail. She has to ask herself if you're trying to clean up your act, maybe he is too.",
        "Casey: But look at the timing. He gets right back in town, the first think that happens is a good kid O.D.'S.",
        "Jade: Good kids O.D. All the time.",
        "Casey: It is not a coincidence.",
        "Jade: What about the fact that he's seeing your ex?",
        "Casey: That has nothing to do with it! I don't even care what alison does.",
        "Jade: We both know that's bull.",
        "Casey: Did you tell that to my mom, too?",
        "Jade: It didn't come up.",
        "Casey: Well, what did?",
        "Jade: Whether or not you were dealing.",
        "Casey: Well, what did you tell her?",
        "Jade: I said matt made a direct threat to set you up.",
        "Casey: Did she believe you?",
        "Jade: I think so. But you have big problems, and it's my bad for hooking up with you because the last thing I need is trouble with the cops.",
        "Casey: Yes, I'm sorry. I was a jerk.",
        "Jade: More than a jerk.",
        "Casey: Look, I really need your help to get out of this.",
        "Jade: Seriously? We had what I thought was a great night, and I wanted to see where it went. But then you blew me off and dragged me into this. Good luck, because I'm done.",
        "Matt: Hey.",
        "Alison: Hey, I thought I said I'd meet you later.",
        "Matt: Yeah, I had a feeling you were upset.",
        "Alison: No, I'm fine.",
        "Matt: Really?",
        "Alison: No. Casey and I were good friends once. And I don't know how it turned into this.",
        "Matt: Well, he's not an easy guy to get along with.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but it's not just him. I mean, I sent him all kinds of mixed signals.",
        "Matt: He wants what he wants. He always has. It's a big part of his problem.",
        "Alison: That's not what you said when you first showed up. I mean, you were the one who was trying to get us back together.",
        "Matt: I thought it was what you both wanted.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I couldn't figure out what I wanted from one day to the next. I guess he couldn't, either.",
        "Matt: So you're lucky. I mean, look where he is now.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Matt: Hey, you shouldn't let it get to you.",
        "Alison: I know I shouldn'T. But I do.",
        "Matt: It's okay.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I keep unloading on you.",
        "Matt: I don't mind.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but it's not fair.",
        "Matt: Don't worry about it. I like being your friend.",
        "Alison: Well, I like it, too. Don't let me screw it up. I'm good at that.",
        "Matt: Hey, it's not going to happen, okay?",
        "Margo: I can't stand this, having to come down so hard on our own son.",
        "Tom: What other choice do you have?",
        "Margo: I don't know. Selling real estate.",
        "Tom: Might be bad timing for that career move. Hey, I love that boy in there as much as you do, but he has to start taking responsibility for his own choices.",
        "Margo: But aren't we ultimately responsible for the bad choices he makes?",
        "Cop: The tox report on those pills.",
        "Margo: Thank you.",
        "Tom: I take it they're not aspirins.",
        "Margo: It's hydrocodone. Same manufacturer's lot as the ones that were found in reg.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Margo: Okay, so, now I really don't have a choice.",
        "Casey: So, what?",
        "Margo: The drugs found in your backpack match the ones that killed reg.",
        "Casey: That proves matt's involved!",
        "Margo: No, no, casey, it doesn't prove that at all.",
        "Casey: Well, the pills aren't mine. Jade told you he threatened to set me up!",
        "Margo: Jade came to town because she was running from an armed robbery warrant.",
        "Jade: But I thought you understood how that happened.",
        "Margo: I do. I do. My point being that you got to have some facts to back this up, because you're not a very credible witness.",
        "Casey: So, wait, wait, wait. So what do we do now?",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, baby. I have no choice but to place you under arrest.",
        "Casey: No, you never do.",
        "Margo: Read him his rights, print him, then throw him in the cell.",
        "Casey: No, you already got my prints.",
        "Tom: It's procedure, casey. Don't make it worse.",
        "Casey: Isn't that what I do best?",
        "Jade: I'm going to find a way to help you. I promise.",
        "Casey: I thought you were out.",
        "Jade: I'm not.",
        "Casey: Thanks.",
