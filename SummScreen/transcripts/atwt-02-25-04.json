        "Curtis: Aaron got up with this girl named Madison, Clark's ex.",
        "Aaron: He used the stuff on her, too. She broke up with the jerk, and I don't think she's ever gonna forget what happened that night.",
        "Curtis: And this dude Clark is still hookin' up.",
        "Aaron: Right, but not at metro.",
        "Curtis: Yeah, he's sworn off the place since he messed around with Lucy.",
        "Aaron: I've been checking out the area, it looks like Yo's is his new hangout spot.",
        "Alison: This is like really messed up, but why are you guys telling me this?",
        "Curtis: Because Alison, we can't do this without you.",
        "Alison: Do what?",
        "Aaron: Catch this jerk in action.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Mom, these are beautiful.",
        "Barbara: You think so?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, absolutely. You know, Marco sent over this bolt of raw silk.",
        "Barbara: Oh, that is not the color I had in mind.",
        "Jennifer: Really? I think it's stunning.",
        "Barbara: Well, okay. Okay, I'll try it on the evening suit. Keep it very simple.",
        "Jennifer: You know, I just can't wait till Paul sees the work that you've done.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, me too. You know what, Jen? Pack 'em up!",
        "Jennifer: Pack them up?",
        "Barbara: Pack everything up very carefully. These aren't just clothes, these are the proof my children believe in me again. And I want Paul to see what it's done for me. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Not so square, more like -- yes, Carly. Very good. [Doorbell rings] Go away please. [Doorbell rings] I said, \"please go away.\" Hello, Craig. What do you want?",
        "Craig: I want to talk to you. You working?",
        "Carly: I'm trying to. What's going on?",
        "Craig: Your Cousin Molly told Paul Ryan about Cabot. And he speed-dialed the Mounties.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. You don't know that for a fact.",
        "Craig: I know Paul Ryan blames his Mommy dearest on me, okay? And he's trying to get at me. All right? He wanted my wife vulnerable. He wanted my wife to turn to him in an hour of need. And he created an hour of need.",
        "Carly: Craig, he's her friend.",
        "Craig: And now he's working on Lucy too.",
        "Carly: Don't be ridiculous.",
        "Craig: Oh. He's her long-lost brother.",
        "Carly: Here's a wild idea, Craig. Maybe just maybe, Lucy's turning to Paul because she's a little ticked at you for losing Rosanna and Cabot.",
        "Craig: I know. All right. But I'm dealing with it. That's why I need your help.",
        "Carly: My help?",
        "Craig: Come on, Carly, we've done this before.",
        "Carly: Done what before?",
        "Craig: You can expose him for what he is. You just gotta get close to him. You can be his new best friend. You find out if Rosanna's called. You find out where she is.",
        "Carly: I don't think he knows where she is.",
        "Craig: Oh, he knows. And she needs help, okay? You use Paul the same way he used her.",
        "Carly: Do you honestly expect me to spy for you?",
        "Craig: For your sister.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Craig: See what?",
        "Paul: I'll come back some other time. Obviously this is a bad one.",
        "Craig: You came to see these? Carly, are you working with this",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: So what do you say, Ali?",
        "Alison: I'm in. Just tell me when and where.",
        "Aaron: I am not gonna forget this. You hear that?",
        "Alison: Like I don't owe you?",
        "Aaron: All right, listen. Show up at Yo's tonight. We're gonna make sure that Clark kid is there, and then we'll call your cell.",
        "Alison: And this whole underage thing won't be a problem, right?",
        "Curtis: I got a prep school buddy who can get his hands on some IDs.",
        "Aaron: No, no. We don't have enough time for that. Look, I don't want -- I don't event want you busted on a fake I.D. Right now.",
        "Curtis: That's cool.",
        "Aaron: Plus, I don't think Yo's is very picky anyway. So, I mean, my little brother could probably get in.",
        "Alison: Besides, I don't have to drink.",
        "Aaron: Especially if you come in acting like you're trashed. Make it look like it's the last stop of the night.",
        "Alison: And where will you two be?",
        "Curtis: I'm the eye-guy. I'll be gettin' it all on video.",
        "Aaron: And I'll be right behind him.",
        "Alison: Good, because I don't want to be a second alone with that dirt bag.",
        "Curtis: It's covered.",
        "Aaron: And if he spikes your drink --",
        "Curtis: We've got him.",
        "Aaron: I'm just gonna call Jack for backup.",
        "Curtis: But only after we nail him.",
        "Aaron: Ali, I gotta make sure you're okay with this. Are you positive you want to do this?",
        "Alison: Lucy is maybe the only girl who's ever even tried to be friends with me. And after what that disgusting guy did -- yeah, he's mine.",
        "Curtis: But are you cool with wearin' something -- you know, something that'll get you straight to the top of his radar screen?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, look. We don't have much time. We gotta advertise quick.",
        "Alison: Well, I've got a handkerchief that could pass as a skirt. Will that work?",
        "Alison: So when did guys like you start coming to a place like this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So -- pardon?",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm sorry. Hi, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Kim: Hi.",
        "Alison: Oh, I was just heading out. Sorry.",
        "Kim: Really? Where?",
        "Alison: Oh, just out.",
        "Kim: Oh, you're going to a costume party or something?",
        "Alison: Uh, no. Not exactly a party. But I gotta go, or I'm gonna be late.",
        "Kim: Ali, its cold out. I mean, you need a coat -- a long coat.",
        "Alison: No, no. I'll be fine. That heater in my car gets so hot. But can you just tell Chris that I won't be back too late.",
        "Kim: Well, where shall I tell him you've gone?",
        "Alison: It doesn't matter. I'll be back before he'll even miss me. See you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: The answer is no, forget it.",
        "Aaron: But, Jack --",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Aaron: We're gonna do all the work. All you have to do is arrest him.",
        "Jack: You need to stay out of this, Aaron. It's a police matter.",
        "Aaron: Then why aren't you guys tailing him?",
        "Jack: We don't have probable cause!",
        "Aaron: Probably cause? He almost raped Lucy. What else do you need?",
        "Jack: Proof that he used this drug on her.",
        "Aaron: Well, that's what we're gonna get.",
        "Jack: How?",
        "Aaron: Jack, just show up when I call you and you'll have everything you need to arrest Clark.",
        "Jack: Show up where, Aaron?",
        "Aaron: I'll call you when it's time.",
        "Jack: What are you up to? Look, you're just asking for trouble.",
        "Aaron: And this -- and Clark -- his next girlfriend, the next one after that -- is she asking for trouble, too?",
        "Jack: Now you listen. I want to bring this guy down as much as you do. And I wish I could authorize a sting myself. But I'd never get approval.",
        "Aaron: Then forget approval. Jack, if it's the right thing, it's the right thing. You know it, I know it. Let's just do this.",
        "Jack: Aaron, it's different this time.",
        "Aaron: Why, because you say so?",
        "Jack: No. Hey, I'm giving you a hell of a long rope here.",
        "Aaron: I'm not asking for your permission, Jack.",
        "Jack: No, Aaron, settle down. Wait a second. I'll bring the guy in --",
        "Aaron: And you're gonna hold him?",
        "Jack: I'll talk to him; scare the hell out of him. Maybe if knows someone's watching him he'll stop.",
        "Aaron: Then he's just gonna find somewhere else to go. Then what?",
        "Jack: It's the best I can do.",
        "Aaron: Jack, he's a rapist. You're telling me its okay for a rapist to be walking around the streets like this? There's no way. I'm doing this myself.",
        "Jack: Aaron, come back. Aaron, come on! Get back -- follow him, haul him back in here for me, please. Come on, pick up the damn phone.",
        "Cop: I was too late, Detective. He peeled off in his car.",
        "Jack: Damn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hi, Lucinda, I'm sorry to intrude. I need to talk to Lucy. Is she around?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, this is not a good time.",
        "Jack: No, it's not a request.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, you already spoke to her about Clark. Is there some other problem?",
        "Jack: I hope not.",
        "Lucinda: Come on in. Come on. She's in the library. Lucy, darling, Jack is here and he needs to speak to you.",
        "Lucy: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hi. I'm looking for Aaron. Have you seen him tonight?",
        "Lucy: No.",
        "Jack: He hasn't called or talked to you in the last few hours?",
        "Lucy: No, why?",
        "Lucinda: Is Aaron in trouble?",
        "Jack: Well, it looks like he's heading in that direction.",
        "Lucy: What did he do?",
        "Jack: He came up with a plan to get Clark for the attempted rape.",
        "Lucy: No, he didn't.",
        "Lucinda: What's the plan?",
        "Jack: He didn't give me any details. Are you sure he didn't discuss any of this with you?",
        "Lucy: No. This is the first I've heard about it.",
        "Jack: Lucy, if you know anything at all --",
        "Lucy: No, I don't, really.",
        "Jack: Okay, I had to ask. Look, my guess is he's come up with some kind of sting. If he calls or stops in will you let me know right away?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, we will. We will.",
        "Lucy: Jack, I don't want Aaron getting in trouble because of me.",
        "Jack: I'm doing whatever I can to make sure he stays clean. I've got a couple of guys out there looking for him.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you mean they're looking for Aaron, but they're not looking for Clark?",
        "Jack: We're doing our best.",
        "Lucinda: Let us know when you find him.",
        "Jack: I'll see myself out.",
        "Lucy: I told Aaron to stay out of this.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, he's indignant! He's outraged on your behalf. And I agree with him. I think it's very heartening, in the midst of all this dishonesty.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but this happened to me, not Aaron. Why can't he just understand that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Holden, it's me. I know it's a bad time, could you meet me at the station? I'll explain everything when we get there. I wouldn't ask, but it's about Aaron. I'm worried about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clark: You haven't even touched your drink.",
        "Megan: This place is so sketchy, Clark.",
        "Clark: What's wrong with going to a different place once in a while? The little princess needs to expand her horizons. What's up, Megan? You've been jumpy all night.",
        "Megan: I don't get why we couldn't have gone to Metro.",
        "Clark: It's always about being seen in the right places, isn't it? I thought you wanted to be with me.",
        "Megan: I'm sorry, Clark, but I'm kind of tired.",
        "Clark: Okay, bottoms up and I'll drive you home.",
        "Megan: If you want it so much, you drink it.",
        "Clark: And if you want to go home so bad, here take a cab.",
        "Alison: Club soda, straight up.",
        "Clark: Throw in a shot of rum, and I'm buying.",
        "Alison: Oh, thank you anyway, I'm taking a breather. You have to pace yourself, know what I mean? You heard the guy, he's buying. What's the holdup?",
        "Clark: Calm down, it's coming. I see you're a girl who likes getting her way.",
        "Alison: Only all the time.",
        "Clark: Honest, I really like that.",
        "Alison: So what else do you like?",
        "Clark: Stick around, and maybe we'll find out.",
        "Alison: What, you're thinking about buying me?",
        "Clark: You know, you look really familiar --",
        "Alison: Now that is the oldest line in the book.",
        "Clark: No, no, no. Seriously, I swear I've seen you before.",
        "Alison: Well, you have.",
        "Clark: Where?",
        "Alison: In your dreams.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Carly, you know, I can come back some other time.",
        "Craig: Why, Carly?",
        "Carly: Why is it your business, Craig.",
        "Craig: Because it is.",
        "Paul: I'm here to give Carly my opinion of her sketches.",
        "Craig: What did he promise you? Whatever it is, it's not worth it.",
        "Carly: Paul, would it be all right if we did this another time?",
        "Craig: Carly --",
        "Paul: Yeah, sure. Would it be all right with you if I just take this?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Craig: Carly?",
        "Carly: Yeah, look at it. Think about it. Let me know what you think.",
        "Paul: I will call you.",
        "Craig: Did you sign anything?",
        "Carly: Put that down.",
        "Craig: He's using you now, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, at least he's not giving me credit for Barbara's work.",
        "Craig: He'll do worse.",
        "Carly: Stop calling the kettle black.",
        "Craig: Carly, listen. You and I have always had an understanding.",
        "Carly: An understanding? Like when you humiliated me at Monte Carlo? That kind of understanding, Craig?",
        "Craig: You throw in with Paul Ryan and your only dreams will be nightmares.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: It's beautiful, Carly. A couple more like this, we'll set the fashion world on its ear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Carly, you need reliable. You need lasting.",
        "Carly: I wouldn't be talking about things that last if I were you. Rosanna thought that she had a family that was gonna last, right? And look what happened to her.",
        "Craig: Everything I did, I did purely out of love for my wife. All right? What were his motives? What were his motives when he threw that hissy fit at the altar and broke his bride's heart, all right? What were his motives when he made that anonymous phone call to the Canadian police just to turn me in?",
        "Carly: Paul is the villain here? Not you, not the guy who got a baby from the black market and swore that he would never be taken away? Am I turning blue yet? Because I swear that I've said this before. But let me tell it to you one more time for the record. Rosanna left because of you, not Paul -- you.",
        "Craig: All right, fine. You want to go work for him, you go right ahead. But you better find out where your sister is.",
        "Carly: Why? So you can lie to her some more?",
        "Craig: Don't worry about me, all right? But you better worry about your sister. And you better worry about your backside.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you. Thank you so much for your faith in my judgment.",
        "Craig: You make a deal with the devil, the devil always wins.",
        "Carly: Hey! Who are you to lecture me on my life? When was the last time you made a good choice, huh?",
        "Craig: The day I married your sister. And I never thought you'd betray her for a job.",
        "Carly: I am not betraying Rosanna. Get out of here. Get out! Go, now!",
        "Craig: All right, I hope they're paying you a lot. 'Cause I guess finding your sister isn't as important as being a B.R.O. employee. Good luck. Bye.",
        "Carly: I don't need your luck. And I don't need to be your spy! Betray Rosanna -- who the hell does he think he is?",

        "Kim: Chris, hi, darling. I didn't hear you come in.",
        "Chris: Hey, Mom. Did the guy from the bank call today?",
        "Kim: Not that I'm aware of.",
        "Chris: I was hoping he'd give a good faith estimate on a condo by now. Where's Alison?",
        "Kim: She went out.",
        "Chris: Out where?",
        "Kim: Didn't say.",
        "Chris: Well, that's weird. I know she's not on the roster at the hospital.",
        "Kim: Oh, there's no way she was on her way to the hospital. She had a ton of makeup on. I actually almost didn't recog --",
        "Chris: Mom, Alison doesn't wear a lot of makeup.",
        "Kim: Well, tonight she did.",
        "Chris: I wonder what's going on.",
        "Kim: I haven't a clue. But whatever it is, she really didn't want me to know about it.",
        "Chris: Did you ask?",
        "Kim: I did, a couple times.",
        "Chris: I'll call her on her cell and find out what's going on.",

        "Clark: If you win, I'll take you out to dinner at the Lakeview. And if you miss --",
        "Alison: No, I never ever miss.",
        "Clark: Okay, here we go. Gotcha.",
        "Alison: You cheated.",
        "Clark: Yeah, but it was worth it. Here. You win.",

        "Clark: Aren't you gonna get that?",
        "Alison: Nope. It's just Mr. Stick-in-the-mud. It's my boyfriend. He's getting on my last nerve, you know?",
        "Clark: Well, forget about him.",
        "Alison: Forget about who?",

        "Jack: He's out to get the kid who almost raped Lucy.",
        "Holden: Get him how?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure. He came here to ask me if I'd make an arrest once he has proof.",
        "Holden: What kind of proof?",
        "Jack: I don't know. He wouldn't say.",
        "Holden: Well, where is he now?",

        "Aaron: It's okay. When we get something I'll call him. I know Jack. He'll show up. [Phone rings] Hold on a second. Hello.",
        "Chris: Aaron, hey, it's chrism. Yeah, I got your number from Emma. I'm sorry to bother you, but --",
        "Aaron: No, no problem. What's up?",
        "Chris: It's Alison. I can't seem to find her. She's not answering her cell. Well, I was hoping maybe you knew where she was?",
        "Aaron: Alison's fine.",

        "Alison: I don't know, I mean he has his moments.",
        "Clark: Well, they can't be that great. You're here alone. How about another drink? Maybe something a little stronger this time.",

        "Clark: Sure. Bartender, a root beer for the lady.",

        "Paul: It is. Yeah, I've been getting dozens of them in the mail since we announced we're reorganizing. This one is from some student in Milan.",
        "Barbara: Really?",
        "Paul: Yeah, every junior designer from here to Tokyo is dying for a shot at working with you, Mom.",
        "Barbara: It looks a little mature to be by a student. Why didn't you want me to see it?",
        "Paul: Come on, you know how the creative mind works. Competition can kill you. And, Mom, you don't need to compare yourself to anyone. I'm not kidding. You really are incomparable.",
        "Barbara: Thank you, darling.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Still, I am thinking about starting a file, you know, with all the names and resumes in case we do decide to hire someone, someone maybe later.",
        "Barbara: That's an excellent idea. What, you thought I'd be upset?",
        "Paul: So you would welcome the idea of new blood?",
        "Barbara: Well, if they fit the B.R.O. style, why not? Yes. You were expecting a tantrum from me, weren't you? But you know what? I'm in a different place now, a wonderful place. And I'm so glad you're thinking about the future.",
        "Paul: Oh, I'm definitely thinking about the future.",
        "Barbara: It shows me that you have faith in the present.",
        "Paul: I do.",
        "Barbara: Good. And on that note, I want you to see this. I decided to hang the waist line a little bit differently on this, a longer bodice. What do you think?",

        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Paul: So what did Craig have to say?",
        "Carly: Well, you know Craig. He's blaming you. He's blaming me. He's blaming the whole world for what happened with Rosanna and Cabot.",
        "Paul: Well, that figures.",
        "Carly: So has Rosanna called you? I was hoping that one of us would have heard from her by now.",
        "Paul: No, I've left like a million messages on her cell, she hasn't called me back.",
        "Carly: Same here.",
        "Paul: So did you bring anything that you can show me?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I have the sketches that I finished. But before I show them to you, I need to ask you something.",
        "Paul: Shoot.",
        "Carly: Craig's got me really crazy. I know we've already talked about this, but --",
        "Paul: But you're still having doubts?",
        "Carly: No. Maybe. Craig just seems so convinced that you are the person who tipped off the Canadian authorities about Cabot.",
        "Paul: Carly, I have told you over and over again that I had nothing to do with Rosanna losing her baby. I was ready to give up my entire life so that she could start over again with Cabot. And if that doesn't remove all of your doubts, I don't know what will.",
        "Carly: Craig says that Molly told you about the problems with the adoption.",
        "Paul: Yeah, she did. But I didn't tell anybody about it. I'm confused. You think that I used that information somehow?",
        "Carly: Craig thinks so.",
        "Paul: I don't really care what Craig thinks -- Carly, I didn't tell anybody about the adoption. I certainly didn't tell the Canadian Mounties. I wouldn't do anything to hurt Rosanna like that. I care about her, I truly do. And if she hadn't asked me to turn that plane around, I wouldn't even be having this conversation with you. But if you're having doubts, you need to express them with me now, Carly. 'Cause if you want to turn your back on working for me at B.R.O. -- if you want to make this not work for some reason, the door is right there. But the decision, Carly, is yours not mine.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry that I had to ask. My sister's happiness is much more important to me than my career.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Carly: If you're the man that I think you are, you'll respect that and you won't try to back me into a corner. I asked. You answered. The discussion is over. And for the record, I do believe you.",
        "Paul: Okay. Still got something you want to show me?",
        "Carly: I thought you'd never ask.",
        "Paul: Come on. Sit down. Here, have a seat.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Paul: Oh, wow.",
        "Carly: Well -- now -- now most of these some are just preliminary. But I think the last two could go straight to production.",
        "Paul: Oh, Carly, they're great. This is exactly what B.R.O. needs -- it's a young vision for a younger line.",
        "Carly: So you don't think that I went a little too far with that --",
        "Paul: Too far? No. I don't think you could go too far. You are very -- very talented. And it would be a shame for this idea to just be wasted on a sketch.",
        "Carly: Oh, and for the record, Jack is on board here.",
        "Paul: What? About you working at B.R.O.?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah. He wants this for me. But I should warn you, he's on guard.",
        "Paul: Well, yeah, I don't blame him. I would be on guard, too. Look, I -- I want more than just your talent, Carly. I want you to trust me. I want for you to believe that I'm not the kind of guy that would ever do anything to hurt Rosanna.",
        "Carly: I do believe that.",
        "Paul: All right. I hope Jack can deal with your success. Because every woman in the United States is gonna want to be seen in these clothes. Carly, you're a star. And B.R.O. is gonna help you shine.",
