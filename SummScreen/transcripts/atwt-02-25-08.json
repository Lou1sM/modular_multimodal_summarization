The Oakdale PD tries to keep Kit in town, but her lawyer threatens a lawsuit. Dallas calls Jack and tells him that they are going to have to cut Kit free soon. Katie breaks down and Brad hopes it is because he is talking about his night with Bonnie, but Katie explains that it has to do with Jack. Carly is upset that Katie's call screwed up their plan, but Jack doesn't want Carly to blame Katie; he is the one who forgot to turn off his phone. Ameera is unaccustomed to the US lifestyle and then she and Noah talk about how different they saw his dad. Aaron explains that he has to leave town because his mom had a relapse; Allison is immediately apologetic. Matt seems to know Gray when he visits Vienna. Vienna tells Gray that she can't accept his offer or his necklace. Gray continues to flirt and be persistent. Vienna can't help be flattered, but she professes her love for Henry again. Ameera tries to convince Noah that he should give his dad another chance because of how wonderfully he treated her and her mom. Noah explains that he is in jail because he killed his mother and tried to kill Luke; he won't forgive that.

Henry bumps into Kit, pretends to be a buyer of nightclubs, and convinces her to show him the club promising he will most likely buy it. Kit cancels her cab and leaves with him. Kit shows Henry Metro and explains non-chalantly what happened when Henry comments on the Police tape. She turns it into a selling point in her mind. Henry pretends to accept this and makes an offer. When Kit sees how much he is willing to pay, she tells him that her price was only for her share. Henry explains that he needs 24 hours then. Kit isn't sure, but she is convinced when Henry offers her money as a down payment. Luke and Noah talk privately about not wanting Ameera to go back to Iraq and face all that danger she talks about, as Ameera listens without them knowing.

        "Brad: The only egg I want is a cure for a hangover, which I tried, and didn't work. Sweetheart, can you do me a major favor? Save my life and get me an aspirin?",
        "Makeup artist: I'll see what I can do. Must have been some night.",
        "Brad: Yeah, it was. That Bonnie, she really knows how to party. She can put away those shooters. I don't know what happened next, but I think a hangover is a small price to pay. Mmmm... what are you eating?",
        "Brad: Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on. I don't want you to be upset. Was it something that I said?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brad: I hurt your feelings?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brad: I mean -- that really touches me, shows me that you care.",
        "Katie: What are you talking about?",
        "Brad: I mean, you really thought you meant it when you said you didn't want to have anything to do with me. But I mean, if you're this upset because I've been dating Bonnie, then maybe you're stuck on old Brad, after all. I know how to make it better. Give us a kiss.",
        "Katie: You've got it all wrong.",
        "Brad: I do?",
        "Katie: I'm not upset because of you, Brad. I'm upset because of Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I know you're upset, Carly, but this isn't Katie's fault. She had no idea what we were trying to do.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm, so, what now?",
        "Jack: We'll pray that Dallas can detain Kit long enough for us to come up with another plan. [Cell phone rings] That's him. Hey, what's going on?",
        "Dallas: I just wanted to give you a heads-up.",
        "Jack: Is there a problem?",
        "Dallas: Yeah, Kit's lawyer is threatening to call a judge and press harassment charges against the Oakdale P.D.",
        "Jack: Can't you come up with some technicality to hold her?",
        "Dallas: Sorry, if I don't let Kit go now, I'll be jeopardizing the whole department.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I hear you, I do, and I know I'm asking you to do a lot, but you've got to keep Kit in town for just a little while longer.",
        "Dallas: She's filling out paperwork with the lawyer right now. As soon as she's done, she's out of here.",
        "Jack: I'm on my way.",
        "Carly: That didn't sound promising.",
        "Jack: I've got to head to the station and try to find a way to keep Kit from leaving town.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Jack: I have no idea, but I better think of something quick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: What do you want to do today?",
        "Ameera: I'm not sure. I really don't know my way around Oakdale very well.",
        "Noah: Well, we can fix that. We'll go in my truck. I'll show you around -- if that's okay with you.",
        "Ameera: In Iraq, young men and women don't ride on cars alone.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm not going to take advantage of you or something, if that's what you're worried about. I'm gay, remember?",
        "Ameera: I know I can trust you, Noah. You were a gentleman last night.",
        "Noah: Well, if we can sleep in the same room, we can sit in a truck together.",
        "Ameera: I suppose I have to get used to it. America is amazing, but it can be intimidating. I almost didn't have the courage to find you.",
        "Noah: You just need someone to show you the ropes. I mean, to show you around. I'll be your tour guide. Once you see what Oakdale's like, you'll never want to leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I know what you're up to.",
        "Aaron: Oh, really? Why don't you fill me in, Alison?",
        "Alison: You're judging me, like you always do.",
        "Aaron: You're wrong, okay? All I'm doing is trying to find out something about the new guy that you're seeing. That's all I'm doing.",
        "Alison: I'm not seeing Matt, we're just having breakfast.",
        "Aaron: Well, I think you should be more careful.",
        "Alison: Why? Because someone with my past could never be a decent judge of character, right?",
        "Aaron: Wrong.",
        "Alison: What do you think, because you don't know him, he must be some kind of lowlife?",
        "Aaron: Ali, I never even said that!",
        "Alison: You didn't have to.",
        "Matt: Is there a problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Ameera, am I walking too fast?",
        "Ameera: No, not really.",
        "Noah: I thought maybe you couldn't keep up.",
        "Ameera: I'm accustomed to always walk a few steps behind the men.",
        "Noah: Well, okay, in America, we do it like this.",
        "Ameera: I need to get used to the way things are done here.",
        "Noah: It's okay, take your time. I'll show you.",
        "Ameera: So many books! And people can read whatever they want with no censoring.",
        "Noah: I thought there was more freedom now in Iraq.",
        "Ameera: There is, but change takes time.",
        "Noah: It must be really tough.",
        "Ameera: It is. I love to read, but there are still certain limitations. Before, under Saddam, there were people everywhere, making sure no one broke the rules.",
        "Noah: I can't imagine living like that. I mean, being here, living with Luke, what would happen to us there?",
        "Ameera: That would be a very serious crime. Your relationship would not be tolerated in my country.",
        "Noah: Well, the truth is, it's not always tolerated here.",
        "Ameera: Luke is your -- boyfriend, and do you love him?",
        "Noah: Yes.",
        "Ameera: And Luke's parents and grandmother know, and they have no problem with letting you stay in their home?",
        "Noah: Lily and Holden have been great and really accepting. Emma's had her reservations, but I think that's more to do with us being young and involved than the fact that we're gay.",
        "Ameera: What about the colonel? Does he accept you and Luke?",
        "Noah: My father is very narrow-minded and prejudiced. He -- he hates that I'm gay. As long as I'm with Luke, he wants nothing to do with me.",
        "Ameera: I can't believe that. Colonel Mayer is a fine man. How could he reject his son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I don't understand. Do I really have to return the necklace?",
        "Henry: How can you even ask me that question?",
        "Vienna: But it was a friendly gift. It would be rude to give it back.",
        "Henry: It would be worse to keep it. Do you know what it makes me feel like to see that thing around your neck?",
        "Vienna: It should make you feel happy because you know I love diamonds, and these were for free.",
        "Henry: No, they weren't for free. Gray is going to want to get his money's worth. And besides, I don't want guys buying you expensive gifts when I can't.",
        "Vienna: All right. If you can't stand the necklace, I think we should hock it. Because we -- we could use the money.",
        "Henry: No, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: What is your problem, Henry? Necklace, no necklace, my heart belongs to you.",
        "Henry: That's very sweet, and I love your heart, but the diamond choker around your neck is kind of a deal breaker.",
        "Vienna: All right, I don't need the necklace. All I need is you.",
        "Henry: Okay, that's my girl.",
        "Vienna: But Gray did make another offer, and I think we should take him up on it.",
        "Henry: No, we've already talked about this. He gets to spend the night with you, and we get the diner back? Forget it.",
        "Vienna: No, this is a brand new offer. And I didn't mention it before because I know that the mere mentioning of his name makes you furious.",
        "Henry: Yes, that's right. It does.",
        "Vienna: Okay, so while you were sleeping, Gray called, and he offered to return the diner because he knows how much it means to me. No strings, no diamonds, no romantic night. Just think about it, we can have our lives back together. Just the way it is was. Please say yes, for me?",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Vienna: Henry, why are you being so stubborn? I'm not going to sleep with Gray. He's simply giving us back the diner back for nothing. And if you loved me, you would want me to have it, too.",
        "Henry: Would you listen to yourself? Why do you think that Gray would give you the diner for free?",
        "Vienna: Because he likes me?",
        "Henry: Yeah. He likes you way too much, that's the rub.",
        "Vienna: No, no. There will be no rub. No back rub, or neck rub, or naked body rub --",
        "Henry: Oh. Ai-yi-yi, come on, come on, come on.",
        "Vienna: All we have to do is graciously accept Gray's offer, and you were the one who lost Al's in a poker game.",
        "Henry: I know. I know, and I feel terrible about that, but I do not want to owe Gray anything, and neither should you. Okay? We take one penny from the guy and then we are beholden, and trust me, he will want some payback. And I will not like it. So, in case you didn't hear me the first time, the answer is no!",
        "Vienna: But why are you being so unreasonable? If you love me --",
        "Henry: I am not being unreasonable. And I do love you, and I don't want to lose you, but this is my line in the sand, okay? Now, either you give back the diamond, and you promise not to accept any more favors from Gray, or we are through.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: If your father was so prejudiced, he would have never helped an Iraqi woman and her child.",
        "Noah: I know my father was good to you and your mother, but the way he treated me and Luke, it's unforgivable.",
        "Ameera: The Colonel Mayer I knew was so kind and generous. He used to buy me pretty clothes and books to read. He was the best thing to happen to me in my life.",
        "Noah: I'm glad he was nice to you, but --",
        "Ameera: He was more. There were times we would have died if it wasn't for his protection. He was always gentle and respectful. He knew our lives were hard. All he wanted was to help us.",
        "Noah: Honestly, Ameera, if I hadn't seen the picture of the two of you, I'd think this whole thing was some case of mistaken identity.",
        "Ameera: Why does it upset you to hear good things about your father? Why are you so angry when you should be proud?",
        "Noah: You wouldn't understand.",
        "Ameera: I think I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: You seem upset. Is there anything I can do to help?",
        "Aaron: It's pretty obvious Alison doesn't want me here, so I'm going to head home.",
        "Alison: See ya.",
        "Aaron: I mean, I only came by to tell you Mom had a relapse, so I'm gonna be heading back to Seattle for a while.",
        "Alison: Oh, Aaron. Is she going to be okay?",
        "Aaron: I hope so.",
        "Alison: Aaron, I'm really sorry. I -- please, give Julie my best and tell her I hope she feels better.",
        "Aaron: I will, Ali, I will.",
        "Alison: Aaron, I'm sorry that I was testy with you.",
        "Aaron: Not a problem. Sit. Bye.",
        "Matt: Exes can give you grief sometimes, huh?",
        "Alison: Yeah. It's not so easy to escape your past.",
        "Matt: Yeah, tell me about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: I think I know why you're so upset. It must be difficult for you to hear about your father being with another woman.",
        "Noah: Not even close, Ameera.",
        "Ameera: It's true I loved the Colonel like a father, but I'm sure that didn't make him love you any less. Is that what's bothering you?",
        "Noah: I never doubted how much the Colonel loved me. It's how he chose to show it, by controlling me, and --",
        "Ameera: What is it? You can tell me.",
        "Noah: He tried to kill Luke.",
        "Ameera: No.",
        "Noah: He seriously couldn't handle our relationship. He said it made him sick.",
        "Ameera: You must speak to him, explain it to him.",
        "Noah: I don't want to see him ever again. He's in jail, and that's where he belongs.",
        "Ameera: Because he tried to kill Luke?",
        "Noah: Yeah, that and -- he killed my mother, okay? He didn't want me to know that she was a prostitute, so he -- I shouldn't be laying this on you. I'm sorry.",
        "Ameera: No, I'm sorry. I had no idea.",
        "Noah: So you see what I mean? It's like we knew two different Colonel Mayers.",
        "Ameera: I can't believe it.",
        "Noah: I have a hard time believing it, too. Look, forget I said anything. You're -- you're coming into a new country and settling in. You've got a lot to deal with right now. This wasn't the right time to bring this up.",
        "Ameera: I guess we experienced your father in very different ways.",
        "Noah: Yeah. You know, it's weird. In spite of how horrible he was to me, I'm jealous that you got to see this gentle side of him, a side that I never got to see.",
        "Ameera: I'm so sorry, Noah.",
        "Noah: It hurts knowing that he was able to show others so much respect and kindness, and he wasn't able to do that with his own son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Do you know that guy?",
        "Matt: You know, for a minute I thought I did. I think he just reminds me of somebody, though. So, that now we have finished the most important meal of the day, do you want to go for a walk through Old Town? Or did your ex scare you off me?",
        "Alison: He didn't, and I'd love to.",
        "Matt: Excellent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry, Gray. I tried to convince Henry. But he won't accept your kind offer to return the diner.",
        "Gray: Well, I'm truly disappointed, Vienna. I know how much this place means to you.",
        "Vienna: It does. The customers will miss their pepparkakor, that's for sure. And one more thing.",
        "Gray: Diamonds become you, Vienna. Are you sure you want to give it back?",
        "Vienna: It's beautiful, but Henry insists.",
        "Gray: Okay. But before we say good-bye forever, I do have one last request.",
        "Vienna: What is it?",
        "Gray: Have dinner with me tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: My stupid phone call spoiled the set-up Jack was trying to pull on Kit. He almost had a confession out of her, and I blew it.",
        "Brad: Well, don't be so hard on yourself. How are you supposed to know that he was in the middle of some scam? He should have turned the stupid thing off.",
        "Katie: That was their one big chance to get Parker off for Sam's murder.",
        "Brad: Katie, I know Jack. He's going to come up with something else.",
        "Katie: I love that kid so much. I want to help him instead of messing things up for him.",
        "Brad: Wait a minute, wait a minute, you said -- Jack thinks if he had more time with Kit, he could get her to confess.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but she's going to get out of town as soon as she can, and then Parker's case will be that much harder to win.",
        "Brad: I wish I could think of something, but right now, I don't have a clue.",
        "Katie: Its okay, Brad, thank you anyway. I just didn't expect you to.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need my best friend right now.",
        "Katie: Henry, what's wrong?",
        "Henry: It's Vienna. She's got this major bling from this less-than-reputable admirer.",
        "Brad: Never mind that right now.",
        "Henry: I beg --",
        "Brad: I have an idea.",
        "Henry: This is Henry time, not Brad time.",
        "Brad: Listen to me, listen to me, it's got to wait, okay? Right now we need a favor.",
        "Henry: I don't know why I bother?",
        "Katie: Wait, hold on, what are you thinking?",
        "Brad: Trust me. If this works, you're going to be golden in Jack's eyes.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brad: Cross my heart. But just remember, I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for Parker. Okay, hear me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Kit still here?",
        "Dallas: No, sorry, she left, man.",
        "Jack: Damn it.",
        "Dallas: Look, I'm sorry, I tried, but I ran out of reasons to keep holding her --",
        "Jack: I know we didn't have a legal leg to stand on, Dallas, but I was hoping, I was just hoping --",
        "Dallas: Jack -- you know, the way you're going all about this all half-cocked and bending the rules? You're only going to get yourself in trouble, man.",
        "Jack: This is my son's life we're talking about. Do you understand that? I will do anything --",
        "Brad: Jack --",
        "Jack: Anything it takes --",
        "Brad: Look, I'm glad you're still here. Listen to me, Katie --",
        "Jack: What do you want, Brad?",
        "Brad: Katie filled me in. She said you're having a problem keeping Kit in town --",
        "Jack: What does this have to do with you?",
        "Brad: I've got a solution. Do you want to hear it?",
        "Jack: No, not particularly. The last thing we need is one of your hare-brained schemes that always end up disaster. You stay out of it, do you hear me? Out of it.",
        "Brad: Well, I'm sorry. It's too late.",
        "Jack: Tell me this isn't some idiotic game you're playing because you're trying to impress Katie. Parker's life is at stake, Brad.",
        "Brad: I know that, Jack --",
        "Jack: His freedom's at stake. I don't need you screwing it up.",
        "Brad: He's my nephew. I love him, too.",
        "Jack: Okay, then butt out. I'm in enough trouble as it is, stretching what I can do legally. Don't make matters worse for me.",
        "Brad: In that case, maybe it's better if you're in the dark. What you don't know can't hurt you.",
        "Jack: What -- stay out of it!",
        "Brad: Listen to me -- my plan is going to work, I promise, and you're going to thanking me when Parker's free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What do you want, Katie?",
        "Katie: I came to apologize. Jack told me what happened when I called last night. I'm so sorry.",
        "Carly: I bet you are. You lost some brownie points with Jack, huh?",
        "Katie: This has nothing to do with Jack. This is about Parker. I would never do anything to hurt him.",
        "Carly: Well, you did.",
        "Katie: And I'd like to help make it right.",
        "Carly: We don't need your help, Katie. Jack and I have everything under control. In case you're forgotten, Parker's our son. We are working together as a family to help him.",
        "Katie: Yes, I know you are.",
        "Carly: Well, if you mean what you say, then I'll tell you what you can do to help. You stay as far away from us as humanly possible. We don't need your help.",
        "Katie: Well, whether you want it or not, Carly, you've got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clerk: I have your bags right here, Ms. Fowler.",
        "Kit: Okay, great, great. Hey, how about a taxi to the airport? I can't really afford a limo.",
        "Clerk: No problem. What time is your flight?",
        "Kit: As soon as I get there.",
        "Clerk: I'll call you a cab.",
        "Kit: Okay, great.",
        "Henry: Excuse me, Ma'am? Kit Fowler, right?",
        "Kit: You know me?",
        "Henry: Well, I heard you had some property for sale, one that I might be very interested in purchasing.",
        "Kit: Who exactly told you that?",
        "Henry: Well, I deal with so many lawyers and brokers, it escapes me at the moment. If I may elaborate, though?",
        "Kit: Well, I don't really have much time.",
        "Henry: I'll be brief. I run a series of successful nightclubs in major cities, and I was hoping to open one here in Oakdale for upscale clientele. I hear Metro might be on the market.",
        "Kit: Well, yeah, it definitely is, to the highest bidder, of course.",
        "Henry: Yes, of course, of course. When I can I see it? Oh, I see you're checking out. I guess now isn't the right time.",
        "Kit: No, no, it's a great time. It's a great time. Cancel that cab, okay? Look, you'll love it. Its hip, it's cool, very upscale.",
        "Henry: Oh, excellent.",
        "Kit: Yeah.",

        "Gray: Without the diner, Henry won't be able to afford to take you out to a five-star meal. Vintage champagne, caviar, whatever your heart desires.",
        "Vienna: Well, I do love caviar.",
        "Gray: We'll order by the pound. I want to see you in your natural environment, one last time.",
        "Vienna: I'm flattered, but I can't accept.",
        "Gray: Sure I can't tempt you?",
        "Vienna: Henry would never understand. And my relationship with Henry is way too important to risk that. I love him so much.",
        "Gray: He's a very lucky man. But if I have to spend the rest of my life without you, at least afford me the pleasure of your company over a cup of coffee? Come on, I promise I won't bite.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Isn't it a little cold to be hanging out on a bench in Old town?",
        "Noah: I was just giving Ameera a tour of Oakdale and we started talking about my father.",
        "Luke: Well, I know you have a lot to sort out about the Colonel. Did I come at a bad time?",
        "Noah: No, no, not at all.",
        "Ameera: I didn't realize speaking about his father would upset him. You both been so good to me, the last thing I want to do is cause problems.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: So I'm glad Aaron didn't scare you off me.",
        "Alison: Oh, hardly.",
        "Matt: Hey, if you're free, we can go see a movie. I'm sure there is an early show, you know.",
        "Alison: Before we turn this into a real date, I think there's something I should tell you.",
        "Matt: Yeah, be my guest.",
        "Alison: You saw how angry I got at my ex for interrogating you.",
        "Matt: Yeah, I noticed.",
        "Alison: Well, the truth is, he was doing that because I have a past that I'm not really proud of. And Aaron is always finding ways of reminding me of it.",
        "Matt: We all have a past, you know, nobody's perfect.",
        "Alison: True. True, but before we go any further, I feel like I should tell you the truth about it. This way, you can bail out if you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: You're perfect, you know that?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, you really have to stop this flattery.",
        "Gray: No chance.",
        "Vienna: Sorry, but I should get going. There's so much to do before I hand over the diner.",
        "Gray: Just a few more minutes, please? Let's have some of that pepparkakor. That is a treat I will sorely miss.",
        "Vienna: You're very sweet, Gray, but you're wasting your time with me.",
        "Gray: One last look at my dream woman is hardly a waste of time in my book. Besides, come on, we're in a public place here. Not even Henry could object. Trust me, you are in no danger here.",
        "[Loud noise]",
        "Vienna: Everybody, it's all right. There's no reason to panic. It's just the old furnace backfiring. I'm so sorry.",
        "Noah: Ameera, you can come up now.",
        "Ameera: It sounded like a car bomb.",
        "Noah: No, it's not. You're safe, I promise. We won't let anything happen to you.",
        "Alison: I used to work there. The furnace has done that before.",
        "Matt: Well, that's kind of scary.",
        "Alison: Yeah, the first time, I dropped a whole pot of coffee. It's not pretty.",
        "Matt: I bet. Oh, wait -- where -- where were we? You -- you wanted to tell me something about your past, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I might as well just come out and say this. I -- I used to be really messed up. And I trusted the wrong guy, and I got addicted to crystal meth and got into porn. It was -- yeah.",
        "Matt: Is that it?",
        "Alison: Isn't that enough?",
        "Matt: No, I just mean -- we've all done stuff we're not proud of. I don't judge anybody.",
        "Alison: Well, that's good. So what have you done that you're not so proud of?",
        "Matt: Oh, well, let's see. I used to shoplift comic books and candy when I was a kid.",
        "Alison: Oh, that makes me feel so much better.",
        "Matt: What do you want me to say, that I'm a hardened criminal?",
        "Alison: No, not really. I like you just the way you are.",
        "Luke: Ameera, are you still scared?",
        "Ameera: A little.",
        "Noah: It was no big deal.",
        "Ameera: I know, but --",
        "Luke: Well, you know what, maybe we should just skip the hot chocolate and take her home.",
        "Ameera: Thank you.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry, but you have to fix the furnace when you take over the diner.",
        "Gray: I think I'll pass it on to a poor sucker that I sell it to.",
        "Vienna: Are you selling?",
        "Gray: Since you don't want to back.",
        "Vienna: I was very touched by your offer. I wish I could have said yes.",
        "Gray: Well, I know something that you can say yes to.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Gray: Well, since your furnace spoiled our little coffee break, and you won't have dinner with me, how about giving me just one lunch?",
        "Vienna: You're a very persistent man.",
        "Gray: Is that a yes?",
        "Vienna: On one condition.",
        "Gray: Name it.",
        "Vienna: I have to be upfront with Henry.",
        "Gray: You can tell Henry anything your heart desires.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How could you do that?",
        "Katie: I'm trying to help, Carly. We really think this will work.",
        "Carly: If you think that you are going to worm your way back into Jack's life by using Parker --",
        "Katie: Come on, Carly --",
        "Carly: You are sadly mistaken.",
        "Katie: That is not what this is about. I would never try to do that. Besides, do you have a better plan?",
        "Carly: I think you should leave.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry I came here.",
        "Carly: That makes two of us!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: If you're pinning your hopes on Henry Coleman pulling off a scam, we're even more desperate than I thought.",
        "Brad: Last I looked, we were. And don't be too quick to dismiss Henry. I'm sure he can handle conning Kit.",
        "Jack: I'm not, especially when the stakes are so high for Parker.",
        "Brad: I know, that's why I did it. You know, and don't worry, don't thank me for putting up my own money to make it work.",
        "Jack: I didn't ask you to do that, Brad --",
        "Brad: You didn't have to, man.",
        "Jack: I didn't ask you to do anything --",
        "Brad: We're family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: The customers just love to make an entrance coming down these stairs, and the bar has really some action, you know --",
        "Henry: Yeah, were they filming a \"CSI Oakdale\" here or something?",
        "Kit: No, there was a shooting. My boyfriend was killed.",
        "Henry: Oh, I am sorry. That -- that does cut the resale value though.",
        "Kit: Well, no, no, not necessarily. There was a mob hit in a restaurant in New York and after that, the place got so popular, you -- you just couldn't get a reservation to save your life. Trust me, the Chicago crowd will eat this up.",
        "Henry: Yeah, you may be right. This is the kind of place I'm looking for. What's the asking price?",
        "Kit: 250 grand.",
        "Henry: That is very reasonable, sold.",
        "Kit: Well, actually the 250 grand is just for my share. But don't worry, you can do exactly what you want with the club, I promise.",
        "Henry: Well, I'm afraid that kind of casts this whole transaction in a different light.",
        "Kit: I can sweeten the deal if you close right away.",
        "Henry: Sold again. What do you say we meet tomorrow? We get our lawyers together, we'll transfer the ownership, take care of all the paperwork.",
        "Kit: Well, I was actually hoping we could do this right away. It's just that I already checked out of the Lakeview, and I can still catch a later flight.",
        "Henry: Yeah, it would be hard to get all the legalities taken care of that fast. I mean, if you have to do it today, I'm afraid the deal is off.",
        "Kit: Okay, well, if I stay, then maybe you can give me a down payment? Just to show me that you really mean business.",
        "Henry: Yeah, sure, is cash okay?",
        "Kit: Yeah, sure, cash is real good.",
        "Henry: Well, then, excellent. All right, we'll get together tomorrow and take care of all the paperwork and seal the deal.",
        "Kit: I look forward to it.",
        "Henry: Me, too.",

        "Luke: Here, this should calm your nerves.",
        "Ameera: Sorry I spoiled your day.",
        "Noah: No, you didn't at all.",
        "Ameera: In Iraq, if you go to the cafe or a market, or even on a bus on your way to school, you never know when the next bomb will go off.",
        "Noah: I can't imagine living in a constant state of fear like that.",
        "Ameera: On the eve of my cousin's wedding, her fianc\u00e9 and his friends went to a cafe to celebrate. A suicide bomber blew himself up outside, and my cousin's fianc\u00e9 was killed. Why? For what?",
        "Luke: Well, maybe if you rest for a little bit, you'll feel better. We'll leave you alone. Can you imagine living in fear all the time?",
        "Noah: We can't let her go back there.",
        "Luke: I know.",

        "Alison: Thanks for breakfast, Matt.",
        "Matt: Are you up for that movie?",
        "Alison: I can't. I have a shift at the hospital.",
        "Matt: Oh, let me at least give you a ride back to work?",
        "Alison: Thanks, but I have my car.",
        "Matt: Okay, well, it was fun. It was the most awesome daytime date I've ever had.",
        "Alison: Don't overstate it or anything.",
        "Matt: No, but seriously, I had a great time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey!",
        "Katie: Ugh! I cannot stand that woman. She is so hateful. Do you know Carly actually accused me of wanting to help Parker so I can be with Jack again? Are you kidding me?",
        "Henry: Katie, this is --",
        "Katie: We should have never gotten involved, Henry. We should have never gotten involved. I don't know why I listened to Brad's stupid ideas.",
        "Henry: Listen, Katie, hey, hey, hey! I did it. I got Kit to stay. Man, am I good or what?",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Katie: You did it? Oh, my God. Thank you, thank you. You are amazing. Wait until Jack hears the good news.",
        "Henry: Well, I thought you might want to tell him yourself.",
        "Katie: I think that's a very good idea. Oh, oh, you are so good. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now you, go kiss and make up with Vienna, okay? That's an order.",
        "Henry: Yes, Ma'am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Katie went too far. Coming to me, very sweet and apologetic, expecting me to thank her for coming up with this ridiculous scheme!",
        "Brad: Excuse me, Katie didn't come up with it. I did, and it's not ridiculous. You both should be thanking me.",
        "Jack: I'm with Carly. It's not going to work.",
        "Brad: Oh, boy, the negativity in this room is mind-boggling.",
        "Jack: Henry Coleman, the master of the art of the deal? I'm sure he just made matters worse.",
        "Brad: Katie --",
        "Carly: What is it, Katie?",
        "Jack: What happened?",
        "Brad: Did Henry come through?",
        "Katie: Everybody, stop! It's good news.",

        "Vienna: I did.",
        "Henry: Did you tell Gray you couldn't accept his offer to take the diner back?",
        "Vienna: I did that, too.",
        "Henry: Did he try anything?",
        "Vienna: Persisted a little bit, but I made it perfectly clear that you're the only one for me.",
        "Henry: You're wonderful, you know that? I've made your life so much harder than it was before -- before you met me. You -- you were dipped in diamonds, and you were wined and dined. You had the whole world, and you chose me. I have no idea what I did to deserve you, I don't. You have to know how important you are to me. You have to know that I can't see the world without you in it.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry, I love you. I love you.",
        "Henry: I love you. God, I love you. I love you.",

        "Brad: You're happy, I'm happy.",

        "Katie: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I honestly did not think Henry was going to pull that off. Kit really believes that he is buying the club.",
        "Jack: I feel bad, though. I really came down hard on Brad.",
        "Carly: Yeah, and I gave Katie hell. I thought they were just going to make things worse. I'm glad for once that we were both wrong.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, let's not celebrate just yet. Don't forget, we have to drag a confession out of Kit.",
