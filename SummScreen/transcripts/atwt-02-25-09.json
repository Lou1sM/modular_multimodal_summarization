        "Katie and Brad work through their issues about how she lied to him and risked her life to try to get pregnant, but then Katie learns some bad news from Brad. There was damage done during the Ectopic pregnancy and ensuing surgery; the likelihood of her getting pregnant or carrying to term is almost impossible. Katie is devastated and blames herself for ruining their dreams. Brad tries to comfort her to no avail. When Vienna visits, she makes a startling and generous suggestion \u0096 she would like to be the surrogate for her and Brad so she can still have a baby. Katie isn't sure how to feel, but she is elated by the offer and seems to break out of her funk. Katie and Vienna keep it to themselves until Katie knows how she feels. Katie is able to go home, as her outlook has much improved about how things are in her life. Barbara visits with Eliza (and Meg) and notices the tension between Meg and Dusty when he drops off her belongings. Meg explains he might be hurt that she wants to do this on her own. Barbara races over to tell Paul the news, but she finds him otherwise engaged \u0096 with a \u0091professional'. Paul pretends he doesn't care about the news, but after Barbara leaves, he decides to take Ashley out in public. Meg visits Dusty and asks him out to lunch because she wants to be friends still and thinks it would benefit them both to hang out regularly and do lunch. Dusty finally agrees. Craig stuns Carly when he tells her the Midnight Sun vodka launch party is that night at Metro. Carly is angry at first, but Craig turns on the charm and soon she is on board. Craig almost has to back out him self in the end though when his babysitter can't look after Johnny so he convinces Carly to let Parker step in. Barbara chides Carly for her news that she is going into business with Craig. Barbara tries to warn her by reminding Carly of all Craig has done, but Carly doesn't change her mind. Dusty sees Johnny, as they get to briefly hang out, which is at the same time, Paul strolls in with Ashley on his arm. Meg can't help but stare. Paul doesn't stay with Ashley long, but when he approaches Meg to ask about Eliza, Meg can't help but ask about Ashley. Paul tries to play it off as to why she would care since they are no longer married. After Paul leaves, Meg tells Dusty she will get over Paul and raise her daughter on her own. Paul is thrilled to tell Barbara that Meg was jealous and that is all he needed to see. Carly is nervous about the party, as Craig drops off some vodka to pass off to the investors. Craig calms her nerves and promises that he has her back. The investors arrive at Metro before Craig is back so Carly starts to pour glasses of vodka for them to try. Craig is headed to the launch party when there is a knock and he opens the door; he looks annoyed at who is standing in front of him, as he thinks the person has nerve to show up back there."

        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: You don't have to keep saying that. How are you feeling?",
        "Katie: I lost our baby.",
        "Brad: The doctor says that it happens that way sometimes. The baby grows in there instead of where it's supposed to. I mean, you couldn't have -- you couldn't have stopped it.",
        "Katie: The fertility treatments. That was one of the possible side effects. I knew that.",
        "Brad: You want me to get you some water? Something? You need an extra blanket?",
        "Katie: No, I just want you to hold me.",
        "Brad: I don't know, you just got out of surgery. You've got stitches and stuff. I don't want to break anything.",
        "Katie: Please. Brad, please, don't be mad at me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You've got the magic touch. She fell asleep almost as soon as I handed her to you.",
        "Barbara: Oh, she's just all worn out.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and took me along for the ride.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Meg: For handing you my screaming child?",
        "Barbara: For letting me be a grandmother.",
        "Meg: I don't want anyone who loves Eliza to be cut out of her life. Okay, you think I'm being unfair to Paul.",
        "Barbara: What matters is what you think.",
        "Meg: I can't trust him, Barbara. He kidnapped her.",
        "Barbara: And he brought her back. That has to count for something.",
        "Meg: It does. That's why he's allowed supervised visits.",
        "Barbara: But you won't be there, will you?",
        "Meg: No, I can't. You know, I just can't.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Meg: Hi.",
        "Dusty: Hi. Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Dusty. If you two want to talk --",
        "Dusty: I'm not staying. I brought this over for you.",
        "Meg: What is it?",
        "Dusty: Stuff you left at my place. I thought you might need it.",
        "Meg: Thank you. You know, if you want to come in for some coffee --",
        "Dusty: I've got to go. I'll see you around.",
        "Barbara: I take it that you two aren't together anymore?",
        "Meg: We never were together. We were helping each other out as friends.",
        "Barbara: He certainly didn't seem very friendly just now.",
        "Meg: Well, he doesn't understand that I don't need his help anymore. I'm doing fine on my own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hello. What's your name?",
        "Ashley: Whatever you want it to be.",
        "Paul: You choose.",
        "Ashley: Ashley.",
        "Paul: Hello, Ashley. Why don't you come on over here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: It feels like you don't get that I would be completely messed up if anything happened to you. So how do I make you understand that, so you never, ever do anything like this again?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, I just -- ever since I was a little girl, I wanted to be a mom. And I knew the formula. I knew it -- fall in love, get married, have a baby. And I was doing the first two things over and over again. I got those right. I just couldn't seem to get the baby part right.",
        "Brad: You knew that getting pregnant was dangerous. You didn't tell me you were still trying.",
        "Katie: I know. I'm sorry. It's just that I wanted our baby so bad. And I was putting so much pressure on myself. I felt like I just had this little window of opportunity to get pregnant. And I had no idea that it could go so wrong. I didn't want to miss my chance.",
        "Brad: We're going to have hundreds of chances. Thousands.",
        "Katie: How do you know that?",
        "Brad: Your formula. You know why it didn't work? Because you left something out.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: Well, you fall in love. You get married. Stay in love.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah.",
        "Brad: That's what we're going to do. Stay together. Stay in love. And while we're at it, we're gonna make a family.",
        "Katie: I want that so bad. I just want a family with you.",
        "Brad: You've got to promise me.",
        "Katie: I know, I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: Right?",
        "Katie: I will promise --",
        "Brad: Okay?",
        "Katie: I promise, no more pushing. No more pushing. I will be patient and wait until I get the official go-ahead that there are no risks to me or to our baby.",
        "Brad: Okay, is that a solemn vow?",
        "Katie: It is.",
        "Brad: Great. Good. Okay, then now, I pronounce us future mommy and daddy.",
        "Doctor: Well, I'm glad to see you're looking better.",
        "Katie: Yes, I'm feeling so much stronger. I hope I can go home soon.",
        "Doctor: I don't see why not.",
        "Katie: I was just promising my husband here that I am not going to try to get pregnant again until you tell me that I'm ready. Any idea when that might be?",
        "Doctor: Well, we're just waiting for some test results. And then we'll talk.",
        "Katie: Okay. I'll be patient this time. Solemn vow.",
        "Brad: Do you know when can Katie go home?",
        "Doctor: I'll check the chart and I'll let you know.",
        "Katie: Go after him. Don't let him out of your sight. I gotta get sprung from here.",
        "Brad: I'm on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "Craig: Can I just say that you are beautiful no matter what you wear?",
        "Carly: Craig, honestly, I don't have time for you today. And if you ever called before coming over here, you would know that.",
        "Craig: Well, I just had to be here to see it in person.",
        "Carly: See what?",
        "Craig: It is time for Cinderella to get out of her rags and get ready for the ball. Now, let's go see if you have something amazing in your closet.",
        "Carly: But no, let's not. Where exactly am I supposed to be going?",
        "Craig: The Midnight Sun vodka launch party.",
        "Carly: Why are you bothering me about that now? We won't be ready to launch anything for weeks.",
        "Craig: Well, ready or not, we are launching tonight.",
        "Carly: Tonight?",
        "Craig: Don't worry, we have plenty of time. At least three hours before we have to be at Metro to set up.",
        "Carly: Three hours? Craig, what is the matter with you? How could you do this to me?",
        "Craig: Not quite the reaction I was hoping for, but I'm sure you're smiling on the inside. Now, what will you be wearing?",
        "Carly: Nothing. 'Cause I ain't going. See yourself out, just close the door. Plug that back in!",
        "Craig: You have noticed that we're starting up a real business here, haven't you?",
        "Carly: Yes, Craig, I've noticed.",
        "Craig: Good. Have you also noticed that I've invested no small amount of cash and energy? And all I've asked of you is to appear at a couple of meetings and make some scribbles on a page.",
        "Carly: I beg your pardon? My designs are not scribbles on a page.",
        "Craig: The launch party is happening tonight. If you choose to show up wearing nothing but a smile, that can be arranged. But you will be there.",
        "Carly: We are partners, Craig. You are not my boss.",
        "Craig: I'll tell you who I am. I'm the guy who's going to stop you from sabotaging this enterprise before it even begins.",
        "Carly: You set up this whole launch party without even checking with me. And you expect me to jump when you snap your fingers? My life is not like that.",
        "Craig: Look, these buyers were already in Chicago at a trade show. That means we have tonight, and only tonight, to get them here on our turf, and make millions of dollars in sales. And you want me to pass that up because you prefer to clean, cook and sew?",
        "Carly: Craig, we haven't even made a final vodka selection. We don't even have a product!",
        "Craig: So we sell them on the concept. We make them want to be in business with us. And that's your forte.",
        "Carly: Okay. Look, I will throw the party. You do the selling.",
        "Craig: Oh, we can both do this pitch.",
        "Carly: I can sell things. But I have to sell real things. Things that people can see and taste and touch, which we don't have, because you rushed into this!",
        "Craig: No worries. You provide the beauty, I'll provide the bull. It's a match made in heaven.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh! Oh, my God!",
        "Paul: What are you doing here?",
        "Ashley: That's your mother?",
        "Barbara: The housekeeper said you weren't alone, but I had no idea. Really, Paul, in the living room?",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Mother. It's my living room. We had the reasonable expectation of privacy before you walked in.",
        "Barbara: Who are you?",
        "Ashley: Ashley. And you look way too good to be his mother.",
        "Paul: Don't flirt with my mother, Ashley. There's no money in it.",
        "Barbara: Money? Oh God, Paul!",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Mom. If you're so affronted, you can leave.",
        "Barbara: Don't you have any clothes?",
        "Paul: Good-bye, Mother.",
        "Barbara: I just came from the farm and seeing Eliza.",
        "Paul: Is she all right?",
        "Barbara: She's fine, she's precious. But what's really interesting is what's going on with Meg. She and Dusty are definitely not together.",
        "[Paul sighs]",
        "Paul: Why would I care about that?",
        "Barbara: Because then you can get her back, and you can be a family.",
        "Paul: I don't want her back.",
        "Barbara: You don't mean that.",
        "Ashley: I really wish I knew who you guys were talking about. It sounds way interesting.",
        "Barbara: Where did you find her?",
        "Paul: You don't want to know.",
        "Barbara: You don't know who she's been with. You don't know anything about her. You don't know what she's been doing.",
        "Paul: I know what she's been doing today. She's terrific, yeah. But you really should leave.",
        "Ashley: What's next, Lover?",
        "Paul: Get dressed.",
        "Ashley: But you hired me for the whole day.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, the day will continue -- over lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hey. Did I forget something?",
        "Meg: Sort of. Look, you have no life, I have no life. You know what else we don't have?",
        "Dusty: A clue about what we're doing?",
        "Meg: We don't have enough friends.",
        "Dusty: You think I need friends?",
        "Meg: I think you and I should be friends.",
        "Dusty: You don't want me in your life. You made that clear.",
        "Meg: I don't want you running my life. There's a difference. And then, when I was pushing you away, I kind of left some things out.",
        "Dusty: Like?",
        "Meg: Like, I need to be independent. But I still want to hang out with you. I want us to be real friends who help each other instead of this lopsided setup we have, with you doing all the giving and me doing all the taking.",
        "Dusty: Sounds good.",
        "Meg: Good. Let's do lunch.",
        "Dusty: Lunch, now?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Don't you have to get back to the farm?",
        "Meg: Nope. Mama is babysitting. I have all afternoon. And we are going to go out to lunch. Hey, who knows. You might even like it. It might be a regular thing.",
        "Dusty: What are we going to talk about at these regular lunches?",
        "Meg: Not Paul, not Craig and not Johnny.",
        "Dusty: I think I'd rather go to a movie.",
        "Meg: We can't talk in a movie.",
        "Dusty: Exactly.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: A couple of these guys have clubs that are extremely high-end. A couple of them even have franchises in L.A., Miami, London.",
        "Carly: Are you trying to make me even more nervous about this?",
        "Craig: No, I am trying to stress the importance that you look like we don't need the money. In fact, it would be crackerjack if you look like you have a few million more of your own. Do you have anything like that in your closet?",
        "Carly: I would, if you'd given me a chance to design something. I can't wear what I don't have.",
        "Craig: Let me preface this by saying that you are our brand.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Craig: And it's imperative that Midnight Sun vodka be seen as an elegant, refined liquor.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Craig: And it is worth the price if you look the part. Consider it the cost of doing business.",
        "Carly: No, Craig. I am not letting you buy me clothing.",
        "Craig: Carly --",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Craig: Maggie? Is Johnny all right? Please don't tell me this. Are you sure? Okay. All right, I understand. I'll be right there.",
        "Carly: What is it? What's wrong?",
        "Craig: That was my babysitter. Her daughter's sick. She has to leave early.",
        "Carly: Oh. Oh! Well, who's going to watch Johnny?",
        "Craig: Me, I guess.",
        "Carly: Well, who's going to do the launch thingy? No, I'm not!",
        "Craig: Oh, you can handle it.",
        "Carly: No, I can't, and I won't. If you need to be with Johnny, then this whole thing is over. Cancel it.",
        "Craig: Parker! Parker! Parker, have I told you that you are one of the most intelligent and responsible young men I have ever met?",
        "Parker: Are you being sarcastic or something?",
        "Craig: No. Why would you say that?",
        "Parker: Because you just gave me a lecture about responsibility the other day.",
        "Carly: Oh, would that be the day that you got really drunk on the vodka that Craig left in this fridge?",
        "Parker: Yes.",
        "Craig: But the important thing is, he listened when we spoke. And even more importantly, you learned from your mistake, didn't you?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Craig: There, you see? Not only responsible, but conscientious. Problem solved. Babysitter found.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. This is not happening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What's the bad news?",
        "Brad: What do you mean?",
        "Katie: I saw you talking to the doctor, and you looked really serious. Did he change his mind about letting me go home today?",
        "Brad: No, no, no. He knows you want to get out of here. He's filling out the paperwork right now.",
        "Katie: What else did he say?",
        "Brad: We'll talk about that another time, okay? You know, Vienna went to the house last night and she got some of your clothes. You want me to help you get dressed?",
        "Katie: What is it, Brad? What did the doctor say?",
        "Brad: They updated your chart, whatever tests they did -- she said the tube that the baby was growing in -- well, it burst.",
        "Katie: Yeah, that's why I had to have surgery.",
        "Brad: And when they were operating, they couldn't repair the tube, so they had to remove it and take it out.",
        "Katie: That's okay. I still have another one.",
        "Brad: And the doctor warned us that there's a lot of scar tissue there.",
        "Katie: What does that mean?",
        "Brad: That, probably, there's almost no chance of you being able to get pregnant now.",
        "Katie: Even with fertility treatments?",
        "Brad: Even then. That even if you do get pregnant, he thinks it's very unlikely that you'd be able to carry the baby the whole nine months.",
        "Katie: No babies? Not ever? What have I done?",
        "Brad: You didn't know this was going to happen.",
        "Katie: I should have listened to you. I should have listened to the doctors. This is my fault.",
        "Brad: No, we're going to figure out something.",
        "Katie: No, how? What are we going to figure out, Brad? It's done. It's over. No more chances. I'm never going to have your baby.",
        "[Katie sobbing]",
        "Brad: Okay, so you're not going to do the bowling ball-belly, swollen ankles thing. So what? I don't care about that. There are a lot of different ways to be a parent.",
        "Katie: But I wanted to have your baby. Yours and mine.",
        "Brad: Look, they don't have to look like us. I mean, that's not what's important. All right, okay -- right now, the only thing that we should care about is getting you well.",
        "Katie: No, I think about all those times when you wondered what our babies would look like, and now I've -- you're never going to have that because of me. I'm sorry!",
        "Brad: Listen to me! Listen -- listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me -- listen. You're still here. You're loving me. That's everything to me. That's everything to me. Katie --",
        "Katie: I'm tired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Mom, why can't I babysit Johnny? I've done it before.",
        "Carly: That was before your little vodka party.",
        "Craig: The boy realizes he made an error in judgment. Besides, he'd never do anything wrong around my son. Because he knows I'd kill him. Don't you?",
        "Parker: Yeah, you're pretty intense when it comes to Johnny.",
        "Carly: Well just in case, have you put away any liquor you may have laying around?",
        "Craig: Well, I'm pretty sure it's out of Johnny's reach. I really don't think we need to worry about Parker.",
        "Parker: Johnny's my nephew, Mom. He's 5 years old. I wouldn't do anything stupid while I was supposed to be taking care of him. You know that.",
        "Craig: You have raised a remarkable young man, Carly.",
        "Parker: Please, Mom. Trust me.",
        "Carly: Of course, I do.",
        "Parker: Thank you!",
        "Carly: You're welcome. But do realize that I'm only saying \"Yes\" because I need Craig's help tonight.",
        "Parker: Okay, well, I'll drop off my books and I'll be right back.",
        "Carly: No you won't. Why are you dropping off your books? You have to take them with you. You know, you still have to do homework! Parker --",
        "Craig: Here.",
        "Carly: What is that for?",
        "Craig: It's for your dress.",
        "Carly: No, I already told you, I'm not letting you buy me a dress --",
        "Craig: I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the business. Besides, it is my fault I didn't give you enough time to create something spectacular.",
        "Carly: Well, you're right about that. Okay, I'll take it. Now, get out of here. I've got stuff to do.",
        "Craig: Parker, shake a leg!",
        "Carly: Okay, just -- keep in mind a few things, okay? No guests. No headphones. And keep the volume on the stereo and the TV low so you can hear Johnny. And do every bit of that homework.",
        "Parker: Got it.",
        "Carly: And have fun!",
        "Craig: Any instructions for me, Mom?",
        "Carly: Don't be late.",
        "Craig: Oh, I'll be early. I can't wait to see what you'll be wearing.",
        "Carly: I can't wait to see what I'll be wearing either. Go on, go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I heard.",
        "Katie: Please don't tell me everything's going to be okay.",
        "Vienna: And what would you like me to tell you?",
        "Katie: How's Brad?",
        "Vienna: Worried about you.",
        "Katie: This is all my fault. And it would be one thing if it was just me. But now Brad's not going to have kids, either. Unless he leaves me for somebody else.",
        "Vienna: Somebody else? Don't be absurd. Brad loves you from now until eternity.",
        "Katie: All I wanted was to have a baby. And now there's no way I can.",
        "Vienna: But I can.",
        "Katie: Are you trying to make me feel worse?",
        "Vienna: No -- somebody else! Katie, I can be your somebody else. You and Brad -- I can have your baby!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I love it. I'll take it.",
        "Salesgirl: You have a great eye.",
        "Barbara: Well, Ms. Tenney is a fashion designer, Deidre. Though I'm quite surprised she's buying off the rack.",
        "Carly: Well, you know how it is. I saw it in the window and just had to have it.",
        "Barbara: Oh! What's the occasion?",
        "Carly: A private function tonight at Metro.",

        "Vienna: Surrogate. That's when you and Brad make a baby and the doctors put it inside me?",
        "Katie: That's the general idea. The surrogate carries the baby to term, and then gives it back to the parents.",
        "Vienna: Wonderful! Let's do it.",
        "Katie: Wait, hold on. Whoa, Vienna. It's not that easy. You don't have children of your own. I think, usually a surrogate has to have had some successful pregnancies.",

        "Vienna: If I had told Brad that you were still trying to get pregnant, he could have stopped you. And this wouldn't have happened.",
        "Katie: Don't blame yourself. I did this. So if you're feeling guilty, and that's why you're offering to be a surrogate, don't worry about that, okay? I know you want to help me --",

        "Katie: How?",
        "Vienna: Let me be pregnant for you.",
        "Katie: How does that help you?",
        "Vienna: Because I love Henry with all my heart. And I want to have his baby, but he doesn't want to have children.",
        "Katie: I still don't understand how that helps you.",
        "Vienna: Because this way, I'd get to experience being pregnant, then giving birth. I would have a Godchild I could spoil to pieces. And I would still have Henry.",
        "Katie: Oh, Vienna. I don't know think this is as simple as you're making it out to be.",

        "Brad: You don't speak Swedish.",

        "Katie: Yes. I want to be in our cozy little nest and far, far away from this gross hospital bed.",

        "Katie: Thanks for not telling him.",
        "Vienna: No, that is your job. But if you want to do this, you'll have to let him know. It's not as though you can make a baby without Brad.",
        "Katie: No. I'm going to wait to tell him until I decide what I think about this myself.",
        "Vienna: You know, you can always us someone else if you don't want to use me. It's still a good idea.",
        "Katie: You know something? When you and Henry first got together, I thought it would never last.",
        "Vienna: And now? What do you think now?",
