        "Alison: Casey! Casey, no! Casey, you don't want to do this. Please.",
        "Casey: You don't know how bad I want to do this.",
        "Alison: You'll end up back in jail.",
        "Casey: I'm just finishing something he already started.",
        "Alison: The police aren't gonna see it that way, neither will your mother.",
        "Casey: They don't have to know. We'll make it look like he did it himself.",
        "Alison: We'll know.",
        "Casey: Yes, and I can live with that.",
        "Alison: Well, I can't, and you don't want to either!",
        "Mick: I think he does. I think he wants to more than anything else.",
        "Alison: Mick, stop it.",
        "Mick: Come on! Just do it!",
        "Alison: Casey, pull him back, please.",
        "Casey: Why? Who are you worried about, me or him?",
        "Alison: Both of you!",
        "Casey: Do you love him?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Casey: It's a simple question. Just answer it. Is this psychopath the guy you want to be with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: How can the United States government support the deportation of an American citizen?",
        "Tom: They're not deporting him. They're extraditing him. It happens all the time.",
        "Molly: How do they have the right to put him on trial? Whatever he did, he did here in the states.",
        "Tom: That's our best argument against extradition. I just don't see how a federal judge would rule that Malta has any jurisdiction in your case.",
        "Molly: So, that means we win?",
        "Tom: We should.",
        "Holden: But?",
        "Tom: Well, the Maltese government is pushing very hard to extradite Holden immediately.",
        "Molly: Okay. You tell me the judge that's hearing the case and I'll find out everything this guy even ever thought about doing wrong.",
        "Tom: Well, I would really like to try some legal reasoning before we jump to extortion and obstruction of justice.",
        "Molly: You do your thing, I'll do mine.",
        "Holden: You know what, Molly? Tom's right. You're a mile past overkill already.",
        "Molly: I told you, I can't just sit here and do nothing while they ship you off to a show trial.",
        "Holden: All right. You want to do something?",
        "Molly: Yeah.",
        "Holden: Then do something for me.",
        "Molly: Anything. What?",
        "Holden: I need you to bring Lily here.",
        "Molly: Anything else?",
        "Holden: Molly, it's important.",
        "Molly: Of course it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dr. Oliver said that there is no way the body in this autopsy report could be Damian's.",
        "Lily: I thought you didn't trust Dr. Oliver.",
        "Luke: As a person, no. But as a doctor, even Bob Hughes admits he's brilliant.",
        "Lily: And he's sure about this?",
        "Luke: 100%. He says that whoever this body is had an advanced case of Huntington's disease. They wouldn't have been able to walk or talk when they died, and we both know that Damian could.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Okay. So, Gillian, is it? All right, here's the deal. I know that Dr. Hughes said he was gonna refer you to one Dr. Channing, but, frankly, you'd be better off seeing a pediatrician than letting that clown anywhere near your brain. So, I told him I'd do it myself, but you can thank me later.",
        "Gillian: Have you done this kind of surgery before?",
        "Reid: No. I've been waiting for a case that was so hopeless it paid to give it a shot.",
        "Gillian: And that's me?",
        "Reid: How cool is that?",
        "Gillian: What if it doesn't work?",
        "Reid: Then I'm gonna look really bad.",
        "Gillian: What about me?",
        "Reid: Yeah. You'll probably look a lot worse.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Reid: Go away! I'm with a patient!",
        "Luke: I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "Reid: Turn around, shut the door, and get lost.",
        "Luke: It's just gonna take one --",
        "Reid: I said I'm with a patient, Mr. Snyder. Sorry about that. So, any questions?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Casey, please, don't do this.",
        "Casey: Just answer the question.",
        "Mick: It doesn't matter how you answer. Either way, he's gonna let go.",
        "Casey: You're really pushing it, you know that? I would shut up if I was you!",
        "Alison: I don't know what you want me to say!",
        "Casey: Just tell me the truth!",
        "Alison: Oh, God, Casey! Stop, stop!",
        "Casey: Then answer the question! Do you love him? I just want to know if you love him!",
        "Alison: I don't want to say the wrong thing and make you let him go!",
        "Casey: There's no right or wrong, just the truth. Do you love him?",
        "Alison: No! No, I don't love him!",
        "Casey: Then why did you sleep with him?",
        "Alison: I don't know why I did it, okay? We just -- we -- we felt this connection! We both felt it, and I just didn't know what it was!",
        "Casey: But it wasn't love?",
        "Alison: No, it couldn't have been.",
        "Casey: Why not?",
        "Alison: Because I'm in love with you, Casey! That's why! There, you both wanted the truth! That's it!",
        "Casey: I don't know what to say.",
        "Mick: You're pathetic. She just told you she loved you. You don't know what to say.",
        "Casey: You're still one push away from the pavement!",
        "Alison: Mick, what the hell are you doing?",
        "Mick: Same thing I was doing when I jumped in front of that truck.",
        "Alison: You don't want to die.",
        "Mick: Beats spending the next 20 years in a cell.",
        "Casey: You're right. Prison's a lot worse.",
        "Mick: What are you doing?",
        "Casey: I want to make sure you suffer every miserable day for the rest of your life.",
        "Mick: You son of a --",
        "Casey: Aah! Aah!",
        "Alison: Let me see it, let me see it. You're bleeding.",
        "Alison: Mick, why the hell'd you do that? Mick, where are you going? Casey, okay, come we got to get you downstairs and take care of this. Can you walk?",
        "Casey: Yes, I can walk! We got to go after --",
        "Alison: No! How far can he get? Come on. Let's take care of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I'm gonna talk to Steven Franklin, the U.S. attorney. He'll be arguing for the government at the extradition hearing.",
        "Holden: Is that good?",
        "Tom: Normally he can make the decision to drop this thing on his own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Holden needs to see you.",
        "Lily: What's wrong?",
        "Molly: The Maltese government's trying to have him extradited today.",
        "Lily: What? How can they do that?",
        "Molly: I don't think they can, neither does Tom, but Holden's afraid of the influence that Damian's family's had in Malta, so he wants to talk to you about it.",
        "Lily: Oh, this is so horrible. How is Holden? Is he all right?",
        "Molly: No. He's not. He really wants to see you right away.",
        "Lily: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: There's gonna be a hearing on the extradition unless you tell the U.S. attorney what you told me about the body.",
        "Reid: I'm not a forensic pathologist.",
        "Luke: No, but you are the most brilliant neurosurgeon on planet earth.",
        "Reid: You're asking me for a favor. You might want to cut back on the snarkiness.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm sorry, but you told me that you're sure this body was not my father's.",
        "Reid: Not if he could walk, talk, and say goodbye.",
        "Luke: Well, I need you to tell the U.S. attorney that.",
        "Reid: Doesn't he have his own doctors?",
        "Luke: Well, I guess so, but, apparently, they didn't see what you saw.",
        "Reid: Big surprise.",
        "Luke: So, that's why you have to tell them.",
        "Reid: Fine. Have them fax over a form. I'll fill it out when I get s chance.",
        "Luke: No, we can't wait that long.",
        "Reid: I'm sorry. Forgive me. One minute the authorities think that your father's a corpse, the next minute they think he's a killer?",
        "Luke: Well, obviously, I have two different fathers.",
        "Reid: Well, with your mother's good looks, that's not a big surprise. Where is that hottie, anyway?",
        "Luke: Uh, I don't know. I think she's talking to Molly. Can we just go?",
        "Reid: Where?",
        "Luke: The U.S. attorney is at the police station.",
        "Reid: Now? I can't just leave the hospital.",
        "Luke: But you have to tell him what you told me.",
        "Reid: I thought I made this clear. You don't tell me what to do.",
        "Luke: But this is really important.",
        "Reid: So are my patients. Besides, you don't need a doctor. You need a lawyer.",
        "Luke: I can't believe that you think that I'm arrogant.",
        "Reid: I can't hear you.",
        "Luke: Because there isn't a doctor in this entire hospital who could cover you for an hour, and if I lose both of my fathers because of you, well, I guess that's my problem, because God forbid you think about anyone besides yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I know the pressure is on from Malta to extradite Mr. Snyder, but let's face the facts. There's no case for jurisdiction here. We'll just be wasting the court's time.",
        "Holden: Hey, you came.",
        "Lily: Molly told me. What's happening?",
        "Holden: Could we have a few minutes alone?",
        "Tom: Sure. I'll take Mr. Franklin outside and go over all the ways he's violating the constitution of the United States.",
        "Molly: Do you, uh -- do you need anything?",
        "Holden: No. No, we're fine.",
        "Molly: Okay. I guess I'll make sure Tom doesn't forget any clauses.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Holden: Thank you for coming. Listen, I know that you have a lot of mixed feelings about me right now.",
        "Lily: Holden, I want to help you. I don't want to see you get shipped off to Malta.",
        "Holden: Well, I think that that's what's gonna happen.",
        "Lily: Luke doesn't think --",
        "Holden: I know how Luke feels about me right now. He thinks I'm responsible for everything that happened to his father.",
        "Lily: No, he doesn't don't you forget that you are his father.",
        "Holden: Lily, if I hadn't gotten into a fight with Damian, he wouldn't have fallen off that ship. He wouldn't have drowned.",
        "Lily: He didn't drown.",
        "Holden: They found his body.",
        "Lily: That's what I'm trying to tell you, Holden. The body in the photograph, it wasn't Damian.",
        "Holden: What are you talking about?",
        "Lily: Luke took the autopsy report to Dr. Oliver. He said it can't be Damian.",
        "Holden: How does he know that?",
        "Lily: The corpse in the photo has advanced Huntington's disease.",
        "Holden: Has Dr. Oliver told anybody about this?",
        "Lily: No. He's with Luke right now.",
        "Luke: No, he's not.",
        "Lily: Where's Dr. Oliver?",
        "Luke: He's not with me.",
        "Holden: He needs to come down here. He needs to tell the U.S. attorney about this.",
        "Luke: I know. I already told him that.",
        "Lily: He said no?",
        "Luke: He said he was too . Busy.",
        "Lily: That's insane.",
        "Luke: No, that's Dr. Oliver.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Results of diffusion tensor imaging are consistent with previous EEG and MRI results, confirming that the seizure activity is focused on the hippocampus. The patient is therefore an excellent candidate for the surgery. Hear that, Channing, you deli slicer? I'm gonna get this lady back on her feet, go back to Dallas. One more prize to throw in your face. So, why am I thinking about some irrelevant Maltese corpse?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Stay right there while I get what I need.",
        "Casey: Shouldn't we alert security and tell them Dante's loose?",
        "Alison: Well, it's a hospital-wide message. Your grandfather already called the police.",
        "Casey: We shouldn't have let him go.",
        "Alison: You mean I shouldn't have.",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Alison: Casey, I was just -- was worried about your hand.",
        "Casey: It's nothing.",
        "Alison: Let me take a look at it. Okay. That is not nothing. When is the last time you had a tetanus shot?",
        "Casey: When I had a skateboarding accident like in fifth grade.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, you're probably gonna need another one, and you're also gonna need a couple stitches till this heals properly.",
        "Casey: And you know how to do that?",
        "Alison: No, but I've been wanting a chance to try. Kidding. What?",
        "Casey: What you said on the roof, was that just to keep me from pushing Mick off the edge?",
        "Alison: You told me to tell the truth.",
        "Casey: And did you?",
        "Alison: Yes, I did.",
        "Casey: Ow, that hurts!",
        "Alison: It's supposed to! Serves you right.",
        "Casey: What did I do?",
        "Alison: You scared me to death up there, putting me on the spot like that!",
        "Casey: I wanted to know.",
        "Alison: I guess I can't blame you. I mean, I haven't been very fair to you, and -- and I understand if you never want to see me again.",
        "Casey: No. I'm not saying that. You know, it's just a weird situation. This dude thinks he's James Stenbeck. He did the Frankenstein thing with your sister. I don't blame you for being confused.",
        "Alison: How about for wrecking our wedding?",
        "Casey: See, I don't know. I was just thinking, maybe this was a good thing that happened. Maybe deep down inside we weren't ready for it.",
        "Alison: Well, that's just it. I thought I was.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I thought so, too, 'cause I wanted to be, you know, especially after you said yes.",
        "Alison: I really wanted to be Mrs. Casey Hughes, you know, and be a part of your family and all that and just have everything settled.",
        "Casey: I guess wanting to be ready isn't really the same thing as being ready.",
        "Alison: I guess not.",
        "Casey: I pushed this whole thing onto you.",
        "Alison: No. We made the decisions together.",
        "Casey: No. I sprung this whole proposal thing on you without even asking you first.",
        "Alison: Casey, I said yes.",
        "Casey: Yes, and that was my favorite part about the whole thing.",
        "Alison: Mine, too. I should probably go get you a doctor to take care of those stitches.",
        "Casey: I -- I don't mind if you want to do it.",
        "Alison: No. You need to have it done right or else you might have a permanent scar.",
        "Casey: It might be really cool.",
        "Alison: Well, how much cooler could a guy possibly be?",
        "Casey: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Alison: Okay. Keep this pressed right here until I go find you a doctor, all right?",
        "Casey: All right.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Casey: Hey, Ali, just so you know, I'm still in love with you, too.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[Mick grunting]",
        "Mick: What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: Looking for you.",
        "Mick: Are you gonna turn me in?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Mick: Then what are you doing here?",
        "Alison: I just knew that I had to find you before the police did.",

        "Reid: How's your therapy coming along?",
        "Noah: It's good. It's really good. I'm anxious for the surgery.",
        "Reid: I'm anxious to cut.",
        "Noah: When do you think we'll be able to do that?",
        "Reid: We'll be able to do that as soon as I'm not surrounded by inconsequential distractions",
        "Noah: But we're gonna do that here, right, in Memorial?",
        "Reid: Unless the judge releases me so I can return to Dallas, we don't have much of a choice. Keep your fingers crossed.",
        "Noah: When will you know?",
        "Reid: Not soon enough.",
        "Noah: Is that it?",
        "Reid: Is what it?",
        "Noah: Why you're distracted? The hearing?",
        "Reid: No. Once again, it's your boyfriend.",
        "Noah: Luke?",
        "Reid: How many boyfriends does one blind guy have?",
        "Noah: If you had a run-in with him --",
        "Reid: He barged in on me earlier when I was with a patient.",
        "Noah: Okay. Maybe you could just cut him some slack just this once?",
        "Reid: And I would do that because?",
        "Noah: I don't know if you noticed this when you saw him, but he was probably a little upset.",
        "Reid: With his disposition, it's difficult to tell.",
        "Noah: His birth father just died.",
        "Reid: Well, that's open to interpretation.",
        "Noah: What are you talking about?",
        "Reid: He came by here yesterday with some autopsy photos. I offered to take a look at them for him.",
        "Noah: What happened?",
        "Reid: I told him, in my professional opinion, that whoever the guy in the photo was, there's no way in hell it was his father.",
        "Noah: Are you serious?",
        "Reid: Was Damian Grimaldi mentally and physically incapacitated before he died?",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Reid: Then, yeah, I'm serious.",
        "Noah: Oh, my God.",
        "Reid: I thought he'd thank me and that would be the end of it, but apparently they think his other dad killed his real dad or some such thing.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but if what you're saying is true, then Holden's innocent!",
        "Reid: Yeah. That's what has him all in a twist. He came by here demanding that I drop everything and go make a statement.",
        "Noah: And you said no?",
        "Reid: I told him to fax me some forms, I'd fill them out. As ridiculous and pathetic as this hospital is, I do actually have a job to do here.",
        "Noah: Wait. Dr. Oliver -- Dr. Oliver, you can't just blow this off. I mean, Luke's dad is sitting in jail for something that he didn't even do!",
        "Reid: Not really my problem.",
        "Noah: You're a doctor. Come on. You help people.",
        "Reid: Sick people, not wrongly accused people. What the guy needs is a better lawyer, not a neurosurgeon.",
        "Noah: That is a cop out.",
        "Reid: Excuse me?",
        "Noah: You heard me. If you don't want to be distracted, that's fine. Make a statement and move on. You've asked us both to do things that we didn't want to do and we still did them. So, now maybe it's your turn.",
        "Reid: Yeah, but that's not really how it works.",
        "Noah: If you're only refusing to get involved now because it's Luke --",
        "Reid: We're done here.",
        "Noah: Dr. Oliver --",
        "Reid: I said we're done here, Mr. Mayer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dr. Oliver said that that body had advanced stages of Huntington's disease. That means that the guy couldn't talk or walk.",
        "Holden: Then it couldn't have been Damian.",
        "Luke: Exactly.",
        "Holden: So, why won't he come down here and tell them?",
        "Luke: Because he's a selfish, self-absorbed little jerk.",
        "Lily: Then we will find somebody else who's willing to testify.",
        "Holden: I'll tell Tom. Thank you for believing.",
        "Luke: I always did, Dad. I know you're not a murderer. I'm just sorry that couldn't get Dr. Oliver down here.",
        "Holden: It's okay. Don't worry about it.",
        "Tom: I'm sorry, Holden. Franklin seems to have his orders, and he's going to follow them.",
        "Lily: What does that mean?",

        "Franklin: I'll need to call Washington first.",
        "Lily: There's no way he can send Holden to Malta now.",

        "Lily: Tom, they'll have to accept Dr. Oliver's opinion, won't they?",
        "Tom: They'll have their doctors come in and double-check. I'll have my father weigh in on our side. But it sure sounds like he's right.",

        "Molly: WOAK has learned that the United States government is planning to send an American citizen to stand trial in a foreign country for a murder that may not have happened at all. The United States attorney Steven Franklin is seeking to extradite prominent Oakdale citizen Holden Snyder to the island nation of Malta to stand trial for the alleged murder of Maltese industrialist Damian Grimaldi. The Maltese government claims they recovered Grimaldi's body in territorial waters, but Dr. Reid Oliver, a world-renown neurosurgeon has examined the autopsy report and concluded the body could not possibly be Grimaldi's. In spite of this evidence, U.S. attorney Franklin has filed a motion in federal court to extradite Mr. Snyder to Malta today. Legal experts have told WOAK that this rush to judgment is a clear violation of Mr. Snyder's right to due process. They suspect the U.S. government is acting in deference to the Grimaldi family, which is known to have strong connections to government officials as well as to organized crime.",
        "Reid: Looks like she nailed you, big boy.",
