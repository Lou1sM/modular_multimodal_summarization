        "Lily: Would you like some tea?",
        "Lucinda: Lily, this isn't a tea party.",
        "Lily: Yes, you did sound a little bit irritated on the phone. You can't blame a girl for trying.",
        "Lucinda: Dear, you gave those baby food women more money, against my express -- express directions.",
        "Lily: Phyllis and Miranda. Valley's Best baby food needed --",
        "Lucinda: And Valley's Best -- I mean, it's just awful, Darling. What kind of a name is that? I mean, it has no imagination and has no connection whatsoever to organic baby food --",
        "Lily: Oh, fine. You don't like the name? They can go back to the drawing board.",
        "Lucinda: I do not have a problem with the name, Darling. I have a problem with their inexperience. So, I'm very sorry, but Felicia and Marian, they'll have to find themselves another sugar mommy.",
        "Lily: Phyllis and Miranda. And I cannot just cut them off.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, but I can. And I will. As of this day, I'm withdrawing Worldwide funds from this. I'm sorry, Darling, I'm doing this for your own good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: All these weeks, I just kept telling myself, yeah, Mike's angry, but he's coming back. And I'll be this new put together successful person, he won't be able to resist me. But he's not coming back. He's gone. And it's so hard to finally realize that, you know, I just feel so alone.",
        "Jack: I know, it's a shock when it hits you at first, right?",
        "Katie: Oh, Carly -- you're going through the same exact thing right now --",
        "Jack: No, it's good to talk to somebody who understands.",
        "Katie: I just didn't want to admit it, I guess. And I get so angry at people who try to be compassionate or understanding.",
        "Jack: Yeah, if you're talking about my brother --",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no, he deserves everything I throw at him, and then some.",
        "Jack: I felt that way when he needled me about Carly for awhile.",
        "Katie: Did you ever hit him?",
        "Jack: I've wanted to.",
        "Brad: Hey, you know what? You better be careful, Katie. I don't want your husband to come back and catch you in the arms of another man.",
        "Vienna: There he is -- my hero! You know, I tried to call you, but the switchboard told me that you were too busy making Katie's little show very successful.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah, I had to tape another segment. You got to see this one. This is great. You know that wild, vicious dog I had to stun? Brought it in here. I had it eating out of my hand.",
        "Katie: Lucky he didn't lose his hand.",
        "Vienna: You are so brave. And so photogenic too.",
        "Brad: Well, what can I say? I lucked out on the genetic lottery. Unlike my brother.",
        "Jack: Family, you gotta love him.",
        "Vienna: We should celebrate.",
        "Brad: Well, how can I say no to champagne, or a beautiful woman?",
        "Jack: Okay, you are done taping here?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Jack: All right, let's go someplace. A change of scenery.",
        "Katie: Where are we going?",
        "Jack: That will be a surprise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, it's only a matter of time. Once they find the body, they'll have enough evidence to prove that it was us.",
        "Maddie: Okay, just because Margo said they found a body, doesn't mean that it was Adam.",
        "Gwen: How many bodies do you think are lying around in the middle of the woods?",
        "Maddie: Do you remember my sister? For all we know, she could've stashed half a dozen bodies in those woods. Or it could be some homeless guy who froze to death. The fact is we just don't know.",
        "Gwen: But it could be Adam.",
        "Maddie: If I thought about Margo standing in the middle of the woods, staring down at her son's face. I just -- no, Gwen, I can't go there. Not --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Gwen: It's Will.",
        "Maddie: You told him that we were shopping?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I can't answer it. He'll know something's wrong.",
        "Maddie: Okay, so when you go home, just tell him that you were in the music store and you had the headphones on. You couldn't hear the phone ring.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I will lie to him. Again and again and again.",
        "Maddie: Well, you can't tell him the truth.",
        "Gwen: I know. I'm sorry. It just that every time I lie to him, it feels worse and worse.",
        "Maddie: You're protecting him. You are going to be here?",
        "Gwen: Why? Where are you going?",
        "Maddie: I'm going to go see if it's Adam.",
        "Gwen: Okay, what do you mean? Were are you going? The police?",
        "Maddie: Shhh. Okay, I don't know where I'm going, okay? But I need to find out if it's Adam.",
        "Gwen: And if the police catch you looking around, what are they going to think? You might as well hang a sign around your neck that says I killed Adam Munson.",
        "Maddie: That's right. I did it, okay? I did this, not you. So, I'm going to confess if they catch me. Because I'm not going to pull you into this with me.",
        "Gwen: Look, that's not what I meant by that. Look, you and I both know that the only reason that you hurt him, is because you thought he was attacking me. Look, we killed him together. We buried him together and he lied about it together. And we're going to continue lying about until it just goes away.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but it's not going to go away, is it? It's just going to drag on and on and we're going to feel worse and worse. So if it's Adam, I'm going to confess.",
        "Gwen: No, please don't.",
        "Maddie: Gwen, I can't keep doing this to you. I can't do it to will. And to Casey. Or to Margo, okay? I can't. I need to find out what's going on.",
        "Gwen: Look at me. Promise me you won't confess.",
        "Maddie: Gwen, I have to do this for myself. Because I can't keep lying any more than you can. I'm sorry.",
        "Gwen: Maddie, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: To you. To a woman who appreciates the finer things in life. Me.",
        "Vienna: Of course I appreciate you. You're a TV star.",
        "Brad: So, you're a big fan?",
        "Vienna: Well, I've only seen one episode.",
        "Brad: This one's even better. Me and the dog and --",
        "Vienna: Although, I don't like Katie very much, I wouldn't call her a dog.",
        "Brad: No, no, the other dog, the one that I tamed.",
        "Vienna: Oh, oh, I can't wait to see it. I love animals. Do you think we can get a copy of the tape or something?",
        "Brad: You know, I think I have a better idea.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It's so cold in here.",
        "Jack: Well, yeah, you don't want to melt the ice.",
        "Katie: Well, they can at least warm up the stands, right?",
        "Jack: It's a hockey game, Katie. Think of it as part of the whole experience.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm excited. I've never been to a hockey game before. You know, I've seen them on T.V. and stuff, but just flipping through the channels. Going on. You're going to have to help me out.",
        "Jack: Cool. No problem.",
        "Katie: Okay, who has the ball?",
        "Jack: It's a puck. It's a hockey puck. It's about yea-big, flat on both sides, so it can slide on the ice --",
        "Katie: Got it. I know. Hockey puck. I've heard of it. The guys with no teeth. Ow! Did you see that? The guy with the blood running down his face just hit the other guy with his pole.",
        "Jack: It's a stick. It's a hockey stick.",
        "Katie: Well, whatever. It was clearly assault. You should probably arrest him.",
        "Jack: Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.",
        "Katie: Ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hi, I'm sorry. I'm looking for Meg Snyder. Is she here today? She started work.",
        "Waitress: Yeah, yeah, she left. She was just here for training this morning. She won't be back until tomorrow.",
        "Craig: Oh, I see. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Mother, you're not making any sense. We've already made a substantial commitment to this company.",
        "Lucinda: No, Dear, you made it. Against my better judgment --",
        "Lily: Fine. Okay. We disagree on the potential. But I've already given them the go-ahead to put together a marketing campaign.",
        "Lucinda: A marketing campaign? Without talking to marketing? I mean, you haven't done any testing yet. For heaven's sake! I haven't even seen the business plan, Darling, and I think I've asked you for that three times, four times, I don't know --",
        "Lily: Fine. Fine. You're right. I'm wrong.",
        "Lucinda: Are you feeling all right? Oh, no, you're not pregnant again?",
        "Lily: No, no, I'm not pregnant. I'm just tired.",
        "Lucinda: All this talk about baby food, Dear, I think you should have a checkup.",
        "Lily: I don't need a checkup, I just need --",
        "Lucinda: What? What do you need?",
        "Lily: I'll be back. You want to fight to the death, fine. We'll do that.",
        "Lucinda: I don't want to fight with you.",
        "Craig: So, where's Lily gone? To buy a gun? I have some spare ammunition if she wants to finish you off.",
        "Lucinda: Do you want something, Craig?",
        "Craig: I'd like to know where my daughter is and my son. Has he started walking yet? Has he said any new words? Probably not da da, since he's been separated from his father for months --",
        "Lucinda: Yes, Dusty misses him very much.",
        "Craig: Have you heard from my daughter?",
        "Lucinda: No, I haven't. And if I had, I wouldn't tell you.",
        "Craig: Of course, you would. You wouldn't be able to resist. Oh, that's right. Focus on the menu. It's so important, whether or not you have the cottage cheese or the fruit cup.",
        "Lucinda: Since I have nothing to report, we have nothing to discuss.",
        "Craig: Are you lonely, Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: Lily will be back momentarily --",
        "Craig: No, no, no, I don't mean now. I mean per se.",
        "Lucinda: No, of course not.",
        "Craig: Really? Plenty to do in that big house of yours, huh? With all the hired help? Lucy was your last chance, wasn't she? Sierra's made herself scarce, and you and Lily are at each other's throats. Lucy was your last best chance for a happy family. She could do her residency at the hospital and you can see her every morning at breakfast --",
        "Lucinda: Do I wish she were here? Yes, I do. I miss her very much. However, sacrifices had to be made and they were. So, you would not ruin little Johnny's life the way you did Bryant's.",
        "Craig: Do you think that's kind, Lucinda? To constantly remind me that my son is dead?",
        "Lucinda: I find it necessary.",
        "Craig: All right, of course. Because you're the judge and jury on everything. Well, you certainly have sentenced Lucy to a lonely life. She'll never see Dusty again. And whatever I might think, she loved him. And he loved her. They could have been happy together. They could have been married, could've had children. She could practice medicine. But what does she got to look forward to now? A series of rented rooms. She can't put her roots down. She can't trust anyone. She can't afford to. So, no husband, no lover, all alone, just watching her money disappear. Because that's all she's got, right? Is money. And guilt. Because she can't make Johnny happy. She can't give him what he needs. A family, a home, friends.",
        "Lucinda: Question, will you relinquish your paternity rights so that they could come back here?",
        "Craig: He is my son.",
        "Lucinda: Then this sad lonely life that you've been outlining, it's all your doing.",
        "Craig: They would still be here if it wasn't for you. Because you're more interested in sticking it to me than protecting your own granddaughter. Get Craig, make him suffer. While she and Johnny are suffering, Lucinda. And you have ruined two lives. Was it worth it?",
        "Lucinda: Any sins that I acknowledge are sins of omission. Because I allowed Lucy to draw her conclusions and follow her heart. And one wonderful thing, it took her far, far away from you.",
        "Craig: She's a child.",
        "Lucinda: She's a woman. She's an M.D.",
        "Craig: And she'll never be able to practice medicine again, thanks to you.",
        "Lucinda: That's a new point. You know, why don't you just die. And get this over with. I mean, sooner. Rather than later. Or better yet, commit a crime, they'll put you in prison. I don't care which is, so long as it is fast.",
        "Craig: You're so full of hate.",
        "Lucinda: No, I don't hate you. I understand you and I see you for the parasite you are.",
        "Craig: And the single-mindedness, this inability to see any shade other than black and white, that works for you?",
        "Lucinda: So far so good.",
        "Craig: Really? Really? So no husband, I assume no lover. And no real friends save your cook and your driver. And your children, far away or angry. Your grandchild, gone. This is the life that you wanted. But then again, you have your bank account and your corporation to keep you warm at night.",
        "Lucinda: Dear, I got to be going.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Lucinda: All right.",
        "Lily: Wait, we haven't discussed what we were talking about --",
        "Lucinda: No, I've said what I want to say. All right, I'll talk to you later. All right?",
        "Lily: Okay. What did you say to her?",
        "Craig: What? You think I chased her off? Lucinda doesn't listen to anything I have to say.",
        "Lily: She doesn't care what I have to say either.",
        "Craig: Really? What happened?",
        "Lily: Oh, more of the same. She begs me to come back to work, then doesn't give me a chance to make a contribution.",
        "Craig: Sandbagged by your own mother.",
        "Lily: Story of my life.",
        "Craig: So what's she done this time? Maybe I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I don't want to go. I'm having fun.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but you're freezing.",
        "Katie: Not for long. You forget I'm a reporter. Have hat, will travel.",
        "Jack: Oh, resourceful. I like it.",
        "Katie: Actually, what I really want to ask you though is, why did you invite me here today? The kids didn't want to come?",
        "Jack: No, J.J. had a conflict and Parker -- Parker loves hockey, he's just not to fond of me right now.",
        "Katie: Like you said, he's mad at the world.",
        "Jack: No, he's mad at me for letting his mother leave him.",
        "Katie: That's not your fault.",
        "Jack: Try telling that to a 12-year-old.",
        "Katie: Sorry. Well, the important thing is that you're there for him. I mean, no matter what he feels about you, you're saving his life. He's going to be a happier kid and a happy adult because you're the one that hung in there. I mean, whether he ever admits it you or not, that's a different thing.",
        "Jack: I don't care about that.",
        "Katie: Just so you know, you're making a difference.",
        "Jack: Thank you. I needed to hear that today.",
        "Katie: All right, so who are we rooting for?",
        "Jack: The guys in the red jerseys. With the big O-U.",
        "Katie: Would that mean, Oakdale University?",
        "Jack: Oakdale University.",
        "Katie: Fantastic. All right, go big red. Oh, the other team got the puck.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's not good.",
        "Katie: Hey, Number 27? Yeah, you in the white. Keep it up and I'll knock out your other teeth! Yeah. Yeah, you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Are you sure we're alone?",
        "Brad: Yeah, it's just you and me.",
        "Vienna: Because the last time we tried this, Katie walked in on us.",
        "Brad: I hear you but don't worry, okay? The taping's over and she's gone for the day.",
        "Vienna: And Jack?",
        "Brad: Went with her. So, it's just you and me and we can give this set a proper christening.",
        "Vienna: I should have brought another bottle of champagne.",
        "Brad: Champagne aww! You know what? Champagne is for drinking and for toasting. So, so, to me. To me. I say, you know, I've had a lot of fresh starts, but this is a new beginning that I deserve. You know, I owned this show today and I'm going to ride it straight to the top.",
        "Vienna: I love a man with an ego.",
        "Brad: There's no point of being shy.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Vienna: That's my phone.",
        "Brad: They'll leave a message.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, you don't understand. It only rings like that when it's a emergency. Oh, God. Jean-Claude? Oui, c'est moi. Mon dieu.",

        "Cop #1: Doc say how long he was in the woods?",
        "Cop #2: No, they still have to figure that out.",
        "Gwen: Hey. I'm sorry that I couldn't pick up the phone when you called.",
        "Will: It's okay. Did you and Maddie have a good time?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: What did you guys buy?",
        "Gwen: Actually, we couldn't really find anything. So, we just, were like looking around.",
        "Will: It's a very beautiful ring.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I'm still getting used to it.",
        "Will: You okay?",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. I just -- I feel -- I feel a little off. Maddie didn't call, did she?",
        "Will: Didn't you just leave her?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I just thought maybe she called.",
        "Will: Listen, that e-mail that Adam sent to us, he's gone. He's not coming back. So, we can just forget about him, right? And start over.",
        "Gwen: Right. Yeah.",
        "Will: And if you don't want to talk about the demo anymore, that's fine. But there is some business that we do have to talk about.",
        "Gwen: What kind of business?",
        "Will: Like, do you want to keep your dorm room? And do you have all the classes signed up for what you want to take. And do you have your books. Why? What did you think I meant?",
        "Gwen: I don't know, well, yeah, I mean the dorm room, if you think we need it, let's hold onto it. And in terms of classes, I haven't gotten to speak to my advisor yet, but that theory and harmony class sounds really great that you were talking about.",
        "Will: I said talk, Hun, not feed me answers.",
        "Gwen: Right.",
        "Will: What is going on with you?",
        "Gwen: I just think I'm really tired.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'll bet you are. You haven't slept much since Adam disappeared. So, what's going on? Why are you so tense? Is it your mom? Is she bothering you?",
        "Gwen: No. I've hardly seen her.",
        "Will: So, is it me?",
        "Gwen: No, of course not.",
        "Will: Well, whatever it is, you can tell me. You know I'm on your side.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: So, what is it? What's wrong?",

        "[Gwen imagining]",
        "Will: You killed Adam? You buried him.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm sorry okay. We didn't know what we were doing. I mean, he was just being really violent. And I just didn't want him to hurt me I didn't know what he was going to do. I didn't know if he was going to rape me or kill me. I understand if you need to call the cops.",
        "Will: No, no, Gwen --",
        "Gwen: No, look I know what I've done it's horrible. Okay, I understand --",
        "Will: Gwen, you just said that he was attacking you! Isn't that what you said?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: So I'm just grateful that he didn't hurt you.",
        "Gwen: I wanted to tell you so much but I didn't know how.",
        "Will: Its okay, its okay. The body that the cops found in the woods what if it was Adam?",
        "Gwen: That's what I thought but Maddie wanted to wait till we know for sure.",
        "Will: No, it could be to late what if they figure out it was you and Maddie?",
        "Will: Gwen, you are my home. Come on you gotta get out of here.",

        "Police: And you're under arrest for conspiracy.",
        "Gwen: Wait a minute he didn't know anything until just now.",

        "Maddie: I -- I know I should have asked for permission, but I had this project for school it's -- criminology. Forensics. Forensics. And it's a community service thing -- project.",
        "Dallas: Community service? In the morgue?",
        "Maddie: I know it sounds ridiculous, but they all want us to pitch in.",

        "Craig: So finish it.",
        "Lily: No, that's enough. This is why I wanted to start this company. Babies, of all people, they have the right to have food that tastes good. I don't know see why my mother doesn't understand that.",
        "Craig: It's not about your ideas or the product or her Faith in you -- this is about control. That's all that matters to Lucinda. Whether or not she's in the driver's seat, it doesn't matter where she's going or who she's running over.",
        "Lily: I don't know what I'm going to tell these women. They are counting on me.",
        "Craig: Don't tell them anything.",
        "Lily: I've been cut off. They can't put a product together or market something without money.",

        "Craig: Okay, so they have some funding to tide them over for a while.",

        "Lily: I can't go into my own money, Holden would have a fit.",
        "Craig: Right, no, that's not good.",
        "Lily: Unless I leave Worldwide and go to another company?",
        "Craig: I don't think it's time for that yet.",
        "Lily: You've lost me.",
        "Craig: Lily, Worldwide is a conglomerate. Your mother has holdings from here to Tokyo. Newspapers, magazines, race horses --",
        "Lily: And we know, my mother has very tight reins on those holdings.",
        "Craig: She only focuses on trouble spots. If a subsidiary is performing she ignores it.",
        "Lily: What are you suggesting?",
        "Craig: I am suggesting that you simply move funds from subsidiary A to subsidiary B.",
        "Lily: Without my mother's permission? She would go ballistic.",
        "Craig: Yeah, if she found out, sure. But, you still have power of attorney right? When she got ill?",
        "Lily: Yes, we haven't changed it back to my mother yet.",
        "Craig: So she doesn't need to know. And when your subsidiary is performing and doing well, all's well that ends well.",
        "Lily: It's unethical.",
        "Craig: No, it's common practice. Your little company needs support, so it's time for the other subsidiaries to ante up.",
        "Lily: I don't disagree with you, but as you know my mother, she rules the roost.",
        "Craig: Look, at the end of the day when your company's doing really well, she won't care what happens, she'll just be proud of you.",
        "Lily: You know, you're right. So where do I start? Where do I get $100,000?",
        "Lily: That's embezzlement.",
        "Craig: Come on. Are you buying a mink coats with the money? A fleet of cars? No, you're just simply shifting funds within an organization -- an organization where your personal stake, your stock, is worth a hell of a lot more than the money you're borrowing. Which you're gonna return with interest when you turn a profit.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Craig: For what?",
        "Lily: Believing in me.",
        "Craig: Of course I believe in you -- you're the only friend I've got. You're so pretty when you smile.",
        "Lily: Oh, why don't we smile so much anymore? Natalie smiles all the time.",
        "Craig: That's because she has a wonderful mother.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I'm not so sure about that. I haven't seen Faith smile in a really long time.",
        "Craig: Yeah, she's a teenager -- almost.",
        "Lily: No, it's more than that. She's been very, very distant with me. For instance, yesterday I wanted to have just a day alone -- mother, daughter time alone with Faith. I got a call, business call, I had to take it. Instead of insisting that Faith just stay there and wait for me to get off the call, Faith said she wanted to go with her friend -- at least that's what she said she was going to do. I let her go, she ended up in the woods almost getting killed by a dog. Paul saved her.",
        "Craig: And that is your fault because?",
        "Lily: Because, I don't know, I'm just not myself these days.",
        "Craig: Lily, you just had child number four and you were in a coma. You know, it would take a women twice as long to recover from something like that. Look at you! Come on, how are you feeling? You look fantastic!",
        "Lily: That's very nice of you to say that. But, I have lost a couple of pounds when I was taking those diet pills I had a lot of energy, but since I've stopped taking them I just seem to be a little less focused.",
        "Craig: And so why'd you stop taking them?",
        "Lily: They're unhealthy.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry -- no, you know, I don't think you should take them if you don't to, but it's going to be hard for you to make the case that they're unhealthy. And if you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, Faith did not run off because you took a diet pill.",
        "Lily: All I know is if I stay here any longer, I'm gonna finish up this burger and order another one. And then curl up under a blanket and sleep for a week. So, let's go.",
