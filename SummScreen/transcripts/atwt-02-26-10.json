        "Parker: Mom? Mom!",
        "Carly: Oh! Hey.",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Carly: Aren't you late for school?",
        "Parker: Yeah. I'm -- I'm leaving right now, but I only have one class today 'cause I'm skipping that field trip, remember?",
        "Carly: Okay, good. Well, have fun, then, okay?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[Carly sighs and remembers]",
        "Janet: The best way for us to find a bone-marrow match is through a sibling.",
        "Carly: Right. I thought that Jacob wasn't a match.",
        "Janet: He's not.",
        "Jack: Let's not talk about this right now.",
        "Janet: But everybody's gonna find out sooner or later, Jack. Jack and I are going to have a baby.",
        "[Carly exhales sharply]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: Hi.",
        "Jack: You went to the store already?",
        "Janet: Uh, yeah, well, you know, I woke up early. I wanted to get some shopping done, so --",
        "Jack: Oh, good.",
        "Janet: [Sighs] How are you?",
        "Jack: Good. You?",
        "Janet: I'm good.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Janet: Okay, well, I should put these away because I want to go see Liberty and make sure she eats her breakfast.",
        "Jack: Well, then you should probably get going. Here. I'll put them away.",
        "Janet: Well, wait. Don't you have to go to work? I thought you wanted to see Holden.",
        "Jack: No, I did. Holden doesn't want me involved in this mess with Damian's death. He knows we have enough on our plate. Besides, from everything I've heard, the newscast with Molly went really well. We should concentrate on Liberty. So, get out of here. Go. Give her a hug for me.",
        "Janet: God, its crazy isn't it, that she can't see you because of the whole chicken pox thing? It's like everything is dangerous to her.",
        "Jack: Hey, she's -- she's gonna get through this.",
        "Janet: Being with you was, uh, it was nice.",
        "Jack: It's been a long time.",
        "Janet: I know. I know, but we'll get used to each other again. And just the fact that you were willing to do this, to make a baby with me -- that's everything.",
        "Jack: Hey, Liberty means a lot to me -- so do you.",
        "Janet: [Inhales sharply] Well, thanks for the -- um, are you gonna be home tonight after work, or are you gonna be staying late?",
        "Jack: No, I'll -- I'll be here.",
        "Janet: Okay, great, because, at this rate, I'll be pregnant before you know it.",
        "Jack: [Chuckles] Yeah, that's -- that's the plan.",
        "Janet: Okay. I'll see you later, then.",
        "Jack: All right.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "[Jack sighs and clears throat]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So, you spoke with Liberty's doctor? Well, Dr. Hearn said she might qualify for the study, but I don't want to get her hopes up if -- oh, that's great. I'll talk to her mother. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Yes, I know we have to move fast. Thanks.",
        "Liberty: Is there something you, uh, want to tell me?",
        "Dusty: Not without talking to your mother. Shouldn't you be in bed?",
        "Liberty: Dude, I heard you mention my name and then something about a study.",
        "Dusty: Mm-hmm. Let's wait for your mother.",
        "Liberty: If you're making plans about my life, I feel like I should know about them.",
        "Dusty: Well, there's a, uh, study that I found in Minneapolis.",
        "Liberty: A cancer study?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, young adults with leukemia. They're having incredible success, but let's just wait for your moth--",
        "Liberty: I want to do it. When can I leave?",
        "Janet: You should not be out here in the hallway. You should be in bed. Now, go.",
        "Liberty: All right, uh, hey, Dusty, whatever she says, I really want go.",
        "Janet: Go, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: I'm going, okay?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Janet: What are you doing here? I don't want you here.",
        "Dusty: Well, I want you.",
        "Janet: I can't do this now.",
        "Dusty: Not now, not here? Let's go someplace else, then.",
        "Janet: Later.",
        "Dusty: In the waiting room, now. Meet me there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: [Sighs] Hey, Buddy. What are you doing here?",
        "Parker: Is anybody else here?",
        "Jack: No. Why?",
        "Parker: I know it's probably nothing, but I didn't want to blow it off if something was going on.",
        "Jack: What is it?",
        "Parker: I'm worried about Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh, oh! Watch it!",
        "Carly: Craig, when are you gonna learn to call before you just show up here?",
        "Craig: When I'm sure you're not gonna tell me not to come. Take it easy. Having a bad day?",
        "Carly: [Sighs] Goodbye. No, Craig, please. W-when are you gonna take \"Goodbye\" for an answer, huh?",
        "Craig: Something tells me I'm not the one you want to beat up.",
        "Carly: You want to bet?",
        "Craig: I bet you want to hear my solution to your problems with Jack.",
        "Carly: I don't need you to solve anything for me, Craig. We're business partners -- that's it.",
        "Craig: And yet, when you found out Jack was planning to have a child with Janet, who did you turn to?",
        "Carly: [Sighs] I went to talk to you about business, okay, because I-I needed a distraction, and then you started to -- to put the moves on me, so I had to leave. I hope this isn't gonna be more of the same.",
        "Craig: We're in complete agreement. Work is the antidote to the poison that is Jack Snyder, so let's get to it. Morris is blown away.",
        "Carly: Do you think so?",
        "Craig: I know so. He said your designs are classy, wearable, and fashion- forward, whatever that means. He can't stop talking about it.",
        "Carly: To who?",
        "Craig: Me, but I got to warn you, when this deal comes through, we're gonna have to move fast.",
        "Carly: I'm ready.",
        "Craig: It's not gonna be easy to launch this thing from here, in the middle of nowhere.",
        "Carly: Wow. What are you getting at?",
        "Craig: We need to do it up this time. We need to make a big splash. We need to let people know that we're serious succeeding.",
        "Carly: Okay. But I don't know -- what are you suggesting?",
        "Craig: Simple. We move to New York.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Mom was running around the house, listening to music, and cleaning everything in sight.",
        "Jack: She's been known to clean the house, Parker.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but you didn't see her. She was turbo-cleaning. It was scary.",
        "Jack: What do you think's going on? Parker, your mother's not drinking again.",
        "Parker: Okay, but I haven't seen her in a mood like this in a long time, and I was thinking maybe you could tell me why she's acting like this.",
        "Jack: Well, she's probably stressed about this business thing she's got going on with Craig. Now, when do you have to be at school?",
        "Parker: I have a few hours. I'm gonna go visit Liberty.",
        "Jack: She's lucky to have you.",
        "Parker: When you love someone, it's easy to be there for them.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Now, you listen to me. You don't get to push me around. You don't get to show up here whenever you want to and demand that I talk to you!",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to help.",
        "Janet: How is this helping? You tell me that you want me and we belong together. I'm married to Jack. What am I supposed to do with this?",
        "Dusty: And now you're planning on having a baby with Jack.",
        "Janet: Who told you?",
        "Dusty: The point is, you don't have to. There's another way.",
        "Janet: No, there isn't. We ran out of donor matches.",
        "Dusty: Listen to me. There's a leukemia study in Minnesota. They're having incredible results. They have a bed available for Liberty if you can get her there today. Can you?",
        "Janet: Why are you doing this?",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to help you.",
        "Janet: What's in it for you?",
        "Dusty: Nothing.",
        "Janet: Oh, really? So, what -- you're a doctor now? You know what's best for my daughter? You know how to save her life?",
        "Dusty: You're panicking, Janet, and I understand why. You'll do anything to save Liberty, but having -- having a baby with Jack is not the answer right now.",
        "Janet: It is her only option, okay? There are no more bone-marrow matches for Liberty. If Jack and I have a baby together --",
        "Dusty: No, it's gonna make everything worse.",
        "Janet: I don't believe this.",
        "Dusty: Believe what?",
        "Janet: You're jealous that I'm having a baby to save Liberty's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Oh, God.",
        "Parker: Hey, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Parker: Are you okay?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Parker: Well, are -- are you sure? 'Cause I can get a nurse.",
        "Liberty: No, no, no, no, no. It's fine.",
        "Parker: I don't believe you. Look, if you're not gonna tell me what's wrong, I can get a bunch of doctors to come in here.",
        "Liberty: No, it's no big deal. I have -- just -- no, my head's itchy. It's -- its fine. It's -- I just -- I don't want to talk about it right now.",
        "Parker: Well, what -- what -- what are you doing? Are you trying to use mind control to get it to stop itching?",
        "Liberty: No. It's just -- uh, just -- well, one of the nurses said it's -- it's what happens when you maybe are about to lose your hair after the chemo, so it's just your head gets itchy, and then you scratch it.",
        "Parker: And you end up with a handful of hair?",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Parker: So, you -- so, you think if you don't touch your hair that it won't fall out?",
        "Liberty: It's -- no, it was working so far. I've been washing it really gentle, and -- and I'm -- I'm just -- I'm just being really careful, and I feel like if -- I'm having the chemo right now, so if I'm, you know, careful, it might not happen.",
        "Parker: Okay. Well, I, uh -- here. I brought you some snacks, if your stomach's feeling up for it.",
        "Liberty: Aww, chocolate. I -- no.",
        "Parker: I thought you liked chocolate.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I just -- I -- my taste buds are kind of dead. But it's weird, though -- popcorn still tastes amazing.",
        "Parker: Okay. Um, great. Well, when we have movie night this weekend, I will bring you tons of popcorn.",
        "Liberty: Movie night?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to download like five really terrible movies, and we can watch them and point at them and laugh at them all night. And I actually -- I got a pillow, so that I can sneak it in and sleep on the chair.",
        "Liberty: That -- that sounds like so much fun. I'm just -- I don't really think I'm gonna be here this weekend.",
        "Parker: What do you mean by that?",
        "Liberty: It's a good thing. It's a study in Minnesota. Um, actually, I called Dr. Hearn, and he gave me some -- some info about it. It's right there.",
        "Parker: Liberty, there's a lot of details in here about the side effects.",
        "Liberty: Who cares? I mean, if it makes me better, that's all that matters, right? My mom hasn't said if -- if she wants me to do it or not, but I'm gonna go with her permission or without it.",
        "Parker: Okay, well, do you want me to go with you?",
        "Liberty: No. I-I don't -- I don't want you to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm not gonna pick up and move to New York with you, Craig.",
        "Craig: I'm not asking you to live with me, though I'd be amenable, if you were so inclined. I'm kidding. We're gonna keep this strictly professional.",
        "Carly: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Craig: The best fabrics are in New York.",
        "Carly: I'll order them.",
        "Craig: The best seamstresses are there.",
        "Carly: They're cheaper here.",
        "Craig: The best marketing, merchandising, distribution -- it's all in New York, let alone all the runway shows. Carly, the best designers are in New York, not Oakdale, Illinois.",
        "Carly: Craig, I ran a successful business here before. I can do it again.",
        "Craig: Why make it harder on yourself?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: What about my children?",
        "Craig: They have great schools in New York.",
        "Carly: Their friends are here. Their family's here. My life is here.",
        "Craig: Some life -- chasing after Jack, begging for his attention.",
        "Carly: I'm not chasing after Jack.",
        "Craig: The point is, you're my business partner, and I need you to be focused.",
        "Carly: I am.",
        "Craig: You were trying to murder a rug on the porch. Jack's driving you crazy.",
        "Carly: You're driving me crazy.",
        "Craig: Jack and Janet are gonna have that kid, and you're gonna be tripping over the happy family every time you turn around. You need to put your -- put some distance between yourself and them, and the sooner, the better.",
        "Carly: I'm handling it just fine. I do not need to run away from Jack and Janet.",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Craig: Who is it?",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Craig: Oh, it's Jack, isn't it? Well, go ahead. Answer it. Prove to me that you're dealing with it just fine. What are you two doing?",
        "Carly: I'm not gonna answer it, not with you standing there, hanging on every word.",
        "Jack: Carly, it's -- it's me. I was just calling to check in.",
        "Craig: Oh, good. He's leaving a message. Let's hear what he has to say.",
        "Carly: Oh, stop it!",
        "Craig: Oh, I thought he didn't matter to you.",
        "Jack: Are you there?",
        "Craig: Shall I pick up?",
        "Carly: You touch that phone, I'll break your pinkie.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm -- I'm sorry I missed you. You, uh, you don't have to call me back. Bye.",
        "Craig: I thought you just said you didn't have to avoid him, that you were strong enough, secure enough, over him enough?",
        "Carly: Yes, and this proves it, that -- that I can -- I can ignore Jack whenever I want.",
        "Craig: This is me you're talking to. I don't say that to be cruel. You know I don't like to see you this upset.",
        "Carly: Then why don't you just stop annoying me, then, okay?",
        "Craig: I'm right. Monte Carlo can be a huge success, and you need that right now. So, what are you waiting for? New York beckons. The world awaits.",
        "Carly: And I am going to give New York and the world designs that are gonna knock their socks off, and I'm gonna do it from right here in my very own house. So, if you'll excuse me, I have floors to mop.",
        "Craig: Just think about it.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Let me show you what I set up.",
        "Liberty: Oh. You're pulling out the bag.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and if you wait for a second, I can actually show it to you.",
        "Liberty: What is it?",
        "Parker: You'll see. [Keys clicking] Hello.",
        "Liberty: It's your face.",
        "Parker: Yeah, yeah. I made it so that we can see each other face-to-face, even when I'm not around.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, that's a really nice idea, but I just -- I think the phone works great.",
        "Parker: I thought you'd like it.",
        "Liberty: I'm just not gonna be looking so good after this.",
        "Parker: Liberty, come on. You're beautiful, okay? And when they stick tubes up your nose and they put an I.V. in your arms, maybe a couple IVs, you might be downgraded to \"Pretty.\"",
        "Liberty: It might be worse than that.",
        "Parker: Liberty, it'll still be your face. That's all that matters. Come here. You're okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Okay, it's true. I don't want you to have a baby with Jack.",
        "[Janet sighs]",
        "Janet: I thought you of all people would understand why I'm doing this. You've been there, Dusty.",
        "Janet: Hey, we're -- we're -- we're doing better now, okay? Things have changed. He's trying. We're both trying.",
        "Dusty: I understand you're both trying to save Liberty, but for you guys to introduce a baby to your marriage right now --",
        "Janet: I don't have any other choice.",
        "Dusty: But now you do. The study might work, and you won't have to tie yourself to Jack.",
        "Janet: I am tied to Jack. I'm his wife.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to be.",
        "[Janet scoffs]",
        "Janet: I can't -- I can't -- listen to this. I-I'm gonna go be with Liberty.",
        "Dusty: Hold on a second. Take this with you, all right? It's information for the Minnesota study. There's a bed available if she wants it.",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Janet: What I said before, about being jealous --",
        "Dusty: I'm jealous of Jack.",
        "Janet: You could have anybody you want.",
        "Dusty: I'm looking at who I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: So, call me and let me know if the Minnesota thing's happening, okay?",
        "Liberty: It's happening, but I will let you know when.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Janet: Hi, Parker. I didn't know you were here.",
        "Parker: Hey, I-I was actually just leaving. Liberty will kill me if I don't get back to class.",
        "Liberty: Psshw!",
        "Parker: See you guys.",
        "Liberty: Bye. Later.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Liberty: Hey, Mom, where's Dusty?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Janet: I told him to go home.",
        "Liberty: Why?",
        "Janet: Because he was pressuring you about that study in Minnesota.",
        "Liberty: Mom -- he's not pressuring me. I really want to go. I read up on it, and it sounds like it's gonna be hard and I might be really sick for a while, but, come on -- if it gets rid of the leukemia, it's worth it, right?",
        "Janet: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Liberty: So I'm gonna go. Do you want to come with me?",
        "Janet: Oh! You just try and stop me.",
        "[Liberty chuckles]",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Liberty: I love you.",
        "Janet: Mm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's called \"Monte Carlo,\" and I wanted to offer Lisa the opportunity for Fashions here to the flagship store for my designs. Do you expect her soon?",
        "Salesgirl: I'm sure she'll be back soon.",
        "Carly: Good. Okay, well, in the meantime, I'll just -- I'll just have a look around, scope out the competition.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Carly: Excuse me.",
        "Salesgirl: I wish I could design clothes -- sounds exciting.",
        "Carly: Oh, yes, it is, indeed. And Oakdale is just the -- the perfect place for me to work. I mean, it's a great town. There's no need to -- to run anyplace else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: She keeps clinging to this town and her ex, so I'm just gonna have to make her an offer that she can't refuse. So I need you to tell me -- how much can I afford to put into Monte Carlo?",
        "[Ellis clears throat]",
        "Craig: Ellis, spit it out. What's the bottom line?",
        "Ellis: Craig, I'd forget about the fancy dresses. Right now, you can't afford to finance a line of socks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So, this study's in Minnesota?",
        "Janet: Yes, Minneapolis, and Liberty's really excited about it.",
        "Jack: Really? How'd you find out about this? Did Dr. Hearn suggest it?",
        "Janet: Uh, well, he helped with the details, and he got -- he got Liberty cleared to be accepted.",
        "Jack: Well, that's great.",
        "Janet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: How soon does she have to be there?",

        "Jack: Today?",
        "Janet: I know.",
        "Jack: Kind of short notice.",
        "Janet: I know, and I'm sorry to stick this upon you so quickly, but --",
        "Jack: No, no, no. I'm just trying to figure out how I'm gonna work this out. All right, I guess I'll take a sick day. I'll drive the two of you up there and come back.",
        "Janet: You can't. Chicken pox, remember?",
        "Jack: Right. You gonna be okay driving by yourself?",
        "Janet: Sure. We'll be fine. Liberty and I haven't been on a road trip in a long time. I'll be good.",
        "Jack: How long will you be gone?",
        "Janet: It's hard to tell, but I'll go back and forth, so we can still work on the pregnancy thing.",
        "Jack: You know, we'll deal with that later.",
        "Janet: Well, listen -- listen, I'm praying that this clinic thing is gonna work out, but I still don't want us to give up on the whole baby thing just in case, right?",
        "Jack: I know. I know.",
        "Janet: I'm gonna miss you.",
        "Jack: I know I can't see Liberty, but I can drive up and hang out in the parking lot in case you need me.",

        "Craig: [Chuckles] What is it this time -- another car, looking to buy a yacht, take a trip around the world?",
        "Parker: No, it's nothing like that.",
        "Craig: Well, whatever it is, the answer is no.",
        "Parker: Craig, I really need this money.",
        "Craig: [Sighs] That may be true, but your parents have made it very clear they don't want you to have that money yet, and I don't want to start a war with your mother or your father.",
        "Parker: Okay, then we don't tell them about it.",
        "Craig: Absolutely not.",
        "Parker: This is important. Craig, this is very important.",
        "Craig: What do you need the money for, Parker?",
        "Parker: I want to go visit Liberty.",
        "Craig: And where is she going that you need millions of dollars to get there?",
        "Parker: She's going out of town to be treated for her leukemia, and -- and I don't need my entire trust fund. I just need a really small bit of it.",
        "Craig: Are you financing these treatments?",
        "Parker: No, no. I just want to visit her. I don't want her to go through this whole thing alone.",
        "Craig: Well, I certainly know that feeling. But I'm sure her mother will be there.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but she can't talk to her the way that she can talk to me. This is my money. And I'm not trying to blow it on something stupid.",
        "Craig: You know, when you put it that way, maybe your money could be put to good use.",

        "Craig: I certainly do.",
        "Parker: It's a lot easier than I thought it would be.",
        "Craig: What can I say? You've inspired me. I know you care about Liberty a great deal, and you know, when you love someone, there's just nothing you won't do and no amount of money you won't spend to make them happy.",

        "Jack: You're a good mom.",
        "Janet: Thanks. What -- what happened in Fashions? How'd everything go?",
        "Jack: No, nothing -- nothing to worry about. Hey, Baby, come on. Come on. Come on.",
        "Janet: Oh, it's just gonna be so lonely, and I have to be strong for her.",
        "Jack: Hey, you will be, and when you can't, call me, okay?",
        "Janet: Mm. It's not the same. It's not like I'm gonna have you there to make all the scary things go away.",
