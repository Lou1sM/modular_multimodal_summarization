        "When Jack comes home fed up and ready to quit the force because of another run in with Nick, Carly decides it is time to let him in on her extra curricular activities. They are interrupted though by Hal calling Jack to the Wagon Wheel Motel pronto. Could this be what he needs to get his job back? With Parker's help, Carly uses the reverse directory online to secure an address for the phone number she has of Anatoli's. Meg and Emma have a heart to heart, but she can't bring herself to admit to her all she has done. Katie confronts Nick about his undercover work with Carly? He continues to defend the fact nothing is going on with him and Carly, but Katie thinks it is strange they both are at the same seedy strip club. Nick lets Katie in on the fact that Carly told him she had to work there to make ends meet because of Jack's demotion. Katie laughs as she explains that Carly was a big time fashion designer who could get a job anywhere. Nick realizes there is something wrong and he confronts Carly later. Did Jack send her to spy on him? When he realizes he didn't, he pushes his way into her house and searches through a few papers; Carly tries to hide Anatoli's phone number, but he grabs it out of her hand. Jen tries to explain to Hal how Paul is alive. She is very concerned though to find his motel room in shambles with blood on the floor. Jen is sure he wouldn't leave her again, but Hal thinks he is on the run again. Barbara, who has since arrived, is sure James is involved, but Hal doesn't believe that either. Jack arrives at the motel to find out that Paul may be alive and Jen came there to see him; Hal apologizes, but Jack tells him not to worry. What can he do for him now? He can go bring in his cousin, Meg because she was supposedly helping Paul all along. Mike calls Katie, who is at her wits end with Nick and Carly, among other things. Can he come home earlier then he thought? Mike explains there was an accident and his brother was hurt badly. He can't abandon him when he is in the hospital, plus he needs someone to run the project now. Katie hides her disappointment, but tells him to stay as long as he needs. Henry worries that Emily has sent Dusty to Paul's doorstep. Paul could be singing about her attempted murder of him by now. Emily decides she is going to stick around and see how this plays out, much to Henry's surprise. Jack catches up with Meg, as she is about to leave and tells her he wants to discuss Paul with her."

        "Nick: Glad you made it back safe and sound.",
        "Katie: Oh, no you're not. You're glad I didn't blow you out of the water tonight! What the hell is going on over at that Galaxy Club?",
        "Nick: Nothing that concerns you. It's just part of my job.",
        "Katie: Really. I think Jack Snyder may have been on the job tonight, but you are been a different story. So start talking.",
        "Nick: Drop it, Katie.",
        "Katie: I will not. You're living in my house and if you've gotten yourself caught up in something seedy --",
        "Nick: Its police business. I told you I was working undercover. Now you know where. That's all i can tell",
        "Katie: Undercover, huh? And is Carly under those same covers?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Sorry, Nicky. If anybody breaks this case, it's going to be Jack, not you. Hi, you're home early. Sweetheart",
        "Jack: Really? Feels like I pulled a double.",
        "Carly: Tired?",
        "Jack: That's one way to put it. That idiot, Nick, nearly blew the Galaxy Club operation.",
        "Carly: He did? How?",
        "Jack: I went out there on a routine drunk and disorderly and he lights into me about how I'm dogging him. What a fool. There's a big fish down there we're trying to hook and Nick nearly blows the cover.",
        "Carly: He's a real piece of work.",
        "Jack: And I'm tired of giving him the benefit of the doubt. The guy just worked my last nerve tonight. I don't know how much longer I can handle this.",
        "Carly: Sweetheart, you're not thinking of quitting, are you?",
        "Jack: I know things are tight, Carly, and some of the guys on the force are like brothers to me -- but there's not enough money in the world to make me want to work with that jerk. Heck, I'm not even working with him, I'm working under him.",
        "Carly: C'mere -- I know exactly what you need.",
        "Jack: You know what I need? I need some good news. Like Nick Kasnoff has disappeared and left nothing behind but a bad reputation.",
        "Carly: You just relax and don't worry because I do have some news for you. And it might be just what you need to leave Nick in the dust.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Whoa!",
        "Emily: Don't do that.",
        "Henry: I'm trying to be a safety net. Something about the shape of martini glass.",
        "Emily: You nearly gave me a heart attack.",
        "Henry: What's the madder? Don't kid a kidder. You're shaking like a fern. Why don't you tell me why you're drinking booze like its spring break at Fort Lauderdale?",
        "Emily: I did something terrible. Oh my God -- what am I going to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jen: Thank God you're here.",
        "Hal: I left the minute i got your call. What's going on",
        "Jen: I don't know. I came to see Paul but when I got here, the door was open.",
        "Hal: Whoa. Start over. You came to see who?",
        "Jen: Paul.",
        "Hal: Your brother Paul? Jennifer, he's --",
        "Jen: I know it sounds impossible, I know it does. But he is alive. At least he was when I talked to him a little while ago. But when I got here and found the place looking like this -- I don't know, but I'm really scared. Doesn't it look as if there was a fight here or something? It must have happened between the time I talked to him and the time I got here.",
        "Hal: Maybe, but I'm not sure I care. I'm still stuck on why you think your brother is alive",
        "Jen: Because I talked to him.",
        "Hal: But you haven't seen him.",
        "Jen: No. We spoke on the phone.",
        "Hal: And you're sure it was Paul?",
        "Jen: Daddy, I know his voice like I know my own.",
        "Hal: How long ago did you speak to him?",
        "Jen: An hour or so, maybe? I called this number and he picked up right away.",
        "Hal: And how did you know where to call him?",
        "Jen: Because a woman gave me his number.",
        "Hal: What woman? Jen, who gave you the number?",
        "Jen: She's a psychic.",
        "Hal: Oh, Jen --",
        "Jen: Wait. Before you assume that I let some scam artist take advantage of me, it wasn't that simple. I realized what she was doing and i went ahead and had her into the police station. Hauled but it turned out that she really was in touch with Paul. He had been paying her to drop clues that he was alive.",
        "Hal: For what purpose?",
        "Jen: I think he wanted to feel me out to see if I still hated him for what he'd done. He wanted to know if I could ever forgive him.",
        "Hal: So where's Paul supposedly been all this time?",
        "Jen: I don't know. I don't have details. That's what I came here to find out. As soon as I discovered where he was, I had to come here. He said, Paul, Dad, Paul said he would wait for me.",
        "Hal: That explains why nobody's here.",
        "Jen: No. Paul would not run away from me again.",
        "Hal: An, your brother is still wanted man. If you ask me, he's taken a powder again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I had to do something.",
        "Henry: Something as in pay him back Emily, you tried that and he didn't stay departed. Why didn't you leave him alone?",
        "Emily: I should have.",
        "Henry: Did you go after him again.",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Henry: Good.",
        "Emily: I sent Emma after him.",
        "Henry: Are you nuts, Emily? Do you know what you've done?",
        "Emily: I know. He's furious, so furious --",
        "Henry: He what? Could of killed someone? You better hope he did not do something worse. Like calling the cops. For all we know he could be spilling his guts to a murder and for all we know the S.W.A.T. team could be over here to arrest you now.",
        "Emma: Meg? I saw the car over here with the motor running, I didn't know whether you were inside or not. You almost scared me half to death. I thought you would leave town and I'd never see you again. What are you sitting out here like this? What is it? Meg? You want to tell me what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I was driving around and I couldn't focus. I was afraid I would get into an accident so I headed here, because I had nowhere else to go",
        "Emma: Why didn't you come inside?",
        "Meg: I just couldn't.",
        "Emma: Why on earth not?",
        "Meg: Oh, Mama \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Carly has no part in what I'm doing at the Galaxy.",
        "Katie: What was she doing there?",
        "Nick: Why are you giving so much grief?",
        "Katie: I don't understand why you're at some place where Carly's slinging drinks.",
        "Nick: It's small town.",
        "Katie: And that postage stamp she calls an outfit, it couldn't be any smaller.",
        "Nick: My point is if you need to work egg nights, there's only so many places you can work in this town. The reason why she's there is personal.",
        "Katie: Personal to who?",
        "Nick: Why don't you let this go?",
        "Katie: Because you put me in the middle of it.",
        "Nick: I put you in the middle of it?",
        "Katie: Who had me run interference with her husband? I think I've earned more than an explanation.",
        "Nick: Okay. But you can't tell anybody about it.",
        "Katie: Just tell me what's going on, I'll tell you whether I need to tell anybody.",
        "Nick: Ever since Jack got demoted he and Carly have been struggling for cash and she's been struggling for enough cash to make ends meet. She doesn't want Jack knowing she's working at the Club.",
        "Katie: You're kidding, right? How did such a hotshot detective like you become so stupid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're a miracle worker.",
        "Carly: Better.",
        "Jack: Yes. I'm almost beginning to forget about Nick. But it gets even better.",
        "Carly: Better than this? Impossible.",
        "Jack: Looks like I spoke too soon.",
        "Carly: Okay. Just hold that thought until I talk to you about something.",
        "Jack: You want to talk? Now? Are you kidding me?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I want to talk about what's got you so upset.",
        "Jack: Nick? That guy is the last thing I want to talk about.",
        "Carly: How about the case you're working on with him?",
        "Jack: You mean the case that he's about to blow sky high.",
        "Carly: What if you had information that Nick didn't? And what if that info led to a break in the case? Would that help?",
        "Jack: Sure. Yeah. But where am I supposed to dig that up if I can't go undercover?",
        "Carly: What if you had someone working undercover for you?",
        "Jack: Like who?",
        "Carly: We'll talk about that in a minute.",
        "Jack: Carly, what are you up to?",
        "Carly: You know, I always get good ideas. I was inspired and I had a fantastic idea. You'll understood after you see this. I want you to take a look.",
        "Jack: Hang on a sec, it's Hal. Hey, Hal, what's up?",
        "Hal: You know the Wagon Wheel Motel, right?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Hal: I'm here with Jennifer. Something's going down and I think you should be in on it.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Hal: Good. And don't make any stops. I need you right away.",
        "Jack: You got it.",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure, but Hal needs me right away.",
        "Carly: But Jack -- Jack",
        "Jack: whatever you want to help me with, we'll talk about it later, okay? Hal's case sounds big and he asked for me. Maybe it's the break I need to get back in.",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: You want to let me in on the joke?",
        "Katie: Sorry, but the thought of Carly being forced into slavery at some creepy strip club -- it's too ridiculous.",
        "Nick: You're missing the point, Katie. Carly is a good mom. If anybody found out she was working at the Galaxy, it could embarrass her.",
        "Katie: You think all Carly's ever done is be a mom? She's a fashion designer, Nick. She even had her own line so if she needed a job, don't you think she'd get one in the industry?",
        "Nick: Maybe there aren't any openings right now.",
        "Katie: You're not getting it. She was huge. She showed her stuff all over the world. I'm sure she could work something out",
        "Nick: So, why's she acting like this is the best job she could get?",
        "Katie: You're the detective, figure it out.",
        "Nick: You think she's there because of me?",
        "Katie: I think Carly's smart. I think that nothing in her life happens by accident. I think if she ended up in your gin joint, it's because she intended to be there.",
        "Nick: Katie, I told you, there's nothing going on between her and me.",
        "Katie: Maybe not. Maybe she ended up there by accident and you're just taking advantage of your luck. Or maybe there is something going on and you're not telling me. But either way, it looks to me like you two are sliding down a slippery slope. If you were smart, you'd put on the brakes now before anybody gets hurt.",
        "Nick: You know what? I'm out of here.",
        "Katie: Nick, wait, Nick. I'm just trying \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly daydreaming]",
        "Carly: Here Jack. Anatoly's contact -- phone number, address, everything -- did it help?",
        "Jack: Did it help? Carly, this number was I needed to bring down one everything of the biggest gambling rings this town has ever seen. I know everything now. How he launders the money. Where it all goes down. Exactly who's involved -- Carly, you're wonderful -- the best. How is it you always know exactly what I need and how to help me?",
        "Carly: I learned from the best g-man.",
        "Hal: Hey, you two. I didn't think you'd mind me dropping by without calling first. Not when I want to give you this.",
        "Jack: Does this mean?",
        "Hal: You're back on the force, Jack.",
        "Jack: But I only broke the case a few minutes ago.",
        "Hal: Good news travels fast.",
        "Jack: What about Nick?",
        "Hal: Nick who? You mean that guy I saw thumbing a ride along I-80? Guess he couldn't stand the shame.",
        "Carly: He only blew the biggest case in Oakdale police history. He deserves to get fired.",
        "Hal: And Jack deserves his job back. I want you down at the station right away. Got it?",
        "Jack: I love you, Carly.",
        "Carly: I love you, too, g-man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Mom?",
        "Carly: Hi, sweetheart.",
        "Parker: What are you smiling about?",
        "Carly: Because I have found a way to make everything all right again and guess what?",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Carly: You're going to help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Why did you do it? You were home free.",
        "Emily: I couldn't help myself. After everything I gave up again I couldn't let him live happily ever after with Meg Snyder.",
        "Henry: Excuse me. Do you notice a pattern here?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Henry: You have a tendency to knock in the door.",
        "Emily: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: You saw them in an embrace and you went right from the frying pan to the water.",
        "Emily: What should I do? Say easy come, easy go.",
        "Henry: You don't know what it meant. You don't know Paul, after being shot by his fianc\u00e9 and climbing over the bluff was ready for a new girlfriend or planning happily ever after. No. You saw a kiss and saw red and went from zero to revenge in ten seconds.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God, you're right.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Emily: All I could think about was how much he hurt me and I wanted to hurt him so I called Dusty. Oh, I have no idea what's going to happen next.",
        "Henry: Whatever it is, I think it's safe to assume we're going to need another drink.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jen: Yeah. Paul had months to think about this. He knew the consequences of trying to contact me. He wouldn't just bail out now.",
        "Hal: Why not? It wouldn't be the first.",
        "Jen: He wanted more than anything to have my forgiveness. He wrote it in that note that he left.",
        "Hal: He doesn't deserve your forgiveness.",
        "Jen: Dad, you didn't hear him. You didn't hear his voice. It was in his voice, it was like this ache. I could feel how much he wanted to see me. When he promised he was going to wait, I had no doubt in my mind he would be here.",
        "Hal: You're assuming an awful lot, Jennifer and I'm having a hard time with believing you.",
        "Jen: What would it take to convince you?",
        "Hal: A witness.",
        "Jen: I have a witness.",
        "Hal: Who.",
        "Jen: Meg.",
        "Hal: Meg Snyder.",
        "Jen: She's been with him and knows how he's been and might even be able to tell us what happy tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What's going on?",
        "Hal: That's what I'm trying to figure out. So far, it looks like Paul Ryan might actually be alive. Are you going to say I told you so now or later?",
        "Jack: If he's alive, where is he?",
        "Hal: It looks like he disappeared again. I'm sorry, Jack. I let him slip away when I thought the suicide --",
        "Jack: If you need me, tell me now.",
        "Hal: I need you to question your cousin, Meg. According to Jen, she's been aiding and abetting him and might have had something to do with this latest disappearance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Meg remembering]",
        "Meg: I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: You didn't have anything to do with it. Promise me, you're going to leave town and never come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: You were going to leave without saying good-bye to your momma.",
        "Meg: I couldn't face you.",
        "Emma: Why not? You know there's nothing that you can't tell me.",
        "Meg: I wish that were true. But there's a lot I haven't been able to tell you",
        "Emma: Well, let's change that -- starting right now.",
        "Meg: I can't. I'm just so ashamed.",
        "Emma: Ashamed of what?",
        "Meg: Everything. Everything. Who I am. Things I've done. I didn't want to lay it all at your feet so I thought it was better to make a clean break. But look at me. I couldn't even get that right.",
        "Emma: It's okay. I tell you what. Let's just go inside and get a good night sleep and in the morning, everything won't seem as bad.",
        "Meg: Things are spinning out of control and i just don't know how to stop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Coming up on \"As the World Turns\".",
        "Carly: What are you doing here?",
        "Nick: Just trying to find out how long you thought you could actually play me.",
        "Henry: You are set to land in the hottest water you've ever been in your life and you want to stay? In the name of all that's holy, why, Em.",
        "Jen: My brother, I think I know where he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: There's nothing that can't be stopped if you honestly want it to. You want to tell me what's wrong? Maybe I can help.",
        "Meg: I -- I don't know.",
        "Emma: Are you afraid I won't understand?",
        "Meg: Sometimes I feel like you set the bar so high that I could never reach it. All I ever wanted to do was make you proud. But I never knew how.",
        "Emma: Sweetheart, come on. I can't believe that all this anguish is because of me.",
        "Meg: I can't be as good as you, so why even try, so I gave up.",
        "Emma: All I ever wanted is for to you be your beautiful self. I love you. I love you just as you are. I do. Maybe i just set goals higher for my children, but it's because I have no doubt that they can achieve them.",
        "Meg: Now that you know what a disappointment I can be, maybe --.",
        "Emma: Just stop that. Meg. You're a kind and loving woman. You've chosen to take care for people.",
        "Meg: For all the good I've done anyone.",
        "Emma: You've done a lot of good for a lot of people. Sometimes you get a little passionate about the ones you love and sometimes that passion leads you astray.",
        "Meg: Don't make excuses for me. Things have gotten really bad and I don't know how to fix it.",
        "Emma: Like with everything in life, sweetheart, one step at a time.",
        "Meg: Where do I even start?",
        "Emma: You start taking responsibility for what you've done. Take responsibility and do what you can to make it right.",
        "Meg: That's just it. I want to make things right, but I don't know if I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jen: Somebody hurt him, didn't they?",
        "Hal: I need to poke around a little more before I can come to any conclusions, Jen. You didn't touch anything, did you? Good. For all we know, Paul could have trashed the place himself. He might just be out walking it off. I'll be right back.",
        "Barbara: Jennifer?",
        "Jen: Over here, Mom.",
        "Barbara: I got your message. Have they found Paul?",
        "Hal: This may well be a crime scene, Barbara. Don't touch a thing.",
        "Barbara: A crime scene? What do you mean?",
        "Hal: Talk to your daughter.",
        "Barbara: I don't understand. Paul's alive, but he's gone off again?",
        "Jen: I don't think he had a choice, Mom. That's what I was trying to tell Daddy. Look at this room.",
        "Barbara: How did he sound when you spoke to him? Are you sure that it was your brother.",
        "Jen: Yes. I know my brother. And he sounded calm. He said he would wait for me. But when I got here -- I can't lose him again, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Does your father think he's been hurt.",
        "Jen: Daddy's not sure what to think. He's not even sure Paul's really alive. But I am. When Paul said he would wait for me, he would have been here unless something forced him out.",
        "Barbara: I think you're right. Look at the place. Someone did something to my son.",
        "Jen: Be careful, Mom, you heard what Daddy said --",
        "Barbara: Oh, no -- look at these. I know who hurt my son. This is the work of James Stenbeck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You want me to help? How?",
        "Carly: Know how you can do all kinds of things on the computer? Can you figure out a way to get an address if I give you a phone number? I mean, without a name.",
        "Parker: That's easy. Anybody can do it.",
        "Carly: Even me?",
        "Parker: Sure. Just type in reverse phone book. It'll tell you what to do.",
        "Carly: Am I lucky or what. Am I lucky to have a genius for a son! Thank you, sweetie. Now, go back up to bed. You've been a big help.",
        "Parker: Does this mean Jack's going to get his job back and everything's going to be okay again?",
        "Carly: That's what I'm counting on, sweetie. Okay, Nick Kasnoff -- your days are numbered.",

        "Katie: Hello? Hello? Who's there?",
        "Mike: Katie? Can you hear me now? It's Mike.",
        "Katie: Oh, Mike, thank God. I was so hoping it'd be you.",
        "Mike: I got your message, but I was going to call you anyway.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry that I called you while you were working. I miss you so much",
        "Mike: I miss you too, baby.",
        "Katie: I thought I could do this -- you know? But it's even harder than I thought. There's so much going on and it's not the kind of thing I want to deal with on the phone. I don't suppose you could come home sooner than you planned?",
        "Mike: I'd love to -- but there's a lot going on here, too, honey. And I hate to say this, but it's not good.",
        "Katie: You sound exhausted.",
        "Mike: I am. There was an accident at the work site.",
        "Katie: Are you all right.",
        "Mike: I'm fine. But my brother -- he took a bad hit.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Mike: Damn demolition crew -- shook a crossbeam loose and it got him.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. Is Mark going to be okay?",
        "Mike: Right now his chances are fair. His leg's shattered into a dozen pieces.",
        "Katie: Mike, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Mike: Pray. Mark's got a long road ahead of him.",
        "Katie: I wish I were with you.",
        "Mike: Me too. But you've got to be there to do your show, and I've got this whole project to supervise now.",
        "Katie: There's nobody else to do it?",
        "Mike: Not with my experience. Mark wasn't building this thing to look good now and fall apart in a couple of years. And I'm the only one that seems to get it.",
        "Katie: So I guess your brother's really counting on you.",
        "Mike: Katie, if I leave, this whole thing goes south -- but more than that, I can't bail on him while he's in the hospital. He doesn't have anybody else.",
        "Katie: Of course. You stay as long as you need to.",
        "Mike: I know I promised you I wouldn't be here more than a couple weeks.",
        "Katie: There's no way you could have foreseen this.",
        "Mike: I wish I could be two places at once. I don't want to leave Mark, but I'd give anything to be on a plane headed for home. I want us to finish planning our wedding.",
        "Katie: Don't be silly - it can wait. There are more important things in life than a cake and wedding dress and tropical honeymoon",
        "Mike: I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: I know. But don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Mike: There's nowhere else I want to be than with you.",
        "Katie: I love you -- so much.",
        "Mike: I will see you soon and you can tell me about all that stuff going on.",

        "Henry: Maybe there's a way we can get Dusty off the trail? Can you call him and tell him to lay off Paul and maybe we can salvage the situation.",
        "Emily: No. Dusty went out of here like a bat out of hell. He went straight for Paul.",
        "Henry: All we can hope is that he went over the edge and tried to kill him.",
        "Emily: Don't say that.",
        "Henry: Why not? You tried to.",
        "Emily: I was in so much pain i didn't know what i was doing.",
        "Henry: That's a good defense. Maybe the jury will give you a lethal injection and not the electricity chair.",
        "Emily: That is not going to happen.",
        "Henry: I have a great idea. Why don't we both take the money and we'll go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I should have known too much time has gone by. It's been too quiet.",
        "Jen: What are you talking about?",
        "Barbara: I'm talking about James. He has a history of disguising himself and putting himself in obvious places and dropping clues expect Meg to figure it out.",
        "Jen: Paul would have found a way to tip me off.",
        "Barbara: This may be the tip-off. He never forgave him for rejecting him.",
        "Jen: On Paul.",
        "Barbara: On Paul and all of us. He watched us grieve and move on with our lives, just when we were about to get past this, Paul is alive. He's toying with me and torturing me.",
        "Hal: Nice theory, Barbara. I'm not buying it. I just showed Paul's picture to the hotel manager and said he looked like another man in this room under another name and then he described Paul wearing this disguise. God knows what he was planning. He already tried to warm his way into Jen's life through a fake psychic.",
        "Barbara: It's just like James.",
        "Hal: You're right. He's turning into the same monster his father was.",
        "Barbara: Don't you say that.",
        "Hal: When are you two going to open your eyes and realize what's happened here? Paul's gone. His conscience and any decency he has is gone.",
        "Barbara: Stop, right there! He is my son and I love him.",
        "Hal: Then accept what he's become.",
        "Barbara: No, I won't. I won't accept your twisted version of my son.",
        "Hal: Have you forgotten what he's done to you? He kept you from your child until your spirit was so broken you turned to drugs to dull the pain. You ended up in the psych ward. Am I the only one that remembers? Am I the only one that cares?",
        "Jen: Dad, no matter what he has done, in his own way, it was to protect me. Yes, he is damaged but he is my brother and he would have been here if he could have been. Something has happened to him and you have to find out what it is, before it's too late.",

        "Carly: You don't know a damn thing about my life!",
        "Nick: Jack's suspended so he's got you down there spying on me. Wouldn't be the first time you two crossed the line together.",
        "Carly: Puhleez. First of all, you're not important enough for Jack to care what you do. And secondly, Jack wouldn't want me in that place for any reason. Least of all to do surveillance on you.",
        "Nick: Then why are you doing it?",
        "Carly: None of your business.",
        "Nick: You're just one of these housewives that get a cheap little thrill in life",
        "Carly: I don't owe you any explanations.",
        "Nick: You'd prefer to explain it to your husband?",
        "Carly: I intend to explain everything to Jack. I already would have if he hadn't gotten an important phone call from Hal.",
        "Nick: You're way to smart to risk your family for a cheap thrill.",
        "Carly: And way too impatient to stand here and be grilled by the likes of you. You can go now.",
        "Nick: There's got to be some other reason why you were so eager to shake your moneymaker for a creep like Anatoly.",
        "Carly: And if there is, you'll never know. That's for sure. Excuse me! What do you think you're looking for? You'd better go before I get Jack back here and",
        "Nick: And what? Rip him from the little charity case Hal's got him on? Are you trying to blow his career once and for all?",
        "Carly: Let go! Give that to me now!",
        "Nick: You little sneak. You've been holding out on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Maybe you're right.",
        "Henry: Maybe.",
        "Emily: About Meg and Paul. Maybe there was another reason he was kissing her.",
        "Henry: I'm not trying to give you hope here. I'm just saying your logic has been a little flawed lately.",
        "Emily: Henry, I'm not going to do anything crazy.",

        "Barbara: Honey, your dad's just trying to protect you.",
        "Jen: What if he misses something? What if Dad misses something? Paul could be hurt or worse.",
        "Barbara: Your dad is a professionals and he has to follow procedure. If there's any evidence of foul play, he will find it.",
        "Jen: Paul wouldn't just abandon me again, would he? What if Dad is right and he got cold feet and he ran off, especially if he thought I had the police with me, he would take off.",
        "Barbra: Listen to me, if your brother ran, he's just running from himself or his guilt or shame of letting us down. He loves you. He -- you wanted so badly to forgive him. The only thing i can think is something terrible did happen to him or he's gone somewhere, he's waiting for you somehow. And you can stay for a while. Dusty's on a trip and I don't know when I'll be home.",
