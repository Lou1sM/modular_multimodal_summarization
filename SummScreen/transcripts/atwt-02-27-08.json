        "Noah: Hey.",
        "Luke: Hey. I mucked out the stalls and fed the horses. It wasn't the same without you.",
        "Noah: I'm sorry I couldn't help. I just didn't want to leave Ameera alone.",
        "Luke: That's okay. How's she doing?",
        "Noah: She's napping now. She was really shaken up after that boiler backfired.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, I don't blame her. Can you imagine what life must have been like for her in Iraq?",
        "Noah: We have to help her after her visa's expired.",
        "Luke: Well, my grandma always has a bunch of lawyers on retainer. I could ask her for some advice.",
        "Noah: You'd ask her? I mean, you'd do that for Ameera?",
        "Luke: Sure. Why not?",
        "Noah: Honestly, I -- I didn't know how you felt about her.",
        "Luke: I don't have a problem with Ameera. I just wonder why she's so important to you.",

        "Will: Hallie's sound asleep. Are you okay?",
        "Gwen: No, I keep thinking about what Sofie said in court. I feel like we stole Hallie from her mother.",
        "Will: No, Gwen. No, we didn't. The judge said that Sofie was not fit to be a parent and that she endangered Hallie's life.",
        "Gwen: I understand that she did certain things wrong, but I don't know, I can't help stop feeling like she's the victim in all this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi. You're back.",
        "Sofie: Yeah. You were so nice to me before, I wanted to return the favor.",

        "Sofie: A surprise for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You need to stop feeling guilty. The judge made the right decision. Hallie belongs with us.",
        "Gwen: Maybe I just can't believe it's finally over. You know?",
        "Will: Well, it is. She's ours. You know what? I think that we should take her out, and we should show her off.",
        "Gwen: Right -- it's freezing outside, Will.",
        "Will: Yeah, well, I'm going to warm up the car. She's going to be fine.",
        "Gwen: Will, I don't want to make a big deal about winning custody. It doesn't feel right.",
        "Will: Okay, well, how about we bring her to the hospital and let her meet Paul? She's bound to cheer him up.",

        "Chris: What are you doing back at work already?",
        "Bob: Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Chris: It's good to see you up and around.",
        "Bob: Well, it's nice to be up and around and in charge again.",
        "Chris: Well, you look good. You look good. How's physical therapy going?",
        "Bob: Getting better every day. Your mother is relentless about the exercising.",
        "Chris: Well, she's determined to go on that cruise.",
        "Bob: It seems she is. She's been asking about you. Where you been?",
        "Chris: Well, I thought I'd give you some space. I didn't want to stress you out.",
        "Bob: Have you made a decision?",
        "Chris: About what?",
        "Bob: I thought you were leaving Oakdale and Memorial.",
        "Chris: That was your idea, Dad, not mine. I'm not going anywhere.",

        "Sofie: I bought you a book.",
        "Paul: What is it?",
        "Sofie: Well, most of the adult paperbacks in the gift shop were kind of trashy, so I looked on the children's rack, and I got \"Treasure Island.\"",
        "Paul: That was my favorite.",
        "Sofie: Oh, I'm glad I picked it out for you.",
        "Paul: Will you read it to me?",
        "Sofie: You're kidding?",
        "Paul: No. I'd like for you to keep me company.",
        "Sofie: \"Chapter one -- the old sea dog at the Admiral Benbow. A great number of people have asked me to write down the whole story of Treasure Island, and that I shall do. But I will leave out the location of the island, because the treasure is still out there. The story begins back when my father was running an inn called the Admiral Benbow.\"",

        "Luke: Are you sure that's all this is about?",
        "Noah: My father nearly wrecked our lives. I mean, he killed my mother. He hates the way I feel about you. This could be a good way for me to get past all the horrible things he's done.",
        "Luke: You don't have to make up for your father's mistakes. You have to live your own life.",
        "Noah: I know, but I just want to try and make things right.",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, you're a good guy, but doing this isn't going to make your father accept that you're gay. This girl is a stranger to you. You don't owe her anything.",
        "Ameera: He's right, Noah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry, I can explain.",

        "Katie: But it doesn't change anything between us.",
        "Brad: I know.",
        "Katie: You do?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I know. I mean, I helped you get out of hot water with Jack and Carly. But I did it for Parker. And I did it for my friend. 'Cause that's what we are, right? Friends.",

        "Vienna: Kissing you was a mistake. I can't do this to my Henry.",
        "Gray: I know you want me. Just give it some time.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no! No, I won't. It's wrong.",

        "Henry: It's Vienna. I've lost her for good. I caught Vienna and Gray making out outside our hotel suite. And by the looks of it, they were going to go all the way.",
        "Katie: No, Vienna would never do that!",
        "Henry: I saw it with my own eyes!",
        "Brad: Maybe it was just a friendly kiss.",
        "Henry: Friends don't swap spit like that, Brad. Okay, it is over. I've lost my \"Her.\"",
        "Katie: No, no, Vienna loves you, Henry. I'm going to go over there and talk to her.",
        "Henry: Why don't you wait until she stops singing \"Oh, sweet mystery of life\"?",
        "Katie: Who is this Gray Gerard guy?",
        "Henry: He's a high roller. Brad knows him -- you played poker with him.",
        "Brad: I did?",
        "Henry: Yeah, you did. You lost your shirt, literally. He's like Donald Trump without the comb-over. He's got enough money to turn Vienna's head.",
        "Brad: Vienna would never go for the Donald.",
        "Henry: We're talking about Gray, Brad. Okay? I can't compete with that.",
        "Katie: Okay, let's -- let's do a little research.",
        "Brad: I'm on it. Okay, check it out.",
        "Katie: He does look rich.",
        "Henry: Yeah, he does, doesn't he?",
        "Brad: Yeah, he's made a killing in the real estate business.",

        "Ameera: I don't want to cause any trouble. I can find another place to stay.",
        "Noah: We were just talking. I haven't changed my mind about helping you.",
        "Ameera: I'll be fine on my own. Thank you for all the help you've given me, but I have to go.",
        "Luke: No, no, I want you to stay.",

        "Paul: Don't, don't -- you don't have to go. She's my guest, Will. Stop.",
        "Will: You know what? It's fine. We'll just come back later.",
        "Paul: Don't be like that, please. I'd like to visit my niece. [Hallie babbling] Hey -- say hi to Uncle Paul. Thank you for this.",
        "Will: Are you -- are you doing okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, how are you feeling?",
        "Paul: Well, my back's a little well done, but I'm going to be fine.",
        "Gwen: It's okay. If there's anything that we can do. Just let us know.",

        "Gwen: Yeah --",
        "Will: Here, you want a bottle?",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. She just ate. She's a little fussy. That's all.",

        "Chris: Do you want me to leave?",
        "Bob: That's not what I said.",
        "Chris: Let me prove how good I can be for Memorial. I didn't handle things well the first time around. I know that now, Dad.",
        "Bob: But you have to be aware that any move that you make here will be scrutinized.",
        "Chris: I'm still a good doctor. And I'll prove it to you and anyone else. I never meant to hurt you or the hospital.",
        "Bob: I believe that. But you do have a lot to learn.",
        "Chris: I want to learn from you, if you'll let me.",
        "Bob: Well, you know, I'll expect excellence, commitment, as I do every member of this staff.",
        "Chris: I won't let you down.",

        "Brad: Okay, there he is. Where's Vienna?",
        "Katie: Maybe she sent him packing. This could be a good sign.",
        "Brad: What's the plan?",
        "Katie: You take Gerard. I'll handle Vienna.",
        "Brad: Give me a beer.",

        "Vienna: I don't know.",
        "Katie: Vienna, what were you doing with this Gray guy?",
        "Vienna: We just had an innocent dinner, and he gave me way too much champagne, and then he just took advantage.",
        "Katie: Well, you need to tell Henry that!",
        "Vienna: You're right, but he's not going to believe that.",
        "Katie: Should he? Tell the truth, Vienna. Is there something you find attractive about what this Gray guy is offering you?",
        "Vienna: Look at these diamond earrings.",
        "Katie: He gave you earrings, too?",
        "Vienna: I gave back the diamond necklace and the diner. I couldn't give these back, too!",
        "Katie: What about Henry?",
        "Vienna: I still love him. That hasn't changed.",
        "Katie: Vienna, you're sending mixed signals. Do you want Henry, or do you want your old life back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Paul's got to get better so I can spoil you rotten you two have a beautiful daughter.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, we do, thanks to Sofie.",
        "Will: Okay, Sofie, time's up.",
        "Gwen: No, it's okay.",
        "Sofie: It's okay. Thank you for letting me hold her. I'll go wait outside.",
        "Will: What the hell are you doing hanging out with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Perfect timing. I'm due for a break. Let me take you out to an early dinner.",
        "Sofie: Gwen and Will are inside. I'm waiting to say good-bye to Hallie.",
        "Chris: Are you sure?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, they might be a while. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Sofie is visiting me.",
        "Will: Since when?",
        "Paul: Since I was admitted to the hospital.",
        "Will: You do know that she kidnapped Hallie?",
        "Paul: I know that you've won custody. And it's over. Are you telling me that I can't be friends with the girl?",
        "Will: You don't think it's a little weird? Like maybe she's hanging out with you because she wants to get close to Hallie?",
        "Paul: What I think is that she missed her daughter, and I know where she's coming from.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: We have a tradition at the Snyder farm never to turn down a stranger in need.",
        "Ameera: In Iraq, we have the same tradition, but it's up to the guest not to impose on the host.",
        "Luke: No, but you're not an imposition. Colonel Mayer can't help you, Noah can. What's important to Noah is important to me. Please, stay, let us help you.",
        "Ameera: Are you sure?",
        "Luke: I'm sure.",
        "Ameera: Thank you. You're very generous.",
        "Noah: Thanks, Luke. [Cell phone ringing] Hello? Speaking. Is there a problem? I see. Okay, thanks. Good-bye.",
        "Luke: Who was that?",
        "Noah: That was the warden at Statesville prison. He had a message from my dad.",
        "Noah: My father wants me to visit him.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Noah: I don't know. The warden said he was very insistent, that it was important.",
        "Luke: When does he want you to go?",
        "Noah: Today.",
        "Luke: That's short notice.",
        "Noah: I'm not going.",
        "Ameera: I'll go with you. I haven't seen the Colonel since before my mother died.",
        "Noah: No way. I'm not letting you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I can't believe you're taking Sofie's side.",
        "Paul: I'm not taking anybody's side, Will. I'm stuck here all by myself. I like her company.",
        "Will: So you couldn't find somebody better to bond with?",
        "Gwen: What about Meg? Has she been here?",
        "Paul: Yeah, Meg was here, but she left. She's not coming back.",
        "Gwen: Why not?",
        "Paul: Because she's not coming back. It's over.",
        "Will: So, is Sofie some kind of sick replacement?",
        "Paul: No, Will. Sofie is my friend. I really hope that's not going to be a problem with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Gray reminds me of my old life, and everything I've given up.",
        "Katie: But he doesn't love you. He's using you.",
        "Vienna: Well, but sometimes I think about the jewelry, and the designer dresses, and the travels --",
        "Katie: What about love? You really ready to give up everything you have with Henry just so you can live that high-life again?",
        "Vienna: Yes, no -- I -- no. I don't know.",
        "Katie: Wake up, Vienna! Henry is the best thing that's ever happened to you. You're always the one that's telling me that true love should always win.",
        "Vienna: Well, I used to believe that, but look at you, you're passing up true love with Brad.",
        "Katie: We don't love each other. And stay on the subject. You cannot give up Henry.",
        "Vienna: Well it's not easy loving Henry. No, I want to get married, Henry didn't. I loved owning the diner. Henry didn't. I want children, and Henry might never. Maybe -- maybe my happy ending with Henry is not meant to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Trans fats, MSG, high fructose corn syrup. I don't know how people can subject their bodies to this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: I'm celebrating. I have my money on a beautiful woman and I'm confident I'm going to win.",
        "Brad: This woman must be something special.",
        "Gray: She is.",
        "Brad: Pretty sure of yourself.",
        "Gray: I know how to get what I want.",
        "Brad: Well, I heard you made a killing in real estate.",
        "Gray: Hmm. My reputation precedes me, huh?",
        "Brad: Small town. People talk. I'm sitting on a small fortune myself.",
        "Gray: Yeah? Well you ought to pay a visit to Eddie in Room 119. There's another game tonight. Tell him Gray sent ya.",
        "Brad: Well, you know, I'm not really interested in poker. I'm looking for a business opportunity. Maybe we can go into business together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I know what it's like to be alone, Vienna. Trust me, it's not fun.",
        "Vienna: Well, you choose to be alone. I won't be.",
        "Katie: If you go back to that 18-karat lifestyle, are you prepared to give up everything that you love about this life? The diner, Pepper -- you really think you could be happy without Henry?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Ameera, I get that the Colonel was good to you. He was a father to you when you needed one, but the thing is, he's changed. I don't want you to see the way he is now.",
        "Ameera: Maybe I can remind him of all the good that he did. I could even get him to accept your relationship with Luke.",
        "Luke: That'll never happen.",
        "Ameera: Why not? I knew your father very well. I was close with him. If I can make things better between you two, I want to do it.",
        "Noah: He's very stubborn. You're not going to change his mind.",
        "Ameera: You don't have to go with me. I made it here all the way from Iraq. I want to see him.",
        "Luke: You don't want to go alone.",
        "Ameera: I will if I have to.",
        "Noah: Well, then we're going to Statesville prison.",
        "Luke: Well, if both of you are going, then I'm going, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm just friends with Sofie, okay? I don't see why that's such a big deal.",
        "Will: Well, we just got custody of her child. It's a little awkward.",
        "Gwen: Come on, Will, it's Paul's choice.",
        "Will: All right. Fine. Whatever. We'll just call next time we want to show up.",
        "Paul: No, don't -- please, don't do that.",
        "Will: Well, we have to, 'cause I wasn't okay walking in here and seeing her here.",
        "Gwen: Hey, we came here to cheer him, not stress him out.",
        "Will: Yeah, fine. I'm sorry, but you got to know how I feel about it.",
        "Paul: Okay. I know now.",
        "Will: So, has Mom been in to see you?",
        "Paul: Not in a while. No, she hasn't been her usual hovering self.",
        "Will: Yeah, we invited her over to the house to celebrate after the hearing, but she turned us down.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, it's not really like her to pass up time, you know, with the baby.",
        "Will: Has she seemed like off to you or anything lately?",
        "Paul: She's probably just a little tired, there's a lot going on, it's completely understandable.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Paul: But Mother can take care of herself. You don't ever need to worry about her.",
        "Will: You're right.",
        "Gwen: You know what? We should go. We should let you get some rest and if you need anything, you know, just call. Okay?",
        "Will: I'm glad you're doing okay. Feel better. All right?",
        "Paul: Yeah, thanks. Take good care of the baby.",
        "Sofie: Gwen, Will. I have a gift for Hallie. It's something for her to remember me by. I've always loved the ocean and ocean animals and I thought maybe Hallie and I shared that.",

        "Sofie: I thought that um --",
        "Will: We're not taking it. Thank you though.",

        "Luke: It's going to be hours before we get there.",

        "Luke: That's why I came prepared. Sandwiches, chips, cookies, soda, anything you need for a long road trip.",
        "Noah: It's going to be weird seeing my father in prison.",
        "Ameera: I can't wait to see him. He's going to be so surprised.",
        "Luke: Yeah, he's going to be thrilled the boyfriend came along.",
        "Noah: Hey, I want you there. You're family now, he's got to respect that.",
        "Ameera: I don't mean to overstep, but how did you know you were -- you know --",
        "Noah: Gay?",
        "Ameera: I'm sorry. I don't know any people like you.",
        "Luke: You don't know any gay people?",
        "Ameera: I don't think so.",
        "Luke: Well I realized in high school. I was into sports, but not girls. I skipped all the parties and the dances, I kept drinking, way, way, way too much. I guess I just couldn't deal with my feelings. Finally I had to admit to myself I was into guys way more than I was into girls.",
        "Ameera: You're very brave.",
        "Noah: Luke's one of the bravest people you'll ever meet.",
        "Luke: Well, I couldn't have done it without my Cousin Jade. She made me realize that I deserved to be happy. And once I came out to my parents, I felt like I could finally be me.",
        "Ameera: What about you, Noah? When did you first figure out how you felt?",
        "Noah: Luke was really the first guy I ever had those feelings for.",
        "Ameera: Did you like girls first?",

        "Will: How weird is it to see Sofie with my brother?",
        "Gwen: It was really weird.",
        "Will: I don't trust her.",
        "Gwen: I know you don't. I still feel sorry for her though.",
        "Will: She's not our problem anymore.",
        "Gwen: Will, it wouldn't have killed us to take the stuffed animal.",
        "Will: No, we need to start setting limits. She's caused enough trouble for us and I'm not going to let her mess up our lives anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: It must be nice to be eating here instead of waiting on tables.",
        "Sofie: I guess so.",
        "Chris: Well, thanks for coming. You know, I hate grabbing a bite in the doctor's lounge. It's not easy to go from being the boss to just another doctor.",
        "Sofie: You'll figure it out.",
        "Chris: Uh, yeah, it'll be a while before my dad trusts me again. Are you okay? I mean, you've barely touched your food.",
        "Sofie: I'm not really hungry. I'm sorry, I've had a pretty awful day. I just keep thinking about my baby.",
        "Chris: Give it some time.",
        "Sofie: I keep calling Hallie my baby. She's Gwen and Will's now. She'll never be mine again.",

        "Nurse: Ms. Ryan? Did you ask a family member to take you home?",
        "Barbara: I just wanted to stop in and see my son first.",
        "Nurse: The radiation gets more tiring as the treatments progress.",
        "Barbara: I know. Thank you.",
        "Paul: Hey. Where have you been?",
        "Barbara: Oh, I had an appointment I couldn't cancel. How are you feeling? You in a lot of pain?",
        "Paul: I've had worse. You just missed Will and Gwen. They brought Hallie by. It was kind of a celebration of custody.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry I missed them.",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm. Been a long day. Where did this come from?",
        "Paul: Sofie brought it.",
        "Barbara: Sofie? Sofie Duran? Hallie's birth mother?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Paul, how well do you know her?",
        "Paul: Not so well, we just started talking a few days ago.",
        "Barbara: Uh-huh. Has she said anything about me?",
        "Paul: Why, Mother? What have you done?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I've seen such a change in Henry since he met you. It's amazing how much he's grown up. He used to be totally irresponsible, but you've changed all that.",
        "Vienna: Well, he still gambles and sometimes he drinks way too much.",
        "Katie: True, he's not perfect, but he's trying. He's matured so much just because of how much he cares about you.",
        "Vienna: Not anymore.",
        "Katie: Yes, he does. He loves you, Vienna! He made a huge commitment to you. I mean, of course, it's not conventional, but it's trying for him, and he did it for you. You should be so proud he did all of this for you. You got to give Brad a chance.",
        "Vienna: You just said Brad.",
        "Katie: No, I didn't.",
        "Vienna: Yes, you did. Are you talking about my love life, or yours?",
        "Katie: I'm talking about you and Henry. You belong together.",
        "Vienna: What about you and Brad?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: I don't do business with strangers.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but you know, we're not strangers, we're poker buddies.",
        "Gray: I don't gamble with my work.",
        "Brad: Neither do I. Neither do I. I'm on television.",
        "Gray: A journalist?",
        "Brad: Well, I host a successful daytime talk show. You know what? We should have you on. We could do a segment on the lifestyles of the rich and famous.",
        "Gray: I'm not interested in that kind of publicity.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. Hey, but you know what, hey, if you change your mind, give me a call. I'm always up for another round of poker.",
        "Gray: Yeah. I'll keep it in mind.",

        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Gray: Tell Henry, better luck next time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I guess you could say I liked girls first, I mean, at least I thought I did. You know, eventually I realized that I was doing what my father wanted me to do, instead of what I wanted to do.",
        "Ameera: Did you ever have a girlfriend?",
        "Noah: There was this one girl, Maddie, who I really hurt. I'll always regret that, but I just couldn't -- I couldn't help the way I felt about Luke. If I had been more honest with myself, if I had just stood up to my father, things would have been different.",
        "Ameera: You respected your father. You weren't raised to go against him.",
        "Noah: I couldn't keep hiding who I was.",
        "Ameera: I wish I had been there, I could have made him understand.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm not sure it would have made a difference, but it would have been nice to have someone to talk to.",
        "Ameera: You have someone now.",

        "Katie: I wasn't talking about Brad.",
        "Brad: No wonder my ears were burning.",
        "Katie: We weren't talking about you. Vienna needs to make up her mind. Does she want a jet-set lifestyle, or does she want Henry?",
        "Brad: Gray Gerard is one slippery dude. I do not trust him, Vienna.",
        "Katie: Brad's not always the best judge of character, but I would listen to him this time.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you're right. I don't care about Gray. The only man I want is Henry. I can't lose him. Katie, you have to tell him to come back to me. He has to forgive me.",
        "Brad: That's not going to be easy.",
        "Katie: We will do whatever we can to get Henry to come around.",

        "Henry: We do?",
        "Katie: Yeah, your relationship with Vienna.",
        "Henry: There is no relationship. The relationship stopped when she kissed another man. I knew this was too good to last.",
        "Katie: No! No, no, no, no. You need to go home and make up with Vienna. She doesn't want to be with Gray.",
        "Henry: How do you know?",
        "Katie: As soon as you stormed off, she kicked him out. She only wants you.",

        "Barbara: Honey, it's just that Sofie and I don't really get along.",
        "Paul: Why'd you get so uptight when I said her name?",
        "Barbara: She tried to take your brother's baby away from him. I'll talk to her, I'll make sure she doesn't come in to see you.",
        "Paul: Don't do that, Mom, please. Stop butting into my life.",
        "Barbara: It's a hard habit to break. I'm your mother. I'm going to always protect you and your brother.",
        "Paul: Sofie is a friend, and right now, I could really use a friend. Besides, we're reading \"Treasure Island.\" I kind of want to find out how it ends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, you know it's going to be hard to avoid Sofie.",
        "Will: Yeah, I wish she'd go away. [Doorbell rings] Hey, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Hi. I missed your little party at the hospital, but I brought a present.",
        "Gwen: Oh, that's so nice, you didn't have to do that. Thank you.",
        "Barbara: I stopped by to see Paul. I hate seeing him in the hospital like this again. I wish there was something I could do for him.",
        "Will: He's a tough guy, Mom. He's going to bounce back. He's fine.",
        "Barbara: You're a good brother, Will. How's that little girl?",
        "Gwen: She's out. We had a really big day.",

        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Did Paul mention to you that Sofie has been hanging around the hospital?",
        "Will: Yeah, we saw her there.",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm. I don't like it.",
        "Will: I don't like it either, but it's hard to tell Paul what to do. You know, he's going to figure it out soon enough though.",
        "Barbara: I made a very late new year's resolution. I promise I will not interfere in my sons' lives anymore.",
        "Will: And how long do you think that's going to last?",
        "Barbara: As long as it has to.",

        "Barbara: I'm fine. Just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I was really lonely growing up. We moved around a lot, from Army base to Army base. I always wished I had a brother or a sister, you know, just someone my age.",
        "Luke: Look out!",
        "[Tires screech]",
        "Noah: Are you guys okay?",

        "Luke: Will this help?",
        "Noah: Front axle is broken. This car's not going anywhere. Better call for help.",
        "Luke: No signal.",
        "Noah: Me either.",

        "Sofie: Thank you for taking me out, and trying to cheer me up. I wish I had been better company.",
        "Chris: No, you were fine. I like spending time with you. Let's do it again soon.",
        "Sofie: That would be nice.",
        "Chris: I have to get back to work. My boss is tough and I don't want to upset him.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Do you use these moves on Gray?",
        "Vienna: No. These moves are only for you. Vienna Hyatt is otherwise engaged. Please, leave a message.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: I wonder if there's a gas station nearby.",
        "Luke: No. That way is a nature preserve. And this way it's just miles of woods, and then the lake. We'd freeze walking to a gas station. I guess we have to just wait here and hope that somebody comes by and helps us.",
        "Noah: We better get back in the truck to stay warm. What is it?",
        "Ameera: We have to sleep in the truck?",
        "Luke: Well, I know we have to rough it, but we don't really have a choice.",
