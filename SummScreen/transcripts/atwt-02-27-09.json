        "Carly berates Craig for not being there with their venders when she was forced to drink them under the table and answer their questions. Craig should have been there, and she wants him to fix things. She agrees to stay with Johnny so he can do that. Jade surprises Derek by asking for his help with Casey. He doesn't think he is worth it. She wants him to help her get any dirt on Matt that might help Casey. Craig is livid when Carly calls and tells him that not only is Lucy not in jail, but she is going to work at the hospital again. She is with Johnny right now. Meg is also defensive that Dusty would drop Lucy's charges and so willingly accept her back in Johnny's life. Craig tells Lucy that he will have something to say about this. He's silenced when Johnny asks if Lucy can come live with them. When Craig wants to take Johnny away to see the doctor, Johnny wants to stay with Lucy. Carly points out to Craig that he can't allow this to happen and have Johnny afraid of him. He needs to lighten up around Lucy. He can not stop Lucy from seeing Johnny. Johnny would end up hating him from keeping him from his sister. Alison runs into Casey at the police station and they have heated words. No matter what he may think, she says she believes him and is on his side. She knows he would not sell drugs. He thanks her just as Jade walks in to give him good news.",
        "Alison returns to Matt and tells him that she saw Casey and she believes both of them are innocent. However, Jade tells Casey that Matt did do drugs in prison, so now if they could prove the big leap that he is selling also. Matt assures Alison that he only took drugs a short while in prison, but he definitely is not using or selling drugs now. He needs her to believe that. But if he's not behind this, then somebody else is and she has no idea who that could be. Craig tells Carly that he will give Johnny enough love that he won't need anyone else. And it's too late for Craig to be a real father to Lucy. Carly advises that somehow he needs to find a way to forgive Lucy. Lucy too asks for a second chance with Craig. Dusty and Meg bump into each other at a movie and share popcorn. Afterwards they spot Lucy at the diner and Dusty thinks this is his chance to make things good with her. Craig laments to Carly that he is not sure he can forgive Lucy, but he can try. Carly is also impressed that Craig has already taken care of the venders. She says he is good, and he replies, \"I know.\""

        "Carly: Those people must've asked where you were like a hundred times! And they deserve an explanation for why you weren't there.",
        "Craig: Well, it wasn't intentional.",
        "Carly: I know that Lucy showed up and you had to deal with her. But I had to deal with our potential vendors and they were not happy.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm sure you bowled them over with your girlish charm.",
        "Carly: Not quite. Not only did they drink me under the table, they were asking questions that you should have been there to answer.",
        "Craig: Well, they're just going to have to wait a little while longer. I have someone else to deal with today.",
        "Carly: Lucy?",
        "Craig: No, no -- Lucy's exactly where she belongs. She's in jail.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Thank you for this. I appreciate it.",
        "Doctor: Mm-hmm.",
        "Meg: Lucy?",
        "Lucy: Hi. Oh, can I come find you later? Thanks.",
        "Meg: What are you doing here? Is Johnny okay? I hope he hasn't had a relapse or anything.",
        "Lucy: No, no, Johnny's fine as far as I know.",
        "Meg: I don't understand. I thought you'd left, went back into hiding. Does your father know you're here? Or Dusty?",
        "Lucy: Yes, yes, they both know that I'm back.",
        "Meg: Back? You're making it sound like you're going to stick around.",
        "Meg: Your job? You mean, here at the hospital?",
        "Lucy: Yes. Bob Hughes is considering having me reinstated. I'm sure it's more of a favor to my grandmother than anything --",
        "Meg: Lucy, Lucy, you're a fugitive. You're wanted for kidnapping.",
        "Lucy: No, not anymore. Oh, you know what, I have to go but I'll see you later. Thanks.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: She kidnapped my child. She broke the law, Carly.",
        "Carly: She didn't just break the law, did she? She broke your heart.",
        "Craig: Since when do you believe I even have one?",
        "Carly: Momentary lapse.",
        "Craig: She violated my trust. That's not something that can just be repaired.",
        "Carly: So, you're just going to ignore her?",
        "Craig: No. I'll deal with her when the D.A.'s office contacts me.",
        "Carly: So then why don't you have time to make nice with our vendors?",
        "Craig: I have to take Johnny to the doctor.",
        "Carly: Is he all right?",
        "Craig: No, he's fine, he's fine. It's a follow-up appointment, but Midnight Sun will just have to wait.",
        "Carly: Oh, no it won't.",
        "Craig: I beg your pardon?",
        "Carly: Hey. Last night was a colossal failure, Craig.",
        "Craig: So you keep telling me.",
        "Carly: And you have to fix it like you said you would.",
        "Craig: I'll get around to it.",
        "Carly: That's not good enough. Somebody has to talk to those vendors this morning. And that somebody is going to be you.",
        "Craig: And what about Johnny?",
        "Carly: I will take him to the doctor.",
        "Craig: You'd do that for me?",
        "Carly: I'm doing it for me. I am not going to lose this business because of you. Where is the kid, upstairs?",
        "Craig: Yes and he'll be so happy to see you. Just like his father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Derek: Jade. If you're looking for Bonnie, she just left. We were about to have breakfast, but she got a call from a client.",
        "Jade: I actually wasn't looking for her. I came to see you.",
        "Derek: Oh. Well, uh -- you hungry? There's still some food left.",
        "Jade: No I don't -- I don't want breakfast. I need your help.",
        "Derek: Since when? You gave me the distinct impression the other day that you didn't want me involved in your life.",
        "Jade: It's not for me. It's for a friend.",
        "Derek: A friend? If you're talking about Casey Hughes --",
        "Jade: Is that going to be a problem for you?",
        "Derek: What if it is?",
        "Jade: Too bad.",
        "Derek: Jade, whatever it is you're trying to do for this guy -- he's not worth it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey Casey, how are you doing? Can I get you anything?",
        "Casey: Was it me, or was that like, the world's fastest arraignment?",
        "Margo: Well, you were first up, and were arrested on drug charges. You know, you were on parole -- it wasn't very likely you were going to get bail.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Thanks, Mom.",
        "Margo: I'm just telling you the facts, Honey.",
        "Casey: Uh yes, the way you see them.",
        "Margo: Well, you haven't given me anything else to go on, have you?",
        "Casey: I told you the truth. Matt set me up -- the drugs were his. Why -- why don't you believe me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Hey, you. What's wrong?",
        "Alison: Nothing.",
        "Matt: Did I do something?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Matt: This is Casey, right?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I just -- I was up all night thinking about it. His arrest just doesn't make sense.",
        "Matt: But the drugs that they found on him were the same ones used to kill Reg.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know that, but I also know Casey. And when we were friends, we spent a lot of time together. And -- he never used drugs, Matt. He never even talked about them. I mean it's just -- it's just not who he is.",
        "Matt: Well, his mom seems to think otherwise.",
        "Alison: Margo's wrong.",
        "Matt: Ali -- you know Casey likes to party, right?",
        "Alison: He likes to drink beer, but that's not the same thing.",
        "Matt: So, what are you saying? Casey's telling the truth, so now I'm lying?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Matt: He's telling anyone who will listen that I'm dealing drugs and that I set him up. Do you believe him?",
        "Alison: Matt, I never said that. You're jumping to conclusions here.",
        "Matt: Am I?",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Matt: You know, I thought we had gotten closer. We were getting to know each other. I was happy about that.",
        "Alison: So am I, but -- something is just not right here. Not with us, with Casey. You know, I just -- I need to go talk to him.",
        "Matt: Well, nobody's stopping you. If that's what you want to do, go.",
        "Alison: I'll be back.",
        "Matt: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okay, Johnny, your room should be here somewhere --",
        "Johnny: Lulu!",
        "Lucy: Hi, Baby! How are you? Oh my God, you look so handsome and so big! Oh God, I missed you so much.",
        "Carly: Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Hi. What's Johnny doing here? Is he all right?",
        "Carly: Yeah, well I could ask you the same thing. I thought you were --",
        "Lucy: Carly, is he okay?",
        "Carly: Yes, yeah. He's just here for a checkup.",
        "Lucy: Good. I'd like to be here when he sees the doctor.",
        "Carly: I'm not sure that's a good idea.",
        "Lucy: Um, well, he's my brother and I'm going to be on staff here again, so.",
        "Carly: Okay, well I'll just need to check it with your father.",
        "Lucy: You do what you have to do. Hey come with me, Mister. I want to hear everything you've been doing. How's Leroy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Craig: Carly? Is everything okay?",
        "Carly: You know how you said that Lucy's in jail?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Carly: You were wrong. She's here at the hospital.",
        "Craig: What is she doing there?",
        "Carly: Apparently, she's getting her job back.",
        "Craig: Has Johnny seen her?",
        "Carly: He's with her right now.",
        "Craig: Don't let them out of your sight. I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Look, Casey and I -- I don't know what we are, okay, but I like him. He's a good guy.",
        "Derek: He just caught a bad break, huh?",
        "Jade: Yeah. And now everyone seems to be turning against him. I know what that's like -- it sucks. He just needs someone to believe in him.",
        "Derek: And that's you?",
        "Jade: Until I decide otherwise it is.",
        "Derek: What is it you want me to do?",
        "Jade: You remember that guy you saw me talking to at Yo's?",
        "Derek: Yeah, the one you were trying to score from? Yeah, I think I remember.",
        "Jade: His name is Matt O'Connor, and I wasn't trying to score anything.",
        "Derek: Then what were you doing?",
        "Jade: Casey thinks he's the guy that sold the drugs to Reg that killed him.",
        "Derek: Right.",
        "Jade: So I was just trying to see if he'd sell to me, so I could see if Casey was right.",
        "Derek: Oh, hey, that's smart. What if something happened to you?",
        "Jade: Well, nothing was going to happen. It might've worked, if you hadn't come in and ruined it.",
        "Derek: Oh, hey, sorry for busting up your little sting.",
        "Jade: Well, if you're really sorry, I have something you can do to make it up. I need you to help me find something on Matt.",
        "Derek: What?",
        "Jade: Whatever you can dig up.",
        "Derek: What makes you think I can do that?",
        "Jade: Because it's what you do. You helped me find Robby, didn't you?",
        "Derek: That was different.",
        "Jade: Fine. You don't want to help me? Don't.",
        "Derek: Jade. I never said I wouldn't help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Casey, you got a visitor.",
        "Casey: Forget it. I'm not interested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I can't believe you're letting her off the hook. After everything she put you through?",
        "Dusty: She wanted to be here with her family. Couldn't deny her that.",
        "Meg: Or Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Or Johnny.",
        "Meg: And if she knows she owes her freedom to you, she might be more open to giving you some time with Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Lucy's going to do what she's gotta do. I have no influence on her.",
        "Meg: Oh come on. You know that's not true. You were ready to disappear with her, so you could be with Johnny. She knows how much you love him.",
        "Dusty: Even if Craig allows Lucy to see Johnny, it doesn't mean she's going to do the same for me.",
        "Meg: Are you okay?",
        "Dusty: You know, I thought it was tough being separated from Johnny, not knowing where he was. But knowing he's here, and being cut off from seeing him --",
        "Meg: I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. Don't worry about me.",
        "Meg: I'm your friend. Worrying comes with the job.",
        "Dusty: Some job.",
        "Meg: Yeah, completely time-consuming. I'll let you get back to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Johnny, you know, we probably shouldn't keep the doctor waiting.",
        "Lucy: Dr. Morris will let us know when he's ready. Hey, do you remember our secret handshake? Yeah? Let's do it.",
        "Craig: Johnny --",
        "Johnny: Daddy, Lulu's here!",
        "Craig: I can see that.",
        "Lucy: He looks good.",
        "Craig: Johnny, I need to talk to your sister for a few minutes. Carly, would you mind taking --",
        "Carly: Oh yeah, of course. Hey Johnny, I saw some coloring books and crayons over here. Let's check them out, huh?",
        "Craig: Why aren't you in jail?",
        "Lucy: You mean, where you abandoned me?",
        "Craig: It's where you belong.",
        "Lucy: Well, they released me. Dusty had the charges dropped.",
        "Craig: Dusty? You made his life hell, too. Why would he forgive you for kidnapping Johnny?",
        "Lucy: Because he's not you. He wants to put this behind him, for Johnny's sake. Which is what I want too.",
        "Craig: I knew it. I knew you two were working together. Ever since he helped you skip town before.",
        "Lucy: I am not working with Dusty. I came back on my own, willingly, to try to make things right.",
        "Craig: Well it's too late for that. And if the police won't enforce the law, I'll do it myself.",
        "Lucy: What do you mean?",
        "Craig: I'll get a restraining order against you. You won't be able to get within fifty yards of Johnny.",
        "Lucy: You can't do that to me!",
        "Craig: Watch me.",
        "Johnny: Daddy, can Lulu come and live with us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Look, I know you feel like I'm not on your side.",
        "Casey: Yeah, because you're not.",
        "Alison: That's not fair, Casey. Okay, everything has just happened so fast.",
        "Casey: Yeah -- like how I became a drug lord overnight.",
        "Alison: Stop it, Casey. There were just so many accusations and the way you attacked Matt.",
        "Casey: I wanted people to see him for who he really is!",
        "Alison: Right. But that didn't work, now did it? And it only made things worse for you.",
        "Casey: Oh come -- like you even care.",
        "Alison: I know we said a lot of things that we didn't mean the other day.",
        "Casey: No, I didn't. I said I was innocent.",
        "Alison: I know you did.",
        "Casey: And by the way, me being in here means Matt's in the clear. Which works out well for you, doesn't it?",
        "Alison: Stop it, Casey.",
        "Casey: How the hell could you think that I was dealing drugs?",
        "Alison: I don't think that at all. I don't think anything, I know. I know you don't use drugs. And I know that you would never sell drugs to anyone.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "Casey: What about all the evidence?",
        "Alison: I don't care about the evidence. I care about -- I'm on your side. Okay, no matter what you may think. I just wanted you to know that.",
        "Casey: So, you're saying you believe me?",
        "Alison: Yes. I believe you, Casey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Aw, I should have known. Are you going to behave?",
        "Meg: I'll try.",
        "Dusty: All right, then, keep your popcorn to yourself.",
        "Meg: What are you doing here in the middle of the day?",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to take a break from life. I didn't know you'd be here.",
        "Meg: Are you sure you didn't follow me?",
        "Dusty: No. I'm aware that you need space, I'm trying to respect that.",
        "Meg: Well, so far, so good.",
        "Dusty: I can go to another movie, if you want.",
        "Meg: That's a little extreme, don't you think?",
        "Dusty: I'm an extreme kind of guy.",
        "Meg: That's an understatement. Do you have butter on yours?",
        "Dusty: Salt.",
        "Meg: Perfect. Okay, great. Now we can mix and match. But don't ask to have any of my soda.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Johnny, I know that you want Lulu to come live with us.",
        "Johnny: Can she?",
        "Craig: I think she's already made other arrangements.",
        "Lucy: It's all right, it's all right Johnny.",
        "Craig: Well come on, Johnny we can't keep the doctor waiting, now can we? It's time to go. Johnny, come on, it's time to go now. Johnny, now.",
        "Johnny: I want to stay with Lulu!",
        "Craig: I said now, Johnny, come on.",
        "Lucy: Hey stop, you're scaring him.",
        "Craig: Well he was fine before you got here. You're confusing him.",
        "Lucy: Johnny, its okay. Daddy just wants to take you to see the doctor, to make sure you're okay, okay? I know you don't want to go.",
        "Craig: Lucy, I'm warning you.",
        "Lucy: Warnings are not the way to handle this.",
        "Craig: Don't tell me how to handle my son.",
        "Carly: Craig?",
        "Craig: Lucy, I swear to you if you don't just walk away right now, I'll make sure that you never see him again.",
        "Carly: Hey, Craig! Excuse us. What are you thinking?",
        "Craig: She stole him once. How do I know she won't do it again?",
        "Carly: You know what I'm more concerned about? Your son is scared to death of you right now. Don't you see that?",
        "Craig: I don't mean to scare him. It's just -- when I saw her with him, all I could think about was all the time he was gone. You know, she never even got word to me that he was all right. She just disappeared with him and that was the end of it. Now how am I supposed to forget that?",
        "Carly: Craig, she did not come here looking for him, okay? We ran into her.",
        "Craig: You think this is all just a coincidence?",
        "Carly: Yes. Yes it is. Listen to me. You've seen what it does to Johnny when he sees you fighting with Dusty. Now getting into it with Lucy is even worse. If you don't want to lose him, Craig, you can't let this happen again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Are you thinking about Lucy?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Meg: You okay?",
        "Dusty: Define okay.",
        "Meg: Okay, you got me. It's not like my life's been perfect order these days.",
        "Dusty: Paul giving you more hell?",
        "Meg: We're not talking about me and Paul, we're talking about you and Lucy. So, you've been thinking about Lucy, and?",
        "Dusty: And -- I ended up here.",
        "Meg: I don't see the connection.",
        "Dusty: Lucy and I used to watch movies in the middle of the day.",
        "Meg: I didn't know that?",
        "Dusty: Just an escape. Now and then, you know?",
        "Meg: Then things got complicated -- like now. Can I ask you something? Are you still angry at Lucy for what she did?",
        "Dusty: Taking off with Johnny with zero contact? I think I should be, don't you?",
        "Meg: I don't think anybody would blame you. You know, she did put you through the wringer for almost two years. When Paul had Eliza, it only took two days to put me over the edge. I don't know how you did it.",
        "Dusty: I figured out something.",
        "Meg: What's that?",
        "Dusty: It takes a lot of energy to be angry at somebody all the time, you know.",
        "Meg: Yeah, it does.",
        "Dusty: Sometimes I think I'm past it. Other times --",
        "Meg: It's hard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Okay, Mister. I got to get going, and you have a doctor's appointment that Daddy's waiting to take you to. So -- you go with Daddy, and I will see you later. I promise.",
        "Carly: Does that sound okay to you, Johnny?",
        "Lucy: Be good.",
        "Doctor: Mr. Montgomery -- you and Johnny ready?",
        "Craig: Yes we are, Doctor.",
        "Doctor: Excellent. Let's go, Johnny.",
        "Craig: Go ahead, Johnny. I'll be right along.",
        "Carly: Have you calmed down, I hope?",
        "Craig: Not a chance. And what was that? She'll see him later?",
        "Carly: Well, she will. And you will let her, because it's what best for Johnny.",
        "Craig: I do not need to be told what's best for my son.",
        "Carly: I'm not sure about that. The way you were acting just now, I think you might.",
        "Craig: I don't want her near him!",
        "Carly: You keep saying that. But you know something? You can't stop it.",
        "Craig: Excuse me?",
        "Carly: Craig, did you fail to notice how happy Johnny was to see Lucy again?",
        "Craig: He'll get over it.",
        "Carly: Maybe. Or maybe he'll grow up hating you for keeping him from his sister. Is that what you want?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Carly: Then you have to stop this. You know that Lucy would never do anything to hurt him.",
        "Craig: Well I'm not about to take that chance. And if Lucy thinks she can just come back in, and walk back into Johnny's life, she was wrong.",

        "Casey: Hey. You coming here today, telling me you believe me, it -- it means a lot.",
        "Alison: I had to, Casey.",
        "Casey: No, you didn't. I was pretty much -- a real jerk the other day, and --",
        "Alison: So? That's when I knew you still thought of me as a friend.",
        "Casey: It's pretty wrong that that makes me feel better.",
        "Alison: Yeah, tell me about it.",
        "Casey: So, what do we do about Matt?",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Casey: Well, I mean, if you believe I'm innocent -- where does that leave Matt? After all, he was the one that planted the drugs on me.",
        "Alison: Casey, you don't know that.",
        "Casey: You don't think it's him?",
        "Alison: Why do I have to choose between the two of you? Why can't I just believe that you're both innocent?",
        "Derek: Lt. Hughes?",
        "Margo: Ah. This day keeps getting better and better, it's not even noon yet.",
        "Jade: It's about to be your best day ever. And you're welcome.",
        "Margo: Excuse me?",
        "Derek: What Jade is trying to say is, we might have some information for you.",
        "Margo: Information?",
        "Jade: That could clear Casey.",
        "Derek: Come on Jade, let's not get ahead of ourselves, now.",
        "Jade: It's about Matt O'Connor.",
        "Margo: What about Matt O'Connor?",
        "Jade: Look, can you fill Margo in? I'd kind of like to tell Casey myself. May I see him?",
        "Margo: Uh, yeah go ahead. He's in the interrogation room.",
        "Casey: Jade?",
        "Jade: I, uh, have some good news for you.",
        "Casey: Uh, what is it?",
        "Jade: It's kind of private.",
        "Alison: That's no problem. I was leaving anyway.",
        "Casey: Wait, wait -- Ali--",
        "Alison: No, Casey, it's okay.",
        "Casey: I -- I just wanted -- I just wanted to say thanks.",
        "Alison: You're welcome.",
        "Jade: What are you thanking her for?",
        "Casey: Nothing. What's the news?",
        "Jade: Well I had my -- Derek do some digging on Matt.",
        "Casey: Did he find anything?",
        "Jade: Yeah. Turns out, when Matt was in prison, he was using.",
        "Casey: He was? Are you sure?",
        "Jade: Yeah. Now, if we could only prove he was selling, that would go a long way towards backing up your claim.",
        "Casey: That -- that he's the dealer we've been looking for. And he's the one who set me up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: You came back.",
        "Alison: I said I would.",
        "Matt: Did you see Casey?",
        "Alison: Yes. We talked.",
        "Matt: And?",
        "Alison: I told him I believed he wasn't dealing.",
        "Matt: I see.",
        "Alison: But I also don't believe what he said about you, either.",
        "Matt: Did you tell him that, too?",
        "Alison: Yes, I did. But even so, I just -- I felt like he needed to know that I don't think he's guilty.",
        "Matt: Did you ever think maybe you're just believing what you want to believe cause you still have feelings for him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What did the doctor say?",
        "Craig: Johnny's golden. The transplant was a complete success.",
        "Carly: Oh, that's great news.",
        "Craig: Yes, it is.",
        "Carly: So, are you still mad at me?",
        "Craig: No. You were just trying to keep me from losing my temper.",
        "Carly: You didn't make it easy.",
        "Craig: What would be the fun in that? Besides, you were right. The last person I want to alienate is my own son.",
        "Carly: Or your daughter. Craig.",
        "Craig: Carly, no matter what you say, it won't change what she did to me. It was the ultimate betrayal. Now how am I supposed to forget that happened?",
        "Carly: Lucy just wants a chance to be part of your life again.",
        "Craig: No, she wants to be in Johnny's life. She didn't come back here for me.",
        "Carly: Well that may be true, but she's not going to try to take him away again. It's just not going to happen.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm not about to take that chance.",
        "Carly: Johnny loves her, you know? Think about it -- she's pretty much the only mother he's ever known. You can't change that, Craig. And if you try, Johnny will be the one to pay for it.",
        "Craig: Then I'll just make sure that he doesn't. I'll make sure that he feels enough love that he won't need anyone else.",
        "Carly: Craig. There's no such thing as too much love, and you know that. And I don't think you'd still be so mad at Lucy if you didn't love her too. Just as much as you do Johnny.",
        "Craig: Now, just spare me the psychoanalysis.",
        "Carly: She's still your daughter. She always will be.",
        "Craig: The little girl I loved disappeared a long time ago.",
        "Carly: You're never too old to need parents. Maybe part of the reason that Lucy came back is that she realized that she still wants her father.",
        "Craig: It's too late.",
        "Carly: That's up to you. But think about something for me, will you? How many times have you asked for a second chance? Or begged someone you love to believe you changed?",
        "Craig: What's your point?",
        "Carly: You have to try, Craig. You have to find some way to forgive your daughter.",
        "(Door bell rings)",
        "Craig: Hey, big guy. You all set?",
        "Johnny: Where's Lulu?",
        "Craig: Oh, uh -- she had to be somewhere. But that's okay, because today you're getting your favorite lunch. Let's go. Bye.",
        "Lucy: I was hoping I could see Johnny again before I left.",
        "Carly: Um, well, your dad took him out of here pretty quickly.",
        "Lucy: I'm not surprised.",
        "Carly: It's going to take time.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, time and maybe a small miracle. I know he doesn't want me in his life anymore. He made that clear when he had me turned in to the police.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: It's not your fault.",
        "Carly: I believe that your father loves you. He just feels betrayed and hurt, and when he feels like that, his way of dealing with it is to --",
        "Lucy: Lash out? Yeah, I know. I'm familiar with the way my father operates.",
        "Carly: Right. I suppose you are.",
        "Lucy: It's just funny, you know? I mean, the way he feels now is the way I felt so many times growing up. It's part of the reason I took Johnny away in the first place.",
        "Carly: Because you didn't want Johnny to feel that way growing up?",
        "Lucy: For all the good it's done -- I mean, he's exactly where he started.",
        "Carly: No, no. Craig's changed. He really wants to be a good father to Johnny.",
        "Lucy: I just -- I wish he could see that Johnny's not the only one who needs a dad.",
        "Carly: You really miss him.",
        "Lucy: No one's more surprised than I am. But when I told him that I wanted a family again -- I meant it.",
        "Carly: I hope that happens for you. I really do. Lucy, if you want your father to trust you again, you're going to have to earn it.",
        "Lucy: I know, I understand. I will, I'll try.",
        "Carly: Good. And listen, he -- he really is devoted to Johnny, and you need to respect that.",
        "Lucy: I do, I respect it. I see it when I look at Johnny. And I would never do anything to take away from his happiness.",
        "Carly: And I would never do anything to take away from your father's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Just because I believe Casey's innocent, that doesn't mean I want to be with him.",
        "Matt: But you have feelings for him, don't you?",
        "Alison: Yes -- as a friend. And I'm getting tired of having to say that.",
        "Matt: Well, how do you feel about me? Am I just a friend, too?",
        "Margo: Oh, excuse me.",
        "Matt: Mrs. Hughes?",
        "Margo: Lt. Hughes.",
        "Matt: So, this is an official visit?",
        "Alison: What's going on?",
        "Margo: I just found out something that doesn't make me real happy.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Margo: I think Matt knows.",
        "Matt: No, I don't.",
        "Margo: No? Remember when you went to prison for helping Nevins terrorize my family, and you gave me your word that you were going to turn your life around?",
        "Matt: I know, and I meant it. I still do.",
        "Margo: Yeah, did you really think drugs was the way to do that?",
        "Alison: What is she talking about?",
        "Margo: Oh yeah, Matt's had quite the social life behind bars.",
        "Matt: If you're expecting me to deny this, then --",
        "Margo: No? Why, afraid you'll incriminate yourself?",
        "Matt: All that I care about is that you know that I'm not using now. You could even test me, if you want.",
        "Margo: Oh, I just might take you up on that.",
        "Matt: And I'm not a dealer, Lieutenant. I never have been and I never will be.",
        "Margo: Good. For your sake, I hope that's true. Now it might be my son that's facing charges, but this case is far from open and shut. I've got my eye on you.",
        "Alison: You -- you told me you weren't into drugs. How could you lie to me like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: As angry as I may be, I can't put all the blame on her. I got to take responsibility for my end.",
        "Meg: How are you to blame?",
        "Dusty: Craig and I were at each other's throats over Johnny. She took him away for his own protection.",
        "Meg: Yeah, but the way she went about doing it.",
        "Dusty: It was totally wrong. I know. She knows it, too.",
        "Meg: But.",
        "Dusty: I don't know if I can make peace with it. She certainly loves Johnny.",
        "Meg: Almost as much as you do.",
        "Dusty: She gave up her career for his health and happiness. This isn't working.",
        "Meg: What isn't?",
        "Dusty: My great escape from reality.",
        "Meg: Okay. Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on.",

        "Craig: I thought I made it clear that you're not welcome here.",
        "Lucy: Yes, you did.",
        "Craig: So you're choosing to ignore my wishes?",
        "Lucy: What can I say? I am my father's daughter.",
        "Craig: If you're aiming for humor, you're aiming too high.",
        "Lucy: No, please wait. May I come in?",
        "Craig: No. I just put Johnny down for a nap.",
        "Lucy: I didn't come here to see him, I'm here to talk to you.",
        "Craig: We're talking now.",
        "Lucy: You really want to have this conversation right out here in the hallway?",
        "Craig: Whatever you have to say, say it quickly and quietly.",
        "Lucy: I didn't come back here to take Johnny away again.",
        "Craig: Go on.",
        "Lucy: So, you can shun me as much as you feel I deserve. But it won't scare me off. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Craig: Is that all?",
        "Lucy: No. Please, I'm -- I'm asking you. Don't keep Johnny from spending time with me. He knows I'm here, he's just going to be asking for me.",
        "Craig: Well whose fault is that?",
        "Lucy: I didn't know I was going to run into him today. You'll only be hurting him this way. I know that's not what you want.",
        "Craig: Hmm. That's funny, that's what Carly said.",
        "Lucy: Carly's very protective of you. She must care about you too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Did you arrest Matt? Did he give you the story? Did he admit that he set me up?",
        "Margo: Just slow down, that's not how it works.",
        "Casey: You didn't arrest him?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Casey: Mom, he was using drugs in jail -- which probably means he was dealing them.",
        "Margo: Oh, do we have to go over this? There's nothing we can prove yet.",
        "Casey: That didn't stop you from arresting me. Maybe it's because you think I belong here, right?",
        "Margo: Oh, that is not true!",
        "Casey: Really? You let Luke go, you let Noah go, you let Matt go. The only one you didn't let go was me. The screw-up.",
        "Margo: Fine, fine. You're a little upset right now, okay.",
        "Casey: I've been upset for a long time, Mom. Thanks for finally noticing.",
        "Jade: That was -- that was intense.",
        "Casey: Yeah, whatever.",
        "Jade: I really thought what we found would help you.",
        "Casey: No, you did good and I appreciate it. It's more than my mom's ever done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: What do you want me to say, Alison?",
        "Alison: I don't know, Matt. Why don't you tell the truth?",
        "Matt: I was telling the truth. I'm not into drugs, I'm not using, I'm not dealing.",
        "Alison: Then, what about what Margo said? About your time in prison?",
        "Matt: Okay for a little while, during a very dark time in my life, I took whatever I could get my hands on to make me go numb. I was locked up, I was scared, I was alone. And if I got through that by occasionally getting high, then --",
        "Alison: Why didn't you tell me about this?",
        "Matt: Hell, I don't know, maybe because I was ashamed? I can't believe you're coming down on me for this. I thought you'd understand.",
        "Alison: Why? Because I've gotten high? The only difference is, Matt, I didn't lie to you about it.",
        "Matt: A guy died. A friend of yours. Do you really think that if I was the one responsible, that I could look you in the eye? Or kiss you? Or want to make love to you? You could believe that Casey's innocent all you want. But I need you to believe me, too.",
        "Alison: I do.",
        "Matt: You do?",
        "Alison: Yes. Of course. You are -- or you were Casey's friend, just like me. So if you say you didn't have anything to do with setting him up, or selling those drugs to Reg, I believe you.",
        "Matt: Thank you.",
        "Alison: The thing is, Matt -- if you're not the one who's behind this, then someone else is. And I have no idea who it could be.",

        "Meg: So you're still hungry?",
        "Dusty: Popcorn doesn't cut it, you know.",
        "Meg: But you ate yours and mine.",
        "Dusty: You telling me you need to watch it?",
        "Meg: Well, you know, you're not as young as you used to be.",
        "Dusty: Maybe this is a sign I should talk to her.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Maybe you should. Go ahead.",
        "Dusty: You don't mind?",
        "Meg: No. I understand. It was nice running into you.",
        "Dusty: You too. Hey.",
        "Lucy: Hi.",
        "Dusty: I hear you're getting your job back at Memorial.",
        "Lucy: Fingers crossed.",
        "Dusty: Your father know?",
        "Lucy: Yes. And he's not happy about it.",
        "Dusty: I wouldn't think so.",
        "Lucy: I need him to trust me again, Dusty. I need him to know that I'm not going to run away with Johnny again.",
        "Dusty: Won't be easy.",

        "Craig: I want to know what you said to her.",
        "Carly: Why does that matter?",
        "Craig: Because she suggested that you said some nice things about me. That you might even care about me.",
        "Carly: She must have misunderstood.",
        "Craig: Ah, that's what I thought.",
        "Carly: You feel better now?",
        "Craig: Well, I was concerned. I thought you, saying that you cared about me -- you know, you could have fallen and hit your head or something.",
        "Carly: Well, I didn't. I'm fine, so.",
        "Craig: Okay, good.",
        "Carly: You can go.",
