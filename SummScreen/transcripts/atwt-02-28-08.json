        "Lily: Hi, want some coffee?",
        "Holden: Please.",
        "Lily: You okay? You were tossing and turning all night.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry -- hope I didn't keep you up.",
        "Lily: Actually, it was nice having you close to me again.",
        "Holden: But you're not ready for any more, are you?",
        "Lily: I just need a little more time. Is that a problem?",
        "Holden: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Lily: Where is everybody? It's quiet. Right?",
        "Holden: Luke, Noah and Ameera must have gotten an early start.",
        "Lily: It's so great. You know, those boys being so nice to her and welcoming her here. What? What is that?",
        "Holden: It's a note from Luke. The kids went to Statesville to visit Noah's dad.",
        "Lily: When?",
        "Holden: I guess yesterday.",
        "Lily: Luke did not sleep in his bed last night.",
        "Holden: Noah's truck is gone.",
        "Lily: They should have been back by now. Where are they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I don't hear any furniture flying. Oh, I hope Vienna and Henry are kissing and making up.",
        "Brad: Well, I bet they're doing a lot more than kissing. You know, they say that making love is the best medicine. Wow, I feel really hot. I think I need some sexual healing.",
        "Katie: Oh my God, I am not going to play doctor with you. Let's go.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh my God. You're an amazing lover, Henry.",
        "Henry: You're pretty incredible yourself. [Cell phone ringing] Ignore that.",
        "Vienna: No, what if it's important? What if it's about the diner?",
        "Henry: Oh, come on. Yes?",
        "Kit: Where's my money?",
        "Henry: I, uh -- you'll get it.",
        "Kit: When?",
        "Vienna: Who is that?",
        "Henry: It's just business, Sweetheart. Meet me at Metro at noon.",
        "Vienna: What is going on? What are you up to? Who was that on the phone? Don't lie to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We've got our work cut out for us if we're going to get Kit to confess before she leaves town.",
        "Carly: Hey, Parker you have to get to school, Honey. Did you finish your breakfast?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Do I have to go?",
        "Jack: Yes, you do. You've missed too many days already.",
        "Carly: And don't you have a history test today.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well it doesn't matter if I go to jail.",
        "Carly: We're not going to let that happen. Everything's going to be fine.",
        "Parker: How do you know? Did you figure out a way to prove that I didn't kill Sam?",
        "Jack: We're working on it.",
        "Carly: And we have everything under control. All right? You just concentrate on school.",
        "Jack: You don't want to miss the bus.",
        "Parker: Okay. See ya.",
        "Carly: Have a good day, Sweetheart. Bye. We need to find some proof that he didn't kill Sam.",
        "Jack: It's not going to be easy. If Kit takes the cash for Metro, she's going to leave town. And if she doesn't, she'll still going to leave town. Either way, Parker's looking at jail time.",
        "Carly: We have to get the money, Jack. We have to at least give Henry a chance to get a confession out of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Are you seeing another woman?",
        "Henry: Liebchen, you're all the woman I need.",
        "Vienna: What is going on?",
        "Henry: The truth is -- I'm going to do a very good deed. But first I have to go to Metro and deliver $250 grand, okay?",
        "Vienna: Are you gambling again? Was that your bookie?",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no -- don't worry about it at all. When all this said and done, you'll be so proud of me. Okay. Wish me luck, will you?",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Vienna: Did you change your mind? Oh, these must have cost a fortune. But there -- there's a mistake. They're not mine.",
        "Bellhop: Are you Vienna Hyatt?",
        "Vienna: Yes.",
        "Bellhop: Enjoy.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry is not going to like this.",

        "Henry: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Henry: Let's -- let's get this show on the road, shall we? Kit is losing patience fast.",
        "Carly: Okay. Jack just went to get the cash.",
        "Henry: You don't have the money yet? Carly, you know, Kit is a cold-blooded killer. I am directly in the line of her sights.",
        "Carly: Jack won't let us down. He knows where to get the money. He'll come through, Henry, don't worry.",
        "Jack: Hey, I really hate doing this, I need more money. Kit is on the verge of confessing and Henry needs more cash to seal the deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You got it. How much you need?",
        "Jack: $250,000.",
        "Brad: Whoa.",
        "Jack: Come on.",
        "Brad: Jack, I'm sorry. I don't have that much. I already gave Henry the down payment. You know I wish I could help. I'd do anything for Parker.",
        "Jack: Okay, I understand.",
        "Katie: So would I. Call Henry, and tell him I'll get the money.",
        "Jack: No. No, Katie -- no way. Katie, I can't let you do that.",
        "Katie: You won't take the money from me, but you would take if from him?",
        "Jack: He's my brother!",
        "Katie: And I'm your -- why does it matter where the money comes from as long as it helps Parker? I'll give it back when Kit gets arrested. Besides, she would have already confessed if it wasn't for me screwing things up.",
        "Jack: That's not your fault. Listen, I should've turned my phone off.",
        "Katie: Well, whatever, I still want a chance to make up for it. Please, let me do this for Parker.",
        "Jack: You don't have to.",
        "Katie: I want to. I love him. I don't want to see this happen to him.",
        "Jack: I don't know what to say.",
        "Katie: Say you'll take the money. Come on. We're friends, right? Friends help each other out.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'll take the money, but I swear you are getting back every cent of it, after we arrest Kit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Well, Jack better hurry up because Kit sounded like she was getting itchy feet.",
        "Carly: He's working on it, Henry. It takes time to get together that much cash.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on, Carly. I've won and lost more than that in a poker game.",
        "Carly: Maybe you could get the money that way.",
        "Henry: No, no, sorry, Sweetheart. I gave up gambling for Vienna. And I'm not doing anything to jeopardize our relationship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Vienna reading]",
        "Vienna: \"You are beautiful right down to your toes. Every inch of you deserves the best. Gray.\" No. No, no, I can't. Darlings, you were my first love. But I have a new man in my life now, and I have to be faithful. So, as much as I've missed you, and make no mistake, I've missed you, we have to say goodbye. Gray can keep his gifts and his money. On second thought --",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Gray: Well, I was hoping you'd call. How do you like your gift?",
        "Vienna: Oh, it was a lovely gesture, but far too extravagant. I'm afraid I cannot accept. I'm on my way back to Fashions to return them right now.",
        "Gray: Sorry to hear that.",
        "Vienna: Well, thanks anyway. Tah-tah. That ought to work.",
        "Gray: Check, please?",
        "Vienna: This should seal the deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Luke, are you awake?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Noah: Why didn't you wake me?",
        "Luke: Because you looked so comfortable with Ameera. Old habits die hard, right?",
        "Noah: I swear, I didn't --",
        "Luke: Hey, hey, hey -- relax. We had to keep warm, right?",
        "Ameera: What's going on? Did you find help?",
        "Noah: No, not yet.",
        "Luke: This road is pretty deserted at night. Now that the sun's up, maybe it'll get some more traffic.",
        "Noah: You know, we should get going. Let's start hitchhiking to town or something.",
        "Ameera: Wait, I hear something.",
        "Noah: Someone's coming. Hey -- slow down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Are you sure? Thanks. Noah had an appointment to see his father, but he never showed up.",
        "Lily: I just tried Luke and Noah's cell phones, and they went right to voice mail. Where are they?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Jerks!",
        "Grant: What did you say?",
        "Chad: He's a loser.",
        "Grant: I think you guys owe us an apology.",
        "Noah: Not a chance.",
        "Luke: Give it a rest. It's not worth it.",
        "Ameera: Are you all right?",
        "Grant: Look at that.",
        "Chad: Where are you from, Sweetheart?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: They're not at Memorial, or any hospital from here to Statesville. What did Dallas say?",
        "Holden: He hasn't heard anything.",
        "Lily: Luke, there's no way he would stay out all night without asking for permission. Something is wrong, I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: I'm from Iraq.",
        "Grant: Wonder how many of her relatives have killed Americans.",
        "Noah: Guys, leave her alone.",
        "Chad: We're a lot more civilized here. Come on, we'll give you a ride back to town.",
        "Grant: Sorry, no room for you guys.",
        "Noah: Hey, she's not going anywhere with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you have a problem with Katie helping me?",
        "Brad: You mean helping Parker? No, it's just the kind of thing Katie would do. I think it's great.",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: What's going on? Did you get the money?",
        "Jack: It's on its way.",
        "Carly: Brad, thank you so much. You really came through. We owe you.",
        "Brad: No, I --",
        "Jack: Brad wanted to help, but he doesn't have the money.",
        "Carly: Well, then where did you get it?",
        "Katie: From me.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Absolutely not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Gray, what a surprise. I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Gray: Allow me. You sure you can't keep the gifts? Beautiful shoes belong on a beautiful woman.",
        "Vienna: I agree, so I kept a pair. But I can't accept the rest. It wouldn't be right.",
        "Gray: I'm not asking for anything in return. Just the pleasure of knowing that I made you happy.",
        "Vienna: Please, credit these to Mr. Gerard's account.",
        "Gray: Well, there must be something that I can give you to remember me by.",
        "Vienna: Honestly? There's only one thing I want.",
        "Gray: Name it.",
        "Vienna: $250,000, before noon, in cash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Katie, I am very sorry for all the trouble you went to. We are not taking your money.",
        "Katie: Why not? If Henry shows up empty-handed, Kit's going to leave town.",
        "Jack: Katie's right. It's our only option.",
        "Carly: We'll find another way.",
        "Jack: Carly, I don't want to take Katie's money, either. But the alternative is telling our son that he's going to spending the next 20 years in prison.",
        "Katie: Really, Carly, I'm just trying to help.",
        "Carly: Thank you. We'll take your money. What's the plan, Jack?",
        "Jack: I'm still working on it.",
        "Henry: You're what? The clock is ticking. You don't have a plan, yet? Kit expects to see me within the hour. What am I going to do?",
        "Jack: We'll think of something, Henry.",
        "Henry: Famous last words. Let's hope they aren't mine.",
        "Brad: Hey, hey, hey, I just restocked that after the last pig-out session.",
        "Henry: This could be my last meal. Kit's going to hunt me down like a dog.",
        "Brad: So, what happened with you and Vienna last night? Did you get lucky?",
        "Henry: Vienna sure did. I have to say, I surprise myself. I'm an animal, Brad.",
        "Katie: What are you guys talking about?",
        "Brad: Henry just gave me a great idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: $250 grand -- just like you asked for.",
        "Vienna: Oh, this amount of money used to be pocket change for me.",
        "Gray: Yeah, it can be again. I'm a man of my word. The money comes with no strings.",
        "Vienna: Good. Otherwise I might not be able to accept it.",
        "Gray: And that would be a shame because I really enjoy making you smile. Maybe one day you'll appreciate my generosity.",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I got a plan. I have a plan.",
        "Jack: Let's hear it.",
        "Brad: Okay. Henry's going to seduce Kit. And then we're going to nail her for killing Sam.",
        "Henry: I'm going to nail the who? What?",
        "Brad: Look, listen, all you have to do is pour on the charm. And she'll be putty in your hands.",
        "Henry: No, no, my hands, and the rest of my other body parts, are reserved for Vienna.",
        "Katie: No, no, you can do this, Henry. Just sweep her off her feet, get her spilling her secrets, before anything goes too far.",
        "Jack: Okay, we've got to move on this though. Are you in or what?",
        "Henry: Let the record state that against my better judgment, I will do it.",
        "Katie: Yes!",
        "Jack: Okay, thank you. Yeah, but just so you know, you're going to need to wear a wire again.",
        "Henry: What if things get physical, and Kit cops a feel?",
        "Jack: Make sure she doesn't. But, listen, I'm off the force now. So I can't use any of the surveillance equipment. Can you guys help me out?",
        "Katie: Oh, we have hidden mics and recorders for undercover segments.",
        "Brad: I'll show you. Come on, come on, come on.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Carly: You didn't have to do this, Katie.",
        "Katie: I did it for Parker.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: All right. Let's go.",
        "Katie: Good luck.",
        "Henry: I'm going to need it.",

        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, right here.",
        "Kit: Okay. I can't wait to get my hands on all that green. Where do I sign?",

        "Kit: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: I mean, you're like no other woman I've ever met. Your eyes are so deep, and lovely. I can see that you're hurting, and yet you're so strong.",
        "Kit: It ain't been easy. Since I lost my Sam I can't eat. I can't sleep --",
        "Henry: Tell me about it.",
        "Kit: Every time I close my eyes, I think about the way that Sam died. It's horrible. I blame myself.",

        "Brad: Henry, you didn't do anything wrong. She'll see that and beg you to take her back.",

        "Brad: Not a chance. I mean, look how far she'd go for you. It couldn't have been easy trying to pull together $250 grand.",
        "Henry: No, you're right, it couldn't be easy. It'd be impossible. Because we don't have that kind of money. I know exactly who does -- Gray Gerard.",

        "Henry: No Brad, she promised me she wouldn't take anything from that guy.",

        "Henry: A chick says sexy I'm just going to turn this off.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. Don't, don't look at it. Don't touch it. Just don't move. I'll move for both of us.",

        "Vienna: Yes, I did. I not only slept with Gray, we made love.",
