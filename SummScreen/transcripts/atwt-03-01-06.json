        "Will gives Gwen a plastic ring as an engagement ring, as they try to put their heads together to find a way they can get married without them being 18. Nancy interrupts Casey and Maddie having some alone time on the couch in Katie's house. Later they bump into Will and Gwen trying to figure out how to get married, and the ever romantic Maddie pleads for Casey to talk to his dad, claiming he has a school project, and find out if there are ways around getting married before you are 18. At first Casey turns them down, but then asks his dad the questions and gets the information he needs. He relays the information to Will, Gwen and Maddie about a judge in Chicago that could help them out. Since Will and Gwen don't have a car, Casey offers to give them a ride. The four of them are off on a mini road trip it seems. Emily goes to see Paul in the hospital, and he wonders if she is there to finish the job? They finally talk about what happened the night he called off the wedding. Emily hopes to try their relationship again, but Paul thinks there is too much water under the bridge to go back. Emily accuses him of being in love with Meg, but Paul covers saying she helped him only for the money. When Jess comes to take Paul's statement, Paul covers for Emily as well as Meg. Jen grows increasingly worried when she can't find Dusty. Hal finds a cane covered in blood, and it isn't Paul's. Hal learns Dusty's car has been sitting at the Wagon Wheel motel for a day now. Jen is told about the new information they have. She is in disbelief, but as the evidence mounts that Dusty was involved in an altercation with Paul, Jen provides Hal with some of his toiletries in order for them to run a comparative DNA test on the blood they found at the scene. Emily tells Henry she saw Paul, but she has deluded herself into believing there is still a chance with him even though he told her there was not. Henry doesn't want to get involved but Emily holds BJ's money over his head, and tells him he has to help her make sure Meg is truly not a threat to her reconciliation with Paul. A distraught Jen finds out the blood they found in Paul's room was Dusty's. She angrily confronts Paul about what he has done with Dusty?"

        "[Knocks at door]",
        "Casey: Well, looks like nobody's home.",
        "Maddie: Great. Now what are we going to do?",
        "Casey: Leave these here with a note?",
        "Maddie: It's freezing out. What if Katie doesn't come back 'til late this afternoon? These seedlings will die.",
        "Casey: I told you this was a bad idea.",
        "Maddie: No, you didn't. Besides, this was not my idea, remember? It was your mom's.",
        "Casey: Well, maybe I told her, then. But Aunt Katie's planning a wedding. I doubt she's got time to start gardening.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, apparently your mother disagrees. Hang on. Hold this. I still might have a key from when I lived here. Voila. Here we go.",
        "Casey: This could be considered illegal.",
        "Maddie: I used to live here, remember? Since when does illegal ever bother you?",
        "Casey: You're right, it doesn't. It kind of adds to the excitement.",
        "Maddie: What excitement?",
        "Casey: This.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I hope you don't mind sharing. I didn't have enough for two muffins and two juices. So it was one of each or two of the same.",
        "Gwen: I actually looked up \"newlyweds\" in the dictionary. And it said -- \"two insane people who scrimp, save and share for the first ten years of their life.\" And that included muffins and orange juice.",
        "Will: Oh, good. I can live with that. I'm just sorry we haven't reached the newlywed stage so far.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I can't wait until we do.",
        "Will: Meantime, I was thinking that we should make the fianc\u00e9 part a little more official.",
        "Gwen: Hey, what is that?",
        "Will: Just open it and see.",
        "Gwen: Wait a minute. You didn't knock up a jewelry store, now did you?",
        "Will: Ah, no. Grocery store, more like. Yeah. It came free with the bag of grapes we had for dinner last night. But it's only temporary, you know, until I can get the money to buy a real one. The meaning's clear, though, I hope.",
        "Gwen: It's the most beautiful ring I've ever seen. I'm never gonna take it off, you know.",
        "Will: I don't know how well it's going to go over with repeated washings. It might not hold up.",
        "Gwen: Well, nothing's going to get this ring off my finger. I kind of can't wait to throw it in your mom's face, tell her that whether she likes it or not, I'm going to be Mrs. Will Munson someday. So, here's to someday.",
        "Will: How about, here's to the sooner, the better. You know, we should get to work, actually.",
        "Gwen: Hey, what is that?",
        "Will: The \"J\" section of the phone book. Here. As in, \"Justice of the Peace.\" I tore it out of the yellow pages.",
        "Gwen: Wow. You've been on a real crime spree today.",
        "Will: Well, I had to. We have to get started. We've got to find somebody who's going to marry us right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Hal picks up Paul's steel walking cane]",
        "Hal: Hey, Reynolds? Tag this, and get it to the lab, ASAP, would you? If this isn't Paul's blood, I want to know whose blood it is.",
        "Cop #1: Think it'll match what was in the motel room?",
        "Hal: I hope so. Somebody had a fight in that motel room with Paul, and a bad one. Here. Oh, did you check the registrations on the cars in the motel parking lot?",
        "Cop #1: All the cars are accounted for but this one.",
        "Hal: And it's just been sitting there all this time. Isn't that interesting?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Dusty Donovan. Do you need me to spell it again? No, no message, thank you.",
        "Clerk: Ms. Munson? I just spoke with the limo service. Mr. Donovan never used the car he ordered for the airport yesterday.",
        "Jennifer: Are you sure? Well, maybe he just took a cab instead.",
        "Clerk: Well, he left a bag at the front desk and it's still here.",
        "Jennifer: Can I see it?",
        "Clerk: Sure.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, that's Dusty's bag. I know it. None of this makes any sense. Where is he? What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Emily: Hey, Paul.",
        "Paul: Did you come here to finish the job?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: Snickers? I have a treat for you.",
        "[Casey and Maddie are lying on the floor kissing]",
        "Casey: Gram!",
        "Nancy: Casey, you startled me.",
        "Casey: Sorry.",
        "Nancy: What on earth are you doing here?",
        "Casey: Nothing. You know, just hanging out.",
        "Nancy: Madeline?",
        "Maddie: Hi, Mrs. Hughes. How are you?",
        "Nancy: Is Katie here?",
        "Casey: No, she's not here.",
        "Nancy: Then, what are you doing here?",
        "Casey: Uh, my mom sent us over with some plants for Aunt Katie's garden. You know, she's been kind of bummed since Mike's been out of town. Thought that might help cheer her up.",
        "Nancy: That was very thoughtful of Margo. Were you planting them in the sofa?",
        "Casey: No, we were looking for my wallet. What are you doing here?",
        "Nancy: I brought some lettuce for Snickers. Katie asked me to look in on him while she was at work.",
        "Maddie: Is that Boston Bibb? That's Snickers' favorite. You know, I used to live here and when I did, we always fed Snickers. I can actually -- you know what? Why don't we stay here? I'll feed him. He's very comfortable with me.",
        "Casey: What a great idea. You've probably got lots of stuff to do, right, Gram? We can handle it.",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nancy: Do Tom and Margo know that you two are here? Together? Alone?",
        "Casey: Greatest of the grams, come on. This is not what you think.",
        "Nancy: If memory serves me, it's exactly what I think. Now, you two get along before you get into trouble. I'm perfectly capable of feeding Snickers myself. Go on. Go on, shoo! Go, go.",
        "Casey: All right, all right. See you later, Gram.",
        "Maddie: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Yeah, unless we have fake id's made up in the next 24 hours, you have to be 18 to get married without parental consent.",
        "Gwen: So I can have a baby in this state but I can't get married. That's great.",
        "Will: Yeah. [Will laughs] Well, it's not the end of the world. We just find a state that will let us get married.",
        "Gwen: And then what? We steal a car and drive there?",
        "Will: I can't believe this! It's like the whole world is conspiring against us.",
        "Gwen: No, it's just your mom, and your dad and the state of Illinois.",
        "Will: There's got to be a way around this.",
        "Gwen: You know, we could wait a year and then get married.",
        "Will: I don't want to wait a year. I want to marry you now.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I do, too. But it's getting harder and harder to pull off.",
        "Will: There's got to be a justice of the peace nearby that's going to let us get around this stupid law.",
        "Gwen: Look, what if we just explain what's going on? There's got to be a judge who's willing to listen. Maybe they'll give us a break.",
        "Will: Yeah, maybe. We're going to do this, Gwen. I promise. Nothing's going to stop us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, babe, it's Jen. As soon as you get this message, call me. I have been trying to call you. I'm starting to really get worried.",
        "Barbara: Honey?",
        "Jennifer: Mom.",
        "Barbara: What's wrong?",
        "Jennifer: Dusty was supposed to go away on a business trip and I haven't been able to get in touch with him. And I've left a thousand messages on his cell and at his at the hotel.",
        "Barbara: Honey, let's sit down.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, no. He was supposed to be in New York on a trip and this -- he didn't check into his hotel and this is his bag and it's been sitting here at this desk and I just -- I don't know what's going on! And I just don't know what to think!",
        "Barbara: Honey, I want you to calm down and not worry. I'm sure there's a simple explanation.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not.",
        "Barbara: What do you mean?",
        "Jennifer: Dad said that he found two blood types at that motel. Paul's and someone else's. What if -- what if it's Dusty's?",
        "Barbara: So you think Dusty's the one who showed up at your brother's hotel room and attacked him?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know Mom. It's no secret that he hates Paul for what he did to me.",
        "Barbara: I think you'd better talk to your dad and tell him what you're thinking.",
        "Jennifer: Why? Did he say something?",
        "Barbara: Honey, I don't want you jumping to conclusions. We don't have all the facts here at all. Your dad is on the case.",
        "Jennifer: Mom -- he did say something, okay? You tell me. You tell me what you know.",
        "Barbara: Dusty's car was found in the parking lot at the motel.",
        "Jennifer: The Wagon Wheel? Where Paul was staying?",
        "Barbara: Apparently it had been there all night long.",
        "Jennifer: Oh my God. Oh.",
        "Barbara: It doesn't prove a thing, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: How can you say that, Mom? Dusty is missing and he didn't show up in New York. And his car has been outside that motel. Mom, I can't even begin to think about what that means.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm not here to hurt you. I could never hurt you. And I know that's hard for you to believe, but I swear to you, it's true. I thank God every day that you survived what I did to you. But that's not why I'm here. That's not what I came to talk about. I just -- I needed to see for myself that you were okay.",
        "Paul: I've been better.",
        "Emily: So who did this to you?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter. Almost finished the job, though.",
        "Emily: Yeah. You must have some guardian angel watching over you.",
        "Paul: Right. If I'm a cat with nine lives, I got maybe one or two left. Em, if you didn't come to kill me, then what are you doing here?",
        "Emily: Well, maybe I just -- I had to see for myself that you were really alive. That it was true.",
        "Paul: I'm alive. Sort of. Here we are.",
        "Emily: I guess I can't expect you not to hate me.",
        "Paul: I don't hate you.",
        "Emily: It's okay. Honestly, because I think I hate myself enough for the both of us. And if you ever think for a second that I don't regret what I did, you are wrong because every time I close my eyes and i see you lying in the snow, I want to die.",
        "Paul: All right, look. We both did regrettable things, Em. But it's because of me. I dragged you into my pathetic life.",
        "Emily: No, I went willingly because I loved you.",
        "Paul: And I loved you. That wasn't going to be enough, though. And it would've ended up that I hurt you like I hurt everybody else. And Jennifer made me see that.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know. She told me what she said to you right before we were supposed to be married.",
        "Paul: She wanted me to do the right thing for once, that's all.",
        "Emily: Yeah. See, I would've told you to get a second opinion.",
        "Paul: From you?",
        "Emily: I would've told you the right thing was for us to be together. But you never gave me a chance.",
        "Paul: I honestly believed that the right thing was for you to be without me. You were better off. I believed that.",
        "Emily: Do you still believe that now?",
        "Paul: Yes, I do. I do. More than ever, I do.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I figured that's what you'd say. Yeah, I'm just a memory now. You've moved on, found someone new.",
        "Paul: Oh, Emily.",
        "Emily: Do you love her?",
        "Paul: Don't do that.",
        "Emily: Do you really think Meg Snyder will ever love you the way I did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Okay, the good news is, we are allowed to make our case. Maybe the judge will agree to override the age limit thing and let us get married. If they think the circumstances most judges probably aren't even going to take our call.",
        "Maddie: Why do you need a judge? What did you guys do now?",
        "Will: It's not what we did. It's what we're trying to do.",
        "Gwen: We want to get married.",
        "Maddie: Wow! That's great.",
        "Will: Except the state says we can't if we're not eighteen.",
        "Gwen: So we're trying to get a judge to help us. We just have to find one who'll hear us out.",
        "Casey: Good luck. I can't believe you guys are talking marriage.",
        "Maddie: I think it's fantastic.",
        "Casey: Yeah, fantastically insane.",
        "Gwen: Well, the state of Illinois agrees with you.",
        "Will: The problem is, we don't know anyone to call. We don't even know where to begin.",
        "Maddie: Oh, I do! Casey, your dad's the D.A. He must know practically every judge in town. You could hook them up.",
        "Gwen: There's an idea.",
        "Will: Yeah. Could you talk to him?",
        "Casey: Me? I'm not going to even touch this one. Forget it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Dad is sure that that was Dusty's car?",
        "Barbara: No question. But, it doesn't mean that it was Dusty's blood in Paul's room. Honey, Dusty could've gotten there and Paul could've already been gone.",
        "Jennifer: Then where is Dusty now, Mom?",
        "Barbara: You've got to stop torturing yourself and let your father put all the pieces together. We don't know why Dusty showed up at that motel. Or how he found out that Paul was alive?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I don't know. I didn't tell him that I spoke to Paul. And I certainly didn't say anything about going to see him. But if he found out and he went over there to warn Paul to stay away from me, maybe things got out of hand and -- I don't know Mom, what would I do if it turns out that this is true and --",
        "Barbara: Honey, you've got to stop torturing yourself -- stop this.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, you're right. Okay, you're right. Because there's no way -- there's no way that Dusty would have been able to find out that Paul was alive, much less where he was staying. Unless --",
        "Barbara: Unless what? Did someone else know? Who?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Emily, there is no reason to drag Meg into any this.",
        "Emily: Why not? She's the one who's protecting you the whole time.",
        "Paul: She is a nurse. She found me lying face down in the snow. She wasn't gonna let me die. So she helped me out through the worst of it.",
        "Emily: Oh, yeah? What else she do for you?",
        "Paul: She was there when nobody else was. She saved my life.",
        "Emily: Do you love her?",
        "Paul: Why are you doing this?",
        "Emily: Because if you are already in love with another woman, you never loved me to begin with.",
        "Paul: Emily, I told you that I couldn't love you the way that you wanted me to love you. Let's not forget that. That's why you shot me.",
        "Emily: I was in shock. I was out of my mind.",
        "Paul: You put a bullet in me and you pushed me off of a cliff.",
        "Emily: You know what I can't figure out for the life of me? Why you didn't run, once you got stronger. And why you never came forward. You let Hal and the police, you let everyone think that you committed suicide? You found the gun -- your gun -- you put your fingerprints on it? You could've annihilated me, why? You went out of your way to make sure I wasn't implicated, why?",
        "Paul: I didn't think that you should go to jail. I thought I'd put you through enough already.",
        "Emily: So what are you saying, that you forgive me for what I did to you?",
        "Paul: Well, of course I forgive you. Emily, it was all my fault. I pushed you into a corner. I turned your whole life inside out.",
        "Emily: So, where does that leave us now?",
        "Paul: Us? There's no us, Emily.",
        "Emily: But you just said that you --",
        "Paul: That I forgave you? Yes, I do. Do you really -- you really think that you and I could be together after everything we've been through? That's a really -- that's a really tough climb.",
        "Emily: Because of Meg.",
        "Paul: Emily, I told you, Meg has nothing to do with this. It was a business deal. She helped me get healthy and I promised her a lot of money for that, and that's all. I owe her, though. I will tell you this, I will protect her. The same way I will protect you.",
        "Emily: Okay. I won't say a word that she helped you.",
        "Paul: I'm grateful.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but not grateful enough for us to try again?",
        "Paul: Emily, stop it.",
        "Emily: I can't help it. If what you have with Meg is just a business arrangement, then why can't we? Why can't we try again? Maybe we can get it right this time.",
        "Jessica: Good morning.",
        "Paul: Morning, Counselor.",
        "Emily: Good morning, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Emily, I need to speak with my client privately. Would you mind waiting outside for a few minutes?",
        "Paul: No, I really want Emily to stay here.",
        "Jessica: Paul, there's a lot we need to discuss, privately.",
        "Paul: So, Hal's coming after me with both barrels is that what you're saying?",
        "Jessica: He's ready to throw the book at you.",
        "Paul: Well then, we have to be prepared. So I hope you brought a pen and some paper. Because I'm gonna tell you the whole story.",
        "Jessica: And you're aware that the story in question begins on New Year's Eve? The night Emily last saw you. It might not be in your best interest to have her present.",
        "Paul: I'm not going to say anything that Emily doesn't already know. New Year's Eve was the night I told her I wasn't going to marry her. And now I'm going to tell you everything that happened after that and I want Emily to hear it all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Dad, did you hear anything about Dusty?",
        "Hal: No. I was hoping you were gonna tell me you had.",
        "Jennifer: He's been missing all night.",
        "Hal: Did Barbara tell you we found his car in the parking lot?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Hal: It means he may very possibly the guy who beat Paul within an inch of his life. That blood we found in the hotel room, Paul's room, it matches the blood we found under Paul's fingernails. And the blood on Paul's cane. So, Paul gave as good as he got.",
        "Jennifer: That's what terrifies me.",
        "Barbara: I keep telling Jen that we don't know the whole story yet, at all. Do we, Hal?",
        "Hal: Well, that's true. But honey, it's time you started preparing yourself for the worst.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Will: Our plan's not gonna live or die with whether or not Casey gets a judge's name for us. We're gonna get married with or without his help.",
        "Tom: You know I will do whatever I can to help.",
        "Casey: So about those judges --",
        "Emily: He doesn't love her.",
        "Henry: What are you saying? You think he still loves you?",
        "Emily: I saw it in his eyes.",
        "Hal: We got a blood match on the DNA -- it's Dusty's blood.",
        "Jennifer: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Casey, that's not fair. Just because you think it's not a good idea doesn't mean that you shouldn't help them if you can.",
        "Casey: Okay, look, if the state of Illinois thinks you guys are too young to get married, I doubt my dad's gonna think any different.",
        "Will: You're probably right.",
        "Maddie: So, don't tell him it's about Will and Gwen when you talk to him. Tell him that you need information for like a civics project or something. And get a list of names of all the judges who are okay with the idea of young people getting married.",
        "Casey: What if there aren't any?",
        "Maddie: You're just trying to make excuses because you don't think it's a good idea.",
        "Casey: Don't you have enough trouble already? I mean, getting married's just going to make your parents more upset than they already are.",
        "Will: Yeah, that's the whole point, if we get married then they have to accept us as a couple. They have to take us seriously.",
        "Maddie: It's not about what other people think anyway, Casey. It's about being in love. And it's romantic. Besides, if we're all gonna be hanging out, you need to understand how important this is to Will. It's not like you have to do much anyway, all you have to do is ask your dad a couple of questions.",
        "Casey: But not tell him the real reason I'm asking. Sorry, guys, but lying to my parents hasn't really worked out that well for me lately. I'm just not up for this. Sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'd hurt so many people, even though I always tried to do the right thing. That I thought that I had finally hit rock bottom. The whole situation had gotten so far out of control, I just needed a way to get away form everybody and everything and do it in such a way that no one would come after me.",
        "Jessica: By trying to kill yourself?",
        "Paul: After I told Emily we weren't going to get married, I went home and got the gun out of the safe. I just kept seeing her face. She was very hurt. And betrayed. And I couldn't get that out of my mind. So I went to the woods and I found a place by the river, and I pulled the trigger.",
        "Jessica: It's amazing you survived. Then what happened?",
        "Paul: I woke up a few hours after. I was weak. Delirious. Lost a lot of blood. And I started to wander, stumbled on a cabin. Figured out how to get in and didn't go anywhere -- stayed there until I could move. It was abandoned I guess because there was enough food for me to survive and medical supplies.",
        "Jessica: So you were able to nurse yourself back to health, all alone. With no help from anyone.",
        "Paul: That's correct.",
        "Jessica: Why bother?",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Jessica: I mean, you said you had hit rock bottom, you wanted to die --",
        "Paul: Well, when I didn't die, I thought that that meant something. I figured it was some kind of sign that there was something left for me to do.",
        "Jessica: Like what?",
        "Paul: Make sure that Emily was okay. And I had to make sure that Jennifer was going on with her life. I even started to hope that Jennifer would forgive me for lying to her about her baby.",
        "Jessica: So, that's why you didn't run when you had the chance?",
        "Paul: I thought about running, believe me. I thought about a lot of different destinations. Like I said, I still had loose ends to tie up.",
        "Jessica: And now, you're right back where you were on New Year's Eve. About to be sent to prison.",
        "Paul: Minus the fianc\u00e9e. There's no going back.",
        "Jessica: Emily, I really need to speak to Paul, alone. Please.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Paul: What? What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: How about everything you just told me?",
        "Paul: That's what happened. That's my story.",
        "Jessica: And you're sticking with it? Okay, okay, fine. For now. But you have bigger problems. Hal isn't worried about how you survived for months in the woods all alone. He wants to know who was in that motel room with you. And obviously you two of you had one hell of a fight. So who was it, Paul? Tell me what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: We have eyewitness testimony that a man matching Dusty's description went into Paul's room yesterday. A little while later, the same witness heard sounds of a scuffle.",
        "Jennifer: But no one ever saw the fight -- no one saw what happened after?",
        "Hal: No.",
        "Jennifer: Okay then -- it could've been someone else who fought with Paul because Dusty could have walked in there and then five minutes later, walked right out.",
        "Hal: I'm going to need something with Dusty's DNA on it. Honey, it's time to stop guessing about what probably happened.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, okay, you're right. This probably has something you can use.",
        "Hal: Okay. I'll run this over to the lab and push them for an answer, ASAP.",
        "Jennifer: Dad, I want to come with you. I want to be there when you find out the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Don't be too angry at Casey.",
        "Maddie: Why not? Honestly, what would it have cost him to ask his dad a few questions?",
        "Will: Probably nothing. But, you can't just spring things on him. You gotta give him time to think.",
        "Maddie: Meanwhile, all the good opportunities slip away.",
        "Gwen: I think he's just gun-shy now. He's probably scared that he's gonna end up getting in trouble.",
        "Will: Look, our plan is not going to live or die with whether Casey gets a judge's name for us. We're going get married, with or without his help.",
        "Gwen: So, what's our next move?",
        "Will: I'm still working on that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, Dad.",
        "Tom: Hey, Case. Is everything all right? As in -- shouldn't you be at school?",
        "Casey: Day off, remember?",
        "Tom: Oh, right I did forget. Didn't you promise to help your mom change the screens on the windows downstairs?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I'm gonna do it this afternoon. I had a lot of homework to plow through.",
        "Tom: So, shouldn't you be at home plowing?",
        "Casey: Well, one of the assignments I actually could use help on if you have time.",
        "Tom: Sure -- sure I've got a few minutes.",
        "Casey: All right, see, we do projects from a hat, and I got stuck doing something on teen marriages.",
        "Tom: Which class is this for?",
        "Casey: Um, journalism.",
        "Tom: Kind of ironic, huh?",
        "Casey: Why?",
        "Tom: Given what you went through with Gwen Norbeck, I would assume that teen marriage is not a subject that's near and dear to your heart.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, I'm not doing it on kids who have to get married. Some of them actually want to get married. And I've got a few people who just got married recently who are willing to talk to me about it.",
        "Tom: And these are couples at school?",
        "Casey: Yeah, some kids who just turned 18 and I'm gonna ask them if they would've gotten married before if the law allowed it.",
        "Tom: Which it doesn't, in this state. You need to be 18 in most states, as a matter of fact.",
        "Casey: Right. That's where you come in. I want to talk to some judges about the law and see, you know, if they agree with it or if they think there's any circumstances that should allow kids to get married before.",
        "Tom: And this is a project for school?",
        "Casey: You don't think I'm asking for myself, do you?",
        "Tom: Oh, come on, you can't be surprised that I asked.",
        "Casey: Man, sometimes I feel like I can't do anything right for you or Mom.",
        "Tom: Actually, you were doing quite well. Then you and Maddie decided to take the law into your own hands and your mother and I were not amused by the stunt you pulled with Barbara Ryan.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but because of me, Gwen's not going to jail for something she didn't do.",
        "Tom: The end does not always justify the means.",
        "Casey: Can we just get back to my school project?",
        "Tom: Forgive me. I'm probably still trying to adjust to the fact that you seem to be excited about something having to do with school.",
        "Casey: I wouldn't call it excited.",
        "Tom: Nonetheless, it's been a while since you seemed to care this much.",
        "Casey: A lot's happened, you know? Trying to get back on track.",
        "Tom: And I appreciate that. And you know I will do whatever I can to help.",
        "Casey: Cool. So, about those judges \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: There you are. I was beginning to think all my dire predictions about Paul had come true. I had this very clear mental picture of you pacing back and forth in a jail cell.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? You can erase those thoughts from your head because I'm in the clear. He's not turning me in.",
        "Henry: And we know this, how?",
        "Emily: He told me.",
        "Henry: You've seen him?",
        "Emily: Yes. I was just at the hospital.",
        "Henry: Did you leave him breathing?",
        "Emily: That is not funny, Henry. We've all moved on. Even Paul.",
        "Henry: You're telling me that he has forgiven you for shooting him?",
        "Emily: Yes, as a matter of fact, he forgives me.",
        "Henry: Okay, well, well, wait a second. If I were trapped in a bed, looking up at the woman who put a bullet in my body, I guess I'd say the same thing.",
        "Emily: He meant it. I could tell.",
        "Henry: How is he?",
        "Emily: Pretty battered. Dusty did a real number on him.",
        "Henry: Yeah, thanks to you. For someone who claims to want to care for the man, you seem to really be plotting his demise.",
        "Emily: It was a bad call, okay, I know that. Telling Dusty where Paul was. I regretted it as soon as I did it.",
        "Henry: It's always after the fact with you. But I am glad to hear that Paul's going to make it. Any news on how Dusty fared in the showdown?",
        "Emily: No, I don't know.",
        "Henry: Really? Because a little bird told me that they found two sets of bloodstains at the motel. Wouldn't that be ironic if after sending Dusty to do your dirty work, he's the one that got all --?",
        "Emily: I'm sure Dusty is just fine, Henry.",
        "Henry: Okay. Let's talk about the white elephant in the room. Did you find anything about what's going on with Paul and Meg?",
        "Emily: Paul said the only reason meg helped him was for the money.",
        "Henry: Despite the kiss that you witnessed.",
        "Emily: I guess it wasn't what it seemed.",
        "Henry: What was it then? Could it have been CPR? Or some other life-saving action?",
        "Emily: He doesn't love her.",
        "Henry: What are you saying? You think he still loves you?",
        "Emily: I saw it in his eyes.",
        "Henry: One word of caution -- men like Paul, actions speak a lot louder than looks.",
        "Emily: I know what I saw, Henry. And in spite of everything he said, I still think the two of us have a second chance.",
        "Henry: Until he finds out that you're the one who sent Dusty to the motel. Then, my dear, your duck a la orange is cooked.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. See, that's the thing. He never said a word about Dusty. And I'm sure as hell not about to. And neither are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: All right, tell me what you do remember.",
        "Paul: Somebody came at me from behind. I never saw a face.",
        "Jessica: Do you really expect anyone to believe that?",
        "Paul: It is what it is. Could you call the nurse for me? Because I'm starting to not feel so good.",
        "Jessica: Paul, the only way I can help you is if you are honest with me. Now, it's only a matter of time before the police find out whose blood it is in that room.",
        "Paul: I have a lot of enemies.",
        "Jessica: And what if one of them decides to come forward? If they can still talk, they probably will. If they can't, then you can bet Hal's gonna do his best to find out why not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: It's not Dusty's blood. It can't be.",
        "Barbara: Honey, even if it is, we don't know how serious his injuries are. They found Paul's blood too, and he's going to be all right. Who's to say the same won't be true of Dusty.",
        "Jennifer: We know what Paul's capable of when he thinks he's protecting me. It has to be someone else's blood.",
        "Hal: I'm afraid not. I'm sorry, Jennifer, we got a blood match on the DNA -- it's Dusty's blood.",
        "Barbara: I've got to go find Jen, she shouldn't be alone.",
        "Hal: Don't crowd her, Barbara. Jen needs to deal with this in her own way.",
        "Barbara: I've got to talk to Will, too. He needs to know that his brother is alive and he's not taking my calls.",
        "Hal: And you're surprised? I'll give it a try.",
        "Barbara: Oh, please, don't kid yourself. He's not going to take your calls either, Hal. Not after you told him that you wouldn't take Gwen into your house. You better face it -- I think we lost Will this time, for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: What are you so happy about?",
        "Casey: Judge Steve Colby. Springfield, Illinois. Give him a call, he's waiting to hear from you.",
        "Will: Where'd you get this?",
        "Casey: My dad. The school project thing worked, he bought it.",
        "Maddie: I thought you didn't want to help them.",
        "Casey: So maybe I had second thoughts. Hey, if you guys leave now you can get to Springfield before Colby leaves for the day.",
        "Gwen: You think he'll really talk to us?",
        "Casey: If anybody can help you, it's him.",
        "Will: Casey, thanks, man. This is incredible.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, really. Thank you.",
        "Will: Now, the only problem is, we don't have any money and no car and we can't take the bus.",
        "Casey: Well, if you don't mind listening to my music, I'll give you a ride.",
        "Will: For real?",
        "Casey: For real.",
        "Will: Well that's great, I kind of miss your full frontal rock.",
        "Casey: Yeah? Well, maybe I'll throw in some of those soft, nauseating tunes you like, just to mix it up.",
        "Will: I don't care what we listen to as long as you get us to Springfield.",
        "Casey: Want to go for a ride?",
        "Maddie: Sure! Casey this is unbelievable. What made you change your mind?",
        "Casey: You did.",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I'm happy for you, Em. I really am. I hope you and Paul can put the bloodletting behind you and find happiness. As for me, I'll just take that money that you've been holding for me so kindly and just walk out of your life. Do you want to go get it together? Or should we rendezvous? How do you want to do it?",
        "Emily: It's not that simple, Henry.",
        "Henry: Yeah, it's pretty simple, actually. You give it to me, I take it from you and I walk on go with my life. You and Paul make whoopee till the cows come home. It's very simple, simple as pie.",
        "Emily: I need to make sure that Meg isn't going to be a problem.",
        "Henry: You just said that Paul was buying her off. Why should she be a problem?",
        "Emily: I'm just trying to be smart, Henry. And you know what? You're right. I shouldn't just accept what Paul says at face value. I need to know exactly what he and Meg have been up to. And you're going to help me find that out.",
        "Henry: I was afraid you were going to say that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Yes, Will has a grudge against me because I wouldn't let him and Gwen share a room in my house. But don't put me in your league, Barbara. You lied to Gwen, you tried to have her thrown in jail!",
        "Barbara: She belongs behind bars.",
        "Hal: And you wonder why Will won't talk to you? Is there a problem?",
        "Cop #1: The guard just called from Paul Ryan's hospital room. You need to get over there.",
