        "Meg: Here you go, Cobb salad, extra turkey, crispy bacon and mixed dressing.",
        "Customer #1: I asked very clearly for the dressing on the side.",
        "Meg: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll get you another one right away.",
        "Customer #1: Good, I'd like to be able to eat with my friend.",
        "Meg: Need another Cobb salad, table five, and this time, dressing on the side, please.",
        "Manager: I'm going to start charging you for that food.",
        "Meg: That wasn't my fault. The cook actually did --",
        "Manager: You have an order up. Food's not getting any warmer.",
        "Meg: I'm on it.",
        "Craig: Hey. Look like you got your hands full. You know, they call that \"In the weeds\" in the food industry, did you know that?",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, this whole place is one big field of weeds.",
        "Craig: Does that mean that you're ready to accept my help?",

        "Dusty: Hey, it's me. I know it's late. But I need to see you right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Is a drink really necessary?",
        "Eliot: Well, you seem on edge. I'm trying to loosen you up here, maybe get you to relax a little --",
        "Emily: I mean it. Skip the drink already.",
        "Eliot: What is the rush? You don't have anybody waiting for you tonight. I talked to Cheri and I handled all that --",
        "Emily: Yeah, without consulting me.",
        "Eliot: Hey, what is your problem, Emily? Does it have anything to do with Dusty Donovan?",
        "Emily: What about him?",
        "Eliot: Well, your previous engagement, was it with him?",
        "Emily: You know what? We don't have much time together. And from what I remember, you don't like to talk. So, do you really want to spend all your time with me, asking me questions about Dusty?",
        "Eliot: Listen, Sweetheart, I'm spending a lot of money on you tonight. Double your usual rate, which means I've gone through a lot of trouble to get this date. So, if I want to talk, we're going to talk. And when I'm ready for a change, the last thing I want is to be interrupted by some jealous boyfriend who can't handle the fact that his lady is doing a little moonlighting --",
        "Emily: He's not my boyfriend, okay? I thought I told you. He's not my boyfriend. We're barely friends. We work at the same company. That's it. Strictly business.",
        "Eliot: Strictly business, like us?",
        "Emily: Dusty knows that I wouldn't appreciate it if he interfered in my personal life, okay? It doesn't pay to cross me. He learned that the hard way.",
        "Eliot: Why? What did you do? Did you take him over your knee and spank him?",
        "Emily: I kidnapped him. I kept him chained to a wall in an abandoned cabin for weeks.",
        "Eliot: You're not serious.",
        "Emily: Why would I make something like that up?",
        "Eliot: To scare me. Maybe because you are seriously trying to turn me on.",

        "Dusty: What do you know about Eliot Gerard?",
        "Lucinda: He's an executive network out of Chicago. Are you doing some work with him?",
        "Dusty: He just bought major ad space in \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Lucinda: Ah.",
        "Dusty: So you do know him?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, not well. I've been around him enough to know he puts up a good front.",
        "Dusty: Why's that?",
        "Lucinda: Why does anybody put on a good front? It hides the bad side so very, very well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Look, I'm not trying to do anything, Eliot. Except get through your head that Dusty Donovan isn't a problem. So, you can relax, okay? No one's going to come busting through that door to defend my honor. Believe me. You and I can do business as usual.",
        "Eliot: It seems like business just got a little bit more serious. I had a feeling that you liked playing rough.",
        "Emily: Excuse me?",
        "Eliot: Well, pain. Maybe a little bondage?",
        "Emily: Well, I'm not into that. And neither were you the last time, if I remember correctly.",
        "Eliot: Okay, full disclosure. Last time was a little vanilla for my taste.",
        "Emily: Fine. We don't have to do this.",
        "Eliot: Hey, don't get upset. You were the one that opened the door. You can't get upset over at someone who walks in --",
        "Emily: I'm not upset. I'm not upset. I'm not upset. It's just we don't have much time. Do you want to get started? Oh, God.",
        "Eliot: Let's get started.",

        "Meg: Okay, yes, the Wagon Wheel has its flaws, and yes, I'm still trying to figure out the difference between home fries and hash browns. But you know what? This is where I belong right now --",
        "Craig: No, no, it's not. You're doing exactly what you promised me you wouldn't. You're punishing yourself.",
        "Meg: Cheap housing and working for tips never killed anyone.",
        "[Bell rings]",
        "Craig: No, okay, okay. What's wrong with upgrading, huh? You'd like living with me. I'm good company. Especially over breakfast.",
        "Meg: Your Cobb salad.",
        "Customer #1: Are you sure the dressing's on the side this time?",
        "Craig: Hey, look, Emeril, it's a $5 salad. Be grateful it's green.",
        "Meg: Craig, enough! I'm sorry about him. Yes, your dressing is on the side this time. Okay, I know how this goes. I say yes to you and then when I least expect it, I trip over one of those strings that you swore up and down that you wouldn't attach to me.",
        "Craig: Look, Meg, I want to be very clear. I do not want to be in a relationship with you on conditions. I want to be in this because you want to be in it with me.",
        "Meg: I want you to stop worrying about me. I am quite capable of taking care of myself. And the more I do, the better I feel about everything. Okay?",
        "Craig: Come here. I need to talk.",
        "Manager: About what?",
        "Craig: I've got a proposition for you.",

        "Emily: What the hell do you think you're doing? I didn't agree to this.",
        "Eliot: Just go with it.",
        "Emily: Go with it? You can go find yourself another girl. I'm out of here.",

        "Emily: No, move. Get out of my way!",
        "Eliot: Hey, hey. You don't make the rules tonight. That is my job.",
        "Emily: I mean it, let go of me, Eliot. Knock it off.",
        "Eliot: Oh, yeah? What are you going to do if I don't?",
        "Emily: You don't want to find out. Get away from me. Don't call me again.",
        "Eliot: I knew from the moment I saw you that we had something. You can call yourself whatever you want, but what you really are is a whore.",
        "Emily: No, oh, God, no.",
        "Eliot: A little freak who gets off on chaining some guy to a brick wall.",

        "Lucinda: Um, it was a conference in years back, Gerald was involved. And there was a charming, young female executive. She was smart, she had it. I was going to offer her a job at Worldwide. No, he got to her first. And he sweet talked her into joining him in his suite for a private conference. I wasn't there. I don't know what happened. But whatever it was, it was not nice. The next morning, she was gone, she quit her job and she left town as fast as she could get out.",

        "Lucinda: I say, a pretty woman should keep her distance from him.",

        "Eliot: Hey, but my time's not up.",
        "Emily: No!",
        "Eliot: I don't think that's the best idea right now. Now take a deep breath now. There you go. Are you going to be a good girl now?",

        "Emily: Because that's what I want.",
        "Susan: You don't know what you want. What were you doing in some strange man's hotel room anyway? Don't even tell me. I don't even want to know.",

        "Emily: No, no, don't you blame any of this on Hal.",
        "Susan: I'm not blaming Hal, I blame myself. But they're your choices, Baby. You get into these relationships. You get all involved and they're so destructive.",
        "Emily: You just love -- you love to do this, don't you? You love to question all the decisions I make. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Susan: Emily, you went to a strange man's hotel room. You put yourself in a position where something could happen and it did. That creep, he attacked you. How does that demonstrate to me that you're in control of your life?",

        "Emily: No, no, Dusty, please, just leave him alone.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Emily: He -- he didn't -- I know what my mother thinks, but he didn't rape me. He just roughed me up a little bit.",
        "Dusty: Just roughed you up a little bit? Is that supposed to be okay?",
        "Emily: It's just what happened. I just want to forget about it.",
        "Dusty: What were you doing in his room to begin with?",
        "Emily: That's none of your business.",
        "Dusty: Well, how'd it start? I mean, if you slept with him, he would run ads with us?",
        "Emily: What? No. No. This isn't going to change anything. He's not going to pull his business.",
        "Dusty: You think I care about that? We already pulled our business from him.",

        "Emily: I can be with whomever I want.",
        "Dusty: A guy like Eliot Gerard? So you're stumbling home, your clothes ripped off, your lips bleeding. I can't believe that's what you want for yourself. Is that true?",
        "Emily: You have no idea what I want.",
        "Dusty: No, I don't. It's pretty hard to figure out.",
        "Emily: Well, then, don't bother, because you can't. You know what? No man will ever know what I want. You know why that is? No man will ever really know me.",
        "Dusty: What's that supposed to mean?",

        "Meg: You'd leave, just like that?",

I want to hold onto you.\" And of course, he said it with a little bit more desperation than that, but, you know, the fact is I don't want to make the same mistakes he did. So I'm here, for you, now.

        "Meg: Oh, no. [Meg laughing] Okay, stop, no more. No more.",
        "Craig: Are you saying I wore you out?",
        "Meg: Ah, yeah. Well, we danced all night.",
        "Craig: Yeah, it was worth it, huh?",
        "Meg: It was, and now I have just enough time to get a couple hours of sleep before I have to get back to work.",
        "Craig: Are you saying I can't convince you to come home with me then?",
        "Meg: Craig, I just --",
        "Craig: No, no, no. Calm down.",

        "Emily: Was my mom downstairs?",
        "Dusty: Nope. But there was a note on the counter. She went to the hospital for some kind of an emergency. She wants me to call her and let her know how you're doing.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, you don't need to do that. I'm fine, see? I'm fine.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I see.",
        "Emily: Listen, I feel really -- I feel really stupid about what happened with Eliot last night. I mean, you were right. You obviously picked up on something. Look the point is it's not going to happen again -- with him.",
        "Dusty: You've got to go after him. You can't let him get away with it.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no. I can not. I can not go to the police. It means I would have to relive last night over and over again. Every single detail, everything, and I leave out one thing -- I forget one thing, they're not going to believe me. They're going to think I'm making it up.",
        "Dusty: No, you don't know that.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I do. It'll be my word against his. And I'm not up for that kind of fight.",
        "Dusty: I am.",
        "Emily: It's not up to you.",
        "Dusty: This guy beat you up. It's not okay to let him get away with it.",
        "Emily: Dusty, thank you for spending the night.",
        "Dusty: All right. If you want me to drop it, I will. But you got to tell me what happened in that room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Can I tell you something? And I don't want you to do or say anything. I just want you to listen. Can you do that?",
        "Craig: I'll try my hardest.",
        "Meg: I was a mess the night we slept together.",
        "Craig: I know --",
        "Meg: Don't talk, please. Please. I had taken all those pills, and I drank too much. And I'm not saying that you took advantage of me, because you didn't. Not at all. But if, and that's a big \"If,\" we do sleep together again, I want to be in a different place. I want my life to be under control.",
        "Craig: Cool. Do you see any of that taking place in the next ten minutes?",
        "Meg: No, I don't think so. But when it does happen, I promise you'll be the first to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Last night was such a blur. I mean, that's why even if I wanted to go to the police, Dusty, I can't. I mean, I remember going into Eliot's room. I remember some of the things he was saying to me. I can't remember how it started. When he hit me or how many times after that. And I'm not stupid. I know what he did was wrong. And I know how lucky I am that I got out of there. But, I also know what I did was wrong too. I -- just by being there, I mean, I was using him.",
        "Dusty: To forget?",
        "Emily: Yeah. I could apologize for it. I can say I'm sorry. It doesn't change it. What I did was wrong, and it won't happen again. I just hope you believe me.",
        "Dusty: Are you asking me to trust you again?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I am. Dusty, when I looked in that mirror and I saw what he did to me, I should have been scared. Or mad or something. I felt nothing. That's probably why everything i said to you didn't make much sense. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I scared you.",
        "Dusty: Just don't scare me again.",
        "Emily: I won't. You know, you said something else to me last night. You said that I deserved better. And I'm going to make sure that's exactly what I get when I'm ready for it. Thank you for worrying about me.",
        "Dusty: It's nothing.",
        "Emily: You know you said something else to me. You said you were my friend. I hope its okay that I think of you as one too.",
        "Dusty: Of course. I'll see you alter on.",
        "Emily: Yeah, absolutely.",
