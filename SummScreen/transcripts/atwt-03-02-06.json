        "Lily: Oh. Oh, Rose, I wish you could be here to see your daughter. She could get to know you.",
        "Luke: Have you ridden before? You're really good.",
        "Jade: Once or twice, but not western. Do you and Kevin ride?",
        "Luke: Sometimes. Hey, I wanted to thank you again for bailing me out the other night about the concert.",
        "Jade: It's no problem. What are cousins for? I still don't get why they're so down on the guy. I mean, Kevin's cool. What's all this bad influence talk?",
        "Luke: Well, we got drunk once or twice.",
        "Jade: But that's drinking. That's not Kevin. Have you talked to him today?",
        "Luke: No. Not yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, hey!",
        "Holden: Hey cousin.",
        "Jack: Working hard?",
        "Holden: Mama always told us that a farmer's work was never done. So what do I do? Go and become a horse trainer anyway. Can't say I wasn't warned, huh?",
        "Jack: No, I guess you can't.",
        "Holden: How're you? Things picking up at the station?",
        "Jack: Maybe. Talk to Meg recently?",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Jack: Holden, I think we might have a problem.",
        "Kevin: Mr. Snyder? I got your message about finding my I.D.",
        "Holden: I thought I told you to stay away from my son!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Meg: Hello?",
        "Emily: Paul was arrested last night.",
        "Meg: Who is this?",
        "Emily: It's Emily. Who do you think? We need to talk.",
        "Meg: I'm listening.",
        "Emily: No, face to face. Meet me in the lobby in five minutes. She's on her way.",
        "Henry: I don't see why. You were so charming.",
        "Emily: Because she's curious. That's why. And while we're chatting, you that key we still have to her suite and take a look.",
        "Henry: I still don't see what you expect me to find.",
        "Emily: Evidence, Henry. Evidence.",
        "Henry: Evidence of what? Of what?",
        "Emily: How she feels about Paul. Just look for anything. Letters or photos. Look for a diary, maybe.",
        "Henry: What do you expect me to find his name circled with little hearts? She's not 13, Em. She's not going to pour her soul out in bright pink ink.",
        "Emily: Henry, just look. Okay, I need to know the truth. I need to know if she's really in love with Paul. And if she is, then maybe he lied to me. Maybe he's in love with her too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Dusty is missing.",
        "Paul: Sorry to hear that.",
        "Jennifer: Where is he? What did you do to him?",
        "Paul: You think I did something to Dusty?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, come on, Paul. Who else?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You come anywhere near my son you talk to him in school, you call him on the phone, you sneak onto my property -- you will answer to me. You got that?",
        "Kevin: Yes, sir.",
        "Jack: What the hell was that?",
        "Holden: That's the kid I telling you about.",
        "Jack: The one who was drinking with Luke?",
        "Holden: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Did it happen again or something?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Jack: So?",
        "Holden: So Luke just had a transplant. If he drinks again, he puts himself at risk.",
        "Jack: Did you tell Luke that?",
        "Holden: He understands the situation.",
        "Jack: Holden, I've never seen you go off on a kid like that, never. It's not like you. What is going on? I know something's bothering you and for whatever reason you're having trouble putting it into words. We've had half a conversation countless number of times over the past few months and I'm sorry about that. But I'm here now. Why don't you take this opportunity to unload before you seriously do some damage.",
        "Holden: I don't even know where to start. I shouldn't have jumped down that kid's throat like I did. But I blame him.",
        "Jack: If it weren't Kevin, it'd be somebody else. Holden, kids experiment with alcohol. You just hope that they don't go overdo it. Or, God forbid, get in a car.",
        "Holden: It's not the drinking. I think that Luke might be gay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: We'll take it slow. It hasn't been raining much, so the horses won't have any trouble finding their footing.",
        "Jade: You're so good at this.",
        "Luke: Well, I've been doing it all my life.",
        "Jade: No, it's not that. The horses really listen to you.",
        "Luke: I've raised most of them, or helped. My dad's had me in the barn since I was a kid. Taught me how to ride, muck out, groom. Actually, this last year I even started helping him deliver the foals. We were up all night last spring with that mare you're riding. She was having some trouble and he just, he talked her right through it.",
        "Jade: I guess this tension you've been having, this is new?",
        "Luke: Yeah. The thing about my dad is he's not my biological father. I don't know if you knew that.",
        "Jade: No, I didn't.",
        "Luke: Yeah, my biological father wasn't married to my mom for a long time. And he's not really in the picture anymore. So Holden's really been the one who's raised me for most of my life.",
        "Jade: Well, I never would have guessed that you weren't his son. I mean, you are his son, it's obvious by the way that he treats you.",
        "Luke: Well, that's the way he wanted it. He didn't have to, you know, to love me, but he did.",
        "Jade: You're so lucky. It was never like that. My parents -- my adoptive parents, we never really clicked.",
        "Luke: That must've been lonely.",
        "Jade: You know I never would've used that word, but you're right. It was lonely. No wonder it's so hard for you when things get tense with him.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I just -- I just hate disappointing him.",
        "Jade: Well, maybe it's not disappointment. Maybe he just doesn't understand.",
        "Luke: What do you mean?",
        "Jade: Well, it's just like you said the other day. Parents, fathers, they have this picture in their head of how you're supposed to turn out. And sometimes it takes a little while for them to understand that even though you don't fit the picture. You're still you.",
        "Luke: Oh, I'm sorry. I've got to take this. Hey, Kevin. Took you long enough to call me back.",
        "Luke: Yeah, okay. Hold on. Jade, I've got to ask another favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You wanted to speak to me?",
        "Emily: We need to talk about Paul.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Emily: Why? Did you or did you not hear me say that he's been arrested.",
        "Meg: I heard you. But what does that have to do with you and me?",
        "Emily: Meg, there's bound to be an investigation. I mean, the man was presumed dead for months. And then they find him at the Wagon Wheel Motel? Don't you think it's all a little suspicious?",
        "Meg: What's your point, Emily?",
        "Emily: My point is that we both knew that he was alive and he was avoiding the police. He's a fugitive.",
        "Meg: A good lawyer could get around that.",
        "Emily: Are you serious?",
        "Meg: Look, he was staying at the Wagon Wheel. The police arrested him at the cemetery. As far as the they know, he never left town. The argument could be made that he was within the terms of his bail agreement.",
        "Emily: And the car they found in the river?",
        "Meg: Stolen.",
        "Emily: What about the bloody shirt?",
        "Meg: It was in the back of the car. He cut himself shaving.",
        "Emily: Have they questioned you yet?",
        "Meg: I don't think that's any of your business.",
        "Emily: Why are you being so hostile?",
        "Meg: Because I'm waiting for you to tell me what you want.",
        "Emily: I saw Paul at the hospital today. Aren't you just a little curious, Meg?",
        "Meg: About what?",
        "Emily: He promised that he wouldn't implicate either one of us.",
        "Meg: Ok, so what's the problem then?",
        "Emily: You are the problem, Meg. You and this attitude of yours. You make me very nervous.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Emily: Why? Because Paul promised not to talk and Henry won't talk and now that just leaves you, doesn't it?.",
        "Meg: Do you want to make a deal, Emily, is that it?",
        "Emily: What I don't want is to be charged as an accessory.",
        "Meg: In your case, I think you're looking at attempted murder.",
        "Emily: Whatever, whatever, okay. You just need to promise me that you're not going to go to the police, okay? And in return, I will keep quiet about the fact that you lied to the police about Paul's whereabouts.",
        "Meg: Okay, done.",
        "Emily: Wait, where're you going?",
        "Meg: What do you need, a pinky swear?",
        "Emily: I'm not finished. I'm not finished.",
        "Meg: Look, I agreed to your terms. What more is there to talk about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Okay, keep her talking, Em. If I were a clue to Meg's state of mind, where oh where -- come on, this always worked on \"Magnum P.I.\" What would she be doing with a man's wallet? Is that blood on this? What the -- -",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I know for a fact that Dusty came to your room yesterday.",
        "Paul: Really? How could you know that for a fact unless you sent him, huh? Is that what happened, Jennifer? After you got off the phone with me? After you promised to come alone? After you promised me that you weren't going to tell anybody?",
        "Jennifer: I didn't tell anyone and the only person I brought with me was Johnny, because I thought that might like to see your nephew! But you were gone and that motel room was a wreck! There was blood everywhere -- yours and Dusty's. And they found his blood on your clothes and on the cane they found at the cemetery. Did you hit him?",
        "Paul: I don't usually solve my problems, Jennifer, by hitting people. Especially not Dusty. He knows how to fight.",
        "Jennifer: Except here you are lying in a hospital bed, covered in bruises, and Dusty is missing.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe there's another explanation as to why Dusty took a little time off.",
        "Jennifer: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Paul: I don't know. You tell me. You're involved with him. Isn't that how it goes in your happy little home, huh? You and Dusty and Craig's son.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, you're just trying to make me mad so that I'll get out of here and forget why I came?",
        "Paul: No, no. I knew you came here because you were worried about me.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I am worried about you. Look at you. You've been shot and you were covered in bruises. And you know what, you're not anybody's favorite person right now and that's because you are acting like a lunatic. And you are making everyone you love enemies. Why? What? What is wrong with you?",
        "Paul: You want to know the truth? I have been trying to change. Because my sister told me to not be so selfish.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, if that's true, then you tell me what happened in that motel room. Because I know Dusty was there. I know you saw him. I know you left the motel room and went to the mausoleum. Now why is that? Was it because you felt guilty?",
        "Paul: I always feel guilty, Jennifer. Because no matter what I do, someone always ends up getting hurt.",
        "Jennifer: What did you do to him? Tell me! Is he hurt? Is he dead? Please, tell me!",
        "Paul: I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: That's Aunt Rose's!",
        "Lily: Yes, it is. Come here! Yeah, I kept a few of her things so we could always remember how much fun she was. She liked pretty things, didn't she? I thought maybe Jade would like some of Rose's things. Right? What do you think?",
        "Faith: I like Jade.",
        "Lily: Yeah, me too.",
        "Faith: Can she stay here forever?",
        "Lily: You never know.",
        "Faith: Can I have a cookie?",
        "Lily: Hmmm, cookie. Yes, you can have a cookie but first you have to have an apple. I mean the whole apple right down to the core. Okay? Go ahead.",
        "Rose: You're such a good mother.",
        "Lily: Rose?",
        "Rose: I'm sorry, Lily. I should've told you about Jade. But I couldn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: Luke!",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. What's wrong?",
        "Kevin: Your dad just ripped my head off.",
        "Luke: What? Why?",
        "Kevin: He found my I.D. outside your house.",
        "Luke: Yeah but I already explained that to him.",
        "Kevin: Well, apparently he wasn't interested in listening to explanations.",
        "Luke: Well, you didn't tell him that you me at the concert, right?",
        "Kevin: Yeah, yeah, I'd do that.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, then, so everything's cool.",
        "Kevin: Are you listening, man? If some other guy wasn't there, he would've nailed me to the wall. I mean, he was like off the charts ballistic.",
        "Luke: Okay, well then we're just going to have to be a little more careful, that's all.",
        "Kevin: No. I can't do this anymore, man.",
        "Luke: What do you mean?",
        "Kevin: I can't risk it. If your father sees me, he's going to kill me, I swear he will.",
        "Luke: So what are you saying?",
        "Kevin: We can't hang out anymore, Luke. I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Before we get into this, I just want to say, bottom line, my son has the right to be whoever he wants to be. I don't get to decide that for him. I don't want to decide that for him. But I do want him to have a full life. I want him to have that chance to be happy, growing up, just like you and I had.",
        "Jack: You don't think he can be happy if he's gay?",
        "Holden: I think that there are lots of people out there who are ready to make it tough for anyone who's different.",
        "Jack: There are a lot of angry people all over this world, Holden. Luke doesn't have to knuckle under to people like that.",
        "Holden: He's with them in school. He's going to be with them in college. He'll be with them when he applies for jobs. It's very tough when you're starting out in the world when you're young. If you had idiots who act like you need to apologize for who you are -- that's not what I want for my son.",
        "Jack: Okay, he's strong. He's a strong kid. He's a smart kid. If he comes across discrimination, he'll rise above it, Holden. He needs the support of his family.",
        "Holden: What about that? Does he want to have a family of his own one day?",
        "Jack: I don't know. I don't know. I'm not saying -- I don't know if he is or if he isn't. But he's young, that's all I'm saying, Holden. He'll figure it out. He needs your help, though.",
        "Holden: And I will help him. I love him. I'd do anything for him.",
        "Jack: Talk to him. Have you talked to him?",
        "Holden: No, I don't want to throw him. If he isn't, I don't want him thinking to himself, \"Why is my dad thinking that I'm gay?\"",
        "Jack: Why is it that you think that he's gay?",
        "Holden: Because he's been very secretive. And I'm not proud of this, but I went into his journal on his computer. His blog. Whatever you want to call it. And he said that there was this secret that he didn't want to tell his folks because he was afraid that we wouldn't understand.",
        "Jack: That could be the drinking.",
        "Holden: Maybe. But I've seen him with Kevin. I've seen the way he looks at him. I saw him giving him a backrub. You know, it wasn't like they were horsing around. They were just -- too close. They spend a lot of time together. And where are the girls, Jack? He's a good looking boy. Tell me, where are the girls?",
        "Jack: Hey, he's not you, okay? He's his own person. Maybe he's just a late bloomer as far as the girls go. You don't know.",
        "Holden: Maybe.",
        "Jack: I'm listening to what you're saying? I am and I gotta tell ya from a cop's perspective. From someone who's as hard-nosed as I am, you got nothing.",
        "Holden: Okay.",
        "Jack: I'm not saying that he's not. I'm not saying that he is. I'm saying that you just got to take a step back and wait and see.",
        "Holden: You're probably right. And I shouldn't have jumped at Kevin like I did.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry about that. He probably just thinks you're upset about the booze.",
        "Holden: I'm just worried that Luke is going to be led the wrong way. You can understand that, right? I guess I just have to let him figure it all out on his own time though.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I guess so. But it seems that's not something you figure out by yourself.",
        "Holden: Bottom line, if Luke is gay it's going to be very hard on him.",
        "Jack: Hey there.",
        "Jade: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What if the judge lets Jennifer drop the charges against Paul? In return for the whole story. Think about it. What happens? All the truth comes out that I shot him and that you took care of him.",
        "Meg: We deny it.",
        "Emily: We deny it? But what if --",
        "Meg: Look, look, look! Nobody's going to believe him, okay? So there's nothing to worry about.",
        "Emily: Why would --",
        "Meg: Emily, I said we deny it. I gotta go.",
        "Emily: That doesn't make any sense. Why would he deny it?",
        "Meg: You know what? That is, like, the millionth \"what if.\" What is your problem?",
        "Emily: I don't have a problem, I'm just a little nervous.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I can see that and I want to know why.",
        "Emily: All right. You spent a lot of time with Paul, day in and day out. You obviously trust him. I mean, I can't seem to figure out why. Where exactly do things stand between the two of you?",
        "Meg: Things?",
        "Emily: Yeah, obviously you're close.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm not discussing this anymore.",
        "Emily: Meg, Meg, wait --",
        "Meg: Let go of me!",
        "Emily: Stop!",
        "Meg: What? You don't want me to go upstairs.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no it's not that. I just don't want to be overheard. There's a lot of people -- Meg, Meg! Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You have to tell me what happened!",
        "Paul: Hal!",
        "Hal: Get her away from me. Please, stop. Get him ready for transport.",
        "Jennifer: Dad, Dad he did something to Dusty, I know he did.",
        "Hal: This is a police investigation, Jennifer. You had no business questioning your brother.",
        "Jennifer: No, but Dusty could be bleeding to death somewhere!",
        "Barbara: What happened?",
        "Hal: Jennifer is understandably frustrated. We all are. But she needs to calm down!",
        "Jennifer: Mom, Paul did something to Dusty. I know he did. I know he did! There's the car. There's blood.",
        "Barbara: What did Paul say?",
        "Jennifer: Nothing! But he's not denying it either and we have the blood samples. We have the car. And Dusty would not disappear on his own. He wouldn't. Someone made him disappear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I knew it! I knew that phone call from Emily was a setup.",
        "Henry: I was -- the door was open, so I --",
        "Meg: What's that in your hand?",
        "Henry: There's nothing in my hand.",
        "Meg: Get out! Both of you get out!",
        "Henry: She has Dusty Donovan's wallet and it's covered in blood.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Henry: Yes, she was hiding it.",
        "Emily: What are you doing with Dusty's wallet?",

        "Announcer: Coming up -- on \"As the World Turns.\"",
        "Jennifer: We are not dropping anything until I find out what happened to Dusty.",
        "Emily: I just saw Meg. She has Dusty's wallet and it has blood all over it. What do you know about that, Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: But he can't make us not be friends.",
        "Kevin: Yes, he can.",
        "Luke: But, Kevin, you're my best friend. I'll talk to my mom about it.",
        "Kevin: What is she gonna do? Handcuff him to the kitchen table? Luke, your father's gonna do what he wants. And what he wants is me gone. He made that very clear.",
        "Luke: That's not fair.",
        "Kevin: I know, it's crazy! I don't even understand what we did. I mean, we got buzzed a couple of times. I mean, it's not like first degree murder. Just don't get it! Look, I'm sorry, man. I really am. I just got to go.",
        "Luke: Whoa, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, wait, wait! I'll talk to him. I will make him understand.",
        "Kevin: Understand what? That we talked? What are you, crazy?",
        "Luke: Well, he can't just make us not hang out.",
        "Kevin: Not even that. We can't even talk on the phone. We can't I.M. I mean, he is a lunatic. I mean, for all I know, he probably had me followed here. Look, all right, I just gotta go.",

        "Holden: This is Jade. This is Rose's daughter that I was telling you about. Jade, I want you to meet my cousin, detective Jack Snyder.",
        "Jack: Jade, it's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. We can talk about Meg and all that other stuff later, okay? I've gotta split. Nice meeting you.",
        "Jade: You, too.",
        "Jack: All righty, be well.",
        "Jade: Bye. I'm sorry. I didn't know anybody was here. I just got back from riding. I came to get something for my horse.",
        "Holden: Is Luke with you?",
        "Jade: No, he -- I'm not a very good rider. I'm just a beginner, really. Anyway, he wanted to stay out a little while longer so he rode me to the edge of the property and then he took off. But, listen, let me get out of your way.",
        "Holden: Wait a minute. How much of that conversation did you hear?",
        "Jade: I heard you tell Detective Snyder that you thought Luke might be gay.",
        "Holden: I'd just as soon Luke not know how I felt.",
        "Jade: No, of course not. I'd never say anything to anybody. And I apologize again for walking in.",
        "Holden: Just so you know, I do love my son.",
        "Jade: I know you do. And he loves you. We were just talking about that. He was telling me about how he's not your biological son, but that you had always treated him like he was. And he really respected you for that. He just doesn't want to let you down.",
        "Holden: Sounds like you guys have been spending a lot of time together.",
        "Jade: He's unbelievable. I've never had a brother or a cousin, as far as that goes. And he's so easy to talk to. He's a really great person.",
        "Holden: Yes, he is. Did he say anything about Kevin? Anything besides what we already spoke about?",
        "Jade: No, not really. We talk about family, mostly. He tells me about my mother, his aunt Rose. And he talks about you and Lily, of course. He'd do anything to make you happy. And I know that it really upsets him, this fight you guys have been having.",
        "Holden: Well, all I want is for him to be happy.",
        "Jade: Maybe I could help you with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Why is he missing?",
        "Barbara: Honey, I don't know where he is. But wherever he is, your brother is not responsible. Now, your brother may be many things. He may be nasty. At times, manipulative.",
        "Jennifer: No, Mom? Mom, Paul wanted something. He wanted my forgiveness. That's why he stayed in Oakdale, despite the fact that there was a warrant out for his arrest. And I was willing. You remember that? When we thought he was dead, I wanted to be able to forgive him. But Dusty was against it. And Paul must have known that. Paul must have figured that out. He knew that Dusty would try to convince me to press charges. And then they must've found each other and argued and then Paul did something. That's the only explanation!",
        "Barbara: Honey, I don't even know what to say to you.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, there is only one person who knows what happened in that motel room, and he's not talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What are you doing with Dusty's wallet?",
        "Meg: Dusty and I used to live together, all right?",
        "Henry: Okay, what's with the blood?",
        "Meg: It's not blood. It's stained. It's an old wallet and I kept it because I still have feelings -- you know what, this is none of your business. So why don't you get out before I call security?",
        "Henry: Sorry we bothered you. Em?",
        "[They leave the room]",
        "Emily: What are you -- Henry?",
        "Henry: She's lying, sweetheart. I didn't see any dates, but it was definitely his license. It was his credit cards. And I am certain that it was covered in blood.",
        "Emily: I gotta go.",
        "Henry: Wait a minute, Em?",
        "Emily: I'll call you, okay? Thank you, Henry. Good-bye.",
        "Henry: What about my money?",
        "Meg: That was too easy. They could be calling the cops. This body can stand tall...",
        "Rose: I can't believe you kept this one. The first time I wore this dress, Jimmy Antonelli took me down the shore. We drank beer. We ate clams. We spent every single penny that he had trying to win this big teddy bear at the arcade. He shot holes in everything but the plates. We had to hitch a ride home with his cousin.",
        "Lily: Why are you here?",
        "Rose: Hey, you got my kid sleeping down the hallway. You didn't expect me?",
        "Lily: Well, if she is yours, and I believe that she is yours, she reminds me so much of you. Why didn't you tell me about her?",
        "Rose: I couldn't.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Rose: Because. You know me, Lil. I don't like to talk about stuff. Come on.",
        "Lily: This is your child we're talking about.",
        "Rose: Who I gave up. Okay? I'm going to tell you? The best mother in the world?",
        "Lily: I never would have judged you.",
        "Rose: I judged me. It killed me -- having to give her up. I don't want to think about it. So every single night, I would just pray. Pray that she was happy and healthy. Come on, she was better off without me, anyway.",
        "Lily: No, Rose. No one. No one is better off without you.",
        "Rose: Don't make me start bawling, all right?",
        "Lily: Okay. I understand the kind of pressure you were under. You did what you had to do, but don't you for one second think that your daughter would not want to know you. That's why I wanted her to have one of your dresses so she could get a sense of who you were and how wonderful you were.",
        "Rose: So what's she like?",
        "Lily: She's lovely. She's sweet and polite and sensitive.",
        "Rose: I thought you said she was just like me.",
        "Lily: She's strong and brave and independent.",
        "Rose: And she'd wear something like this?",
        "Lily: She'd love it.",
        "Rose: Good. But no twin sets. No collars, no pumps. All right? My girl, she's got to have a little style with confidence.",
        "Lily: She has that.",
        "Rose: That's good.",
        "Lily: God, I miss you so much.",
        "Rose: Hey. You promised. And the kids? They like her?",
        "Lily: Oh, you're kidding. Faith loves her. She just asked me if she could stay here forever. And Luke is teaching her how to ride.",
        "Rose: And Lucinda?",
        "Lily: Oh, well, that's going to take a little while.",
        "Rose: That's good.",
        "Lily: Good?",
        "Rose: Yeah. It's good to see some things never change.",
        "Lily: And Holden. He's still a little cautious.",
        "Rose: He'll warm up. That's just the way he is. He can't help himself. [Rose disappears]",
        "Lily: Oh, I can just see you in this dress. [Lily looks up and Rose is gone]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: If there was something that could become a problem, maybe -- I don't know. Maybe I could tell you about it. And I'm not saying that I would spy on him.",
        "Holden: No, no. Of course not.",
        "Jade: Just, if there was something where you could help, I know you'd want to know.",
        "Holden: I understand that Luke has told Kevin to stay away from him. But Kevin has this stubborn streak. So if he starts bothering Luke --",
        "Jade: Yeah, I wouldn't want that, either. I don't want Luke to -- to feel pressured.",
        "Holden: No, no.",
        "Jade: He's such a nice guy. People can take advantage.",
        "Holden: Yeah, and that's my concern. Thank you.",
        "Jade: Please, Mr. Snyder. I'd do anything for Luke or for any of you.",
        "Holden: You know what, you don't have to call me Mr. Snyder, okay?",
        "Jade: Okay. Holden, then?",
        "Holden: Yeah. All right, I'm going to head back to the house. Can I give you a ride?",
        "Jade: No, I still need to curry my horse. Every time I say that, I picture this huge horse on a bed of rice. I was looking for the comb.",
        "Holden: Here you go. All right, I'll see you at the house.",
        "Jade: Okay, see you at home.",
        "Holden: Jade, I'm glad that we had this talk.",
        "Jade: Me, too. Your dad was just here.",
        "Luke: I know. I was waiting for him to leave.",
        "Jade: Why? What's wrong?",
        "Luke: Everything. He's ruined everything.",

        "Hal: I have nothing to say to you.",
        "Paul: Just look after Jennifer.",
        "Hal: And make sure his restraints are secure.",
        "Jennifer: Where is he going?",
        "Hal: You shouldn't have come down here, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: No, Dad, I need to see him.",
        "Hal: Well, you can't. Not until he's been arraigned, which I'm trying to get done as soon as possible.",
        "Barbara: Hal, please let me talk to him first. I can get through to him.",
        "Hal: And why is that, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Because I'm his mother. And I believe he's innocent.",
        "Hal: Well, at the very least, you're misinformed.",
        "Barbara: Hal, Paul couldn't kill anyone. Even you have to admit that.",
        "Hal: This better be official business, Emily.",
        "Emily: I'm here because I heard Paul has been arrested.",
        "Hal: Well, if you'd all clear the room so the guy can get on the phone with the D.A. and get this show on the road, then you can all have your chance to visit the prisoner. Now if you'll excuse me.",
        "Cop 2: Excuse me, Lieutenant. Paul Ryan is secured. And we should have those forensic reports on Donavan soon.",
        "Emily: Donovan? Wait, Dusty? Did something happen to Dusty?",
        "Hal: Nothing that concerns you, Emily.",
        "Emily: Of course it concerns me. He's a friend of mine. I'd like to know if something's happened to him.",

        "Lily: You don't mind?",
        "Holden: Why would I?",
        "Lily: I don't know. You just seem very unsure of Jade.",
        "Holden: Well, I've been talking to her. Been watching her with the kids. Been watching her with Luke. She's getting riding lessons, by the way.",
        "Lily: I know, I know, I know.",
        "Holden: She has a lot going on. She seems to pick up on things that people don't normally pick up on. Would you like a bite?",
        "Lily: You're in a -- quit -- you're in a very good mood.",
        "Holden: Your daughter informed me that I need to eat this apple before I can eat a cookie. I need to eat it all the way to the core.",
        "Lily: I know. I see. Mm-hmm.",
        "Holden: Why don't you help me out, because you know that I have a sweet tooth?",

        "Luke: My father scared him so much that he won't see me anymore. He told me not to call him. It's over.",
        "Jade: I'd give it a day or two.",
        "Luke: You don't know Kevin -- his issues that he has with his own father. His father drinks. He hit him, or he used to, but -- but when people get angry at him, Kevin gets scared. He freaks. He can't deal with it, so he just cuts people off. That's it.",
        "Jade: But you didn't make him feel that way.",
        "Luke: No. I was the only one that he could talk to about his dad and other stuff. And now I'm supposed to pretend that he doesn't even exist.",
        "Jade: It'll be okay.",
        "Luke: No. No, it won't. You don't understand.",
