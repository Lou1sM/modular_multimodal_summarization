        "Brad wants to take over Katie's show now that she has a black eye and should not appear on camera. Katie tries to convince Kim to ignore her bruised face, but Kim agrees to let Brad run the show. Lily snaps at Holden again. The women from Valley's Best Baby Food scout the Farm. Craig convinces Meg to let him help her move more stuff to the motel. Vienna deduces Henry is still in love with Katie; she also learns they were married, but he made the ultimate sacrifice when he let her go. This is a huge turn on for her, and she now sees Henry through different eyes, as she throws herself at him. Jack asks Brad to cut Katie some slack. Holden questions Meg's decisions about Craig. Lily and Craig talk business again. The baby food women ask to use the Farm in commercials (a bit more money involved) and want Lily as their spokesperson. Paul and Meg bump into each other and Paul takes a casual approach to her, which surprises Meg. He later admits his feelings to Lily. Vienna becomes obsessed with Henry suddenly. Katie takes pleasure in telling Brad that Vienna is gone, which causes him to snap at her saying harsh things to her. Jack comes down on Brad for this. Brad wonders what Katie means to him, as Katie secretly listens. Lily worries about being in a commercial adding pounds, and she pops more diet pills. Paul has a vision off of the teddy bear Meg touched; it is a crib and someone takes something out of it and then there is a blood- curdling scream."

        "Kim: Okay, we'll put the coach here. Katie in the middle, Brad on the other side.",
        "Jack: Won't Brad be asking most of the questions?",
        "Kim: Yeah. He will be, but Katie's the money shot. So, where are they?",
        "Jack: Brad's in make-up, and Katie hasn't shown yet.",
        "Kim: You're kidding. She's never late.",
        "Brad: Are you calling Katie?",
        "Kim: Are you sure? Nobody's heard from her?",
        "Brad: I wouldn't count on her showing up today.",
        "Kim: Why not?",
        "Brad: Well, I saw yesterday. She's a little blue.",
        "Kim: She's depressed?",
        "Brad: No, no. She's a little black and blue. She had a run in with a moving object.",
        "Kim: Oh, my gosh. She's had an accident?",
        "Brad: Oh, no, no. Nothing major, but not to worry. I mean, I've got this interview covered, okay? I can do it without Katie. Don't even worry about it.",
        "Katie: I'm here! I'm here. No worries. Sorry I'm late. I was doing my make-up at home, but I am ready to go. Are we ready?",
        "Kim: Uh, almost. Let me see this. Oh, my gosh, Honey. What happened to you?",
        "Katie: Nothing, it's just a teeny, tiny little bruise. Hardly noticeable.",
        "Kim: Are you kidding? It's huge. You can't go on camera like that.",

        "Henry: Vienna? What are you doing?",
        "Vienna: Trying to get warm. I'm so cold. Aren't you cold?",
        "Henry: No, actually, I'm a little hot at the moment. Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Oh, good. Good. Then, you can get out there in the fresh air and take a hike.",
        "Henry: Ah, ah, ah. You must have mistaken me for someone else. I don't hike.",
        "Vienna: No, we need gas Henry. And food. What, were you planning to let us starve out here?",
        "Henry: First I had to find a gas station and now I have to find one with a mini-mart?",
        "Vienna: Whatever, just go.",
        "Henry: Okay, while I'm out there hiking around on the frozen tundra, what will you be doing?",

        "Miranda: Oh, and your baby is just adorable.",
        "Lily: You girls make baby food. You think all babies are adorable.",
        "Together: No, we don't.",
        "Phyllis: We actually tested our strained carrot recipe at a local day-care center, and let's just say it wasn't pretty.",
        "Holden: Lily, I was --",
        "Lily: Holden, this is Phyllis and Miranda. This is my husband, Holden.",
        "Miranda: A pleasure. You grew up on this beautiful farm?",
        "Holden: I did.",
        "Phyllis: Oh, so you had the benefit of all that fresh produce. It really paid off.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Lily: Phyllis and Miranda are the founders of Valley's Best Baby Food. The start-up company I told you about.",
        "Holden: Oh, okay, nice to meet you guys.",
        "Lily: Yeah, they're out here at the farm, scouting, possible going to use the farm for shooting some print ads, catalogues.",
        "Holden: I thought that --",
        "Lily: Are you ready to see the rest of the place?",
        "Miranda: We can hardly wait.",
        "Lily: Good. Well, there's plenty to see.",
        "Holden: Do you want me to give the baby his bottle?",
        "Lily: Oh, no. I said I would do that.",
        "Phyllis: Oh, we could show ourselves around, if that's all right?",
        "Lily: Sure, that's fine. Yeah. There's lots to see. Come, come on outside. The stables are right past the barn. And there's a growth and a beautiful pond right out that way.",
        "Miranda: We'll get some digital shots of possible set-ups while we're at it.",
        "Lily: Great. I'll meet up with you in a few minutes.",
        "Phyllis: Yeah, take your time.",

        "Lily: Well, you have things to do for your mother. And I said I would take care of it.",
        "Holden: I thought Lucinda cut the shoe-strings on the baby food thing. How'd you get her to release the funds --?",
        "Lily: You don't think I can handle my job and my son? Why don't you just let me do that without grilling me about every single thing?",

        "Craig: Hey.",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Craig: Hi.",
        "Meg: Hi.",
        "Craig: So, did you finally take my advice and quit this job?",
        "Meg: I happen to like my waitressing job. And I especially like my manager who just gave me some time off.",
        "Craig: Really? Time off for what?",
        "Meg: Just to pick up a few more of my things from the farm. And that way I don't have to wait till tonight when Holden will probably be around. I don't want him getting all brotherly on me.",
        "Craig: Me neither. Because he'll probably tell you to run screaming from my clutches.",
        "Meg: Yeah, probably.",
        "Craig: Will you take his advice?",
        "Meg: Probably not.",
        "Craig: Well in that case, I'll help you move.",
        "Meg: Oh -- for the two-thousandth time, I don't need your help right now.",
        "Craig: No, but I'm already dressed for it, and I just happen to be driving a very large vehicle perfect for hauling.",
        "Meg: Okay, it's not necessary. I'm just picking up some spring clothes -- you just happen to be driving a very large vehicle.",
        "Craig: Yeah, what are the odds?",
        "Meg: What did you do?",
        "Craig: What? Look, the two of us working together, we'll get done twice as fast. So, how long is your break?",
        "Meg: If find out that you had anything to do with me getting this time off --",
        "Craig: Then you'll kiss me?",
        "Meg: I will be so mad that I won't ever kiss you. Ever, never. So, did you do something, Craig? Tell me the truth.",
        "Craig: Well, I can handle the truth, but just exactly how long is never, ever?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mom, it's important so please just call me. Excuse me, do you know Barbara Ryan?",
        "Bartender: Oh, charming lady. She has breakfast here regularly.",
        "Paul: Charming. I'm her son, and I'm trying it get in touch with her. Has she been in today?",
        "Bartender: No, Sir. But she's usually been in by now.",
        "Paul: That's Mom. Never around when I need her, and always around when I don't.",
        "Bartender: Do you want a drink while you wait?",
        "Paul: No, no, no. This can't wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Why do I even bother?",
        "Craig: Well, because if we do it now, then you'll have time later so that you can have dinner with me. I'm lonely.",
        "Meg: You're a nut.",
        "Craig: So, what's it going to be? Now or later?",
        "Meg: Now. Only because I don't want to deal with my brother.",
        "Craig: Good. Good. And then we can have a nice little, cozy meal at my place. And I'll have the chef. He'll prepare all of your favorite foods.",
        "Meg: You don't know my favorite foods.",
        "Craig: Right, and then after that, we'll have a little sleepover. And I can have my favorite thing.",
        "Meg: I am not moving in with you.",
        "Craig: What, you think that offer's still on the table?",
        "Meg: It's not?",
        "Craig: No, you turned me down. Quite emphatically, I remember. Yeah, and you tossed me aside with my mansion because you prefer living a hovel.",
        "Meg: The Wagon Wheel Motel is not a hovel, it's an antique.",
        "Craig: It's a dump! But I accept your decision. And I'm only here as your friend to carry out your wishes and your boxes. So, shall we?",
        "Meg: I can do it myself.",
        "Craig: No, I know. But I'm willing to be your pack mule. And you can ride in my very large vehicle.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Okay, can I drive?",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah.",
        "Meg: Okay. Come on mule. Wagon's ho!",
        "Craig: And then after, you'll thank me and give me a kiss?",
        "Meg: Never, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I need to get out of this country. I need to get to an airport or I'll lose every penny to my name.",
        "Henry: Hey, hey. A few more hours, it won't make any difference. And we'll just wait for a few more cars to get on the road, and then I'll hitch a ride to the nearest gas station.",
        "Vienna: I need to get an airport now. I don't have a couple of hours.",
        "Henry: Okay, fine. If it's that important to you, why don't I just see if I've got enough juice here to call 911.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no. You can't call the police. They'll extradite me.",
        "Henry: Oh, well.",
        "Vienna: I'm sure that if that little kitty cat would have asked you to go out in that cold, you would, wouldn't you?",
        "Henry: Katie would brave the cold for me, too.",
        "Vienna: Henry, you've got to save me before the prince gets here and takes me back to Leonia and throws me in jail.",
        "Henry: I'll get right on that. Right after my nap.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you wouldn't take a nap before you would go and save little black- eyed Katie, would you?",
        "Henry: Katie's eyes aren't black.",
        "Vienna: No, one of them are. You know, she has a big black ring around it and it's puffy and all nasty --",
        "Henry: A black eye? A black eye? Are talking about a black eye? Katie has a black eye?",
        "Vienna: Yes.",
        "Henry: What happened? Did you hit her?",
        "Vienna: What? No, and bruise my beautiful hands?",
        "Henry: Then what happened? Is she okay?",
        "Vienna: Well, maybe you should walk to a gas station and find out. Call her.",
        "Henry: I got one bar on this thing, maybe there's enough power to work this baby.",
        "Vienna: Oh, oh, maybe you can call for a backup limo!",
        "Henry: Come on Bubbles, pick up.",
        "Vienna: Bubbles? You're calling Katie?",
        "Henry: Shh, shh, shush. Katie, Katie, this is Henry. I just heard about your eye. Would you call me as soon as you get this message and let me know that you're okay, please? Thanks Bubbles. What?",
        "Vienna: What does Katie have that I don't?",
        "Henry: Well, blond hair, and infectious personality, and a wonderful laugh, and an unbelievable body, well, you got that one covered. But she's got a little cottage in the woods, and this very sweet rabbit -- and she can't cook, but it's so cute when she thinks that she can --",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God. She totally has your heart, doesn't she? You're in love with her!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Kim, I can do this. I'll have Anna in makeup put some extra pancake makeup on it. I'll be as good as new.",
        "Brad: Oh, come on. You put more makeup on that thing, you're going to start sweating underneath these hot lights. And the makeup's going to run, and that will not be pretty.",
        "Katie: Since when are you an expert?",
        "Brad: Okay, look. The coach only has a small window for the interview, right? I mean, then he's got to catch a plane or something?",
        "Kim: Yes, yes, you're right. And besides, it would take forever to make that black eye not look like a black eye, if it's even possible.",
        "Katie: Of course, it's possible. Anything's possible. It'll only take a few minutes. And then I'll keep my bad eye away from the camera.",
        "Brad: You think the viewers are going to not notice if they only see one eye? You're going to get calls. You're going to get letters. I mean, come on. You know with Katie, she's got marital problems --",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: And people will think that she's a battered wife or something --",
        "Katie: Oh, come on. Don't listen to him, Kim. That is ridiculous --",
        "Kim: I'm not -- I'm listening to my own good sense. And Honey, you look like you were on the losing end of a fight.",
        "Katie: Okay, we can postpone a little bit. By tomorrow, the swelling will be down or the next day.",
        "Kim: Do you have idea how lucky we were to get this coach? This interview feeds into all of our March Madness promos. We have to shoot and air it today.",
        "Brad: I can handle it on my own. Sports is my area. Look, don't worry. You wouldn't even notice that Katie is gone.",
        "Katie: Sports is my area, too. I love sports! Actually, do you know how I got this? I was at a hockey game.",
        "Kim: Really?",
        "Katie: Yes, we could use that. The fans will love it. I'll tell them all about how the puck-thingy hit me in the eye and it was like crazy. I was yelling and screaming --",
        "Kim: These are the coach's stats.",
        "Katie: Kim!",
        "Kim: Familiarize yourself with them. I call you when we're ready to shoot.",
        "Brad: Okay.",
        "Kim: Okay?",
        "Brad: You got to be careful with the puck-thingies.",
        "Kim: Just go.",
        "Katie: Kim, this was my story. And now Brad's taking over again.",
        "Kim: Honey, he's done interviews without you. You've done interviews without him. Now, we have several pre-taped promo things with you. We'll just slot them in.",
        "Katie: So, you don't need me at all?",
        "Kim: You know what? There's plenty of preparation to do for next week. Why don't you just take a break, get some ice on your eye, and then we'll talk later about next week, okay?",
        "Katie: No, you'll need me tomorrow.",
        "Kim: Well, we'll see how you're doing. Listen, I'm sorry. I've got to make these changes in today's air show. I'll talk to you later, okay?",
        "Brad: Aren't you going to tell me to break a leg?",
        "Katie: I wish I could break it for you.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Brad: Hey, hey, Bro! Hey, you come to watch me do my TV thingy?",
        "Jack: Can I talk to you?",
        "Brad: Yeah, sure, what's up?",
        "Jack: I saw what happened with Katie. This show means a lot to her, Brad.",
        "Brad: Tell me about it. That chick is way too intense.",
        "Jack: Yeah, maybe. But she's had a rough time lately.",
        "Brad: So?",
        "Jack: So, I want you to go easy on her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I just don't understand why you keep criticizing me.",
        "Holden: How does asking a simple question suddenly become criticism?",
        "Lily: Did my mother, has she been tattling on me?",
        "Holden: Lily, come on.",
        "Lily: What did she say this time? That I'm being irresponsible with my division?",
        "Holden: What do you think? Your mom and I are having secret meetings behind your back? Why would you even go there?",
        "Lily: Because it seems like every time I turn around -- every time I turn around, you're questioning my judgment.",
        "Holden: All I did was question how you handled Faith. One time.",
        "Lily: And I made one mistake with Faith. And now you think that I'm not able to handle any other part of my life.",
        "Holden: I was just making conversation. It wasn't an accusation. Why are you getting so upset?",
        "Lily: I'm just tense. That's all.",
        "Holden: All right. Then sit down. Let me help you out.",
        "Lily: Oh, that feels good. Will you marry me?",
        "Holden: As many times as you like. So, how'd you do it?",
        "Lily: A little to the left.",
        "Holden: How did you get Lucinda to release funds for this baby food project?",
        "Lily: You know, the usual way. Every company has discretionary funds. And I just found mine and I made them work.",
        "Holden: Yeah, where'd you find them?",
        "Lily: Did you hear something? I think Phyllis and Miranda are back. I'm going to check.",
        "Meg: Oh, hey.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Meg: I just came to get some of my stuff. Craig drove me. Stay here. I'll be right back.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Lily: How are you?",
        "Craig: I'm good. You?",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Craig: Good. Good to hear. So, how's business?",
        "Meg: Look, I'm a grown woman. If I want to move out of my mother's house, that is my business. Why are you even here? You're supposed to be working.",
        "Holden: Oh, okay. I guess that explains why you've been avoiding me.",
        "Meg: Look, I am sick of the way I'm living my life. And the last thing I want to do is talk about it with you.",
        "Holden: Me? Why?",
        "Meg: Okay, you want to hash this out. Fine. Great. Okay, let's lay it out. I'm responsible for a patient's death. I am not a nurse anymore. And I'm a disappointment to everyone.",
        "Holden: Not to me, you're not.",
        "Meg: Well, to me, then. Look, I need to be on my own, okay?",
        "Holden: Okay. All right. Fine, if you don't want to talk about it, we won't talk about it.",
        "Meg: Thanks.",
        "Holden: But we are going to talk about why you've hooked up with Craig Montgomery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You're actually worried about Katie? Why? That chick, she's as tough as nails.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and you're stabbing her in the back.",
        "Brad: Did she tell you that?",
        "Jack: I saw you, Brad. You were playing Kim and make Katie feel like she's being pushed out of her own job.",
        "Brad: Look, I am just sticking up for myself. Hey, man, don't let that kewpie doll fool you. She has tried every dirty trick in the book to get me out of here.",
        "Jack: My heart bleeds. Listen, you've been around the block a few times. And we both know Katie is no match for you. So, play nice.",
        "Brad: Is that an order?",
        "Jack: I'm asking you as a favor, okay? Ease up.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Brad: You really like this girl?",
        "Jack: I've got to take this. No, she's a friend of mine.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. I'll ease up on her.",
        "Jack: Thank you very much. Snyder.",
        "Stage manager: Ten minutes, Brad.",
        "Brad: Thanks.",
        "Jack: I'll call the judge. No problem. All right. Bye.",
        "Brad: Hey, hey, when you're done with your business, why don't you watch me light up the screen.",
        "Jack: Later, if I can cut away?",
        "Brad: Yeah. Sure. All right. Later.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Stage manager: Audio's ready to mike you.",
        "Brad: Yeah, okay. Yeah. Let's get this puppy started, all right? Forget Oakdale Now. Today, it's the Brad Snyder Show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Well, I thought that your relationship with Katie was strictly platonic. Whatever that means.",
        "Henry: It means no sex. There's hugging often, kissing sometimes, strong shoulder in times of trouble always. But no sex. No sex at all.",
        "Vienna: Katie, she's no fun.",
        "Henry: Yes she is.",
        "Vienna: How much fun can no sex be? I mean, I don't understand this girl. We were sisters in heartbreak. And I reached out for her and tried to be friends. And she kept pushing me away.",
        "Henry: Know, I know, I know. She does that to people sometimes. She pushes them away. But she doesn't do it to be mean. Look, she's sweet and she's brave and she's delusional sometimes, but she does whatever she does for love.",
        "Vienna: Oh, just like me.",
        "Henry: Yes, I guess I don't know you very well.",
        "Vienna: Well, so, if you're in love with her like this, why don't you just tell her so?",
        "Henry: I did. Before the marriage, and after the marriage, and after the divorce --",
        "Vienna: You were married? Well, what happened?",
        "Henry: She wanted Mike more.",
        "Vienna: And so you stepped aside?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I wanted her to be happy.",
        "Vienna: You sacrificed yourself for her happiness? Oh, that is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, it's not that beautiful. I mean, since she didn't want me anyway.",
        "Vienna: Oh, even though your heart was breaking, even though the one you loved threw you aside, you put her happiness above your own.",
        "Henry: I guess that makes me sound pretty pitiful, doesn't it?",
        "Vienna: No, no, not pitiful. Wonderful and romantic and irresistible.",
        "Henry: Irresistible, trust me. Many people have tried to resist me and succeeded.",
        "Vienna: Oh, idiots, idiots, all of them. You are the real thing. You are the man that every woman craves. I'm amazed that you haven't been snatched up all ready.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, always the bridesmaid, never the bride.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you should be the bride!",
        "Henry: I should?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, you should be the one that everyone fusses over. The one that has a happy ending. You deserve love, Henry.",

        "Holden: Don't you have enough trouble in your life?",
        "Meg: Evidently not. On top of everything else, I've got to get lectures from my big brother on how dangerous Craig is.",
        "Holden: Meg, don't do it. Don't move in with the guy.",
        "Meg: I'm not moving in with Craig. Why would you even think that?",
        "Holden: Because he's here, and you're packing your things up.",
        "Meg: He's driving me. I'm staying at the Wagon Wheel now.",
        "Holden: The Wagon Wheel? That place is a dump.",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah. I've heard. You know, is there anywhere else I could go that you approve of?",
        "Holden: Why not here? Stay here at the farm.",
        "Meg: You know where to find me.",
        "Holden: You know what? Stay with me and Lily. We've got plenty of room.",
        "Meg: You've got four kids. The last thing you and Lily need is a houseguest.",
        "Holden: You are my sister.",
        "Meg: I know you're trying to help. But I need to be on my own. Okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: Why, then? Why?",
        "Meg: Because I'm too afraid to stay.",
        "Holden: Too afraid to stay? That makes no sense.",
        "Meg: If I don't change now, I never will. I've spent my whole life living with people so I wouldn't have to stand on my own two feet. I did it in my marriage, I did it with Dusty, with Paul -- and now, I'm on my own and I mean it to stay that way. I've got a job, a room, a brother I can call whenever I need some help?",
        "Holden: Always. I don't understand why Craig is with you. Why does he need to be in this life of yours now?",
        "Meg: He wants to be my friend. And I could really use one right now, so I'm letting him.",

        "Lily: Yup. It was easy. It was perfect.",
        "Craig: And Lucinda didn't pick up on it?",
        "Lily: No. No, not yet. I mean, I hate hiding things from my mother, but moving that money around was definitely the right thing to do. Because the baby food product line is going to be a huge success for Worldwide. Hey!",
        "Phyllis: Lily, we absolutely love this place!",
        "Lily: Oh, Phyllis, Miranda. This is my friend, Craig Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Hi, how are you? I've heard wonderful things about your enterprise.",
        "Miranda: Oh, thank you. We couldn't have done any of it without Lily. And we had a great idea while we were walking around. Instead of just using this place for print ads, why don't we shoot a commercial here?",
        "Lily: A commercial?",
        "Phyllis: Yes, we know it's a little more expensive than we had planned. But with the horses and all the beautiful trees --",
        "Miranda: And that pond.",
        "Phyllis: What do you think?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Miranda: And one more thing. We would love it if you would be our spokesperson, Lily. The face of the product.",
        "Lily: Me?",
        "Craig: That's a great idea.",
        "Phyllis: Yeah, you've got that beautiful wholesome look, and with your baby.",

        "Lily: Oh, I have a marketing budget to consider.",
        "Miranda: Oh, if your mother-in-law won't charge you to use this place, and if you won't charge us too much to be our star --",
        "Phyllis: And I already called the art director that we hired. And he said if you give us the go-ahead, we could shoot right away.",
        "Miranda: Please, Lily? We really want you to be our spokesperson.",
        "Lily: Just give me a chance to look at some numbers, and I'll call you tonight.",
        "Phyllis: Oh, thank you. Thank you.",
        "Miranda: Your mother's going to love seeing you and Ethan on a national commercial.",
        "Lily: Um, maybe. Maybe.",
        "Miranda: We'll go and let you think.",
        "Phyllis: Oh, it was nice meeting you.",
        "Craig: Nice meeting you, too. And I can see why Lily speaks so highly of you. You have wonderful ideas.",
        "Phyllis: Well, thank you. All right, bye-bye.",
        "Lily: Bye.",
        "Miranda: Remember, you'll be perfect.",
        "Lily: Thanks.",
        "Craig: Bye. You should do it.",
        "Lily: Oh, a commercial is a lot more expensive than print ads.",
        "Craig: So what? You already know how to move the funds around, it's just a matter of writing a bigger check.",
        "Lily: When my mother finds out --",
        "Craig: Don't worry about Lucinda. She won't know how much you've invested until after that baby food is flying off the shelves. And by then, what's happened will be moot because Lucinda never argues with a big profit. Not that the woman needs or deserves to make any more money.",
        "Lily: Really, it gets to you? Helping my mother make money, a profit?",
        "Craig: I just remind myself that I'm helping you and not her.",
        "Lily: Thank you. I appreciate all your help. I really do.",
        "Meg: Hey. Can you take this to the truck?",
        "Craig: Sure. Sure. Is this it? I'll meet you out there in a minute.",
        "Craig: Sure. See ya.",

        "Lily: Or my mother.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Can you do me a favor? Can you work on him for me a little bit? Convince him that I'm a grown woman and I can take care of myself?",
        "Lily: Give me a couple of decades. Just be happy. Okay?",
        "Meg: I'm working on it. Time to grow up and move on.",

        "Meg: So, you can just stop following me around. Stop seeing me?",
        "Paul: No, that's not what I'm doing. I brought a gift. It's not for you. Is Jack here?",

        "Meg: Paul --",
        "Paul: And I know you said at the Wagon Wheel that you don't want me, but I don't care. And I didn't come here to bother you. Honestly. As lovely as it is to see you, I didn't expect it.",

        "Lily: It must be difficult for you. Seeing Meg with Craig.",
        "Paul: I just wanted to make sure Faith got her bracelet back. And, I brought a book for Parker, if Jack will allow him to accept it.",

        "Lily: I just want you to know that I'm very grateful for what you did. You saved Faith's life, so you are welcome in my home anytime.",
        "Paul: Thanks. I was holding on to the bracelet, because I thought that somehow it would bring Meg back to me. But then I woke up this morning, and knew right away that I had to bring it back to Faith, you know? I didn't want to do it, myself. I tracked down my mom to try and get her to drop it off.",
        "Lily: Well, that's understandable.",
        "Paul: You know, and then I went to the bookstore. I talked to the book guy about recommending a book for Parker -- something that he might enjoy, and then -- 'cause I wanted, when I got here, for it to be -- well, I didn't want you to assume that it was all about Meg. But -- it is all about Meg, I know. It always is. Anyway, I hope Parker enjoys the book.",

        "Brad: You know what, I did my job! That's what I did. And what you're doing right now, you know, it's just tacky. You can't hold onto your man, so you've got to dump on everybody else's love life? You know what, get a life of your own and leave mine alone! Hi, Ladies. And by ladies, I mean blondes.",

        "Henry: Yeah, Vienna -- Vienna, I'm flattered that you thought so much of our close encounter to draw that lovely heart on the window, but you don't have to go overboard, Sweetheart. It's okay.",
        "Vienna: No, but I mean it! I mean it.",
        "Henry: You hardly know me.",
        "Vienna: No, but I'm going to love to getting to know you. I'm going to love to get to know every little millimeter of my big, bad lover man.",

        "Vienna: No, no, no. I don't care about them anymore. I want you.",

        "Vienna: It is true!",
        "Henry: Hey, no, no, no, no. Even if that were true -- even if that were true, we've got to get you to the airport, or else the Prince will find you. He will put you in jail, and he will take away all your money. Now, now -- how are you going to feel about loving me when we are living below the poverty line?",
        "Vienna: Hmm.",
