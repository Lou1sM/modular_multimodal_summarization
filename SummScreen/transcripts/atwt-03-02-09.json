        "Vienna wants to push full steam ahead with plans to be Katie's surrogate, but Katie is still not sure. Brad asks for Henry's help filling out paperwork to start adoption proceedings; he doesn't want to push Katie yet, but when she is ready, he wants to be all set. Katie finally talks to Brad about their other options, as Brad thinks she is talking about adoption and Katie thinks he is talking about surrogacy. They have their signals crossed, but finally they understand what each is talking about. Brad is unsure and worried about Vienna carrying a baby for nine months and giving to them, as Katie tries to get him to see she would like to go this route first because it is the closest option to giving him their own baby. Brad finally agrees, but reminds her that Henry has to be on board too. Vienna talks to Henry about helping Brad and Katie, as their signals get crossed too, and he thinks she is just talking about adoption paperwork while she thinks he realizes what she wants to do. Finally, they also understand what each other wants to do, as Henry is not on board at all at first, but Vienna can be convincing. Henry and Vienna come over to Brad and Katie's with news that they are all on the same page. Katie and Vienna are thrilled, as Brad and Henry look much more unsure. Luke continues to push Elwood about what he knows and even reveals about knowing about \u0091M'. Later, an anxious Elwood calls Luke and wants to meet to tell him what he knows. Kevin and Noah hear this; Noah worries about Luke's involvement, but Luke is adamant they have to do this for Casey, as Noah wants to go with him. Luke tells Alison, who in turn happily tells Matt, thinking he is about to be cleared. Luke and Noah show up to meet Elwood, and as they see him walking towards them, an SUV drives towards him knocking Elwood over the bridge. Despite Luke and Noah's efforts, Elwood dies. When Margo questions them, Noah is able to remember part of the plate. Mark Vero is back from the psychiatric hospital and when he sees Alison, he approaches her to apologize. Mark seems stuck on Alison, which doesn't go unnoticed by Kevin when they meet; he reminds him Alison would never be interested in him because he tried to rape her. Matt is late to meet Alison and explains that his car was stolen. Luke and Noah break the bad news to Casey about how Elwood is dead. Alison brings Matt into fill out a report, as she goes into talk with Casey, Luke and Noah. She learns the bad news, but then Margo tells them that the car, which drove at Elwood, was traced to Matt. No one can figure out how he knew where they were meeting until they realize Alison told him. Alison still defends Matt until she realizes he is no longer at the station. An emotional Alison angrily wonders if Casey is waiting for an \u0091I told you so'. Casey wants to comfort her, but he pulls back and doesn't."

        "Katie: Hello, hi.",
        "Salesgirl: Hi. How may I help you?",
        "Katie: I'm looking for someone -- Vienna Hyatt? She said she'd be here. Have you seen her?",
        "Vienna: I'm right here.",
        "Katie: Are you all right?",
        "Vienna: Yes, of course I am. Why do you ask?",
        "Katie: Your message, it sounded so urgent.",
        "Vienna: It is urgent. I wanted to show you this.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Vienna: This.",
        "Katie: Your blouse?",
        "Vienna: What do you think?",
        "Katie: It's fine -- it's not your usual style.",
        "Vienna: Why do you say that?",
        "Katie: It doesn't really flatter your amazing figure.",
        "Vienna: Well, not yet. But it will. Isn't it fabulous?",
        "Katie: What do you mean, it will?",
        "Vienna: See, it's a maternity blouse. The baby will fit right under here.",
        "Katie: What baby?",
        "Vienna: What baby? The baby I'm going to carry for you, as your surrogate. Being pregnant doesn't mean that you can't be fashionable.",
        "Katie: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Vienna, aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself -- trying on maternity-wear when I haven't even agreed to anything yet?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but you will.",
        "Katie: How do you know?",
        "Vienna: Because there's nothing else you and Brad want more than a baby. And I'm the answer to your prayers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I am so glad to see you.",
        "Henry: Hey, when the big guy calls, I come a-running.",
        "Brad: Henry, you are the best friend a guy could have, really.",
        "Henry: Okay. What have you done now?",
        "Brad: Nothing.",
        "Henry: Nothing? Right, right. The call, the compliments -- I recognize a catastrophe when I see one. Now, is this a category one or a category five? What's the martini count on this?",
        "Brad: No martinis necessary. I need your help in filling out this paperwork.",
        "Henry: Oh, yes, Mr. Snyder.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Henry: You know, uh, being a secretary reminds me of a fantasy that Vienna and I have. She puts her hair up in a bun and it's -- the hope center.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Henry: The Clark family alliance.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. Katie and I are going to look into adoption, you know. So there's a lot of paperwork, and I just don't want to -- I don't want to mess it up.",
        "Henry: Look, call me crazy Brad, but isn't this something you should be talking with, I don't know -- your wife about? The eventual mother of this child?",
        "Brad: There is plenty of time to involve Katie.",
        "Henry: When?",
        "Brad: When she's ready.",
        "Henry: She doesn't know yet, does she? Brad, Katie hates surprises. Especially those that last 18 years. Or more. Casey Hughes is 21 -- he still lives at home, when he's not in jail.",
        "Brad: Okay, you know what? Seeing her cry in that hospital bed -- that killed me, man.",
        "Henry: There's nothing deadlier than a woman's tears.",
        "Brad: Look, I don't want her to give up on us raising a child together. So, I want to get all the -- you know, get the process moving, till all systems are go.",
        "Henry: Are you sure this is what she wants?",
        "Brad: Yes. You know, we can't make a baby together, this is the next best thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Vienna, I appreciate what you're doing, what you're offering to do -- but I haven't even talked to Brad about this yet.",
        "Vienna: Why not? What are you waiting for?",
        "Katie: I don't know. The right time, the right approach.",
        "Vienna: Well, just tell him. \"Brad, Vienna is going to have our baby for us.\"",
        "Katie: I don't think I can just drop the idea of surrogacy on him like that.",
        "Vienna: Katie, Brad loves you. He'll do anything to make you happy.",
        "Katie: I know. I just -- I think this might be a little much to ask of him.",
        "Vienna: Nonsense. He wants this baby as much as you do. And I am going to make that happen. There's absolutely no reason to wait!",
        "Katie: Have you told Henry about this? Does he know that you offered to be our surrogate?",
        "Vienna: I will. I will.",
        "Katie: When?",
        "Vienna: Well, you have your way of handling your man, and I have my way of handling my man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elwood: Hey. I want to know where you get off thinking that you can break into my dorm room.",
        "Luke: Yeah? Well, I want to know where you get off thinking that you can keep selling drugs and denying it.",
        "Elwood: You know, you talk a lot of trash, Snyder. Maybe I made a mistake when I didn't press charges against you.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well the only reason you didn't is because you didn't want the cops going through your room, and finding something you didn't want them to see.",
        "Elwood: Oh, and what was that? Your boyfriend hiding in the closet?",
        "Luke: What does that even mean, Elwood? But anyway, I already found what I was looking for before you caught me.",
        "Elwood: Oh. Oh, I'm sure you did.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I did. And I gave it to the police. They know you're the one that sold Reg the drugs that killed him.",
        "Elwood: Mm-hmm. Is that why they locked up Casey instead of me?",
        "Luke: Elwood -- that was a cover. So that the real dealer would keep dealing again, thinking he was in the clear. And then they nab him.",
        "Elwood: Well that's bull. You know why? 'Cause Casey's mom is the chief of detectives. So why would she lock up her own son if he wasn't guilty?",
        "Luke: Elwood, I already told you. It is a cover. You're the one they're after.",
        "Elwood: You're full of it. Excuse me.",
        "Luke: They know who \"M\" is. Once they find him, you're next.",
        "Elwood: Well, I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Luke: Did you see that? Did you see his face?",
        "Noah: Why did you have to tell him all of that?",
        "Luke: Because he's guilty, Noah. Now all we have to do is get him to make a confession that the police can use.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey. How you doing?",
        "Casey: I'm fine. Are you okay?",
        "Alison: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Casey: Well, you left here yesterday still convinced Matt was innocent.",
        "Alison: I still believe that, the same way I still believe you.",
        "Casey: If he does anything to hurt you while I'm in here --",
        "Alison: Matt is not going to hurt me.",
        "Casey: How can you say that? After all he's done.",
        "Alison: Can we please not argue about this?",
        "Casey: Are you going to stay away from him?",
        "Alison: There's no reason to.",
        "Casey: There's no reason to? Do you know what he was doing when he was in prison?",
        "Alison: Yeah, he used drugs. Yeah, I know. I was there when your mom came to see him yesterday.",
        "Casey: And you're okay with that?",
        "Alison: Well -- I mean, I was upset that he didn't tell me about it himself. But he's not using anymore, Casey. He's clean now.",
        "Casey: Oh, come on. You -- are you kidding me?",
        "Alison: What? What? I'm clean now. What, does that not mean anything?",
        "Casey: Well, you never killed anybody.",
        "Alison: Neither did Matt. And he was not the one who gave Reg those pills.",
        "Casey: He's got you completely snowed, and you don't even see it.",
        "Alison: You know, the only person who is blind right now is you, Casey. You keep accusing Matt of doing all these things, but it's not because you actually think he's guilty. It's because of me.",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Alison: Because Matt likes me.",
        "Casey: No, whatever.",
        "Alison: You know, you can't get past your own stupid jealousy. And it's a horrible waste of time. Because it means whoever -- whoever did this is still out there.",
        "Casey: Yeah, probably bartending at Yo's.",
        "Alison: Don't you get it? If we keep letting our personal feelings get in the way of finding this guy, he could end up killing somebody else.",
        "Casey: He's a con, Ali. That's what he does best. Remember what he did to my mom last year? He led Nevins straight to her -- to our own house.",
        "Alison: Okay, that was a long time ago. Matt has changed a lot since then.",
        "Casey: Has he? Or is that what he wants to you think?",
        "Alison: No. I came to that conclusion on my own. Okay? He made a huge mistake, and he is really sorry.",
        "Casey: A huge mistake that almost got you killed. Twice. Maybe the third time, you won't be so lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I can't stop thinking about the look in Elwood's eyes when we told him that we knew who \"M\" was. He was totally freaked.",
        "Noah: And what if he calls Matt, or whoever this \"M\" character is, and finds out that you lied?",
        "Luke: Well, I didn't. Not really.",
        "Noah: You told him that you gave the police information.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, I did. Through Casey. He told his mom that he thinks Matt is the \"M\" who left the note that I found in Elwood's room.",
        "Noah: But nobody's proved that yet.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but they will. And once they do, both Matt and Elwood are going to pay for what they did to Reg and case.",
        "Noah: I still don't see why you had to tell Elwood anything.",
        "Luke: Why, Noah? It's not like I'm scared of him. Or Matt, for that matter.",
        "Noah: I know, and that's what scares me. I don't want anything to happen to you. I kind of love you, would like to keep you around.",
        "Luke: Well, hey, hey, hey. I kind of love you too. And I'm going to be fine.",
        "Noah: Promise?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I promise.",
        "Kevin: Hey.",
        "Luke: Kevin, hey.",
        "Kevin: I heard about Casey. Is he all right?",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, he will be. Once they nail the people that actually did this.",
        "Kevin: So Casey had nothing to do with it?",
        "Luke: Oh, hell no. He's not a drug dealer, he didn't kill Reg.",
        "Kevin: Well, then who did?",
        "Luke: Elwood.",
        "Noah: Luke.",
        "Luke: What? I'm not afraid to say it.",
        "Kevin: Well, you said guys. So it's not just Elwood?",
        "Luke: No. He's working for Matt O'Connor.",
        "Kevin: The guy who's bartending at Yo's?",
        "Luke: That's the one.",
        "Kevin: Well, I don't understand. If that's the case, then why is, uh, Casey still locked up?",
        "Noah: Because the police haven't proved anything yet.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but they will, once we get Elwood to turn on Matt.",
        "Noah: I really wish you'd stop talking like that.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Luke: I don't know this number. Hello?",
        "Elwood: You were right.",
        "Luke: Elwood?",
        "Elwood: Yeah. Look, I do know something about why this is happening to Casey.",
        "Luke: You do? Why?",
        "Elwood: I don't know if I should be saying this.",
        "Luke: No, Elwood, if you know something, you have to come forward.",
        "Elwood: But I already got in trouble with the police. And I cannot go back to prison.",
        "Luke: Look, if you don't want to go the police, let me help.",
        "Noah: Luke, no.",
        "Luke: If you don't want to talk to the police, tell me what you know. And I will tell them for you.",
        "Elwood: But they'll ask you where you got your information.",
        "Luke: But Elwood, that's good. Because if they know it came from you, they might be willing to cut you a deal or something.",
        "Elwood: Really?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, they do it all the time.",
        "Elwood: All right, do you know the bridge on Mill Road?",
        "Luke: Yeah, it goes out to Luther's Corners.",
        "Elwood: Meet me there. I'll tell you everything.",
        "Luke: We got him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey --",
        "Brad: Hey!",
        "Katie: Henry, I didn't know you were going to be here.",
        "Henry: Well, I just thought I'd drop in, spend some time with my buddy Brad -",
        "Brad: Yeah, he just came over to -- to watch the game.",
        "Katie: I thought you had a psychological aversion to sports.",
        "Henry: Poker game.",
        "Katie: On TV?",
        "Henry: Yep, yep. National championships. And it is too a sport. It's a brutal test of mental skill and precise hand-eye coordination.",
        "Katie: Oh. Why don't you use some of that hand-eye coordination, and turn on the TV?",
        "Henry: No. Now that you're here, I think I'll be on my way.",
        "Katie: Well, I don't -- I don't want to rush you out.",
        "Henry: Oh, you're not, you're not. I've realized that male bonding is best in small doses. Brad.",
        "Brad: Henry.",
        "Henry: Bubbles.",
        "Katie: Henry. Is he all right?",
        "Brad: Hard to tell. How are you?",
        "Katie: I'm better, now that I'm with you. And I'm glad Henry left, because there's something I want to talk to you about.",
        "Brad: What's up?",
        "Katie: Sit down.",
        "Brad: Okay.",
        "Katie: Okay. Do you remember what you said to me at the hospital, after the doctor that told me that I couldn't get pregnant?",
        "Brad: I said that I love you more than anything. No matter what, always will.",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Brad: Right.",
        "Katie: But, you said something else, too. That there are other ways that we could have a family, when I'm ready.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I remember that.",
        "Katie: So, I just was thinking, that since we can't have our family the old- fashioned way, maybe we should start thinking about some of those other options.",
        "Brad: Are you saying --",
        "Katie: I'm ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: What exactly did Elwood say?",
        "Luke: He said he thinks he knows why this is happening to Casey, but he's afraid to go to the cops. So I told him that he could give me the information, and I would go for him.",
        "Noah: Don't do this, Luke. Please, just tell the cops now, let them handle this. Please?",
        "Luke: Yeah, but Elwood is expecting me, not them.",
        "Noah: So? What, do you owe Elwood something?",
        "Luke: No, but I owe Casey. I got him kicked out of school!",
        "Noah: Okay, he got into that fight with Mark Vero on his own.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but he stuffed the ballot box for me, so that I'd win the election.",
        "Noah: Do you don't think that this is strange? Elwood was just here. If he had something to tell you, wouldn't he tell you then?",
        "Luke: Well, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe there were too many people around. Look, Elwood has to know that this is going to end badly. The only way he can save himself is to give up the information.",
        "Noah: I just -- I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Luke: Look, if the police show up, Elwood's going to run. And then Casey's going to be in jail forever.",
        "Noah: What are you doing?",
        "Luke: I'm calling Alison.",
        "Noah: You're impossible.",
        "Luke: Alison, hey, it's Luke.",
        "Alison: Hey. What's up?",
        "Luke: You're not going to believe this. Elwood called me.",
        "Alison: Elwood? Why?",
        "Casey: What's going on?",
        "Luke: He says he knows why this is happening to Casey. This might be the big break we're looking for. He wants to meet me him on the bridge on Mill Road.",
        "Alison: Well, are you going?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to tell you first. You can tell Casey, but don't tell anybody else.",
        "Alison: Okay. Just be careful.",
        "Luke: I will.",
        "Alison: Luke says Elwood wants to meet with him. This could be it.",
        "Casey: Elwood's ready to give up Matt?",
        "Alison: Or somebody.",
        "Casey: Well, I guess we're about to find out which one of us is right.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Matt: Hi. What are you doing?",
        "Alison: I was just headed to Al's. We're still on for lunch, right?",
        "Matt: We are. I'm just running late. I should be leaving work soon.",
        "Alison: Well, I suppose I could wait.",
        "Matt: You'd do that for me?",
        "Alison: Well, it's free food. I mean, you said you were paying, right?",
        "Matt: I did.",
        "Alison: Good. You know, I might even have some good news for you, too.",
        "Matt: Good news? Do I get a hint?",
        "Alison: Sorry. I promised Luke I wouldn't say anything.",
        "Matt: It's me. Who am I going to tell?",
        "Alison: True. Okay. Well, Luke is on his way to meet with Elwood.",
        "Matt: Elwood? Why?",
        "Alison: He said Elwood's ready to come clean about everything. And he told Luke to meet him at the bridge out on Mill Road. Matt, if Luke's right about this, this could be exactly what we need to clear both you and Casey.",
        "Matt: You're right. This is good news.",
        "Alison: I know. And I was thinking, you know, once this is all over, maybe you and Casey could try to work on being friends again.",
        "Matt: I'd like that. Listen, uh, I should go. I'll see you soon, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: So you are really going to go meet Elwood, huh?",
        "Luke: I have to, Noah.",
        "Noah: Well, you're not going alone.",
        "Luke: You're coming with me?",
        "Noah: I don't have a choice.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't get it. Every other time I've tracked down a lead, you stayed away.",
        "Noah: Yeah, exactly. And every other time, something's gone wrong. And I'm not going to take that chance again. I love you, Luke. And I'm not going to let you get hurt.",
        "Luke: Well, I love you, too. But I'm not going to get hurt. I'm meeting him in a public place.",
        "Noah: I don't care. Someone's going to keep an eye on you. Let's go.",
        "Luke: Noah -- I'm glad that that someone is you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: The only thing I can think about is having a baby with you. Do you think there's something wrong with me?",
        "Brad: I love you. I mean, don't you think I know how much you've been going through?",
        "Katie: Yeah, but you've been going through it too.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but not like you have. I mean, you wanted to have a baby so much that you started taking fertility drugs behind my back.",
        "Katie: And destroyed any chance of ever being pregnant with your baby.",
        "Brad: Look, I don't see it like that. However we -- however we get our child, it's going to be 100% ours. You don't have to give birth to a kid to be able to love it.",
        "Katie: I hope you're not just saying that because you think it's what I need to hear.",
        "Brad: No, no. I want this for both of us. You know, I would've brought it up before, but you were under so much pressure, I didn't want to add to it.",
        "Katie: How?",
        "Brad: By being me. Saying something wrong, stupid, you know? I tend to do that.",
        "Katie: Never.",
        "Brad: Never. You were just -- you were just so devastated after you found out you couldn't get pregnant. I just thought talking about other options would have seemed insensitive.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. I know, but actually, those other options are what give me hope.",
        "Brad: Me too. I mean, that's why I got the process rolling for us.",

        "Katie: Honey, we can't cut her out at this point. Her input is crucial.",
        "Brad: I think that's overstating a little bit.",
        "Katie: Uh, I don't. Why would you involve Henry, and not Vienna?",
