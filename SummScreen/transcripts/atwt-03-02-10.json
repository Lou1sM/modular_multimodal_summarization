        "Holden and Molly think that Damian faked his death because he wanted Holden to be blamed for his murder and the best way to do that was to provoke a fight with Holden at the docks and then kill someone so he could use the body and claim that Holden had killed him. Holden wants Lily to take the kids and go to Montega because Damian is going to come back to Oakdale for her. Lily refuses to leave because she is determined to help Holden prove his innocence even if he has to work with Molly to do it.",
        "Damian shows up at Faith's boarding school pretending to be Holden and persuades her principal not to expel her because drugs were found in her locker. Faith wants to call the police and get Holden out of jail but Damian tells her that her family is in danger because his cousin who wants his company was the person who framed Holden for his murder. Damian asks Faith to help him keep her family safe and she agrees to go back to Oakdale and help him keep the family safe.",

        "Lily: Faith, Honey, its -- its Mommy. Listen, did you happen to see the local paper today?",
        "Faith: No, Mom. They don't deliver it up here.",
        "Lily: Oh. I thought maybe you had read it online or something.",
        "Faith: The only thing I've been reading is my English Lit book. I've got midterms. How's Dad? Is he still in jail?",
        "Lily: Unfortunately. But with any luck, he'll be out soon.",
        "Faith: It must be weird for you, having to defend Dad for murdering Damian.",
        "Lily: I don't think he's guilty.",
        "Faith: I know, but I wouldn't blame him if he did it. I'm sure he wanted to.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] Faith, that's not a very nice thing to say. Damian cared a lot about you.",
        "Faith: No, he wanted you. We just came along with the package. It's okay. I eventually came to like him, which I guess was really stupid.",
        "Lily: No, Sweetheart, it wasn't. You have a good, kind heart, and I hope that you never lose it.",
        "Faith: I just want this all to be over.",
        "Lily: So do I. Faith, I am worried about your father. He's acting like he's okay, but I think he should have his family around him. I'm gonna call Ms. Gibson and ask if you can come home.",
        "Faith: No, don't. I -- I can't bail on this test. I'm already behind because I came in mid-year. If I don't take this test, I'll never catch up.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, you can study while you're here.",
        "Faith: With Dad in jail? I don't think so. I'll come home as soon as my midterms are over, I promise.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Ms. Gibson: Faith Snyder, I'd like a word with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: For the record, Mr. Snyder, it seems that you haven't been kissed all day.",
        "Holden: [Chuckles] I'm gonna have to plead the fifth on that one.",
        "Molly: Good, 'cause I'm only supposed to be here as a journalist. Only immediate family is allowed in to see you. So don't rat me out to Margo.",
        "Holden: I would never, ever let you take the fall for me.",
        "Molly: I feel the same way about you. How are you holding up in here? Do you need me to bring you anything?",
        "Holden: No, no. I'm good. It's nice seeing you, though. I just don't want my kids to see me in here like this.",
        "Molly: You have to talk to them. You're all over the papers. They need to know you're okay.",
        "Holden: How does seeing me in here convince them of that?",
        "Molly: Let's try to get you out of here, then.",
        "Holden: How? Damian's still dead, and I'm still the prime suspect.",
        "Molly: But what if Dr. Oliver's right? What if that body that they found in the water isn't Damian?",
        "Holden: How do you explain false identification?",
        "Molly: I know. It's a pretty major mistake for a coroner to make, huh?",
        "Holden: It wasn't a mistake. It was pure Damian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: All this work -- presentation, the number crunching -- you were never planning to move the company here! It was one big dog-and-pony show!",
        "Carly: Keep your voice down.",
        "Craig: I don't like being used, Carly. I have better things to do with my time.",
        "Carly: Hello. I -- I'm traveling with a friend of mine, Janet Snyder, and, um, in the excitement of checking in, I completely forgot what room she's in. Could you look it up for me?",
        "Craig: You want to come all the way down here just so you can be here when Jack confronts Janet about Dusty? Fine. Put yourself in the middle of all of this. But why did you have to drag me along?",
        "Carly: Thank you. Thank you very much. I didn't drag you along. You invited yourself along.",
        "Craig: I thought it was a legitimate business trip. What did you think was gonna happen anyway? That Jack was gonna walk in on Dusty and Janet, and then he'd run to your conveniently open arms, all betrayed and heartbroken and back to you?",
        "Carly: Yes. And why not? Jack still loves me. I love him. I never stopped loving him.",
        "Craig: Good for you. But all that love isn't going to change the fact that Jack is still married to Janet.",
        "Carly: Not after today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Jack. What are you -- what are you doing here? Is there something wrong at home?",
        "Jack: You could say that.",
        "Janet: Well, Dusty's here because he's the one who got Liberty into this clinical trial, and so he just came out to make sure that she's getting the best treatment possible. Thank you so much, Dusty. We are so grateful.",
        "Jack: Oh, yes, we are. We're very grateful. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like a few moments alone with my wife.",
        "Dusty: I'm not leaving her here to listen to your abuse.",
        "Janet: He's my husband, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: So what?",
        "Jack: Get out. I'm not gonna ask you again.",
        "Dusty: No. If you have something to say, you can say it in front of both of us.",
        "Janet: Look, I don't know what I walked in on here --",
        "Jack: We can stop pretending, Janet. I know everything.",
        "Janet: Dusty, could you do me a favor and call the hospital, please? Make sure that Liberty's okay.",
        "Dusty: You gonna be all right?",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Before you start leaning on Janet, blaming her for all kinds of sins, take a look in the mirror.",
        "Janet: Wow. Carly couldn't wait, huh? The minute she found out, she went running right to you.",
        "Jack: No, Carly did right. She -- she was hoping you'd be the straightforward, honest person I always said you were.",
        "Janet: Oh, please. She's been waiting for an opportunity like this since the day we got married.",
        "Jack: Carly respected our marriage vows more than you did. She was hoping you'd tell me yourself.",
        "Janet: Tell you what? It's not like I'm having an affair.",
        "Jack: Janet, that's exactly what it's like!",
        "Janet: No, it's not! That's not true! I don't care what Carly said!",
        "Jack: Okay, let's just leave her out of it.",
        "Janet: Oh, please. How can we? She's been in the middle of this all the time, as usual. The one night that we were together, you were holed up in a cabin with her, remember?",
        "Jack: It wasn't exactly like it was a romantic getaway, Janet. Craig was there, too. Our cars had gotten stuck. He was sick.",
        "Janet: It was New Year's Eve.",
        "Jack: Listen, if that's all it took for you to fall into bed with Dusty, then what does that say about us?",
        "Janet: It says that you weren't there, yet again.",
        "Jack: You slept with another man! Now, if I had done that with Carly --",
        "Janet: You might as well have. You've given everything else to her. Don't kid yourself. There have been three people in this marriage from the beginning, and I'm not talking about Dusty.",
        "Jack: Well, he's in the middle of it now, isn't he? Dusty says he's in love with you. What I need to know, are you in love with him, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Where are you going?",
        "Carly: Janet's room.",
        "Craig: Don't. It won't end well.",
        "Carly: I'm sick of sitting around here, wondering if this nightmare is finally over, just waiting to hear that poor, pathetic Janet is playing the leukemia card again.",
        "Craig: Liberty is fighting for her life.",
        "Carly: Yeah. I know that, and I'm heartsick about it. If I were Janet, I'd be losing my mind.",
        "Craig: Which is why she needs Jack right now.",
        "Carly: If she needs Jack so badly, what is she doing fooling around with Dusty?",
        "Craig: It doesn't take a genius to see that Jack already has one foot out the door.",
        "Carly: That's not my fault. It's not. I backed off when Jack married her.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Carly: Really. I kept my distance. I respected what they had.",
        "Craig: So now the respect is gone, so the truce is over?",
        "Carly: Jack and Janet's marriage is what's over, and they're being together for whatever their reasons is not healthy for anybody. It's time we all accepted that so we can get back to helping Liberty.",
        "Craig: Hmm. The gang's all here.",
        "Carly: Shh!",
        "Craig: Change your mind?",
        "Carly: No. And it's a good thing that Dusty's here, because then Janet will be alone when Jack leaves.",
        "Craig: Jack isn't going to leave her. He's too decent a guy.",
        "Carly: You're right. He'll forgive Janet for anything as long as she's dealing with Liberty. Add that to all the guilt that he's carrying around about brad. Unless I do something, he's gonna throw his entire life away out of some kind of obligation.",
        "Craig: That's his choice.",
        "Carly: What about me?",
        "Craig: Move on. I don't know how Jack feels about Janet right now, but I do know that they used to love each other. They were happy. You and Jack just tortured the life out of each other.",
        "Carly: You don't understand anything about us.",
        "Craig: Of course not. How could a soulless monster like me understand an eternal love like yours?",
        "Carly: Rant and rave all you want. Nobody's listening.",
        "Craig: Now what?",
        "Carly: I'm gonna go fight for what's mine.",
        "Carly: Craig? Craig, this is not funny! Come on! Let me out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Look, Damian never wanted to live in Oakdale, and now he doesn't have to. Officially, he's dead and buried. He can live anywhere in the world he wants. But he's not gonna leave here until he claims what he believes is his.",
        "Molly: Lily. So he goaded you into attacking him knowing you wouldn't kill him.",
        "Holden: [Chuckles] I wanted to, but I didn't do it because of Luke.",
        "Molly: Still, if one thing went wrong, if you had lost it --",
        "Holden: It was a gamble, but it paid off. A few cuts and bruises. Small price to pay.",
        "Molly: He still needed a body. Which means --?",
        "Holden: That someone on that ship is dead.",
        "Molly: You know what? I have a source at the port authority. He'll get me a list of the ship's crew, copies of the merchant marine licenses. I'm gonna figure out who that body belonged to.",
        "Holden: You know what? You need to be careful. If Damian finds out that you're onto him, he will come after you.",
        "Molly: Is that your way of saying you care about me?",
        "Holden: No comment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: I don't know how those drugs got into my locker. I don't smoke pot. Someone's trying to set me up. It was probably those girls -- you know, Grace, Audrey, Samantha. They've had it out for me ever since I won the essay contest.",
        "Ms. Gibson: You are a very lucky young woman, Faith.",
        "Faith: I am?",
        "Ms. Gibson: Your father has intervened on your behalf.",
        "Faith: My father is okay with it?",
        "Damian: I am not okay with you doing drugs. But I know how difficult it's been, living away from home for the first time, getting used to a new school. So I promised Ms. Gibson it won't happen again. I hope you've learned your lesson, young lady.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: What are you doing here, Molly?",
        "Molly: Interviewing Holden. I'm doing that piece for WOAK on Damian's disappearance, remember?",
        "Lily: Want me to step outside so you can ask a follow-up question?",
        "Holden: Molly's been helping me put together the pieces of the case.",
        "Lily: I'm afraid to ask how far she's gotten.",
        "Holden: Look, I need you two to start working together.",
        "Lily: How?",
        "Holden: You know how Damian thinks. Molly has contacts which can verify possible leads. So you two need to drop your differences, or I'm gonna end up in a Maltese prison.",
        "Lily: What do you know so far?",
        "Holden: The body that they found wasn't Damian's.",
        "Lily: It wasn't. I believe Dr. Oliver.",
        "Molly: So do we.",
        "Holden: Well, then, Damian engineered the whole thing.",
        "Molly: Right. And I've got connections at the docks, so I'm gonna find out who went missing on that freighter between here and the Maltese coast.",
        "Lily: Wait a minute. I mean, Damian is capable of a lot of things, but I don't think he would kill someone in order to fake his own death.",
        "Molly: Really? Why not? He had no problem killing Meg and stuffing her in that trunk. The only reason she's alive right now is because he's not as good a murderer as he thought he was.",
        "Lily: You weren't there. You have no idea what --",
        "Molly: Stop deluding yourself, Lily.",
        "Holden: Molly --",
        "Molly: Sorry, fine. You have a right to your own opinion. But I believe in Holden, and I believe that Damian is out there, alive and well, and he's not gonna stop until Holden is completely out of the picture. So if you're not on Holden's side, get out of my way so I can save his life. I got to call my office.",
        "Lily: You know that I believe in you, too, don't you?",
        "Holden: I do know that. But I like having Molly in my corner. I'm not gonna apologize for that.",
        "Lily: I don't expect you to. I brought the kids here to see you.",
        "Holden: Why did you do that? I told you, I didn't want them to see me locked up in here.",
        "Lily: Holden, they know that you've been arrested. And I'm sure whatever they're imagining is far worse than this. They need their daddy, and you need them, too.",
        "Holden: Where are they?",
        "Lily: They're out there, playing cops and robbers with Margo.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, I hope they're the cops. Margo can use a dose of her own medicine.",
        "Lily: Don't let her hear you say that.",
        "Holden: Have you talked to Faith?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I called. I tried to get her to come home, but she has an English Lit exam.",
        "Holden: Well, that's good. At least her focus is where it needs to be.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] I've never seen her take her studies so seriously.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Well, thank you so much for giving my daughter a second chance, Ms. Gibson. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to talk to her in private for a few minutes.",
        "Faith: Ms. Gibson, he is not --",
        "Damian: I don't think Faith realizes the break she caught today with just a suspension. Ms. Gibson was planning to expel you and report you to the local authorities.",
        "Faith: You were gonna have me arrested?",
        "Ms. Gibson: You know the school has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to drug use.",
        "Damian: Now, if you think we should go that route, I'll defer to your judgment.",
        "Faith: No, please. Thank you so much for giving me a second chance. I know it's a big deal. I won't disappoint you. We need to talk -- Dad. What are you doing here?! You're supposed to be dead!",
        "Damian: I'll explain everything in the car. Now, let's go.",
        "Faith: I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "Damian: I don't think you have a choice, Faith. You're suspended, which means you can't stay in the dorm. And I doubt you want to call your parents and tell them why you've been sent home.",
        "Faith: My dad is in jail. They're saying that he murdered you, but you're still alive! I'm calling the police to tell them they're wrong.",
        "Damian: That's really sweet that you want to help your father, but unfortunately, I'm the only one who can. So if I were you, I'd cooperate with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: [Sighs] Craig, when I get out of here, I'm -- it's okay. It's okay. This -- this motel has turn-down service, so somebody will be here any minute with one of those little chocolates. I can wait. The hell I can. Help! Somebody let me out of here!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Bring this man a beer so he has something to cry into.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here? Don't tell me it's a coincidence.",
        "Craig: No. I'm here to facilitate a reconciliation.",
        "Dusty: Somebody must be desperate.",
        "Craig: Jack and Janet.",
        "Dusty: What about them?",
        "Craig: Oh, I think those two kids just need a little help to find their way back to each other. I know that throws a wrench into your plans.",
        "Dusty: None of this is your business.",
        "Craig: Oh, you're wrong. I'm greatly affected by the outcome. So if I had to choose between Janet and Jack or Janet and you, you don't get my vote.",
        "Dusty: So this is about you and Carly?",
        "Craig: Jack's wrong for her.",
        "Dusty: Well, they're slow learners. Where is she?",
        "Craig: Who?",
        "Dusty: Carly. I know you didn't come here alone.",
        "Craig: Oh, don't you worry about Carly. She won't be interrupting Mr. and Mrs. Snyder anytime soon. And they have a lot to work out, thanks to you. You're the sideshow, Dusty, not the main attraction.",
        "Dusty: Is that so?",
        "Craig: Janet loves Jack, and she believes in marriage, and she's not about to throw it all away on a whim.",
        "Dusty: It's not a whim.",
        "Craig: Well, that's up to her to decide, don't you think? My advice -- stay away from them. You'll just make the situation more explosive.",
        "Dusty: It's about time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'd like to know where we stand.",
        "Janet: Why?",
        "Jack: Because for you, it's all about Liberty. But for Dusty, it's all about you.",
        "Janet: And for you, it's all about Carly.",
        "Jack: No, no. I don't claim to be without fault, but I am here for you, and I'm here for Liberty. I'm responsible for Brad not being here for her, so I'm doing the best I can to do what I think he would want me to do.",
        "Janet: Yes, Jack. You've done a wonderful job of caretaking.",
        "Jack: I'm also doing what I can to honor our marriage. That said, you're right. I don't want to see Carly hurt.",
        "Janet: Why? Because she's so fragile? You're afraid she's gonna drown her sorrows in a bottle of vodka? And you just couldn't live with yourself if that happened, right?",
        "Jack: Not if it were my fault, no. I know that you don't need me to help you get through Liberty's illness, but you asked for my help, and I promised I would.",
        "Janet: I just didn't realize it was gonna be such a huge sacrifice.",
        "Jack: It's just complicated.",
        "Janet: For you. Where would we all be if you weren't there to prop us up, huh? We'd all just collapse -- me, Carly.",
        "Jack: I never said that.",
        "Janet: I can't worry about your feelings right now. My daughter is in the hospital, fighting for her life, and I need everything I've got to be there for her! So if Dusty wants to be there for me as a friend, I am not gonna justify it to anyone! Does that answer your question?!",
        "Jack: Yeah, I think it does.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Janet: Right on cue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Your handiwork?",
        "Craig: Seemed like a good idea at the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How did you -- never mind. It doesn't matter. Listen, I can't deal with you right now. I need some time alone with Janet so we can work things out.",
        "Carly: Sorry, Jack. That's not happening. I have waited for you to work things out for months, and something always gets in the way. I've had it. I have tried to be patient, but I stink at it.",
        "Jack: No, Carly. This time, it's different.",
        "Carly: Yes, it is, because I'm not going anywhere. This is as much about me as it is about her.",
        "Janet: Excuse me.",
        "Carly: I have every right to be a part of this discussion.",
        "Janet: I don't think so.",
        "Dusty: You okay?",
        "Jack: Dusty, stay out of it.",
        "Craig: Carly, you shouldn't be here.",
        "Carly: Craig, I don't answer to you.",
        "Janet: Hey, am I the only person who remembers why I'm even in Minneapolis?",
        "Carly: I haven't forgotten, and my heart is breaking for you and Liberty. I don't know how you deal with a child with cancer. I don't want to know. But I have bent over backwards to make sure that we don't cause you any more pain.",
        "Janet: \"We\"? You and Jack.",
        "Carly: We have to stop pretending that everything is as it should be. It's not helping Liberty. It's not helping any of us. This -- this situation is wrong, and it has to end now before more damage is done.",
        "Janet: There's nothing left to tell. Jack knows everything.",
        "Carly: You don't.",
        "Jack: Carly, don't.",
        "Craig: Yeah, bad idea. Neutral corners, everyone.",
        "Dusty: No, we're all here. Let's clear the air.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: That doesn't mean ganging up on Janet.",
        "Janet: No, wait. Go ahead. Finish what you started. What don't I know?",
        "Carly: Jack and I gave up everything for you. We swallowed our feelings. We put you first, and we did it willingly, 'cause your daughter was sick, and taking care of Liberty was the only thing that mattered.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: I thought I could live with that decision. I really did, because I thought you were loyal and honest. But you're not. You weren't Jack's faithful wife. You were Dusty's lover.",
        "Jack: Carly, that's enough.",
        "Janet: What do you mean when you say you gave up everything?",
        "Carly: We were back together.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Carly: Jack was on his way to the farm to tell you. He was gonna ask you for a divorce when you told him about Liberty's cancer. You asked him to stand by you, and Jack, being Jack, he did.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God. You knew, didn't you? Everybody knew except me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Damian sighs]",
        "Faith: What do you want from me, Damian?",
        "Damian: You were in trouble. I helped you out.",
        "Faith: Why?",
        "Damian: Because I'm your stepfather and I love you. That's why. Just like I did that day when the man held a gun on you in your living room.",
        "Faith: His name was Eb Stone, and you killed him.",
        "Damian: I'd do it again if I had to.",
        "Faith: I'm just worried about my dad. So can we please just go back to Oakdale and get him out of jail? He doesn't belong there.",
        "Damian: It's not that simple.",
        "Faith: Yes, it is. You're alive.",
        "Damian: But no one can know that yet, Faith.",
        "Faith: Why not?",
        "Damian: [Sighs] There's a power struggle among the Grimaldis.",
        "Faith: I thought you didn't have any family left.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well, there's a distant cousin, or so he claims. He wants control of the family fortune. He tried to have me killed and set your father up to take the fall.",
        "Faith: So just tell the police and have them arrest the guy.",
        "Damian: If he knows I'm alive, he'll do anything he can to get to me. He might try to use your mother and the children to draw me out.",
        "Faith: This is crazy.",
        "Damian: Yes, I agree. But I won't put my family in danger. Do you believe me?",
        "Faith: Not really.",
        "Damian: I wouldn't do that if I were you, Faith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Janet, this is good. This is a good thing. Everything is out in the open. We can all get on with our lives.",
        "Janet: How?",
        "Carly: Dusty wants you. Jack wants me. We just shift.",
        "Jack: No, Carly, stop. No, that's not the way to do this.",
        "Carly: If I left it up to the two of you, we'd all be miserable for the rest of our lives.",
        "Craig: I have an idea.",
        "Jack: That's enough! No. I don't want to hear any more ideas. All I want is for everyone to leave so I can talk to my wife.",
        "Dusty: What do you want?",
        "Janet: I want you all to go.",
        "Jack: That includes you, too.",
        "Craig: That went well.",
        "Jack: Carly never should have burst in like that. I know she upset you. But I'm to blame, too. I showed up unannounced, just like she did, when all you should be doing is thinking about Liberty.",
        "Janet: Is it true what she said about the two of you? Then you're an even bigger liar than I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm getting a drink.",
        "Carly: What are you still doing here?",
        "Craig: There's no reason this trip has to be a total bust. I came to Minneapolis to find warehouse space for Monte Carlo. Just because you brought me here under false pretenses doesn't mean it's not a good idea.",
        "Carly: Minneapolis?",
        "Craig: It's a great town. And I think we both know that Jack's not coming out of there anytime soon. So why don't we use the time and go see a real-estate agent?",
        "Carly: I can't. I'm going back to my room.",
        "Craig: Not a good idea.",
        "Carly: I didn't ask you. Jack is in there, and he's doing whatever he feels he has to do. And when he's done, he will come to me.",
        "Craig: Carly --",
        "Carly: Don't even think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I chose to be with you. I wanted our marriage to work. That wasn't a lie.",
        "Janet: Well, it wasn't exactly the truth either. You know what I meant when I asked you to come home. It's because I wanted a real marriage. That's all I've ever wanted.",
        "Jack: I know.",
        "Janet: So tell me the truth now. Did you come back out of love or obligation?",
        "Jack: It was -- it was an emotional moment. You'd just found out about Liberty.",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Jack: You were scared, Janet, and I wanted to help.",
        "Janet: Help? Help isn't love, Jack, not in my book.",
        "Jack: It's more complicated than that.",
        "Janet: No, it's not! You keep saying that, but it's not. You came back for Liberty's sake and because you owed it to Brad.",
        "Jack: Brad, exactly. When I saw Brad Christmas Eve, he wanted me to look after his son, but he never thought that Liberty would be facing something like this, and he would want me to look after her, too. I'm keeping that promise to him.",
        "Janet: What about the promise you made to me, \"Love and respect till death do us part\"?",
        "Jack: I think we both made a mess of that one.",
        "Janet: You asked me if I'm in love with Dusty.",
        "Jack: Are you?",
        "Janet: I don't know. Maybe. What I want to know is are you in love with Carly?",
        "Jack: Yes. I didn't want you to find out this way. [Voice breaking]",
        "Janet: Well, at least now I'm not the only one in my life who knows my marriage is a sham.",
        "Jack: At least we both know where we stand.",
        "Janet: So what do we do now?",
        "Jack: We pick up where we left off before Liberty got sick.",
        "Janet: An annulment.",
        "Jack: If that's what you want.",
        "Janet: I think I want you to go. I need to be by myself right now. Jack, one thing doesn't change. We're still gonna have a baby for Liberty, no matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Ethan laughs]",
        "Holden: [Laughs] You know what? I'm impressed. You're able to withstand tickle torture.",
        "Natalie: You won the game, Ethan.",
        "Ethan: Do I get a prize?",
        "Holden: You sure do. How about, uh -- how about the lucky horseshoe above Grandma's door at the stables? You want your mom to go grab that and bring it home for you?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I can do that. I'll put it above your door to your bedroom. Okay? Nat, why don't you take Ethan and go say good-bye to Margo? I'll be out in a minute.",
        "Natalie: I love you, Daddy.",
        "Holden: I love you, too, Honey.",
        "Lily: I promise I will bring them back to visit you as soon as Margo gives me the word.",
        "Holden: No, you won't, because you're taking the kids, and you're leaving town today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Faith, give me your cell phone.",
        "Faith: If you're telling the truth, let me call my mom. You can tell her about your cousin. That way she'll be safe. That's what you want, right?",
        "Damian: And what if someone is monitoring the call?",
        "Faith: The police think you're dead.",
        "Damian: But my cousin knows the truth. He may have tapped your mother's phone. If he knows we've been in contact, he'll go after her. You have to trust me.",
        "Faith: Why would I? I'm pretty sure you just kidnapped me from school.",
        "Damian: Tell me the truth. You didn't mind leaving. I'm not like your teacher, who tells you to do one thing, and then they go off and do another. Hey, I've been to boarding school, too. I know how strict it can be. I don't blame you for rebelling.",
        "Faith: I was just smoking pot. It wasn't a big deal.",
        "Damian: You never really wanted to go to boarding school, did you? What if I promise you you'll never have to come back here again and your parents never have to hear about the marijuana, hmm?",
        "Faith: You can do that?",
        "Damian: I can do that and more for a friend.",
        "Faith: What do you want in return?",
        "Damian: For now, just let your mother think you're coming home for a visit. She can't know that you've seen me.",
        "Faith: My dad is in jail for no reason. If I don't tell, he'll stay there.",
        "Damian: Only temporarily. I give you my word.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Molly: Faith, hi. It's Molly. Um, listen, it's about your dad. Can we talk?",
        "Faith: What about Dad?",
        "Molly: He's still in jail, but I'm doing everything I can think of to prove he's innocent.",
        "Faith: Maybe I can help.",
        "Molly: I am so glad to hear you say that. Your dad would never admit it, but I think he really needs everybody to rally around him right now to keep his spirits up.",
        "Faith: Shouldn't we be trying to get him out of jail?",
        "Molly: That's where I come in. But I think he really needs you here, so I'm gonna come on up there and pick you up, okay? I think you can't be too far away from your family in a time like this.",
        "Faith: I have a chemistry exam. If I wouldn't blow it off for my own mom, why would I blow it off for my dad's girlfriend?",
        "Molly: Silly me for thinking that your dad came before a science test.",
        "Faith: I'll get there when I get there.",
        "Damian: Good girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, the kids are still in school. I can't pull them out at a moment's notice.",
        "Damian: Lily, don't you get it? If Damian wanted to escape justice, he could have just disappeared. But he staged his own death. He has something else up his sleeve.",
        "Lily: You think he's coming after me?",
        "Holden: I know he is.",
        "Lily: But that's insane. Why would he risk everything? After all the lies he's told, he can't possibly think that I would go back to him.",
        "Holden: This is Damian we're talking about. He believes that you two are destined to be together. He thinks that you will forgive him, just like you always have.",
        "Lily: I won't, not ever again.",
        "Holden: He will never give you up. You know that, and I cannot protect you from in here.",
        "Lily: My mother has hired security to guard the house 24 hours a day.",
        "Holden: Lily, this is Damian we're talking about. What you need to do is just -- just go visit Sierra. Go to Montega. Take the kids.",
        "Lily: No!",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Lily: No, because I'm not gonna run out on you, Holden. I am gonna stay here and help you fight this.",
        "Holden: Lily, I can't do what I need to do if I'm worrying about you and the kids.",
        "Lily: What makes you think that he won't come after you? Look, we are sticking together on this. I know that you said that you have Molly, but -- but you need me, Holden. I -- I know how Damian thinks, and I am the only one that can get through to him. You need me.",
        "Holden: Lily, this is the wrong time to be stubborn.",
        "[Footsteps approaching]",
        "Holden: Hey, you guys all set?",
        "Lily: Say good-bye to your daddy. All right, let's go.",

        "Reid: As long as everything goes as planned with this hearing, I should be on the next flight out of here.",
        "Henry: He's trouble, okay, and I don't think he's gonna leave, even if he is acquitted.",
        "Katie: What are you going to do?",
        "Henry: Whatever has to be done.",
        "Damian: You go home, act normal. You'll receive a text from Max if I have something I need you to do.",
