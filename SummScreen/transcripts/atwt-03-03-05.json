        "Will: Got your message.",
        "Paul: Something I got to tell you.",
        "Will: Don't worry about it. Dad already did. And if you're wondering, no, I'm not happy about being right about Rosanna.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Whoa. If you lose any of that, that's coming out of your tips.",
        "Rafael: I'm sorry. I didn't even see you.",
        "Alison: I'm not surprised. It's like you're in another universe.",
        "Rafael: You're right. I'm out of my mind. I can't take this anymore.",
        "Alison: Don't worry about it. It's not busy like this every night. You're going to get the hang of it.",
        "Rafael: It's not the job. It's my sister. She's way too young to be off alone with Casey. And don't tell me they'll be back here any minute, Ali, because that's what you said a couple hours ago.",
        "Alison: No, Celia is fine. She probably just stopped to get a burger or something, lost track of time.",
        "Rafael: We serve burgers here.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but with big brother breathing down her throat? Do you remember when you were a kid, about five minutes ago?",
        "Rafael: Yeah, which is how come I'm freaking here.",
        "Alison: Well, Casey is totally cool. I told you, he is Mr. Responsible.",
        "Rafael: So how come Mr. Responsible isn't back with my kid sister?",
        "Alison: Ooh, and I thought Emily and my mom were a pain.",
        "Rafael: You don't understand. Back in Montega, it was such a small place, there's only so much trouble she could get into. It's different here. And ever since she arrived, she's like on this high or something.",
        "Alison: You want to go look for her, don't you?",
        "Rafael: At least drive by Al's, see if she's there. [Alison sighs] It's just we're so busy, though, and Aaron laid down the law already.",
        "Alison: Just go. I'll cover for you, okay?",
        "Rafael: Table six. They don't need change. And, Ali, thank you so much. I owe you big time. I promise you, I'll be right back.",
        "[Alison sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: You sure it's been stolen? Maybe you forgot where we parked it.",
        "Casey: I looked everywhere. I thought maybe it even got towed, so I called the cops and they said no. So I made a report.",
        "Celia: What are you going to do?",
        "Casey: Pray? I don't know. The car has a tracking device on it, so I called the GPS company, but I hope they find it before it gets stripped.",
        "Celia: What about your parents? They're going to freak, aren't they?",
        "Casey: I don't even want to think about it. God, I'm not even supposed to be outside of Oakdale.",
        "Celia: This is all my fault. If I didn't want to come to this stupid audition so bad --",
        "Casey: No, stop it. Come on, I said I'd bring you. Besides, everything will be fine, really.",
        "Celia: How are we going to get home?",
        "Casey: I don't know. I'll think of something, but, in the meantime, you need to call Rafael and let him know what's going on.",
        "Celia: I can't call him. He'll kill me.",
        "Casey: I have a feeling if Rafael's gonna kill anyone, it's not going to be you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Julia? Oh, no. No, no, no. No, Julia. Please, please don't leave me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I mean it, Carly. Julia is not going to be a part of our lives anymore. Hey, you cold? Hmm?",
        "Carly: No. No, I'm just tired. It's been a really long day.",
        "Jack: Tell me about it. I still can't believe that Julia got Holden to file that restraining order. No wonder Luke's been acting out. He can't stand the way his father's treating his mother. And I got to tell you, I'm bummed out about J.J., but I can't let Julia do to us what she did to them. I got to keep our family out of the line of fire, you know?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Hey -- hey, what's wrong?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm just worried about -- about Lily. She's watching her family fall apart, and she feels like there's nothing she can do about it. I just -- I wish I could help somehow.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Yeah, hello?",
        "Holden: Jack, she's dead. She's not breathing. I can't get her up.",
        "Jack: Wait a second, Holden, back up. You talking about one of the horses? You out at the farm?",
        "Holden: I'm at Julia's. She's lying on the floor. Jack, there's blood, and she's so cold.",
        "Jack: Julia? Holden, did you try to revive her?",
        "Holden: Yes, I did. I tried everything I could. But I can't get her back.",
        "Jack: Did you call for help?",
        "Holden: I called 911. I don't know what else to do.",
        "Jack: All right, sit tight. I'll be right over, all right? Okay. Holden said -- Julia's dead.",
        "Carly: What? How?",
        "Jack: I have no idea. But he's over there alone, and I got to go -- I got to go see him.",
        "Carly: Yeah, go. Well, here it comes, Lily. You just stick to your story and everything will be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Mom?",
        "Lily: Luke.",
        "Luke: You okay?",
        "Lily: How can I be okay when nobody knew where you were? You can't just run out of here when you don't like the way things are going around this house.",
        "Luke: Why not? Dad does.",
        "Lily: You shouldn't have said those terrible things to you father. Your grandmother told me the whole story.",
        "Luke: Well, what about the terrible things he's done to you? And what about the terrible things he's made us do?",
        "Lily: Oh, my God, this has turned into such a nightmare.",
        "Luke: Its okay, Mom. I know what happened.",
        "Lily: What do you mean? What do you mean you know what happened?",
        "Luke: I found your gloves at Julia's place. That's okay. I took care of it. I'll protect you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I owe you an apology.",
        "Will: Not really.",
        "Paul: You have every right to be angry. You had your doubts about Rosanna. Will, all you were was honest with me, and I shot you down pretty hard.",
        "Will: It's okay.",
        "Paul: I just couldn't believe that Rosanna would do all of those things to herself, so I took it out on you, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry Rosanna did all of those things to hurt you.",
        "Will: Whatever.",
        "Paul: It wasn't about you, Will. You know that, right? She was trying to get back at me.",
        "Will: Why? All you ever did was try to make her happy.",
        "Paul: Rosanna couldn't be happy. Not as long as she felt that I let Cabot die.",
        "Will: I don't blame you for what she did.",
        "Paul: But you blame me for something else. What -- what's going on?",
        "Will: All right, fine. I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me.",
        "Paul: How come?",
        "Will: Because I was an idiot. I bought into the whole happy family thing. You know, you and Rosanna made it sound so good. Two people that loved you under the same roof. I should have known it wasn't going to work.",
        "Paul: I wanted us all to be a family more than anything in the world, Will. I don't really know how any one of us could have known that it was going to end up like this.",
        "Will: Yeah. How come you couldn't see what was going on with your own wife?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Will: I trusted you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know. I know. And I'm -- I'm going to spend the rest of my life regretting that I couldn't protect you.",
        "Will: Well, that's nice and all, but it doesn't really change anything, does it?",
        "Paul: I know that. I'm sorry, that's all. I'm sorry. You got to believe me.",
        "Will: That's the problem. I do believe you. I know you're sorry. But when you and Emily went on the warpath against Mom, you wanted her to be guilty so bad that you were blind to what was really going on. And you know what? It hurt. [Cell phone rings] Hello?",
        "Casey: What's up, Will?",
        "Will: This and that.",
        "Casey: Um, how would you like to come to Chicago and save a couple of lives?",
        "Will: Now?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Why, were you in the middle of something?",
        "Will: No, no. I'm all done here. Hold on a second, and I'll get your coordinates. I got to go.",
        "Paul: No, no. Will, don't split like this. Come on.",
        "Will: No, I need some space.",
        "[Paul remembering]",
        "Will: How come you couldn't see what was going on with your own wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Isn't this night great or what? It's really happening.",
        "Alison: It's called success. Get used to it.",
        "Aaron: Tell Rafi the people at table six are looking for him, okay?",
        "Curtis: Alison, you seen Rafael?",
        "Alison: Uh, he -- he went outside.",
        "Curtis: When you see him, tell him his sister called.",
        "Alison: Celia called? Where is she?",
        "Curtis: She didn't say. She only said that she and Casey would be back soon. Oh, and she said to tell him not to worry.",
        "Alison: It's a little late for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: She has a brother. His name is Keith, um -- Holden, what's his last name?",
        "Holden: Morrisey.",
        "Jack: Keith Morrisey. He's staying at the Lakeview. He's going to need to know what's going on.",
        "Holden: I have to go with her. I can't leave her alone.",
        "Jack: No, hey, wait a second. Wait a second. I know it's hard, okay? But there's not much you can do for her right now.",
        "Holden: How could this happen? There was blood in her hair. She was hit, Jack. She was knocked down. Someone hurt her.",
        "Jack: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Just tell me everything that happened from the moment you walked in.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Holden: Okay, I was trying to find Luke. I drove over here. I wanted to talk to Julia. I was fighting with Luke, and I knew that she would understand, you know? And then, when I got here, she was lying on the floor. At first I thought that she was sleeping. But then she wouldn't wake up. And then I touched her hand, Jack. She was so cold. Who could have done this?",
        "Jack: Okay, right now, we don't know that anybody did anything. All we know is that it seems to have been an accident. She fell down and hit her head. If there's more to the story, my guys will find it. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You went back to Julia's apartment?",
        "Luke: Yeah, after I had that fight with Dad.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Luke: I don't know. So maybe that she would know that I was the one who trashed her place. Or maybe so that I could tell her that, once and for all, leave our family alone. Or maybe I thought that Dad would walk in and then I could yell at them both.",
        "Lily: Then what happened?",
        "Luke: I saw her lying on the floor. I didn't know what was going on. I tried calling her name, and I saw the gloves. They looked like yours. So, I picked them up, and I could smell your perfume on them.",
        "Lily: Oh, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen -- to get you involved in all of this.",
        "Luke: Oh, no. It's okay. They're not going to find the gloves. I took care of it.",
        "Lily: You took care of it how?",
        "Luke: I burned them.",
        "Lily: You burned them? Why?",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, they could have had blood on them. I don't know. I didn't want anybody to find out what you did -- what you did to Julia. Hello, my darling. Your lush blossom beckons.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Ali, have you seen Rafi? Because I can't find him anywhere. Tell me you are not waitressing right now.",
        "Alison: No, I don't mind. It's busy.",
        "Aaron: Where is Rafael?",
        "Alison: He was going crazy about Celia being gone for so long. So, he couldn't help it. He had to look for her.",
        "Aaron: We're in the middle of this huge night and he's looking for Celia. He didn't ask me.",
        "Alison: He asked me.",
        "Aaron: And you told him he could split?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Aaron: Ali, what the hell are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: I can't believe I made you come all the way over here for nothing.",
        "Casey: You're not gonna let one big jerk stand in your way, are you? I bet Christina Aguilera ran into tons of jerks on her way to the top.",
        "Celia: You lie.",
        "Casey: I've heard you sing. I think you're amazing. And if you stick with it, you're going to catch a break, and you're going to make it, too.",
        "Celia: You're the only person who's ever said anything like that to me. I wish my brother could say something like that once in a while. But what about you? You have a dream?",
        "Casey: Can't sing a note.",
        "Celia: Not my dream, your dream. What do you want to be?",
        "Casey: Alive when my parents find out their car was stolen.",
        "Celia: Be serious. What do you want to do after school?",
        "Casey: More school. I don't know. I'll go to college, then I'll study law. Maybe I'll even go into politics.",
        "Celia: Really?",
        "Casey: I don't know. My mom's a cop. My dad's a district attorney. I guess it's in the blood.",
        "Celia: I think that's good that you want to help people.",
        "Casey: I just want to make sure people get treated fairly, you know? It's like, I look around and I just see more and more people getting the short end of the stick. And I just want to make a difference, I guess. That sounded really lame, huh?",
        "Celia: No. It was amazing. You're a really good guy.",
        "Will: Hear somebody here could use a ride?",
        "Casey: Will. You are so my new best friend. God. Will, Celia. Celia, Will.",
        "Celia: I know you.",
        "Will: You do?",
        "Celia: I saw you leaving Alison's a couple days ago. We didn't get to talk. You were kind of in a hurry.",
        "Will: Uh, I forget. Maybe, yeah.",
        "Casey: So -- what were you doing at Alison's house?",
        "Will: Nothing. Forget about it. So, are we out of here or what?",
        "Casey: You are such a life-saver, man. Thank you so much for coming here so late.",
        "Will: Hey, I had nothing better to do.",
        "Casey: Cool. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hello? Anybody home?",
        "Paul: Little late for a pity visit, don't you think?",
        "Emily: No, I saw the lights were on when I was driving by, and I thought -- okay, I was a little worried about you.",
        "Paul: It's when the lights are off that you really need to worry. I'm all right.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, you don't look all right to me.",
        "Paul: No, I'm all right, really.",
        "Emily: This place is a wreck.",
        "Paul: I told Phyllis to get lost.",
        "Emily: You've been by yourself all day?",
        "Paul: Will stopped by.",
        "Emily: Have you eaten anything since Rosanna left?",
        "Paul: Scotch.",
        "Emily: Scotch. I thought so. Roast beef -- I hope you like it.",
        "Paul: I kind of lost my appetite when I was talking to my kid brother.",
        "Emily: He was pretty upset, huh?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I had to drag it out of him. I really hate to see him so defensive. But you know what's worse?",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Paul: Is that when I finally did get him to spill, he asked me what I had been asking myself every second since Rosanna left.",
        "Emily: What's that?",
        "Paul: How come I didn't know? I mean, there must have been clues, right?",
        "Emily: Not necessarily, no.",
        "Paul: According to her, she had hated me for months. And -- I didn't see so much as a tell-tale look. I didn't see her pulling away. How could I not see any of the signs? How could I be so -- so caught up in getting Barbara that I didn't see my own wife tearing my heart out, and all the while -- very effectively, I might add -- acting as if she were in love with me?",
        "Emily: I don't know. Some people have all sorts of reasons for covering their tracks. What do you want to do with all of this mail? You've got a ton of it outside.",
        "Paul: Just throw it anywhere.",
        "Emily: Well, they're not just letters for you. There's letters for Rosanna. Paul, you're going to have to decide what to do with her mail. It's important. This one -- it's marked urgent, so --",
        "Paul: Everything that Rosanna told me the day that she loved me was a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, it's official. Julia's dead.",
        "Carly: What happened?",
        "Jack: I'm not really sure. There's no signs of a struggle, or evidence of a break-in right now, it looks like an accident. My lab guys are on it now.",
        "Carly: How's Holden? He must be shattered.",
        "Jack: Pretty much. Listen, I've gotta ask you a question.",
        "Carly: Me?",
        "Jack: Yeah. About Lily. Now are you sure that she was with you at our place all evening?",
        "Carly: Yeah, you saw her here yourself. What are you getting at?",
        "Jack: Nothing. It's just that, you know, if this turns into something more than an accident, I want to make sure that Lily's alibi's airtight.",
        "Carly: Well, it is. Lily was here all evening, just like I said.",
        "Jack: Hey, why don't I drive you out to Emma's man? You're gonna go crazy if you hang out here.",
        "Holden: I'm not going anywhere. Not until I find out what happened -- the truth.",
        "Jack: Holden that could take some time.",
        "Holden: I don't care. I've been sitting here thinking about this, and it doesn't make any sense. Julia was strong. She was healthy. People like Julia, they just don't fall and bang their heads. Somebody hurt her.",
        "Jack: Okay, just give my lab guys a chance to go through the place, all right?",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. But you and I both know that this was no accident. And I have a pretty good idea of who might've done it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Listen to me. I know this looks. But I'm -- I'm telling you, I did not -- I didn't do that to Julia. Do you understand?",
        "Luke: I didn't know what to think, Mom. I saw her lying on the floor, and I just got so scared. She wasn't moving or anything, and then I saw your gloves and --",
        "Lily: I was there. I went over to the apartment to clean it up, but then Julia, she came home. And we had an argument. I -- I shouldn't have let her get to me, but I did. I did. And I said something to her that made her very angry. And she attacked me. She attacked me. She was fighting with me and -- I don't know. I was so upset and so angry, I don't know how hard I pushed her. But the next thing I knew, she was on the floor. She'd hit her head, and she had fallen to the floor, but she was -- she was alive. She was. It was an accident. I swear to you. It a terrible, terrible accident.",
        "Luke: But you were the only one there, right? I mean, nobody else saw her attack you.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Luke: Well, then I'm glad I burned those gloves. Because even if it was an accident, it doesn't matter. They could still try to blame you.",
        "Lily: I suppose so.",
        "Luke: I know so. Dad got a court order to keep you away from Julia, because you were supposedly dangerous. You think anybody's gonna believe what you just told me? They'll lock you up. I couldn't take that chance.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Don't -- don't go anywhere. Please. Carly?",
        "Carly: I thought you should know. Holden found Julia's body.",
        "Lily: Already? Oh, my God. I knew this was going to happen, but I didn't realize it would be this soon. What are we going to do?",
        "Carly: Nothing yet. Jack is with Holden now at Julia's place.",
        "Lily: Did he tell you what's going on?",
        "Carly: He thinks that it might have been an accident. And he's right. It was. So, you just stick to our story and everything will be okay. Lily?",
        "Lily: I'm here.",
        "Carly: I am your alibi. Please don't get cold feet on me.",
        "Lily: It's more complicated than that. Luke knows what's going on. He went back to Julia's. Luke is involved.",
