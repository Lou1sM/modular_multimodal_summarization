        "Susan: You're getting their release papers ready. And like I said, Luke and Noah will be sore for a few days, but I think any long-term effects will be mainly psychological.",
        "Holden: I still can't believe this happened.",
        "Susan: Lucky you got there when you did. Thank God for that.",
        "Lily: Do you think it was just a coincidence that they were on their way to see Colonel Mayer?",
        "Holden: Look, I'm no fan of Winston Mayer, but I don't think he could have known about Noah's truck breaking down.",
        "Lily: He sent a message for Noah to come visit him.",
        "Holden: Noah didn't even want to go. Ameera was the one who wanted to see him.",
        "Lily: Exactly. What do we really know about this girl who just shows up out of nowhere?",
        "Holden: You think she had something to do with what happened?",
        "Lily: I don't know. What if -- what if the whole thing was a set-up? And what if Colonel Mayer sent Ameera here to find a way to hurt Luke and Noah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, you shouldn't be doing that. Your stitches aren't set.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, Matt disappeared and no one is here to cover the bar so I had no other choice. Shouldn't you be at work?",
        "Alison: Well, my shift's over and I wanted to catch up with Matt. Where did he say he was going?",
        "Casey: Um, he didn't. When I got here, another bartender was covering.",
        "Alison: Well, that's weird. When I left him in Old Town, he said he had to come back to the bar.",
        "Casey: Something must've came up.",
        "Alison: Or I was right and he is hiding something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Brad? Brad? Hey, where are you? Brad, I got your message -- whoa -- [Laughter] Very funny, very funny. You got me, okay? Get up. Brad? Brad? Brad, Brad, wake up. Brad, please -- please, wake -- Brad? Wake up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: Oh, damn it! Wrong blonde.",
        "Carly: Katie! Katie! Katie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: We can take you home.",
        "Luke: Great. I've had enough of hospitals.",
        "Noah: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Holden: Ameera, can we speak to you a minute? How are you? I'm sure this was very traumatic for you.",
        "Ameera: I feel terrible. This is all my fault.",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Ameera: I'm the reason we were on that road in the first place.",
        "Lily: Why were you so anxious to see Colonel Mayer?",
        "Ameera: He was like a father to me in Iraq. I couldn't believe when I heard he was in jail.",
        "Lily: What do you mean he was like a father to you? What do you mean?",
        "Ameera: Why are you asking me all these questions?",
        "Holden: We can't help but wonder if Colonel Mayer was behind this.",
        "Ameera: Behind what?",
        "Lily: Did he hire those men to beat up Luke and Noah and use you to carry out his plan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Brad, come on, come on, come on --",
        "Brad: Where am I?",
        "Bonnie: Brad, we're in the studio. Can you remember anything that happened?",
        "Brad: Ooh, my head hurts. Oh, man, did we do shots again?",
        "Bonnie: No, Brad, I came in and you were on the ground. Look, I'm going to call 911. Don't move. Hi, yes, I need an ambulance at WOAK. Someone's been hurt. No, no, he was unconscious and now he's awake. Yes, please, please, as soon as possible. Thank you. Thank you. Brad, help is on the way. Do you remember anything?",
        "Brad: I think someone knocked me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Katie! Katie, can you hear me?",
        "[Kit sneaks out the door with her bat]",
        "Jack: Carly?",
        "Carly: Jack!",
        "Jack: Yeah? Katie -- Katie's unconscious. I can't wake her up.",
        "Jack: What? Katie? Katie? Katie, Katie -- Katie. It's Jack.",
        "Katie: Jack?",
        "Jack: Hey --",
        "Katie: What happened? Ow, somebody hit me in the back of the head.",
        "Carly: Do you think Kit did this?",
        "Jack: I wouldn't know. Margo called off a guy I had tailing her. Listen, hey, don't worry, I'm going to take care of you. Go out to the farm and check on Parker.",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Jack: I've got to get her to the hospital. Let's sit you up.",
        "Katie: Oh, my head --",
        "Jack: I know, nice and slow. There we go. There we go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: I understand you hate him, but that's why I wanted Noah to take me to him. So I could see, try to understand. But what happened today had nothing to do with the Colonel or me. Those men would have hurt me, too.",
        "Lily: I'm not saying that you intentionally wanted Luke or Noah to be harmed. I'm saying, is it possible the Colonel had you lure them to that place?",
        "Ameera: I haven't see the Colonel since he left Iraq. I was the one those men were after, they tried to take me in their car. Luke and Noah protected me.",
        "Holden: She was just as much a victim in all this.",
        "Lily: You're right.",
        "Holden: Look, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to upset you. Just wanted to make sure that the Colonel didn't trick you into helping him.",
        "Susan: I've got release papers for you to sign.",
        "Holden: Okay, I'll take care of it.",
        "Lily: I'm just upset. I shouldn't have blamed you. I'm sorry.",
        "Ameera: I haven't known Luke or Noah long, but they've been really good to me. Noah is the closest thing I have to a brother.",
        "Lily: Come on, let's see if they need help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I don't get why you're so suspicious.",
        "Alison: Do you know of a customer that -- a special customer that Matt has here?",
        "Casey: We've got a lot of regulars if that's what you mean.",
        "Alison: He's run into this guy twice, and he gets all weird around him.",
        "Casey: Weird how?",
        "Alison: Well, the first time we saw him, he said he didn't know him. And then the next time, he said he knew him from work and he was a big tipper.",
        "Casey: What's so strange about that?",
        "Alison: Well, how many of your customers go around hounding you because you make such a great martini?",
        "Casey: It's about time, man.",
        "Alison: Where have you been?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Oh, what's going on?",
        "Bonnie: I found Brad unconscious at WOAK.",
        "Susan: Brad, what happened?",
        "Brad: From this goose egg on my head, I'd say someone knocked me out. I sure didn't see it coming.",
        "Susan: Put him in here. Let's take a look.",
        "Holden: That sounds rough.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. He scared me half to death. I think he's going to be okay, though. He was already making bad jokes in the ambulance, so -- what are you doing here?",
        "Holden: Uh, Luke and Noah were beat up.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, my God.",
        "Holden: Yeah, Lily and I -- we got there just in time. It was horrible. But thank God they're going to be okay.",
        "Bonnie: Well, how are you?",
        "Holden: Me? I'm fine. We were just about to take them home.",
        "Bonnie: We?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Looks like Lily and I are going to try and work things out.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, I always knew that's where your heart was. You know, I'm going to see how Brad's doing. Take care of yourself, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: I had to stop by the bank before it was closed. I'm really sorry to leave you hanging, man. Let me -- let me wash up and I'll take over, okay?",
        "Alison: What happened to your pants?",
        "Matt: Oh, man, what --",
        "Casey: It looks like the WOAK logo.",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.",
        "Matt: Yeah, well, what is it doing on my butt?",
        "Alison: Good question.",
        "Casey: Oh, my gosh, wait, you're telling me someone turned you into a walking ad without you even knowing?",
        "Matt: Yeah, I guess. You know, they were stenciling them around town, I think I just bumping into one. I hope it comes out.",
        "Alison: Hey, don't tell me that's not suspicious.",
        "Casey: Actually, I think it's pretty funny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Bonnie was just giving her good wishes.",
        "Luke: I can't wait to get out of here.",
        "Holden: Is Brad okay?",
        "Susan: Nothing a few aspirin and an ice pack can't cure.",
        "Lily: Brad's here?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I'll explain on the way out. Let's get these guys home.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Susan: Take it easy.",
        "Nurse #3: Is that room free? We're backed up in emergency.",
        "Susan: It's all yours.",
        "Jack: Susan, hey -- the E.R. sent us up here. Would you mind taking a look at Katie?",
        "Susan: What is going on? I just gave away my last room.",
        "Katie: Its okay, I'm fine.",
        "Jack: No, you need a doctor. She was whacked on the head pretty hard.",
        "Susan: I'm going to double you up. There's an extra gurney in there. Take her in there, Jack.",
        "Jack: Sure --",
        "Susan: And I'll take a look -- could you help her up on that gurney?",
        "Jack: You got it --",
        "Katie: Oh, you've got to be kidding me.",
        "Brad: Were you in an accident? Why are you here?",
        "Susan: Excuse me, I kind of like to know how this happened myself.",
        "Katie: I -- someone hit me from behind when I was at Carly's house. And no, it wasn't -- ow -- it wasn't her.",
        "Susan: Oh, sorry.",
        "Brad: Who hit you?",
        "Katie: I don't know who it was. I didn't see them. What happened to you?",
        "Brad: Never mind about me. Are you okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Brad: What are you doing at Carly's?",
        "Katie: I was picking up a book for Parker.",
        "Jack: Okay, enough of the third degree. She was unconscious when I found her. I don't think she was out very long.",
        "Brad: Well, I guess you're lucky your white knight showed up.",
        "Jack: Will you let Susan do her exam, please? What are you doing here anyway?",
        "Brad: I got whacked on the head, too, at the studio. You know, which you'd think that my -- my brother the detective, oh, I'm sorry, ex-detective, would be concerned about.",
        "Katie: Are you all right?",
        "Bonnie: No, he's fine. I found him and called 911.",
        "Katie: You just happened by?",
        "Bonnie: No, Brad called me to meet him for a date.",
        "Katie: Oh, I guess you're lucky she was there.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I was.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You both were hit on the head near around the same time in different places?",
        "Brad: Yeah, what's up with that?",
        "Katie: It must be a coincidence, right?",
        "Susan: Excuse me, could you people please give me two minutes to finish my job?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Where'd Alison go?",
        "Casey: She had to leave. And you should be glad. Because she's asking a lot of questions about you.",
        "Matt: Oh, yeah? Do you think she's into me?",
        "Casey: Um, she's into wondering why you've been hanging out with some guy you said was a special customer. What's that about?",
        "Matt: It's no big deal, that guy's nobody.",
        "Casey: Hey, man, it's me you're talking to. Your old cellmate. What are you up to?",
        "Matt: Give me a break, man. I ran into a regular and I was being friendly to him.",
        "Casey: No, I know I owe you, man. But I'm tired of lying to my friends and family about how we met. You know, why can't you just come clean and tell them we were in Statesville together?",
        "Matt: You're not going to say a word to anyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Jack! Where's Katie? Where is she?",
        "Jack: Hey, she's -- she's fine. She's a little shaken up, but Susan's in with her now. She'll be out in a minute.",
        "Margo: Well, what the hell happened?",
        "Jack: Carly found Katie unconscious on her kitchen floor. Katie came by to get a book for Parker and we think that Kit attacked her.",
        "Margo: Kit? So Kit is your go-to for every crime that happens in Oakdale now?",
        "Jack: Margo, there is something that you don't know. Carly provoked Kit. She told Kit that we had evidence to prove that she was the one who killed Sam.",
        "Margo: Why? Why would she do that, Jack? I was very clear, telling both of you to stay away from Kit. Let me handle the investigation of Parker's case --",
        "Jack: The point is, I think Carly was the target, only Kit attacked Katie instead. And when she found out her mistake, she took off.",
        "Margo: That is exactly why I wanted you to stay out of this. If Kit is involved -- that's a big if Kit, then innocent people could get hurt. Innocent people like, oh, say, my sister.",
        "Jack: There was no way to know that Katie was going to be in her kitchen. Are you kidding me?",
        "Margo: Exactly, my point. Where is Kit now?",
        "Jack: Well, that's the $100,000 question, isn't it, Chief, since you called off the tail I had on her.",
        "Margo: Well, I wasn't going to waste manpower on trailing a suspect that we have no credible evidence against. But let's just say that your theory does have some sort of merit. And you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to put Carly under 24 hour protection starting now --",
        "Jack: No, no, don't do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi, Honey.",
        "Faith: Hey. What happened to you two?",
        "Luke: Oh, we're fine. You should see the other guys.",
        "Faith: Did you get in a fight?",
        "Luke: Uh, it's -- it's no big deal.",
        "Noah: Looks worse than it is.",
        "Holden: Actually, it is a big deal, and I think Faith should know about it.",
        "Lily: Honey, Luke and Noah were beat up by some very prejudice boys who were giving Ameera a hard time.",
        "Faith: Because you're not from here?",
        "Ameera: Yes. But your brother and Noah were very brave. They defended me.",
        "Holden: That's not the whole story.",
        "Luke: Dad, I really don't think we need to go there.",
        "Holden: I do. Luke and Noah were beaten up by some guys because they're gay.",
        "Faith: They beat you up because you love one another?",
        "Luke: Yeah, basically.",
        "Faith: I hate them.",
        "Holden: Well, we're going to make sure that the ones who did this are punished.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You are so messing me, Jack. First, you want the police involved when they shouldn't be. And now, I offer you help and you refuse.",
        "Jack: I want Carly safe, but if there's a chance that we can catch Kit in the process, I don't want to scare her off. Let me protect Carly.",
        "Margo: Oh, the way you protected Katie? All right, let's say this is all true, then you know what? I just can't afford another murder on my watch. How is Katie?",
        "Susan: Uh, she'll have to take it easy and watch for signs of a concussion, but she'll be all right. Why don't you go on in?",
        "Margo: Hi, hey, I came as soon as Jack called me. Are you all right? What's going on?",
        "Katie: I'm all right.",
        "Margo: What is he doing here?",
        "Brad: How about a little sympathy? You know, I got conked in the head, too.",
        "Margo: Somebody want to tell me what the hell is going on here today?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: They're chatting in there like nothing happened.",
        "Holden: We were right to explain it to Faith. And I'm glad that they're home. I'm glad that they're safe.",
        "Lily: Um, maybe I want to change the subject, just for a second. At the hospital, I remembered something.",
        "Holden: What's that?",
        "Lily: A lot of things, but seeing you with Bonnie, I think she still has feelings for you.",
        "Holden: I told you there was nothing going on between me and Bonnie.",
        "Lily: That's because of me, I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: Of course it's because of you. And there's nothing to be sorry about.",
        "Lily: I just wondered if you regret letting her go.",
        "Holden: What are you saying? If you want me to find someone else because you don't think that our marriage is going to work out, then just tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Well, that is a coincidence that both of you were attacked and hit on the head at the same time, but I just can't really see how they could be connected. I'll look into it, at any rate. Nothing was taken from your office, your wallet, anything?",
        "Brad: I'd have to check and see, but it doesn't look the place was robbed.",
        "Susan: Your release papers are ready. Now, I want both of you to take it easy tonight, but don't go to sleep for eight hours or so, in case of a concussion. And don't forget to check in at the desk.",
        "Margo: Okay, Toots, so, you're going to come home with me tonight, then, okay?",
        "Katie: Oh, thank you, Margo, but I'm just going to go back to the Lakeview and relax. I will have the front desk call every hour, if that makes you feel better.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, all right, I won't argue with you. I've got to get to the station and get your reports started. Um, somebody's coming to come over to WOAK and look around to see if there's anything suspicious. And, you, you call me every hour, okay?",
        "Katie: I will, I promise.",
        "Margo: Every half hour --",
        "Katie: Thank you. I'm okay.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry I was a jerk before. I'm glad that Jack was there to help you. And I'm really glad that you're okay.",
        "Katie: And I'm really glad that you're so thick-headed.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you've got to admit, it's kind of weird that, you know, we're both here at the same time. Maybe it's the universe trying to tell us something.",
        "Katie: Yeah, trying to knock some sense into us for what we did before. I'm going to go get the release papers.",
        "Brad: Wait. Just wait. Wait. Maybe I'm hard-headed, but I have a hard time -- I have a hard time believing that you're not feeling the same thing I am. We can't pretend that nothing happened.",
        "Katie: Are you talking about getting knocked out?",
        "Brad: Don't act like you've got amnesia. I'm talking about what made our heads spin earlier",
        "Katie: Whoa -- sit down. Sit down. You okay?",
        "Brad: You know, when I'm close to you, I can't help it --",
        "Jack: Everything okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah, no, it's good. Brad was just getting dizzy. He was going to fall, so I caught him.",
        "Jack: You shouldn't be exerting yourself like that.",
        "Bonnie: Should I get Susan back in here?",
        "Katie: No, no, he wouldn't want to drag this out any longer, right?",
        "Jack: Okay, well, you're free to go any time.",
        "Katie: Okay, let's go.",
        "Bonnie: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Brad: I'm fine, I just moving too fast, yeah.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, you're all right?",
        "Brad: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: So, after what happened today, are you sure you want to stay in America?",
        "Ameera: It was terrible. But there are bad people everywhere. I do want to stay in America, but I can't.",
        "Faith: Why not?",
        "Ameera: My visa expires soon and I'll have to go back.",
        "Luke: But you have nothing to go back to.",
        "Ameera: I have no choice. I thought the Colonel could help me, but he's in prison.",
        "Noah: I'm not sure the Colonel would have had any answers.",

        "Casey: Dude, you're an idiot. She already thinks something's up. Whatever she imagined is probably worse than the truth.",
        "Matt: What could be worse than being an ex-con?",
        "Casey: Okay, she told you about her past. What makes you think she's going to care? You know, she knows I was in jail and she's still my friend.",
        "Matt: It's different, man. Everyone sees you as a good guy. They just think you messed up.",
        "Casey: They would do the same for you.",
        "Matt: Yeah, I wish I could believe that, Dude. My whole life, I've been a screw-up, okay? Even when I don't do anything wrong. That's just the way people look at me. It's been really nice, you know, getting the benefit of the doubt for a change. And now, I'm being treated like a regular guy.",

        "Jack: Parker? What would you think someone was after Parker?",
        "Katie: Because he told me that you and Carly didn't want him going to the house. That's why I went to pick the book for him. I figured you were worried that Kit was going to come after him.",
        "Jack: No, she wasn't after Parker, she's after Carly.",
        "Katie: Why would she be after Carly?",

        "Jack: Yeah, and I will do anything for them.",
        "Katie: You know, my head is really starting to throb. Why don't you go check on Parker? Please make sure that he got the book that he needed, and tell him that I'm going to be fine and not to worry, because I know he's going to.",
        "Jack: I still care about you, Katie. But maybe -- maybe it is selfish of me to want you in my life when all I do is hurt you.",

        "Carly: How so?",

        "Casey: Okay, bye-bye. That was really low, man.",
        "Matt: Come on, it's not a big deal. You can just tell her you changed your mind.",
        "Casey: No, you don't know my mom. She's actually going to expect me to go through with this.",

        "Luke: Oh, thanks, Faithy, but I don't think it's that easy.",
        "Luke: It's a really good idea, but when you're enrolled in college, it takes a lot of requirements.",
        "Ameera: He's right. I don't have my records or any way to get them. And how would I pay for tuition?",
        "Holden: Well, there might be a way around that. Lucinda's on the board of Oakdale U. Maybe she can put in a good word. See if they can bend the rules.",

        "Holden: What a day. You know, we can't protect them from all the bad stuff in the world, but at least we can be there for them when things do happen. And how about Faith helping out Ameera? All the family working together, it's got to be a good thing, right?",
        "Lily: It is. But what about us? I mean, seriously, Holden, am I -- am I enough for you?",
        "Holden: Do I want us closer? Yes. But if you need more time, I can deal with that.",

        "Susan: It must run in the family because if I didn't know better, I would think that half my patients today were pulling some sort of publicity stunt. What are the odds of both of Oakdale Now's co-hosts showing up here with the same head injury from unrelated incidents?",
