        "It's Meg's first day back on the job at the hospital and she shares some information with Lucy on her first day too. Dusty stops by and Lucy tries to avoid anything personal. She does say that Johnny was her whole life and now there is a big hole there. Meg notices the tension between them, but she accepts Dusty's invitation to go out and celebrate her first day back. Emily laments to Paul that she thinks he is whacko for thinking Meg will give him another chance. He insists that she still cares and if she does there is some chance. Paul drops by the farm and is so smooth and polite in thanking Meg for letting him spend time with their daughter. He then dashes to Emily's and asks her out for a night at the Lakeview. They both know Meg will be there with Dusty so if Paul manages to push her buttons, great! Lucy is over the top to be staying with Johnny, never mind that it was Carly's idea. She calls Dusty to give him this opportunity to come and spend time with Johnny. It's all she can do for now, they have to be patient. He brings Johnny a gift and they have a great time playing. Lucy reminisces but Dusty says they can not go back. Dusty calls Meg to break their date. She's already at the Lakeview, but stops on her way out to confront Paul and Emily who have shown up and are conducting a little love session at the bar. She knows it is for her benefit, but states this jealousy bit won't work.",
        "Alone with Stan for a few minutes, Carly is greeted by a slick move and an unwanted kiss. Craig arrives just in time to punch him in the mouth. He tells Stan to get out, they are no longer partners. He quips to Carly anyone else that wants to kiss her will have to kiss him first. Dusty drops by the farm and Meg is not too receptive, but he barges on in. He even confesses where he really was with Johnny. She realizes this means every time he sees Johnny that Lucy will be there too. He knows that Meg is jealous and takes her in his arms and plants a kiss on her. At Paul's, he gloats that Meg was just using Dusty to get to him. Emily spills her drink and rips off her blouse, but tells Paul not to get ideas. Craig makes a toast with Carly since he was the hero tonight, a chance to celebrate. He's like to pull an all-nighter with her, but she nixes that idea since he has Johnny to think off. She thanks him for saving her from Stan and gulps another slug of vodka."

        "Lucy: Could you do me a favor and check the O.R. schedule? Find out who's doing Mr. Jackson's double bypass.",
        "Meg: Actually, I'm in the middle of patient rounds. But the schedule's posted on the nurses' station desk. Look, I know you haven't been here for a while, so you wouldn't know that. But doctors check it out themselves now.",
        "Lucy: Oh, thanks for the update.",
        "Meg: Any time. Hey, aren't you something?",
        "Dusty: I am?",
        "Meg: Yeah, by coming here on my first day back at work. How'd you know?",
        "Dusty: Actually, I didn't know.",
        "Meg: Oh, oops. So, why are you here?",
        "Dusty: I came to see Lucy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Does she ever not give in to you?",
        "Paul: Who?",
        "Emily: Who? Meg. I can't believe she's letting you to spend time with Eliza.",
        "Paul: It's called visitation, Emily. And luckily, Meg shares my belief that it is equally beneficial to Eliza and myself.",
        "Emily: Yes, even if the father is certifiable?",
        "Paul: Emily Stewart, please meet Beverly Foncillas, the court-appointed social worker who's supervising my little father-daughter visit.",
        "Emily: Oh, oh. Well, you want some advice? Don't let him out of your sight.",
        "Beverly: I'll be waiting over there.",
        "Paul: You really think that's funny?",
        "Emily: No, actually, I don't. And I do think Meg's smart to have someone on your tail. Because, I mean, I know you can't like someone looking over your shoulder every day.",
        "Paul: I don't like it at all. It's just the first step.",
        "Emily: Towards what?",
        "Paul: Winning Meg back so the three of us can be a family again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: This is my first day back, Dusty. I can't be seen talking about personal business.",
        "Dusty: Have you made any progress convincing your father to let me see my son?",
        "Lucy: Not yet.",
        "Dusty: Have you brought it up?",
        "Lucy: The timing hasn't been right.",
        "Dusty: It's been a few days.",
        "Lucy: We can't rush this. At this stage in the game, my father doesn't even want me seeing Johnny yet. I can't very well start leaning on him about you. At least not until he starts to trust me.",
        "Dusty: We had a deal, remember? Your freedom in exchange for some regular time with my son.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I haven't forgot about that. But you have to let me do this my way, okay? If we start to hit this too hard too fast, then he's just going to dig in his heels and we'll never get him to change his mind.",
        "Dusty: How long do you think it'll take?",
        "Lucy: I have no idea. I have to get to work.",
        "Dusty: That's not good enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I knew it was too good to be true.",
        "Craig: What was?",
        "Carly: Getting through an entire day without laying eyes on you.",
        "Craig: And I was so excited to see you.",
        "Carly: I suppose you want something.",
        "Craig: Well, I realized I never had a chance to explain how I managed to get our friend Stan to give us a second chance.",
        "Carly: Well, I only care about how big an order he placed.",
        "Craig: Ah, well, he actually hasn't made an order yet.",
        "Carly: Oh, sure he has, 'cause you said --",
        "Craig: No, he requested another private party before he'll actually sign on the dotted line.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, I hope the two of you have fun. 'Cause I have a date with Clark Gable.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm sorry, but Clark is going to have to take a rain check, because Stan specifically requested you.",
        "Carly: Even after I almost puked on his shoes?",
        "Craig: Oh, he's willing to overlook that little indiscretion. As long as you show him to be the reliable and creative genius that I promised him you are.",
        "Carly: I have to prove myself to a man who called me \"Sweetheart\" all night? Condescending.",
        "Craig: I know, it's ridiculous. But if Stan comes on board, other buyers will follow. So, will you do it?",
        "Carly: I was really looking forward to this and that. And a nice, quiet evening.",
        "Craig: And you'll have it, as soon as we have Stan's signature on a contract.",
        "Carly: Okay. But I'm not taking him on alone.",
        "Craig: Oh, no, you won't have to. I've already made arrangements with the hotel to send someone to sit with Johnny. But I only have him for a couple of hours, so we really should get going.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. No. 'Cause in a couple of hours, Stan is going to be three sheets to the wind and I'm going to be left there alone to cajole him into signing something because you will have left to relieve the babysitter. No.",
        "Craig: That's the best I could do.",
        "Carly: No. The best you can do is getting someone who would love to stay with Johnny for as long as you need.",
        "Craig: Like who?",
        "Carly: Like your daughter.",
        "Craig: No, no. Absolutely, out of the question.",
        "Carly: Come on, you'd leave your son with a complete stranger and not with his own sister?",
        "Craig: A stranger didn't kidnap my son and disappear on me.",
        "Carly: Lucy is not going to do anything like that ever again. Obviously, she's trying to make peace.",
        "Craig: Oh, she's changed. But I can't help but wonder how much of that change has to do with Dusty.",
        "Carly: Are they really that close?",
        "Craig: Well, they're close enough. I wouldn't put it past her to start lobbying on Dusty's behalf to try to convince me to let him spend more time with Johnny.",
        "Carly: Would that really be so horrible?",
        "Craig: Spending time with Dusty confuses Johnny.",
        "Carly: And threatens you.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Carly: Rivalry. You can't stand the thought that Johnny might like some other man more than he likes you.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's absurd.",
        "Carly: Yes, it is. Doesn't mean it's not true.",
        "Craig: You really think I'm that insecure?",
        "Carly: Obviously. Otherwise, you wouldn't be so unwilling to let Johnny spend time with people he loves. People who love him back.",
        "Craig: Fine. I'll call her.",
        "Carly: Good for you.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but as for not wanting Dusty to spend time with Johnny, it's not a popularity contest. It's about my son's emotional well being.",
        "Carly: Whatever you say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I wish I could give you more. I can't.",
        "Dusty: Can't or won't? Now that you're free and clear, you're not blowing me off, are you?",
        "Lucy: You know me. I wouldn't do that to you. At least I thought you knew me.",
        "Dusty: This isn't a game. I need so see my son.",
        "Lucy: I understand that.",
        "Dusty: I don't think you do.",
        "Lucy: Do you know how many times I've gotten up in the middle of the night to go check on him, only to remember that he's not there? Or how many mornings I've gotten out his toothbrush and his toothpaste, only to remember that he's not there, I have to stop myself? Johnny was my whole life. My reason for being. And now, there is a gigantic, gaping hole where he used to be. So yeah, I get it. More than you know.",
        "[Pager beeping]",
        "Lucy: I have to take this.",
        "Meg: Hey, hey, hey. You leaving?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Meg: Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Dusty: I want to see my son.",
        "Meg: Well, did Lucy say she would intervene with Craig on your behalf?",
        "Dusty: She says it won't happen overnight. But, you don't need to hear this. I'll let you finish work.",
        "Meg: No, no, no. I am almost done with my shift.",
        "Dusty: Congratulations on going back to work, by the way.",
        "Meg: Thank you, but you can toast me at the Lakeview. You know, I feel like I should go out and celebrate my first day back at work. And I think you should come with me.",
        "Dusty: I'm not very good company.",
        "Meg: I'll be the judge of that. Come on. I need a night out and you need a distraction. It won't be a big deal. Just a drink with a friend.",
        "Dusty: What time do you want to meet?",
        "Meg: I have to go home and put Eliza to bed. About a half an hour from now?",
        "Dusty: I'll see you then.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hi. So when was the last time you saw your therapist?",
        "Paul: Where'd that come from?",
        "Emily: Well, I was just thinking. I'm not sure, do you have weekly appointments? Because if you don't, you really should do that. These delusions are getting out of control.",
        "Paul: I am not delusional.",
        "Emily: You're talking about getting back together with Meg. It's wacko.",
        "Paul: 'Cause Meg still loves me. And as long as that's the case, there's still hope.",
        "Emily: Has she actually said that to you? I mean, has she told you that she would consider taking you back?",
        "Paul: Not in so many words. But she made it clear.",
        "Emily: How?",
        "Paul: How? Well, the other night, I was out with someone and she saw me. And her reaction was very dramatic.",
        "Emily: Whoa, wait, who were you out with?",
        "Paul: Not someone -- well, actually, it may be someone that you know. But that's not important. The important thing is that Meg was not happy about it.",
        "Emily: Well, that doesn't mean she wants you back, sorry.",
        "Paul: No, but as long as she feels something, that proves that she cares. And as long as she cares, there's still the possibility that we could get back together.",
        "Beverly: It's time to get the baby back. Ms. Snyder will be home from work soon.",
        "Paul: Okay, thanks. Wish me luck.",
        "Emily: Good luck. Here, can I get this for you? You're going to need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey. Hey, what are you doing?",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd be back here.",
        "Meg: Where is Beverly?",
        "Paul: I told her she should go when we got here, if it's okay. I can still catch her, there's probably --",
        "Meg: No, no, no, never mind. Never mind. Hi, Honey, how are you? Do you know how much Mommy missed you? Hey.",
        "Paul: You're a great mom.",
        "Meg: Has she eaten?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I gave her a bottle a few minutes ago. And I changed her. You know, I thought about not changing her and letting you do it, but I figured I owe you.",
        "Meg: Yeah, you do.",
        "Paul: So how was your first day?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: Back at the hospital?",
        "Meg: How did you know?",
        "Paul: Beverly told me.",
        "Meg: Oh, well, it was great being back to work, even though I was a little rusty.",
        "Paul: Come on, you? You're a terrific nurse. You're really good at what you do.",
        "Meg: Well, thank you for bringing her back on time.",
        "Paul: You wear earrings to work?",
        "Meg: No, I don't. I'm going out.",
        "Paul: On a date? I mean, you have every right. I shouldn't say anything. It'd probably be really good for you to get out, you know?",
        "Meg: It's not a date. I am going to the Lakeview for drinks to celebrate my being back at work. And don't worry, Mama's watching Eliza.",
        "Paul: I'm not worried. It's nice, you know, of your fellow nurses to throw you a little party like that. It's really nice.",
        "Meg: It's not my fellow nurses. It's just a friend.",
        "Paul: Girl friend?",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what, stop fishing. It's Dusty, all right? And it's not a date. And it's also none of your business.",
        "Paul: No, I suppose not. Thank you for letting me spend some time with our little girl. Have fun. Hey you, who is the new guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're not busy, right?",
        "Emily: No, no. No, not me. Not at all.",
        "Paul: Well, whatever you're doing, I need you more.",
        "Emily: What now?",
        "Paul: Dinner at the Lakeview.",
        "Emily: What, now?",
        "Paul: No, some other night. Yeah, now. I would appreciate an answer.",
        "Emily: Sure. Why not?",
        "Paul: Really? That's it? No arguing? No third degree?",
        "Emily: Let me see, I already know that Meg is having dinner at the Lakeview tonight.",
        "Paul: You know, she might be, yes.",
        "Emily: And if she sees you with me?",
        "Paul: It hopefully will push some buttons.",
        "Emily: You are aware of how childish this is, right?",
        "Paul: It's all I've got.",
        "Emily: You buying?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay. Let's go. Is there a problem?",
        "Paul: No, but I mean, you don't have something else to wear kind of lying around here, do you?",
        "Emily: No, I don't usually pack a change of clothes in my bag. What are you doing?",
        "Paul: It's fine, perfectly.",
        "Emily: Thanks.",
        "Paul: You don't have some other way to kind of, you know, I don't know, make yourself hotter?",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Don't push it, Ryan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey, Baby! What's up? It's good to see you! Hey, let me see that tooth of yours. Did it come out yet? Okay, well when it does, let me know, because I got an inside track with the tooth fairy. To what do I owe this surprise?",
        "Craig: We just wanted to see how your first day back at work went.",
        "Lucy: Well, that was nice of you.",
        "Craig: It seems that you survived all right. Let your sister sit down.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Come here. Yeah, I survived. I mean, after a few hours, it was almost like I'd never even left.",
        "Craig: Yeah, this town has a way of doing that to you.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I'm surprised Bob had me reinstated me at all.",
        "Craig: It's to the hospital's benefit that he did.",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Well, if you're not too tired after your first day back in the frying pan, do you think you have enough energy left over to babysit your brother?",
        "Lucy: You mean it?",
        "Craig: Carly and I have to meet with a buyer. It should only take a couple of hours, but it might take longer.",
        "Lucy: No, take all the time you want! Are you hearing it? We're going to get to hang out again, just like old times. Thank you.",
        "Craig: Well, don't thank me. Thank Carly. It was her idea. I just hope I don't regret listening to her.",
        "Lucy: I love Johnny. And what could be harm in that?",
        "Craig: Well, the problem is, your idea and my idea of harm are two different things.",
        "Lucy: Well, we both want Johnny to be happy. And he looks pretty psyched right now.",
        "Craig: All right, I'll allow it on one condition, that you don't leave the hotel with him for any reason.",
        "Lucy: I promise. You can even call and check up on us if you want.",
        "Craig: I will. All right, big guy. Come here, give your daddy a hug. You have a good time with your sister, all right? Here you go.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Come on, Baby. We are going to order room service and get some ice cream. I bet I know what you want to do first. All right, go pick out some games and I will order -- hmm. Two hot fudge sundaes and a large order of cheese fries, yeah? Hey, come here. I missed you. It's so good to see you. Go, scoot.",
        "[Lucy remembering]",
        "Dusty: This isn't a game. I need to see my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings] Lucy, I'm glad you called. I know I came down a little hard on you.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, you did. But just to prove I'm not playing games, what are you doing tonight?",
        "Dusty: Nothing special. Why?",
        "Lucy: Well, I just got back from work to find my father and Johnny waiting for me in the hotel lobby.",
        "Dusty: Is Johnny all right?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, he's picking out a video game as we speak.",
        "Dusty: He's with you?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, my father had some business meeting that he had to go to, so he asked me to watch him. I was going to ask you if you wanted to join us, but if you have other plans.",
        "Dusty: Are you kidding me? I'll be right over.",
        "Lucy: Oh, well, in that case, I'm ordering room service. Are you hungry?",
        "Dusty: Wait a minute. Lucy, is Craig was okay with this or no? Lucy?",
        "Lucy: He doesn't know.",
        "Dusty: 'Cause sneaking around is not what I want.",
        "Lucy: Would you rather I hadn't called at all?",
        "Dusty: No. I just hate seeing my son this way, that's all.",
        "Lucy: It's the best that I can do for now. Like I said, we have to take things slowly with my father. One day, he'll realize that I'm not a threat, and neither are you. But right now, he's still really suspicious. So he can't know that I'm trying to help you reconnect with Johnny. It would undo all the progress that we've made.",
        "Dusty: Okay. I won't say anything.",
        "Lucy: So should I make it three hot fudge sundaes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Here we are. I think the real test will be vodkas on the market in flavors that haven't been on the market before. But I do believe that once people see our bottle and our label, they won't be able to help at least giving it a try.",
        "Stan: Well, how could anybody resist what you're selling, Sweetheart?",
        "Carly: You know, it's funny you should say that. I happen to have a contract right over here.",
        "Stan: Has anyone ever told you what a beautiful mouth you have?",
        "Carly: A big. I've heard that I have a very big mouth. In fact, my partner says it all the time. I'm going to give him a call, because I think that he should probably be here by now.",
        "Stan: We don't need him, do we?",
        "Craig: Excuse me. Thank you, Carly.",
        "Craig: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Stan: Trying to get to know my new business partner.",
        "Craig: She's not your partner.",
        "Carly: Craig --",
        "Craig: And neither am I.",
        "Carly: Craig, I don't think that we want to make a mistake here.",
        "Craig: He's the one that made the mistake. Get out. Are you all right?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I'm fine. And now, we've just lost our chance to give our product the best showcase in the country.",
        "Craig: We don't need him.",
        "Carly: That's not what you said earlier.",
        "Craig: Since when are you in the habit of listening to me?",
        "Carly: Stop trying to make me feel better.",
        "Craig: Carly, that creep came in here to take something from you. And nothing that you would have done would have stopped him from trying. The mistake was mine for sending you here to meet him alone.",
        "Carly: I should've been able to handle it fine.",
        "Craig: You shouldn't have had to. We run an equal opportunity, nonsexist company here. And if every Neanderthal and his uncle thinks he has to seal the deal with a kiss from you, well then, they're just going to have to kiss me, too.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Craig: What, you think they won't want to?",
        "Carly: No, I -- thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi. This is a surprise.",
        "Meg: Not really. I did tell you I was coming here.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you said you were going out, I wasn't sure where. And when Emily suggested this place, it just didn't register.",
        "Meg: I'll bet it didn't.",
        "Emily: So are you dining alone?",
        "Meg: I'm meeting Dusty.",
        "Emily: Oh. It's not like him to be late.",
        "Meg: He'll be here.",
        "Emily: Hmm. We should get a drink.",
        "Paul: Why don't you go on ahead? I want to talk to Meg for a second.",
        "Emily: Okay, yeah, sure.",
        "Meg: Okay, look, if you're here to grill me about meeting Dusty --",
        "Paul: I want to thank you again for letting me spend so much time with Eliza.",
        "Meg: And?",
        "Paul: And nothing. It was really great.",

        "Meg: They're supervised visits, brought on by the court --",
        "Paul: You know, it's really nice, actually, to have another set of eyes in case something goes wrong. And if that's the arrangement that you want, then it's fine with me. If that's the price I have to pay to spend a little time with our little girl, its well worth it. Enjoy your meal.",
        "Emily: You know, if you wanted her to think you've moved on, standing there having a heart-to-heart really wasn't a good idea.",
        "Paul: I should've known.",
        "Emily: What now?",
        "Paul: She said it wasn't a date. She sure as hell wasn't wearing that the last time I saw her. Can I have, like, 11 drinks?",
        "Emily: Okay, are you going to sit here stewing, or are you going to do something about it?",
        "Paul: Are you kidding? Look how great she looks! My only hope is that Dusty doesn't even show up.",
        "Emily: Okay, well, aren't you supposed to make her jealous?",
        "Paul: Okay, that plan doesn't seem to be working.",

Just like when we used to play that game \"Don't tell\". You were really good at that game, huh? So I want you to be good at it again, okay? Okay, good.",

        "Meg: No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I was just going to tell you that I was running late.",
        "Dusty: Good. Again, I'm sorry, but this thing came up.",

        "Lucy: Yeah, you're right. But I have to admit, there were times when I was with Johnny that I couldn't help thinking about those old dreams. I couldn't help wondering if you hadn't been at war with my father, and if I'd stayed in Oakdale, maybe the two of us --",
        "Dusty: There's no going back.",
