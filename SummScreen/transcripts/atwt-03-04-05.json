        "Jennifer: Done. Done. And I need some coffee.",
        "Craig: No, no. What you need is sleep. Why don't you go home and get some?",
        "Jennifer: Because we have this media event happening in less than 12 hours and we still have the presentation to finalize, the samples to organize --",
        "Craig: We'll take care of all of that.",
        "Jennifer: Craig, there's no time to take care of it any other time than now. Wait a minute, what are you -- first, you insist that we work though the night and now you're shoving me out the door?",
        "Craig: Just looking out for my star designer.",
        "Jennifer: Unless there's someone that you don't want me to see.",
        "Craig: Oh, no. I think you're getting paranoid you're so exhausted.",
        "Jennifer: How did you get rid of my mother?",
        "Craig: Hmm?",
        "Jennifer: You said you got rid of my mother.",
        "Craig: No. No, my exact words were --",
        "Jennifer: Did you get rid of my mother?",
        "Craig: No, not exactly.",
        "Jennifer: And you let me keep working knowing that -- I'm not coming back.",
        "Craig: Oh, come on! What about the big bash to roll out of the new line?",
        "Jennifer: You said that you would get rid of my mother and you didn't!",
        "Craig: I will! I will.",
        "Jennifer: You can't, Craig! Just admit it, when it comes to dealing with my mother, you're completely out of your league.",
        "Craig: Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Reporting for duty. And judging by the noises I heard all the way down the hall, I'm just in time. Is Craig annoying you, sweetheart? Tell Mama all about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: We have one day off of school. One.",
        "Casey: Dude, five more minutes. If I make sure things are cool with Aaron, then we'll go pick up my car.",
        "Will: Well, judging from the look on his face, it's going to take longer than five minutes.",
        "Casey: Hey, Aaron, I'm really sorry about last night. I know it was the opening and everything but --",
        "Aaron: You know, this Street Jeans event is very important.",
        "Casey: I know. I mean, dude, I brought in a bunch of new CDs and they're great.",
        "Aaron: I'm sure they are, Casey. But, I'm sorry. I have to let you go. Here's your pay for the last week and if you need some help getting that stuff out, you just let me know.",
        "Will: Now can we go?",
        "Margo: Casey!",
        "Casey: Mom, what are you doing here?",
        "Margo: I just got back from Chicago, Casey. Here are your keys.",
        "Casey: Cool. You got my car out of impound?",
        "Margo: Cool. Cost me $345, Casey. So, until you pay back every dime of it, everything you make at this joint comes directly to me. What's this?",
        "Casey: My first and last paycheck. I just got fired.",
        "Margo: What? You know why? 'Cause you were off with that girl instead of being here and being responsible, Casey.",
        "Casey: No, hey, getting stuck in Chicago is all on me. It's not Celia's fault.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Casey: Mom, she's actually a nice girl.",
        "Celia: Guess what I just did.",
        "Will: Something that will cost Casey more money?",
        "Celia: I just interviewed for Oakdale Latin. And if they accept me, I'll be going to school with you guys! And we can hang out together all the time. Isn't that hot?",
        "Margo: It's scorching. Celia, I think it's time you and I had a little chat.",

        "Lily: Oh, my God.",
        "Carly: What? That's got to be J.J.'s.",
        "Lily: What have I done to that little boy? That poor little boy.",
        "Carly: It's awful that things have come to this, but it cannot be undone. We have children of our own who need us. That's why we're doing this. That's how this all started because we needed to protect your family. Your family and mine.",
        "Lily: Oh, God, help me. I don't think I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Holden remembering]",
        "Julia: I think that we better put a rush on the mattress order because as much as like roughing it, and I do, there's still some things I prefer doing in a bed.",
        "Holden: Got it.",
        "Julia: Okay.",
        "Holden: All right, so I'll put that on my list. You need coffee, a mattress, pots and pans -- what else?",
        "Julia: Just you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, they tracked Keith down. They're bringing him in.",
        "Holden: Good.",
        "Jack: Listen, why don't you take off. I'll let you know how it goes.",
        "Holden: No, I'm not leaving, Jack. If her own brother did this to her --",
        "Jack: Then I'll take care of it. Please.",
        "Holden: Jack, I got to see him. I got to know.",
        "Jack: Grab us some coffee?",

        "Carly: Hey, g-man.",
        "Jack: How's it going?",
        "Carly: J.J.'s in the kitchen. He's picking out his breakfast. He's awfully quiet since he got back from his friend's.",
        "Jack: Is he complaining about his leg at all?",
        "Carly: No. No, that seems to be okay.",
        "Jack: Listen, I'm sorry I had to take off after I dropped him off like that. But I'll be home as soon as I can.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, I will keep the TVs off and try to keep him distracted until you get back.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Carly: You have any idea when that will be?",
        "Jack: An hour maybe, I don't know. How do I do it, Carly? How do I tell that little boy that his mother's dead?",
        "Carly: I'm so sorry.",
        "Jack: Thanks for taking care of him.",
        "Carly: I wish there was more I could do.",
        "Jack: You're there for me, for J.J. that means more to me than anything. I love you, Carly.",
        "Carly: I love you, too.",
        "J.J.: Was that my mom on the phone? When is she coming to pick me up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So, is this what you're working on? What are these?",
        "Craig: It's a media event we're planning for next month. They're nice, aren't they?",
        "Barbara: Must be your choices. They're atrocious. So, why don't you tell me what you two were arguing about?",
        "Jennifer: Actually, I was just leaving.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no, no. We were just deciding who was going to make the breakfast run to Java.",
        "Barbara: You know, something is going on here. And I want to know I'm not going to be left in the dark. I'm still the head of B.R.O.",
        "Craig: Oh, we're all aware of that.",
        "Barbara: Good. Then you'll also want to know that I want to know what's going on. Despite Worldwide's interests in Jennifer's designs, you still both answer to me at the end of the day.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey. If you go, if you quit, she wins. All right? If you stay, if you help me -- I'll get her out of here, I'll get her across an ocean by dinner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #1: Who are you?",
        "Luke: I'm -- I was just -- passing by -- did anything happen here?",
        "Cop #1: It doesn't concern you. Keep moving.",
        "Cop #2: Everything we could get is bagged. CSI is doing its thing. Should I call somebody?",
        "Cop #1: Check in with Detective Snyder. He's on homicide for this one.",
        "Jack: Thanks, Griggs.",
        "Griggs: Sure.",
        "Keith: Is there a problem with Julia and J.J.?",
        "Jack: You know what? Why don't you wait in here? I'll be with you in a second. You are really pushing it, you know that?",
        "Holden: I want to be in there. I want to hear what he has to say.",
        "Jack: You can't. Either you stay out here, or I'll have one of my guys take you home. Your choice. Have a seat.",
        "Keith: Is Julia in some kind of trouble?",
        "Jack: Please, sit down.",
        "Keith: Oh, come on. What's going on? What happened? What's going on with Julia and J.J.? What --",
        "Jack: There's no easy way to say this, Keith. Julia is dead.",
        "Keith: What? What are you saying to me, dead? Why would you say something like that to me?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry.",
        "Keith: What happened? What happened? Talk to me! What's going on here? Was she in a car accident? Is that what happened? What about J.J.? Was J.J. With her? Where's J.J.?",
        "Jack: J.J. is fine. J.J. was spending the night last night at a friend's house. I picked him up this morning. He's at my house. He doesn't know yet.",
        "Keith: Well, then -- let me see Julia. Where is she?",
        "Jack: You can't see Julia, not until the medical examiner is finished.",
        "Keith: Well, what happened?",
        "Jack: There's no official cause of death.",
        "Keith: I don't care about official! What happened?",
        "Jack: She seems to have died from a blow to the head.",
        "Keith: A blow to the head? Who did that? How did this happen?",
        "Jack: Holden found her on her apartment the floor -- as if she'd fallen.",
        "Keith: And J.J. was at a friend's house? How am I gonna break that to that kid?",
        "Jack: I'll make sure he finds out as gently as possible. In the meantime, there are still some things we need cleared up. So, maybe you could help us out with those. If you're up for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'll tell you what, J.J.. why don't you go back into the kitchen and finish your cereal?",
        "J.J.: I don't like it. My mom doesn't buy that kind.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, I could make you some pancakes. You like pancakes, don't you?",
        "J.J.: Can Jack come back and have pancakes with me?",
        "Carly: Um -- well, he's at work now. Maybe he can come back for lunch.",
        "J.J.: Why are you letting me skip school? Does my mom know? She may not like it.",
        "Carly: It'll be okay. Trust me.",
        "J.J.: I want to call my mom.",
        "Carly: No, no -- sweetheart, she's not home.",
        "J.J.: Where is she? Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You know, I like to get to know my kids' friends, and you and I, we haven't gotten much of a chance to chat, so you mind answering a few questions?",
        "Casey: Mom, stop sounding like a cop.",
        "Celia: She doesn't. You sound just like my mother. What would you like to know?",
        "Margo: So you're excited about going to Oakdale Latin?",
        "Celia: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Celia: Because if I get in, I'll have friends there -- Casey and Will.",
        "Margo: It's a really good school.",
        "Celia: That's nice. But I probably won't be there too long. I have to think about my career.",
        "Margo: Your career?",
        "Celia: I'm going to be a singer.",
        "Will: Oh, there it is.",
        "Casey: But Celia's got a lot of other interests. I mean, don't you?",
        "Celia: I guess.",
        "Will: Aaron wanted us to get that stuff out of here really quick.",
        "Casey: Yeah. And, you know, mom, actually, we've got to get going. So think you guys could talk another time?",
        "Margo: Sure. Yeah. Would you join us for lunch?",
        "Casey: Whoa, this is a little last-minute. I mean, we should plan it out.",
        "Margo: Well, it's not like you have a job or anything to do today, huh? Celia?",
        "Celia: Sure. I'd love to see your room.",
        "Margo: Ooh.",
        "Will: That's because he was telling her about all of his sound equipment for recording. You know, she's a singer.",
        "Celia: I can't wait to record my own songs. Casey's promised to help me.",
        "Margo: Well, isn't that lovely? Why don't you hurry home, honey? 'Cause the sooner you're back, the sooner we get to chat.",
        "Celia: Your mom is great.",
        "Margo: Hey, Ali.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Celia: Oh, there's Alison. Maybe I can borrow some makeup so I can look nice at lunch.",
        "Casey: You're coming too, right?",
        "Will: No. If I want family drama, I'll phone home. I'll pass.",
        "Celia: Alison, can I ask you something?",
        "Alison: No, you cannot borrow my lipstick.",
        "Celia: What's the story with Will?",
        "Alison: Why do you ask?",
        "Celia: Last night, when he was driving me home, he was acting so weird.",
        "Alison: What did he say?",
        "Celia: He was saying that I would hear things about him, and that I wouldn't like him anymore. So what's the deal?",
        "Alison: Will's an awesome guy. He's, like, one of my best friends.",
        "Celia: And?",
        "Alison: And he's gone through a lot.",
        "Celia: Like what? Come on, Alison, you can tell me. I mean, how bad could it be? It's not like he killed somebody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What do you mean he won't come to the phone? Well, tell Etienne we don't have time for artistic temperament. We need those shipments now! Hello?",
        "Jennifer: I told you. I told you. We don't have a choice. Now I have to go to Paris.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. This requires a strong hand. Besides, you're needed here. I've just got to find some way to get this situation under control.",
        "Barbara: What situation? Okay, it's time. Tell me what's going on.",
        "Craig: Well, Jennifer uses a lot of distressed fabric in her jeans, and one of B.R.O.'s old contacts in Paris has developed a new technique. He promised to send samples, but they're not here yet.",
        "Barbara: This is Etienne we're talking about, right? He's notorious.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I pushed him, and he got into a snit and --",
        "Barbara: Well, then what you have to do now --",
        "Craig: No, no, there's only one thing to do. I've got to fly to Paris, deal with Etienne mano a mano.",
        "Barbara: And say what?",
        "Craig: Oh, it's simple. I'll figure it out.",
        "Barbara: It's not simple.",
        "Craig: No, piece of cake. Don't worry.",
        "Jennifer: Thanks.",
        "Craig: Ah. Ah, Jennifer. Brilliant, but green.",
        "Barbara: Yes, she is. And when it comes to the rag trade, so are you.",
        "Craig: Meaning?",
        "Barbara: Meaning if you go charging off to Paris to try to settle this mano a mano, you'd better know what the hell you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: When was the last time you saw Julia?",
        "Keith: Here at the police station.",
        "Jack: Did you speak with her after that?",
        "Keith: No. I went back to Chicago.",
        "Jack: Really? You went home?",
        "Keith: Yeah. Why? Do you think that's weird?",
        "Jack: I just find it interesting, that's all. You seemed pretty adamant about keeping J.J. in your life.",
        "Keith: Well, I didn't move back to Chicago. I had to take care of some business, and I'm back here now. I'm here. Are we done?",
        "Jack: Almost.",
        "Keith: 'Cause, you know, I need to look after J.J. I mean, I'm all he's got right now, and I've got to make plans to, you know, take care of him and everything.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Keith: Well, that scum that he used to call his father -- if he gets out of jail and tries to get custody, and I hope that you would help me there, because I don't think Les Sweeney should ever go near J.J. again.",
        "Jack: I'll look after J.J.",
        "Keith: Well, thank you, I appreciate that.",
        "Jack: He means a lot to you, doesn't he?",
        "Keith: He's my nephew.",
        "Jack: And Julia was gonna keep you from seeing him, right?",
        "Keith: Aw, she didn't mean that.",
        "Jack: When did you decide that? I mean, from what I saw, you were taking her pretty seriously. So much so that when she told you you couldn't see J.J. anymore, you were so angry you threatened her.",
        "[Keith remembering]",
        "Julia: J.J.'s in your life at my discretion.",
        "Keith: You're not threatening me.",
        "Julia: No, I'm not threatening you. It's a promise, Keith. You back off, or you won't ever see your nephew again.",
        "Keith: You push me out of your life, I'm telling you right now, you will regret it. I will make you sorry about that.",
        "Jack: You seemed pretty angry, Keith.",
        "Keith: Well, I got over it. What are you doing?",
        "Jack: I'm just asking questions.",
        "Keith: Well, do you think I had something to do with killing Julia? You said that she fell.",
        "Jack: No, I said that's what it looks like.",
        "Keith: That you think somebody -- that you -- I'm done here.",
        "Jack: Sit down. I'm not done with you. Sit down!",
        "Keith: I'm not sitting down! If you think I killed my sister, you're insane.",
        "Jack: Where were you yesterday? Answer the question. Where were you yesterday?",
        "Keith: I don't know, okay? I can't think straight. I -- I just -- I just keep seeing my sister when she was a little kid. When she was born, my father put her in my arms and said, \"You're a big brother now. You need to take care of your sister.\" And I tried. It wasn't always easy, but I loved my sister. And if you think that I killed my baby sister, you are nuts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: J.J., why don't you go back in the kitchen and then have something more to eat? I can still make you those pancakes.",
        "J.J.: I like my mom's pancakes.",
        "Carly: I bet they're terrific. Then go on. Get back in there and have something to eat. There's some fruit on the table. Would you -- would you like some help?",
        "J.J.: No. Why are you being so nice to me?",
        "Carly: Because you're a great kid.",
        "Lily: Poor little boy. He doesn't know yet, does he?",
        "Carly: No. After I got Parker and Sage up, I was running around this place like a crazy person, shutting off their radios and televisions so he wouldn't hear about Julia on the news.",
        "Lily: It's not on the news, because I checked every radio station in my car on the way over here. I just thought once they found her, they would --",
        "Carly: Maybe they're keeping it quiet.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Carly: Lily, they're -- they're treating Julia's death as a homicide.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Carly: They're starting an investigation.",
        "Lily: What? Then it's only a matter of time before they realize what I did.",
        "Carly: No. No, it isn't. Not if we're consistent. If you and I tell exactly the same story, just like we planned, no one ever has to know a thing.",
        "Lily: They're gonna figure it out.",
        "Carly: Will you -- keep it down. We got rid of your fingerprints. No one even knows that you were at Julia's. If we just keep our mouths shut --",
        "Lily: No, no, we have to do the opposite. We have to call the police. We tell the police -- we have to tell them everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We can't go to the police now. It's too late.",
        "Lily: They think that Julia was murdered. I thought that they would realize it was -- you know, this is crazy. This is -- everything has changed. I cannot keep this secret for the rest of my life.",
        "Carly: We covered up evidence, Lily. That's a felony. And how are we gonna explain why we did that?",
        "Lily: It was an accident. I pushed her. She fell. I could tell that to Jack and --",
        "Carly: And then Jack will ask why we cleaned up, why we wiped down Julia's apartment so there wouldn't be any fingerprints.",
        "Lily: I was thinking of Luke. I didn't want them to find out that he had trashed Julia's -- oh, my God, if they talk to Luke -- I've got to stop this. I've got to stop this.",
        "Carly: No one will believe it was an accident. She had a restraining order against you.",
        "Lily: Carly -- come on. You know that this is wrong.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I knew that when you begged me not to tell Jack. I knew that when we were wiping down her apartment. I was trying to help you.",
        "Lily: Help me now. Please make this stop.",
        "Carly: I can't do that. I'm your alibi, Lily. And you are mine.",
        "Lily: So you're looking out for yourself.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I am. I have children to raise, too. And just because I tried to help you --",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I talked you into this.",
        "Carly: You can make it up to me now by listening to me. Julia is dead. We can't change that. And if you just say nothing, then her death will become another cold case, never solved. But if you tell the police what you did, you will destroy your life and mine. Your family and mine. Please, Lily. You can save us all if you just do nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Are you asking me if I have an alibi?",
        "Jack: That's exactly what I'm asking you, Keith.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? You're out of line, 'cause I came in here voluntarily.",

Why don't you try looking at the two people that stalked her, that bothered her, that set her up that physically attacked her? You want to know who killed Julia? Look at your two wives.
