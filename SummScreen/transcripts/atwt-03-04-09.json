        "A distraught Katie learns that her eggs aren't viable and believes the surrogacy option might be out the window unless Brad agrees to go the anonymous egg donor road and then still let Vienna carry their baby. Brad is unsure at first and believes adoption is the better avenue, but Katie is able to convince him soon. Henry is unhappy to see Vienna, who is playing around, pretending to be pregnant with a beach ball. Vienna gets amorous with Henry, but he still isn't comfortable with her getting pregnant. Brad and Katie come to see Henry and Vienna with this new proposal, but Vienna adds a twist when she suggests that she donate her eggs to Brad and Katie as well as carries their baby. No one is on board at first, especially Henry, who stomps out of the room declaring he will not let her get pregnant with another man's child. Later, Katie jumps quickly on board after a little prodding by Vienna, as Brad hopes they all don't live to regret this. Jack surprises Janet with his plan to build their new home on a plot near the Farm and Pond. Carly is hung over when Craig shows up to tell her that they have a meeting in Chicago about their business. Carly and Craig go to Chicago and are thrilled with the results of their meeting. Craig, who has been sampling the merchandise, claims he can't drive, so he finally convinces Carly to get two hotel rooms to crash before they head back. They wind up in one room and soon their fun and laughter turns physical, as they sleep together. Carly has immediate regret, but Craig doesn't, even as Carly demands they head home. Janet and Jack are thrilled to be looking forward to starting the next chapter of their lives, as they \u0091christen' the space. Parker finds out that Carly is going out of town for the day and tells Liberty that they should skip school to hang out. While at home, Parker and Liberty become preoccupied in the throes of passion and a fire almost starts. Jack is called to Carly's house and he and Janet are furious to see the state of undress that Parker and Liberty are in. Jack and Janet have it out with Parker and Liberty, as Craig and Carly come home. Carly learns of what happened after Jack implies her business with Craig left her not aware of what her kids were up to again. Both Liberty and Parker are grounded separately from their Spring Break trips. Janet believes Parker is pressuring Liberty. Carly and Jack disagree over how to handle Parker; Jack wants to keep Parker and Liberty apart by sending Parker to boarding school. Carly disagrees, as Craig pipes in that Jack shouldn't punish Parker for being normal. Parker overhears their conversation. Craig comfort Carly. Later, Jack and Janet fight over how she thinks Parker should be dealt with, as a furious Jack tells her that she wins because he is sending Parker away. Parker tells Liberty that they should still go to Ft. Lauderdale."

        "Janet: Well, that's understandable.",
        "Liberty: No, I know. I'm not saying anything, I mean -- I like staying with them. But, I just wish you guys like had your own place, 'cause I miss you. I want to do that bounce back around thing.",

        "Janet: You do?",
        "Jack: Yeah. And I have plans to spend it with a beautiful lady.",
        "Janet: Who is she? I'll beat her up.",

        "Jack: Well, hey, it's a good thing. It's a surprise.",
        "Janet: Aw, Sweetie, you know how much I'd love to spend the day with you. But with the economy the way it is, my tips are dwindling.",
        "Jack: You look fine to me.",
        "Janet: Stop it, stop it. And I cannot just afford to take off work whenever I want to. You know I got to put money towards the house fund.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you got a point.",
        "Janet: Yeah. I like living with Emma, I really do. But I don't want to live there forever.",
        "Jack: Neither do I.",
        "Janet: So, that's why I have to work.",
        "Jack: So, that's why you gotta come with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You really like them?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm, I do.",

        "Craig: Where do you think you're going?",
        "Carly: I'm going upstairs. I'm going to go to sleep.",
        "Craig: No. Nope, we're going up to Chicago so we can show these to Siegler.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to Chicago.",
        "Craig: Carly, if the man's going to be our distributor, he has to be able to approve the branding concept, which means the label.",
        "Carly: Okay, well go. Do. Sell.",
        "Craig: Well, what if he wants to make changes?",
        "Carly: Take notes.",
        "Craig: Carly, you need to be there.",
        "Carly: Why? Why do you need me there?",
        "Craig: Because I only have one brilliant, creative, partner/designer and you're it. So, come on, let's get moving.",
        "Carly: What is that?",
        "Craig: This is so Siegler can taste what he's selling.",
        "Carly: It doesn't have a label.",
        "Craig: I know, I know. I'll make one while you get dressed. Now, go on.",
        "Carly: Maybe I should do that, you know? You're -- I'm sorry Craig, but it's the truth, you're artistically challenged.",
        "Craig: Thank you very much. Go get beautiful. You have five minutes. Go on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: What took you so long?",
        "Liberty: Sorry, I couldn't find that dumb book I need for my American history paper. I completely forgot about it till my mom reminded me.",
        "Parker: When's it due?",
        "Liberty: Fifth period. But, I'll do it during lunch. Hey, you shouldn't have waited for me. You're going to be late, too.",
        "Parker: So we'll run.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Parker: Yes, Mom, I'm almost at school.",
        "Carly: Well, that's good. Listen, I just wanted to let you know that I have to go to Chicago today for a meeting.",
        "Parker: All day?",
        "Carly: Yeah, pretty much. I don't' think I'll be back by the time you get home from school.",
        "Parker: You want me to watch Sage?",
        "Carly: No, no, that's okay. She's actually going over to Marcia's after school. And I will be back in time for supper.",
        "Parker: Okay. Have a good trip.",
        "Liberty: You'll have to work on the walking and talking thing. Because, if I'm late for home room, Mr. G. will pulverize me.",
        "Parker: Okay, didn't you hear? There's no school today.",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Parker: Yeah, we're doing home study.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: That looks fantastic.",
        "Craig: So do you. For someone who didn't get much sleep, that is. Let's go.",
        "Carly: Hey. You really think he'll say yes?",
        "Craig: Are you ready to be rich and famous?",
        "Carly: I'm ready to finally get something right.",
        "Craig: Today's the day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: We're never going to have a baby.",
        "Brad: Says who?",
        "Katie: The fertility specialist. He says that I'm not a good candidate for in vitro because my eggs aren't viable.",
        "Brad: So we'll make them viable. We'll pump them up, we'll fill them out, we'll whip them into shape. Next thing you know, you won't have viable eggs, you'll have -- you'll have super eggs.",
        "Katie: You can't make my eggs better. And they won't even attempt it if there's not a reasonable chance of success.",
        "Brad: Why did they get to decide what's reasonable? I mean, what about what we want?",
        "Katie: I have to take fertility treatments. And considering how I reacted to those last time --",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, that changes everything. No more treatments. Not when I almost lost you last time.",
        "Katie: I just want to have your baby. That's all I want in this world is to have your baby.",
        "Brad: It'll happen. We're just going to have to go back to plan B.",
        "Katie: Adoption?",
        "Brad: Yeah, if that's the only way we can have a baby, then that's exactly what we're going to do.",
        "Katie: The thing is, there is another way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: It's just a beach ball. I was practicing. Doesn't it look cute?",
        "Henry: Not so much.",
        "Vienna: Well, Henry, you going to have to -- have to get used to that.",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Vienna: Why? Because this is how I'm going to look when I'm carrying Katie's baby.",
        "[Henry whines]",
        "Vienna: Come on, look at me. No, no, up here. I'm still your same Vienna.",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, you are right now. But when you have the baby on board, everything's going to be a lot different.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you think so? Huh, how about this? You think this will change? Or this? What's wrong?",
        "Henry: I feel like there's a beach ball between us.",
        "Vienna: And you're going to let that stop you? For nine, long, lonely months? Hmm?",
        "Henry: Turn around.",
        "Vienna: For what?",
        "Henry: How does this feel? Hmm?",
        "Vienna: Oh, wonderful.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Oh, yeah.",
        "Henry: Yeah. You want to feel more wonderful?",
        "Vienna: Yes.",
        "Henry: Drop the ball.",
        "Vienna: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How do you like it? The place is great, right? The smell of pine trees, fresh air.",
        "Janet: Well it's fresh all right. It's also a little bit chilly. Honey, I don't think this hike in the woods was worth me missing work for.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, it's not just any woods. Darling, it's our woods.",
        "Janet: What? It's not enough that the Snyder's own all that farm land, they got to own the woods, too?",
        "Jack: As of now, the only Snyder's up here are going to be you and me, Kid.",
        "Janet: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: I had a little talk with Emma about the fact that we couldn't find a house that we like, at a price we could afford. You know what she said?",
        "Janet: She's kicking us out and we're going to have to learn to eat off twigs and berries?",
        "Jack: She said we could pick a plot from her back acres and build on it. And I always loved this piece of land. Not too far from the road, yet it's quiet. And the pond is just over that rise.",
        "Janet: This is ours?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Take a look around, Honey. Everything in the immediate vicinity belongs to us.",
        "Janet: And we can -- we can build anything we want?",
        "Jack: Yeah, of course, I'm going to have to do a lot of the building myself.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's okay, I'll help. I'll help. I can do stuff.",
        "Jack: But Brad, he's a really -- he's a really good carpenter.",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Jack: So -- welcome home, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "[Janet squeals]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Thank you. Hey, I love this! We're ditching school, have the whole place to ourselves.",
        "Parker: You hungry?",
        "Liberty: Not right now.",
        "Parker: All right. Then, I'm going to go put the pizza in the oven, keep it warm.",
        "Liberty: Okay. So, what are we going to do now?",
        "Parker: Well, we could go up to my room.",
        "Liberty: Why? We have the whole house to ourselves. We can do whatever we want. Come on. Hey, um, so I talked to my dad about spring break in Ft. Lauderdale.",
        "Parker: And what he say?",
        "Liberty: Well, he's cool with it as long as it's all girls and there's an adult chaperone.",
        "Parker: So you're covered.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. And you're still going down with Ty and his family, right?",
        "Parker: Yep. So, we'll be there at the same time.",
        "Liberty: Good.",
        "Parker: And then maybe we can get some time alone.",
        "Liberty: Maybe.",
        "Parker: Well, just in case we can't, we might as well make the most of today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, I didn't expect that to go so fast.",
        "Craig: I told you the label was inspiring.",
        "Carly: Yeah, Siegler did seem to like it. Who knew?",
        "Craig: I did. And one of these days you're going to learn just how talented you really are.",
        "Carly: So, uh, working with Siegler, it that sort of like one-stop shopping, right?",
        "Craig: He's the distributor, and he'll deal with us directly. Which means, we can skip the middleman altogether.",
        "Carly: Nice. Like that creepy Stan guy?",
        "Craig: Exactly. He's small potatoes anyway.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you know, Siegler does seem to have some global contacts, right?",
        "Craig: Oh, they'll be sipping our vodka all over the world, baby.",
        "Carly: Excellent. So, why are we standing here freezing when we should be heading home?",
        "Craig: Uh, I don't suppose you'd want to get a bite to eat first?",
        "Carly: No, no. You know what I want to do is go home, crawl into my bed, and take a nice, long nap.",
        "Craig: Well, there's a problem with that. I can't drive. We almost polished off that sample bottle with Siegler. That had to put me over the legal limit.",
        "Carly: Call a car service then.",
        "Craig: Well, what do you want me to do with my own car?",
        "Carly: I don't care. Craig, I have to go home.",
        "Craig: School doesn't get out for another few hours.",
        "Carly: What is it you suggest?",
        "Craig: I suggest we go to a hotel, sleep it off for a little while, and we'll hit the road later.",
        "Carly: You want me to go to a hotel? With you?",
        "Craig: We'll get separate rooms, Carly. And you can have the just reward of all your efforts. A nap.",
        "Carly: How do I know I'm going to regret this?",
        "Craig: So, you actually think I planned this?",
        "Carly: Chicago is a big town, Craig -- with lots of hotels.",
        "Craig: Yes, and most of those hotels turn over their clean rooms after 2:00. As it is, I had to bribe the desk clerk just to get this one. And that's only because I promised him we'd be gone by 5:00.",
        "Carly: You didn't say that to him, did you? 'Cause now he thinks we're up here having sex!",
        "Craig: I asked him for two rooms, Carly. What he thinks is that he made $100 for not giving me what I want!",
        "Carly: All righty. Guess you're taking the bed. I'll take the chair.",
        "Craig: Don't be silly. There's plenty of room here.",
        "Carly: Just throw me one of those pillows, okay? Oh, for God's sake, Craig.",
        "Craig: Oh, don't be ridiculous. I'm tired. You're exhausted. We're just going to nap for a couple of hours. Either lie down, or I'm going to hog these pillows.",
        "Carly: You better not try anything.",
        "[Craig scoffs]",
        "Craig: God forbid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay, I want the kitchen sink to be right here. And I want a big window over it so that I can look out into the woods.",
        "Jack: Sun sets in this direction.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's perfect. Okay. And then I want the island to be right here. I want a sink in the island. I want a double oven. I want a double sided refrigerator, all stainless steel of course. I need a dishwasher --",
        "Jack: Should I be writing all this down?",
        "Janet: Don't worry, if you forget, I will remind you. Hey, what room do you want to design?",
        "Jack: Uh, the bedroom, of course.",
        "Janet: Ooh. Really?",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Janet: Where's it going to be?",
        "Jack: Well, I think it's going to be right about here.",
        "Janet: Hmm.",
        "Jack: Hmm.",
        "Janet: I love what you've done with the place.",
        "Jack: Do you?",
        "Janet: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: You know, I think it's missing something.",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Jack: Come here.",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey.",
        "Jack: Oh, here we go. Let's do this the right way.",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Jack: Oh, here we are. Now what master bedroom is complete without a husband and wife?",
        "Janet: Why didn't I think of that?",
        "Jack: You know, just for luck, I think maybe we should christen the place.",
        "Janet: Oh, it's a little cold.",
        "Jack: Yeah. It's about to get really hot.",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Getting an egg from an anonymous donor and fertilizing it with your sperm is the best way to go.",
        "Brad: Uh, it's just, you know, anonymous and fertilizing and artificial. I mean, it's just -- you make it sound like a science experiment. This is our baby. And if we adopt, then the kid is real and warm, and there from the get- go.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but if we use your sperm, then it's at least half genetically ours.",
        "Brad: Yeah. Well, half mine and, you know, half ours, and half some stranger carrying our kid.",
        "Katie: No, Vienna would carry the baby, that way we could be there for the whole pregnancy, and watch it grow.",
        "Brad: Okay, but if we're going to be having all these people involved in making our baby, then we might as well just adopt. One stranger, one baby. Done and done.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but do you think we'll be able to adopt?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Really? 'Cause I've been married a lot of times. And you've been accused of murder and assault.",
        "Brad: Well, those charges were dropped.",
        "Katie: So what? You think some woman who can pick any couple is going to pick us over some couple that's been married since the beginning and never had a traffic ticket?",
        "Brad: Look, she'll meet us, she's going to fall in love with us.",
        "Katie: But what if we never get that meeting? It could be years before we get that. And what if we do, when we have our baby, we bring it home and she changes her mind?",
        "Brad: Okay, that is worst case.",
        "Katie: But if we use your sperm and a donated egg, we wouldn't have to wait or pass inspection. We could have our baby before Christmas. Can you imagine? Please.",
        "Brad: Yeah. I mean, since you put it that way. Yes, I can.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brad: Really, really.",
        "Katie: No, really?",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, if Vienna's willing to do it then I guess -- it's fine.",
        "Katie: I love you. Okay, okay. Let's go talk to Vienna. Let's go talk to her right now.",
        "Brad: Okay, let's go talk to Vienna.",

        "Liberty: Oh, my God, sorry. I got something stuck in my throat.",
