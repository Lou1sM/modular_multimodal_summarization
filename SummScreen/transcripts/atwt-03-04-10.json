        "Jack continues to be torn between his obligation to his family and his love for Carly while Janet tells Dusty she can't be with him because she has to concentrate on doing what she must do to save Liberty's life. Carly talks to her doctor and finds out that the best chance of finding a perfect bone marrow match for Liberty is for Jack and Janet to do in vitro fertilization. Janet objects to the procedure because she doesn't want to have to dispose of the remaining embryos but once she and Jack talk about it, she tells him she might consider it if they give the embryo that remain to another couple that needs them. Jack and Janet still can't figure out what they should do but both agree that they must make a decision very soon."

        "Lucinda: Jack. Really, with all the pull that you have around here, can't you do something about this?",
        "Jack: Lucinda, good morning. It's a pleasure to see you so early.",
        "Lucinda: Don't give me a \"Good morning.\" We have given you proof that Damian is still alive. Now, if he is, then Holden cannot be accused of killing him, right? Right! Or am I not understanding the justice system.",
        "Jack: It's not that simple.",
        "Lucinda: What more do you want? Dr. Oliver said that the body pulled from the sea is not Damian's. Why aren't you raising hell about this?",
        "Holden: Lucinda, Jack is dealing with international authorities. He can't let me go until they're satisfied that Damian is alive.",
        "Lucinda: Well, have they tried smoking him out?",
        "Jack: [Laughs] Smoking him out from where?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I don't know, but he's not that smart! Come on! Find him!",
        "Jack: He's got unlimited funds and a shipping company. He could be anywhere in the world.",
        "Holden: Or right around the block.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no. You don't really think he's here in Oakdale? That would be suicide.",
        "Holden: I think he would do anything to be near Lily again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: [Sighs] You startled me.",
        "Molly: Didn't mean to.",
        "Lily: Usually the security guard lets me know when someone's here.",
        "Molly: What security guard?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: It's a diamond stud. I think I lost it maybe over there.",
        "Security Guard: I don't see anything.",
        "Faith: Uh, can you keep looking? I'm so dead if I lose that earring.",
        "Security Guard: Listen, I got to get back to my post. I'm sorry.",
        "Faith: Look, it's not just the earring. I was hoping maybe we could hang.",
        "Security Guard: How old are you?",
        "Faith: Old enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Carly: Fine. I wanted to see you -- to apologize.",
        "Jack: Really? About what?",
        "Carly: Well, I -- I didn't mean to make such a scene in Minneapolis.",
        "Jack: Oh, please. We were all keeping secrets from each other. It was bound to blow up in our faces.",
        "Carly: You know you don't have to give me a pass on this one. I'm aware I was out of line.",
        "Jack: Okay. You were.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Carly: It's just, knowing that Janet was sleeping with Dusty while we were trying so hard not to give in to what we felt for each other, it didn't seem fair, and I let it get the best of me, and I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: No. I'm just glad it's out in the open.",
        "Carly: So, I'm sort of wondering what we do next.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What are you doing here?",
        "Dusty: I'm worried about you.",
        "Janet: You shouldn't have come all the way out here.",
        "Dusty: I left six messages. What happened with Jack?",
        "Janet: This isn't a good time.",
        "Dusty: Is he here?",
        "Janet: No, he's not. I haven't seen him since last night.",
        "Dusty: What's that for?",
        "Janet: Clothes for Liberty.",
        "Dusty: You're going back to Minneapolis?",
        "Janet: Not right away. I'm gonna send these out to her.",
        "Dusty: Well, we'll take it to her ourselves.",
        "Janet: Dusty!",
        "Dusty: I want to help you.",
        "Janet: No! You don't get it. There is nothing more you can do for Liberty. It's up to me and Jack now.",
        "Dusty: You can't have a baby with him, Janet. You can't.",
        "Janet: You have to understand where I'm coming from on this. This is about my child. I am trying to save her life, nothing else.",
        "Dusty: It's not the answer to your problem.",
        "Janet: I don't know that, and that's not a risk that I can afford to take.",
        "Dusty: It's gonna end up bad for you, Janet.",
        "Janet: This isn't about me. Again, not about me.",
        "Dusty: Jack wants to be with Carly.",
        "Janet: I know, and he can be with her for the rest of his life, for all I care. I just need his baby to save mine.",
        "Dusty: What about us?",
        "Janet: There is no us, Dusty. There can't be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Just so glad that we can talk about our future now without --",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Carly: Oh. Clearly, I'm jumping ahead. What's wrong?",
        "Jack: It's not gonna be easy.",
        "Carly: What's not gonna be easy, Jack?",
        "Jack: Us. Our future.",
        "Carly: I thought you said you were happy that everything is out in the open.",
        "Jack: I am.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't understand then. Are you planning to stay with Janet?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: Okay. Then what's the problem?",
        "Jack: She still wants to have a baby. With me.",
        "Carly: Is she serious?",
        "Jack: Completely.",
        "Carly: Well, that's not gonna happen, and she's gonna have to accept it. Isn't she?",
        "Jack: I haven't agreed to anything yet.",
        "Carly: Well, and you're not going to agree with it! You're not gonna have a baby with her! Your marriage is over! You don't love her!",
        "Jack: Carly, could you stop -- stop for a second and put yourself in my shoes. What am I supposed to do?",
        "Carly: Walk away!",
        "Jack: How do I say no to her?",
        "Carly: You don't know how to say no? I'll tell you how to say no. You just say the word, \"No.\"",
        "Jack: I know you're upset.",
        "Carly: Yes, I'm upset! I'm surprised you're not!",
        "Jack: I am, but how am I supposed to walk away if there's any chance that having a baby with Janet could save Liberty's life? Carly, I'm responsible for my brother's death. It doesn't matter that it was a mistake. I've got to live with that mistake for the rest of my life, and I can barely do that, and if Liberty dies because of me, too -- if my own niece, my brother's daughter, dies because I didn't do everything I could to save her --",
        "Carly: Do you still want to be with me?",
        "Jack: With all my heart.",
        "Carly: When? How long do I have to wait?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm not gonna let you do this.",
        "Janet: Well, you don't get to weigh in on this. I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: There's something very real going on between us.",
        "Janet: Oh, don't you think I know that? But it doesn't matter. Liberty is all I care about, and I am not going to let her down.",
        "Dusty: I'm not asking you to.",
        "Janet: Yes, you are!",
        "Dusty: I'm asking you to think about what you need.",
        "Janet: What I need is a baby to help me save the one I would die for. That is what I need.",
        "Dusty: I don't believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Interesting.",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Lily: That you show up when my security guard isn't where he's supposed to be.",
        "Molly: Lily, seriously?",
        "Lily: Whatever. Why are you here?",
        "Molly: I came to see Faith.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Molly: She seemed anxious when I saw her, and I was concerned.",
        "Lily: When did you see her?",
        "Molly: On the street right after she left the station.",
        "Lily: Well, she's home now. She's fine. I can take care of my own daughter, thank you.",
        "Molly: Lily, there's no reason to be hostile. I'm only here because Holden can't be, and Faith's obviously upset over what's going on with him.",
        "Lily: I'm her mother. I can look out for her. She doesn't need you, Molly.",
        "Molly: I don't think Holden would agree with that.",
        "Lily: You're seriously gonna hold her hand to score points with her daddy?",
        "Molly: No. I was just wondering if she wanted to go see a movie.",
        "Lily: A movie?",
        "Molly: Yeah, a movie.",
        "Lily: Oh, I see. I play disciplinarian mom and you get to be fun daddy's girlfriend who wins.",
        "Molly: Oh, you have got to be kidding me.",
        "Lily: Look, I can't tell Holden who to date.",
        "Molly: We're more than dating.",
        "Lily: But I can tell you no when you try to impose yourself in my kids' lives.",
        "Molly: You might want to try a little more of that yourself.",
        "Lily: Excuse me?",
        "Molly: Look.",
        "Security Guard: I can't go for a walk with you, Faith.",
        "Faith: Sure, you can. Just say yes. I'll cover with my mom if she -- Mom!",
        "Lily: What's going on out here? Faith, I thought that you were upstairs taking an oral exam with your English teacher on the phone.",
        "Faith: I finished.",
        "Lily: What? You couldn't have been up there for more than ten minutes.",
        "Faith: It was really intense. I came out to get some air.",
        "Lily: Just so you know, this woman got past you without you seeing her. Where were you?",
        "Faith: My bad, Mom. I came out the front door and he heard me. So, he came to the driveway to see who it was. He was doing his job.",
        "Security Guard: I'm sorry, Ma'am.",
        "Molly: Hey. How'd that Chemistry exam go?",
        "Faith: It was English Lit.",
        "Molly: Really? Because I could have sworn you told me it was Chemistry.",
        "Faith: I'm gonna go get a soda.",
        "Molly: Hmm. You'd think a fancy-schmancy boarding school like Faith's would give her the exam online.",
        "Lily: I have no idea, Molly.",
        "Molly: An oral exam over the phone? What is this, 1967? Maybe you should ask her again if -- what are you doing?",
        "Lily: Will you escort this woman to her car, please?",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Lily: The last time she was here, she stole something.",
        "Molly: Are you really that threatened by me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: You think that Damian could still be here in Oakdale?",
        "Holden: I'm not so sure he ever left. Why else would he go to so much trouble to make sure that I'm in custody? Listen, if I'm in here, I cannot protect her and the kids from him.",
        "Lucinda: You're worried sick about her safety.",
        "Holden: She's the mother of my children.",
        "Lucinda: And you still love her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I really think you should go.",
        "Dusty: I don't believe having a baby with Jack is just about Liberty.",
        "Janet: Well, then, you don't know who I am.",
        "Dusty: Well, I know who Jack is.",
        "Janet: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Dusty: If you have a baby with him, does it end there? He's not gonna just walk away?",
        "Janet: I don't want to talk about this anymore, okay? Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause staying together in misery for the sake of a child --",
        "Janet: This is different!",
        "Dusty: 'Cause it's for Liberty.",
        "Janet: Yes!",
        "Dusty: Are you gonna be happy in your marriage?",
        "Janet: What are you not hearing? This is not about me! I am trying to keep my daughter alive!",
        "Dusty: I know. I'm asking you to think it through. That's all. Think it through.",
        "Janet: I have, okay? I've asked all the questions, and the only answer is this is what is going to work.",
        "Dusty: What if it doesn't?",
        "Janet: Then I'll take that chance.",
        "Dusty: Please don't.",
        "Janet: You need to go before I say something I'll regret.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, what are you planning to do, move in with me and visit Janet when she's ovulating?",
        "Jack: Oh, Carly.",
        "Carly: Do you think I'm kidding? Have you thought any of this through?",
        "Jack: Carly, you know it's you I want to be with.",
        "Carly: Then be with me. I want you to make love to me, not to her. You can't be with her and say that I'm the one you love, and no matter what the reason, I'm not gonna sign on for that, and I need you to hear me.",
        "Jack: I do. I hear you. Just let me do what you said and think this through. This is a lot to put together on a break from work.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Jack: Please, know that my heart is with you. Give my head a chance to catch up and figure out what to do.",
        "Carly: Oh, hello. This is Carly Tenney calling. I'm a patient of Dr. Schiller's. I'm just wondering if she's in today. Oh, good. Well, then, maybe it would be possible for me to just grab her for five minutes and talk to her. I have a few questions I want to ask about in vitro fertilization.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What are you doing?",
        "Dusty: I'm waiting for you. A nice officer told me to have a seat and wait.",
        "Jack: I'm busy.",
        "Dusty: I'll make it brief. Janet is so worried about Liberty that she can't think straight. So, be a man and do it for her.",
        "Jack: You want to run that by me again?",
        "Dusty: Tell her you can't do what she wants you to do.",
        "Jack: Okay. Two things. One, if you knew my wife, you'd know that a man telling her what to do is the shortest distance to the door. And, two, I don't take direction very well, Dusty, especially from you.",
        "Dusty: You know it's the right thing to do.",
        "Jack: I don't know anything of the kind.",
        "Dusty: You got to do it.",
        "Jack: I do?",
        "Dusty: For her, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why is that?",
        "Dusty: Because I want Janet and you don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: We don't have anything to talk about, Carly.",
        "Carly: I beg to differ.",
        "Janet: Well, if you're here to harass me about having a baby with Jack, don't. I've had all the arguments I can stomach for one day.",
        "Carly: You think you know why I'm here, but you're wrong.",
        "Janet: Okay, fine. Spill it and leave.",
        "Carly: I completely support the idea of you and Jack having a baby together.",
        "Janet: You do?",
        "Carly: I do. If I were in your shoes, I'd want to do the exact same thing. I don't like it, because it's Jack and it affects my life, but if I were you and this were happening to one of my kids, I wouldn't hesitate.",
        "Janet: I'm surprised to hear you say that.",
        "Carly: The thing is, conceiving the old-fashioned way, it's a problem for all of us, and it's really the least effective way to get a match for Liberty, which is what this is all about anyway.",
        "Janet: What are you talking about?",
        "Carly: The best way for you to get a match for Liberty would be to conceive through IVF.",
        "Janet: Are you serious?",
        "Carly: Completely.",
        "Janet: So, now you think that you can tell me how to have a baby?",
        "Carly: Well, if one of your options is to sleep with the man I love, you bet I can.",
        "Janet: This is between me and Jack. This is none of your business.",
        "Carly: This is not about you and Jack. This is about getting a donor for Liberty, or rather creating a donor for Liberty.",
        "Janet: So, IVF. What do you mean that it could be less of a risk in terms of finding a match for Liberty?",
        "Carly: If you use IVF, they can create like five or six embryos at a time.",
        "Janet: So?",
        "Carly: The doctor can test them before any of them are implanted, and you'd know if you found a perfect genetic match for your daughter.",
        "Janet: Five or six?",
        "Carly: That's standard, yeah.",
        "Janet: How do you know?",
        "Carly: I asked my doctor.",
        "Janet: Oh, you did.",
        "Carly: Hey, Janet, I have just as much at stake her as anybody else.",
        "Janet: I can't believe you!",
        "Carly: Well, I can't believe that you could be having sex with Jack for months without conceiving!",
        "Janet: I can't believe I'm even having this conversation right now!",
        "Carly: Look, Janet, you have to admit it. This IVF, it solves our problems.",
        "Janet: Okay. I can see how it could, yes. But what about the embryos we don't use? What happens to them?",
        "Carly: I guess they get rid of them.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no, no! I can't do that.",
        "Carly: Wait a minute. You're not gonna get political on me now, are you?",
        "Janet: I'm not getting political, Carly. It's what I believe in.",
        "Carly: What you believe! I'm so sorry! Where was this belief system when you slept with Dusty?",
        "Janet: Oh, how dare you!",
        "Carly: And where was it when you decided it was okay to sleep with a man you don't love anymore, knowing that he loves somebody else, to create a baby you know he doesn't want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: This isn't about what any of us want, Dusty, and you know that.",
        "Dusty: There are other ways to help Liberty besides having a baby, Jack.",
        "Jack: Really? And, what, we're just ignoring these other ways?",
        "Dusty: I think bringing a baby into the situation's a bad move.",
        "Jack: You know, Dr. Dusty, you're just a guy that sleeps with other guys' wives.",
        "Dusty: Janet wouldn't be with me if you hadn't walked away from her.",
        "Jack: I think we're getting off point here. This is about Liberty getting better, nothing else.",
        "Dusty: Having a baby with Janet doesn't guarantee Liberty a thing. What if the baby's not a match? You gonna have another? And another?",
        "Jack: O'Reilly, cover me. I'm punching out early.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Molly left?",
        "Lily: Yes. [Sighs] Faith, is everything okay at school?",
        "Faith: Yeah, great. Why?",
        "Lily: Well, I just thought it must be hard to come home, you know, just when you're settling in there and getting used to everything.",
        "Faith: It's fine.",
        "Lily: And the situation with your dad must be upsetting.",
        "Faith: Is there something you want to talk about, Mom?",
        "Lily: That was my next question.",
        "Faith: Oh. Well, I wasn't sure how to say this.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, you can talk to me about anything. You know that.",
        "Faith: I think I should leave boarding school.",
        "Lily: What? Why? Did something happen there?",
        "Faith: No. It's what's happening here.",
        "Lily: Oh, Baby. I know this is hard, but leaving school when you're thriving there -- and your dad would be so upset if he knew that you were gonna leave on his account.",
        "Faith: It just feels weird being so far away when the family is coming apart.",
        "Lily: Is that what you think?",
        "Faith: Uh, yeah. They're saying Dad killed your husband. I mean, that's not exactly normal, is it?",
        "Lily: I don't want you to leave school and end up regretting it later on.",
        "Faith: I just think I can help here more.",
        "Lily: Let's not make any big decisions right now, okay?",
        "Faith: Okay.",
        "Lily: I have to talk to your dad in a little bit, and I can tell him what you're thinking.",
        "Faith: Do you have to?",
        "Lily: What? Tell him that you're thinking about leaving boarding school?",
        "Faith: No, go see him again. I just thought that you could stay here with me.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, are you scared to be here by yourself?",
        "Faith: We just went there. I thought you'd be home, I guess.",
        "Lily: I just need to talk to your dad about a couple of things. Don't worry. You're okay here. You're safe. The guard is right outside, okay?",
        "Faith: Okay.",
        "Lily: Oh, Baby, I know this is hard, but we will get through this. I promise you.",

        "Holden: You know, Lucinda, I thought that once you were my ex-mother-in-law, that the hounding would stop.",
        "Lucinda: [Laughs] I should never be your ex anything, Darling. I'd like to blame Damian for everything, but, really, you've got to shoulder some of the blame.",
        "Holden: For what?",
        "Lucinda: For not telling Lily flat out at the beginning that you still loved her.",
        "Holden: She married Damian three seconds after I was declared dead, and you let her.",
        "Lucinda: What was I supposed to do? Was I supposed to knock her out? Was I supposed to cart her off to the next town where you couldn't find her?",
        "Holden: Did you try talking to her, convincing her that it was too soon, that it was just a reaction?",
        "Lucinda: That girl hasn't done one thing I told her to do since she was 15.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, you need to talk to her now. You need to convince her that she needs to take the kids and she needs to leave town.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, Sir! I will try.",
        "Lily: Mother, what are you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: Same thing you're doing here.",
        "Holden: You look upset.",
        "Lucinda: Are you all right?",
        "Holden: Is everything okay?",
        "Lily: It will be when you get your girlfriend off my back.",
        "Holden: What did Molly do now?",
        "Lily: She came over to my house and hassled me about Faith.",
        "Holden: How exactly did she hassle you?",
        "Lily: Does it matter? I want you to tell her to stay away from me and our children.",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Lily: I've got enough to deal with, Holden.",
        "Holden: Forget it. I'm sorry. I can't do that.",
        "Lily: Why not? Because if you don't do it, I will, and I promise you, it won't be as nice coming from me.",
        "Lucinda: It is so obvious what the problem is around here. The two of you are focusing on the wrong other people. You should be focusing on each other and how you're going to solve this.",
        "Lily: Mother, don't. Now is not the time.",
        "Lucinda: Now is absolutely the time.",
        "Lily: Molly has no business weighing in on how my children are getting on in the face of this.",
        "Lucinda: You're not upset about that. You're upset that Molly is still with Holden.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, please.",
        "Lily: I could care less about Holden and Molly's relationship.",
        "Lucinda: No. You would like to be helping Holden on your own, alone, rather than having to deal with this annoying woman.",
        "Lily: What I would like is for the situation not to exist at all, but it does, and you're not making it any easier. So, feel free to leave anytime you'd like.",
        "Lucinda: Fine. I'll leave you to sort this out without my interference.",
        "Lily: Ah, how refreshing.",
        "Lucinda: Take care, all right? I'll talk to you later.",
        "Lily: I'm serious, Holden.",
        "Holden: Do you want to tell me exactly what Molly did that has you so worked up?",
        "Lily: She told me that I don't know how to look after my own children.",
        "Holden: Molly said that?",
        "Lily: Do you think I'd make it up?",
        "Holden: Maybe you just read in to something because she's Molly and because you just can't stand being in the same zip code as her.",
        "Lily: [Laughs] I can handle the same zip code. I just don't want her in my house.",
        "Holden: I asked her to go over there.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry?",
        "Holden: Lily, Faith is a teenager, and you know how teenagers can be with their mothers, and I just thought that maybe Molly could talk to her, get her to open up about things in a way that --",
        "Lily: That I can't?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Look, sometimes you guys don't speak the same language, and that's a normal thing.",
        "Lily: You think I can't relate to my own daughter?",
        "Holden: No. I did not say that.",
        "Lily: Then what exactly did you say?",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hi.",
        "Faith: Are you stalking me?",
        "Molly: No, not at all. I just came for a cup of coffee.",
        "Faith: Well, go on and get one.",
        "Molly: Can I sit with you?",
        "Faith: Can I stop you?",
        "Molly: Boy, this is familiar.",
        "Faith: What is?",
        "Molly: You, the way you're behaving.",
        "Faith: Are you gonna lecture me about it? I have a mother for that.",
        "Molly: No. No, I'm not gonna lecture you, because I'm the last person that should lecture anybody about anything. No. What I meant by familiar was you remind me a lot of me when I was your age.",
        "Faith: I hate when grown-ups say things like that.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. Of course you do. That probably sounded very condescending on your end, didn't it? Look, Faith, what I'm trying to say is, maybe I can relate to the stuff you're going through in a way that your mom and dad can't.",
        "Faith: You're saying I'm going through something?",
        "Molly: Come on, Honey. I'm just trying to be your friend.",
        "Faith: I have enough friends.",
        "Molly: Mm-hmm. And can they help you deal with whatever it is that's making you so edgy? I can. And I'm not your mom. So, whatever you tell me, I can't ground you for it and I don't have to share it with your dad either.",
        "Faith: What can you do?",
        "Molly: I can listen. And maybe I can help.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Molly: Faith.",
        "Faith: I'll call you if I need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You sent Molly over to my house to check up on Faith because you didn't trust that I could do it myself?",
        "Holden: Why are you making this into something it's not?",
        "Lily: What possible reason --",
        "Holden: Lily, look. I did it because Faith is a kid. She's been living away from home. Her father was just arrested for murder, and I thought that maybe an adult, someone besides you and me, might be able to help her out!",
        "Lily: She's got Luke! She's got my mother, your mother, to talk to! Don't insult me by trying to justify this as anything other than a power play.",
        "Holden: Aside from the obvious, why do you hate Molly so much?",
        "Lily: Well, how about the fact that in another colossal era in judgment, she sent me a fake ring and a forged document from Damian, which has done nothing but complicate your case even more.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. That was a mistake.",
        "Lily: A mistake? How can you possibly justify what she did?",
        "Holden: Because it was a misguided attempt on her part to try and help me out!",
        "Lily: Well, her help has landed you in police custody and a heartbeat away from an extradition on a murder charge!",
        "Holden: Wait a minute. Let's get one thing straight here. I'm not here because of Molly. I'm here because of Damian, and I know that this has been difficult for you, but let's not blame this on anyone except your husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I meant what I said. You got to step up and do the right thing.",
        "Jack: Here's the deal, Dusty. I get it. I get you. I know why you want Janet. You lost Jennifer and your son, and here you have a chance to get with someone who can give you back that family you lost, and she wants to have a baby with another man and you can't handle it, even though the reasons behind it are clear.",
        "Dusty: You still in love with her?",
        "Jack: That's not the point.",
        "Dusty: It is to me.",
        "Jack: Oh, it isn't to Janet. All she cares about is --",
        "Dusty: Saving Liberty.",
        "Jack: Exactly.",
        "Dusty: I know that, but you're preventing Janet from living the life that she wants.",
        "Jack: I haven't done anything yet, Dusty, and whatever I do decide, it's not gonna be swayed one way or another by whatever you're trying to pull here. I don't presume to know about the love you had for Jennifer. So, do me a favor and show me the same respect. Stay out of my business with Janet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: All right. So, your religious beliefs, they mean a lot to you. Fine. But let's be honest here. If you could use IVF and get a baby that could save Liberty's life, you would do it in a heartbeat, ask God's opinion later.",
        "Janet: You have no idea how hard this is for me.",
        "Jack: What's going on?",
        "Carly: I -- [Clears throat] I came to Janet with an idea.",
        "Jack: About what?",
        "Carly: About how to get Liberty a sibling that could potentially save her life while keeping the boundaries between the two of you perfectly clear.",
        "Janet: So, Carly's point about IVF is the doctors can choose an embryo that's a match before they implant it. However, we don't know what they do with the other embryos. That's why I'm not jumping up and down about this.",
        "Carly: It solves our problems. Jack.",
        "Jack: Carly, I asked you to give me some time so I could work this out in my head.",
        "Carly: It's a good solution.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but now Janet's upset.",
        "Carly: If -- if the two of you aren't gonna be together, it makes perfect sense. Hello? Why am I the only one talking?",
        "Jack: Listen to me. Just -- if you push her on this, then she's never gonna agree. So, just give us some time to talk about it, okay? Go home, and I'll call you later. I promise.",
        "Carly: Just do it, okay?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. Are you okay?",
        "Janet: I can't even see straight.",
        "Jack: Well, I had no idea that Carly was doing this. Really, I didn't. But is -- is this even a possibility for you? Would you consider IVF?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I just wish there was a way that we could smoke Damian out of hiding.",
        "Holden: You are your mother's daughter. She said the same thing.",
        "Lily: We could do it.",
        "Holden: If I knew how, I would. Believe me.",
        "Lily: We both know how.",
        "Holden: What are you talking about?",
        "Lily: We could send Damian a message that I know he's alive and that I want to see him.",
        "Holden: No. I do not want you using yourself as bait. You know what he did to my sister. You were there.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but it's me that he wants. All of this you being locked up and accused of murder, it's his way of getting to me.",
        "Holden: No. I'm not gonna let you do that, Lily.",
        "Lily: Listen, if we're careful and we do everything right --",
        "Holden: Absolutely not. I do not want you to go anywhere near him again. Are we clear? You'd better mean that.",
        "Lily: I do, I do. I'm sorry, okay? I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You let me down, Faith. I didn't get enough time at the house to talk to your mother.",
        "Faith: I'm sorry. I -- I just couldn't make it work with the guard and Molly.",
        "Damian: I need to speak to your mother, Faith!",
        "Faith: Then just call her.",
        "Damian: I told you, that's not possible. The phones are tapped. I can't take that risk. Faith, look at me. We're doing this to protect your mother from the people who are trying to harm me. The last thing I want is to be led straight to her while they're looking for me.",
        "Faith: How long is this gonna take?",
        "Damian: I don't know. I don't know. But I do agree that it's too dangerous at the house. You'll have to find a way to get your mother out of there and somewhere private so that we can talk.",
        "Faith: How?",
        "Damian: I'll let you know, and this time you'll do as I say.",
        "Faith: None of this feels right.",
        "Damian: What did we agree on, Faith? You'll help me or else I can't help you, and your trouble at school was pretty serious, huh? Faith?",
        "Faith: I don't care, okay? My parents love me. They'll forgive me.",
        "Damian: But the police won't. You had enough pot in your possession for them to think you were dealing. That's a little more serious than an adolescent indiscretion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hi. Office of the head mistress, please. I'll hold. Hello. Yes, I'm Molly Conlan. I'm Faith Snyder's aunt, and I'm calling on behalf of her parents. You see, Faith's been very anxious since she came home from school, and we're just wondering if something happened. Yes. There is a lot going on here, but it seems to be more than that, and we're just wondering if something happened at school to -- what incident? Why weren't her parents told about it? What? Her father was told about the entire thing? I'm sorry. Did you say when he picked her up from school? Because that's not possible. Hello? Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I haven't felt this way about anyone since I lost you. I want you to let me know if it's okay. If I'm doing the right thing. Can you let me know? 'Cause Janet's someone I want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: But if it was a choice between God or my child, yes, of course. But what about the other embryos? I couldn't just get rid of them. I couldn't do that. But if we gave them to another couple, that would be like adoption, right? It would be like adopting. That I could live with.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Janet: Hold on. It's Liberty. Hi, Sweetheart. How are you? I know, Baby. I know. I know. Listen, I've got a whole bunch of clothes, and I'm gonna send them out to you today. I promise, okay? You're so brave. I love you, Sweetheart. I'll talk to you soon. She's so scared.",

        "Carly: I know.",
        "Jack: And if I say no, then I'm basically saying no to Liberty. I'm saying no to saving her life and to the commitment I made to my brother to look after his kids.",
