        "Barbara: It's late. I took a chance that it's still your morning favorite.",
        "Craig: What time is it?",
        "Barbara: Oh, later than you think. Come on, now. Drink up. Drink up.",
        "Craig: What? Are we expecting visitors, dear?",
        "Barbara: Well, actually, yes. The Oakdale Police. I called to report a break- in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: Good morning, beautiful. You're already dressed? I was going to wake you up to my famous chorizo and jalapeno omelet.",
        "Jessica: I didn't sleep.",
        "Marshall: Really? Well, I -- I slept like a lamb.",
        "Jessica: So is this supposed to make up for what happened last night?",
        "Marshall: I'm sorry, am I missing something? Jess, what are you talking about?",
        "Jessica: How can you stand there and talk about omelets and breakfast like everything's okay?",
        "Marshall: Well, last night was a lot more than okay. It was hot. It was passionate. Like two other nights we shared together. It was wonderful. Wait a minute. What? What? What's wrong?",
        "Jessica: I've got to get out of here.",
        "Marshall: Wait, Jessica, wait.",
        "Jessica: No, Margo's waiting for me at the station. And for some reason, increasingly unfathomable to me, I'm still your lawyer.",
        "Marshall: Wait, obviously, this is very important. Come on, baby --",
        "Jessica: Don't you --! Don't you ever put your hands on me again.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Rapping on door]",
        "Jack: Molly.",
        "Molly: Hi. I was just wondering if you'd talked to Carly.",
        "Jack: You mean did I clear the field for you and Mike?",
        "Molly: More boxes. These on the way up or down this time?",
        "Jack: I will say this -- I went to the Lake house to let Carly know --",
        "Molly: Jack, look, I understand.",
        "Jack: It was Holden's stupid idea anyway. And I was dumb enough to bring a baby name book along with me.",
        "Molly: That's good.",
        "Jack: I couldn't go inside, Mol. I couldn't even knock on the door.",
        "Molly: Why not?",
        "Jack: It sounded as if Mike and Carly had everything under control.",
        "Molly: Are you saying that they --",
        "Jack: You know what? That's not what I meant. Okay, listen, I really don't want to talk about this anymore. Whatever they were doing, it didn't sound like I was needed, so I left.",
        "Molly: Just like that? You just left before telling Carly how much you care about her?",
        "Jack: I told you, it's not open for discussion, Mol. But to answer your question, I packed up all these boxes, they're on their way out.",
        "Molly: Without even talking to Carly?",
        "Jack: Carly and I have spoken plenty since then. And I finally decided, I'm ending this once and for all.",
        "Molly: Jack? What did you do?",
        "Jack: I filed for divorce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Divorce? Jack -- Jack filed for a divorce?",
        "Carly: Within 24 hours of telling me. It took him longer to trade in his old car. Just think about how badly he wants me out of his life.",
        "Mike: Is that why you didn't come home last night?",
        "Carly: I didn't really feel like talking about it. I don't feel much like talking about it now, either.",
        "Mike: Maybe he wasn't serious.",
        "Carly: No, I have seen this look in his eyes.",
        "Mike: He's trained to bluff, Carly. This could be just a ploy to win you back.",
        "Carly: Jack knows that all he would have to do is say the word and I would go running back to him in a flash. He doesn't need ploys. No. This -- I am out of chances. It's over. No, you see, this -- this is why I spent the night at Monte Carlo. This is exactly what I don't want.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Carly: I don't want you. I don't want St. Mike trying to make everything better by talking to Jack or telling me that everything is gonna be okay. Just please stop trying to rescue me.",
        "Mike: I'm not trying to interfere in anything that you and Jack need to work out for yourselves, all right? Maybe I'm not as much of a saint as you're making me out to be. I might have a little bit of selfish interest in this whole thing.",
        "Carly: Oh, really? What's your angle?",
        "Mike: Well, I want to know -- all right, now that Jack's asked for a divorce, what's gonna happen with our baby?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, Jess, come on in.",
        "Jessica: That's quite a stack.",
        "Margo: Yeah, wouldn't it be nice if people just did the right thing?",
        "Jessica: If only.",
        "Margo: Listen, I'm glad you're here, because the D.A.'s office finally set a court date for Travers' pretrial hearing.",
        "Jessica: Oh.",
        "Margo: I don't know, Jess. Obstruction of justice, Steinbeck's lackey. Anybody else but you representing him would find themselves over their head.",
        "Jessica: I'm gonna need more time, Margo. I'm gonna need a continuance. I'm not ready.",
        "Margo: Sure, yeah. How long?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- two weeks, maybe more. I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Margo: Sure, yeah. You're -- you're shaking. Why don't you sit down? Can I get you some water?",
        "Jessica: No, I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Margo: No, you're anything but fine. You look like you're being chased by a pack of wolves here.",
        "Jessica: It's just this case, you know? I'm kind of overwhelmed.",
        "Margo: Honey, did you get any sleep last night? Because forgive me for saying this, but you look absolutely bedraggled.",
        "Jessica: Something's happened.",
        "Margo: With Marshall?",
        "Jessica: It's all changed.",
        "Margo: Okay. All right. Just sit down. You just tell me what's going on.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jessica: Yes?",
        "Marshall: Jessica -- I've been sitting around here with my stomach in knots ever since you left. How can you drop a bomb like that on me and then just walk out?",
        "Jessica: I'm very busy right now. I have to talk about this later.",
        "Marshall: Jessica, I will not be put off. Now, either come home right now and talk this out with me, or I'll come down there and we'll have it out right in front of Margo.",
        "Jessica: No, don't. I'll -- I'll be there.",
        "Margo: That was Marshall?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I've got to go. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Look, look, you tell me what's going on before this thing snowballs, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: It's nothing. It's just a -- a little disagreement.",
        "Margo: No, this is far from \"a little disagreement.\" It's got you walking out of your job and not talking to your best friend.",
        "Jessica: I've really got to go.",
        "Margo: Jessica -- I'll be here when you want to talk.",
        "Jessica: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: What is going on now, Barbara? The station called and said you reported a break-in.",
        "Craig: You actually called? Good grief.",
        "Hal: Craig? Craig is your perpetrator?",
        "Barbara: He broke in last night and he refused to go away.",
        "Hal: Do you mind telling me how you managed to wind up here of all places, Montgomery? Wait, wait, wait a minute. Hold that thought. Hold that answer. You say he broke in last night, but you waited till this morning to call.",
        "Barbara: I didn't feel threatened last night, but now I do, so I want him arrested for invasion.",
        "Craig: Hal, I haven't done anything more than sleep on a sofa I thought was still mine.",
        "Barbara: You know, Hal, I'll go down to the station with you. I'll swear out a complaint.",
        "Craig: Are you gonna listen to this insanity?",
        "Barbara: First it was breaking and entering, or at least criminal trespass. But you know what? I think you've crossed into the area of resisting arrest. Don't you think so, Hal? Have the D.A. throw the book at him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Maybe I'm not connecting the dots here. You think that Jack filing for a divorce affects our arrangement?",
        "Mike: Sure it does, Carly. Because Jack has his way, you're not gonna be Mrs. Snyder anymore.",
        "Carly: Well, thanks for rubbing it in. But why are we just talking about Jack? Why aren't we talking about Molly?",
        "Mike: That's over. All right, Molly has made it abundantly clear she doesn't have any desire to resurrect our relationship. All right, so if you're not with Jack anymore and Molly's gone, then -- that kind of makes us free agents, right?",
        "Carly: Free to do what?",
        "Mike: Look, if there's nothing standing between us, all right, I want us to live together and be parents to this baby.",
        "Carly: If -- if Jack is the father of this child, he's not just gonna walk away.",
        "Mike: I know that. But he obviously doesn't plan on being around 24/7. I mean, that's what divorce means. And if we live together, this child can have two full-time parents.",
        "Carly: Even if this baby girl is Jack's?",
        "Mike: Yes. All right, Jack can be the weekend dad, the way it is with any other divorced couple. But let you and me give this baby a chance, you know, to -- to grow up in an environment of care and respect.",
        "Carly: Okay, what exactly does an environment of care and respect look like?",
        "Mike: Well, that depends.",
        "Carly: On what?",
        "Mike: On what your divorce means for you and me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Divorce?",
        "Jack: Yep.",
        "Molly: Jack, what the hell happened since last time I talked to you?",
        "Jack: I came to my senses, Molly.",
        "Molly: You guys have only been married for four months.",
        "Jack: Yeah, four months too long.",
        "Molly: You don't believe that.",
        "Jack: I got sick of always being in limbo. I couldn't decide. That gave Carly carte blanche to walk all over me. Move in with Mike, move in with me, bounce the baby between its two daddies. You said it yourself -- she always gets away with everything. Not this time, Molly.",
        "Molly: Jack --",
        "Jack: Not with me.",
        "Molly: You love Carly.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: You know, sometimes love just ain't enough.",
        "Molly: You guys have shared so much. This is crazy.",
        "Jack: For Pete's sake, Molly, she's moved in with some other guy who's probably the father of her child. When do I get to wake up here?",
        "Molly: About the baby?",
        "Jack: I will go to all the prenatal visits on the slim chance that this child is mine. But that's all.",
        "Molly: Jack, you're making a huge mistake.",
        "Jack: No, I've ended it. She's Mike's mistake now. And why don't you stop pretending that you're here because you're concerned about my marriage? If you want Mike so bad --",
        "Molly: You know what?",
        "Jack: -- Just go and get him.",
        "Molly: You couldn't be further from the truth, Jack.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Molly: Because I am completely done with Mike Kasnoff. Yeah, that's right. In fact, I'm playing the field these days.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: Trying to get Mike to believe that you and I hooked up doesn't exactly qualify as \"playing the field,\" Molly.",
        "Molly: You say that you've given up on Carly. Why is it so hard for you to believe that I would have done the same thing with Mike?",
        "Jack: Because you haven't had the history of pain and misery that Carly and I have.",
        "Molly: Okay, sorry, but once has been enough for me, big guy.",
        "Jack: Baloney! There's still hope for you, if for no other reason than you're still in love with the guy. So stop depending on me to do your dirty work for you.",
        "Molly: I have not depended on you, Jack. I haven't. I just thought -- okay, I don't know what I thought.",
        "Jack: I'll tell you what you thought. You thought you'd go over to Jack's, lay a little guilt trip on him, trying to get him to kowtow to Carly again.",
        "Molly: Where is this coming from, Jack? When have I ever used you that way, really?",
        "Jack: You were willing to fake a night of passion to make Mike jealous.",
        "Molly: You went along with it.",
        "Jack: Yes. I also went to the hospital to play daddy at Carly's sonogram because you pressed me. Come on. The reason you're here is to get me to take Carly back so you can have Mike to yourself again. Why can't you just admit to that?",
        "Molly: Jack, I never intended to lay a guilt trip on you, okay? I just thought between you and me, you have the most to lose.",
        "Jack: Well, I've got nothing.",
        "Molly: What about this baby that might be yours? This marriage that you've been wanting for so many years.",
        "Jack: No, the marriage -- the marriage is over. And it really wasn't all that worth waiting for. And as far as Carly's baby, if it's mine, I'll deal with it. But I cannot bring myself to live with that child's mother. So if you're so desperate to break up Carly and Mike's little family nest over there, you're gonna have to figure out a way to do it yourself. I'm done. It's over, Molly.",
        "Molly: You're gonna regret this, Jack.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: For crying out loud, Mike. Why should my divorce mean anything for you and me? We're just roommates.",
        "Mike: I guess what I'm looking for is a commitment.",
        "Carly: To the baby? That -- that's what we're talking about, right? The baby. We need to be clear about that.",
        "Mike: Yes. Yes. A partnership for our child. But it's got to be a mutual decision.",
        "Carly: Well, you think I'm gonna kick up my heels and move in with somebody else?",
        "Mike: No. No more than I'm about to give love another chance after what happened with Molly.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm not following you. And you're making me really nervous.",
        "Mike: You're making me nervous, too. I mean, what happens if Jack calls you in a month from now and says, \"you know, baby, I was wrong. Come back home.\"",
        "Carly: Well, then, I would walk right out that door. I've never made any bones about that, Mike, and you have said yourself that you -- that you want me and Jack to get back together.",
        "Mike: That was back when we both held out hope. I mean, things are different now. And I think that we need to make a different kind of commitment, to raise this baby together.",
        "Carly: What exactly do you want me to say?",
        "Mike: I guess what I'm looking for is a guarantee, all right? That if I stick around and I give my heart to this baby, that you are not gonna pull the rug out from under me down the road.",
        "Carly: Oh. In other words, you don't trust me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, Hal, maybe it was a mistake not to leave last night, but I was exhausted, all right? So I will leave now, if it's all the same to you.",
        "Barbara: Too late.",
        "Hal: A joke is a joke, Barbara. Hasn't this one gone on long enough?",
        "Barbara: No joke, Hal. Arrest him.",
        "Hal: Sorry, I am not dragging the D.A. into some twisted revenge plot against your ex.",
        "Barbara: He's trespassing.",
        "Hal: Or visiting. You figure it out.",
        "Barbara: Hal -- Hal -- [door closes] happy now?",
        "Craig: What, that Hal didn't call in the guys with nets for you? Sure. I wish you all the best, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Oh, come on, Craig. You and Hal both wish that the world would stomp me out. In fact, Hal would wear the heavy shoes and you could sell tickets from the sidelines. What? What? What are you looking at? Would you just go, please? Go terrorize someone else. Just get the hell out of here.",
        "Craig: So Will's out of the hospital, huh?",
        "Barbara: Yeah. Yeah, he is.",
        "Craig: Good.",
        "Barbara: They dropped the charges and released him.",
        "Craig: Good. I like the kid. Where is he now?",
        "Barbara: Home. I mean, Hal and Emily's. I get him on the weekends. I thought it was best, considering the circumstances.",
        "Craig: Yeah. That's something. Maybe you and he can get back to whatever passes for normal for you these days.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Craig: I know what it's like to lose a child. That latte's awful. Talk to Claude. Kitchen.",
        "Barbara: Craig. Craig, don't go. I'd like to talk to you. I have a confession to make.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: I'm glad you came back. Before you ran out, you said some really heavy things that I -- I just do not understand.",
        "Jessica: What part about last night don't you get?",
        "Marshall: From where I stand, we both participated in a wild and passionate evening.",
        "Jessica: No. I said no, and you forced yourself on me.",
        "Marshall: Wait -- forced myself? Okay, I don't know where all this hostility's coming from, but I sure as hell did not force myself on you.",
        "Jessica: Oh, really? Well, how would you characterize it? Foreplay?",
        "Marshall: I was grieving and I needed someone. I needed you.",
        "Jessica: Oh, so it didn't matter what -- what I needed or what I wanted.",
        "Marshall: If you didn't want me last night, all you had to do was say so.",
        "Jessica: What part of \"no\" didn't you understand?",
        "Marshall: You've said no before, Jessica. But it -- all it meant was \"I want you, but I can't let myself give in.\" It's what we do. You resist, I coax.",
        "Jessica: Past encounters are irrelevant here.",
        "Marshall: All right, if -- if you really wanted me to stop, why didn't you just cone me over the head with a frying pan and then just run for the door?",
        "Jessica: In my own house? I have to defend myself in my own house?",
        "Marshall: Whatever the territory -- you didn't try to stop me. You gave in. Forgive me for comparing it to what we've done before, but Jessica, it's the dance we do. And it's a good dance. Admit it.",
        "Jessica: How out of touch are you, Marshall, that you can't distinguish seduction from force?",
        "Marshall: How can you keep saying these things?",
        "Jessica: You took what I did not offer.",
        "Marshall: Look, we're not strangers, Jessica. We're friends. And we've been lovers because we chose to be.",
        "Jessica: No, last night was your choice, not mine. And what you chose, Marshall, is called sexual assault.",
        "Marshall: Sexual assault? You're joking, right? You realize what you're saying? You -- that -- I can't even say the word.",
        "Jessica: Well, let me say it for you.",
        "Marshall: No. Because I am not capable of such an act.",
        "Jessica: Oh, yes, you are.",
        "Marshall: I mean, is that -- is that really how you feel about last night? Assaulted?",
        "Jessica: I have never -- no man has ever -- you scared me.",
        "Marshall: But you didn't seem scared to me. You gave in.",
        "Jessica: No, I relented. I relented. There's a big difference. I did not give myself to you freely. You took what you wanted.",
        "Marshall: But I've been aggressive with you before sexually, Jessica. You didn't mind.",
        "Jessica: You're twice my size, Marshall. You pinned me down. I could barely move. There was nothing passionate about it. It was demeaning. And it was humiliating. And it was criminal.",
        "Marshall: Criminal? You think I committed a crime last night? Well, if that's true, then -- then why are you standing here arguing with your alleged attacker? Why don't you report this so-called \"crime\" to the police?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Should I have Claude send up another latte for you?",
        "Craig: No, no. No. What do you want to say to me?",
        "Barbara: We have -- we have one thing in common, you know? We each love our children.",
        "Craig: Yes. Yes. Yes, well, I would give the world to keep Lucy safe, and I miss Bryant every day.",
        "Barbara: And I've just lost custody of my youngest child. Having your children taken away, it's -- well, there's nothing more precious. And I just wanted to tell you how very sorry I am about Bryant. And I'm really sorry about Lucy's accident.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: And no matter how I feel about you personally, I always wanted your children to be with you.",
        "Craig: Look at this. Talking like civilized human beings here.",
        "Barbara: Something like that.",
        "Craig: Barbara, I know it's difficult for you to talk to me, but do you mind if I give you a little advice?",
        "Barbara: Well, I suppose so.",
        "Craig: Drop the vampire act.",
        "Barbara: I should have known you would come to insult --",
        "Craig: No, no, no. I'm being completely straight with you. Drop the fangs, and maybe your family and some of your friends might see their way back into your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Trust you? If I didn't trust you, would I be willing to change my life for our baby?",
        "Carly: I didn't ask you to change your life. And I certainly didn't ask you to see my divorce as an opportunity for us to set up house.",
        "Mike: I know we're not in love.",
        "Carly: At least that's one thing we can agree on.",
        "Mike: What happens if you end up getting back with Jack? Or you find somebody else, all right? I just -- I don't want to be the jerk left sharing the ice cream cone with the kid for a couple hours on the weekend.",
        "Carly: Aren't you a little ahead of yourself?",
        "Mike: I just want you to be clear about my commitment to the child. I do not want to be left out of this.",
        "Carly: I don't believe this. Why don't you go to Hal and talk to him? Ask him. Ask him if I have ever been anything but fair to him when it comes to Parker.",
        "Mike: Career changes are real, Carly. And changes of the heart aren't uncommon for anyone.",
        "Carly: I know, I know. Fickle Carly. Irresponsible Carly. I have heard it all from everybody. I know that this baby needs a father, and I would never deny her access to him. And it really irritates me, it irritates me to no end that you, of all people, are gonna start sounding like the rest of these know- nothings in this town.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry, all right? I -- I was in the wrong. I know you're not gonna let me down.",
        "Carly: Then why are you doing this?",
        "Mike: I'm just anxious, you know? This is all new to me.",

        "Mike: You know I don't mean that.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I know. I know you don't mean that. I know you're scared. And I'm scared, too. But we're both doing the best we can, and I think that we need to trust each other when it comes to the important stuff. And if you can't do that, then maybe I should move out.",
        "Mike: Don't go, Carly, all right? I don't want to push you away.",
        "Carly: I think this situation might be a little too volatile.",
        "Mike: Yeah, but here we are.",
        "Carly: Know what I do at night? After the baby's stopped kicking and there's no sound but the sound of that lake lapping against the sand? I imagine all the other ways this could have gone. Like if Molly had forgiven you, it would be her laying in that bed listening to the night sounds.",
        "Mike: Or if Jack would have asked you to move back in.",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Mike: But that didn't happen, all right? So here we are.",
        "Carly: Here we are.",
        "Mike: Don't go, all right? You've just got to realize that ever since that day at the hospital, all this has started to seem very, very real to me. It's just -- this baby, our little girl. How something that small can change your whole life is --",
        "Carly: A miracle.",
        "Mike: It's just starting to feel like this is my future, and I want this. But if you leave -- all right. All right, I'm not going to say anything that's gonna push you away. Just -- please stay.",

        "Carly: No. No, I was just leaving. Take all the time you need.",

        "Barbara: Fangs? Vampires? Is that how you repay my apology?",
        "Craig: No, no, no. I accept your apology. I'm just trying to give you some good advice here. Now, do you want to hear it or not?",
        "Barbara: Okay, fine. Shoot.",
        "Craig: You are more defended than the Roman Empire. And your fuse is way too short.",
        "Barbara: Well, can you blame me, after everything I've been through with Will? And before that, it was you and third-degree burns and Carly stealing my company and Paul's betrayal, Rose D'Angelo trying to take my son away from me. Can you blame me if I'm a little bit touchy, Craig?",
        "Craig: See, there you go again. Hmm?",
        "Barbara: What am I doing?",
        "Craig: You're reciting the litany. You are blaming everybody else and everything for all your problems. What do you want? Hmm? What do you want? What do you want most right now?",
        "Barbara: To see Will smile again. And not the kind of smile that he smiles when he thinks he's making me unhappy. Everyone thinks I don't see that he's walking on eggshells around me, but believe me, I see. And I just want my life normal again.",
        "Craig: Well, then, lose the past. You can't change it. You can't control it. So lose it, all right? Try not making threats. Move on. Let a couple things slide.",
        "Barbara: Smile and the world smiles with you?",
        "Craig: Try it. You never know. [Craig laughs] oh, I do have a special feeling for you, Barbara.",

        "Craig: Yes, but it's special. And strangely enough, I am glad our paths crossed.",

        "Marshall: Go ahead, Jessica. Call the police. Report this so-called \"criminal assault.\" Or did you already do that down at OPD? Should I go upstairs, pack my bags and wait for Margo's siren?",
        "Jessica: I didn't tell her.",
        "Marshall: Why not? She'd ride to your rescue.",
        "Jessica: I don't know why I didn't tell her. I was about to. And then you called.",
        "Marshall: You didn't tell her because you didn't have the guts.",
        "Jessica: I don't lack the guts for anything, Marshall.",
        "Marshall: Except admitting your feelings for me. Now, Margo and everybody else in this town know we've been lovers. All right, they also know that the only reason why I'm staying here in your house is because you insisted. Now, if you go around screaming \"sexual assault,\" you think anybody's gonna take you seriously? You have no case, Jess. All right, this is bogus. And that's why you didn't tell Margo what happened.",
        "Jessica: Maybe I don't have a credible case against you for assault. But there is action I can take.",
        "Marshall: Against me?",
        "Jessica: No, for me. And the first thing is to drop you from my client list, effective immediately. Get somebody else to get you out of trouble. As of here and now, I don't give a damn.",

        "Marshall: Without you, Jess, I don't have a prayer of seeing justice done.",
        "Jessica: For God's sake, Marshall, I was asleep. I was completely vulnerable. And you just -- I mean, doesn't that matter to you? You know, maybe I'll make that phone call after all.",
        "Marshall: Wait, wait, what are you doing?",
        "Jessica: Calling Margo.",

        "Mike: I have been dreaming for day and night that you'd say those words to me. After the last time we talked, I didn't hold out much hope. Can I ask you something without you getting mad at me?",

        "Mike: Do we have a shot at a happy ending? I tried to convince you for weeks that you were the only person that I cared about. You weren't having it. I'm pretty much all talked out.",
        "Molly: You told me that if I asked you to come back to me, you would. Do you remember?",
        "Mike: I remember everything. I remember the first time that we danced and the first time that you kissed me. I remember every promise that we made to each other.",
        "Molly: You told me all I had to do was say the word.",
