Kit secretly watches Carly arrive at their meeting place, but she stays out of sight. Will pleads with Gwen to reconsider what she is thinking.

        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey. Well, the undercover still watching the house. At least he'll protect you from Kit.",
        "Carly: Well, she's not going to come anywhere near this place with the cops out there.",
        "Jack: Exactly. And now she's gone without a trace.",
        "Carly: What are we going to do, Jack? Parker's trial is right around the corner.",
        "Jack: I don't know. But time is running out.",
        "Carly: Parker, what are you doing here?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I know I'm not supposed to come to the house. It's dangerous. What have I got to lose?",
        "Jack: Hey, Parker, don't give up hope yet.",
        "Parker: Dad, tell the truth. Your plan to prove I'm innocent didn't work, did it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Oh, I guess I fell asleep.",
        "Paul: It turns out that \"Treasure Island\" is not as riveting as I remember.",
        "Sofie: Sorry, maybe we should read another book?",
        "Paul: No, no, there's good stuff coming up. There's kidnapping and pirates and murder -- all the best things in life.",
        "Sofie: Okay, you're the patient. What?",
        "Paul: I'm just glad you're here, that's all.",
        "Sofie: You wish Meg hadn't left. I wish I hadn't lost Hallie. We're both pretty hopeless.",
        "Paul: No such thing as hopeless, Sofie.",
        "Gwen: Paul?",
        "Sofie: Gwen, what are you doing here?",
        "Paul: I asked Gwen to come here.",
        "Gwen: You didn't tell me Sofie was going to be here.",
        "Paul: No, I didn't. But I thought it would be a good idea for her to see her baby.",
        "Sofie: You shouldn't have done this, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I know what you're going to say, but I just can't stand those weedy, nasty little things that people bring to the hospital all the time -- Chris, Chris, Chris, where's Paul?",
        "Chris: He checked himself out against doctor's orders.",
        "Barbara: He's in no condition.",
        "Chris: Well, that's what I tried to tell him.",
        "Barbara: How could you let him leave all by himself?",
        "Chris: He didn't leave all by himself. Sofie Duran took him home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: You really should not have done this, Paul.",
        "Paul: I was just trying to make you smile.",
        "Sofie: You know what? It only reminds me that I -- I lost my baby forever.",
        "Paul: I'm really sorry. I -- I didn't mean to upset you. I thought this might be just what you wanted --",
        "Sofie: You know, it is exactly what I do not need.",
        "Paul: Sofie?",
        "Gwen: This is wrong, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker, we can't give up now.",
        "Carly: It's going to work out, Honey.",
        "Parker: There's no proof that someone else fired that second shot and killed Sam.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm going to get the proof. I promise you.",
        "Parker: Don't promise something you can't do, Mom. It's not fair. They're trying me as an adult. They're going to throw me in jail.",
        "Jack: No, listen -- listen to me. We're going to find Kit and we're going to prove that she's the guilty one. You can't give up.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, I'm just facing the facts.",
        "Carly: Parker, we have battled worse odds than this. You have to keep the faith.",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay -- you let us worry about finding Kit and proving your innocence, okay? You concentrate on being you, huh? Like making the varsity baseball team.",
        "Carly: Yeah, really, Sweetie. Just try to get your mind off of all this, okay?",
        "Parker: How? We all go to Al's and order hot fudge sundaes?",
        "Jack: Well, maybe we could catch a spring training game.",
        "Parker: In Arizona?",
        "Carly: Yeah, that's a great idea. Watching the Cubbies play for a couple of days, maybe that's just what you need, right?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I'm not supposed to leave town.",
        "Jack: Well, maybe I can check with Margo and see if she can give you a couple of days off. I'll call her right now.",
        "Carly: Wow, that spring training sounds good, doesn't it?",
        "Parker: Yeah, giving the condemned man his last wish.",
        "Carly: Parker, you have to try to stay positive.",
        "Parker: Is that what you do, Mom? Just forget about reality?",
        "Carly: Hey, I have been through a lot of tough situations in my life, and I have come through. You should take my advice.",
        "Parker: Are you coming with us?",
        "Carly: No. I'd like to. But I think it's a really good chance for a father-son trip, you know.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I just hope they let me leave town.",
        "Jack: Well, I just talked to Margo, and she said it wouldn't be a problem. We're good to go.",
        "Parker: All right.",
        "Jack: Yes -- okay, so we only have a 24-hour pass. Are you sure you're going to be okay?",
        "Carly: Yes, oh, yes. I'm under 24-hour surveillance here. I'm fine.",
        "Jack: Well, stay in the house. Keep the door locked, and let him protect you.",
        "Carly: Don't worry.",
        "Jack: Let's get back to the farm so you can pack. Say good-bye to your mom.",
        "Carly: Bye. You'll have a great time, Sweetheart. I love you.",
        "Parker: Take care. Take care of yourself Mom.",
        "Jack: You listen to your son --",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Jack: Okay?",
        "Carly: All right, I'll be fine. Go, go on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, Gwen, stop. Look, don't -- don't run away from me, all right? I'm in too much pain to run after you and -- just stay for a second and talk to me, okay?",
        "Gwen: You know, Will and I tried to include Sofie in Hallie's life. Okay, but she took advantage of us. She kidnapped Hallie. She endangered her life.",
        "Paul: Yeah, she's admitted that she made a mistake --",
        "Gwen: So you have to understand that it's pretty hard for us to trust her. And I'm sorry, but the judge ruled against her. He decided that she was unfit to care for her child --",
        "Paul: Right, you won, Gwen. Fine. You're Hallie's mother. But Sofie -- she's just a kid. She's lost everything. I think she should be able to have some kind of contact with her baby. I look at Hallie and I can't help but think of the baby that I lost with Emily. Meg and I just lost a baby. I know what she's going through -- and you, come on, Gwen, you of all people, should know what it's like to lose a child. You and Will and Hallie, you're a family. You're so lucky. You have each other. And nobody's trying to take your happiness away from you. I just -- I don't see why that happiness has to come at Sofie's expense, that's all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Sofie Duran is not qualified to care for a man in Paul's condition.",
        "Chris: I didn't approve of Paul leaving the hospital in the first place. But he's very stubborn.",
        "Barbara: Why didn't you stop him?",
        "Chris: He's an adult. Paul can do as he wishes. His doctors, not even his mother, can stop him. He signed the release, he left.",
        "Barbara: So, that's the end of your responsibility, Chris?",
        "Chris: No, I checked in on him at Fairwinds. He was supposed to hire a private nurse, but Sofie was there taking care of him.",
        "Barbara: And why didn't he call me? Or his brother? Why depend on Sofie?",
        "Chris: I have no idea. Paul seems to have taken Sofie under his wing.",
        "Barbara: Well, she's been reading to him, but take him home -- is that a little bit much? What is she up to?",
        "Chris: Sofie is not up to anything. She's had a rough time. And no offense, but Paul Ryan is probably the last person Sofie needs in her life right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Got you a latte.",
        "Gwen: Well thank you, I need one. How was class?",
        "Will: It was really good. I got a paper back, apparently I have penetrating insights. Just like I can tell that you're not listening to me right now.",
        "Gwen: No, no, I am. I absolutely am. You got an \"A\" on your paper at school.",
        "Will: What's bothering you?",
        "Gwen: Paul called me earlier today, and he wanted Hallie and me to come by at Fairwinds.",
        "Will: That's kind of weird.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I just thought he was probably, you know, feeling lonely and wanted to have some family there, so -- so we went.",
        "Will: So, how was it?",
        "Gwen: Sofie was there.",
        "Will: Paul knows that Sofie's not supposed to be anywhere near Hallie. Did she put him up to this?",
        "Gwen: I don't think so. She looked as surprised as I did. She was really upset to see Hallie.",
        "Will: Paul knows that we don't want to see Sofie, and that she's not supposed to see Hallie.",
        "Gwen: Will, calm down. Come on.",
        "Will: He had no right do that to you. I'm going over to Fairwinds. I'm going to set him straight.",
        "Gwen: No, Will. That is the worst thing you could possibly do right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Carly: Hello? Oh, no, no. No, stop right there, please. I'm perfectly happy with my cable service. Okay? But thanks. And don't call here again.",
        "[Banging]",
        "Carly: Who's there?! Whew. I've got to get Jack to cut those branches.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: No, thank you. Whatever it is you're selling, i don't want it.",
        "[Answering machine beeps]",
        "Kit: Hey, Carly -- I know you're there.",
        "Kit: Carly? It's Kit. This is important. Meet me at the Chicago Loop Scenic Shop on Midwood Street. I got some information you'll be very interested in, but come alone.",
        "Carly: Kit! Kit! Don't hang up!",
        "Kit: I knew you were there.",
        "Carly: What's this all about, huh?",
        "Kit: Look, I've been thinking about this whole thing. You were right about that second shot. Maybe your son didn't kill Sam, after all.",
        "Carly: I know, Kit. I know you did it.",
        "Kit: No! No, I would never hurt Sam, but I think I've figured out who it was.",
        "Carly: Who?",
        "Kit: We can't talk about this on the phone. You gotta come to Chicago. Alone. Carly, if you bring any cops, including your ex-husband, you'll never see me again.",
        "Carly: And why should I believe you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Would you stop worrying? Your mother's going to be fine. The police will protect her.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but if there's any kind of trouble, Mom usually tends to find it.",
        "Jack: You got that right. But she understands she's got to stay put. She wants you to have a fun time.",
        "Parker: I guess. But what can go wrong in one day?",
        "Jack: Exactly. And we've got tickets to see the Cubs play the Diamondbacks. Are you up for that?",
        "Parker: Definitely.",
        "Jack: Go Cubbies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kit: I loved Sam. You know I did.",
        "Carly: Sure, you loved him. That's why you got mad enough to kill him.",
        "Kit: No. I might have yelled and screamed in a fight, but I would never put a bullet in his heart. I mean, you don't -- you don't really think I could do that, do you?",
        "Carly: Honestly, Kit, I don't know what you're capable of.",
        "Kit: I couldn't. And I want his killers to get what's coming to them.",
        "Carly: Well, who is it?",
        "Kit: Well, you don't know these people. And if they know that I'm onto them, I'm dead. But I've got -- I've got evidence -- I've got evidence to nail them.",
        "Carly: Why don't you give it to the police?",
        "Kit: If I go to the police, the killers will kill me. No, I'll -- I'll give you the evidence in private, then you give it to Jack, and nobody gets hurt.",
        "Carly: When?",
        "Kit: Tonight. 6:00. And Carly, if you want to keep your kid out of prison, then you better be here. Alone. Or you'll never see me or the evidence to clear your kid.",
        "Carly: Kit? Kit! This is a trap. It's a trap. But what if it's not? What if -- what if she actually does have the evidence to clear Parker, then? Then you've got to do this. First, you have to ditch the cop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will, would you please just let it go, all right? Paul's in no shape to fight right now. He should still be in the hospital.",
        "Will: Paul has to know that what he did was wrong.",
        "Gwen: He does. I told him that.",
        "Will: Well, maybe he should hear it from me. If he actually cares about family the way he says he does, then he will choose us over Sofie.",
        "Gwen: He might not, all right? He's identifying with Sofie right now. She just lost her baby, Paul's baby just died. He just thought a visit with the child will be helpful for Sofie and for him --",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm sorry for Paul's loss, but all I care about is you and the baby, and it's not his choice if Sofie is going to get to see Hallie. He had no right to decide that for you.",
        "Gwen: Sofie told him that he was wrong, all right? And I think that he saw that she was very upset. She ran out of the room.",
        "Will: I don't care about Sofie. All I care about is you and Hallie. And so should Paul. If he doesn't get that, then I'm going to explain it to him in a way he's going to understand.",
        "Gwen: Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Its okay, Daddy's going to be back soon. It's all right. Okay? It's all right. It's okay. Mommy's right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: What exactly is going on between you and Sofie Duran?",
        "Paul: Oh, hi, Mommy. I was in a car bomb.",
        "Barbara: Don't be smart with me. Its one thing to have the little match girl reading to you, but why would you let her bring you back here against doctor's orders? And why on earth is she taking care of you instead of a professional?",
        "Paul: Well, the nursing agency sent Meg over.",
        "Barbara: Meg?",
        "Paul: Yeah, Meg, but she couldn't handle it, so she left. You don't need to worry about me. Sofie's taking good care of me.",
        "Barbara: Reading you \"Treasure Island\" is not going to help your burns heal. You belong in a hospital, Paul.",
        "Paul: You don't need to worry, Mom. I'm going to be fine.",
        "Barbara: That's not what the doctors think.",
        "Paul: Ooh, Dr. Chris Hughes.",
        "Barbara: He's very concerned about you.",
        "Paul: He's very concerned because I'm spending time with Sofie.",
        "Barbara: Don't you think she's a little young for you?",
        "Paul: We're friends, Mom. Right now, I need all the friends I can get.",
        "Barbara: Are you all right?",
        "Paul: I'm fine. It's time for some ointment. Do you mind?",
        "Barbara: Of course not. I'll do anything to help you, Paul. You know that.",
        "Paul: Thanks.",
        "Barbara: Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Gwen, I -- I need to explain. I had absolutely nothing to do with Paul inviting you and Hallie over. I didn't know -- it was his idea.",
        "Gwen: I know. I know. He told me, and I saw how upset you were to see her. I know that it has been really hard for you, losing her all over again.",
        "Sofie: I really thought the judge was going to let me be her mom.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. Do you want -- do you want to hold her?",
        "Sofie: No, no. If I hold Hallie again, I'll never want to let her go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Mom? Mom?",
        "Barbara: I know the kind of pain you're going through. I -- I have felt this. I remember.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry. I should have realized that this would bring back bad memories for you.",
        "Barbara: The pain was excruciating. I just prayed that none of my kids would ever have go through it. And now, look at you, Paul.",
        "Paul: If this is too much for you do, I understand --",
        "Barbara: No, no, no, no, let me help you, okay, let me, please, please help you. I'm sorry. You know, my burns were so bad, I just never thought that I would recover. But I did. I did, and you -- you will, too. You're going to get through this. You'll get through it. You're strong.",
        "Paul: You're an inspiration, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, right.",
        "Paul: You were very brave. And look at you, now.",
        "Barbara: Yeah --",
        "Paul: Completely healthy.",
        "Barbara: Taking care of you just like when you were a baby. There you go.",
        "Paul: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, now, listen you --",
        "Will: What the hell is wrong with you, Paul? You have gone way too far this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Uh, no, I'm good. Thanks. Listen, there's this -- there's this guy. I dated him just once, but now, he won't take no for an answer. Do you know the type? Well, he's -- he's been following me everywhere, and I just -- I can't lose him. So, I'm wondering if -- if it would be okay with you if I slipped out the back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Listen, if Will and I lost Hallie in the custody case, we'd feel the way you do right now. It's okay.",
        "Sofie: I can't even look at her. It was getting to the point where I can't be in the same room or even the same town with my own baby. I'm sorry. I keep calling her mine, and she's not mine anymore. She's yours -- she's yours and Will's. She's not going to be mine anymore, and I have to go. I have to go.",
        "Gwen: Sofie, don't go. And promise me, please -- promise me you won't leave town because Hallie would miss you too much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Sofie was here and you had Gwen come over with the baby. Why would you do that?",
        "Barbara: Is that true?",
        "Paul: Yes, I did it because I was -- thanks -- I was just trying to help Sofie.",
        "Will: Why do you care? This is not your place to interfere.",
        "Barbara: Will, please. Your brother is not well.",
        "Will: Are you taking his side?",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Will: Were you in on this?",
        "Barbara: No, no, I'm not. I would never do anything to hurt you or the baby.",
        "Paul: Well, neither would I. You are my brother, Will.",
        "Will: Like that's ever mattered to you before.",
        "Barbara: You know what? I don't approve of what Paul did anymore than you do, Will --",
        "Will: That's good, Mom. Because Paul is only out for Paul. He doesn't know what the meaning of family loyalty is, do you? So, get this through your head. If you want Sofie here feeding your ego, that's fine, but you keep her away from us and from the baby. You got that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Sofie, listen to me. I know what it feels like to lose a baby forever. Could you really imagine never seeing her again? And if you left Oakdale, where would you go? You would be all alone.",
        "Sofie: I am all alone without Hallie, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Come on. Don't make this harder on yourself by separating yourself from the people who care about you.",
        "Sofie: No one cares about me.",
        "Gwen: Really? What about Paul? What about Chris, Aaron? They care about you. Will and I, we care about what happens to you. [Hallie cries] Shh. Just think about what I said, okay? Come on. Chris, could you do me a favor?",
        "Chris: What's up?",
        "Gwen: Sofie could really use a friend right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Will, she's just a kid, all right? I know Sofie brought the kid to New York and maybe bringing her baby there was a mistake. But -- but it is her baby.",
        "Will: No, it's not.",
        "Paul: From her point of view, it is. That's how she sees it. And she brought the baby back. She lost custody --",
        "Will: Yeah, exactly --",
        "Paul: Case closed --",
        "Will: Exactly, the baby is ours, not hers.",
        "Paul: She's all alone. She's got nothing. I'm fine. Why can't you just do the decent thing and allow the biological mother to have some contact with her kid? Sofie knows that you and Gwen have custody. What's the big deal?",
        "Will: Paul, this is not your decision to make. You have no right to even do this.",
        "Barbara: Will is right about that, Paul.",
        "Paul: No, he's not. He's just being paranoid.",
        "Will: It's not paranoia if someone is actually out to get you. Why are you constantly trying to mess up my life?",
        "Barbara: I think that's not fair.",

        "Barbara: That's not true, Will.",
        "Will: I swore that I would never be your victim again. It's not going to happen this time. Gwen and I have finally have a baby, and no one is going to take her away from us. So if you know what's good for you, you're going to stay out of this.",

        "Chris: It was wrong for Paul to interfere like that. He should never have put you in that position.",
        "Sofie: No, he thought -- he thought it would be good for me to see Hallie. He thinks that he did the right thing.",
        "Chris: You don't know the real Paul Ryan. He's not the nice guy that he pretends to be. Paul's sister, she thought her baby was dead. He knew the baby was alive, but he kept that from her because he didn't like the baby's father. The guy is real piece of work.",
        "Sofie: Well, I don't believe he would deliberately hurt people like that.",
        "Chris: Believe it.",
        "Sofie: Well, maybe he was trying to help and things didn't go so -- he's been really good to me.",
        "Chris: Hey, just -- okay, just -- just be careful. Okay, Paul always hurts people that he claims to care about. I wish you'd just take my advice and stay far away from Paul Ryan.",

        "Parker: I think need to apologize.",
        "Jack: What for?",

        "Jack: Parker, none of that is your fault.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but you told me not to touch that gun, and I did. I should never have tried to handle Sam on my own. You're a cop. You could have helped me, and then things would be different.",
        "Jack: Maybe. But maybe I wouldn't have believed you. Then think what would have happened to your mom.",

        "Parker: I know. I just -- I keep thinking I should have done it differently.",
        "Jack: Well, no, you can't waste time second-guessing yourself. You did what you had to do. Now, sit back, relax. Come on, chill out. Hopefully, the pilot will let us board soon, and hopefully the Cubbies will rout the Diamondbacks tomorrow.",

        "Sofie: Did he really do that with his sister's baby?",
        "Chris: Yes. Yes, Paul is trouble. Everyone who gets close to him gets hurt.",
        "Sofie: That's just -- it's hard to believe. But then -- but then I believed that Cole was a good guy. He told me he loved me. He was really only out for himself.",

And she can't raise you, and she can't watch you grow. So how can she live with that? How can I take her away from you? If I love you so much, how can I do that to you?",

        "Paul: I guess we're both getting an earful about what a despicable person I am. Will was just here. My brother decided to give me a list of all my shortcomings. Evidently, I'm a terrible brother and a disgrace to the family.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, well, your brother doesn't think very highly of me, either.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, he's wrong about you. Thank you. The truth is, Sofie, I have made a lot of mistakes in my life, and I have the scars to prove it. Literally. But I'm trying to heal myself, inside and out. I guess some people just don't want to give me a break.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I've been thinking about this for a while, Will. I saw Sofie today. I saw how hard it was for her to see Hallie. How she still feels about losing her.",
        "Will: It was her choice to give up the baby.",
        "Gwen: It was, but then she changed her mind. And once we knew that, Will, did we do the right thing by keeping Hallie from her?",
        "Will: Gwen, we are the best parents that Hallie could have. Sofie can't love her anymore than we do. She can't even feed her or clothe her.",
        "Gwen: But I'm sorry, but who are we to judge that? I asked Sofie if she wanted to hold Hallie, and she said she couldn't because if she did, she would never be able to let her go. There is a bond between Sofie and Hallie that you and I will never have. There is an inexplicable connection between a mother a child, and to break that is wrong. I'm sorry.",
        "Will: Gwen, you have a connection with Hallie. I see it every day. I see it when you hold her, when you feed her, when you talk to her. You love her. You're her mother, and I'm her father. I have a connection with her, too.",
        "Gwen: Yes, but maybe I love her enough to do the right thing.",
        "Will: Are those -- are those Paul's words in your head?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: This is how I feel. It has nothing to do with Paul.",
        "Will: He got you over to Fairwinds. Poor, sad Sofie was there. She saw Hallie. She started to cry her eyes out, and now you feel sorry for her.",
        "Gwen: No, this is about my feelings for Hallie.",
        "Will: Gwen, she's our baby now.",
        "Gwen: Yes, and I would do anything for her. I would give my life for her. So, I have to ask myself, if it's the right thing for Hallie, would I be willing to give her up?",

        "Parker: Then, why isn't she picking up her phone?",
        "Jack: Her battery could be dead. Maybe she's hit a patchy area.",

        "Jack: Listen to me. I will find your mother, okay?",
        "Parker: But I want to go with you.",
        "Jack: No, absolutely not. I'm dropping you by the farm. If you want to help, call -- call everyone you can think of. Maybe your mother is visiting someone.",
