        "Casey: Listen. Ali, I --",
        "Alison: Don't --say anything. Please.",
        "Casey: This is why I was trying to warn you. I didn't want you to get hurt.",
        "Alison: I know, Casey. Okay? You were right. Is that what you want to hear? You were right about Matt and I was wrong. How could I be so stupid?",
        "Casey: Take it from me, it's not that hard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: They released Casey. They dropped all charges.",
        "Noah: Oh, thank God. You know, I can't believe he was arrested in the first place. He's not into drugs, he never was.",
        "Luke: Yeah, sometimes I really wonder what his mother's thinking.",
        "Noah: Well, probably when she found the pills in his backpack, you know, what else could she do?",
        "Luke: Well, maybe she could act like her son's not a walking crime scene.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but Luke, she can't ignore the evidence.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but why just assume that he's dealing? That there can't be some good explanation?",
        "Noah: We're still talking about Casey, right?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Noah: All right, just making sure.",
        "Luke: Why do you always have to be so smart?",
        "Noah: I'll work on it.",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Kevin: Hey, what's up?",
        "Luke: Well, I've been texting you for days.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, it's uh -- it's been a little crazy.",
        "Luke: Look, I just wanted to say that I'm -- I'm really sorry about Elwood. I know that he was your friend.",
        "Kevin: I know -- not so much.",
        "Noah: Didn't you guys used to hang out, like, all the time?",
        "Kevin: We had -- we had a lot of the same friends, I guess.",
        "Luke: I just feel like it was my fault.",
        "Kevin: Well, you weren't driving the car.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I was the one he was supposed to meet at that bridge. I just wish that I could have gotten him to talk to the cops.",
        "Kevin: Well, that was Elwood.",
        "Luke: Well listen. You should know that they, uh -- they traced the car.",
        "Kevin: They did?",
        "Luke: Yeah. It belongs to that Matt O'Connor guy. You know that note I found that was signed \"M\"? They think that he was Elwood's supplier. And that he found out Elwood that was going to talk.",
        "Kevin: Did they -- did they catch him?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Kevin: Good.",
        "Noah: Uh, good? He may've killed two kids and he's still on the loose. How is that good?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Yes. Well thank you, Warden. Yes, we already notified his P.O. I'll let you know as soon as we pick him up. I hope so, too. Thank you.",
        "Cop: It's definitely the car.",
        "Margo: Is there any sign of O'Connor?",
        "Cop: No, but there's something I think you should see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kevin: I didn't mean, it's good that they haven't caught him. I'm glad they know who did it. I just -- I just want this to be over so I can stop thinking about it.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I hate thinking about it too.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, it's freaking depressing. Well, I gotta go.",
        "Noah: Well, what can I get you?",
        "Kevin: What?",
        "Luke: Well, didn't you come in here for a coffee?",
        "Kevin: No, I didn't -- I didn't realize what time it was. I just -- I don't have the time.",
        "Noah: Is it just me, or was that way too bizarre?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: So it's not that expensive, but the food is supposed to be really good. I think Casey will like it.",
        "Lily: You said it's in Chicago?",
        "Jade: Yeah, Lincoln Park, on the north side. He probably hasn't had a decent meal since his mom arrested him. I just want his first dinner to be special.",
        "Lily: Does he know that you're taking him?",
        "Jade: Not yet.",
        "Lily: Ooh. Well, what if he already has something planned for his first night out of jail?",
        "Jade: You mean, something that doesn't include me?",
        "Lily: The two of you weren't exactly on the best of terms before he was arrested, Jade.",
        "Jade: Yeah, we weren't. But it's different.",
        "Lily: Are you sure?",
        "Jade: Positive.",
        "Lily: I just don't want to see you get hurt, Honey.",
        "Jade: I'm asking him to dinner. I'm not asking him to marry me.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Jade: I'll save that for the second date.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: They never had anything on me dealing. And they -- they dropped the possession charges.",
        "Alison: That's great.",
        "Casey: Yeah, my P.O. said that even a misdemeanor would've thrown me back in prison. I think they -- they had the papers already written up.",
        "Alison: What happened to \"Innocent until proven guilty\"?",
        "Casey: If you figure that one out, will you let me know?",
        "Alison: Well, at least you can laugh about it.",
        "Casey: Well, what else can I do? I did a lot of thinking when I was in jail. And I realized, you know, if I'm walking around with all these grudges, I might as well just check myself back in.",
        "Alison: Wow, you seem really centered.",
        "Casey: Uh-oh. Psych class?",
        "Alison: No. Rehab counselor.",
        "Casey: That's what the prison shrink says to me all the time, you know? \"Stay in the middle ground. Don't let the highs get too high, don't let the lows get too low.\"",
        "Alison: Well, that's tough. You know, especially the second part.",
        "Casey: Are you talking about Matt?",
        "Alison: I hate feeling like a fool.",
        "Casey: No, it happens to everyone.",
        "Alison: No, I keep thinking there's something wrong with me that I could just -- I could let him play me like that.",
        "Casey: Well, that's what he does. And he's really good at it.",
        "Alison: I know, but even after you told me about catching him in the med supply room, I -- I still bought his story. You know, he just seemed -- he seemed different this time. And I know, I know that's what he does.",
        "Casey: Don't beat yourself up about this. If believing in the wrong person is a crime, a lot of people would be in jail.",
        "Alison: How come you're being so nice to me?",
        "Casey: When I was doing a lot of thinking in jail? I was thinking about you. You know, how we used to be so amazing, and then we messed up everything.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I've been trying to figure that out myself.",
        "Casey: You get anywhere?",
        "Alison: Maybe we're just too damn good at messing stuff up?",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah. Well you know what they say, if you're good at something, it's better to stick to it, right? See, I miss this. Me and you, just hanging out.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I miss it, too. So, with all that thinking you did, do you have any idea how we could get back there?",
        "Casey: As a matter of fact, I do. It's a little sophisticated. You know, part of the new, mature Casey Hughes I'm working on.",
        "Alison: Oh, I can't wait to hear it.",
        "Casey: Yeah? Well, I call do-over.",
        "Alison: A do-over?",
        "Casey: Yeah. I think we should go back to the way things were, you know, before this crap started and pretend like it never happened.",
        "Alison: Just like that?",
        "Casey: Just like that.",
        "Alison: What makes you think it won't happen again?",
        "Casey: Oh. We'll know what to look for. And if either one of us sees it coming, you know, we have to promise to each other we'll talk it out, right away.",
        "Alison: What makes you so sure we can get it right?",
        "Casey: It's different now.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Casey: First of all, Matt's gone.",
        "Alison: Okay, our problems had nothing to do with Matt.",
        "Casey: Well, he was playing us from the minute he got here.",
        "Alison: Maybe he was, Case. But I mean, we were shaky before he ever showed up.",
        "Casey: No, he made it worse. He wrecked our friendship. But look, now -- it's just me and you again.",
        "Alison: Is it? What about Jade?",
        "Casey: She's just a friend.",
        "Alison: Huh, that is not the way it looked the night I went to your house and saw the two of you together.",
        "Casey: That -- it didn't mean anything.",
        "Alison: Maybe not to you.",
        "Casey: Her, either.",
        "Alison: You have to be sure about that.",
        "Casey: I am, I am.",
        "Alison: Okay, you need to talk to her, Casey. You know, make sure things are clear with her, so she knows where things stand.",
        "Casey: I don't think I have to do that.",
        "Alison: I do. Make things clear with Jade. And then, maybe we can talk about a do-over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm just saying you ought to be careful. I mean, you've gotten your signals crossed with guys before.",
        "Jade: I'm tough. And I'm also not wrong about Casey.",
        "Lily: You didn't think you were wrong about Will, either.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well Casey's not Will. And he's not Ricky. He's not married. He's not seeing anyone. And he's not wanted dead or alive anymore.",
        "Lily: Wow. Some catch.",
        "Jade: Look, when he wanted to prove that those drug charges were bogus, he reached out to me. He trusts me.",
        "Lily: Well, just make sure that his feelings aren't just gratitude.",
        "Jade: Oh, don't worry. He's going to be feeling a lot more than that tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: It seemed to me like Kevin couldn't care less about who killed Reg or Elwood.",
        "Luke: Well, he just said that he wanted to stop thinking about it. And I don't blame him.",
        "Noah: He also said he hoped that they didn't catch Matt.",
        "Luke: I don't think that's what he meant.",
        "Noah: Why are you defending him?",
        "Luke: Why are you attacking him?",
        "Noah: I'm not. I just think that something happened in between the two killings that really freaked him out.",
        "Luke: Like what?",
        "Noah: Like maybe he figured out who really did it.",
        "Luke: But we know who did it.",
        "Noah: Maybe we're wrong.",
        "Luke: Well then so are the police.",
        "Noah: Exactly. Which would totally freak me out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Matches the car ID'd by the witnesses on the bridge. And it's registered to Matthew O'Connor.",
        "Margo: Well it looks like he ditched it here after he killed Elwood. You said there was something else? Oh, yeah, this has been forced. And hotwired. So why would he hijack his own car? Hey you, who is the new guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Casey! It's so good to see you.",
        "Casey: Is -- is Jade here?",
        "Lily: Yeah! Jade?",
        "Jade: I'm so glad you came!",
        "Lily: I'll leave you guys alone. Casey, I just want to say that I'm really sorry for what you had to go through. And it's great to have you back where you belong.",
        "Casey: Thanks, hey.",
        "Jade: See, I knew your mom would realize you were innocent.",
        "Casey: What? You knew then? Because I didn't.",
        "Jade: Whatever. It's worth celebrating, though, right? I want to take you to this great restaurant in Chicago. I'm buying.",
        "Casey: Listen. I don't -- I don't think we should do that.",
        "Jade: Okay. Another night.",
        "Casey: I'm not just talking about tonight.",
        "Jade: Why?",
        "Casey: You know, we've been really good friends lately, and I don't want to lose that.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but we're already more than friends, aren't we?",
        "Casey: We tried. You know, and that's where all these bad vibes started.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but we're past that.",
        "Casey: I -- I don't want it to happen again.",
        "Jade: I get it. This is about Alison, isn't it?",
        "Casey: No. No, it's not.",
        "Jade: Matt's gone, and you're going to go back to her. Right?",
        "Casey: We're going to try again, yeah.",
        "Jade: You're an idiot.",
        "Casey: Yes, I know I deserve that.",
        "Jade: No, open your eyes, Casey. It's not going to work. She's going to keep you around until the next guy shows up that she wants.",
        "Casey: Maybe. But I can't just give her up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Alison, Alison, I need a minute. It's important.",
        "Alison: Um, I already told you everything I know.",
        "Margo: No. No information. I need help.",
        "Alison: With what?",
        "Margo: We found Matt's car. It was broken into and hotwired.",
        "Alison: So he was telling the truth?",
        "Margo: Well, it looks like he was. Because the prints that we found were on the lock weren't his.",
        "Alison: Okay, so then it couldn't have been him who was driving the car when Elwood was killed?",
        "Margo: However, he did take off. And that's a problem.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe he was just scared.",
        "Margo: I need to talk to him.",
        "Alison: I don't know where he is.",
        "Margo: Well have you called him?",
        "Alison: Not recently.",
        "Margo: Would you?",
        "Alison: You think he'll answer?",
        "Margo: Yeah, he would. He trusts you.",
        "Alison: And you want to use that?",
        "Margo: Yeah. I do. I need to talk to him. If he didn't do this, he might be able to lead us to whoever did.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I don't think I want any part of this.",
        "Margo: Alison, please. Please. I know that he's a very dear friend of yours. But if he killed those two boys, he doesn't deserve your friendship. If he didn't, he needs your help. Because he's running scared.",
        "Alison: He'll be arrested either way.",
        "Margo: Well if all he did was panic, I'm not going to hold that against him.",
        "Alison: You mean that?",
        "Margo: I wouldn't say it if I didn't.",
        "Alison: What do you want me to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You really think that Kevin knows something?",
        "Noah: I do.",
        "Luke: And that's based on the way he was acting just now?",
        "Noah: No, it's not just that. It's the way he -- it's the way he ran his whole entire sleazy campaign.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but -- but I'm not sure that's all Kevin. I think that was Mark Vero. You know, he was so messed up on drugs, he didn't even know what he was doing.",
        "Noah: Well, he should have made it his business to know. Everything your campaign manager does, he does with your name on it. Problem was, Kevin didn't take the time to figure out what was being done with his name.",
        "Luke: And that's why you're suspicious of him?",
        "Noah: It not just that. You saw him before. He was acting so jumpy, it wasn't just -- it was more than just because of a death of a classmate. Look, I know you really want to trust him. But I think you need to really let that go. Before someone else gets killed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I don't know what's going to happen between me and Alison, okay? Maybe you're right, maybe she'll dump me.",
        "Jade: It's not a maybe.",
        "Casey: But it doesn't mean we --",
        "Jade: If you're going to say we can be friends, I don't want to hear it.",
        "Casey: But I think we can be.",
        "Jade: I think you have to go.",
        "Casey: Jade --",
        "Jade: You said what you came to say. Now leave.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Matt, it's me. Please give me a call as soon as you get this. I think I can help you. There's a warehouse on Fourth Street. And we can meet there. And it's safe. And -- just call me so we can set up a time to meet. Please. This is very important. Okay.",
        "Margo: Wow. That was good. Thanks.",
        "Alison: This better not be a trap.",
        "Margo: I promise you -- I promise, if Matt can help us figure out how Elwood Hoffman and Reg Addington lost their lives, then he is off the hook, and we're one step closer to getting a killer off the streets. All right? So call me as soon as he contacts you. Thank you.",
        "Mark: Hi, Alison.",
        "Alison: Mark! What are you doing here?",
        "Mark: I'm just looking for you.",
        "Alison: Why? I don't have the key to the meds, if that's what you're thinking.",
        "Mark: I already told you, I am clean.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know you said that, but -- are you okay?",
        "Mark: Me? I'm great. I just need you to come with me.",
        "Alison: Uh where?",
        "Mark: I can't tell you that, Alison.",
        "Alison: Why not?",
        "Mark: Because I am a junkie, and we both know that junkies never tell the truth.",
        "Alison: You're high, aren't you?",
        "Mark: No. But that could also be a lie, couldn't it?",
        "Alison: Okay. Let me go get you a doctor.",
        "Mark: What for?",
        "Alison: You need help.",
        "Mark: I don't need help, Alison. I need you. You don't have to worry, Alison. I'm not going to jump off a building or anything, okay?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "Mark: Are you sure about that? Because I can give you and your boyfriend a lot of trouble.",
        "Alison: I don't have a boyfriend.",
        "Mark: The cop's kid.",
        "Alison: Casey? What about him?",
        "Mark: You walk out of here with me like everything is fine, and he doesn't get hurt.",
        "Alison: Where is he?",
        "Mark: I will show you.",
        "Alison: I'm not going anywhere with you until you tell me where he is!",
        "Mark: Well, then he's dead.",
        "Alison: Mark!",
        "Mark: Let's go!",
        "Alison: You promise Casey won't be hurt?",
        "Mark: Sure, I promise. But you know what? That could be another one of those junkie-lie things, couldn't it?",
        "Alison: Why are you doing this?",
        "Mark: Do you ever want to see Casey again? Stop asking me so many questions. Now, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, I'm looking for Alison Stewart.",
        "Resident: She was just here. I don't know where she went.",
        "Casey: Okay. Thanks.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Casey: You checking up on me?",
        "Margo: Yes.",
        "Casey: Well, I'm at the hospital, I'm looking for Alison. Did you find Matt?",
        "Margo: No, not yet. Is Alison there?",
        "Casey: Uh somewhere.",
        "Margo: Ask her if Matt called and then call me back.",
        "Casey: Why would he?",
        "Margo: She left him a message.",
        "Casey: How do you know that?",
        "Margo: Because I asked her to. I need to talk to him.",
        "Casey: You're using her as bait?",
        "Margo: Casey, it's just a phone call. You know, she's setting up the meeting, and then we'll take it from there. She won't be anywhere near him.",
        "Casey: He's a cri -- he's a criminal, maybe even a murderer!",
        "Margo: We're not so sure of that now.",
        "Casey: What are you talking about?",
        "Margo: We found evidence that it might not be Matt.",
        "Casey: You're kidding me!",
        "Margo: That's why Alison agreed to call him. She wants to be sure he's exonerated.",
        "Casey: She said that?",
        "Margo: Yes, she wants him to be treated fairly. And he will be.",
        "Casey: What -- what if you're wrong? Then he'll have her! And who knows what he'll do to her!",
        "Margo: I told you, she's not going to be anywhere near him.",
        "Casey: Well, I'm going to make sure you're right! And then I'm going to ask her to stop doing favors for people that don't give a damn about her.",
        "Margo: Casey.",
