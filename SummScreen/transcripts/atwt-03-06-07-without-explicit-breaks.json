Gwen is about to tell Will what went on between her and Adam when she sees how hurt he is. Maddie intercedes on Gwen's behalf and explains Adam attacked Gwen, but she convinced her not to tell anyone since he didn't actually rape her and that Adam is gone forever. Will is distraught and this propels him onto a mission to find Adam one way or another to make sure he pays. Katie and Henry disagree on Henry's role in Vienna's life and not to mention the role of taking on her money to keep her from having to turn it over to Leonia; Henry won't budge and even signs the papers in front of Katie. Emily arrives at Cheri and ends up being required to attend a group party. Dusty follows her and goes inside. Gwen and Maddie are concerned about Will running off half-cocked, but their fear is interrupted when they see Jade receiving flowers from Adam. Maddie doesn't believe he sent them and Jade wonders if Maddie sent them? Emily spies Dusty at the party and hides. She gets Cheri to cover for her, much to her dismay. Dusty sees her leave and heads out after her, only to bump into someone else. Katie finds Jack at Al's, where he is forced to admit that he used his kids as an excuse. Katie tries to hide being hurt, but tells him it is for the best since she turns everyone against her sooner or later. Jack wants to stay with her and talk. Meg offers Holden a shoulder. Will tells Jade and Luke about Adam attacking Gwen. They all wonder what Adam is up to? Vienna is able to get Henry's mind off of Katie.

        "Katie: Well, you obviously don't know anything about Henry, because if you did, you would know that he can't stand to have his ears touched, he's very sensitive.",
        "Vienna: Yes, I know that.",
        "Katie: Don't pay attention to her, Henry. She's obviously lost touch with reality. The stress of her royal ex suing her for every penny she's ever had has sent her over the edge.",

        "Luke: So, she's still --",
        "Holden: Yes. I just don't know how to reach out to her. I mean, an idea that you're not pretty, and food is the enemy, I just don't get it. I'm sorry. I don't mean to drop all this on you. I'm just -- I'm just very worried about her.",
        "Luke: No, I'll look out for her.",

        "Dusty: You hungry?",
        "Emily: Look, I know you want to talk about this, but I'm really not up for it, okay? So, I'm sorry my mother dragged you into my little nightmare. And I promise you it won't happen again.",

        "Gwen: You're right. Something did happen with Adam, but not what you think.",
        "Will: Gwen, do you know where he is? If you know where he is, you got to go tell the cops. Because Casey's going to end up taking the rap for planting the bonds if Adam's not brought in.",
        "Gwen: I know.",
        "Will: So where is he? Gwen, why are you protecting him?",
        "Gwen: I'm not. It just -- it's just that there are other people involved.",
        "Will: Well, like who?",
        "Gwen: Like -- like me. Look, I know I should've told you, and I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't. And you're right. It's put this wall up between us and I hate it. And I've felt so alone without you.",
        "Will: Well, I'm right here.",

        "Katie: Jealous?",
        "Vienna: Yes, you're afraid that now that Henry loves me, he won't care about you anymore. But you're his best friend. And I'm sure he'll keep a tiny little spot in his heart for you. Besides, now you have me. And you'll see, it'll be just like having a younger, prettier, little sister.",

        "Luke: Well, then maybe the family could go when school's out.",
        "Holden: What's the problem? I know all the other kids are going. I saw Kevin's dad at the post office. Everything okay with your friends? I thought they accepted you.",

        "Emily: I did not. And even if that were true, it's nobody's business. Right? I mean, unless I file a complaint or something, the police have no business to interfere, right?",
        "Jack: It depends. If you were assaulted --",
        "Emily: I wasn't assaulted, Jack. I told you, it was an accident. Excuse m gcuseot to go.",

        "Gwen: We were afraid that nobody would believe us.",
        "Maddie: You know what? This is all my fault. Gwen wanted to tell you when it happened but I begged her not to. And I shouldn't have done that. Obviously, it's put a huge strain between both of you --",

        "Gwen: We --",
        "Maddie: Adam attacked Gwen.",
        "Will: What? When?",
        "Maddie: The day that Margo got promoted at the police station, before everything happened. He came onto her and she turned him down and he got really angry, and he forced himself on her --",
        "Will: Are you okay? Did he --",
        "Gwen: No. It didn't get that far. I'm fine.",
        "Will: Why didn't you tell me?",

        "Will: Well, you could've told me. I would've understood.",
        "Gwen: I know.",
        "Will: I guess I didn't give you a chance to, really. I mean, I was so angry at you for siding with Adam.",
        "Gwen: I didn't side with him.",
        "Will: Well no, you didn't, but you were trying not to get in the middle, you know. Trying to make us both happy and finish the demo at the same time. And then when Casey confessed to Adam trying to set me up, you were too afraid to tell me.",
        "Gwen: No, stop -- none of that matters anymore.",
        "Will: It does matter. I put you through hell.",
        "Maddie: What's important is that Adam is gone, and we're never going to see him again.",
        "Will: I thought you just said you knew where he was.",
        "Maddie: Well, she thought that she did, because Adam -- wasn't he trying to get you to run away with him? He was making promising about your career and everything --",
        "Will: What? Run away with him where?",
        "Gwen: London.",
        "Maddie: And since he wrote the email, and he confessed. He's not in L.A. Or London or anywhere, because the cops are after him. So, he's on the run --",

        "Will: I'm going to talk to jade.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no.",

        "Maddie: Listen, you cannot trust her. She's a liar.",
        "Will: No, jade will talk to me.",
        "Maddie: Like she talked to you about the baby? And not one word of it was true? Will, she'll say anything to get what she wants.",
        "Will: Look, all I know is that he is going to pay for what he did to Gwen, what he did to all of us, all right? And if I have to drag it out of jade to find out where he is, fine, so be it.",

        "Holden: No.",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Holden: No, not exactly. But the point is, I don't want you to think that I'm second-guessing your choices. This is not easy. It's a small town. You're probably the only boy in high school --",
        "Luke: Oh, no, there you'd be wrong.",
        "Holden: Really?",

        "Henry: Oh, that's big of you to throw me that crumb.",
        "Katie: I'm just trying to point out that it's a little weird, don't you think? She's signing her entire fortune over to you based on sex.",
        "Henry: It's not just sex. She trusts me.",
        "Katie: She's using you.",
        "Henry: Of course she's using me, and I'm using her. With all that money, I can take care of a little outstanding debt, and then I'll still be on top of the world financially. Plus, she's fun and it doesn't hurt my image to walk into the casino with a woman like that on my arm.",
        "Katie: And how long is this going to last?",
        "Henry: As long as it lasts. A month, a week, a day, as long as she needs me.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and what happens when she doesn't need you, Henry?",
        "Henry: Ciao, bella.",
        "Katie: I thought she was Swedish. Does it bother you that there's an entire country that's suing her?",
        "Henry: Oh, it's a small country.",
        "Katie: Who could end up suing you --",
        "Henry: Not if they can't prove fraud. We genuinely like each other, Katie.",
        "Katie: The only genuine thing about that woman is her nerve.",
        "Henry: I wouldn't take that bet if I were you.",
        "Katie: Stop smiling like that!",
        "Henry: Oh, I see what's bothering you. I'm happy.",
        "Katie: No, Henry, I want you to be happy. Just not with her.",
        "Henry: Why not?",
        "Katie: Because she's going to use you and dump you and leave you with a bunch of problems.",
        "Henry: Or maybe, just maybe, after everything's she's been through, she is looking for someone like me, Katie. A nice person. A kind person. Someone who knows how to have fun, and yes, can make her toes curl. And what is it to you? If just for once, I get to feel a little less overlooked and a lot less lonely?",
        "Katie: I am lonely and lost, too, Henry. I'm just trying to let you know that -- I'm trying to change, you know, I don't want to keep making the same mistakes. And you shouldn't either. I don't want to go for the first thing that comes my way --",
        "Henry: Right, you're lonely, Katie, that's a joke. You're lonely? You know what? As soon as you get over feeling sorry for yourself, the men will be lining up at your door.",
        "Katie: I am not feeling sorry for myself. I just want you to know that I know how you feel. I'm with you.",
        "Henry: No, you're not. No, you're not. You're not me, you're even close to me. You're a gorgeous blonde, you've got this great TV job, and you got a whole big family that loves you.",

        "Henry: Who is worth the risk? Do you see a lot of people lining up to claim me? Do you?",
        "Vienna: Here they are, my darling. Sign on this line and then everything that is mine will be yours.",
        "Katie: Don't do it, Henry.",
        "Vienna: Will you stop being such a party pooper? Sign the papers and let's go be happy.",

        "Emily: I thought you said you wanted to have a conversation?",
        "Cheri: I did. Look, Bambi didn't show up. She's a no-show, her kid has appendicitis, so I needed more bodies. You're elected.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, I don't do parties.",
        "Cheri: You do what I tell you to do, and after last night, you owe me. I can't afford to lose another client.",

        "Cheri: No, no, no, no, it's not what you want, it's what they want. Now go in the other room, get changed, put some makeup on your face and at least make sure everyone has a drink in their hand. Can you do that much for me?

        "Maddie: You're right. I'm sorry. I just -- I wanted, I just can't stop, I know that it's not going to go away, and -- this is all my fault -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Maddie: You wanted to call the police, I stopped you.",
        "Gwen: Listen, Maddie, if I really wanted to call the police, I would have done it regardless of what you said. We decided to bury him together. And we can't go back on that now. And we can't tell anyone. Ever. None of this changes why you did what you did. You were just trying to protect me.",
        "Maddie: And you're trying to protect me. What are you doing here?",
        "Jade: I'm meeting Luke, not that it's any of your business.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, wait someplace else.",
        "Jade: What it is with you two?",
        "Gwen: Nothing. We're just leaving. Come on.",
        "Jade: No, no. It's fine. I'll just meet him outside.",
        "Delivery guy: You jade Taylor?",
        "Jade: Ah, yeah.",
        "Delivery guy: These are for you.",
        "Jade: That's not possible. The only person that knows I'm here is Luke. And he wouldn't send me flowers.",
        "Deliver guy: What can I tell you?",
        "Jade: Oh my god.",
        "Maddie: Who are they from?",
        "Jade: Adam.",
        "Jade: Hey!",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry, Adam. That's it?",
        "Jade: What is your problem?",
        "Maddie: I'll tell you what my problem is. It's a typed card from a florist. Anybody could've sent that.",
        "Jade: So what? So, what are you saying? I sent it to myself?",
        "Maddie: Maybe.",
        "Jade: Why would I do something like that? I don't want anything to do with Adam, let alone his cheap flowers. Maybe you sent them. They kind of look like you. Pink and girly.",
        "Maddie: Why would I send you flowers from Adam?",
        "Jade: I don't know. Maybe you have something to prove? Next time, make it orchids!",
        "Luke: And she's good to go.",
        "Holden: You know, I raised you to be the best that you can be, and you are. I just had to admit that I never expected you to want to spend the rest of your life with a man.",
        "Luke: Let me get a date first, okay?",
        "Holden: What I'm trying to say here is, -- you know, when you get the opportunity -- you know, you're a terrific person and anyone would be proud to know you -- what? Why are you laughing?",
        "Luke: I'm laughing at you. I am laughing at you, dad.",
        "Holden: What for?",
        "Luke: Because I'm making you feel so damned uncomfortable.",
        "Holden: No, I'm not uncomfortable. I'm just trying to find my way here.",
        "Luke: Well, it's okay. It's okay. There's no hurry.",
        "Holden: That's exactly what I'm trying to say here. There's no hurry. And I would be saying the same thing if you were trying to hook up with a girlfriend.",
        "Luke: No, you wouldn't.",
        "Holden: I would. I would. And Luke, I get it. I know what you're going through. I know the feelings. I know the desires. And I'm your father. I want what's best for you. I want what's best for all my kids.",
        "Luke: Okay, dad. Whatever you say.",
        "Holden: It's true.",
        "Luke: And it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable? You know, thinking about me and another guy?",
        "Holden: One, I don't think about it. It's not my business. And two, I would have just as hard a time if your sisters were with some boy. Maybe even harder. They could get pregnant. And all the rest of that stuff.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Holden: Just wait.",
        "Luke: Until what? Wait until I'm a parent? I mean, who knows, I could adopt. Just trying to keep your life interesting, dad. [ Cell phone rings ] Yeah?",
        "Jade: Hey, I thought you were meeting me.",
        "Luke: Well, I am. I just -- I just got sidetracked.",
        "Jade: Well, can you hurry because I really need to talk to you. It's important.",
        "Luke: Where are you?",
        "Jade: At crash.",
        "Luke: I'll be right here. Gotta run.",
        "Holden: Who's that?",
        "Luke: Mr. Right. It was jade. See you later, dad.",
        "Katie: Please don't do this, Henry.",
        "Vienna: Why not? Henry, what did she tell you?",
        "Henry: She gave me some advice on how to make a good decision. Thank you, Katherine.",
        "Vienna: You're rich, my darling, filthy rich. This calls for more champagne. Will you join us, Katie?",
        "Katie: I can't. Good-bye, Henry.",
        "Cheri: And what can I do for you, sweetheart?",
        "Dusty: I'm looking for someone.",
        "Cheri: Aren't we all. Hey, stranger, where have you been?",
        "Guy: They keep my nose to the grindstone.",
        "Cheri: Let's see if we can't do something for that nose.",
        "Girl #1: Hey, darling, you thirsty?",
        "Dusty: No, thanks. What's going on here?",
        "Girl #1: Oh, it's a party. Anything else I can get you?",
        "Girl #1: So, who is this mystery girl?",
        "Dusty: Her name is Emily Stewart.",
        "Girl #1: She told you her last name? She must like you.",
        "Dusty: What do you mean?",
        "Girl #1: Most of the girls here keep it simple, first names only. I'm Lila.",
        "Dusty: Hi, Lila. So, how does it work? Do I pay at the door, is there a fee, or do I pay you?",
        "Girl #1: I'd do you for free, honey. But cheri, she'll want my rate.",
        "Dusty: Well, I understand. Maybe another time. Have you seen my friend, Emily, she's blonde.",
        "Cheri: Whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going? I told you to change.",
        "Emily: You see that guy over there? Behind you?",
        "Cheri: Tall, dark and handsome?",
        "Emily: He knows me. He was the one I was with when we first met.",
        "Cheri: I thought he looked familiar.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, he sees me, he's going to make scene. He's going to stop this party, and you don't want that. You've got to figure out a way to get me out of here. Please.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Jack: Katie, hi.",
        "Katie: I got your message.",
        "Jack: Yeah, good. I didn't want to leave you hanging.",
        "Katie: Where are the kids? In the car?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Katie: Oh, I thought you said we couldn't get together because you had to watch the kids.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know, that's what I said. Only -- I'm sorry, Katie. I used the kids as an excuse. The truth is, I just wasn't up to it. I didn't want to go out. Sorry.",
        "Katie: It's okay. I understand. You just didn't want to be with me.",
        "Meg: Is the coast clear?",
        "Holden: Don't worry. I'll let you know before mama comes home.",
        "Meg: So, what's the tractor doing up front?",
        "Holden: Wouldn't start.",
        "Meg: Again? I thought it was fixed.",
        "Holden: Maybe your friend, Craig, isn't the genius mechanic that he led you to believe he was. Luke and I fixed it, though.",
        "Meg: Luke likes to take things apart, doesn't he? You know, I remember one birthday, he got this train set, and after two hours, there were little pieces all over the living room floor.",
        "Holden: Yeah, he was six. I remember he was tears, he expected his dad to be able to put it all back together.",
        "Meg: And daddy couldn't?",
        "Holden: No. And some things never change.",
        "Meg: What happened?",
        "Holden: Nothing. It's just -- I don't know. Luke's life isn't exactly carefree right now. And I can't help him fix it. I don't even know what to say.",
        "Meg: Did you guys have a fight?",
        "Holden: No, no. It was nothing like that. We were just outside, we were working on the tractor, talking. I asked him about spring break. And he said that he wasn't going with the rest of his class.",
        "Meg: Why not?",
        "Holden: Because it's all about hooking up. Having someone special. And he doesn't.",
        "Meg: So, it will happen.",
        "Holden: That's what I tried to tell him.",
        "Meg: So, what's the problem?",
        "Holden: Well, the problem is, it was a disaster. I couldn't find the right words. I was starting to have this conversation with my son, I didn't know what to say. But there he was, taking it all in stride.",
        "Meg: He was taking it all in stride because he knows it's unfamiliar territory for you. And he forgives you for it. He loves you, Holden.",
        "Holden: Is that why he went running off the second he had a decent excuse?",
        "Meg: What excuse?",
        "Holden: He got a call from jade.",
        "Jade: I don't know. I just want to know why Gwen and Maddie wouldn't leave me alone.",
        "Luke: Well, you don't even know if it was them.",
        "Jade: You haven't seen the way they've been acting, Luke. They're panicking. And it's not even like they were asking the right questions, like has Adam called me again? Or do I know where he is? It was all about how it was impossible that Adam sent me this bouquet because I'm not worth his $12.95. I mean, I get these pathetic flowers, and Maddie's like, you sent them to yourself, and we know it.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but jade, come on, why do you care?",
        "Jade: It's just that her and Gwen are acting so strange. And Gwen is acting worse than Maddie -- it's just weird.",
        "Luke: So, it's weird. But you know what? You've got lots of other bigger things to worry about.",
        "Jade: Like what?",
        "Luke: Like finding someone who has better taste in flowers.",
        "Will: I need to talk to you.",
        "Luke: Well, she's with me now. But if you're nice --",
        "Will: Where's Gwen?",
        "Jade: I don't know. She left with Maddie a little while after I got these.",
        "Luke: These are from Adam?",
        "Will: What? Where is he?",
        "Maddie: How can they stay in business without keeping records?",
        "Gwen: It's a little florist shop.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but they're hiding something. Jade paid them not to tell us.",
        "Gwen: No, come on.",
        "Maddie: Okay, she went through the trouble of sending flowers to herself, at crash, when she knew we would be there.",
        "Gwen: She didn't know that we were going to be there.",
        "Maddie: So then she followed us around town, making sure that she knew where we were so she could ambush us.",
        "Gwen: I don't know, Maddie. That sounds like a lot of effort, even for jade.",
        "Maddie: Oh, come on, we are talking about the girl who pretended she was pregnant when she really wasn't.",
        "Gwen: That's because she wanted to be with will. This, I don't understand. Why send herself flowers?",
        "Maddie: Because she wants to get back at me because I didn't send her an email from Adam.",
        "Gwen: She doesn't know that you send that email.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but she knows that I made such a big deal about it. And I embarrassed her, you even said so yourself.",
        "Gwen: So, that's why she made up the story about Adam calling her. If she made it up --",
        "Maddie: He didn't call her, Gwen. He didn't leave her flowers, okay? She must've done this all herself. He's dead, okay? He's dead, and we buried him. He's not calling 1-800-daisies from the grave.",
        "Gwen: I know. You're right. Okay. It's just so bizarre.",
        "Maddie: What is that?",
        "Gwen: It's a package for me. Oh, my god.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Gwen: Maddie, look where the return address should be.",
        "Maddie: AM. Adam Munson?",
        "Gwen: It's Adam. Purcell users see the world differently.",
        "Vienna: To you, my darling.",
        "Henry: We already toasted to me. Twice.",
        "Vienna: Well, three's a charm. You're unhappy.",
        "Henry: Me? What are you, kidding -- no, I'm delirious. My banker's going to have a coronary over this, I think. And thanks to you, we get to have this really wonderful champagne.",
        "Vienna: But you barely touched it.",
        "Henry: Right, so, bottoms up.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. Look at me. Henry, you can't fool me. I know you. You know, you're unhappy because your so-called best friend Katie made you feel bad.",
        "Henry: No, I'm not --",
        "Vienna: No, yes, she said terrible things about me and she told you not to sign the papers, but you did anyway, and she got angry and stormed off like a little child.",
        "Henry: Yeah. That about covers it.",
        "Vienna: Well, you mustn't let her ruin this moment for us. No, she'll get over it. When she realizes that I really, truly love you.",
        "Henry: Maybe.",
        "Vienna: Okay, I'll go talk to her.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, sit down. No, you can't do that. Just let her calm down.",
        "Vienna: Okay.",
        "Henry: Are you okay? Did you have too much champagne?",
        "Vienna: Oh, I'm drunk --",
        "Henry: Oh.",
        "Vienna: On your touch. Oh Henry, I need you. I want you, right now.",
        "Henry: Okay, if you want me right now. Fine.",
        "Jack: Katie, sit down.",
        "Katie: I don't want to sit down.",
        "Jack: No, I want you to sit down, please. Because I want -- I want to apologize. I don't want to be standing in the middle of al's --",
        "Katie: You don't have Jack, it's my fault. I drive people away.",
        "Jack: No, that's not true at all.",
        "Katie: Really? Where's mike? Gone. And now Henry.",
        "Jack: Well, what about him?",
        "Katie: He shacked up with Vienna.",
        "Jack: Henry?",
        "Katie: Sad but true.",
        "Jack: Huh. Henry and Vienna. Interesting. I can't wait until brad gets a load of that.",
        "Katie: Please don't mention his name.",
        "Jack: Sorry.",
        "Katie: No, I just need to face the facts. Whoever knows me ends up hating me. But it's my fault. Because whenever somebody good and kind and decent comes into my life, like mike and Henry, I don't treat them nearly as well as they treat me. And so, you did the right thing. You should just stay away from me.",
        "Jack: Now, Katie. Listen to me for a second. The reason I left you that message, it had nothing to do with you. Really. It's me. Listen, I'm still raw. And sometimes -- sometimes I'd just rather stay at home, keep life really simple, you know.",
        "Katie: You don't have to explain --",
        "Jack: Yes, I do. Because you're my friend. And I want you to understand why I bolted. And why I'm here. You and I, we've been dealt a lot in the last couple of months. And I know -- I know that if anyone understands what you're going through, it's me. So how about we share this take-out, okay? And we can talk about Henry or whatever.",
        "Katie: Oh Jack, I don't know. I really should get home and wash my hair.",
        "Jack: Oh.",
        "Katie: Gotcha. There better be fries in here.",
        "Jack: I got first dibs on the fries.",
        "Katie: No, what kind of friend are you?",
        "Jack: The only friend you've got.",
        "Cheri: You know something? You're more trouble than you're worth. Just want to let you know, we've got lots of pretty blondes, if that's what you like.",
        "Dusty: Emily! Hey.",
        "Girl #2: Hey, handsome. You looking for me?",
        "Dusty: No, sorry.",
        "Holden: Okay, I'm going to head home. And spend a little time with Oakdale's youngest TV star.",
        "Meg: Who's that?",
        "Holden: Ethan. He's going to be in TV commercial. This baby food project that Lily is working on.",
        "Meg: Oh, that's exciting. Lily must be having so much fun.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I wish. Every time we get a moment together, it's like she's about ready to jump out of her own skin.",
        "Meg: Oh, this project is, you know, her first chance to make a big splash at worldwide. She must be stressed.",
        "Holden: Yeah, a little stress, I can understand. But she's just driving herself so hard. And god forbid, I try to talk to her about it.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Holden: Because she thinks that I'm criticizing her. Every time we talk, you know, we just don't connect. Same thing with faith. It's like I can't communicate with anybody these days.",
        "Meg: Well, you're doing a pretty good job with me. Look, you are an amazing father and a wonderful husband. And I'm not going to let you beat yourself up like this. Your family's so lucky to have you. Every single one of your kids looks up to you. I've seen it. Even jade.",
        "Holden: It's funny that you would say that, because I really haven't seen jade that much. It seems like she's avoiding everyone except Luke. I wonder why.",
        "Will: So what did the delivery guy say?",
        "Jade: Nothing.",
        "Will: Well, he had to have said something.",
        "Jade: No, he asked me my name, and he handed me the flowers.",
        "Will: So, you didn't ask him who they were from or if he had seen the guy?",
        "Jade: It was a delivery guy. I didn't even know who they were from until after he left.",
        "Will: Jade, why didn't you go after him?",
        "Luke: Will? Will, just take it easy.",
        "Will: Look, he attacked my wife!",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Will: Yeah, Adam attacked Gwen.",
        "Luke: What are you talking about?",
        "Jade: What are you saying? That he physically went after her. Did he hurt her?",
        "Will: Yeah, he tried to.",
        "Luke: No, no, that's possible, is it?",
        "Jade: Well, he could be a little bit rough.",
        "Luke: Wait a minute. I don't understand. So, he sets you up, he attacks Gwen -- and now he's sending you guys emails and sending you flowers? I mean, what's his game?",
        "Jade: But he's not sorry. He's never sorry. Where is he? I mean, if he's in town, why tease us?",
        "Luke: And why risk getting arrested? Because the cops are after him, right? What does he want?",
        "Maddie: Lots of people have those initials.",
        "Gwen: It's Adam.",
        "Maddie: Gwen, he is dead. Okay? I'm telling you, it is jade. She's doing this to freak us out. First the phone call and then the flowers and now this -- what is it?",
        "Gwen: It's my wedding ring. The one that I lost in Adam's grave.",
        "Announcer: On the next \"as the world turns.\"",
        "Emily: Let go of my arm!",
        "Dusty: Or what? Are you going to call cheri?",
        "Jack: She shoots, she scores!",
        "Katie: Yes!",
        "Jack: Beautiful. Nicely done.",
        "Gwen: Hey, there is another explanation. Adam's still alive. And he sent me the ring."
