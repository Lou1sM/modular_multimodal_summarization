        "Jack realizes where Carly went when he hears the message Kit left for her. At the deserted shop, Carly calls out for Kit, but the only thing that she is met with is something large falling from the loft near her. Jack races to the shop in Chicago. Allison shows up for her date with Matt, but then invites Casey to go with them to an Oakdale University mixer. Noah invites Ameera to the mixer. Carly comes across Cowboy Jack, who is propped up with a recorder playing in his lap. Jack calls for back-up and reaches the shop racing in to find Carly. Luke is unsure if Ameera should join them, but Noah is sure enough for them all. Casey joins Allison and Matt too. Holden and Lily take a shower together and finally make love. Noah worries about Ameera most of the night while Luke tries to get him to loosen up. Matt wonders if Allison is trying to avoid being alone with him? She assures him that she just wants to get to know him slowly. Casey notices Ameera and Matt works his charms on her to get her to dance with Casey. Jack hears Carly scream, as she dodges a falling item. Carly races into Jack's arms and soon the police show up and search the area. Kit is not found, which rattles and upsets Carly. A hiding Kit watches them all leave. Parker shows up at the house when Jack and Carly come home; he knows they didn't find Kit. Casey and Ameera seem to be hitting it off, as do Allison and Matt. Lily and Holden receive a call about Ameera and try to reach Luke. Federal agents show up at Yo's looking for Ameera. Noah dodges their questions, but Luke admits to where she is. When the agents try to take Ameera, Casey punches one of them and is arrested, as Matt watches close by. Noah decides to take off with Ameera when the agents are preoccupied with Casey, and Luke goes with him. Carly and Jack try to keep Parker's hopes up. Parker asks to stay with Carly and Jack agrees knowing there is an officer outside. Jack offers to stay as well. Carly innocently asks him to stay upstairs with her so she doesn't have to be alone. There is an awkward moment when Jack sees Carly's nightie and seems to have trouble not staring, but soon they are comforting each other by simply lying in each other's arms. Casey is brought to the station and Dallas is forced to read him his rights. Allison tries to make his bail while Matt secretly calls Gray. Luke, Noah and Ameera arrive back at the Farm and explain to Lily and Holden what happened. Noah won't let them take Ameera and she pleads with them not to let her be taken back to Iraq. Holden worries that they made things worse. Allison overhears Matt talking to Gray asking him for a favor to make this go away. The agent shows up to take Ameera into custody. They plead with him to let her stay, but he informs them that she is a Foreign National and the Government reserves the right to question her and detain her as long as they want. He informs them all that they can call the local Homeland Security office in the morning to find out what is going on. Carly awakens from a nightmare in Jack's arms, but then she hears a noise downstairs and goes to investigate. She finds Parker staring at Cowboy Jack propped up in their chair in the living room."

        "Jack: Carly? Carly? [Cell phone rings] Damn it, Carly.",
        "Kit: Carly, it's Kit. This is important. Meet me at the Chicago Loop Scenic Shop on Midwood Street. I got some information you'll be very interested in. But come alone.",
        "Carly: Kit, I know you're here. Come out! I came alone, I swear it! Will you stop playing games and come out? Kit?",
        "[Carly screams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yes, this Jack Snyder of the Oakdale Police Department, I'm requesting assistance. Yeah, I realize I'm out of my jurisdiction. But it's an emergency -- I need back up now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Dude, I still cannot believe you suckered me into registering for classes.",
        "Matt: Hey, I got your mom off your back, didn't I?",
        "Casey: For now. Whoa, whoa! Dude, way too much cologne!",
        "Matt: I gotta smell good for Alison.",
        "Casey: She's going to pass out.",
        "Matt: You're just jealous because your big date is with the remote.",
        "Casey: It gives me what I want. Hey man, um -- thanks for telling Alison the truth about us being cellmates.",
        "Matt: Well, she kind of had you cornered. I couldn't leave you hanging.",
        "Casey: If you can tell Alison the truth, why can't you come clean with my parents?",
        "Matt: Dude, they would flip out if they find out I've been lying to them and I'd be on out on the street. Is that what you want?",
        "Casey: No, no.",
        "Matt: Look, Casey, things are going really good for me right now. I -- please don't blow this for me.",
        "Casey: My mom is pretty happy about me going back to school.",
        "Matt: Thanks to me. You see what a good influence I am?",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah. I guess it won't kill me to keep quiet for now, but you so owe me.",
        "Matt: No problem. You know I'm good for it, right?",
        "Casey: Yeah, okay, I got your back.",
        "Casey/Matt: Fling.",
        "Matt: I knew you'd see it my way. [Knock on the door] I was just coming to pick you up.",

        "Matt: So what are you doing here?",
        "Alison: I was in the neighborhood.",
        "Matt: You're not bailing out, are you?",
        "Alison: Not at all. But there's a mixer for O.U. at Yo's tonight. And thought Casey might want to come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: Oh, I'll do the dishes. You should relax after that lovely meal.",
        "Lily: Oh, if you do the dishes by yourself, you'd be here all night.",
        "Ameera: It's the least I can do. I owe you so much for letting me stay here and enroll at Oakdale U.",
        "Lily: How was your classes on your first day?",
        "Ameera: Interesting, not what I expected.",
        "Noah: Ameera was great. Everyone thought she was fascinating and really smart too.",
        "Ameera: Well, they're curious about me.",
        "Noah: Well, they'll get to know you better tonight at the O.U. March mixer.",

        "Noah: It's a dance for the O.U. students.",
        "Ameera: I've never been to a dance.",
        "Noah: It's a lot of fun. It'll be great. We'll go. There's going to be good food. Me and Luke will take you. It'll be a lot of fun, right, Luke?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Casey: I don't think so.",
        "Alison: Come on, we'll meet your friends.",
        "Casey: I don't have any friends at O.U. anymore.",
        "Matt: Casey's still in shell-shock from registering for classes.",
        "Alison: Get over it. What's the big deal?",
        "Casey: I don't want to be a third wheel on your big date with Matt.",
        "Alison: It's not like it's a date-date. I don't care if you tag along. I mean, do you?",
        "Matt: Of course not.",
        "Casey: Okay, I'll go for a little while.",
        "Alison: Great.",
        "Matt: Let's get going.",

        "Matt: Sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Of course, Ameera can come with us. We'll find you a nice guy to dance with, it'll be fun.",
        "Ameera: Maybe I should just stay and study.",
        "Noah: You want to learn everything you can about America, don't you?",
        "Luke: Well, maybe this is too much for her.",
        "Lily: Yeah, a big part of college life is the social part.",
        "Noah: Yeah, it'll help you adjust. Please come.",
        "Ameera: Okay, I will.",
        "Noah: Great. Tonight we can celebrate your future in America.",
        "Ameera: Should I change?",
        "Lily: No, are you kidding? You look beautiful.",
        "Ameera: I could put something else on.",
        "Lily: No, you look great. Right? Doesn't she look great?",
        "Noah: Yeah. I mean, Yo's is pretty casual. You don't need to change.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and by the end of the night, half of the people will be hooking up or spilling drinks on each other anyways.",
        "Ameera: What? Hooking up?",
        "Noah: We'll explain in the truck.",
        "Holden: Where are you guys going?",
        "Lily: They're going to Yo's.",
        "Holden: Yo's?",
        "Lily: Yo's.",
        "Holden: They're not 21.",
        "Luke: Well, it's a college mixer.",
        "Holden: Oh, no drinking for you, Pal.",

        "Ameera: There's going to be alcohol?",
        "Noah: You'll still come, right?",
        "Lily: You don't have to go if you're not comfortable.",
        "Holden: Who's driving?",

        "Luke: Bye.",
        "Lily: Be careful.",
        "Holden: See ya.",
        "Lily: Ah, the youngsters. Remember being that young?",
        "Holden: I still feel that young -- when I look at you.",
        "Parker: My dad hasn't called. This isn't good.",
        "Lily: Oh Parker, I'm sure everything's okay.",
        "Parker: No, I'm worried about my mom. I think something bad happened.",
        "Holden: You know what? I'm sure that Jack has everything under control.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yes, I need backup at the Chicago Loop Scenic Shop on Midwood Street ASAP. Hurry, would you, please? A woman's life could be in danger.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You won't get away with this, Kit! How do I get the hell out of here?",
        "Cowboy Jack: Admit it, Pardner, you love the little lady. You know what you got to do and it's not going to be pretty!",
        "[Cowboy Jack laughing]",
        "[Cowboy Jack laughs]",
        "Carly: I know what you're trying to do, Kit! It's not going to work. Why don't you show your face so we can have this out, one on one? No wonder Sam ditched you! You have no guts, Kit! You're a coward!",
        "[Carly screams]",
        "Jack: Carly! Carly, where are you?",
        "Carly: Jack! Jack --",

        "Carly: I know, I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Are you okay?",
        "Carly: I am now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How's Parker doing?",
        "Holden: Not so good. I put a movie on for him to watch.",
        "Lily: Poor kid. He was just trying to protect his mother.",
        "Holden: Luke did the same thing for you.",
        "Lily: I know.",
        "Holden: I can't help but think about what Jack and Carly are facing.",
        "Lily: They're going through hell. Remember when Luke took the blame for me when he thought I killed Julia -- he would have been in jail for a very long time.",
        "Holden: We're lucky it didn't turn out much worse.",
        "Lily: Jack and Carly, they'll get through it. They're strong. They have to be.",
        "Holden: Does it still bother you?",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: Julia.",
        "Lily: It was a long time ago -- I try not to think about it.",
        "Holden: You know, I shouldn't have brought it up.",
        "Lily: No, I know it still bothers you about what happened with Dusty.",
        "Holden: Well, I'm just trying to leave all of that in the past.",
        "Lily: Yeah, me too. Try to focus on what's good in our life right now.",
        "Holden: I do, everyday --",
        "Lily: Are you hungry?",
        "Holden: Umm, I'm going to take a shower first, okay?",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Holden: Hey, why don't you join me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: If we waited any longer, there would've been a line. You guys get stamped?",
        "Noah: Yeah, no drinking for me.",
        "Ameera: Why do they stamp you?",
        "Noah: If you're under 21, you can't drink alcohol.",
        "Luke: Lots of kids have fake ids, though.",
        "Noah: So what do you think?",
        "Ameera: Its -- loud.",
        "Luke: Oh, this is tame. Wait until last call.",
        "Ameera: Parties are very different in Iraq.",
        "Luke: I'll go get some sodas.",
        "Noah: You're okay, right?",
        "Ameera: Yeah.",
        "Noah: Relax, I mean, you're here with me and Luke. We'll have fun, I promise.",
        "Rob: Hi, I'm Rob, from Global studies. You're a transfer, right?",
        "Ameera: Yes.",
        "Rob: Yeah, I can e-mail you notes from class if you want.",
        "Ameera: Thank you.",
        "Rob: Is this your boyfriend?",
        "Luke: Actually, this is my boyfriend.",
        "Rob: Cool -- you want to dance?",
        "Ameera: No, thank you.",
        "Noah: She'll catch up with you later. He seems nice, maybe you should go dance with him.",
        "Ameera: I don't even know him.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on. It might be fun. He seems cool. Come on, Guys, let's go dance.",
        "Ameera: I don't know how.",
        "Noah: Nobody really does, we're just going to wing it.",
        "Luke: Yeah, dancing's no big deal here. Groups of kids dance together, it's cool.",
        "Noah: Come on, try it.",
        "Ameera: I will, but only if you dance with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: It's been a long time since I partied.",
        "Alison: Oh, it'll all come back to you, I'm sure.",
        "Casey: This isn't really for me.",
        "Matt: Well, we're here now, so why don't you make your rounds? Go scope out the ladies.",
        "Casey: You have a one-track mind.",
        "Matt: Hey, why did you invite Casey on our date?",
        "Alison: You two do everything together. I don't want to come between best friends.",
        "Noah: Actually, I promised Luke my first dance.",
        "Ameera: I'm sorry. I don't mean to come between you two.",
        "Noah: No, no. It's fine. But why don't you dance with Rob, and we'll dance right next to you guys.",
        "Ameera: Okay.",
        "Noah: Hey look, she's doing great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey, you're supposed to be on a plane to Phoenix. How'd you get here?",
        "Jack: The cop who was following you called after you ditched him. And Parker was acting anxious, so we left the airport. He's safe and sound at the farm with Lily and Holden.",
        "Carly: How'd you find me?",
        "Jack: I heard Kit's message on your machine.",
        "Carly: She brought me here to kill me, Jack.",
        "Jack: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Carly: Could be worse. And she's here, somewhere. We have to find her, make her confess.",
        "Jack: Well, the Chicago Police will be here soon.",
        "Carly: She planted Cowboy Jack.",
        "Jack: No, no, don't touch it. Let the cops dust it for prints.",
        "Carly: Well, I did. I touched the tape recorder. I shut it off.",
        "Jack: That's okay. We'll tag all of the evidence, start building a case against Kit.",
        "Carly: Well, it's not going to do us any good if we can't find her.",
        "Detective: Secure the perimeter. Do a complete search of the entire building.",
        "Jack: You might want to dust the dummy for prints. Probably won't turn up anything, but it's worth a shot. There's the photo of the suspect.",
        "Detective: What else do we know about this woman?",
        "Jack: Name's Kit Fowler out of Manley, Idaho. Check her priors, pretty entertaining rap sheet. She's suspected in connection to a murder back in Oakdale. She took off before we could question her.",
        "Carly: You can add assault with a deadly weapon to the list, too.",
        "Detective: If we catch her tonight, we can hold her for breaking and entering. Don't worry, if she's here, we'll find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I can't remember the last time we did this.",
        "Holden: It's been a long time.",
        "Noah: What happened? Are you okay?",
        "Ameera: I guess I wasn't ready to dance like that.",
        "Noah: Hey, it's all right. You take things at your own pace.",
        "Luke: At least it wasn't a slow dance.",
        "Noah: Do you want me to get you another soda or something?",
        "Ameera: I'm fine. Just go dance.",
        "Noah: Maybe she's not ready for this.",
        "Luke: No, no, no. Just give her some time. She'll be fine.",
        "Noah: I really want her to fit in.",
        "Luke: I know. I know, so do I. But Ameera's a really smart girl. She'll figure it out.",
        "Matt: I have a theory.",
        "Alison: You do?",
        "Matt: Yeah. You don't want to be alone with me.",
        "Alison: Why would you say that?",
        "Matt: Oh, I don't know. You invite Casey out on our date. You insist on coming to a crowded bar on college night. I think you're a little bit freaked out by me.",
        "Alison: I am not. I just thought this would be a good place for us to get to know each other better. And I don't want to move too fast.",
        "Matt: You sure? Knowing that I went to jail doesn't bother you?",
        "Alison: Does my past bother you?",
        "Matt: No.",
        "Alison: Then why don't you tell me why you ended up in jail?",
        "Matt: Check out our boy. Looks like he could use a little bit of help from his best buddy.",
        "Alison: Casey can handle himself.",
        "Matt: Look at him, no way. She's cute.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Matt: Ask her to dance.",
        "Casey: Man, you ask her. She's -- probably not our type.",
        "Matt: Well, there's only one way to find out.",
        "Casey: No, don't. Please, please --",
        "Matt: Hi. You see my friend over there? He's really shy, but he wants to dance. What do you say?",
        "Noah: Hey, who's that guy?",
        "Luke: No idea.",
        "Noah: Is he hitting on her?",
        "Luke: She'll be fine.",
        "Noah: What if she freaks out again?",
        "Luke: Come on, Noah, she can handle herself. Besides, we need some time to ourselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Are you sure you're all right? We could swing by the emergency room on the way home.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to the hospital, Jack. I want Kit behind bars. She killed Sam, there is no doubt in my mind.",
        "Jack: And we are not going to let Kit get away with that. But there's not much more we can do tonight. So let's get you home.",
        "Detective: We've dusted the dummy for prints. Nothing came up.",
        "Chicago cop #1: We searched the building. No sign of the suspect.",
        "Detective: We'll keep looking. She seems to be pretty good at covering her tracks.",
        "Carly: We know.",
        "Detective: All right, here's my card. I'll be in touch.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Detective: We have to clear out of here, close up.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry they didn't find her. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: So my friend wants to dance with you. He's cute, right? What do you say?",
        "Ameera: Thank you, I already danced.",
        "Matt: Only once? You're just getting warmed up. But you gotta go easy on him. 'Cause it's been a while and he's a little bit rusty.",
        "Ameera: I don't understand.",
        "Matt: Rusty like uh -- Rusty, right?",
        "Alison: Okay, what have you done with Casey Hughes?",
        "Casey: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: You want to dance with her, but you're too shy? Come on! Have fun.",
        "Casey: All right, all right. Go amuse yourself in Matt and I'll be fine.",
        "Matt: Hi, Guys. This is Ameera, she's from Iraq.",
        "Alison: Iraq? Are you visiting?",
        "Ameera: I'm a student at Oakdale U.",
        "Alison: You're a long way from home.",
        "Ameera: Yes, I am.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm Alison, it's nice to meet you. And this is Casey.",
        "Casey: Hi.",
        "Matt: I convinced Ameera to take pity on you. Go ahead and dance.",
        "Casey: Are you sure? I'd be honored.",
        "Alison: That was a sweet thing you did.",
        "Matt: Believe me, I had my reasons.",
        "Luke: She'll be fine with Casey.",
        "Noah: Maddie's Casey?",
        "Luke: He's a good guy.",
        "Noah: Didn't he just get out of jail?",
        "Luke: He would never do anything to hurt her. Come on. Can we please, please go get some air?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Are you sure you're going to be okay driving home?",
        "Carly: I'm fine.",
        "Jack: I will be right behind you, just in case.",
        "Carly: Would you not worry? I just want to get home.",
        "Jack: Me, too. Be careful.",
        "Carly: I can't believe I left this here.",
        "Jack: You're home safe, that's the only thing that matters.",
        "Carly: You know, if I hadn't gone alone, Kit would be behind bars by now.",
        "Jack: Stop it, Carly. You've been through so much these last few weeks. You shouldn't beat yourself up.",
        "Carly: I will not let that woman destroy this family.",
        "Jack: Kit thinks she's good at covering her tracks, but she'll slip up and we'll nail her.",
        "Carly: What if we never find her? Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Parker: Dad called me from the car. I had to make sure you're okay.",
        "Carly: I'm fine.",
        "Jack: I told you there was nothing to worry about, parker.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right. Stop lying and tell me what happened. You didn't find Kit, did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
