        "Henry brings Katie a peace offering of flowers. He explains that there is almost nothing that he wouldn't do for her, but he hasn't changed his mind. He can't get past the thought of Vienna and Brad having a baby together. They will have this unbreakable bond. And there is always the thought that Vienna may want to keep the baby. Katie tries to convince him otherwise, and he says he will give it more time to think about it. Vienna and Brad also share baby talk at the diner. She thinks Henry is being pig-headed, but hopes he will come around. Vienna experiences some morning sickness symptoms and asks Brad to take her home. Craig needs a sitter and Lucy is more than happy to oblige. Dusty is right around the corner and he and Lucy make plans for him to spend time with Johnny. Emily greets Paul and tells him to be kinder. She is helping him make Meg jealous. Yes, their last scheme made a small dent and got a rise out of Meg, so it's just a matter of time now, fate accompli. Meg shows up unexpectedly. Emily hides, and Meg apologizes for previous behavior. If Paul wants to keep company with Emily, then she won't try to stop him. Emily tells Paul that it sounds like he also just gave Meg the permission to sleep with Dusty. Paul ticks Emily off and she threatens to leave and let him find another way to get Meg back. He gives in and admits that he needs her help. Meg spies Dusty at a table at the Lakeview and sits down. She invites him to hang out with her, but he declines and tells her that he will be taking advantage of Craig being at a meeting and he will be spending some time with Lucy and Johnny. Craig's meeting is cancelled, and Meg catches him in the lobby before he heads back upstairs. She delays him a few minutes. Then she quickly calls Dusty for him to duck out quickly. She goes to his room, and he thinks she is jealous of Lucy. She denies it and ends up kissing him. They start ripping off each other's clothes and panting for each other, but Meg calls it off. The time just wasn't right. If she only knew that Paul was right outside ready to bust down the door. Emily stopped him.",
        "Henry comes home and finds Brad massaging Vienna's neck with peppermint oil to soothe her nausea. Henry comes in and barks that he knew it. It's not only their chromosomes co-mingling, but everything else as well. Brad explains that it is not what it looks like. Henry screams that it looks like soft porn. Why can't Brad go impregnate another woman? He throws Brad out, and tells him to tell Bubbles to forget it. There will be no babies between Brad and Vienna. Katie calls and tells Brad to come home; she has good news. Brad has to let her down that he messed things up. Katie thinks she convinced Henry, but Brad says no he's changed his mind and is now against it. Vienna does some fast talking and manages to soften Henry a bit. She doesn't know how he could be so suspicious of his .. their . best friend, Brad. She only wants to have a baby for him, not with him. They show up unexpectedly at Brad and Katie's. Henry stammers but apologizes for losing his temper earlier and being so suspicious. He concedes that he loves and trusts Vienna and thinks this baby thing is a good idea. Vienna says they need to get started right now."

        "Henry: It's your best friend, the big jerk. Should I say ex-best friend?",
        "Katie: No. Don't be silly. Come on in. Oh, these are beautiful.",
        "Henry: That's a peace offering.",
        "Katie: For what?",
        "Henry: Well -- I acted like a real heel the other day. And I -- it's just the idea of Vienna getting, um --",
        "Katie: Artificially inseminated?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, I can't even say it. I can't even think about it.",
        "Katie: Well, it's not your everyday situation.",
        "Henry: No, it's not. The idea of Vienna having Brad's baby -- carrying it for you. It was a bit much for my brain to absorb.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know, you were kind of freaked.",
        "Henry: I know, I'm sorry about that. Look, I need to tell you something. You, come here. You stole my heart, all those many years ago, and you've held onto it ever since. And there's almost nothing I wouldn't do for you.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Oh Henry, I am so glad you changed your mind.",
        "Henry: Changed my --? Katie, what are you kidding? No, no, not in a million years!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Mmm, Vienna. These eggs, they look perfect.",
        "Vienna: Oh, don't even say the word.",
        "Brad: Eggs?",
        "Vienna: Well, mine are perfect, too. But they're going to waste.",
        "Brad: Don't beat yourself up, you know? I mean, you did a wonderful thing offering to help Katie and I have a baby. But Henry, he's got a right to weigh in on this, too.",
        "Vienna: No, he's being impossible.",
        "Brad: Well, that's too bad.",
        "Vienna: I've tried every trick in the book. I've even tried tricks that aren't in any books. But he refuses to budge!",
        "Brad: I understand. He's a guy. And from his point of view, no matter how many ways you slice it, you and I would still be having a baby. Together.",
        "Vienna: Well, he shouldn't be looking at it that way, at all. Especially when he knows that you and I wouldn't be having sex together.",
        "Brad: Of course not. That would be a deal-breaker.",
        "Vienna: Well, and this is not about Brad, the man and Vienna, the woman. This is about science. When I look at you, all I see is a big handsome hunk of DNA.",
        "Brad: Well, thank you. I'm sure your eggs are totally amazing, by the way.",
        "Vienna: Okay, Brad, please, I'm begging you, do not say the e-word because I can't stand to look at it, smell it, even, oh, think about it!",
        "Brad: That's my breakfast.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: What's the matter with you?",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry. I think I'm having mental morning sickness!",

        "Johnny: Hi, Lulu!",
        "Lucy: Hey, Baby, what's up? Good to see you.",
        "Craig: Well, I guess it's safe to say that Johnny enjoyed himself when you babysat him the other night.",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah, we had a great time. I really, really, appreciate you letting me spend time with him. Thank you.",
        "Craig: Well, uh, as it turns out, I have a business meeting this morning. Uh, I was going to bring Johnny, but I know he'd be bored stiff. So, if you'd like to entertain him, if you're not busy for a while?",
        "Lucy: I would love to!",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Lucy: You want that? Yeah.",
        "Craig: All right then, I guess it's unanimous.",
        "Lucy: Great. Hey, you better watch out or I'll start to think you really trust me.",
        "Craig: Don't count your chickens. I need a sitter and you're my best option.",
        "Lucy: Well, at least that's honest. I'm grateful for any time with Johnny. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Good morning.",
        "Paul: I really have to fire that maid.",
        "Emily: You know, you could at least pretend to be nice to me. I am the one helping you make Meg jealous, remember?",
        "Paul: We have a deal. It doesn't mean I have to suck up to you.",
        "Emily: Oh, yes it does. Yes it does. So tell me. Is our little subterfuge working?",
        "Paul: Subterfuge?",
        "Emily: Any frantic phone calls from Meg?",
        "Paul: No. She wouldn't. Even if she was jealous, she's wouldn't make the first move.",
        "Emily: Really?",
        "Paul: Mm-mnh.",
        "Emily: I thought you said she was -- I thought you said she was freaked out when she saw us canoodling at the Lakeview.",
        "Paul: Canoodling.",
        "Emily: Did we get a rise out of her, or not?",
        "Paul: Oh, yeah. From here on in, it's just a matter of time.",
        "Emily: Wow. You're like very positive right now. You taking your meds?",
        "Paul: Meds? It's a fait accompli.",
        "Emily: A fait accompli?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Emily: Wow -- so, you guys are like destined to be together, is that it?",
        "Paul: Yep, it's in the stars. We're a family, you know? When Eliza came along, it changed everything. And I think Meg, in her heart, knows that the three of us belong together forever.",
        "Emily: Wow, that's really nice. Really.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Emily: You know, if there's anything I can do to make that work, you just -- you say the word, okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah right. You're just trying to get another canoodle out of me.",
        "Emily: I got to admit, it's, um, it adds a little spice to my otherwise mundane life these days.",
        "Meg: Paul, are you home?",
        "Emily: Should we -- maybe she should catch us on the couch?",
        "Paul: Oh, stop, it's like way too overkill. Make yourself scarce.",
        "Emily: Okay. Where?",
        "Paul: Here. Come on.",
        "Emily: Why? Here?",
        "Meg: Hey. Hey.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Meg: You didn't hear me?",
        "Paul: No, I mean, I -- yeah, I thought I heard you say my name, I just figured I was dreaming. You need some coffee?",
        "Meg: Um, no, no, no. I can't stay long. I came over to apologize.",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: For what?",
        "Meg: Uh, well, I gave you a hard time when I saw you out with Emily. And that was not fair. Look, if you want to have a relationship with anyone, even Emily Stewart, I'm not going to stop you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You have a good time, big guy. Take good care of him.",
        "Lucy: I always do.",
        "Craig: This meeting shouldn't take more than a few hours. But I'll be in the dining room, if you need me.",
        "Lucy: Oh, we'll be fine. Johnny and I know how to have a good time, right?",
        "Craig: Make yourself comfortable in the suite. Order whatever room service you like. And I'll see you both later.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: Hey.",
        "Lucy: Dusty. Dusty, how long have you been here?",
        "Dusty: Long enough to know you got more time with Johnny.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I can hardly believe it myself. Total surprise.",
        "Dusty: You're doing well. Craig seems to trust you again.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I hope so. At least we got a few more hours with Johnny. Do you want to join us on our play date?",
        "Johnny: Please say yes.",
        "Dusty: Yes! I take orders from this guy.",
        "Lucy: All right, but we have to be careful. We probably shouldn't take the elevator together.",
        "Dusty: Okay. Why don't you guys go up now? And call me when the coast is clear.",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "Dusty: All right?",
        "Lucy: All right. Come on, Johnny. Let's go.",
        "Dusty: Hey.",
        "Lucy: We'll see Dusty in just a minute.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Lucy: Oh, you're welcome. You're going to have fun today!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I think maybe I'm the one who owes you an apology.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Paul: Well, um, Emily and I kind of forgot we were in public -- you have every right to be annoyed.",
        "Meg: No, I shouldn't have been annoyed. I mean, we're divorced, Paul. You can do whatever you want. See whoever you want.",
        "Paul: You think I want Emily?",
        "Meg: Well, your body language made that very clear.",
        "Paul: You were jealous?",
        "Meg: No. No, look, I thought about it, and I realized I shouldn't be. Not anymore. I mean, we're both free agents right now.",
        "Paul: Wait.",
        "Meg: We should move on with our lives.",
        "Paul: That -- no, we shouldn't. It's a huge mistake?",
        "Meg: No, it's not. It's not. I think it's the best thing for us, okay? So, you just take care of yourself.",
        "Paul: Meg.",
        "Meg: And good luck with Emily, okay?",
        "Paul: Hey, where are you going? Meg, Meg, hey! What was that?",
        "Emily: That was interesting.",
        "Paul: What just happened?",
        "Emily: I think it's simple. I think it's really simple. She just asked your permission to have sex with Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Uh, call me shallow, but I am having a hard time with the idea of Vienna and Brad making a baby together.",
        "Katie: You keep making it sound like they're going to have sex together! And that couldn't be farther from the truth. What's going to happen is going to happen in a test tube.",
        "Henry: Yeah, they're cells reproducing, their chromosomes co-mingling. I'm sorry, no, I can't help it. No.",
        "Katie: Yes, you can help it. You have a choice here. You can give into your childish emotions or you can be a mature adult.",
        "Henry: I have never tried to pass myself off as mature, and I'm not going to start right now. Look, all I can see is my Vienna, my sassy Swedish bombshell, with this baby growing inside of her voluptuous body.",
        "Katie: Are you worried that Vienna won't be sexy anymore?",
        "Henry: No. No, she couldn't stop being sexy if she tried.",
        "Katie: So what's the problem? The real problem.",
        "Henry: The real problem is that, if they make this new life together, there will be this lifelong connection between them. This unbreakable bond. This irrational intimacy. How can we live with that?",
        "Katie: Vienna loves you so much, Henry. She could have any man she wants, and she only wants you.",
        "Henry: Yes, after she cross-pollinates with Brad!",
        "Katie: I don't think we should worry about this baby being a threat. I think it could bring us all closer together.",
        "Henry: A little too close for comfort, I'm afraid.",
        "Katie: Doesn't it count for anything that Vienna really wants to do this?",
        "Henry: Well, Katie, what if she wants it too much, huh? What if she has the baby and wants to keep it? Have you thought about that?",
        "Katie: No, no, don't worry about that. Vienna only wants to do this for the joy of bringing a child into the world. That's it. She gets all of that bliss at no cost to you. You don't have to change a diaper. You don't have to be a father, you get to be a Godfather. And then, you get to be Vienna's hero because you made her happy.",
        "Henry: I know, that's what she keeps telling me.",
        "Katie: But we won't do this if you're not happy.",
        "Henry: Oh. Come on, you're killing me here, Bubbles. All right, all right, all right, all right. I'll think about it. Just give me some time, okay?",
        "Katie: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Henry: Hey, take it easy. I haven't said yes yet.",
        "Katie: I know, but you will. I'm know you will!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry about your breakfast, Brad.",
        "Brad: Are you okay?",
        "Vienna: Not really. I'm afraid I'm going to feel like this all morning.",
        "Brad: Vienna, I'd hate to break it to you, but there is no such thing as mental morning sickness. Maybe it's a stomach flu or something.",
        "Vienna: No, no, it's not.",
        "Brad: Wait a minute. Could you be, you know -- could you be pregnant?",
        "Vienna: No, no, that's impossible.",
        "Brad: Are you still poking holes in Henry's love gloves?",
        "Vienna: No. No, no. I've been taking a home pregnancy test every day, and it comes out negative. No, you know what? This is my mind begging me to get pregnant.",
        "Brad: So, if it's all in your mind, then tell it to go away.",
        "Vienna: Well, yeah, I've tried. And it doesn't work. And this feels like the real thing.",
        "Brad: Want me to call Henry?",
        "Vienna: No, no, I'm too mad at him for being so stubborn. Can you take me home, Brad? If I'm going to be sick like this all day, I'd rather put my head in my own toilet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What's this?",
        "Paul: The emergency contact number for my shrink at the psych ward. You need to call, you need help.",
        "Emily: I need help? I tell you something about Dusty and Meg, you don't want to hear, and I need a shrink? You need to go back to the shrink.",
        "Paul: Meg and Dusty are not hooking up.",
        "Emily: I was right here. I heard what she said to you. She wants you to move on, okay? So she can go ahead and move on with Dusty.",
        "Paul: How do you know? You're not Meg.",
        "Emily: No, I'm not. But Meg is a woman, she is like every other woman. She's a mother, she would like a man in her life. She has a young child to raise.",
        "Paul: My child.",
        "Emily: Do you think Dusty cares about that? This is what he does. To make up for losing Jennifer, he's got to play super hero to single mothers.",
        "Paul: Stop it. There is nothing serious going on between Meg and Dusty.",
        "Emily: Oh, good grief, you have suspected these two of having a secret relationship ever since Dusty came back into town. And now that she is free to do that, you're in total denial. What the hell is the matter with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, it must be my lucky day!",
        "Dusty: How's it going?",
        "Meg: Not bad.",
        "Dusty: What's up?",
        "Meg: Uh, I thought we should talk.",
        "Dusty: About what?",
        "Meg: Well, um, for one, that kiss the other day.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah. We should get our signals straight.",
        "Meg: I agree.",
        "Dusty: And be honest with each other.",
        "Meg: Totally.",
        "Dusty: Want me to go first?",
        "Meg: Sure.",
        "Dusty: It was a mistake. And, I won't put you in that position again.",
        "Meg: That's how you feel?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. How about you?",
        "Meg: Uh -- yeah -- I'm -- right there with you. I -- we agreed to be friends. And we made a deal, we should stick to it.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I don't want to lose you as a friend.",
        "Meg: Well, I'm glad we cleared the air.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, feels good, doesn't it?",
        "Meg: Yeah, you know what? I'm not working today. And my mother's taking care of Eliza. I'm free, if you want to hang out. As friends, I mean.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Dusty: I got to take this. Hey, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: We're all set. Come on up.",
        "Dusty: I'll be right there. Lucy's letting me spend some time with Johnny.",
        "Meg: Oh. Well, that's good. Where's Craig?",
        "Dusty: At a meeting. I'm taking advantage.",
        "Meg: Oh, of course.",
        "Dusty: I'll see you soon.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'll see you soon. Yeah, have fun with Lucy. Craig, wait. Don't go upstairs!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Great to see you too. What have you and your sister been up to?",
        "Lucy: Oh, we've been doing some serious drawing.",
        "Dusty: Wow, little Picasso over here. Hey, John, you think you can draw a picture of me?",
        "Lucy: Oh, this ought to be good. Take your time, Johnny. There's no hurry.",
        "Dusty: That's right. That's right. I'm an extremely patient supermodel. Go ahead.",
        "Lucy: Oh, God. Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?",
        "Dusty: Oh yeah, love the mirror, almost as much as I love having my portrait done by Johnny van Gogh. Today, painting. Tomorrow sculpting. I want you to put me on Mount Rushmore!",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Lucy: Yeah right!",
        "Dusty: Nice try.",
        "Lucy: Hey. Oh. Yeah!",
        "Dusty: Please, artists are trying to work here.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I had a meeting just cancelled, so I'd like to spend that time Johnny. You wouldn't want to keep me from that, would you?",
        "Meg: No, no, not at all. I -- just wanted to tell that I was happy for you -- for Johnny. That you have custody.",
        "Craig: Since when?",
        "Meg: Okay, maybe I wasn't happy at first, but it seems that things worked out for the better. After all, everybody says Johnny's very happy.",
        "Craig: He is. No, thanks to you. Was I supposed to forget that you and Dusty tried to get married to keep the judge from ruling in my favor?",
        "Meg: I am sorry we tried to keep Johnny away from you.",
        "Craig: Yeah, try that one again. This time, with feeling.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what, you won. You have your son. We all accept that now. I just wanted to tell you that you have my support -- for Johnny's sake.",
        "Craig: Where is this coming from, Meg? Did Dusty put you up to this?",
        "Meg: Of course not.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't buy it. You're up to something. What is it?",
        "Craig: You're trying to get on my good side. You're hoping to convince me to let Dusty spend more time with Johnny.",
        "Meg: And you know what, would it really be that bad? I can guarantee you it would be great for Johnny.",
        "Craig: Well, I can guarantee you that's not going to happen.",
        "Meg: The boy needs Dusty.",
        "Craig: I'm his father. Dusty never was and never will be.",
        "Meg: Craig is on his way up. Get out. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You saw Meg, all dressed up at the Lakeview waiting for Dusty. It was a date.",
        "Paul: He was a no-show, right? First of all, that's never going to win him any points with Meg. Why are you doing this? What, are you trying to make me crazy? What are you doing?",
        "Emily: I don't need to make you crazy, no. You do that all on your own.",
        "Paul: Wow, I thought you were my friend.",
        "Emily: I am your friend. That's why I'm trying to get you to open up your eyes.",
        "Paul: Well, that whole thing, that's kind of hurtful, you know? And it's like you're insulting me.",
        "Emily: Fine. You know what? You're on your own. Oh, God.",
        "Paul: Wait.",
        "Emily: And you know what? Good luck. Good luck getting Meg back. You find someone else to make her jealous and we'll see how far you get. You ungrateful --",
        "Paul: Stop! You're right. I need to figure out what's going on with Meg. And -- you're the only one who can help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey, what are you doing back so soon?",
        "Craig: My meeting was cancelled. Where are you two going?",

        "Brad: Yeah, sure, just say the word.",
