        "Bonnie: Mom?",
        "Jessica: Uh -- I'm coming. Sweetheart, just give me a minute. Here I am, here I am.",
        "Bonnie: Hi.",
        "Jessica: Hi.",
        "Bonnie: Hey. Are you okay?",
        "Jessica: I'm fine. I was just about to jump in the shower, so --",
        "Bonnie: What's all this?",
        "Jessica: The last of Marshall.",
        "Bonnie: He's leaving?",
        "Jessica: He's gone.",
        "Bonnie: Where?",
        "Jessica: Jail.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, not that this isn't good news. It is. It's just --",
        "Jessica: You know, I'm just -- I'm finished. I'm done taking care of Marshall Travers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: The D.A. is on her way. She should be here soon.",
        "Marshall: So will my new attorney. Would you be so kind as to allow Mr. Newman in when he arrives?",
        "Margo: Herbert Newman? Whew. He's never lost a case.",
        "Marshall: And he won't lose mine. I'll be out of here in an hour.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I believe these experiences have been beneficial in Alison's --",
        "Margo: Excuse me. Travers has hired Herbert Newman.",
        "Tom: Well, glad I don't have to prosecute him.",
        "Margo: I just hope that Evelyn's up to it. What's that?",
        "Hal: Oh, your husband coerced me into writing a letter on Alison's behalf.",
        "Tom: Who coerced you?",
        "Hal: My wife, my mother-in-law, their attorney.",
        "Tom: Very good.",
        "Margo: Good luck.",
        "Tom: Thanks.",
        "Emily: Hey, any word?",
        "Tom: We're working on it. Your husband has written a letter in support of Alison's release.",
        "Susan: Oh. Well, thank you. I -- I know that couldn't have been easy for you.",
        "Hal: I don't think jail's gonna teach Alison anything, although she does have a lot to learn.",
        "Emily: All right. Well, how's the court gonna respond? She's still a minor, Tom.",
        "Tom: Well, given her history --",
        "Susan: You've got to get her out! She's not gonna survive in jail.",
        "[Water dripping]",
        "Alison: Guard! Guard, guard, guard, guard, guard!",
        "Guard: Now what?!",
        "Alison: You've got to get me out of here. No, no, no, no, no, no, wait. My lawyer, Tom Hughes, and my sister and my Mom, they're talking to the D.A. I may already be free with bail and everything, only I don't know. So maybe if you could just check?",
        "Guard: Well, until they tell me different, you're gonna stay right here.",
        "Alison: Well, if I could just take a walk, or maybe I could just go up the squad room, and you could just handcuff me to a chair. I promise I won't say a word.",
        "Guard: No can do.",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no, no, wait, wait!",
        "Guard: Hey, hey, hey, pipe down, or I call Lieutenant Munson.",
        "Alison: mommy -- mommy, you've got to get me out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Where is my daughter?",
        "Rosanna: Lucy's fine.",
        "Craig: That's not what I asked.",
        "Rosanna: And here I thought she took after you. Must be Sierra's influence. You know, when I told her that you weren't coming home last night, she didn't even question it. She just trusted me.",
        "Craig: Okay, okay, so I upset you by working late with Carly. And now you want to upset me by squirreling away my daughter?",
        "Rosanna: Sure. Why not?",
        "Craig: Because after your little fit last night, I had no choice but to make do, whereas you chose to flout my wishes.",
        "Rosanna: Flout your wishes? Are you calling me a \"flouter,\" Craig?",
        "Craig: If Aaron Snyder tracks her down --",
        "Rosanna: And why would he? She's told him she doesn't want to see him anymore, hasn't she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Can we just stay out here a little longer? It's so nice. Thanks for taking me to see my baby cousin.",
        "Aaron: Oh, Natalie's great, isn't she?",
        "Lucy: And she knows you. I love that. You know, the way she looks at her big brother.",
        "Aaron: Oh, you've got to see her with her father.",
        "Lucy: Oh, you know, little girls and their daddies.",
        "Aaron: So you think we can do this again?",
        "Lucy: What, visit the baby?",
        "Aaron: No, just get off by ourselves. Take the car and drive down to the pond, maybe have a picnic. You know, it's getting a lot warmer these days.",
        "Lucy: I'd love that.",
        "Aaron: You think Rosanna would go for it?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. She just might.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Do I have to call her?",
        "Rosanna: Lucy? Well, you can if you like. I'm not sure she'll pick up.",
        "Craig: This is childish.",
        "Rosanna: What?",
        "Craig: Hiding my daughter from me.",
        "Rosanna: I never said I hid your daughter.",
        "Craig: Then where is she?",
        "Rosanna: The ladies room. Well, that's where I go when I'd like to escape an unpleasant situation. [Craig laughs] Or who knows? Maybe she's like her daddy after all, and she's gone to Carly's.",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. It's not you.",
        "Dusty: Well, I figured that much. Molly, I'm sorry. Is some -- you want to tell me what's wrong? You want me to push you into the Snyder pond again to get it out of you?",
        "Molly: This is gonna sound really weird, but --",
        "Dusty: You're expecting someone, huh?",
        "Molly: I -- I'm not the same person I was the other night. Um, I just went a few rounds with my ex, and I don't know, you know? I'm trying to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. Not that I don't appreciate you stopping by.",
        "Dusty: No, if I knew that you were in the middle of something with somebody --",
        "Molly: No, how could you have known that? Come on. I was so busy throwing myself at you.",
        "Dusty: And I was loving it, girl. I'm just -- [Dusty laughs] You see? You see the face? That's the real Molly I'm now seeing, and I like it. Let me order something to eat. You want to eat?",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "Molly: You're nuts. Food?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Molly: That's a concept.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I'm gonna feed you, and I'll tell you stories so we get you out of your mind and -- that's it. Then I'll leave, and you can get on with the rest of your life. What do you think?",
        "Molly: I'll eat. Let me just wash up first.",
        "Dusty: Okay. Yeah, I'd like to order a couple of your sandwiches, please. Pastrami.",
        "Molly: Grilled cheese.",
        "Dusty: Pastrami on rye and a grilled cheese. Thank you.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Carly: Oh. Is -- this is room 707?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Are you looking for someone?",
        "Carly: Mrs. McKinnon?",
        "Dusty: This is 707, but there's no Mrs. McKinnon here.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I must have heard the number wrong. Desk clerks.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. You want me to call the front desk for you?",
        "Carly: No, no. No, that's okay.",
        "Dusty: All right.",
        "Carly: I know that my -- my cousin checked into the Lakeview. I just have to find out where they put her is all. So -- thanks.",
        "Dusty: Good luck.",
        "Molly: Who was that?",
        "Dusty: Wrong room number.",
        "Molly: Some water.",
        "Dusty: Thank you. You okay?",
        "Molly: Um -- I will be. I'm sorry about this.",
        "Dusty: No, that's -- everybody goes through it, you know.",
        "Molly: I'm not used to letting it all hang out with somebody that I barely know.",
        "Dusty: Right. It's true. I've seen you on the news. And nothing really seems to faze you.",
        "Molly: Well, you see how true that is.",
        "Dusty: Right. And I would never want to order in food with that woman on the news. Because she doesn't look like much fun on a rainy day.",
        "Molly: Is it raining?",
        "Dusty: Actually, no. But even on a sunny day, I'm sure -- I'm sure that you and I are not going to be taking long strolls. I just sense it.",
        "Molly: Listen, it sounds really great, but I'm --",
        "Dusty: A mess.",
        "Molly: Nice! I'm so sorry.",
        "Dusty: I meant the rebound. I meant the rebound.",
        "Molly: Okay, that's a little better. But I'm an idiot. Hold on a second. Let me -- take off your shirt and I'll dry if for you. That's okay. It's just water.",
        "Molly: No. Take it off.",
        "Dusty: Is there an echo? I said it's water. It's fine. Okay. Hey, if you wanted me to take off my shirt, all you had to do is say please.",
        "Molly: You have absolutely no idea how handsome you are, do you?",
        "Dusty: Is that gonna be a problem for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: And here I thought you'd be pleased.",
        "Bonnie: I'm thrilled. I'm just a little surprised. Because at the party, you made it -- you seemed so determined to keep him here. It just --",
        "Jessica: Well, it wasn't about keeping Marshall here.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, Mom, you made it sound like the man would collapse without you.",
        "Jessica: Well, I was mistaken. And besides, what you said made perfect sense. I mean, Marshall -- his situation isn't gonna change anytime soon. And I need to get on with my life.",
        "Bonnie: So are you still going to represent him?",
        "Jessica: No. He's an attorney. He can find somebody else.",
        "Bonnie: And he's in jail?",
        "Jessica: Well, I presume so. Margo had him escorted out of here.",
        "Bonnie: You called the police?",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, I'm a -- I'm an officer of the court. I'm the former D.A. It was my obligation to notify the police if the situation changed -- if his living situation changed. So we should celebrate.",
        "Bonnie: What did he do to you, Mom?",
        "Jessica: Do to me? What, do you think he stole the silver?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know what to think. You call the police on a man you invited to stay with you in your house. You're double locking the doors. I don't know.",
        "Jessica: That's habit, honey. That's just habit.",
        "Bonnie: Not since I've known you.",
        "Jessica: Look, sweetheart -- sometimes you tell a person something and it takes a while to sink in, especially when they are as stubborn and hard-headed as your old mother here. So -- I finally saw the light. You were right. Marshall is not someone I want living in my home. End of story.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, except you called the police, Mom.",
        "Jessica: Well, I already explained that.",
        "Bonnie: Yes. Yes, you have. And quite frankly, it's not making much sense. You are the most deliberate woman I know, Mom. You don't make a move without scoping out every single possible outcome. So for you to do a 180 overnight, I'm sorry, just --",
        "Jessica: Now wait a minute! I thought that's what you wanted. I thought this is what you and Ben and Isaac wanted. You know, you didn't want Marshall staying here with me in the first place. Now he's gone. What is the problem?",
        "Bonnie: There is no problem, I guess. Mom? Mom -- Mom, what is it? Mom, what did he do to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Newman: Hello.",
        "Marshall: Mr. Newman. Thanks for stepping in on such short notice.",
        "Newman: Call me Herbert. And I was happy to oblige. I'm very fond of your father.",
        "Marshall: He spoke highly of you.",
        "Newman: Shall we? Now I read your case on the train from Chicago. The D.A. released you -- here we go -- into Jessica Griffin's custody.",
        "Marshall: Yes. She was kind enough to take me in. I was still recovering from surgery.",
        "Newman: And she was representing you.",
        "Marshall: At the time, yes.",
        "Newman: And now she's not representing you. And she doesn't want you in her home.",
        "Marshall: Ms. Griffin and I have a very complicated history. I replaced her as D.A. It was a difficult campaign. Later when I was shot, Ms. Griffin very kindly agreed to represent me and then allowed me to stay in her home until I'd recovered. As you can see, I'm fine. Now Jessica's change of heart isn't the issue. The D.A. wants to put me back in jail. I obviously want to go home.",
        "Newman: Have you ever fled the vicinity because of the charges against you?",
        "Marshall: No, of course not. I'm an attorney, and I was the D.A. in this town. I know the rules.",
        "Newman: And in this case, I think they'll work on your behalf.",
        "Marshall: Good. Because I've got dinner reservations at the Lakeview, and I do intend to keep them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evelyn: Emily, Susan, Hal -- and, Tom, this had better be good. I am due in court in an hour, and I just found out I'm going to be going up against a guy who thinks he's God's gift to the justice system.",
        "Tom: Yes, I don't envy you. But I did want to revisit Alison's bail situation. Hal has written a letter recommending that she be released in her mother's custody.",
        "Hal: I will vouch for Alison, make sure she makes her court appearances.",
        "Tom: And given her age, we thought it would be better for her to be at home, perhaps with a monitoring device.",
        "Evelyn: No. No way. Hal is related to the defendant.",
        "Emily: What? I'm sorry. You're saying he's biased?",
        "Hal: Emily --",
        "Emily: No, no. His son was injured in that fire. The fact that he would vouch for the girl who started it only suggests that he is very objective.",
        "Hal: Would you excuse us for a second, please? Why don't you just take Alison down what you brought her and let us try and work this out?",
        "Emily: That woman is not gonna budge.",
        "Hal: Hammering on her is not gonna help.",
        "Emily: All right. You're right. It just makes me so mad that she would dismiss your offer out of hand like that. All right. We're gonna go down and see Alison. Hal thinks that's best. All right. I will butt out.",
        "Susan: She's going to want to know when she can go home.",
        "Hal: You're just gonna have to tell her that we're working on it.",
        "Emily: We're working on it.",
        "Tom: Evelyn, I understand your position.",
        "Hal: Look, it was my kid that got hurt. But Alison has already admitted her guilt. She's made amends to Lucy Montgomery, to me and to my family. She is not gonna run. I personally guarantee it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Guard! Guard, guard, guard! Can somebody please tell me when I'm getting out of here? Please?",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Emily: Look what we brought you, honey. Some Mabel's red-hot hot dogs and French fries. Your favorite.",
        "Alison: Thanks. So, how's everything going? When am I getting out of here?",
        "Susan: Well, Tom and Hal are talking to the D.A. right now.",
        "Alison: So what does that mean? How long before I get out?",
        "Emily: Well, they're -- they're negotiating, sweetie. It may take a little while.",
        "Alison: Well, how long? One hour? Two hours? How long does it take to do a little bit of paperwork?",
        "Emily: Well, they have to agree first.",
        "Alison: What do you mean, agree?",
        "Susan: They have to work out the details, baby, that's all. It's gonna be fine.",
        "Alison: Great. Because I don't know how much more I can take of this. They put a prostitute in here. And the food? I swear it -- it tasted like old feet.",
        "Susan: Oh, honey. Listen, it won't be much longer. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Our first picnic? I want to be able to walk.",
        "Aaron: You'll walk.",
        "Lucy: Not just someday. Now. I want to walk down the street like a normal human being. I want to walk down the aisle when my dad marries Rosanna.",
        "Aaron: Lucy, you're gonna walk again. I guarantee it.",
        "Lucy: You guarantee it?",
        "Aaron: Absolutely. Come on. Let's go inside.",
        "Lucy: Not yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: For your information, I did not spend the night with Carly.",
        "Rosanna: Just a few luscious hours?",
        "Craig: Why do you have so little faith in my yen for you?",
        "Rosanna: You know, I'm going to make a call. When I get back, I'll answer that question. On second thought -- I thought you left your yen in San Francisco.",
        "Craig: Don't change the subject.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, you and Carly?",
        "Craig: No, Lucy and where you have stashed her, all right? Last chance, where is she? Okay. I'm gonna go find her.",
        "Rosanna: Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Marshall has done some rotten things to you. I mean, conspiring with Steinbeck to steal your job, showing Ben that videotape. But you still -- you took him in. So for you to throw him out --",
        "Jessica: What? There has to be some big cinematic moment? Honey, this is real life. It doesn't always happen that way. I'm just glad that I finally listened to my beautiful, intelligent daughter.",
        "Bonnie: So you just woke up this morning and changed your mind.",
        "Jessica: No, actually it was last night at the party. You know, Ben and I were having such a good time. And I thought it would be nice if he would stay here. But with Marshall here, it's just uncomfortable.",
        "Bonnie: So why didn't you go to Ben's house, Mom?",
        "Jessica: Because it stipulates that if Marshall is going to be here, then I have to be here.",
        "Bonnie: So why aren't you happy? He's gone. You're free. But you look like a woman who's been sentenced to 30 years without parole.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jessica: Yes.",
        "Margo: How are you doing?",
        "Jessica: I'm fine. I just got finished packing Marshall's stuff. I'll bring it by the police station.",
        "Margo: Well, Evelyn's here -- breathing fire. So I don't think Travers is going anywhere soon.",
        "Jessica: Good. I'll see you in a little bit. No, don't do that! Don't do that! Don't do that.",
        "Bonnie: What? Mom, I want to.",
        "Jessica: I'll do that. I'll do that. It's because of me this whole thing got started, with that videotape. And I just -- I want to be there when it ends. And whether you want to admit it or not, you're not very happy with that man. And I think you could use some support.",
        "Jessica: Come here. I love you.",
        "Bonnie: And I love you. So, come on, let's just get this over with.",
        "Jessica: No, no!",
        "Bonnie: Okay.",
        "Jessica: I'll do it.",
        "Bonnie: Okay.",
        "Jessica: I'll do it. It'll be my pleasure to drag this out of here. Would you grab my purse?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What was that?",
        "Rosanna: A kiss.",
        "Craig: To keep me from tracking down my daughter? You don't think I'm onto you? I am so onto you.",
        "Rosanna: No --",
        "Craig: Lucy \u0096",
        "Lucy: Aaron, I told you I didn't want to see you anymore. Why can't you just leave me alone?",
        "Aaron: But, Lucy -- you know how I feel about you.",
        "Craig: I thought we agreed that you would respect my daughter's privacy.",
        "Lucy: It's okay, daddy.",
        "Craig: No. Lucy, it isn't. You asked Aaron to leave you alone, and here he is bothering you.",
        "Aaron: We were just talking.",
        "Craig: And you weren't listening. Stay away from my daughter. Clear?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hey. Put this on, please? Because if I'm having a hard time resisting your face -- and I am -- looking at that's just not gonna help.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yes, what can I say? I'm so irresistible.",
        "Molly: Yes, you are.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Dusty: I have never wanted a pastrami sandwich less.",

        "Molly: Carly.",
        "Carly: Is this a bad time?",
        "Carly: Hello, again.",
        "Dusty: I suppose you two know each other.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I -- I am Mrs. McKinnon's cousin. Your boyfriend here did a good job of lying for you, but you might have known I'd come back.",
        "Molly: That was Carly here before?",
        "Dusty: Who's Mrs. McKinnon?",
        "Molly: Uh, that would be me.",
        "Dusty: Oh.",
        "Molly: That was my married name.",
        "Dusty: Sorry. I know her as Molly, so --",
        "Carly: That's sweet.",
        "Molly: What do you want?",
        "Carly: I'd like to talk with you before you do something you'll regret.",
        "Dusty: Oh, feel free to join us, because we were just --",
        "Carly: You know, I don't think that I really need to know what you and Molly were \"just.\"",
        "Dusty: I'll catch you later.",
        "Molly: Yeah, can you --",
        "Dusty: What? Button up?",
        "Carly: Whoo. You don't waste any time.",
        "Molly: That was the night porter, Carly. So what of it? The pool boy's coming over next. I've got the gardener on deck for dessert, so make it snappy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Evelyn: Hal, it's not that I don't trust you, but the girl is a known flight risk. And you of all people should be hyper aware of that. So unless there's some medical reason why she can't remain in lock-up, she stays in jail until trial.",
        "Hal: Now what?",
        "Tom: I think we break the news to Alison and revisit this issue week by week.",
        "Hal: Tom, can't we put her into some sort of a juvenile facility? The kid has got to go to school.",
        "Tom: I've already drafted that argument, Hal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Ah, this is the prisoner's personal effects?",
        "Jessica: Everything he left at my place.",
        "Margo: Smith, you want to take this to Mr. Travers and have him sign for it?",
        "Jessica: Has he been processed?",
        "Margo: Not yet. Are you okay?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Bonnie: Mom, he'll be in a cell before you know it, okay?",
        "Bonnie: Whoa, your hands are ice cold.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Will somebody please tell me what's really going on?",
        "Tom: Emily, Susan.",
        "Emily: Hey.",
        "Susan: Tom, what did she say? Did you convince her?",
        "Tom: Evelyn is not willing to deal. That does not mean that the judge won't be amenable.",
        "Alison: What does that mean? Do I have to stay here?",
        "Hal: The D.A. is going by the book on this one.",
        "Susan: But what does that mean?",
        "Tom: Well, barring a medical mishap, the defendant stays in custody until sentencing.",
        "Emily: Oh, God.",
        "Alison: \"A medical mishap\"? I have to die before they let me get out of here?",
        "Emily: No, sweetie. Listen to me. That just means that if you get sick or something, they'll take you to the hospital.",
        "Susan: What is the likelihood of the judge disagreeing with Evelyn's recommendation?",
        "Tom: Well, it's not likely, but it could happen. I mean, Alison is a minor.",
        "Susan: She's being tried as an adult.",
        "Tom: And we will keep trying.",
        "Hal: I'll look in on you later, Alison. In the meantime, if you need me just talk to the guard. Okay?",
        "Emily: Bye.",
        "Tom: I'm sorry.",
        "Susan: Don't worry, honey. We're gonna fix it.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Susan: I don't know, but we're gonna fix it. We will.",
        "Alison: I'm gonna be stuck here for the rest of my life.",
        "Emily: No, honey, you won't.",
        "Alison: I can't stay here. I know I'll just die. I can't stay here.",
        "Susan: No.",

        "Aaron: You asked me to help her.",
        "Craig: That was before you broke her heart. Say good-bye, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Take care of yourself, Lucy.",
        "Craig: You all right, sweetness?",
        "Lucy: I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Craig: Where were you?",
        "Lucy: I was window shopping. Is Rosanna still in there?",
        "Craig: Yes, Rosanna's still here.",
        "Rosanna: Did you have fun?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it was great. You know that new store on the corner?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes. The one with all the funny little hats in the window.",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Craig: You went window shopping in a wheelchair? Do you have any idea the risk you were running? You're a sitting duck in that chair.",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah. Quack, quack.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. It's not funny. You could have been kidnapped or mugged or molested, rolled away.",
        "Rosanna: Don't be ridiculous. In broad daylight in downtown Oakdale?",
        "Craig: Hey, Aaron Snyder found her. If I hadn't stepped in --",
        "Lucy: Then I would have asked him to leave. Daddy, you have to calm down. There are a lot worse things than a five-minute conversation with Aaron Snyder.",
        "Craig: You had a conversation with him?",
        "Lucy: He asked me how I was. I told him.",
        "Craig: This is your idea of supervision?",
        "Lucy: Daddy, I don't need to be supervised.",
        "Craig: All right, that's it. From now on, wherever you go, you go with Gloria.",
        "Lucy: Gloria is great -- for rehab. When it comes to shopping, I pick Rosanna. And none of this is her fault. It was all my idea. I just told her I needed to get out of the house, and it's a nice day. I wanted to take a roll down the block. I'm fine. Really.",
        "Craig: All right. So you won't object to being on time for your next physical therapy appointment?",
        "Lucy: Let's go.",
        "Craig: I'll see you at home.",
        "Rosanna: If you're lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I'll come visit you twice a day.",
        "Alison: What good will that do? I'm in a cage. Everyone here hates me. It's my own fault!",
        "Susan: Honey, please, please. You're gonna make yourself sick.",
        "Alison: Good!",
        "Susan: Look, think about Aaron. He was in jail. He survived. You can, too.",
        "Alison: I don't want to talk anymore!",
        "Susan: Okay, well, then just have something to eat. You know you love Mabel's fries.",
        "Alison: I'm not hungry!",
        "Emily: All right. Let's just go. Okay, Mom? Let's just go.",
        "Susan: I don't want to leave her like this.",
        "Emily: Mom, she's got a lot to digest right now, all right? Let's just go. Ali, we're gonna go, all right? We'll be back to see you.",
        "Susan: We'll be back later.",
        "Emily: Come on. Let's just --",
        "Susan: I love you, Ali. Sweetie, it'll be okay.",
        "Alison: \"You're gonna make yourself sick.\" And if I'm sick -- they'll have to send me to the hospital. Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: All right, I'm gonna go find Gloria. And you, missy, stay put.",

        "Lucy: Aaron?",
        "Aaron: Did he buy it?",
        "Lucy: Totally.",
        "Aaron: Sweet. Hey, is Rosanna still on our side?",
        "Rosanna: Who's that?",
        "Lucy: Well, that sort of depends. Are you still willing to help me see Aaron?",
        "Rosanna: Count on it.",
        "Lucy: She'll help us.",

        "Rosanna: Too bad.",
        "Craig: Oh, okay, you smile at Lucy, snarl at me?",
        "Rosanna: Lucy didn't spend the night with Carly.",
        "Craig: Neither did I.",
        "Rosanna: So where were you?",
        "Craig: I was camped out on a couch at the Lakeview. Satisfied?",
        "Rosanna: This is not me being petty, for your information. Carly divorcing Jack means a needy Carly on the make.",
        "Craig: I don't want Carly.",
        "Rosanna: Well, maybe she wants you.",
        "Craig: No, actually, that is not what Carly wants. I don't know if there's a good time to bring this up, but --",
        "Rosanna: Oh, for God's sake, just spit it out.",
        "Craig: Carly wants money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: That was the night porter? In a $200 shirt?",
        "Molly: You do know your fashion.",
        "Carly: What are you doing, Molly?",
        "Molly: I don't recall asking you for your approval. You certainly didn't ask me for mine.",
        "Carly: You're right. I didn't. I did something really bad to you. I was stupid and selfish, and I hurt everybody I love, but that is not a reason for you to trash your whole life.",
        "Molly: Oh, is that what I'm doing?",
        "Carly: Mike wants you back.",
        "Molly: And how sweet of you to say so.",
        "Carly: It's the truth.",
        "Molly: And how do you propose we arrange that, Carly? You and Parker and the baby in one room and Mike and me in the next room? 'Cause it's getting awfully crowded at the sink in the morning.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, Molly. But unlike you, I don't have the cash to check into the Lakeview when I'm between addresses. I needed some place to go until I got myself together, and Mike was kind enough to offer his place.",
        "Molly: He's a peach.",
        "Carly: You're mad at me. That's fine. I understand that. But Mike really loves you, Molly.",
        "Molly: You know one of the hardest things about growing up? You realize that love isn't half as powerful as you thought it was, because it doesn't keep people from dying or betraying you. And it can't even keep two people together when there's so much to keep 'em apart.",
        "Carly: The only thing keeping you two apart is anger over something that is over.",
        "Molly: \"Over\"? Are you out of your mind, Carly? The last sonogram shows that baby girl Snyder is well on her way. And I know that daddy intends to be there when she arrives.",
        "Carly: It's not perfect. But would you really want to be with a man who would abandon his own kid?",
        "Molly: And would you want a man that's having a kid with somebody else?",
        "Carly: Well, that hurts. I know that hurts, because it hurt me when Julia showed up with J. J. But Jack and I got through it, because we stuck together.",
        "Molly: Yeah, long enough for you to hurt him again.",
        "Carly: Would like to hit me? Would that make you feel better? Then you should -- you should hit me. Yell and scream, do whatever you need to do. But stop being so down on everything, because you can find a way out of this.",
        "Molly: You think so?",
        "Carly: Or would you like to just stay where you are? Miserable, angry and alone? Okay, what if I borrowed some money from Monte Carlo, just enough for a down payment for a house for me and the kids? If Mike is the father of this baby, then he can visit her at that house. And if not, well, he can go on his merry way. But either way, you and Mike go back together.",
        "Molly: What if that's not what I want?",
        "Carly: Oh, stop it. You love him.",
        "Molly: You know, Carly, I said it before, love --",
        "Carly: -- Is all we've got. And if you don't grab onto it with both hands, Molly, you are a fool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: If I'm sick, they can't keep me here. If they want a medical reason, I'll give 'em one. Oh, guard! Guard, help me! [Groaning] I'm gonna throw up! Guard, help!",
        "[Moaning]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Carly asked you for money?",
        "Craig: For an advance on her salary. A very large advance, to be precise.",
        "Rosanna: So help me, if you gave her Monte Carlo money --",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no, of course not --",
        "Rosanna: So you weren't in the offices last night breaking into the safe?",
        "Craig: No. That is company money. I'm just the messenger.",
        "Rosanna: Do you know how much money I've offered her over the years? Millions. And she's turned me down. Worse, she's made me feel disgusting for it. If Carly wants my money, she can damn well ask me for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Let me get this straight -- if I don't take your offer, I'm a fool?",
        "Carly: Would you stop making this about me? The only reason I am at the lake house is -- it's a temporary situation until I find --",
        "Molly: Something better! Yes, I know, Carly.",
        "Carly: I will move out of there just as soon as I can. And then you can move back in. Or not. Mike can move in here.",
        "Molly: And what if that's not what I want? You know, the night porter might not like that.",
        "Carly: You are not seriously considering taking up with somebody else?",
        "Molly: It seems a hell of a lot simpler than picking through your leavings.",
        "Carly: Well, that's gross. I don't care how mad you are at me. You don't talk about somebody else like that.",
        "Molly: Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I've offended you?",
        "Carly: Yeah, you did. And you insulted Mike.",
        "Molly: Oh, now you're defending Mike. That's great.",
        "Carly: You know what, Molly? You need help. I saw this after Jake died -- how you couldn't cope with your feelings, how you shut down completely and lashed out at everybody. Well, this is the same thing. You're hateful, and you're only hurting yourself.",
        "Molly: And you wonder why I'm looking for somebody new. Because he thinks I'm terrific.",
        "Carly: He doesn't know you.",
        "Molly: He will.",
        "Carly: You're gonna do it.",
        "Molly: Watch me.",
        "Carly: And what should I tell Mike?",
        "Molly: The truth, Carly, if you're capable of it. Oh, God. Mike, what have I done?",

        "Margo: The receipt for the bag, its contents. Travers signed it, there should be no problem.",
