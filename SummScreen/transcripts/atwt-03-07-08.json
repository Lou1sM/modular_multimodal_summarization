        "Casey: I know I messed up, Mom. I'm sorry. I don't blame you for being mad.",
        "Margo: Mad, no. Amazed, yes. You just got out of prison. You're on probation. A parking ticket would've be bad, but assaulting a federal officer? What were -- were you thinking?",
        "Casey: No, I wasn't. I don't even know who that guy was, and yes, yes, you're right, it's no excuse. But, these two guys came into Yo's and just tried to arrest this sweet, innocent girl, and I went ballistic. Just throwing punches, you know? I was out of control.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. I'm not going to lecture you because you're grown-up now. And I think you feel as bad about it as I do.",
        "Casey: No, worse. I can't go back to jail, Mom.",
        "Tom: Well, lucky for you, you're not going to have to. All the charges have been dropped.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Hey.",
        "Alison: Any news about Casey?",
        "Matt: No, none so far. But Tom and Margo just went down to the station. So with Margo being the chief of detectives, and Tom being a former D.A., you can bet they'll have the situation under control in no time.",
        "Alison: I wouldn't be so sure about that. Casey assaulted a federal officer.",
        "Matt: Ali, cool it. It's over. It's done.",
        "Alison: How can you be so sure about that? You just said you haven't heard anything. Oh, I get it, Tom and Margo aren't fixing this, it was you and that phone call you made last night -- telling whoever to make this whole thing go away. Tell me the truth, Matt. How did you pull that off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aide: You've got visitors.",
        "Ameera: Thank you so much for coming.",
        "Noah: We wanted to get here as soon as possible. Have they been treating you okay?",
        "Ameera: Yes, but I still don't know why I'm here. You have to believe, I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Noah: We believe you, Ameera, we all do.",
        "Luke: And we want to help.",
        "Ameera: You're all very kind.",
        "Lily: We just want to clear this up so you can go home.",
        "H.S. Officer #1: Good morning. I'm Federal Agent Frey. I believe I spoke with some of you last night. What's your relationship to Ameera?",
        "Holden: My name is Holden Snyder. Ameera has been staying with us in Luther's Corners. This is my wife, Lily, my son, Luke, Noah, Ameera's friend. We're here to find out why she's being held and to see what we can do to have her released.",
        "H.S. Officer #1: All I can say is, I'm very sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, I searched the whole neighborhood. Thought now that it was light out, I might find some clues.",
        "Carly: Did you?",
        "Jack: No. Nothing. Except I know that I'm positive that that is the real Cowboy Jack out of the trunk of my car, not one of the copies from that scenery place in Chicago.",
        "Carly: Well, I think we both know that it was Kit who took it from your car and brought it in here.",
        "Jack: What I don't understand is, after Kit tried to kill you in Chicago, why just plop Cowboy Jack here on the couch and walk out? Obviously, she was smart enough to get past the cop watching our house. She could have done considerably more damage to you and Parker. But she didn't, she just left.",
        "Carly: Right. Well, I think that Kit has a much more creepy plan in mind, Jack. Frankly, it scares the hell out of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "H.S. Officer #1: Apparently, when Ameera applied for her student visa, the system registered some faulty information connecting Ameera with a well-known terrorist.",
        "Ameera: I don't know any terrorists!",
        "Lily: Just let him finish, Ameera.",
        "H.S. Officer #1: After we questioned Ameera and she told us about her relationship to Colonel Mayer, we conducted a thorough background check which confirmed that she was telling the truth.",
        "Noah: Who would have thought my father's name would be a help?",
        "Holden: Now that the misunderstanding has been resolved, is she free to go?",
        "Lily: Can we take her home? H.S. Officer #1 not yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What scares me is how Kit comes and goes from this house as if you're not under 24 hour surveillance. How'd she pull that off?",
        "Carly: Well, to be honest, Jack, it wasn't very difficult for me to give the slip to the cop who was supposed to be watching me.",
        "Jack: I think it's time I give Margo a call.",
        "Carly: Well, just wait. Maybe that's not such a good idea.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Carly: Initially, we didn't want police protection at all, right? It doesn't seem to be doing us very much good. Maybe we should go back to plan \"A.\"",
        "Jack: Which is?",
        "Carly: It's obvious that everything Kit is doing is directed right at me. So, why not let her think that she can actually get to me? Sort of use me as bait, you know? It almost worked before.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it almost got you killed before.",
        "Carly: Hey Jack, we have to try it again. It's the only way we can save Parker.",
        "Jack: I don't want you putting your life in danger. What we need to do is find out what Kit is planning.",
        "Parker: What are you guys talking about?",
        "Carly: Just all the fun things that we're going to do together as a family when this craziness is over.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right.",
        "Jack: Come on, let's get you to school.",
        "Parker: Do I have to go?",
        "Jack: It's probably the safest place for you right now.",
        "Carly: I'll head out with you.",
        "Jack: Where are you going?",
        "Carly: The supermarket.",
        "Jack: Carly, I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Carly: You don't want to be holed up here without any food, do you?",
        "Jack: I'm trying to keep you safe here. I don't want you taking any unnecessary risks.",
        "Parker: You do have a knack for finding trouble, Mom.",
        "Carly: Okay, why don't you guys just stop ganging up on me? Because I'm telling you, the risk of the two of you starving to death here is much greater than the risk of anything happening to me at the mall.",
        "Jack: Okay, fine. Go, go shopping. But be careful. After I drop Parker off, I'll swing by and see if Margo has any more info on Kit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I don't understand. If Ameera is not a security risk, why can't we take her home?",
        "H.S. Officer #1: We ran a check on Ameera's visa using the homeland security data base. Her I.N.S. records show that her visa has expired, which means Ameera is here illegally. I'm afraid she's going to have to leave the country right away.",
        "Noah: Why? Can't her visa be extended? You just said you took her into custody and it was a mistake. I mean, why should she have to suffer for it?",
        "Holden: We would certainly be willing to sponsor her. She just got admitted to Oakdale U. can't you give her a break?",
        "H.S. Officer #1: In order to stay, she would need a valid student visa. The only way she can do that right now, is to go back to Iraq and reapply.",
        "Ameera: But that could take months, and there are no guarantees --",
        "H.S. Officer #1: She'd have to wait in line just like everybody else.",
        "Noah: I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but Iraq is kind of a dangerous place right now. She could be killed while waiting for her visa to be approved. Sending her back there could be like giving her a death sentence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: I don't know what you're talking about. What phone call?",
        "Alison: Don't try to play me, Matt. I saw you talking on your cell at the station last night. And I know you were calling someone about Casey.",
        "Matt: Oh, that's not what you think it is.",
        "Alison: How could you be associated with people who are so powerful, they can get criminal charges disappear after one phone call?",
        "Matt: All right, you got me. I was trying to do Casey a favor. He's my friend, and I wanted to help him.",
        "Alison: So you made a phone call and you got the charges dropped? Well, that's impressive. Who is this person you called?",
        "Matt: He's -- look, he's this government guy, all right, that I met before I went to prison.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Matt: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Well, tell me, what did you have to do for this government guy that he was so willing to do this huge favor for you?",
        "Matt: Nothing. He just happens to be a nice guy, who thought that it was wrong that someone who just got out of prison should have to go back, all because of a misunderstanding.",
        "Alison: Just a nice guy. I don't believe you, Matt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Aren't you lucky to be the son of a brilliant lawyer who can make criminal charges disappear?",
        "Casey: Yes, I am. Thanks, Dad.",
        "Margo: How'd you make those criminal charges disappear?",
        "Tom: Actually, I didn't do anything. I showed up at the courthouse to check about the case against Casey, and the judge informs me that due to some bureaucratic error, all the charges had been dropped. End of story.",
        "Margo: How does that happen?",
        "Tom: I don't know.",
        "Casey: I assaulted a federal agent and the charges are dropped?",
        "Tom: I don't know what to say to you about that, Pal. But if I had to guess, I would say that, for some reason unbeknownst to us, the government wanted this whole incident to go away.",
        "Casey: But why?",
        "Tom: Well, let's not look a gift horse in the mouth and just be happy that you're free to go. Right, Margo?",
        "Margo: Right. Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Let's not think the worst. Let's try to come up with a solution. Mr. Frey, is there any way that we can keep Ameera in the country?",
        "H.S. Officer #1: That depends. Does Ameera have any blood relatives who are U.S. citizens who could sponsor her?",
        "Ameera: No, I don't. I was raised by my mother and she died last year in Iraq. That's why I came to America, to see if Colonel Mayer could help me.",
        "Holden: Lily and I are willing to sponsor her.",
        "Lily: Just tell us what we need to do.",
        "H.S. Officer #1: To be a sponsor, a person must be a parent, a child or a spouse. Otherwise, I'm afraid there's little hope of Ameera being granted permission to stay.",
        "Holden: So what happens now?",
        "H.S. Officer #1: You can take Ameera home. She'll have a few days to put her personal affairs together. And then we'll escort her to a military transport plane that will take her back to Iraq.",
        "Noah: No, you can't do that. That's not fair!",
        "Luke: He's right. You can't do this to her.",
        "Holden: All right, Guys. Let's head back to the farm, we'll take Ameera with us, we'll figure out what we're going to do next.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack, what's up?",
        "Jack: I just wanted to let you know, Parker's safe at school. I asked the principal to have his teachers keep an eye on him. Where are you?",
        "Carly: I just finished the grocery shopping. I got all of Parker's favorite foods, yours, too. I'm just, I'm at the car now.",
        "Jack: See anything suspicious?",
        "Carly: No, no. There's nothing out of the ordinary. There's nothing to worry about, Jack.",
        "Jack: Can you see your police guard?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. He's right over there.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Carly: Well, I'll stay on the phone while I load up the car, if that makes you feel better, okay?",
        "Jack: It does, thanks.",
        "Carly: All right then. I'm all set. I'm on my way back, okay?",
        "Jack: Okay. I'll see you soon. Drive safe.",
        "Jack: I doubt you'll find any suspicious prints, but it's worth a shot, right? Any idea how this thing got in there?",
        "Carly: No. All I know is that that dummy was not in my car when I went into the grocery store and it was there when I came out.",
        "Jack: Tell me something, Joe, how could you miss someone putting a dummy like this in the backseat of Carly's car while you were watching it?",
        "Plainclothes cop: When she went in the store, I grabbed a soda.",
        "Jack: You grabbed a soda? Tell me something, what is the point of having a police guard if the criminals are right under your nose and you don't see them? I'm calling off the surveillance.",
        "Plainclothes cop: Hey, it's the chief's call. You gotta to take it up with her.",
        "Jack: Don't worry, I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: I don't get it. Why do you care so much about who I know? I have a friend who helped Casey dodge a bullet. And that's a good thing, right?",
        "Alison: Of course, it is. But this isn't about Casey, it's about you and your secrets. It's always been a problem for me, just more now because I'm actually starting to like you.",
        "Matt: Well, I'm glad to hear that. But look, it's exactly what I said before, I've done some things in my past that I'm not proud of. And yeah, maybe I try to hide them more than I should but, I'm human, right?",
        "Alison: I get that, but how am I supposed to get to know the real you if you hide who you are? I know that you're an ex-con, and that you were in jail with Casey. But -- so how can you have these contacts in the government who can make a bunch of federal charges just disappear? It doesn't make any sense. And when I ask you about it, you just give me vague explanations.",
        "Matt: Alison, look, I've paid my debt to society, okay? I want to put that behind me and move on. I thought you of all people would understand that.",
        "Alison: I do, but my life is an open book. You know the real me. I don't feel like I know the real you. And God, if we cannot be honest and upfront with this about each other, then we should just quit this thing while we're ahead.",
        "Matt: All I tried to do was do a good deed for a friend. I don't even know if it worked out. I don't see why this is such a big deal.",
        "Margo: Hey, Casey's out, he's free.",
        "Matt: Hey, Casey, good going, man!",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Alison: So the judge dropped all the charges?",
        "Tom: Never even had to plead the case.",
        "Margo: We're not sure why, but we're mighty glad he did.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe you should ask Matt what happened, since he's the one who made the deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: I can't go back to Iraq. You don't know what it's like there. I'll never survive.",
        "Lily: We will not give up, Ameera.",
        "Holden: We need to find an experienced immigration lawyer. Maybe Tom can help us.",
        "Luke: Mom, Dad, thank you so much for your help.",
        "Ameera: Yes, thank you. I don't know what I would have done without you today.",
        "Noah: Don't worry, we won't let anything bad happen to you.",
        "Holden: We're going to do everything we can to help you out. But, I have to say, Ameera, I don't want to give you false hope. The man from homeland security said that you need a U.S. citizen who is a blood relative, or else your options are very limited. There may not be much we can do.",
        "Lily: Ameera, I don't think you slept a wink last night. Why don't you go lie down?",
        "Ameera: Thank you, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Noah: Luke, can I talk to you?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah, of course. What a mess.",
        "Noah: It's just not fair! And dangerous -- I mean, you heard her. If she goes back there, she's got nowhere to live. No way to survive.",
        "Luke: I know. I know, it's terrible. I wish there was something that we could do.",
        "Noah: I think I know exactly what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: What do you mean Matt got the charges to go away?",
        "Alison: All I know is, he made a phone call and Casey's a free man. Right, Matt?",
        "Matt: I'm sorry, Alison has an overactive imagination. I called somebody, but umm -- I don't know if it did any good. Casey could have gotten off for any number of reasons, right?",
        "Tom: Who was it that you called exactly?",
        "Matt: Look, I would really like to tell you, Mr. Hughes. But he said I wasn't allowed to name names. It's just somebody that I knew from a while back who I thought might have some influence. I mean, Casey's been so good to me, I just wanted to return the favor.",
        "Alison: Why aren't you telling them what you told me?",
        "Matt: 'Cause it's not important.",
        "Alison: Matt said he has some contact in the government. Some guy he met before he went to prison.",
        "Margo: You were in prison?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Where are you going with this, Noah?",
        "Noah: The whole reason Ameera's here is because of my father.",
        "Luke: Yeah, so?",
        "Noah: Okay, I know it's hard to wrap your head around. It's not like I feel like I owe him a damn thing.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well you got that right.",
        "Noah: Especially after the way he treated us. But it's like, if Ameera goes back, it's like destroying a whole other life. He made her these promises that he never kept, and she's in all of this danger because of him.",
        "Luke: So you feel like, what? You have to keep your father's promises?",
        "Noah: She's a human being. I can't live with myself if I let her get sent back there.",
        "Luke: Noah, what -- what are you saying? What are you going to do?",
        "Noah: If I marry Ameera, she can stay in the country, keep going to school. You know, have a life for herself here. Make a future.",
        "Luke: You want to marry Ameera?",
        "Noah: No, I don't want to. But right now, it's the only option.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, can I ask you something? Is this a marriage in name only, or do you have other things in mind?",
        "Noah: Are you kidding me? I know you and I want to have a future together, I still want that. But this is totally different.",
        "Luke: Noah, you're talking about marrying someone else, a woman you barely even know.",
        "Noah: So she can get a visa.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and is that all?",
        "Noah: Of course. How could you ask that?",
        "Luke: I have to ask it. And you need to tell me the truth. Just how far are you willing to take this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Is this true?",
        "Margo: You were in prison?",
        "Matt: Yeah. Umm -- Casey and I -- we were cellmates actually in Statesville. And we didn't meet at Oakdale U. I was never a student there. I'm just an ex- con.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Margo: I have to take this, but we are not done. Not by a long shot. Jack, this is not a good time. What's going on?",
        "Jack: I want the tail taken off Carly.",
        "Margo: Why would you want to do that?",
        "Jack: Because it's useless, Margo. It's -- while he was supposed to be watching Carly, Kit managed to put that Cowboy Jack dummy in the back seat of her car.",
        "Margo: Wait, listen, I don't understand. If Kit is still stalking Carly, why wouldn't you want her under police protection?",
        "Jack: Carly wants to make herself a target so we can lure Kit out in the open.",
        "Margo: No, that's not a good idea.",
        "Jack: I don't like it any more than you do. But it may be the only way to get Kit into a position where she'll confess to killing Sam. At which point, I can arrest her.",
        "Margo: You can't arrest her, you're not on the force anymore, remember?",
        "Jack: In that case, I withdraw my resignation.",
        "Margo: Fine, you're back on the force. Great, set the trap. And be careful.",
        "Jack: I will.",
        "Margo: Can I talk to the officer that I put on Carly?",
        "Jack: The chief wants to talk to you.",
        "Plainclothes cop: Yeah, Chief.",
        "Margo: Joe, I want you to pretend you're going off duty, but stick with them. You got it?",
        "Plainclothes cop: Got it. See you later.",
        "Jack: No hard feeling, Joe. Thanks, Margo. Yeah, I'll see you later at the station.",
        "Carly: So what do we do now?",
        "Jack: I wish I knew. Hard to set a trap when you don't know where your prey is hiding.",
        "Carly: Don't forget the bag on the porch.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I got it. Hey, Joe, come here. Hey man, what part of we don't need your tail anymore don't you understand?",
        "Plainclothes cop: Sorry, Jack, I can't disobey the orders of the chief.",
        "Jack: Margo told you -- it's cool. I'll take care of it. Thanks, sorry I --",
        "Carly: What was that all about?",
        "Jack: Well, apparently, Margo didn't want to deal with me directly, so she blew me off.",
        "Carly: About what?",
        "Jack: She agreed with everything I said this morning, and then she went behind my back and told Joe to keep tailing you. He's out there, he's not going anywhere!",
        "Carly: Then how are we going to smoke out Kit?",
        "Jack: Damned if I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: How do you expect us to trust you when you lied about this? How could you not tell us Matt was an ex-con? Does your probation officer know anything about this?",
        "Casey: Yes.",
        "Margo: But you didn't tell us, Casey. How could you?",
        "Matt: This is not Casey's fault, okay? I'm the one that convinced him to lie. I saw what a great, supportive family you guys were -- you've both been really good to me, you welcomed me into your home, you helped me get that job. I just -- I couldn't help myself, I wanted to be a part of this.",
        "Margo: Well, lying to us is not the best way to ingratiate yourself into our family.",
        "Matt: I know, Mrs. Hughes, but honestly, if I told you that Casey and I were cellmates, would you have let me stay?",
        "Margo: No.",
        "Tom: The point here is, Casey should have known better.",
        "Matt: This is not Casey's fault. He felt obligated to me because I helped get him released from prison, okay? He owed me one, and I completely took advantage of him.",
        "Tom: And how the hell did you get Casey released from jail?",
        "Margo: Yeah, you're a prison inmate, and you get Casey help? What kind of people do you know that have that power, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So what do we do now?",
        "Jack: Well, we lose the tail, and then we figure out where Kit is hiding out.",
        "Carly: She seems to be everywhere, doesn't she?",
        "Jack: Yeah, and always one step ahead of us. Isn't this where the cereal's supposed to go?",
        "Carly: Not any more.",
        "Jack: Oh, I don't even know my way around my own kitchen anymore.",
        "Carly: Actually, it's not your kitchen, Jack. It hasn't been for a long time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Look, I can explain this. I wanted to help Casey out, okay? And I noticed that there was this crooked guard who had it out for him. It was the same exact guy who got his sentence extended in the first place. So I started to watch him, and I noticed he slipped something suspicious to a prisoner, so I just reported him. The warden's office said that they owed me a favor. I asked them to help Casey. I swear, that is all that happened.",
        "Tom: Is this true, Casey?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I got early release thanks to Matt.",
        "Margo: You certainly went out of your way to help our son.",
        "Matt: Casey's a good friend. He's always has my back. And now that I've met his parents, I can see he comes by that naturally.",
        "Tom: So who was it exactly in the warden's office that you talked to about this guard?",
        "Matt: Again, I would tell you, but I'm not supposed to say his name. It had to be anonymous.",
        "Tom: Well, that's convenient. So not only do you have contacts in administration at the prison, you can also pull strings with the federal government?",
        "Margo: Who did you call to get the charges against Casey dropped?",
        "Matt: I can tell you that he was a lawyer and he does some confidential work for the government. He's always been really nice to me. He did some pro bono work on my case also.",
        "Tom: You know, that's something you never mentioned. What was it that you did that landed you in jail?",
        "Matt: I was young and I stole some cars. And I did some other stuff that I'm really not proud of. But I did my time, and I am trying to put my life back together. And I really, really appreciate everything you've done to help me. And I know, I should've been upfront about the ex-con thing. I just hope you don't hold it against me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Of course it'll be a marriage in name only. What do you think?",
        "Luke: Honestly, I don't know what to think! I remember, not long ago, you thought you were in love with Maddie. You guys were living together, you were sleeping together. Maybe you want that kind of relationship again.",
        "Noah: Luke, you know better. Okay, I've been gay my whole life. I just didn't have the courage to admit it. You helped me realize who I am and what I want. Luke, I want you. Of course, it's a marriage in name only.",
        "Luke: But won't like, a homeland security officer be following you around? Won't you have to live with Ameera?",
        "Noah: Only until Ameera gets her citizenship. It won't be forever.",
        "Luke: It'll sure feel that way. Look, I know, I know I'm being selfish. And Ameera is in a really terrible position. I don't begrudge her that. But I never thought we'd be starting our relationship with you marrying someone else. And I know you're doing this for all the right reasons, but -- I'm sorry, I can't help but feel maybe you just want to go back into the closet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I think what Luke and Noah are doing is admirable. But I think they're in over their heads.",
        "Holden: I don't think they're going to go through with the marriage thing, if that's what you mean.",
        "Lily: Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I think that Noah might. And Luke loves Noah, so he's going to be affected. Those two boys, they worked so hard to be together, and now Luke -- there's a chance that he could get hurt or this could be dangerous. Who knows?",
        "Holden: Don't panic. Not yet.",
        "Lily: What if the law gets involved? Homeland security, they don't fool around. I don't want to see Luke or Noah going to jail.",
        "Holden: Luke and Noah are going to make their own decisions. All we can do is offer them guidance and support -- and hope they work it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I know this is tough for you. It's tough for me, too. But think about it. We can save a life here, because that's what's at stake. Hey, I know that this is a huge responsibility, but don't you think it's worth it?",
        "Luke: Noah, just -- just answer me one thing. Do you love me?",
        "Noah: I love you more than you'll ever know and nothing will change that, not this marriage, not anything else.",
        "Luke: That's all I needed to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hi, we need to talk to you. Noah has decided to marry Ameera so she can stay in the country and get her U.S. citizenship.",
        "Lily: Are you sure this is what you want to do?",
        "Noah: We're sure.",
        "Lily: Are you sure you understand what this means? I mean, it's a huge responsibility.",
        "Holden: Noah, you can't just get married, grab your papers, and walk away. The government is going to make sure that it's not a sham. They're going to watch you, make sure that you're living together, acting like a married couple.",
        "Noah: I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to keep Ameera here, and safe.",
        "Lily: Have you thought about the arrangements that you'll make?",
        "Noah: No, I haven't, and of course, if it makes you uncomfortable, Ameera and I will move out.",
        "Luke: No. No, I want you to stay here. I mean, even though Noah's the one who's marrying her, we're both in this together, right?",
        "Lily: Well, this is a -- are you sure about this? Because this is the kind of responsibility that could be more than you bargained for.",
        "Luke: Look, Mom, we want to do this, but not without your blessing. Will you help us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: This is a lot to digest, and I've got to get back to the station. But we are not finished.",
        "Tom: I have a meeting with a client, this conversation is not over.",
        "Margo: Casey, I'm so glad you're home. And Matt, thank you.",
        "Matt: Well, that went about as good as can be expected. Oh better, actually, considering Alison shot her mouth off about me being an ex-con.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I just didn't think it was right for you to lie to them anymore.",
        "Matt: Okay, well, now that's out in the open, are you two cool? Hey, Casey, you'd be behind bars right now if it wasn't for me. A simple thank you might be nice.",
        "Alison: Okay, I can see you two have stuff to discuss. So, I'll see you later.",
        "Matt: Alison, I don't get it. You asked me to help Casey out and that's what I did. I'm doing something good for a friend, so why is everyone so down on me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm sure Holden will agree, we certainly don't want to stand in the way of your decision.",
        "Holden: As long as you guys understand what you're getting into, we'll help you make the necessary arrangements.",
        "Luke: Mom, Dad, thank you so much.",
        "Noah: Yeah, thank you. We'll try not to be too much trouble.",
        "Ameera: I'm sorry, I just wanted a glass of water. I didn't mean to interrupt anything important. I'll go.",
        "Noah: No, don't, it's about you.",
        "Ameera: About me?",
        "Noah: Yes, Luke and I have come to a very important decision. And Mr. and Mrs. Snyder have agreed to help. We're not going to let you get deported.",
        "Ameera: I don't understand. How can you keep it from happening?",
        "Noah: You and I are going to get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I know where you're coming from. We both have a past we'd like to forget. We share that. You know, the difference is, you know about mine and I know next to nothing about yours.",
        "Matt: So you're mad at me because I want to forget about the bad stuff I've done and move on?",
        "Alison: No. Look, thanks to my messy past, I can tell when someone isn't telling the truth. And the way that you just spun Margo and Tom in that conversation, I can tell you were lying. So why?",
        "Matt: I'm just trying to make things easier for Casey.",
        "Alison: I don't buy it, Matt. So, why don't you give me a call when you're ready to actually tell me the truth?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't see him out there.",
        "Jack: Trust me, he's there.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't want to keep you. If you need to go --",
        "Jack: I'm fine.",
        "Carly: -- Then go.",
        "Jack: I'm fine, and I'm not leaving you here alone.",
        "Carly: If Margo has a cop on me 24/7, I think I'll be all right.",
        "Jack: Right -- with Kit sneaking into your car? We still have to figure out a plan to trap her.",
        "Carly: She could be long gone by now.",
        "Jack: I don't know what's worse, Kit in hiding and a constant threat to you, or Kit gone, leaving Parker to take the rap for a crime she committed.",
        "Carly: My neck is in knots. I'm going to go take a long, hot bath. Would you like to join me?",
        "Jack: I -- I think I'm going to grab a beer.",
        "Carly: Your loss.",

        "Alison: Hey, Tom. Do you have a minute?",
        "Tom: Sure, sit down.",
        "Alison: Thanks. I hope you don't mind me asking this, but did you buy everything Matt saying today?",
        "Tom: No, not really. We were kind of shocked that he met Casey in prison and lied about it. But given that he's helped Casey a lot, Margo's pretty much in Matt's corner.",
        "Alison: But don't you feel like he never gives a straight answer?",
        "Tom: I do feel that and I try to figure out some ulterior motive as to why he might be helping Casey, and he's helped him a lot.",
        "Alison: That's very true.",
        "Tom: I mean, except for the fact that he lied about being in prison, I can almost understand that. You know, who wants to tell everybody they just got out of jail? So, I just can't see where Matt's done anything wrong.",
        "Alison: Yeah. No, I know, it's just -- I've spent a fair amount of time with him and I can't put my finger on it, but something doesn't sit right about him.",
        "Tom: Well, I feel the same way. I think it's probably a good idea for all of us to keep our guard up right now.",
        "Alison: Will do. Thanks, Tom.",
        "Tom: Sure, see ya.",
        "Alison: Bye.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: We'd only be doing this only until you became a citizen, then we'd get divorced and go our separate ways, staying friends, of course.",
        "Luke: And you do realize that this is a marriage in name only.",
        "Ameera: Yes, of course. Noah, I can't ask you to do this. You don't want to be with me, you want to be with Luke.",
        "Noah: I don't want to see you get deported, either.",
        "Luke: Neither do I.",
        "Ameera: Mr. and Mrs. Snyder -- what do you think?",
        "Lily: I think Luke and Noah are taking on a huge responsibility.",
        "Holden: But we've agreed to support them as long as they're sure that this is what they want and they understand what's asked of them.",
        "Ameera: I don't know what to say. Thank you all so much. Yes, Noah, I will marry you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Look, I know I shouldn't have lied about the prison thing, but can't you understand why I wouldn't want to announce to the world that I just got out of jail?",
        "Alison: Of course, I do.",
        "Matt: I'm not like Casey, okay? Maybe I wish that I had his life. 'Cause he's got this big, supportive family just singing his praises, and forgiving him his faults. All I'm trying to do is start over, and hold down this job, maybe make some decent friends. Is that too much to ask?",
        "Alison: Not at all.",
        "Matt: I'm being straight with you, Alison. I hope this means we're cool.",
        "Alison: Sure, yeah. We're cool.",

        "Margo: For you, no, never. What's on your tiny, little mind?",
        "Casey: I came to apologize.",
        "Margo: Honey, you did that already, and I accepted.",
        "Casey: No, no, no. I shouldn't have lied to you about Matt.",
        "Margo: No, you shouldn't have, but I'm willing to let it go.",
        "Casey: Thanks. But I want you to know, I never in a million years planned to make you upset or embarrass you by getting arrested last night.",
        "Margo: Well, I certainly hope not. You're just lucky that Matt was able to pull the strings he did and got the charges dropped.",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah. Umm -- I appreciate everything he's done for me. But I've been thinking it might be a good idea if Matt moved out.",
        "Margo: Really?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Margo: After everything he's done for you?",
        "Casey: Well, yeah -- I feel bad about lying to you and Dad because of him, you know? And I think it would be good idea not to have a reminder of my past living in the house. You know, I'm back in school and thanks to you, Matt has a job and he can afford his own place to live now.",
        "Margo: So is this something that the two of you talked about? Matt agrees to this?",
        "Casey: Probably not, but I still think it's a good idea.",
        "Margo: Why do you think it's a good idea? Why do you want him to move out?",
        "Casey: I was in the cell with him for six months, you know? I think it's time to take a break.",
        "Margo: He's your friend and it's your call, and other than him lying about being in prison, which I can understand, I think on the whole, he's been a pretty good influence.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Margo: Hey, you know what? You don't have to decide this now. Why don't you just go think about it, sleep on it, and we'll talk in the morning, okay?",
