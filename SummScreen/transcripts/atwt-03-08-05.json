        "Paul: What could you know about Rosanna? You said you didn't even know where she was until you ran into me.",
        "Barbara: She contacted me.",
        "Paul: She what?",
        "Barbara: This morning.",
        "Paul: No. No, I'm not gonna get sucked into this again. Not by you --",
        "Barbara: You don't have to believe me, Paul. She'll tell you herself.",

        "Jennifer: Scott Reeves and Blue County have a performance in Phoenix, some sort of charity thing. And then they're gonna take them to the airport. You know, we're gonna have to change the order. If we can't find the ivory, we'll just lead with the black. So I want you to meet them at the airport, take them to their limo. And -- right. And you've got the manager's number, right? Good. Call me if you need anything. Okay.",
        "Mike: The message said you were gonna be late. I didn't think that meant you weren't gonna come home at all.",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry. I just got so swamped. I didn't want to call and wake you up again. I just crashed on the couch here.",
        "Mike: I thought you were walking away from Street Jeans.",
        "Jennifer: Well, but then I thought about it. You know, this is my company. I don't care what my mother's accounts say. I found the ivory! Put it back at the top of the order! Look, babe, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just -- with this event tonight, I just have so much to do. So can we catch up later?",
        "Mike: Jen, what's going on?",
        "Jennifer: Nothing. I just have a deadline.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry, I'm not buying it. And I am not leaving here until you tell me what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You know you are the best sister in the entire world.",
        "Margo: Yes. I am. So I take it the zoning variance was approved?",
        "Katie: Just because you live next door to the commissioner, yes, thank you very much.",
        "Margo: And you got Mike to sign off that he supervised all the work?",
        "Katie: Oh, not yet. I've been busy.",
        "Margo: Katie, a variance isn't valid without the signature of the contractor on the permit.",
        "Katie: I know. I'll call him. I will. But I'm gonna call Henry first, because this whole gym thing was his idea in the first place.",
        "Margo: How is old Henry?",
        "Katie: Happily married.",
        "Margo: Oh. So you guys have resolved that little issue?",
        "Katie: If you're asking if we've consummated our marriage yet, no. But these things take time.",
        "Margo: Really? That's never been my experience.",
        "Katie: All right, we're gonna work it out. And if we don't work it out, somehow it will work out, because we love each other, and I promised him till death do we part, and I don't plan on dying any time soon, so there you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: So operation redhead is a go?",
        "Craig: Well, Henry, your plan to get Katie and Mmike together at Metro clearly had an impact. Jennifer is back at work.",
        "Henry: Well, this calls for a celebration.",
        "Craig: No, not so fast. If you really love your wife, I want you to get a plan together to get Mike Kasnoff out of Street Jeans and back into Katie's arms where he belongs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: You think I killed Julia? Based on what?",
        "Jack: Where's J.J.?",
        "Holden: He's upstairs.",
        "Jack: Well, I don't want him witnessing this, so please let's do this at the station.",
        "Keith: I'm not going anywhere. So you and Holden can take J.J. and hide him someplace? You've got nothing on me and you know it. Now, where is my nephew?!",
        "Jack: Where were you on the day that Julia died?",
        "Keith: I told you where I was -- in Chicago.",
        "Jack: No, you weren't, Keith. You were here in Oakdale, at the bank, with a forged document giving you power of attorney over Julia's estate.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's right. On the day she died, Keith here was opening Julia's safe deposit box and pulled out documents that were only supposed to be opened in the event of her death. And I'm wondering why.",
        "Keith: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Jack: Oh, no? I have an eyewitness and surveillance video that says I do.",
        "Keith: I admit I went to the bank.",
        "Jack: I thought you were in Chicago.",
        "Keith: We're done here. I'm calling my lawyer.",
        "Jack: You're lawyering up now? Why? Why?",
        "Keith: Because you are trying to railroad me because you want my nephew, that's why.",
        "Jack: Why were you at the bank, Keith?",
        "Keith: I wanted to get some things out of my sister's safety deposit box.",
        "Jack: Some things? You emptied the whole damn box.",
        "Holden: Why did you lie to us about Chicago?",
        "Keith: Because you two are on a witch hunt.",
        "Jack: You see, there's a problem with your argument, and that's timing. You were in Chicago. I didn't even break the news to you that Julia had died. Why lie, Keith? Why lie unless you already knew she was dead?",
        "Keith: Hey, back off. What kind of a monster do you think I am? Kill my sister? I loved her. She's the only family I've got now.",
        "Jack: See, that's another -- that's another funny thing there, because in the time that we were married, she never once mentioned a brother, an uncle -- nothing.",
        "Keith: Well, you know, that's not my fault, you know. I begged her to move in with me after she got away from Les. But she was afraid, because of my job, that I wouldn't be around. That I couldn't protect her. I told her I'd quit my job at the airline. The next morning, she was gone, and I'd been looking for her since until these two showed up and told me where she was. I thought I had a second chance. But she found somebody that could protect her -- you, Holden. Yeah. You know, all she ever wanted to do was marry and have kids. You were supposed to fulfill her dream.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, I guess that dream didn't include an uncle who wanted equal time with J.J.",
        "Keith: Look, I panicked. I went to the safety deposit box because I wanted to see the guardianship papers.",
        "Jack: Right. Right, the papers that you supposedly have with you today.",
        "Keith: I wanted to see, to make sure that she hadn't changed anything that she still wanted me to take care of J.J. and she did.",
        "Jack: Well, you're right about one thing, 'cause if Julia had married Holden, she would've changed those agreements.",
        "Keith: Well, she wasn't gonna marry Holden.",
        "Jack: Then why panic, Keith?",
        "Keith: How could I have killed Julia? I wasn't at her apartment. You yourself said I was at the bank.",
        "Jack: You already lied once about your whereabouts that day, so why wouldn't I believe that you'd lie again? We're done here. We're going to the station.",
        "Keith: We're not going anywhere. J.J.! Come on --",
        "Jack: You keep calling him, your kid's gonna see you in handcuffs. You want that?",
        "Keith: I want these two -- those two are responsible, but you don't want to see it.",
        "Jack: Let's go.",
        "Keith: Get off me!",
        "Jack: I'll call you from the station.",
        "Carly: No, Jack -- he should've waited for backup.",
        "Holden: Carly, I'll follow him, all right?",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Holden: You gonna be okay?",

        "Mike: The last time we talked, you didn't want anything to do with your mother.",
        "Jennifer: Craig's has taken care of Barbara.",
        "Mike: And who's looking after Craig?",
        "Jennifer: You know, I know that this is not what you wanted.",
        "Mike: Whoa -- how'd this get to be about me?",
        "Jennifer: Because you wanted me to stay home and have kids and get married.",
        "Mike: I never said that you --",
        "Jennifer: As soon as Henry and Katie started talking kids, you decided that we should have some of our own.",
        "Mike: My wanting to have kids has nothing to do with Henry.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. Fine. But I am not ready to give up my career.",
        "Mike: Who said you had to give up your career?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm not going to do what my mother did and try to run an empire while baking brownies at 2:00 the morning, so that the world thinks I'm some sort of supermom. When I decide to have kids, they will to be the focus.",
        "Mike: Great.",
        "Jennifer: But I'm not ready yet.",
        "Mike: Jen, whatever you want, I am here for you. Okay? You needed a model to launch Street Jeans, who posed for the pictures? You needed help standing up to your mom, and I was right there for you. But working here with Craig Montgomery and your mom -- I just don't want to see you get hurt again.",
        "Jennifer: You really mean that?",
        "Mike: Of course I mean it. Why -- why would you even ask that question?",
        "Jennifer: Because, I just -- and I know it's not intentional, when people -- people can't help how they feel sometimes.",
        "Assistant: Jennifer, I need your approval on these new proofs.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, sorry. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You're gonna have to move fast, Henry.",
        "Henry: Are you asking me to sacrifice my marriage?",
        "Craig: She's in love with another man, Henry. What kind of marriage are we talking about?",
        "Henry: I'll take Katie any way I can get her.",
        "Craig: You want her unhappy? Because that's the way she's going to be when she realizes that Mike Kasnoff married Jennifer, only because he thought she was happily married to you.",
        "Henry: I offered to have the marriage annulled. She wouldn't hear of it.",
        "Craig: That's because she feels guilty about you, Henry. She can't tell you the truth. She can't tell you she's in love with Mike Kasnoff and wants out. That's why you have to suck it up. Act like a man. Dump her, Henry. Before you break her heart for good.",
        "Henry: And if she doesn't let me dump her, Craig, then what?",
        "Craig: Henry, there's only two ways to free a married woman, you divorce her or you widow her. You pick one.",
        "Henry: Widow her? That would mean I have to -- Craig? Craig?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Henry and I will make love when the time is right.",
        "Margo: And when's that gonna be? When Mike is finally through with you and he marries Jennifer and they have their first child or their second child?",
        "Katie: If that's what they want, fine.",
        "Margo: Oh, Kathryn, it's one thing to lie to me, but when you start lying to yourself, that's when you're asking for trouble.",
        "Katie: Okay. All right. I will admit that there is a certain pull between Mike and me, but we're gonna get past it.",
        "Margo: Oh, really? How are you going to do that? Some night when he's working on the gym, hanging drywall, he's stripped down to his Street Jeans, and he asks you to hand him a hammer -- you're gonna get past it? When it's the one thing that you really want?",
        "Henry: You want something, Katie?",
        "Katie: No. Nothing. I'm fine. I have everything I want.",
        "Margo: You'll have to excuse me, Henry. I gotta go clean out my ears.",
        "Henry: Okay. What's wrong with her ears?",
        "Katie: Oh, she's just going to that party at Metro tonight for Street Jeans and she has to get ready. We should get going, too.",
        "Henry: What -- what did you girls talk about?",
        "Katie: Oh, I was just telling Margo how happy we are, and that no marriage is perfect. Which is why we're working on our situation.",
        "Henry: What situation?",
        "Katie: Our \"not quite sleeping together yet\" situation.",
        "Henry: You told her about that, Katie?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Why not? She's my sister.",
        "Henry: I -- so what? I don't care if she's your clone, you don't tell people what you're not doing.",
        "Katie: She knew about how this whole started --",
        "Henry: Everybody knows how this started! Why don't we just take out a full- page ad in \"The City Times?\" \"Katie Peretti Frasier -- almost Kasnoff -- Coleman doesn't sleep with her husband\"? Then everybody will know!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Okay, notice the handwriting?",
        "Paul: Right, you just happened to have that when you just happened to run into me.",
        "Barbara: If you recall, you ran into me. And, no, I was given this as I was leaving the office. I read it in the car. Okay, if this is of no interest to you, I'll just --",
        "Paul: Where did you get her perfume?",
        "Barbara: I drove by her car one day and caught her scent through the bulletproof glass, and then I ran out and had someone make a copy of it, which I then poured all over the envelope -- after I'd paid the forger. I'm nothing if not thorough.",
        "Paul: She hates you. Why would she write to you?",
        "Barbara: Well, she made that very clear in that letter. You know what? This is really none of your business. Paul, I only thought I should show it to you so you could be spared the pain that you would endure if you went down to Santo Domingo and tried to reason with her. Because you know what that letter proves? She's beyond reason. And, you know, that was addressed to me, and maybe you shouldn't read it after all, but -- maybe now that she's had a chance to vent, she might be more open.",
        "Paul: You think she's over me? Am I just a fool?",
        "Barbara: No, I think you're a wonderful man. And that she's an idiot. Now, let's just forget all about this, okay?",
        "Paul: Wait. Read it.",
        "Barbara: Are you sure you want me to do this?",
        "Paul: Yes. Go ahead, Mother, let's just play this out.",
        "Barbara: \"Dear Barbara, as you're no doubt aware by now, I was responsible for drugging Emily and instructing her to haunt me.\" Paul, we know all this.",
        "Paul: Keep reading.",
        "Barbara: \"Were you surprised? I know Paul was and poor Emily. I am sorry I had to involve her, but I needed an ally, and with you locked up in the house, it was irresistible. And I had to do something dramatic, something that would cause the kind of pain I felt when I lost the only person I've ever truly loved. But then you have some inkling of how that feels -- to love a child and lose him? You've been driven by that fear your whole life. But no, I don't feel sympathy for you, Barbara, and this isn't a letter of apology. I just couldn't leave town without letting you know how much I've enjoyed watching you suffer. It was almost as satisfying as hurting Paul.\"",

        "Jennifer: Oh, Hon, I'm sorry. This is just really not a good time.",
        "Mike: Jen. Jen! Look, I get what you love about all this. All right, if this is what you want to do, go for it. I am 100% behind you.",
        "Craig: That's smart, Mike, because our Jennifer's about to become the hottest new designer since Narcisco Rodriguez.",
        "Jennifer: Ah, just take care of my mother and I will be so happy.",
        "Craig: Yeah, so far, so good.",
        "Mike: So far, so good? I thought she was supposed to be out of the picture permanently.",

        "Jennifer: Oh, no, no, no, not yet. Thank you for reminding me.",

        "Henry: Don't remind me.",
        "Katie: I'm really sorry if I embarrassed you, Henry. I didn't mean to. I was just telling Margo how much fun we have every day and how much we love each other, so she asked if we had -- and I said --",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know what you said, Katie. And -- I -- look, I love you, too. It's just that -- it's just that --",

        "Carly: Well, Jack caught him in quite a lie, didn't he?",
        "Lily: I don't know. He seemed genuinely upset that Jack -- or anyone -- would think that he murdered his own sister.",
        "Carly: Well, you've got to remember something, Lily -- Jack is very good at his job. And he found an eyewitness who puts Keith in the bank with forged papers.",
        "Lily: I don't know, I don't know. Maybe he did that because he was afraid he was gonna lose J.J.",
        "Carly: Maybe he killed her because he was afraid he was going to lose J.J. You said it yourself, Lily. Julia was alive when you left her.",
        "Lily: Yes, and that's what I would tell Jack.",
        "Carly: We've already had this discussion. We agreed that going to the police is not a good idea.",

        "Carly: What about Luke? Do you honestly think he's gonna let his mother take the fall for this?",
        "Lily: I'm guilty! I left her lying there on the floor. I will not let an innocent man go to jail.",
        "Carly: An innocent man? Didn't you hear him? Keith told Jack he wasn't anywhere near Julia's apartment. You know that's not true. Why would he lie if he wasn't guilty?",

        "Keith: I told you that I wanted to make sure that J.J. was still mine.",

        "Dr. Maslin: Anxiety will do that. I'd give you a sedative, but the last time you were treated here for -- a concussion? Your blood alcohol level was such that I'd say sedatives are contraindicated.",

        "Katie: Exactly. Do you know how humiliate Henry was? And then he collapsed. Now, he's fighting for his life, and it's all my fault.",
        "Margo: Katie, I took his pulse at the house. He's not fighting for his life.",
        "Katie: How do you know?",
