    "Recap": [
        "Casey and Maddie help to make Will and Gwen's wedding night as romantic as possible by borrowing some of the Lakeview's flower arrangements and raiding the kitchen. Luke confronts Jade after he suspects her of trying to steal his mother's bracelet. Lily suspects Jade's motives after hearing about her claims to Holden of learning how to knit in the orphanage and then especially after Emma comes to them with tales of finding Jade with her bracelet in the barn and Luke trying to cover for her. Anatoli uses a drug to wake Nick up so they can walk him out of the Lakeview, but also wipe his memory out. Carly continues to defend herself to Katie regarding Nick, and it gets heated just as Jack arrives. Jack is able to cool things down, but after he is called by Margo to go to the Galaxy Club, Carly again staunchly defends her dislike for Nick and her undying love for Jack, but she will not really explain what she is doing. Jade tries to explain to Luke that she only took Lily's bracelet to look at it and to imagine herself in a fantasy with a real family. Luke tries to understand, so Jade shows how he can trust her when she calls Kevin and sets up a secret meeting for them. Margo catches Maddie and Casey at the Lakeview, but Casey explains they were there to meet Lisa. He later worries to Maddie that he will be grounded for life after his parents find out what he did for Will and Gwen but it was worth it to make up for how he treated Gwen. For the first time in a long while, he feels good about himself. Maddie and Casey see Nick being led out of the Lakeview, but the men he is with act as if he is drunk. Lily questions Jade about if she left the orphanage at such a young age, how she could have learned to knit? An unknowing Kevin meets Luke, but when he finds out it was a set up, he is not pleased. Carly calls Chardonnay to ask about the pictures, and she ominously tells her that she no longer has to worry about Nick. Jack sees Nick being beaten by Anatoli's goons and tries to help, which leads Nick and Jack into the middle of a gun fight."

        "Luke: Jade, that was a gift from my father to mother.",
        "Jade: And it's beautiful. That's why I couldn't resist trying it on. What? You don't really think I was going to keep it for myself? That's like calling me a thief. You have to know that I'm not a thief.",
        "Luke: Look, I covered for you with my grandma, so now we're even.",
        "Jade: I was going to bring the bracelet back. I swear.",
        "Luke: Or maybe -- maybe you've just been playing us this whole time. Maybe you're exactly where you want to be -- in our house with tons of nice stuff at your fingertips.",
        "Jade: You think that I'm here because I want to steal from you?",
        "Luke: Well, it sure looks that way.",

        "Carly: With your track cord, maybe you shouldn't be butting into other people's marriages.",
        "Katie: You're not gonna have a marriage if you keep lying, Carly.",
        "Carly: Thanks for the tip. See ya.",
        "Katie: Seeing you at that disgusting club, then finding your wedding ring in Nick's pocket. Then the note, and don't tell me you just happened to be at the Lakeview tonight, Carly.",
        "Carly: I'm going to give you one last chance to just go! Now, before you embarrass yourself.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, but I don't embarrass easily. And I meant what I said before. I'm not leaving until you tell me the truth.",
        "Carly: Okay, all right, Katie. Yes, you did see me with Nick at the galaxy club, but we ran into each other. It wasn't planned. And as for my wedding ring, I had to take it off and give it to him before the manager saw it.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Carly: They don't hire married women, Katie. I needed a job. And once I got the feel for the place, I knew couldn't work there and I quit.",
        "Katie: That is such a lie.",
        "Carly: You know Jack. He has so much pride. If he knew that I even thought about working in a place like that, he'd be humiliated.",

        "Carly: For the last time, I was not meeting Nick.",

        "Jack: Neither do I. What is this? What's going on with you two?",
        "Carly: It's nothing, Jack, really. Katie was just trying to get me to cut Nick a little more slack, that's all.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Carly: Well, because Nick is Mike's cousin, and because we're friends with Mike and Katie.",
        "Jack: Well, that doesn't mean that we have to be Nick's friend, too.",
        "Carly: You see, I told you that he'd feel that way.",
        "Jack: Listen, Katie, Mike is a great guy, and I've told you this before, Nick is no Mike. He never will be.",

        "Katie: I don't think so.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Jack: Katie, I'm sorry, but Nick has done some things on the job that you have no way of knowing. He's given me more than enough reasons to keep my distance. And if you think that's bad, don't leave Carly alone in a room with him.",
        "Katie: Funny you should say that.",
        "Carly: There is nothing funny about Nick Kasnoff.",
        "Jack: Katie, it's nice of you to run interference for Nick, but don't waste your time. He doesn't need your help. He doesn't want your help. From everything I can tell, Nick thinks he has this whole town wired. He came to town determined to play hero, and now he's got everybody treating him like one.",

        "Anatoly: You after a medal, huh? Is that it? You felt so lucky today, didn't you, hero, with the ladies? You like pretty little Chardonnay? Is she your type? What about Tiffany? She's hot.

        "Casey: Yeah, it was Mike's drunk cousin. He's toasted.",

        "Jade: Fine, we'll go up to the house, and I'll hand the bracelet over to your mom. And if she believes me, she believes me. And if she doesn't, well, it's not the first time I've been kicked out.",
        "Luke: Jade, nobody's kicking you out.",
        "Jade: I wasn't keeping the bracelet, Luke. That's the truth.",
        "Luke: Well, just make sure you put it back.",
        "Jade: Okay, look, here's what really happened. Your dad came in the room while I was trying on the bracelet, just to see how it looked. And I didn't want him to get the wrong idea and freak. So I hid the bracelet, and I got out of the house as fast as I could.",
        "Luke: Because you were just trying it on?",
        "Jade: Yes! What do I have to do to prove myself? I cover for you with your dad. I'm totally cool helping you see Kevin.",
        "Luke: Well, I know, but that is --",
        "Jade: So I screw up once, and you're all over me for one stupid mistake?",
        "Luke: Well, I don't even know why you care what I think?",
        "Jade: Because I care, Luke. I care about belonging. I care about us being friends. If you're gonna hate me because I had one loser moment where I got lost in a fantasy --",
        "Luke: Jade, I don't hate you.",
        "Jade: Good. But that's not quite what I was hoping for when I started living here. I was hoping that I could be a part of a real family.",
        "Luke: You are, because of Rose.",
        "Jade: Don't, okay?",
        "Luke: What? I don't even know what I said.",
        "Jade: You have memories and stories. And all I have is a few faded pictures and a really weird feeling when I look at your mom. And sometimes I look at Lily, and I pretend she's Rose. And then my brain catches up to my heart, and inside I'm screaming, \"Why couldn't it be true? Why couldn't I have known my mom, just for a little while?\"",
        "Luke: Look, I didn't mean to call you a thief.",
        "Jade: Luke, I know that you don't trust many people right now. You're worried that your dad won't understand. You're afraid of letting down your mom. But try being in my shoes, just for a second. What I get from being here is not about pretty bracelets or nice stuff. I'll show you what it's about.",

        "Holden: What do you think Jade's lying about?",
        "Lily: She told you that she learned to knit at the orphanage.",
        "Holden: Yeah, so what about it?",
        "Lily: She said she was adopted when she was very young. Do you trust her?",
        "Holden: No more than I trust any other teenager. I'll tell you what? Let's just see how it all plays out. Let's just do that.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Emma: Hello.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Emma: Hi, my dear ones. Listen, I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I saw your lights on and I --",
        "Lily: It's okay.",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Emma: Well, I -- I don't know. I just ran into Jade and Luke at the barn.",
        "Holden: What were they doing down there?",
        "Emma: Well, Jade had Lily's bracelet. Did you -- did you know that she had taken it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Check it out. Just like the real thing, only legal.",
        "Maddie: That was a great idea, Case, the cider.",
        "Casey: Yeah, good thing Bernie was in the kitchen. I knew he'd help us out. Hey, can we go now?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. I'm almost finished with these.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I'm trying to tell you, Will could care less about flowers tonight.",
        "Maddie: Well, maybe on one level.",
        "Casey: No, on all levels. Well, be careful. If you burn this hotel down, my grandma will flip out.",
        "Maddie: All for a good cause.",
        "Casey: Romance.",
        "Maddie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Casey: Did you ever think maybe you've seen too many movies in your life?",
        "Maddie: Okay, I'm sorry, who brought the rings for Gwen and Will? You were the one that brought them. And yeah, I think you're pretty much just as romantic as I am. You're just too afraid to admit it.",
        "Casey: Yeah, whatever.",
        "Maddie: Hey, hey, off the bed! You're gonna ruin the flowers!",
        "Casey: They're gonna mess them up anyway! That's the only good thing about this deal anyways.",
        "Maddie: What deal?",
        "Casey: Marriage. I mean, Gwen and Will can do it anywhere, any way, any how -- doesn't matter. What, like guys don't think like that?",
        "Maddie: Some guys. All right, let's just finish up here.",
        "Will: How many times?",
        "Gwen: Uh, six. No, actually I got seven Mrs. Munson's on the way up.",
        "Will: Including the doorman?",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Will: You know what? I never actually asked you if maybe you wanted to keep your own name.",
        "Gwen: Norbeck? Hmm-mm. Munson's been much luckier thus far.",
        "Will: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gwen: Hey, maybe we should take this inside.",
        "Maddie: Oh, you're here!",
        "Gwen: So are you.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Casey: When you're ready, go check it out.",
        "Maddie: Happy honeymoon.",
        "Will: Hey, wait a minute.",
        "Gwen: What, you think Casey rigged something over the door?",
        "Will: No, but a frog in the bed would be much more his style.",
        "Gwen: Well, I'll check the sheets.",
        "Will: No, why don't you allow me?",
        "Gwen: What are you doing? What are you doing?",
        "Will: Carrying my wife over the threshold.",
        "Gwen: I can't believe Casey and Maddie did this. It's beautiful.",

        "Luke: Look, its okay, Jade. You don't have anything to prove.",
        "Jade: I think I do.",
        "Luke: I just -- I don't like lying to my grandma, that's all.",

        "Emma: Yes, I'm positive.",
        "Lily: I checked. It's missing.",
        "Holden: What did Jade say?",
        "Emma: Well, Luke did most of the talking. He said that they had taken it to surprise Lily. They were gonna get a new charm.",
        "Holden: And you didn't believe them?",
        "Emma: No more than I believed you and Caleb when you told me you didn't know how those beer kegs got into the barn.",
        "Lily: Something's going on.",
        "Holden: Or maybe when she saw Mama, she panicked and didn't want to let her in on the surprise.",
        "Emma: Well, that's -- that's possible.",
        "Lily: If Jade is stealing --",
        "Holden: And we're not sure that she is.",
        "Lily: We have to talk to her.",
        "Holden: I think that we should just sit tight and see if the kids show up with a charm -- a new charm on the bracelet, okay? I'm sure everything will check out.",
        "Emma: I hope so. I hope so. Listen, I better be going. It's getting a bit late.",
        "Holden: All right, I'll walk you out.",
        "Emma: You get some sleep, sweetheart.",

        "Katie: That is why I care so much.",
        "Carly: About Nick?",
        "Jack: Katie, I've seen guys like him before. A certain amount of swagger, that goes along with the job. But I mean, too much of it, especially on a big case, can turn into a liability. Nick thinks he can do everything on his own. Sooner or later, that's gonna come back to hurt him.",
        "Carly: Are we done with Nick yet, please?",
        "Katie: That's a strange question, coming from you.",

        "Jack: Just hand out warnings?",
        "Margo: Exactly. And just downplay it. We don't want to lose any ground.",
        "Jack: You got it. And Margo, thanks for pulling me in on this. Appreciate it. Okay, Carly, I -- I've got to go. I shouldn't be too late. Save some nachos for me though, okay?",
