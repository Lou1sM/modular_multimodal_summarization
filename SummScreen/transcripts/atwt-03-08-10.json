        "Damian presses Faith with subtle threats into making sure she gets Lily to a house outside of town. Faith concocts a story about going back to school and asks her mom to take her to her friend's house. Faith says goodbye to her dad before she supposedly heads back to school still worried about if she is doing the right thing by keeping Damian's secret. Molly goes to Faith's school and learns a horrifying truth \u0096 that Damian was the one that picked Faith up. Holden is trying to delay being transferred to a different lockup, but the police officer isn't interested in listening. Molly is able to get a moment with Holden before they take him away; she tells Holden about what she found out at Faith's school. Holden is devastated, and now puts the pieces together about the trap Lily and Faith are walking into. Jack and Carly are relishing in their newfound freedom to be together; they are open and able to say I love you to one another, as they fall into bed with one another. They promise they will never let go of one another again. At this time, Janet is at the hospital trying to process the information that she is pregnant. She wants to believe that it is Jack's and immediately wants to share her news with him. Dusty is not jumping on the bandwagon and wants her to consider the baby might be his, but she won't hear of it because it is a gift for Liberty. Jack and Carly's blissful moment is interrupted when Janet calls with her news, as Jack and Carly are overwrought. Jack has to go to talk with Janet, as Carly struggles to be ok with this. Jack, once downstairs however, races back to Carly to reassure her again with words and kisses promising that he loves her and this will not change anything \u0096 even though Carly is sure it will. Lily sees Faith's reaction to a text by Damian and pushes her to admit to her about what is really going on. Faith breaks down and admits to Lily what is going on with Damian. Lily is upset that Faith didn't tell them what Damian was doing. She calls the police, but the reception is bad; she decides that she is going to talk with Damian herself. Faith is worried about her going in alone, but Lily is sure the police are not far behind. Holden pleads with the officer to listen to him about his family being in trouble, but he won't. Holden overtakes the officer and runs off with the help of Molly. Jack interrupts Dusty pleading with Janet to entertain the possibility the baby could be his, but she won't. Dusty doesn't say anything to Jack about his belief and leaves them to talk. Janet assures Jack that she is just thankful for his gift and this changes nothing between them because she knows he loves Carly; they are still going to get an annulment. Dusty tells Teri about his feeling, but Teri is also unsure given the length of time since he was with Janet, but Dusty reminds her that Janet wasn't feeling well for weeks. Dusty decides he needs to know who the father of the baby is. Sage figures out that Carly and Jack are back together, as Carly tries to downplay the reconciliation since it is complicated, but when Jack comes back, Sage can hardly contain herself. After she leaves, Jack is worried about Carly telling her the truth. Carly is frustrated that he sounded like he wanted her to lie, Jack quickly changes his tune explaining that is not what he wants; he wants her and to be a family again; he is just trying to digest all of this. They again reconfirm that they won't let this affect their future, but when they hug they both look concerned independently. Dusty tries to get Janet to believe he could be the father, but Janet can't let herself because the odds of helping Liberty are so much more with Jack's baby. She is upset that he is pressuring her. Dusty won't back down because she hasn't been feeling well for weeks. Janet shoots back that Liberty has been sick and she was just stressed. Dusty continues to remind her that he loves her; he needs to know, as he pulls her in closely. Lily walks into the house calling out for Damian. Damian comes from behind her happy to see in his mind that \u0091she has come back to him."

        "Holden: I have to reach my lawyer, Tom Hughes, or my cousin Detective Snyder. I have to get out of here.",
        "Cop: You are. You're being transferred to county jail.",
        "Holden: No, that's not what I mean. You're not listening to me. My family is in danger.",
        "Cop: You can see your family before you go.",
        "Holden: No. No, I need to be with them. I need to protect them from the man that I am accused of murdering. [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Damian, I can't do this anymore.",
        "Damian: I thought we had an understanding, Faith.",
        "Faith: Do you know how hard this is? My father is in jail for killing you, and I'm sneaking around, trying to make sure that my mom doesn't find out.",
        "Damian: Come on. We both know you're much more capable of sneaking around than you let on. And you know what it would do to your parents if they found out the kind of trouble you were in at school.",
        "Faith: I'm starting to so not care anymore.",
        "Damian: You care about your mother, though, don't you? I told you, the people who are after me will most likely go after your mother unless you help me protect her.",
        "Faith: You know, I'm not sure I even buy that anymore, either.",
        "Damian: Faith, focus. Your father will be free. Your mother will be safe. But not unless you do as I say. Do you understand me?",
        "Faith: Yes.",
        "Damian: Now, you have to get your mother to meet me somewhere private. There's a house in Forest Hills. I will text you the address.",
        "Faith: Forest Hills? How am I supposed to get her there?",
        "Damian: I will trust you to come up with something. Because if you and your mother are not there within two hours, you will force me to take drastic action.",
        "Faith: And what is that supposed to mean?!",
        "Damian: Trust me, you don't want to know.",
        "Lily: Faith, who was that?",
        "Faith: My friend Deanna from school.",
        "Lily: Did you two have a fight?",
        "Faith: No. I -- she wants me to come back to school, and I -- I told her I'd be back later today. So you have to drive me there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Hi! I'm Faith Snyder's mother. Thank you so much for meeting me this morning, Ms. Gibson.",
        "Ms. Gibson: I understand you're concerned about your daughter.",
        "Molly: Yes. Her father and I want to be clear on the circumstances surrounding her suspension from school. What, is something wrong?",
        "Ms. Gibson: You're not Lily Snyder.",
        "Molly: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Ms. Gibson: You're that TV reporter from Oakdale.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "Jack: It's you.",
        "Carly: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: No, I mean it's -- it's -- it's you. It's really -- I'm here with you, and I almost can't believe it.",
        "Carly: Well, it's really you, too.",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Jack: Stop it. Let me look -- let me look at you for a second. You're more beautiful than I remember. And you're more precious to me than I ever thought possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Are you -- am I -- are you sure?",
        "Doctor: I've been at this a while. I know what pregnant looks like.",
        "Janet: I can't believe it.",
        "Doctor: I'll leave you and Mr. Snyder to celebrate alone. This is a special moment for a couple.",
        "Dusty: Are you okay?",
        "Janet: I'm stunned.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I see that.",
        "Janet: I mean, all this talk about whether I should have a baby, should I have a baby, how to have the baby, and it looks like God intervened to save Liberty's life.",
        "Dusty: I want that more than anything.",
        "Janet: Thank you, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I know this is the most important thing to you.",
        "Janet: Oh, thank you so much. I know how hard this must be for you. But thank you for understanding why Jack and I have to have this baby.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's just it.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Dusty: Do you really have to ask me that, Janet?",
        "Janet: What are you getting at?",
        "Dusty: Are you 100% sure this is Jack's baby and not ours?",
        "Janet: How can you ever think that, let alone ask?",
        "Dusty: Did you forget we slept together?",
        "Janet: That was months ago.",
        "Dusty: The doctor didn't say how long you've been pregnant.",
        "Janet: It's not a possibility.",
        "Dusty: It's a total possibility that this baby is ours, and you know it.",
        "Janet: No, I don't.",
        "Dusty: Janet, we can't afford --",
        "Janet: There is no \"We\"! Stop that!",
        "Dusty: Stop what?! The truth. You got to face the possibility.",
        "Janet: No, I don't, because there is no possibility.",
        "Dusty: Janet, this baby might be ours.",
        "Janet: Will you stop saying that?",
        "Dusty: We've got to talk about it.",
        "Janet: Stop it. This baby is mine and Jack's. We specifically had this baby to save my daughter's life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why didn't we fight harder to hold on to this, hmm?",
        "Carly: Maybe we fought so hard, we tired ourselves out. Maybe the trick is to not fight. Let's just hold on to each other as tight as we can.",
        "Jack: You think I'm ever letting go of you again?",
        "Carly: You better not. Being here like this with you, I'm completely at peace.",
        "Jack: We wasted so much time not being together. You know that?",
        "Carly: Well, how many people get a second chance?",
        "Jack: Oh, I think we're well beyond our second chance.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: You belong here with me and our kids, our family.",
        "Jack: I know. And for a while there, I never thought we'd get back here, that I'd never hold you in my arms again.",
        "Carly: You came back to me, like you promised you would.",
        "Jack: Well, hey, you told me that I shouldn't come back unless I can give my whole self to you, remember?",
        "Carly: Do you remember the other promise I asked you to make me that day?",
        "Jack: I do. I promised not to say I loved you until I -- I was really yours. And I am. I'm yours. And I love you.",
        "Carly: I love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm asking you to consider the possibility.",
        "Janet: Will you please stop using that word?",
        "Dusty: Well, stop saying I couldn't have gotten you pregnant, Janet.",
        "Janet: No. It can't be. This has to be Jack's baby for Liberty.",
        "Dusty: I know that's what you want.",
        "Janet: Do you?",
        "Dusty: Yes. But if it is our baby, there is a chance it could be a match for Liberty, also.",
        "Janet: But Brad is Jack's brother. That's almost 100%.",
        "Dusty: And if it is ours?",
        "Janet: Please, stop this. Please. I have to call Jack, okay? This is Jack's baby. Please tell me that you hear me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Carly: You should get that.",
        "[Jack groans]",
        "Carly: Go ahead.",
        "Jack: Hello.",
        "Janet: Jack, I -- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm at the hospital.",
        "Jack: What? You're still there? Why?",
        "Janet: Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm sorry. I should have told you that first.",
        "Jack: No, it's okay. But why -- I mean, you've seen a doctor, right?",
        "Janet: Yep. And he said -- we did it.",
        "Jack: We did what?",
        "Janet: I'm pregnant.",
        "Carly: What is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith, I think it's great that your friend helped convince you to go back to school. But I can't take him there today.",
        "Faith: You have to.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Faith: Because I -- I need to make sure that I don't miss out on any more stuff.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, with everything that's going on with your father right now, I think it would be better if we waited a couple of days. Can you do that? I can call Ms. Gibson, the headmistress.",
        "Faith: Mom, it's now or never with catching up. I can't do anything for Dad here.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: Okay. I suppose we could leave now.",
        "Faith: My friend Deanna's got a broken leg.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Faith: No, I mean she came home because of it. But now she's going back, and her parents are taking her there. So I can go with her.",
        "Lily: Well, great. Where does she live?",
        "Faith: Forest Hills.",
        "Lily: That's not too far. Okay. How long do you need to pack?",
        "Faith: It won't take me long.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, I am so proud of you. This is exactly what your daddy and I wanted for you -- for you to take school so seriously.",
        "Faith: I just wanted to make you guys proud of me.",
        "Lily: Aw! You do, Baby, every day.",
        "Faith: There's one stop I want to make first before we go to Deanna's, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Okay, you're right. I am a reporter. I'm not Faith Snyder's mother. But I am with her father, which makes me feel like a parent to her.",
        "Ms. Gibson: You still have no right to information on any student.",
        "Molly: The man who picked Faith up on campus wasn't her father, Ms. Gibson. Her father's in prison on trumped-up charges, so he couldn't have picked her up. Which begs the question, just who did you release an underage student to, Ms. Gibson? Yeah, if Faith left school with an older man and you allowed it, huh, I'd hate to think what that would do not only to you, but to the reputation of your school. Yeah, I guess there is such a thing as bad publicity. Do you have any idea who this man was? Can you at least describe him to me?",
        "Ms. Gibson: Tall, thin. He was very convincing. And he had an Italian accent.",
        "Molly: Oh, my God. Damian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hey.",
        "Holden: Hey. Did they call you?",
        "Lily: Who?",
        "Holden: Uh, nobody. Uh, you know what? Never mind. Is -- is everything okay?",
        "Lily: Better than okay. Faith has decided to go back to school.",
        "Holden: You are? Well, that's good. That's good news.",
        "Faith: I wanted to say goodbye. What's with the handcuffs? Seriously.",
        "Holden: Don't worry about it.",
        "Faith: I hate that you're in here like this. I wish I could do something to help.",
        "Holden: I know you do. But all I want you to do is just take care of yourself. That's what's going to help me the most -- knowing that you're happy, that you're healthy, and that you're enjoying yourself at school.",
        "Faith: You'll get out of here soon.",
        "Holden: I hope so, too. So, uh, when are you heading out? It's going to be a long trip for you, huh?",
        "Lily: Oh, Faith is getting a ride from a friend whose family lives in Forest Hills, so I don't have to go all the way. But maybe we should get going 'cause they'll be waiting for us.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Faith: I know you didn't do what they say you did.",
        "Holden: I love you, too, Sweetheart. You guys be careful, okay?",
        "Lily: You do the same.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Cop: Did you say goodbye to your family?",
        "Holden: No, because I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Cop: Yeah, you are.",
        "Holden: No, I'm not!",
        "Molly: You can't take him away! Not yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Did you buy like the whole store?",
        "Lily: I thought we should have some snacks for the road.",
        "Faith: We're going to be late, Mom.",
        "Lily: I don't think so. But if we are late and Deanna's parents leave, I will take you the whole way, Sweetie.",
        "Faith: No, you can't do that.",
        "Lily: Why are you so wound up?",
        "Faith: Can we just go, please?",
        "Lily: Faith, do you want to tell me what's wrong?",
        "Faith: I'm stressed. The thing with Dad, all that.",
        "Lily: I think there's more to it than that.",
        "Faith: Mom, don't do the 20 questions, okay? Everything is fine.",
        "Lily: All right. I think we should call Deanna, tell her where we are, and find out what time her parents want to leave.",
        "Faith: No.",
        "Lily: No?",
        "Faith: Can we just get there already?",
        "Lily: Who is that text message from?",
        "Faith: No one.",
        "Lily: Faith Snyder, what in the world is going on with you?!",
        "Faith: It's nothing. It's just a text from Deanna.",
        "Lily: Your hands are shaking.",
        "Faith: It's cold.",
        "Lily: It's not that cold, and you're a wreck.",
        "Faith: I just want to go.",
        "Lily: Who sent you that text?",
        "Faith: I told you.",
        "Lily: And I don't believe you.",
        "Faith: Oh, my God, Mom.",
        "Lily: Who is Max? Is this boy threatening you?",
        "Faith: It's Deanna's father. He's waiting.",
        "Lily: You're lying to me.",
        "Faith: I'm not.",
        "Lily: Faith, why would you have Deanna's father programmed into your phone?",
        "Faith: [Voice breaking] Mom, I'm begging you.",
        "Lily: And I'm telling you, something is wrong with you. I can feel it. I can see it. Look, I can help you get out of whatever it is, baby. You just have to tell me the truth. Who is this Max? What does he want from you?",
        "Faith: There is no Max.",
        "Lily: Well, then, who is this?",
        "Faith: It's a code name, okay? Max is Damian. He's alive, and he wants to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: If you were being taken away from the woman you love, wouldn't you want five more minutes with her?",
        "Holden: Come on. Five minutes.",
        "Molly: Please. Thank you.",
        "Holden: You look scared. What is it?",
        "Molly: I just got back from Faith's school.",
        "Holden: Why? What would you be doing there?",
        "Molly: It's a long story, but the important part is that I found out that they let Faith go with her father -- or at least that's who they thought it was.",
        "Holden: So what exactly are you saying?",
        "Molly: Got the headmistress to describe the man who drove off with Faith. Holden, its Damian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Pregnant. Janet, uh, is pregnant.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: I don't know why I'm so -- I -- I guess I thought that the two of you had stopped. But she's your wife, you know, after all, so why --",
        "Jack: Carly, she was desperate to have a baby. We talked about this, the two of us. And I was torn about whether I should do anything or not, but then -- [Jack sighs] This wasn't something I thought would just happen.",
        "Carly: What's done is done.",
        "Jack: When Liberty found out what Janet wanted to do, she was furious. Are you okay?",
        "Carly: [Groans] I'm a little freaked out, if you want to know the truth.",
        "Jack: So am I. Before that phone rang --",
        "Carly: Everything seemed right again.",
        "Jack: It still is. I got to go see Janet.",
        "Carly: Hm, of course you do.",
        "Jack: Nothing's changed between us.",
        "Carly: Liar. This changes everything.",
        "Jack: No, not how we feel or where I want to be.",
        "Carly: But you need to go see your wife.",
        "Jack: Please, try --",
        "Carly: Try to understand. I know. Okay, I do, you know, all too well. I just don't like it. Go ahead, Jack. I understand. Just go, okay? Did you forget something?",
        "Jack: Yeah. This. I love you, Carly.",
        "Carly: I love you, Jack. So you'll have something to come back for again.",
        "Jack: [Chuckles] I have everything to come back for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You won't even consider it although it might be true?",
        "Janet: It's not.",
        "Dusty: You don't know that.",
        "Janet: I would know if I was pregnant from our one night together.",
        "Dusty: Would you? You've had a lot on your mind.",
        "Janet: Women know, Dusty. This baby is Jack's.",
        "Dusty: And what if it's mine? Let me ask you something. Would that be a bad thing?",
        "Janet: For my daughter's chances of survival? Yes, it would.",
        "Dusty: Oh. I can't pretend we didn't sleep together, and I can't pretend that I don't love you.",
        "Janet: Jack! Oh, thank you. Thank you.",
        "Jack: Janet --",
        "Janet: Look, I know this is confusing for everybody, but I just want -- I can't tell you how much I appreciate this gift that you have given Liberty and me.",
        "Jack: I feel like I walked in on the middle of something here.",
        "Dusty: You did. I was just congratulating Janet.",
        "Jack: Well, you know, it's what she wanted.",
        "Janet: Thank you, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I know what this means to you. I wish you the best.",
        "Janet: I know this is strange.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it really is.",
        "Janet: I know. But I want you to know that I will be forever grateful for what you've done for me and Liberty, and I'm not going to expect anything from you. I don't want anything from you.",
        "Jack: I know. No, I know that. But I want you to know that we're in this together, Janet.",
        "Janet: I know.",
        "Jack: I have no intention of walking away.",
        "Janet: Okay. And I -- I know that you're in love with Carly.",
        "Jack: Yes, I am.",
        "Janet: And I'm not going to use this baby to try and get you back.",
        "Jack: Well, I would hope not.",
        "Janet: So just to keep the lights clear, I think we should go back to what we were planning on doing before the baby came into play.",
        "Jack: And the marriage?",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Janet: I know this isn't how we pictured our future together. But I want you to know how much this means to me, and I'll never forget what you did for Liberty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, hi, Sweetheart. How was your day?",
        "Sage: Good. I have homework.",
        "Carly: Aw. Did you want a snack first before you start?",
        "Sage: Was dad here?",
        "Carly: Uh, yeah, he was.",
        "Sage: Why did he come when I was at school?",

        "Faith: He told me not to.",
        "Lily: I know! But -- but you have a mind of your own. He wasn't holding you hostage. Why didn't you come to me or your father?",
        "Faith: He came to get me at school, Mom. He said people were after him.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] You're just a child. How could he do this to you?",
        "Faith: He said you were in danger, too, and that's why he was pretending to be dead.",
        "Lily: He was lying to you. He's been lying all along.",
        "Faith: How was I supposed to know that? He said that if I didn't do what he told me to do that you could die.",
