        "Carly: I'll pick Parker up on my way home, okay? Oh, and do me a favor and see to it that he actually zips that jacket up. Yeah. Men of any age. You're absolutely right. All right, thanks again. Bye. Oh.",
        "Jordan: Oh.",
        "Carly: Oh, I am so sorry.",
        "Jordan: It's no problem.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: It is a problem. Look at you, you're soaking wet.",
        "Jordan: I'll dry, I'll dry.",
        "Carly: Well, please, let me pay the cleaning bill, okay? My name is --",
        "Jordan: Carly Tenney Snyder, and you could douse me in kerosene, and I would still be thrilled to finally meet you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey, angel.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. Looks like your back's feeling better.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Actually, I'm leaving in a couple of hours.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. I heard.",
        "Mike: Look, we already said good-bye.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I guess we did.",
        "Mike: There's nothing else left to say.",
        "Katie: I was just going to leave this for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Gavel bangs]",
        "Judge: Order! Quiet down, or I will clear the courtroom!",
        "Aaron: You're here.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry to interrupt, your honor, but I have to testify. What Clark did to Alison, he's done it before.",
        "Judge: You have personal knowledge that the defendant attacked another young woman?",
        "Hawk: Your honor, the defense was given no notice of this witness.",
        "Tom: On the contrary, your honor, Ms. Montgomery's name was on a list of possible witnesses during discovery.",
        "Hawk: Well, we were under the impression that she'd chosen to sit this one out.",
        "Tom: Well, I guess you were wrong, counselor.",
        "Judge: Answer the question, Ms. Montgomery.",
        "Lucy: Yes, your honor. I have personal knowledge.",
        "Judge: In that case, I will hear your testimony. Ms. Stewart, you may step down.",
        "Hawk: Your honor, I'm questioning this witness.",
        "Judge: You made your point and then some, counselor.",
        "Tom: Are you sure about this?",
        "Lucy: Yes.",
        "Tom: What made you change your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Whatever it is, I don't want it.",
        "Katie: But it's yours. I'm just returning it. I found it in the basement. You'd left it on the ledge? You probably took it off when you were fixing the water heater, or maybe you left it there on purpose, I don't know. Anyway, it's yours, and you should have it.",
        "Mike: And do what with it? It's got an inscription on the back -- \"all my love, Katie.\" And I know it's not your fault what happened, but you made a choice. This watch is kind of beside the point now, don't you think?",
        "Katie: I'm not gonna apologize for staying with my husband. But you have to understand that it had nothing to do with the way I felt about you. Simon's gone now, and now you're leaving. I don't blame you. I don't even know what I would do if I were in your shoes. But when I gave you that watch, I meant it. So you can wear it or sell it or throw it in the river if that's what you want to do. But it's yours. It was given freely, and I want you to have it. 'Cause I'm not just gonna pretend like this never happened. It meant too much to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: How is it that you know so much about me? Mr. Sinclair, is it?",
        "Jordan: Jordan, and knowing about you is part of my job description. See, you're the competition. I just signed on at B.R.O. As a matter of fact, I am about to meet with Barbara and her daughter to celebrate a bit of a coup.",
        "Carly: Ah, well, good for you. Congratulations. I'm gonna go.",
        "Barbara: I don't believe it. He's not here ten minutes, and she's already got her claws into him.",
        "Carly: Don't make a scene.",
        "Barbara: Me, make a scene?",
        "Carly: I really got to go.",
        "Jordan: Barbara, you know Carly?",
        "Barbara: We've met. Care to have a moment?",
        "Carly: Well, actually, no, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: It will only take a second. Excuse us, would you please, Jordan?",
        "Jordan: That was -- tense.",
        "Jennifer: Well, for a guy who said he's done his homework, you should know. My mother hates Carly Snyder.",
        "Carly: Calm down, Barbara! Jordan and I just met. I'm not trying to steal him away, although he'll probably leave on his own when he realizes what it's like to work with you.",
        "Barbara: This is not about Jordan, and you know it. You went to Paul for advice, and don't try and deny it, because he already told me all about it. You went to him for advice about starting up a fashion business. Well, you know what? You could have come to me. I would have told you everything you need to know -- quit now before you waste another cent of Rosanna's money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Lucy, you attend Oakdale Latin, where you are on the honors track?",
        "Lucy: Yes, I'm a senior taking advanced placement courses for college credit.",
        "Tom: So you're an excellent student. Member of the student council, the debate team, the headmaster's circle of honors --",
        "Hawk: Your honor, while I applaud Ms. Montgomery, must we be treated to a recitation of her entire high school resume?",
        "Tom: I'm happy to move on, your honor, as long as my colleague will stipulate that my witness is unimpeachable.",
        "Judge: It would appear that Ms. Montgomery's character makes her a trustworthy witness. Would you agree, Mr. Hawk?",
        "Hawk: If I might have a brief recess, your honor, to conduct my own investigation.",
        "Judge: Given Ms. Montgomery's standing in the community and at her school -- a school which maintains I'm sure you'll agree the highest standards -- I see no need for a recess.",
        "Tom: So Clark was welcome in your home?",
        "Lucy: He'd even met my grandmother.",
        "Tom: Your grandmother, Lucinda Walsh, had no problem with you spending time with Clark?",
        "Lucy: He wasn't her favorite, but I guess she assumed he was a gentleman.",
        "Hawk: Objection. Calls for speculation.",
        "Tom: I tend to agree with counselor. It's hard to imagine anyone would think of his client a gentleman.",
        "Judge: That's enough, Mr. Hughes.",
        "Tom: Please forgive me, your honor. So as you spent time at your home with Clark, having dinner occasionally, attending a wedding together, how would you classify his behavior?",
        "Lucy: He made it clear he wanted the relationship -- to get more intimate, I guess you would say.",
        "Tom: He wanted the two of you to have sex. And how did you respond?",
        "Lucy: I told him I wasn't interested in doing that with him.",
        "Tom: And after you told him that you did not wish to have a sexual relationship with him, did he continue to ask you out?",
        "Lucy: Yes.",
        "Tom: So as far as you were concerned, he understood your feelings on the matter?",
        "Lucy: I'd been pretty clear.",
        "Tom: So you felt safe, comfortable? You trusted him?",
        "Lucy: Yes.",
        "Alison: Why is he trying to make it sound like Clark's a good guy?",
        "Aaron: No, no, no, he's not. He's trying to show that what happened wasn't Lucy's fault.",
        "Tom: Lucy, you attended a party at a club called Metro with Clark, is that correct?",
        "Lucy: Yes.",
        "Tom: And at that party, he brought you something to drink?",
        "Lucy: Some soda.",
        "Tom: And how much alcohol was in that?",
        "Lucy: I don't drink. It was just soda.",
        "Tom: And after you drank that, what -- what happened?",
        "Hawk: Objection. Counsel is assuming a causal connection where none has been proven.",
        "Tom: I will rephrase. Lucy, you attended a party with Clark at a club called Metro, and the only thing you had to drink at that time was a soda that was brought to you by him, is that correct?",
        "Lucy: Yes.",
        "Tom: And moments later, what happened?",
        "Lucy: I started to feel dizzy and sick.",
        "Tom: And did you tell anyone how you felt?",
        "Lucy: Yes, some friends who were there. But Clark said he would take me home.",
        "Tom: What happened next?",
        "Lucy: Clark took me out to the car. I was feeling really dizzy. And then I must have passed out, because when I woke up, my coat was open and Clark was touching me and kissing me. I tried to pull him off. I told him no, but he said that he had waited long enough. He started trying to pull my dress up. I screamed, and the next thing I knew, Paul Ryan had yanked the car door open was pulling Clark off me.",
        "Tom: Thank you, Lucy. Your witness.",
        "Judge: Counselor?",
        "Hawk: Judge, while I acknowledge that Ms. Montgomery may have been on a preliminary list of possible witnesses, I never had an opportunity to depose her.",
        "Judge: I'm not granting you a continuance, counselor. Either cross-examine the witness or excuse her.",
        "Alison: What's going on?",
        "Aaron: They're going down, and they know it.",
        "Hawk: Your honor, may I approach?",
        "Judge: We'll take a ten-minute recess in my chambers.",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Alison: So what's going on?",
        "Tom: Clark changed his plea.",
        "Lucy: He's pleading guilty?",
        "Susan: It's about time.",
        "Emily: You girls did it. You nailed him.",
        "Alison: No, it wasn't me. It was all Lucy. Clark would've gotten off if it wasn't for you.",
        "Lucy: Please don't make me into something that I'm not. I almost didn't show up today.",
        "Alison: No, but you did show up. You always do the right thing, and that's why people believe you. Everyone thought that I was a liar up there till you came. You're the best.",
        "Susan: I second that. Thank you so much.",
        "Emily: Lucy, we know how hard this was on you. We appreciate it so much.",
        "Lucy: I'm glad things worked out.",
        "Paul: You -- you really did do a wonderful thing.",
        "Tom: Lucy, if you'd like to go home, I foresee no problem. The judge has accepted Clark's change in plea, and I've given him my sentencing recommendations.",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "Tom: No, thank you.",
        "Paul: You want to get out of here?",
        "Lucy: Please.",
        "Aaron: Lucy, wait! I just wanted to thank you. Thank you. You were -- you were so amazing up there.",
        "Lucy: Aaron, you need to understand something. I know that you and Alison and everyone in there think that I am some sort of hero for showing up today, but I almost didn't come here.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but you did do it, and everybody understands why you didn't want to.",
        "Lucy: Because of you, Aaron. I didn't want to testify today because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Well, I knew that Barbara and Carly had a professional rivalry, but I assumed it was just that -- professional. I had no idea that they had made it personal.",
        "Jennifer: Well, one thing that you'll learn, if you last, is that everything in my mother's life is personal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You are making way too much of this, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: No, just nipping it in the bud, Carly. You see, you forget I know you. I know how you operate. I know how you sidle up to men and bat those big old blues. And normally, Paul would be immune, but he's suffered great losses recently.",
        "Carly: You mean the death of his fianc\u00e9?",
        "Barbara: And the relationship with your sister, Rosanna, which I'm sure you've exploited. He's susceptible. That's why this is gonna stop now. Paul works for B.R.O. he works for me. All of his energies lie with me.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sure he'll be very happy to know that he's your slave. But then, given the way you normally treat your children, perhaps that's a step up.",
        "Barbara: You stay away from him.",
        "Carly: Or what, Barbara? What are you gonna do? I've already survived you cutting up my designs, sending me off to some hell spa, stealing my former company.",
        "Barbara: You stole my line.",
        "Carly: Must I remind you again? All you had were a few sketches that I never even saw. Those clothes were mine, and they were good. And that's what this is really about. You're scared. You know that I understand the market in a way you never will, and you know that my designs are just as good as yours, if not a little better. But not to worry, you can keep Paul, and your cute little boy toy over there. I'll just take your market share.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Mom, are you okay?",
        "Barbara: Oh, I'm fine. I'm just fine.",
        "Jordan: Great, then why don't I go get the champagne?",
        "Barbara: No, you can sit right there. The champagne will wait. You and I are gonna have a little conversation.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I wasn't afraid to testify.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but you said --",
        "Lucy: I know what I said, but after I talked to Madison and a friend, I realized that I wasn't afraid of the defense attorney or the publicity. I was afraid of getting all involved with you and Alison all over again.",
        "Aaron: We were doing this for you.",
        "Lucy: I know, but I asked you not to. And you didn't listen to me. You got her involved, and when you let her get hurt, I was really angry. But I realized that I couldn't let that stop me from testifying, so I showed up. That doesn't change the way that I feel, Aaron. We're over, and you need to accept that. I don't want to be your girlfriend. I don't want to be your friend.",
        "Aaron: What do you want?",
        "Lucy: To move on. And I have. But now you need to do the same thing. Good-bye, Aaron.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Mom, I just wanted to thank you for coming today.",
        "Kim: Honey, I am so glad I was here. Your father would have been here, too, except he had the appointment at the Kipling foundation.",
        "Chris: I know. He told me.",
        "Kim: Listen, we realize how important Alison is to you, and that makes her important to us. We really want to be supportive.",
        "Alison: It was really great of you to be here, and I'm so sorry that you had to hear all those awful things about me, but I want you to know that I'm changing. I'm not like that anymore.",
        "Kim: Ali, you were just terrific today. I'm so proud of you. You really showed great courage.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but he almost got away with that, because of all the terrible things I did when I was a kid.",
        "Kim: You know, that's the thing. You and I have to remember you're not a kid anymore. From now on, you are a very brave young woman. And we've got to celebrate.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Chris: That's a great idea.",
        "Kim: Okay? I tell you what. I'll go get something for dinner from Al's, and I'll meet you guys at home, okay?",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Kim: Honey, call your Dad and let him know.",
        "Chris: Yes, I'm on it.",
        "Kim: Okay, bye.",
        "Chris: Bye.",
        "Susan: Hey. I'm so proud of you.",
        "Alison: It's my first good ending, you know?",
        "Susan: Yeah, I know. And you're doing so well with Chris and with his family. They're lucky to have you. You know, I really should get going.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Susan: No, no, no, you've got all these people who want to talk to you, and there's something that I've got to do. I'll call you later?",
        "Alison: Okay, thanks. Aaron, I thought you left.",
        "Aaron: No.",
        "Alison: Did you talk to Lucy?",
        "Aaron: She went home.",
        "Alison: Is everything okay?",
        "Aaron: Let's put it this way -- if I had any hope that she would change her mind about us getting back together, I don't anymore. When she said good-bye, she meant forever this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Grandmother? She must not be back, yet.",
        "Paul: You sure you're gonna be okay here by yourself?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'm fine. And thanks for all the support, coming to the courthouse and driving me home.",
        "Paul: I'm just gonna double check and make sure that there's somebody here.",
        "Lucy: No, you don't have to do that.",
        "Paul: No, I know I don't have to, but -- [Lucy sobs] There's someone in the kitchen, so I'm guessing she works -- Lucy.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry, I'm fine.",
        "Paul: No, you're not. Come here, come here. It's all right. It's all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: So, you're running away, macho man.",
        "Mike: Hey, come on in. I was gonna drop the key by.",
        "Lucinda: I don't want it. And if you leave Oakdale, you are not the man that I know.",
        "Mike: Lucinda, it's time for me to move on.",
        "Lucinda: Why? Why, because Katie's husband has made himself inconvenient? Oh, well, he's gone. She's all alone. It just seems to me, an outsider, that if you could just swallow that stubborn pride of yours, you could have everything you ever wanted.",
        "Mike: It's not pride.",
        "Lucinda: Then what is it?",
        "Mike: You know, I've learned a couple things over the years, and love is rare, okay?",
        "Lucinda: Precisely.",
        "Mike: And see, if it's ever gonna work out, then two people need to want it exactly the same.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, darling, so young. Rarely do two people ever want the same thing, the same way, at the same time. But for heaven's sake, if you find some love, oh, hang onto it. Life is too short for perfection.",
        "Mike: But the thing is I had it and I will not settle for less.",
        "Lucinda: I'm really sorry if Katie, you know, disappointed you in some way. Mike, you've got guts. You stick it out and you keep working on it.",
        "Mike: You're gonna miss me, aren't you?",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: I'm never gonna forgive you. Oh, you're so cute. You're just adorable. But I'm never, ever gonna forgive you, okay? And I'm leaving now. This -- you remember our tree problem? The workmen left this box, and I'm presuming this is your stuff.",
        "Mike: Yeah, been lookin' all over for this.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Mike: It's got my cufflinks in it.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, cufflinks, my heavens, men are so bad at cufflinks. They're better with their socks. The single cufflinks that I've known in my life. What? What's that? What? Oh, that's Katie's engagement ring? I'm sorry, darling.",
        "Mike: No, it's all right. It's all right. I was just remembering something someone told me about -- about a gift freely given.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey!",
        "Katie: Hey! So, shall we go ice skating, or what about bowling? Bowling's good. I like the shoes. No, you know what? Mani-pedi, my treat. I'm gonna change my whole look I think.",
        "Margo: Well, why don't you shave your head? You're still gonna miss him.",
        "Katie: Oh, Margo, what am I gonna do? He's leaving today.",
        "Margo: Well, have you tried talking to him?",
        "Katie: I've tried. It's no use. He -- Mike just feels hurt because I picked Simon over him.",
        "Margo: Oh, it wasn't over him.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, that's the way mike feels.",
        "Margo: How does this feel now then, huh?",
        "Katie: Would you be able to marry someone if you knew that they loved someone else? Mike feels second best. I don't blame him.",
        "Margo: He is absolutely not second best. Michael would make a much better husband than Simon ever -- well, did. That's what we're really talking about, isn't it?",
        "Katie: What do you mean a better husband?",
        "Margo: Oh, baby, the love that you had with Simon, it just -- it never would have lasted. I mean, not only was the guy running for his life, but he just isn't the kind of person that would ever settle down. And a woman -- any woman, particularly a woman with not one, but two bunnies, wants to settle down. Mike is a settle down kind of guy. He builds houses. He wants to make a home.",
        "Katie: Oh, I wish you hadn't brought up bunnies. Snickers, is gonna miss him so much.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, Snickers is not the only one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I think this is pretty normal after the day that you've had.",
        "Lucy: What? Testifying or seeing Aaron?",
        "Paul: Probably both. Lucy, you were under a lot of pressure in that courtroom. It couldn't have been easy for you to relive what happened. You add Aaron to all of that, and --",
        "Lucy: I guess.",
        "Paul: So, what's that?",
        "Lucy: Oh, it's just this thing from Williams College.",
        "Paul: A thing from William's College?",
        "Lucy: After everything fell apart with Aaron I realized that I really did want to go to a good school, maybe even grad school. Anyway --",
        "Paul: Okay, are you going to make me turn over the waste paper basket or are you going to tell me what was on the postcard?",
        "Lucy: It's was a confirmation for an interview --",
        "Paul: Well, not for admissions, that was done weeks ago.",
        "Lucy: No, I did all that already. It's for this fellowship that I applied for.",
        "Paul: Lucy, what's the problem?",
        "Lucy: It's tomorrow -- at Williams. And with Rosanna gone and my grandmother tied up with Lily -- I don't want my father anywhere near this. Probably bribe the dean. So I don't get the fellowship, I'll live.",
        "Paul: No, hold on a second. You're going to get the fellowship, because you're going to go to the interview. Because I'm going to take you there.",
        "Lucy: I can't ask you to do that --",
        "Paul: You didn't. I'm volunteering. We'll leave early in the morning, we'll take my plane, you'll do your interview and we'll be back by dinner.",
        "Lucy: You'd do that for me?",
        "Paul: I'm doing that for you. End of discussion.",
        "Lucy: Thank you. Thank you, so much.",

        "Barbara: Oh yeah, Carly Tenney is driven, I'll give you that. But by what? Her personal life, which is in a shambles. She'd much rather throw herself out there than to confront the disaster she has at home. All those children she has -- the men are lining up for paternity suits. It's a low-rent nightmare, but instead of fixing her marriage, making sure her that children have a stable home, she's decided to come after me. Now, I don't blame her at all. It's much easier to steal my designs than become a decent mother, but it doesn't make her a bankable star --",
        "Jordan: Why are you telling me all this?",
        "Barbara: So you can understand what just happened here.",
        "Jordan: What just happened is, I was waiting here for you and Jennifer and I ran into Carly. It was a random event --",
        "[Barbara laughs]",
        "Barbara: No, it wasn't there is no such thing as a random event with Carly Tenney.",
        "Jordan: What are you saying? That she planned this?",
        "Barbara: Oh yeah, if it wasn't this she'd be backing into your car or making sure her nightgown was slipped into your dry cleaning.",
        "Jordan: Really? Well, maybe I should run right up and send out some suits, then.",
        "Barbara: You're not listening to me --",
        "Jordan: I am, Barbara, I am. Carly has been nipping at your heels for some time now. She's talented, but inexperienced and not above playing some games. I shouldn't underestimate her, and I won't. She's your business rival and I will treat her accordingly.",
        "Barbara: She's not my business rival. She can't rival B.R.O. Carly Tenney is my enemy, which makes her your enemy. Do you understand that?",
        "Jordan: I didn't come to Oakdale to make enemies or settle scores.",
        "Barbara: I thought you came here to work for me.",
        "Jordan: I did. And you have my complete focus and my undivided loyalty. But I will not be your attack dog, or any other kind of dog. And if that's what you want, you're gonna have to find yourself another boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, Barbara, and your lovely daughter. I'm sure our paths will cross sometime in the near future --",
        "Barbara: Sit down. Please. I'm sorry, I lost my temper. And you're right. Carly has been nipping at my heels and it's quite annoying. But I shouldn't have allowed it to get to me, and I shouldn't have taken it out on you.",
        "Jordan: Right on both counts. Carly is no threat to you Barbara. She's talented and maybe someday, somewhere, she'll make it, but she doesn't have the whole package and you do. So, stop wasting your time on her.",
        "Barbara: All right. So then, I have your loyalty?",
        "Jordan: B.R.O. has my loyalty. You have my friendship.",
        "Barbara: Well, that'll have to do, won't it?",
        "Jordan: And this won't come up again?",
        "Barbara: Why should it? We understand each other.",
        "Jennifer: Great. I am so glad we've got that settled. Now Mom, why don't you go to the bar and ask the maitre d' if he has that nice bottle of champagne that you like so much?",
        "Barbara: Splendid idea. We can do great things.",
        "Jordan: I wouldn't be here if we couldn't. What, you don't like my tie? I think the glass of wine improved it.",
        "Jennifer: You stood up to her.",
        "Jordan: Your mother? She needs standing up to. She is a strong, talented woman, but she's not always right. If we're going to succeed, really succeed, it gonna take all of our input.",
        "Jennifer: You keep surprising me.",
        "Jordan: Well, I hope that's a good thing.",

        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Kim: Now, this has been a long day --",
        "Susan: I wanna make an apology. I know I've been -- I've made assumptions about your attitude toward my daughter and that's why I've been so hostile. But in the end, you've been more than fair and I have to acknowledge that. My daughter is not perfect. She didn't have a perfect childhood. She didn't have a perfect mother, and I think that was painfully obvious on the stand today. She's made some poor choices.",
        "Kim: Who hasn't?",
        "Susan: But you could've taken that as proof positive that you were right not to want your son involved with a girl who has so much baggage. Instead you were kind, you were supportive and you seemed very willing to give my daughter a second chance.",
        "Kim: Of course, of course. I'm absolutely ready and willing. That goes for the two of us, too.",
        "Susan: Well, that's wonderful, uh -- but I have to say that -- I don't get it. Given our history, why you would be so willing to open your heart to my daughter?",
        "Kim: My son loves her. And I love my son.",

        "Alison: That isn't your fault --",
        "Aaron: Yeah, Ali, that's just the way it is.",
        "Emily: Hey, listen, I gotta go, I'm sorry. I've got like 20-plus pages I gotta edit. I'm sorry. I love you. I'm so proud of you.",
        "Alison: Oh, thank you so much.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I gotta go, too.",
        "Alison: Both of you, I am -- I couldn't have done it without you.",
        "Chris: How're you feeling?",
        "Alison: A little blown away, but good.",
        "Chris: Ali, um, I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time about testifying.",
        "Alison: You were right.",
        "Chris: That's not the point. Okay, once you and I talked things through and you made up your mind -- I should have supported that, but no, no. I had to hold on to what I wanted. Okay, and I feel really bad. I was wrong.",
        "Alison: Look, if you'd had to take the stand about some medical thing, and I knew that they were gonna tear into you about something, I wouldn't like it either. That's what happens when you care about someone. You want to protect them.",
        "Chris: I know, and I don't wanna hold you back from taking chances that could really pay off, like today. So, from now on, how about we check our fears at the door and really show up for each other.",
        "Alison: It's a deal.",

        "Paul: Well, nice to know some things never change.",
        "Carly: Well, thanks to you, I knew what to say. But I think for a minute there she knew the truth, Paul. That you and I are planning to take B.R.O. away from her.",
        "Paul: She has no idea.",
        "Carly: But the real problem is that she hates me, and she's watching me or she's having me watched. For all I know, I've got P.I.s following me around. \"Carly went to the pre-school. Carly went to pick up the dry-cleaning. What a fascinating life Carly leads.\" I'm can't -- I can't even think about clothes right now, let alone design 'em. And when are you and I gonna have an opportunity to talk? Never, right? It's not gonna work.",
        "Paul: Stop, soon. I know it, you'll need oxygen.",
        "Carly: No, what I need is -- I don't know what I need. I need a safe place. A place where Barbara isn't. So we can talk, so I can show you what I've been working on. We can exchange ideas. We can work on it right there while we're together talking.",
        "Paul: Okay, I know this is gonna sound a little crazy, but I think I have the perfect solution.",
        "Paul: I have to take this little trip to Massachusetts tomorrow. Why don't you come with me? We'll have a few hours together on the plane, a few hours while Lucy has her interview --",
        "Carly: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Lucy Montgomery?",
        "Paul: Sure, I promised Rosanna that I'd look after Lucy while Rosanna was gone. Lucy needs someone to take her to her interview, so --",
        "Carly: What if Lucy tells her father that you and I --",
        "Paul: Her father is out of the loop right now, but I'll make sure she doesn't mention it to anyone.",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, I'm gonna need to talk to Jack, and try to find a sitter -- can I call you?",
        "Paul: Sure.",

        "Lucy: I was fine.",
        "Lucinda: I don't think that was very responsible of him to pressure you into testifying.",
        "Lucy: He didn't pressure me, grandmother. He just encouraged me to do the right thing. Clark was the one who attacked me.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I'm aware of that, darling, and you're so brave. I'm proud that you fought back. I think I'm feeling guilty 'cause I didn't help. Oh, by the way, your appointment at Williams, um, I'm going to have my pilot fly you, okay?",
        "Lucy: You don't have to do that.",
