        "Cary is cleaning up her damaged kitchen, as she eyes a bottle of Vodka and is about to drink some when she is interrupted by Jack wanting to discuss how Parker can start school at the Academy on Monday. Brad and Katie tell Liberty about how they are going to try to have a baby with help from Vienna; at first, she is worried, but then she is happy for them. Their happiness is interrupted when Janet comes by wondering why Liberty hasn't told them about the events from the other day. Liberty tries to stop her, but Janet spills the beans and Brad is irate and wants to go teach Parker a lesson again. Janet informs them all that Jack is taking care of it because Parker is being sent to boarding school. Everyone is shocked and Liberty pleads with Janet to change Jack's mind. Janet thinks it is for the best because she is worried that Liberty is ruining her life. Liberty wants her to stop comparing them, as she races out in a huff. Parker overhears his parents talking about sending him to boarding school and doesn't react well at all, as he tells them how much he hates them before he races out. Carly and Jack worry about the ramifications of this decision. Parker is given his friend's car keys since he is going to Florida. Parker tells Liberty about what is going on and thinks that they need to leave town because that is the only way they can be together. Liberty isn't sure, but is convinced when Parker tells him that he loves her, as she admits she does too. They arrange to head out of town and meet up shortly. Carly, who is considering taking a drink of Vodka to calm her nerves, is interrupted when Parker comes home pretending that he is going to give the boarding school a try. Carly offers to give him a going away party, as Parker goes upstairs to pack unbeknownst to her \u0096 right after he steals money from her purse. Liberty tells Brad that she was thinking and is going to try to stay away from Parker. She is heading to the mall with some friends and subtly asks some money to \u0091shop.' Liberty says her goodbye without Brad knowing. Parker slips out claiming he is going to play basketball, as Carly is busy cooking. Dusty thinks about his time he spent with Lucy and Johnny. Craig realizes that Johnny's drawn picture of \u0091daddy' is of Dusty. He then realizes that Dusty has been visiting when Lucy has been watching him, so he sets a trap by asking Lucy to baby-sit again that day. Lucy calls Dusty to invite him to spend time with them. Craig shows up as they are all hanging gout and reads them the riot act. Lucy tries to get him to understand, but Craig assures her that he will never allow her to betray him again; he also intends on never allowing her or Dusty near Johnny again; he tells her that he no longer has a daughter. Lucy seems distraught and worries about Dusty not being able to see Johnny anymore as well, as if he is going to send her to jail because of that. He tells her not to worry about that and as far as Johnny is concerned, they have a bond with him that Craig can't break and they will see him soon no matter what. Craig learns of Jack and Carly's decision and thinks it is a bad one and she is doing it to appease Jack. Carly kicks him out, as he jokes that she is afraid that what happened between them the other night might happen again. Later, Carly swallows down some Vodka. Katie wants to make love, but Brad wants to save himself to make his deposit at the lab; he also hopes Vienna is doing the same, as Katie starts to feel left out of this equation, but Brad reminds her that this was her decision and he is doing it to make her happy, as Katie looks slightly concerned. Janet assures Jack, who is still having misgivings about his decision, that he is definitely doing the right thing by both their kids. Parker and Liberty meet, as she wonders again if this is the right choice. Parker is sure of it, as they start to leave when Johnny sees them. They talk with him a moment before he leaves with his babysitter after he sounds out Parker's car's license plate \u0096 Booboo."

        "Liberty: Okay. I'm half asleep, is this a dream?",
        "Katie: It -- well because of some physical problems, I can't conceive a baby. So, Vienna's going to have one for me.",
        "Brad: For us.",
        "Liberty: Wow. Vienna, cool. Who's taking care of the getting her preggers part?",
        "Brad: I am.",
        "Liberty: Whoa. That is -- and you're cool with it?",
        "Brad: No. No, no physical contact required.",
        "Katie: Um, yeah, Vienna's going to give us an egg.",
        "Brad: Yeah, we're renting out her womb and it'll all come together in the lab.",
        "Katie: Vienna will be implanted and then we'll have our baby.",
        "Liberty: Wow. But if it's not your egg, you're going to feel like it's not really your baby?",
        "Katie: Of course it's my baby. It's just another way of having a family. Like adoption, but faster.",
        "Liberty: Wow. Well --",
        "Brad: It's a biological connection.",
        "Liberty: That is great. And you're really cool with it?",
        "Katie: Of course I am.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I still can't believe it happened.",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "Jack: That Parker could do something like this, just blows me away.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, he didn't start a fire on purpose. You know, he knows he was wrong.",
        "Jack: Have the kids gone to school?",
        "Carly: Sage has. Parker's got the day off.",
        "Jack: I assume he's still sleeping?",
        "Carly: You got it.",
        "Jack: We should probably wake him up. He's got to get ready.",
        "Carly: What for?",
        "Jack: Eastlake boarding school.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: I made some calls. They're willing to take him mid-semester. He can start classes first thing Monday morning.",
        "Carly: You're not serious.",
        "Jack: As serious as I was the other day, Carly.",
        "Carly: Wait. Jack. I thought you said what you said sort of in the heat of the moment. That you were trying to frighten Parker into straightening up.",
        "Jack: Well, we've seen how well that's worked.",
        "Carly: Yeah, but boarding school? It was hard enough when J.J. left, and he wanted to go. Parker's a completely different story.",
        "Jack: Parker is out of control, Carly. He needs this. We need this.",
        "Carly: Well, we can't afford Eastlake. We can barely afford one tuition. Sending both the boys will bankrupt us.",
        "Jack: We can use the money that your sister put in trust for Parker for his education.",
        "Carly: Parker's not going to like this.",
        "Jack: Too bad. He's going to Eastlake and that's all there is to it.",
        "Parker: No way, Dad. I'm not going anywhere!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: So when are you getting started with this little medical miracle?",
        "Katie: As soon as possible.",
        "Liberty: I'm really happy for you, Katie.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Katie: Aw, thank you, Sweetie.",
        "Brad: Look who's here. Hey.",
        "Janet: What, because of the other day's drama you don't think you don't think you have to go to school anymore?",
        "Liberty: Its teacher conference, today, Mom. The whole high school's off.",
        "Brad: What do you mean drama?",
        "Liberty: Hey, Mom, did you hear? Brad and Katie are going to have a baby.",
        "Brad: Not yet.",
        "Katie: But soon and we are very happy that Liberty's 100% behind us.",
        "Janet: You didn't tell them, did you?",
        "Brad: Tell me what?",
        "Liberty: Mom, can you just try and be happy for them maybe?",
        "Janet: Hey, don't make me the bad guy here. He is your father and he has a right to know.",
        "Brad: Know what? Can someone tell me what's going on here?",
        "Janet: Brad, I'm really happy that you and Katie are having a child. But before you do, you need to take care of the one you've already got.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, you sure did a great job on that breakfast. So I'm going to keep up my end of the bargain. What's on the agenda today, another portrait?",
        "Johnny: What's a portrait?",
        "Craig: Well, a portrait is when you draw a picture of someone. Like when you showed me this yesterday, and I said, \"Who's this?\" And you said, \"It's Daddy.\" Or maybe it's your other daddy? Johnny, its okay. You can tell me if it is. I won't be mad. Is this Dusty? Well, it's a very good likeness. Did you show it to him? I bet he was really happy about it, wasn't he? Yeah, well, you know what? Now you have to draw a picture of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lucy: I was just about to call you.",
        "Craig: Is that so?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I really had a good time yesterday hanging with you and Johnny.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm glad to hear it because I need to ask you another favor.",
        "Lucy: What's up?",
        "Craig: Well that meeting that was canceled yesterday has rescheduled for today. So I was wondering if you could sit with Johnny again?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, definitely. Uh, good timing too, because I just finished my shift. I can be there in 10 minutes?",
        "Craig: We'll be waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Johnny: Johnny, guess what? Your big sister's going to come and stay with you. And maybe she'll bring company again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Dusty remembering]",
        "Craig: Today, painting. Tomorrow, sculpting. I want you to put me on Mount Rushmore!",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Lucy: Yeah right!",
        "Dusty: Nice try.",
        "Lucy: Hey! Oh. Yeah.",
        "[Lucy laughing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Dusty: Hey, I was just going to call you.",
        "Lucy: You were?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I wanted to thank you again for yesterday. I really enjoyed spending time with Johnny.",
        "Lucy: Well, you're hitting the jackpot because my father just called me and asked me to watch him again. Can you get away?",
        "Dusty: Of course, that's one of the advantages of being boss.",
        "Lucy: Great. I'm headed out right now.",
        "Dusty: Should I meet you there?",
        "Lucy: You know, let's meet in your room this time. I mean, after last time when he almost caught us, I don't want to take any chances.",
        "Dusty: Good point.",
        "Lucy: Okay, well, I'll see you in 20 minutes, okay?",
        "Dusty: I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey.",
        "Dusty: So glad to see you. I hope you're hungry.",
        "Lucy: I think he just finished breakfast.",
        "Dusty: Well, I hope he's got room for milk and cookies. I hope you do, too.",
        "Lucy: God, these visits are lethal. I'm going to have to go on a crash diet.",
        "Dusty: Get out of here, you look great. Hey, there's something in that bag with your name on it. You like it?",
        "Lucy: I used to love those things! Where you draw a picture and then you can erase it, just like that.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, we leave no evidence behind for Craig, that way.",
        "Lucy: Ah, good point. But you got to stop buying Johnny gifts or he's going to expect one every time you see him.",
        "Dusty: Oh, that's all right. I'll buy him anything. Making up for lost time.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, that's my fault, I know.",
        "Dusty: I have time now because of you.",
        "Lucy: Well, you didn't really leave me a choice.",
        "Dusty: You could have said no.",
        "Lucy: Face your wrath? No, thanks.",
        "Dusty: I appreciate you coming through for me.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, if it makes Johnny happy, it's worth it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I don't mean to rain on anybody's parade.",
        "Liberty: Then don't.",
        "Brad: Go ahead, Janet. Rain.",
        "Liberty: Dad, this is so not important, especially compared to your good news.",
        "Brad: I'll be the judge of that.",
        "Janet: Well, it may not be good news. But when you sleep with a boy, and you skip school, and you nearly burn his mother's house down in the process it's definitely important news.",
        "Brad: Whoa! You did that?",
        "Liberty: No, she's definitely making it sound a lot worse than it actually was.",
        "Janet: And where exactly am I exaggerating, young lady?",
        "Brad: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait. Boy -- boy? You mean Parker?",
        "Liberty: Dad --",
        "Brad: Again?",
        "Liberty: Let me explain, really.",
        "Brad: What -- well, I don't understand what the hell's wrong with this kid.",
        "Liberty: No, nothing's wrong with him.",
        "Brad: Except that he can't keep his hands off you.",
        "Liberty: Well, he didn't do anything that I didn't want him to do.",
        "Brad: Ah! Okay, oh, damn it, Liberty.",
        "Janet: I told you he needed to know.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, Mom, and you needed to ruin my life. So, mission accomplished!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I made one small mistake.",
        "Jack: One small mistake? You just about burned down your mother's house.",
        "Parker: It was an accident. And I'm really sorry. Just please don't make me go to that stupid boarding school.",
        "Jack: You're not giving us much choice.",
        "Parker: You can't use my own money to make me do something that I don't want to do.",
        "Carly: Well, it's not your money. Not until you're 21. Until then, your father and I get to decide how to spend it.",
        "Parker: Well, then, why don't you just lock me in a closet? That way you won't have to spend any money.",
        "Jack: It's not like we're sending you to prison. It's a top-rated school. It even has a nationally ranked tennis team.",
        "Carly: Yes. I bet they'd be so happy to have you play for them, Parker. Look, you know, you might actually like it.",
        "Parker: No, I won't. I'll hate it. Almost as much as I hate you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hey, is that supposed to be us?",
        "Dusty: How'd you know that?",
        "Lucy: Oh, well, you see how big that guy's head is? I remember when it used to be bigger.",
        "Dusty: Are you going to let her talk to me like that?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Dusty: No cookies for you. More cookies for us. Yes. Thank you.",
        "Lucy: Daddy.",
        "Johnny: Daddy!",
        "Craig: Hey! Oh.",
        "Lucy: I can explain.",
        "Craig: No need to. It's pretty clear what's going on here. Johnny, its okay. Everything's going to be fine. In fact, I have a surprise for you. Remember Olga, the babysitter from the hotel? Well, she's going to take you to that brand new playground across the street. They've got a rock climbing wall and one of those wobbly bridges --",
        "Dusty: You don't have to --",
        "Craig: Olga? Go ahead, son.",
        "Dusty: You're going to love that rock-climbing wall.",
        "Johnny: We don't have to keep it a secret anymore, right?",
        "Lucy: That's right. Go ahead.",
        "Craig: I'll see you later. Have fun.",
        "Lucy: Dad, please --",
        "Craig: I trusted you. And you betrayed me, again!",
        "Dusty: She did it for me.",
        "Craig: Oh, I'm sure she did. It's easy to see, you two have been in this from the beginning.",
        "Dusty: Wrong.",
        "Craig: You didn't come back here to revive your medical career. You came back here to help him get Johnny away from me.",
        "Lucy: No, I've been --",
        "Craig: Well, it's not going to happen! After today, I will make sure that neither one of you ever lays eyes on that boy again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: That was the school. They think they can arrange it for J.J. and Parker to room together. I'm going to start getting his things together.",
        "Carly: Jack. I think we should talk about this. It was a really hasty decision. And if Parker is so dead set against it --",
        "Jack: If you can think of another solution, Carly, please, I'm all ears.",
        "Carly: You can't just spring this on me and expect me to come up with the perfect solution just like that.",
        "Jack: Because there isn't one. Parker and Liberty just need to be separated. Even Janet agrees, that's necessary.",
        "Carly: Well, then why isn't Liberty sent away to boarding school?",
        "Jack: Because -- she doesn't have a trust fund to pay for it. Do you think I want this? I don't. But I'm at the end of my rope here. I've done everything I can to try to get through to that boy, and nothing works. I can only hope, that he stops hating us long enough to realize that this was for his own good.",
        "Carly: What if Craig is right? What if we're punishing Parker for being a normal kid --",
        "Jack: Is that where you're getting your parental advice these days? From a man whose own children can barely speak to him?",
        "Carly: Where are you getting yours, Jack? Janet? I hope not. 'Cause you want to send our son away 'cause she can't handle her own kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: How many times do I have to warn Parker to stay away from her?",
        "Katie: Where are you going?",
        "Brad: To teach that boy a lesson, once and for all.",
        "Liberty: No, Dad!",
        "Katie: No, no, no, you're not going anywhere.",
        "Brad: Someone's got to do something.",
        "Janet: Jack already has. He's sending Parker away to boarding school.",
        "Katie and Brad: What?",
        "Liberty: No way!",
        "Janet: Way.",
        "Liberty: Mom, please. You -- you have to talk to Jack. You have to tell him what a horrible idea that is. I mean --",
        "Janet: I'm not so sure it is.",
        "Liberty: How could you even say that?",
        "Janet: Honey, Jack is doing you a favor. He is keeping you from throwing your life away on some guy when you should be focusing on your future and college.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, maybe you couldn't like a guy without letting it ruining your life, but I can, Mom.",
        "Brad: Hey, watch it, Libby.",
        "Janet: All it takes is one little mistake.",
        "Liberty: Oh, God. Not this again, Mom, please.",
        "Janet: No, really. Look at me! Do you want to end up like me? You want to be a waitress for the rest of your life? I threw my life away. I threw away high school, college, my career, all so that I could sleep with some jerk.",
        "Brad: Hey, wait a minute --",
        "Janet: Hey, you were a jerk, Bradley, and you know it.",
        "Brad: Well, maybe I was. But that was a long time ago.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it was a long time ago. Good job for noticing that, 'cause obviously my mom can't get past it because if you would, you'd see that I'm not you and Parker's not dad. So stop trying to tell us how to live our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gus: Hey, Dude, what's up?",
        "Parker: Hey, Gus.",
        "Gus: So, you excited about spring break in Lauderdale?",
        "Parker: Well, I would be -- if I was going. I got into some trouble and my dad went postal. So, while you guys are having fun on the beach, I'll be stuck on this bench.",
        "Gus: Oh. Here, you want to borrow my car while I'm gone?",
        "Parker: Are you serious?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Just gas her up and she's all yours.",
        "Parker: Cool.",
        "Gus: She's parked outside the school. All right?",
        "Parker: Thanks, man. Hey!",
        "Liberty: Hey, you can't be smiling.",
        "Parker: Why not?",
        "Liberty: 'Cause you're getting shipped off to boarding school! Aren't you even mad?",
        "Parker: Well, I would be, if I was going.",
        "Liberty: Did you talk your dad out of it?",
        "Parker: Yeah, right.",
        "Liberty: Well, then how are you gonna dodge it?",
        "Parker: I'm going to leave town before they can send me.",
        "Liberty: What? You're leaving?",
        "Parker: Yeah. And you're coming with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So just when were you going to make your great escape? Next week? Tomorrow? This afternoon?",
        "Lucy: We had no intention of taking Johnny anywhere.",
        "Dusty: If we were going to do that, we would have been gone by now.",
        "Lucy: I just wanted Johnny to be able to spend time with people who care about him.",
        "Craig: Did you also want him to learn how to lie? Didn't he have enough of that when he was on the run with you all that time?",
        "Lucy: I didn't think it was fair to deprive him of people who love him.",
        "Craig: You didn't think it was fair or Dusty didn't? Wouldn't be the first time he's turned you against me.",
        "Lucy: No, you're wrong! Dusty wanted to be open about this from the beginning. I was the one who thought we should wait until you could handle it.",
        "Craig: Oh, so it was for my benefit that you went behind my back?",
        "Lucy: I thought, in time, you'd see that Dusty isn't a threat.",
        "Craig: The day I share my son with Dusty Donovan is the day hell freezes over.",
        "Lucy: You know, this reaction is exactly the reason that I was afraid to tell you.",
        "Craig: You can't see that he's using you? All these milk and cookie moments? It's just to get what he wants from you.",
        "Dusty: You know, I don't blame you for being angry. But you got to admit, Lucy's got a point. For Johnny's sake, we got to work things out.",
        "Craig: No -- ha! Oh, that's rich, coming from you. 'Cause we both know that if you'd won custody, you wouldn't let me within 100 yards of that boy. You know, I shouldn't have to point out to either one of you that when I won custody of Johnny, I also won the right to decide who he does and who he does not see.",
        "Dusty: Johnny loves us. You can try to take him away from us. But one day, he'll hate you for it.",
        "Craig: Is that supposed to scare me? Because it doesn't. Johnny will be just fine without either one of you. And I'll make sure of it.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, please, don't. Don't blame Dusty for my mistake. All he wants is to see his little boy.",
        "Craig: You know, that's all I ever wanted. Every minute of every day you kept him from me. How am I supposed to trust you now, when you've lied to me over and over? The only reason I let you back into my life is because I truly believed that you wanted a family.",
        "Lucy: I did! I do!",
        "Craig: I blame myself. I let you deceive me. Because all that time you were away with him, I didn't just miss my son -- I also missed my daughter.",
        "Lucy: I'm still your daughter.",
        "Craig: I don't have a daughter.",

        "Jack: Don't make Janet out to be the villain here. We both know that Parker has gotten out of hand. And now that both of us are working, there's just not enough supervision.",
        "Carly: You mean now that I'm working.",
        "Jack: No, I didn't mean that at all. You have been taking a lot of spur-of- the-moment business trips, however. Your partner doesn't seem to realize that when you've got a family, you've got to make time to make sure that things are covered on the home front.",
        "Carly: Just wait a second. What happened in the kitchen is not Craig's fault. He had nothing to do with it.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Carly: He didn't!",
        "Jack: Okay. That --- none of that matters now. Bottom line is, Parker and Liberty need to be supervised. They need to be separated. If you can think of another way, tell me, please.",
        "Carly: I told you that I don't have the answer. I just want you to stop trying to bully me into this one.",
        "Jack: I'm not trying to do that. I just want you to know that something has got to be done.",
        "Carly: I don't want to lose him.",
        "Jack: Neither do I. But at this point, that's more likely to happen if he stays than if he goes.",

        "Parker: Well, Gus is going to be gone for a week, right? We could cover a lot of ground in that time.",
        "Liberty: But we'd come back.",
        "Parker: We wouldn't have to.",
        "Liberty: Okay, this driving off into the sunset forever thing, I mean, don't you think it's a little drastic? I mean --",
        "Parker: Um, maybe, but it's either that or us being separated for life.",
        "Liberty: Do you really think that that could actually happen?",
        "Parker: I do. And I'm not okay with that, Liberty, because I can't be without you. I love you. The question is, do you love me?",
        "Liberty: Of course I love you. Don't you know that?",
        "Parker: Actually, I didn't.",
        "Liberty: Well, I would not go throw this hell for someone that I didn't love.",
        "Parker: You just -- just like made my entire life.",
        "Liberty: Well, then you're the only person that I haven't disappointed today.",
        "Parker: Yeah, look, don't worry about our parents. From now on, it's just you and me, doing what we want, when we want, where we want.",
        "Liberty: Okay, but this freedom train, it's not going to be cheap, okay? We need money.",
        "Parker: Well, I have money. Tons of it.",
        "Liberty: Parker, if you're talking about your trust fund, we tried to use that to pay for my mom's wedding and your parents nixed it, so --",
        "Parker: Yeah, it's my money, I'll figure out a way to get it. But, in the meantime, we'll have to get our hands on as much cash we can. Once we do that, we'll meet at the school parking lot because that's where the car is.",
        "Liberty: Okay, can we just slow down for a second, please?",
        "Parker: What's wrong?",
        "Liberty: I'm just going to really miss it here.",
        "Parker: What's there to miss?",
        "Liberty: It's my home. Okay, it's the only one I've ever really had.",
        "Parker: Liberty, if you don't want to do this, you have to tell me.",
        "Liberty: No, what I don't want is for them to send you away.",
        "Parker: Well, they will. Or I'll just go on my own.",
        "Liberty: Well, I cannot stay here without you, so --",
        "Parker: Then don't. Come with me and don't look back.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Parker: All right. So, we'll meet in the school parking lot in 20 minutes. Okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay. I'll be there.",

        "Janet: Carly is on board with this?",
        "Jack: Well, she fought it at first, but then, even she agreed that something had to give.",
        "Janet: It'll be okay.",
        "Jack: I hope so.",
        "Janet: Come on. Let me buy you a cup of coffee. I get an employee discount.",
        "Jack: Do you think I'm a hypocrite?",
        "Janet: Is that what he said? He didn't mean it.",
        "Jack: Maybe he did. And maybe he's right. All the times I let Carly off the hook? Never threw her out.",
        "Janet: You're not throwing him out. You're just giving him a chance to clean up his act.",
        "Jack: I want to believe that. But what if I'm wrong? What if sending him off to that school is the biggest mistake I ever made?",

        "Brad: Hey.",

        "Brad: Your mom?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. She keeps saying how she doesn't want me to live her life, and then she keeps putting me there.",
        "Brad: Liberty, she's just scared. I really messed things up. Okay, when I got her pregnant, I just left her deal with everything on her own. I'm sorry for that -- for you and for her.",
        "Liberty: No, it's okay. No, I'm sorry too. I -- I know you guys just want the best for me.",
        "Brad: That's all we want.",
        "Liberty: That's why it's probably not such a bad idea for me to, um, take a break from Parker.",
        "Brad: Are you serious?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. No, um, it wouldn't really hurt me to hang out with some girls, you know, for a change.",
        "Brad: Never hurt me.",
        "Liberty: No, but, um, actually my friend Shelby texted me and her and Tessa are going to go to the mall, so I can maybe go meet them there?",
        "Brad: Okay. Well, hey, you know, I'll grab my keys, I'll drive you over there.",
        "Liberty: No, no, no, really. No, you don't have to, I can -- I can call her and ask her --",
        "Brad: Are you sure? It's no problem for me to take you.",
        "Liberty: No, it's okay. It's okay. Oh. I thought I had some money, but I don't, so it's okay. I just -- I won't go, its fine.",
        "Brad: Oh, so passive-aggressive. \"I thought I had some money.\" \"Check my pockets, there's no money.\" Here you go.",

        "Parker: Um, I take it there's no chance that while I was gone you and Dad rethought me going to boarding school?",
        "Carly: I know you don't want to go. But we think that it might be the best thing.",
        "Parker: I'll take that as a no.",
        "Carly: Just try it, okay? Give it a chance. If you really hate it --",

        "Parker: No, you don't have to do that.",
        "Carly: No, I know I don't have to, but I want to. I'll invite your father and Janet. I'll even invite Liberty. I'll have all your favorite things. I've got some steaks in the fridge, I'll go thaw them right now. Parker, I love you. Please, don't forget that.",

        "Katie: I have a rough idea.",

        "Brad: No, you know, I'm just -- I'm just saying.",

        "Brad: Well, they better be. 'Cause we both need to be in the best possible shape if this is going to take. What is it?",

        "Dusty: There is no peace with Craig Montgomery.",

        "Craig: So we'll both lose a child today? Only you don't have to.",
        "Carly: Neither do you. Lucy was trying to do something good, for Johnny's sake.",
        "Craig: No, Lucy lied to me. More than once. Parker, on the other hand, was behaving like a normal teenager. Now, if you'd stop for a moment, from trying to please Jack, you might actually see that.",
        "Carly: Okay, that's it! That's enough! No more advice from you. Thank you. You worry about fixing your own family, and I'll worry about mine.",
        "Craig: Just hear me out for a minute.",
        "Carly: Why exactly are you here, anyway?",

        "Carly: Yep.",
        "Craig: Fine, I'm going, but don't think I don't know why you want me to leave.",
        "Carly: Why is that?",
        "Craig: Because you're afraid to be alone with me. We might have a repeat performance of what happened in that hotel room.",

        "[Carly sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You can't second guess yourself, Jack. We've all made mistakes. Carly and I thought it was a good idea for Parker and Liberty to see each other again. The one thing we were in sync about, and it was a total bust.",
        "Jack: It doesn't matter much who said yes or no. Both Parker and Liberty do what they want, and to hell with what their parents think.",
        "Janet: Which is why boarding school is -- is a good idea.",
        "Jack: I just don't want Parker to think that I don't want him around. Or that I don't love him.",
        "Janet: He knows you love him. And after a couple months of writing angry letters and door slamming, this'll all be just a distant memory for both of them.",
        "Jack: I hope you're right.",
        "Janet: We have to keep them apart, Jack. It's the only way. You are doing the right thing. And someday Parker might even thank you for it.",

        "Parker: Hey, what took you so long? I thought your dad like locked you up or something.",
        "Liberty: No, no, he was clueless. I --I told him I was going to the mall with some girlfriends.",
        "Parker: Which girlfriends?",
        "Liberty: Girlfriends that like to spend money. I had to find some way to get cash out of him.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, at least you asked for it. I just went ahead and took it. Look, don't give me that look. All right, I feel creepy enough already.",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry. I just -- Parker, I really hate that I didn't get to say goodbye to my mom.",
        "Parker: Look, you'll get to call her as soon as we get where we're going, okay?",
        "Liberty: Do we know where that is?",
        "Parker: I figured L.A. is about as far away as we can get. Come on. Are you okay?",
        "Liberty: Parker, are you sure that this is the only way?",
        "Parker: Liberty, if we stay here, our parents will keep pushing us apart. And that's not fair, it's not right.",
