        "Damian: I'm so happy to see you, Cara. You're afraid of me?",
        "Lily: Of course I am. Think of all the things that you've done. And not just to me, to -- to Meg and Holden and now Faith. The Damian I fell in love with would never hurt a child.",
        "Damian: I didn't harm her.",
        "Lily: You threatened her. You had her terrified, which is exactly what you intended to do.",
        "Damian: I needed to see you, Lily! I thought you'd be happy to know that I was alive.",
        "Lily: What do you want from me? I'm not going to play this game. You pulled out all the stops to get me here. Don't tell me you don't have a plan.",
        "Damian: You are all I want, Lily. We belong together. And I will do whatever's necessary, use whomever I must, to keep you with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I don't know where we're headed yet.",
        "Molly: We can't just sit here. You're a fugitive.",
        "Holden: Okay, then just drive. We need to figure out where Damian is, and then we go after him.",
        "Molly: No way. The last time you confronted Damian, you ended up taking the rap for his murder.",
        "Holden: That won't be a problem once we prove that he's alive.",
        "Molly: I think we need to call the police and tell them what we know.",
        "Holden: They won't believe us.",
        "Molly: But it's the truth.",
        "Holden: Molly, if I call them, they're gonna want to lock me up again. In their eyes, I'm the dangerous one.",
        "Molly: Well, then call Jack.",
        "Holden: No. No, Jack has already done enough trying to help this family. Besides, by the time he gets involved, Damian will be long gone. You're the only one that I trust, and I can't do this alone. Damian has Lily and Faith, and I don't even want to think about what might happen to them if we don't get there soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey. Sorry I'm late. I had to stop off at the tailor. I tell you, this guy is a find. I showed him some of Carly's sketches. He actually made samples right from the drawings. She's gonna be so excited to see these.",
        "Ellis: Until she finds out you raided Parker's trust fund.",
        "Craig: It's not raiding. It's borrowing, with interest. That's only fair. When you take out a loan, you have to pay interest.",
        "Ellis: This is grand larceny.",
        "Craig: Only if we do it badly. That's not gonna happen. Monte Carlo is gonna be a raging success, and Carly will never know what we had to do to get it there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Thank you for being so understanding about Janet and the baby.",
        "Carly: Well, they're part of your life now. If I want you, they're part of the deal.",
        "Jack: Carly, you won't have to share me.",
        "Carly: Yes, I will. One of the reasons I love you so much is how much you love your kids with your whole heart. I know what I'm getting into.",
        "Jack: I just wish it didn't have to be so complicated.",
        "Carly: Well, it doesn't. I think sage was right. It can be much more simple this time. Just get back to being a family. We can handle the rest together.",
        "Jack: But Janet's baby --",
        "Carly: Janet's baby is also your baby, and he or she will be a part of this family.",
        "Jack: What about Liberty?",
        "Carly: Liberty is your niece. She's the kids' cousin. She's been a part of our family for a long time. That's never gonna change.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Carly: You know, the only question that I have is what you're gonna do about Janet.",
        "Jack: We're getting an annulment.",
        "Carly: No, I know. I'm talking about your heart. If you feel too guilty to let her go --",
        "Jack: No, I don't, I don't. Janet doesn't expect that of me. I'm coming home to you and the kids. Anything else would be dishonest.",
        "Carly: You know, if we'd listened to them a year ago --",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: Everything would have been different.",
        "Carly: But it's okay, 'cause we're back together now -- stronger than ever. Now, don't take this personally, okay, but I'm expecting an e-mail. It's about some fabric for my collection. I have to make a decision today, so --",
        "Jack: No, go. Go ahead, go ahead. In the meantime, is there anything you'd like me to take care of for you?",
        "Carly: Yes. Handle things with Janet, okay? Dragging this out doesn't make it easier for anybody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'll be a good father. I'll give you and the baby everything you deserve.",
        "Janet: No, no. This is not your baby.",
        "Dusty: There's every chance it could be.",
        "Janet: Okay. All right. You don't believe me? I'll call the doctor, and I'll schedule a sonogram, and then we'll know for sure that it is Jack's baby. And until then, I don't want to talk about this anymore.",
        "Dusty: If it is our baby, we'll find another way to save Liberty, I promise.",
        "Janet: I'm gonna go get my things together. I got to -- I got to get some things for Liberty. Just show yourself out.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Hello.",
        "Jack: Dusty, where's Janet?",
        "Dusty: She stepped out. But while I have you, you should know that there's some questions about Janet's baby.",
        "Jack: What kind of questions?",
        "Dusty: I think I'm the father.",
        "Jack: Did Janet tell you you're the father?",
        "Dusty: She's not sure. She's getting a sonogram to find out how far along she is. Depending on the timing, we'll know the truth.",
        "Jack: I would like to talk to my wife, please.",
        "Dusty: Now she's your wife again, huh?",
        "Jack: Put her on the phone, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I said she's stepped out. I just thought you should know, Jack. We'll have a lot to talk about soon enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Ah! You are not gonna believe this. The fabric wholesaler actually met my price. I mean, that absolutely never happens. Everything with Monte Carlo, this seems so easy this time. I don't think we could possibly fail. Are you all right?",
        "Jack: I just got off the phone with Dusty.",
        "Carly: And?",
        "Jack: He thinks the baby may be his.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God. I thought -- didn't they just sleep together that one time?",
        "Jack: Well, apparently, that's all it may have taken.",
        "Carly: Could Janet have been pregnant this whole time?",
        "Jack: You tell me.",
        "Carly: I don't -- yeah, I -- it's possible. She's been very worried about Liberty. She could have been sort of confused. But you'd think once she started talking about having a baby with you, she would have realized. How did Dusty sound?",
        "Jack: Like he loves her.",
        "Carly: Does that bother you?",
        "Jack: I don't -- I don't know! It's just, what happens with Liberty now?",
        "Carly: Well, Jack, there was no guarantee that a baby would have been a match anyway. And she's getting the very best treatment possible.",
        "Jack: Yeah, because of Dusty.",
        "Carly: Well, so -- who cares, as long as she gets well?",
        "Jack: You're right, you're right. All that matters is that she gets well.",
        "Carly: You know, there is another way to look at this. Janet and Dusty are in love. And if this baby is theirs --",
        "Jack: You know, we don't know that yet.",
        "Carly: Okay. If it is theirs, it would be a good thing. You wouldn't have to feel so guilty that Janet is alone. She'd have a baby with a man she loves. This could be the answer to our problems.",
        "Jack: And what if Dusty's wrong?",
        "Carly: Well, Jack, then we'll deal with that, too. It has taken me a very long time, but I've learned my lesson. I'm never gonna let you go again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: As long as you keep your mouth shut, Ellis, Carly never has to know that her anonymous investor is Parker. And he never has to know about it, either.",
        "Ellis: This kind of money just doesn't vanish, Craig.",
        "Craig: It's not vanishing. We're converting it into goods, which we then convert into cash, which we then quickly and quietly return to Parker's trust fund. See? Everybody's happy.",
        "Ellis: Not if I go to jail.",
        "Craig: Ellis, relax. Look, the amount of money we're talking about, this is a drop in the bucket. And besides, what good is money when it sits in a bank collecting dust when it can be out in the world, gathering sunlight and doing good. Oh, shut up.",
        "Ellis: What? I didn't say anything.",
        "Craig: You didn't have to. But to answer your question, oh, yeah, she's worth it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Dusty? Well, what did you expect? You told him to leave. Parker, hi. Are you with Liberty? [Janet sighs] I am so glad that she has you there. Can I talk to her? Oh, okay, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't wake her up. She told me how hard it is to sleep with the doctors and nurses coming in and out all day. How is she feeling? Oh, poor thing. Well, you know, she's gonna have good days and bad days. And that's why she's there, right? To get better. And so tomorrow -- tomorrow is gonna be a good day. Could you please tell her I'll call her later and I miss her? Okay. Thanks, Parker.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: All right, that's great. Thank you for your help. I got an address.",
        "Molly: How?",
        "Holden: It's a security service that tracks kids' texts and phone calls.",
        "Molly: What did you find out?",
        "Holden: Her last text was from this guy named Max in Forest Hills.",
        "Molly: Right. What makes you think that she and Lily are there?",
        "Holden: Because Lily said that she was taking her to a friend's house in that area. Look, it's all we've got.",
        "Molly: All right. I'll make you a deal. I'll take you there. But when we get close, you call the police and tip them off. That way, if we find Damian, backup will be right behind us.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. But if Damian has done anything to hurt Lily or Faith --",
        "Molly: Then he deserves whatever he gets.",
        "[Engine turns over]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I know that you only acted out of love for me, Damian.",
        "Damian: That's right, Lily. All that matters to me in this life are you and Luciano.",
        "Lily: And I'm sorry that you were apart from us for so many years.",
        "Damian: In exile, Lily.",
        "Lily: I wish that I could change that. But you found your way back to us. We had a second chance.",
        "Damian: That's all I dreamed for so long, Lily. But then Holden walked through the door and ripped it all away from me.",
        "Lily: Damian, it wasn't his fault any more than it was yours.",
        "Damian: He never appreciated what he had in you. Not the way I do, Lily! What happened wasn't right.",
        "Lily: It was confusing for all of us.",
        "Damian: I just couldn't let him take you away from me, not after I worked so hard to get you back.",
        "Lily: You acted out of love, but things went wrong and people got hurt.",
        "Damian: Look, I'm sorry about Meg. I never meant for any of that to happen.",
        "Lily: Then prove it.",
        "Damian: How?",
        "Lily: Make things right. Turn yourself in. Don't let Holden pay for your mistakes.",
        "Damian: What mistakes are you talking about?",
        "Lily: You have a chance, but not at the expense of my children's father.",
        "Damian: A chance for us? I want to believe you, Lily, but you will have to prove it to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I know it's a bit of a shock. But aren't you relieved that the baby could be Dusty's?",
        "Jack: No, of course I think it's best for everybody involved if the baby's his. But you should have heard him charging ahead before anybody knows anything for certain.",
        "Carly: It wasn't his place to tell you, that's true.",
        "Jack: No, it wasn't. And I haven't talked to Janet yet, so I don't know the whole story.",
        "Carly: Well, go find out. But don't make this a competition between you and Dusty. Unless your feelings for me have suddenly changed.",
        "Jack: No. Of course not.",
        "Carly: Then this is where you belong -- with me. Remember that.",
        "Jack: Always. Be right back.",
        "Carly: Did I forget we had a meeting? What --",
        "Craig: No, no, but this couldn't wait.",
        "Carly: I doubt that.",
        "Craig: Trust me, you give me five minutes, you're gonna be glad I came.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You better be good at this, or I'm not gonna get any sleep tonight.",
        "Johnny: Watch and learn, Dad.",
        "Dusty: Yes, Sir. Yeah, I love being here with you. You can hang out with me anytime you want. Just tell your other dad to call first, okay? We're only an elevator ride away from each other. That's pretty cool. What's the matter? You don't like living in a hotel?",
        "Johnny: It's okay, but I wish I had a yard and a swing set.",
        "Dusty: Well, who doesn't? Big tree fort. No chicks allowed.",
        "Johnny: Maybe you could buy a house and build me one.",
        "Dusty: You know, Johnny, you just gave me a great idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I have a surprise for you.",
        "Carly: Oh! Oh, my gosh. Are these --?",
        "Craig: Carly Tenney originals right off the sewing machine.",
        "Carly: I love them. Oh, whoever made these, they're perfect.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: I agree. So do Morris and his sons. They want to put these in high-end boutiques before summer hits. And I mean New York, Palm Beach, Chicago and L.A., and then we go from there.",
        "Carly: Oh. Do you know what? Maybe we're thinking too small. Maybe we should go nationwide, right? All the department stores, they all have online divisions. I say we go for it!",
        "Craig: Oh, well, that's -- that's just a lot more money than we've budgeted for.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, go to Morris. We'll get more capital, right?",
        "Craig: No, I mean a lot more money.",
        "Carly: Well, big risk, big reward. Isn't that your mantra?",
        "Craig: Yeah, but we're just getting started. Let's not bite off more than we can chew.",
        "Carly: No, I want to. I think we should. I say go for it.",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Craig: Well, I sure haven't seen you this excited in a long time.",
        "Carly: You know, I have some sketches that I want to show you, but I left my book upstairs. Just wait here, okay? Oh! Don't sneak up on me like that. I was up so late last night sketching, I was too tired to make the bed. Let's go downstairs and look at these, okay?",
        "Craig: Jack was here, wasn't he?",
        "Carly: He left right before you got here. What difference does that make?",
        "Craig: Did you sleep with him? And I thought you were excited about the dresses.",
        "[Carly laughing]",
        "Carly: I was. I am. It was a wonderful thing for you to do.",
        "Craig: So does this mean that Jack's left Janet, that you two are back together?",
        "Carly: To tell you the truth, I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Janet sighs]",
        "Jack: You okay? What happened?",
        "Janet: It's Liberty. She's having a really bad day, and I hate not being with her.",
        "Jack: I know that. I know -- hey, listen, you'll be there soon enough. And in the meantime, the doctors are doing everything they can to take care of her. And Parker's there, making sure she gets everything she needs.",
        "Janet: But it's not the same. I'm her mother, Jack.",
        "Jack: I know.",
        "Janet: I should be there with her. It should be me.",
        "Jack: But you've got to take care of yourself now, too. Liberty's doctors were very clear on that, especially now that you're pregnant.",
        "Janet: I know. But this doesn't make it any easier.",
        "Jack: Did Dusty tell you I called earlier?",
        "Janet: No. Why?",
        "Jack: I wanted to go to your next doctor's appointment with you, but he answered, said you stepped out.",
        "Janet: I was upstairs.",
        "Jack: Janet, he told me he thinks he's the baby's father. Is that true? Is Dusty the father of your baby?",
        "Janet: No, he's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I married you twice. I believed in you.",
        "Damian: But no longer?",
        "Lily: When Luke told me they found your body overseas, I was devastated. When you left town, I was -- I was angry with you. I wad disillusioned. I thought I might never see you again. But even then, I couldn't imagine the world without you.",
        "[Door creaks]",
        "Lily: I --",
        "Damian: There's someone out there.",
        "Lily: No. I don't hear anything.",
        "Faith: Ow! Get off me!",
        "Lily: Faith, I told you to wait in the car.",
        "Faith: You took so long. I got scared.",
        "Damian: I thought I could trust you. I made it very clear to you what was at stake!",
        "Lily: Damian, let her go. She has nothing to do with us.",
        "Damian: She's part of the family.",
        "Faith: You're not my dad.",
        "Damian: Hey.",
        "Lily: Be quiet! Let me handle this.",
        "Damian: Where was Holden when that crazy man came after you, huh? I saved your life! You owe me the same courtesy!",
        "Faith: I don't owe you anything, you creep! My dad would have been there if it wasn't for you.",
        "Lily: Damian, look at me. I'm the one that owes you.",
        "Damian: You have no idea how much, Lily. You can't see it. You're blinded by Holden, by the past. He's taken you for granted all these years.",
        "Lily: That's right. But you haven't. You can give me a life that Holden could never even dream of. But you have to let Faith go. And you and I can go somewhere to talk, somewhere where the police can't find us. But I won't go with you unless you let Faith go. If you love me, you will do that for me, and then I will give you my undivided attention.",
        "Damian: That's what I had in mind all along.",
        "Lily: So we have an agreement? You won't let any harm come to Faith?",
        "Faith: What's that for?",
        "Lily: Damian --",
        "Damian: I'm sorry, Faith. You left me no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: That's Lily's car. He's got to be here somewhere.",
        "Molly: So it's time to call the police.",
        "Holden: Go ahead. You stay here and wait for me.",
        "Molly: Where are you going?",
        "Holden: To see what's going on inside that house.",
        "Molly: Will you please be careful? If Damian's as desperate as we think he is, he might not care who gets hurt.",
        "Holden: Aah!",
        "Lily: Holden! Holden! No!",
        "Molly: Damian Grimaldi. He's probably armed, and he's extremely dangerous. Yes, two hostages, and one of them is a 16-year-old girl. Please get here as fast as you can. I'm so afraid that somebody's gonna get hurt.",
        "[Faith sobbing]",
        "Molly: Faith! Oh, my God, Sweetie! Here, I'll have you free in just a second. Are you hurt anywhere? Honey, where is everybody?",
        "Faith: Damian took off with my mom.",
        "Molly: Did you see your father? Where is he?",
        "Faith: Dad -- I don't know. Isn't he still in jail?",
        "Molly: No. Oh, my God. Holden! Holden!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: This isn't about the cheating. We're past that. But if you're pregnant with Dusty's baby --",
        "Janet: What are you gonna do? Are you gonna leave me, Jack? That's kind of hard to do when you've already left.",
        "Jack: I'm just looking for the truth here, Janet.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry that I was weak and I broke my vows.",
        "Jack: Stop. Stop that.",
        "Janet: But if anybody should be punished, it should be me, not my little girl.",
        "Jack: Don't do this to yourself, please.",
        "Janet: Please.",
        "Jack: No one is punishing you, Janet.",
        "Janet: If this baby isn't yours, she could die. And that's my fault. It's not yours, and it's not Dusty's.",
        "Jack: Could it be Dusty's?",
        "Janet: I don't know. I've been so preoccupied with Liberty, I haven't been taking care of my body.",
        "Jack: Okay, but it's a possibility?",
        "Janet: I'm two months late with my period. What if I ruined everything?",
        "Jack: No. No, listen, everything -- [Jack sighs] Everything is gonna be -- everything's gonna be fine. The baby wasn't Liberty's only hope. She's gonna get better. You'll see.",
        "Janet: Thank you. Thank you. I have a shift at Metro. I have to go.",
        "Jack: You have a shift at Metro?",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Jack: The doctor told you to relax. Janet, please. Let me -- let me take care of you and Liberty.",
        "Janet: No, no, no. I cannot let you do that, especially while I'm living in your family's home, okay? I mean, what am I gonna do if I don't go? Am I gonna rearrange Emma's cabinets again?",
        "Jack: Not if you want to make a bad day worse.",
        "Janet: Exactly. So I might as well go make some money if I can't see Liberty till I see her again in Minneapolis, okay? So -- I'll call you when the get the results of the sonogram.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: How can you not know if you and Jack are back together?",
        "Carly: Janet is pregnant. But there's a chance that the baby is not Jack's.",
        "Craig: It could be Dusty's kid?",
        "Carly: Right. And even if it's not, you know, we'll work this out together, Jack and I.",
        "Craig: Don't you mean you and Jack and Janet?",
        "Carly: If that's the way it has to be, then yes. The point is, I'm not gonna let this come between us.",
        "Craig: More power to you.",
        "Carly: So, what do you say? Can you go to Morris and ask him for some more money so we can really get Monte Carlo out there?",
        "Craig: Sure, if that's what you want. But it means you're gonna have to spend a lot more time on the business than you have been. Can't let your personal life get in the way.",
        "Carly: I can handle it, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Oh, my God. Holden! Holden! Everything's gonna be okay. Tell her. Tell her, Holden. Tell her you're gonna be okay. Open your eyes and let us know you're okay.",
        "Faith: He's waking up. Dad, are you okay?",
        "Molly: Please, my love. Please, my love, talk to me. Talk to me.",
        "Faith: Can you hear me?",
        "Holden: Lily --",
        "Lily: No, don't! Don't do this! Don't take me away from my family.",
        "Damian: I am your family, Lily, not Holden! He spends all his time with Molly. He doesn't love you, Cara. He's not capable of loving you the way I do.",
        "Lily: My children need me. I won't abandon them!",
        "Damian: You mean you won't abandon Holden. Why? What is it about him you can't let go of? He abandoned you, Lily. He had his chance to stay married to you, to keep your family together, and he walked away! He turned it down! And I've watched you chase after him out of what, huh? Guilt? Do you know how much that hurt me? Did you even care?",
        "Lily: This isn't about me and Holden.",
        "Damian: It's always about Holden with you.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry if I made you feel that way.",
        "Damian: It doesn't matter. You're here now. I love you, Cara.",
        "Lily: You say you love me. You say that you know me. Then you know I would never be happy without my children.",
        "Damian: Of course you will. You'll be free. All we need is a little time alone to get to know one another again, and then you'll see that all those people that were trying to turn you against me were just jealous about the way we feel about each other. You're my wife, Cara. Till death do us part.",
        "Lily: Don't you ever touch me again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I thought you weren't working today.",
        "Dusty: I'm not working today. Neither are you.",
        "Janet: Are you firing me?",
        "Dusty: Would you relax? I'm not firing you.",
        "Janet: You're not?",
        "Dusty: No, I love having you here. Starting tomorrow, you can work all the shifts you want. Right now, you're coming with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, we'll start with the Chicago buyers first, 'cause the stores there are a lot less crazy. And they're gonna love the samples. And once they make the order, they'll recommend us to our other stores in other cities, and it's just gonna be great. Hey, do you think we should have a huge launch party downtown? Can we afford that?",
        "Craig: I don't see why not.",
        "Carly: Excellent.",
        "Craig: It's good to see you so excited again.",
        "Carly: Well, I'd forgotten how much I love design. And you gave that back to me, even though I wasn't part of the deal. Craig, you're a good guy, even if most people, even me, don't see that all the time. Thank you.",
        "Craig: My pleasure.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Craig: Jack. Come to get takeout for Janet now that she's eating for two?",
        "Carly: Oh, zip it!",
        "Craig: You sure know how to complicate things, don't you?",
        "Jack: You know, I'm gonna go grab some coffee somewhere else.",
        "Carly: No, Jack, please. Just wait. Craig, could you go and call Morris maybe and try to get some of those big bucks, huh?",
        "Craig: Your wish is my command.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Carly: So, you're not gonna tell me what a bad idea it is for me to be in business with Craig, are you?",
        "Jack: No. No, I'm not. If you're willing to stick by me even if Janet's baby turns out to be mine, then I hardly have a right to tell you who you can go into business with.",
        "Carly: Oh. Good answer.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Dusty, what are we doing? Why are we here?",
        "Dusty: You like it?",
        "Janet: It's nice. Why?",
        "Dusty: It could be our home together.",
        "Janet: I don't get it.",
        "Dusty: I know how uncomfortable you were at the farm.",
        "Janet: Wouldn't you be?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I'd like to buy this house for us so we can raise all the kids in our own home.",
        "Janet: I don't know what to say.",
        "Dusty: That's the nursery. That should be Liberty's room. It will be a place that the kids can always come home to.",
        "Janet: It's a beautiful house.",
        "Dusty: Could be a beautiful life.",

        "Molly: It's me, Molly.",
        "Faith: Dad, are you okay? Please say something.",
        "Holden: Faith, are you okay?",
        "Faith: I'm fine. What happened to Mom?",
        "Holden: I don't know. Damian must have knocked me out. And then he -- I guess he took off with her. [Sobbing]",
        "Faith: No.",
        "Holden: Don't let him.",
        "Molly: Faith, did you hear Damian say anything? Do you have any idea where they might have gone?",
        "Faith: He mentioned something about sailing away when he was tying me up.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Faith: He said that if they were at sea, Mom wouldn't be able to get away. They'd be alone, and she'd fall in love with him all over again. If he kidnapped her because of what I did --",
        "Molly: No, Faith, don't worry. I'm not gonna let that happen, okay?",
        "Faith: How are you gonna stop him?",
        "Holden: I will.",
        "Molly: No, no, no. You can't go anywhere until a doctor checks you out, all right? Faith, I need you to stay with your dad. Don't let him nod off. Keep him awake and alert.",
        "Faith: Yes.",
        "Molly: And try not to worry. The police will be here any minute, okay? I want you to make sure they get your dad right to the hospital. And listen to me. It's gonna work out. I'm not gonna let anything happen to your mother.",
        "Faith: Right.",
        "Damian: I'm not gonna hurt you, Cara. I love you.",
        "Lily: Love me? This isn't love. This is obsession -- your obsession. Look at all the damage you've done!",
        "Damian: For you. You said you understood that.",
        "Lily: I lied. Do you honestly think I could love a man who used my child to kidnap me? I believed in you, in spite of all the lies, all the little explanations that didn't add up. I gave you the benefit of the doubt because you are Luke's father. I wanted you to be the man that I fell in love with all those years ago. I couldn't let that dream go. But letting you back into my life was a terrible mistake, and marrying you again is the biggest mistake of my life.",
        "Damian: You don't mean that.",
        "Lily: Yes, I do. We'd all have been better off if you really were dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I can't give you an answer. Everything's still so unsettled.",
        "Dusty: With Jack, you mean.",
        "Janet: We're still married. And I know this may sound ridiculous, but I can't cheat on him again, even though we don't love each other anymore.",
        "Dusty: I understand. I just want you to know how I feel about you.",
        "Janet: I think I get it.",
        "Dusty: The house is ready whenever you are.",
        "Janet: I don't know when that's gonna be.",
        "Dusty: You don't have to know.",
        "Janet: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: I want you to keep this. And after the sonogram, when you know it's our baby, I want you to try it on. I'll wait for you, Janet, no matter how long it takes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Can you believe we're here?",
        "Jack: Old Town?",
        "Carly: [Laughs] Like this -- together, after everything we've put each other through. How did it happen?",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Jack: I don't know, but I'm sure glad it did.",
        "Carly: Me, too. And I admit that I didn't think it would.",
        "Jack: Oh, I wasn't so sure, either.",
        "Carly: I didn't think that you'd be able to accept me working with Craig again.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? The old Carly wouldn't have been nearly as accepting about the situation with Janet as you are. Let's be frank. You've got a lot more accepting to do than I do.",
        "Carly: Her kid's got cancer. What is there to accept? She's terrified. If it were happening to one of our children --",
        "Jack: Hey, bite your tongue. Thank God our kids are healthy.",
        "Carly: I feel for her. I really do.",
        "Jack: And you know I was talking about the baby.",
        "Carly: Yep. I knew you were talking about the baby.",
        "Jack: [Chuckles] How do you really feel about it?",
        "Carly: Baby's just part of our reality now, right?",
        "Jack: It's that simple to accept?",
        "Carly: Nothing's simple about it.",
        "Jack: I know. I know it's not how you wanted it to happen.",
        "Carly: Well, apparently it happened before I had a say. Or not. If there's a possibility that -- that Dusty's the father --",
        "Jack: Well, she's gonna have a sonogram to determine how far along she is.",
        "Carly: Oh, really?",
        "Jack: Yes. And then we will determine -- that will also determine who -- who the father is. Dusty seems pretty sure that it's his. But if it's mine --",
        "Carly: Jack, if it's yours, we will welcome the child into our family.",
        "Jack: You're being amazing about this.",
        "Carly: Well, it's really not the first time we've been in a situation like this. Think about J.J. we welcomed him into our family, didn't we? I don't see why this sit -- this baby would be any different. If it's yours, it will be welcomed into our home, into our hearts.",
        "Jack: Okay, yes, but if it is mine, there's gonna be a lot of adjusting to be had all the way around.",
        "Carly: Okay, then we'll make those adjustments, whatever they are.",
        "Jack: Are you sure about that?",
        "Carly: We're gonna get through it. It's not gonna be easy. [Laughs]",
        "Jack: You're right. I love you so much.",
        "Carly: I love you, too.",
        "Jack: And I'm so glad that we have each other now, forever and always.",
        "Carly: We need each other, Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Careful, Dad. Are you really okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I'm fine. Damian just knocked the wind out of me. That's all. But I'm worried about your mom and Molly. I need to find them.",
        "Faith: What if it's too late?",
        "Holden: It's not.",
        "Faith: You don't know that. What if because of me, Damian takes Mom away and we never find her?",
        "Holden: No, no. I won't let that happen. I won't ever let that happen.",
        "Damian: I gave up everything because of you, Lily -- my life, my freedom!",
        "Lily: And that's exactly what you stole from Holden!",
        "Damian: That's enough! I don't want to hear his name again. Do you understand me? I did this, all of this, because I love you.",
        "Lily: Then I feel sorry for you. What you've done makes me hate you even more.",
        "Damian: That hurts me to hear you say that.",
        "Lily: You deserve so much worse.",
        "Damian: A few months alone at sea with me will change your attitude.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Damian: Oh, yes, it will, if you want to survive. There won't be anybody there to help you or hear you cry. You'll learn to love me, Cara, or you'll die alone. Let's go.",
        "Molly: Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Emma: If you really, really want to help Meg, please, Paul, leave her alone. Stay away from her.",
        "Meg: I need you to be Eliza's mother.",
        "Luke: You're kind of mumbling. You're really dizzy. Faith, what's going on with you?",
        "Lily: Damian, don't.",
