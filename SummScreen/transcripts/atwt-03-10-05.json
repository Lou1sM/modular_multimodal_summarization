        "Security \r\n  guard: Hey. Excuse me, sir. All flights have departed for the night.\r\n  Time to move it along. ",
        "Henry: \r\n  Right. Thank you. That's great. Craig's got the world at his feet. He's \r\n  sipping champagne somewhere. He owes me. Yeah, he owes me big time. \r\n  ",
        "",
        "Craig: I \r\n  know you've been busy holding Dusty Donovan\u2019s hand ever since he started \r\n  working at Worldwide, but tonight, I thought you might actually disengage long \r\n  enough to pay some attention to Street Jeans. ",
        "Sierra: I \r\n  beg your pardon? ",
        "Craig: I \r\n  know Dusty needs constant attention. I get that. ",
        "Sierra: \r\n  Oh, well, if that's your opinion about him, then you really don't know him.\r\n  ",
        "Craig: Oh, \r\n  I do. But you don't have any idea because you're letting yourself get played \r\n  like a banjo. ",
        "Sierra: \r\n  Dusty and I have a business relationship. ",
        "Craig: Oh, \r\n  I can tell. And, frankly, I could care less. But if you care anything about \r\n  our daughter -- if you care anything about Lucy, then you'd better watch your \r\n  step, because I don't think she'd understand what's going on between her \r\n  mother and her old boyfriend. ",

        "Barbara: \r\n  Hitch your wagon to Craig Montgomery\u2019s star, and your life as you know it will \r\n  be over. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\n  Now I know you're delusional. ",
        "Barbara: \r\n  Honey, don't you remember what it was like? We're family -- you and me, your \r\n  dad and will. We were a family, and then along comes \r\n  Craig Montgomery, making promises he couldn't keep, seducing me away from my \r\n  life. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\n  Mm. ",
        "Barbara: \r\n  Have you forgotten what he did to our family? ",
        "Jennifer: \r\n  That's not quite how I remember it. ",
        "Barbara: \r\n  He destroyed my marriage, my career -- ",
        "Jennifer: \r\n  Oh, now, let's keep the story straight, Mom. You were the one who walked out \r\n  and left your children without a mother. ",
        "Barbara: I \r\n  didn't walk. I was pushed. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\n  Oh, please. You were dying to leave that life, to get out of the kitchen and \r\n  pour every inch of your existence into B.R.O. you wanted Craig. You chased \r\n  Craig. And then you got burned. So don't blame your shortcomings on him.\r\n  All right? I know the truth. I was there. And I \r\n  know exactly who's to blame. ",

        "Rafael: \r\n  I'm the brother of the little girl who sent you that demo tape of herself.\r\n  ",
        "Scott: \r\n  Yeah? ",
        "Rafael: I \r\n  just want to apologize. ",
        "Scott: For \r\n  what? ",
        "Rafael: \r\n  She's from out of the country. She thinks coming to America means she's\r\n  gonna be an instant star. So don't feel like you \r\n  have to listen to this tape of hers. ",
        "Scott: Oh \r\n  -- ",
        "Rafael: \r\n  She's just a kid. She doesn't get it yet. ",
        "Scott: No, \r\n  it's no big deal, man. She's a cute kid. I'll give it a listen. ",
        "Rafael: \r\n  Yeah? ",
        "Scott: \r\n  Yeah. ",
        "Rafael: \r\n  Well, that's real nice of you. Hey, Aaron? I was \r\n  wondering if I could take off early -- ",
        "Aaron: \r\n  We're actually getting ready to clean up now. ",
        "Rafael: \r\n  Yeah, but Celia took off again. I -- ",
        "Aaron: \r\n  Rafi -- she was fine the first half dozen times it's happened. I'm sure she's \r\n  fine again. Let's get a full night's work, and we can all be happy. Cool?\r\n  ",
        "Alison: \r\n  She's his little sister. He's just trying to take care of her. Let him go, \r\n  Aaron. ",

        "Casey: \r\n  Hey, what's up? I was just about to nuke some pizza. You want a slice? \r\n  ",
        "Will: No.\r\n  No, thanks. ",
        "Casey: \r\n  What's up? ",
        "Will: \r\n  Nothing. I was just in the neighborhood. I figured I'd stop by -- hang out.\r\n  ",
        "Casey: \r\n  What do you want to do? Video games? ",
        "Will: No, \r\n  you'd kill me. ",
        "Casey: \r\n  True. DVD? ",
        "Will: \r\n  Maybe later. ",
        "Casey: \r\n  You're a real party in a can tonight. So, did something happen between you and \r\n  your mom? ",
        "Will: No.\r\n  Nothing like that. ",
        "Casey: Oh, \r\n  so it's you and Alison. ",
        "Will: Give \r\n  me a break. ",
        "Casey: \r\n  Whatever's bothering you is because of a woman. Don't try to deny it. \r\n  ",
        "Will: \r\n  Since when did you become the expert on male and female relationships? \r\n  ",
        "Casey: \r\n  Well, I may be no expert yet, but -- I don't want to brag, but I do know how \r\n  to make a certain young lady very happy. ",
        "Will: \r\n  Yeah? Celia? ",
        "Casey: She \r\n  came running over here a couple hours ago, saying Scott Reeves, this country \r\n  singer, is down at Metro, and she wants to give him a demo. ",
        "Will: Does \r\n  she even have a demo? ",
        "Casey: She \r\n  did when I got done with her. ",
        "Will: \r\n  Well, that's great. ",
        "Casey: \r\n  Yeah, and now that she knows that I'm in her corner and that she can always \r\n  count on me -- I mean, who knows? It's like you and Alison, you know? It's \r\n  kind of nice having a chick as a friend. ",
        "Will: So \r\n  -- so you like her like her? ",
        "Casey: \r\n  What's not to like? I mean, she's gorgeous. She's talented. She's fun --\r\n  ",
        "Will: \r\n  Yeah, just don't let her know you think so. ",
        "Casey: Are \r\n  you out of your mind? ",
        "Will: \r\n  Well, no. But once she knows your weaknesses, then she could take advantage.\r\n  ",
        "Casey: \r\n  Fine with me. ",
        "Will: You \r\n  say that now. ",

        "Celia: I \r\n  know it's late, and I'm really, really sorry -- ",
        "Casey: \r\n  Don't worry about it. Is everything all right? How'd it go with the demo?\r\n  ",
        "Celia: I \r\n  hate my brother. ",
        "Casey: \r\n  Why? What happened? ",

        "Mike: \r\n  Okay, so you're not the best cook in the world. You know, there's always \r\n  take-out. ",
        "Katie: I'm \r\n  a fabulous cook. ",
        "Mike: Of \r\n  course you are. I mean -- I just thought that when you said you couldn't be \r\n  the wife that Henry wants and deserves, you meant that -- ",
        "Katie: I'm \r\n  not talking about in the kitchen. ",
        "Mike: Oh. \r\n  You're talking about some other room? ",
        "Katie: The \r\n  one with the bed in it. ",
        "Mike: But \r\n  the way you two were going on about having a family, I just assumed -- \r\n  ",

        "[Katie \r\n  sighs] ",
        "Mike: \r\n  Well, I'm sure you're not the only newlyweds with these \r\n  kind of issues -- ",
        "Katie: \r\n  It's not like I don't love him. I do. ",
        "Mike: So \r\n  maybe the timing's just not right yet. ",
        "Katie: No, \r\n  there's not going to be a right time. Not for Henry and me. Not like that. Oh, \r\n  God, I got him into a marriage, which is supposed to be the best time of your \r\n  life, and now I'm breaking his heart, and I just don't know what to do. \r\n  ",

        "Celia: \r\n  It'll just be for the night. Until I can make other plans or straighten things \r\n  out with Rafael. ",
        "Casey: \r\n  Well, my mom's already asleep, and I'd have to wake her up to ask for \r\n  permission. ",
        "Celia: \r\n  Can't you? Just this once? ",
        "Casey: I \r\n  kind of have to save the waking-up thing for emergencies. I mean, if I wake \r\n  her up right now, all I'm going to get is a lecture, and you don't want to be \r\n  here for that. ",
        "Celia: \r\n  This night keeps getting worse and worse. ",
        "Will: Why?\r\n  ",
        "Celia: I \r\n  gave my demo to Scott Reeves, and he was being so sweet. And then Rafael \r\n  showed up and told me I looked like a streetwalker. ",
        "Casey: You \r\n  look great. ",
        "Celia: \r\n  That's what I thought. But when Rafael gets angry and macho like that, there's \r\n  no talking to him. ",
        "Casey: So \r\n  you took off? ",
        "Celia: I \r\n  couldn't stay there after he'd embarrassed me. I ran out. Found the bus that \r\n  would take me to your house. Do the buses run all night? ",
        "Casey: \r\n  Yeah, but you can't ride the buses all night. ",
        "Celia: \r\n  It's too cold to sleep outside, and I don't have any money for a hotel. \r\n  ",
        "Casey: So \r\n  what are you gonna do? ",
        "Celia: \r\n  I'll think of something. 'Night. And thanks again \r\n  for the demo and everything. ",

        "Alison: \r\n  Try to put yourself in his position. What if Luke was suddenly your\r\n  responsibility, and you're in charge of his health \r\n  and his school and where he lives and who his friends are, and suppose Luke \r\n  was out of control and he ran off somewhere? All you want to do is go out and \r\n  find him. But what if your boss wouldn't let you leave until you've hauled the \r\n  trash out to the garbage? How would that make you feel? ",

        "Craig: It \r\n  was a private conversation. ",
        "Sierra: It \r\n  was an insulting conversation. You are incredible -- I give you a job. I give \r\n  you my trust. I give you forgiveness. And this is how you choose to see me?\r\n  To hell with you. ",

        "Dusty: \r\n  It's not like I need a reason, but it would help to explain something to the \r\n  cops. ",
        "Sierra: \r\n  Really, it's fine. I can fight my own battle. I got to get going. ",

        "Barbara: I \r\n  never thought I'd see the day when my daughter would be defending Craig \r\n  Montgomery\u2019s deplorable actions. The fact that you've taken his side against \r\n  me is proof that you're headed for a disaster. ",
        "Jennifer: \r\n  Mother, I am not you, and this is an entirely different situation. ",
        "Barbara: \r\n  No woman has ever emerged unscathed from a relationship with that man! \r\n  ",
        "Jennifer: \r\n  I am not in a relationship with the man! I'm in business with him. ",
        "Barbara: \r\n  Don't fool yourself, honey. You're dealing with the devil. He's telling you \r\n  you're brilliant and the two of you are gonna \r\n  change the world. And you believe that. And then, one day, you're\r\n  gonna wake up, and this wonderful dream that \r\n  you've created is going to be gone. He will have taken it and everything else. \r\n  Because that's what he does. You used to know that, Jen. But right now, you're \r\n  on this high, because you've had this burst of success. Don't let it cloud \r\n  your judgment. Please. Get away from him before it's too late.

He \r\n  never complains, even after I turned him down and I \r\n  told him that we weren't ever gonna raise a family \r\n  together. But he just accepts it. I know it's got to be killing him inside, \r\n  but he doesn't say anything because he's such a good person. And I am turning \r\n  his life into a nightmare, which is probably why he's having chest pains. I've \r\n  got to do something to make this right. ",

        "Katie: No.\r\n  God, no. Ending this marriage would kill Henry. But \r\n  staying in it is destroying us both. Henry is a mess, and I'm a mess. You got \r\n  to help me, Mike. I don't know what to do. You've got to help me. ",
