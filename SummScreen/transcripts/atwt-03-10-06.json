        "Holden questions Jade about Kevin's quick turn around from hanging with Luke to now being interested in her; Jade assures him Kevin and Luke were simply best friends and not gay. Lily heads to the orphanage to question Sister Elizabeth about Jade. Emily is shocked to find out from Susan that Paul confessed to killing Dusty, even though she was definite he would implicate Meg after she told him about her having the bloody wallet. Nancy fronts the bail money for Nick, as Katie apologizes and promises her the deed to her house, but assures her that Nick is innocent and has been set up. Carly visits Nick in jail; Nick thinks she was in on his set up, but she convinces him she would never get involved in drugs and sending him to jail. Jack is not happy to catch Carly there with Nick, and he orders her to leave. Meg and Holden discuss her newfound bond with Paul. Holden hopes she cuts her losses when it comes to him, but Meg continues to defend him. Emily calls Henry to tell him about Paul's confession, and he insinuates that Paul is protecting Meg by confessing to a crime he didn't commit. This angers Emily and she calls Hal and asks him to come over because she and Henry have something to tell him; later, she tells Hal they found Dusty's bloody wallet in Meg's room. Katie bails Nick out and is aggravated when she finds out Nick didn't tell Jack about Carly's role in his supposed set up. Jade worries when Luke tells her that Lily went on a day trip by plane in search of some truth. At the orphanage, a shocked Lily finds out Jade is not who she says she is. She learns Rose's daughters name was Theresa and Jade was another child similar in age who lived at the orphanage. The nun describes Jade as breaking their trust because she was a bit of a con artist. Carly goes looking for Chardonnay, but Butch claims he has never employed or heard of her. Katie, tired of Nick protecting Carly, decides to take matters into her own hands when they get home, and picks up the phone to clue Jack into Carly's extra curricular activities."

        "Holden: Hey! You're up early.",
        "Jade: Yeah. I was just taking a walk. Listen, Holden, I just wanted to apologize to you again for borrowing Lily's bracelet without asking.",
        "Holden: I'm just sorry that we ruined your surprise.",
        "Jade: Oh, the charm. Right. You know, we could still get one for her if you think she'd like that.",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. That's a good idea. Hey listen, I want to ask you something about last night.",
        "Jade: Mm-hmm?",
        "Holden: I know that you said you asked Luke to talk to Kevin.",
        "Jade: Right, because Kevin was bothering me.",
        "Holden: Right. You know, it just seems a little strange to me that Kevin was interested in Luke, and now, all of a sudden, he's interested in you.",
        "Jade: Nobody ever said that he was interested in Luke. That was your idea. They were just best friends.",
        "Holden: You're sure about that?",
        "Jade: Yes. Positive. I would tell you if I weren't. I made you a promise.",
        "Holden: Yeah, you did.",
        "Jade: But you don't believe me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hello, its Lily Snyder calling again, Sister Elizabeth. I'm sorry we keep missing each other, but I'm going to be leaving Oakdale in a little while. I should be at the orphanage in a few hours. I'm sorry to impose, but there are some urgent questions that I have about my niece that apparently only you can answer. So I can't wait any longer. I'll see you later on today. Thank you. Bye.",
        "Luke: What can't wait any longer?",
        "Lily: The truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey. Is there anything in the paper about Dusty Donovan? I can't believe they haven't found a body yet. What?",
        "Susan: You just surprised me, that's all. Of course, you were married to a cop.",
        "Emily: This has nothing to do with Hal. I'm just surprised there hasn't been a break in the case, that's all.",
        "Susan: Oh, there's been a break in the case.",
        "[Susan shows Emily the paper's headlines of Paul confessing to the murder of Dusty Donovan]",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Susan: Emily --",
        "Emily: No, no, this can't -- this can't be. Why would he confess?",
        "Susan: Because he murdered the guy.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but he didn't. He couldn't. Why would he lie?",
        "Susan: Because he lies about everything? Don't you know that by now? He's a seriously disturbed man.",
        "Emily: He is not a murderer, Mother.",
        "Susan: And he's none of your business anymore. He left you standing at the altar, remember? You were devastated.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, it's not an easy thing to forget.",
        "Susan: Good. Because you need to take the focus off Paul and put it back on your life.",
        "Emily: You're right. And I am. It's just that, if Paul didn't do it, whoever killed Dusty is still out there.",
        "[Susan sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: This is so wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: I'm glad to be able to help, dear.",
        "Katie: Here, let me get this for you.",
        "Nancy: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Oh, it's freezing, isn't it? You know what they say about March, in like a lion --",
        "Nancy: That was a lot of money they asked for bail.",
        "Katie: I think it's because Nick is a cop and they're probably extra mad at him for breaking the rules. Do you want some tea? I was thinking about putting on some water while I write you a receipt. Oh, and I have a copy of the deed to the house.",
        "Nancy: Don't be silly, dear. I trust you. But I must say, I heard something on the car radio on the way over.",
        "Katie: It's on the news?",
        "Nancy: I'm afraid so. They said when they found Nick, he had heroin on him and he had taken a dose of the --",
        "Katie: No, that's not true. He was set up. And whoever's behind this is not going to get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hey, rookie! I'm talking to you!",
        "Cop #1: Yeah and they can hear you in Chicago.",
        "Nick: Katie here yet?",
        "Cop #1: And Katie would be?",
        "Nick: My cousin's fianc\u00e9e. She promised to bail me out.",
        "Cop #1: Well, there's a blonde outside on her way in.",
        "Carly: Thank you. Jack told me what happened last night, and I just needed to come down here and tell you that I don't believe it.",
        "Nick: What part don't you believe?",
        "Carly: The drugs, what else? There's no way you're dirty. In fact, I was shocked that he could even suggest such a thing.",
        "Nick: You know, I always wondered about Jack, and now I know. Any man that would believe a word out of your mouth is a fool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So you're charging off to find the truth when you haven't even had breakfast yet?",
        "Lily: You're right. It's not that important.",
        "Luke: So, it's not that important but it can't wait?",
        "Lily: I am concerned about something. I don't have enough information about it so -- you shouldn't have to worry about it. But when I do have more information, I promise, I'll share it with you, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: This is because I took the bracelet, isn't it?",
        "Holden: No, no, it's this feeling I get anytime I see Luke with Kevin. You know what? I don't want to put you in the middle. You guys are obviously getting close. He trusts you.",
        "Jade: Which is why I asked him to talk to Kevin.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I guess that's why I was surprised. After our talk -- you put the two of them together.",
        "Jade: I didn't know what to do. It's like you said, Kevin, he pushes and pushes -- he doesn't know when to stop. And I knew he would listen to Luke and since Luke doesn't have a problem with him --",
        "Holden: Well then, why is it that any time I see the way Luke looks at him, it's like he wants to ask him a million things but he can't.",
        "Jade: Or maybe it's just because he's sad. You know, because of everything that's happened to Kevin? They were really good friends and Kevin's drinking ruined everything.",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, you're probably right.",
        "Jade: Look, I know for a fact that there wasn't any kind of a relationship between them -- at least not the kind that you were worried about. They were just best friends.",
        "Holden: Thank you, Jade. I'm glad that we're able to talk like this.",
        "Meg: Holden! I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. I really need to talk to you about something. I keep going over it and over it, and it doesn't make any sense. And I don't know what to do.",
        "Holden: About what?",
        "Meg: Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What is the matter with you? You would let an innocent man go to jail?",
        "Susan: Innocent? He's already wanted for faking his own death to avoid prosecution for crimes against his own family.",
        "Emily: He didn't kill Dusty.",
        "Susan: Emily, you can't possibly know that. You've got to wake up! He already confessed! There's only one reason to confess to murder.",
        "Emily: Unless he's covering for someone.",
        "Susan: Not today, Nancy Drew. You're in no condition to start worrying about something that is none of your business.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about? I am perfectly fine.",
        "Susan: Honey, you haven't slept a wink since you moved in here. Now I want you to book a massage, take a nap -- relax!",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay! Aren't you due at the hospital or something?",
        "Susan: Overdue. Listen, just try to get some rest. Okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah, okay, thanks.",
        "Henry: Hello?",
        "Emily: Henry, its Emily.",
        "Henry: When you hear the beep, please leave a message.",
        "Emily: Very funny. Get over here right away. We've got work to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Look, I'm the first to admit that you're not my favorite person. You're conceited and greedy. You stole my husband's job. But there's no way you use heroin or that you're dealing. The idea that you're some kind of bagman for Anatoly --",
        "Nick: You know what, just save it, Carly. You set me up, and I fell for it.",
        "Carly: Fell for what?",
        "Nick: The chance to get close to you. I mean, you played me like a pro. When sent me that note -- I mean, the perfume was a nice touch.",
        "Carly: What -- what note? What?",
        "Nick: To get me to the Lakeview.",
        "Carly: Lakeview?",
        "Nick: You spiked the champagne.",
        "Carly: No, listen to me, Nick. I swear to you that I have no idea what you're talking about right now. I would never -- I would never cheat on Jack.",
        "Nick: Oh no, you weren't planning to cheat on Jack. That was just the bait at the end of the hook. I had a glass of champagne. And the next thing I know, Jack's frisking me in the parking lot. He found a bag of heroin in my pocket and wad of cash.",
        "Carly: That's horrible.",
        "Nick: Oh no, there's more. They shot me up with this stuff. And now my career is on the line and I'm going to prison.",
        "Carly: Nick, you gotta believe me. I would never have anything to do with drugs, and I never wanted you to go to prison.",
        "Nick: So, I guess you got lucky.",
        "Carly: Hey, I know that we don't like each other, but you can't really think that I would go that far. If you're willing to listen to me, I can prove it to you. Please, Nick, give me a chance for both our sakes. You need to find out who's really responsible for all of this and I -- I can't have you thinking that I would do something so hideous. I'm a mother, you know? You've met my children. You know, honestly, if you really thought that I could do something like that, you would've told Hal last night and you didn't. And you didn't because believe it then and you don't believe it now.",
        "Nick: So that's what this is all about?",
        "Carly: What do you mean?",
        "Nick: You don't want me to tell Jack that you were behind all of this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh!",
        "Jade: Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?",
        "Lily: Oh no, I'm just startled. I didn't expect a welcoming committee on the front steps. Hi, Meg.",
        "Meg: Hey, Lily.",
        "Holden: Meg's here to talk to me.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Jade: And I was hoping that maybe we could go to the jewelry store and pick out a new charm for the bracelet. After breakfast, of course.",
        "Lily: Oh, I've actually had breakfast already. But there's some pancake batter inside if you want to help yourself.",
        "Jade: Oh, okay.",
        "Lily: And we'll catch up after dinner. Okay?",
        "Jade: Sure.",
        "Holden: Where you going?",
        "Lily: I've got a really big meeting that I actually can't miss. I've got to go, I'll fill you in. Okay? I'll fill you in later. Bye.",
        "Meg: Bye.",
        "Lily: Bye, Meg.",
        "Meg: You know, maybe I should go.",
        "Holden: No, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Meg: But you probably have things to do.",
        "Holden: No, you came here to talk to me.",
        "Meg: Well, I changed my mind.",
        "Holden: No, no, no, no. You said that you need to do something about Paul. Is this about Dusty? Because I read in the paper that Paul confessed to murdering him.",
        "Meg: I still can't believe it, Holden. It's just so awful.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry. I know how you felt about Dusty. Must be hell for you.",
        "Meg: That's one way to put it.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry that you have to go through this. But at least if they know who it is, it'll get Jack off your back.",
        "Meg: What does that mean?",
        "Holden: Well, it must've been tough to have Jack questioning you about Dusty's disappearance. But at least now they know the truth. Meg? What's going on here?",
        "Meg: Paul didn't kill Dusty.",
        "Holden: He confessed.",
        "Meg: He's lying.",
        "Holden: You don't know that.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I think I do.",
        "Katie: You know, if you're not okay with this \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: I'm glad to loan you the money, dear. Nick is Mike's cousin, Mike is your fianc\u00e9 and you're my darling Katie and that's that. But I am concerned.",
        "Katie: About me?",
        "Nancy: And Mike. You had told me this was supposed to be a new beginning for Nick. But it doesn't seem to be working out that way.",
        "Katie: Well, you know, Nick is a lot of things. He's messy and loud and an outrageous flirt.",
        "Nancy: Not with you, I hope.",
        "Katie: With everyone. That's just the way he is. But Nick loves being a cop. He wants to make lieutenant tomorrow. And not just because it would make a big deal around the station, but because he gets a rush out of being a hero. He loves to save people. Remember the bomb at WOAK? He's still talks about it all the time, about how good it felt to help all of those people. And you know, Nick's not perfect, you know? He makes mistakes, he's a little crazy sometimes, but there's no way he's dirty. It's just not possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You can tell Jack anything you want. But I'm warning you, you're gonna look like an idiot. I can prove that I wasn't involved.",
        "Nick: How?",
        "Carly: This note that you say I wrote you, can prove that it's in my handwriting?",
        "Nick: Well, it was typed and unsigned. But your perfume was all over it.",
        "Carly: My perfume. There must be a million women who wear my perfume. But you're right, I do wear it all the time and anybody who knows me knows that.",
        "Nick: What's your point?",
        "Carly: You've been undercover at the club for a long time. In fact, I'm surprised you hadn't been made before.",
        "Nick: And nobody saw through my cover.",
        "Carly: Oh no? Are you sure? That place is filled with people who hate cops. And if somebody wanted to take you out, what better way than to make it look like you're dirty.",
        "Nick: I saw you in the room at the Lakeview. I was still conscious when you arrived.",
        "Carly: I don't know who you saw last night, but there are a lot of blondes out there. And for all we know, one of them could be made up to look just like me.",
        "Nick: Nice try.",
        "Carly: I spent the evening with Lily Snyder, Nick. You can ask her. Jack told me that you were spotted coming out of the lobby with two goons.",
        "Nick: That doesn't prove anything. You could've hired them.",
        "Carly: Did I take that job to help my husband show you up? Yeah. Yeah, I did. But you caught me, Nick. I failed.",
        "Nick: And now you're getting even.",
        "Carly: You're angry. And I don't blame you. You could've been killed. If Jack hadn't shown up when he did, you'd be lying in the morgue. Do you really think I would do that to you? I didn't want to see you dead, Nick. I just wanted my husband to get his job back. You know, Jack could've been shot last night. Do you really think that I would take that kind of risk? I am not a stupid woman. And am not a vicious person. And I cannot believe that you think that I would do something so cold. This is the last thing in the world that I would want to happen to you. To be drugged and to have your badge taken away and to end up in jail, Nick -- if there's anything I can do to help you, I will. But I just need to know. Do you believe me? Because I don't think I could stand it if you thought that I wanted to see you like this.",
        "Jack: Carly? What the hell are you doing?",
        "Nick: She's here because of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Hal: You found Dusty Donovan's wallet in Meg Snyder's hotel room?",
        "Emily: Yes, and there was something on it. There were blood stains all over the wallet.",
        "Sister. Elizabeth: Rose's daughter was named Theresa.",
        "Nick: I'm gonna find out who did this to me. I'm not going down for this.",
        "Carly: Come on, Butch, I'm not trying to make trouble, I just need to talk to Chardonnay.",
        "Butch: Never heard of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: She wanted me to know that she believes me.",
        "Jack: Is that so?",
        "Carly: I was just feeling badly for him, babe.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so you thought you'd come to the jail and have a little chat?",
        "Carly: No, come on. It's Mike's cousin, you know?",
        "Jack: I arrested him, and according to him, I set him up.",
        "Carly: He doesn't believe that.",
        "Jack: I don't care what he believes! He's the prisoner. I'm the arresting officer. And I want you out of here now. Now.",
        "Carly: Okay. All right, fine, I'll go. I'm sorry, I was just trying to be nice.",
        "Nick: Is there any word on my bail hearing?",
        "Jack: After my wife leaves, thank you.",
        "Carly: I'm going! I'm gone, all right? I said I'm going. What is your problem?",
        "Jack: What are you doing here, Carly?",
        "Carly: I told you. I just was feeling badly for the guy.",
        "Jack: He was dealing drugs.",
        "Carly: I don't believe that.",
        "Jack: I was there. I pulled the drugs out of his coat. I saw the state he was in, and I don't want you anywhere near him anymore. Do you understand me?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I understand you. I'll stay away.",
        "Nick: So when's the hearing?",
        "Jack: Soon.",
        "Nick: What?",
        "Jack: I warned you. When we first met. I warned you that you can only bend the rules so far. I guess you had to learn the hard way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: How would you know whether or not Paul Ryan was lying to the police?",
        "Meg: You say that as if lying to the police were something new for Paul. He has a history of lying to everybody.",
        "Holden: Fair enough.",
        "Meg: And besides, you've been following this in the papers. They didn't find a body. And they searched the area where Paul claims that he buried him. Nothing. No footprints, no blood, no shreds of clothing or hair. Nothing to connect them!",
        "Holden: The police don't always broadcast everything they find.",
        "Meg: I'm telling you, Holden, there is nothing to connect Paul to Dusty except his bogus confession.",
        "Holden: Tell me this. Why would Paul confess to a murder he didn't commit?",
        "Meg: He probably assumes since he's already going to jail --",
        "Holden: He would ruin his chances of parole. I don't buy it.",
        "Meg: Okay, look, Paul is a complicated man. He can lie and mislead people for reasons that don't make sense to you and me but make perfect sense to him.",
        "Holden: Why are you defending a guy who, for whatever reason, hurts anyone who comes near him?",
        "Meg: That's not true.",
        "Holden: No? Ask Jennifer. Ask Will. Ask Dusty! I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I love you and I'm a little worried about you here.",
        "Meg: I'm fine.",
        "Holden: No, you're not fine. When you told me that you were leaving town, I got worried. You're angry, you're nervous, you're in tears half the time.",
        "Meg: You know, this is why I wanted to go. You force me to talk to you, and then you don't like what you hear.",
        "Holden: That's because I see you tied up in knots over this guy who's not worth it. He's going down. And I don't want you going down with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I told Paul that Meg had Dusty's wallet. I told him about the bloodstains.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Emily: And knowing that, he still confessed? Why did he do that?",
        "Henry: Because he killed Dusty?",
        "Emily: Yeah, but he didn't kill Du -- look, if Meg killed Dusty -- I thought you used to be a detective?",
        "Henry: Private eye. In the job of making women angrier at their husbands than they already were. Nobody ever said anything about murders or bloody wallets --",
        "Emily: What Paul should have done was swear that he was innocent and then beg me to go to Hal with this information, then Hal would have arrested Meg.",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm. Obviously, he knew that.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Henry: He knew that if the police found out that Meg had the wallet, then the suspicion would fall on her.",
        "Emily: What are you saying?",
        "Henry: I'm saying he opted for another way, Em.",
        "Emily: But why would he do that? Why would he confess to a crime that he didn't commit? That makes no sense.",
        "Henry: I don't -- I -- maybe -- I -- the man was nursed back to health by her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: According to the bail obvious he is protecting her for some reason.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey, I got a great idea. Let's get my money. We'll go to the airport. Fly to Bermuda.",
        "Emily: I hate Bermuda.",
        "Henry: How could you hate Bermuda? It's a vacation! Just the two of us in separate rooms. I'm not implying anything here. And I will pay for the whole thing. I'll get you a nice rum punch. Park your fanny out there by the pool. A couple of weeks, you'll be right as rain.",
        "Emily: That woman is not getting away with murder.",
        "Henry: And if she's innocent?",
        "Emily: Well, then why did she have Dusty Donovan's wallet in her hotel room? And why did she go bananas when -- when she caught you in her room?",
        "Henry: I broke into her room, Em. How do you expect her to react?",
        "Emily: You know what? If they arrest Meg, they're going to arrest Paul.",
        "Henry: Oh, we still got a lot of pending problems there.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but nothing quite as big as murder, right? And if I can just convince Paul to tell the police that it was Meg -- how does this sound? I got an idea.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Emily: He shot himself. He tried to kill himself, but he failed. And Meg found him, only she didn't go to the police. She'd locked him in the cabin. And that'll take care of the whole bail jumping charges. And then -- and then there's just the baby thing left. And Jennifer dropped the charges against me, right? And if she did that for me, then she would do that for him. I mean, he is her brother.",
        "Henry: Then what? Then what? You get married and live happily ever after? Emily it could happen.",
        "Henry: Oh, honey, honey, honey!",
        "Emily: He does not love Meg, okay? He does not love Meg and he's certainly not going to marry her, Henry. So maybe he was infatuated with her. The whole nurse thing. [Henry laughs] But now that he's better he -- I know that deep down he still loves me. I know that.",
        "Henry: Okay, whatever keeps you warm at night. This has been fun. There's a bar stool calling my name.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere. You stay put. I need you.",
        "Henry: Em, who're you calling?",
        "Emily: Yes, hi. I'd like to speak to Lieutenant Hal Munson.",
        "Henry: Emily, no. No. No.",
        "Emily: Yes, please. Tell him it's his ex-wife and she and Henry Coleman have something very important to tell him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: According to the bail agreement being negotiated for you, you agreed to stay away from the station house.",
        "Nick: Because nobody likes a dirty cop? But you know all about that.",
        "Jack: Be advised, we'll be watching, should you attempt to jump bail.",
        "Nick: I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to find out who did this to me. I'm not going down for this.",
        "Jack: We'll see. If you do get a jury to see it your way, you'll never be a cop again. That's all.",
        "Katie: Hey, I paid your bail. Are you okay?",
        "Jack: Hey, Katie. Yeah, I was just going over Nick's bail agreement. Once the paperwork's all done, he can be released.",
        "Katie: Well, that's good news.",
        "Jack: Remember what I said.",
        "Katie: What was that all about?",
        "Nick: He just thinks I'm dirty cop. That I'm going to jump bail.",
        "Katie: Still? After you told him the story? You did explain it to him, didn't you?",
        "Nick: Not exactly.",
        "Katie: But it was his wife who is behind this. She set you up, Nick. I know it! You have to tell him.",
        "Nick: I don't think I can do that.",

        "Luke: Did you see my mom earlier today?",
        "Jade: Yeah, I saw her when she was on her way out. Why?",
        "Luke: She was really worried about something.",
        "Jade: About what?",
        "Luke: She wouldn't say. Just that she'd tell me when she got back from her trip.",
        "Jade: She's going on a trip?",
        "Luke: Yeah, but she should be back in time for dinner.",
        "Jade: Is she going to Chicago?",
        "Luke: No, she took my grandmother's jet.",
        "Jade: Sounds urgent.",
        "Luke: Yeah, she got some news last night, or maybe this morning. Anyway, it left her really stressed. She was talking to someone on the phone about how she had to find out the truth.",
        "Jade: The truth about what?",
        "Luke: I don't know, she wouldn't tell me.",
        "Jade: Did she tell your dad?",
        "Luke: I don't think so. She said that she had to check on something before she told anybody. Anyway, she promised to tell me when she got back tonight.",

        "Lily: Hi, thank you for seeing me, Sister Elizabeth.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Oh, not at all, my child. I'm just sorry I wasn't here when you first called. But you know, I go on retreat every year. You look so much like your sister.",
        "Lily: So you were here when Rose was pregnant?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: She was a character, that one. Always up to something. Music wherever she went. Laughter.",
        "Lily: She was full of life.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Please, sit down.",
        "Lily: Oh, okay, thank you.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: There's something you want to ask me?",
        "Lily: Yes, as a matter of fact.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Well, you've come all this way, then I hope you will ask.",
        "Lily: I can see why Rose was happy here. You're very easy to talk to.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Rose was happy soul by nature. But she did have sad times here. It wasn't easy for her to part with her daughter.",
        "Lily: I can't imagine. I actually do have a few questions about her daughter.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Really? And your niece hasn't been able to answer them for you?",
        "Lily: Well, my niece hasn't been very forthcoming. I only learned recently that she was adopted around the time she was 5 years old. I thought, for sure, she would have been placed as an infant.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: That's always preferable but not always the case. But today it is easier. In any event, we loved having her here. She was such a sunny child.",
        "Lily: And you named her?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Yes, we name all the children that are born here. Sometimes when we place an infant at a very early age, the parents elect to change the name.",
        "Lily: But in this case?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: It stuck.",
        "Lily: It stuck, okay. I don't mean to be rude -- I mean, its beautiful name, don't get me wrong. But it just seems kind of an odd name for a child that was born in a religious community. That's kind of why I'm here.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: I don't know what you mean. Your niece was named after the founder of our order.",
        "Lily: The founder of your order was named Jade?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Jade? Good heavens, no. [Sister Elizabeth laughs] That wasn't her name. Rose's daughter was named Theresa.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: So last night or this morning, this something happened and your mom suddenly needs answers? About what?",
        "Luke: I told you. I don't know.",
        "Jade: Do you think that this has anything to do with that priest that was here?",
        "Luke: She didn't say. But he's been here before. Like I told you, my mom does charity work at his church.",
        "Faith: Luke? I didn't touch it, but your computer sort of fell.",
        "Luke: Faith! Come on. I told you, you can't touch my computer when I'm not in the room.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Jade: \"The Orphanage of the Little Flower.\" Oh, my God. She'll find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Theresa. I see. Perhaps her parents changed her name?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: No, I assure you, they did not.",
        "Lily: Maybe she changed her name herself. A lot of teenagers do that.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: In this case, no. I can vouch for that. Theresa is still Theresa. You see, she was here six months ago. She spent a few weeks with us. She was trying to find out some information about her birthmother.",
        "Lily: I don't understand.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: I'm not sure I do, either. Theresa was very fortunate. The couple who adopted her were just lovely people. But still, she had some questions about her birthmother and when she came of age, she returned to us -- well, to learn more about where she came from. Unfortunately, when she got here, Rose had already passed away and she was deeply disappointed. She wasn't sure if she wanted to go on with her search.",
        "Lily: So what changed her mind?",
        "Sr. Elizabeth: Theresa's parents, you must understand, are very, very modest people. And well, when she learned of your family's wealth and prominence, she was absolutely intimidated. Add to that she's of mixed race, which is a problem for some people, I'm afraid, quite frankly, that she was afraid she'd be rejected.",
        "Lily: That's just awful.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: It's always a risk. After all, her mother had gave her away and now she was dead. It's understandable that she might have some trepidation about how her family would react.",
        "Lily: I was thrilled. It was like having a piece of my sister back with me. But this business about her name, it's still very confusing to me. Are you sure she was calling herself Theresa when she came here?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Yes. In the weeks that she spent with us, she gathered documents and pictures and anecdotes. Everyone who knew Rose had a story about her. And then she left us.",
        "Lily: And went where?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: It was my understanding that she went home and had decided to abandon her search. She was very grateful for all the information she had been given, but she was ready to shut the door on her past now that she knew that her birthmother was dead. And I have no reason to assume that she changed her mind.",
        "Lily: So the girl that is in my house now, Jade, is not Rose's daughter?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Jade is most certainly not Rose's daughter.",
        "Lily: But what about the documents? We called here to verify the documents.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Yes, as I was told. But at the time, I assumed that she had decided to contact you after all. But now, given the information that I have --",
        "Lily: How did Jade find out about the documents? How did she find out about us?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Jade was born here several months before Rose arrived. We were able to place her as a very young infant. But I'm afraid the match was not good.",
        "Lily: How did you find out?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: She returned here as a teenager, begging for our help. We naturally took her in. And that's why she was here when Theresa arrived, looking for information. Jade befriended Theresa. Theresa was very trusting. But I am afraid that Jade betrayed that trust.",
        "Lily: So what are you saying?",
        "Sister Elizabeth: Jade is a very clever girl. She would have recognized the value of those documents. While she was here, she made a great show of needing our love and affection, all the while stealing from us every chance she got.",
        "Lily: Oh, no.",
        "Sister Elizabeth: I'm afraid she's a bit of a con artist, our Jade. At the very least, a brilliant liar. If she's told you that she's Rose's child, it can only mean that she wants something. Don't let her hurt your family the way she's hurt us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Paul is a lost cause. There's nothing that you can do to help him.",
        "Meg: And if he's innocent?",
        "Holden: If he's innocent, then the police will figure it out. Meg, ever since you were a little girl, you have wanted to help the wounded bird. It's in your nature. It's who you are. It's why you became a nurse.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and look how well that's worked out.",
        "Holden: And why is that? Because you got involved with Paul. Walk away. Let him take his lumps. You need to put yourself first. That's what you need to do. You don't have a job. You need to find a job. You're living in a hotel. When was the last time you saw my kids?",
        "Meg: I know, I know.",
        "Holden: I want you back. I miss you.",
        "Meg: I miss you, too. That's why I'm here.",

        "Hal: What were you doing in Meg Snyder's hotel room?",
        "Henry: Well, that's just it. I didn't know it was Meg's hotel room. I just thought it was a hotel room at the Lakeview, and I was checking out some views for a client that wanted me to do some surveillance from the window and then, the phone rang! And I needed a piece of paper to write a message.",
        "Hal: You answered somebody else's phone?",
        "Henry: I thought it was for me. Because I'd told the clerk I was there to check out a view.",
        "Hal: The clerk who gave you a pass key, which would never happen.",
        "Emily: No, but the point is, Henry found Dusty Donovan's wallet.",
        "Henry: Right, next to the phone. Actually, in a box next to the phone. Which I only opened because I needed a pencil to take down the message.",
        "Hal: You found Dusty Donovan's wallet in Meg Snyder's hotel room?",
        "Emily: Yes, and there was something on it. There were blood stains all over the wallet. No, really, I saw it with my own eyes! And there were credit cards and a driver's license and then Meg blew a fuse when she found out we'd seen it. And all of this was after Dusty went missing.",
        "Hal: And it didn't occur to you to mention this to me when you saw me at the station?",
        "Emily: I'm mentioning it to you now. And it proves what I've been saying all along. That Paul is innocent. Meg killed Dusty.",
