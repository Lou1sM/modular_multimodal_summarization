        "Damian: Go!",
        "Molly: Hi. Hope I'm not interrupting.",
        "Damian: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Molly: What's wrong, Damian? Three's a crowd?",
        "Lily: Where are Faith and Holden? Are they all right?",
        "Molly: They're fine, no thanks to this guy. But guess what, Damian? It's game over. This proves you're alive. All I have to do is hit \"Send\" and the rest of the world will know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Sure -- sure you're all right? Damian didn't hurt you, did he?",
        "Faith: I'm fine. How about you?",
        "Holden: Uh, it's just a headache. I'll survive.",
        "Faith: I'm so sorry, Dad. This is all my fault.",
        "Holden: No. No, it's not. Damian -- he took advantage of you, just like he did your mom and Luke. But it ends today.",
        "Faith: What are you gonna do?",
        "Holden: I'm gonna find him. You stay here. The police are gonna be here soon, all right?",
        "Faith: No. I want to go with you.",
        "Holden: No. You stay here. Keep your cell phone on. You wait for the police. I will call you as soon as I find your mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: What's this all about?",
        "Cop: Search warrant. We're looking for Holden Snyder.",
        "Luke: Well, that's ridiculous. You know where he is. You have him locked up in jail.",
        "Cop: Not anymore. He escaped.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: And I brought you these. Soft, cinnamon-raisin cookies -- your favorite. Ethan helped me make them. Oh, and look here. Here is a new picture of Eliza, yes. She's helping Sage make a snowman. Well, she's watching her. Sage is doing all the work. Isn't she adorable? Oh, my goodness, they grow so fast. It seems like only yesterday.",
        "Meg: Okay, Mama, stop, please. All these -- these cookies and photos and -- look, it's all really nice, but it doesn't change where I am or who I am right now.",
        "Emma: You're Meg Snyder. That's who you are. You're my daughter. You're my baby. And you are the mother of this beautiful little angel here. Look, Damian put you through a horrible ordeal, but you are finding your way back home, and I -- I'm sorry if I upset you. I'm just -- I'm just trying to make it a little easier for you.",
        "Meg: No, Ma, I appreciate everything you're doing. But it's just not what I need right now.",
        "Emma: And what do you think you need?",
        "Meg: Not to be reminded of how far away from everyone I am that I love and how I've lost everything.",
        "Emma: Meg, Meg, you haven't lost anything. We're all still here. We all love you. I love you. We're all waiting for you to get better. And you are. You are going to get better.",
        "Meg: Am I?",
        "Emma: Sweetheart, don't. Don't talk like that. Of course you are. Of course you are.",
        "Meg: You know, I wish I could believe it's that simple, but I know it's not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Take your finger, and you run it across the screen like that. It changes the -- oh! See? Look what you did.",
        "Emily: You know what? You keep that up, she's gonna want one of her own.",
        "Paul: Look what you did.",
        "Emily: She's like practically 2.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, 2 or 22, this one can have whatever she wants. And if you -- if you push this button right there, it will tell you the news of the world. You can find out what's going on just about anywhere.",
        "Emily: What? What did she do?",
        "Paul: It's not her.",
        "Emily: \"Holden Snyder escaped from Oakdale police custody earlier today as he was being transported to county jail. Snyder is being held on suspicion for the murder of shipping magnate Damian Grimaldi. Recent evidence has emerged that Grimaldi might, in fact, be alive and in hiding.\" Can that be true?",
        "Paul: With Damian, anything is possible, right? And if Holden skipped out, it's not only just possible, it's probably true. Come here.",
        "Emily: What -- where -- where are you going?",
        "Paul: Uh, I'm gonna take Eliza to go see Emma.",
        "Emily: Now? Why?",
        "Paul: Because Emma's the person in the world who has the most contact with Meg, and she can't share this little bit of information with Meg, because the last thing Meg needs right now is to know that Damian might be out there somewhere.",
        "Emily: Okay, uh, can't -- can't you do that with a phone call to the farm?",
        "Paul: I know. Emma's better in person, okay? And I'm sure she will love to see her little girl. So I'll see you soon, okay?",
        "Emily: Your phone.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Emily: Hello.",
        "Meg: Emily, its Meg.",
        "Emily: Meg, how are you? Is -- is something wrong? You just missed Paul.",
        "Meg: I'm calling because I need to talk to you. I need to see you right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You'd be a fool to cross me, Molly. You should know that by now.",
        "Molly: Hey! I'm the one holding your future in my hands. Try to remember that. Your threats no longer scare me.",
        "Lily: Damn it, Molly, what are you doing here? You're messing everything up, as usual!",
        "Molly: Right, yeah, because it looks like you had everything under control here. How could you do this to Holden?",
        "Lily: Do what?",
        "Molly: What? Help this psychopath go free while he rots in jail for a murder he didn't commit?",
        "Damian: Hey, shut up, both of you!",
        "Lily: How dare you! You just stay out of my life.",
        "Molly: Keep your hands off me. Let me tell you something. You want to go, go! Run away with Damian. He's the man you've always wanted. No one will even miss you.",
        "Lily: I would never leave my family.",
        "Molly: You already did, Lily, the moment you married Damian.",
        "Lily: You think you can take this place with my kids, with Holden?",
        "Molly: Oh, like you give a damn about them.",
        "Lily: You're nothing but trash, Molly.",
        "Molly: Oh, you think you're so much better than me, Lily? Holden chose me for a reason.",
        "Lily: Oh, yeah, and it's the same reason all those other guys chose you, too.",
        "Molly: You take that back.",
        "Lily: No, I won't.",
        "Damian: That's it! Stop! That's enough! This is insane. Don't let her goad you like that. Can't you see she's pushing your buttons?",
        "Lily: Damian, we're pushing yours. Go.",
        "[Damian groans]",
        "Molly: Quick! Get something to tie him up with! Aah!",
        "Damian: Stupid thing to do, Lily!",
        "Molly: Yeah, well, you got to give us girls credit for trying.",
        "Damian: Now you've left me no other choice.",
        "Molly: You're not gonna get away, Damian.",
        "Damian: Oh, yeah? I think my chances are a hell of a lot better than yours, Molly.",
        "Molly: No way! Holden's gonna be here any second.",
        "Damian: If that's true, then we don't have much time. Lily, I was hoping that I'd be able to convince you to see past your anger, that being with me you'd be able to remember how much you love me.",
        "Lily: I'm not the fool that you think I am.",
        "Damian: I never thought you were a fool. You're just not thinking clearly. You're letting Molly and Holden distract you.",
        "Lily: I'm thinking clearly for the first time in months, and I am seeing you for the monster that you really are.",
        "Damian: You're only seeing me for what I've been forced to become because no one will leave us alone! Once we're away from here, you'll see. You'll see. You'll remember how much we really belong together.",
        "Lily: I'm not going anywhere with you!",
        "Damian: Yes, you are. I'd hoped it would be willingly, but it looks like you're gonna make me do this the hard way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Faith, what are you doing here? And -- and where's Dad? They told me he escaped.",
        "Faith: He went off to find Damian and Mom.",
        "Luke: So Damian is alive? You saw him?",
        "Faith: Yeah.",
        "Luke: And -- and where is he now? Do you know where Mom and Dad --",
        "Faith: I don't know. They took off with Mom and Dad and Molly, and it just all happened so fast.",
        "Luke: All right, look, Faith, you have to tell me everything. Start at the beginning.",
        "Faith: Don't make me do that. I can't. Not now.",
        "Luke: Look, Faithy, I know you've been through hell. But it's really important that I know everything. How did Damian get to Mom?",
        "Faith: Through me.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Faith: It's all my fault.",
        "Luke: No, no. How could this be your fault?",
        "Faith: Damian told me all these lies about how there was some family member after him and how he had to pretend he was dead to fool this guy and how Mom was in danger and it was the only way to protect her.",
        "Luke: And you believed him?",
        "Faith: Yeah. I mean, it wouldn't be the first time there was some Grimaldi relative after us.",
        "Luke: So he threatened you? Did he hurt you?",
        "Faith: No. He just scared me. I was so stupid. I should have never listened. I just -- thought I was helping Mom and -- and Dad get out of jail.",
        "Luke: It -- it must have been really terrible for you.",
        "Faith: It was.",
        "Luke: And where is Dad now? Do you know?",
        "Faith: No. We were at some house in Forest Hills, and Damian knocked him out and disappeared with Mom.",
        "Luke: And -- and what about Molly? Where is she?",
        "Faith: She took off right after Dad. We found Dad, and she went after Damian and Mom. [Sleepily] She -- I don't know. I just feel -- I was scared.",
        "Luke: Faith, are you okay?",
        "Faith: I just feel a little dizzy.",
        "Luke: Your skin is really cold. Your hands are freezing.",
        "Faith: Its 20 degrees outside.",
        "Luke: Are you sure that's all it is?",
        "Faith: What do you mean?",
        "Luke: Faith, come on.",
        "Faith: What? I told you everything.",
        "Luke: No. No, I don't think you did. You're kind of mumbling. You're really dizzy. Faith, what's going on with you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Thank you for coming.",
        "Emily: You sounded so upset on the phone. Are you okay?",
        "Meg: No. No, I don't think I'm getting any better here.",
        "Emily: You have to give it time. Meg, you haven't been here that long. You've been through a horrifying experience with Damian, but he can't hurt you anymore.",
        "Meg: You don't still think that he could be alive? Because I do. What if he is still out there, waiting, uh, hiding, biding his time?",
        "Emily: Even if he is, he can't hurt you.",
        "Meg: I'm not just afraid of him, Emily! I'm afraid of myself!",
        "Emily: Okay. I -- I don't -- I don't follow.",
        "Meg: I was ready to kill Damian, Emily. I tried to, the same way he tried to with me. I was so obsessed and -- and out of control. I mean, that's how far I've been pushed.",
        "Emily: Well, you just have to give yourself time to heal.",
        "Meg: You know, Mama thinks I'm almost ready to go home. She brings me, uh, cookies, photos of Eliza, pillows. She thinks it's gonna help.",
        "Emily: I think she's just being supportive.",
        "Meg: It just reminds me that I'm not ready, that I'm nowhere close to being the mother that Eliza needs. And that's why I asked you here today. I need your help.",
        "Emily: What can I do?",
        "Meg: I need you to step in for me, Emily. I need you to be Eliza's mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: When was the last time you saw Meg?",
        "Emma: I just came from seeing her today. Why?",
        "Paul: Damian is alive, and he may even be back in town.",
        "Emma: Good Lord. Well, does Jack know? I mean, if he's alive, then they can let Holden go.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Meg didn't mention anything to you about Damian, did she?",
        "Emma: No, no, not a word.",
        "Paul: That's good. Maybe she doesn't know yet. We have to make sure it stays that way, because I -- I don't want anything to jeopardize Meg's mental health this way.",
        "Emma: [Scoffs] All of the sudden, you're concerned about Meg's well-being?",
        "Paul: She is Eliza's mother. Yeah, I don't want Damian to hurt her again.",
        "Emma: Well, how convenient for you that he's back in the picture.",
        "Paul: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Emma: Well, you know, you can, uh, know that he's the bad guy again. You can get everyone interested in focusing on keeping him away from Meg.",
        "Paul: Well, isn't that a good thing?",
        "Emma: Oh, yes, yes, it is, as long as it distracts from the fact that you are just as responsible for what happened to Meg as he is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Now, I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but you leave me with no choice.",
        "Molly: Holden, we're in here!",
        "Damian: Nice try, but you can only fool me once. Lily and I are leaving, even if I have to carry her out of here myself.",
        "Lily: Damian, no.",
        "Holden: Let her go, Damian. There's no way out. The police are right behind me.",
        "Damian: Then you should start saying your goodbyes.",
        "Lily: Holden.",
        "Holden: Are you two okay?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Molly: Yeah, just peachy.",
        "Holden: What are you gonna do, Damian? You gonna shoot us all?",
        "Damian: That's not a bad idea.",
        "Lily: Damian, I'm begging you, don't do this!",
        "Damian: Get over there. Don't think for a second I won't use this.",
        "Lily: For God's sake, Damian, don't dig yourself in any deeper.",
        "Damian: I said move.",
        "Molly: No!",
        "Damian: You know, I've been waiting for a long time for this moment.",
        "Holden: Damian, this fight, it's -- it's between you and me. It always has been. Just let Lily and Molly go.",
        "Lily: No. No, that's not the answer, either.",
        "Damian: The only answer is you, Lily, come with me.",
        "Lily: That's not gonna happen. Can't you see that? This is madness. You are never gonna get away. So just turn yourself in, please. Then we can finally end this.",
        "Damian: No. This doesn't have to be an ending, Lily. This could be our beginning.",
        "Holden: No, Damian, it's over.",
        "Holden: There's no way out. You can't escape.",
        "Damian: Lily, listen to me. We can still be happy. We can still have the life we always dreamed about. You know it in your heart. All you have to do is walk out that door with me, and we can leave all of this behind us.",
        "Lily: What happened to you, Damian? What happened to the man that I fell in love with, that gave me that wonderful book of poetry with all those beautiful inscriptions? It's like you never even existed.",
        "Damian: I'm right here, Lily. I'm standing right in front of you.",
        "Holden: Yeah, holding a gun on a woman that you're supposed to love.",
        "Damian: I didn't want the situation to turn out this way. But now I have no choice! Lily, listen to me. My life has no meaning without you in it. I'll do anything I have to to hold onto you.",
        "Lily: What about Luke? Do you want him to think of you as a murderer, as the man who killed his father?",
        "Damian: I am his father!",
        "Lily: I know, and he loves you. But that love will disappear if you pull that trigger. He -- he will never forgive you for this.",
        "Damian: Just say you'll come with me, Lily. Once we're away from this town, from all these people, people who have always been against us, you'll realize how much we belong together.",
        "Lily: That's not how this is gonna end, Damian.",
        "Holden: You're not taking her anywhere.",
        "Damian: You are in no position to stop me, Holden.",
        "Holden: You pull that trigger and there's no looking back. Can't you see that there's no escape?",
        "Damian: Then I have nothing to lose by killing you, do I?",
        "Lily: No. I -- I'll go wherever you want.",
        "Holden: Lily, stop.",
        "Lily: No. Put the gun down. Don't shoot him, please. I'll go. Just let Holden leave. Let -- let him and Molly go.",
        "Damian: Why? So he can follow us and track us down? He will, you know? We'll never be free of him as long as he's alive.",
        "Lily: Then you'll have to kill me, too.",
        "Damian: You don't know what you're saying, Lily.",
        "Lily: That's my final offer. I'll go, but only if you let Holden live.",
        "Holden: Lily, don't beg him for anything. This so-called love that you talk about, it's a sickness. And your marriage -- it's a fraud. I'm glad you're finally starting to see him for what he really is.",
        "Damian: Lily, don't listen to him. I can love you in ways he never could.",
        "Holden: Lily never loved you. It wasn't real. It was gratitude because you led her to believe that I was dead. You knew that that was the only way that you could win her away from me.",
        "Damian: That's a lie.",
        "Holden: Is it? I don't hear her saying that. The love that Lily and I had was pure. It was real, untouchable. And you knew that. It terrified you. And in the end, you knew that she would always choose me over you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I -- I know I'm asking a lot of you.",
        "Emily: No. No, it's just, uh, I'm surprised you'd offer it to me at all. We're not exactly best friends.",
        "Meg: But you're still the most logical choice. You're Paul's wife. You're with Eliza every day. You're there to hold her and comfort her and love her. Obviously, this is not gonna be forever. Just until I'm ready to go home.",
        "Emily: I still think that's gonna be sooner than you think.",
        "Meg: I'm not holding on to any false hopes. Look, uh, I know you and Paul wanted a child of your own.",
        "Emily: Yeah. I don't think that's gonna happen for us now.",
        "Meg: Oh. Well, then, that will make this request even harder to consider.",
        "Emily: No, no. I'm -- I'm happy that you would even consider me.",
        "Meg: Look, Emily, if you can find it in your heart to say yes --",
        "Emily: It would be my honor, Meg.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Emily: Aw, you're welcome.",
        "Meg: You have no idea what this means to me, how long I have thought about this. I just want what's best for Eliza.",
        "Emily: I know. I'm a mother, too, remember?",
        "Meg: Do you think Paul will have any objections?",
        "Emily: I think Paul is gonna be behind this 100%.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I know that things didn't work out with Meg and me, and I know that I could have been a better husband, and I am working really hard to make amends for that.",
        "Emma: Oh, you are, are you? Really? How? How does one make amends for stealing one's baby, a woman's baby, for driving her crazy? She was drowning because of you, Paul. I mean, it's no wonder that she just reached for anyone who showed her some kind -- some kind of consideration, some kind of feeling. Unfortunately, that person happened to be Damian.",
        "Paul: Well, Damian is finally out of her life, and all I want is to make sure that -- that it stays that way.",
        "Emma: She doesn't need any help from you.",
        "Paul: I --",
        "Emma: In fact, you are the last person that she needs on her side.",
        "Paul: I completely disagree.",
        "Emma: Well, frankly -- frankly, I care very little about your opinion. If you really, really want to help Meg, please, Paul, leave her alone. Just stay away from her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Look, Faith, I know you. I know when something's wrong. Did Damian give you something?",
        "Faith: What? No. Why would you say that?",
        "Luke: Because you're acting like you're on something right now.",
        "Faith: Well, I'm not.",
        "Luke: Let me see your purse.",
        "Faith: No.",
        "Luke: Why are you lying to me?",
        "Faith: I'm not.",
        "Luke: Faith, I can tell that you're high right now.",
        "Faith: Well, you would know.",
        "Luke: Yeah, you're right, I would. So why don't you tell me what happened?",
        "Faith: Damian was using me, all right? He made me lie to Mom and Dad. He made me take Mom to the place where he was hiding. And -- and when she went in, I freaked out, so I took something to calm down. It's not a big deal.",
        "Luke: What did you take?",
        "Faith: A couple pills. Stop looking at me like that. You used to drink when you were my age.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I know I did, Faith. And I'm not judging you. I'm just worried. I need to know what you took.",
        "Faith: It's not a big deal. Lay off, will you?",
        "Luke: Faith, you need to show me those pills. I need to see them, all right?",
        "Faith: I don't want to talk about this anymore.",
        "Luke: Look, Faith, I am not letting you out of this room until you show me what you took. I mean it.",
        "Faith: There. Satisfied?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: If your love was so pure and untouchable, how is it I was able to get in between you two? What Lily and I have is not a lie. It's stronger than you think. And you're going to take that knowledge with you to your grave.",
        "Lily: Damian, don't!",
        "[Molly groans]",
        "[Both grunting]",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "[Lily screams]",
        "[Sneezing]",
        "Damian: [Groans] Lily -- Lily, give me the gun.",
        "Lily: Not a chance.",
        "Damian: Lily, I'm begging you. Give me the gun. Come with me. We can still be happy. I can make this up to you.",
        "Lily: Damian, stop. It's over.",
        "Holden: Give me one good reason to pull this trigger.",
        "Cop: Drop it!",
        "Lily: He's the one you're after! Holden was just trying to defend us.",
        "Damian: Lily, know that I love you. I will always love you.",
        "Holden: Everything's gonna be okay. It's over, Lily. It's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay, I know for a fact that Meg does not blame you for what happened.",
        "Paul: You sure? I mean, if I really want to make amends, right, then I have to get her home to see Eliza.",
        "Emily: She's not ready for that.",
        "Paul: How do you know? What, do you know what Meg is thinking?",
        "Emily: I do, actually. When you left to go to Emma's, Meg called me and asked me to pay her a visit.",
        "Paul: What? You didn't tell her anything about Damian, did you?",
        "Emily: No. No, I mean, I went there thinking maybe she heard Damian was alive, but she hadn't, and I knew it wasn't my place to tell her, so --",
        "Paul: Well, that's good.",
        "Emily: She's in bad shape, Paul. She's scared and -- and she's afraid that she's not ready to leave Deerbrook. And she's not sure she's gonna be ready for a very long time.",
        "Paul: Well, that's up to the doctors to decide, don't you think?",
        "Emily: No, I think she knows what's going on in her head a little more than they do.",
        "Paul: Why would she tell you any of this?",
        "Emily: She asked me to look at Eliza for her.",
        "Paul: Eliza is very well taken care of.",
        "Emily: I don't think she meant it as a slight against you. She was asking me to step in as the role of Eliza's mother until she's better.",
        "Paul: Wait. Why -- why would she say that to you?",
        "Emily: Well, don't look so surprised.",
        "Paul: Well, weren't you?",
        "Emily: I was for a split second, and then it made sense to me. It made perfect sense. We're married. We love each other. We -- we live together. Eliza lives with us. I'm practically playing that role now.",
        "Paul: So you agreed?",
        "Emily: Yes.",
        "Paul: Pbht!",
        "Emily: What? What's wrong?",
        "Paul: I really wish you hadn't done that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Where did you get these?",
        "Faith: My roommate gave it to me when I sprained my ankle in basketball. I just forgot to give the bottle back.",
        "Luke: That's really convenient, Faith.",
        "Faith: You're making too much out of this.",
        "Luke: I'm just worried about you.",
        "Faith: Don't be.",
        "Luke: Look, Faith, these aren't like aspirin. You know, you can't just pop one whenever you feel like it. These are very, very addictive. You have to be careful.",
        "Faith: I know. I have been. You know, why are we even talking about this anyways? All that matters right now is finding Mom and Dad!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Is that really necessary?",
        "Cop: It's the law. He escaped from custody.",
        "Holden: Lily, its -- its okay. Now that they know that Damian's alive, it won't be for long. Listen, I -- I think what you need to do is go find Faith, let her know that this whole thing is over and that we're all okay.",
        "Lily: I feel horrible leaving you here like this.",
        "Holden: Don't worry about it. I'm fine. I'll meet you at the station. Listen, can I -- can I have one more minute? I -- I just need to speak to -- where did she go?",
        "Cop: Who?",
        "Holden: Molly. She was just here, and now she's not. All right, fine. Hey, there you are. Where did you go?",
        "Molly: Home, almost. Then I stopped myself and came back. I guess I'm just a glutton for punishment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What are you doing?",
        "Paul: I'm taking Eliza to go see Meg.",
        "Emily: I just got done telling you she's not ready for that. She said so herself. That's why she asked me to step in. Do you have any idea how hard that was for her?",
        "Paul: Look, Meg is confused, okay, and she's really scared. She doesn't realize how much she misses Eliza, how much she needs her. I'm certain that Meg will change her mind.",
        "Emily: You don't think I can handle the job, do you?",
        "Paul: No, come on. It's not that. It's not that at all. You're wonderful with Eliza. It's got nothing to do with you or with Eliza. This is about Meg. I -- I never showed her anything but the worst parts of me, and this is a chance for me to kind of make up for it.",
        "Emily: By forcing her into a situation she's not ready to face.",
        "Paul: Come on. She's stronger than she thinks. She just needs to be shown. And seeing Eliza -- that will show her.",
        "Emily: Okay, you're probably right.",
        "Paul: I know I'm right.",
        "Emily: Let's go.",
        "Paul: You're coming?",
        "Emily: You're not going alone. I'm going with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What a day, huh?",
        "Molly: Never a dull moment.",
        "Holden: I don't know if I should thank you or yell at you.",
        "Molly: I like the \"Thank you\" idea.",
        "Holden: Molly, you could have gotten yourself killed.",
        "Molly: But I didn't. We're all still standing.",
        "Holden: All you were supposed to do was follow Damian. You weren't supposed to play superhero and try to save the day.",
        "Molly: Sounds like you're not leaning towards a thank you after all.",
        "Holden: No, I'm just working my way up to it. Thank you. But you did not need to be that brave and courageous.",
        "Molly: I didn't think. I just acted. I do that a lot. I guess it's just in my DNA.",
        "Holden: You acted to save your boyfriend's ex-wife. How often does that happen?",
        "Molly: I can't even imagine what Lily must be going through emotionally.",
        "Holden: At least it's all over.",
        "Molly: So, uh, now what?",
        "Holden: I don't know. Damian goes to jail, I hope, and then we all just move on with our lives.",
        "Molly: How exactly are you planning on moving on with yours?",
        "Holden: I think we can figure that one out.",
        "Molly: Holden, I think we need to straighten some things out first, okay? I heard you talking to Damian about Lily, about your life together, about how real and pure your love always was. So I need to ask you for my own sake, where does that put me? Where does that put us?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith. Oh, my God, Baby. Thank God you're all right.",
        "Faith: Oh, Mom, I was worried about you. Where's Dad?",
        "Lily: He's on his way here.",
        "Faith: They brought in Damian.",
        "Lily: I know, Sweetie. Are you all right? You're -- you're so cold, and you look a little pale.",
        "Faith: I'm just stressed. Is it over now?",
        "Lily: It is. Where's Luke, Baby?",
        "Faith: In there with Damian.",
        "Luke: How could you do this?",
        "Damian: Luciano, I don't blame you for being angry with me.",
        "Luke: I don't want to hear any more of your lies. I trusted you. I called you my father. I let myself love you.",
        "Damian: I am your father, and I love you and respect you more than you will ever know.",
        "Luke: You don't respect me enough not to lie to me. No. Your kind of respect only goes so far.",
        "Damian: Luciano, everything I've done I've done for you to protect you and to protect the family, the Grimaldi name.",
        "Luke: Oh, to hell with the Grimaldi name!",
        "Damian: Don't ever say that, Luciano. The family, our empire, it's your legacy.",
        "Luke: I don't want it. I don't want anything to do with you. You're going away. Never come back.",
        "Damian: Son, please.",
        "Luke: No. Holden Snyder's my father -- my only father.",
        "Lily: How long has Damian been sending you those texts as Max?",
        "Faith: Not long. He said that if anyone found out that he was alive that we'd all be in danger. You would have done the same thing!",
        "Lily: Oh, I -- I have owned up to the mistakes I've made because of my involvement with Damian.",
        "Faith: No, you haven't. Face it. I'm not the one that let Damian into our lives. You are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Maybe you'd give me a moment alone with her, help her get ready?",
        "Emily: Sure. Of course. But be careful, okay? She's very fragile.",
        "Meg: Come in.",
        "Paul: Feel like company?",
        "Meg: Paul, hey.",
        "Paul: Hey yourself.",
        "Meg: I'm guessing, uh, Emily told you about our conversation earlier.",
        "Paul: Yeah, yeah. She mentioned something about it, yeah.",
        "Meg: Are you here to say no?",
        "Paul: No, not at all. Meg, I just want what's best for you. I hope you know that.",
        "Meg: I want to believe you do.",
        "Paul: And I know firsthand how hard it is to be here. You feel hopeless, completely overwhelmed.",
        "Meg: That's on a good day. [Laughs]",
        "Paul: Like you've lost your connection to the outside world.",
        "Meg: I have.",
        "Paul: No, you have not. Meg, we're all still here, you know? And you can turn this around for yourself I have no doubt.",
        "Meg: You know, I wish I could share your confidence.",
        "Paul: You should.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe someday. I know I'm just not ready yet. And that's why I asked Emily to take care of Eliza for me, to be the mother to her that I can't be.",
        "Paul: Right. Emily's gonna do everything that she can to help Eliza. But -- I feel like if you see Eliza that that might give you some hope, you know? I mean, it could help. It couldn't hurt.",
        "Meg: No. I -- I can't, not for her sake.",
        "Paul: Well, are you sure? 'Cause, I mean, she's -- she's right outside. She's -- she's here. She's with Emily.",
        "Meg: You brought her here? Why would you do that?",
        "Paul: Calm down, okay? She doesn't -- she doesn't know that -- that you're here in here. She doesn't really even know where she is. But I -- Meg, if you see her. Come on, if you hold her in your arms --",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no! I'm not ready! I'm not ready.",
        "Paul: How do you know if you don't even try?",
        "Meg: I don't want to take the chance, okay? I don't want her to see me like this. I don't want my own daughter to see me fall apart!",
        "Paul: You sure? Meg, come on. She's right outside.",
        "Meg: I said no!",
        "Paul: Okay, okay. I understand. Maybe sometime soon, all right?",
        "Meg: I can't promise that.",
        "Paul: Well, can you promise me something else?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: Promise me that you will keep your faith. Eliza, your family -- there's a lot of people in this world who love you. Don't give up.",
        "Emily: So the beautiful princess was lost -- lost out in the huge lake out in her tiny, tiny boat. She didn't think she would ever get back home. And off in the distance, at night, he took off his armor, and he dove into the water. He swam as fast as he could towards the beautiful princess. He was so strong. Oh, he was so strong, he lifted that boat right over his head, over the waves, and back to the shore, bringing the beautiful princess back where she belonged. The end. Ooh. [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I'm not gonna tell you that everything I said to Damian was a lie, 'cause it wasn't.",
        "Molly: Okay.",
        "Holden: Lily and I -- we built a life. We built a family, you know, on very honest love.",
        "Molly: And now you have a chance to get that back, all of it. I get that. And what we shared, it was fun while it lasted.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. What -- what I didn't say to Damian is this -- that even before he came into the picture, what Lily and I had, it was broken. And now that he's arrested, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change anything.",
        "Molly: You sure about that?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I'm sure. I'm very happy with where I am right now, in spite of these handcuffs and this terrible headache that I have right now.",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "Holden: I'm very happy here with you. Okay, I'm ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I'm very aware of my own failings and what my involvement with Damian has cost this family. We all have a lot of healing to do.",
        "Luke: Are you okay?",
        "Lily: I am now.",
        "Luke: Where's Dad?",
        "Lily: He's on his way here. Unfortunately, he's still in custody.",
        "Luke: Well, that can't last long. I mean, Damian's alive.",
        "Lily: I'm sure everything will work out. Oh, Luke, it's so good to see you. Seeing Damian must have been hard for you.",
        "Luke: Yeah. It was at first, but then it was kind of, um -- it was kind of liberating, you know, like -- like I am finally free of him.",
