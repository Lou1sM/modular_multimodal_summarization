        "Bob suspends Chris for working under the influence and when Chris recalls Emily being near his table at lunch he confronts her about her actions. Emily denies drugging Chris at first but then feels badly when she learns he was suspended from the hospital because of her prank. Chris later confronts Paul and tells him to stop letting Emily do his dirty work for him. Paul denies the accusation and then Chris tells him to watch his back because he will protect Sofie from him. Will feels betrayed by Paul because he is helping Sofie keep Hallie. Will accuses him of taking revenge on him because he lost his baby with Meg. Paul throws Will out of Fairwinds and Sofie also leaves because she doesn't want to cause trouble between brothers. Meg arrives to persuade Paul to stop helping Sofie for Hallie's sake and also admits to Paul that she will always have feelings for him but they are bad for each other because they love each other too much. Barbara tells Will and Gwen she persuaded Meg to talk to Paul and because of her treatments she almost faints. Will tells Gwen that he will never agree or understand why she gave Hallie back to Sofie but he will always love her above everything else. Emily helps Allison to discover that Gray Gerard's real name is Jerry Pulaski from the Southside of Chicago who seems clean but in truth has just never been caught. Matt kidnaps Henry on orders from Gray and takes him to the Chicago loop scenic shop and ties him to a pole next to a replica of Cowboy Jack. Vienna is heartbroken when Henry doesn't show up for their date leaving her a note saying he went to visit family and she is better off with Gray. Brad suspects Henry is in trouble when he figures out that a similar note left for Katie saying that Henry went to heal has heal spelled heel. Brad and Katie set out to find Henry because they fear that Gray has done something very bad to him."

        "Will: You're letting them live here? You're unbelievable. You know, I thought you'd changed. But, no, you didn't stab your own brother in the back.",
        "Paul: Will, nobody's trying to hurt you.",
        "Will: How -- how can you look me in the eye and say that when you're helping her take my daughter away?",
        "Paul: Nobody's taking anybody away. Gwen gave Hallie to Sofie voluntary. There's no coercion involved.",
        "Will: No, Gwen does not know what she's doing right now. She's freaked out. She's guilty and confused -- and how would you think that after everything we've been through, she would actually wanna give Hallie back --",
        "Paul: Hey, leave her alone and calm down. I think I have a way to make everybody happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: It's going to be okay. We'll figure it out, okay?",
        "Gwen: There's nothing to figure out. You know, we just -- we couldn't keep her.",
        "Barbara: I understand your guilt at taking a baby away from its mother. But you have to think about what's best for Hallie.",
        "Gwen: That's what I'm trying to do. I know that Will and I could have been great parents. But that little girl would have grown up knowing that we kept her from her mom. And I don't care how much we loved her. She would never be able to forgive us for that.",
        "Barbara: You know, there's got to be another way to get around this. Are you sure -- are you sure this is what you want?",
        "Gwen: No, it's not what I want. But it's what I had to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Dr. Stewart was clear. I can't let you in.",
        "Chris: You're a nurse. I'm a doctor. That's my patient, move --",
        "Bob: Nurse, I've got this. Susan Stewart told me that you're trying to make rounds under the influence. Is that true?",
        "Chris: No, of course not. Excuse me, Dad, I've got a patient --",
        "Bob: You're not going anywhere. As of this moment, you're suspended.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So, thank you for helping me find out about this Gerard guy.",
        "Emily: Hey, what's the use of running a paper if I can't help my sister with some high-level snooping?",
        "Alison: What's going on with you anyway?",
        "Emily: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: Before you said, you'd empowered yourself, how?",
        "Emily: Oh, it was no big deal. I just got back at someone who was annoying me a little.",
        "Assistant: Here's everything I could find.",
        "Emily: Oh, great, thank you.",
        "Assistant: Pretty interesting character.",
        "Emily: Well, it looks like you were right to have questions. It appears that this Gray Gerard isn't at all who he pretends to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, okay.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, look who decided to show up. You're only about six hours late.",
        "Brad: I know, I know, I'm sorry. But when you learn where I was, you're going to be thanking me.",
        "Katie: I doubt that. I spent the entire morning sampling corned beef and cabbage for our St. Patrick's Day special and learning how to brew green beer.",
        "Brad: Oh, Man, I missed that.",
        "Katie: We have one more segment for tomorrow. I really want to get this done and get out of here.",
        "Brad: Okay, get me up to speed and then I will tell you about the feat that I pulled off.",
        "Katie: Never mind. You haven't even been briefed. Just sit this one out, I'll do it myself.",
        "Brad: No, what's the topic?",
        "Katie: Hints on how to win back the one you've loved and lost.",
        "Brad: Are you kidding? I don't need to be briefed. That just happens to be my area of expertise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: Your usual, a glass of champagne?",
        "Vienna: No, thanks, I'm waiting for someone. We'll probably order a bottle when he gets here.",
        "Bartender: Who's the lucky guy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: So if you have lost the one you love, she --",
        "Katie: Or he --",
        "Brad: Can be won back with a little ingenuity --",
        "Katie: A very little --",
        "Brad: And a lot of perseverance.",
        "Stage manager: That's a wrap. Great job.",
        "Brad: Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "Katie: Okay, I have to admit, you did very well for someone flying by the seat of his pants.",
        "Brad: Well, I told you, I am an expert on this stuff.",
        "Katie: Since when?",
        "Brad: Since I brokered the deal that got Henry and Vienna back together.",
        "Katie: No way.",
        "Brad: Way. And they're probably kissing and making up as we speak.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Henry's always late.",
        "Customer: An empty seat next to a beautiful woman, this is --",
        "Vienna: This is taken. I'm sorry, I'm waiting for someone.",
        "Customer: I could be a seat filler, just until he shows.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry, but no one can take the place of my Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Shop manager: Hey, you can't leave a dead body in here.",
        "Matt: He's not dead, he'll be up in a few minutes, all right.",
        "Shop manager: Even worse. This is an office business.",
        "Matt: A business that belongs to Gray Gerard. And this delivery comes from him.",
        "Shop manager: I've already had police in here investigating.",
        "Matt: That's not my problem. Gray wants him to disappear for a couple of days, all right? I'm not going to lug him all around Chicago looking for another place to stash him. He's all yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So Gray Gerard is actually Jerry Pulaski from the south side of Chicago?",
        "Emily: Yup. It looks like this guy made a ton of money in the rackets, moved to Europe, changed his name, spent a whole lot of money turning himself into the new and improved Gray Gerard.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but did it work?",
        "Emily: I don't know. I mean, now that he's back, he -- he's made a lot of real estate investments, the guy's living the good life. How do you know this guy, Ali?",
        "Alison: Oh, I don't, but my friend Matt does, and he's real secretive about it. Does it say anything about this Gerard guy being in prison?",
        "Emily: Your friend Matt was in prison? What -- what is going on, Alison?",
        "Alison: That is what I'm trying to find out. Don't worry, the whole reason I'm doing all of this is to avoid trouble. I promise. So, please tell me what the file says.",
        "Emily: Well, amazingly, there are no convictions. This guy obviously had a good lawyer.",
        "Alison: Well, what about now? Anything shady?",
        "Emily: No, not that I can see.",
        "Alison: He's completely legit?",
        "Emily: I don't know -- either that, or he's being real careful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You can't suspend me. I'm sober.",
        "Bob: You can't even speak coherently. Clearly, you're on something.",
        "Chris: I haven't ingested anything except lunch. I turned down a glass of wine because I knew I was coming back to work. I had coffee.",
        "Bob: Chris, you're impaired. I want you to leave this hospital and take a taxi home.",
        "Chris: You can't do this, Dad. I'm clean. Give me a blood test.",
        "Bob: You really want me to do that? Look at yourself. How could you come to work in this condition?",
        "[Chris remembering]",
        "Chris: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I think I might know what happened.",
        "Bob: You think, huh? Well, there'll be an inquiry. You're not to come back here until further notice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: There is no way to make everyone happy. We tried to work things out and Sofie kidnapped Hallie. And now you're trying to help her.",
        "Paul: What I'm trying to do is --",
        "Will: Just save it, Paul. All you give damn about is yourself.",
        "Paul: What I'm trying to do is make sure that this innocent child gets the care and the home that she deserves.",
        "Will: She had that with Gwen and me.",
        "Paul: Well, apparently, Gwen didn't think it was the right place for her.",
        "Will: No, Gwen is feeling confused right now. And the judge rewarded us custody and I'm taking the baby back.",
        "Paul: No, you're not. Will, look -- nobody's going to sort anything out here, okay? Let's just leave it to the lawyers.",
        "Will: What is wrong with you, Paul? You lost your baby so you have to make sure I lose mine, too?",
        "Paul: You just crossed the line. Get out.",
        "Will: You know what, I'm not going to forget this. And you'll hear from my lawyer.",
        "Paul: Sofie, I'm really sorry you had to hear all that.",
        "Sofie: Coming here was a terrible idea. We're leaving.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You got Henry and Vienna to patch things up?",
        "Brad: Just call me Dr. Love.",
        "Katie: Yeah, more like Dr. Strange Love.",
        "Brad: You know, name-calling is a sign of flirtation. An adolescent sign, but a sign nonetheless.",
        "Katie: Okay, just how did you manage this relationship mending?",
        "Brad: It's elementary, my dear. I told them love is fickle. And that every relationship goes through growing pains.",
        "Katie: I think I've read your work in \"Teen Beat,\" Doctor.",
        "Brad: And during difficult times, it's important for the man to listen, to be open and honest because communication is the true erogenous zone.",
        "Katie: Shut up. How did you do it, for real?",
        "Brad: I told him to beg. Well, it worked. I mean, the three Bs, bonbons, begging and -- you know, women eat that stuff up.",
        "Katie: And the third \"B\"?",
        "Brad: The Bradmeister. Women can't resist.",
        "Katie: Oh, please, I'd love to see you beg.",
        "Brad: You know, it's not pretty. But Henry can pull it off. They are probably celebrating with champagne right now. So I think we should sneak over to the Lakeview for a little toast. They probably want to give me full kudos for intervening.",
        "Katie: Okay, this might be something I have to see to believe.",
        "Brad: Yeah? All right, let's go. Come on. What's wrong?",
        "Katie: Aren't you going to beg me?",
        "Brad: Don't push it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: This is late, even for Henry.",
        "Bartender: On the house.",
        "Bellhop: Vienna Hyatt. This note was left for you.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no.",
        "Bartender: Did something happen?",
        "Vienna: \"Vienna, I'm leaving town because I know I'm not good enough for you. You're better off with Gray. I've gone to visit my family and lick my wounds. I wish you a good life. Henry.\"",

        "[Henry is tied up to a table and he wakes up and sees Kit]",
        "Henry: What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Will, you all right?",
        "Will: You're not going to believe this. Guess where Sofie is now?",
        "Gwen: Is Hallie okay?",
        "Will: I went over to see Paul to get him to convince Sofie to give Hallie back and he has them living there at Fairwinds.",
        "Barbara: What? What is it about that girl that makes men jump to her rescue?",
        "Gwen: You can't really blame Sofie for trying to get all the help she can.",
        "Will: Oh, I don't blame Sofie. I blame Paul.",
        "Barbara: How could he side with that girl over you?",
        "Gwen: I don't think that's how he sees it.",
        "Will: Don't defend him!",
        "Gwen: I'm not defending him. I'm just saying that maybe we should try to put this behind us and realize that Hallie was never ours in the first place.",
        "Will: Gwen, how can you say that?",
        "Barbara: Fighting is only going to make this harder.",
        "Will: No, the hard part's coming. You did this out of guilt. And any minute now, you're going to wake up and realize the mistake you made and then I just hope it won't be too late.",
        "Barbara: What are you saying?",
        "Will: Well, think about it. With Paul's help, Sofie could actually take Hallie away from us legally.",
        "Barbara: Will's right. Someone's got to talk some sense into Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Meg: Barbara. Well, this can't be a social visit.",
        "Barbara: No, it's not, so let's skip the pleasantries. I need your help.",
        "Meg: What for?",
        "Barbara: I need you to talk to Paul.",
        "Meg: No way.",
        "Barbara: You haven't heard why.",
        "Meg: I don't need to. The last time I tried talking to him at your request he went into cardiac arrest. We're not good for each other.",
        "Barbara: Okay, please, just hear me out here. All right? For some reason, Paul has taken in Sofie Duran, and he is helping her keep Hallie from Will and Gwen.",
        "Meg: But I thought the judge awarded custody to them.",
        "Barbara: He did. But Gwen has been feeling guilty and in a moment of weakness, she gave Hallie back to Sofie.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, I can't believe you're asking me this. I helped Paul keep Johnny from Jennifer and it killed me.",
        "Barbara: I know that. But please, if you could just convince Paul that he needs to stay out of this. It's going to come between him and his brother. And you know what? Will's about the only family that Paul has left.",
        "Meg: He has you.",
        "Barbara: Brothers need each other.",
        "Meg: I just don't want to get in the middle of this.",
        "Barbara: Please, just talk to him, all right? He's recovering, he's in pain, he's not thinking straight. He's moved them into the house with him. So, if you don't want to do it for Paul, just think about that baby girl, because her well-being and her future depend on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: No one's going to be able to get through to Paul.",
        "Gwen: Maybe it's better that way.",
        "Will: How can you say that?",
        "Gwen: Don't you feel better knowing that Sofie is getting the support she needs to raise Hallie?",
        "Will: Gwen, she had that with us! And you had no right to give her back.",
        "Gwen: Will, please, understand that I did not do this to hurt you. Okay, we are keeping Hallie away from her mother and this isn't a woman who lives in another state or even another town. She lives here. And this girl wants a chance to raise her child.",
        "Will: Sofie gave Hallie up willingly.",
        "Gwen: She regretted it. Okay, just like I did.",
        "Will: Gwen, you had no right to make this decision without me.",
        "Gwen: I did it because I did not want to put you in the position to have to choose. So I did it on my own. Okay, and I understand that you may never be able to forgive me, but you have to know that I had no choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Sofie, Sofie, wait. Please -- please stay, huh? My family problems, they go way back. It's got nothing to do with you.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, right now, they have everything to do with me. Paul, you've been through a terrible trauma. You're trying to heal. You need your family.",
        "Paul: What I need -- it would be nice to have you around, you know? So I'm not just rambling around here wallowing in self-pity.",
        "Sofie: Is that what I am? A distraction? You know, that's worse than being a charity case.",
        "Paul: No, no, come on. I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Sofie: Okay, I appreciate your offer. I do, but I can't stay. I can't. Letting you take care of me would be taking the easy way out.",
        "Paul: Because being a single mom, that's easy. Hey, shh. Look, I can give the two of you security.",
        "Sofie: If I'm going to prove to myself and to the rest of the world that I'm fit to be a mother, I need to do this on my own.",
        "[Baby fusses]",
        "Paul: It's a giant, empty house, Sofie. And, look, making it on your own is -- believe me, it's overrated.",
        "Sofie: Thank you, but we shouldn't have come here in the first place.",
        "Paul: What are you doing here?",
        "Meg: This was a mistake.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. Don't, please. Please. I'm glad you're here. It's just -- it's kind of a surprise, that's all.",
        "Meg: Barbara asked me to come.",
        "Paul: So, what's my mother up to now?",
        "Meg: Was that Will's adopted baby and the birth mother that I just saw leaving?",
        "Paul: Is that why my she sent you? Wow, news travels fast.",
        "Meg: Okay look, your mother had this crazy idea that I could talk you out of inviting Sofie to live with you.",
        "Paul: Too late for that.",
        "Meg: So she's moving in?",
        "Paul: Why, would it bother you if she did?",
        "Meg: I don't care who you live with. But is she worth losing your relationship with Will?",
        "Paul: You don't need to worry, she turned me down, rejected me.",
        "Meg: Oh, smart girl.",
        "Paul: What are you doing here? Really, Meg, you're not one to do my mom a favor.",
        "Meg: Your mother and Will were upset, so I just came to see if you were all right.",
        "Paul: What do you care?",
        "Meg: You got me, Paul. I'm here because I do care. I don't know why, but I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Forget whether or not I'm going to be able to forgive you, how are you going to forgive yourself when you wake up and you realize what you did?",
        "Gwen: Listen. Will, please, listen. Every ounce of me hated giving Hallie back, but I still think that it was the right thing to do. And it is going to be hard. I think it's going to be very hard for the both of us, but we just need to put our focus on other areas of our lives, and just get through this, please, together, any way that we can.",
        "Will: You really think that anything is going to make up for losing Hallie?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Barbara: I convinced Meg to go talk to Paul, but I don't know if it's going to do any good. We know how Paul is when he gets it into his head that he's doing the right thing.",
        "Will: Well, it's was worth a try, Mom.",
        "Barbara: I don't know. I mean, if Paul is supporting Sofie in this, you may never get Hallie back.",

        "Emily: What are you talking about?",
        "Chris: I've been out of it ever since lunch.",
        "Emily: Well, maybe your new, little girlfriend went to your head.",
        "Chris: This isn't a joke, Emily. I know you drugged me.",
        "Emily: Don't be ridiculous.",
        "Chris: What was it? Hmm? I mean, what did you put in my coffee? I could have killed a patient.",
        "Emily: You went back to work? I thought you were going to go back upstairs for a little afternoon --",
        "Chris: No, no, no! I was on my lunch break! And when I got back work your mother reported me for being under the influence, and then my father, he suspended me.",
        "Emily: Oh my God. I didn't mean for that to happen.",
        "Chris: So you admit it? You did this to me!",

        "[Henry starts talking to the dummy]",
        "Henry: What'd they get you for? Chewing the scenery? You're a really creepy dude. I don't know what you're grinning about, you're no better off than I am. We're both just a couple of dumped dummies. When I get my hands on the guy who kept me from the most important date of my life, I swear. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: Henry is a cad. He can't be trusted, Vienna. I mean, look at all the terrible things that he's done to you. First, he loses all your money, then the diner, and now he's just takes off. He's a coward. You deserve better.",
        "Katie: Oh, this is one time I wish I'd been wrong. I knew you couldn't pull it off.",
        "Brad: I did. I had.",
        "Matt: Thank you for covering for me.",
        "Brad: Vienna, Henry totally put his heart out to you, how could you ditch him for this tool?",
        "Vienna: I didn't ditch Henry. He ditched me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Maybe it's time to look on the bright side here. You know? I mean, I've never been a glass is half full kind of guy, unless it's a martini glass and someone else is buying. But there's nothing to make a guy turn over a new leaf like being locked up with Chuckie. So, let's look at the evidence, shall we? If Gray went through all this trouble to get rid of me, it must mean that he is worried that Vienna still has feelings for me. Which means, that in spite of everything, she still loves me. Which means, that I actually have a shot, Chuckie, if I can just get out of here! Come on! For the love of peat moss, would you make like a log and roll over here, please? I need to get out of here before it's too late!",

        "Vienna: Henry's gone.",
        "Brad: I don't get it. When I left him, he was putting on his best striped shirt on his way to meet you.",
        "Gray: Yeah, well, clearly he changed his mind.",
        "Katie: Brad, can I talk to you for a minute? I don't think this letter's from Henry.",
        "Brad: Well, I know he's weird, you know, but it's old fashioned.",
        "Katie: Yeah, exactly. He's old fashioned. He hand writes notes, and he uses his own stationary. Plus, he says he's going to go visit his family, he would never do that. He hates them.",
        "Brad: Well, what about Maddie? He loves her.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and he would mention her by name if that's who he was going to see. Something's happened to Henry. I know it.",
        "Brad: Don't jump to conclusions. Henry's a coward, maybe he just got cold feet. Let's go upstairs and check out the room before we panic. Okay?",
        "Katie: Okay. Vienna, I'm so sorry about Henry. Don't give up on him. Brad and I have something to take care of, so I'll call you soon.",
        "Vienna: Great, everybody's leaving me.",
        "Matt: Let me top you off? You've got trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: It was a prank. A little prank. I was annoyed at your attitude, so I slipped a few pills in your coffee when you weren't --",
        "Chris: Yeah, yeah, yeah! A prank is harmless! What you did was dangerous!",
        "Emily: Dangerous? My mother gave me the pills, I knew it was safe.",
        "Chris: Maybe for someone who knows they're taking them.",
        "Emily: I didn't mean to hurt you, okay? It was just a little payback! I thought I'd slow things down on your date with little miss sunshine.",
        "Chris: And running into me with the pills -- I don't believe it was quite so spur of the moment.",
        "Emily: You know what? Don't flatter yourself. I don't sit around coming up with ways to torture you. In case you haven't noticed, I have a job. A busy job.",
        "Chris: Oh, but I know someone that has a lot of time on his hands that would like to see me out of commission.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about?",
        "Chris: I never thought you'd sink so low you'd do Paul Ryan's dirty work for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Well, it's nice to know that you still care.",
        "Meg: I never said that I didn't care about you, Paul. That's never been our problem. We care about each other too much.",
        "Paul: That's a problem?",
        "Meg: We're not good for each other.",
        "Paul: Love's not good? Love's always good.",
        "Meg: Look at you. One minute you're asking Sofie and the baby to move in with you, and the next, you're trying to get me back. Are you that scared to be alone?",
        "Paul: I'm terrified of being without you.",
        "Meg: You're grasping at straws, Paul. You know, you should be taking this time to see where your life is going, and move on.",
        "Paul: I don't want to move on. Not without you.",
        "Meg: Oh. It looks like you already have.",
        "Paul: Meg, when I saw Sofie with that baby, all I could think about was our son. We lost our son because of me. And helping her is some weird way to try and heal that.",
        "Meg: Well, nothing can heal that.",
        "Paul: I know. I'll never get over losing your baby.",
        "Meg: I have to go.",
        "Paul: Hey. Can I call you?",
        "Meg: No -- you know, I don't think that's going to be a good idea.",
        "Paul: Well, what if I'm having problems with my really bad burns?",
        "Meg: Call the hospital.",
        "Paul: What if I'm having problems with my really bad life?",
        "Meg: You know, there's no point pretending we're friends, Paul. We were lovers, we were conspirators. But we were never really friends.",
        "Paul: You are my best friend. You're my only friend.",
        "Meg: Yeah, friends don't hurt each other.",
        "Paul: Okay. So, you want to be friends? Will you think about it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You think I did this for Paul Ryan? You know what? I was this close to apologizing to you, but I've changed my mind. I don't regret a damn thing I did. In fact, you deserved everything you got. You deserve it all for being -- uptight and judgmental and dumping me when you found out about my past.",
        "Chris: Yeah, and slipping me some pills on Paul Ryan's behalf, that was supposed to show me how wrong I was to judge you?",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, no. What I did was totally personal. If it happened to help Paul, then that's completely beside the point.",
        "Chris: So you admit Paul had a hand in it.",
        "Emily: I'm not admitting a damn thing.",
        "Chris: Well, I guess being a prostitute wasn't low enough for you. God help you if you're doing Paul Ryan's dirty work for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Here, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. I'm okay, I really am.",
        "Gwen: You almost fainted.",
        "Barbara: I'm just so upset. I desperately want this family to be together. I am so sick of all this fighting.",
        "Will: Well, that's impossible, Mom. You know that by now.",
        "Barbara: I just don't want this to tear you two apart. This baby is important, but your marriage is more so.",
        "Gwen: We know that.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'll let you two talk.",
        "Will: Mom, I think you should stay here. Let me call Uncle Bob.",
        "Barbara: No, I'm fine.",
        "Will: You should rest.",
        "Barbara: I really am. I need some rest and a cup of hot tea. You guys talk. Listen, life is short, and love is precious. Don't waste it, okay? I love you both.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: He didn't take any of his stuff.",
        "Brad: And the mini-bar is fully stocked.",
        "Katie: Maybe this is just something that Henry cooked up to get Vienna to feel sorry for him.",
        "Brad: Why would he do that when he had a surefire plan to win her back?",
        "Katie: Oh, right. I forgot his session with Dr. Strange Love.",
        "Brad: What's that?",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: This. \"Vienna deserves better than me. I'm taking a few days away to heal. I'll call you when I get back. Henry.\"",
        "Katie: Maybe you were right. Maybe Henry just couldn't face the possibility of rejection.",
        "Brad: No. This note's a lot of bull. Henry's in some trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, I'm worried about your mom.",
        "Will: It's probably just stress like she said. A lot of that going around.",
        "Gwen: Will, you have to believe me when I say that I wouldn't have been able to live with myself if we had kept Hallie knowing Sofie wanted her so much.",
        "Will: So you said.",
        "Gwen: Look, you asked me earlier how I was going to get through this, and I came up with some junk about pouring all of my energies into other areas of my life. But the truth of the matter is, I have no idea how I'm going to get through this. But I do know that I won't make it if I don't have you.",
        "Will: I don't know if I'm ever going to be able to agree with what you did. I miss her. But -- you're still the most important thing to me in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I don't know how we're going to do this, but I'm gonna find a way. I promise. I can be a good mother. I can. Okay? You're gonna help me figure it out, right?",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Lucky me, another house call.",
        "Chris: I can't believe you have Emily doing your dirty work. That's a new low, even for you.",
        "Paul: I don't know what you're talking about. But I am really curious. This sounds like something I would enjoy.",
        "Chris: Playing innocent really doesn't suit you. Those pills Emily slipped me, they worked. I was suspended from the hospital.",
        "Paul: Oh, well that's great. But credit where credit is due, I really -- if Emily did this, it was all on her own.",
        "Chris: You two are pathetic.",
        "Paul: But good for her. For giving you a little bit of the pain that you gave to her.",
        "Chris: I pity you. If all you've learned from your near-death experience is to turn people against each other and prey on young, helpless women --",
        "Paul: Are you talking about Sofie? Well, you couldn't be talking about Emily because she's mature and she's empowered. I know, I have a bullet scar to prove it.",
        "Chris: Sofie's a sweet, innocent girl. Why don't you leave her alone?",
        "Paul: You're my doctor, right? So you of all people know that I can barely make it out of this house. So if Sofie's hanging out here, she's doing it of her own accord. Does that make you angry?",
        "Chris: And to think, I had your life in my hands.",
        "Paul: Oh, big up for the Hippocratic Oath.",
        "Chris: If this is how you want to play it, fine. Watch your back.",
        "Paul: Does this mean I have to get a new doctor?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: \"Taking a few days away to heal?\" Henry did not write this.",
        "Katie: Well, he's a little more sensitive than you are.",
        "Brad: And he's smarter. Its spelled h-e-e-l.",
        "Katie: Oh my God. This isn't Henry. Who did this? What do you think happened?",
        "Brad: I'm not sure. But I bet Gray had something to do with it. He'd do anything to keep Henry away from Vienna. And we got to stop him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: Why don't you go upstairs and lie down for a little while?",
        "Vienna: I don't want to be alone.",
        "Gray: No, you won't. Don't worry. I know exactly what you need to chase the blues away. Okay? So, why don't you go up to the room, you splash a little water on that beautiful face, and I'll be right up with a surprise.",
        "Matt: Henry's friends are suspicious about him disappearing.",
        "Gray: Yeah? So do something about it.",
        "Matt: I've put myself at risk for an awful lot of things that have nothing to do with the plan, all because you have the hots for that girl. That is not what I signed up for.",
        "Gray: Yeah. But you did sign up. So stop asking me questions, and do what I say.",
        "Matt: What are you going to do about Coleman?",
        "Gray: Don't worry about it, Matt. Okay? In a couple of days I'll go rescue Henry myself, I'll come back the hero. It's not a big deal, so don't make it out to be one.",

        "Alison: Good evening, Mr. Pulawski.",

        "[Henry singing] 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer, take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.",
        "Henry: Don't be shy. I bet you kill at karaoke. And don't tell me you don't know any drinking songs because you've got a wooden leg. Ah-ha-ha-ha. Oh.",
        "[Henry singing] 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer take one down, pass it around Vienna!",
        "Gray: This ought to make you feel a little better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Elevator dings]",
        "Katie: Wait a second.",
        "Brad: What now?",
        "Katie: How could I be so stupid?",
        "Brad: What, what?",
        "Katie: You set this up, didn't you, with Henry? So what's the plan, huh? We go find Henry, and we get stranded with only a bear rug and a warm, roaring fireplace to keep us warm? I cannot believe I fell for this again, another one of your schemes.",
        "Brad: Katie, believe it or not, not everything I do is about trying to get you naked. So, while I like the way you're thinking, believe me, this is for real. And as hard as it is for you to imagine that I could be right about anything, if I am right, and Gray did do something to Henry, and you don't do something about it, you're never going to forgive yourself.",
        "Katie: You're right. Okay. Let's nail this jerk and find Henry.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Noah: Is this okay with you, because if you have any doubts about this -- I won't go through with it.",
        "Lily: Ameera's gone. I don't know where she is.",
        "Jack: That car's been following us for some time. I don't think it's the cop that was at the house. Hold on, I'm going to try to lose him.",
