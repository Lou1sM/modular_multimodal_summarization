        "Emily and Allison talk about how she wants to try again with Casey, as Emily hides her dismay. Casey tries to apologize to Matt, but he is hearing it. He even tells Casey that Allison told him that she doesn't want to be around him anymore and wants to be with him, as Casey believes him especially when Allison shows up to see Matt. Casey stomps out without a word. Matt tries to guilt Allison into spending time with him; she can see how things go with Casey when she gets back from their short trip, as Allison finally jumps onboard. Emily enlists Jade's services again to sleep with Casey and make it so Allison finds out, but what she doesn't know is Allison is listening outside the door. Allison confronts Emily, who tries to explain she is worried that she is going to get hurt by Casey. Allison is sure that it is purely selfish on her part \u0096 she doesn't want Casey, but no one else can have him either. Allison goes charging over to Casey's house afterwards where Jade has gone to and is trying to seduce Casey again after he is upset about what Matt told him. Allison rips Jade off of him and slaps her across the face. Jade tries to deny Allison's accusations at first, but then cops to it. Casey kicks her out and Allison and Casey finally agree to start over after they set a few people straight. Casey sees Emily and after they have it out, he asks for her blessing. Allison confronts Matt and asks him to understand why she needs to see this through, as she says goodbye to him. Emily tells Jade to back off because she thinks that after everyone stops trying to pull Allison and Casey apart, they will fall apart all on their own and then she can have Casey all to herself. Parker enlists the help of a lawyer in respect to some clauses in his trust fund. Parker wants his mom to be removed as trustee so they can't use that money to send him away. Liberty is unsure of this route because it will really hurt his parents. Parker is determined to do whatever he has to, to stay in town. The lawyer makes a request to a judge about an injunction to stop him from being sent away, as they await word. Craig admits to Carly that it was Lucy that found Parker and Liberty, as Carly doesn't know if she can trust him again. When Carly goes to thank Lucy, she asks for her help getting her dad back on her good side. Carly isn't sure at first, but then makes up with Craig and offers to take him to lunch where Lucy is waiting. She tries to mend their fences, but Craig won't be swayed, as Lucy leaves dismayed. Carly threatens to no longer be partners with Craig if he treats his family so badly. After hearing Carly out, Craig goes to see Lucy and makes amends. Lucy is thrilled, as Craig puts on one condition \u0096 that she can no longer be friends with Dusty because he can't trust that they won't leave town with Johnny. Lucy thinks about this and then agrees, but asks that he not rule that his mind could change. Craig agrees to that. Allison and Casey meet up to begin their do-over, as they share a kiss. Craig comes to Carly to tell her what happened, as he can't believe Lucy chose him over Dusty. Carly can't believe he put on conditions and only hopes that Lucy is telling the truth. Lucy makes a mysterious call to someone telling them that they are back in business because she is back in her father's good graces."

        "Matt: 'Cause, who wouldn't jump to that conclusion?",
        "Casey: Yes, I know I shouldn't have gone there. I don't know why I did.",
        "Matt: You don't know why, huh? Maybe, it had something to do with you wanting me out of the picture.",
        "Casey: This has nothing to do with Alison.",
        "Matt: Don't insult my intelligence. You want her, you thought I was in the way, next thing you know, I'm a drug dealer.",
        "Casey: There is no way I was going to try to send you back to jail.",
        "Matt: Is that right?",

        "Alison: I won't.",
        "Emily: You sure? You know, you're just fighting off these drugs. And -- you're vulnerable. And you're emotional. And I don't want Casey taking advantage of that.",
        "Alison: Well, if all he wants is sex, he has easier options than me.",
        "Emily: Whoa, that's not what I meant.",
        "Alison: Look, this is always going to be a touchy subject for us. I just wanted you to know, but we don't have to keep talking about it.",
        "Emily: Okay. Okay, works for me.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Emily: Can I give you a ride home now?",

        "Carly: I have a question for you.",
        "Craig: Hit me.",
        "Carly: It's not that I don't appreciate you bringing the kids home.",
        "Craig: But?",
        "Carly: How did you know where they were?",
        "Craig: Remember, Jack asked me that same question?",

        "Craig: What's the difference?",
        "Carly: Well, it just bothers me that you were able to find my son when I wasn't.",

        "Carly: Tell me how you knew where they were.",
        "Craig: Lucy told me.",

        "Casey: Matt, you're crossing the line.",
        "Matt: I'm just trying to figure you out, I'm sorry. You're with Alison, and then you're not. You're with Jade, and then you're not. You try to get me set up, and then you're really sorry about it. I mean, do you ever think about what you do before you do it?",
        "Casey: Are you done?",
        "Matt: Alison deserves better than you.",
        "Casey: Like who, huh? You?",
        "Matt: I already saved her life. You're just trying to wreck it.",
        "Casey: Much as I like talking to you, I have to go.",
        "Matt: She's not going to give you another chance.",

        "Carly: Why would you take credit for something Lucy did?",
        "Craig: I just told you, didn't I?",
        "Carly: A day late. After I treated you like some kind of hero. Why would you do that?",
        "Craig: Because I like it when you treat me like a hero.",
        "Carly: What is wrong with you?",
        "Craig: You mean in terms of substance or style?",
        "Carly: I mean in terms of the fact that have to make everything like ten times more difficult than it has to be.",
        "Craig: I'd say that's style.",
        "Carly: I -- I'm trying to be serious.",
        "Craig: I already told you. I enjoy your appreciation.",
        "Carly: I hope it was worth it.",
        "Craig: You're not going to make a big deal out of this, are you?",
        "Carly: Out of what? Your fundamental dishonesty which makes it impossible for me to trust you?",
        "Craig: Well, I'd say that's pretty big.",
        "Carly: I'm not in the mood for your jokes, Craig.",
        "Craig: Well, is there anything I can do?",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Well, what was Casey doing here?",
        "Matt: I wish I knew. He came in here, he said he wanted to talk. I started talking, he freaks out, that's when he saw you, and then he's gone.",
        "Alison: Oh, I don't get it. I thought we were getting somewhere.",
        "Matt: Well, you never know with him from one minute to the next, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Matt: How you feeling?",
        "Alison: Pretty good. Finally that junk is all out of my system. Now I just -- have to make sure I don't go back for more.",
        "Matt: Hey, you're tough. You can handle it.",
        "Alison: How about you?",
        "Matt: I, uh, I feel better than I look, I think.",
        "Alison: Yeah, let's hope so.",
        "Matt: I'm glad you can joke about that after what you've been through.",
        "Alison: Yeah, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be doing anything at all.",
        "Matt: Just thank God I found you in time.",
        "Alison: Yeah. I'll never forget it.",
        "Matt: Yeah, I don't think I will either.",
        "Alison: Well, at least Casey apologized.",
        "Matt: I think that was more for your sake than mine.",
        "Alison: Well, I don't think so.",
        "Matt: You really going to give him another chance? Why?",
        "Alison: I just need to know if there's anything there.",
        "Matt: Even if there is, how many chances does he get to ruin it?",
        "Alison: Well, I don't think he will this time.",
        "Matt: Isn't that what you thought last time? And then you saw him with Jade?",
        "Alison: It's different now.",
        "Matt: Is that what that whole nice, friendly greeting was about before?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I'll have to ask him.",
        "Matt: Can I make a suggestion?",
        "Alison: Sure.",
        "Matt: How about you give me a chance instead?",
        "Alison: Matt --",
        "Matt: Look, I know I'm not looking my best right now, okay? But I still have my charm. And my fantastic sense of humor. And let's not forget about the amazing display of physical courage I showed when I saved your life.",
        "Alison: I haven't forgotten.",
        "Matt: So how about this? Let's just go away for a couple of days. Separate rooms, whatever, you know? No pressure. But just -- give us a chance to get out of here, get some fresh air, you know, spend some time together. Casey'll still be here when we get back.",
        "Alison: It sounds tempting.",
        "Matt: Could be fun.",
        "Alison: And maybe I do owe you something for that amazing display of physical courage.",
        "Matt: I wasn't going to bring it up again, but since you did --",
        "Alison: Okay. Let's do it.",
        "Matt: Really?",
        "Alison: Yeah, really.",
        "Matt: All right, I'll make the plans. Meet me back here when I'm done, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: What's your emergency?",
        "Emily: My sister and Casey are getting back together.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I heard.",
        "Emily: I paid you a lot of money to make sure that wouldn't happen.",
        "Jade: And you got your money's worth.",
        "Emily: That's not how I see it.",
        "Jade: Look, I did everything I could, okay? Everything.",
        "Emily: Well, apparently, you're not very good at it.",
        "Jade: Oh, go to hell!",
        "Emily: I want to know what happened, Jade.",
        "Jade: Ask your sister. Me and Casey were fine until she decided to yank on his leash again, and he went running.",
        "Emily: Well, why don't you stop him?",
        "Jade: How, exactly?",
        "Emily: I don't know, use your imagination! Or do I need to give you a lecture on what Casey likes these days?",
        "Jade: I thought you didn't like the idea of me sleeping with him.",
        "Emily: I don't. But desperate times call for desperate measures.",
        "Jade: Can I just point out how sick this is?",
        "Emily: I'll pay you double what I paid you the last time.",
        "Jade: Double? Really?",
        "Emily: If that's what it takes to get my sister to look someplace else.",
        "Jade: You've got a serious problem.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, that's my problem. Are you going to do it or not?",
        "Jade: You know, I'd do it for nothing. But I like getting paid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Lucy, you busy?",
        "Lucy: No, I just finished my rounds.",
        "Carly: I want to thank you.",
        "Lucy: For what?",
        "Carly: Your father told me that you were the one who found Parker and Liberty.",
        "Lucy: Oh, well, but he was the one who brought them back home safely.",
        "Carly: After you tracked them down. Why would you let him take all the credit?",
        "Lucy: I figured he needed a win.",
        "Carly: I'm sure there was some negotiation.",
        "Lucy: Uh, we talked. That's all.",
        "Carly: Well, I just wanted to thank the right person, that's all.",
        "Lucy: I'm glad he -- that your son got home safely.",
        "Carly: Me too. So, if there's anything I can do to repay you, let me know. Okay?",
        "Lucy: Actually, I did. I asked you to put in a good word for me with my father and -- you shut me down.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry about that. I just thought your father would resent me, if I tried to give him advice.",
        "Lucy: Can I get you to reconsider? Because I could really still use your help patching things up with him.",
        "Carly: Do you really think that's possible?",
        "Lucy: Do you think that I'm crazy for hoping that it is?",
        "Carly: What I think is that your father's extremely hard-headed about certain things. And when it comes to you, I'm not sure I can influence him at all.",
        "Lucy: Well, that's not the answer I was hoping to hear, but I appreciate your honesty. And I'm glad you got your son back home. Enjoy every minute you get with him. You never know when it might end.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: You know my parents cannot afford to send me to Eastlake. They can barely keep J.J. there. So they're using my trust fund to send me.",
        "Liberty: So?",
        "Parker: So there's a clause that says the funds cannot be used for a purpose that isn't conducive to the welfare of the beneficiary.",
        "Liberty: Do I look like I went to law school, or something?",
        "Parker: It means that the money cannot be used for anything that isn't in my best interest.",
        "Liberty: Okay, well, who decides?",
        "Parker: Well, my mom, since she's the trustee.",
        "Liberty: I don't see how that fixes your problem.",
        "Parker: Well, that's because you haven't read sub-clause six.",
        "Liberty: Oh, how'd I miss that one?",
        "Parker: I know, seriously. But, what it says is that I can have my attorney challenge any expenditure, and a judge has to deem it in my best interest.",
        "Liberty: Okay, you have an attorney?",
        "Parker: Well, I found one on Craigslist. And he'll be here any minute.",
        "Liberty: Here? Doesn't he have an office?",
        "Parker: You know what, if he can help me from going to boarding school, I don't care if he works out of his car!",
        "Liberty: Do you really think he can do that?",
        "Parker: Well, we're about to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Any reason for me to say hello?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Craig: Why I assumed you're still not speaking to me. So, I'm just wondering if I should waste my breath.",
        "Carly: Do you mean I've actually discovered a way to shut you up?",
        "Craig: That's all I needed to hear.",
        "Carly: Okay, Craig, wait. I guess, maybe I was a little hard on you at my house.",
        "Craig: You think? What changed your mind?",
        "Carly: Well, you did manage to bring Parker and Liberty home safely. However you managed to locate them, you do deserve credit for that.",
        "Craig: Humbly accepted.",
        "Carly: Good.",
        "Craig: But you really hurt my feelings.",
        "Carly: Well, you lied to me.",
        "Craig: Oh, call it what you want, but it was for a good cause.",
        "Carly: Which was?",
        "Craig: To score points with my beautiful business partner.",
        "Carly: Well, you did. Despite yourself.",
        "Craig: It's not good enough.",
        "Carly: Excuse me?",
        "Craig: I think you should buy me lunch.",
        "Carly: You're not serious?",
        "Craig: Oh, I can't think of a better way to repair the rift between us.",
        "Carly: I didn't realize there was a rift.",
        "Craig: All the more reason that you should take me out.",
        "Carly: Okay, well, if you want a free lunch that badly, I have another errand to do, and then I could meet you at the Lakeview?",
        "Craig: I'll be waiting.",

        "Lucy: What do you mean?",
        "Carly: Well, you wanted me to help you fix things with your father. He's going to meeting me at the Lakeview in a few minutes.",
        "Lucy: Thank you so much.",
        "Carly: Oh, all I did was set up the ambush. The rest is up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Sorry it took so long, I don't leave this kind of cash laying around.",
        "Jade: Yeah, and I don't do business on credit.",
        "Emily: Okay -- just make sure it gets done.",
        "Jade: Look, I got him to sleep with me once. I can do it again.",
        "Emily: I don't need to hear the details. Just make sure that Alison finds out about it, okay? Like the last time.",
        "Jade: I'll do my best.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. I'm sorry, that's not good enough.",
        "Jade: Well, I can't give you a guarantee.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I am sorry you felt I took advantage of Parker's disappearance. I just saw an opportunity to do something for you because I know your kids mean everything to you.",

        "Carly: Mm-hmm. I just hope you understand that I'm doing exactly the same thing for you.",
