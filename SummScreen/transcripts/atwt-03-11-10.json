        "Barbara: Mm. That cut looks sharp on you.",
        "Henry: You think so?",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm. You're gonna look fabulous behind the wheel of your new sports car when you drive it off the dealer's lot.",
        "Henry: I don't know.5 grand for a car?",
        "Barbara: Oh, you can afford it.",
        "Henry: Yeah. I know I can afford it, but shouldn't we be using the Stenbeck fortune for something more productive?",
        "Barbara: What could be more productive than living a life you've always wanted to live? And I have to tell you something. You have never looked better, except maybe a little bit earlier when you were wearing nothing at all.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on. That kind of flattery doesn't work on me! Ooh. This suit does look damn good, though, doesn't it? So extravagant, though.",
        "Barbara: You do know how much money you have, don't you?",
        "Henry: Yep. I check the bank account every single day. I just -- I wish Katie would let me give some of it to the baby.",
        "Barbara: You tried. She said no. You can't feel guilty where she's concerned.",
        "Henry: I got her husband killed.",
        "Barbara: Henry, you didn't shoot Brad, and you can't spend the rest of your life begging her to make it up to her.",
        "Henry: I know. I know you're right. I know you're right.",
        "Barbara: I mean, look at you.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: You're handsome. You're smart. You're accomplished. You're a wonderful lover. And now you're terribly, terribly, wonderfully wealthy. I mean, you have nothing to apologize for.",
        "Henry: Well, thank you. You just made me feel a whole lot better!",
        "Barbara: Good. So, why don't you return the favor, huh?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hi. Vienna, it's me, Katie. I'm sorry to bother you, but you haven't returned any of my calls. I don't know if you got all my calls in Sweden, but it's about Henry again. It's just -- the thing is he really has changed. He is mature and responsible and compassionate and loaded. Paul ended up giving him the entire Stenbeck fortune, and Henry really wants to do something good with it. He just doesn't know what that is. And I was thinking he needed some guidance from someone who loves him and trusts him and someone like, I don't know, you. So, if it's not too late and if you're ever thinking of coming back, this would be the time. Anyway, call me back either way, 'cause I really do just want to talk to you, okay? I miss you. Bye. [Baby fusses] Yes, I know. Oh, my God! Where's your eye? [Gasps] Jacob! Oh, no. Please tell me you didn't swallow it.",

        "Reid: The diffusion tensor imaging shows we've already achieved a 50% reduction in the symptoms of her epilepsy. She's doing far better than the patients that Renault and Lee operated on in Belgium.",
        "Bob: I'm amazed.",
        "Reid: Yeah. She's doing very well.",
        "Bob: I'm amazed you didn't kill her.",
        "Reid: I told you, I'm the best.",
        "Bob: I know, over and over again. You know, most neurosurgeons wouldn't attempt this procedure the first time on their own.",
        "Reid: Well, most neurosurgeons ought to be sliced into salami someplace.",
        "Bob: You know, I'm trying to give you a compliment and I can't compete with your ego.",
        "Reid: You admit you're impressed.",
        "Bob: I have to admit that you've enhanced the prestige of this hospital by doing that procedure here.",
        "Reid: Well, I'm counting on you to milk it for all it's worth.",
        "Bob: You know, we could become one of the leading facilities in this kind of surgery if you would --",
        "Reid: Stop right there. It's -- it's not gonna happen. I need to go check with the cops and see if they're actually gonna let me out on this flight. I'll stop back and say goodbye.",
        "Kim: Well, where's the genius off to?",
        "Bob: Texas.",
        "Kim: Texas? Hey, he's actually gonna leave.",
        "Bob: Once the cops give him the okay.",
        "Kim: He's been a nonstop headache since he got here.",
        "Bob: Yes, he has. And for some reason which I can't explain, I actually might miss him.",

        "Luke: Look, I've already told you, I don't want to see my father before he's transferred to prison.",
        "Cop: He knows. He keeps asking after you anyway.",
        "Luke: Well, j-- just tell him to have a good life.",
        "Cop: I doubt that's going to happen.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Reid: Hey, Richie Rich, what are you doing here? You fixing a ticket, bribing a judge?",
        "Luke: My father is going to prison.",
        "Reid: Good dad or bad dad?",
        "Luke: Do you ever get tired of the sound of your own voice? Because quite frankly, I'm sick of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You just keep breathing, Jacob, okay? We're gonna go straight to the hospital. Reid will be there, and he'll help us.",
        "[Engine sputters]",
        "Katie: Damn it! Oh, please tell me I didn't leave these lights on all night. Come on! Aah! Okay. Um, take a deep breath. Calm down. I'm gonna go see if someone can help us.",

        "Katie: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Chris: You're sure? You're all right?",
        "Katie: No, really. I think I'm good. What are you doing here? I didn't hear you were back.",
        "Chris: Just got off the plane.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sorry I stepped in front of your car like that. I was just trying to get some help. I got to get my son to the hospital.",
        "Chris: I heard you were a mom.",
        "Katie: Yeah. This is my little boy, Jacob.",
        "Chris: Oh, hey, Buddy.",
        "Katie: Could you give us a ride? My car's dead and I need to get him to the hospital.",
        "Chris: Yeah. He's got a checkup?",
        "Katie: No, no. I think he swallowed a button, you know. The eye of his little teddy bear.",
        "Chris: You think he swallowed it? You're not so sure?",
        "Katie: No. The bear was still in the crib, but the button was missing.",
        "Chris: Have you noticed any signs of choking, any difficulty of breathing or anything?",
        "Katie: No, thank God. I just got so scared.",
        "Chris: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure you did. Do you mind if I take a look at him?",
        "Katie: No. That would be great.",
        "Chris: Okay. I'll get my bag from the car and we'll look at him inside.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",

        "Kim: Okay, okay. I know Reid is a good doctor.",
        "Bob: In his field, he's the best I've ever seen.",
        "Kim: Well, he's also an arrogant egomaniac, and he's a constant source or aggravation.",
        "Bob: I know, I know, but, you know, there's something about him. It's made me change how I feel about my job.",
        "Kim: Well, I believe that. He makes it seem like there's more work, because there is. You have to work twice as hard to handle him on top of everything else.",
        "Bob: But he may make it possible that I could work less.",
        "Kim: [Laughs] How's that?",
        "Bob: Well, you know, I've been wanting to train somebody that I could take less of the responsibility around here, and I thought for years it was gonna be Christopher.",
        "Kim: No, no, no. You're thinking of Dr. Oliver? Honey, no.",
        "Bob: He's a great surgeon.",
        "Kim: He has no people skills. You have to have people skills to run a hospital.",
        "Bob: That can be taught.",
        "Kim: But you have to be willing. He will never be willing. I won't miss him a bit.",
        "Bob: Well, maybe I won't miss him, but this hospital will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I know that you don't care, but Damian is my father, and I'll probably never see him again.",
        "Reid: Lucky you have a spare.",
        "Luke: God, you're such -- do you ever think about the effect that you have on people?",
        "Reid: What? You mean, like, saving their lives?",
        "Luke: I know that you are the most amazing surgeon that has ever walked the face of this earth, but as a human being, I think you're way down there, like at rock bottom.",
        "Reid: Hey, I didn't have to come down here and keep good dad from being shipped off to Malta to face murder charges.",
        "Luke: No, you didn't, and I am grateful.",
        "Reid: Oh, it shows.",
        "Luke: It's just, do you have to hurt as many people as you help?",
        "Reid: Who am I hurting?",
        "Luke: Me, for instance. Dragging Noah off to Texas.",
        "Reid: You want Noah to get his sight back, right?",
        "Luke: Of course I do!",
        "Reid: Really? 'Cause it sounds to me like it's more important to you to keep him around here so he can hold your hand during your little family crisis.",
        "Luke: It's not!",
        "Reid: Then act like it. Stop acting like a spoiled little brat who's not getting his way, and when you kiss him goodbye, make sure it's with a smile.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What about this?",
        "Barbara: You're kidding.",
        "Henry: No. I want to get this for you.",
        "Barbara: It's a little much.",
        "Henry: I thought we were trying to blow through Stenbeck's fortune.",
        "Barbara: No, no. I'm not talking about the price tag. No. It's just the dress. I mean, its fine. It would be fine if I were 20.",
        "Henry: Barbara, you are far sexier than any 20-year-old.",
        "Barbara: Do you know that when you lie your right cheek twitches?",
        "Henry: It does?",
        "Barbara: No, but I can still tell.",
        "Henry: Come on. You would look stunning in this.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'm flattered that you think so, but no. I think it would look great on you.",
        "Henry: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Barbara: Yes, yes. Oh, was that just a phase? I mean, you were the best- dressed woman in town for some time.",
        "Henry: I hope you're not questioning my manhood.",
        "Barbara: That's one thing about you that I will never question, Henry Coleman.",
        "Henry: It is always good to hear that from the hottest woman in town.",
        "Barbara: Kim!",
        "Kim: I hope I'm not interrupting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Yeah. There you go, little buddy. Well, I'll tell you, he's breathing fine. His windpipe is clear. I think if the little man swallowed it, he's gonna pass it through.",
        "Katie: Are you sure we don't need an x-ray or scan or something?",
        "Chris: You know what? I have a better idea. Excuse me. I think maybe I can sew this button back on that teddy bear for you.",
        "Katie: You found it! Oh, he didn't swallow it!",
        "Chris: It is my medical opinion that, no, he did not swallow it.",
        "Katie: Oh, you must think I'm an idiot.",
        "Chris: No, no, no, no, no. I just think you're a new mom and a good one.",
        "Katie: I don't know about that.",
        "Chris: I know it's got to be tough, you doing this on your own.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. You heard about Brad.",
        "Chris: Yeah. My parents told me. I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: Thanks. They didn't tell me you were coming into town.",
        "Chris: They don't know. It was a last-minute thing. Yeah.",
        "Katie: Is everything okay?",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just thought it was time to come home.",
        "Katie: For good?",
        "Chris: Not sure yet.",
        "Katie: Well, I for one am thrilled to have you here and that you almost ran me over.",
        "Chris: Well, sorry about that.",
        "Katie: Oh, Reid! Hey! I'm so glad you're home. Dr. Chris Hughes, meet my roommate, Dr. Reid Oliver.",
        "Reid: Hughes, as in Bob Hughes?",
        "Katie: Yeah. He's Bob and Kim's son.",
        "Reid: Lucky you.",
        "Chris: You don't remember me, do you?",
        "Reid: Should I?",
        "Chris: I remember you.",
        "Reid: I get this all the time.",
        "Katie: 'Cause you're such a celebrity.",
        "Reid: Burden I have to bear. So, did we meet someplace?",
        "Chris: Yeah. We sure as hell did, and I hoped I'd never have to see your face again. What is he doing here?",
        "Katie: He's been living here for a couple months, working with your dad.",
        "Chris: My dad hired you?",
        "Reid: Yeah. Even he's alert enough to notice the best doctor that he has.",
        "Katie: Ignore him. It's just his manner.",
        "Reid: Excuse me. I'd like to know what this clown has against me.",
        "Chris: This clown? Well, this clown went to med school with you.",
        "Reid: It was a big place.",
        "Chris: Shannon Fellowship. Remember that?",
        "Reid: I sure do. I won it.",
        "Chris: No, you stole it.",
        "Reid: First of all, I was up against a woman from Stanford. Now, I'm assuming that wasn't you.",
        "Chris: Meghan Yee. She and I were both shut out because you claimed responsibility for a medical breakthrough that happened at a lab where you were just cleaning out the test tubes.",
        "Reid: Yeah. I did a little more than that.",
        "Chris: No, you cheated.",
        "Reid: The fellowship committee didn't seem to think so. Anyway, who cares?",
        "Chris: I do, and I'll let my father know what kind of medical ethics you practice.",
        "Reid: Trust me, he knows. You know, I'm gonna come back when Doogie Hughes here is gone.",
        "Chris: [Laughs sarcastically] Go to hell.",
        "Katie: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did you do it?",
        "Reid: Win the fellowship? Absolutely.",
        "Katie: No. You know what I'm talking about. Did you cheat?",
        "Reid: The guy's just a sore loser, Katie. It's not my problem that he can't compete on the higher level with me.",
        "Katie: Oh. So, these fine, wonderful people skills you have aren't something that you just learned recently.",
        "Reid: Some people have a problem with me. Not a lot I can do about it.",
        "Katie: Some people? Try everyone who knows you, except me, and I'm starting to wonder if I'm the one who's wrong.",

        "Luke: Noah.",
        "Noah: Hey.",
        "Luke: Hey. How did you get here? Did you come alone?",
        "Noah: Oh, no. My physical therapist dropped me off.",
        "Luke: What's wrong?",
        "Noah: Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Can I come in?",
        "Luke: Oh, yeah. Of course. Yes, yes. Come in. Is this okay?",
        "Noah: You know what? Let me try it on my own. I think I remember where everything is.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Noah: I heard about Damian.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty crazy. He wants to see me, but I keep saying no.",
        "Noah: Are you okay?",
        "Luke: I'm trying. I wanted answers. I got them.",
        "Noah: Well, you know, at least he's alive. You know, maybe one day you guys can work through this.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I'm not gonna hold my breath. It's really good seeing you here.",
        "Noah: Yeah. Yeah. My therapist was heading this way, so I just hitched a ride.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe one day we can get coffee after your therapy.",
        "Noah: I think it might be a while before I'm able to do that. I mean, you do know that I'm going to Dallas, right?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, I know.",
        "Noah: And I just came by to take care of a few things. Here. This is -- this is for your mother. I already sent Damian his copy.",
        "Luke: What is it?",
        "Noah: I'm nullifying the adoption.",
        "Luke: Is this because of what Damian did?",
        "Noah: Partly, but mostly it's just for me. If I'm connected to your family like this, Luke, I'll never be independent.",
        "Luke: But you don't have insurance. How are you gonna pay for the hospital and Dr. Oliver?",
        "Noah: Dr. Oliver's taking me on as a research subject. It's not gonna cost me anything to be there.",
        "Luke: Well, what about his fee?",
        "Noah: He's going to take his fee from a research grant.",
        "Luke: And housing? You're gonna have to pay for that.",
        "Noah: After the surgery, he's arranged for me to work with the hospital on this research project that they need a cameraman for to document the special study that they're doing. They're gonna pay me a stipend, and they're even gonna put me on the hospital's medical plan.",
        "Luke: Oh. Sounds like he has everything figured out.",
        "Noah: Yeah. He's been really great.",
        "Luke: Yeah. And I'm sure that every newspaper in Texas is gonna know about it before you even get there.",
        "Noah: Look, I know you think he's only in it for himself.",
        "Luke: Oh. You really think that all he wants to do is help you.",
        "Noah: Does it matter? I mean, if the guy can get me to see again, he can be the biggest jerk in the world. It won't matter to me.",
        "Luke: He already is.",
        "Noah: Right. Look, if you can just get your mom to sign those papers, please.",
        "Luke: Of course.",
        "Noah: And, uh, can you thank her for me?",
        "Luke: Sure. Noah, can I ask you a question?",
        "Noah: Yeah, anything.",
        "Luke: Who is it that you really want independence from, my mom and Damian, or me?",

        "Barbara: What could you possibly be interrupting?",
        "Henry: We just ran into each other.",
        "Kim: Really?",
        "Henry: Yeah, really. I was, uh -- I was buying a gift for Maddie, and, uh, it's her birthday coming up, and I thought I would, uh, send her something.",
        "Kim: Oh, yes. A $1,000 designer dress, wear around campus? Why not?",
        "Henry: Well, you know, actually, under that sloppy college-girl exterior beats the heart of a fashion slave.",
        "Kim: Well, she's gonna look great in it.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Actually, Kim, I'm buying this for Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Henry!",
        "Henry: As a token of my affection. I think it's gonna look really sexy on her. Don't you think?",
        "Barbara: Would you excuse us for a moment, please? What the hell are you doing?",
        "Henry: What do you mean?",
        "Barbara: You're talking to my Aunt Kim!",
        "Henry: Yeah. I'm being honest about my feelings.",
        "Barbara: She will tell my Uncle Bob, who will tell his son, Tom, and daughter- in-law, Margo, who will tell her sister and your ex-wife and friend Katie!",
        "Henry: I can't keep worrying about Katie. Isn't that what you told me?",
        "Barbara: Now you're listening to me?",
        "Henry: Yes, now. And, Barbara, I am not ashamed of -- of whatever this is.",
        "Barbara: You're not?",
        "Henry: Are you?",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Henry: Okay. Then here. And take this and buy the dress.",
        "Barbara: Where are you going?",
        "Henry: I'm gonna make sure that Katie hears it from me.",
        "Barbara: He thinks I'll look sexy in this.",

        "Henry: Shouldn't you be at the hospital torturing patients?",
        "Reid: Well, I figured if I hung out around here long enough, you'd show up and I could torture you, Hank.",
        "Henry: Eh. I like that guy less and less every day.",
        "Katie: Yes, I know. What are you doing here?",
        "Henry: I came here to tell you that it's over.",
        "Katie: What is?",
        "Henry: You and me.",
        "Reid: I never knew the two of you got started.",
        "Henry: Katie knows what I mean.",
        "Katie: No, I don't.",
        "Henry: Okay. I will spell it out for you. I'm not gonna interfere with your life anymore. If you want to make Dr. Nightmare over there your next big mistake, that is your business, not mine.",
        "Katie: Henry, he is my roommate. That's all.",
        "Henry: Bubbles, I know you better than you know your own self. You are lonely, you're vulnerable, you're sad right now. It's only a matter of time before you fall for him.",
        "Katie: Nope, you're wrong.",
        "Henry: You love being in love, usually with the wrong guy.",

        "Henry: I didn't know you were back. It's good to see you, man.",
        "Chris: Yeah, you too. You too. So, who is this wrong guy that Katie is madly in love with.",
        "Katie: He thinks it's Reid?",
        "[Chris laughs]",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no! Chris, don't laugh. That's not funny. You've not been here to see what's going on.",
        "Chris: No, no, no, no, but you are definitely right about one thing. He is the wrong guy for Katie.",
        "Henry: See.",
        "Katie: Chris doesn't like him either.",
        "Henry: No one likes him! You're the only one that likes him!",
        "Chris: Yeah, but it has nothing to do with that. Do you want to tell him?",
        "Reid: I'm the wrong guy for Katie.",
        "Henry: Really? Now, how could that be? I thought you were perfect!",
        "Reid: I am. I also happen to be gay.",
        "Henry: You're gay?",
        "Reid: That's right.",

        "Reid: Are you an idiot?",
        "Henry: I'm not gonna answer that question.",

        "Henry: You're gay?",
        "Chris: If I outed you, I'm really sorry.",
        "Reid: Sure, you are. Don't worry. You didn't.",
        "Chris: Okay. I will talk to you later.",
        "Katie: Okay. Thank you so much for making sure that Jacob was okay.",
        "Chris: Yeah, no problem.",
        "Katie: So, when will I see you again? When are you leaving?",
        "Chris: Not sure, but I will not leave without saying goodbye.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Chris: All right.",
        "Reid: Do you have a problem?",
        "Henry: No, but you do. I know you think you're allowed to do whatever you want, but when you lie to Katie, you do not get a free pass from me.",
        "Katie: Whoa. Wait. What are you talking about?",
        "Henry: How can you not see that he's been leading you on? Please, please. Tell her that you have not hidden the fact that you're gay so that you can get her to get me to use my inheritance to build your little personal surgery palace at memorial?",
        "Reid: No problem. I didn't hide the fact that I'm gay.",
        "Henry: Then why didn't she know?",

        "Henry: Because. I don't know.",

        "Katie: What is the point, Henry? That I didn't discuss the man's private life with you when you've been nasty to him since the first day you met him?",
        "Henry: I -- I have instincts about people, and I still say he's after my money.",

        "Kim: Darling, in my experience, Henry is an original. He does not fit into the category of \"Most men.\"",

        "Chris: To tell you the truth, I didn't know I was leaving until I was actually on the plane.",
        "Kim: Wow. Now, that's a really long trip. Are you hungry?",
        "Chris: No, no. No, I'm fine. I had a big breakfast on the plane. But I've heard you've had a little excitement around here, hmm?",
        "Bob: Just the usual.",
        "Chris: Oh, just the usual. So, getting taken hostage at your grandson's wedding, that's just another day for you.",
        "Bob: Oh. So, you heard about that.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I did hear, but not from you. Occasionally, I get to talk to my brother, Tom, and he had to tell me about it.",
        "Kim: Well, you know, it really wasn't your father's fault. It's just that we really didn't want to worry you.",
        "Bob: It all worked out okay.",
        "Chris: Oh, oh, oh. It all worked out. Well, that's good. I can see then there's no reason to tell me about it. I didn't get left out of the loop.",
        "Kim: Oh, listen. Let's talk about you. How long you gonna stay?",
        "Bob: You are going back to Africa, aren't you?",

        "Bob: Well, just let me know.",
        "Chris: Well, all right. Well, I do have one question for you, though. Why the hell would you hire a person like Reid Oliver?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Oh, okay. All right. I'm ready this time.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm sorry about that. I lost my temper. I shouldn't have done it. It had nothing to do with you.",
        "Reid: Good to know.",
        "Luke: Yeah. So, Noah's ready for you.",
        "Reid: Hey, listen, I know the guy did a lot of bad things and probably hurt a lot of people, but, Damian, he's still your father.",
        "Luke: That's nice of you to say.",
        "Reid: Yeah, it happens some times, as much as I try to prevent it.",
        "Luke: Well, the truth is I gave him so many chances. When he first found out I was gay, he tried to fix me. I forgave him for that.",
        "Reid: It must have been tough having your father want to change you.",
        "Luke: Well, he finally accepted me, so I gave him another chance.",
        "Reid: It makes you wonder if the first chance was real.",
        "Luke: Yeah, it does. I don't know why I'm talking to you about this.",
        "Reid: Well, like I said, sometimes I'm a good guy in spite of myself.",
        "Luke: Well, do you think you could save some of that kindness for Noah?",
        "Reid: Why? Does he need it?",
        "Luke: Are you kidding me?",
        "Reid: No.",
        "Luke: He's going away to some strange city with you. He's still trying to cope with being blind. I think he could use a support network.",
        "Reid: Yeah. You want maybe I should find him a play group?",
        "Luke: Look, Dr. Oliver, please, can you just not be a jerk for like two more minutes.",
        "Reid: Look, I'm his doctor. I'm not his babysitter.",
        "Luke: Fine. Just, can you do me one favor? If I come down to help him, will you encourage him to let me?",
        "Reid: Maybe you need to get a life, too?",
        "Luke: You don't get it. Noah is my life. He's the love of my life. And you think that I'm gonna forget about him? Well, I'm not. It's called being in love, Dr. Oliver. You should try it.",

        "Barbara: Did you see her? How'd she take it?",
        "Henry: Fine, fine.",
        "Barbara: You didn't tell her.",
        "Henry: I couldn't help it. Look, Dr. Twisted was there, okay, and I got into this big fight, this petty little fight with her, over him, and it just ruined the whole mood.",
        "Barbara: Why does that man bother you so much?",
        "Henry: Because he's a twisted, lying, manipulative phony. Did you know he's gay?",
        "Barbara: How would I know that he's gay?",
        "Henry: I didn't know that either, until I accused him of coming on to Katie. You think that's funny?",
        "Barbara: Henry, I think you're funny.",
        "Henry: Man, I've got some real problems, don't I?",
        "Barbara: Everybody has problems.",
        "Henry: No, I'm serious. I'm serious. Look, if she wants to be with some sociopathic egomaniac, then why should that matter to me?",
        "Barbara: Because that's who you are. You loved women who have the upper hand. I mean, we won't even talk about your mother, but then there's Vienna and Katie.",
        "Henry: I don't see that.",
        "Barbara: You think that Vienna is out of your league, so you try really hard to bring yourself up to her level, and with Katie, she's always with another man. You've always been her backup guy.",
        "Henry: That's a little harsh, don't you think?",
        "Barbara: You want me to lie to you?",
        "Henry: Yeah, maybe.",
        "Barbara: No, no. I'm not gonna do that, and that's why we don't have any problems. You see, I'm not too good for you, and I'm not looking for a best friend or a puppy.",
        "Henry: Now I'm a puppy?",
        "Barbara: I don't expect you to live up to certain things. I like you just the way you are. That's good enough for me.",
        "Henry: It's good enough for me, too.",

        "Kim: I see.",
        "Chris: So, let's talk about you guys. How's the heart?",
        "Kim: Oh, my darling, it's ticking in 3/4 time.",
        "Chris: Even after the scare at the wedding?",
        "Kim: I'll have you know that I was thoroughly and unnecessarily checked out.",
        "Chris: Okay. And what about you, hmm? Passing out?",
        "Bob: Oh, I was faking. I had to get your mother out of there.",
        "Kim: You did a very good job of it.",
        "Bob: I had a little help from Dr. Oliver.",
        "Chris: He was there?",
        "Kim: Yeah. Well, Katie brought him. He stays with her.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I heard. I don't know why you are working with that guy.",
        "Bob: Because he's one of the best.",
        "Chris: I think he's a phony. Remember the Shannon Fellowship, the one I didn't get at medical school?",
        "Kim: Yeah. You said it was stolen from you.",
        "Chris: Yeah, stolen by him.",
        "[Kim gasps]",
        "Bob: You went to medical school with him?",
        "Chris: Well, we were there at the same time, but I'm sure Reid thought that the classes were there for his benefit alone.",
        "Bob: Well, I'm sorry to say that his behavior hasn't improved that much, but he is one of the greatest neurosurgeons in the world.",
        "Chris: Dad. Yes, yes. I'm sure he tells you that every day.",
        "Bob: As a matter of fact, he does.",
        "Chris: Oh. I cannot believe he is on staff here.",
        "Bob: Not for long. He's going back to Dallas.",
        "Chris: Good.",
        "Kim: Actually, what about you? Your father can use some help here running the hospital.",
        "Chris: Oh, Mom. Let's not go down that road right now. I'm quite happy in practicing medicine. I'd like to keep it that way.",
        "Bob: Well, it's nice to have you around.",
        "Kim: Oh, it really is. Honey, this was such a wonderful surprise. Thank you so much. Actually, it has occurred to me that, I mean, is it a coincidence that you came home so soon after Alison broke up with Casey?",
        "Chris: Mother.",
        "Kim: Yes?",
        "Chris: Relationships, they don't work for me.",
        "Kim: Oh, you just have to find the right person.",
        "Chris: Well, I don't think there is one.",

        "Chris: Dad, please. I'm eating right now, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You know, I don't get you. You go out of your way to get Noah the treatment he needs, housing, a job, and then you pretend like you don't care what happens to him.",

        "Luke: That is bull. Well, I'm beginning to think that your whole bedside manner's just an act.",
        "Reid: Yeah. I'm really a warm, fuzzy guy. Look, if you come down to Dallas to visit him, just do me a favor. Make sure I don't run into you so I can stay focused on returning his sight.",
        "Luke: What? You mean I get in your way?",
        "Reid: I don't know. Just being you seems to do it. I need to go and see Noah.",

        "Katie: You mean that?",
        "Chris: Absolutely. I heard your live-in doctor is leaving.",
        "Katie: Yeah. It's been so great to have him there. It just puts my mind at ease to know he's right in the next room in case something bad happens.",
        "Chris: Yeah. Look, I'm sorry. When I heard about what happened to Brad, I couldn't stop thinking about what you've been going through.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. Thanks. It's, you know, good days and bad days, but I am pretty lonely sometimes, even with Reid there.",
        "Chris: I'm sure.",
        "Katie: What about you? Are you seeing anyone?",
