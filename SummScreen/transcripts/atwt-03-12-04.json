        "Jessica: It's so cold tonight. What if she's out there somewhere? What if she's afraid -- to go indoors because she thinks she'll be spotted?",
        "Ben: Jess, we're going to find her. Maybe not tonight, but soon.",
        "Jessica: You know what happens to young girls on the street, Ben? They look for comfort. And they find it in all the wrong places.",
        "Margo: All right, she's not here. But listen, if she has somehow managed to leave town, we've got every uniform in the department out looking for her. And, it's just -- it's just a matter of time -- hey, any luck?",
        "Curtis: I talked to everyone who knows her at Oakdale Latin and supposedly, they haven't seen her, but they could be covering for her, you know?",
        "Ben: Yeah, that's what we thought.",
        "Curtis: Casey should talk to them. He knows those kids better than I do.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm pretty sure that Casey's doing some covering of his own.",
        "Curtis: What do you mean?",
        "Margo: I asked him outright if he had seen Sarah since school let out yesterday. And he said no, but then they were spotted together at Al's diner -- so he had to 'fess up that he was lying.",
        "Curtis: He saw Sarah before she left? And she didn't say where she was going?",
        "Margo: That's what he said. What do you think, Curtis?",
        "Curtis: Casey's a stand-up guy. But if Sarah made him promise not to tell --",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: This would look just great on you.",
        "Casey: Okay. As soon as I start talking to my grandmother, you sneak and find a place to hide.",
        "Sarah: You sure this is gonna work?",
        "Casey: You can spend the night in the store. I mean, no one's gonna even think to look for you in here.",
        "Sarah: It's going to be so creepy after the mall closes.",
        "Casey: Nothing's gonna happen to you. You'll be totally safe. But, Sarah, don't let anyone see you. Or the two of us are cooked.",

        "Luke: I win! I am the winner!",
        "Lily: Oh, that is the fourth time you've won \"Home Made Simple.\" You're cheating!",
        "Luke: No way, Mom. I won fair and square.",
        "Lily: I don't believe you.",
        "Luke: Go, Luke -- go Luke!",
        "Lily: If you have that attitude, I'm going to tickle you! I'm gonna tickle you! Are you gonna let me win next time -- aren't you? You're gonna let me win!",
        "Holden: Faith is gonna be sorry she missed this.",
        "Lily: Gotta get ready. Go back to Grandmas.",
        "Luke: Oh, do we have to?",
        "Lily: Yes, you do -- I'm sorry. Come on, hurry up. It's okay. She'll -- bake you muffins or something.",
        "Holden: Sorry to have to interrupt the fun and games. But Dr. Michaels is going to be here any minute.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I know. You don't have to remind me. I'm not going to run out the back door, Holden.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Holden: That's probably her. I'll get it.",

        "Paul: This isn't bad, huh? I think we did all right.",
        "Carly: Looks clean. No stale smoke, that's a plus.",
        "Lucy: The mattress is all right. For one night, at least.",
        "Paul: All right, so we'll weather the storm out here. We'll head back to Oakdale in the morning.",
        "Carly: Oh, sounds good. I haven't been able to reach Jack though. I'm going to try him again, let him know what's going on.",
        "Paul: Well, you want Lucy and I to give you some privacy, we can go down to the gift shop. You need anything?",
        "Carly: A toothbrush would be good.",
        "Paul: All right. You ready?",
        "Lucy: Sure, but, could we take a walk out back -- after we get everything? There's a stream that's frozen. And the moonlight is hitting the snow -- it's really beautiful. Please?",
        "Paul: Sure. If we're not back in 15 minutes, send out the sled dogs.",
        "Carly: It's a deal. Oh, Jack. You're not going to like this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Jack, this is my wife. This is Carly's sister. I will pay whatever it takes. But you have to do whatever it takes. You have to find Rosanna.",
        "Jack: Rosanna disappeared from St. Bart's in the Caribbean. It's out of my jurisdiction, Craig.",
        "Craig: But you're a cop! You have connections. Don't cops belong to the cop brotherhood?",
        "Jack: I'll make some calls. See what kind of support I can drum up. But I'm gonna have to lay back on this. Even you have to understand that --",
        "Craig: Lay back? Lay back? What is Carly going to say when she finds out her sister may have been kidnapped -- and you're laying back? How's that going to sit with her? Do you want me to make that call, Jack?",
        "Jack: Tell Carly and I'll snap your neck. You understand? Carly does not find out about this.",
        "Craig: What am I supposed to do? Go home and go to bed?",
        "Jack: Go home, definitely. And if you can't sleep, have one of your servants make you some chamomile tea or something.",
        "Craig: The cook is off tonight. And Phyllis doesn't even know how to boil water. She's probably sitting in my favorite chair right now, with her feet up, watching TV.",

        "[Muffled]",
        "Phyllis: Help -- help!",

        "Casey: Okay, we gotta do this quick. As soon as I start talking, you go and hide.",
        "Sarah: But, what happens in the morning?",
        "Casey: I'll come by to help you sneak out.",
        "Sarah: Wait, but --",
        "Casey: Gram! How're you doing?",
        "Lisa: Oh! Oh, what are you doing here?",
        "Casey: Um, I was just checking out the music store, thought I'd say hello. I felt kinda bad that we didn't get to talk, back at the house.",
        "Lisa: Aren't you just the sweetest thing? And you're handsome, too. Well, that's the word round town, anyway.",
        "Casey: Yeah, right. Um, you ready to close up? I can walk you to your car.",
        "Lisa: That is the best offer I've had in -- I can't remember when. Let me just put some things away. I'll be right out.",
        "Casey: Sarah? Are you all right?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Casey: You do this tonight, and we'll think of something better for tomorrow. Okay?",
        "Sarah: Great. Thank you.",
        "Lisa: Hey, now. That didn't take too long, did it? Shall we go?",
        "Casey: Let's hit it.",

        "Dusty: Is Lily here?",
        "Holden: Yeah, she's here, but she can't see you right now. So, uh, why don't you come back some other time.",
        "Dusty: Hey, hey -- what's going on?",
        "Holden: She has an appointment any minute.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, with her shrink. I know about that.",
        "Holden: How do you know about that?",
        "Lily: I called him. After what happened, I thought he should know what's going on.",
        "Dusty: I just wanted to say good luck to you.",
        "Lily: Thanks. Come on in.",
        "Dusty: I also wanted to tell you not to worry about the foundation. I put things on hold because I don't want to do anything without you. So, whenever you're ready, I'll be waiting, okay?",
        "Lily: Thanks. That's very considerate of you.",
        "Holden: Except for one thing. Lily's doctor might not want her to get involved with the foundation.",
        "Dusty: Well, don't you think that -- it would be good for her to be working on something she really cares about?",
        "Holden: That's not for you to decide.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Lily: I'll get it. It's probably Dr. Michaels. Excuse me.",
        "Lily: Oh. You are the last person that I want to see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Jack, I'm not going anywhere till you tell me why you're keeping this from Carly. Because, believe me, secrets do not strengthen the marital bond.",
        "Jack: I don't know for a fact that anything happened to Rosanna, Craig. And until I do, I don't want Carly to worry.",
        "Cop #1: Detective Snyder? Line two.",
        "Jack: Take a message, please.",
        "Cop #1: It's your wife. She said she's snowed in. Can't make it home.",
        "Craig: Carly's out of town?",
        "Jack: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Carly: It's snowing like crazy here, jack. They closed the airport.",
        "Jack: So I hear. What are you gonna do?",
        "Carly: We got a couple rooms at the local hotel here. I'm sharing with Lucy. First thing in the morning, we'll try to get out.",
        "Jack: Okay -- guess I'll call the sitter, see if she can stay late.",
        "Carly: I already did that.",
        "Jack: Well, thanks. No way you can rent a car? Get to another airport?",
        "Carly: No, jack, the roads are terrible. And besides, if we did that, Paul's plane would still be here.",
        "Jack: I'm not talking about him.",
        "Carly: C'mon, jack. Its one night.",
        "Jack: I know that, Carly, but --",
        "Carly: I love you.",
        "Jack: I love you, too. I'll see ya tomorrow.",
        "Craig: Everything all right? You didn't look pleased.",
        "Jack: Carly's out of town, got caught in a blizzard. She won't be home till tomorrow.",
        "Craig: Why is she out of town, Jack?",
        "Jack: It's none of your business! Don't ask me again.",
        "Craig: Hey, snow's not my fault, Jack.",
        "Jack: Lopez? Would you escort Mr. Montgomery to his car?",
        "Craig: Never mind, Lopez. I can find it on my own. Just, um -- call me if you hear anything about Rosanna, all right?",
        "Jack: I'll call, okay? I'll call.",
        "Craig: I'm worried she's going to get hurt, Jack. Put me out of my misery. Good night.",
        "Jack: Lopez, do me a favor. Get me the name and number of every police chief in the Caribbean?",
        "Lopez: You got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay, Lucy bought out the whole gift shop. They're closed for the rest of the week.",
        "Lucy: Hey, I had to find something to sleep in, didn't I? Just some magazines, shampoo, conditioner.",
        "Paul: I'm sure they have shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom.",
        "Lucy: Not the kind I like. And without the right conditioner, my hair would be a disaster and you would take one look at me and run away.",
        "Paul: Okay, I think she's trying to tell me that there are some things I just don't understand.",
        "Carly: I'm not sure what she's trying to tell you.",
        "Paul: I'll see you two later.",
        "Lucy: Where are you going?",
        "Paul: I'm going to go call the airport, make sure that the runway's going to be cleared for tomorrow morning. See ya.",
        "Lucy: He's a great guy, isn't he?",
        "Carly: He does have his moments. Did you get that toothbrush?",
        "Lucy: Oh, yes, here. Take your pick.",
        "Carly: Uh, this one looks good. Thank you. I'll be in the shower.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I just came by to see how you're doing. I certainly never meant to disturb you.",
        "Lily: Oh, if you were so concerned about me, why did you run off with my children?",
        "Holden: That's not what she did.",
        "Lily: She had them in her suite, where I couldn't find them.",
        "Holden: That was my idea. Molly only did what I asked.",
        "Lily: She could've said no. A normal person would've done that.",
        "Molly: \"Normal.\" All I did, Lily, was --",
        "Lily: I want you to go, right now. I want you to leave.",
        "Holden: Hey, hey, Lilly, stop, stop.",
        "Dusty: It's okay. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. You know, you have every right to be angry, but it's not worth it. Let's not make things worse, all right?",
        "Holden: You all right?",
        "Molly: Yeah. You're wife's not.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, we're working on that. Thanks for coming by. I know it was for the right reasons.",
        "Molly: Holden --",
        "Holden: Look, I'll call you later, okay? You wanna tell me what that was all about?",
        "Dr. Michaels: May I come in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: What do they do, turn off the heat? Not bad. And tonight, I have one in every color.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Curtis: You know, Sarah's got no money, no car. Not only that, Sarah doesn't even know her way around Oakdale that well. So wherever she is, she must've had help.",
        "Casey: What'd I do?",
        "Margo: I don't know, Casey. Why don't you tell us.",
        "Lisa: Hi, everybody. Look, I just dropped in to -- hey, what's wrong? What's happened?",
        "Jessica: Sarah's missing, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: Again?",
        "Margo: And I was just asking Casey if he knew anything about it.",
        "Casey: Which I already told you, I don't.",
        "Lisa: Margo, please, take it easy on the kid. He was with me. We were --",
        "Margo: Doing what?",
        "Lisa: He came over to the mall, and he was looking through some CDs. Then he dropped into the shop. And then he walked me to the car, and we sat there and we talked for the longest time.",
        "Curtis: You know what? I gotta go. I just remembered I have to give some notes to a kid in my class.",
        "Ben: Don't you have homework?",
        "Curtis: I did it. I gotta run, though.",
        "Margo: All right, so Sarah's picture is in the system. If she did somehow manage to get out of town, the highway patrol is gonna pick her up.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lisa: Whoops, that's me. Excuse me. Hello?",
        "Curtis: Mrs. Grimaldi, it's me, Curtis. Please don't tell anyone I'm calling.",
        "Lisa: Oh, okay, sure. What can I do for you?",
        "Curtis: I think I know where Sarah's hiding. And I need your help to keep her safe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, Jack, it's Paul. Did you find anything out about Rosanna?",
        "Jack: Carly with you?",
        "Paul: Yeah, she's in the other room.",
        "Jack: Rosanna was spotted leaving St. Bart's. The man she was traveling with has a rap sheet as long as the golden gate bridge.",
        "Paul: Are you worried about her?",
        "Jack: Still hard to say. I'm contacting law enforcement through the Caribbean. If someone comes across her passport, I'll be sure to get word.",
        "Paul: Jack, I'm really sorry about all this. Obviously, I had no idea that the weather was gonna be like this.",
        "Jack: Next time you wanna do business with my wife, take her to lunch.",
        "Paul: All right, I'll keep that in mind.",
        "Jack: Do that.",

        "Paul: Come on in, Lucy. Very collegiate.",
        "Lucy: Thanks. What're you doing?",
        "Paul: I was making some phone calls. I made so many calls, I think my neck is stuck to the shoulder.",
        "Lucy: Well, you should let me try. I used to work on my brother all the time. He said it was better than a week's vacation.",
        "Paul: You know what? I'll be fine. I'll just -- I'll take a hot shower later.",
        "Lucy: Well, if you don't like it, I promise I'll stop.",
        "Paul: Lucy, its fine. It's no big deal. It's -- that's nice. Hey. Your brother was right, you are very good at this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sarah: Why hello, darling! I had no idea you'd be at this premiere. So, tell me. How is life in Tinseltown?",
        "Guard: Okay. Whoever's in there, come on out. This is security.",
        "Lisa: Looks like we have caught ourselves a little burglar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hi. Thanks for coming.",
        "Molly: I'm glad you called.",
        "Holden: Are you okay?",
        "Molly: Are you?",
        "Holden: I feel terrible about what happened with my wife. Five minutes before you got there she was on the floor. She was playing with the kids.",
        "Molly: So, that was Lily in a good mood?",
        "Holden: It's tough. I just don't know what's gonna happen with her from one moment to the next. One minute she's smiling. The next, it's all doom and gloom.",
        "Molly: It's gotta be tough.",
        "Holden: Lily's at war with herself. One side of her wants to accept Rose's death. The other --",
        "Molly: No, no. I meant tough for you.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, it's been a nightmare. One day everything seems like its getting better, and then it just gets worse. Anyway, um -- I wanted to let you know that I'm sorry for getting you involved in all of this.",
        "Molly: Well, like Lily said, it's my decision. And I have absolutely no regrets. And I wanted to help you. And if you ever need anything, all you have to do is ask.",
        "Lily: You know, the times I feel the most like Lucinda Walsh's daughter are when I'm threatened or given an ultimatum in some way. This is exactly what Holden did to me. He threatened to take my children away from me unless I got therapy.",
        "Dr. Michaels: So, you feel like your ability to make a free choice is being taken away.",
        "Lily: Oh, yes. Yes.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Well, let's take Holden out of the equation for a minute. It's just you and me and I would like you to answer me honestly. Do you think therapy could help you?",
        "Lily: It might.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Next question. Do you want to be helped?",
        "Lily: I want to go back to the way I was -- before Rose died. A good mother -- a good wife -- I miss that. I miss that with all my heart.",
        "Dr. Michaels: What's stopping you from being that person now?",
        "Lily: It's like -- I have a compulsion to keep Rose alive. It's not there all the time but when it is, it's like there's no room for anything else.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Well, there's nothing wrong with missing your sister, Lily. On the contrary, it's natural, it's honorable. And it's something you should never feel you have to apologize for.",
        "Lily: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for saying it's an honorable thing. Thank you.",
        "Dr. Michaels: We're talking about a matter of proportion. About whether and at this point in your life, you feel that you can to do both things. Can you keep your sister's memory alive and take care of your family?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Dr. Michaels: Well, let's say you had to make a choice. Right now. Which would be more important to you?",

        "Lucinda: Now don't you forget. You call Simone in the morning, get those numbers.",
        "Craig: Ahh.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Oh, Craig, watch where you're going -- for heaven's sake.",
        "Craig: I've been waiting for you.",
        "Lucinda: Yes. Why? Want to borrow money?",
        "Craig: How was your meeting?",
        "Lucinda: Well, why don't you just tell me, because I'm sure that you were eavesdropping?",
        "Craig: Far be it from me to waste any time sniffing around your meetings, Lucinda. I've lost interest in your machinations, been uninterested for years -- so, sleep peacefully. Your pet peeves are safe from these prying eyes.",
        "Lucinda: Why are you lurking?",
        "Craig: Where's Lucy? I've been calling her all morning. She doesn't pick up. She hasn't return my calls.",

        "Craig: Well, then -- then please don't.",
        "Lucinda: But I have to tell you. And you brought it on yourself. That poor child -- you've eroded any faith she ever had in you. And it just amazes that it didn't happen sooner.",
        "Craig: Thank you once more for your endless unsolicited insight. Now, where is Lucy?",
        "Lucinda: She's out of town. And her phone is probably turned off.",
        "Craig: And I don't suppose you would stoop to tell her father where she went?",
        "Lucinda: She went to the interview.",
        "Craig: The one at Williams?",
        "Lucinda: Yes -- yes.",
        "Craig: Oh, good -- good. Well, I found the paperwork. I was hoping she hadn't forgotten.",
        "Lucinda: Well, she hadn't --",
        "Craig: Of course, I was also hoping to take her there myself.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, hoping. Well, hope springs eternal, I don't know why.",
        "Craig: It's who I am. I'm also the one who encouraged her to apply for that fellowship. Did you know that?",
        "Lucinda: You mean you actually took some interest in your daughter's education? Hark, hark! I hear the truck arriving with the \"father of the year award.\" Even as we speak.",
        "Craig: Did you read her essay for the application? Hmm?",
        "Lucinda: No, I didn't. It blew me away. It blew me away -- how someone her age has a grasp of politics, international affairs. She's going to be secretary general of the U.N. Before she's 30. Anyway, I did want to be there to see Dean whoever after he met my baby in person. Bet she blew their socks off, huh?",
        "Lucinda: I bet she did, too. Although all she said to me was that she hadn't messed up too badly.",
        "Craig: Did you talk to her?",
        "Lucinda: Well, of course I did! She gave me a full report on everything. She loves the town. She loves the snow and the snowflakes -- and everything's totally awesome.",

        "Lucinda: Oh, Craig, enough of this interrogation. I -- I",

        "Jessica: So, you're not going to say you're sorry?",
        "Sarah: I'm sorry.",
