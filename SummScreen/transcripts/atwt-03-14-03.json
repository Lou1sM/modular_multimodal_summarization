        "Rose: Wow, this is incredible.",
        "Paul: Yes, and it's also very early. Now, you said Natalie would have everybody up at the crack of dawn, but nobody looks like they're awake.",
        "Rose: Well, it's too late now! Can't turn back. Go. Come on!",
        "Paul: All right, now, you are positive you wanna go through with this? Because, as soon as everybody knows that we're engaged again, the ball starts rolling.",
        "Rose: Roll the ball. Spread the news. Everything. Let's just go.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rose: Okay.",
        "Paul: Here we go.",

        "Lily: Oh. Rose, Paul, hi! How ya doing? Come on in. Luke and Faith! If you're not down here for breakfast in two minutes, you're never watching television again. I'm sorry. Where's my brain? I'll be back in one minute. Go on inside.",
        "Rose: See? I told you. They're up.",

        "[Bonnie sighs]",
        "Isaac: Hey. I thought I was taking early duty today.",
        "Bonnie: I just figured I'd get a head start on inventory. Couldn't sleep much, thinking about my mom.",
        "Isaac: Hey, if you wanna go be with her -- hey -- go be with her. The inventory can wait.",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. I just -- I kind of feel I should just --",
        "Ben: Isaac, Bonnie. You haven't talked to Jessica, have you? 'Cause I haven't. I've been trying to reach her all night.",
        "Isaac: Have you tried going by her house?",
        "Ben: She's not there. Okay, I'm worried.",
        "Bonnie: Ben, she's fine. My mom stayed with Margo last night. She left me a voicemail on my cell.",
        "Ben: Oh. Did -- how'd she sound?",
        "Bonnie: You know my mom. She doesn't fall apart easily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Listen, thanks for seeing me home, guys. You don't have to stick around.",
        "Cop #1: No problem, Ms. Griffin. It's our job.",
        "Jessica: Translation -- Margo insisted. I heard you tell her you'd been on duty all night.",
        "Cop #1: Honestly, it's no problem.",
        "Cop #2: Would you like us to do a walk-through?",
        "Jessica: No. No, that won't be necessary. Why don't you two just go home and get some sleep?",
        "Cop #1: Not yet. We'll be out front in the cruiser.",
        "Jessica: Thanks, gentlemen.",
        "Marshall: Hello, Jessica.",
        "[Jessica gasps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: The temperature dropped last night. I didn't want you to catch a chill. Why didn't you come to bed?",
        "Craig: Why? Would I have been welcome? Thank you for the -- coffee and the blanket.",
        "Rosanna: You know why I do the little things, don't you?",
        "Craig: Because you're a warm, generous, thoughtful human being?",
        "Rosanna: Because I care about you. 'Cause I love you.",
        "Craig: Yes, well, I love you, too.",
        "Rosanna: I hope so.",
        "Craig: Now -- are you doubting that I love you because I spent a night on the sofa?",
        "Rosanna: You know, we were planning on getting married this winter. You realize it's the first of spring, almost?",
        "Craig: Yes, well, we have had a few distractions since we made those plans, you know?",
        "Rosanna: I've noticed. I don't want to fight.",
        "Craig: Oh, really? You almost bit my head off when I came to you about Carly's advance.",
        "Rosanna: This isn't about Carly.",
        "Craig: It isn't?",
        "Rosanna: No. She came by last night. I gave her the -- loan.",
        "Craig: Well, great! Now we can get back to normal here.",
        "Rosanna: That's just it. It's never normal. There's always something. If it's not Carly, it's Lucy and Aaron, or it's Sierra, or it's Monte Carlo --",
        "Craig: Rosanna, we're grown-up people, Rosanna, with grown-up lives here.",
        "Rosanna: I understand that situations arise. I understand that. But wouldn't it be nice for it to be about you and me every once in awhile? I think it would be nice if you could just focus on me for a change.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Morning. How'd you sleep?",
        "Carly: Oh, God. Jack, the baby!",
        "Jack: No, the baby's fine. The baby's fine. You're fine. No, don't worry about a thing. Hey. It's good you got some sleep.",
        "Carly: Are we still in the emergency room?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, but just for a little while. We're waiting for a room to open up.",
        "Carly: Well, if they want me to stay, then obviously something's wrong, Jack.",
        "John: Morning, Carly. Morning, Jack.",
        "Jack: Morning.",
        "John: Carly, we'd like to keep you here for a couple of days for observation. When Dr. Schiller comes on duty, she wants to talk to you.",
        "Carly: About what?",
        "John: Nothing to worry about. I'm gonna page her.",
        "Jack: You're gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine.",
        "Mike: Hey, roomie. You up for some company?",
        "Carly: I'm pretty thirsty, Jack. Would you mind getting me something to drink?",
        "Jack: Why do I get the feeling you're trying to get rid of me?",
        "Carly: Just give us a few minutes.",
        "Jack: I'll be right back.",
        "Mike: How you doing?",
        "Carly: I was hoping you could tell me. Everybody's being so cryptic. And nobody'll answer any of my questions. So I need for you to be honest with me. We've been through this before, Mike. Am I gonna lose this baby, too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Haven't I proven to you, time and time again, how much you mean to me? What is it gonna take for you to believe in this, in us?",
        "Rosanna: All I'm asking for is a little of what's left after you finishing worrying about Lucy and stop being involved in Carly's latest drama du jour.",
        "Craig: So what you're saying is you've been missing me?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I miss you.",
        "Craig: Why don't you send me a card?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, ha, ha. That's very funny. Don't trivialize me!",
        "Craig: You're being ridiculous here.",
        "Rosanna: Don't trivialize me. I am not being ridiculous.",
        "Craig: Yes, you are. I think about you all the time.",
        "Rosanna: Stop.",
        "Craig: Yes, I do.",
        "Rosanna: Then why do I feel like -- you know, when I was in the hospital, you told me that you could get used to being needed. Now I don't feel like you have any time to be needed anymore.",
        "Craig: What do you need?",
        "Rosanna: I need to feel like this relationship is a priority with you.",
        "Craig: It is!",
        "Rosanna: It's not.",
        "Craig: It is. Maybe a little action would help. What do you think?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. That's a good idea. We should plan the wedding, and we could talk to the caterer --",
        "Craig: Why not? We can sample finger sandwiches and bisque. What else?",
        "Rosanna: Let Carly solve her own problems for awhile.",
        "Craig: Well -- now that you've given her a down payment on a house, she has fewer problems.",
        "Rosanna: I didn't just fork over thousands of dollars, sweetheart. I -- there were stipulations.",
        "Craig: Such as?",
        "Rosanna: Such as she has to turn in all her designs by mid-April.",
        "Craig: Well, good. Dreamers need incentive.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. And no matter what her personal crisis, she's to keep it out of Monte Carlo and away from you.",
        "Craig: Well, fine. What does that mean?",
        "Rosanna: It means that, whatever is going on in her life, she's not to cry on your shoulder. You're not to provide her solace or give her a hand to hold. No matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: So far, the baby is okay. All right, but for her sake, you have to be calm. All right? Do you think you could do that?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Everything is such a mess, Mike. I've hurt people I care about. People who matter. And I was hoping -- what if I've hurt the most precious thing in my life?",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Molly: Hey. How's Carly? Mike left me a voicemail message last night, but I didn't get it until this morning. Is she okay?",
        "Jack: Wow, Mol. You almost sound like you really care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Maybe you can call her cell again now. She was probably trying to get some rest when you called before.",
        "Ben: Yeah. She -- you know, I'm gonna swing by Margo's. You wanna go with me?",
        "Bonnie: No. No, I've got some inventory. And -- but I'll check with her later.",
        "Ben: Okay. Um -- all right, you two take care.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, you, too.",
        "[Bonnie sighs]",
        "Isaac: No, you don't.",
        "Bonnie: What do you mean, no? I came in just to do this.",
        "Isaac: The inventory can wait. Why don't you go with Ben? Don't you want to go see your mom?",
        "Bonnie: I don't want to crowd her. She has so much to think about right now.",
        "Isaac: Well, you can say that again.",
        "Bonnie: What's that supposed to mean?",
        "Isaac: It's just -- I don't see what Jessica's gonna gain by pressing this. I mean, hasn't she put you and Ben through enough?",
        "Bonnie: How can she let it go, Isaac. She was raped. Isaac? You don't believe her. Do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: Jessica, please -- don't run from me! I am not going to hurt you.",
        "Jessica: Stay away from me!",
        "Marshall: Do you really think I came here to harm you?",
        "Jessica: How did you get in here?",
        "Marshall: You gave me a key, remember? When I locked myself out.",
        "Jessica: I meant to change the locks.",
        "Marshall: I guess you didn't think I'd be walking around free.",
        "Jessica: Oh, don't get used to it. There's a warrant out for your arrest.",
        "Marshall: So I've gathered. Look, Jessica, why -- why are you doing this?",
        "Jessica: How can you say that?",
        "Marshall: Jessica, please. Didn't Bonnie give you my letter?",
        "Jessica: And you stay away from my daughter!",
        "Marshall: Look, I only gave her the letter so that I could remind you about what's real. Like the fact that I care too much about you to even think about harming you. Jessica, you need to see things through my eyes or you'll never understand my side of things.",
        "Jessica: Everything is in my statement to the police. I don't need your interpretation.",
        "Marshall: You do if you're gonna continue to call what happened between us \"rape.\"",
        "Jessica: Well, why don't we just let the police sort it out?",
        "Marshall: No. No, no cops! No cops. Not until you and I sort things out first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: So, you guys are up awfully early. Or was it just a late night?",
        "Paul: It was an interesting night. Let's just put it that way.",
        "Lily: So you just happened to be in the neighborhood?",
        "Rose: No, not really. We --",
        "Luke: Is Aaron taking us to school this morning?",
        "Aaron: Of course, buddy.",
        "Lily: Yeah, come on. Your lunches are right here.",
        "Aaron: You got your books?",
        "Lily: Everything. Come on, grab it. Don't wanna be late. Hurry up. Go, go, go.",
        "Holden: Bye, guys. Bye, guys.",
        "Luke: Bye.",
        "Holden: Welcome to a Snyder morning.",
        "Paul: I guess we could have picked a better time.",
        "Lily: A better time for what?",
        "Rose: See? Now we got 'em curious.",
        "Lily: You're engaged! Oh! I knew it! Oh, that's great. Congratulations.",
        "Paul: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Holden: Congratulations. You, two. [Doorbell rings] I'll get it. Be right back.",
        "Dusty: Hey.",
        "Holden: Hey, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Hope this isn't a bad time. I -- I brought something by for your newest.",
        "Holden: Natalie's with Lily. Come on in.",
        "Lily: I had this intense feeling about you this morning.",
        "Dusty: This is a bad time. I'll come back later.",
        "Lily: Oh, hi. No, no, no. No, stay. No, no. We're just about to celebrate. Rose and Paul are getting married!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, bub, you drive a hard bargain. But then again, so do I. Did Carly accept those terms?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, indeed. She was quite desperate for the money.",
        "[Craig chuckles]",
        "Rosanna: Look, I gave you time to kick the Carly habit, and you couldn't seem to do it on your own. So just consider this romantic methadone.",
        "Craig: I don't want Carly romantically. I don't want her to come between us. And the only reason I relayed her request for money was because of Monte Carlo.",
        "Rosanna: You coddle her.",
        "Craig: She is our designer. And our designer will work a lot harder if she's not miserable. All right? But -- maybe you are right. Maybe it is time to see -- to let Carly succeed or fail on her own. Hmm?",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Ow.",
        "Rosanna: Ooh.",
        "Craig: You know, I'm gonna go take a hot shower. That sofa is murder on my neck.",
        "Rosanna: I could help you work out the kinks.",
        "Craig: Well, I'll see you in the boudoir. [Phone rings] Oh, would you -- could you grab that?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Craig: It's right --",
        "Rosanna: Ah, found it.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Voila.",
        "Craig: Yes? Yes. Uh -- all right, well, thank you for telling me. That was Rod at the -- at Monte Carlo.",
        "Rosanna: The business manager?",
        "Craig: Yeah. Carly has been rushed to Memorial.",
        "Rosanna: What's wrong?",
        "Craig: Well, he wasn't sure. But, apparently, something is serious with the baby.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry to hear that. I suppose you'll be rushing right out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You've got to stop thinking negative thoughts, all right? All anybody's concerned about right now is the baby and you.",
        "Carly: Why? Why would anybody be concerned about me after everything I've done? I have no idea.",
        "Mike: Look -- the past is history. All right, let's deal with right now. And right now, you and the baby are okay.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Mike: I didn't do anything.",
        "Carly: You told me the truth. You've been my friend.",
        "Mike: Always.",
        "Molly: Hey, cuz. How're you holding up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Isaac: Are you sure that you believe everything that Jessica claims? See, you're not. Are you?",
        "Bonnie: Look, I wasn't there, Isaac. Okay? Only my mom and Marshall know exactly what happened. And I'm not gonna deny that her relationship with Marshall is somewhat complicated --",
        "Isaac: No, no, a relationship is what she was working towards with Ben. A relationship is what we have. What she has with Marshall is a completely different issue.",
        "Bonnie: Call it what you want. It was still complicated.",
        "Isaac: The man is a hustler. He is a user.",
        "Bonnie: I think he thinks he's in love with her.",
        "Isaac: What?! What suddenly gives you insight into that man's soul?",
        "Bonnie: This letter he wrote to her.",
        "Isaac: And you know what that letter says why?",
        "Bonnie: Because he had the nerve to ask me to give it to her. And I know she didn't want to see it, so --",
        "Isaac: You read it.",
        "Bonnie: I read it. Now you read it. And tell me what you think. Because I can't stand the sight of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Give me the phone, Marshall.",
        "Marshall: You are making a terrible mistake. This has gone far beyond a lovers' quarrel.",
        "Jessica: I am not your lover!",
        "Marshall: And I am not a violent man. Jessica, you have got to drop these ridiculous charges!",
        "Jessica: Leave my house now.",
        "Marshall: Listen to yourself! You're talking to me like I'm a stranger. Jessica, I've held you in my arms. I've loved you.",
        "Jessica: Stay away.",
        "Marshall: Listen to me, Jessica.",
        "Jessica: No! I want you to go!",
        "Marshall: Damn it, not like this! I can't! Jessica, just -- just come here. Come to me, so we can sit down and talk this out. We can work this --",
        "Jessica: Not another step, or I will shoot you. I swear to God, I will.",
        "Marshall: You really intend to shoot me?",
        "Jessica: I know how to use this. Now, I asked you to leave.",
        "Marshall: If I really raped you like you say I did, then -- I deserve your bullet.",
        "Jessica: Marshall, please. There's no jury to grandstand for. Just go!",
        "Marshall: I'm not grandstanding. It's just you and me here, Jessica, like it's been for weeks. You've never been afraid of me before.",
        "Jessica: Back off, Marshall. I'm warning you.",
        "Marshall: Come on, Jess. Go ahead, finish the job. 'Cause the charges you filed are killing me already. Just let me get a little closer, to make sure you get it right.",
        "Marshall: Go ahead, Jessica. Pull the trigger.",
        "[Jessica sobbing]",
        "Ben: Jessica!",
        "Jessica: Ben! Ben, in here! Ben!",
        "Ben: Get away from her!",
        "Cop #2: Freeze!",
        "Jessica: Oh, Ben --",
        "Ben: It's all right. Okay. You're all right. It's gonna be all right. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Isaac: \"You cling to Ben, hoping to wash away your own guilt. But you have nothing to feel guilty about, Jessica. What we shared was real. It was real that night, and it was real before. We both know this. I saw it in your eyes that night, just like I've seen it before. I craved your warm touch that night, and you gave it, just like before.\"",
        "Bonnie: Okay, stop. Stop it. I can't listen to any more of this.",
        "Isaac: \"I love you, Jessica. I can even understand your guilt. But don't run away from me. And don't use words that will only end up hurting us both. I'm not a rapist. Look into your soul, and you'll remember what I am, who I am and how much I have loved you.\" Well, you're right.",
        "Bonnie: I am?",
        "Isaac: This isn't a letter from some guy who's crazy or a violent criminal.",
        "Bonnie: He begged me. Isaac, he begged me to give that to her. And for some strange moment, I thought he was different. Hurt.",
        "Isaac: What do you think happened between the two of them?",
        "Bonnie: I believe my mother.",
        "Isaac: Then why'd you read the letter? Why didn't you tear it up the way your mother told you to? Why did you give it to me to read?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. I don't know, okay? But just give it back, because obviously, giving it to you was a mistake.",
        "Isaac: You don't really believe that. No, I think -- I think the same thing that's bothering me about this letter is what's bothering you. I think you showed me this letter, Bonnie, because you want me to help you find the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: So, you up for some more company?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I'd like that.",
        "Mike: I'll leave you two alone.",
        "Molly: So, I'm really sorry --",
        "Carly: Thanks for --",
        "Molly: Carly -- you've got to let go of it, all of it. You know that?",
        "Carly: What? Let what go?",
        "Molly: Mike, Jack, me.",
        "Carly: I don't think I can. I've blown it. I have blown it royally this time, Molly.",
        "Molly: Listen to me. You need to concentrate on the one thing that matters most right now, and that is that baby that's growing inside your tummy. Okay, she deserves to have a mommy who's happy and who's healthy. That's the truth.",
        "Carly: You're being so nice to me. Am I dying or something?",
        "Molly: Don't be ridiculous. I just think that this was a really big wake-up call for all of us. Time to stop the madness. And, you know, we made a vow the other night that we weren't gonna be enemies. But we said we weren't gonna be friends, either. What do you say we work on that?",
        "Carly: I'd like that.",
        "Molly: Good.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Molly: So, okay. Well, first thing I'll do when you get out of here is I'll bring a care package. You know, romance novels, fashion magazines, DVDs --",
        "Carly: You don't have to do that.",
        "Molly: Yes, I do. You've got to have something to do while you're laid up with your feet up on the sofa and -- you know, that place, the cabin's really pretty isolated.",
        "Carly: You know, I don't -- I don't think I'm gonna go back to the cabin.",
        "Molly: You're not?",
        "Carly: No. No, I don't think it's the best thing for me to do.",
        "Molly: Where, then?",
        "Carly: I don't know. You know, before this happened, I was thinking about buying my own place.",
        "Molly: Really? I mean, that's great. Do you really think this is the best time to go scrounging around for a mortgage, though?",
        "Carly: You're not gonna believe this. But I -- I asked Rozilla for an advance on my salary.",
        "Molly: You did not.",
        "Carly: I did.",
        "Molly: Carly -- what are you thinking? You're really that desperate to move away from Mike?",
        "Carly: No, it isn't -- it's not just Mike. Jack asked me to move back into Milltown. And I said no to him, too. I just -- I want -- I need some time to myself. To stand on my own. But I --",
        "Molly: \"But I\" what?",
        "Carly: I don't think I can do it.",
        "Molly: How about you let me help you?",

        "Dusty: Barbara. What about Barbara?",
        "Rose: That's the last person Paul wants here. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.",

        "Rose: With all this merriment? No, she wants to come down here and party with us. Me, aunt Rose. And you, grandma.",

        "Lily: Yeah, yeah. It was a little awkward there, when Dusty mentioned Barbara. Put Paul on the spot.",
        "Holden: I don't think Dusty realizes just how bad it is between Rose and Barbara.",
        "Lily: He was there when Barbara came to the party.",
        "Holden: That's true. He was the one who asked her to leave.",
        "Lily: Rose and Paul are engaged now. It's like everything seems so different. It's like -- Rose made Paul feel so awkward, nixing Barbara before he had a chance to say anything?",
        "Holden: You, of all people, should get why Rose doesn't want any part of Barbara.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I do. But that's his mother. I mean, he's getting married. He might want his whole family involved in the process. Rose has to understand those feelings.",
        "Holden: I don't know. Seemed okay to me.",

        "John: There have been situations where we've had to take the child in order to save the mother.",
        "Mike: Would the baby make it if you did?",
        "John: The baby is extremely premature. Look, in the meantime, you know, we can all help out by trying to keep her calm. All right? It is imperative that her blood pressure remain controlled.",
        "Jack: Thank you. I'm taking care of her. That's all there is to it. She's coming to live with me.",

        "Paul: And yet -- and yet, you have made all my dreams come true. I never imagined you would be the soul mate that I'd almost given up looking for.

        "Isaac: If you have doubts, if I have doubts, a jury would certainly have doubts, and especially when this letter comes to light.",
