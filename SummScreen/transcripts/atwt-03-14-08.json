        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Any news? Did Margo talk to the D.A. -- to drop the charges against Parker?",
        "Carly: How do you feel?",
        "Jack: Fine. How about Parker?",
        "Carly: I should tell the nurse you're awake. She'll want to know --",
        "Jack: Carly, what aren't you telling me?",
        "Carly: I'll feel better after the doctor sees you, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and I'll feel better if you just tell me the truth. Can we clear Parker?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, they're almost done. How many pancakes do you guys want?",
        "Will: I want a stack about this high.",
        "Gwen: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sage: Even Parker can't eat that many. And he eats like seven at a time.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah? We, I would really like to see that. It's too bad that Parker and J.J. couldn't spend the day with us. But we're really glad that we could spend the day with you. What do you want to do today?",
        "Will: You know what, we could go to the movies.",
        "Sage: When do you think my dad's going to call?",
        "Gwen: I bet you he calls before Will eats all those pancakes.",
        "Will: Yeah, I better eat fast. You're right.",
        "Sage: You guys are funny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Is that -- is that little Hallie? What in the world is she doing here?",
        "Sofie: I couldn't get a sitter. I didn't -- I didn't take the baby. Gwen gave her back to me. It's okay.",
        "Lisa: No, it really isn't okay. I'm sorry, baby must go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: You are too beautiful to be working like this. You should be in bed, with me.",
        "Vienna: I like doing this. It clears my mind.",
        "Gray: Well, I can think of more entertaining things to be doing.",
        "Vienna: Not now. I've got to get the coffee started and check the oven.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay, we need to figure out what the deal is with Matt and Gray Gerard. He must have said something in conversation.",
        "Casey: No, he's never mentioned the guy.",
        "Alison: What do you guys talk about? Maybe he let something slip.",
        "Casey: Just mainly guy stuff. You know, sports, video games, babes --",
        "Alison: Sounds deep.",
        "Casey: Look, at work, we barely talk to each other. And at home, he's always kissing up to my parents. He's not going to let anything slip in front of them.",
        "Alison: How are we going to do this?",
        "Casey: Why don't you just ask him?",
        "Alison: I did. He lied to me, but maybe if you ask him --",
        "Casey: No. No, I don't think so.",
        "Alison: It's the only way we're going to find out what's going on. I would go with you, but I have to go to work.",
        "Casey: Fine, I'll do it.",
        "Alison: Great. Stop by the hospital afterwards so you can fill me in, okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, you got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I am really glad you're up because I am starved. So, how about I call room service and order us two deluxe breakfasts?",
        "Katie: I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Brad: Now, come on, you got knocked on the head. You need to regain your strength. Now is not the time for calorie counting.",
        "Katie: Brad, you were wonderful to me last night. I was more scared than I let on, and you really came through for me. I just --",
        "Brad: Nothing's changed between us. It's cool. I get it. But a guy still has to eat, right? Even if it's with a friend?",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Brad: Right.",
        "Katie: Friends have breakfast together --",
        "Henry: Thanks, but I'm too miserable to eat.",
        "Katie: Henry, what's wrong with you?",
        "Henry: It's really over this time. I really lost Vienna for good.",
        "Brad: Oh, for Pete's sake, Henry, just -- just let her go. You know what they say, if you love someone, just set them free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I was waiting to tell you. I was waiting for you to get a little bit stronger.",
        "Jack: So that's it. They're not going to drop the charges against Parker.",
        "Carly: The D.A. said that unless we have solid evidence that Kit killed Sam, Parker is still going to have a trial.",
        "Jack: So, where does that leave us?",
        "Carly: Running out of time and options.",
        "Jack: There's got to be something we're missing.",
        "Carly: Kit was pretty good at covering her tracks.",
        "Jack: Nobody's that good. If Kit really was in Oakdale the night that Sam was killed, there's got to be proof of it someplace. We just got to find it --",
        "Carly: Metro was searched from top to bottom.",
        "Jack: Thank you --",
        "Carly: And there was no evidence found that Kit was there the night Sam was murdered.",
        "Jack: If Kit was anywhere in the vicinity, someone must have seen her.",
        "Carly: If we can find a witness, that would completely discredit her alibi.",
        "Jack: That would be enough to take D.A.",
        "Carly: Well, how do we start? We don't have much time.",
        "Jack: We've got to get Kit's picture out there. Maybe Brad and Katie can put it on the air. Do you mind asking Katie for help?",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack, if it means clearing Parker, Katie can be my new best friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: When did you start reading self-help books, Brad?",
        "Brad: You know, Henry, I know you don't want to hear this, but the facts are the fact Vienna had a choice to make, she made it. She chose the other guy. So, it's just time for you to move on.",
        "Henry: That -- that's the problem. I don't think I can do that. I can't imagine my life without her. She's my everything.",
        "Brad: Then you've got nothing.",
        "Henry: I guess you're right.",
        "Katie: No, he's not. That's the worst advice I've ever heard. Brad, if you love someone, you fight for them.",
        "Brad: Yeah, for how long?",
        "Katie: As long as it takes.",
        "Brad: And then what? Waste the rest of your life loving someone who's made it painfully clear that they're in love with someone else?",
        "Katie: It's better than knowing that you gave up the change for true happiness without so much as a fight --",
        "Brad: The only --only fools don't know when to quit.",
        "Katie: Well, I'd rather be a fool in love than a lonely quitter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: What are you doing here? I'm in the middle of something",
        "Matt: Things have gotten complicated.",
        "Gray: I thought you took care of that business with Henry Coleman.",
        "Matt: I did. It's Alison Stewart. She's asking a lot of questions.",
        "Gray: Yeah, so shut her up.",
        "Matt: Well, it might be a little too late for that. She's already talked to Casey. Look, if you want the plan to work, we've got to do this soon, or else they're going to figure out what you're up to.",
        "Gray: Are you telling me how to conduct my business?",
        "Matt: No, no, of course not --",
        "Gray: Good. From what you told me, it shouldn't be too hard to discredit those two. So just do whatever it takes.",
        "Matt: I'll try.",
        "Gray: No, don't try. Do it, Matt. I hired you to do a job. Make my problems disappear.",
        "Casey: We need to talk.",
        "Matt: Yeah, we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Thank you.",
        "Sage: I'm not hungry.",
        "Gwen: Aw, come on, it would make me really, really happy if you at least try it.",
        "Sage: Are you sad because Hallie's not here?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I am.",
        "Sage: Well, when is she coming home? I really want to hold her.",
        "Gwen: Um, Hallie's going --",
        "Will: Hallie's with her other mom right now.",
        "Sage: Hallie has two mommies?",
        "Gwen: Will and I decided that --",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Sage: Mommy!",
        "Carly: Hey, hi, Baby.",
        "Sage: Is Daddy here?",
        "Carly: Uh, no, Sweetheart, he's -- he's still at the hospital. And he's getting better and he misses you a lot.",
        "Sage: When can we go see him?",
        "Carly: Soon -- soon, I'll take you, but I'd like to talk to Gwen now.",
        "Will: Okay, why don't we finish that movie we started yesterday?",
        "Gwen: Is Jack okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, he's fine. It's Parker. The D.A. won't drop the charges.",
        "Gwen: Oh, God, Carly, I'm sorry. What are you going to do?",
        "Carly: I'm his mom. I'm going to keep fighting for him.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, Carly. Is there anything we can do to help? Anything --",
        "Carly: Yeah, if it's all right, you would keep Sage for the day?",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah, of course, we'd love to.",
        "Carly: Are you sure? It's not too much trouble with the baby?",
        "Gwen: Um, no, Will and I don't have Hallie anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I don't have anyone I can leave her with, and if I don't work, I can't pay a sitter.",
        "Lisa: Honey, I know, I understand. Believe me, I do. But I cannot have a little baby here -- this is a place of business. Her crying will disturb all of my customers.",
        "[Hallie crying]",
        "Sofie: No, she -- she will be so good. She will be so good, right, Sweetie?",
        "Lisa: Well --",
        "Sofie: You never cry --",
        "Lisa: Yes, they do. They cry, especially when you don't want them to.",
        "Sofie: No, no -- I can get her to stop. It won't happen again.",
        "Lisa: Come on -- maybe she just wants to be held. Do you? Oh, my goodness. Oh, the child is burning up.",
        "Sofie: No, she's just a little warm, she's bundled up.",
        "Lisa: Just -- I know what I'm talking about. She has a fever and you must get her to the hospital immediately.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I just thought that we were doing what was best for Hallie.",
        "Carly: And now?",
        "Gwen: You just said it, you know, a mom never stops fighting for her child. And I guess I just didn't realize --",
        "Carly: No, you were a terrific mother. And Hallie was very lucky to have you, even if it was just for a short time.",
        "Gwen: Well, you're the best mom I've ever known. Where do you think I learned everything from? Listen, I'm fine, you go do what you need to do, okay?",
        "Carly: Are you sure you're going to be okay?",
        "Gwen: Yes, I'm positive. Just bring back good news.",
        "Carly: I intend to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hi, Dad.",
        "Jack: Hey, Buddy. Shouldn't you be in school?",
        "Parker: I had a free period.",
        "Jack: What's up?",
        "Parker: There's something I need to tell you, but you're not going to like it. So if you're not up to it, I could come back.",
        "Jack: No, I'm fine. What do you think I'm not gonna like?",
        "Parker: I'm an adult, right? At least the court says I'm one. So I've made up my mind. I'm pleading guilty.",
        "Jack: You most certainly are not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: If Henry gets out now, he's got a chance to find someone who wants him, only him.",
        "Katie: And he risks losing the best thing that ever happened to him.",
        "Brad: Do know what your problem is, Katie? You know what your problem is, is you cannot admit when you're wrong.",
        "Katie: What? Oh, my God. Look who's talking! Henry -- oh, nice, you scared him away. Great job.",
        "Brad: No, I didn't scare him away. You scared him away with all your talk about Jack.",
        "Katie: Jack?",
        "Brad: Admit it. Admit it, you're not over him and you never will be.",
        "Katie: Oh, drop it, Brad. I do not need your advice.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you have made that perfectly clear. But you know, guess what? I'm done. I am done. And you know, finally, one day when you realize that you and I --",
        "Katie: No, enough, enough. We are friends, Brad. Co-workers. That's it.",
        "Brad: Fine.",
        "Katie: Good. Glad we cleared that up. Let's go to work.",
        "Brad: Suits me, Buddy.",
        "Katie: Okay, so what do we know about today's guest?",
        "Brad: She's an expert on exotic cuisine. So in other words, it's not going to be pretty.",
        "Katie: Ooh, can you taste whatever she's cooking?",
        "Brad: No, no way. You know, I held the baby tarantula last week, and the week before that I ate the alligator meat.",
        "Katie: So? You said it tasted like chicken. Can you do this one thing for me?",
        "Brad: As a friend?",
        "Katie: Oh, come on, please don't be like that.",
        "Brad: Well, I don't know what you expect from me, Katie --",
        "Carly: Hi, I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "Katie: It's okay. Is everything okay with Jack?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Jack's fine. I'm here because I need your help.",
        "Katie: Our help?",
        "Carly: It's not for me, exactly. It's for Parker. I need you to put Kit's picture on the air to see if anyone saw her in Oakdale the night of Sam's murder.",
        "Brad: You got it. I'd do anything for Parker.",
        "Katie: We both would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I just want this whole thing to be over.",
        "Jack: Listen, Parker, I know this has been tough on you.",
        "Parker: No, I'm not worried about myself. You almost died trying to help me. Mom is sad all the time. J.J. is getting picked on at school. I just want to stop hurting you Guys.",
        "Jack: And you think pleading guilty to a crime you didn't commit is helping us? Parker, we love you. Losing you right now would be the worst thing for any of us. We're not giving up and neither should you. [Cell phone rings] Yeah?",
        "Carly: Turn on the TV.",
        "Jack: Okay. Get the remote, turn the TV on.",
        "Brad: Take a good look at this picture, please. If anyone has any knowledge of this woman's whereabouts on the night of February 8th around 8:00 P.M., call the toll free number at the bottom of the screen.",
        "Katie: A child's future may depend on it.",
        "Parker: You really think this is going to work?",
        "Jack: It's worth a shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: And we're out.",
        "Katie: Oh, I hope this helps.",
        "Carly: It has to. This may be our last chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: You no longer have any business here, Coleman.",
        "Henry: I need to see Vienna.",
        "Gray: She's not interested in hearing any more of your ridiculous accusations against me.",
        "Henry: She'll want to hear this.",
        "Gray: You look like a fool, okay? Vienna has made her choice.",
        "Vienna: Henry, what are you doing here?",
        "Gray: He was just leaving.",
        "Henry: No, I'm not. Not until you hear how I feel.",
        "Vienna: Its l right. Please, give us a minute.",
        "Henry: Okay, here goes. I love you. And you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. But I know now that that's not enough. That if you don't love me back, this isn't going to work. So I want you and Gray to be happy together. Most of all, I want you to be happy. So I guess -- goodbye -- forever.",
        "Vienna: No, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: So what's up, man? Are you still freaking out about the fact that your parents found out we lied to them?",
        "Casey: No. I'm just wondering if that's the only thing you're lying about.",
        "Matt: What are you talking about, Dude?",
        "Casey: Don't pretend that you don't know this Gray Gerard guy and he's some random person you met at the bar. We both know he's bad news.",
        "Matt: So what if he is? What does that have to do with me?",
        "Casey: That's what I would like to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Sofie? What happened? Are you okay?",
        "Sofie: It's Hallie. I don't know -- I don't know what's wrong with her. How is my baby?",
        "Doctor #1: We've managed to bring down the fever.",
        "Alison: Oh, thank God. Is she all right?",
        "Doctor #1: We're running tests. Hallie's red blood cell count is dangerously low. She's severely anemic.",
        "Sofie: Is that my fault?",
        "Doctor #1: It's no one's fault. We don't know what caused it, and it doesn't matter right now. Your baby needs a blood transfusion. Do you know if you're compatible?",
        "Sofie: I'm A-positive.",
        "Doctor #1: That won't work. What about the baby's father?",
        "Sofie: I don't know. I don't know where he is.",
        "Doctor #1: Find him. If you want your baby to recover, we need him here ASAP.",

        "Gwen: Hey, you still worried about your dad?",
        "Sage: A little.",
        "Gwen: Well, I know something that might cheer you up. Always works for me.",
        "Sage: What?",
        "Gwen: Shopping.",
        "Sage: Yeah!",
        "Gwen: Yeah?",
        "Sage: Can we get something for my dad and bring it to him in the hospital?",
        "Will: That's a good idea. You Guys can pick me something out, too.",
        "Sage: Aren't you coming?",
        "Will: No, shopping's for girls.",
        "Gwen: Come on, it'll be fun.",
        "Will: No, 'cause I know how this starts. You guys say you're going to pick out a few things, and I'm there trying to take a nap on some uncomfortable chair while you're doing twirls.",
        "Gwen: We're gonna buy ice cream.",
        "Will: Okay, fine, I'll come.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Cole, call me as soon as you get this. The baby is sick. She needs you. It is an emergency. So please -- please, call me.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry if you think I'm interfering, but there is another way.",
        "Sofie: What? I'll do whatever it takes.",
        "Alison: Call Gwen. She's Cole's sister. She might be a match. And she loves Hallie more than anything in this world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, do you guys want to stop by the bookstore first?",
        "Will: I think Sage wants to go to Fashions.",

        "Gwen: No, it's okay. Is Hallie okay?",
        "Sofie: No.",
        "Gwen: What happened?",
        "Sofie: She's sick. She needs you. Please, you might be the only one who can help her.",

        "Woman: Wow, Brad, it's really you. Is there a reward?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah, of course there's a reward, if your information turns out to be accurate. Do you have any actual information?",
        "Woman: That depends. Can I meet Brad?",
        "Brad: Yeah, sure. What can you tell us about the woman in the picture?",
        "Woman: I'm free Saturday night.",
        "Katie: What if she had some information?",
        "Carly: She doesn't have any information! She's wants a date. Damn it. What am I going to do now?",

        "Will: So what happened?",
        "Sofie: I don't know. She seemed fine this morning, just a little fussy.",
        "Alison: Hallie's severely anemic. It could've been caused by a virus or some kind of anomaly. But she needs a blood transfusion, and she needs it now.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I'm not compatible, so I was hoping that since your Cole's sister --",
        "Gwen: What do I have to do?",
        "Alison: Follow me.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: What I don't get is how Kit managed to sneak around town without getting noticed. I mean, she had 24-hour police surveillance following her around. How come she was never caught?",
        "Carly: Brad, that's it.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: What? What?",
        "Carly: Well, Kit snuck into my house the day that she attacked Katie, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah, right. I've got the goose egg to prove it.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but the cops didn't see her.",
        "Carly: Right. She must've been wearing a disguise. And maybe she was wearing that same disguise the night that she killed Sam.",
        "Katie: That would explain why no one's calling.",
        "Carly: Well, I have to talk to Jack. Maybe there's still hope.",

        "Sofie: What's taking so long? Hallie needs the transfusion now.",
        "Will: What I don't understand is how did you let it get to this point? When you saw that she was sick, why didn't you just call the doctors right away?",
        "Sofie: I didn't know right away. She was a little cranky, but I didn't think it meant anything. I took her to work. Lisa noticed she was warm. Babies get fevers all the time. They can get them from teething.",
        "Will: You know this wasn't from teething.",
        "Sofie: It started this morning, Will. You're acting like I let her be sick for days.",
        "Will: Okay, Sofie, I know it's not your fault, but I am worried.",
        "Sofie: Me, too. Gwen has to be a match. She has to. What do you thin the odds are?",
        "Will: I don't know.",
        "Sofie: You hate me, don't you?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Sofie: You know, I put Gwen through so much. And I still manage to find ways to ask for more.",
        "Will: Gwen's giving blood right now, and that's all. And she's doing that because she loves Hallie, which is why she's done everything for her. Which is why she broke her own heart, and mine, too.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry. What do you want me to say?",
        "Will: Nothing. Don't. Please, don't try.",
        "Sofie: You know, Hallie is going to know all about this. I'm going to tell her about you and Gwen and how much you gave up to give her the life she deserves.",
        "Will: With you?",
        "Sofie: I gave birth to her. She's part of me.",
        "Will: I know, I know. That's not what matters right now. What matters is that we fix this.",
        "Sofie: I can't help but think that I'm the one who should be able to fix it. I'm her mother and I can't help my own child because I don't have what it takes.",
        "Will: Well, some parents just aren't the right match for their kids.",
        "Sofie: I thought maybe Cole -- but then he wasn't there when I called.",
        "Will: You called Cole? What the hell is wrong with you?",

        "Matt: Hey, I'm no expert on Gray Gerard. I barely know the guy.",
        "Casey: Well, you know he's a crook.",
        "Matt: Where he gets his money from is his business. So he likes to throw his cash around -- why shouldn't I try to take some?",
        "Casey: Well, because you're a convicted felon. Is his money really worth going back to jail? Come on, be straight with me, Man. Are you seriously clueless about this guy?",
        "Matt: He paid me a lot of money, so I don't ask a lot of questions.",
        "Casey: And now?",
        "Matt: Like you even have to ask. Come on, Man. I'm trying to stay clean here, just like you.",
        "Casey: I hope so, Man.",

        "Vienna: We've meant too much to each other to end it like this. You can't cut me out of your life.",
        "Henry: I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't see you with another man and pretend that it isn't killing me. Even I can't pull off a con like that.",
        "Vienna: But you're my best friend.",
        "Gray: You'll make new friends when we go to Monte Carlo for the grand prix.",

        "Brad: You're worrying about Jack?",
        "Katie: Of course I am, aren't you?",
        "Brad: He's my brother.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and he's my -- why does it even matter what I think? Jack has other things to worry about.",
        "Brad: That's true.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Brad: But it doesn't make your feelings go away, right? You want to be with Jack, you still think you have a chance with him, then you shouldn't let any of that stuff get in your way. Go be with him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Why wouldn't I try to get in touch with Cole?",
        "Will: Why? How about because he's a sleazy, lying bastard who tried to make money off his own kid.",
        "Sofie: He's the biological father, Will. And today is kind of all about biology, don't you think?",
        "Will: You know, if Cole was the only person who was a match for Hallie, then you wouldn't have had a choice. But you did have a choice, and still you were willing to bring that piece of dirt back into her life again.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, you're damn right I was willing. If someone can help save my baby's life, then I'm not going to make him pass a purity test first.",
        "Will: Whatever. You didn't talk to him, though. You said he wasn't there, right?",
        "Sofie: No. No, I left a message.",
        "Will: How long ago?",
        "Sofie: I don't know, a couple of hours? What does it matter? He didn't get back to me. He's probably ignoring the whole thing.",
        "Will: Well, that sounds like Cole.",
        "Sofie: Yeah.",
        "Will: Gwen should be done by now.",
        "Sofie: I know. I know. We have to find out what's going on. Who can we call?",

        "Katie: You know I can't get back with Jack, especially now with everything going on with Parker.",
        "Brad: You don't know until you try.",
        "Katie: What is with you today? First you tell Henry to give up on Vienna, and then you tell me to go back to Jack.",
        "Brad: No, this is different. Vienna dumped Henry.",
        "Katie: Isn't that what Jack did to me?",
        "Brad: No, no. He left you because he thought Carly was dying. You see, getting dumped -- that's the kiss of death.",
        "Katie: So you think Jack and I belong together?",
        "Brad: Look, I want you to do what's gonna make you happy.",
        "Katie: So you don't think we belong together?",
        "Brad: Look, I'm not in position to tell you what to do. I've tried, and you have shot me down every time.",
        "Katie: Right, because I belong with Jack.",
        "Brad: If you say so.",

        "Carly: No one saw Kit.",
        "Parker: So it's over? I'm going to jail.",
        "Carly: No, not necessarily. Listen, I think that all this time that we've been looking for the wrong person. Shouldn't you be at school?",
        "Parker: I have a free period. So who are we looking for?",
        "Jack: We aren't looking for anyone. And your free period ended like 20 minutes ago.",
        "Parker: You could write me a note.",
        "Carly: Parker, I need to talk to your dad. Would you get back to class?",
        "Parker: Yeah. The only good thing about going to jail is that I won't have to go to that stupid school anymore.",
        "Carly: Nice.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean we've been looking for the wrong person? I thought we determined that Kit was the shooter.",
        "Carly: Oh no, Kit did it. But no one has come forward to say they saw her, because they didn't know it was her they saw, Jack. She was wearing a disguise.",
        "Jack: Very good. Problem is, now we don't know who we're looking for.",

        "Gray: I know what will cheer you up. Next week, I have business in London. Come with me. We'll go shopping at Harrods's, we'll spend the weekend in Paris.",
        "Vienna: I can't leave town. What about the diner?",
        "Gray: Trust me, the moment we land, you will not be thinking about this diner. And by the time that we're in the Galeries Lafayette, you'll forget that Oakdale even exists. Vienna, I am offering you everything that you ever dreamed of.",
        "Vienna: That's the problem. The only thing I ever dream about is Henry.",
        "Gray: That'll change once we're in Paris.",
        "Vienna: No, it won't. Because none of this Matters to me without Henry.",
        "Gray: I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Vienna: I never intended to hurt you. You've been nothing but kind and generous.",
        "Gray: But it wasn't enough. You know, if you need time to work out your feelings, I understand. But if there's a chance for us --",
        "Vienna: No. It will always be Henry.",
        "Gray: Very well, then.",

        "Gray: Don't be. Now I know what we have to do. It's time to put the plan in motion.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, it was obvious that Kit was following you. Those dummies turned up everywhere -- the house, the mall, the car. Let's start at the mall. The security office has to have a log of surveillance tapes. If we can grab those tapes, then we might be able to put together what kind of disguise she s wearing. We're gonna need a subpoena, though.",
        "Carly: We don't have time for that, Jack. I'll get the tapes.",
        "Jack: No, Carly, this has to be on the up and up.",

        "Jack: You've already done so much for my family already --",
        "Katie: Jack, it was my family, too. And I feel like I keep letting you all down. If I hadn't walked in when I did, you wouldn't be like this. Parker would be free.",
        "Jack: No, this isn't your fault. I put you in the middle of a dangerous situation and somehow managed to make you feel guilty about it. That's not what I want for you.",
        "Katie: I know that. But it's all we've got, and it's better than nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi. Excuse me, sir. I lost my wallet out in the parking lot. I don't suppose anyone's turned a wallet in?",
        "Guard: Let me see here. No, there's nothing here.",
        "Carly: On, I don't know what I'm going to do. My ex-husband is going to kill me if he finds out that I lost my credit cards again. Unless, of course, you have a security tape of the parking lot. If I could just take a look at it --",
        "Guard: I'm sorry, lady. I can't release those tapes without authorization.",
        "Carly: Do you think maybe you could make an exception? I am trying to let my ex-husband know that he can trust me, or he'll never let me see my children again.",

        "Casey: Yeah, I'm glad they let you have a break.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but I don't have much time. Okay, so how do we figure out what Matt's up to?",
        "Casey: We don't. Okay, maybe it's time just to admit it's just none of our business.",
        "Alison: How can you say that? He wouldn't be lying so much if he wasn't doing something shady. I have a really bad feeling about this, Casey.",
        "Casey: So what do you suggest we do?",
        "Alison: Matt likes me. Maybe I start using that to my advantage.",
