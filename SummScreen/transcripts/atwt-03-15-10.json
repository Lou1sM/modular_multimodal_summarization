        "Dusty and Jack disagree vehemently about the role Dusty will play in his baby's life. Carly and Janet disagree about Carly's role in regards to the soon-to-be baby. Liberty calls home because the doctors need to talk with her, as Parker tells Janet that Liberty needs her. Barbara sees Henry and Vienna in a passionate kiss and interrupts them. She stays mum about their relationship even as Vienna says some things that bother Barbara. Janet rushes to tell Dusty that she needs to get to Liberty, as Jack and Carly are there too so they all go. Henry seems torn between Barbara now that Vienna is back, but she wants to save face and tells him that there is nothing to worry about because what they had was fleeting and he can go back to his real love now. The doctors worry about how Liberty is responding to the treatment. She has to choose whether to go forward. Parker is adamant that Liberty continue to fight, but ultimately it is up to Liberty. Although she is exhausted, she agrees to continue with treatments. Janet can't help herself and tells Liberty about the baby. Liberty is not happy and wishes they had not chosen to have a baby who may not even save her; then they will be left with a baby that was unwanted. Janet, Jack and Dusty convince her that the baby is wanted no matter what. Liberty is still upset and bothered that her mom is tied now to someone that no longer loves her. Dusty and Liberty speak alone where he admits to his love for her mom and how he wants to marry and be a family with her. Liberty and Dusty convince Janet to accept Dusty's proposal with ease. Jack interrupts the moment, but he wishes her all the happiness and they talk about moving forward with an annulment. Carly tells Parker about the baby; he is happy there is hope, but he worries what this means for his mom and dad. They will get through this; she promises that they will not give up on one another again. Vienna wants to get frisky with Henry, but he seems preoccupied and even excuses himself to call Barbara, who is returning the dress to Lisa that he bought her. She talks of how silly she was to be with Henry, but Lisa thinks she should cut herself so slack because she has seemed very happy. Vienna plays dress up and Henry is enamored by Vienna even though he has mixed feelings. Barbara is about to knock on Henry's door when she hears Vienna laugh; she leaves unnoticed, but soon after Henry stops Vienna from kissing him, as Vienna is shocked. The actual end of his marriage saddens Jack, as he watches Janet, Dusty and Liberty together as a family. He heads over to see Carly and wonders where his place will be with his child now. She promises the baby will always be his as will she. This makes Jack very happy."

        "Jack: What do you mean, I'm free to be with Carly? I need your permission all of a sudden?",
        "Dusty: I mean that I'm gonna marry Janet as soon as we get through all the red tape.",
        "Jack: Is that what my marriage is now, red tape?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna take care of her and her children.",
        "Jack: Has Janet said yes to any of this?",
        "Dusty: She's not gonna accept my proposal while she's still married. She's not that kind of woman.",
        "Jack: Really? Well, when I married her, she wasn't the kind of woman who'd sleep around on her husband. Things change.",
        "Dusty: You've moved on. Janet has the right to do the same. So, once we're married and the baby's born, I'm gonna want to adopt the baby.",
        "Jack: What? No. The hell you are. You're not adopting my child. When Janet and I decided to do this, we agreed that we'd raise this baby together.",
        "Dusty: Things change.",
        "Jack: Not that. You're not getting your hands on my kid, Donovan.",
        "Dusty: I thought all you wanted was Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I want you to leave, Carly.",
        "Carly: Janet, I know how easy it is to stop taking care of yourself when things get crazy. So, if I have to come over here every day to be sure that you're taking your prenatal vitamins and looking after yourself --",
        "Janet: Oh, my vitamins. I forgot about those. I was so stressed out about the sonogram.",
        "Carly: Don't worry about it. Just get it now.",
        "Janet: I can't take a pill with milk.",
        "Carly: Yes, you can. You'll get used to it. This way you get a whole day's calcium at one time.",
        "Janet: I have been pregnant before.",
        "Carly: When you were a teenager and alone.",
        "Janet: How dare you throw that in my face?",
        "Carly: I'm not saying anything you haven't told me like a dozen times yourself.",
        "Janet: Well, given your track record as a mother, how dare you judge me?",
        "Carly: I'm not judging. I'm helping.",
        "Janet: If you want to help me, go home.",
        "Carly: Janet, I'm not the enemy. Here you go. Drink up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I wish you didn't have to go back to Oakdale today.",
        "Parker: You're the one who told me to go back and finish the school year. I mean, just say the word and I'll blow it off.",
        "Liberty: No. I don't want you to stop your life because of me. And what would we talk about, how pathetic we both are?",
        "Parker: You're not pathetic.",
        "Liberty: I wish I could at least hug you goodbye. [Sighs]",
        "Parker: Hi. She seems really out of it today. Maybe you guys need to switch up her meds or something.",
        "Nurse: I wish it were that simple.",
        "Liberty: Is my leukemia getting worse?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Barbara, you've never been a coward. Don't start now. Vienna! What an unexpected surprise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly's being very understanding about the baby. She knows how much it means to me.",
        "Dusty: I'm sure she does.",
        "Jack: What the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "Dusty: You couldn't save Brad. At least you can save his daughter, right?",
        "Jack: Is that what you think this baby is to me, a bone-marrow donor?",
        "Dusty: Isn't it?",
        "Jack: Not even close. This is my son or daughter you're talking about, and unfortunately for you, that means that Janet and I are gonna be connected for the rest of our lives.",
        "Dusty: You can have visitation on weekends, holidays, whatever.",
        "Jack: [Laughs] That is not for you to decide, Donovan!",
        "Dusty: She and I are gonna raise this child --",
        "Jack: Oh, man, if you think I'm not gonna have a say in the way my child is raised, you're even crazier than I thought! Guy: Hey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I am not taking advice on motherhood from a woman who can barely take care of herself.",
        "Carly: I'm gonna pretend that remark is hormone-related.",
        "Janet: It wasn't.",
        "Carly: Come on, Janet. You had to know this was gonna be complicated, you having Jack's baby.",
        "Janet: Well, if you don't want it to be complicated, you can stay out of it.",
        "Carly: Well, what should I do? Walk away, let you and Jack play mummy and daddy?",
        "Janet: We are the parents.",
        "Carly: And Jack is with me. So, like it or not, I'm involved in this.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Janet: Hello?",
        "Liberty: Mom?",
        "Janet: Hi, Sweetie! Are you okay?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I'm -- I'm fine. A lot better.",
        "Janet: Really? 'Cause you sound kind of funny. Are you sure?",
        "Liberty: I'm just not crazy about being the girl in the plastic bubble. That's all.",
        "Janet: I know. I know. I understand. But that's why you're there, to get well.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. That's why I'm calling, Mom. The doctor wants to talk to us.",
        "Janet: I need to speak with my daughter, in private, please.",
        "Carly: This conversation is not over.",
        "Janet: Okay. So, what did he say?",
        "Liberty: It's a lot to explain.",
        "Parker: Janet.",
        "Janet: Parker. What's -- is she okay?",
        "Liberty: I'm fine.",
        "Parker: She's -- she's okay. She's just -- she's tired. The doctor will explain everything when you get here.",
        "Liberty: Sorry, Mom. I just -- I don't feel like talking on the phone right now.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's okay, Sweetheart. Listen, I love you, and I'm gonna get there as soon as I can. You just make sure and get some rest, okay?",
        "Liberty: I love you, too.",
        "Janet: Parker, are you still there?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Liberty needs you. I know its short notice, but could you get back here, like, now?",
        "Janet: You tell her I'm on my way. And, Parker -- thank you for being there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Now, you listen to me, Donovan. Janet and I are married, and until that changes, don't even think about telling me what my rights are where my child's concerned.",
        "Dusty: So you want your cake and Carly, too?",
        "Jack: And you want my kid.",
        "Dusty: Janet's kid, the kid you never wanted in the first place.",
        "Jack: Oh, we are past that! The child is real! I'm the father, and I'm taking it very seriously!",
        "Dusty: Are you?",
        "Jack: Yes. And for you to adopt my kid, I'd have to give up all parental rights, and that, my friend, is never gonna happen!",
        "Carly: Hey. What's going on?",
        "Jack: Dusty wants to adopt Janet's baby.",
        "Carly: Why would you want to do that? The baby has a father.",
        "Jack: That's what I've been trying to tell him. No one will let you adopt anyway. How many times have you been arrested? Your record alone makes you an unfit parent!",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Janet: Liberty's in trouble.",
        "Jack: What happened?",
        "Janet: Well, the doctor wants to see us, but she sounded like she was in pretty bad shape.",
        "Dusty: We'll take my jet. We'll be in Minneapolis within the hour. Let's go.",
        "Jack: Carly and I are coming, too. Once we find out that Liberty's okay, we'll bring Parker home.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Jack: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So, Vienna, are you in Oakdale for long? Just passing through, on your way to Milan for the collections?",
        "Vienna: No. I'm just tired of traveling. I just want to be at home with my Henry. You know, I never thought I would want to stay in one place with one man, but being away from this man changed my outlook on everything.",
        "Barbara: How wonderful.",
        "Vienna: Yes, and I missed you so much when I was away from you, but I just couldn't bear watching how your father's money had changed you.",
        "Henry: Maybe we should discuss this in private.",
        "Barbara: It's quite all right, Henry.",
        "Vienna: You know, I really thought I'd lost you, but when Katie called and told me that you were donating away your entire inheritance to the hospital to build a new wing, I was --",
        "Barbara: You're doing what?",
        "Henry: I can explain that.",
        "Vienna: What is there to explain? You went crazy when you found out that James Stenbeck was your father. Quite frankly, who wouldn't be? But now you're doing everything to make up for it, and I think it's wonderful.",
        "Henry: Would you stop it? Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me.",
        "Vienna: No! Oh, my love, I'm sorry, but it's the truth, and, you know, I -- I was able to let go of my own anger, and I forgave you for sleeping with Barbara.",
        "Henry: Really? I didn't know that. That's -- that's good.",
        "Vienna: And I forgave Barbara, too. It wasn't your fault that Henry had sex with you.",
        "Barbara: Really? Whose fault was it?",
        "Vienna: Well, isn't it obvious? His mother forced him into it.",
        "Henry: I don't think she forced me into it.",
        "Vienna: She made you so turned around that you didn't know what you were doing.",
        "Barbara: He hardly needed a road map.",
        "Vienna: Oh, he must have. Otherwise, he would never have wound up on top of you. Oh, well. To new beginnings. I'm just one guy, but when I fill out the census",
        "Henry: Well, this has been fun. I'm sure we have things to do, though. We have things to do?",
        "Barbara: I'm in no rush.",
        "Henry: You're not?",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Vienna: Relax, Henry. We're celebrating. Where's the waiter? I want to have more champagne. This is delicious.",
        "Barbara: Well, Henry must agree. That's what, two, three glasses for you? Does philanthropy make you nervous, Henry?",
        "Henry: No. I think Katie may have exaggerated how much money I'm actually giving away.",
        "Vienna: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: I mean, it happened so fast. Liebchen, you know, I got to know who my father was. Really, it was almost too late.",
        "Vienna: Well, I, for one, am glad you didn't know him, because if you did, we might never have met.",
        "Barbara: I disagree. I think if James had died before Henry knew --",
        "Vienna: We might never have split up.",
        "Barbara: A lot of things might never have happened, but I don't believe that life is better lived in ignorance.",
        "Henry: Knowing James has given me many wonderful things --",
        "Vienna: And now you're going to use those millions of wonderful things to save lives.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, but it's the only thing I have left of my father. I'm not sure I'm ready to give that up.",
        "Vienna: Oh, that is a beautiful sentiment, my love, but there's no reason to hold on to anything that has to do with James Stenbeck. I mean, everything that man has ever touched is old, sick, and corrupt.",
        "Henry: No, not everything! No!",
        "Vienna: You know, I think Henry was right. We should go. I want to go up stairs and get settled back into our room.",
        "Henry: Our room?",
        "Vienna: Yes, since it's been so long since you and I've been alone together.",
        "Barbara: You do realize that Henry thought you were never coming back, don't you?",
        "Vienna: Excuse me?",
        "Barbara: I mean, I know you tend to take Henry for granted, but do you realize that he's a very desirable man? Did you just think that he was going to wait for you?",
        "Henry: Oh, come on! I'm not that desirable!",
        "Barbara: Aren't you even curious who might have been spending time in Henry's room while you were gone?",
        "Vienna: Okay. Is there something the two of you want to tell me? Hmm?",
        "Barbara: No. No, no, no. What Henry and I had was nothing, a mere dalliance. Right, Henry? It's over, right?",
        "Henry: I don't know what to say.",
        "Barbara: You've already said enough. I'm gonna let you two lovebirds get reacquainted.",
        "Vienna: Oh, thank God. I never thought she was gonna leave. So, are you ready to re-christen our suite?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Why don't you go first and get started without me, hmm?",
        "Vienna: Something wrong?",
        "Henry: No, no. It's just, if I knew you were coming, I would have had a nice bottle of wine waiting for you upstairs.",
        "Vienna: Okay. Well, why don't you stop by in the kitchen on your way back and see if the pastry chef has some leftover whipped cream.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh.",
        "Liberty: I know. I'm sorry I can't hug you.",
        "Janet: Oh, so am I, Sweetheart. I'm sorry all this is happening.",
        "Liberty: Please don't get upset. I don't think I could stand it.",
        "Dusty: I'll take care of her, Liberty.",
        "Janet: But who's gonna take care of her?",
        "Liberty: Are you kidding? I've got an army of nurses in space suits who give me everything I need, even germ-free chocolate pudding.",
        "Janet: Oh! I should have made you some lasagna! I should have brought that! We just didn't have time. We were in such a rush.",
        "Liberty: That's okay, Mom. I don't feel much like eating.",
        "Janet: I'm here now, Sweetheart. Everything's gonna be okay.",
        "Liberty: I wish that were true.",
        "Doctor: Liberty's extremely fragile. Continuing treatment will be very hard on her. She has to make a decision if she wants to go forward.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: She doesn't have a choice. If she stops now, she could die.",
        "Jack: Is that true? What does Liberty think?",
        "Parker: Well, she's exhausted, and she just wants to feel better. These treatments, they make her feel worse, but she just can't quit now.",
        "Carly: I know that's how it seems --",
        "Parker: No, it's how it is! She's taking so much medicine that she can't even think straight, and she's confused! But you guys need to go in there and tell her that she has to keep going! Please, just tell her!",
        "Carly: I know how much you care about her, but she's 18. This is her choice. We can't make it for her.",
        "Parker: Well, you can at least go in there and tell her what you think that she should do, can't you?",
        "Carly: I'm sure her mom will talk to her, but, ultimately, it is her decision.",
        "Parker: What if she makes the wrong one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart? It's your body, it's your fight, and if it gets too much or it's too painful, you just say the word and I will take you home.",
        "Liberty: Parker would never forgive me if I died on him.",
        "Janet: So you're saying --",
        "Liberty: I'm not giving up, Mom. I'll keep on with the treatments.",
        "Janet: Thank God.",
        "Dusty: You're very brave, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: I don't know about that.",
        "Dusty: This isn't the first time you had to make a tough decision. I'm proud of you.",
        "Liberty: Thanks. Okay, Mom?",
        "Janet: Heck, you're the one that's doing all the hard work. If you can do this, so can I.",
        "Dusty: Liberty's decided to go ahead with the next round of treatments.",
        "Carly: There, okay? Now you know. She's gonna keep fighting. So, why don't we go back to the hotel and pack your things, okay?",
        "Parker: Well, I'd like to go say goodbye to her first.",
        "Carly: Oh, Parker. She hasn't seen her mom in a long time. Why don't we just let them spend a little time together, okay? We'll stop by on the way to the airport.",
        "Jack: I'll tell her where you are.",
        "Parker: Okay, but please don't forget.",
        "Jack: I won't. I promise.",
        "Carly: I love you.",
        "Janet: Okay, so, you're the one who's gonna be running the show here. If the treatments get to be too much for you and you can't take it, you just stop, all right? But you don't have to worry if that happens, because we have a backup plan.",
        "Jack: Janet, I don't think you should --",
        "Janet: No, no. This is good news. Honey, I'm pregnant.",
        "Liberty: What? No. I told you I didn't want that. You weren't supposed to let this happen!",
        "Janet: I know you're upset.",
        "Liberty: This is not what I want! I told you that!",
        "Jack: No, I know you did, but by then --",
        "Liberty: By then what? You two couldn't stop yourselves?",
        "Jack: By then your mother was already pregnant, Liberty.",
        "Janet: We just didn't know it.",
        "Liberty: Well, what if the baby's not a match? Then you two will still be broken up and stuck with a kid you didn't even want.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no, no. We are gonna love this baby no matter what.",
        "Jack: Your mother's right. I would never have agreed to this unless I was committed to be the best father I could possibly be to this baby.",
        "Janet: This baby is a miracle. It has to be. Otherwise, it wouldn't have happened so easily. This baby could save your life, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Or not, and then you'll hate it.",
        "Janet: No. This is more than just a donor baby. This baby is already a person in his own right. It's a little girl or a little boy or a little brother or sister for you. I know you've always wanted one. I want you to be happy about this.",
        "Liberty: Are you happy, Uncle Jack?",
        "Jack: Well, like your mother says, any new life is cause for celebration.",
        "Liberty: You've been unusually quiet. What do you think?",
        "Dusty: I think this is between your mother and Jack.",
        "Liberty: I know you must have an opinion, Dusty. You always do.",
        "Dusty: Well, if this kid turns out anything like you, the world's got another winner.",
        "Jack: I'm gonna call the insurance company, make sure we're all set for another round of treatments.",
        "Dusty: I got it.",
        "Jack: Its okay, Dusty. I'm on it.",
        "Liberty: I don't care what Uncle Jack says. He's not happy about this kid.",
        "Janet: No. He's just worried about you, like we all are.",
        "Liberty: It's not fair. You've done enough already. Your life shouldn't have to revolve around me anymore.",
        "Janet: Honey, you are my life.",
        "Liberty: Some life.",
        "Janet: It's perfect, and it has been since the day you were born.",
        "Liberty: We both know that's not true.",
        "Janet: You give me a reason to get up in the morning. And you're the only person in my life who has never let me down.",
        "Liberty: Because of me, you're having a baby you don't really want with a man you don't love anymore. What do you call that?",
        "Dusty: Why don't you take a break, give Liberty and me a few minutes alone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Do you remember how Janet was thinking about having a baby so there'd be a possible bone-marrow match if the treatments failed?",
        "Parker: Liberty told Dad that she was completely against it. But Janet's pregnant, isn't she?",
        "Carly: Yeah. And now there's no guarantee that this baby would even be a match.",
        "Parker: This is good. This means that there's hope. In case the radiation treatments don't work, there's something else that might.",
        "Carly: Parker, did you hear what I said? There's no guarantee.",
        "Parker: I know, I know, and she may refuse the transplant.",
        "Carly: Let's just think positive, okay?",
        "Parker: Okay. But I do have a question. What about you and Dad? What does this baby mean for the two of you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Barbara, Barbara, wait.",
        "Barbara: Henry, go back to the hotel. Vienna is waiting for you.",
        "Henry: I had no idea she was gonna be there. This is all Katie's doing. It was a complete surprise.",
        "Barbara: To me, too.",
        "Henry: Listen. Listen to me. I just -- thank you. Thank you for being so classy. You could have told Vienna about our --",
        "Barbara: Our dalliance.",
        "Henry: It's more than that, and you know it.",
        "Barbara: Well, I thought I did, but apparently I was wrong.",
        "Henry: How can you say that?",
        "Barbara: You know what? It's really okay. You don't have to let me down easy. I understand. I'm a grown-up. Because Vienna is stunning and exotic and beautiful and young, and she obviously loves you very much, so you got your life back. Enjoy it.",
        "Henry: I don't know what kind of guy you think I am, Barbara.",

        "Henry: Damn it.",
        "Barbara: Better answer that. You don't want to give Vienna the wrong idea.",
        "Henry: It's the right --",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Henry: Just hold on, okay? [Sighs] Hello?",
        "Vienna: Henry, where are you? I miss you.",
        "Henry: I'll be right there. It's not what you think.",
        "Barbara: It's exactly what I think, and you know what? It really is okay, because you know what? It was just one of those things, and it's done. You don't owe me a thing. So, let's not ruin it by pretending it was more than it was, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: The whole baby donor thing, it's weird.",
        "Liberty: You think?",
        "Dusty: Wouldn't have been my choice, but it was your mom and Jack's decision.",
        "Liberty: I don't want her ruining her life for me.",
        "Dusty: The only thing that would ruin her life is losing you, and that's not gonna happen. We're all fighting here as hard as we can to see you through this.",
        "Liberty: What if it's not enough? What if I die and then she's stuck with the baby?",
        "Dusty: \"A,\" you're not gonna die. \"B,\" she's gonna love this baby like crazy. You know what a good mother she is.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. But now Jack is gonna be in her life forever. That's not fair. He doesn't love her anymore. She deserves to have someone who really loves her.",
        "Dusty: I'm in love with her. I want her to marry me.",
        "Liberty: Even with the baby?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I'll love the baby like it's my own.",
        "Liberty: Do you really love my mom that much?",
        "Dusty: I do. I kind of gave up on the idea of having a family, you know? But I saw that with your mother, it's possible, and you, if that's all right.",
        "Liberty: Could be kind of cool.",
        "Dusty: We can do this. You, Johnny, your mother, this baby. We can be family. The only thing we got to do is convince your mother its okay to be happy.",
        "Liberty: Mom!",
        "Janet: Yeah, Sweetie? Is everything okay?",
        "Liberty: What's wrong with you? He loves you. Say yes.",
        "Janet: What is this? I leave you two alone for five minutes and he's already trying to win you over to his side?",
        "Liberty: What do you mean, \"Try\"? I'm already there.",
        "Dusty: [Laughs] Sorry. I don't play fair, especially when there's something I want.",
        "Janet: Well, we're gonna have to work on that.",
        "Dusty: Is that a yes?",
        "Janet: Yes. I'll marry you. Yes.",
        "Liberty: Don't let her back out.",
        "Dusty: Not in a million years. Are you ready?",
        "[Janet giggles]",
        "Liberty: Mom, let me see!",
        "Janet: Huh? Whoo!",
        "Liberty: That is a beautiful ring.",
        "Janet: Yeah! I didn't mean for you to walk in on --",
        "Jack: On what, exactly?",
        "Janet: Dusty proposed. I should have told you.",
        "Jack: No, it's okay. He already did.",
        "Janet: When?",
        "Jack: It doesn't matter. I'm just glad that you're happy, and if he does that for you --",
        "Janet: He does.",
        "Jack: Good. You deserve it.",
        "Janet: I want you to be happy, too, Jack. I'm sorry that things didn't work out for us.",
        "Jack: Eh, so am I, but this is good. I can tell.",
        "Janet: So, okay. I guess we'll start working on the annulment?",
        "Jack: Yeah. We have to do that or I'll have to arrest you for bigamy.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Dusty: Thanks.",
        "Jack: Congratulations. Take good care of her.",
        "Dusty: I plan to.",
        "Jack: I called the insurance company. As for another round of treatment, everything's okay.",
        "Dusty: I got it. I got it, Jack.",
        "Jack: Right. Okay.",
        "Liberty: Uncle Jack, will you bring Parker to see me before you guys leave? I want to say goodbye.",
        "Jack: Will do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We should make it to the airport in time to catch that last flight back to Oakdale.",
        "Parker: Mom, you didn't answer my question about you and Dad. Does this baby mess things up for you guys?",
        "Carly: We'll be fine. We've been through a lot over the years.",
        "Parker: This is pretty major. I mean, the kid's permanent.",
        "Carly: Yeah, that's true. I'm not gonna say that it's gonna be easy for me, 'cause it's not, but I'll handle it.",
        "Parker: Good.",
        "Carly: Yeah. You see? It's almost like I'm a grown-up now. It's crazy. It's about damn time, right? [Laughs]",
        "Parker: But seriously, you're okay with raising this baby as your stepchild?",
        "Carly: I can tell you that I'm okay with helping Jack and Janet raise this child, this child that I hope will help Liberty, which, in turn, will help you, my wonderful son. So, you see, it's all connected.",
        "Parker: Maybe you are actually growing up, which is a relief, since I've been raising you for so long.",
        "Carly: Yeah. You did a so-so job, too.",
        "Parker: Well, thank you.",
        "Carly: Hey, you know I love your father very, very much. It's -- it's taken a lot for us to get back to where we are here. So, I'm not gonna let anything get in the way ever again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Oh. Well, I see the thrill is gone. Boy, that didn't take long.",
        "Barbara: It's just that when I first tried this on, I thought maybe it was a little too young for me. Then I got home, put it on again, realized I should have gone with my first instinct.",
        "Lisa: You know, Honey, you know a woman never buys a dress like this for herself.",
        "Barbara: On the contrary, Lisa. Modern women dress to please themselves. We don't have to dress for the man anymore.",
        "Lisa: Oh, all right. Who do you think you're trying to fool?",
        "Barbara: No one. Not anymore.",
        "Lisa: Oh, Honey, I'm sorry it didn't work.",
        "Barbara: I have a very busy day. So, if I could just, you know, get a store credit or something --",
        "Lisa: Well, all right. I'll give you a store credit if you like.",
        "Barbara: No problem.",
        "Lisa: And then if you change your mind and want to keep the dress, well -- well, you know, men have been known to change their minds.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Barbara: This has nothing to do with a man and everything to do with a very wrong spontaneous purchase.",
        "Lisa: I see. Well, I think you're trying to be very coy, and believe me, nothing happens in this town -- nothing, that I don't know about.",
        "Barbara: Kim told you. Oh, boy. I bet you two had a real -- real laugh, didn't you, thinking, \"Oh, look how foolish she is, running around with that young Henry.\"",
        "Lisa: Henry? Henry Coleman?",
        "Barbara: So you didn't know?",
        "Lisa: Uh, no. Not until you just told me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Wow.",
        "Vienna: Lose something?",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Vienna: The wine.",
        "Henry: The wine? Yes. Uh, the wine. Yeah. They didn't -- they didn't have the right vintage.",
        "Vienna: Out of all the bottles they have downstairs, you couldn't find one you liked?",
        "Henry: Well, you know, I wanted something special. Uh, you know, nothing's too good for my Liebchen.",
        "Vienna: Well, in that case, you can give me the match for this. Real diamonds. I know that.",
        "Henry: It's -- it's not -- it's not what you think.",
        "Vienna: Really? Because I know it's not yours, and Geneva Swift, she wore paste.",
        "Henry: Look, Vienna --",
        "Vienna: Okay, Henry, stop. I really don't want to know.",
        "Henry: You don't?",
        "Vienna: No. We've been apart, and Barbara was right. There was no reason for you to think that I was coming back. So, it was your right to play the field, and trust me, Henry, I really did try to forget you. I threw myself into the task. I met dozens of super-sexy, hot, handsome millionaires.",
        "Henry: Dozens?",
        "Vienna: Dozens. Oh, yeah, at least. But none of them could hold a candle to you.",
        "Henry: What size candle are we talking here? A taper? Pillar? Votive?",
        "Vienna: Oh, who cares? What's important is the flame.",
        "Henry: Is that a polite way of saying that I'm --",
        "Vienna: Don't speak. Shh.",
        "Henry: Yeah, but it's been a while. Don't you think we should at least talk about this?",
        "Vienna: Shut up. Shut up. Don't forget Mrs. Collier. I won't. What's wrong?",
        "Henry: Nothing. Nothing. It's just that this -- this is so sudden, and I thought you were gone forever, and then the elevator doors opened. There you were.",
        "Vienna: Here I am.",
        "Henry: Yes, and a lot has happened in that time. I'm not the same guy that I was.",
        "Vienna: I know you're not. The old Henry would never have donated his entire fortune to the hospital. He would have tried to keep it for himself. But you're not. You are giving it away. You're building a new wing.",
        "Henry: About that.",
        "Vienna: You know what? That shows how far you've come. I would never have come back for the old Henry. You know, for him, the money meant more than I did.",
        "Henry: That's -- that's not true. I just wanted the money to give you the life that you deserve.",
        "Vienna: But don't you get it? I don't need, like, special vintage or diamonds or millions of dollars in the bank. Those things just doesn't mean that much to me as you do. You know, from now on, I just -- I want to follow my heart.",
        "Henry: I want to follow my heart, too, and it's telling me that we need to toast. We need to toast to our reunion.",
        "Vienna: So, where are you going?",
        "Henry: I am going to the wine cellar, and I am going to be back before you miss me. Mwah! Come on, Barbara. Please pick up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lisa: Aren't you gonna answer it? Look, Darling, it may be Henry. Maybe he's calling to apologize or something, and maybe you'll keep the dress after all.",
        "Barbara: I don't think so, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: Why not?",
        "Barbara: Lisa, please. I saw your face before. You could barely keep yourself from bursting out loud in laughter. I mean, I don't blame you for that. The idea of Henry Coleman and me together is rather ludicrous.",
        "Lisa: No, no. That is not true. It's just -- I was startled when you told me. That's all. And, well, I hope you had fun with him. I mean, you seemed to enjoy yourself, right?",
        "Barbara: It was nice being with someone. Yes, I will admit that.",
        "Lisa: Well, Henry was a -- he was unexpected, and there's nothing wrong with that. Now, you know -- you know we both believe that love, sex, airplanes -- if it flies, Baby, it flies, huh? So, uh, I've noticed a little spring in your step recently.",
        "Barbara: Just write down the store credit, okay? Thanks.",
        "Lisa: At least it was fun, wasn't it?",
        "Barbara: It was fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Henry: What's going on?",
        "Vienna: Good afternoon, Mr. Big, powerful, hedge-fund manager. I am your new secretary, and I am here to take dic-tation.",
        "Henry: I thought you wanted to drink wine and talk about my newfound virtue.",
        "Vienna: Oops. Let me pick that up.",
        "Henry: No, no.",
        "[Vienna laughing]",
        "Henry: Stop it.",
        "Vienna: Oh, but, Mr. Coleman, you are my boss!",
        "Henry: Vienna, no. I mean it. I mean it. No.",
        "Vienna: Did you just say \"No\" to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay. We're not getting married until your treatment is done and you're well enough to dance at the wedding.",
        "Liberty: I just hope I have some hair by then.",
        "Dusty: I have no problem with bald women.",
        "Janet: I'm not quite sure how to respond to that.",
        "Dusty: You can say you have no problem with bald men.",
        "Janet: You don't have anything to worry about, Donovan.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, lucky you, marrying into the Ciccone family. Not only do you get to raise another man's baby, but you get a big, fat, pregnant bride and a bald stepdaughter. Good times.",
        "Janet: Liberty, don't.",
        "Liberty: I think it's hysterical, Mom. Dusty doesn't seem to mind.",
        "Dusty: Are you kidding me? I'm the luckiest guy I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You ready to go?",
        "Parker: Actually, I'd like to go say goodbye to Liberty. Could you guys pick me up on the way to the airport?",
        "Both: Sure.",
        "Parker: Great.",
        "Carly: We'll see you soon.",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Carly: So, how did Liberty take the news about the baby?",
        "Jack: She was angry, till she saw the ring. Then she was okay with it.",
        "Carly: What ring?",
        "Jack: Dusty proposed, and Janet said yes.",
        "Carly: Hey! Well, that's great, Jack. You were worried about Janet being alone. Now she certainly won't be alone, will she?",
        "Jack: No, it's not that. I'm glad that she's -- I'm glad that she's happy. I just don't know how I feel about Donovan raising my kid.",
        "Carly: Well, if I can handle you having a baby with another woman, you can handle this.",
        "Jack: You think so?",
        "Carly: Yes. Dusty won't be that child's father more than you. The baby will still be yours. So will I.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Chris: Do you really think I'm hot? Alison. Probably didn't see us.",
        "Luke: I need more from you, and if you can't give me that, I can't do this anymore.",
        "Vienna: Is something wrong?",
        "Barbara: What are you doing?",
        "Henry: We have unfinished business. Uh, we didn't think this was going to work, right, Honey?"
