        "Noah asks Luke to move in with him for the summer. Noah and Luke meet with their potential landlord, but it is clear once he realizes they are gay, the apartment no longer becomes available. They are outraged, as Luke vows to not let the man get away with it. Dusty is taking Meg on their official date to a new restaurant in Chicago, as Meg is thrilled and Dusty wants her to wear the new dress he bought her. Holden and Meg argue about her relationship with Dusty, as he thinks she should take time after her break up with Paul before jumping into another bad relationship. Paul is happily babysitting for Eliza since Meg has plans with Dusty he begrudgingly admits, as he pleads with Emily to find out what is going on between Lucy and Craig; he wants to protect Meg because he is convinced Lucy and Dusty are working together to bring down Craig and Meg could get hurt. Craig misplaces his file (or so he thinks) for the shipping company he plans on doing business with, as Craig wonders if Lucy knows where it is. Lucy pretends to help and when his head is turned, she takes it out from her purse. She plays it off well, as Lucy later talks to someone about making copies from the file and meeting with someone from the shipping company. Meg cancels her plans with Dusty thinking she is rushing things, as Dusty is upset. Lily talks with Dusty about Meg and poses some questions for him to consider. Meg sees Paul lovingly talking to Eliza, as she arrives to pick her up. Paul is pleased to learn Meg is no longer going out with Dusty. He is tickled to learn nothing has gone on and it doesn't look like it will be either, but Meg assures him that changes nothing about them. Meg allows Paul to spend extra time with Eliza, as Paul warmly thanks her. Emily tries to get information out of Craig pretending to be interested in his vodka company, but Craig isn't really biting. Lucy meets with a man from the shipping company that is now working for Craig and pays him to ship some stuff in addition to what Craig ships without anyone's knowledge. The man thanks her and their mutual friend for their business. When Lucy comes back to play the dutiful daughter, she puts the kibosh on anymore questions from Emily to her dad, as Craig follows her leads, which convinces Emily more then ever, that Lucy is hiding something. Holden worries about Meg, but Lily tells him that Meg cancelled her plans with Dusty. Holden is later not pleased to hear Lily offer Dusty advice about Meg, as they agree in the end to no longer get involved. Luke and Noah tell Holden and Lily about the landlord, as Lily thinks they should get this issue out there with help from the Foundation. Holden is surprised to learn Lily is working with Luke, but is happy because Luke seems himself again finally. Luke and Noah blissfully work together to research how to stop discrimination against gays in housing and to find a new place to live. Emily comes to Paul with her beliefs about Lucy, but Paul is no longer interested because he is focused on the fact that Meg is not seeing Dusty anymore. Emily tells him that she won't back down from this story because Paul is seeing stars in his eyes now. Dusty sees Meg returning his clothes that he bought her, as she explains that their relationship is moving too fast and that she isn't sure what is happening between then is even real, as Dusty takes her into his arms and passionately kisses her to prove her wrong. Lucy wants Craig to stay away from Emily's questions for his own good, as she wants to prove her loyalty and trust \u0096according to her. After she leaves, Craig mumbles to himself about how he wishes he could trust her, as he looks unsure. Lucy makes a phone call assuring the person on the other end that her dad has no idea what she is up to, but Emily could prove to be a problem, but she will handle her."

        "Noah: What're you working on?",
        "Luke: I'm working on some new ideas for the foundation for gay rights. I'll show them to my mother later. \"I'll show them to my mother later.\" I work with my mother. I'm such a loser.",
        "Noah: It's great that your parents are supportive.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, it is. My mom came a really long way since I came out. So did my dad. My birth father, not so much.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but the beauty is you can use the Grimaldi money to support gay rights.",
        "Luke: Yeah, and how mad would this make Damian?",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Noah: There's nothing he can do about that, though, right? I mean --",
        "Luke: No, it's my money. I can do whatever I want with it.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm glad that all worked out.",
        "Luke: Yeah. What didn't work out, though, was, uh, last night. That didn't exactly go as we planned.",
        "Noah: I can't believe my roommate came home so early.",
        "Luke: Yeah, he has really bad timing.",
        "Noah: Yeah, dorms aren't exactly known for privacy.",
        "Luke: [Laughs]",
        "Noah: But I think I've got a solution.",
        "Luke: Hmm?",
        "Noah: Why don't you move in with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Baby Eliza's going to sleepy. What a tiny little neck she's got. You get some sleep, okay? Then Mr. Giraffe and I will make you some yummy lunch.",
        "Emily: When do I get the lunch you owe me?",
        "Paul: Will you be quiet? She's sleeping.",
        "Emily: Oh, geez. Oh, you perfect little angel. How'd you get so lucky?",
        "Paul: I have no idea. The best thing that ever happened to me.",
        "Emily: Aww. Meg's been so generous with her visitations. What's up with that?",
        "Paul: I wish I could say it was for my benefit, but today it's 'cause she wanted to spend some time with Dusty.",
        "Emily: You really think those two are an item?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I saw him shopping for clothes. I think he's about ready to make his move.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. What are you gonna do about it?",
        "Paul: I'm gonna do everything I can to keep Dusty away from her. I really still think that Lucy's the key.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you keep saying that, but your logic escapes me.",
        "Paul: You saw Lucy -- dissing Dusty, siding with her dad in public. Everybody knows she hates her father. And then you see her breaking into Craig's room. I still want to get to the bottom of this. Tell me you're on board.",
        "Emily: That depends -- what you want me to do?",
        "Paul: Tail Lucy. I mean, I'd do it myself, but, you know, I'm here with Eliza and it's suited perfectly for you, you know? It's right up your alley. You're great at stalking, 'cause you run that rag of a newspaper.",
        "Emily: Okay, are you -- are you insulting me or are you asking me for help? Because if you're asking me for help, you really ought to be nicer about it.",
        "Paul: Please. Please, my dear friend, Emily, would you be so kind as to assist me in determining what the hell's going on with Lucy Montgomery?",
        "Emily: Very funny. I come here for a free lunch and end up paying the tab? No way. You want to spy on Lucy, do it yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You're late.",
        "Lucy: I had to finish my rounds. Why does it look like a hurricane hit in here?",
        "Craig: I can't find an important file. It's the international shipping contracts from Midnight Sun, and I can't get my company off the ground without those contracts.",
        "Lucy: So, what does that have to do with me?",
        "Craig: Well, aside from Johnny, you're the only other person that's been in here, and I was hoping you might know what happened.",
        "Lucy: I don't -- I don't have a clue.",
        "Craig: Are you sure, Lucy? Or is there something you need to tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Look, just tell Craig that you're doing a series of articles on his vodka business, and you can use that as a cover until you figure out what's really going on with Lucy and with Craig.",
        "Emily: No. Craig's not gonna buy that. He doesn't trust me for a second.",
        "Paul: Don't sell yourself short. You can make anything sound legit. Look, you run a newspaper -- Craig has a business. He needs publicity.",
        "Emily: What do I get out of it?",
        "Paul: Um, my eternal gratitude?",
        "Emily: You really think digging up dirt on Craig and Lucy's gonna help you get Meg back?",
        "Paul: Look, I know it's a long shot, but if Dusty's using Lucy to sandbag Craig, I don't want the fallout to hurt Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So, we're on for our date tonight?",
        "Meg: Absolutely. I told Paul he could babysit.",
        "Dusty: Why Paul? Emma's not available?",
        "Meg: Well, Mama is more than happy to watch Eliza, but I thought giving Paul some time with her might help him to adjust.",
        "Dusty: Adjust to us going out together? I don't think so.",
        "Meg: Look, when Paul saw us together, he had this wounded look, like I was cheating on him. And I thought the best way to diffuse the situation was to give him some time with his daughter.",
        "Dusty: You're not worried that he's gonna take her away again?",
        "Meg: There will be a court-appointed social worker there to supervise. Eliza will be perfectly fine.",
        "Dusty: I hope so. Can I make a request?",
        "Meg: [Sighs] Sure.",
        "Dusty: On our date, no talking about Paul, okay?",
        "Meg: Deal.",
        "Dusty: You gonna wear that dress I bought you?",
        "Meg: Uh, yeah, okay. Um, it's a little dressy, though. Where are you taking me exactly?",
        "Dusty: It's a surprise.",
        "Meg: Don't I get a little hint?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you'll love it.",
        "Meg: Oh, come on, I'm not good with surprises. I need to know what I'm in for, so you need to tell me. Come on. Now.",
        "Dusty: We're going to the opening of Bruno Ferrari's new restaurant in Chicago.",
        "Meg: I love Bruno Ferrari. I watch him on the cooking channel.",
        "Dusty: Not an easy reservation.",
        "Meg: Mama loves his show.",
        "Dusty: Mama's not invited. I only got a table for two.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe I'll bring her home a doggie bag.",
        "Dusty: I got to go to the office and do some more work. I'll pick you up at 5:00?",
        "Meg: Yeah, that sounds good. It'll give me enough time to look beautiful.",
        "Dusty: You're already beautiful.",
        "Meg: Aww, and you're sweet -- for a liar.",
        "Dusty: It's the truth. See you tonight.",
        "Meg: Can't wait.",
        "Holden: [Clears throat]",
        "Meg: Holden.",
        "Holden: Am I interrupting something?",
        "Dusty: No, no, I was just leaving. See you later.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Don't say it.",
        "Holden: Somebody has to. Are you completely out of your mind?",
        "Holden: New dress?",
        "Meg: Dusty is taking me out to dinner in Chicago, and it's none of your business. I'm not changing my mind.",
        "Holden: Did he buy you that?",
        "Meg: Yes, it was a gift.",
        "Holden: Hmm. Did he also buy that big pile of baby clothes in the parlor?",
        "Meg: Yes, he was being very generous, so what?",
        "Holden: Hmm. Seems like such a waste. Lily has a whole trunkful of clothes from Faith and Nat. Unless you have a problem with hand-me-downs.",
        "Meg: Of course not. But there's nothing wrong in buying something new once in a while, is there?",
        "Holden: Well, there might be -- if there are strings attached.",
        "Meg: I let Dusty buy clothes for Eliza because he was missing Johnny. It's been very painful for him.",
        "Holden: He can't use your baby to replace his son.",
        "Meg: He's not doing that. But it doesn't matter what I say about him, because you're always gonna think the worst about him because you can't get over the fact that he slept with Lily. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.",
        "Holden: No, you're right. It's true. He nearly wrecked my marriage. But Lily and I are not the only casualties around here. There was Rose. There was Emily. Meg, he wrecks people's lives and then he walks away. I don't want that to happen to you.",
        "Meg: He's just taking me out to dinner, that's all. He's not gonna propose over dessert.",
        "Holden: How do you know? Tonight sounds like a big production.",
        "Meg: Trust me, I can handle it, okay?",
        "Holden: Will you just forget Dusty for one second. You need to look at yourself. I'm worried about you.",
        "Meg: Why? I'm fine.",
        "Holden: You go from Paul to Dusty without taking a breath. One relationship ends, and a new one has to pick up where the other left off.",
        "Meg: That is not what I'm doing.",
        "Holden: Meg, you need to take a break. You need to take a look at your life, you need to figure out what you need, and most importantly, you need to figure out what -- what your baby needs.",
        "Meg: Eliza will always be my number-one priority, which is exactly why I am taking it so slow with Dusty.",
        "Holden: I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life. I just want you to be careful -- for Eliza's sake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Long-stem roses, white, two dozen. I need them there by 4:00. Thanks.",
        "Lily: Hey.",
        "Dusty: Hey.",
        "Lily: I-I wasn't eavesdropping. I just, um -- well, I wasn't doing it on purpose.",
        "Dusty: What brings you to Worldwide?",
        "Lily: I had to drop off my mother's proxy for the board meeting. Hopefully, she'll be well enough soon to show up in person.",
        "Dusty: I hope so, too. I miss the way she gives everybody a hard time. Tell her I say hi. I hope she feels better.",
        "Lily: I will. Thank you for saying that. You seem like you're in a good mood today.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Lily: Ordering flowers. Who's the lucky girl?",
        "Dusty: Meg.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Dusty: Holden had the same reaction.",
        "Lily: He's very protective of his sister.",
        "Dusty: There's no need to be protective. She's not in danger.",
        "Lily: I'm not taking sides. I'm just saying this as a friend.",
        "Dusty: What? What's this? Oh, great. I can't wait.",
        "Lily: You just lost custody of Johnny. Meg has a new baby. Could that be part of the attraction?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, but that's not why I'm doing this. Meg and I have been hanging out, we decided to go on a date. That's all. See where it takes us.",
        "Lily: What if somebody gets hurt?",
        "Dusty: Nobody's getting hurt. We're going in with our eyes open.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I recall us saying the same thing, and you know how that turned out.",
        "Dusty: This is different.",
        "Lily: Be honest with yourself.",
        "Dusty: I like being around Meg and her kid. I like being around kids. It reminds me of my son, so what?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Hey, Meg, what's up?",
        "Meg: Dusty, hey, um, you know, I've been thinking. This date tonight --it may not be such a good idea.",
        "Dusty: Why? Did Holden change your mind?",
        "Meg: No, it wasn't Holden. It's just -- after everything that happened with Paul, I think I need a little bit more time before rushing into another relationship.",
        "Dusty: Well, there's no rush.",
        "Meg: You know what? I think it's best if we just let it go. I hope you understand.",
        "Dusty: You sure about this?",
        "Meg: Yes, I am. I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: What happened?",
        "Dusty: Meg cancelled.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Dusty: She said she's not ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Meg's moved on.",
        "Paul: Meg and I have a child together. We'll always be tied to each other.",
        "Emily: Yes, that's lovely, so you should focus on your child and stop obsessing on the child's mother.",
        "Paul: Don't you think this is what's best for Eliza -- to have her parents together? You and I -- we both grew up with single moms. We didn't turn out so good, did we?",
        "Emily: Hey, speak for yourself. I like the way I turned out. I've got a life. I've got a job.",
        "Paul: Your circulation's dropping like a rock. You need a hot story.",
        "Emily: Oh my God! \"Designer vodka coming to a liquor store near you?\" Stop the presses! That's a real banner headline. That'll keep them lining up at newsstands, won't it?",
        "Paul: Look, with Craig involved, there's bound to be some shady dealings, right? And you add to the fact that he's teaming up with his estranged daughter, and that's bound to add fuel to the fire. This could be a really hot story, Emily. Come on. Have I ever steered you wrong?",
        "Emily: You're kidding, aren't you?",
        "Paul: Yeah, all right. Well, if you won't do it for me, will you do it for Eliza?",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "Emily: Oh.",
        "Paul: It's okay. Shh, shh, shh. Sorry. Daddy's right here. I'm gonna stay right here till you fall back asleep, I promise. Shh. Don't you worry. Auntie Emily's not gonna disappoint us this time. She's not gonna let us down, I promise.",
        "Emily: All right! I'm gonna regret this, I know it, but fine. I will do it. I will -- dig up dirt on Lucy and Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Why are you avoiding the question?",
        "Lucy: I'm trying to help.",
        "Craig: I can see through you, Lucy. I know you're intrigued by this vodka business I'm starting up with Carly. In fact, you even hinted that you might want to work with me on it. Are you trying to involve yourself in the project somehow?",
        "Lucy: You were the one that shot that idea down. You seemed to think I'd be too busy with my residency at the hospital, even though I'm not on a full rotation yet.",
        "Craig: Well, I honestly didn't believe you'd have enough time.",
        "Lucy: Well, Carly's the one who doesn't have enough time right now with her trouble with Parker. If you need someone to fill in the gaps for a while, I'm here.",
        "Craig: Thank you. I appreciate that. But I'd be in a lot better shape if I could I find that file.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: I have to take this. Montgomery. Uh, yes, we're just pulling together all the information right now. Well, we're almost ready to ship. Yes, we're -- we're getting it together. Well, I appreciate your patience.",
        "[Lucy takes the file out of her purse and takes it to Craig]",
        "Lucy: Is this what you're looking for?",
        "Craig: You know what? Uh, I can fax you the export data right away. Yes, right now. Thank you. Where did you find this?",
        "Lucy: It was under the couch.",
        "Craig: That's impossible. I looked there.",
        "Lucy: No, it was wedged up underneath some cushions. You were so freaked out, you must've missed it.",
        "Craig: I could swear I looked everywhere for this.",
        "Lucy: You finally ready to admit that I'm helpful to have around? You can pay me back over lunch.",
        "Craig: Fine. Go downstairs, get us a table. I'm gonna fax these and I'll be right there.",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Are you serious about this? You really want to move in together?",
        "Noah: Well, I have to move out in a few months anyway when the semester's over. I just figure we could try living together this summer, you know, sublet and see how it goes.",
        "Luke: That's amazing. I thought I'd have to wait years for you to come around.",
        "Noah: Well, maybe I'm not as logical as you thought I was. Maybe I can throw caution to the wind every once in a while, too.",
        "Luke: Or maybe you think I'm doing better now. You know, I'm getting my life back together and I'm working for the foundation. Maybe you think I'm ready to take on something else, like, uh, living with you.",
        "Noah: You know, I hadn't thought about it that way, but now that you mention it, yeah. I think you are ready in a way that you weren't before. So, I made a few calls --",
        "Luke: I cannot wait for our first night in our new apartment together. We can just look around and be like, \"This is ours. This is all ours.\"",
        "Noah: Me too. And it's just gonna be for the summer, though.",
        "Luke: Oh, no, I'm cool with that. I mean, if it turns out you have some weird habits that I don't know about, you know, like if you snore like a buzz saw or if you have some strange hankering deep-dish anchovy every night at 10:00, I am out of there.",
        "Noah: Yep, that's me. Well, if you mess with my classic-film collection, it's gonna be you who's out first, Mister.",
        "Luke: Noah, I have a really, really good feeling about this.",
        "Noah: I'm glad you said yes, because --",
        "Landlord: Noah Mayer?",
        "Noah: Yeah, that's me. Oh, you must be Mr. Reese. The place at Dunbar Road, right? Oh, I talked to a broker, and she said this place became available. And it's got everything we need.",
        "Luke: Yeah? That's awesome.",
        "Noah: Yeah. And, uh, this is Luke Snyder. Luke this is Mr. Reese.",
        "Luke: Nice to meet you.",
        "Noah: We're gonna be sharing the apartment. Luke, this is going to be our new landlord.",
        "Landlord: But it's only a one-bedroom.",
        "Luke: Oh, that's all we need.",
        "Noah: I kind of figured you'd be cool with it, so I filled out all the paperwork. The place is a lot like the one that you found, even right down to the working fireplace.",
        "Luke: Oh, that sounds great.",
        "Noah: I don't think we're gonna have many fires in the middle of the summer, but --",
        "Luke: Who knows? We might stay longer.",
        "Noah: You know, if you want to check it out first --",
        "Luke: No. I'll take your word I mean, if you say it's great --",
        "Noah: I do.",
        "Luke: Well, then that's all I need to hear. So, we can give you any reference you need from this foundation I work for. I know it sounds kind of sketchy, but it's completely legit.",
        "Noah: Yeah, and we can have, you know, the first month's rent check to you immediately.",
        "Landlord: Sorry, the apartment on Dunbar's been rented.",
        "Noah: What do you mean it's been rented? I just talked to the broker this morning. She said it's available. It can't be rented.",
        "Landlord: Sorry, boys. Better luck next time.",
        "Noah: I can't believe that. What -- what just happened?",
        "Luke: You know what just happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Yes, of course I put the file back where I found it. My father just thinks he misplaced it. Don't worry, I made copies of all the documents that we're gonna need. And, um, I'm ready to meet with your contact at the shipping company whenever you're ready to set that up. Right now? Today? Wow, you're fast. Okay, I'm on it. I'll be right there.",
        "Craig: All right, I hope you're hungry.",
        "Lucy: That was the hospital. There's an emergency with one of my patients.",
        "Craig: Oh, so you don't have time for lunch now?",
        "Lucy: It shouldn't take long. I'll take care of it and come right back. Can you wait?",
        "Craig: Well, I guess that's the least I can do. You really saved my asinine buttocks when you found that file. I'm still not sure how you saw it and I didn't.",
        "Lucy: X-ray vision.",
        "Craig: Oh.",
        "Lucy: I'm glad to help, though. I'll see you soon.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Lucy: Bye.",
        "Emily: Craig -- just the man I was looking for.",
        "Craig: Uh, if you don't mind --",
        "Emily: Mind if I join you?",

        "Emily: It'll only take a minute, and I promise there's a big payoff in it for you.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, I can't wait to hear this.",
        "Emily: I have a business proposition for you.",
        "Craig: Really? Well, my business is private, and there's no way I'm gonna let you stick your muckraking nose into it.",
        "Emily: Can't you at least hear me out?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I wanted to say goodbye. Are you okay?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah. Just swamped, you know? Good thing I didn't go to Chicago.",
        "Lily: Dusty, I know you're upset about Meg canceling.",
        "Dusty: If that's what she wants --",
        "Lily: All right, look, this may be none of my business, but I think there's some things that you need to figure out.",
        "Dusty: Like what?",
        "Lily: Well, if you think that you and Meg have a future fine. But if you're just doing this to fill some void in your life by bonding with Meg's baby --",
        "Dusty: Why do you keep going there? I know her baby's not a substitute for Johnny. I get it. Believe me.",
        "Lily: All right, take the baby out of the equation. Let's concentrate on Meg.",
        "Dusty: Meg and I go back a long way.",
        "Lily: We go back even further, and it turns out we're better off being friends.",
        "Dusty: You're saying Meg and I should just be buddies?",
        "Lily: I don't know. Sometimes the hardest thing in the world is admitting your true feelings.",
        "Dusty: I don't have feelings. You know that.",
        "Lily: Then it's gonna be a thousand times harder for you. Is this is the real deal? Is Meg the one that can make you happy? Can you make her happy? Do you see the two of you making it for the long haul? If you can answer those questions honestly, then you'll do what's right for you -- and for Meg.",

        "Paul: I will always keep you safe and warm. And Daddy will always protect you. And I love you. Sweet dreams.",
        "Meg: Hey, Paul.",
        "Paul: Meg, you're like 10 hours early.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know. My plans changed, so I'm here to pick up Eliza.",
        "Paul: Uh, she's sleeping.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I can see that. She obviously feels at home here.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I was kind of hoping you'd let her stay for more than just a few hours this time. You know, that would be kind of a first for us.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, but I'm not going out, after all.",
        "Paul: Not going out, like not going out with Dusty not going out? Sorry. Does that fall under the category of none of my business?",
        "Meg: Yeah, that's right.",
        "Paul: It's just, uh, when I saw him buying you clothes, I figured things were getting serious.",
        "Meg: Well, you figured wrong. Don't gloat, Paul, and don't start popping champagne. This changes nothing between us.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, so was it, uh, your idea to break the date or was it Dusty's idea?",
        "Meg: I thought it was for the best for now.",
        "Paul: Well, it's certainly best for Eliza, I'll tell you that.",
        "Meg: Really? In what way?",
        "Paul: Well, I don't think it's a good idea for her to start thinking that she's got two daddies. I think it's best that she bond with just me right now.",
        "Meg: Oh. Maybe.",
        "Paul: I'm really glad you decided to take a step back. I was worried you were getting in over your head with Dusty.",
        "Meg: Nothing happened between me and Dusty, if that's what you're saying. Our relationship never got a chance to get off the ground, and now, it probably never will.",
        "Paul: Great. So there's still hope for us.",
        "Meg: There is no us, Paul, not anymore. And if you refuse to see that, then I really don't --",
        "Paul: There's still hope for Eliza and I, though, right? I love her more every time I see her. Please, I don't ever want to lose her.",
        "Meg: You won't lose her, Paul.",
        "Paul: Thanks. Thanks for saying that.",
        "Meg: Okay, tell you what -- I will let Eliza stay here with you today, just like we agreed.",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: You mean that?",
        "Meg: Yes, yes, yes. Just have her back at the farm by dinner time.",
        "Paul: I will. I promise, I will.",
        "Meg: Okay. Bye, my angel.",
        "Paul: Hey, Meg -- thanks for everything.",

        "Emily: I promise I will keep the story clean and legit. In fact, I won't even mention your -- criminal record.",
        "Craig: I was cleared of all charges. Otherwise, I wouldn't have custody of Johnny.",
        "Emily: Well, bully for you. How's that going, anyway?",
        "Craig: None of your business.",
        "Emily: Keep doing the daddy dance until you get it right, huh? If at first you don't succeed --",
        "Craig: I'm concentrating on being a father and a good role model to my son.",
        "Emily: Well, that's admirable. But you have a daughter, as well, am I right? Or have you disowned Lucy for kidnapping her little brother?",
        "Craig: Off the record, I'm happy to say Lucy and I are in a much better place.",
        "Emily: Good for you. Good for you. So, any chance Lucy might be part of this new business venture of yours?",
        "Craig: Lucy's a physician. Why would she be interested in selling booze?",
        "Emily: I don't know. I just thought maybe she'd want to follow in her daddy's footsteps.",

        "Lucy: You work for the Sea Bright line? Our mutual friend says that you're shipping Midnight Sun.",
        "Cesar: That's right. We just signed the contract.",
        "Lucy: And how much extra space can you give us in with that vodka shipment?",
        "Cesar: There's room for any extra cargo you need to ship.",
        "Lucy: And none of that cargo will show up on the bill of loading?",
        "Cesar: Don't worry. I'll make sure nobody knows what's in there.",
        "Lucy: Excellent. Here's the payment for the first shipment.",
        "Cesar: Pleasure doing business with you and our mutual friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: See? The law is very clear. Illinois bans discrimination against gays and lesbians in housing and public accommodations. So what that landlord did to us was illegal.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but how do we prove it? I mean, if he said the place was already rented.",
        "Luke: Well, he was lying.",
        "Noah: Obviously, but it's his word against ours, and that won't hold up in court.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well we have to do something. Maybe we can get, like, an investigation against him or something.",
        "Tyler: Are you guys talking about that landlord, Sam Reese?",
        "Luke: Yeah, you know him, Tyler?",
        "Tyler: Major homophobe. He profiles his tenants and never rents to gays. The same thing happened to me and my boyfriend.",
        "Luke: Well, we can't let him get away with this!",
        "Noah: Let's just forget him. Let's find another apartment.",
        "Tyler: Do you want the name of a broker who's a little bit more gay-friendly?",
        "Noah: Yeah. Thanks, Tyler.",
        "Tyler: No problem.",
        "Noah: See? Why don't we just check her website, see if she's got anything, you know, available in our price range.",
        "Luke: Noah, we can't let this landlord get away with breaking the law.",
        "Noah: He's a jerk, Luke, I agree, but he didn't say anything incriminating, so what are we supposed to do about it?",
        "Luke: Well, I'm not just gonna sit here and take it. Come on.",
        "Noah: Where you going?",
        "Luke: I don't know, but we have to find some way to make this right.",

        "Holden: I try to tell Meg not to get involved with Dusty, but she just tunes me out.",
        "Lily: Oh, not this time. She cancelled their date.",
        "Holden: She did?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holden: How do you know that?",
        "Lily: I saw Dusty at Worldwide. I --I was doing an errand for my mother. I mean, running into him was just a coincidence.",
        "Holden: I'm not accusing you of anything.",
        "Lily: I --I know that, but -- I still kind of feel sorry for Dusty.",
        "Holden: Why?",
        "Lily: Well, I was there when Meg called and cancelled. He wasn't happy.",
        "Holden: He'll get over it.",
        "Lily: I'm not so sure.",
        "Holden: What exactly did you say to Dusty about Meg?",
        "Lily: I said it would be wrong for him to jump into anything unless he's really sure that he and Meg can go the distance.",
        "Holden: Good. I hope he takes your advice.",
        "Lily: Well, that's not all I said.",
        "Holden: What else?",
        "Lily: I told Dusty to do some soul-searching, and then if he has serious feelings about Meg, he should let her know.",
        "Holden: Why would you do that? And why couldn't you just leave it alone and stay away from Dusty altogether?",
        "Lily: He's still my friend. Why is it okay for you to give advice, but I can't do the same for an old friend? How is that fair?",
        "Holden: Because Meg is family, and Dusty's --",
        "Lily: My ex-lover. And that still gets to you, doesn't it? Just like your affair with Carly always gets to me. Holden, are we ever gonna get past this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Just one more question, please, off the record, of course. I'm just kind of fuzzy on this one now. You forgave Lucy for kidnapping Johnny because she gave you a free pass for kidnapping her all those years ago, is that how it worked?",
        "Craig: I'm not discussing this with you.",
        "Emily: It's all in the family, isn't it? I mean, for the Montgomery's. Kidnapping -- the gift that keeps on giving.",
        "Craig: That's not funny.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You and Lucy are back on the straight and narrow, right?",
        "Craig: So much for your pledge not to dig up dirt.",
        "Emily: I said it was off the record, Craig, and you said you had nothing to hide. Supposedly, neither does Lucy. At least that's what she's keeps feeding her daddy. You don't really trust her, do you?",
        "Lucy: No wonder my ears have been burning. Is there something you'd like to ask me, Emily?",
        "Emily: I was just trying to interview your father on his new vodka line.",
        "Lucy: And what does that have to do with me?",
        "Emily: Nothing. Nothing. I was just asking how you were doing.",
        "Lucy: My relationship with my father is private.",
        "Emily: Yes, I know. That's what we agreed. Now, back to the new vodka line. How much will you be exporting? Do you project significant sales overseas?",
        "Lucy: Uh, I don't think it's wise for my father to divulge his business plan to you.",
        "Emily: It's a simple question, and it's a big part of the story, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Don't answer it. Anything she says about you is bound to put you in a bad light. It's not worth it.",
        "Craig: You know what, my dear? You're absolutely right. And I've already told Emily that I don't want to be featured in her so-called newspaper. So from now on, my answer is \"No comment.\"",
        "Lucy: Smart move.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Lucy: Any time.",
        "Craig: Well, I did promise to buy my daughter lunch, so if you don't mind, Emily.",
        "Emily: Oh, of course. I wouldn't dream of intruding on a family lovefest.",
        "Craig: Good luck with your shrinking circulation numbers.",
        "Emily: Oh, I'm not worried. The public loves a juicy story, and like you said, I'm good at digging for dirt. Enjoy your lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I was wondering when the two of you were gonna move in together.",
        "Holden: Congratulations. Have you guys started looking for a place?",
        "Noah: We were just getting to that part.",
        "Luke: We hit a roadblock.",
        "Lily: Well, listen, if the rents are too high --",
        "Luke: No, no, it's not that. Noah found an amazing apartment.",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "Luke: But the landlord just won't rent it to us.",
        "Holden: How come?",
        "Noah: 'Cause we're gay.",
        "Luke: The guy's a total creep. He's done this before.",
        "Lily: That's horrible.",
        "Luke: And illegal.",
        "Holden: He can't get away with that.",
        "Luke: That's what I said.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but what are we supposed to do about it? I mean, he said he rented it to somebody else. Of course, that's a lie, but we got no way to prove it. It's just our word against his.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but we're totally right and he's totally wrong. There has to be a way that we can get the message across to this landlord and other like him that what he's doing is completely illegal and won't be tolerated.",
        "Noah: I know, but what are we supposed to do?",
        "Luke: I don't know. Um, stage a protest, something.",
        "Lily: I have an idea. Why don't we go public with the issue as a project for Luke's foundation? I mean, now that I've taken over as administrator, I'd be more than willing to help you on it.",
        "Luke: Seriously?",
        "Lily: Sure. Why not?",
        "Holden: Time-out, time-out. You're running the foundation? When did this happen?",
        "Lily: Just the other day. I didn't get a chance to tell you. Luke, you said that you wanted to focus more on gay rights. I mean, this is obviously a critical issue. What do you think?",
        "Luke: I think it's an awesome idea. I mean, it sounds great to me. Yeah, so, how about this? How about Noah and I go do some research and, uh, we'll get back to you with what we have.",
        "Lily: Sounds good. And listen, if you need help with the apartment, just let us know.",
        "Luke: Oh, thanks, Mom. You're the best.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: Nothing. I think it's great that you're the foundation, but why was I the last to know?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Paul? Paul, you were right. I definitely think Lucy is up to something.",
        "Paul: Your timing is terrible.",
        "Emily: She had that look. Are you listening to what I'm saying to you?",
        "Paul: No, I'm trying not to.",
        "Emily: No, listen to what I'm saying to you. She got all bent out of shape when I asked Craig about the global market for the new vodka. Would you stop? Something is going on. She is hiding something.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't care. As far as I'm concerned, you can drop the whole thing.",
        "Emily: What?! What the heck are you talking about? This was your idea. There's a juicy story here.",
        "Paul: Now who's not listening? I don't care. I don't care about Lucy. I don't care about Craig. I don't care about international vodka shipments, none of it.",
        "Emily: You don't care? What the hell is going on? Why the sudden change of heart?",
        "Paul: Meg dumped Dusty. The future is looking up. There's finally hope, and not just for me, but for Eliza, too. 'Cause it won't be long before her mommy and I are together again. What do you think of that, beautiful?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I didn't buy these myself. They were a gift, but I can't use them. Oh, and this -- I took the tags off the dress, but I never wore it. So, I'd like to return them, please. If you could credit Dusty Donovan's account.",
        "Dusty: Don't I get a say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden? Are you still mad at me for not telling you about the new job?",
        "Holden: No. I don't think you kept me out of the loop on purpose.",
        "Lily: It must be Dusty then, because something is bothering you.",
        "Holden: You know what? Dusty will always be a sore subject, but at least Meg is keeping her distance. I think you and me need to do the same. The last thing I want is for him to come between us again.",
        "Lily: I completely agree.",
        "Holden: So, we're good, right? You know what? I am proud of you.",
        "Lily: You are? Why?",
        "Holden: Yeah, you're working with Luke. It's for an important cause.",
        "Lily: I'm pretty happy about it.",
        "Holden: You should be. He's happy, too. Seems like himself again. He's motivated.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I want to do everything I can to keep that going.",
        "Holden: Me too. I'll help out whenever I can.",
        "Lily: You will? I might take you up on that. You know, this fight isn't gonna be easy.",
        "Holden: It won't, but you can do it. Just go out there and give them hell, take no prisoners.",
        "Lily: With you, I feel like I can do anything.",
        "Holden: I know you can. I know that for a fact.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Look at how many states still don't have laws banning discriminating against gays and lesbians in housing and employment.",
        "Noah: You really think you can change all that?",
        "Luke: Well, you know, maybe we can try. At least we can get the issue some visibility. Maybe we can start petitioning online, pressuring politicians to try and do the right thing. What? What? Do you think I'm too charged up about all this?",
        "Noah: I think we probably have to monitor your caffeine intake, but no. I like you when you're all charged up.",
        "Luke: Well, how about this -- how about I keep doing research, and you find us an apartment.",
