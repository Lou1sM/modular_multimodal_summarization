When Allison leaves the table, Matt almost pours a white powdery substance in Allison's coffee but seems to be having some pangs of guilt. Gray pretends to be gracious in his loss of Vienna to Henry. He sets it up so Henry and Vienna think that the other one wants to meet at Luther's Corners.

Cole is met with anger and skepticism about his newfound love for Hallie. Sophie agrees to talk with him, but then tells him that she wants him out of her life, but Cole pretends out of the goodness of his heart, that he will give her space. Cole is on the phone with someone secretly talking about a plan. Sophie learns Cole has taken Hallie and freaks out. Matt tells Allison that he and Gray are no good and warns her that she needs to tell Casey and his family to watch out for themselves.

        "Sofie: I can't believe you're here, Cole.",
        "Cole: Why not? You called me. You told me the baby was sick and you needed me. Of course, I'm here.",
        "Gwen: Well, you're a little too late. We've already taken care of everything.",
        "Will: Why don't you go back where you came from? Cause we don't need your help.",
        "Cole: Look, I know I was a real jerk before. But I've had a lot of time to think about it. I've grown up a lot, Sofie. I want you to know that. I'm the baby's father, and I realize that I need to be more responsible. So, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: Do you see anything that might help you find your wallet?",
        "Carly: No. Not a thing. There's absolutely nothing here that's going to give me any answers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly and I -- right now we're devoting ourselves completely to Parker. We have to come up with something, anything, to help him beat the murder charge he's facing.",
        "Katie: I know that.",
        "Jack: So, I'm going to do everything I can to help them through this. If that means I have to spend every waking moment with Carly, that's what I'm going to have to do.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Jack: But this crisis isn't going to last forever, Katie.",
        "Katie: I hope not.",
        "Jack: In fact, I hope it's over soon. I'm hoping that Carly comes through that door with the information to clear Parker's name. And when that happens, everything changes.",
        "Katie: What are you saying?",
        "Jack: That things are going to be different with Carly after that.",
        "Katie: Are you telling me that you're ready to walk away from Carly for good?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Thank you for trying, anyway.",
        "Guard: I'm just sorry I couldn't help. I hope you didn't lose too much money.",
        "Carly: It's not the money.",
        "Guard: Yeah. I know, it's the credit cards and the photos, right?",
        "Carly: You're very sweet. Thank you.",
        "Guard: Hey, could you put that back for me?",
        "Assistant: Sure.",
        "Guard: In the right order this time. March, the 6th, it's a Thursday.",
        "Carly: No, wait, wait. No. No, that's not the day I was here. It was the seventh. Friday, the 7th. I've been looking at the wrong tape!",
        "Guard: Put that back and pull the one next to it. The 7th, it's a Friday.",
        "Assistant: Okay.",
        "Carly: Thank you, thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Hey, I bumped into Casey. He told me you'd be here. Do you have time for a coffee?",
        "Alison: Sure. Yeah, I'm on a break.",
        "Matt: Okay, great.",
        "Alison: I've been wanting to talk to you.",
        "Matt: Yeah. You know, there's a couple things I need to say to you, too.",
        "Alison: You do?",
        "Matt: Yeah, but you go first.",
        "Alison: Okay. Look, I know I have been asking you a lot of questions. And I'm sure you must see me as the nosy type.",
        "Matt: Think?",
        "Alison: Fair enough. But I realized that it has more to do with me than you. About me doubting my own feelings.",
        "Matt: What do you mean?",
        "Alison: What I mean is -- that I think I'm ready to stop putting up walls. I guess I'm ready to go a little further. Take a chance. See what happens between us.",
        "Matt: Seriously?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: Well, well, well. What a surprise.",
        "Vienna: Hello, Gray.",
        "Gray: I thought you had said good-bye to me forever.",
        "Vienna: I did.",
        "Gray: Now you're here to say hello?",
        "Vienna: I forgot something. I have to say good-bye to these, too.",
        "Gray: They're yours. You can keep them.",
        "Vienna: No, I can't. The only way Henry will take me back is if I come back naked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Women.",
        "Henry: You can say that again.",
        "Brad: Women.",
        "Henry: Here's to all the pretty ladies.",
        "Brad: No! No, don't drink to them. They don't deserve it.",
        "Henry: No, you're right. They don't deserve it.",
        "Brad: Okay, you know how you go into a wine store, and you think you know what you want, but it turns out you don't know anything about wine. You're just buying a fancy label. And then you find out that the wine wasn't worth what you paid for it?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know. It's like when you go to a wine tasting, right? And you have this great wine, and say this is great, I'm going to buy a whole case of this. You get home, it's not as good as you thought, it's not what you thought you were getting. It's not what you thought you wanted.",
        "Brad: Women, they don't know what they want.",
        "Henry: No, they don't.",
        "Brad: They think they do. But they don't.",
        "Henry: Yeah, who needs them?",
        "Brad: We don't!",
        "Concierge: This was left for you, Mr. Coleman.",
        "Henry: Oh, thank you.",
        "Concierge: My pleasure.",
        "Henry: It's a letter from Vienna.",
        "Brad: Forget her.",
        "Henry: She wants me to meet her at the church. I got to go.",
        "Brad: Wait, wait, wait. What were we just saying? Huh? Did you forget already? Women. Who needs 'em?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm not going to make any promises. I've done that before -- too many times. I think.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I hear you.",
        "Jack: But when this crisis is over, you and I might have another shot. I'm not going to make any guarantees. And it would be unfair to ask you to wait for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Stop, there! Stop! Can you rewind that a little bit? Okay, slower, slower. This -- play this again.",
        "Guard: From the beginning?",
        "Carly: Just that last bit.",
        "Guard: Is that --",
        "Carly: There, there. Right there, that woman there. Could you get a still photo of her? I need a picture of her.",
        "Guard: Yeah, yeah. No problem. Is this what you were looking for?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yes, I think this may be exactly what I need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I never expected to hear you say that there might still be a chance.",
        "Jack: Well, I know that Parker's going to get vindicated, and when that happens, I'm going to get my life back.",
        "Katie: I try not to think of you. But I do. All the time. I can't help it.",
        "Jack: That's good to hear.",
        "Katie: I just never let myself hope that we might have a future together.",
        "Jack: Well, I wish I could give you some assurances, I just can't.",
        "Katie: I know that.",
        "Jack: It is nice to hear, though that you're not writing me off completely.",
        "Katie: No, I couldn't do that. I tried, it doesn't work.",
        "Jack: Come here.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Jack: What is it, Carly?",
        "Carly: I think I have a lead. A good one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You know, drop the act, Cole. I mean, what are you doing here? Nobody's going to believe you're suddenly a caring father.",
        "Cole: I don't blame you for not trusting me.",
        "Gwen: Good. Because nobody does.",
        "Cole: Once I got your message about the baby being sick -- I don't know -- it shook me up.",
        "Gwen: Oh come on, give us a break. Why are you really here?",
        "Cole: I want to stay. At least until I know the baby's going to be okay.",
        "Doctor: Good news for Hallie's mother. The transfusion was a success. According to all tests, your baby's going to be fine.",
        "Sofie: Oh, thank you. Thank you for everything.",
        "Doctor: I'm sorry. I have to take this. The nurse will fill you and answer any questions.",
        "Cole: Why is she calling you the mother? Mom told me you gave the baby to Gwen. What's going on here? Whose baby is this, anyway?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Matt: Oh, no, no, no, no. You didn't. You know that I like you. I just -- I have to ask -- what made you change your mind, though?",
        "Alison: It wasn't anything specific. Just instinct. You and I have a lot of chemistry. And I'd like to see where that can go. If you're up for it, of course.",
        "Matt: You know, I think I need a muffin or something to help me digest this.",
        "Alison: I'll get you one. As a peace offering.",
        "Matt: Yes. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: Are you really sure you want to do this?",
        "Vienna: Yes. Thank you for everything.",
        "Gray: You know, you were meant to wear jewels.",
        "Vienna: No, I was meant to be with Henry. I just hope he'll take me back.",
        "Gray: Don't worry. You and Henry will be together. I'll make sure of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: No, no. No, no. You can not go meet Vienna. All right? That road only leads to heartache. And I am telling you this for your own good.",
        "Henry: She has summoned me, Brad and I must obey.",
        "Brad: Women. Okay? They say they want you. They make you fall in love with them. And then they come up with all sorts of reasons why they can't be with you.",
        "Henry: I don't care. I'm off! She has beckoned me, and I must go.",
        "Brad: Where's your pride, man?",
        "Henry: It's long gone, Brad! It's long gone.",
        "Brad: And your share comes to -- it's all right. You're going to get the next one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What's going on here is none of your business.",
        "Cole: I'm the biological father. I have a right to know.",
        "Sofie: I'll tell you, Cole. I got the baby back. It's not official yet. But I'd made a terrible mistake. And Gwen was good enough to understand.",
        "Cole: They gave the baby back to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This is the still photo from the security camera.",
        "Jack: Outstanding, Carly. This could be the breakthrough we need.",
        "Carly: I think so.",
        "Jack: Well, it's kind of hard to figure out whether this is Kit or not. But it's all we got.",
        "Carly: It's better than nothing, right?",
        "Jack: I know, I've told you this is dangerous. And that you shouldn't get involved. But I need to ask you just one more favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Brad, where are you?",
        "Brad: I'm at the bar. Where are you?",
        "Katie: I'm with Jack.",
        "Brad: That's why I'm at the bar.",
        "Katie: How long have you been there?",
        "Brad: Long enough.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I can tell. Listen, can you grab a cab and meet me at the studio?",
        "Brad: You know, we're done with work for the day. I mean, there is nothing left we have to say to each other.",
        "Katie: Just be there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I don't see how you can possibly have an influence on Henry.",
        "Gray: You'd be surprised.",
        "Vienna: Henry knows better than to trust you.",
        "Gray: Why don't you go freshen up? I know you want to look perfect for Henry.",
        "Vienna: Thank you. You know, I was hoping that this would happen. You make as good a friend as a lover.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Matt: Yeah.",
        "Gray: You all set?",
        "Matt: Yeah, but I can't talk right now.",
        "Gray: Fine. You know what to do. And I don't want any mistakes. I took what you said about being friends to heart.",
        "Vienna: Thank you. That makes me so happy. So, how do I look?",
        "Gray: You look perfect. That was Henry, just now, on the phone.",
        "Vienna: Henry?",
        "Gray: I'm trying to be friends, see? I called him and I told him that you were leaving me and that you were going back to him for good.",
        "Vienna: You did what?",
        "Gray: Made his day. He wants you to meet him at the church in Luther's Corners.",
        "Vienna: At the church? Well, that's a good sign. That's a very good sign. Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Ta-da! A peace offering.",
        "Matt: Well, thank you. Thanks a lot.",
        "Alison: Now we can start with a clean slate.",
        "Matt: I appreciate your faith in me.",
        "Alison: I do have faith in you.",
        "Matt: Um, but it's -- it's misplaced. Look, in order for us to start out with a clean slate, I need to come clean with you. You were right the first time. I am no good and neither is Gray Gerard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry I'm late.",
        "Barbara: Oh, it's okay. I just got here a little bit ago -- ordered you an iced tea.",
        "Kim: Oh, fabulous. Thank you, thank you. Just what I needed.",
        "Barbara: Rough day?",
        "Kim: You betcha. I don't know why I ever thought running a television station was going to be fun.",
        "Barbara: Uh-oh, what happened?",
        "Kim: Well, we just lost our largest advertiser, that's all. However, I know you did not call me for me to bend your ear about ad revenues. So, what's up?",
        "Barbara: Oh, I've just been -- I've been thinking --",
        "Kim: What -- what?",
        "Barbara: Lately, and I -- I've been thinking about Bob. I hear he's doing better.",
        "Kim: Uh, yeah, yeah. You know, we've missed you. Yeah, we're around the corner, you haven't stopped in at all.",
        "Barbara: I know. I just -- I haven't felt very well lately.",
        "Kim: Really? I don't think I like the sound of that.",
        "Barbara: I don't like the sound of it much either.",
        "Kim: What's going on?",
        "Barbara: I have oral cancer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Cole, whatever the situation is with Hallie, it sure as hell doesn't concern you.",
        "Cole: Yes, it does. If the mother of my child is on her own, I want to do the responsible thing and be there for her.",
        "Gwen: And why the sudden turnaround?",
        "Cole: People change, Gwen. Do you believe in second chances, Sofie? When you called, I came here, didn't I? Didn't I?",
        "Sofie: Yes.",
        "Cole: Okay, that means I'm willing to help. Look, we can both get our second chance here. You've got the baby back for us. We can make a go at it again.",
        "Gwen: You can't be buying this, Sofie. I'm sorry, do you not remember what he put you through?",
        "Cole: Mind your own business, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Oh, really? Because it's not your business either. You kind of gave up that right.",
        "Cole: And you gave up your rights when you gave the baby back to Sofie.",
        "Gwen: I did that because it was best for Hallie. What are your motives?",
        "Cole: My motives? I want to help.",
        "Gwen: Oh, come on, don't tell me it's about the joy of fatherhood. Because you don't really seem like the diaper changing type. You have no interest in what's best for Sofie. You just want to do whatever works out best for you.",
        "Cole: I'm the father. What are you doing here? You're not even the baby's mother!",
        "Sofie: Okay, stop it. Stop it, please. Gwen, thank you for supporting me. Thank you for being here for Hallie. You've done so much for me, but I have to do this on my own.",
        "Gwen: Are you going to be okay?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, yeah, just let me handle it. I can do it.",
        "Will: Are you sure?",
        "Sofie: Yes.",
        "Gwen: Let's go see if Dr. Bob is in his office and we'll stay around and we'll check in with you later.",

        "Cole: Yeah, but you're not a single mom. This baby has a father.",
        "Sofie: This baby has a name. It's Hallie. And you gave up your right to be her father.",
        "Cole: You gave up your rights and you've got them back. So can I.",
        "Sofie: Okay, I can't believe you're even trying to compare us after what you did.",

        "Cole: Fine, if that's what you want. I'm not going to force you. A part of starting over is about letting go. So, if that's what you want, I'll go.",
        "Sofie: You need to leave right now.",
