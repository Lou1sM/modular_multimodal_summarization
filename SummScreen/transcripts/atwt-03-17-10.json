        "Emily: You know it's almost Easter? Hey. Fashions. Why -- why don't we buy her an Easter dress?",
        "Paul: You're really taking to this mother thing, aren't you?",
        "Emily: Yeah. You know me. I've always wanted a little girl to dress up.",
        "Paul: Well, now you got one. Yeah, go ahead. Take her to Fashions. I will pick up some books at the bookstore.",
        "Emily: What? You don't want to pick out a little yellow and pink, frilly number for your daughter?",
        "Paul: Want to intrude on, uh, mother/daughter bonding? No, no, no. You have fun.",
        "Emily: Thanks.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Emily: Okay. It's me and you. It's me and you. Here we are. Okay. Whoops. [Gasps] Eliza -- Eliza, look at all these dresses. [Gasps] I think this one. What do you think?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. I -- I don't feel up to going into town. I -- I'm not ready to face the world yet.",
        "Therapist: What is you're afraid of?",
        "Meg: Everything. Seeing people I'm not ready to see, facing things I'm not ready to face.",
        "Therapist: But isn't that part of the healing process?",
        "Meg: Maybe. When the time is right, when I know I'm in control of myself, my impulses. I'm not ready. Not yet.",
        "Therapist: How will you know until you try?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judd: You can keep moving from place to place, but it's not gonna change the fact that you murdered my daughter.",
        "Reid: You think what you like. I have nothing to say to you, Sir.",
        "Judd: You smug bastard.",
        "Luke: What's going on here?",
        "Reid: Nothing that concerns you, Mr. Snyder. Just back off. We're finished here.",
        "Judd: No, we're not! You bastard! [Grunting]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Mother, you're sure you're okay with watching the children while I go get Holden?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, yes, yes, yes. This is the high point of my day. The kids and I will take care of everything. So you just go, go, go, and bring your husband back home again.",
        "Lily: He's not my husband anymore, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: He's more of a husband to you than that other one.",
        "Lily: Can we please not do this now, especially in front of the children?",
        "Lucinda: Fine, Dear. But don't pretend that you're not going to try to repair the relationship with Holden now that the nameless one is out of the picture.",
        "Lily: As usual, you're jumping to conclusions.",
        "Lucinda: We'll see.",
        "Lily: Hey, guys, I'm going to get your daddy. Mother, you guard that cake.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Lily: No little cake monsters eating daddy's cake.",
        "Lucinda: No. It's gonna be safe with us. A lot of work to do! We don't have too much time! Lot to do before your daddy comes home.",
        "Ethan: I want some cake now.",
        "Natalie: No, Ethan. We have to wait for dad.",
        "Lucinda: Right, right. The cake is part of the celebration. Oh, it's gonna be wonderful. Isn't it wonderful to have dad back together, the whole family together again?",
        "Faith: Who says it's getting back together?",
        "Lucinda: Um, Ethan -- and Natalie, I just had a Snyder thought. Why don't you go in your room and see if there are any balloons, so we can blow them up when your dad comes home? All right. What's the matter?",
        "Faith: Nothing. I just don't think we should be lying to Natalie and Ethan.",
        "Lucinda: I wasn't aware that we were.",
        "Faith: Come on, Grandma. You and I both know that this family will never be the same again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Excuse me. Hi. I'm here to pick up Holden Snyder. He, uh, is supposed to be released this afternoon.",
        "Cop: I wish I could help you.",
        "Lily: Is there something wrong? His lawyer assured me that the charges have been dropped and that he'd be released.",
        "Cop: He was, about 20 minutes ago.",
        "Lily: What? He left by himself?",
        "Cop: No. He left with another woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey. What are you doing here? I figured you had better things to do.",
        "Molly: Nope. I canceled all my appointments for the day to be with you.",
        "Holden: Oh. Well, I appreciate that, but you didn't have to do that, because I'm gonna be spending most of the day with my kids. I think they're planning a little welcome home party for me.",
        "Molly: And it would be awkward to bring your girlfriend.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. That's not what I meant. I just don't want you to be uncomfortable.",
        "Molly: I don't want to cause any trouble. Lily's never been very good at hiding her feelings when I'm around.",
        "Holden: Well, you know what? Lily's gonna have to get over it. You and I are together now, and I'm not hiding it from anyone.",
        "Molly: Music to my ears.",
        "Holden: You know what? I was thinking -- how do you feel about moving back to the farm?",
        "Molly: Really?",
        "Holden: Are you okay with that?",
        "Molly: Absolutely.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know what? Look how happy she is. Eliza, show daddy. Which one do you like the best, huh?",
        "Eliza: No.",
        "Emily: Oh, no? You said you liked it before. What do you think?",
        "Paul: I think she's the most beautiful girl in the world. And you both have impeccable taste.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, it's easy for her.",
        "Paul: Sure it is.",
        "Emily: I got an idea. I got an idea. Let's go on a picnic. At the park.",
        "Paul: I think that's a great idea.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Paul: How about you? You think that's a great idea? Want to go on a picnic? Yeah, she's -- she's not sure, but maybe you can go to Al's and get some sandwiches.",
        "Emily: Okay, great.",
        "Paul: I'll settle the bill.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's really good, because I was about to max out my credit card. So thanks. Listen, little miss princess, you be as good for daddy -- as you was for me, okay? Love you. Love you. I love you, too.",
        "Paul: And I love you.",
        "Emily: Meg, oh, my God! What are you doing?!",
        "Meg: Emily --",
        "Emily: Did you run away again?! Meg, you cannot do this! You -- you have to go back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: That's it! I'm calling the police.",
        "Reid: No. I told you this doesn't concern you. Just stay out of it.",
        "Luke: Why are you putting up with this?",
        "Reid: This isn't your fight! Are you finished?",
        "Judd: I thought this would make me feel better, but it doesn't, because beating you up is not gonna bring me back my Annie.",
        "Reid: Quit gawking. The show's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Sorry to show up like this. I went by the police station to pick you up, but, obviously, I was too late.",
        "Molly: Guess I beat you to him.",
        "Holden: I just wanted to grab a shower before seeing the kids. After a few days in prison, I figured I needed one.",
        "Lily: It was nice of Molly to give you a lift.",
        "Molly: Lily, I'm sorry you went out of your way. I guess it never dawned on me thinking you'd pick him up.",
        "Lily: You ready? The kids can't wait to see their daddy.",
        "Holden: I am ready. I can't wait to see them, either. I'm ready if you are.",
        "Molly: Um, you two go on. I've got some stuff I have to take care of.",
        "Holden: I thought that --",
        "Molly: I'll meet up with you later.",
        "Holden: Are you sure?",
        "Molly: Yeah. Go ahead. You don't want to keep your kids waiting.",
        "Holden: Okay. I'll see you in a bit.",
        "Molly: Okay. You bet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I think, Faith, that you're being very unfair to your mother, and I would have thought by now, you'd have firsthand knowledge of how manipulative and controlling Damian can be.",
        "Faith: Yeah, but I didn't sleep with the guy.",
        "Lucinda: No! That's enough. That's enough. I want you to give your mother the respect that you owe her.",
        "Faith: Why? She knew exactly what she was doing. Even when dad came back, she still chose to be with Damian. Why would she do that? Why would she do that to dad?",
        "Lucinda: It was a mistake. I agree with you. But now she has a chance, an opportunity to correct the mistake. But it -- it seems to me that you don't want to give her that chance. Why is that?",
        "Faith: Because I don't think she loves dad anymore, and I don't want to see him get hurt.",
        "Lucinda: Maybe it's a good thing that you're going back to boarding school. Honey, Darling, wait, wait. Look, your parents need a chance to heal. Heal. And you need to rethink your take on this situation.",
        "Faith: Or maybe I should stay here so I can keep another disaster from happening to my family.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I don't think it would be a good idea to interfere, Faith.",
        "Lily: Interfere with what?",
        "Lucinda: Uh, with -- Ethan's cake eating. Hi, Honey. Hey, hey.",
        "Holden: Hello.",
        "Lucinda: Hi. Welcome home. Welcome home.",
        "Holden: Thank you. Hi, Faith.",
        "Faith: I'm so glad you're free.",
        "Holden: Oh, so am I, Sweetheart. Kids, I'm home! Hey, guys. Come here. Sit down. Oh, give me a hug! I missed you guys so much. Oh, thinking about this moment is the only thing that got me through.",
        "Lucinda: Now it's all over. Thank heavens it's over. We can get back to being normal again.",
        "Faith: There's that word again -- \"Normal.\"",
        "Holden: Is that such a bad word?",
        "Faith: Sometimes.",
        "Lucinda: Faith, that's enough.",
        "Lily: All right, you guys. What is going on?",
        "Faith: I just don't think that we should pretend that everything's gonna go back to the way that they used to be. It's not like you're moving back in here, right?",
        "Natalie: Are you, Dad?",
        "Holden: No. I'm still gonna be staying out at the farm. But I'm gonna see you guys every day, I promise.",
        "Lucinda: Well, who wants some cake?",
        "Natalie: Me.",
        "Lily: Okay, guys, go wash up. Faith, what is it? Something is bothering you, Sweetie. What's going on?",
        "Faith: Nothing.",
        "Lucinda: Uh, Faith is conflicted about going back to school, and I have been telling her that the longer she stays away, the more she will fall behind.",
        "Holden: Faith, your grandmother, she's right. Now that I'm out of jail and the charges have been dropped, I think you need to go back to school.",
        "Faith: I already told Mom I didn't want to go back.",
        "Holden: Is that true?",
        "Lily: Well, yeah. But honestly, Faith, thought you were talking about next year.",
        "Faith: No, I meant right now.",
        "Holden: Were you going to tell me?",
        "Lily: There was so much going on, Holden. I thought you had enough to worry about.",
        "Holden: Faith, I think you need to at least just go back and finish out the school year. And then if you're not happy, we'll make some changes next year.",
        "Faith: No! You don't get it! I can't go back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Molly sighs]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Molly: Snyder residence. No, Mr. Snyder's not here right now. May I take a message? Ms. Gibson, hi. It's Molly Conlan, Mr. Snyder's friend. Remember? Is something wrong? Of course. I understand. I'll tell him you called. But you'll be able to speak to him personally when he brings Faith back to school. I'm sorry. What do you mean she can't come back? No. No, I didn't know she had been suspended. She didn't say anything about that. May I ask why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Faith, why can't you go back to school?",
        "Faith: Because -- the place is all wrong for me. I don't fit in. I -- I'm just not happy there.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, why didn't you tell me that before? I -- I assumed that you wanted to stay home because you were afraid of Damian.",
        "Faith: No. This has nothing to do with Damian. This has to do with me. I just don't want to go back. That's all. Daddy, please don't make me go.",
        "Holden: Honey, it seems foolish not to go back when you only have a couple months left in the semester.",
        "Lily: If you don't want to go back next year, we'll work something out.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, good heavens. What is that woman doing here?",
        "Holden: I invited her. Hi. Come on in.",
        "Lucinda: Don't -- don't you think it's inappropriate to be here, Molly? This is a family gathering.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, could you just ease up? I'm with Molly now. That makes her part of this family.",
        "Natalie: Okay, it's time for cake.",
        "Holden: You're just in time. There's some cake. All right. Uh, come on, guys, let's go. Let's have a little celebration.",
        "Lucinda: Did you know she was coming?",
        "Lily: Yes. Unfortunately, I did.",
        "Molly: Faith, hold on a second.",
        "Faith: What?",
        "Molly: I just got off the phone with Ms. Gibson.",
        "Faith: Why would she call you?",
        "Molly: She didn't. She called the farm looking for your dad. I just happened to pick up.",
        "Faith: What did she tell you?",
        "Molly: Pretty much everything -- about the pot, your suspension.",
        "Faith: Look, it's all a big mistake.",
        "Molly: Don't, Faith. I've heard every excuse in the book because I've used most of them, and I'm not gonna fall for any of them. You can tell me the truth. I'm not gonna judge you. I just want to help you.",
        "Faith: You can help by staying out of this.",
        "Molly: Damian found out, didn't he? Is that what he used to hold over you to get you to bring your mother to him? He threatened to tell your parents about the trouble you were in at school?",
        "Faith: You don't understand. It's not what it looks like.",
        "Molly: No, it is what it is, Faith. I'm your friend. I am.",
        "Faith: Then you won't tell my parents.",
        "Molly: I won't, if you promise me that you will.",
        "Faith: There's nothing to tell. It was a one-time thing. I've learned my lesson. It won't happen again. There's no reason why they should even know.",
        "Molly: Honey, your parents have to know. Somebody has to tell them. It can be you, or it can be me. It's your call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, let go of me. I've done nothing wrong.",
        "Emily: Really? You're supposed to be at Deerbrook, and I never heard anything about you being released. So would you mind explaining to me what you're doing here?",
        "Meg: Okay -- look, I didn't escape. We're on a group outing, okay?",
        "Emily: A what?",
        "Meg: Okay, see that guy over there? That's Michael. He's our attendant. He's supervising the trip. So go over there and ask him if you don't believe me.",
        "Emily: No, no, I'm sorry. I just assumed. Sorry.",
        "Meg: That's okay. I can't say I'm surprised. That's why I didn't want to come along. I knew that if I ran into somebody, I knew that something like this would happen.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Of course, it had to be me.",
        "Meg: How's Eliza?",
        "Emily: Oh, Eliza, she -- she is truly an amazing little girl, Meg.",
        "Meg: Good.",
        "Emily: She's in Fashions, actually, with Paul if you want to see her.",
        "Meg: I already do.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Paul: Hey. Why aren't you in the hospital?",
        "Emily: Oh, no, no, no. Everything's okay. She's -- she's on a, uh -- a group outing.",
        "Paul: Oh. Well, that's great. It must be nice for you to -- to get some fresh air. Here. Look who's here. Come here.",
        "[Paul groans]",
        "Emily: Oh!",
        "Paul: Take her.",
        "Meg: Uh -- no. I don't think I should.",
        "Paul: I really do think that you should, yes.",
        "Meg: Hey. Hi.",
        "Emily: I guess I should go get those sandwiches now.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",
        "Meg: Hey, Sweetheart. Wow. You've gotten so big.",
        "Paul: You look great. Much better than the last time I saw you.",
        "Meg: Funny, I feel about the same, at least on the inside.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, spending time with her, that will help. I'll tell you what. I'll go get us some coffee, and I'll be back, and you can spend some time alone with her.",
        "[Meg stammering]",
        "Meg: I don't know. I --",
        "Paul: I think it's the right thing for you to do.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Paul: Great. I'll be right back.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: Come here. Come here. Oh, Eliza, I've missed you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dr. Oliver, wait, wait. What was that all about?",
        "Reid: It's -- it's none of your business.",
        "Luke: Look, if you're in some kind of trouble because of a case back in Dallas and I'm the one that brought you to Oakdale, then, yeah, I think it kind of is my business.",
        "Reid: I'm not in any trouble, okay? Not here, not there, not anywhere.",
        "Luke: Well, then, why did that guy say you murdered his daughter?",
        "Reid: Why do you think? Oh, that's right. You don't think. He's a grieving father who lost his only child. That's why.",
        "Luke: How did she die?",
        "Reid: Are we suddenly not speaking the same language? I said it was none of your business.",
        "Luke: Look, Dr. Oliver --",
        "Reid: I'm not gonna discuss another patient with you, not now or anytime in the future, so get lost.",
        "Luke: You know, you have a real problem with answering to people, don't you? I mean, you get really defensive when your back is to the wall.",
        "Reid: It's not to the wall. It's to you. Leave this alone, Mr. Snyder, I mean it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, guys, this cake is really good. You better come in if you want a piece. Everything okay?",
        "Molly: Faith, is there something you want to say to your dad?",
        "Faith: Yes. And, uh, you were right. I should go back and finish out the year. I don't want them to hold me back a year.",
        "Holden: Oh, Honey, that's good. I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, if it's not working out in a couple of months, we'll figure something out, I promise you.",
        "Faith: Okay. Uh, I think I should go back this afternoon then, if that's all right.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. I'll -- I'll drive you.",
        "Lucinda: Why don't you and Lily, uh, drive her together? I think that's a great idea. Don't you, Dear?",
        "Lily: Yes, I do. Let me go tell your sister and your brother.",
        "Holden: I'll be right back.",
        "Molly: Okay, you want to tell me what just happened?",
        "Faith: I'm gonna tell them the truth, really. I just don't want to tell them here in front of Grandma and Natalie and Ethan. I'll tell them in the car, I swear. It will be better all the way around, and maybe Dad won't get as mad while he's behind the wheel.",
        "Holden: Okay. You ready?",
        "Faith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Great. Let's go.",
        "Faith: Mom, Dad, there's something I need to tell you.",
        "Holden: What is it?",
        "Faith: I need to say I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: For what?",
        "Faith: For everything. I messed up pretty badly, getting involved with Damian and -- and trusting him.",
        "Holden: Honey, it's done. It's over with.",
        "Faith: But you were in jail.",
        "Holden: Not because of anything you did.",
        "Lily: We all made mistakes where Damian's concerned, but that's in the past. We just need to move on and forget about it.",
        "Faith: I should have been honest with both of you from the beginning.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, you were scared. You thought you were doing the right thing. It's understandable.",

        "Lily: Look, just try for a few more months. If you're miserable, call us and tell us.",

        "Lucinda: Oh, no, no, no. They're in the barn. They're visiting with the horses. It will keep them occupied and happy, I think, long enough for me to say what I need to say.",
        "Molly: Oh, no, let me guess. This is my favorite game. \"Stay out of Holden's life. Give Lily the chance to win him back.\" Blah, blah, blah.",
        "Lucinda: Excellent. We're on the same page. How quick can you pack?",
        "Molly: Oh, Lucinda, Lucinda. You are so predictable. But luckily, I'm not, and neither is Holden. You see, we're in love, again. Imagine that.",
        "Lucinda: I'm trying very hard not to.",
        "Molly: So even if you close your eyes and wish really, really hard, I'm not going away.",
        "Lucinda: What if I close my eyes and I write a really, really, really big check?",
        "Molly: Save your zeros, old lady, because it won't work.",
        "Lucinda: Oh.",
        "Molly: I am staying right here for a very, very long time. Literally, right here.",
        "Lucinda: Don't tell me that Holden asked you to move in with him here.",
        "Molly: Breaks your heart, doesn't it?",
        "Lucinda: No, rather it turns my stomach. You actually believe that he's committed to you.",
        "Molly: I have no reason not to.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you may be climbing into his bed, but his heart -- his heart belongs to Lily, and it always will.",
        "Molly: Okay, you know what? We're finished. And since I live here now, I have the right to ask you to leave.",

        "Holden: Why not?",
        "Faith: Because she's giving her speech at the daily assembly.",
        "Lily: Well, we'll wait. When does the assembly end?",
        "Faith: Uh, it just started, and sometimes it drags on and on.",
        "Holden: She does like to talk, doesn't she?",
        "Faith: You have no idea. I don't want to make a big deal about coming back. Then everyone's gonna ask me what happened and try and find out what the big emergency was and everything.",
        "Holden: You don't want to answer questions. We understand that, right?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I suppose.",
        "Faith: I'd rather just be here and hope people will leave me alone.",
        "Lily: Well, can we at least walk you to your dorm?",
        "Faith: Mom, I can handle that on my own.",
        "Holden: Okay, okay, fine. Just leave us standing here on the curb all by ourselves. We don't mind.",
        "Faith: My room is a mess, and there are clothes everywhere. I'd be embarrassed for you guys.",
        "Lily: See, now, that I believe. Come here, you.",
        "Faith: I love you guys so much.",

        "Holden: By bringing her back here? Yes.",
        "Lily: Even though she says she's miserable?",
        "Holden: All teenagers are miserable. It's all part of the growing up process. And, hopefully, she'll, you know, figure all this out for herself.",
        "Lily: I hope so.",
        "Holden: She just needs to get back into her routine, that's all.",
        "Lily: Well, at least she was honest with us about what was going on.",

        "Luke: What are you saying? Is there some truth in what that guy was saying about you?",
        "Reid: Do I think I'm a murderer? No, I do not. But it doesn't stop false accusations from embarrassing the hospital unnecessarily.",
        "Luke: You really think that I believe you care about that?",
        "Reid: I would hope so.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't. I think there's something more to this, and I think there must be some truth to that story. Otherwise, you wouldn't be afraid of it.",

        "Paul: Yes, she did. I told you. Little time with her daughter, best thing for her. You're not mad I spent time with her, are you?",
        "Emily: Mad? No. No, I think it's -- it's important that -- that Eliza and Meg keep this connection.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I -- I also think it's important that, you know, we don't, uh, send Eliza any mixed signals.",
        "Emily: Are you saying I have?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Emily: Well, then, what are you saying? Because I -- as of this moment, I am Eliza's mother. I'm the constant in her life, because that's what Meg asked me to be.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Emily: And I have to give myself 100% to her or -- or not at all. I -- I can't give just a part of myself. It's not fair to Eliza.",
        "Paul: Well, none of this is fair to Eliza. Look, it's -- it's my job to make sure that -- that Eliza is protected. That's all.",

        "Luke: How? How did she die?",
        "Reid: It was a brain tumor. It was a terminal case. The tumor was located in a place that was virtually impossible to reach through surgery.",
        "Luke: But you tried.",
        "Reid: I made it very clear to the Judd's that it was a risky operation, that it had a very small chance of success, but if we didn't operate, she was gonna die in the next couple of weeks.",
        "Luke: And I take it the operation wasn't a success.",
        "Reid: Well, it depends on what you call a success. I gave the girl a year of life that she wouldn't have otherwise had.",
        "Luke: A year? But then why did the guy attack you? Why did he call you a murderer? And why didn't you defend yourself?",
        "Reid: What would you have me do, Mr. Snyder, hmm? Fight him? Risk hurting my hands by punching him in the face? The guy lost his only daughter. She was 6 years old when she died. Can you even imagine that? You think that guy would have heard anything I had to say to him?",
        "Luke: Do you know what I think?",
        "Reid: No, and I don't particularly care to.",
        "Luke: I think you feel you deserved that attack.",

        "Luke: [Scoffs] Does it?",
        "Reid: I'd make the same call again.",
        "Luke: I know that. But you feel that you failed, and you can't handle that.",

        "Lily: It's hard to believe that 24 hours ago, you were behind bars.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know. I'm trying to pretend like it never happened.",

        "Lily: I was kind of expecting you to do that for me.",
        "Holden: Nope, not gonna do it. What I think we should do is just take the same advice that we gave Faith. Just forget about the past, focus on the future. This thing that happened with Damian, it was a bad detour for all of us, including you.",

        "Holden: I think she's gonna be fine. I think she's gonna figure it all out. Things haven't been normal for us for a very long time. But I think she'll be okay. I think she's gonna change for the better right now.",

        "Emily: You don't think I want that?",
        "Paul: No, I -- I know that you do. I -- kids, they -- they live in the now. And this is Eliza's reality. And when that reality changes, as it will, then we have to make sure that Eliza knows what's going on.",

        "Meg: You know, I -- I was scared that seeing Eliza would make being here even harder, but it's given me hope. It's given me something to work toward, look forward to. And it also got me thinking that I'm ready for the next step.",
        "Therapist: What step is that, Meg?",

        "Reid: After you learned that we were staying in Oakdale?",
        "Luke: That's right.",
        "Reid: Well, I can't say I'm surprised. You barely gave that guy room to breathe. He felt like he had to take care of you most of the time. Your guilt overwhelmed him.",
        "Luke: He said that?",
        "Reid: He didn't have to. It was obvious.",
        "Luke: You know, I think you should leave now.",
        "Reid: Oh, did I hit a nerve?",
        "Luke: I don't think you have any right to talk about a relationship that you know nothing about.",
        "Reid: I know that he wanted you to leave him alone. What I don't know is what took him so long to finally put himself first.",
        "Luke: You know what? This was my decision. I ended this relationship. Now get out of my house.",

        "Molly: So you never talked to the headmistress, Ms. Gibson?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Molly: So did you actually see Faith go inside the building?",
        "Holden: Back up a minute. How do you know that she was suspended?",
        "Molly: Because Ms. Gibson called here at the farm when you were at Lily's. She was looking for you. But I told her that she would see you when you dropped Faith at school, and that's when she told me that Faith had been suspended.",
        "Lily: Suspended why?",
        "Molly: She was caught smoking pot.",
