        "Matt hits Gray over the head and unlocks the door so Vienna and Henry can leave the church. Gray gets angry that Matt betrayed him and escapes to the Chicago loop scenic shop. Matt tells Margo that Gray wants revenge against her family and gives her a card with the address to the Chicago loop scenic shop. Matt is taken to the hospital and survives an operation. Bonnie and Dallas help Casey and Allison discover that Gray's real name is Gerald Nevins, the man who raped Margo. Casey warns Margo who is on her way to Chicago in pursuit of Nevins. Carly is searching the scenic shop costume files when she is caught by Nevins who gets away when he hears the police siren. Carly tells Margo she was unable to find evidence to clear Parker, but the guy she is searching for took off when he heard the siren. Carly finds a homeless woman who saw Kit but the woman runs away, because she doesn't want trouble from the police. Katie is jealous to see Bonnie and Brad on a date celebrating Henry and Vienna's reconciliation. Brad drinks champagne given to Henry and Vienna by Gray and pretends that he is choking and passes out; nobody thinks it's funny. Vienna and Henry go upstairs to Katie's room to have a private celebration, and Brad continues to drink the champagne. Brad falls to the floor again. Bonnie thinks he is joking, but Katie rushes to Brad's side to perform CPR when she notices he isn't breathing while Bonnie rushes to call an ambulance."

        "Bonnie: Really?",
        "Brad: You're exactly what the doctor ordered.",
        "Bonnie: Hey, I'm not going to be your shoulder to cry on because someone broke your little heart.",
        "Brad: No way. That could not be further from the truth. I -- look -- this is absolutely, positively nothing to do with Katie.",

        "Margo: Hey, Sis, what's up?",
        "Katie: I was wondering if you were free for dinner?",
        "Margo: Just like that? Out of the blue?",
        "Katie: Yeah, why not?",
        "Margo: Well, I don't know. You tell me. What's wrong?",

        "Margo: Who is it?",
        "Cop #1: A guy who says he'll only talk to you.",
        "Margo: Crackpots. If I had money for every phone call -- I'm going to take it down here. Hughes.",
        "Matt: Mom?",
        "Margo: Who is this?",

        "Casey: Hey, Alison. What's up?",
        "Alison: I just had a really weird conversation with Matt.",
        "Casey: That's the emergency? You couldn't have called me or text me?",
        "Alison: I just got my shift covered, that's how important I think this is.",
        "Casey: What did he say? Did he tell who Gray Gerard really is?",
        "Alison: All he said is that Gray is a really bad guy, and that I should warn you and your family to be careful.",
        "Casey: What the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "Alison: I don't know, but it sounded really scary. And Matt admitted to working for Gray. I think we should call your parents, Casey. He's living in your house.",
        "Casey: No, no. I want to know more about this Gray Gerard first, you know. Did Matt give you any idea exactly what he's up to?",
        "Alison: No, he just made it sound really serious. And dangerous. I really think we should go to the police station and talk to your mother.",
        "Casey: Maybe Will can help us get back into the Oakdale PD computer.",
        "Alison: I don't want to bother Will. He and Gwen all ready have their hands full.",
        "Casey: You know, I'd do it myself, but I don't want to chance any of this getting back to my mom. I'm in enough trouble as it is.",
        "Alison: All right. Okay. If you don't want to go to the police, then I think I know who can help us find out who Gray Gerard really is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Who is this? Is this is some kind of a joke? It's not funny.",
        "Matt: Mom. It's me Adam. Look, I know that you're mad at me for disappearing. I get that. But please just give me a chance to explain.",
        "Margo: Why should I? Do you know about your brother? Do you know that Casey's in jail?",
        "Matt: I can't talk here. Meet me at Luther's Corners. Come to the church, and I'll explain everything. Mom, please, give me a chance to make this up to you.",

        "Vienna: We shouldn't.",
        "Henry: What -- what do you mean we shouldn't? The door is locked. Nobody can get in. It's just you, me, and the pulpit.",

        "Henry: Baby, Baby, you always feel right.",

        "Vienna: Well, I am. I mean him.",
        "Henry: What do you -- oh, him. Oh, him. Him, oh. Oh, uh, no, no, I don't think he's going to mind at all. I mean, isn't he all about peace and love? And aren't we making peace by making love? I'm sure the big guy is looking down and smiling right now.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly, I thought I made it very clear, I didn't want you going to that place alone.",
        "Carly: I heard you, Jack. I'm just here because I want to find some proof that this is where Kit got her disguise. I won't even be here long. It's no big deal.",
        "Jack: Last time you were there, Carly, you almost got killed and I got shot!",
        "Carly: I know, but that was Kit, and Kit's dead.",

        "Brad: No way, Jose Cuervo.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, I did, and it was fun. So bring it on!",
        "Brad: All right. Hey, Bartender, can we get two tequila shots, and keep them coming.",
        "Bartender: You got it.",

        "Alison: Hey, Bonnie, sorry to interrupt. Your office said you'd be here.",
        "Bonnie: What's going on?",
        "Casey: We need to ask you a huge favor.",
        "Bonnie: Guessing you need some legal advice or something?",
        "Casey: No, no, no. Not exactly. Um, we have to get into the Oakdale PD computer without setting off any kind of alarms with my mom.",
        "Alison: We were hoping that you could ask your cousin, Dallas, to help us.",
        "Casey: Yeah, all we would need is a few minutes.",
        "Bonnie: What are you looking for?",
        "Alison: We need information on a guy named Gray Gerard.",
        "Brad: Take it from me, that guy is bad news!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Henry: Wait.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Henry: Did you hear that?",
        "[Door creeks]",
        "Vienna: Oh, no! People are coming to pray, and we're in here sinning.",
        "Henry: No, no, Sweetie, we're not sinning, but let's get dressed. What do you say? Huh?",
        "Vienna: All right. Okay. Oh, wait, wait. Okay. Dear, God, thank you for bringing my Henry back into me --",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Vienna: In my life.",
        "Henry: Yeah, amen, amen, amen. Why don't you say we go? We got a bed waiting.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: So what does this Gray Gerard person do?",
        "Casey: Okay, he comes off as this rich real estate guy, but he has all these aliases -- Gray Gerard, Jerry Pulawski. You know, he's lying about his past because he has a record. We don't even who this guy really is.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, a lot of ex-convicts change their names. It doesn't mean that they're still criminals.",
        "Alison: Yeah, uh, but we think he has one of our good friends involved in something that is illegal. And what really scares us is that he's been threatening Casey and his family.",
        "Bonnie: Casey, your mom's on the police force, don't you think you should tell her about this?",
        "Casey: Yes, I do. But the thing is, you know, I've been getting into a lot of trouble lately. And I don't want my mom being bothered with this, if we're wrong about this guy.",
        "Brad: No, you're not wrong. This guy's a shady character. He's the one that broke up Vienna and Henry, although what she sees him I will never know.",
        "Bonnie: If Vienna's with this guy, he's got to be bad news. Count me in.",
        "Casey: Good. Good.",
        "Alison: Thank you so much, Bonnie.",
        "Casey: Yes, we'll meet you down at the station. Okay?",
        "Alison: Okay, bye, Guys.",
        "Casey: Thank you.",
        "Brad: You know what? I am right with you. You are doing the world a favor. This Gray Gerard, man, he is a sleazy jerk.",
        "Bonnie: Well, any guy who's with Vienna is not a smart guy. We'll trip him up. Maybe his trampy, little girlfriend, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: You blew it. Did you honestly think that you were going to get away with crossing me? I own you.",
        "Matt: I'm not going to stand by and watch these innocent people get hurt.",
        "Gray: Well, that's very noble, Matt. But Tom and Margo Hughes aren't innocent. Because of them my brother is dead.",
        "Matt: Well, I'm sure that they had their reasons.",
        "Gray: I hired you to do a job, and I expected you to do it right, not go all soft on me. You crossed the wrong guy, Pal.",
        "[Gun shot]",
        "Matt: Ah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Are you sure the phone call you got was from Adam?",
        "Margo: I'm sure I wanted it to be from Adam, but I don't know if it was him.",
        "Tom: Well, it must have sounded something like him, right?",
        "Margo: I don't know. I mean, it was kind of a whisper, it sounded like someone was after him, like he had to get off the phone. He sounded scared. Oh my God, Adam! Honey! Honey! Matt?",
        "Tom: What the hell happened?",
        "Matt: Ah, ah!",
        "Margo: Yes, this is Lieutenant Margo Hughes. We need an ambulance down at Luther's Corners church. Stat. We've got a gunshot victim. He's bleeding profusely. He's about to lose consciousness. And you send out units to block off all the streets around the church. Hurry! Matt. Matt, who did this to you?",
        "Matt: Gray. Gray Gerard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Brad: Henry, Vienna.",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Bonnie: We were just talking about you two.",
        "Brad: What is going on?",
        "Vienna: We are very happy because we kissed and made up.",
        "Henry: Actually, we did more than that, and in the eyes of God.",
        "Vienna: Shh!",
        "Brad: Wow. Congratulations, you two!",
        "Henry: Okay. Okay! Oh, look, we're celebrating. Drinks are on me.",
        "Brad: Oh, yes!",
        "Vienna: Brad, can you join us?",
        "Bonnie: No, we have someplace to be. We have to meet Alison and Casey. Right, Brad?",
        "Brad: Listen, listen. You take care of this little lady, right? And, Vienna, take good care of my buddy.",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brad: All right? Okay.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Bartender: For the happy couple.",
        "Vienna: Vintage. That's so sweet, Henry, you ordered ahead.",
        "Henry: Oh, I wish I had, but I didn't. Who sent that?",
        "Bartender: It was left on reserve for you, courtesy of Gray Gerard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh, Casey, hey, your mom just left.",
        "Casey: Oh, that's okay. I didn't come here to see her.",
        "Katie: Are you all right? Is everything all okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I'm not in trouble, if that's what you mean. No, Alison and I had to do some research, and Bonnie's getting Dallas to help us.",
        "Bonnie: Casey, over here.",
        "Casey: Okay. Sorry.",
        "Katie: I hope you find what you're looking for.",
        "Casey: Oh, thanks. Me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: How nice of Gray to send champagne.",
        "Henry: Gray doesn't do anything remotely nice.",
        "Vienna: Oh, come on. You have to admit, it was a very generous gesture. Obviously, he has accepted that I chose you over him because he wants me to be happy with you.",
        "Henry: I'll pass. So will she.",
        "Vienna: Oh, come on, Henry, it's a celebration.",
        "Henry: The man almost ruined my life. All right? And I'm not celebrating with anything that has his name on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: How's he doing?",
        "EMT #1: He's lost a lot of blood.",
        "EMT #2: But he's conscious. That's a good sign.",
        "Margo: Can I ask a couple of questions?",
        "EMT #1: Make it quick.",
        "Margo: Matt, was it you who pretended to be Adam when you called me?",
        "Matt: Uh, I -- I had orders to get you here. I'm really sorry, Margo.",
        "Margo: You had orders?",
        "Matt: Yeah.",
        "Margo: So was it this Gray Gerard who shot you?",
        "Matt: Yeah, it was.",
        "EMT #2: His BP's dropping. We got to get him to the hospital.",
        "Margo: All right. Can I just -- where can I find him now? Where can I find Gerard?",
        "Matt: I -- check my pocket.",
        "[Moaning]",
        "EMT #1: Let's go.",
        "EMT #2: Go.",
        "Margo: Go, go. Get him out.",
        "EMT: #1: Go.",
        "Margo: Whoa.",
        "Tom: Well, what's it say?",
        "Margo: It's a Scenic Shop on Midwood Avenue in Chicago. That's where Henry was taken after he was kidnapped. That's where Jack was shot. I guess it's owned by Gray Gerard.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Ooh, good. Maybe there's a record of Kit renting a costume here. Oh, just one clue, please.",
        "Gray: What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Hi. Uh, I wasn't taking anything. I promise. I was just looking for a certain costume for a last-minute party. And if you had it here I was going to rent it tomorrow. Do you work here?",
        "Gray: Lady, I own this place, and you are trespassing. I could have you arrested. I want you to get off my property now.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I'm just going to be honest with you because I'm really desperate here.",
        "Gray: Did you hear what I just said?",
        "Carly: This is about my little boy. He was charged with a crime he didn't commit, and I'm looking for some evidence to clear him.",
        "Gray: It's not my problem. Now are you going to leave, or am I going to have to throw you out?",
        "Carly: Actually, I'm really glad that you found me because you might be able to help me. I'm looking for a woman who might have rented a costume here. Do you recognize this woman?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: Look, Bonnie, you still haven't told me what you want.",
        "Bonnie: I told Alison and Casey you'd do them a favor. They need you to run a computer search on this Gray Gerard person, or Jerry Pulawski. I don't know, he has lots of aliases, but they need the lowdown on this guy.",
        "Dallas: Look, I don't think Margo would appreciate me letting her son make unauthorized use of the computer. It's against procedure.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know that, but I'm trying to stay out of trouble, and protect my mom, Man. This guy can be a threat.",
        "Alison: And we really need more information.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it will only take a few minutes, you know?",
        "Bonnie: Come on, Dallas, just give the kids a break.",
        "Dallas: Okay, okay, look. You know what, just follow me.",
        "Casey: Oh, thank you.",
        "Bonnie: Brad, you coming?",
        "Brad: Be there in a sec. Hey, you all right?",
        "Katie: I'm fine, why?",
        "Brad: You just looked, you know, I don't know -- lost.",
        "Katie: Uh, yeah, well, no, I'm just waiting for Margo. We have a girl's night planned. See you wasted no time hooking up with a dinner date.",
        "Brad: Well you made it clear that you're, you know, waiting for Jack. So why should you care who I do or don't have dinner with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey, how you feeling?",
        "Jack: Just ducky.",
        "Nurse #2: We just got his blood pressure down, please don't upset him.",
        "Tom: Just small talk, I promise.",
        "Nurse #2: Behave yourself.",
        "Jack: So, what's going on? Did Margo send you over here to check up on me?",
        "Tom: Actually, no, she's working on a case. That kid that was living with us got shot outside the church tonight.",
        "Jack: You're kidding me.",
        "Tom: No.",
        "Jack: Any leads?",
        "Tom: A few. But he's in surgery, they say he's going to make it. I figured while I was waiting, I'd come down and check on you, talk about Parker's case, but after the little warning from your nurse, I guess that's a bad idea.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well between Parker's case and Carly's hard-headedness it's not really helping my recovery.",
        "Tom: So what's going on with Carly?",
        "Jack: She went off looking for evidence at that scenic shop where Kit shot me.",
        "Tom: You mean the Chicago Loop Scenic Shop on Midway?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, why? What's wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gray: I never laid eyes on that woman.",
        "Carly: Are you sure?",
        "Gray: Look, Lady, are you going to get out of here, or am I going to have to use force?",
        "Carly: Her name is Kit Fowler. You know maybe someone on staff would recognize her. Do you mind if I show them the pictures?",
        "Gray: You're asking way too many questions, Blondie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dallas: All right, you Guys see anything here that might help?",
        "Casey: Not yet, but can you keep going?",
        "Dallas: Oh, not for much longer. All right?",
        "Alison: Wait a minute. Look at that.",

        "Margo: Can we talk about this later?",
        "Casey: No, Mom. Okay, we checked on the guy that Matt's been working for. And he's been going by the name Gray Gerard, but his real name is Gerald Nevins.",
        "Margo: Oh my God.",
        "Casey: Nevins. That was the name of the man who raped you, and Dad shot after he escaped from jail.",
        "Margo: Yeah. Yeah. It's too much of a coincidence for them not to be related.",
        "Casey: Okay, Matt said something about warning you. What do you think that meant?",
        "Margo: A lot -- I'm on my way now to track down this Nevins guy. He's the guy who shot Matt.",
        "Casey: Matt was shot?",
        "Margo: Look, I can't talk about it now, Casey. We'll talk later. Thank you, it was good work.",

        "[Police sirens in the distance]",
        "Gray: I knew you were up to something. Have you called the police?",
        "Carly: No! No, no, of course not. It must be my over-protective ex. He must have sent some back-up, that's all. I'll get rid of them. It'll just take me a minute.",

        "Casey: Yeah, I'm really worried about my mom.",
        "Dallas: Look, Margo's smart, okay? She can take care of herself.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but if anything happens to her, it's going to be my fault. I'm the one who brought Matt into our home, and put everyone in danger.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but Dallas is right, Casey. Your mom knows what she's doing. She'll be fine. And at least Matt warned us ahead of time about Gray.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and he was shot for his troubles.",
        "Alison: Why don't we go to Memorial, and see how he's doing?",
        "Casey: Yeah, good idea. Hey, thanks for bending the rules, Man.",
        "Dallas: Yeah, not a problem. But at least the chief knows what she's up against. Okay?",

        "Brad: Well, is there a reason I'm not aware of that would keep me from dating her?",
        "Katie: None that I can think of.",
        "Bonnie: Kids are done. You want to go back to the Lakeview, and finish what we started?",
        "Brad: Let's do it. Let's do it.",

        "Carly: Well, I'm trying to find evidence to clear Parker. His trial starts tomorrow, and I know that Kit got the duplicates of Sam's dummy here. And I think she might have gotten disguises here as well.",
        "Margo: Oh, Man. Playing detective's a great way to get yourself killed. Look what happened to Jack, he's one of the best detectives we have on the force.",
        "Carly: I have to try and help my son. Now, why are you here?",
        "Margo: I'm tracking a suspect. He owns this shop, we think he might be hiding out here.",
        "Carly: Oh, I think I might have seen the man you're looking for. He took off when he heard you coming.",

        "Jack: I've been better.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I can't believe Matt got shot. We heard he was in surgery.",

        "Bonnie: Yeah. Mm-hmm.",
        "Henry: Oh, and, Brad -- I'll join you. You want a little advice from the newly reconciled?",
        "Brad: No offense, Henry, I'm cool.",
        "Henry: Well, you're going to get it anyway. All right, you can't fool me. I've been there with a little lady named Katie.",
        "Brad: Been where?",
        "Henry: On the rebound. You're not going to mend the broken heart by jumping head first into another relationship.",
        "Brad: Watch me. Bartender, can I get two shots of tequila?",
        "Vienna: Everyone knows that Brad is hopelessly in love with Katie. Doesn't it bother you, dating someone else's man?",
        "Bonnie: Didn't I hear that you were living it up with Gray Gerard like a minute ago? Henry must not mind. He must be used to being two-timed. No wonder you two are so wonderful together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Well, there's no sign of him. He must've taken off before Chicago PD put the roadblocks up.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I haven't seen him.",
        "Margo: You count your blessings you're still alive, Carly. You wouldn't do Parker much good if you went back to Oakdale in a body bag, would you?",
        "Vienna: For your information, Gray Gerard did not reject me. I rejected Gray, because I want to be with my true love, my soul mate, my Henry.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, give me a break.",
        "Vienna: But then again, you wouldn't know anything about true love. Would you? How long were you married to Isaac Jenkins? A minute and a half? Henry and I are forever.",
        "Bonnie: No, Vienna, diamonds are forever. And that's all you want. Cold, hard, cash so you can buy more diamonds.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, okay.",
        "Bonnie: You are so shallow.",
        "Brad: Hey, Ladies, come on. Come on. Put away the boxing gloves. Come on. Here, here, here. Here, here, right over here. There you go. Here's your shot. Hey, look, you got champagne. You're not even drinking it?",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, that was a gift from Gray Gerard. And any gift from that slime ball is bound to be tainted at best. So, who knows what would happen if drank it.",
        "Brad: You know what, I don't like the guy either, but booze is booze, and free booze is better.",
        "Henry: All right. Suit yourself.",
        "Brad: This is vintage year.",

        "Henry: Oh my God, he's been poisoned. Vienna, Vienna, call 911, and hurry! I knew Gray wouldn't send us a bottle of champagne unless he was up to something. Brad! Brad, are you -- can you hear me, Brad? Brad, are you okay? Brad, Brad --",

        "Henry: It's not funny, Brad. Brad, that's not funny.",
        "Brad: Oh, come on! Lighten up a little bit!",
        "Henry: No, no, no. If you'd been tortured by Gray Gerard -- I mean, look at my wrists! If you'd been tortured like I have been tortured, you would not have gone there. Vienna, God, Vienna, my love, my sweet, why don't we continue this celebration upstairs?",
        "Vienna: Oh, well, that's a good idea.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Not funny, Brad!",
        "Brad: Hey, come on. Come on! Come on! Hey, you know, I am really happy for them. I really am. You know what? To Henry and Vienna. Want some cha-pan-ya?",
        "Bonnie: No, I'll stick to tequila. Thanks.",
        "Brad: Well, more for me.",
        "Bonnie: I think you're trying a little too hard, Brad.",
        "Brad: Oh, come on. It was just a little -- it was a practical joke.",
        "Bonnie: No, I could see how upset you were when you saw Katie in the station.",

        "Alison: You came clean in the end. Told us the truth, that's what matters.",
        "Casey: It is. Telling the truth about Gray Gerard really could have saved my parents' lives.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well if I know your mom, she's going to put him behind bars for the rest of his life, so he can't hurt anybody else.",
        "Matt: Look, I hate to tell you this, but nobody's ever caught Gray. He always finishes the job.",

        "Jack: She went looking for someone else?",
        "Carly: I know, she told me. Gray Gerard. It's a real coincidence though, isn't it? Imagine that, I'm here searching for evidence to clear Parker, and she's looking for a criminal right here in the same random shop.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, Gray Gerard's real name is Nevins. His brother raped Margo and tried to kill her and Tom. He could've killed you, Carly.",

        "Margo: Put out an APB for Gerald Nevins aka Gray Gerard. He is armed and dangerous. I've searched the shop, there's no sign of him. But he'll be back. It's his shop. I don't think we've seen the last of Nevins.",

        "Vienna: Poor Katie. We kind of kicked her out, didn't we?",
        "Henry: Yeah. We did kind of kick her out. I don't know. We'll make it up to her somehow. In fact, I -- no, scratch that.",
