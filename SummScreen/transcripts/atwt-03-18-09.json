        "Jack orders Parker and Liberty out of Carly's home, as Carly and Janet are furious, but Jack is standing his ground. Blame is tossed around, as they talk about Parker's reasoning for this. Craig and Janet both leave, as Janet is frantic to find them and is furious at Jack as well. Jack admits to Carly that he is afraid at what his son has become, as Carly is sure that he is implying Parker is becoming her. Carly wants him to let Parker come home so he doesn't think they have abandoned him, but Jack is adamant that he be taught a lesson by his behavior if he is so intent on being an adult. Liberty worries about the ramifications of their actions on their parents. Parker feels he did what he had to. Craig finds Parker and Liberty sitting on a bench in Old Town and offers to put them up at the Lakeview for the night. Craig tells Carly what he did, but Carly doesn't tell Jack. Jack explains that he just wants his family back in one piece, as Carly tells him that will most likely not happen now. Brad and Katie are anxious to know if Vienna is pregnant, as they wait no longer when a thrilled Vienna with a less then thrilled looking Henry show up to tell them the happy news \u0096 she is pregnant. They all celebrate their different family to be. Their celebration is cut short when Janet comes and admits to Brad what is going on with Parker and Liberty. Later, Henry wants to sleep with Vienna, but she doesn't want to risk the baby. Henry is not happy when he points out that she promised nothing would change between them. Vienna tries to help him relax in other ways, but soon they are giving into their passions. Brad is furious, but Janet needs him to be the person that Liberty can come to, as she relays that Jack's reaction was so similar to her parent's when she got pregnant. She admits how much she screwed up because of that lack of support. Brad agrees to try to help Liberty and even goes as far to tell Katie that Parker and Liberty can stay with them under close supervision. Carly calls Janet to tell her that the kids are ok, as they agree to not tell Jack. Parker and Liberty are awkward and unsure, as they get settled in for the night and agree now is not the time to have sex \u0096 even if it is their wedding night. Carly breaks down, as she is drinking her wine when Craig shows up. Carly is angry at him, even though she is also thankful, as she wonders if she made different choices and not listened to him, if things would be different. Craig is just trying to help, but he realizes he isn't and decides to leave. Jack and Janet argue about his reaction to Parker and Liberty when Jack won't change his mind. Jack prays to Hal. Janet tells him that his behavior towards Liberty has left her with a broken heart, as she wants Jack to sleep elsewhere."

        "Carly: Parker! Parker! How could you do this?",
        "Jack: How could I not? After what they did, rubbing off and --",
        "Carly: You just threw our son out of our house.",
        "Janet: Not to mention my daughter!",
        "Jack: And do I need to remind you two that they're husband and wife?",
        "Carly: I don't care! Where are they supposed to go?",
        "Jack: Guess what? I don't care!",
        "Janet: Jack.",
        "Jack: No. If Parker and Liberty want to get married, if they think this makes them adults? I say let them try. See how far they get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Wow, I've never seen your dad lose it like that before. Man, he really flipped out.",
        "Parker: You should've seen him when he was shoving stuff into my bags. I thought he was going to turn into the Hulk.",
        "Liberty: Are you okay?",
        "Parker: Yeah, fine. How about you? Listen, I know about the money --",
        "Liberty: That's okay, you don't have to.",
        "Parker: I want to.",
        "Liberty: But I like this one. It is the real one. Can I ask you something? Did you really mean what you said to the judge? About being afraid your mom would take money from your trust fund and use it on herself? Because her face, when you said that, it was awful.",
        "Parker: I said what I had to so that the judge would marry us. And I'm not sorry I did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm just wondering if the procedure worked. Do you think it did?",
        "Brad: We'll know soon enough.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but I want to know now. I want to know if it did or it didn't so I can know how I'm supposed to be feeling.",
        "Brad: Either way, I think it's all right to be excited about this.",
        "Katie: No, it's not.",
        "Brad: Why not?",
        "Katie: Because what if I get all excited and it doesn't work?",
        "Brad: If it doesn't work, we'll keep trying.",
        "Katie: For how long?",
        "Brad: For as long as it takes. Look at me. We are going to have a baby. I know it. I feel it. I love you.",
        "Katie: I'll get it. Hey! What are you guys doing here?",
        "Vienna: We're pregnant.",
        "Katie: What? Are you sure?",
        "Vienna: Yes! They're all positive. See, one for each of us. We're having a baby!",
        "Katie: Oh, my God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Where are you going?",
        "Carly: Where do you think? I'm going to find them.",
        "Jack: And then what, Carly?",
        "Carly: I don't know, Jack. I'm not you. I don't have all the answers.",
        "Jack: You're not going anywhere. You've done enough.",
        "Carly: Just a minute. Are you saying this is my fault?",
        "Jack: I sure as hell wasn't a witness.",
        "Carly: Neither was I.",
        "Jack: You were standing right there when they took their vows.",
        "Carly: I was doing everything I could to stop them from what they were doing. They didn't need my consent and the judge wouldn't listen to a word I said.",
        "Jack: So you gave up.",
        "Carly: No, but the judge threatened to have me arrested for assault.",
        "Jack: Assault?",
        "Craig: She's telling the truth, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why are you here? This doesn't concern you.",
        "Janet: Liberty's not answering.",
        "Jack: I just want to know what the hell they were thinking.",
        "Carly: You want to know why they got married, Jack. Parker wants to be emancipated.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: To stop us from sending him to that boarding school.",
        "Jack: That's what this is about?",
        "Carly: Are you surprised? I begged you, Jack. I begged you to back off because Parker was so against it.",
        "Jack: Don't act like you weren't with me on this, Carly, because you were.",
        "Carly: Until I realized how miserable it was making him.",
        "Jack: He's a teenager, Carly. He's supposed to be miserable!",
        "Carly: Well, is he supposed to be married? Because he is. And that, Jack, is on you.",
        "Jack: Don't put all this on me.",
        "Carly: God, forbid you be responsible.",
        "Jack: You talk about responsibility, Carly? Parker's a kid he doesn't know what's best for him. That's why we have to be the one that makes the tough decisions.",
        "Carly: Tough decisions like taking him to a boarding school he doesn't want to go to.",
        "Jack: I've given you my reasons. And I wasn't about to be blackmailed with an injunctions so he could get what he wants.",
        "Carly: You sure taught him a lesson, didn't you?",
        "Janet: You guys this isn't helping.",
        "Jack: Why didn't you call me? Why did I have to hear what was happening by him? Answer me, please?",
        "Carly: I thought I could get through Parker on my own.",
        "Jack: Oh, I should have been there.",
        "Carly: All you do is yell at him.",
        "Jack: I yell because I care.",
        "Janet: It doesn't matter anymore. They're married! What matters now, is getting them back here. And getting them out of this.",
        "Jack: We're not running to their rescue, Janet. Not this time.",
        "Janet: They're our children, Jack. And Parker is not the only one you threw out. Liberty went with him.",
        "Jack: Parker, did not act alone. Liberty went along with him. Yes!",
        "Janet: I know that.",
        "Jack: And they're gonna have to be consequences for what they have done.",
        "Janet: So now it's up to you, to determine my daughter's consequence? Jack, I love you. But, you just threw the most important thing in my life out that door. Without a second thought.",
        "Jack: Where are you going?",
        "Janet: I'm going to find my daughter!",
        "Carly: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Jack: You can leave. Just get the hell out of here.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack. How many more people are you going to toss out of my house?",
        "Craig: No, its okay, Carly. I should go. If you need anything, call me. Jack.",
        "Jack: Carly, look.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, Vienna, did you tell the doctor yet?",
        "Vienna: No. I wanted you and Brad to be the first ones to know. After Henry of course.",
        "Henry: Lucky me.",
        "Katie: It worked the first time. It's amazing!",
        "Vienna: No, it's fate!",
        "Brad: Are you forgetting these are my boys we were talking about? They knew how much we were counting on them.",
        "Henry: I thought we were done talking about your famous boys.",
        "Vienna: What's wrong with you?",
        "Henry: Nothing. Brad's contribution was appreciated, but it's done now.",
        "Brad: A toast. A toast. And for once in my life, I'm at a loss for words. So, just a simple thank you. Thank you for our baby, for giving us a chance to be parents. You know how long Katie and I have been wanting this, and without you, it would not be possible. So, to you, Vienna, and to you, Henry. The best two friends anyone could have.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brad: Thank you.",
        "Vienna: Oh, and most importantly, to Sven or Inga.",
        "All: To Sven or Inga.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What did you want me to say?",
        "Carly: I don't want you to say anything.",
        "Jack: I was angry! I'm tired of it. I was angry of him mouthing off and disrespecting us and thinking he can get away with it. It's time we stand up to him, Carly. Right now he thinks we're running scared.",
        "Carly: I am scared. I'm scared for him.",
        "Jack: That's why we have to gather around. If we're not united on this --",
        "Carly: Well, we're not. I want him home. You bring him home.",
        "Jack: I can't.",
        "Carly: You mean you won't.",
        "Jack: I can't. I don't know who our son is anymore.",
        "Carly: Don't say that.",
        "Jack: Parker stood before that judge today and he twisted the truth around to get what he wanted.",
        "Carly: What he said, I was standing right there --",
        "Jack: Did you see his face afterwards? He was proud of himself! He thinks he out-smarted us! I'm not going to reward behavior like that.",
        "Carly: You want me to turn my back on my son? I won't do that. And if he comes home --",
        "Jack: If he comes home, if he walks through that door and you cave, he's going to think he's won. Is that what you want? You can't beat me this time, Carly.",
        "Carly: He is my baby.",
        "Jack: You keep thinking like that, it's just going to get worse.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Jack: You're scared that's Parker out there. I'm scared of who he's become in here.",
        "Carly: Excuse me?",
        "Jack: I don't want Parker turning into someone who thinks it's okay to lie and manipulate as long as it works out in his favor, someone who doesn't even care that his actions hurt the people who love him the most, because if he keeps that up, Carly, if he keeps it up, it's just going to backfire. And he's going to end up -- he's going to end up alone.",
        "Carly: He's going to end up like me. You think that I've taught our son bad habits, and now he's becoming the same terrible person that his mother is.",
        "Jack: I never said that.",
        "Carly: You didn't have to. I can see it in the way you look at him.",
        "Jack: That is not true.",
        "Carly: Isn't it? Isn't that really the big fear, Jack that Parker's going to grow up to be just like me?",
        "Jack: Stop it.",
        "Carly: I'm a liar and a thief -- an adulteress. And he's so young and impressionable. What could I possibly do but ruin his life? Thank God he's got you to save him from that hideous fate.",
        "Jack: You don't think I know I'm as much to blame for this mess as anyone? The kid needs a wake-up call, Carly. He's got to get it through his head that he's not ready for this, to be an adult, to be a husband, to be fully responsible for not only his own life, but the life of someone else.",
        "Carly: But you think this is the way to get that through to him?",
        "Jack: Yes, what happens when he realizes he doesn't have anyplace to go? Maybe then he'll see we're not the bad guys that he thinks we are.",
        "Carly: Or maybe he'll see we're the people who left him on the street.",
        "Jack: Somebody has to draw the line, Carly.",
        "Carly: I'm not drawing the line, Jack. You're building a wall. You're walking away! What kind of example are you setting for your son now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Let me help you. You're carrying precious cargo in there. Let's get this on you.",
        "Katie: If you need anything, let us know. Don't hesitate.",
        "Vienna: Don't worry, he'll take excellent care of me, whatever I need.",
        "Henry: That's how I roll. Ready to go.",
        "Katie: Thank you does not even begin to scratch the surface.",
        "Vienna: It's my greatest pleasure.",
        "Brad: I told you.",
        "Katie: I can't believe it.",
        "Brad: We're going to have a baby.",
        "Katie: Well, you and Vienna are having a baby. I'm just kind of along for the ride at this point.",
        "Brad: No, no. What are you talking about? We've already been through this.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Brad: It's our baby, no one else's.",
        "Katie: Seeing Vienna and knowing she's pregnant now --",
        "Brad: She's carrying our baby for us. It's done, all right? No one's going to be here tomorrow except for you.",
        "Katie: I am going to be a mom.",
        "Brad: Yes. Yes, you are.",
        "Katie: Still, I wish I could experience what she's going through right now, you know? Even the morning sickness, cravings, feeling the baby grow inside me.",
        "Brad: You know, there's another way to look at it, which I think is better, you know, this way, you have all the gain with no pain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, well, well. Mr. and Mrs. Snyder. Allow me to be the first to congratulate you on your recent nuptials.",
        "Parker: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: I'm walking home, Parker.",
        "Parker: Are you following us?",
        "Craig: Sorry to disappoint.",
        "Liberty: Are you going to tell our parents that you ran into us?",
        "Craig: No, not if you don't want me to. Though after what I've just witnessed, I'm happy to step out of the line of fire.",
        "Liberty: What happened after we left?",
        "Craig: Yelling. Lots of yelling.",
        "Parker: It didn't have to be that way. We love each other and there's no reason why we shouldn't be together. No one can stop us.",
        "Craig: I think we all know you didn't do this just because you're in love. You did this because you wanted to get back at your parents.",
        "Parker: I needed to stop them from using my trust fund to send me to a boarding school when I don't want to go.",
        "Craig: Well, congratulations, I think you're off the hook for that, at least for now. But the burning question is, where do you go from here?",
        "Liberty: We're actually trying to figure that one out right now.",
        "Craig: Do you have any money at all?",
        "Parker: Yeah, we've got $30. You know, that actually may be enough for a hotel room at the Wagon Wheel Motel.",
        "Liberty: Oh, good.",
        "Craig: Not if you were even paying by the hour. For Pete's sake. Okay, grab a bag, you're coming with me.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Craig: Consider it my wedding present. It's likely the only one you'll get. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I have an idea. Why don't you and I take a little trip together? Just a little --",
        "Katie: A trip?",
        "Brad: Yeah, a romantic trip away. Just the two of us, before things get, you know, crazy.",
        "Katie: Brad, Vienna's carrying our child. We went passed crazy about one lab and two petri dishes ago.",
        "Brad: True. True.",
        "Katie: I don't want to hurt your feelings. I just don't want to go.",
        "Brad: You don't?",
        "Katie: Not right now. I want to be here, to be around Vienna as much as possible.",
        "Brad: Okay. How about a compromise?",
        "Katie: A compromise?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: You must be serious.",
        "Brad: Oh, I am. We can get one of the suites at the Lakeview for the weekend, yeah? This way, we could still have alone time, but Henry and Vienna would be right down the hall.",
        "Katie: You'd do that for me?",
        "Brad: In a heartbeat. Where are you going?",
        "Katie: To reserve our room at the Lakeview.",
        "Brad: Janet.",
        "Janet: Is Liberty here?",
        "Brad: No, she said she was spending the day with you.",
        "Janet: That was just a cover. She told you she was spending the day with me and she told me she was with you looking at colleges.",
        "Brad: Are you saying you don't know where she went?",
        "Janet: No, I know where she went. I don't know where she is now.",
        "Katie: Is Liberty okay?",
        "Janet: No, she's not. She and Parker --",
        "Brad: Parker? Parker's involved? What did he do to her this time?",
        "Janet: He married her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I don't like this any better than you.",
        "Carly: Then do something about it!",
        "Jack: I can't! He doesn't want to be here, Carly.",
        "Carly: He chose to leave! You threw him out!",
        "Jack: He was fighting me on it.",
        "Carly: Well, you were acting like a tyrant. I swear, Jack, if something happens to him because of this, I will never forgive you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Married?",
        "Janet: Okay, before you start flipping out --",
        "Brad: Oh, I'm way beyond flipping out now! How could you let this happen?",
        "Janet: Me?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Janet: She lives under your roof, too.",
        "Brad: Well, under my roof, there is a no-Parker zone. Can you say the same?",
        "Katie: So, Jack just threw them out?",
        "Janet: Yeah, without giving us a chance to talk to them.",
        "Katie: What happens when you call Liberty's phone?",
        "Janet: She's not answering her phone.",
        "Brad: Didn't Jack take care of this? Isn't he sending Parker off to boarding school?",
        "Janet: That's how this whole thing blew up. Parker refused to go.",
        "Brad: Oh, he's going to want to go now because he's going to want to get as far away from me as he can.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. What are you doing?",
        "Brad: I'm going to find him and put him in the ground.",
        "Katie: No, you're not. You're going to stay here and think about this and calm down for a second.",
        "Brad: Don't tell me to calm down. I can't calm down about this.",
        "Janet: What is wrong with you and your brother is this.",
        "Brad: What's wrong? Our kids just got married. Married. God help me if he gets her pregnant.",
        "Janet: Okay, right. That's how the way we handle this situation from now on is so important. Because if they're out there all by themselves with no one to turn to but each other --",
        "Brad: Okay. Okay. Okay, what do you want me to do?",
        "Janet: I just -- I want you to be her dad. Can you do that?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Janet: You'd better.",
        "Katie: Are you okay, Janet?",
        "Janet: No. I can't -- it's the way Jack reacted.",
        "Katie: Well, how did he react?",
        "Janet: Pretty much the same way my parents reacted when they found out I was pregnant. They left me to fend for myself, and boy, did I do a bang-up job of that, all right? I was too young to know what I was doing, but I acted like I didn't care. I just needed them so badly. I've got to go.",
        "Katie: Listen, if Liberty calls, we'll let you know right away.",
        "Janet: Okay. Please, tell her I love her and she that she's still my baby girl.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Okay. What are you doing?",
        "Henry: Don't tell me you've forgotten my signature move.",
        "Vienna: No, I know what you're doing. But we can't. Get off the bed.",
        "Henry: What? Why?",
        "Vienna: Because of Sven.",
        "Henry: Sven the sigoat?",
        "Vienna: Don't call the baby names.",
        "Henry: What's going on here?",
        "Vienna: I'm just worried that love-making will hurt the baby.",
        "Henry: I'm afraid that not making love will hurt me.",
        "Vienna: Henry, you're an adult.",
        "Henry: Yes. With some very adult needs.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry, but right now we need to put the baby first.",
        "Henry: For how long? You're going to be pregnant for nine months!",
        "Vienna: I know, and it's going to be so wonderful!",
        "Henry: Not if it's going to be like this.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Henry: You promised me nothing was going to change for us.",
        "Vienna: Well, nothing has changed.",
        "Henry: We're not making love. As far as I'm concerned, that's the biggest change there is!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Who was that?",
        "Jack: I was trying to call Janet.",
        "Carly: I wonder if she found the kids yet.",
        "Jack: I don't know. I just wanted to see if she was okay.",
        "Carly: Right. Who cares where your son is when your wife is mad at you?",
        "Jack: For your information, she's mad at me for the same reasons you are.",
        "Carly: She's showing the same fear and anxiety I am, not knowing where our children are.",
        "Jack: And I'm not? I'm just a heartless ass? That threw them out?",

        "Carly: What do you want?",
        "Craig: Well, after I left, I ran into the kids in Old Town and I got them a room at the Lakeview. Carly?",
        "Carly: Yeah?",
        "Craig: I thought you should know that they were okay.",

        "Jack: We're still a family. What do you think I'm fighting so hard to hold on to?",
        "Carly: Where's this family, I'd like to know. It's not here. It's gone?",
        "Jack: It's not gone. Things have changed, yeah. We've changed. But I will always love what we share with these kids. Parker and J.J. and Sage. They mean everything to me.",
        "Carly: And me?",
        "Jack: We're always going to be have that connection, you know that.",
        "Carly: Even though you hate me.",

        "Liberty: And risk running into my mom? I don't think so.",
        "Parker: We could go down to the lounge, but that's kind of expensive.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, and I guess room service is out of the question.",
        "Parker: What about the mini bar?",
        "Liberty: Parker, the mini bar is like the lounge times ten.",
        "Parker: But Craig's paying for the room, and that covers the mini bar, right?",
        "Liberty: Right. I don't feel comfortable taking advantage of him like that.",
        "Parker: We're not. I don't think Craig would want us to go hungry. I'm just going to check.",
        "Liberty: All right. Go for it. Parker Parker, don't. Please put that back.",

        "Janet: How could you not tell him?",
        "Carly: Do you really want him going over there now the way he's acting? I don't want him scaring those kids off again.",
        "Janet: I don't want that either.",

        "Janet: Carly, are you -- are you asking me not to tell Jack about this?",
        "Carly: He's your husband, Janet. You do what you think is best. I just thought you'd want to know where your daughter is.",

        "Katie: You're her father. Of course she'll come to you. You love her and she knows that.",
        "Brad: She knows how I feel about Parker.",
        "Katie: Well, Parker's not on the top of anyone's list right now.",
        "Brad: But I'm going to lie her. I'm going to tell her exactly how I feel about what she's done. I'm going to listen to her. At least I'll try.",
        "Katie: Sometimes that's all you can do.",
        "Brad: I should be able to do more.",
        "Katie: Maybe doing more isn't how you deal with Parker.",

        "Jack: They're on to us. Liberty stood right here and she lied to you.",
        "Janet: I know what she did.",
        "Jack: Everything we ever gave them, all the love, everything we ever taught them, they threw in our faces today. Is that how you raised your daughter to be? Because I know damn well that's not how I raised my son.",
        "Janet: Okay, okay, they lied to us and they went behind our backs and made a huge mistake, but we can't abandon them!",
        "Jack: I'm not. I'm not abandoning them.",

        "Craig: Why are you mad at me?",
        "Carly: Don't act like you don't know. I had the phone in my hand. I was going to call Jack and tell him what those kids were doing and you stopped me.",

        "Vienna: But Henry, she likes you. She loves your wavy brown hair and the arch of your eyebrow and your sexy shoulders and it makes her want you really, really, really bad.",
        "Henry: But her virtue -- but her virtue.",
        "Vienna: Oh, virtue's easily can be compromised. There are ways around it.",
        "Henry: Wait, what ways?",
