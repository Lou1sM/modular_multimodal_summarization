        "Will: Gwen, it's not our kitchen.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but they're our dirty dishes. Oh, hey, look what I found while I was cleaning out the closets. You used to play with dolls.",
        "Will: They're not dolls. They're action figures.",
        "Gwen: Uh-huh.",
        "Will: Gwen, just slow down, okay?",
        "Gwen: What's going on with you?",
        "Will: Nothing, nothing. That's the problem.",
        "Gwen: You know, a new one of these comes tomorrow.",
        "Will: Yeah, just another perk of living with Dad.",
        "Gwen: What, there's something wrong with getting the newspaper delivered?",
        "Will: No, it's not the newspaper or the dishwasher or the big screen TV. Why are you smiling?",
        "Gwen: No, because it's a really -- it's a big screen. Hand me that. I want to finish up.",
        "Will: No, I'll do it. Let me do it. I'll clean up.",

        "Will: And then what?",
        "Gwen: We eat it.",
        "Will: No, I mean after we have to go back to living without all this stuff. 'Cause it's easy to get used to, you know, for me, too, but we don't belong here. I don't want you tricking yourself into believing we do.",

        "Henry: Well, here's your opportunity to be the bigger person, Emily, and walk away. You can say bad things behind their back.",

        "Paul: I just need to get some information, Hal.",
        "Hal: Then talk to your lawyer.",
        "Paul: Look, the evidence against Meg, it'll never fly in court, right?",

        "Meg: What interest are they charging?",
        "Emma: It doesn't -- it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. You're home now.",
        "Meg: You know, I remember when you and Daddy paid off this place. He was so proud. You worked your whole lives to own the farm.",
        "Emma: He would want me to do this.",
        "Meg: So you can pay for my lawyer?",
        "Emma: For our daughter's future, that's what.",
        "Meg: You know, um, all I can think of right now is a long, hot soak in that claw foot tub upstairs.",

        "Jade: Please, just let me explain.",
        "Lily: I was gone. I was gone, so you decided to make your move.",
        "Luke: No, no, it's not like that.",
        "Jade: It wasn't like that.",
        "Lily: Did you know? Did you know? Did you know that I was out of town?",
        "Jade: Know what?",
        "Lily: Did you know that I was at the orphanage? And you decided to use my son as insurance?",
        "Luke: Mom, she's not -- she's not using me.",
        "Jade: No, that's not how it is.",
        "Lily: She's a liar. She's a con artist. She's --",
        "Luke: Mom, that's enough.",
        "Lily: She is not Rose's daughter. She's lied about that, she lied about everything.",
        "Jade: Please, just let me explain to you.",
        "Lily: How could you do this? How could you use my precious memories of my sister against me? How could you steal from me? Why didn't you take the bracelet, as much money as you could and just run away? What else do you want from us?",
        "Jade: Nothing! Everything that I did, I did it out of love. I didn't do anything to hurt you, I swear. I just wanted to \u0096",
        "[Lily smacks Jade]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You have me. You have my confession. Why do you keep harassing Meg for something that she had no part of?",
        "Hal: How many reasons do you want?",
        "Paul: Why can't you just let her get on with her life?",
        "Hal: Like Jen and Emily? You know, thanks to you, a lot of people aren't having it very easy getting on with their lives, especially the people you're supposed to love. Even Will.",
        "Paul: Why? What happened to Will?",
        "Hal: He married Gwen. She was raising a child she thought was hers, thanks to you. Will stood by her. Now he thinks he can't live without her. So they found a judge to marry them, and now it's the two of them against the world. Sounds kind of like the same crock you sold Emily. That had a real happy ending, didn't it?",
        "Paul: Will is -- is married?",
        "Hal: Before he even graduated high school. So add your kid brother to the list of lives you've managed to ruin. Congratulations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: My dad sat there and I sat here, and you're sitting where Mom used to sit. And Jen, when she was home, sat there.",
        "Gwen: Wow. The whole family at the table every night. Iris was a big fan of TV trays.",
        "Will: TV trays were completely illegal in Barbara's house.",
        "Gwen: Was it hard for you when she left?",
        "Will: Yeah, at first. Then Emily moved in, and then it was cool for a while. She made it like a family again. Daniel and Parker were running around everywhere. It was great. You know, it was always great for a while.",
        "Gwen: It sounds like your dad tried.",
        "Will: Yeah, he always tries. But there's cracks, you know? And you just don't see it because they're buried under passing the potatoes and crayon drawings on the fridge. But they're there, just waiting to open wide and swallow you up.",
        "Gwen: I don't really understand that last part.",
        "Will: Don't try.",
        "Gwen: Well, I want to, it's just -- there's a bunch of stuff I don't know.",
        "Will: Don't think that we can be happy here, okay? No one can be happy here.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I gotta think for myself.",
        "Will: I'm sorry. I just sounded like my dad.",
        "Gwen: I don't think your dad's such a bad guy.",
        "Will: Yeah, he didn't used to be, not always, you know? Especially when he was with Emily. He used to be able to be happy for other people.",
        "Gwen: Well, he's letting us stay here.",
        "Will: Yeah, and a couple weeks ago, he let us sleep out on the street. What's that tell you about him? His rent for living under his roof is control. You know, he might do it with a pat on the back or a couple extra bucks in your pocket for gas, but he just wants me to live life his way, not mine, and be on his side, not Mom's.",
        "Gwen: Are there always sides?",
        "Will: Yeah, always. Which is why I need you to promise me that the only side you'll ever be on is mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Keep your voice down! I never said a name.",
        "Henry: Well, who else have you seen kissing Paul Ryan?",
        "Emily: Do you want your money, huh? Or are you gonna start lecturing me on the evils of revenge, Henry?",
        "Henry: No, wait a second. I have a healthy respect for revenge. When you and I, remember, put Babs Ryan in that cottage in the woods? I was the trigger man with the water gun. Hmm?",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, this time, I need something more than water in the gun.",
        "Henry: And you want me to pull the trigger?",
        "Emily: You do this, you won't regret it. Execute this one little detail, and you will be swimming in cash, Henry!",
        "Henry: Execute, that's such a -- that's such a fascinating choice of words, Emily.",
        "Maddie: Yeah. Who's executing what around here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So when did the lawyer call?",
        "Emma: Well, he called just before you came in. So do you -- do you want to tell me why Dusty's blood was on your gloves?",
        "Meg: The important thing is they can't use that against me. There was a breach in procedure when the police searched my room.",
        "Emma: It doesn't change the truth, Meg.",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: What do you want me to say, Mama? Paul already confessed to Dusty's murder.",
        "Emma: Suppose Tom thinks that Paul had help, and he starts to look for more evidence.",
        "Meg: He can look all he wants.",
        "Emma: Suppose he looks at the bridge?",
        "Meg: Nobody knows that.",
        "Emma: I know.",
        "Meg: Mama, you have to trust me.",
        "Emma: Sweetheart, that goes both ways. Look, I know that you're probably exhausted, and your mind just can't get past that hot tub up there, but -- I am really, really, really scared for you.",
        "Meg: Well, don't be scared.",
        "Emma: Well then, will you please tell me what you -- what you have to do with Dusty Donovan's death? I promise, Meg. I promise, I will not judge you.",
        "Meg: The problem is, the more you know, the more I hurt you, and I don't want that.",
        "Emma: Meg, did you hear -- did you hear what I said? I said I won't judge you. Meg, I love you.",
        "Meg: I love you too, Mama, but you just can't fix this.",
        "Emma: Meg, listen, ever since you were a little girl -- I mean, you brought every wounded bird to that door, every wounded animal. I mean, when you were 10 years old, all you talked about was saving -- saving the whales. I mean, there is no one with a more kinder, loving heart than you have. But you are not a little girl any longer! You just can't go out there and save every lost soul. And particularly not Paul Ryan's. Nobody can do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Mom, leave her alone.",
        "Lily: I want you to get out.",
        "Luke: Stop it.",
        "Jade: Please, Lily, I wanted to tell you.",
        "Lily: But what? You were too busy stealing from me, the way you stole from those nuns that tried to raise you? Yes, you stole money from nuns.",
        "Jade: No, it wasn't like that.",
        "Lily: I spoke to Sister Elizabeth, Jade.",
        "Jade: That woman hates me.",
        "Lily: She's a nun. There are rules about hating. But I'm a mother. I don't have to play by those rules. I want you out.",
        "Luke: Mom, Mom, Mom, you have no idea what you're talking about.",
        "Lily: I do know what I'm talking about. She has lied. The papers that said that she's Rose's daughter, she stole them, the way she stole the money from the nuns.",
        "Holden: What is going on in here?",
        "Lily: What does it look like? I found them in bed together. This girl seduced our son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Maddie, I can't believe you and I haven't gotten to know each other.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Henry's told me so much about you.",
        "Henry: I have?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Henry: I have!",
        "Emily: Yeah, and -- you're just adorable. She has your smile, Henry. Anyway, I'd love to take you to dinner. Maybe the three of us can go? You go to Oakdale Latin, right?",
        "Henry: Yeah, she sure does. And I bet she's got a lot of homework to do. Did you get the rest of the stuff put upstairs?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, no drawer space.",
        "Henry: Just shove my stuff underneath the bed, okay?",
        "Maddie: The bed --",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Maddie: That's another thing. Where am I supposed to sleep?",
        "Henry: We'll get a cot.",
        "Maddie: Can't. Fire restrictions. I already asked.",
        "Henry: Okay, then we'll get a bigger room. Could you excuse us for just a minute?",
        "Emily: Sure, family first.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Hi, I need to upgrade to a larger room. It's Coleman, Room 624.",
        "Desk clerk: Of course, Mr. Coleman.",
        "Henry: Yeah. See, we'll just get a couple of doubles there, and then we'll double the closet space, we'll double the drawer space --",
        "Desk clerk: No, we're pretty full. I have a couple of five star rooms. They're suites, one and two bedroom.",
        "Henry: Oh, I wasn't planning on spending that much.",
        "Emily: Excuse me, could we have just a little sidebar?",
        "Henry: I'm busy right now.",
        "Emily: It won't take but a moment. You could be living in the penthouse, Henry, if you do this one little favor for me.",
        "Maddie: Penthouse? Henry, we're moving into the penthouse? How'd you pull that one off?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I'm on your side, and you know that. It's just the way that I see it, not everybody in your family is off-the-wall.",
        "Will: Yes, they are.",
        "Gwen: No, not Johnny. I still can't believe how big he got.",
        "Will: Yeah, he sure did.",
        "Gwen: And he looked at me the way that he used to.",
        "Will: Well, that's because he loves you.",
        "Gwen: And when I tickled him under his chin, he made that weird sound that he used to make. It's like not quite a laugh, but almost. And if we weren't here, we would've missed that.",
        "Will: Okay, okay, so you're right. There's good things about being here. But I just -- I want you to keep your guard up, okay?",
        "Gwen: Will do, Will.",
        "Will: Because you know, not everyone in the crew is so cuddly. They surround you, and then they start squeezing the life out of you.",
        "Gwen: Well, you have sole squeezing rights on this body. Besides, I'm not afraid of a little dysfunction.",
        "Will: That's famous last words.",
        "Gwen: You want to go watch that movie?",
        "Will: Why don't we skip the movie?",
        "Gwen: I made popcorn.",
        "Will: You can bring the popcorn. We might work up an appetite.",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Gwen: No. Whoa, don't answer that.",
        "Will: It could be about a job. Hello?",
        "Paul: Will, it's me. I have less than a minute, so don't hang up.",

        "Emma: I am begging you, Meg, you have to start thinking of yourself.",
        "Meg: I am.",
        "Emma: But you're holding back evidence?",
        "Meg: It's not my job to help the police figure out the case.",
        "Emma: Did Paul Ryan tell you that? It is your job to do the right thing. I raised you to know that.",
        "Meg: I do.",
        "Emma: Then how can you stand there and expect me to accept that Paul Ryan's confession is the end of things, when both you and I know it isn't. You know, I -- I cannot get that night on the bridge out of my mind.",
        "Meg: And I wish that you really hadn't been there.",
        "Emma: Yeah, well, I was. And I must tell you something, i feel so guilty. I feel like I am hiding this horrible secret.",
        "Meg: How many times can I say I'm sorry, Mama?",
        "Emma: Look, Meg, if you won't talk to me -- if you won't talk to me, just I'll tell you -- just, just, just call the lawyer here. Just call the lawyer and tell him what you know. I'm sure he's still in his office. Here.",
        "Meg: I'll call him tomorrow.",
        "Emma: No, no, no, you call him now. He's right there. I just spoke --",
        "Meg: Mama, stop treating me like a child!",
        "Emma: Then you stop acting like one! Not talking, and you're pushing things aside as if they don't exist, as if they could just disappear. Meg, just call -- call the lawyer and tell him that you're ready to make a deal to convict Paul Ryan.",
        "Meg: You want me to turn on Paul?",
        "Emma: I am sure that -- I am sure that Tom will give you your freedom in exchange for putting Paul Ryan behind bars once and for all.",

        "Gwen: Yeah, every word.",
        "Will: So Paul's got nothing to say that I want to hear.",
        "Gwen: Well, maybe he has something to say that Jen wants to hear. Look, she said something before, and I can't get out of my mind, all right? She said that she feels the same way about Dusty that she did about Johnny -- that he's still out there, that he's still alive.",
        "Will: Just because she was right about the baby doesn't mean she's right about Dusty.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but if Paul knows something, then it's worth a try. I'll come with you.",

        "Jade: Look, it's not what you think. I care about Luke.",
        "Holden: You two, get it together. We'll meet you downstairs.",
        "Jade: That was perfect. And your dad's timing -- it was great.",
        "Luke: I can't do this.",
        "Jade: What do you mean? It's working.",
        "Luke: No. No, when we go downstairs and -- I'm gonna tell my parents the truth, about everything.",

        "Maddie: Can I just borrow him, just for a second? Thank you very much.",
        "Emily: Oh, sure, just make sure you bring him back.",
        "Maddie: What is her deal?",
        "Henry: What do you mean, \"Her deal\"?",
        "Maddie: She has this weird look in her eye. You know, there are certain women who seem to be able to get guys to do their dirty work for them. Is that what's happening here? Has Emily gotten you mixed up in something that you shouldn't be mixed up in, Henry?",
        "Henry: No, no, no, of course not.",
        "Maddie: Then why did she say that you can get the penthouse?",
        "Henry: She thinks big.",
        "Maddie: Did you tell her about B.J.'s money?",
        "Henry: No, no, shh, no.",
        "Maddie: What did I -- I told you --",
        "Henry: You told me not to touch a dime. And you can trust me, I have not touched anything.",
        "Maddie: Well, then why is she saying that you can afford the most expensive room here?",
        "Henry: Because she was trying to get me to take a job at this tabloid that she works for from time to time.",
        "Maddie: Oh, yeah? When she's not in jail? Henry, I read the papers. I know this woman has a whole lot of history.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Henry: Don't worry about Emily, okay? Go ahead and answer that, and keep an eye on your minutes.",
        "Maddie: I'm under.",
        "Henry: They kill you with the overcharges. Just take it. I'll take care of her.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, your trouble is, you have a thing for blondes.",
        "Henry: Yeah, not since my 12-step. It's just brunettes and redheads from now on. Will you answer that?",
        "Maddie: Okay! I'll be right back.",
        "Emily: Well, she seems like a great kid.",
        "Henry: She's a smart kid, Emily, and she sees right through you like cheap cellophane. Now, I do not have a dark side, and I don't want to be any part of yours. If you want to put out a hit out on Meg, you call the mob. And if you ever reveal any of your twisted schemes in front of my little sister again, I will call the mob myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You don't know what you're asking.",
        "Emma: I am asking you to tell the truth.",
        "Meg: No, you are asking me to bargain for my freedom by hammering nails into Paul Ryan's coffin when I haven't been charged with anything yet.",
        "Emma: No, not yet -- not yet.",
        "Meg: Everything I did was my choice, mama, not Paul's.",
        "Emma: Meg -- Meg, I raised you to stand on your own two feet, to take pride in what you do and to know that your life could be complete without a man in it. I just wish that someone would explain to me how a strong, independent women like you just falls apart at the seams the minute someone like Paul Ryan comes into their lives. What kind of a hold does this man have on you?",
        "[Meg remembering]",
        "Paul: As long as you don't say anything, nobody can hurt you.",
        "Meg: You know, maybe you should start taking your own advice.",
        "Paul: Me? I'll be fine. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Meg: I hope so. Did you mean any of those beautiful words you just said?",
        "Emma: Yes, you know I did. I meant every single word, my precious girl, yes.",
        "Meg: Then why do I still see that disappointment in your eyes?",
        "Emma: Oh, sweetheart, because you need -- you need to take responsibility for what -- for what's happened, for what you've done so you can make things right. You need to.",
        "Meg: One thing, Mama -- one last thing, okay? Just believe in me, trust that what I'm doing is the right thing.",
        "Emma: What, for Paul Ryan, or for yourself?",
        "Meg: I'm going upstairs.",

        "Paul: Hal, with his usual charm. Gwen, I'm really glad you're here, too. I've always -- I've always really liked you.",
        "Will: Paul, what the hell do you want?",
        "Paul: Nothing.",
        "Will: Well, then we're leaving.",
        "Paul: Will, no, don't. Wait.",
        "Will: For what?",
        "Paul: I want to give you two a wedding present.",
        "Will: I'm not interested.",
        "Paul: You're broke, aren't you?",
        "Will: Everybody knows I'm broke.",
        "Paul: Barbara circling?",

        "Paul: I can help, you know.",
        "Will: Here we go.",
        "Paul: No, look, I'm not -- I'm not trying to play you, all right? I can't -- I can't do that from in here, at least.",
        "Will: And how do I know that?",
        "Paul: Will, I just -- I want to give the two of you a gift. I am going to take all of my assets and release them to you, both of you, right now -- well, not now. I mean, as soon as my fancy lawyer can do something like that.",
        "Will: What, are you buying a character witness?",
        "Paul: No. You don't ever have to see me again, in or out of court.",
        "Gwen: Right.",
        "Paul: Look, I could apologize to you, and you, and everybody, Jennifer, for the rest of my life, and it wouldn't change anything. But money changes everything. It'll give you a place of your own and buy an education, put a little food on the table.",
        "Will: No, I think we'll manage.",
        "Paul: Manage? Come on, don't you want more out of life than just managing? I'm offering you freedom, Will. Freedom from me, from Hal, from Barbara. You know she's never gonna let up on you two. You know that.",
        "Will: You won't let up! You kill Jen's boyfriend, and then you expect me to feel good about taking your money? I'm not for sale!",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Will! You of all people, you know that the sky sometimes falls, all right? And sometimes brothers -- they lie to brothers. And sometimes family is just really a fancy word for betrayal. But look at me. I'm not going to be able to hurt you or anybody else for a long, long time, okay? That's kind of the whole point of jail, and I'm going away for a long time. And you two -- you have shot at having a really good life together, and I would like to help you. So don't be an idiot. Take the money.",

        "Holden: Here you go.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you. This water's not going to stop me from being angry. You warned me. You knew something was off, but I was so caught up in missing rose -- how pathetic is that?",
        "Holden: Why didn't you tell me that you were going to the orphanage?",
        "Lily: I didn't want you to talk me out of it.",
        "Holden: Where is Rose's daughter, this Theresa.",
        "Lily: I have no idea. But now, I can't even think about that until I deal with what's going on right under my roof. Your son is having sex, Holden, with a girl that obviously does not care about him or anybody else but herself. This is not what we wanted for our son.",
        "Holden: You know what, Jade said that she could explain. How, I don't know. But let's just hear what she has to say.",
        "Lily: The only thing I have to say to her is good-bye.",
        "Jade: You were great just now. I almost believed we had sex.",
        "Luke: This is wrong.",
        "Jade: Yeah, a lot of things are wrong. Like treating your kid like he's a freak of nature because of how he's wired differently. That's wrong. Did you see your dad's face just now? He was relieved.",
        "Luke: You don't know that.",
        "Jade: I'm telling you, I saw it. I mean, part of him was mad, but part of him -- it was like he had gotten an answer to a question he's been asking for so long.",
        "Luke: Whatever. My mom's a different story.",
        "Jade: Yeah, maybe, but he calmed her down. She listens to him. He's on our side. And we can get him to stay that way. Just don't cave. I'm not going to force you.",
        "Luke: Jade, what do you get out of this?",
        "Jade: You know what I get out of this. Life with a real family.",
        "Luke: A real family? My mother hates you.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but she loves you. She wants you to be happy. And if that means keeping me around, your dad will talk her into it.",
        "Luke: For how long?",
        "Jade: For as long as you want. Think about it, I'm a living, breathing alibi. As long as your parents think that we're hooking up, you can have a life of your own. A private life on your own terms.",
        "Luke: By lying? That --",
        "Jade: You don't want to lie? Then why don't you just tell your parents that you're gay. Or, you know, keep doing what you're doing. Good luck with the whole straight thing. Look, whatever you do, Luke, just be happy.",
        "Luke: What's happy?",
        "Jade: Being with the person that you love.",

        "Henry: You're calling me dramatic?",
        "Emily: Will you just admit it? Without me, your life would be a bore.",
        "Henry: It would be a filthy rich bore.",
        "Emily: Well, after I hand over the cash, believe me, you'll miss our little visits.",
        "Henry: I'll miss you like a bad rash, Emily. Look, repeat after me. Prison is bad. Freedom is good.",
        "Emily: No, no, you repeat after me. Poverty is bad. Money is good.",
        "Henry: Then show me the money, Emily. Until then, I'm not swatting a fly. It's my money, anyway. I earned it.",
        "Emily: You stole it.",
        "Henry: From a bigger screwball than you.",
        "Emily: You know what, I may be a screwball, but who's sleeping on the floor tonight, big brother?",
        "Henry: You think you want this thing done, but you don't have it in you, okay? Now, a crime of passion when you're jilted at the altar? That's one thing. But this is something completely different. You know what, give yourself a spa day. Massage those demons out of that muscle tissue. Maybe some eucalyptus aromatherapy -- I love that. And take some deep breaths. In, out. In, out. Yeah? Relax.",
        "Emily: I'll take care of it myself.",

        "Emma: You look very happy here. Both of you.",
        "Meg: We were. I had just trapped Dusty under the mistletoe, and he kissed me. Wouldn't stop. And Luke was trying out his new camera and he caught us red- handed.",
        "Emma: Do you still love him?",
        "Meg: Can you stop loving somebody?",
        "Emma: If you fall in love with someone else.",
        "Meg: I can't go back, Mama. I can't undo what I did. I can't change the choices I made.",
        "Emma: But you can be Dusty's voice. I mean, no matter what happened between you, does Dusty deserve justice?",
        "Meg: Yeah, of course he does. I'm just not sure I can give it to him.",

        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Jade: Okay. So let's go rock this thing.",
        "Holden: I think we just need to try and be unemotional about this. If we take a hard line and Luke cares about this girl --",

        "Holden: I'm not. I'm just trying to remember that kids make mistakes.",

        "Will: No, that's the deal, Paul. You can take it or leave it. See, I told you. If we take a dime, then he owns us. He controls our future.",
