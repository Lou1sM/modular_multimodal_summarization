        "Emily catches Susan with Dusty and is angry that she is trying to interfere in her life. Faith and Parker worry when they can't reach anyone to find out about Ethan. Lily pops more pills as she nervously waits by Ethan's side. Bob wants Lily to make a list of what she has fed Ethan in the last couple of days. Bob admits that Ethan's kidney's are failing. Paul is sure the jars of baby food are contaminated, and he and Meg rush to throw them away. Craig thinks they are insane, but Meg takes Paul's side. Meg asks a nurse to have a jar of baby food tested. Paul and Meg go to talk with Faith and Parker. Bob hears about Meg's idea to have the jars tested and agrees, but Lily thinks it is crazy. Holden arrives at the hospital frantic after hearing the message about Ethan. An overwrought Lily admits that Ethan's kidneys are failing. Emily tells Susan that she is working undercover in the sex trade doing a story for the Intruder. Susan is very upset and lashes out at Dusty. Dusty doesn't share the real story with Susan, which Emily later thanks him for. Dusty doesn't want anything to do with Emily anymore; she has made her choice and he has made his; they will work different shifts and he will be selling the Intruder. Faith and Parker attempt to hitchhike but don't get far; Meg and Paul admonish them for this, but then tell them their news on Ethan. Faith is really upset, but Meg and Paul work together to comfort her. More sick babies arrive at the hospital. Bob tells the women and Lily that the jars of baby food tested positive for E. Coli. Lily is stunned and the women blame Lily. Reporters surprise Dusty about the E. Coli news. He calls Lily and strongly suggests that she get to the office to answer the questions. Holden tells Lily that she has to do that because people trusted them and the product and they all needs answers. Craig offers his support to Lily. Parker tries to comfort Faith. Emily has a \u0091date' with a John, who wants to watch a bootlegged video while acting out the scenes. Emily is rocked to her core when she sees the woman's face in the sex video; it is Allison. Paul admits that he wouldn't change what he has done in the past, but he intends on embracing these visions because they protect Meg and her loved ones. Dusty shows evidence to Lily that the women who run Valley's Best Baby food are involved with a Company that has been sited for several health code violations. Lily is distraught. Paul explains that if he and Meg never get back together, it will be enough for him to protect Meg through his visions. Meg is touched by his words and soon they are in each other's arms kissing."

        "Susan: You have to try to get through to her. I can't!",
        "Dusty: Neither can I. She made it very clear to me that she can take care of herself.",
        "Susan: Oh, then you have talked to her?",
        "Dusty: Susan, I have to stay out of this.",
        "Susan: You've noticed something. What else do you know? Tell me, please.",
        "Emily: What are you doing here?",
        "Susan: Nice outfit. Is that what all hard-working reporters wear these days?",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: This from the woman who thinks wearing scrubs is making a fashion statement? What are you guys talking about? Let me guess, me?",
        "Dusty: I've got work to do.",
        "Emily: Were you grilling him, huh? That's nice.",
        "Susan: Do you think I like going behind your back?",
        "Emily: I think with Hal gone, Dusty's your new go-to guy when you don't approve of how I'm living my life.",
        "Susan: I'm worried about you. And you can start by telling me why you're dressed like a --",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, like a what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Where's Ethan's blanket? It was down here.",
        "Parker: I don't know. Faith, wait. What are you doing?",
        "Faith: It's for when he gets back. I want him to have his stuff. We did the right thing, didn't we? I mean, Paul, he's okay. He wouldn't --",
        "Parker: He wouldn't kidnap your brother, okay? No matter what your mother said, Paul is trying to keep Ethan from getting hurt.",
        "Faith: But we did let him take the baby, and he didn't tell us where he was going. And my dad doesn't trust him.",
        "Parker: Paul knows what he's doing.",
        "Faith: Where's Natalie?",
        "Parker: Aunt Emma and Luke took her home, you remember?",
        "Faith: Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. Let's go.",
        "Parker: Go where? We have no idea where your mom went.",
        "Faith: Yeah, but she was looking for Paul. We'll start at his cabin.",
        "Parker: Okay, I have a better idea, all right? Let's start here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, how you holding up?",
        "Lily: Oh, his fever won't go down, and no one can tell us why. Why don't we have any answers?",
        "Meg: Dr. Schuster is the best critical care pediatrician in the state.",
        "Lily: Why isn't he here? I mean, you're a nurse. Can't you --? I'm sorry --",
        "Meg: No, no, no. You know what? It's okay. It's okay. We're all kind of stressed out. Let's just hope we get the test results soon.",
        "Craig: Do you want me to get you anything at the cafeteria?",
        "Lily: No, I'm not hungry. Thank you.",
        "Meg: I'll stay with the baby.",
        "Lily: You want to help me? I want you to go down to that lab and find out what made my son so sick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Faith calling her mom on the cell phone]",
        "Faith: Mom, its Faith. I'm really worried about Ethan. Call me as soon as you can, let me know he's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh, Bob, thank goodness. Please tell me that you know what's wrong with Ethan.",
        "Bob: Well, I put a rush on Ethan's blood work. As soon as they get the results, then we can target the treatment.",
        "Lily: He's still so warm.",
        "Bob: Well, we've given him something for that.",
        "Lily: It's not working.",
        "Bob: I promise you, Lily, we'll get to the bottom of this.",
        "Meg: Paul, what is it?",
        "Bob: The I.V. will keep him from becoming dehydrated. What we've got to find out is whether this is a virus or something bacterial.",
        "Lily: What do you think it is?",
        "Bob: I suspect bacterial, some kind of an intestinal infection. What would really help me if you can give me a list of everything Ethan has had to eat for the past 48 hours?",
        "Paul: After I had the vision of Ethan, I had a vision of Lily feeding Ethan. And then when I was at the farmhouse, and I saw all the baby food in the baskets, I started feeling really strange.",
        "Meg: Like something might be wrong?",
        "Paul: Well, like one of the jars was contaminated. But now --",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: I think the problem is bigger. I think its way worse. I think there's a problem with all of them.",
        "Lily: I think this is it. And he had a teething biscuit this morning.",
        "Bob: What was the brand?",
        "Lily: Um, I don't know. Emma's at the farm.",
        "Craig: I'll call her.",
        "Bob: Well, listen, see if she can bring a sample if she has any left.",
        "Lily: If this is bacterial, what are the dangers?",
        "Bob: Ethan is showing early signs of kidney failure.",
        "Lily: You can fix that, right? I mean, when Luke was having his kidney problems, you were able --",
        "Bob: We can put him on dialysis, if it comes to that. We're monitoring him very closely. Where's Holden?",
        "Lily: He's coming back today.",
        "Bob: You should try to reach him.",
        "Craig: I'll get a hold of him.",
        "Bob: He should be here.",
        "Lily: When you just asked about Holden, you sounded very serious. Is Ethan critical?",
        "Bob: I'm afraid so.",
        "Meg: Dump everything just in case.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Meg: Open them up, throw everything inside.",
        "Paul: That's a good idea. Do you think there's any of these baskets anywhere else in the hospital?",
        "Meg: I don't know.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe we should talk to somebody on the staff.",
        "Craig: What are you doing?",
        "Meg: Paul thinks the baby food got Ethan sick.",
        "Craig: Paul thinks a lot of things, but you're actually going along with this insanity?",
        "Paul: You need to tell Lily.",
        "Craig: Tell Lily what?!",
        "Paul: About the food!",
        "Craig: Meg, I expect this from a guy with his own custom-made straitjacket, but you can't possibly believe him.",
        "Meg: Look, you need to take this seriously.",
        "Craig: On the strength of what, a premonition from the voice of doom?! Look, Lily cannot have the circus coming into town when she's dealing with everything else.",
        "Meg: But what if Paul's right?",
        "Craig: Really, and what if he sees Elvis next? You're gonna believe him then, too?",
        "Meg: Please, Craig.",
        "Craig: All right, okay. I'm just gonna call Emma. At least somebody can do something sane around here.",
        "Meg: Here. Give me one of those jars.",
        "Paul: Hey, wait, look, if you don't believe me, you can just say so, you know?",
        "Meg: Beth, hi.",
        "Nurse: Meg, I'm so sorry about your nephew.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Look, I need a favor, and it can't wait. Can you take this to the lab? I need it tested for contaminants.",
        "Nurse: Meg, I can't authorize tests on my own.",
        "Meg: Is Rich on duty?",
        "Nurse: I think.",
        "Meg: Okay, he's pretty good at going out on a limb. I need to find out if there's something in here that made Ethan sick.",
        "Nurse: I'll see what I can do.",
        "Meg: Thank you. And tell him to put a rush on it.",
        "Paul: Was that a vote of confidence?",
        "Meg: Let's just say I don't want to take any chances.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Mom, it's me again. Call me back.",
        "Parker: Try Meg.",
        "Faith: I did, like twice. Did you get Jack?",
        "Parker: He's on some stakeout thing.",
        "Faith: We have to do something.",
        "Parker: Think about it, Faith. Paul was all worried about what Ethan ate, right? And now nobody's picking up their cell phones. What if something Ethan ate made him sick, and now everyone's at the hospital? What if that's why we can't get anyone?",
        "Faith: You're right. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: This stuff needs to go in the dumpster. And if there are any more of these baby gift baskets scattered around the hospital, we need to get rid of every last one of them.",
        "Meg: All the baby food samples need to be destroyed.",
        "Paul: And do me a favor, too -- get the word out. If anybody finds any of this stuff, they need to get rid of it.",
        "Janitor: Okay.",
        "Paul: Thank you.",
        "Meg: Okay, I need to call over to the medical buildings to make sure there aren't any more samples at any of the pediatric offices.",
        "Paul: Parker called.",
        "Meg: Paul, the kids, do they know what's going on?",
        "Paul: They must be scared to death.",
        "Meg: Did you tell them anything about the food?",
        "Paul: No, nothing specifically, because I didn't want them to panic until I knew for sure. But I did ask a bunch of questions about when the last time it was that Ethan was fed. I'm sure it was enough to worry them.",
        "Meg: Okay, they're probably still at the farm.",
        "Paul: Well, I'll go talk to them.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'm coming with you. I want to explain to Faith about Ethan's condition.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Meg: We are heading over to the farm to talk to Parker and Faith.",
        "Paul: Yeah, they need to understand why I took Ethan.",
        "Craig: Well, you could always start by telling them you're crazy.",
        "Meg: Okay, Craig, would you stay here with Lily and tell her where we are?",
        "Craig: Why don't I go and talk to the children?",
        "Paul: Because kids don't like you.",
        "Craig: Sure they do. And if I slip them a $20, they really like me.",
        "Meg: Craig, please. We won't be long.",
        "Craig: All right. I'll stay. I'll just think of something heroic I can do to impress you.",
        "Meg: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: He seems cooler.",
        "Bob: The nurse is with him. Why don't you take a break?",
        "Lily: Oh, I can't do that.",
        "Bob: Beth, Ethan Snyder's labs up yet?",
        "Nurse: No, I just checked. Dr. Hughes, we had them test one of those jars of baby food from those baskets that we had.",
        "Lily: Why on earth would you do something like that?",
        "Nurse: Meg suggested that we check it as a source of a possible contaminant.",
        "Lily: That food has been prepared under the strictest conditions.",
        "Bob: Has Ethan had any of that baby food in the last day or two?",
        "Lily: Well, of course.",
        "Bob: Well, then Meg is right. Until we're positive, everything is suspect.",
        "Lily: It can't be the baby food. It can't be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm a grown woman, Mother. I don't need you coming to my office, critiquing my wardrobe like I'm back in high school!",
        "Susan: Honey, I love you.",
        "Emily: And I love you. I know you love me. I love you, Mother. But can you just -- can you tell me how I can start earning back a little bit of your respect?",
        "Susan: By showing better taste in men. By steering clear of guys that send you home in bruises!",
        "Emily: Well, at least I didn't marry a serial killer.",
        "Susan: Ha, I didn't see that coming.",
        "Emily: I had one bad experience, Mother, one time. That does not give you the right to supervise my entire live. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Susan: I've heard that so many times, I don't even have a comeback!",
        "Emily: Okay, good, good, 'cause that means we're done.",
        "Susan: No, we're not done. I need to know why you're never home anymore.",
        "Emily: Okay, you want the truth? I'm working on a story.",
        "Susan: Well, great. Why didn't you just tell me that?",
        "Emily: Because it's about the sex trade. And there it is -- there's that look I know so well.",
        "Susan: Is that why you got beat up?",
        "Emily: He was -- he was a contact, and he saw through my cover. But it's a really important story, Mom. I mean, not just because it's gonna sell a ton of papers here at \"The Intruder,\" but because it's gonna wake people up to what's going on, even in a small town like this.",
        "Susan: But what about Daniel? Well, what's he gonna think? And I don't even want to think about what Tom is going to say when he finds out what you're doing.",
        "Emily: What's he gonna do, take Daniel away from me? Daniel's life is at boarding school now. And my job from now on is to watch him walk in and out of my life on holidays and summer vacations.",
        "Susan: It doesn't have to be that way.",
        "Emily: It is that way, Mom.",
        "Susan: Does Dusty know what you're doing?",
        "Emily: Yes. He knows everything. But mostly, he knows what an incredible story this is, because I've earned the confidence of one of the most powerful women in the industry.",
        "Susan: Oh, great, you're making new friends.",
        "Emily: Mother -- Mother, where are you going? Mother, don't you --",
        "Susan: How can you let her go out on the street like a common hooker? And all for some sleazy story. Do you really need the ad dollars that badly? What kind of man are you?",
        "Emily: Just stop it, okay? This is my job. That's enough.",
        "Susan: Did you approve this story?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Emily: I didn't ask Dusty's permission, because I decide who does stories at the paper, okay? It was my decision. And once the research started rolling in, I told him exactly what I was doing.",
        "Susan: That's the kind of research that can get you killed. You're the money man. Pull the plug on this.",
        "Emily: Excuse me, how would you feel if somebody busted into memorial to tell you how to do your job, huh?",
        "Susan: You can't compare my job to this!",
        "Emily: I decided to do this expose, okay, Mother? One time, there was one bad experience. But it's fine. I'm perfectly safe.",
        "Susan: Until the next time.",
        "Emily: There's not gonna be a next time, okay? It won't happen. And if it does, guess what? You get the added fun of saying I told you so.",
        "Susan: This isn't fun! Far from it!",
        "[Pager beeps]",
        "Emily: Oh, God, I only hope that's an emergency at the hospital.",
        "Susan: Yeah, well, I think the real emergency is here, my dear. Losing your life over a lousy story?",
        "Emily: Will you stop being so dramatic? Thank you.",
        "Dusty: For what, Emily?",
        "Emily: For not telling her something that would obviously upset her.",
        "Dusty: Well, she deserves better. So does your kid. I don't want any part of what you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Faith?",
        "Paul: Parker?",
        "Meg: Faith?",
        "Paul: Parker? Faith!",
        "Meg: Okay, where could they be?",
        "Paul: I don't know, but I hope they didn't run away again.",
        "Parker: Paul?",
        "Paul: We're in here. Come on. Come on in.",
        "Meg: Where were you guys?",
        "Faith: How's Ethan?",
        "Meg: Uh, he's in the hospital, Honey. But a lot of doctors are working on him to make sure that he gets better.",
        "Parker: You knew he was gonna get sick, didn't you?",
        "Paul: Well, I hoped I could save him by getting him out of here. But where have you been?",
        "Faith: Uh, we went out of Route 23.",
        "Parker: We were trying to get to the hospital.",
        "Meg: By hitchhiking?",
        "Parker: We didn't have money for a cab.",
        "Faith: But no one picked us up.",
        "Meg: Well, thank goodness.",
        "Faith: We got tired of waiting.",
        "Parker: So we came back.",
        "Meg: Do you guys know how dangerous hitchhiking is?",
        "Faith: Aunt Meg, I know, but I was worried about Ethan. Can you take us back to the hospital?",
        "Meg: I don't think so, honey. He's -- he's in intensive care.",
        "Faith: Why? What's wrong with him?",
        "Meg: We don't know yet.",
        "Paul: The doctors are still trying to figure out what made him sick.",
        "Faith: And they really won't let me see him?",
        "Meg: Not yet, Honey. He really is sick.",
        "Faith: Is he going to die?",
        "Meg: Sweetie, I can't answer that question. All I can tell you is every doctor is working really hard to make sure he gets well again. So all we can do is just hope, okay? Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Dr. Stewart is on her way in.",
        "Bob: What about Dr. Tucker and Dr. Morton?",
        "Nurse: They're already back.",
        "Bob: And you've called in the available support staff?",
        "Nurse: And alerted the CDC and the local health networks.",
        "Lily: The CDC? Why? What's going on?",
        "Bob: Well, we're not sure yet, but I'll be back to check Ethan as soon as I can. Holden.",
        "Holden: Lily.",
        "Lily: Thank God. Thank God you're here.",
        "Holden: I -- I got Craig's message when we touched down. What is it? What happened to the baby?",
        "Lily: They don't know. They don't know.",
        "Holden: I just passed Bob, and he couldn't even stop to talk.",
        "Lily: He talked -- said something about calling the CDC.",
        "Holden: The CDC? What is it? Is it a strain of flu? And when did he get sick?",
        "Lily: He was fine. I went back to the farm to feed him again, and Paul had taken the baby.",
        "Holden: Paul?",
        "Lily: Paul had one of those crazy visions where he thought Ethan was in danger. He convinced Faith and Parker that he could take the baby. He took the baby, brought the baby to Meg, and Meg -- they brought the baby here to the hospital. They think is some sort of bacterial infection, but they're not sure.",
        "Holden: None of our other kids have been sick. Where would he pick up something like this?",
        "Lily: I don't know. But Bob said that his kidneys --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: His kidneys are shutting down. I'm afraid we're going to lose him, Holden.",
        "Holden: No, no, no, no. We're not gonna lose him. It's not gonna happen. He's gonna be all right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Aunt Meg, do you think the doctors will be able to help my brother?",
        "Meg: Yeah. I've seen them take care of a lot of sick kids, Honey.",
        "Parker: As sick as Ethan?",
        "Meg: Absolutely.",
        "Parker: I guess we did the right thing, letting you take him.",
        "Faith: I just thought of something. If you knew Ethan was gonna get sick, maybe you'll know if he'll get better.",
        "Meg: Well, Honey, I don't think Paul can predict something --",
        "Paul: No, no, I can't. But I do think that Ethan is gonna fine.",
        "Faith: Did you have another vision?",
        "Paul: No, I just -- I believe it, that's all.",
        "Parker: How come?",
        "Meg: Yeah, how come?",
        "Paul: Well, did you ever feel like your life is just not going right, and everything that's bad keeps getting worse? And then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, you get this feeling that, you know, maybe life isn't so terrible after all? 'Cause something good happened, some tiny little good thing. Well, I got that feeling today. And it's not just about Ethan, it's about everything. And it's as strong as any vision I've ever had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: When I left, he was fine. This makes no sense. I don't understand. How did this happen so fast?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Holden: Was he around anyone who was sick?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Holden: You shouldn't have done that commercial.",
        "Lily: He didn't get sick from doing the commercial.",
        "Holden: That's not what I meant. Maybe too many people were handling him --",
        "Lily: No, he was with me most of the time. Kids get sick, Holden.",
