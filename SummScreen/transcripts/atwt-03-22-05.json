        "Dusty: Make yourself at home, why don't you?",
        "Craig: Thank you. I will. But then, I've been here, I'm welcome, and I'm family. And I'm making Lucinda lots of money. How about you?",
        "Dusty: Where's Sierra?",
        "Craig: Lakeview.",
        "Craig: Yeah, Melanie. I need Singapore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Mm, thank you.",
        "Barbara: Sierra, I'm glad I caught you.",
        "Sierra: Agtually, Barbara, I'm on my way out --",
        "Barbara: I need your help. It's vital.",
        "Sierra: Vital?",
        "Barbara: Yes, my daughter's life is at stake.",
        "Sierra: Barbara, I know that you are a creative person and that you thrive on drama, but --",
        "Barbara: Worldwide Industries has made a significant investment in my daughter. If she should go down --",
        "Sierra: Don't you think you should talk to Craig about this?",
        "Barbara: Craig is the problem. Please, Sierra, I'm appealing to you as a mother. You know what Craig did to me, and to you and to your daughter. So maybe you can understand my concern. I won't let him destroy Jennifer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I missed you.",
        "Jennifer: I'm so sorry I pushed you away. And for all the wrong reasons.",
        "Mike: There's a right reason?",
        "Jennifer: No, no, no, of course not. Losing you would be the worst thing that could ever possibly happen to me.",
        "Henry: Bubbles.",
        "Katie: Do you have any idea how much fun that was? Do you? Henry?",
        "Henry: You're real.",
        "Katie: I hope so.",
        "Henry: We did.",
        "Katie: We did.",
        "Henry: Oh, my God -- I ruined everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I killed Julia.",
        "Luke: Mom, don't do this!",
        "Lily: My son had absolutely nothing to do with this. He's just trying to protect me.",
        "Keith: I knew it. I knew it from the get-go. You and her -- you hated Julia!",
        "Carly: Hey!",
        "Lily: No, no, no. Carly had absolutely nothing to do with this.",
        "Keith: Oh, so she wouldn't leave town, so you just killed her?",
        "Luke: That's a lie!",
        "Holden: Hey, hey, hey! Don't.",
        "Jack: Lily, I know how much you love your son and that you'd do anything to protect him --",
        "Lily: I'm not trying to protect him. This is all my fault!",
        "Luke: None of this is your fault! I killed Julia so my dad would get back with my mom. And I'd do it again. I'm glad she's dead!",
        "Lily: Luke, this has got to stop, okay? We have to tell the truth.",
        "Luke: The truth is that Julia Larrabee is the reason my dad moved out on us.",
        "Holden: That's not true. I moved out way before Julia and I became friends.",
        "Luke: Oh, friends? So that's how you're putting it now?",
        "Holden: Look, I know the situation was hurtful, but let's not make it worse. We need to figure out what happened here. Julia deserves that respect.",
        "Luke: She doesn't deserve anything. She was a liar.",
        "Keith: Hey, quiet down, all right?",
        "Jack: We're all gonna quiet down, or I'll take this entire conversation down to the station. Do we understand each other? Lily, tell me what happened.",
        "Luke: She's just going to tell you that she did it.",
        "Jack: Get him out of here now!",
        "Luke: I'm sorry. Jack, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna say anything.",
        "Jack: Fine.",
        "Keith: So the kid's on a first-name basis -- like my sister's gonna get justice in this town.",
        "Jack: Go ahead, Lily.",
        "Lily: I went over to Julia's apartment the night she died. I know I shouldn't have. I was hurt, and I was upset. Holden left because of me, but he wasn't coming home because of her. He was spending so much time with her at that apartment. And then there was the restraining order. I just thought my children were going to lose their father forever.",
        "Holden: Oh, please, don't blame this on me.",
        "Lily: No, I'm not. I just want people to understand how I was feeling. Why I violated the restraining order and knocked on her door. She was angry. She was not happy to see me, and I said some things, some horrible things -- that I regret. I was very blunt with her. She was angry, and she tried to push me out of the apartment. So I pushed her back, and she fell. And she hit her head.",
        "Keith: What?",
        "Lily: It was an accident. I'm so sorry --",
        "Keith: No, it was no accident. It was homicide. Isn't that right, Jack? Tell her what the coroner said. She was hit with a blunt object.",
        "Lily: No, no -- she fell and hit her head on the coffee table. It was an accident. I didn't mean for her to die, I swear --",
        "Jack: Lily, I need to remind you that anything you say will be used against you, and if you want a lawyer --",
        "Lily: No, I don't want a lawyer. I need to tell everybody. Everybody needs to know the truth. I pushed Julia, she fell, she hit her head, and she died. I'm the only one responsible. Not Luke. Not Keith. I killed her. I'm so sorry, Holden. I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Your daughter is a success. You should be proud of her.",
        "Barbara: I am proud of her. But Craig will sandbag her. I won't let that happen. He will ruin her life.",
        "Sierra: She's doing beautifully. The company is thriving.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yeah. Craig's always really great in the beginning. But I don't have to tell you that. You know that, don't you, Sierra? And that he's full of encouragement. He's spending a lot of time with you. And pretty soon, you're sucked in. You don't even realize that the rest of your life is slipping away.",
        "Sierra: You know, I really wouldn't worry about Jennifer losing sight of reality. From what I understand, she and Mike Kasnoff are very serious.",
        "Barbara: And how long do you think that's gonna last?",
        "Sierra: You know, you really are not giving your daughter enough credit.",
        "Barbara: And you're being very naive. He is spending every waking moment with her -- breakfast, lunch. He's showing up at her house. How long do you think it's gonna be before they start going on business trips together, and he's insisting that they share a suite together?",
        "Sierra: You know, I think Jennifer is smarter than that.",
        "Barbara: Were you? I wasn't. Even if she resists, it'll just egg him on. And then, after some small defeat -- that I'm sure that he has manufactured and managed to salvage -- he'll show up with wine and sympathy. And when she wakes up the next morning, it will be too late.",
        "Sierra: She's not you, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: I wasn't me before Craig. He's an emotional predator, and he will never change. And if you let him sharpen his teeth on my daughter, I will hold you personally responsible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You know what I think the problem was? The real problem? We weren't communicating.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I think we tried. I just -- was so insecure about Katie, and you kept trying to reassure me, but --",
        "Mike: Or maybe it's that Katie and I weren't communicating. 'Cause once we sat down and really talked, we realized that all those feelings we had for each other turned into something else. I still love her. She's a great person, and she loves me. But we're just not together anymore. I want to be with you.",
        "Jennifer: And I want to be with you. I was just always protecting myself, waiting for you to go back to her.",
        "Mike: I'd have to fight my way past Henry at this point. He's crazy about her.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, he's always been crazy about her.",
        "Mike: Well, now she's crazy about him now, too. So it all worked out.",
        "Jennifer: I just wish that we had talked about this sooner. I wish I'd known how you felt, so then I never would've --",
        "Mike: I think every couple goes through these kind of things in the beginning, okay? Just misunderstanding, fear. Besides, it's not like you did anything wrong. Okay, you just got a little wrapped up in work. And I got a little confused. We're fine. No harm, no foul.",
        "Katie: You didn't ruin anything.",
        "Henry: Just give it to me straight here. I'm sure my technique could use a few pointers.",
        "Katie: Are you kidding? It was amazing.",
        "Henry: No, don't flatter me, Kathryn, okay? I'm just -- I want you to -- some constructive criticism here, anything.",
        "Katie: Well, you're not going to get any from me. Couldn't you tell I was having a good time?",
        "Henry: Not as good as I was having. Did you really -- you really --",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. All of it. Especially you. You know why? Because in the middle of pretty much the most fun I've had in bed in -- almost ever, I opened my eyes, and there you were. My best friend. Someone I totally trust. And it just made me let go. Which was so nice, 'cause I'm used to chasing after guys who I'm not really sure if they want to be there, you know? So I'm always trying to be perfect. But you already know me, and you love me, anyway. [Both laughing] And I love you, too. So I was just so comfortable that -- you know when they say that the earth moved? The earth moved, and I moved with it.",
        "Henry: Whoo!",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Katie: You're gonna break the couch!",
        "Henry: I don't care. I'll buy you a new couch. I'll buy hundreds of couches, bigger than this. Kathryn, I'm -- I'm so happy. And I'm just -- I'm afraid this isn't gonna last.",
        "Katie: Hey -- we're married.",
        "Henry: Yeah, but --",
        "Katie: We love each other. We just had our own personal fourth of July upstairs in the bedroom. It's all good.",
        "Henry: What if --",
        "Katie: I'm happy, too.",
        "Henry: You are? You're really happy?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. Think about it. I'm a girl who's been chasing after love for -- ever. And there it was. With someone I adore. Who happens to also be a fabulous lover? Who knew?",
        "Henry: I tried to tell you that. You don't listen to me.",
        "Katie: Well, you are as good as your word. Better. In fact, you have any energy left?",
        "Henry: Yeah -- you wanna go again? You wanna go right now?",
        "Katie: Well, unless you have any other plans --",
        "Henry: I have no other plans. What are you talking about? Get up off the couch. Come on. I -- I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Katie: Well, then I'm just gonna have to convince you.",
        "Henry: Oh, Lord.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, not that I don't love a little Bangkok in the night, but I think you could persuade your partners to meet us in Singapore. Huh? Yeah. Jennifer and I will be staying at the Singapore grand. We'll fax you. Thank Mei Lee for putting us in touch. All right. Okay. All right.",
        "Sierra: Who was that?",
        "Craig: Tony Kwan. Retail conglomerate, Singapore.",
        "Sierra: Ah.",
        "Craig: Still can't keep your hands off me.",
        "Sierra: Tony Kwan?",
        "Craig: Tony Kwan can move a million jeans a year in Singapore alone. We're gonna pump up tsunami relief and blanket Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to boot.",
        "Sierra: You and Jennifer are flying to Singapore?",
        "Craig: Yeah. We're gonna flex the Southeast Asian market, and Worldwide retail is gonna have a banner year.",
        "Sierra: And you've discussed this with her?",
        "Craig: Ah, yeah. Don't worry about Jennifer. She's right on board.",
        "Dusty: I got the specs from the contractor in Laguna. We do the spa now, we'll be in under budget.",
        "Craig: And a penny saved is a penny earned.",
        "Sierra: That's great news, Dusty.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm gonna go tell Jennifer -- a deal that could triple the last year's earnings.",
        "Dusty: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.",
        "Craig: Like Mother, like daughter?",
        "Sierra: Ignore him.",
        "Dusty: I guess I was wrong about pairing him with Jennifer.",
        "Sierra: I hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I think we learned something. From now on, if something feels wrong, we talk about it. No more second-guessing the other person. You just sit him down -- that'd be me -- and you say, \"What gives, Kasnoff?\"",
        "Jennifer: And if Kasnoff doesn't know?",
        "Mike: It's better than pretending everything's fine when it isn't. I mean, look what just happened. We almost lost each other because you were afraid I was going back to Katie. We're lucky that's all it was.",
        "Jennifer: What do you mean?",
        "Mike: Well, you know, you just threw yourself back into your work. It could've been a lot worse. You could've thrown yourself at another man.",
        "Jennifer: There is not another man. There's only you.",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Craig: Jennifer? I know you're in there!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, could you come home and take care of the kids?",
        "Holden: Lily, don't worry about the kids.",
        "Lily: I have to. Jack's going to arrest me --",
        "Luke: No!",
        "Lily: Yes, he has no choice. I'm responsible for Julia's death.",
        "Jack: Lily, there's still the matter of Luke's fingerprint on Julia's watchband.",
        "Lily: That doesn't prove anything. She was staying at Emma's. The kids are there all the time. Who knows when Luke picked up her watch?",
        "Luke: But I didn't.",
        "Lily: No one's saying that you never met her.",
        "Jack: The fingerprint was fresh and well-defined, Lily.",
        "Lily: Who knows when she would wipe off her wristband? Who knows when's the last time she wore it?",
        "Keith: All right, all right. She confessed. Arrest her.",
        "Luke: She didn't do it.",
        "Holden: I need to get him out of here.",
        "Jack: All right. Malone, take Luke and his father outside.",
        "Luke: No, no, no! She's just trying to protect me!",
        "Holden: Luke, enough!",
        "Luke: You want them to arrest her? It's not bad enough that --",
        "Jack: Why don't you take Mr. Morrissey to the kitchen?",
        "Keith: I'm not hungry. I want her arrested for my sister's murder.",
        "Jack: You're hampering a police investigation.",
        "Keith: And you're covering up a crime here to protect your cousin's wife! I spent four days in jail while you tried to pin this on me. Now, I'm seeing this through.",
        "Lily: He can stay. He can stay. I don't blame him for being angry.",
        "Jack: Fine. One more outburst, I'm charging you with obstruction. Are we clear? I heard what you said, Lily. I heard it all. And I gotta say, while it makes sense -- we all know what you were going through. Now, I'm gonna need a damn good reason to believe why you're not throwing yourself under the bus for Luke.",
        "Lily: He was angry. Angry at Julia and his father. But he couldn't do this -- he didn't do it.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I need something a little more concrete than that.",
        "Carly: I was there. I'm so sorry, Lil. She's telling the truth. She killed Julia.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Lily: Do you realize what you've done?",
        "Keith: Are you telling me that you left my sister on the floor to die?",
        "Luke: I killed julia.",
        "Keith: Arrest them all! They all hated my sister. They're all guilty!",
        "Lily: Carly was there, but she had nothing to do with Julia's death. That was all me.",
        "Jack: Are you saying you lied to me?",
        "Carly: I'm saying, you need to try to understand. It was an accident, and we -- we thought --",
        "Keith: An accident?",
        "Lily: I know how bad this looks, Keith. And I should have come forward sooner, but I was very scared, because of the restraining order and my children. And, please, you have to know that it was an accident. I never meant to kill her.",
        "Jack: Let's hear it, Carly.",
        "Carly: Lily went to Julia's, like she said. And they argued, and things got ugly. And Lily pushed her, and she fell, and she hit her head. Now, she would have called for help --",
        "Lily: No, I know I didn't call. I didn't call. I didn't call the police, and I should have.",
        "Carly: Because Keith showed up.",
        "Keith: What?",
        "Lily: Yes. I heard him banging on the door, and I was scared. I figured he had a key. I was scared about the restraining order, so I had to get out of there. I went out the window.",
        "Carly: And she came to our place. And she told me what happened, and we were both very worried. So we went back to Julia's.",
        "Lily: Julia was dead.",
        "Jack: And your response to finding her there on the floor was to wipe the place clean of prints?",
        "Carly: We panicked. We know how stupid it was.",
        "Jack: It was criminal, Carly, for anyone to do. But you -- you're the wife of a police detective!",
        "Lily: It's not her fault. I'm the one who wiped the place clean. Carly just kept my secret.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm sorry, ladies. I'm not buying it. Keep an eye on these two, would you?",
        "Lily: Where are you taking her?",
        "Jack: My wife? We're gonna have a little chat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: I'm sorry to intrude, you two lovebirds, but this can't wait. Now, mike, I need her for five minutes. I'll give her right back.",
        "Mike: Is this okay with you?",
        "Jennifer: No. But since he's here -- Craig, five minutes, okay? And then -- call my cell.",
        "Craig: I have been.",
        "Jennifer: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Craig: Making us happy, Mon Petite Rouge.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, don't call me that.",
        "Craig: Testy? Mike Kasnoff losing his touch?",
        "Jennifer: Leave Mike out of this.",
        "Craig: All right, fine. But I want to talk about what we just did. You ever hear of my old friend, Tony Kwan? Far East Fashions?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Craig: Well, I just spoke to Tony. I sent him samples of the ad campaign. He wants to meet us. He's pulling in his people from Bangkok, Taiwan. We're talking about sales in the megamillions.",
        "Jennifer: All right, I'm impressed.",
        "Craig: You see? You even have a minute and a half left to talk about when we're gonna leave.",
        "Jennifer: Leave?",
        "Craig: For Singapore.",

        "Katie: Can you grab that? I think its Margo.",
        "Henry: Henry's happy house of pleasure.",
        "Mike: Henry? When did you get home?",
        "Henry: Oh, you know, it's -- didn't have time to call people.",
        "Mike: So the tests were negative?",
        "Henry: Yeah, Mike, you know, I wouldn't be lying if I said that my entire body has been thoroughly examined by an expert, and I came through with flying colors.",
        "Mike: That's great news.",
        "Henry: You have no idea. So, yeah, how are you? How are you and Jennifer?",
        "Mike: We're good. Finally talked about what's been going on.",
        "Henry: Really?",
        "Mike: She told me everything.",
        "Henry: Well, that is a brave girl.",
        "Mike: What do you mean?",
        "Katie: Henry --",

        "Sierra: This is great. Thank you. If this spa lives up to the plan, I think I might have to move in here. I'm gonna need to after this first quarter.",
        "Dusty: Why? Earnings are up. Next quarter looks better. And you're having fun. Or you were.",
        "Sierra: No, I'm still having fun. I -- I think I'm just second-guessing myself where Craig is concerned.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Sierra: Well, Jennifer is very young.",
        "Dusty: She's not that young.",
        "Sierra: You know, that's the second time I've heard that today.",
        "Dusty: So what are you worried about?",
        "Sierra: I ran into Barbara Ryan today. I know that Craig isn't one of her favorite people, but she made some good points.",
        "Dusty: You're listening to Barbara Ryan?",
        "Sierra: Well, she just got me thinking.",
        "Dusty: She's jealous of her daughter's success.",
        "Sierra: Do you think that's it? Do you think that's -- she's just trying to jeopardize the partnership because it's doing well?",
        "Dusty: Of course.",
        "Sierra: Maybe you're right.",
        "Dusty: But what?",
        "Sierra: Well, she implied -- no, that's too subtle for Barbara -- she threatened to hold me responsible if Craig did anything to hurt Jennifer.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer knows what she's up against. I wouldn't worry about her.",
        "Sierra: I guess what I'm saying is -- did I make a mistake? I mean, I know that Jennifer is a capable young woman, but am I tempting fate? I mean, will Craig be able to discipline himself now that Street Jeans is up and running, or will he muck it up and hurt Jennifer in the process?",
        "Dusty: Jennifer is a big girl. And you messing around with Barbara Ryan is not worth your time, not when you got Lucinda watching your bottom line.",
        "Sierra: I'm not worried about worldwide.",
        "Dusty: You should be. I'm not saying that 'cause you won't make money, but you've got a chance to put yourself on the map, if you stop playing nursemaid with your ex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Tony's flying his people in from Bangkok and Taiwan. They expect you to be there.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I understand that. And I'm willing to meet them -- alone.",
        "Craig: All right, you want to make a presentation, that's fine. But they want to see the numbers, and that's me. We're a team, Jennifer. You design. I close the deal. It works.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not going anywhere with you, Craig. And, as a matter of fact, we need to talk about revamping the office. I want my own space.",
        "Craig: This has nothing to do with business, does it?",
        "Jennifer: No.",
        "Craig: Jennifer -- we shared one strange, beautiful night. That's it. I got it. You want to play house with whoever you want? God bless. My only interest is Street Jeans.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then you'll accept my terms.",
        "Craig: She with the most to lose cannot dictate terms.",
        "Jennifer: Meaning?",
        "Craig: Mike Kasnoff's a nice guy. Not complicated. Doesn't like to share. But if you want to keep him and your company, you have to do things my way.",
        "Mike: Is there a problem here?",
        "Craig: I don't think so. Do you, Jennifer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dad, we have to get back inside before Mom ruins everything. She didn't do this. I did.",
        "Holden: Your mom already confessed to pushing Julia, and I believe her.",
        "Luke: Well, yeah, she pushed her. But then she left. She ran away. And then I showed up and -- you know, I finished the job.",
        "Holden: You are talking nonsense.",
        "Luke: Look, it's true. I'll tell you exactly what happened. I went to Julia's.",
        "[Luke remembering]",
        "Julia: Oh. Luke, what are you doing here? Where's Lily?",
        "Luke: Don't even say my mother's name. She is so much better than you.",
        "Julia: I can't do this with you right now. Your mother gave me a headache.",
        "Luke: I bet you deserved it. You're disgusting, you know that? I hate you.",
        "Julia: You know, the feeling is starting to be very mutual. Get out of my house.",
        "Luke: You're the one who's leaving.",
        "Julia: What are you talking about?",
        "Luke: Say you'll go away. Just go away. Don't make me do this.",
        "Julia: What are you talking about?",
        "Luke: I can't let you take my dad away from us.",
        "Julia: It's too late. You don't have a choice.",
        "Luke: Why couldn't you just go away?",
        "Julia: What? Get off of me, Luke!",
        "Luke: Why couldn't you just go away? [Julia crying in pain] Why? Why?",
        "Luke: Julia? Julia, are you awake? Julia, I didn't mean it. Are you awake? Julia?",
        "Luke: That's what I was burning in Grandma's fireplace. Mom's gloves. And I didn't want her blamed for something that I did.",
        "Holden: How could you hit someone who was injured?",
        "Luke: Look, Dad, this is all your fault. If you hadn't slept with her, none of this would've happened. I'm going back inside and telling everything that happened!",
        "Holden: No, no, you're not going anywhere.",
        "Jack: I'm going to have to put you in jail for being an accessory to murder. Did you know that?",
        "Carly: I need you to understand --",
        "Jack: I've got two people confessing to the same felony. And almost no forensic evidence, thanks to you and your sudden urge to clean house.",
        "Carly: Well, we panicked.",
        "Jack: Oh, tell me something I don't know. If Keith goes to Tom with Lily's confession, I might not have a choice. I might have to arrest her for murder one. Do you know that?",
        "Carly: No, no. Lily didn't mean to hurt Julia at all. She went there --",
        "Jack: She went there to what? She went there to what? You tell me. You tell me why she went over there after I served her with a restraining order, and maybe, just maybe, I might believe this whole thing being an accident. Because if it went down like Lily said, that she went over there to talk to Julia? There's not a jury in the world who's going to believe that shoving match. So let's have it.",
        "Carly: Lily went to Julia's apartment because she found out that Luke had trashed the place. And she was concerned about how Holden would react, so she went there to clean it up. And she was almost finished when Julia showed up. And Lily tried to explain why she was there, but Julia got angry. And they had an argument, and Julia got in Lily's face, and Lily pushed her. Now, she didn't mean to push her as hard as she did. And Julia fell. And she hit her head. And Lily -- you know her. She tried to help her.",
        "Jack: What do you mean, she tried -- help her? I thought Julia was dead.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jack: She was alive?",
        "Carly: She'd been knocked unconscious, but she was still breathing.",
        "Jack: Well, why didn't Lily call 911? An ambulance?",
        "Carly: I told you! Because Keith was outside pounding on the door. Lily knew that he would never believe her if he saw her standing there with his sister lying on the ground. So she climbed out the window.",
        "Jack: And that's why both of you went back -- because you weren't sure that Keith had a key?",
        "Carly: Yes, exactly. And when we got there, Julia was dead. And according to Lily, she'd been moved, or she moved, or --",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Carly: She wasn't in the same place when Lily left her. Anyway, we started cleaning up the place --",
        "Jack: Why clean if it was an accident?",
        "Carly: Because Lily had left the scene. She knew how it would look. It was terrible. And with the restraining order and the history, she knew that nobody would believe her.",
        "Jack: You think anybody is going to believe you now, after you let an innocent man take the fall for this?",
        "Lily: Stop browbeating Carly --",
        "Cop: Sorry, detective.",
        "Lily: She doesn't know anything.",
        "Jack: She knows a lot more than she let on, Lily. And so do you.",
        "Lily: What did you tell him? Carly?",
        "Carly: I told him that Luke trashed Julia's place.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Carly: I had to. I had to tell him the truth. He -- he wouldn't believe me. No one would believe you if you said that you went over there just to talk to her, Lily!",
        "Lily: Do you realize what you've done?",
        "Carly: Besides save your neck and my marriage?",
        "Jack: There's a few contradictions I want sorted out. So everybody's meeting me down at the station. I'll take their statements there.",
        "Lily: No, no, no, that's not necessary, because I've confessed. Can I just call my attorney? And I will go down to the police station.",
        "Jack: You seem awfully eager to get arrested. Why is that, Lily?",
        "Lily: It's just gone on long enough. I want it to end -- for everyone's sake.",
        "Jack: And that would be fine -- if you were guilty.",
        "Keith: She confessed.",
        "Jack: To pushing Julia, who fell down and hit her head. But Julia was alive when Lily left.",
        "Lily: No, she wasn't.",
        "Jack: That's not what you told Carly. And if Julia was alive --",
        "Keith: And you left her there?",
        "Lily: She was already dead. I lied to Carly. Because I knew she wouldn't believe it was an accident.",
        "Jack: Did she lie to you, Carly?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Lily: See? I'm very convincing. I needed her to come back to the apartment to help me clean up.",
        "Jack: Why? Why? If Julia was already dead, why'd you leave? Why didn't you just stay there and finish the job? Make sure there were no prints to be found?",
        "Lily: I told you, because Keith was knocking at the door.",
        "Keith: Are you telling me that you left my sister on the floor to die, and I was on the other side of the door? What kind of person are you?",
        "Luke: It's not her fault.",
        "Holden: Luke, you don't have to do this.",
        "Luke: Yes, I do. I killed Julia. Now, take me down to the police station so I can make an official statement or whatever.",
        "Keith: Oh, you know what? Arrest 'em all. They all hated my sister. They're all guilty. Lock 'em up.",

        "Katie: What, Mr. Coleman?",
        "Henry: I think I could -- I think I could get used to this.",
        "Katie: I think you are used to it. We've been living together for a couple of years.",
        "Henry: Yeah, but not like this.",
        "Katie: No, that's true. This is a definite improvement. See?",
        "Henry: Yeah?",
        "Katie: I told you everything was gonna work out. We're happy. Mike and Jennifer are happy --",
        "Henry: For the moment, yeah.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: Nothing. It's just -- you know, all work and no play makes Jen a dull girl. Don't you think? And then, her time's been eaten up with Street Jeans --",
        "Katie: Oh. Well, they'll work it out. They're meant to be. Just like us.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Katie: You hungry? You want me to make pancakes?",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Katie: Cereal?",

        "Mike: Craig, this is our home. You want to talk about work? Save it for the office. All right? Now, if you don't mind --",
        "Craig: No, no, Jennifer's company had a big day. And I just wanted to share the good news. So, I'll say good night to you two. Jennifer, I'll see you in the office first thing?",
        "Jennifer: Mm-hmm.",

        "Mike: As long as he knows you have a life outside the office.",

        "Lily: You're not making a statement. He's underage, and he's my son --",
        "Jack: Lily, you confessed to a murder.",
        "Lily: It wasn't murder.",

        "Lily: No, you cannot talk to him without one of his parents present. Am I right?",
        "Jack: You've been doing your research -- yes.",
        "Lily: Yes.",

        "Lily: Holden, wait, please --",
        "Jack: Lily, until we take Luke's statement, I really don't want to hear it. I need to know what you want to do here.",
        "Holden: Luke told me that he went back to Julia's and that he found her coming to -- I think I better let him tell you the rest.",

        "Carly: You try going one on one with jack. He jumped on every word I said. I had no choice. I had to tell him the truth.",
        "Lily: You could have refused to answer his questions, Carly.",

        "Jack: I just got a detailed account of Luke's activities on the night of Julia's death. What he told me jibes with Carly's account. Add to it his fingerprints on Julia's watchband, and I have no choice but to arrest your son, Lily.",
