        "Carly tries to seduce Jack, which leads to a terrible argument. Later, Jack gives into to Carly's advances. She thinks that means they are ok again, but Jack remains distant and cold and tells her not to read into what just happened. He leaves without saying goodbye after calling into work. Holden defends Jade, secretly thankful that his son appears not to be gay. Jade is confident by blackmailing Luke into pretending to be in love with her, she will be able to stay at their house. Luke worries what Jade really wants with his family, but is afraid about revealing he is gay. Lily wants Jade arrested, Holden convinces Lily to let Jade stay for the night. When Meg and Paul realize Emily is behind Dusty's disappearance and possible death, they concoct a plan to find Dusty, but Paul needs to get out of jail first. Jen tells Hal she thinks that Dusty is alive and the fact that they still can't find the body only proves that. Emily prepares to shoot Dusty, but his last request is to want to know why? Emily breaks down as she tells him Paul is in love with Meg, and now he needs to pay for hurting her. Dusty sees this as his opening; Meg loves him and if Emily brings him back alive then she can get Paul off and save him and he will be forever indebted to her. Paul calls Emily and asks her to come see him. Katie and Nick try to recreate the night he was drugged in the Lakeview; Nick realizes the woman in the suite with him was not Carly but rather Chardonnay. Meg tells Jen that she and Paul are convinced Dusty is alive, but they can't give her the specifics yet. Jen is confused, but angry and tells Meg she doesn't need them to find Dusty, he will find her. Dusty dreams Jen finds him and hopes she doesn't give up looking for him. Emily goes to see Paul and he tells her how Meg is supposedly turning state's evidence against him. He apologizes for how he treated her; his life has been in shambles since he broke up with her. Emily sobs as he breaks down her resolve, but then runs out of the cell area."

        "Carly: Hi. I was listening for you.",
        "Jack: The kids are in bed?",
        "Carly: Parker and J.J. are at a sleepover. Sage is at the Lebos' for the night.",
        "Jack: Look, I can see that we had the same idea.",
        "Carly: Yeah. You scared me, Jack -- walking out like that.",
        "Jack: But you knew I'd be back. I always come back to you, Carly.",
        "Carly: For a while there, I was afraid you didn't believe me. I didn't set Nick up with those drugs, Jack.",
        "Jack: What are you cooking? Smells great.",
        "Carly: Why didn't you return my calls?",
        "Jack: I've been busy. I've got a lot of catching up to do now that I'm back on the force full time.",
        "Carly: You got your job back?",
        "Jack: Yep. So let's drink to my good fortune.",
        "Carly: You bet!",
        "Jack: And to Nick's arrest. What's the matter, Carly? Nick's about to be indicted and I'm back on top. Isn't that what you wanted?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: I wouldn't do that.",
        "Nick: Lisa Grimaldi, right? Nick Kasnoff. Mike's cousin.",
        "Lisa: Yes, I know. I know who you are.",
        "Nick: So then, you know I'm a cop. And I'm here investigating a crime scene.",
        "Lisa: You know, it's the most interesting thing about a small town, where we are. We have newscasters, we have newspapers. They've all let us know that you've been suspended from the police department because you were dealing in drugs.",
        "Nick: Ms. Grimaldi --",
        "Lisa: I just think you should move on.",
        "Katie: Great! Lisa. I knew you'd help us. So you heard?",
        "Lisa: What? Heard what?",
        "Katie: About a certain blonde who tried to frame Nick right under your nose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, be realistic. We can't have Jade arrested.",
        "Lily: Why not? Isn't it a crime that she pretended to be Rose's daughter? I cannot believe how quickly that girl burrowed her way into our family. The last thing I expected her to do was seduce our son!",
        "Holden: Our son seduced her right back.",
        "Lily: I want her out of this house tonight.",
        "Holden: Even if she takes Luke with her?",
        "Lily: He won't go.",
        "Holden: You don't know that.",
        "Lily: No, I just need a little more time to talk to him.",
        "Holden: You get Jade dragged out of here in handcuffs, I guarantee you he will never speak to us again.",
        "Lily: She cannot stay here.",
        "Holden: Even for the time being?",
        "Lily: No!",
        "Holden: So, you ready to talk about this without freaking?",
        "Lily: I need some air. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Are you sure my dad's still okay with this? I mean, I don't know, Jade. I think that pretending to sleep together might be the worst idea that you've ever had.",
        "Jade: When it was just the two of us, he was really trying to give me the benefit of the doubt. He was trying to understand, Luke.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but that doesn't mean he's going to continue like that. Trust me, if it comes down to keeping you around here or making my mom happy, he's going to choose my mom every time.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but, then we'll both just take off.",
        "Luke: I don't know about that anymore.",
        "Jade: But you promised. You said if I got kicked out you would come with me.",
        "Luke: And if I don't?",
        "Jade: Oh, I think you know what happens if you don't.",
        "Luke: You would tell my parents that I'm gay?",
        "Jade: In a heartbeat.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You and I were so busy protecting each other, we didn't even see that --",
        "Meg: Emily. Why would she do this? Why?",
        "Paul: To get back at me. And you.",
        "Meg: So she hurt Dusty? Do you think she killed him?",
        "Paul: She did shoot me.",
        "Meg: Because she showed up to marry you and you broke her heart. Dusty hasn't done anything to her. Neither have I.",
        "Paul: She thinks that I chose you over her.",
        "Meg: Why would she think that?",
        "Paul: Poor Jennifer. She lost someone else that she loves because of me.",
        "Meg: You? You didn't kill Dusty.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but if I hadn't confessed, then maybe they would have found him by now.",
        "Meg: Okay, so we'll tell the police about Emily.",
        "Paul: No, I need to fix this. I need to find Dusty. For my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Any word?",
        "Hal: I still have teams out looking for Dusty's remains.",
        "Jennifer: You haven't found him. I knew it.",
        "Hal: You're happy about this?",
        "Jennifer: Dad, I don't want you to think that I'm being irrational, but -- Paul was still alive when you thought he was dead.",
        "Hal: Jen --",
        "Jennifer: No, and you still haven't found Dusty's body, even after Paul told you where he buried him.",
        "Hal: Paul could have been lying about the grave. Without a body, it's tougher to make a case against him.",
        "Jennifer: Or the whole confession could be a lie.",
        "Hal: Jen, I know you love Dusty and you want him back, but he's gone, honey.",
        "Jennifer: No, Dad, we have to stop looking for the grave and start looking for a trail, okay? If Dusty were kidnapped or if he's lying in a ditch somewhere hurt and alone, we have to get to him before it's too late!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You don't hate me enough to shoot me.",
        "Emily: I don't care about you enough not to.",
        "Dusty: Well, if you're going to shoot me, you gotta relax and look at me. Otherwise, you're going to miss. Look me in the eyes -- right in the eyes! Now take your shot.",
        "Emily: Any last requests?",
        "Dusty: Why'd you keep me alive so long if you're going to shoot me now? What changed?",
        "Emily: Paul confessed to your murder.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah, you told me that. But you never told tell me why.",
        "Emily: Just shut up and lie down! Face down.",
        "Dusty: Come on, it's my last request. I want to know why! He couldn't have thought he killed me. Why'd he confess?",
        "Emily: I already explained that to you. Obviously, you weren't listening. I'm not going to tell you again.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, I was. I was, I was. I remember now. For her. He confessed for her. What's her name?",
        "Emily: Shut up!",
        "Dusty: Come on, how could he be with another woman already?",
        "Emily: He thought that Meg killed you. So he confessed to protect her. And then she protected him. If it wasn't for Meg, none of this -- [Dusty chuckles] What the hell is so funny? What is so funny?",
        "Dusty: That's impossible. You really think Meg and Paul have something really going on?",
        "Emily: Oh, they do.",
        "Dusty: No, they don't! Because Meg loves me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Okay, so it's got to be Emily.",
        "Paul: Yeah. It all makes sense to me now.",
        "Meg: Now? Not before? It was easier to believe I'd done it?",
        "Paul: Well, you did believe that I did it.",
        "Meg: Well, you're capable of murder.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on.",
        "Meg: I'm not.",
        "Paul: We just don't know each other very well, do we?",
        "Meg: Well, maybe we'll have coffee sometime, if you ever get out of jail. Look, Paul, I have to talk to Hal.",
        "Paul: Hal? Emily's ex-husband Hal? Hal who hates my guts Hal?",
        "Meg: Okay, Jack. Jack -- but we have to let the police in on this.",
        "Paul: No. No, don't. Look, if Dusty is alive, his only chance is that Emily not figure out that we're on to her.",
        "Meg: Or your plan can backfire, and both you and Dusty could end up dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Nick, I know you're mad at me for telling Jack about Carly.",
        "Nick: Katie --",
        "Lisa: Carly? What does Carly have to do with anything?",
        "Nick: Oh, no, nothing.",
        "Katie: Carly is the reason that Nick got into trouble.",
        "Nick: We don't know that.",
        "Katie: See? She's still working him. She's got him believing that butter wouldn't melt, when you and I both know that Carly Snyder is capable of anything and everything.",
        "Lisa: Huh, is that so? Well, just don't worry about it. Stronger men than you have been brought down by that broad.",
        "Katie: So you'll let him in the room?",
        "Lisa: No, I'm sorry, darling, I can't do that.",
        "Katie: Even for the man who saved the lives of people in your family? Nick is the guy that got rid of the bomb at WOAK. Do you remember?",
        "Lisa: Oh. Well, of course -- that was so brave. That was so good of you. If it hadn't been for you, well, half of the town would have been blown to bits.",
        "Katie: He saved so many people's lives that day, people we both know and love. Lisa, please, just give Nick the chance to save his own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We're still fighting, aren't we?",
        "Jack: You're holding out on me, Carly. You know more about what happened to Nick than you're saying.",
        "Carly: Are you kidding? I am shocked by what happened to him. And if he's innocent, I hope he finds out who set him up so he can clear his name.",
        "Jack: You could help him do that right now, if you wanted to. But something's stopping you.",
        "Carly: How can I help unless I know where that heroin came from? And I have no idea, Jack. All I have is a gut instinct that someone planted it. And I hope they get what they deserve.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. Here, have some more champagne.",
        "Carly: Look, if you want to talk about it, we can talk about it. But don't try to do some number on me.",
        "Jack: Because you're the only one allowed to do that, right? That's a nice outfit, honey.",
        "Carly: I hate it when we fight. I just wanted to make up.",
        "Jack: I thought you might put on the Galaxy girl uniform, since you bought it as a turn-on for me -- oh, right, that was a lie.",
        "Carly: I was just trying to help --",
        "Jack: To help me, yes! And that makes everything okay. And now I'm supposed to make love to you and think that it's special. That I'm special.",
        "Carly: You are.",
        "Jack: Right. Right!",
        "Carly: Jack!",
        "Jack: Honey, I'm the idiot who believed that you were spending your nights here with our kids. I'm the loser who had no idea that my wife was moonlighting stripping for a bunch of drunks!",
        "Carly: I did not strip!",
        "Jack: Letting them put their hands all over her!",
        "Carly: I never let anybody touch me. No one!",
        "Jack: You know what, honey? You know what they were thinking? That for the right price, they could have you. That they could take you the way you want me to take you right now.",
        "Carly: You know that's not true.",
        "Jack: Why? Because our marriage is special?",
        "Carly: It is. Jack -- it is. Jack, it is.",
        "Jack: That's just one more lie.",
        "Carly: Is that why you're still mad at me? Because you think I stripped in that club? I didn't, Jack. I just waited tables.",
        "Jack: Well, you still had to dress sexy, act sexy, right? Or they would have fired you, right? Right?",
        "Carly: Every time I went into that club, I just went there for one reason -- so I could get information to help you.",
        "Jack: Information from Anatoly?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Jack: And what did you have to do for Anatoly to get that information for me, Carly?",
        "Carly: Nothing.",
        "Jack: So you didn't flirt with him? Or stand close to him? Or take money from him?",
        "Carly: I had to do the job -- you know, if I was going to be able to stay there --",
        "Jack: I just bet Nick loved watching you work it behind my back.",
        "Carly: -- But I didn't mean it.",
        "Jack: How hard did you work it, Carly?",
        "Carly: Will you stop it, Jack? I love you! What I did in that club was a means to an end.",
        "Jack: And what is this a means to, hmm? What's all this?",
        "Carly: What do you want me to do? You want me to go upstairs and change into flannel pajamas, Jack? You want me to swear on a stack of bibles that I had nothing to do with Nick's arrest? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to get on my knees and beg you to forgive me for working at the Galaxy? 'Cause I'll do it! Just tell me what you want and I'll do it. Say you forgive me. Say it! Please forgive me. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What do you want me to do?",
        "Nick: All right -- can you be Carly?",
        "Katie: She was here?",
        "Nick: Do you want to help me or not?",
        "Katie: Okay. Just call me Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Luke, if we can keep up this fake love affair, you can be free. Don't you owe it to yourself --?",
        "Luke: Jade -- Jade, you're not my friend, so drop the act. You're using me.",
        "Jade: I just want to be a part of this family, and I need your help to do that. And if you're not going to give it, I'll do what I have to.",
        "Luke: That's cold.",
        "Jade: Cold? I'm just being honest. You're lying to your parents because you're uncomfortable with being gay.",
        "Luke: I don't want to hurt them, Jade.",
        "Jade: Then don't! But don't accuse me of using you. Because we're using each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You sound like you're condoning this relationship.",
        "Holden: I didn't say that.",
        "Lily: You said that Jade might be a good thing for Luke.",
        "Holden: She can be.",
        "Lily: How? By teaching him everything he needs to know about sex?",
        "Holden: You know what? This has been a very rough year for Luke. He almost died, he was confused about us for a very long time, he started drinking, got involved with that Kevin kid.",
        "Lily: Yeah, he's a teenager. Nothing about that is abnormal. I just -- you know, sometimes I wonder if you --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: If you hadn't been so hard-nosed about him hanging out with Kevin, maybe he wouldn't have turned to Jade.",
        "Holden: Kevin is a bad influence.",
        "Lily: And Jade is a good one?",
        "Holden: Jade is a pretty girl, and that can be very powerful at his age. And if we make the wrong move here, he will leave with Jade, and we will lose him.",
        "Lily: No, I will not let that happen.",
        "Holden: Oh, just like your mother didn't let us happen? All I'm saying is, let's see how this plays out. If you call the cops and get Jade hauled off, Luke will run away.",
        "Lily: No, he won't.",
        "Holden: Why do we have to send her out the door tonight?",
        "Lily: I can't believe you want her to stay. Wait -- is there something you're not telling me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You think Meg loves you? She wants you dead so bad she can taste it.",
        "Dusty: Uh-uh. She wants me back.",
        "Emily: You dumped her. She's moved on to Paul. But I showed them. I pointed the cops into Meg's direction. She's out on bail now, but that's okay. 'Cause as soon as you're out of the way, I'm gonna let the cops know that she did it. That Meg did it. I gotta plant some evidence. I've got to something of Meg's and leave it near you, near your body. And then I'll call Jennifer -- no, I'll write her an anonymous note.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no. Jennifer's not gonna buy that. She really knows that Meg loves me. And so do you. It's the same way you feel about Paul, even though he left you. He left you, and you can't let go.",
        "Emily: He was supposed to marry me!",
        "Dusty: Are you really doing this to keep them apart? Emily -- Emily, you're wasting your time. Paul's never going to marry Meg. She's got nothing to offer. She can't save him now. But you can -- if you keep me alive.",
        "[Emily sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I can find Dusty.",
        "Meg: Yeah, you've done a bang-up job so far. Did you notice you're in a cage? I'm talking to Jack.",
        "Paul: Don't -- no, you're not.",
        "Meg: He could have Emily watched -- followed -- and then she could take us straight to Dusty.",
        "Paul: No, you're not.",
        "Meg: And why should that stop me?",
        "Paul: Because you trust me.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Yeah --",
        "Paul: I did confess to a crime I didn't commit for you.",
        "Meg: Okay, so you had one good moment.",
        "Paul: And you were protecting me, too.",
        "Meg: Temporary insanity. I'm all better now.",
        "Paul: I can do this. I can find Dusty. Please let me fix everything. Not just for Jennifer, but for you, too.",
        "Meg: And while you're at it, you'll get yourself out of jail?",
        "Paul: I have to. I know that orange is the new black, but those jumpsuits make my butt look enormous.",
        "Meg: I don't know, your butt looks pretty good to me. [Meg laughs] I hope this works.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: If you keep me alive, you can get Paul off the hook. And I'm good on my promise. I won't say anything about this. In fact, we can make it look like you saved me. Paul will go free and he'll be grateful to you forever. He'll realize how much he needs you. I think he'll fall in love with you all over again.",
        "Emily: That will never happen. Close your eyes, Dusty. It'll make it easier.",
        "Dusty: When they come and get you, tell Jennifer Munson that my last thought was her, okay? [Cell phone ringing] You want to get that?",
        "Emily: No. This will only take a second. It can wait.",
        "Dusty: It might be your son, he might need you.",
        "Emily: It's not my son!",
        "Dusty: I'm just saying, after you shoot me, there's gonna be a lot of clean up. So if the calls important, I'd do that first.",
        "Emily: This'll only take a second.",
        "Dusty: I'll be here. Okay --",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: All right.",
        "Emily: Hello? Hello, are you there?",
        "Paul: Emily, I need to see you.",
        "Emily: Why? We already said our good-byes, remember?",
        "Paul: Yes. I shouldn't have asked you to go. I didn't mean it. And now it looks like I'm going to rot in here -- and it's all because of --",
        "Emily: All because of what?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter. You matter. I need you. I'm lost without you. Please, come.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: You owe me. So tell me who you think has Dusty.",
        "Paul: The worst mistake I ever made in my life was the moment I turned my back on you.",
        "Jack: It's called having sex, Carly. It happens.",
        "Carly: When it happens to us, it's called making love, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Why can't I remember?",
        "Katie: All right, let's just try it again, okay? You said that the room was empty, very dim -- there was champagne, which you drank.",
        "Nick: Yeah, a lot of it. And fast. I was nervous.",
        "Katie: Okay, let's go with that. What else do you do when you're nervous? Do you -- I don't know, hum? Pace back and forth?",
        "Nick: No -- I checked myself out --",
        "Katie: And how did you look?",
        "Nick: Everything got fuzzy. It started to get blurry.",
        "Katie: And that's when Carly came in?",
        "[Imitating Carly] Hello, Nick.",
        "Nick: No, she didn't say anything.",
        "Katie: Nothing?",
        "Nick: She poured me a drink over here at the table -- and then she slipped her top down over her shoulder, like a strip tease.",
        "Nick: Do that again.",
        "Katie: Which part?",
        "Nick: The strip tease part.",

        "Carly: I love making up, don't you?",
        "Jack: Do you really think this changes anything?",
        "Carly: It's a start. Where are you going?",
        "Jack: To work.",
        "Carly: In the middle of the night? When will you be home?",
        "Jack: I don't know.",
