        "Emily: Oh God, Ali, if I could find you -- yeah, hi Rachel. It's Emily Stewart. Can you do me a favor, please? I'm in the office off the boardroom, working on some sensitive material. Can you make sure I'm not disturbed? Thanks you. Great.",
        "[Emily puts in the porno DVD in the player]",
        "Emily: Ali. All right, baby girl. Show me where you are. Okay, there's got to be something. There's got to be a logo, or stationary, or something. Where are you? [Sound of door opening and closing] [Emily blocks the DVD so Dusty can't see it] Hi. I'm surprised to see you here. You're never here so early in the morning.",
        "Dusty: I'm not usually in charge of a company that's going through the worst crisis in decades.",
        "Emily: Oh, oh the E. Coli thing. I'm sorry. I'll get out of your way.",
        "Dusty: What's this?",
        "Emily: Nothing. Can I have that -- Dusty, shut that off! Dusty, it's none of your business!",
        "Dusty: This is the office of Worldwide Enterprises!",
        "Emily: What? You want me to apologize?",
        "Dusty: I want you to tell me what I just walked in on!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh, hi. Shhhh!",
        "Craig: I called the hospital to check on Ethan, they said he was already sent home.",
        "Lily: They sent him home early this morning. Come on in.",
        "Craig: That's so great. Where is everybody?",
        "Lily: Holden is sleeping. Oh Craig, it's so good to have him home. Now I have to call Bob, check on those other babies.",
        "Craig: No, I already checked. There's no new cases of E. Coli in the baby food. A couple of the younger kids are still in critical condition, but no deaths, yet thank God.",
        "Lily: Thank God is right. You know, I have to call Worldwide. I have to put some money aside, just to pay for the hospital bills. I know -- I know the lawyers are going to give me grief about it, but I have to do it.",
        "Craig: No, no, I already told you I'd take care of it.",
        "Lily: Craig, that is a very generous of you to offer. But I have to bite the bullet. I have to bring my mother in on this.",
        "Craig: Or you could can sign these papers.",
        "Lily: What are those?",
        "Craig: A win-win, for your company and those sick babies too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I was hoping you would do that.",
        "Meg: What? Wake up?",
        "Paul: Wake up smiling.",
        "Meg: As opposed to?",
        "Paul: As opposed to waking up, remembering that you decided to stay, jumping up and throwing on your clothes and running away.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe I'll do that later.",
        "Paul: What do you want to do now?",
        "Meg: This.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: We should get up.",
        "Gwen: I don't wanna.",
        "Will: Why not?",
        "[Shriek]",
        "Maddie: Whoo, huge spider. And that bathroom is freezing!",
        "Will: Well, at least it's inside.",
        "Gwen: And clean.",
        "Will: I've never seen three people clean up a bathroom so fast.",
        "Gwen: Well we sat on a lot of busses yesterday.",
        "Maddie: And drank a lot of coffee.",
        "Gwen: I figure if we start working, we should be able to get the rest of this place done by the end of the day.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess I could've gotten us something a little nicer.",
        "Maddie: Are you kidding? This place is great. I don't think anybody will find us here us here. I mean, who rents cabins in the middle of winter, on the upper peninsula of Michigan? Except maybe hunters, but -- and when we changed busses and everything, we ditched the car. I don't think anybody followed us.",
        "Will: So aside from being cold and dirty and filled with spiders, this place is perfect.",
        "Maddie: Absolutely. So when can we head into Canada?",
        "Will: Not for a while. We got to lay low for a bit, you know? Watch the news, make sure nobody files murder charges against you two, and we need to see if my brother's body turns up.",
        "Gwen: What if the police come looking for us?",
        "Will: They won't. I promise.",
        "[Knocking at the door]",
        "Maddie: Who could that be?",
        "Gwen: Who is it?",
        "Will: It's the sheriff. Can I help you?",
        "Sheriff: Sheriff Radcliffe.",
        "Will: Oh, hi. I'm here to collect the rent.",
        "Maddie: The rent?",
        "Sheriff: Well, being sheriff is just my day job. I own this cabin and a couple more down the road. Plus the local bar. And I run the snow plow.",
        "Gwen: Oh. You know, it's really nice to meet you. The money -- come on in.",
        "Sheriff: Oh, thank you. It looks like you got settled in okay. Sorry the place was such a mess. I didn't expect to have any more rentals until summer.",
        "Will: Yeah, the guy from the gas station said you'd be dropping by. So, this should cover us for a few days.",
        "Sheriff: How long you staying?",
        "Will: We're not sure.",
        "Sheriff: You folks got names?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm sorry. We're really, like, wiped out from the trip. My name's Angela. These are my friends. This is Claire and Jason.",
        "Maddie: Hi, nice to meet you.",
        "Sheriff: Pretty deserted here this time of year. How come you're here?",
        "Will: We're film makers from the University of Wisconsin. We're kind of setting up our final project, and we're out here scoping new locations and stuff. But we don't have that much money, so --",
        "Sheriff: What kind of movie?",
        "Maddie: It's a Blair Witch Project kind of thing, we want to add a comic twist, without losing the film noir feel.",
        "Sheriff: Uh-huh. Where's your camera?",
        "Maddie: Right here. We're all wired for video, so all we have to do is upload it on to our computers and we get the footage. For trips like this, this is all we need.",
        "Sheriff: Wonders never cease. Hey, you're out of firewood. There's plenty in the shed, right out back. I'll bring some in.",
        "Will: No, Sheriff, that's fine. We'll do that. Thank you though.",
        "Sheriff: One more thing. Keep the door locked. Sometimes some bad critters come roaming down through these parts.",
        "Maddie: You mean wild animals?",
        "Sheriff: And wild humans. Stay safe.",
        "Gwen: Is he gone?",
        "Will: Yeah, when he started asking about the camera --",
        "Gwen: That was incredible thinking, by the way.",
        "Will: Yeah, I mean, after all of the going over the names, and the cover story like a million times. If Maddie hadn't pulled out her phone --",
        "Gwen: But she did.",
        "Will: Yeah but, we'd be headed off to jail right now!",
        "Maddie: Mmm, I'm going to go explore a little bit.",
        "Gwen: I knew this would happen.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: You know, you gave up almost everything in your life. Basically threw it away. And now you're feeling sorry about it.",
        "Will: No, I am not!",
        "Gwen: Then why did you just freak out so much just now?",
        "Will: Because we can't afford to make mistakes like that. I mean, we're supposed to be filmmakers, and I forget to get a camera!",
        "Gwen: Will, you're not the only one in this. I mean, Maddie and I are part of this too. You know, we can take care of ourselves.",
        "Will: Yeah, okay. You're right.",
        "Gwen: Wait a minute, don't tell me I'm right just to shut me up. I mean, tell me what you're really thinking.",
        "Will: I'm thinking that my brother is dead. Maddie killed him, and you helped bury him. I should be grieving for him, but I'm not.",
        "Gwen: You know what? You should go home. You know, Maddie and I are going to be okay.",
        "Will: What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: You know, I'm responsible for killing your bother, too. And you didn't even get a chance to react, or even have any feelings about it, because you were already busy taking care of me. And that's messed up. I mean, that's not right!",
        "Will: I'm okay.",
        "Gwen: Will, I buried your brother, and I didn't tell you about it! And I know that you want to forgive me. I know that you're trying to forgive me. But, I mean, how can you? It's not working.",
        "Will: Gwen. I'm here because I want to be. When I think about what could've happened that night, if Maddie hadn't come along. Adam could've raped you.",
        "Gwen: Maybe he wouldn't have done anything at all.",
        "Will: But he grabbed you. Put his hands on you. You know, I'm mad because he was my brother, and that's why you trusted him. And I'm sad because Maddie saved your life and she wrecked her own. And if I'd have been there, Adam would probably still be dead. Because I would have been the one that killed him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Give me one good reason I shouldn't throw you out of the building.",
        "Emily: Why? Because I brought a DVD in here?",
        "Dusty: You're doing this to me during a corporate meltdown? Anybody could have walked through that door?",
        "Emily: No, that's not true. I called the office manager --",
        "Dusty: If you want to be a party girl, you do it on your own time. But you don't bring down the whole company, by bringing in this trash!",
        "Emily: It's not trash!",
        "Dusty: Oh, that's not trash?",
        "Emily: I know her!",
        "Dusty: You know her, the girl in the video? That's great, wonderful. Did you meet her through Cherie?",
        "Emily: Yeah, you're probably right. All right then, just go --",
        "Dusty: Hey --",
        "Emily: What do you want me do, okay? You want me to go? Where shall I go? Shall I go back to my office --?",
        "Dusty: Hey! I've been dealing with this all night! All right? This baby food mess, you know?",
        "Emily: Sorry. I'm sorry, how bad is it?",
        "Dusty: It's bad.",
        "Emily: Is Lucinda back?",
        "Dusty: I don't even think Lucinda knows yet, because Lily wants to tell her. I'm trying to respect that, but we've got to move.",
        "Emily: How can I help?",
        "Dusty: Who's the girl in the video? Hold on a sec. [Sighs] who is she to you?",
        "Emily: I just -- I thought she might be in trouble.",
        "Dusty: Why? Because she's a porn star?",
        "Emily: You don't see a problem with that?",
        "Dusty: Do you? She's gettin' paid. You're doing it downtown, she's doing it on film. What's the difference?",
        "Emily: None, I guess. I just wish things could be different for her. That's all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Coffee?",
        "Meg: Is that a ploy to keep me here?",
        "Paul: It would have to be pretty outstanding coffee to accomplish that.",
        "Meg: Smells outstanding.",
        "Paul: You smell outstanding.",
        "Meg: You know, I remember this beaten-up coffee pot. It was one of the first things I brought up here, when I was taking care of your gunshot wound.",
        "Paul: You want it back?",
        "Meg: Well, if Mama hasn't missed it by now --",
        "Paul: I'm not actually going to give it back, I just --",
        "Meg: It's mine.",
        "Paul: Possession is nine tenths of the law. I'll tell you what, I'll offer you a lease arrangement.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Meg: And how would that work?",
        "Paul: Well, when you sleep over here, you get to wake up in the morning and have outstanding coffee from your coffee pot.",
        "Meg: And when I don't?",
        "Paul: You'll have to settle for second best.",
        "Meg: I should get going.",
        "Paul: Okay, fine, you can have the coffee pot.",
        "Meg: Look Paul, I don't trust this.",
        "Paul: Why not?",
        "Meg: Because I don't understand it! Why are you living out in the woods, making coffee in a wood stove, when you have a gorgeous penthouse just sitting there, empty?",
        "Paul: I don't want to be around a lot of people, right now. Would you like some eggs? I could scramble some eggs, I've got bacon. Whatever you want.",
        "Meg: I want you to talk to me.",
        "Paul: When I first started having the visions, it shook me up. I kept seeing dangerous things. And everybody was dangerous, because they have these waves coming off of them. Anger, sadness, and disappointment, lust.",
        "Meg: Lust? What did that feel like?",
        "Paul: Lust is only fun for me when it's yours. I came up here to try to feel safe. Here -- where you healed me, body and soul. I thought I might find some peace.",
        "Meg: Did you?",
        "Paul: Last night, yes, finally. Hey, I'm not trying to put a lot of pressure on you.",
        "Meg: It was good waking up with you this morning. It made me happy.",
        "Paul: I'm glad.",
        "Meg: And I reached a decision.",
        "Paul: Oh, you have?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I've decided not to decide. To take this one day at a time.",
        "Paul: Okay. What's today look like?",
        "Meg: Well, right now, I'm going to check on Ethan.",
        "Paul: And after that?",
        "Meg: We'll see what the day brings.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You definitely need to look them over, but it doesn't look like you're going to have time for that.",
        "Lily: I'll make time over the next couple of days.",
        "Craig: Well, you know that the press has been at Worldwide around the clock?",
        "Lily: They're still there?",
        "Craig: Yeah. And so far, over a dozen attorneys representing parents of sick children have threatened to sue worldwide.",
        "Lily: I thought we'd have another day or so, at least.",
        "Craig: Right, things are heating up. So that's why I pushed to have these papers executed.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "Craig: See, what they would do is allow me to transfer my personal funds to Worldwide to settle any lawsuits. It also stipulates that the plaintiffs, they can't talk to the press, or seek relief in court.",
        "Lily: I don't know, Craig, I just feel like there's money in Worldwide that we could pull from to do this.",
        "Craig: Right, yeah, you could do that. But, when's the last time you saw the news?",
        "Lily: Late last night.",
        "Craig: Well, someone got a hold of that footage that you took for the baby food commercial, and now it's airing with the news story.",
        "Lily: This just goes from bad to worse. I've got to call my mother on this.",
        "Craig: Okay, well, here's the problem with that. Now, by the time you reach her, and she flies here, and you get her up to speed, you might be looking at a huge class action suit instead of some small settlements.",
        "Lily: She needs to know.",
        "Craig: Of course she does. And she will, but there's obvious precautions that need to take place in the meantime. Steps that Lucinda would want you to take. Lily, this is national news. Which would you prefer to see? Weeping mothers screaming that Worldwide nearly killed their babies? Or parents talking about how quickly and generously Worldwide stepped up and owned up to their mistake?",
        "Lily: Worldwide can't afford anymore bad publicity.",
        "Craig: No. And these papers would effectively put an end to it all.",
        "Lily: Okay. Okay, I'll just get my pen.",
        "Craig: You know I don't want to rush you. You should take look over these papers --",
        "Lily: Craig! Craig I trust you. Just give me a pen, please.",
        "Craig: Here.",
        "Craig: Is Ethan asleep?",
        "Lily: Sound asleep in his crib, next to Holden. I have to go down to Worldwide, talk to Dusty.",
        "Craig: You've spoken to him?",
        "Lily: No, no, no, not yet. It's just something I think that I should do in person. Could you do me a favor? Could you send me a copy of those papers as soon as you have officially filed them?",
        "Craig: Certainly.",
        "Lily: Thanks, can't thank you enough.",
        "Craig: No need for thanks. You said it best the other day. We're family. And you know how much family means to me.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Hi. Craig. Hi.",
        "Craig: How did I get to be so lucky? Two of the most beautiful women in the world in the same room.",
        "Meg: How's Ethan?",
        "Lily: He's doing great. The doctor said he's going to be just fine.",
        "Meg: I'm so happy to hear that.",
        "Craig: I tried to call you with the good news. But, I started to think that you'd dropped off the face of the earth. Where've you been?",
        "[Paul flashback]",
        "[Knocking at the door]",
        "Paul: I was just thinking about you.",
        "Faith: Hi, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Well, what's your specific deal with this girl? What are you talking about?",
        "Emily: There's just something about her. She had this haunted look in her eyes.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, drugs.",
        "Emily: Oh, no no no. Don't say that. I hope not. No, she looked like she didn't want to be there. You know, maybe she was forced.",
        "Dusty: Maybe you're reading into it.",
        "Emily: I want to find her. I want to talk to her. Dusty, how do I do that?",
        "Dusty: Well, look for a producer. A production name on it?",
        "Emily: No, there's nothing her, I looked.",
        "Dusty: Well then, you're going to have to use your connections to find another porn star for your story, because you're not going to find this one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Gwen: How is it out there?",
        "Maddie: Cold.",
        "Will: I'm gonna go get some wood. You want to come with me?",
        "Gwen: No, I'm going to stay here for a little bit. You okay?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, yeah. I'm just -- I'm thinking about all the work that we have to do. And um, listen, I'm gonna clean up one of the back rooms, so you and Will have some privacy for tonight.",
        "Gwen: No, you don't have to do that by yourself. We'll all clean up together.",
        "Maddie: No, I'll just take another room.",
        "Gwen: Maddie, why --",
        "Maddie: Gwen, I feel like an appendage, okay? I mean, you guys are married, and I know that we have to pretend that you're not so we don't get caught. But you are, and you want to be alone together, so --",
        "Gwen: Is this why you took off when Will and I were kissing earlier?",
        "Maddie: You knew I was here?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I mean, the arctic blast of wind was a big clue. Hey, why is it bothering you to see me kiss Will?",
        "Maddie: Because I'll never kiss anyone like that again!",
        "Gwen: Sure you will.",
        "Maddie: No, if Casey finds out that I killed his brother, he's gonna hate me. And if he doesn't find out, that means that I've been running my whole life. Which means I won't ever get to touch him, or see him again, or feel his arms around me.",
        "Gwen: Hey, you're going to work something out, okay?",
        "Maddie: How? How? Nothing is going to bring Adam back. And before I left Oakdale, I said terrible things to Casey so he wouldn't come and try to find me.",
        "Gwen: Maybe when we, you know, get settled someplace safe, you could write him a letter. And you could let him know that you didn't mean the things that you said.",
        "Maddie: I can't. Because if we do get away, we have to stay gone. Forever. You remember that day I came to you for advice on how to get Casey to sleep with me?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, of course.",
        "Maddie: We never did it.",
        "Gwen: Really?",
        "Maddie: We never made love, not even once. And I know because of what Louis did to me, I'm not a virgin anymore. But I don't want to go through my life not ever once making love to someone that I have feelings for.",
        "Gwen: You'll find someone.",
        "Maddie: But I love Casey. I'll never love anyone like that again.",
        "Gwen: Hey, come here.",
        "Will: Hey, I'll go get some more wood.",
        "Gwen: Wait. You know what? You know what we all need?",
        "Maddie: Fake passports and a lot of cash?",
        "Gwen: No, we need a fantastic breakfast. Come on, let's walk into town and get something to eat.",
        "Maddie: You know what, you two go ahead.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no, come on, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: No, the fire needs some more logs, and I'm going to make this place nice and cozy for you.",
        "Gwen: You're sure?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, bring back some stuff for s'mores, okay?",
        "Will: Don't go outside without us. And latch the door.",
        "Gwen: We'll be right back. Okay?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, don't take too long.",
        "Gwen: All right.",
        "[Loud knocking]",
        "Maddie: Gwen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Just a second. Before you get comfortable, I have a few questions for you.",
        "Faith: Like what?",
        "Paul: Did you run away from a therapy session?",
        "Faith: No.",
        "Paul: Are you skipping school? Did you climb out of a window?",

        "Paul: So, how's your mom doing?",
        "Faith: She's okay, I guess. She's at the farm with my dad and Ethan. I guess Luke, Natalie, and I make too much noise.",
        "Paul: Oh, I doubt that.",
        "Faith: She yelled at me. Because you took Ethan. Like it was my fault.",
        "Paul: Oh, I won't take it personally. She was scared. Sometimes when people are scared, they do crazy things. I'm sure that now she knows that Ethan's going to be okay, she's probably going back to being herself again.",
        "Faith: I don't think so.",
        "Paul: Why not?",
        "Faith: Because now she knows that what happened to Ethan and those other babies was her fault.",
