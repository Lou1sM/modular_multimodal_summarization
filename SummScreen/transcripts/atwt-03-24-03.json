        " Bonnie: It must've taken everything you had to get up there and make \r\n\tthat statement in front of everyone. Ben -- will you take her home for me?\r\n\t",
        "Ben: Hey, no problem. ",
        "Bonnie: I need to run by the club and check on a few things. ",
        "Ben: Okay. ",
        "Bonnie: Okay, I'll call you later? ",
        "Jessica: Yeah. ",
        "Bonnie: Okay. ",
        "Ben: Ready to get out of here? ",
        "Jessica: Like you wouldn't believe. ",
        "Reporter #1: Ms. Griffin, can we get a comment, please? ",
        "[Reporters talking over each other] ",
        "Reporter #3: Were you the victim of acquaintance rape? ",
        "Ben: Ms. Griffin is not prepared to make any statements tonight. Thank \r\n\tyou. ",
        "[Reporters talking over each other] ",
        "Jessica: Okay, okay. All right. Yes, I was raped. ",
        "[Reporters react] ",
        "Jessica: Yes, I am accusing T. Marshall Travers. And we'll be going to \r\n\ttrial in three weeks. And, yes, you have permission to use my name. Thank \r\n\tyou. Let's go. ",
        "Reporter #3: One more question -- ",
        "Reporter #1: We need more! ",
        "[Reporters talking over each other] ",
        "Marshall: When am I gonna be able to get out of here? ",
        "Newman: Soon as I file this with the county clerk, you'll be a free man.\r\n\t",
        "[Reporters talking over each other] ",
        "Marshall: I don't know how \"free\" I'm actually gonna be. Every reporter \r\n\tfrom here to Chicago's gonna beat a path to my door. ",
        "Newman: Look on the bright side. You're not going to jail. ",
        "Marshall: I've been forced into a three-ring circus, though. ",
        "[Reporters talking over each other] ",
        "[Door closes] ",
        "Marshall: And thanks to Jessica, I'm the main attraction. ",

        "Mike: You -- you want to get married to me? I'm sorry. I'm just -- I'm a \r\n\tlittle confused. I mean, I just finished saying that this isn't the right \r\n\ttime for us to live together again, and you suggest that we get married. ",
        "Molly: I've never been more serious in my life. ",
        "Mike: We've barely been civil to each other before today. ",
        "Molly: I know, but that doesn't mean that we ever stopped loving each \r\n\tother. ",
        "Mike: You've made it abundantly clear that you're not real wild about me \r\n\tbeing the father to Carly's child. ",
        "Molly: Mike, okay, we've both said things that we wish that we could \r\n\ttake back. I mean, some ideas, they just take some time to get used to. ",
        "Mike: But -- how? I mean, where's all this coming from? ",
        "Molly: It's because of what Carly said. Mike, if we keep dragging our \r\n\tfeet on the way back to each other, we could lose our way, and it could be \r\n\ttoo late. And life is too short to waste a minute of it. Okay, I mean, look \r\n\tat what happened to her. She was fine. The baby was fine. Her pregnancy was \r\n\tchugging right along. And then bam! Her blood pressure skyrockets. The baby \r\n\tgets in distress. And they're in the hospital, fighting for her life and \r\n\tfighting for the baby's life. You think that we have forever, but we don't. \r\n\tOkay? 'Cause you know what? I learned that the hard way. Because Jake and I \r\n\tmade that mistake. I don't want to make that mistake again. Mike, not with \r\n\tyou. So -- this is a leap. I know. But we were really great together, right? \r\n\tI mean, before all this happened, we were. We made each other laugh -- a \r\n\tlot. Right? And we fit. I mean, we really fit. And I know that, when you and \r\n\t\u00a0somebody fit like that, you don't let it go. You grab on. So I know this \r\n\tsounds really sudden and a bit loony. But we were really great. And I know \r\n\tthat we can be really great again. I know that. So what do you think? ",
        "",
        "Carly: Let me tell you something, Craig. If you allow Rosanna to hand \r\n\tMonte Carlo over to Barbara, I will murder the three of you and let the \r\n\tbuzzards pluck out your eyes. Do you understand me? ",
        "Craig: That's not exactly the kind of positive image an expectant mother \r\n\tshould be carrying around. ",
        "Carly: Just keep Barbara Ryan away from my fall collection. ",
        "Craig: There's no way that Barbara Ryan is gonna get involved with Monte \r\n\tCarlo. ",
        "Carly: Really? Well, then why was she just here, pretending that she and \r\n\tRosanna are concerned about my health? She seemed a little too interested in \r\n\tmy ability to finish the designs on time, Craig. I think she's salivating \r\n\tover the prospect of taking over for me. ",
        "Craig: Well, don't worry about Barbara. Let me handle Barbara -- and \r\n\tRosanna. ",
        "Nurse #4: Mrs. Snyder? Your sister's outside. She'd like to leave a gift \r\n\tfor you. ",
        "Carly: Is it ticking? ",
        "Nurse #4: I beg your pardon? ",
        "Carly: Let her come in, please. ",
        "Craig: Remember your blood pressure. ",
        "Carly: Remember my promise to dismember her. ",
        "Rosanna: Hello, Carly! How you feeling? Craig. I had no idea you'd be \r\n\there. I guess I should've guessed. Well, I just came to drop off this little \r\n\tbasket. Won't keep you. But I think this should keep you busy for a little \r\n\twhile. ",
        "Carly: That is so nice of you. You want to keep me busy. To want to keep \r\n\tmy mind off Monte Carlo. What would I do without you, Rosanna? ",
        "Craig: Why don't we let Carly alone in peace, huh? ",
        "Carly: No, no, no! No, please, don't rush away on my account, Craig. At \r\n\tleast, not until Rosanna gets what she came here for. ",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. What do you think it is I came here for? ",
        "Carly: Please. You want to see my dreams go up in smoke. Well, I'm sorry \r\n\tto disappoint you, sis. But you're wasting your time. Because that is not \r\n\tgoing to happen. ",
        "Rosanna: Could somebody please explain to me what is going on? ",
        "Craig: Barbara evidently appeared here after your little meeting, asking \r\n\tCarly questions about her health and how she was gonna make her deadline.\r\n\t",
        "Rosanna: And you think I have something to do with that? ",
        "Carly: You hired Barbara to replace me because you are desperate to see \r\n\tme fail. ",
        "Rosanna: Oh, that's absolute nonsense. No one hired anyone. I simply \r\n\tasked Barbara to come up with a few designs to shadow you. ",
        "Carly: \"Shadow\" me? ",
        "Rosanna: Yes. I would not be a responsible executive if I didn't come up \r\n\twith a contingency plan, now, would I? ",
        "Craig: Let's go, all right? ",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes, by all means. Let's leave before someone accuses me of \r\n\ttrying to sabotage her health by my mere presence! ",
        "Craig: Yes -- ",
        "Carly: Too late for that! ",
        "Rosanna: You are aware that I had nothing to do with Barbara showing up \r\n\there in Carly's room tonight. ",
        "Craig: You're the one who called her up. ",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm having a few hesitations about Carly being able to \r\n\tcome up with those designs by -- ",
        "Craig: Carly was made for this. Okay? So please inform Barbara that her \r\n\tbackup is no longer required. ",
        "Rosanna: I am not going to allow you to make a choice that is going to \r\n\tdrive Monte Carlo into the ground. ",
        "Craig: I thought Monte Carlo was mine. ",
        "Rosanna: It was a gift! ",
        "Craig: I didn't realize there were strings attached. ",
        "Rosanna: You are making a decision based on -- what, habit? \r\n\tSentimentality? ",
        "Craig: On talent. On notoriety. On loyalty. ",
        "Rosanna: Loyalty?! When are you gonna be loyal to me? ",
        "Craig: Rosanna, this is business, not fidelity. All right? And if I \r\n\twanted a woman to control me, I could've stayed with Sierra. All right, when \r\n\tare you gonna trust me on this? ",
        "Rosanna: Well, when are you gonna trust me?! This is ridiculous. I mean, \r\n\tlisten to us. We're fighting over a company. Are we really gonna let \r\n\tsomething as vain as Monte Carlo come between us? ",
        "",
        "Molly: Mike, if we're married, then I get a whole new foundation to \r\n\tbuild on. Because I'll know that you love me because you'll have promised to \r\n\tlove me forever. ",
        "Mike: You mean, like a guarantee. That no matter what happened before, \r\n\tI'm yours now. You cannot rely on a piece of paper to give you the things \r\n\tthat you want. If you can't feel it in your heart, then -- there's just a \r\n\tlot of things that we need to work through and the timing is wrong. ",
        "Molly: Because of Carly. ",
        "Mike: She needs me. As a friend, all right? As the guy who tells her the \r\n\ttruth, no strings attached. I mean, when I finally get married, I want to be \r\n\table to give my wife my undivided attention. And right now, I am just not in \r\n\tthe position to do that. ",
        "Molly: So -- Carly gets Jack to coddle her, Emma to nurse her back to \r\n\thealth, Craig to keep her from losing her company and you to be the perfect \r\n\tdaddy. And what do I get? Nada. ",
        "Mike: Molly, don't start resenting Carly now, especially after you guys \r\n\tjust started patching things up. ",
        "Molly: Do you know how sick I am of talking about me and Carly, Mike? \r\n\tWhat about me and you? ",
        "Mike: Molly, look, you know that I'd love to put ourselves -- ",
        "Molly: You know what? Just do me a favor, Mike. Forget that whole \r\n\tproposal thing. Forget that I ever spouted that out of my mouth. Because I \r\n\tdon't know what I was thinking. But I'm gonna promise you something. I am \r\n\tgonna vow that you will never have to worry about me distracting you from \r\n\tCarly's needs ever again. ",

        "Ben: Bunch of jackals. How you feeling? ",
        "Jessica: I'm okay. I guess you should be getting back to the hospital.\r\n\t",
        "Ben: Yeah, yeah. ",
        "Jessica: I saw you on your cell phone, and the look on your face, I \r\n\tthought maybe something must be wrong with a patient or something. ",
        "Ben: No. ",
        "Jessica: Is everything okay? ",

        "Kim: Jess, we couldn't believe our ears when we heard the news. Is there \r\n\tanything that we can do for you? ",
        "Jessica: No, thank you. Thank you, both of you. I'm fine. Or at least I \r\n\twill be. ",
        "Ben: Now that I see you're not alone here, I'm gonna get going. ",
        "Kim: Listen, we didn't mean to run you off. ",
        "Ben: No, never. Really, I -- I have some loose ends I need to tie up. \r\n\tCall you later, okay? ",
        "Jessica: Okay. ",
        "Ben: Now, look -- you lock this door behind me. You don't let anybody in \r\n\tunless you know them. ",

        "Isaac: Not too busy. ",
        "Bonnie: You know, I was really hoping you'd show up at the courthouse \r\n\tfor Marshall's arraignment today. My mom could've really used your support, \r\n\talong with mine and Ben's. ",
        "Isaac: Ben was there? ",

        "Bonnie: Look -- I know you don't necessarily have faith in my mother's \r\n\tversion of events, especially thanks to that letter Marshall wrote -- which \r\n\twe should never have read. But -- I want you to be really careful with what \r\n\tyou say to Ben. Honey, I know he's your brother. But if you have doubts and \r\n\topinions, I really wish that you would keep them to yourself? Please. \r\n\tBecause she is my mother, Isaac. And she needs validation right now from \r\n\teverybody who loves her. ",
        "Isaac: Sweetie, you had doubts yourself about what happened that night.\r\n\t",
        "Bonnie: But now I don't. I'm standing next to my mother. And I think, \r\n\tright now, that if there was ever a time we should stand together, this is \r\n\tit. ",
        "Isaac: I just hope that you're not asking me to lie for you. ",
        "Bonnie: No. I would never ask you to do that. You know that. But just \r\n\ttry to remember that my mother is the same person she was before Marshall \r\n\tcame to Oakdale. Because you were crazy about her. And she was your number \r\n\tone supporter when you came to fight for me in Scotland. She's still that \r\n\tsame person, Isaac. And if you think that she's become a liar and a cheat \r\n\tovernight, and that you are without any faults -- and can't believe in \r\n\tforgiveness -- then do me a favor -- just keep it to yourself.

        "Bonnie: Okay. ",
        "Ben: Is that the letter? ",
        "Isaac: Yeah. I was just talking to Bonnie, and she was saying, if I had \r\n\tany doubts, I should probably keep them to myself. And she might be right.\r\n\t",
        "Ben: She is. So just stop talking and let me read it. Draw my own \r\n\tconclusions. ",

        "Ben: Suddenly, I'm not so sure I want to know what's inside. ",
        "Isaac: Then why'd you come over here all worked up? You looked at that \r\n\tletter like it was the answer to every question you ever had. ",

        "Margo: Well, I had business I had to attend to out of town. Although I \r\n\treally would have enjoyed watching you get pinned with charges you probably \r\n\tthought you could duck. But never fear, Mr. Travers. You'll get your day in \r\n\tcourt. Every accused rapist does. ",
        "Marshall: Wait a minute. If -- if you're trying to equate me with the \r\n\tvicious deviant who attacked you, you're very much mistaken and way out of \r\n\tline. ",

        "Rosanna: Oh, plans were made to be broken. The only plans that really \r\n\tmatter are our plans to be a family. We can't have that if we just keep \r\n\tsnapping at each other and turning into our worst selves. ",
