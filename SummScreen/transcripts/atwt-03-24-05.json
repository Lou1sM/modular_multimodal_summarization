        "Jennifer: You are unbelievable. I tell you not to threaten me and you respond by threatening me.",
        "Craig: No, I'm just stating the possibility. You can either wake up, stop trying to cut me off at the knees, accept the fact that we are a good team with a make-a-million-dollar deal in the works, or you can kiss life at that cozy cottage good-bye.",
        "Jennifer: So you don't care who gets caught in this. Mike has done nothing to you. And you won't think twice about making him suffer just so you can get back at me.",
        "Craig: I'm not the one hurting him. It's your choice. But you don't have to hurt him. You don't have to leave him. You can have it all, Jennifer. All you need to do is embrace the status quo at Street Jeans.",
        "Jennifer: This is blackmail.",
        "Craig: This is business.",
        "Jennifer: You really are a monster.",
        "Craig: No. I am a business man. But you are self-destructing. And maybe that's what this is all about. It's not really you cheated on your boyfriend. Maybe it's just you realized you're more like your mother than you want to admit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: And your response to finding her there on the floor was to wipe the place clean of prints?",
        "Carly: We panicked. I know how stupid it was.",
        "Jack: It was criminal, Carly, for anyone to do. But you -- you're the wife of a police detective!",
        "Lily: It's not her fault. I'm the one who wiped the place clean. Carly just kept my secret.",
        "Carly: Jack! Jack!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Tom, Luke is just a kid. He's not even old enough to get a driver's license. And you want to try him as an adult? What are you trying to prove?",
        "Tom: Given the severity of the crime and the fact that Luke is showing no remorse.",
        "Holden: Why don't you consider the fact that you've known him practically all his life? I mean, he's never committed a crime.",
        "Tom: This is not personal, Holden. The state attorney general is putting the screws to my office on this one. And I'm sorry it's turned out this way.",
        "Holden: Tom, come on. He can't go to prison. I mean, you know better than anyone what happens to kids in prison. Is this what you really want for him? Do you really think that he deserves that?",
        "Tom: I wish I could tell you what you want to hear. But all I can do is give you the facts.",
        "Luke: How many times do I have to say it before somebody believes me?",
        "Jessica: Luke, it is my job to give you the best defense possible. And the way to do that is to show reasonable doubt.",
        "Luke: But I made a confession. I mean, nobody's -- nobody's going to have any doubt after that.",
        "Jessica: There still can be mitigating circumstances.",
        "Luke: But they have my fingerprint, right? I mean, they know I had a motive.",
        "Jessica: So did some other people.",
        "Luke: But I did it alone. Nobody else had anything to do with it besides me.",
        "Holden: Especially not your mother. Right?",
        "Jessica: Holden, I'm doing everything I can.",
        "Holden: I know. I know. The rest is up to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Your son murders my sister, and you ask me for help? What kind of help? What -- why would I do anything for you?",
        "Lily: 'Cause Luke is not responsible. I am.",
        "Keith: Yeah. You are. You're responsible for a lot of things. You left my sister unconscious, left her there to die, but then your son came along and finished the job. He confessed.",
        "Lily: He's protecting me.",
        "Keith: Protecting you, huh? He's willing to go to jail. He's 15 years old, don't you think that's a little extreme?",
        "Lily: No. Not for Luke. He's been covering my tracks ever since this happened. Burning a pair of gloves that I left behind at Julia's apartment, hanging around the crime scene to see if there's any more evidence that would incriminate me.",
        "Keith: Well, maybe he was hanging around to see if there was anything that was going to incriminate him.",
        "Lily: You suspected me from the beginning, and you were right. I killed Julia.",
        "Keith: So all that talk was all just garbage? You know, how it was an accident, you didn't mean to hurt her -- it was just a lie?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Keith: Why are you -- why don't you go to the police with this then?",
        "Lily: Because the police won't listen to me. They think they have their man, but they're wrong. I am the woman that you want, and you are the only one that can make me pay.",
        "Lily: I cannot let my son go to jail for a crime he did not commit.",
        "Keith: Well, you had no problems sitting back, letting me take the rap.",
        "Lily: I know. And I'm sorry. I was a coward. I saw a way out, and -- but please, I'm trying to make things right, now.",
        "Keith: I don't know whether you killed Julia or not. Frankly, I don't care. But the fact that you're going to watch your son go to jail for something that you may or may not have done -- that's what you deserve. That's two for the money, and I can live with that.",
        "Lily: No, no, you can't. Please. You cannot leave until you hear everything that I have to say. I know how much you hate me --",
        "Keith: You haven't even scratched the surface.",
        "Lily: Please, don't take your hatred of me out on an innocent child. I was willing to let you go to prison because I thought I could get away with it. I thought I could start my life over again, get my husband back, my family back together again.",
        "Keith: Yeah, you were going to go on your merry way, while I took the rap.",
        "Lily: I told myself I couldn't care about you because you were Julia's brother.",
        "Keith: Oh.",
        "Lily: You practically condoned your sister destroying my marriage.",
        "Keith: See, now, there you go, trying to pin it on my sister again, even though you know that she had full cooperation from your husband -- you know that.",
        "Lily: Do you want to hear my story?",
        "Keith: No, I don't want to hear anymore stories. Why is yours any different?",
        "Lily: Because this one -- leaves absolutely nothing out, I promise you. When I found out that Julia had stolen drugs and she was a fugitive, I thought that I had a way to force her out of Oakdale. And when I told her what I had learned, and what I wanted -- she laughed at me. She said she was here to stay. She and Holden were in love, and I would have to live with that. And that's when I wrote her this.",

        "Carly: Jack!",
        "Jack: What? Hey, buddy. Looks like somebody's been busy on the computer. What's going on?",
        "J.J.: I didn't want you to forget.",
        "Jack: Forget what?",
        "J.J.: Me. My mom. What it was like when we were a family. She hated my mom, but you didn't. You said you'd always care about us.",
        "Jack: And I meant it. Hey, come on over here for a second. Sit down. The time that I spent with you and your mom was a very special time in my life. I loved your mother very much. And when you love somebody, they're always a part of your life, J.J. doesn't matter where you go, or how much time passes.",
        "J.J.: Promise?",
        "Jack: I cross my heart. Hey, look, I couldn't forget your mother any more than I could forget you. You changed my life, buddy, in ways that I just can't explain. That's what happens when you love somebody. They change your life. You're a part of me. And I'm a part of you. Whether you like it or not. Hey, why don't you -- why don't you go see if you've left anything out back, so you can pack it up for your Uncle Keith, okay?",
        "J.J.: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey! Come on in.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, darling. I had a message that you wanted to see me urgently.",
        "Mike: Well, I didn't mean you had to drag yourself all the way up here. I planned on stopping by the big house.",
        "Lucinda: Well, no time like the present. Oh, my heavens. [Lucinda laughs] [Mike chuckles] Well, now that I have a bona fide celebrity living on my property, I have to make sure that the body behind Street Jeans has everything he needs.",
        "Mike: The only celebrity in this house is the designer.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, she's -- she's a find. She's a find. She's very talented. The company's taken off. Worldwide is lucky to have her.",
        "Mike: Yeah. So am I. And I'm glad we agree on that, because I think I have an idea that's gonna make all three of us a lot happier.",
        "Lucinda: I'm listening.",
        "Mike: Okay. What I'm suggesting is we'll send Jennifer's productivity through the roof, with like a zero chance of burnout.",
        "Lucinda: And how much is this going to set me back?",
        "Mike: Not a cent.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I like it already. But since Craig is Jennifer's liaison at the company, I think, perhaps, you should be speaking to him and not me about any plans you have.",
        "Mike: I'll tell you right now, he's gonna hate this idea. Because if you approve of what I'm thinking of, he's going to be seeing a lot less of Jennifer than he was before.",
        "Lucinda: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You want to do big business, you're stuck with me. Unless you want Mike to know all about our big night.",
        "Jennifer: I was half drunk --",
        "Craig: And having a meltdown about your mother, and about Mike, and you just have no idea how you ended up begging to get in my bed --",
        "Jennifer: I never begged you for anything.",
        "Craig: Grow up. Stop playing the victim, you're not. You're not a child, you knew exactly what you were getting into.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe you're right. You didn't force me to do anything I didn't want to do. But I'll be damned if I let you hold it over my head so that you can keep me in line. Street Jeans is my company. Those are my designs.",
        "Craig: What does that mean?",
        "Jennifer: That means that I can shut it down and set up shop elsewhere if I'm forced to.",
        "Craig: Whatever. But if you cut me out, you'll lose Mike. Well, then again, maybe you're not losing that much. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come looking for me.",
        "Craig: Now, I suggest you try to control your emotions. At least in public. And you think long and hard about the magnitude of this deal. I need to fill a progress report with Sierra and Tony Kwan. And I'm going to tell them that everything is hunky-dory. And then you and I are going to Singapore.",
        "Jennifer: I -- I told you I'm not going anywhere with you, Craig.",
        "Craig: We'll see.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Perfect.",
        "[Jennifer sighs]",
        "Dusty: Don't let him get to you.",
        "Jennifer: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Dusty: I saw Craig smiling on his way out. I figured somebody paid a high price for that. [Jennifer sighs] What'd he do this time?",
        "Jennifer: Nothing. I did it. I did it all to myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Are you ever going to speak to me again?",
        "Jack: I haven't decided.",
        "Carly: At least, maybe you could try --",
        "Jack: What, try and see it from your point of view, Carly? No, I can't. I guess it's the cop in me.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe you could try to stop being a cop for a minute and be my husband?",
        "Jack: A woman is dead. She was hurt. She was left to die alone. Alone, Carly. This is the same woman that nursed me back to health and took care of me. What'd you expect to happen here? We'd just forget the whole thing, sweep it under the rug, and get on with our lives as usual?",
        "Carly: I know what lily and I did was wrong, Jack --",
        "Jack: It was criminal. Heartless. And I know you don't see it that way. I know you don't. To you, you were being loyal to a friend. You get tunnel vision sometimes. I understand that, I get that. You've always been that way since the day we met. I never imagined you'd do this. I always thought that getting married and having sage and building a life together would change you in some way. I don't know. I guess it has, actually. Only I don't know what it's changed you into.",
        "Carly: I wanted to tell you the truth --",
        "Jack: You should've told me the truth! But instead, you covered up a murder! You made a fool out of me. You compromised my job, my career, you compromised the case, and God help you, Carly, -- God help you, 'cause you stood silently by while an innocent man was accused of murdering his own sister.",
        "Carly: When Lily came to me, she said that Julia was alive. We went back to Julia's, and Julia was dead. So we thought there might be a chance that Keith was the guilty.",
        "Jack: Yes, but you knew that there was a better chance that he wasn't. But you were too busy covering Lily's butt and your own. I mean, did it ever occur to you once to protect your husband?! We're supposed to be partners here! We're supposed to work as team! How am I ever supposed to trust you again?",
        "Carly: No, please, don't say that.",
        "Jack: Tell me something. Tell me something. When you thought I was gone forever after my car went off that bridge, did you bargain with God?",
        "Carly: 100 times a day.",
        "Jack: What'd you promise him? That if he just brought me back to you, that you'd never do anything to risk losing me again?",
        "Carly: Something like that.",
        "Jack: Yeah. How many times since then have you lied to him?",
        "Carly: Jack --",
        "Jack: How many times, Carly?",
        "Carly: Jack --",
        "Jack: How many times?",
        "Carly: Tell me -- tell me you're not thinking about leaving me over this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: No, Jess. No. I know my son. He did not do this.",
        "Jessica: So you're still sure he's protecting Lily.",
        "Holden: I think he's convinced himself that he's the only one who can. I need to talk to him.",
        "Jessica: No, I don't think that's a good idea. Every time he talks to you, every time he sees you, it seems to just strengthen his resolve to plead guilty.",
        "Holden: Just give me one more chance. I think I know how to get through to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: If Julia didn't leave town, you were gonna kill her. That's what you want me to believe?",
        "Lily: It's the truth.",
        "Keith: Not according to Carly.",
        "Lily: Carly only knows what I've told her. And I needed her help to hide the evidence and to clean up the fingerprints. I -- I only told Carly what I knew she would believe.",
        "Keith: And the police didn't find this letter because?",
        "Lily: Because I found it in her purse when Carly and I went back to clean up the apartment. And I took it. But you could put it back. You could just tell them that you found it when you were packing up her things. The police will not listen to me anymore, but they will listen to you. No one hated your sister more than I did. And when I found out that she was going after my husband, I wanted her to die, and I told her that that night.",
        "Keith: Look, I don't want to hear this.",
        "Lily: I told her that she was a woman with no morals, no heart, no soul. And that Jack and Holden and the rest of the world would be a much better place if she was dead, and I wanted her to die, so I pushed her. And she hit her head, and she fell to the ground, and I watched her suffer. I watched her beg for her life. I could have helped her, but I didn't. I could have called 911, but I didn't. I could have opened the door. You were right there, knocking on the door! I could have opened it and let you come in and help, but I needed her to die, because if she was dead, then I could get my life back.",
        "Keith: You watched my sister die?",
        "Lily: Yes. And when she finally died, finally died, I felt like I could breathe again.",
        "Keith: What about J.J.?! What about him?! Didn't you even care?!",
        "Lily: What, did she care?! About my children, about my family?! Why should I shed a tear for that woman and her child?!",
        "Keith: You know, you're sick. You're really sick.",
        "Lily: Oh, she was sick. And there's another special name for a woman like that. But I'm not gonna say it. But someday -- someday we'll fill her son in on exactly what that is.",
        "Keith: You don't know anything about Julia. She wasn't trash. She was my sister. And I loved her. And so did your husband, okay? Yeah, you keep trying to blame her. But he saw the million great things about my sister. That's why he was in love with her, and that's why he's never, ever gonna be in love with you again.",
        "Lily: Your sister turned me into the kind of person that my husband can't love anymore. And whatever you think of me, I'm not the kind of person to sacrifice my own son. So please -- please give the police this letter, please.",
        "Keith: Why should I?",
        "Lily: Because very soon, the police will realize they have no case against Luke, and he'll be set free. He'll come home, and I will take this letter, and I will burn it. And this conversation between the two of us never happened. It's really up to you, Keith. If you want justice for Julia, it's in your hands what happens next.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack? Are you planning on leaving me?",
        "Jack: Walking out that door and never looking back seems like a pretty good solution right now. But after the year that Sage and Parker have had, I don't think I could do that to them.",
        "Carly: So your generosity is for the sake of the children. Forgive me if I don't thank you for that.",
        "Jack: Do what you're gonna do, Carly. You're gonna anyway. I tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna stop pretending that there's a partnership here, that we're in this together. And I know you're not perfect, neither am I, but I thought at least some things were sacred.",
        "Carly: I know what I did was wrong, Jack. But would you have believed us if Lily and I went to you and told you the truth about what happened that night? That things got out of hand, that Julia pushed Lily, that Lily pushed her back, that Julia accidentally fell and hit her head on a table?!",
        "Jack: Yes! Yes, I would have. But you didn't play it that way, Carly. You played it your own way. And now a woman's dead.",
        "Carly: And I am sorry about that. I will always be sorry about that.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, that makes two of us.",
        "Carly: Please try to understand.",
        "Jack: Don't try to justify what happened, Carly. And stop blaming Julia for her own death! She didn't deserve this, and neither did J.J.! And no amount of excuses is gonna change the fact that there's a little boy that's gonna grow up without his mother.",
        "Carly: I know that you're angry, Jack. But just keep in mind that I am not the person who hurt Julia that night.",
        "Jack: No. No, I know you didn't hurt her. You didn't exactly help her either. You could have helped Julia. You could have helped me.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry if I compromised your job, Jack. But I am not sorry that I stood by Lily. If it was Holden who needed your help, you would have done the same thing.",
        "Jack: If that's what you think, you don't know the first thing about me. There are some things, Carly, you just don't do. Even for people you love.",
        "Carly: Well, I guess that's the difference between us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: So what do you think? Do you approve?",
        "Lucinda: Approval granted. I like -- I think it's just -- it's tremendous. What does Jennifer think?",
        "Mike: I haven't told her yet. It's a surprise.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, she's just so lucky, having a guy like you in her corner.",
        "Mike: Well, I'm not gonna win boyfriend of the year award anytime soon. I missed her big night at Metro, and I'm trying to make it up to her.",
        "Lucinda: An artist's studio right here in my cottage. Tremendous.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I mean, you know, that way, whenever she has to burn the midnight oil, she won't have to sleep on that sofa in her office.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. Got it. And you're right. Craig is not gonna like this, not at all. He does so enjoy monopolizing the talent's time.",
        "Mike: Now, those days are over. Too much exposure to Craig isn't good for anybody.",
        "Lucinda: Amen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I told myself that I could have it all. I could have a fabulous career, a man who loves me, a happy life.",
        "Dusty: Who says you can't? Craig? What's he doing, trying to make you feel like you and your company are nothing without him, that somehow he made you?",
        "Jennifer: That's not quite it.",
        "Dusty: Well, whatever it is, everyone knows he'd be nothing without Street Jeans -- or you. So don't let him get under your skin.",
        "Jennifer: I know. I know. I guess the stress is just getting to me. But I'm fine. I'm fine. I can handle Craig.",
        "Dusty: Until you find yourself in the middle of thin ice.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I don't think I'm in any imminent danger. So thanks for the chat, but really, I'm fine.",
        "Dusty: I've seen you fine, and this ain't it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Miss Jennifer needs a little more time before we can -- go to Singapore, but I managed to convince Tony Kwan's people that postponing the meeting was advantageous for them.",
        "Sierra: Well, that's good news.",
        "Craig: It certainly is. Why? What's wrong? This is a huge deal. I thought you were on board with this Asian expansion.",
        "Sierra: Well, that's before I began to have certain concerns.",
        "Craig: About what?",
        "Sierra: You and Jennifer. You know, that whole episode at the Lakeview really left me with the impression that there were some things that weren't said.",
        "Craig: I can't imagine.",
        "Sierra: Sure you can. So maybe you want to tell me something honest about why Jennifer is having such a difficult time working with you.",
        "Craig: Jennifer -- has a creative temperament. But we're working through that. As soon as we get back from Singapore --",
        "Sierra: Actually, I was thinking that maybe you should take a break from Street Jeans. There are countless other projects at Worldwide that could use your expertise.",
        "Craig: I have a huge deal in the works here. I can't walk away now.",
        "Sierra: Well, I really hope that you reconsider.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Sierra: Because somebody needs to look out for the best interests of this company.",
        "Craig: I am!",
        "Sierra: You know, actually, I think that you are too personally attached to this project, and you are losing perspective, and you are unwilling or unable to do what is necessary for the good of this company. So I have to make the hard decisions.",
        "[Craig cackles]",
        "Craig: Give me a break.",
        "Sierra: I beg your pardon?",
        "Craig: This has nothing to do with Street Jeans or Worldwide. This is about you.",
        "Sierra: What about me?",
        "Craig: You're jealous.",
        "Sierra: Jealous?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sierra: Of what? You and Jennifer? Give me a break.",
        "Craig: You're jealous of our success -- of my success, more to the point.",
        "Sierra: You know, the world doesn't solely revolve around you.",
        "Craig: Oh, no, I know. I know. No, I believe the world turns for all of us. You were very content when you had me friar tucked away in that monastery, but now that I'm taking the world by storm in the job you begged me to take, you're suddenly threatened, and that's why you called me he -- not to commend me, but to shoot me down.",
        "Sierra: You know, I am only trying to get to the bottom of this for the good of the company. And instead of you talking to me rationally, like an adult, you do all this mud-slinging. You know, it's really kind of insulting.",
        "Craig: I know. I am insulted.",
        "Sierra: Well, if that's the way you feel, maybe you should just forget about taking on another project. And if you find it so unbearable to abide by my decisions and treat me in a respectful manner, then you know what? I welcome you -- no, no, no, I urge you -- to leave worldwide immediately.",

        "Dusty: I don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm fine. And I appreciate it, but I really have to get going.",
        "Dusty: Back to the grind, huh?",
        "Jennifer: Home to see Mike.",
        "Dusty: He's a good guy if he makes you happy.",
        "Jennifer: Deliriously.",
        "Dusty: Excellent. What'll you tell him about Craig?",
        "Jennifer: There's nothing to know.",
        "Dusty: The wonderful thing about a relationship is you can make your partner believe just about anything, but you can't lie to yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Do you think that all you have to do is just refuse to talk to me, refuse to look at me? That I'm gonna give up? I'm not gonna give up. No matter how angry you get, no matter how many times you tell me to go away, I'm not gonna do it. Because when I look at you, I see a lot more than this one horrible moment. I see all those years together, when you made me so proud. And it's not just you riding better than kids twice your age or when you were voted captain of the hockey team. I think of the quieter times. I remember a time when I saw you out pushing your sister on a swing. You didn't want to do it. You wanted to go. You wanted to do your own thing. But you stayed there and you pushed her because she was having so much fun, and you knew it. That's why you didn't stop.",
        "Luke: This is stupid. You're wasting your time.",
        "Holden: This is a serious crime -- so serious that you will go to prison. If they find you guilty --",
        "Luke: I am guilty.",
        "Holden: Then you will go to prison -- not juvenile hall -- and you will stay there for a very long time. Now look, if you did this, and you're confessing because you want to make things right, then I will help you. I will do anything I can to help you. But if you're confessing because you're afraid that your mom is guilty and you're afraid of what might happen to her, you have got to stop this. You are not helping anyone. I don't want you here. Your mother doesn't want you here. It's killing her that you even have to spend one night here.",
        "Luke: What do you care about how my mom feels?",
        "Holden: I care about your mother. And if she's found guilty, then I will everything I can to help her and protect her. But you've got to tell me the truth. I need to know. I swear to you, I will do everything that I can to make things right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm going to tell you something, and I don't want you to ever forget it. Your mother loved you more than anything in this world. And all she wanted was for you to be happy. She still does, and so do I. So I want you to make me a promise.",
        "J.J.: Anything.",
        "Jack: If you're not happy living with your Uncle Keith, you call me, day or night, and you let me know, and I'll take care of everything, okay?",
        "J.J.: Like before?",
        "Jack: Like always. 'Cause if you're not happy, I'm not happy. And you know why? 'Cause you're my son. That'll never change. Come here. [Knock on door] Hey. Come on in. We were just getting J.J. Ready to go.",
        "Keith: Hi, J.J. You ready to hit the highway?",
        "Jack: You said you weren't gonna go to Chicago for some time, so where are you gonna be staying?",
        "Keith: We'll be over at the Lakeview for a little while. Clear up some of the legal stuff.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm glad you're gonna be close by. Hey, listen, remember what I said. If you need anything, you call me, okay? Bye, buddy.",
        "Carly: Wait, wait. There's something that I would like to say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: My only concern is the good for this company. So why don't you deal with your ego in your personal time.",
        "Craig: All right, all right. Maybe I am taking things a little personally, but this company is going gangbusters, and I don't know how else to assure you there is nothing to worry about. I have given the little princess everything she needs, everything she has asked for, and sure, there are kinks, but Jennifer and I are a successful team. And if you don't believe me, ask her.",
        "Sierra: You know, I might just do that.",
        "Craig: All right, and she will back me up. Because you know why? Because we both want the same thing, and that is success for Street Jeans and Worldwide, and nothing is going to change that.",

        "Mike: I thought I heard your car pull up. Welcome home. I got something for you. I was gonna wait and show it to you in 3d when it was all finished and everything and you got back from Singapore, but I just can't wait to see the look on your face. Take it. It's for you.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, I have something I have to tell you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So you're saying if I tell the truth, you'll make everything right.",
        "Holden: I'll do my best.",
        "Luke: Your best. Then here's the truth. Once and for all. I killed Julia. And if you'd have given a damn about Mom, neither one of us would've been here right now. That's the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh, this has to work. For Luke's sake.",
        "Faith: Mommy? Doesn't Luke love us anymore?",
        "Lily: Oh, come here. Of course he does. Yes.",
        "Faith: Then why'd he go away?",
        "Lily: It's complicated. You miss him? I know. I miss him, too. But I'm doing everything I can to bring him home. Okay?",
        "Faith: I don't like when people go away.",
        "Lily: Me either. I know.",
        "Faith: You won't go away, too, will you, Mommy?",
        "Lily: You know, sometimes -- sometimes people have to go away to make things better. It doesn't mean they don't love us anymore. And when there's love, that's all that matters. And you know that no matter where Mommy goes, that I love you. Don't you? Okay. Good. Never forget that, okay? No matter what.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Hey, J.J., why don't you run out to the car? I'll be right there, okay? I'll get the bags and everything. All right. What is it?",

        "Carly: Jack, its okay. I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.",
        "Keith: Sorry? What exactly are you sorry for?",
        "Carly: For not coming forward with the truth when you were being held as a suspect.",
        "Keith: And why did you do that?",
        "Carly: Lily and I were afraid that no one would believe the truth. And I know that it's no excuse, but when Lily told me that Julia was alive when she left her apartment, and that you were there, banging on the door, well, I couldn't be sure that it wasn't you. And I know that an apology isn't gonna change anything. It's not gonna change the past or the damage done. But maybe --",
        "Jack: Maybe once you get settled in Chicago, you could drop us a line from time to time, let us know how J.J.'s doing.",
        "Keith: I thought I made it clear to you that I wasn't going anywhere until justice was served for my sister.",
