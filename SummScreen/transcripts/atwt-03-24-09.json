    "Transcript": [
        "Luke: So, we've done an informal poll of the gay community, nothing scientific, but it became pretty clear that Noah and I aren't the only gays that tried to rent an apartment that suddenly became unavailable.",
        "Lily: How does he know that you're not just two straight guys that are looking to be roommates?",
        "Luke: Well, all we had to say was that one bedroom was fine for us.",
        "Noah: Yeah. That's all he needed to hear. It's like these guys have some kind of system for spotting us.",
        "Lily: It's disgraceful.",
        "Noah: It works both ways. When somebody accuses them of discrimination, they deny it and say, \"Well, how can we tell?\"",
        "Lily: So, what are you guys thinking?",
        "Luke: Well, I think this is an issue where the foundation really could help. We could fund a survey of the gay community. We could back a campaign to strengthen anti-discrimination laws.",
        "Noah: We could bring a class-action lawsuit against any landlords with any kind of history of discrimination.",
        "Luke: Especially if we can prove that they're colluding.",
        "Lily: So, how do you go about that?",
        "Luke: Offer a reward.",
        "Lily: What about going public?",
        "Noah: Well, we can't prove anything yet.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but you could go on the air and tell your story, maybe convince some of your friends who have had similar experiences.",
        "Luke: As a way of showing a pattern without bringing up direct charges.",
        "Lily: Exactly.",
        "Noah: But who'd give us the chance to do that?",
        "Lily: Someone who believes discrimination is wrong who happens to own a TV station, like, for instance, me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay, turkey club with fries and a coffee. I'll be right back with your coffee.",
        "Jack: You left early this morning.",
        "Janet: I had to work the breakfast shift.",
        "Jack: You could have woken me.",
        "Janet: What for?",
        "Jack: I checked with the desk. The kids weren't picked up off the street last night.",
        "Janet: Thank God.",
        "Jack: Which means they probably found someplace to stay.",
        "Janet: What a relief. Now I can stop crying my eyes out.",
        "Jack: Hey. Janet, I don't like this any more than you do.",
        "Janet: You could have fooled me.",
        "Jack: Do you think I wanted my son to run off and marry your daughter?",
        "Janet: I don't know what you want, Jack.",
        "Jack: What I want is to make sure they don't come out of this with the wrong ideas.",
        "Janet: Like what, their parents actually care about what happens to them?",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Janet. You know I care.",
        "Janet: I think you care about being right.",
        "Jack: That isn't fair.",
        "Janet: Life isn't fair, Jack. Isn't that the lesson that you were so hot to teach our children?",
        "Jack: I don't know what you want me to say.",
        "Janet: I don't care what you say. It's what you do that matters, and I don't want to have any part of it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: That's barely enough for two lattes.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. If we both get a regular coffee, we could probably split a donut.",
        "Parker: Well, don't you want your double-chocolate, peppermint?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but it's not really in our price range anymore.",
        "Parker: I guess not.",
        "Liberty: You know, we really should not have spent so much money on the minibar last night.",
        "Parker: I was starving!",
        "Liberty: I know, but -- you know, when I first came to town and I stayed with Dad and Katie at the hotel, I thought a minibar was, like, the ultimate luxury.",
        "Parker: Well, once I get control of my trust fund, we can order room service three times a day.",
        "Liberty: Do you have any idea when this little miracle's gonna happen?",
        "Parker: Hopefully we're about to find out. Mr. Shink. You remember Liberty, my wife.",
        "Liberty: Hey. Hi.",
        "Parker: And now that we're married, we can go ahead with the whole emancipation thing and I can get my money, right?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, 'cause we really, really, really need money right now.",
        "Mr. Shink: Well, your marriage helps your case for emancipation, but it doesn't guarantee immediate access to the trust fund.",
        "Parker: Well, how long is that gonna take?",
        "Mr. Shink: Maybe six months, if things go smoothly.",
        "Parker: That long.",
        "Liberty: And if they don't go smoothly, then it'll take, what, longer? Like, years?",
        "Parker: Years?",
        "Mr. Shink: Years.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm looking for my son, Parker Snyder. I know he stayed here last night. He's not in his room.",
        "Desk Clerk: Oh, I believe Mr. and Mrs. Snyder left some time ago.",
        "Carly: They're not Mr. and Mrs. Anything.",
        "Desk Clerk: I was under the impression they're newlyweds.",
        "Carly: They're not. They're not newlyweds. Technically, I guess, but not really.",
        "Desk Clerk: Mr. Montgomery is hosting them in the honeymoon suite.",
        "Carly: They're not on their honeymoon! It's not real, you see. It's going to be annulled. They're children! Can you not see that?",
        "Craig: Excuse me. Everything okay?",
        "Carly: I can't find the kids.",
        "Craig: Have you seen them?",
        "Desk Clerk: I told the lady, they went out.",
        "Craig: Thank you very much. I'm sure they haven't gotten far.",
        "Carly: How do you know that, Craig?",
        "Craig: All they have is pocket change.",
        "Carly: I have to find them.",
        "Craig: No, Carly. You don't. I'm just trying to help you.",
        "Carly: I don't want your help, okay?",
        "Craig: All right, fine. I'm sorry I bothered you while you were making such a public scene.",
        "Carly: Well, that's not your concern, is it?",
        "Craig: You're right. My mistake. And the next time I see you making a public spectacle of yourself, I'll be sure not to intervene.",
        "Carly: I just want to find the kids, okay?",
        "Craig: And I can help you do that.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Craig: Well, we already know they didn't check out, and they don't have any money. What about credit cards?",
        "Carly: Jack took Parker's away.",
        "Craig: Of course he did.",
        "Carly: Well, we've all made mistakes. We're doing the best we can.",
        "Craig: Okay. Fair enough. I assume you've called Parker's cell.",
        "Carly: No answer.",
        "Craig: What about your daughter-in-law?",
        "Carly: Are you trying to make things worse, 'cause that's what you're doing?",
        "Craig: The first thing you need to do, Carly, is face reality. Liberty and Parker are married. On the other hand, they have no place to live, no money, no jobs, and no parents to look after them. All they have is a free honeymoon suite. So I would wager that they'll be back here sooner rather than later.",
        "Carly: If Jack finds out that you're paying for that hotel room, he's going to go nuts!",
        "Craig: How will we know?",
        "Carly: That's not funny.",
        "Craig: All right. Let's not talk about Jack. We need to figure out where two broke newlywed kids would go to hang out and not be bothered.",
        "Carly: Well, I can think of a couple places.",
        "Craig: So can I. You have your cell?",
        "Carly: I do.",
        "Craig: Okay. Then why don't we split up and start a search?",
        "Carly: Okay. Hey.",
        "Craig: Hmm?",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Believe me, it's purely selfish. Once we've cleaned up this mess, I can have my business partner back, and it's about time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Okay, thanks. You know, I just can't believe that this kind of discrimination exists in 2009.",
        "Lily: Well, wiping out hatred takes time.",
        "Luke: We're trying to speed that up a little bit, though.",
        "Lily: So, do you think this is the type of story that you would put on the air?",
        "Kim: Oh, it's definitely newsworthy, but, you know, the really interesting idea is the two of you working on this together.",
        "Luke: Oh, you mean the whole mother/son gay rights activist?",
        "Kim: Well, the thing is, the journey your family's taken, how you came out, how it affected everybody, why the two of you are working together, and has that changed your relationship? These are the things our audience is gonna be really interested in, and it's fabulous because it's educational, and we're talking about the larger issues.",
        "Luke: Well, what do you think, Mom?",
        "Lily: I think it's good to show that discrimination doesn't just affect the victim. It affects the people close to them.",
        "Kim: Yeah, exactly. So, is there any chance I could talk the two of you in to doing an interview with me?",
        "Lily: I'm on board. What about you?",
        "Luke: There is nobody I would rather have by my side.",
        "Kim: Wonderful!",
        "Lily: So, when do you want to do this?",
        "Kim: Well, you know, the mayor got sick today and bailed on my public-affairs show, and I was gonna put on a rerun, but this would be so much better.",
        "Luke: Today? You mean, like, live today? Right now?",
        "Kim: Actually, in about 10 minutes, if you're up for it.",
        "Lily: I am. If you need more time to prepare --",
        "Luke: No, no. No. I'm good. We're in.",
        "Kim: Good. Let's get some makeup on and begin.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: What do we do for money in the meantime?",
        "Mr. Shink: Well, you might want to try to find jobs.",
        "Liberty: Jobs, jobs. Wow. Like flipping-burgers jobs.",
        "Parker: We can do better than that.",
        "Liberty: With all of our experience?",
        "Parker: Look, it's just until the case is resolved.",
        "Liberty: You heard what he said! Parker, that could take years.",
        "Parker: But it won't!",
        "Liberty: Oh, my God. Now you know more than your lawyer?",
        "Parker: We just have to hold out in the meantime.",
        "Liberty: Okay. What about school?",
        "Parker: Who cares about school? We'll have plenty of money coming in. You'll see.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Maybe one day, but this is now.",
        "Parker: Don't panic, okay? We're smart.",
        "Liberty: We haven't even finished high school!",
        "Parker: So what? I hate school!",
        "Liberty: I don't!",
        "Parker: You didn't when you first got here. You were trying to ditch every chance we got!",
        "Liberty: Yeah, until you showed me that there was an upside to taking it seriously.",
        "Parker: How'd I do that?",
        "Liberty: By being smart. By thinking, I don't know, maybe about the future?",
        "Parker: Well, that was until you showed me that the future is bull.",
        "Liberty: Oh, God. Okay. Okay. Maybe if we get a cheap enough place to live, we can get part-time jobs, and we can still stay in school.",
        "Parker: What is it with you and school?",
        "Liberty: I don't want to be a high-school dropout.",
        "Parker: Okay. Well, we'll figure it out together, okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay. We should probably start by trying to find a job.",
        "Parker: All right. What about here? They're always hiring new people.",
        "Liberty: Waiters. Yeah. My mom will be real proud. What? I can't make jokes around you anymore?",
        "Parker: Sure, you can.",
        "Liberty: Good. Let's go find the manager.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. Have you heard from the kids?",
        "Janet: Not today.",
        "Carly: I've been looking everywhere for them.",
        "Janet: Parker hasn't called you?",
        "Carly: Liberty?",
        "Janet: I'm afraid to try.",
        "Carly: I want you to know that I don't blame her for any of this. I don't hold anything against her.",
        "Janet: And I don't have anything against Parker either.",
        "Carly: But you do blame him.",
        "Janet: Even if I knew for a fact that this was his idea, which I don't, Liberty didn't say no.",
        "Carly: He says they're in love.",
        "Janet: So does Liberty. I would think that by now she would know where to draw the line. I would think she would learn by my example, but no. What do I have to do, hit her over the head?",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Jack's trying that. It's not working.",
        "Janet: How do we keep them from making such huge mistakes?",
        "Carly: Nobody can keep me from doing it.",
        "Janet: Me neither. One look at Bradley, and my brain was mush.",
        "Carly: Same. I mean, different circumstances, same mush.",
        "Janet: Maybe Jack's right.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Jack is not right. Jack is pushing them away. Does he know about the hotel room?",
        "Janet: No, and I don't think it's a good idea for him to know.",
        "Carly: Does he even care where they spent the night last night?",
        "Janet: Yes, he cares. First thing this morning, he called the police station to find out if they had been picked up. I just think he doesn't want to admit that he's wrong.",
        "Carly: Not what he's best at.",
        "Janet: I've never seen him like this, Carly.",
        "Carly: Do you suppose I could have warned you?",
        "Janet: I wouldn't have listened.",
        "Carly: I'll call you when I find them.",
        "Janet: Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Came to see my sister.",
        "Jack: Margo's in court.",
        "Craig: Oh. Well, tell her I stopped by.",
        "Jack: Why don't you leave a message on her cell?",
        "Craig: Why didn't I think of that? Good idea. Have you heard from Parker?",
        "Jack: In what world is it okay for you to ask me that?",
        "Craig: No one's seen them since they left the hotel.",
        "Jack: What hotel?",
        "Craig: The Lakeview. I got them a room there last night.",
        "Jack: They spent the night at the Lakeview last night?",
        "Craig: Well, I didn't think anyone would want them on the street.",
        "Jack: How is that any of your business?",
        "Craig: Well, they're kids.",
        "Jack: Not your kids, Craig! You want Carly to think you're a hero, go for it, but do not interfere with my family!",
        "Craig: I'm not interfering.",
        "Jack: Why didn't you tell anyone they were there?",
        "Craig: I did.",
        "Jack: Who?",
        "Craig: Well, Carly knew. So did Janet. They both seemed pretty happy that the kids had a roof over their head.",
        "Jack: They both knew?",
        "Craig: They really didn't tell you? Ooh. My bad.",
        "Jack: There's no way Carly and Janet knew you were putting those kids in a hotel room.",
        "Craig: They knew.",
        "Jack: Maybe Carly knew.",
        "Craig: They both knew. They're mothers, Jack. They don't understand the educational value of sleeping on the street. Look, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but I didn't realize your wife was keeping from you, or should I say wives?",
        "Jack: Go to hell.",
        "Craig: Now, don't shoot the messenger, Jack.",
        "Jack: One more word that isn't \"Goodbye,\" and I swear to God, I'll find something to arrest you for.",
        "Craig: Well, I guess this is goodbye.",
        "Jack: I'm taking some personal time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: The Luke Snyder foundation plans to launch a broad campaigns against landlords who discriminate against potential tenants illegally -- not just gay, lesbian, or transgendered people, but anyone.",
        "Lily: We intend to conduct research, raise public awareness, lobby for stronger anti-discrimination laws, and build a class-action suit against the property owners.",
        "Kim: Oh, that's a pretty expensive agenda.",
        "Luke: Well, luckily, we do have the resources.",
        "Kim: Okay, good. Let's talk about that a little bit. It's my understanding that this endowment came mostly from Luke's father?",
        "Luke: Well, Damian Grimaldi, yes, is technically my biological father, but my dad, the man that raised me, is Holden Snyder.",
        "Kim: And yet Mr. Grimaldi gave you a fortune.",
        "Luke: Yes.",
        "Lily: Which Luke decided to use to start a charitable foundation. He was able to take a painful family legacy and turn it into something positive. He could have just spent the money. I'm very proud of my son for being so responsible.",
        "Kim: I'm sure you are, and I'll bet that's why you decided to work with Luke as executive director of the foundation?",
        "Lily: One of the reasons, yes.",
        "Kim: And what were some of the others?",
        "Lily: I'm not entirely proud of the way I reacted when Luke came out. Like many families, we let our ignorance and prejudices affect our response when our son was simply telling us who he is.",
        "Kim: And you want to make it up to him.",
        "Lily: Well, not only that. As we've shared Luke's experiences these last few years, I've come to realize two things. First, many families have experienced what we have, and the more information they have, the less painful for everyone.",
        "Luke: Actually, I'd like to defend my parents a little bit here. When I came out, it wasn't as bad as lots of kids have it. You know, lots of families cut their kids out completely.",
        "Lily: Which doesn't make me feel any better about what I did.",
        "Kim: But you said there were two reasons.",
        "Lily: Well, Luke is still my son, but even if he weren't, the idea that someone can be discriminated against simply because of who they were born to be is unacceptable to me. This country was built on the belief that we're all created equal, and that people are still denied equal rights is an ongoing shame.",
        "Kim: You know, Lily, how wonderful this is. You have turned that all around, and here you are working with your son as an activist.",
        "Lily: Yeah, well, Luke and I have come full circle. I've taught my son to fight for his rights, and I am proud to do it with him.",
        "Kim: And good for you both, and thank you, Lily and Luke Snyder. And thank you. I'm sure we're all just inspired by these two wonderful people. See you tomorrow. Okay! We're out! That was wonderful. You did a great job.",
        "Luke: Mom, you were -- you were absolutely -- absolutely terrific.",
        "Noah: You guys -- you guys were amazing!",
        "Lily: You inspire me, Luke.",
        "Luke: Well, I hope it works to get the word out.",
        "Noah: It worked. Every phone line in the entire station is backed up!",
        "Lily: Is that true?",
        "Noah: Yeah! Go see for yourself!",
        "Luke: Well, I wonder, is that a good thing or a bad thing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: Look, I'd love to be able to help you, but right now I just don't have anything. I'm turning away experienced college kids.",

        "Manager: I'm sorry.",

        "Parker: Well, just enjoying our freedom.",
        "Craig: Adulthood is wonderful, isn't it?",
        "Parker: It's great.",
        "Craig: You know, your mom is trying to reach you.",
        "Parker: Yeah. She left a couple voice mails.",

        "Parker: Yeah. We're fine.",
        "Carly: Could I talk to you?",
        "Parker: Go ahead.",
        "Carly: Could I talk to you privately?",
        "Parker: I have nothing to hide from my wife.",
        "Carly: Parker, please.",
        "Liberty: We're actually looking for jobs so that we can pay rent and stuff like that.",
        "Carly: What happened to getting your trust-fund money?",
        "Parker: I will.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. It's just gonna take a while. What?",
        "Carly: What about school, Parker?",

        "Carly: I'm your mother.",
        "Parker: You kicked me out.",
        "Carly: I certainly did not.",
