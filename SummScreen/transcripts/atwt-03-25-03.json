        "Katie: Remember that little dog that mom used to have? He would roll around \r\non the carpet every time he got back from a walk. I am so excited to be home, I \r\nguess I probably might do that. ",
        "Margo: Then you might want to open the door. Or you can put this all off. \r\nKatie, you don't have to. You can come and stay with Tom and me, instead, okay?\r\n",
        "Katie: No, the doctor said I'm as strong as an ox. I need to be here. ",
        "Katie: This is the first place I actually made into a home. I mean, I didn't \r\ndo it alone, of course. Oh, hey there, you! How's my favorite little snuggle \r\nbunny? ",
        "Margo: You know what? You could bring Snickers to stay with us, too. Casey \r\nwould love that. ",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. Bunny and I are staying right here, where we belong. \r\nAh, snick, look at all this mail! Wanna bet how many of these are bills? ",
        "Margo: Honey, you don't have to do this. Katie, not now. ",
        "Katie: Do you know that it takes six days to get a letter from Australia, \r\njust regular air mail? And even if you want to send something overnight, it \r\ntakes two days, 'cause of the international dateline or -- I can't remember if \r\nthat's the way there or the way back. ",
        "Margo: Look, you know what? Simon is not in Australia, Katie. ",
        "Katie: Who's talking about Simon, thinking about Simon? I'm just talking to \r\nSnickers here. He gets really freaked out when it's too quiet. ",
        "[Whistling] ",
        "Margo: What is that? ",
        "Katie: What is that? ",
        "Margo: Oh, oh, oh. ",
        "Katie: Sorry. Simon. ",
        "[Whistling] ",
        "Henry: Well -- welcome home, bubbles. ",

        "Mitzi: Wow! ",
        "Rose: \"Wow\" -- oh. So tell me the truth. Would you loan me a pile of money?\r\n",
        "Mitzi: Ah. You're gorgeous. I mean, you look like that girl in Legally \r\nblonde. Except, with the blonde. ",
        "Rose: Right. So -- no. I look good, right, right? But would you give me your \r\ncheckbook? Would you trust me with it? ",
        "Mitzi: I would give you money and a Mercedes. ",
        "Rose: If you had either. ",
        "Mitzi: Right. ",
        "Rose: Thank you. [Laughing] You know what's so weird, though? It's so crazy. It's that I'm \r\nactually -- I feel kind of confident, you know? I mean, if I can make peace with \r\nthat psycho mother of Paul's -- business loan? Piece of cake. ",
        "Mitzi: You got a point. ",
        "Rose: And I have my lucky charm. ",
        "Mitzi: Ah. I get so happy when I see that rock back on your knuckle again.\r\n",
        "Rose: Let me tell you something -- I am not taking this bad boy off until \r\nPaul and I are on a cruise to Bermuda for swinging seniors. ",
        "Mitzi: Ah. ",
        "Paul: Can I marry you first, then plan retirement? ",
        "Rose: Yes, lover boy. Lover boy. May is only a couple of weeks away. ",
        "Paul: Well, what would you say about Vegas tonight? ",
        "Rose: Oh, I would love to go to Vegas tonight. But -- you're kidding. ",
        "Paul: Yes. You are so cute when you're gullible. No Vegas. I need more time \r\nto plan, and Dusty should be by here any minute to discuss honeymoon spots. ",
        "Rose: Um -- I think it's great that he's your friend, but he ain't coming on \r\nour honeymoon. ",
        "Paul: Of course not. But Joe billionaire does want to give it to us as a \r\nwedding present. ",
        "",
        "Dusty: What's the problem? Don't sweat it. I told you I'm good for the \r\nmoney. You get the next installment next week. Yeah, I'm aware of the \r\narrangement. Moron. ",
        "Yeah, and what if Rose really does love Paul? What if they do make ",
        "it to the altar? What, are you gonna stiff me? ",
        "Are you gonna tell me you're only gonna pay my hotel bill? ",
        "'Cause that ain't gonna cut it, lady. ",
        "Barbara: Okay. Okay, I'll tell you what. If Rose resists, I'll pay ",
        "you everything I promised. But if she gives in, I'll pay you double. ",
        "",
        "Kim: Ah, I can't believe this, honestly. Jessica's very brave in going public \r\nwith this ordeal, but she certainly doesn't need to face this when she comes to \r\njoin us. ",
        "Lisa: Mm. Well, I certainly would like to greet her with a picture on the \r\nfront page of Travers being kicked out of my hotel on his royal behind. ",
        "[Kim laughs] ",
        "Kim: Well, I believe she's gonna be here before the evening edition comes.\r\n",
        "Lisa: Oh, my gosh. ",
        "Kim: What? ",
        "Lisa: Call Jess quick. ",
        "Marshall: Single malt scotch, please. Neat. ",
        "Bartender: 12 or 18-year? ",
        "Marshall: You know, make it 25. Thanks. ",
        "Kim: Jess, honey, it's Kim. The lounge is awfully crowded. So why don't you \r\ncome and meet us up in Lisa's suite? See you soon, honey. Bye. ",
        "Lisa: Ah, voice mail, right? ",
        "Kim: Yeah. ",
        "Lisa: Okay. ",
        "Marshall: Please, ladies, don't leave on my account. ",
        "Lisa: Don't stay on our account. ",
        "Marshall: My apologies. I didn't mean to offend you. ",
        "Kim: Too late. ",
        "Bonnie: It's like the White House Press room out there. ",
        "Isaac: It's that bad? ",
        "Bonnie: Well, not as bad as my mother's house. Thanks for the tip on me \r\nusing the back entrance. ",
        "Isaac: You know I'm always looking out for you. ",
        "Bonnie: I appreciate that. I just wish you would extend that generous spirit \r\nto the rest of my family. ",
        "Isaac: You know I've always looked out for you and your mother in the past.\r\n",
        "Bonnie: And now that she's been hurt, you've decided to side with her \r\nattacker. ",
        "Isaac: Well, I won't lie to you, Bonnie. I love you too much to hurt you \r\nlike that. ",
        "Bonnie: And what about my mother? ",
        "Isaac: Ben is my brother. I've got to protect him. And Marshall's letter \r\nmakes me wonder. ",
        "Bonnie: Ugh! Should have tossed that letter when my mother told me to. I \r\nshould have never even opened it! Well, it doesn't matter now. At least it is at \r\nthe bottom of the dump, where it belongs. Isaac? Isaac, please tell me that \r\nletter is buried under about 20 pounds of lemon peel somewhere. ",
        "Isaac: I couldn't throw it away, not until I showed -- ",
        "Bonnie: I tore it up for a reason, Isaac! Please tell me you didn't show \r\nthat thing to Ben. ",
        "Isaac: He read it last night. And then he burned it. ",
        "Bonnie: So let me get this straight. What you're telling me is that you \r\nsnuck behind my back and showed Ben a manipulative piece of fiction that accuses \r\nmy mother of crying rape in order to cover up something she feels guilty about. \r\nIs that right? ",
        "Isaac: I was gonna tell you. ",
        "Bonnie: Yes, of course you were! Right after you filled my head with some \r\nbull about how much you love me too much to hurt me. ",

        "Ben: Jessica? It's Ben. ",
        "Jessica: Hey. ",
        "Ben: Hey. ",
        "Jessica: Did the photographer in the bushes get you? ",
        "Ben: Yeah, I don't think so. You are under siege in here. You all right? ",
        "Jessica: Yeah, as long as I don't turn on the television or read the \r\nnewspaper or answer the phone. ",
        "Ben: You get any sleep last night? ",
        "Jessica: A little. And now I am off to visit Kim and Lisa at the Lakeview.\r\n",
        "Ben: Before you go, we need to go over a few things. ",
        "Jessica: Like what? ",
        "Ben: Well -- your gun, for starters. Bonnie asked me to get it out of here.\r\n",
        "Jessica: I'm glad she called you. It's over here. ",
        "Ben: Hey. I'll put it someplace safe. You gonna be all right? ",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I'll be fine, as long as that thing is out of here. Thank \r\nyou. ",
        "Ben: Hey, no problem. ",
        "Jessica: No, not just for the gun but for everything. I mean, I don't even \r\nknow how I'd be able to do this without you. ",
        "Ben: Look, Jess, I am behind you 100%. But -- I'm a little worried about \r\nthis trial. ",
        "Jessica: Well, you know, we know what Marshall does. He makes everything as \r\nugly and dirty as possible. But Evelyn will be prepared, and so will I. ",
        "Ben: Are you prepared for me? I have this thought that the most damning \r\ntestimony against you -- it could be mine. ",
        "Jessica: Well, look, no matter how Marshall spins this case, the fact it, he \r\nraped me. And I only need two things to stay strong. I need to remember that I \r\nam telling the truth. And I need to know that you believe that I am telling the \r\ntruth, no matter what. ",
        "Ben: Look, my faith in you is a given, Jessica. That's why I don't want to \r\nend up being Travers' ace in the hole against you. ",
        "Jessica: There is no way that could happen. ",
        "Ben: Look, what if I'm forced to testify that you and Travers were lovers? \r\nIf under oath, I have to say that that videotape of you two in bed is for real?\r\n",
        "Jessica: I have already conceded that Marshall and I had a relationship. ",
        "Ben: Yeah, but what if I have to say you lied about it? How is that gonna \r\nhelp your testimony stand up beyond a reasonable doubt? ",
        "Jessica: Because this case is not about something that happened months ago. \r\nThis case is about something that happened very recently. A very specific \r\nviolent act that Marshall committed against me. ",
        "[Cell phone ringing] ",
        "Ben: I have to take this. ",
        "Jessica: Yeah. ",
        "Ben: Look, yeah, Bob. Yeah, I'm on my way. Hey -- all right, well, thanks \r\nfor the heads up, man. Park around back. ",
        "Jessica: Are the vultures at the hospital, too? ",
        "Ben: They've been hounding the candy stripers for information about your \r\ndoctor companion. ",
        "Jessica: I am so sorry. ",
        "Ben: It's not a surprise. I've got about 80 messages on my answering machine \r\nfrom reporters. And they've all got their own little angle, everything from me \r\nas the wounded party in the love triangle to me as Travers' surgeon. And it goes \r\non and on. The trial hasn't even started, and the Press is already all over us. \r\nI will be subpoenaed. I will be forced to testify under oath. And -- and when \r\nthey ask me, \"did you want to be left alone with Travers that night?\" I'm gonna \r\nhave to say yes. Now, how are they gonna be able to convict him after that? ",
        "Jessica: That does not change the fact -- ",
        "Ben: Look, if you can't win this, why put your life through this kind of \r\nbrutal public scrutiny? ",
        "Jessica: Wait a minute, wait a minute. What do you mean, if I can't win \r\nthis? He broke the law! ",
        "Ben: Look, the law can't protect you if you don't have proof. And I just -- \r\nI'm not sure that you have enough proof to convict him. ",
        "Jessica: I have the truth. And I just need to know that you believe that I \r\nam telling the truth. Do you? ",
        "Ben: Yes, yes. I do. ",
        "Jessica: Well, then a jury will believe me, too. ",

        "Katie: Nothing's missing that I can tell. ",
        "Henry: This is some gratitude for me watching this house, huh? You know, \r\nyesterday, I even played with the furball for an hour. ",
        "Margo: Oh, you know, Henry, I'd pay good money to see that one. Here, come, \r\nsit, eat. Now. ",
        "Katie: No, I'm not hungry yet. ",
        "Margo: What, is your stomach upset? Because Bob said that that was one of \r\nthe indications of dehydration. ",
        "Katie: No, no. I'm just excited to be home. So stop fussing. You're gonna \r\nhurt my liver. ",
        "Margo: My half of your liver is fine. It's your half that I'm worried about.\r\n",
        "[Doorbell rings] Oh, hi, Chris. What are you doing here? ",
        "Chris: Good to see you, too, Margo. ",
        "Margo: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Please, come in. What's up? ",
        "Chris: Katie left her meds at the hospital. Dad wanted me to pelt her with \r\nvitamins till she takes care of herself. ",
        "Margo: Maybe you could just write, \"Katie must come and stay with Margo,\" on \r\nthe prescription. ",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Chris. I'm not going all the way to the hospital just to \r\nkeep you company. ",
        "Chris: Ah, but you will if you keep forgetting these. ",
        "Katie: I left those? ",
        "Margo: Well, obviously you're a little distracted. Scattered? Taking on too \r\nmuch too soon, huh? Henry? ",
        "Henry: Hmm, what? ",
        "Margo: Are there clean sheets on Katie's bed? ",
        "Henry: No, no, they ain't clean. But I can go ahead and clean 'em up -- ",
        "Margo: No, no, no. No, no. You're not gonna do that. You are gonna go take \r\nthis prescription of Katie's and get it filled, and I will change the sheets.\r\n",
        "Henry: Well, are you sure? 'Cause my hospital corners are just terrific. ",
        "Margo: I am so sure they are. Now go. ",
        "Henry: Okay. Chris? Always a pleasure. ",
        "Margo: Okay, so -- drugs down. Bed to go. ",
        "Katie: That was subtle. ",
        "Chris: She's worried about you. ",
        "Katie: Well, she shouldn't be. And I wish you would talk her out of it, \r\nbecause I'm fine. ",
        "Chris: Then you're a lot tougher than me. If the person I loved bolted and \r\ntook all our money, I'd be a mess. ",
        "Katie: You'd be fine. Things like that just happen. I mean, life's not \r\nperfect, you know? Sometimes you're just left all alone with a pile of bills and \r\nno answers and -- that's just the way it goes, right? ",

        "Rose: I don't care if Dusty Donovan is Bill Gates. A honeymoon as a gift for \r\nus? That's a little excessive, don't you think? We don't have to worry about \r\nthat right now. All I worry about is turning the yuppie puppy from a grooming \r\nsalon to a beauty salon. And I gotta put my rent down ASAP, 'cause God knows \r\nwhat kind of creep's gonna go in there and steal it out from underneath me. ",
        "Paul: Well, listen, if there's a holdup at the bank, I'll be glad to loan \r\nyou the money to secure the lease. ",
        "Rose: Oh. That's very sweet of you. It is. But -- ",
        "Paul: But you will not accept my money. I know. ",
        "Rose: Oh. Not gonna need it. Right? Because I've done this before. \r\nWorldwide, as the VP. I did big meetings. I took them, and I did great. ",
        "Paul: Should I come with you? I can plow you with mineral water. ",
        "Rose: Oh, you are just the best. You are. But this is something I gotta do \r\nsolo. Thank you. ",

        "Dusty: Yeah, I saw her get into Lucinda's limo. Big meeting today, huh? ",
        "Paul: Yeah, I hope it goes well. She needs to get that loan to get the salon \r\nstarted. ",
        "Dusty: You sound unsure. ",
        "Paul: Well, don't get me wrong. I have all the faith in the world in Rose, \r\nbut you know, with a start-up's life, she needs advice. ",
        "Dusty: And Rose doesn't take advice? ",
        "Paul: Not from me. ",
        "Dusty: Well, maybe she's got a point. ",

        "Dusty: Well, probably not from you. ",
        "Dusty: I'm not questioning your advice. But, you know, it's a boundary \r\nissue. You don't want to mix business with your relationship. ",
        "Paul: I'm not suggesting Rose and I become business partners, but I do want \r\nto help her. ",
        "Dusty: I mean you said she did a bang-up job as a VP working for -- ",
        "Paul: Worldwide. ",
        "Dusty: Right. So trust that Lucinda trained her well. ",
        "Paul: Lucinda trained her to manage an already profitable company. She has \r\nnever started a company from scratch. She's nervous. ",
        "Dusty: Well, what's the worst that can happen? She falls on her face. It \r\nhappens to all of us. ",
        "Paul: Really? ",
        "Dusty: Yeah. ",

        "Paul: She just wants this so badly, man. ",
        "Dusty: I know. Well, you know, she probably needs someone who's objective, \r\nsomeone who's done the dance. ",
        "Paul: And would you be talking about yourself? ",

        "Dusty: I mean, not that she'll need it, but she might, and let it be her \r\ndecision, you know? I've got to go to a meeting. Look, can we talk later about \r\nyour honeymoon? 'Cause I've got some good ideas for you. ",
