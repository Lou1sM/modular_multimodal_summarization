        "Noah: Oh, perfect timing. I'm off and ready to roll.",
        "Luke: About that --",
        "Noah: I made a list of all the things we need, like sheets, towels, pots and pans and dishes, you know? We should really think about having a housewarming party. That way we can --",
        "Luke: Yes, yes, yes, we should think about that because -- don't kill me -- I don't think we can go shopping today.",
        "Noah: Why? What happened?",
        "Luke: Well, I've been thinking all morning about how lucky I was that my mom could pull some strings and get that interview.",
        "Noah: Hey, don't sell yourself short. She may have set it up, but you were great.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I think there's more I can do. Come on and I'll show you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: \"Stop defending perverts and sinners or you'll live to regret it.\" Wow. You mind if I keep this?",
        "Lily: Be my guest.",
        "Margo: Yeah, just in case this doesn't turn out to be, you know, some harmless nut. I think that maybe you should think twice about making any more personal appearances on air or off.",
        "Lily: Well, I promised Luke that I would support him any way I can.",
        "Margo: And you should. You should. Just please do it in private, at least until we find out who this is.",
        "Lily: So I'm supposed to go into hiding because someone has a problem with my son being gay?",
        "Margo: I'm not saying it's fair. But it doesn't take much to push an extremist off the edge. Now, whoever this is, they took the time to write the note, find out where you live, and deliver it personally to your home. So that tells me that he or she is not operating on all cylinders.",
        "Lily: I get it. But I don't plan on letting it scare me. I promise to be careful.",
        "Holden: About what?",
        "Margo: Well, I got to go. I will let you know if we hear anything, okay?",
        "Lily: Thanks, Margo. Hi.",
        "Holden: Hi.",
        "Lily: Did you get a good price on those horses?",
        "Holden: Oh, no, you don't. Don't do that.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: Distract me. Why was Margo here? And what do you need to be careful about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, what do you think about his place for a gay-rights rally?",
        "Noah: Are you serious? [Chuckles] \"The Luke Snyder foundation is sponsoring a rally/fundraiser at metro to support gay and lesbian rights.\" You're doing this today?",
        "Luke: Well, you said that we should use the foundation to get the word out.",
        "Noah: But -- are you sure you want to do this now?",
        "Luke: Oh, especially now. I'm so riled up about how well the broadcast went yesterday.",
        "Noah: And that threatening note that your mom got doesn't bother you?",
        "Luke: No, it was one note. We can't just cave because one person didn't like what they watched on TV. This is important to me. And you too.",
        "Noah: I know, I know, but --",
        "Luke: This is what I've always wanted since I ran for student government -- until I messed that all up. So it feels really good to have a second chance to fight for people who can't fight for themselves. But I can't do it without you. I don't want to.",
        "Noah: What can I do to help?",
        "Luke: Well, you can help me convince my mom to give another really amazing speech.",
        "Noah: After yesterday, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: All right, all right, I'm here. What is so important that I had to rush right over?",
        "Brad: It's not like I can stop you now.",
        "Katie: We're having a baby.",
        "Margo: Ohh, Baby! Oh, I'm so happy for you!",
        "Katie: Thank you. Me too.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God! It's about time you got cracking on this! Congratulations.",
        "Brad: Oh, well, thank you, I think.",
        "Margo: Oh, so, well, when is it due? I mean, you're not even showing. Well, knowing you, you probably won't show for, like, till you're six months along --",
        "Katie: Well, Margo --",
        "Margo: And are you having any morning sickness? 'Cause I tell you, the best thing to do is soda crackers. That is what --",
        "Katie: No, no morning sickness.",
        "Margo: Really? 'Cause Mama told me that kind of ran in the family.",
        "Katie: No, I'm not having morning sickness -- because I'm not pregnant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Just make sure when you turn on the speakers that you turn on the mike, okay? Thanks.",
        "Vienna: I got it!",
        "Henry: You got what?",
        "Vienna: An appointment with Dr. Howell.",
        "Henry: Are you sick?",
        "Vienna: No, silly. He's my ob-gyn. I'm pregnant, remember?",
        "Henry: Yes, yeah. How could I forget that?",
        "Vienna: Someone canceled, and so I -- I have my first prenatal exam.",
        "Henry: That's great.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I'm so excited. I've been dying to see what this baby looks like ever since I found out I'm pregnant.",
        "Henry: I bet he looks like a tadpole, doesn't it?",
        "Vienna: Henry!",
        "Henry: Sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Vienna: Well, even if it looks like a tadpole, it's still a baby. And it's exciting to think about that we can watch it grow inside of me.",
        "Henry: Yes, that is exciting, and as much as I'd like to be a part of this momentous occasion, um, Luke Snyder is having a rally here, and I need to make sure that the sound system is working properly.",
        "Volunteer: No, you don't. I run the A.V. Department at O.U. I think I can work a sound system.",
        "Vienna: Well, it looks like they've got everything under control.",
        "Henry: Yes, they certainly do.",
        "Vienna: Well, shall we go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: How could you not think that this is a big deal?",
        "Lily: Because it was just a note.",
        "Holden: Ordering you to stop defending perverts is not just a note.",
        "Luke: Dad! You're home early.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Luke: Right in time for the rally.",
        "Holden: The rally?",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, I'm sure you've heard about our little on-air debut yesterday?",
        "Holden: Yes, I did. Your mom told me.",
        "Luke: Well, in light of all the positive response we've gotten, I've decided to organize a gay-rights rally at Metro today.",
        "Lily: I can't believe you got it together so quickly.",
        "Noah: Your son is pretty amazing when he's motivated.",
        "Lily: Yes, he is.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm expecting another great speech from you, Mom.",
        "Lily: I'd be honored.",
        "Holden: No, no. It's not a good idea.",
        "Luke: Oh, that was not the reaction I expected.",
        "Holden: You know I don't have a problem supporting gay rights.",
        "Luke: No, I know.",
        "Holden: I'm just very worried.",
        "Luke: You told him about the note?",
        "Holden: Margo thinks it's best to keep a low profile.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Luke: I can't do that. I've already posted flyers all around town. This morning I sent out an e-mail to people. We couldn't stop this rally even if we wanted to.",
        "Holden: Look, until we know what this note is all about and where it came from, I don't want the both of you targeting yourselves.",
        "Noah: Neither do I.",
        "Holden: Finally! Somebody who sees what I see.",
        "Noah: Oh, I do. I'm just as worried as you are.",
        "Luke: I thought you said you were behind me no matter what.",
        "Noah: I am. You know, if there's one thing I've learned about your son is that when he's put his heart into something, there's nothing anyone can do to stop him.",
        "Holden: Yeah, he's just like his mother.",
        "Luke: Well, I'll take every precaution necessary. I'll even put somebody at the door checking people's bags and coats when they come in.",
        "Lily: That sounds fair.",
        "Holden: Do you really think that's enough to keep you safe, Luke?",
        "Luke: Dad, let's not jump to the worst possible scenario. Look, I understand if you can't make it. I would hope that you'd understand why I have to go.",
        "Lily: Who are you calling?",
        "Holden: I'm calling Carly to see if she can shut down the club.",
        "Lily: You can't do that.",
        "Holden: Look, I'm trying to do everything I can to make sure our son doesn't get hurt.",
        "Lily: If you stop this rally, hurting our son is exactly what you'll do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I can't sustain a pregnancy, and we're not sure that my eggs are viable, so we we're gonna be using a surrogate.",
        "Margo: Okay, and so Brad then will be the biological father?",
        "Katie: Yes, that's right.",
        "Margo: Okay, well, it all sounds good. I'm sorry I leapt to conclusions there.",
        "Katie: Oh, it's okay. I just hope you don't think we're making a mistake.",
        "Margo: Honey, biology doesn't make a mommy. Love does. I can't think of anyone who's got more love to give a little baby than you.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Margo: And the best part is, you're not risking your life.",
        "Brad: That's what did it for me.",
        "Margo: So, you've done all your research, right?",
        "Brad: We have.",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Margo: You found a very good woman who's gonna take care of herself and the baby?",
        "Katie: Yes. Oh, we would not do this with anyone we didn't fully trust.",
        "Brad: Or someone we didn't know. I mean, once Vienna committed to cutting out the champagne cocktails and caviar.",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah. The mercury in the fish is so bad for the baby.",
        "Brad: Yeah, how could we go with anyone else?",
        "Margo: What, you're kidding, aren't you? You asked Vienna Hyatt to carry your baby?",
        "Katie: Yes, we did.",
        "Margo: Are you out of your minds?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I don't want to take unnecessary risks, either. But it's impossible not to be on board for this rally. Not just because it's a good cause, but because of what it's doing for our son. You saw him just then. He lit up, Holden.",
        "Holden: I know, and it's great to see him like that again.",
        "Lily: And after that election fiasco. I mean, he was so depressed. I thought we had lost him for good. But now he's back to being our old son.",
        "Holden: The last thing I want to do is send him back to that dark place. But I'm very worried. There's a lot of hate out there. Noah's father -- he wanted to kill Luke because he was gay.",
        "Lily: I know, I know. And that was horrifying. But this is different, Holden. That was personal. The person that wrote this note probably doesn't even know Luke.",
        "Holden: They know where you live. That's enough for me.",
        "Lily: So I'm just supposed to give up?",
        "Holden: I think we need to wait until the cops can figure the situation out. Can you at least just do that?",
        "Lily: No, I'm sorry. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: It's just that Vienna is like the last woman on this earth I can imagine wanting to carry another woman's child. I mean, she's a party girl. She's not a den mother.",
        "Brad: She said she wants to experience what it's like to be pregnant.",
        "Katie: Without having to actually raise the child.",
        "Brad: Henry doesn't want that, either.",
        "Katie: So it's a win-win situation all around.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God. You're serious about this.",
        "Katie: Yes, we're serious about this. Vienna has been an amazing friend.",
        "Brad: She and Henry both have.",
        "Katie: So, why would we turn something down -- it's a generous offer -- when they can give us something that I can't?",
        "Margo: Have you -- have you drawn up contracts that stipulate exactly what's expected of Vienna and Henry, or, for that matter, what's expected of the two of you?",
        "Katie: We thought about it, we talked about it, we decided it wasn't necessary.",
        "Margo: It is. It is, it is. If you want to stay friends, it is.",
        "Katie: What would we have to negotiate?",
        "Margo: Honey, everything -- whether you get to go to the doctor appointments with her, or --",
        "Katie: Well, yeah. I figured that wouldn't be an issue.",
        "Margo: Well, how do you know it isn't for Vienna?",
        "Katie: I haven't asked her, no, but --",
        "Margo: No? Well, I -- and what about when she goes into labor? Do you want her to get the drugs or to go natural or --",
        "Katie: Drugs.",
        "Brad: Natural.",
        "Margo: Okay, see, there. That's -- you know, tom is still at the station, and I think that he could draw up something that would work for everyone. Okay?",
        "Katie: We might as well give it a shot.",
        "Brad: I still say we don't need it. But, okay -- but if it's gonna make you feel better.",
        "Margo: Good, okay. Let's go. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Just think. Today we're going to see the miracle of life right inside my tummy.",
        "Henry: Maybe I should wait outside by the car. We could avoid all those pesky parking charges. I could play sexy limo driver.",
        "Vienna: No, then you'd miss everything. No, I want you right here.",
        "Henry: Right. Um, okay. But I need a cup of coffee. You want some?",
        "Vienna: No, you know I can't have caffeine.",
        "Henry: Rice pudding?",
        "Vienna: Are you trying to bring back my morning sickness?",
        "Henry: Um, how about jell-o? I hear they have a great variety here.",
        "Vienna: No. My appointment is right now, and if you go downstairs to the cafeteria, then -- are you trying to avoid seeing the sonogram with me?",
        "Henry: Well, since it is Brad and Katie's baby, it seems like they should be here instead.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I forgot to call the parents. I was so happy about the appointment.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Katie: Hi, it's Katie. I can't get to the phone right now, so leave a message, and I'll get back to you.",
        "[Beep]",
        "Vienna: Hi, hi, Katie. It's me. I'm at the hospital for my first prenatal checkup, and I'm sorry. I know this is so last-minute, but there was a cancellation, and you and Brad -- you should just be here.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Howell's ready for you.",
        "Vienna: They're ready. I have to go. Are you coming?",
        "Henry: Um -- [Sighs] You know, I know that Katie and Brad would want to be here, so I should go find them in case Katie's machine didn't pick up in time.",
        "Vienna: Henry.",
        "Henry: All right. All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I get why you don't want me to do this. But what you don't get is that I don't have a choice. After what I did to Luke, I owe it to him to support him any way I can.",
        "Holden: What you did?",
        "Lily: When Luke first told me he was gay, I let Damian browbeat me into almost sending him away to that deprogramming camp.",
        "Holden: Damian took advantage of your fear.",
        "Lily: I let him. I let my son down in the worst way a mother possibly could. I didn't accept him for who he is.",
        "Holden: Luke forgave you for that a long time ago.",
        "Lily: Well, I'm not sure that I've forgiven myself. When I did that interview yesterday, I felt like I finally started to. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was the mother that I used to be. And if you can be there with me, Holden, maybe we can get back to being the family that we used to be.",
        "Holden: You're not making this easy, you know.",
        "Lily: We can't stop Luke. You said yourself when he sets his mind on something, he's gonna do it.",
        "Holden: All right. If we leave now, we can make it to the rally. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Pardon me. Excuse me.",
        "Noah: Hey!",
        "Luke: Hey! Can you believe this turnout, especially on such short notice?",
        "Noah: Oh, I am not surprised. You have a way of getting people to do what you want.",
        "Luke: Well, not everyone.",
        "Noah: I'm sorry your parents aren't here.",
        "Luke: Well, you know what? You are. And that's enough for me.",
        "Noah: Now get up there and work your magic.",
        "[Clears throat]",
        "Luke: Hello. Uh, hello, can I have your attention? First, I'd like to thank you all for coming. Um, as you may know, my boyfriend and I were recently denied a place to live because we were gay. But thanks to some creative strong-arming on our part, we were able to get that turned around. But the point that I'm trying to make is the fact that this is still an issue is why we're here. This kind of prejudice has to stop. We have to stop it by standing together and fighting, not for tolerance, but for acceptance -- for the day that our rights are not an issue, but a matter of course. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I would -- I would like to introduce you to -- to my biggest supporter and a woman who I literally would not be here without -- my mother, Lily Snyder.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I still say we don't need this contract. I mean, anything Tom put in here, I mean, it's not like we can't go over that with Vienna ourselves.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but like Margo said. Having everything in writing, it's just not a bad idea.",
        "Brad: I'm just afraid that we're gonna offend her so much that she decides to bag the whole thing.",
        "Katie: She wouldn't do that. Would she?",
        "Brad: You know how sensitive she is. You know, I mean -- you know, the whole reason why she agreed to do this, she wanted to do this was because we were such good friends.",
        "Katie: Right, okay. So we'll just make sure she knows it's not a reflection on her.",
        "Brad: Good luck with that.",
        "[Ding]",
        "Katie: Ugh! The one time I turn this thing off. It's Vienna. We have to go.",
        "Brad: Where?",
        "Katie: The hospital.",
        "Brad: Why? What? What?",
        "Katie: No, it's not a bad thing. Vienna's just having her first prenatal checkup, and she wanted us to be there.",
        "Brad: See? I told you we didn't need a contract.",
        "Katie: Well, bring it just in case. The sooner we get the logistics over with, the better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Henry, you're missing it. Look at the screen! Can you see the baby? Is it a boy or a girl?",
        "Henry: It looks like bad television reception.",
        "Vienna: Henry.",
        "Henry: No, look, I'm sorry. There's like a billion little dots on there. I just hope that means there's not a billion little babies, okay?",
        "Vienna: Okay, would you please tell him which one of those dots the baby is? Doctor? What is it?",
        "Dr. Howell: I'm sorry.",
        "Vienna: About what? Is something wrong with the baby?",
        "Dr. Howell: Well, from what I can see -- there is no baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Crowd member #1: I saw you on TV! You were great!",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you. I'm grateful I was able to put two words together.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Crowd member #2: Any, uh, resistance from the station about carrying your message?",
        "Lily: Well, since I am part owner, I pretty much get to do whatever I want. [Laughter] No, seriously, my partner, who also happens to be the station manager, Kim Hughes -- she's fully supportive.",
        "Crowd member #1: Was there any negative response after it aired?",
        "Lily: Maybe we shouldn't mention about the note.",
        "Luke: Well, I mean, this is about getting everything out in the open, right?",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: Some coward actually did leave a pretty negative note on my mother's doorstep. But we're not gonna let that scare us away. If anything, what it teaches us is that we need to find positive, peaceful ways of fighting back. So I've done some other research on past gay-rights initiatives and seen how they dealt with hostility, and I think I left that research in my car. Um, so, I will go get that, and, uh, you guys, uh, party on.",
        "[Crowd member chuckles]",
        "[Applause]",
        "Holden: Why don't you stay? I'll go get the research.",
        "Luke: Uh, no. That's really kind of you, but I can do it. And -- and thank you also for coming. It means a lot to me.",
        "[Tires screeching]",
        "[Tires screeching]",
        "[Car hits Luke on purpose and than a guy picks up Luke and puts him in the car]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Are you all right?",
        "Vienna: How could there be a baby inside me one minute and not the next?",
        "Henry: The doctor said it could also be a false-positive.",
        "Vienna: No! It was there! I felt it! And now it's gone.",
        "Henry: Oh, Sweetie. I hate seeing you like this.",
        "Vienna: I can't help it.",
        "Henry: I know. And if it's causing you this much emotional distress, maybe you should reconsider.",
        "Vienna: No. I made a promise to Brad and Katie, and I intend to keep it.",
        "Katie: Hey, you decent?",
        "Vienna: Yes, of course. Come in.",
        "Katie: We got your message, and we rushed right over. Oh, don't tell me the exam's already over.",
        "Vienna: Afraid so.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Brad: So, where is it?",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Brad: The sonogram picture.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah.",
        "Vienna: Uh, I, um --",
        "Katie: The doctor didn't give you one?",
        "Henry: No, he didn't. And, actually, you guys need to know --",
        "Vienna: You know, it was the printer. The printer didn't work.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's a bummer.",
        "Brad: Well, I guess we'll have to make sure that all the equipment's working next time.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, next time.",
        "Katie: Well, so give us the details, at least.",
        "Brad: Yeah, what did the doctor say? Everything's okay, right?",
        "Vienna: Yes. Everything is perfect.",
        "Katie: You hear that? Our baby is perfect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I am just so happy that you and Luke are back together.",
        "Noah: Yeah, your son's a pretty hard guy to resist, especially when he gets all fired up about stuff.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Holden: Like I said. He takes after his mother. You know, he's been gone a long time getting that research.",
        "Lily: Well, maybe it wasn't where he thought it was.",
        "Noah: Oh, it's there. But if he wants to find anything in that car, he's gonna need a major excavation. You know what? I'm gonna go help him out.",
        "Noah: All right. Bring a bulldozer.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Why don't I take everyone to lunch at the Lakeview to celebrate?",
        "Vienna: I'm not that hungry.",
        "Brad: Oh, you may not be, but that linebacker you're carrying around might have other ideas.",
        "Katie: Hey, if Vienna's not hungry --",
        "Vienna: No, it's okay. Is it okay if me and Henry meet you there?",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, sure. Sounds good. Mommy will see you soon.",
        "Henry: A broken printer?",
        "Vienna: They were so happy. I couldn't tell them.",
        "Henry: They're gonna figure it out before too long. You know that.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but I need to deal with my own disappointment before I can deal with theirs. And hopefully it will be easier to tell them after lunch.",
        "Henry: Come here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: We came out here to make sure you didn't try to talk Luke into --",
        "Holden: Lily.",
        "Lily: What is it?",
        "Noah: Where's Luke?",
        "Holden: Something's happened to him.",
        "Lily: What do you mean something happened to Luke? Where is he?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Lily: Is that blood on your hand?!",
        "Holden: Lily, don't panic, okay? I'm not even sure that it's Luke's.",
        "Noah: Wait.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Noah: Wait, wait, wait. If something had happened to Luke, wouldn't he have come back inside for help?",
        "Holden: Maybe he couldn't. Hi, I need to report an accident. I'm not even sure that it was an accident. No, I wasn't here, but I think that my son was hit by a car. The Metro parking lot. No, no. He's not here. I don't know where my son is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Sounds good.",
        "Katie: Hey, guys!",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Katie: I hope it's cool with you that we decided to come here instead of the Lakeview. I just suddenly had a craving for a cheeseburger and chocolate shake. You'd think I was the pregnant one.",
        "Brad: Well, it's your baby, too. I say go for it.",
        "Katie: Have you been craving anything lately?",
        "Henry: Uh, scones and jam. Well, at least she was.",
        "Katie: Oh, you're not anymore?",
        "Vienna: Mmm.",
        "Katie: Well, I guess that's normal. My mom said the whole first half of her pregnancy, all she wanted was watermelon. And then the second half, pickles.",
        "Brad: Yeah, Henry. If you were pregnant, you'd be craving martinis.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Henry: Too bad we don't serve martinis here.",
        "Katie: Should we do it now?",
        "Brad: No point in putting it off.",
        "Katie: Okay, up front I want you to know that this is just a formality.",
        "Brad: Katie's right. I'm fine just the way things are right now.",
        "Katie: Well, so am I. But having a brother-in-law as an attorney, he thinks that we should just put everything in black and white.",
        "Henry: It's a contract.",
        "Vienna: A contract?",
        "Henry: About the baby.",
        "Vienna: The baby?",
        "Katie: There's nothing in there that we haven't already discussed or agreed upon. It's just -- you know, like us going to Lamaze together and us being there for the birth of the baby -- just -- just -- standard stuff.",
        "Brad: We don't want you to feel weird about this. This doesn't change anything. We would always know how lucky we are to have friends like you two.",
        "Katie: Yes. Absolutely. I mean, what you're doing and what you've agreed to do, it's the greatest gift any couple could give another couple.",
        "Brad: You know, it's a piece of paper. I mean, really, that's all it is. It's just a piece of paper. We trust you two more than we practically trust anyone in the world.",
        "Katie: How could we not? You're making our biggest dream come true.",
        "Vienna: Stop. Please, just stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse #2: He appears to be the victim of a hit-and-run. I checked his vitals. Unconscious but stable.",
        "Doctor: Who brought him in?",
        "Nurse #2: Apparently he was left outside the E.R. without any I.D.",
        "Doctor: Try this number while I examine him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Luke came out to get some papers that were in his car.",
        "Margo: What kind of papers?",
        "Noah: Some research he was doing on gay rights. He was gonna read it to the crowd.",
        "Margo: Did you notice anyone follow him out of the club?",
        "Noah: I didn't watch him leave.",
        "Lily: Neither did I.",
        "Holden: I did, but I didn't see anyone following him.",
        "Margo: Well, were there any hecklers in the club -- anyone who would have taken issue with the fact that he's gay?",
        "Noah: No, if there was, I didn't see any.",
        "Holden: Were you able to find anything out about that note that Lily gave you earlier?",
        "Margo: No, not yet.",
        "Lily: Wait. You think the person that sent that note has something to do with Luke missing? Do you?",
        "Margo: It's possible.",
        "Lily: Oh, my God.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't go there yet until we know all the facts. Why don't you search the area? Whoever it was, it looks like they were driving fast. They left skid marks. Maybe we can trace the tire tracks to a specific make and model. And, also, call forensics. Tell them to put a rush on the blood work. The sooner we find out whether it's Luke's or not, the better.",
        "Holden: I knew I should have come out to the car. I knew it wasn't safe!",
        "Margo: No, if you had gone after him -- they were targeting Luke. The would have found another way to get to him.",
        "Noah: I just want to know where Luke is.",
        "Holden: I'm gonna look for him.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Hello? Yes, this is Lily Snyder. Yes, I have a son named Luke. We'll be right there.",
        "Holden: What is it?",
        "Noah: Is he all right?",
        "Lily: He's at Memorial. He's unconscious. They think he might be a victim of a hit-and-run.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Vienna: You didn't tell them anything, did you?",
        "Henry: But we're gonna have tell them sooner or later.",
        "Vienna: No, I can't. They're counting on me so much. How can I say I've already failed?",
        "Henry: No, you -- no. You haven't failed at anything. Even the fact that you got pregnant right out of the gate like that, that was a fluke, anyway.",
        "Vienna: If I got pregnant. Maybe it was just a false-positive, and I just imagined the whole thing, and I can't get pregnant.",
        "Henry: It's okay. Yes, you can. And you will. Maybe not as soon as you thought you were, but you will, okay? Let's go back in and tell them, all right? Let's get this over with.",
        "Vienna: Please, Henry. Can we just wait a little longer? I need a little bit more time.",
        "Katie: Forget signing anything. We do not need a piece of paper to make sure you'll keep up your end of the bargain. We know you will.",
        "Brad: Hell, you already have.",
        "Vienna: It's all right. I'm signing.",
        "Brad: You sure?",
        "Vienna: Positive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You told me that you had a bad feeling about the rally, and -- and I was so caught up, I didn't listen to you.",
        "Holden: We don't even know for sure that this was connected to the rally.",
        "Lily: But if it was, and I didn't stop him, I'll never forgive myself.",
        "Noah: Come on, Luke. You can't get us all fired up and then just check out on us. Anyway, there's no way I'm moving into that apartment without you. So, you know -- wake up before Mr. Reese sues us.",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Noah: Hey, yourself.",
        "Lily: Thank God.",
        "Luke: Where am I?",
        "Holden: You're in the hospital.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Lily: You don't remember what happened?",
        "Luke: Uh, the -- the last thing I remember is looking for those papers in the front seat of the car.",
        "Noah: You don't -- you don't remember how you got here?",
        "Holden: Who brought you?",
        "Luke: Not a clue. Oh, my head hurts so much, I couldn't remember if I wanted to.",
        "Lily: All right, well, don't try to think about it. Just relax, rest. Oh, Luke, we are so grateful that you're all right. Where are you going?",
        "Luke: I've got to get back to the rally.",
        "Holden: No, no. You forget the rally. You shouldn't have been there in the first place.",
        "Luke: Dad, whatever happened, you can't think it's connected. Is that what you think?",
        "Lily: We don't know yet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I don't care what you say. I let them down.",
        "Henry: Oh, stop. Stop. You went out of your way for them. You -- you put their needs ahead of yours.",
        "Vienna: And yours.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Vienna: You know, when I didn't want to make love because I was afraid of hurting the baby? You hated it!",
        "Henry: Well, yeah. Was it such a good idea not making love? And the emotional roller coaster?",
        "Vienna: You see, that's the second time you mentioned that today.",
        "Henry: That's because I think I have a point.",
        "Vienna: You're just relieved there wasn't a baby, aren't you?",
        "Henry: Don't put words in my mouth, please.",
        "Vienna: That's why you kept pushing me to tell Brad and Katie because you want this whole thing to be over.",
        "Henry: If we're gonna go through this kind of hell every time something goes wrong, then, yes, I do want this to be over.",
        "Vienna: How can you say that?",
        "Henry: I have never minced words about how I felt about this. Now, he you -- have you even read my book? It's in here. It's -- its page 295. \"Having kids is like drowning into a daily war zone.\" The book Henry feels the same as the real Henry, sweetheart. No, no, don't -- please don't. Please don't. I hate it when you do this, please.",
        "Vienna: You know, I thought I was helping them. And for the first time in my life, I had a purpose. I -- I'm not ready to give this up yet.",
        "Henry: It's no mystery that you and Brad having a baby is not my idea of a good time, but -- if not having a baby makes you this miserable, then we can't have that, either. Every time you suffer -- every time you suffer, I suffer. Boy, do I suffer.",
        "Vienna: Well -- I'm not pregnant now. So there's nothing to risk right now. Maybe I can do something about your suffering. So, just stop it.",
        "Henry: What? You mean it?",
        "Vienna: Just know that I intend to keep my promise to Brad and Katie.",
        "Henry: I completely understand. Now, please, please, end my suffering.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: This is because you didn't get your chocolate shake.",
        "Katie: Thanks. You know, when Vienna ran out like that, for a second, I thought that she had changed her mind about helping us.",
        "Brad: No, she wouldn't do that. She's too good a friend.",
        "Katie: I like to think I'm a pretty good friend, but I don't know if I'd be willing to carry a baby for nine months and then just give it up.",
        "Brad: Well, you're not Vienna. I'm just saying. You want to be a mother. She wants to be pregnant. And she is. So we are gonna have the family that you always dreamed of.",
        "Katie: We are, aren't we? I can feel everything just falling into place.",
        "Brad: And I promise, Katie, this time nothing's gonna mess it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hi.",
        "Lily: Did you find out anything?",
        "Margo: No, nothing yet. But don't worry. We're not gonna give up till we find who's behind this.",
        "Luke: I'm not worried.",
        "Holden: Maybe you should be.",
        "Margo: Yeah, your dad's right. Until we know for sure this hit-and-run isn't a hate crime, then you got to stay out of the spotlight.",
        "Luke: But the momentum is so strong. After the broadcast and the rally, disappearing now is the worst thing I could do for the cause.",
        "Holden: Do you want something else to happen, Luke?",
        "Luke: All I know is that I don't want to live in fear. If I do, they win. Dad, please don't ask me to give up the most important work of my life.",
        "Doctor: If he doesn't, I will. You need rest and observation for at least the next 48 hours.",
        "Holden: I had nothing to do with it. I swear.",
        "Margo: You know what? I still have questions for the three of you. You want to come on down to the station? We'll finish up there?",
        "Lily: I'm so proud of you.",
        "Luke: Well, the feeling's mutual.",
        "Lily: I love you.",
        "Luke: I love you, too, Mom.",
        "Holden: I don't want to take this away from you. I just want you to be safe. If anything ever happened to you, I could never forgive myself.",
        "Luke: Well, if anything does, it's not gonna happen here.",
        "Holden: All right. See you soon.",
        "Noah: And, uh -- I'll keep the momentum going.",
        "Luke: I knew I could count on you.",
        "Noah: I can't promise to inspire the masses the way you and your mom do.",
        "Luke: Well, you inspire me every day.",
        "Holden: You think maybe we should put a guard outside the door just as a precaution?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I'll get on that. We'll see who's available when we get to the station. Come on.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Luke: You can't get enough of me, can you, Noah? Damian?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Liberty: How could you think that they would actually charge you for robbery?",
        "Parker: Yeah, they really are.",
        "Jack: All he has to do is admit what he did was wrong, act genuinely remorseful, and the D.A. will drop the charges.",
        "Carly: I'm not gonna sit back and watch my son go to jail!",
        "Craig: We're gonna go down to the station with Parker, and I'm gonna handle it.",
        "Luke: What do you want from me?",
        "Damian: Just a chance, Luke -- to get to know my son again.",
        "Luke: That's never gonna happen.",
        "Lily: If you love Luke as much as you claim you do, you leave him alone.",
        "Damian: What if I can't?",
        "Lily: Then you're gonna hurt him again."
