        "Lily defends Craig's offer to help, as Dusty is sure that there is something underhanded to his offer. Dusty realizes Lily didn't read the papers that she signed. Meg is proud of Craig's seemingly selfless act for Lily, but Craig is guilt ridden, as he secretly knows his motives. Maddie doesn't believe Casey would turn them in, but Will and Gwen think they can't afford to take the chance and prepare to leave town now. Casey considers telling the local sheriff what is wrong, but then decides to call Margo instead. Maddie wants to take her punishment for what she did to Adam; she convinces Will and Gwen to leave her behind finally, just as they walk into Casey coming back. Paul buys Parker and Faith a Ouija Board and has fun asking it questions. Paul asks the Board whom Meg loves and it spells out his name, as Meg watches smiling. Dusty confronts Craig about his motives with Lily and Worldwide; Craig plays a cat and mouse game with him. Casey explains he called Margo, but he changed his mind. He isn't going to judge what happened in the woods; he is just trying to accept and deal with it, but he loves Maddie and wants to be with her. Maddie realizes Casey jumped bail to be with her. Casey becomes a fugitive like the other three. Paul wants Meg to come back to him, but she suggests they take it one day at a time; Paul is happy with that and seals it with a kiss, which Craig secretly sees. Casey agrees to give up his life to protect Maddie. Will, Gwen, Maddie and Casey agree to start new lives once they get to Canada and start things off by all burning their licenses. Dusty tells Lily that he thinks Craig is up to something, even though Lily holds steadfast in her belief that Craig wouldn't betray her. Dusty thinks it is time to call Lucinda and get her involved. Lily worries about what is going to happen once Lucinda finds out."

    "Transcript": [
        "Dusty: We're getting sued by a dozen families and you bring in Montgomery for damage control? A convicted felon?",
        "Lily: He's not going public with any of this.",
        "Dusty: The financial press is going to find out.",
        "Lily: So what, so what if they find out, he's a member of the family -- he's a friend. He's simply stepping up as an advisor.",
        "Dusty: You had no business involving him.",
        "Lily: Are you questioning my authority? I mean I don't want to pull rank on you Dusty, but I do own a large portion of this company.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, your stocks are doing great.",
        "Lily: Maybe we should buy.",
        "Dusty: With what? With what -- you -- we have nothing in reserves. You spent it all on baby food!",
        "Lily: My mother left me here to take charge of this company while she's away. She left me with power of attorney and her confidence.",
        "Dusty: This is how you treat her confidence? By handing it over to that guy?",
        "Lily: I didn't hand over anything. Craig was very generous to offer to pay for those settlements. We're trying to salvage something --",
        "Dusty: Oh, he's not trying to salvage this company! He's in it for himself!",
        "Lily: No, that's not true.",
        "Dusty: No? What are the terms?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Here, sit down.",
        "Meg: I am -- thank you. I am so proud of you.",
        "Craig: Wow, that's a first.",
        "Meg: That's not true. I've seen the gentler, kinder Craig before.",
        "Craig: Wishful thinking, Meg. You know me -- the left hands always hiding what the right hand is up to.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well when are you going to stop pretending you rode to Lily's rescue just to impress me?",
        "Craig: You're not impressed?",
        "Meg: Why do you always have your guard up? I'm on your side -- I want you to be the man you keep saying you are. A decent person who's willing to step up and help somebody who needs it.",
        "Craig: Yeah that's me. Craig Montgomery -- boy scout.",
        "Meg: Craig, you offered to help Lily manage a terrible situation. She was going through hell about Ethan -- and all the other sick kids. And she was scared to death that her mother would never forgive her for jeopardizing Worldwide. And you fixed that. Not because you wanted something for yourself, but because you felt for her. You wanted to help her.",
        "Craig: Look, I'm glad that Lily is relieved. But she's embellishing a bit. It wasn't a selfless act. We made a deal. I saw an opportunity -- to help her, of course, but I also saw that it was a good way to make some money. It was business. She's a businesswoman, she understands that.",
        "Meg: Why are you so scared to admit that you're a good person? I mean you've spent weeks trying to convince me that you can change and now that you have, why deny it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: You know you didn't have to walk me all the way here. I know the way.",
        "Paul: I know you do, but I wanted to stretch my legs. And it gave me a chance to work off the cookies that you gave me, 'cause you know, I'm feeling a little fat. They were terrific by the way. Terrific cookies, thank you so much for bringing them to me.",
        "Faith: Well, you're welcome, but are you going to tell me what's in the bag?",
        "Paul: Maybe. You think Parker's here?",
        "Faith: He should be. Um, Parker?",
        "Parker: Hey, Paul. What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: Well, Faith was nice enough to make me some cookies. So, I thought the least that I could do was bring you two a little present.",
        "Parker: What is it?",
        "Faith: All he'd tell me is that it would help us. I forgot the word.",
        "Paul: Prog -- prog -- prognosticate. Portend. Foresee, predict, prophesy?",
        "Parker: You've been reading the dictionary again, Paul? You really got to get out more.",
        "Paul: Yeah I know, I don't have much of a social life do I?",
        "Faith: So what is it?",
        "Paul: Patience. All will be revealed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Casey wouldn't turn us in, would he?",
        "Gwen: I don't know.",
        "Maddie: I mean he just needs time to think and -- right?",
        "Will: Maddie, obviously he's in shock. He just found out his brother is dead. Our brother died.",
        "Maddie: Exactly. He's in shock. And when he's in shock, he likes to keep things to himself. Just like when that guy from the poker site showed up.",
        "Gwen: This is different, Maddie. He just found out that his brother is dead and we're the ones that killed him.",
        "Maddie: I killed him.",
        "Will: And Gwen helped bury him, and I took you both on the run. But most of all? We didn't tell him, we didn't trust him, so he's mad at all of us.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, he's mad, and he's hurt and grief stricken -- but this is us. He's not going to turn us in. He wouldn't do that.",
        "Will: No, I don't think we can count on that.",
        "Maddie: So what are you saying? He's going to call the cops?",
        "Will: Maddie, you know what I'm saying. I think we should pack up and get out of here, all right?",
        "Maddie: I think -- I think we need to talk about this.",
        "Gwen: Well, talk about it on the bus. You need to start packing.",
        "Maddie: The bus? If he goes to the cops, that's the first place they're gonna look.",
        "Will: Second place. They're going to come here first.",
        "Gwen: Start packing.",
        "Maddie: So, where are we going to go? What are we going to do?",
        "Gwen: You know what, she's right. I mean if Casey did go to the police, they're gonna have an APB out on us already.",
        "Maddie: They're going to be people at the train station, airport --",
        "Will: All right, well look, we still have a little time -- it's enough time to get across the lake and maybe take a bus there.",
        "Maddie: And how can we get across the lake, Will?",
        "Will: There's a rowboat docked outside the cabin.",
        "Maddie: You want us to row across a half frozen lake?",
        "Gwen: We don't have a choice Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Yes, we do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sheriff: Hey, back so soon? How's the scouting?",
        "Casey: Uh, the scouting?",
        "Sheriff: For your movie. You know you ought to check out the old copper mine. It's loaded with atmosphere and bats. Better tell the girls keep their hats on. Women hate bats.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Sheriff: Yeah -- I'd buy you a beer but you don't look old enough. How bout a soda?",
        "Casey: No thanks.",
        "Sheriff: Son, are you all right?",
        "Casey: Me? Yeah. I'm fine, yeah.",
        "Sheriff: You don't look fine. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Casey: You're the sheriff?",
        "Sheriff: Duly elected. So if you're in any kind of trouble, I'm your man.",
        "Sheriff: Are you in trouble, Son? We could step outside if you'd rather.",
        "Casey: No, that's all right.",
        "Sheriff: So, what can I do for you?",
        "Casey: Actually -- my cell phone is not getting very good reception up here. And I was wondering -- and I'll pay you for it, but I was wondering if I could use your phone?",
        "Sheriff: Right over there. Just drop the money in the jar.",
        "Casey: Hi, can I speak to Lieutenant Hughes, please? It's urgent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Maddie, if we stay here, we'll be arrested.",
        "Maddie: Look, you were not here when I told Casey the truth. You didn't see his face. He was devastated. We have all been so worried about getting caught of getting caught that we forgot what ready matters. Adam is dead because of me.",
        "Gwen: No, Will knows that it was an accident.",
        "Maddie: I know. I should have listened to you, I should have called the cops -- i should have called the ambulance. God --",
        "Gwen: Maddie, listen to me. After everything that you've gone through, it's understandable.",
        "Maddie: So what, I get a free pass the rest of my life? I can't live my life like that, like a cripple, or a coward. You understand what I'm saying?",
        "Will: Yeah, I do.",
        "Maddie: So this is what we're gonna do. The cops are going to be looking for three people. So you two go together, and go.",
        "Gwen: And what are you going to do?",
        "Maddie: I can't run from this anymore. I'm staying here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Just another scooch. Scooch, good! There you go. Hey, hey! Get out of the bag.",
        "Faith: What? I wasn't doing anything.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right.",
        "Paul: All right. Sit.",
        "Faith: Where?",
        "Parker: On the ceiling. Why do you think we just moved the table?",
        "Paul: Prepare yourselves.",
        "Parker: For what?",
        "Paul: For the swami.",
        "Parker: What's a swami?",
        "Paul: You don't know what a swami is? You're hopeless. I'm the swami. I'm the swami. Now, close your eyes. I'm not kidding close your eyes. Now free yourselves of all negative feeling. And no giggling, please. You don't want to offend the spirits.",
        "Parker: The spirits?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Look, you got to give me a break here. I'm trying to build some suspense.",
        "Parker: Just give us the present, Paul. Come on.",
        "Paul: Ta-da.",
        "Faith: What is it?",
        "Paul: What is it?",
        "Parker: It's a Ouija board?",
        "Paul: It's Ouija board! You know what it is. See? You're smarter already.",
        "Faith: Is that that thing they use at a s\ufffdance?",
        "Paul: Yup. You ask the Ouija board a question and the Ouija board gives you an answer.",
        "Parker: It's a fake. They just pretend to make it say stuff.",
        "Paul: It better not be a fake, it cost me $19.95. Now, breathe. And empty your minds.",
        "Parker: Got an hour?",
        "Paul: Okay, fool with the occult and see what happens. Put your hands -- just your fingers on the planchette.",
        "Faith: The what?",
        "Paul: The planchette.",
        "Parker: This thing.",
        "Paul: Yes. Oh, great spirit are you with us? If you are, please pay no attention to the giggling girl, and speak, spirit, speak.",
        "Parker: Ribbit. Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.",
        "Paul: You need to concentrate. We need all of your good vibrations.",
        "Parker: Ribbit.",
        "Paul: Are you here spirit?",
        "Faith: Oh my gosh!",
        "Parker: He's moving it.",
        "Paul: Yes or no.",
        "Faith: He's here!",
        "Parker: She's here. That's what my mom used.",
        "Paul: Okay, question time. Anybody have any question that they want to ask the great spirit? Okay, I'll ask some questions. Well, you're an open book. Oh, great spirit, please tell us Faith's deepest darkest secret.",
        "Faith: Um, yeah. I don't want to do this, so \ufffd",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: If this means you're willing reconsider your newfound career as a waitress and move into Fairwinds, I'm a new man.",
        "Meg: What this means is that you're willing to reconsider how you live your life.",
        "Craig: Mmm. You've overestimated my --",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Craig Montgomery at a loss for words? Wow, you have changed.",
        "Craig: No. I really haven\ufffdt.",
        "Meg: Maybe you're finally willing to be who you really are. You know, I always knew you had a good heart. You just had some bad habits, and habits are hard to break. But when I broke it off with Paul, you were so kind.",
        "Craig: I had an agenda, I admit it.",
        "Meg: Yes, you did. But when I said no, you didn't cross me off the list. Okay, maybe you bought me some ridiculously expensive necklace and -- you did try to help me keep my job by planting that diary at the hospital. But you wouldn't do that now. I mean there hasn't been a grand gesture in days. Instead, you went to Lily's rescue.",
        "Craig: I wish you wouldn't call it that.",
        "Meg: She called it that. Look, whether you like it or not, the secret is out. You're a good person after all. Not that Lily had any doubts. She told me that she does trust you, and she wasn't surprised that you did something selfless.",
        "Craig: There's no such thing.",
        "Meg: What you need to really work on is accepting a compliment. Look I got to go. I want to check on Ethan.",
        "Craig: Well, give the family my best.",
        "Meg: You already have. What you did -- it means a lot to me. It proves that I was right to trust you. I'm glad you're my friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I am well aware of our exposure in this case.",
        "Dusty: 12 cases.",
        "Lily: That's why I made a deal with Craig to limit the exposure. What would you have done? We have no money in the reserves -- 12 families -- 12 families, threatening to sue us? We stall? What do we pretend that we're not at fault here? Do you know how much that would cost in legal bills alone before pay- outs? You're worried about the stock prices. How would the market react if we just stood there day after day and did nothing -- nothing! The media would have had a field day -- we'd never recover. Is that what you want?",
        "Dusty: Was it the right move? To go to a man with a criminal record?",
        "Lily: Dusty, you have had your run-ins with the law over the years, you have bent as many laws as Craig has broken them -- and my mother still hired you. So let's not go there.",
        "Dusty: You're comparing me to that guy?",
        "Lily: No. No, I know you have a history. You fought him for custody of Johnny.",
        "Dusty: You think this is personal?",
        "Lily: Yes, of course it's personal. You lost your son because of him.",
        "Dusty: It's not about that don't you get it? He's been after this company for years.",
        "Lily: Bottom line, he's Lucy\ufffds father, he's family, he's a friend -- I trust him.",
        "Dusty: Did he give you cash?",
        "Lily: Of course he didn't give me cash?",
        "Dusty: I thought you were friends.",
        "Lily: We're friends. This is a business transaction.",
        "Dusty: He gives you what -- money and you give him -- what?",
        "Lily: We have not worked out all of the details -- yet. His lawyers are going over the logistics.",
        "Dusty: You have no idea what this is costing us do you?",
        "Lily: It's all in the paperwork work.",
        "Dusty: What paperwork?",
        "Lily: Paperwork --that I signed. And we will have a copy of it. As soon as it's filed.",
        "Dusty: You already signed something that you don't know the terms of?",
        "Lily: Craig offered to settle these lawsuits. I had to do that. Where are you going?",
        "Dusty: Damage control!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: I don't want to do this.",
        "Paul: I'm so sorry. I'm really -- I'm sorry. I should never have asked you a personal question without asking your permission to do so first. I know that you don't want Parker to know where you hide the $93 that you made babysitting.",
        "Parker: That's nothing. I've made a hundred mucking out the stable.",
        "Paul: Okay, why don't we ask the Ouija a really important question? Oh, great spirit, who does Auntie Meg love?",
        "Parker: P for Parker",
        "Faith: She can't love you, you're too young.",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Faith: You're not the only one whose name starts with p-A.",
        "Parker: U?",
        "Faith: Paul! Aunt Meg loves Paul! Aunt Meg, you love Paul.",
        "Paul: The Ouija never lies.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Dusty! And to what do I owe this discomfort?",
        "Dusty: Show me the papers.",
        "Craig: The papers?",
        "Dusty: The papers, yeah -- you forced Lily to sign.",
        "Craig: I didn't force anyone to sign anything.",
        "Dusty: Her mind wasn't straight at the time and you told her you'd fix things. Are you trying to work your way into my company?",
        "Craig: Your company? I was under the impression that Worldwide belonged to Lucinda.",
        "Dusty: I hope it's still hers.",
        "Craig: You're not as dumb as you look.",
        "Dusty: Show me the papers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Maddie, come on, please. I'm not leaving you alone here knowing the police can come through the door any minute.",
        "Maddie: I'm not leaving.",
        "Gwen: Fine, then neither am I.",
        "Will: I know you feel bad but you're going to feel a lot worse in a cell for 25 to life. We're sticking to the plan and we're going to Canada. And I know you feel guilty to, but I'm you husband and I get a say right now and I say we're not sticking around waiting to get arrested -- we're leaving while we still can.",
        "Gwen: I'm not walking out on my best friend.",
        "Will: Gwen, staying here isn't going to help her.",
        "Maddie: He's right, you need to go.",
        "Gwen: I can\ufffdt.",
        "Maddie: Come on, listen to me. What happen with Adam is my story to tell, not yours and I need to tell it. And you need to go to Canada and write songs and adopt lots of babies and live your life. And don't worry about me I'll be okay. I mean I'm so well behaved I'll be out in about half the time. And then I'll move in next door.",
        "Gwen: It's not fair, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Come on just give me a hug and let's go. Its okay, go. You called your mom?",
        "Casey: Yeah. But I hung up before they put her on.",
        "Will: So did you tell the police what happened or not?",
        "Casey: No. But I don't think I feel that good about it.",
        "Gwen: None of us feel good about this, Casey.",
        "Maddie: If you still want to tell her, I'll go with you. I'm just really glad that you came back.",
        "Casey: Now look, I'm sorry I ran out like that. It's just -- he's my brother, you know. And I know he was no saint but neither am I. And he was there for me so many times. And I just, I can't believe that he's dead. But I wasn't there. So I don't know what went down in the woods. I'm not saying I don't believe you, it's just that sometimes things happen and then you feel like hell afterwards. But I'm not going to pass judgment on anyone. Especially you.",
        "Maddie: I'm so sorry.",
        "Casey: Yeah, me too.",
        "Will: None of us had the right to expect you to understand, so thanks.",
        "Gwen: Hey, has anybody asked about us?",
        "Casey: No, everyone thinks you're still thinks you guys are in Florida on spring break. And I told your brother that you went to see your sister.",
        "Maddie: I couldn't face telling him that I was leaving.",
        "Gwen: So it should be about another week before anybody starts to think that we're missing?",
        "Casey: No, your mom, she was snooping around, but she didn't find anything.",
        "Gwen: Do you think you could say you got an e-mail from us?",
        "Maddie: You know, I really don't think that we should get Casey anymore involved than he already is.",
        "Gwen: You're right. I'm sorry, that's a bad idea.",
        "Maddie: If anybody asks just tell them that Will and Gwen are in Florida and you and I broke up -- case closed.",
        "Casey: Maddie, the thing is, I'm out on bail.",
        "Maddie: I know that. That's why you need to get home as soon --",
        "Casey: No, Maddie, it's too late for that.",
        "Maddie: No, it's not. Don't say that.",
        "Casey: Yes. Look, if I go back to Oakdale, they're going to revoke my bail and I'm going to going to go to prison, all right. I need to stay here because I'm a fugitive just like you guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Yeah, Aunt Meg, we're prognosticating.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Auntie Meg you want to prognosticate with us?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Faith: Well, sit. Closer. It's better for the vibe.",
        "Meg: The vibe? What are you teaching these kids?",
        "Paul: I don't have to teach them a thing.",
        "Faith: So Aunt Meg it's your turn to ask the question.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Auntie Meg, what is it that you want to know?",
        "Meg: Why don't you ask something?",
        "Faith: Fine, but you're in charge of the planchette.",
        "Meg: The what?",
        "Parker: It's this thing. You put your fingers on it and the spirit moves it.",
        "Meg: I see.",
        "Paul: Oh Great Spirit -- here is my question.",
        "Meg: Wait, wait, I thought the kids were asking the questions.",
        "Faith: Paul has to ask.",
        "Parker: He's got the inside track.",
        "Paul: Eh, what can I say?",
        "Meg: Oh, I'm sure you'll think of something.",
        "Paul: Oh, Great Spirit who knows all kinds of things that nobody else can seem to figure out, who is it, that Auntie Meg just can't resist?",

        "Meg: You know, I don't think the spirit's are ready to commit. Where're you guys going?",

        "Parker: Upstairs.",
        "Meg: Did you chase them away from here?",
        "Paul: No. They're just prognosticators.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. They can tell the future. And they know I'm about to kiss you.",

        "Bartender: Can I get you the usual, Mr. Donovan?",
        "Dusty: No thanks, I'm good.",
        "Bartender: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Generous mood.",
        "Craig: Well, I made a lot of money today.",
        "Dusty: Robbing the rich?",
        "Craig: No point in robbing the poor.",
        "Dusty: I need to see the papers that Lily signed.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't see her going for that -- you looking over her shoulder. She's got Lucinda\ufffds confidence -- power of attorney. She doesn't need you second-guessing her.",
        "Dusty: I'm not actually here for her. I am here for Lucinda.",
        "Craig: And how is the old battleaxe?",
        "Dusty: She's hot. Never takes it lying down.",
        "Craig: Take what? You don't know what's happening do you? And quite frankly, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag. And quite frankly, you're a -- you're not really at this level for discussion, are you? You're more of the enforcer type, from what I understand. Lucinda, she makes the deals and then you show up to make sure that all the parties are playing nice. Well, you know, Lily and I, we have our own working arrangement so, we don't need any help. So thanks a lot, big boy.",
        "Dusty: The problem is Lily didn't know what she was signing.",
        "Craig: Well, she'll get a copy once my attorney files all the pertinent documents and everything's official. And then you and Lucinda and Lily, you can meet in the boardroom and discuss your options. Why so glum, Dusty? Lily thinks that I saved Worldwide.",
        "Dusty: Everybody knows you got it in for Lucinda so, I don't understand what all the mystery's about.",
        "Craig: Really? For fun you should see the look on your face. A little worried about the past, Dusty? All the times you tried to stick it to me. Taking my son away, poisoning my relationship with my daughter, and let's not forget shooting me in the chest. Given all that, I think that my response is -- measured.",
        "Dusty: Are you aiming at me?",
        "Craig: You know that little sick feeling in the pit of your stomach? That's guilt. Because deep down, you know you deserve it. You deserve to be punished. And I will. But not quite yet. See, this little Worldwide gambit is just business. I see that there's money to be made and, quite frankly, I simply don't have time for revenge. But if you get bent out of shape during the whole thing, I have no complaints. What's the matter, Dusty? Scared? You should be scared. Because unlike Lily, I read everything that I sign. In fact, I'm so thorough my lawyer thinks that I don't need him. I've researched Worldwide from top to bottom. I've read every memo you've ever read, even memos that Lucinda never shared with you. I know Worldwide better than you. I know her strengths, her weaknesses, her secrets.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you're a computer hacker.",
        "Craig: I'm hardly a hacker. I had permission.",
        "Dusty: Lily gave you access?",
        "Craig: She's my friend. And you know corporations are a lot like people on paper. Worldwide's no different. She's bullheaded like Lucinda. She's vulnerable like Lily. And she's always a step behind like you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Dusty: Hi, Lil. Yeah, I'm talking to your old friend right now. And he assured me that he's got our interests at heart. And that he would never hurt you or your family. No problem. I don't know how you live with yourself.",
        "Craig: Lily's a big girl.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah. I think she knows a good friend lied to her.",
        "Craig: I never lied to her.",
        "Dusty: You took advantage of my friend. And now the situation's ugly.",
        "[Craig remembering]",
        "Meg: Look, whether you like it or not, the secret is out. You are a good person after all. Not that Lily had any doubts. She told me that she does trust you, and she wasn't surprised that you did something selfless.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You betrayed Lily for what? Money? Revenge?",
        "Craig: You don't know me as well as you think you know me.",
        "Dusty: I know who you are.",
        "Lawyer: I've got to hand it to you, Craig. If there was ever a time to pick up Worldwide stock, the price is rock bottom.",
        "Craig: So, I advance Worldwide money for the lawsuits and then I become the number one stockholder?",
        "Lawyer: As soon as I file the paperwork, the company's yours.",
        "Craig: Don't file just yet.",

        "Meg: Okay, don't change the subject.",
        "Paul: Canoodle. Canoodle, that's a great word.",
        "Meg: Canoodle?",
        "Paul: Yeah, oh, I thought you'd never ask.",
        "Meg: This -- this is canoodling?",
        "Paul: Yeah. This is how we slept last night, all night.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and I have the crick in my neck to prove it. So you ran out and bought a Ouija board?",
        "Paul: Small price to pay. $19.95, actually. I wanted to check in on Ethan.",
        "Meg: Mm. That's good.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Meg: A little bit lower. Not that low.",
        "Paul: I just wanted to pinch you, make sure you're real. Are you coming back to me?",

        "Maddie: Tell them that you were at the library or pulling an all-nighter.",
        "Casey: No, Maddie, it's done, okay? I jumped bail. Besides, this whole thing's my fault.",
        "Gwen: Hey, that's not true.",
        "Maddie: What happened to Adam has nothing to do with you.",
        "Casey: No, Maddie, okay, I gambled myself into so much debt, that I had to steal from my best friend. And then when my brother tried to cover for me, which, Will, I know what he did wasn't right --",
        "Will: Casey, we don't have to go back over it.",
        "Casey: But the point is, this is my fault. Adam was on the run because of me.",
        "Maddie: You didn't make Adam attack Gwen.",
        "Gwen: No, and you didn't have anything to do with this.",
        "Maddie: You have to go home.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I didn't come here because I felt guilty. All I knew was that you were in trouble and I had to get to you. I love you, all right? And that's not going to change. So if you want me to go back to Oakdale, and go to prison, fine. I will. Or you can let me stay here, and I can help you how ever I can.",
        "Will: Casey, before you decide anything, do you know what you're taking on? Because if you don't leave right now, then you can't ever go home. You can't see your mom or your dad, or Daniel. All that's over.",
        "Maddie: I can't let you do this.",
        "Casey: Look, you're not, okay? I did this to myself. Plus, if there's still a plus side, at least I hope, I hope you still love me.",
        "Maddie: Of course I still love you.",
        "Casey: Then what are we talking? Of course, I'm going to stay.",
        "Will: So, I guess it's the four of us.",
        "Gwen: All right, the plan is still to go to Canada, right?",
        "Casey: Wait, if we're going to cross the border, we're going to need passports, right? Because I didn't bring one.",
        "Gwen: You can't use it anyway, actually. None of us can.",
        "Maddie: You think they already know?",
        "Will: Well, it's not worth taking the risk.",
        "Gwen: Look, if there's anything out on the wire, even if it's just that we're missing, they'll be able to stop us once they see our id's.",
        "Will: And then it's right back to Oakdale.",
        "Maddie: So, what are we going to do?",
        "Casey: I know a guy that deals with fake id's.",
        "Will: Well, is he from Oakdale?",
        "Casey: No, I met him on the internet, he's a gambler. But he knows a guy who deals in credentials. Counterfeit credentials. But it's going to cost us.",
        "Gwen: How much do we have?",
        "Will: Well, I spent money on renting the cabin and the bus fare.",
        "Casey: I've got a couple hundred bucks.",
        "Maddie: Me too.",
        "Gwen: Is that enough?",
        "Casey: I don't know. We'll find out. Do you have a computer? She would not leave a burning building without that thing.",
        "Will: Look, Guys, before we do this, we've got to talk about it. Because this is a really big step.",
        "Casey: I don't think we have a choice.",
        "Will: I'm not saying we do. But if we do this, then we got to do it right. Because sooner or later, they're going to come looking for us. And we can't leave a trail. You know, we buy fake passports, and we go across the border, and it's got to be more than our id's that we leave behind. Everything's got to go. Not just our names, and our stories, but it's got to be who we are, the way we look, we got to become new people. Are you ready for that?",

I just have a few things to do here, then I'll be home. I love you too. Okay. Soon. Soon. Just give the kids a kiss from me. Okay, I love you. Bye. What is all this?",

        "Lily: Why do I have to consult you?",
