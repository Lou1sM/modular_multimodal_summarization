        "Lily: Faith? Why aren't you in school? Faith, I'm talking to you.",
        "Faith: Mom, I am so not in the mood.",
        "Lily: Too bad. What are you doing home from school in the middle of the day? And what are you doing wearing that dress?! I told you it was inappropriate. And when did you go back to Fashions to buy that? Faith! Oh, Baby, you're crying. Sweetie, what happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Whoa.",
        "Craig: Hey. Uh -- well? You like it?",
        "Parker: What? It's great. Between the factory and the warehouse, it really must have run you, though.",
        "Craig: You have to spend money to make money.",
        "Parker: Well, you know, if that's true, you're really gonna be making a lot.",
        "Craig: Parker, if your mother and I are gonna relaunch Monte Carlo in a way that matters, then we have to make it look top drawer. Sorry. What brings you around?",
        "Parker: Actually, it's money.",
        "Craig: What do you mean?",
        "Parker: Well, you know the debit card that's linked to my trust fund?",
        "Craig: Yeah. What about it?",
        "Parker: The company called and said there was increased activity. Which doesn't make any sense to me, because the only thing I've used it for is to fly to Minneapolis and visit Liberty and to pay for a hotel room when I'm there.",
        "Craig: Well, what did they say, exactly?",
        "Parker: It wasn't a person. It -- it was a recording.",
        "Craig: Oh. Oh, well, it's nothing to worry about. It can't be that serious, then.",
        "Parker: They called it a fraud alert, Craig. You know what? Just give me the password. I will go online. I will check out the charges and just see what's up.",
        "Craig: No. No, no, no. You have enough on your plate between school and going back and forth to see Liberty. I'll handle it.",
        "Carly: Handle what? Hi, Sweetie.",
        "Parker: Hey, Mom.",
        "Carly: What are you handling?",
        "Craig: Just trust fund stuff. Thanks for letting me know.",
        "Parker: Yeah, no problem. I really like the place.",
        "Carly: Yeah. It's great, isn't it? Hey, I thought you were headed to Minneapolis to visit with Liberty this afternoon.",
        "Parker: I am. I just have to drop off a paper at school, and then I'm going. I'll call you when I land, okay?",
        "Carly: Yes. Please do. Safe trip, okay?",
        "Parker: Thank you.",
        "Carly: Ah! Well, we've got to get this place looking more like an office and less like a storage room before the open house or the retail chain reps later this afternoon.",
        "Craig: Have a little Faith, Carly.",
        "Carly: In you?",
        "Craig: You know, if you're gonna walk in here on my arm for this thing, then you need to be wearing a drop-dead gorgeous dress.",
        "Carly: Sorry, Cowboy. I don't do your arm anymore. Get cracking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Ah, perfect timing.",
        "Jack: Hey. I am so beat.",
        "Carly: I'll buy you a double espresso. You can put this on here or back at the house.",
        "Jack: Put what -- what on?",
        "Carly: The open house for the relaunch of Monte Carlo. It's this afternoon. We're gonna showcase my fall and winter collections. That's your good suit, the one from our little adventure last fall.",
        "Jack: Carly, I just pulled a 12-hour overnight shift.",
        "Carly: Well, the party's only a couple of hours, and then you can sleep till tomorrow. Jack, I know you hate these things, but it's important to me. And I promise, a little caffeine and --",
        "Jack: No, it's not just that. I have a conflict.",
        "Carly: What kind of -- Janet?",
        "Jack: She has a doctor's appointment. I said I'd go with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Okay. Thanks for bringing me here.",
        "Dusty: You want me to go?",
        "Janet: Yeah. I don't want to put you out anymore.",
        "Dusty: You're not putting me out, Janet. I'm with you.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but this is just a routine exam, and I'm gonna be having plenty more where those came from, even before I have the baby.",
        "Dusty: Are you trying to ditch me?",
        "Janet: No, I'm not. I just don't want you to think I'm keeling over all the time. Besides, don't you have house keys to get?",
        "Dusty: I do.",
        "Janet: Okay, then. I won't be alone. Jack will be with me., Is that why you don't want to leave, because Jack's gonna be with me at the appointment?",
        "Dusty: No. I just want to take care of you. Have you heard from your father today?",
        "Janet: No. Why?",
        "Jack: I was just wondering.",
        "Janet: I haven't heard from Pop since Minneapolis.",
        "Dusty: I didn't know if he had been in touch or not.",
        "Janet: Honey, we've hardly been in touch for the past 20 years, but I guess I'm a little more used to that than you are. Listen, I'm gonna be fine. I promise, okay? Now go get us that house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'll tell Janet I can't make it. Dusty's probably with her, anyway.",
        "Carly: No. Jack, its okay.",
        "Jack: It's not okay. You're disappointed.",
        "Carly: Well, I want you to come to a cocktail party. Janet's having your baby. I think she trumps me on is one.",
        "Jack: You're sure?",
        "Carly: I'm sure. Like I told you, we're in this together. But if you're through early enough and you don't pass out from exhaustion, put that suit on and meet me at the new office space, okay?",
        "Jack: You're the best.",
        "Carly: Yes, I am. Good luck to Janet.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",

        "Faith: [Sobs] Look. They're all ganging up on me.",
        "Lily: Honey, why?",
        "Faith: I walked in this morning with this on, and they just went nuts about it. I don't know why. And they started saying that I was a slut and wrote all of these mean things on my wall.",
        "Lily: Your wall?",
        "Faith: Oh, Mom!",
        "Lily: All right. I'm calling the principal right now.",
        "Faith: No! You're just gonna make it worse! Oh go ahead. Say you told me so.",
        "Lily: I wasn't gonna do that. Faith, you are putting too much pressure on yourself, and you don't need to. I think that's why you ended up taking pills to make yourself feel better.",
        "Faith: Oh, that's perfect. So now I'm a slut and a junkie.",
        "Lily: I never said that. You're upset, but you need to give yourself a break and take some time to fit back into school. Kids can be really cruel, but they also have very short memories, and they change their mind every day.",
        "Faith: You totally don't get it!",
        "Lily: That's not true.",
        "Faith: You never had this problem! You were always popular! You are popular! Dad and Damian fought each other over you, and you are so not even, like, 16 anymore!",
        "Lily: Okay, Baby, this is what we're gonna do, okay? We're just gonna move on. We're gonna forget that today ever happened. New -- new outfit, new attitude, new day.",
        "Faith: You think I'm going back there? Are you crazy? I'm not going back there ever again.",
        "Lily: Faith --",
        "Faith: You! This is your fault!",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Lily: Parker, she needs your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Janet!",
        "Janet: Hi. Thanks for coming.",
        "Jack: How are you feeling?",
        "Janet: I feel fine. I think Dr. Morris is inside.",
        "Jack: Great.",
        "Janet: Hi, Dr. Morris. I brought, uh, my husband, Jack, with me.",
        "Jack: I know I'm supposed to stay outside for most of this, but I had a few questions, so I thought I'd get them out of the way and get out of your way.",
        "Janet: You wrote them down?",
        "Jack: I didn't want to forget any of them.",
        "Jack: So, if we -- if we wanted to know, uh, how long do we have to wait before we find out the sex of the baby?",
        "Janet: Well, it's gonna be soon, but it's not this soon.",
        "Jack: I don't understand why that's such a crazy question. Uh, how -- how soon are we in the clear for miscarriage risk?",
        "Dr. Morris: In general, only 5% of pregnancies miscarry after ten weeks.",
        "Jack: That's -- that's what I read. I'm glad -- I am glad to hear that out of your mouth. Oh, I also read that there's a study saying that caffeine can double the risk of miscarriage, so, I was thinking --",
        "Janet: Jack, Jack, I'm fine! The baby's fine!",
        "Jack: I just want to be sure, that's all.",
        "Janet: It's been a while since he's been a new father.",
        "Jack: No. Every day, there's these new studies coming out. I just want to -- I want to keep up to date with all that.",
        "Janet: Jack, everything's fine, okay?",
        "Jack: I know. I just -- I know.",
        "Dr. Morris: Look, every baby should have such a concerned dad waiting. You're a very lucky woman, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What do you got for me on Rocco Ciccone? Yeah, I know he owns a hardware store. Is that all it is? Really? Tell me. I'll call you back. Hey.",
        "Teri: Hey. I've got the catering menu worked out for the party today.",
        "Dusty: All right. Tell me about it later. I got to pick up some papers from the bank.",
        "Teri: Okay.",
        "Dusty: I need them for the realtor. I'm buying a house.",
        "Teri: A house? For you and Janet?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Teri: Wow. Wow. That's a bit -- uh, that's great. I -- I bet Janet's thrilled.",
        "Dusty: She loves it.",
        "Teri: Pop.",

        "Dusty: I own this place.",
        "Teri: Pop, don't.",

        "Teri: Okay. Well, what about those, uh, papers you need?",
        "Dusty: I'll get them later. Good luck today, Kid.",
        "Teri: Thanks, Boss. Don't start.",
        "Rocco: Start what? I don't trust that guy.",
        "Teri: Well, clearly, the feeling is mutual.",
        "Rocco: He's around your sister all the time, Teresa.",
        "Teri: If you have questions about their relationship, you should talk to Janet, really, not me.",
        "Rocco: Their relationship? What does that cop husband of hers think about that? He just looks the other way?",
        "Teri: I'm not gonna do this with you.",
        "Rocco: Do what?",
        "Teri: You were a million miles away from Janet and Liberty's lives until, what, a couple weeks ago? So I'm not gonna listen to you sit in judgment of her or Dusty or Jack, okay?",
        "Rocco: Teresa --",
        "Teri: I got to work on a catering order.",
        "Rocco: Piccolina, come on! Don't be like that!",

        "Dr. Morris: Mother and baby are doing great. You can both go on in.",

        "Dusty: Yeah. Thanks, Jack.",
        "Jack: Yeah, tell -- tell her that I heard the doctor give her the thumbs up, all right?",
        "Dusty: I will. Jack left. The doctor says everything's good.",

        "Dusty: It's ours.",
        "Janet: Our home. It's different than how I remember it.",
        "Dusty: Better different?",
        "Janet: Perfect different.",
        "Dusty: It's all ours.",
        "Janet: Oh, Dusty, I can't believe it. You know, the only thing I've ever wanted was my own home, and you've given it to me.",
        "Dusty: Am I doing good?",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey -- and we can move in whenever we want?",

        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah, so she can see what's going on.",
        "Janet: You've thought of everything. Please say we can look at it. Can we go look at it right now? Please, please, please? Oh, okay. The realtor didn't give you that.",
        "Dusty: No, no, that's from me.",
        "Janet: I love you.",
        "Dusty: I love you. Go take a look around. I'll call the realtor.",
        "Janet: Okay, okay, I will, but wait. Hold on. I feel more hopeful than I have in a really long time. That's because of you. I just don't know how to thank you.",
        "Dusty: You already have. You said yes. Go check it out.",
        "Janet: Yay!",
        "Dusty: Rocco.",
        "Rocco: Again?",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Rocco: Looking for my no-good daughter. And seeing you here, something tells me she's not far behind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Why are you still here?",
        "Parker: Mrs. Atkinson asked me to drop off your backpack for you.",
        "Faith: Well, now you did.",
        "Lily: Parker was just telling me how much time he's been spending with Liberty, and I think the next time he goes to see her, you should go with him.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Faith: You'd let me go to Minneapolis?",
        "Lily: To see Liberty? Absolutely. You know, and in fact I could call my mother, and we could use her jet to fly up there today and come back this afternoon.",
        "Parker: You'd do that?",
        "Lily: Sure. I could call her right now.",
        "Parker: You'd want to go?",
        "Faith: What, I'm too toxic to visit her?",
        "Parker: Where did you get that?",
        "Faith: I didn't exactly have the greatest day at school today, you know?",
        "Parker: Well, you know, not everything is about you, Faith.",
        "Faith: I didn't mean it like that. Is she losing hair and stuff?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Yeah, she is.",
        "Faith: Well, you know, I bet she needs a girlfriend more than a boy friend right now.",
        "Parker: There's something you should know.",
        "Faith: What?",
        "Parker: She's in an isolation bubble, which means you can't touch her. It's so that outside germs don't get in.",
        "Lily: Faith's right. Sounds like Liberty could use a girlfriend.",
        "Faith: Is that why you're letting me go -- to show me how lucky I am, to show me what it's like to have real problems?",
        "Lily: As a matter of fact, yes. You in?",
        "Parker: Yes. Yes, completely. Thank you.",
        "Lily: Excellent. I'll call my mother right now, have her file a flight plan to Minneapolis.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rocco: My daughter's cattin' around, just the way she did 20 years ago.",
        "Dusty: You better shut your mouth now.",
        "Rocco: Except now, she covers it up better. She pretends to be the loyal wife and mother, but she spends all her time hanging around with the likes of you, doing God knows what.",
        "Dusty: You get satisfaction out of making your daughter hate you?",
        "Rocco: She's --",
        "Dusty: Say it! She's what?! You're drunk.",
        "Rocco: Get your hands off of me.",
        "Dusty: Get out of here before she sees you.",
        "Rocco: I'm her father! I have rights!",
        "Dusty: You lost those rights a long time ago, Rocco.",
        "Rocco: What is this place anyway? Your love nest?",
        "Dusty: I understand you're still hooked up with Ralph Manzo. You thought I wouldn't find out?",
        "Rocco: I don't know what you think you heard.",
        "Dusty: It's so interesting how a mom-and-pop operation hardware store can stay alive these days.",
        "Rocco: We got lucky. We have loyal --",
        "Dusty: You got Ralph Manzo greasing your palm, so he can use your store for shenanigans. Isn't that right?",
        "Rocco: You think I'm scared of you or something?",
        "Dusty: I could call Jack, put you in a cell right next to Ralphie.",
        "Rocco: You're gonna be sorry you're talking to me this way.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry I brought you back into Janet's life. Other than that, I'm regret-free. Get out of here. Hey, is it as good as you remembered it?",
        "Janet: Oh, I love you! I love this house! I feel so lucky!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Mary, Clive, it's so good of you to come. Obviously, you're the first ones here. And this is a perfect opportunity for you to meet my amazing partner and Monte Carlo's designer, Carly Tenney. Carly, this is Mary and Clive Diedrickson of --",
        "Carly: Archaeology. Oh, I love your store. I'd be so honored to have our designs there.",
        "Mary: Well, if that dress is any indication of the line --",
        "Craig: Oh, this is just a start.",
        "Clive: Well, then, we are buying.",
        "Craig: Wonderful! That is wonderful. Please, help yourself something to eat and drink. And I'll be starting a tour of the warehouse and the factory in just a little bit, so don't go far. Amazing. All you have to do is walk through the door and you blow them away.",
        "Carly: Oh, with everything that's going on at home with Jack and Janet and the baby, it is nice to be appreciated.",
        "Craig: You are. And I am so --",
        "Carly: I can't believe you made it!",
        "Jack: Had the siren on the whole way.",
        "Teri: You are all set. My staff's all ready to go.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Teri: Oh, hey, I found this in the back. I'm assuming it's for you.",
        "Craig: Oh. Who knows? Maybe it's a silent offer from one of the retailers already.",
        "Teri: Let's hope.",
        "Craig: \"Nice party. Enjoy it while you can.\"",
        "Jack: With the risk of redundancy, you look sensational.",
        "Carly: Some redundancies are worth it. Come on. Let me show you off.",
        "Jack: Like you need arm candy.",
        "Carly: You are gonna charm this dress right off me if you keep that up.",
        "Jack: Not now, but maybe, definitely later. Hi, Jack Snyder. I am the bodyguard of this -- dress.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Carly: How was Janet's exam?",
        "Jack: She was given the all-clear.",
        "Carly: I'm glad.",
        "Jack: Me, too.",
        "Carly: 'Cause if she hadn't been, you wouldn't be here.",

        "Jack: Craig.",
        "Craig: Nice suit. I need to speak to you privately.",
        "Carly: Whatever it is, you can tell me here.",
        "Craig: It won't take but a moment. Excuse us.",
        "Carly: What is the matter with you?",
        "Craig: Do you believe this?",
        "Carly: I don't -- I don't know. Is there any reason that I should?",
        "Craig: Who would do this?",
        "Carly: Any one of our competitors who's feeling a little jealous?",
        "Craig: What do they want from me?",
        "Carly: Oh, come on, Craig. Don't be so naive. You're being punked. Just go with it.",
        "Craig: Unless they know --",
        "Carly: Know what?",
        "Craig: What -- what you just said, that someone knows we're gonna be a huge success, and they're jealous.",
        "Carly: You see?",
        "Craig: You're right. You don't need to bother Jack with this.",
        "Carly: Don't worry. I won't.",
        "Craig: Yeah, speaking of Jack, he's not a buyer, so mingle. Mingle.",

        "Parker: How did your mom find out about the pills?",
        "Faith: She told you about that? Great. Luke was the one that told her, so he saved you the trouble of turning me in twice.",
        "Parker: If you're looking for an apology, you're not gonna get one.",
        "Faith: No kidding.",
        "Parker: You did this to yourself, Faith. No one forced you to smoke pot or take pills.",
        "Faith: Oh, please. You're worse than my mother.",
        "Parker: You just don't get, do you? You're in the middle of a cancer ward, and, yet, you still think that your problems are bigger than everybody else's.",
        "Faith: Look, I get the big life lesson you and my mom are trying to teach me, okay? So let it go.",
        "Parker: Liberty's not a life lesson. She's in there fighting for her life, and you're out here pouting because some cheerleaders didn't want to have lunch with you today.",
        "Lily: All right. I found the duty nurse. She said two can go in at a time. So why don't you two go in first?",
        "Parker: Great. You coming? Brought a friend.",

        "Teri: Oh, please. The man of your life buys you a new home and it's no big deal?",
        "Janet: Well -- okay! Wait till you see it! Okay, here we go. Let me get them. Okay, look. That's the front. Isn't that adorable? Look at the white around the windows. And there's the side, and there's the backyard. Look at the backyard. It's huge.",
        "Teri: Do you know what I like the most?",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Teri: Seeing you so happy. It's been a long time, Sister.",
        "Janet: Oh, I know. I know that. Look, I know Liberty has a long road ahead of her, but I was telling Dusty that I feel hopeful for the first time in so long. That man has been an amazing surprise to me.",
        "Teri: Me, too.",
        "Janet: Okay, so Liberty's gonna get better, and then we're gonna move into the house, and then I'm gonna have the baby.",
        "Teri: You have so much to look forward to.",
        "Janet: I know. And now Pop is back in my life, too. It's almost too much, right?",
        "Teri: Yeah. Maybe it is.",

        "Crowe: Actually, yeah. So, what do you think?",
        "Dusty: Put the gun down, man. Didn't anyone tell you it's not nice to threaten people?",
        "Crowe: Actually, yeah.",
        "Dusty: So who sent you? Who thinks I'm a threat?",
        "Crowe: The man's just looking out for his kid.",
        "Dusty: [Scoffs] So it's Rocco.",
        "Crowe: Never mind the whos, all right? You got the message?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah. You tell Mr. Ciccone I'm cool. I don't want any problems.",

        "Teri: Stop what?",
        "Janet: Avoiding my question.",
        "Teri: I'm not.",
        "Janet: Yes, you are! Everything was great until I brought up Pop, and then, all of the sudden, things got weird.",
        "Teri: Nothing got weird.",
        "Janet: What's going on?",
        "Teri: Nothing, I swear.",
        "Janet: Are you upset that Pop and I are trying to work things out?",
        "Teri: No. Why would you even think that?",
        "Janet: Well, 'cause you're obviously his favorite.",
        "Janet: No, I'm not.",
        "Janet: Yes, you are. You're his little piccolina.",
        "Teri: Oh, my God. That nickname is gonna haunt me till the day I die.",
        "Janet: Just listen. Pop's trying to reach out. And -- and I just want to make sure you're okay with that.",
        "Teri: Oh, you think I'm jealous?",
        "Janet: Are you? Because if you are, that's totally fine. I understand.",
        "Teri: Jan, you are way off base here, I swear.",

        "Teri: You know, and if that's true, that's great, really. I just don't want you to get your hopes up.",
        "Janet: Why? You don't think he's sincere?",
        "Teri: I just don't think you should expect too much.",
        "Janet: I haven't expected anything from that man in years, and that's exactly what I got.",
        "Teri: He's just so set in his ways. You know, you saw him. You remember how he was. He's -- he's not changed at all.",
        "Janet: Yes, he has changed! That's the whole point! He has never once before reached out to me. He has never tried to find me. And now here he is, telling me that he wants to be a part of my life. And I -- I really think I want that, too.",
        "Teri: Are you sure?",
        "Janet: Yes. Listen, the last time Pop saw me, I was this scared, unwed teenager. Okay, granted, now I'm a scared, pregnant, divorced lady. But anyway, that's not the point. The point is, I feel like I have done something with my life. I feel good about myself, and I feel like that Pop, he really has something to be proud of in me.",
        "Teri: Sorry, Jan, you can't fix the past.",
        "Janet: I know I can't.",
        "Teri: Look, it shouldn't matter anymore anyway, because you're amazing. You're an amazing woman, an amazing sister, an amazing mom, and no one can ever take that away from you.",
        "Janet: You're just saying that 'cause you're my baby sister.",
        "Teri: No. I'm saying that because it's true. Look what you have to look forward to, this new life with Dusty and Liberty and this baby that's on the way. That's all you should be focusing on right now. Do you know what I'm saying?",
        "Janet: Yes.",

        "Craig: \"Okay\" what? Do you think someone knows that I've been siphoning money out of Parker's trust?",

        "Craig: Yeah, drink. That's exactly what I need. Two bourbons, doubles.",
        "Carly: That went really, really well.",
        "Jack: It sure seemed to.",
        "Carly: I got so many orders. Wait till I show Craig, who, for some reason, mysteriously disappeared in the middle of our party.",

        "Parker: Okay, so, this is what I was thinking for when you get out of here -- we drive across the country.",
        "Liberty: Cross-country?",
        "Parker: Yes, and we fly to New York first so we get the full effect, and we start from there.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Parker: So New York to L.A. and everything in between. Grand Canyon, Graceland, Dollywood.",
        "Liberty: Dollywood?",
        "Parker: Yeah, and Mt. Rushmore, Badlands, um, Bryce Canyon, Santa Fe, New Orleans.",
        "Liberty: But not in that order, obviously.",
        "Parker: In whatever order we want, for as long as we want.",
        "Liberty: You really think we can do this?",

        "Liberty: Naturally.",
        "Parker: We're gonna see things that I can't even find posters of to hang up on the wall. Does that sound good to you so far? What is it, Liberty?",
        "Liberty: Will you promise me something?",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "Liberty: If I don't get better and we can't do this together, you'll go anyway.",
        "Parker: No. No, I don't have to promise you that.",
        "Liberty: Parker --",
        "Parker: No. I'm gonna go on this trip with you, okay? And you can give me your speech about how I need to face reality and not just tell you what you need to hear. But this is our trip, and we're gonna go on it together, okay?",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Parker: Well, now that that's settled, the real question is when we get to Las Vegas, are we gonna go on the fake gondola ride or not?",
        "Lily: How are you feeling?",
        "Faith: How do you think?",
        "Lily: Faith, I brought you here so that you could get some perspective on your life, all the gifts that you have.",
        "Faith: I get it, okay?",
        "Lily: Well, maybe I needed to get a little more, too. I am so blessed to have healthy children. I'm so lucky. And I want you to feel that way, too.",
        "Faith: Liberty's lucky to have someone love her like Parker does.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, thanks for not letting me drink alone, and for not letting me get hung up on the idea that somebody's tailing me. I guess I'd better call Carly, smooth her feathers for leaving the party early. Talk to you later.",

        "Carly: I like you every day.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but today more than usual.",
        "Carly: Well, today, you did what you needed to do, and then you took care of me. And I know how tired you were.",

        "Teri: Hey. How are you guys?",
        "Jack: A serious home run with the catering at the Monte Carlo party.",

        "Teri: Well, head on over. We're open.",
        "Jack: What about the private party?",
        "Teri: The what?",
        "Carly: Well, we went there, and the place was empty. We figured there was a party or something.",
        "Teri: No, no. We're open. Maybe you guys were just a little early. I have the night off because of the party today, so --",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Teri: Yeah. So, the sous chef is excellent. Um, it's his kitchen tonight. Just let him know that I sent you guys.",

        "Carly: A bad feeling?",
        "Jack: Kind of.",
        "Carly: Well, no bad vibes on our dinner date. We're going to the Black Duck.",

        "Carly: Could it be okay? Do I really get a happy ending?",
        "Jack: Are you sure you're okay with this?",
        "Carly: Yes. Jack, you go in there, you put your cop brain at ease, and then we'll get something to eat, okay?",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: And, you know, it will be good practice for me.",
        "Jack: What -- what will be?",
        "Carly: Well, if I'm gonna be a cop's wife again, I'll have to get used to all your quirks.",
        "Jack: Now my sixth sense is a quirk?",
        "Carly: Well, just go in. You give the place the all-clear. I'm starving. I want to eat, okay? This is weird, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I don't like it.",
        "Carly: Do you think maybe Teri got the schedule confused?",
