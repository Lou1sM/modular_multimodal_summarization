        "Emily wants to get married right then and there, but Paul tries to stall. Finally, when Paul sees this is the only way to convince Emily he still loves her, he gets on bended knee and asks her to marry him again that very day. Will and Gwen prepare to leave Hal's, thanks to Will's piggy bank fund and his feeling if they don't get out now they will be torn apart by his family's manipulations. Gwen doesn't seem so keen on the idea, which doesn't go unnoticed by him. They talk some more and Will changes his mind because he wants to make Gwen happy. Gwen is happy to not have to scrape together, work full time and go to school all at the same time. She runs off to the library to get some textbooks for them to play catch up with. At the library she and Maddie talk about each other's romantic relationships. Gwen tells her they decided to stay at Hal's because it is the best idea for them both, but Will tells Bob he did it only for Gwen. Meg warns Henry about Emily, but he wonders about her considering she was the one with Dusty's bloody wallet in her possession. Meg threatens that he is going to get caught in the cross fire if he stays close to Emily because she has a one track mind regarding Paul and revenge. They are interrupted by Emily calling Henry to the police station because she and Paul are going to be married. Nick and Katie beg Hal to put out an APB on Chardonnay but won't do that. He promises to put a few men on the case and run this by the new lead detective on the case \u0096 Jack. When Nick hears this, he is convinced that he is sunk. Carly comes home to find Jack with Chardonnay. Jack demands that Chardonnay tell him the whole story about how she and Carly are connected. Carly's world starts to crumble as Jack hears the whole sordid tale and he realizes the depths of Carly manipulations and lies. He tells her and Chardonnay that they are going to the station to make a statement and Carly is going to tell Nick the sick story of what she did to his face. Jack seems to no longer hold much value in Carly and his marriage at the end of this conversation. Henry becomes Emily's witness when Susan refuses to support Emily's jailhouse wedding. At first Hal tires to stop Emily and Paul's wedding, secretly to Paul's relief, but soon becomes so fed up with her, that he tells her he plans on witnessing the beginning of the train wreck which is to become her life now.

        "Gwen: What do you have there? You want to tell me that you're stealing from your dad now.",
        "Will: I'm not taking anything that's not mine. I found this in an old piggy bank I had when I was a kid.",
        "Gwen: You really do put money in those things?",
        "Will: Yeah, I received every cent I ever got, and thinking that some day it might come in handy, and, look it has.",
        "Gwen: I'd say, at least a couple hundred buck bucks.",
        "Will: It's 314.78. It's enough for, you know, a couple nights in a hotel, and maybe some dinner. So we don't have to spend one more night here.",
        "Gwen: Great.",
        "Will: Come on. I thought you were okay with us leaving.",
        "Gwen: I am, if that's what you really want.",
        "Will: You know it's what I really want. Out from under my dad's thumb is good for everybody involved.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Will: Come on just imagine, you know, falling asleep in some place with some real privacy, we'd really be able to figure out our next move from there.",
        "Gwen: I'm going to go up and pack up our bag bags.",
        "Will: Wait, you know this is the right thing, right? Whatever my dad promises it's going to come with a price tag and fine print. Trust me, I know from experience.",
        "Gwen: I can't argue with experience.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Meg remembering]",
        "Paul: I told her that I should never have turned my back on her, and then I told her that you'd sold me out. You were turning state's evidence.",
        "Meg: Why would you tell her all this?",
        "Paul: I'm hoping she'll tell me what she did to Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hello, Henry.",
        "Henry: Meg. Don't let me keep you. I'm sure there are some other places you'd rather be.",
        "Meg: I could say the same about you.",
        "Henry: Are you looking for someone?",
        "Meg: Your other half. Where's Emily?",
        "Henry: She's upstairs planting more evidence in your room. This time we are going to try to frame you for the canyon river murders. I think eventually something is going to stick.",
        "Meg: Don't count on it.",
        "Henry: I don't count on anything.",
        "Meg: Why are you so committed to her?",
        "Henry: Who says I am?",
        "Meg: Every step you've taken in the last month kind of tells me she's got you on a short leash.",
        "Henry: On a leash? Looks can be deceiving.",
        "Meg: Come on, Henry, you're a smart guy. Why are you letting her drag you down?",
        "Henry: Meg, it looks like we're bosom buddies, but we're not. We're far from it.",
        "Meg: She's got something on you. That's why you are doing her dirty work, isn't it?",
        "Henry: Maybe I just have a burning desire to see justice served.",
        "Meg: Yeah, right. You're only burning desire is to make it on the cocktail hour.",
        "Henry: Speaking of which, it's almost time.",
        "Meg: You're backing the wrong horse, Henry. And she is out for revenge. She wants to hurt Paul for abandoning on her, but she's going to crash. Take my advice and get out of the car while you still can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're serious, aren't you?",
        "Emily: About us getting married? Yes. Are you?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter what I think.",
        "Emily: Of course it matters.",
        "Paul: No. Look, I don't deserve a second chance with you, Emily. I didn't deserve a first chance.",
        "Emily: You asked me if I believed in you, and I'm telling you that I do. Maybe more than I should. Prove to me that I'm not wrong to feel that way.",
        "Paul: How am I going to do that? I'm in jail, Emily, I'm not getting jail anytime soon. I'm not going to let you throw your life away on a guy that has no future.",
        "Emily: That's my choice.",
        "Paul: Okay. But -- look, even if we do get married, I'm not going to let it happen like this, okay? Not some hurried ceremony, in my very, very cold jail cell.",
        "Emily: Yeah, it sounds to me like you're thinking of reasons why you shouldn't marry me.",
        "Paul: No, it's not that. It's just that I -- look, the last time, when we almost got married, you know what happened, and I would like to try and make that up to you. And I think that the next time you get married, you deserve for it to be everything that you ever wanted.",
        "Emily: You think I don't care? I don't care if I get married in a cell with two cops as witnesses and a 20sty tie for a ring. I don't care. I want you to show me how sorry you are for everything that went wrong between us.",
        "Paul: I am. You have to believe that.",
        "Emily: Okay. Well, then, prove it. Let's have a fresh start. Marry me right now. Or we walk away from each other for good. It's your call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Her real name is Sylvia Turnblat, and she worked at the Galaxy, both as a waitress and a stripper, and I'm telling you how I almost had her.",
        "Hal: But she gave you the slip.",
        "Nick: Yeah, but she knows how I was set up, and that's why I need to get her before she skips town.",
        "Hal: You're asking me to tie up major man power on something that I'm not sure I believe. Besides I'm not taking the word of some bimbo named Chardonnay, and it's not going to rid you of the charges against you, Nick, you ought to know that.",
        "Nick: But you could bring us Anatoly Hal. Lieutenant, you know I don't handle things by the book, and I've got an attitude that needs some fine-tuning.",
        "Hal: You think?",
        "Nick: I'm not dirty. All right? I would never cross that line.",
        "Hal: I want to believe that, Nick.",
        "Nick: This was a setup. It was pure and simple. Chardonnay's the key. Just put out an APB on her.",
        "Hal: I'm not going to do that, what I will do is send out a couple of guys to see if they can track her down.",
        "Nick: That's not good enough.",
        "Hal: It's the best you're going to get.",
        "Katie: Please, Hal, Nick's entire future is on the line here. He's a good cop, not the kind that would get messed up in drugs and Chardonnay can tell us who made it look like he was. And she's scared, and if you give her enough time to run, she's going to be gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, what's going on here?",
        "Jack: What do you think?",
        "Carly: I don't really know.",
        "Jack: Do you know who this woman is?",
        "Carly: Uh-huh. Yeah. She calls herself Chardonnay. We worked together at the Galaxy Club. What are you doing in my home?",
        "Jack: I brought her here.",
        "Carly: Why would earth would you do that?",
        "Chardonnay: Let me give this back. It's not going to do me much good anymore.",
        "Carly: What are you doing with my necklace?",
        "Jack: Stop it! No more, Carly, I know you gave her the necklace to get her out of town.",
        "Carly: Why would I do that, Jack? What kind of lies has this woman been feeding you?",
        "Jack: I said no more. I'm tired of the excuses. More than anything else, I'm tired of the lies. Time for the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: If this is really what you want, then yes, I'll marry you. Right here, right now.",
        "Emily: Do you mean that?",
        "Paul: Of course I do.",
        "Emily: It's the only thing I ever wanted, from the minute I fell in love with you.",
        "Paul: Are you sure you can arrange for a ceremony? I mean, these aren't exactly normal circumstances.",
        "Emily: I know, but I've already checked into it. It's absolutely doable.",
        "Paul: Great. Great. I'll make you the wife of a convict. I just hope you're not doing something you're going to regret.",
        "Emily: I will never regret this, Paul. And neither will you, because as your wife, I'll be able to work harder with the lawyers to try and get you out of this place.",
        "Paul: Out of this place would be good.",
        "Emily: Maybe you've already considered that possibility.",
        "Paul: I'm not trying to trick you, if that's what you're thinking.",
        "Emily: I just need a little extra reassurance. That you're not doing this for selfish reasons.",
        "Paul: You think I'm selfish?",
        "Emily: Because you know that even if we get married, there's no guarantee I can get you out of here.",
        "Paul: There are no guarantees of anything, I know that. I have this on my side, I am innocent.",
        "Emily: But you confessed.",
        "Paul: I didn't kill Dusty. It was a mistake. I don't know how you would want to marry a guy that wants so many dumb mistakes.",
        "Emily: But as long as usual heart is the wrong place.",
        "Paul: I'd be an idiot to try to fool you again.",
        "Emily: Yes, you would.",
        "Paul: I've learned my lesson. And I've realized the only person I can really count on is you. You can count on me to love you. Now and always. I promise. I hope that's enough.",
        "Emily: It's beyond my wildest dreams.",
        "Paul: Then the rest will take care of itself.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I hope so.",
        "Paul: Have faith. My love, have faith. Okay if we're going to do this, we're going to do it right. Give me your hand. Emily Stewart, will you marry me? Today? Right here, in this jail cell?",
        "Emily: Yes, Paul. I will. Yes, I will marry you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What say you worry about your own problems, Meg, and let me worry about mine? Emily being the least of them.",
        "Meg: If you don't see how dangerous and unstable Emily is, you're blind.",
        "Henry: Dangerous? Unstable? That's hilarious, coming from a woman who killed Dusty Donovan and kept her bloody gloves and her bag as a souvenir.",
        "Meg: They couldn't hold me, remember? The evidence was tainted.",
        "Henry: Oh, please. You think your lawyer's lame claim that we planted something that would stop Hal Munson from finding out the truth. You bought yourself some time, sweetheart, not an acquittal.",
        "Meg: When the dust clears, I'll still be standing. And you're going to be sorry you didn't take my advice and get as far away from Emily Stewart as you can.",
        "Henry: Don't worry, I plan to, as soon as I tie up some loose ends.",
        "Meg: What loose ends might those be?",
        "Henry: Aren't you dying to know? [Cell phone rings] Excuse me, I have to have a real conversation now.",
        "Emily: Hello, Henry.",
        "Henry: Whatever it is, I don't have the time. Or the inclination.",
        "Emily: You know what, that's too bad. This is important. Get down to the jail immediately.",
        "Henry: Good grief, what have you done now?",
        "Emily: Don't worry, I haven't turned you in. At least, not yet.",
        "Henry: So, what are you doing in jail?",
        "Emily: Getting married.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Emily: There's no time to talk, okay? On the way over, stop at Neumann's jewelers and pick up a couple of wedding bands. Our sizes are on file.",
        "Henry: For you and whom? Please don't tell me you're doing what I think you're doing. Please, please, please.",
        "Emily: Just do what I'm asking. There isn't much time.",
        "Henry: I'd love to stay and chat, but luckily, I have to go.",
        "Meg: Where?",
        "Henry: To have my head examined!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Katie, I know Nick is Mike's cousin and you want to look out for him, but this is a lot more complicated --",
        "Katie: It isn't about Mike. It's about doing the right thing. Nick's job meant everything to him. The only way he has a prayer of getting it back is to catch the people who did this to him. Now, we can't find this Chardonnay person on our own. We just don't have the resources. But you do.",
        "Hal: You want me to pull men off other cases just so we can find some mystery woman who's supposed to clear Nick's name.",
        "Katie: He's been wrongly accused! He was set up. It's not fair, please, you know he's innocent. Deep down, you've got to know it.",
        "Hal: All right, I'll tell you what I'll do. Let me run this by the lead officer on the case. Whatever he decides, that's how we'll play it.",
        "Nick: Who's heading up the investigation?",
        "Hal: Jack Snyder.",
        "Nick: There goes the ballgame.",
        "Katie: Don't say that.",
        "Nick: Why? Nothing would make Jack's day more than hanging me out to dry.",
        "Katie: You can't give up yet. Okay? Maybe he'll surprise you.",
        "Nick: Get real, Katie, it's over. I don't have a chance in hell.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, Jack. I don't know what garbage Chardonnay has been handing you so I really don't know what you expect me to say.",
        "Jack: Actually, I don't want you to say anything at the moment. First, I want you to listen. Okay. Tell me everything, from the beginning, about your involvement with my wife. And with Nick Kasnoff.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: I got to take this. I don't want you to say anything until I'm there to hear it. Snyder.",
        "Hal: Jack, its Hal.",
        "Jack: Hey. What's up?",
        "Hal: I just had an interesting visit from Nick and Katie. They're asking me to put an APB out for that waitress from the Galaxy. The one who went by the name of Chardonnay.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know who she is.",
        "Hal: Nick's claiming she was part of a setup to bring him down. And that it all ties back to Anatoly. What do you make of that?",
        "Jack: Interesting. Dammit, Carly, not a word! I'm in the middle of something that might be connected. Let me get back to you.",
        "Hal: Okay. But try to make it fast. Because if there is anything to this, we need to move on it.",
        "Jack: I understand. Okay. Go ahead. Start talking.",
        "Carly: Jack, you can't seriously expect to believe anything this woman tells you. Do you?",
        "Jack: Don't interrupt again.",
        "Chardonnay: I'm not sure where to begin.",
        "Jack: Let's start with the necklace. Why do you have it?",
        "Chardonnay: Carly gave it to me.",
        "Carly: I did not!",
        "Jack: Carly!",
        "Chardonnay: I came here to get cash, so I could get out of town. She only had fifty bucks on her, so she gave me the necklace to pawn.",
        "Jack: Why'd you have to get out of town?",
        "Chardonnay: I was scared. Anatoly's after me. He's going to hunt me down and hurt me.",
        "Jack: Well, why did you expect Carly to help you out?",
        "Carly: Jack, please.",
        "Jack: Carly! Do not say another word.",
        "Chardonnay: Carly and I had a deal that sort of went wrong.",
        "Jack: What kind of deal?",
        "Chardonnay: She wanted me to set Nick Kasnoff up.",
        "Jack: Set him up? You mean, by planting drugs on him?",
        "Chardonnay: No, no! That wasn't Carly's idea.",
        "Carly: You're damned right it wasn't!",
        "Chardonnay: It was Anatoly's, once he found out Nick was a cop.",
        "Jack: Then what was Carly's plan?",
        "Chardonnay: To get Nick to a hotel room and get some photos of him in bed with me.",
        "Jack: How did you get Nick to the hotel?",
        "Chardonnay: Carly sent him a note asking him to meet her there. But I showed up instead. I had on a blonde wig, and he was supposed to think I was her. She spiked the champagne so he'd be blitzed enough to buy it. All I had to do was get him in bed and there was a hidden camera to do the rest.",
        "Jack: And all that was Carly's idea.",
        "Chardonnay: Yeah. Yeah. It was.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: We should fill the bird feeder before we go. It's so beautiful out, spring's finally showing up. But no birds.",
        "Will: My mom was always the one who filled the feeder. I bet my dad never even remembers.",
        "Gwen: That's a shame. Do you think he keeps any birdseed?",
        "Will: I don't know. Hold on. If he does, it's probably over here. Yep. All right, let's go.",
        "Gwen: Thanks.",
        "Will: That should bring 'em back in droves. Or flocks. Or whatever you call it.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Too bad we won't be here when they come.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: We should leave a note for your dad to remember to keep this filled.",
        "Will: He'll probably need more than a note.",
        "Gwen: Poor birds.",
        "Will: How about you call him every few weeks to remind him.",
        "Gwen: I might just do that. That should kind of do it. I guess we're ready to go.",
        "Will: You are just doing this for me, aren't you?",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: Agreeing to leave.",
        "Gwen: We promised we'd be in this together, you know, all the way.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know we did.",
        "Gwen: And I don't ever want to see you like you were yesterday when you found out I took your dad's offer without asking you.",
        "Will: Yeah, about that, I wasn't mad at you. I was mad at my dad for using you to try and control me.",
        "Gwen: I really don't think his reasons were that selfish. But, whatever, I just don't want to see you that upset. At me or at anybody. Ever.",
        "Will: Believe me, I don't like feeling that way.",
        "Gwen: I love you. And I trust you. And if you really think that leaving here is the best thing for us, then I'm not going to fight it.",
        "Will: That's different from believing that it's right. So, I don't think I can do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Minister: I was very surprised to get your call, Emily. You have to admit, this is highly unusual.",
        "Emily: Well, what's life without a little controversy, right, Rev?",
        "Minister: Are you certain this is what you want?",
        "Emily: I've never been more certain about anything in my entire life.",
        "Minister: And you, Paul? You've been charged with a serious crime. If convicted, you'll be spending a long time behind bars. Is this really the best thing for Emily?",
        "Paul: I don't know, ask Emily.",
        "Emily: I know what I'm getting into.",
        "Minister: I'm asking you, Paul.",
        "Paul: I want to make Emily happy. She insists this is the way to do that.",
        "Emily: It is. It absolutely is. Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me. If you don't mind.",
        "Minister: It would be cruel and wrong to disappoint Emily again.",
        "Paul: I don't ever plan to disappoint anybody.",
        "Emily: Good, Lord, could you have got an cheaper set of rings, Henry?",
        "Henry: Hey, thanks to you, I'm broke, remember? You're still holding my modest fortune hostage. Besides, how was I to know for sure this was even legit? Last I heard, you were pretty damned suspicious of Paul's sudden change of heart.",
        "Emily: That was then. This is now.",
        "Henry: Spare me the country-western wisdom. As far as I'm concerned, you're plumb loco, honey. Paul pops the question through cell bars and suddenly you're ready to forgive all and trust the guy? Did you check your brain with the desk sergeant?",
        "Emily: I know what I'm doing, Henry.",
        "Henry: I certainly hope so.",
        "Emily: Here.",
        "Susan: Emily!",
        "Emily: Oh, hi.",
        "Susan: That was a very strange message you left me. What has Paul dragged you into this time?",
        "Emily: A wedding ceremony, that's what.",
        "Susan: You've got to be kidding me!",
        "Emily: No. I'm not kidding. We're getting married right now.",
        "Susan: That's not possible. He's in jail.",
        "Emily: It's totally possible. I looked into it, it's perfectly legal.",
        "Susan: Legal or not, it doesn't make it right.",
        "Emily: Can you, for once, be happy for me?",
        "Susan: No. I can't. Not for this!",
        "Emily: Well, fine, be that way, but there's nothing you can do to stop me.",
        "Susan: No? We'll see about that!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why would you think Nick would agree to meet you in a hotel room? And don't waste my time denying anything at this point.",
        "Carly: It was a long shot.",
        "Jack: A long shot. Is that true?",
        "Chardonnay: Nick was hot for her. There was no doubt about it. I could tell by the way he was always looking at her at the club.",
        "Jack: And you told her?",
        "Chardonnay: Yeah. We got friendly and even after Nick got her fired, we kept in touch.",
        "Jack: Is that a fact? I guess you'd been planning this for some time, huh? Okay. So let's review. You convinced Chardonnay to pretend to be you, so you could pictures of Nick in bed, with what looked like a prostitute? And the idea was to get him fired so I could get my job back.",
        "Carly: I had nothing to do with planting the heroin on him. I swear.",
        "Chardonnay: She's right about that. When Anatoly found out Kasnoff was a cop, he went crazy. He wanted to make Nick pay.",
        "Jack: But none of that could've happened if you and Carly hadn't set things in motion. Right?",
        "Chardonnay: That's true. I'm sorry, honey. I really am.",
        "Carly: So am I.",
        "Chardonnay: Can I get a little bathroom break, here?",
        "Jack: Fine. It's at the end of the hall. There are no windows, so don't get any ideas.",
        "Chardonnay: Where am I going to run to, anyway?",
        "Carly: Can I talk now?",
        "Jack: Do you really think there's anything you could say that'd make a difference?",
        "Carly: Probably not. You know the truth. What are you going to do with it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns.\"",
        "Nick: Chardonnay?",
        "Jack: Carly wants to tell you something.",
        "Emily: This has nothing to do with you, so stay out of it.",
        "Hal: It does when it's in my jail, and I won't allow it, not on my watch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: It just-- it feels wrong to be forcing you into something you really don't want to do.",
        "Gwen: But I just said, I trust you. If you think this is the way to go --",
        "Will: I know. That's no way to a marriage. We should be doing what we both think is right. I went off on you earlier, and i pressured you to change your mind. That's not fair.",
        "Gwen: You made a lot of good points. And you know your parents better than I do.",
        "Will: But you can be more objective than I can. Maybe you see things that I don't want to see.",
        "Gwen: Like what?",
        "Will: You said we probably won't graduate unless we stay here. I mean, if we have to work to pay for rent and school, when are we going to focus on studying and catching up? Which is what you really want, isn't it?",
        "Gwen: The graduating part? Or the staying here part?",
        "Will: Both.",
        "Gwen: I want us to graduate, Will. Because then we can do anything. Be anything. Man, I sound like bad top forty.",
        "Will: No, you don't. You sound like somebody who has given this a lot of thought. And I'm the guy who isn't giving you credit for that.",
        "Gwen: Why don't you tell me what you really mean?",
        "Will: Okay. I've changed my mind. I think we should take my dad's offer. We'll stay here, let him support us, and bust our butts to catch up at school so we can graduate in June.",
        "Gwen: Are you sure?",
        "Will: Yeah, it's going to be hard. No, it's going to be hell. But it's harder for me to see you do something you hate just I told you to do it.",
        "Gwen: You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that. And you'll see. It's going to work out for both of us. Okay?",
        "Will: Where are you going?",
        "Gwen: I'm going to hit the library, grab every textbook I can. We've got to start this catching up thing, right?",
        "Will: You know, just seeing you smile like that makes it all worth it.",
        "Gwen: I love you. You're not going to regret this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: there are so many things I want to say for you right now, but this isn't the time or the place. For once, this isn't about you, Carly, or even me.",
        "Carly: So what are you going to do?",
        "Jack: Try to right a wrong, if I'm not too late. Chardonnay, let's go!",
        "Carly: Jack, if you'll just let me --",
        "Jack: What, explain? I'm sure you got a couple good ideas. No one's better at it than you, right? I'm not interested in any more of your justifications for what you did to Nick or for what you did to me.",
        "Chardonnay: Okay. Now what?",
        "Jack: Let's go to the police station and you are going to give them your statement. Tell them everything that you just told me. What you did, who you were with, who helped you out. Anatoly, his men, Carly. Especially Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard: Holding.",
        "Meg: It's Meg Snyder. I need to speak with Paul Ryan.",
        "Guard: He's unavailable.",
        "Meg: But I have to talk to him immediately. Where is he?",
        "Guard: About to make the biggest mistake of his life.",
        "Paul: Just talk to me about this.",
        "Emily: If usual mother is not too thrilled about this. It's okay. She can't stop us if this is what we both want.",
        "Minister: Is Dr. Stewart still going to be a witness?",
        "Emily: I thought I'd be able to convince her, but I guess I -- my mother has never been there for me when I needed her the most.",
        "Minister: You have to have witnesses, Emily.",
        "Emily: I know. Henry, Henry. He'll do, won't me? Henry.",
        "Paul: I think we need two, dear. Maybe we need to wait a couple of days, and get things a little more organized.",
        "Emily: No! We're doing this now! Today! You, he can be the witness, right?",
        "Guard: I -- well, yes, I suppose.",
        "Emily: Great. Then let's get started.",
        "Susan: Emily, please, don't go through with this. What kind of life are you setting up for yourself?",
        "Emily: Mom, you can stay and support me, your daughter. Or you can get out now.",
        "Susan: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Paul: So, you will be a witness?",
        "Hal: What the hell is going on in here?",
        "Emily: Did you call him?",
        "Hal: You are not serious about marrying these people.",
        "Emily: Stay out of this, Hal. It's got nothing to do with you.",
        "Hal: It does while it's in my jail. And I won't allow it, not on my watch!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So, what do you think? Is this enough to get us back on track?",
        "Maddie: I think they'll get you about halfway to the finish line.",
        "Gwen: You don't think we're crazy, do you, trying to catch up by finals?",
        "Maddie: I think you're out of your freaking minds! Sorry. But that doesn't mean you won't make it.",
        "Gwen: Really?",
        "Maddie: Hey, if anybody can pull this off, it's you and Will. I've never met two more determined people in my life.",
        "Gwen: Determined? You know, half an hour ago, we were cleaning out his piggy bank so we could stay in a cheap hotel room. He doesn't want to stay at his dad's. He wanted us to work so we could get an apartment, but I convinced him we should graduate instead.",
        "Maddie: How'd you do that? Threaten no sex for a year?",
        "Gwen: No! No, I didn't, no. We just talked it out. He saw the logic of letting his dad help us.",
        "Maddie: He saw the logic of keeping you happy.",
        "Gwen: That, too. But it's not about me. It's about the two of us. We're a team. You know?",
        "Maddie: Uh-huh.",
        "Gwen: We both have to be 100% behind everything we do from now on.",
        "Maddie: And you're sure he really is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I think you've made an excellent decision, Will. You've got a roof over your head. You've got a stable environment. And a chance to get an education.",
        "Will: You make it sound like the army. Or prison.",
        "Bob: I know you think it's going to be tough, living with your dad.",
        "Will: He's going to be watching every move we make, with that silent cop stare of his. The one that freezes you in your tracks.",
        "Bob: You should be used to it by now.",
        "Will: Yeah, I just thought I'd finally gotten out from under it.",
        "Bob: This can't be easy for him, either. You told me he wasn't happy about your marrying Gwen. But he's swallowing his pride and his instincts and giving you a shot. That's a big move for a guy like Hal.",
        "Will: Maybe it'll all work out. I sure hope so.",
        "Bob: Well, I guess you won't need that janitorial job, after all.",
        "Will: Actually, I was thinking if it's a good idea, if I could keep up with my studies at school, I wouldn't mind making a few extra bucks on the side.",
        "Bob: Don't take on more than you can handle.",
        "Will: I won't push it.",
        "Bob: I'm not talking about time or energy, I'm talking about your outlook.",
        "Will: I'm trying to be optimistic.",
        "Bob: Trying's not going to cut it, Will. If you're not genuinely at peace with this new living arrangement, you need to pack your bags and go look for that cheap hotel room. Because it's never going to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: This is all perfectly legal, Hal. You can't stop us from getting married.",
        "Hal: But I can throw every last one of you out and lock Paul up in solitary confinement if I want to.",
        "Emily: I have come to my senses. I love Paul. I know that is hard for you to accept.",
        "Hal: How can you love a murderer, Emily?",
        "Emily: I don't believe he murdered anyone.",
        "Hal: He confessed!",
        "Emily: A lot can come out between now and his trial. I have faith.",
        "Hal: Emily, if you know something that you're not telling me about Dusty's murder --",
        "Emily: What I know is, I love Paul. And I believe he's innocent. I'm sorry. I know you hate this.",
        "Hal: No. What I hate is that you're willing to throw your life away on a man who doesn't deserve it.",
        "Emily: Well, I believe he does.",
        "Hal: Then don't let me stop you.",
        "Susan: Hal!",
        "Hal: I'm done protecting you, Emily. Go ahead. Throw it all away. Let your life go up in flames. I can handle it. Hell, I'll stand here and watch. What are you waiting for? You've got a wedding to perform!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: This is Nick.",
        "Jack: It's Jack. Where are you?",
        "Nick: At the station. Why?",
        "Jack: Stay put. I'll meet you in the interrogation room in fifteen minutes.",
        "Nick: What's this about, Jack?",
        "Jack: The truth. Ready?",
        "Chardonnay: No, but --",
        "Jack: You understand what you have to do, right? Full disclosure.",
        "Chardonnay: So, what's going to happen to me?",
        "Jack: Depends on how honest you are in your statement.",
        "Chardonnay: I'm not going to hold anything back.",
        "Jack: Good. Let's go.",
        "Carly: So, I guess I'll just wait for you here.",
        "Jack: No, not a chance in the world. You're coming, too.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Jack: Because you're going to be the one to tell Nick what happened. You're going to tell him the whole sick story.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Here I am, going on about me and I haven't even asked about you and Casey. Are you guys good?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, they're fine with Casey. They're just terrible with his mom and dad.",
        "Gwen: Why? What's the problem?",
        "Maddie: Mrs. Hughes thinks I'm a bad influence on her son.",
        "Gwen: It's my fault, isn't it? Mine and Will's. It's because you guys helped us get married.",
        "Maddie: I'm not sorry we helped, not for a second. If Mr. and Mrs. Hughes can't see that you go guys belong together, that's their problem.",
        "Gwen: But now it's become your problem, too. Do you want me to talk to his mom? Try to take some of the heat off? Not that I'd have much pull with her.",
        "Maddie: Thanks, but it's all going to be fine. We'll make it work.",
        "Gwen: So, you guys are really serious about each other.",
        "Maddie: Yeah. Well, if you and Will can stick it out, even with everybody telling you that you don't belong together, then there's hope for all of us.",
        "Gwen: If you need me to cover for you, or anything, I'm there.",
        "Maddie: Thanks. I may call you on that.",
        "Gwen: Don't think twice.",
        "Maddie: Ditto, anything we can do for you guys. I'll be here.",
        "Gwen: How about helping us cram for this crazy race to catch up at school.",
        "Maddie: Hey, you're looking at the cram queen of Oakdale Latin. Thank you. I would be happy to help. And you're going to need all the help you can get. Does will really get what you two are up against?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I think he does. I know he does. You know, that's why he's willing to stay at his dad's. He's big enough to put all his own stuff aside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I can handle the situation. Maybe even get used to it. But I won't lie. It's never going to feel like a good thing. And yeah, okay. There's a part of me that already regrets taking my dad's offer.",
        "Bob: Then why did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will's doing this for us. You know?",

        "Will: I'm doing this for Gwen.",

        "Katie: That's all Jack said? The truth? What does that mean?",
        "Nick: I have no idea. Chardonnay? Where did you find her, Jack?",
        "Jack: We'll get to you later, there's something that Carly wants to tell you. Go on, Carly. Tell him. Tell him everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: There's so many sides to the people we love. And so many we could never really know them all. Or even see them all. But when you love someone you know is good and the bad in them, because it all adds up to the sum total who they are and that's the whole person. And the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts. I love you. With all my heart. Even though you confuse me sometimes, you know? Sometimes I -- I think you're a little disturbed, but I love you. I love you like no one else ever could.",
        "Minister: Paul, is there something you'd like to say.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Emily, that's kind of a tough speech to follow, you know?",
        "Emily: It's okay. You don't have to say a thing. You've said it with the fact that we're here, and that you're marrying me.",
        "Paul: How about this? I promise I'll try not to screw up this time? How's that?",
        "Emily: Music to my ears.",
        "Minister: Well then, I guess we'll get straight to the point. Do you, Paul Ryan, take Emily Stewart as your lawful wife?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Casey: What I learned, you got good ears, girl.",
        "Gwen: Careful, the next thing you'll be telling me I got good taste, too.",
        "Casey: You got it all.",
        "Carly: You will never know how sorry I am.",
        "Nick: You're not sorry. That I've lost my badge, you're sorry you got caught.",
        "Emily: We're getting married. Unless, of course, you changed your mind."
