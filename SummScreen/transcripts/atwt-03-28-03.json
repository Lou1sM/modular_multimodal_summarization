        "Aaron: You'll be ready, Luce. Believe that.",
        "Emily: Hey, guys. Hi. Rosanna told me I might -- I might find you guys here.",
        "Aaron: What's up?",
        "Emily: Well, Alison's gonna be in court a little later, and -- well, they're gonna take her straight to the correctional -- to the place, you know, from there. Look, I'm not making excuses for anything she did. But it would help so much if she could look ahead a bit. You know, if she could feel like she could pick up her life after she serves her time.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry, but what does that have to do with us?",
        "Emily: Do you think the two of you could come over and say good-bye? Together, as a couple. I know. I know I'm asking a lot, Lucy. And you wouldn't be in that chair if not for Alison. But it would just mean so much to her to know that she has friends to come home to. And I want to send her off with a hard dose of reality. I want her to see that you two are very much together, and nothing she fantasizes about is ever gonna change that. She needs to forget about you, Aaron and figure out what she wants to do with her life. So please, will you help me get that through her thick skull, please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You tired?",
        "Molly: Who, me? No. Exhausted.",
        "Dusty: The '60s were onto something, you know?",
        "Molly: You mean all that free love?",
        "Dusty: Love the one you're with.",
        "[Dusty laughs]",
        "Molly: You're really corny. But you're right. Because last night was really easy. This morning was really easy.",
        "Dusty: No regrets?",
        "Molly: Not a one. You?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Molly: You were really terrific.",
        "Dusty: I was really inspired.",
        "Molly: Why do people bother with love?",
        "Dusty: Beats me. I'll take guiltless kissing any day.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Molly: You know what I did?",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Molly: I ordered more coffee.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Molly: So that's probably room service -- I don't know. Stupid. Just don't move a muscle, okay? Okay?",
        "Dusty: Okay, go. I don't want coffee.",
        "Rose: Oh, what, are you deaf?",
        "Molly: No, Rose, I'm preoccupied.",
        "Rose: Oh, I'm sorry. I -- had a little emergency, and I was looking for Dusty.",
        "Molly: Yeah, well, you've found him.",
        "Dusty: What kind of emergency, sweetheart?",
        "Rose: The kind of emergency that puts my shop on the skids before I even buy my first blower.",
        "Molly: What's she talking about?",
        "Rose: I'm talking about cold, hard cash. The guy that's leasing me the spot for my shop says he got a better offer, and if I don't come up with the money, like, right now, he's gonna give it to the guy behind door #2. You just gonna lay there or you gonna help keep my dream from going down the toilet?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Oh, what beautiful flowers. I'll give them some fresh water when we get them to the farm.",
        "Carly: Emma, are you sure I'm not gonna be in your way?",
        "Emma: It'll be nice to have some company.",
        "Carly: But with my crazy situation --",
        "Emma: Well, until someone tells me differently, that situation you're talking about is a Snyder, not a situation. Anything in these drawers? Oh. What's this?",
        "Carly: Oh, just some ideas. Just to keep me occupied. Better than zoning out in front of the TV, right?",
        "Emma: Well, I'm gonna go check on the paperwork, okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, thank you.",
        "Mike: Hey. The nurse at the station says they're letting you out, so -- do you need some help moving out to Emma's or anything?",
        "Carly: No. No, Emma's here. Jack's on his way. I'm sure Craig is circling the place like a well-meaning vulture.",
        "Mike: How are you feeling?",
        "Carly: Tired. But good.",
        "Mike: Well -- I took a couple hours off, so if you need any help with anything, you just let me know.",
        "Carly: Do you really want to help me, Mike?",
        "Mike: Of course I do.",
        "Carly: Then -- be a friend -- and get out of here. Give me a little breathing room.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What are you doing out here?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, hello. Thank you. Well, I just thought it would be nice if this area was just exploding with flowers for our wedding, so I decided to bed some myself. I thought perhaps some lilacs over there and, well, obviously tulips and daffodils and azaleas and paper-whites here. And I thought maybe some calla lilies by the hedge.",
        "Craig: I don't know. I don't really speak Hepburn.",
        "Rosanna: Do you still speak nuptials?",
        "Craig: Pardon?",
        "Rosanna: After my phone call to Carly --",
        "Craig: The one where you held Barbara over her head like an axe in case she doesn't meet her deadline?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, that would be the one.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, what you have to understand is, without Carly, there is no Monte Carlo.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, but I do believe the real question is, without Carly, is there still a wedding in our future?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Where is Alison now?",
        "Emily: She's at my place. You only have to stay a minute or so.",
        "Aaron: Can -- can we think about it?",
        "Emily: Sure. And whatever you decide, I'll understand. Thanks.",
        "Aaron: What do you think?",
        "Lucy: Part of me thinks it would be a good idea.",
        "Aaron: And the other part?",
        "Lucy: I hate admitting this, Aaron. I really do. But -- I just don't know if I can stand to look at Alison after everything she's done to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: That's okay. The landlord probably wants, what, first and last month.",
        "Rose: And a little extra for holding the place for such a long time.",
        "Dusty: He's a greedy little bugger, huh?",
        "Rose: I cannot lose this place, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry. Let me come down there and check it out. Okay? And we'll come up with something creative to buy enough time so you can get your financing in order, yeah?",
        "Rose: Hope you got a miracle up that sleeve.",
        "Dusty: Believe me. Let me take a shower. If the landlord shows up, you stall him until I get there, okay?",
        "Rose: Okay. Oh, here's the address. Here you go.",
        "Dusty: You have business cards already?",
        "Rose: Oh, yeah, you know, it's emotional ties. We've got faith, too. My pop always says, \"dream it, you believe it.\"",
        "Dusty: He's right. He's right. Let me take a shower. I'll be right there.",
        "Rose: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry for interrupting your little -- little party there. I'll meet you at the shop. Go shower. Chop-chop. Okay, I'll -- right.",

        "Dusty: Is it me, or does it feel like a tornado just blew through here?",
        "Molly: I'm kind of thinking the tornado blew through here last night. This morning --",
        "Dusty: Sorry I gotta go.",
        "Molly: Do you think maybe you can stop by here when you get back?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Molly: Here's to no guilt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Since when did my being a part of this baby's life become a problem?",
        "Carly: No, it's not.",
        "Mike: As long as I'm not around?",
        "Carly: This isn't about you, Mike.",
        "Mike: No, it's about the baby.",
        "Carly: Yes, yes, exactly. And what's good for me is what's good for the baby. It's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done for me, because I do. I'm just feeling a little suffocated. And every choice I make has some major consequence, like who's gonna drive me over to Emma's, what does it mean and who is it gonna hurt.",
        "Mike: I don't want to cause a problem.",
        "Carly: Then just step back a little.",
        "Mike: Would it be against the rules for me to stop by Emma's once in a while to visit?",
        "Carly: It would be against the rules if you didn't.",
        "Mike: I'll make sure I call first.",
        "Carly: There you go, that's a good idea.",
        "Mike: So I guess Jack's back in the picture.",
        "Carly: Well, he's -- he's trying. It's been very hard for him to get past what we did. And it's not like he's completely past it yet, but he's -- he's working on it. I want to help him.",
        "Mike: You don't have to explain, but if you need anything, please call me.",
        "Emma: If she needs anything, all she has to do is ask.",
        "Mike: Yeah, we both know how stubborn she is.",
        "Carly: Wait a second. \"She\" is still in the room, and she plans on -- on having no shame. I'm gonna let Emma pamper me up one side and down the other.",
        "Emma: Good.",
        "Carly: So you should get out of here. You should be working on chipping away Molly's stubborn streak instead of standing here fussing over me. Romance the girl. Don't just lay down and play dead. Hi, darling.",
        "Jack: Well, looks like we've got a full house.",
        "Emma: We're just about ready to go. Just a few things to do here.",
        "Jack: How are you feeling?",
        "Carly: Good, fine.",
        "Jack: Great. Mike.",
        "Mike: How you doing, Jack?",
        "Jack: Not bad. You all set?",
        "Carly: Yes. I can't wait.",
        "Jack: Okay. I'll have an orderly wheel you down.",
        "Mike: I can do that on my way out, all right?",
        "Jack: You're not staying?",
        "Mike: No. She's in good hands. Bye, sweetheart.",
        "Emma: Bye-bye, darling.",
        "Mike: I will see you later, okay? Jack.",
        "Jack: Did I just miss something?",
        "Carly: Just me letting Mike know that the only shoulder I need to lean on from now on is this one right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I'm gonna go meet with Evelyn, make sure this hearing is just a formality, and I'll see you outside the courtroom.",
        "Alison: So where's Emily?",
        "Hal: I'm not sure.",
        "Susan: I think she had to run some errands.",
        "Alison: What kind of errands?",
        "Hal: The good kind, nosy. It's kind of a surprise, although she never tells me anything.",
        "Emily: Hey, guys.",
        "Susan: Hey.",
        "Alison: So what's my big surprise?",
        "Emily: You know, I just wanted to do something nice for you before you had to leave, but it didn't work out. I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Well, it's not like I expected a big party so all my friends could wish me luck. No, it's cool. Really, I'm okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Now, you know I wouldn't even hire Barbara as a doorstop.",
        "Rosanna: And you know I'm not going to let my investment go down the tubes just because you have a soft spot -- for that -- could it be that I've actually run out of adjectives for my nasty sister?",
        "Craig: Carly is the real deal, and I made a promise that I would help her realize this dream she has had all her life.",
        "Rosanna: Well, that is just lovely. You go ahead and try and lift her from the cesspool she calls an existence, but not at my expense, if you don't mind. Look, I promise you, if Carly comes up with the designs and they are worth producing, I will throw some money at Barbara, and Carly will be the toast of the June show, but if she doesn't, then we have Barbara as a backup. It's as simple as that. So I put her under contract.",
        "Craig: You what? You what? That is suicide.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry, but do you actually see Carly doing any work while she's making out with other men and trying to give birth to an illegitimate child?",
        "Craig: Why do you keep underestimating her? Carly is capable of amazing things.",
        "Rosanna: If you said that to hurt me -- it worked.",
        "Craig: No, listen -- it was meant to convince you that if there was ever a time to support your sister, this is it. And by the way, why is saying something nice about Carly automatically an insult to you?",
        "Rosanna: File it under \"old baggage.\" Besides, you support her enough for the both of us. Look, this is a race to the finish, and may the best woman win. My money is on Barbara Ryan. And if you are smart and you want what's best for Monte Carlo, you will jump on her bandwagon before it passes you by.",
        "Craig: I'd be better off jumping in front of a bus.",
        "Rosanna: Fine. The freeway is over there.",
        "Craig: First of all, what you call backup Carly interprets as bad faith. And secondly, why does it have to be Barbara?",
        "Rosanna: Because we are in a bind, and she is available.",
        "Craig: It is a waste of money! All right, listen. If the unthinkable happens and Carly is unable to meet her deadline and you insist on Barbara Ryan, I resign from Monte Carlo.",
        "Rosanna: Because of Carly?",
        "Craig: No, because Barbara is dim and awful and so self-obsessed, she doesn't even realize it. And because before I put one ounce of energy behind anything that woman regurgitates, I walk. Not from us. Never from us.",
        "Rosanna: You sure about that? We're okay?",
        "Craig: Well, that depends. You still feel like planting?",
        "Rosanna: Do I have a reason?",
        "Craig: I do love you.",
        "Rosanna: Even when I make you crazy?",
        "Craig: Especially when you make me --",
        "Rosanna: You know, I'm not doing this whole Barbara thing to upset you. You realize that.",
        "Craig: Let's stop while we're ahead, all right?",
        "Rosanna: Okay.",
        "Craig: You know --",
        "Rosanna: What?",
        "Craig: I do believe I have a meeting.",
        "Rosanna: You are so transparent. I cannot believe you're just going to go at it already.",
        "Craig: At what?",
        "Rosanna: You're going to go give Carly the latest update.",
        "Craig: Tell me I have lost the power to deceive you.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, well, you know what? I don't care. Forget it. Go ahead. The woman deserves to know what she's up against.",
        "Craig: Why, boo -- you sound like you almost care.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, shut up. Pass me a tulip.",
        "Craig: She loves me. She loves me not.",
        "Rosanna: Oh. She loves you.",

        "Lucy: You can go if you want.",
        "Aaron: No, I -- I saw her yesterday, Luce.",
        "Lucy: I just feel bad, you know? Not for Alison, but for her mom and for Emily. I mean, if I was in that kind of trouble, I think my dad would want to know that my friends still cared, even a little bit.",
        "Aaron: Do you care?",
        "Lucy: I guess it wouldn't hurt to go.",
        "Aaron: Are you sure?",
        "Lucy: You'll be there, right? How hard could it be?",

        "[Door closes]",
        "Dusty: So this is the place, huh?",
        "Rose: Yeah, this is the place. I know it doesn't look like much, but once I'm through with it, it's gonna be glamour, capital \"g\".",
        "Dusty: Well, you were right about the location.",
        "Rose: And the layout -- I mean, hello, is it to die for or what?",
        "Dusty: You know what? I think you've got something here. You know, it was one thing to read about it on paper, but now that I see the actual space --",
        "Rose: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so? Want to come to the bank with me? Twist a few arms?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna do even better. I'm gonna bring the bank to you. How much do you need to make this dream come true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What was that about before, with Mike?",
        "Carly: I was just setting a few ground rules. Even if he is this baby's father, that doesn't change who I want to spend the rest of my life with.",
        "Jack: You know, sometimes, in moments like this, it almost feels like we haven't completely trashed the rest of our lives.",
        "Carly: I know that it's a long road back to where we were, but I want to get there. I'll do anything.",
        "Jack: Setting limits with Mike is a big step. One down, one to go.",
        "Carly: Pardon?",
        "Jack: You gave Mike the boot. Just wondering when it's gonna be Craig's turn. Come on. Do I have ESP or what?",
        "Craig: Carly, I need to talk to you, preferably alone.",
        "Carly: Not now, Craig, okay?",
        "Jack: Preferably, not ever.",
        "Carly: Jack -- Jack's here to take me to Emma's.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm not stopping you, but this is urgent.",
        "Carly: I'm not interested, all right? Just leave.",
        "Craig: You kicking me out?",
        "Carly: Yes, yes, I am.",
        "Jack: You want it in writing, Montgomery? Get lost.",
        "Craig: Five minutes, Carly. It's important. And then, Jack, she's all yours.",
        "Carly: It's okay.",
        "Jack: Don't even think about pressuring her into going back to work, or the next person in the hospital bed's gonna be you.",
        "Craig: Oh. Congratulations, I guess. Jack is feeling a little territorial.",
        "Carly: What is the emergency?",
        "Craig: We have a deadline.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Don't you think I know that? I'm gonna have everything we need, all right? As soon as I get to Emma's and get settled in.",
        "Craig: Rosanna has made it official. She has hired Barbara to create a new line, just in case.",
        "Carly: Great job. You really \"handled\" things.",
        "Craig: Hey, listen, as long as you deliver, Barbara is no threat. Rosanna only has her waiting in the wings for -- as insurance against the worst-case scenario.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, worst-case scenario is right. If Rosanna ends up using a line created by Barbara Ryan, Monte Carlo's gonna be a big, fat joke.",
        "Craig: I am not gonna let that happen. All right? So design away and Bar-bar will be forced to retreat into her lonely cave.",
        "Carly: Well, I do have a couple of preliminary things.",
        "Craig: Well, show me. Come on.",
        "Carly: They're just concepts, really, so far.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't care. I have a deadline. Throw me a lifeline here.",
        "Carly: Okay, well, just -- just remember that they're rough, you know? It's more of an idea of where I want the line to go.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Carly: I haven't even thought about color or texture or anything. This is just a -- an attitude. So -- so what do you think?",
        "Craig: Keep this up -- and Bar-bar's a comeback story. These stink.",

        "Hal: Emily, I think it's about time we went over to the courthouse. I'll pull the car out of the garage.",

        "Hal: Okay.",
        "Susan: Emily, I'm sorry it's just us.",

        "Alison: No.",

        "Aaron: Oh, I'm glad we caught you guys.",

        "Molly: Mike. Hey, it's me. Yeah -- could you come over? No. No, no, no, there's no problem. It's just, there's something that I wanted to tell you in person.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: I didn't bring you here for a handout.",
        "Dusty: And I'm not offering one. You know, once this place makes a profit, you pay back the loan with interest, same as the bank.",
        "Lou: I assume everything's in order.",
        "Rose: Dusty, Lou Hellfrich. This is Dusty Donovan.",
        "Dusty: How are you? I hear you got another offer on the table.",
        "Lou: Oh, yeah, very motivated individual.",
        "Dusty: Really?",
        "Rose: Did you sharpen your pencil?",
        "Lou: I've worked up some figures.",
        "Rose: All righty.",
        "Lou: I think this should cover it.",
        "Rose: Oh, madonna.",
        "Lou: I'm sorry, Rose. I'm not trying to squeeze you. Really, really, I'm not. But hey, I'm a businessman.",
        "Rose: Yeah, yeah, I know, I know all about it.",
        "Dusty: I'll tell you what, Lou. You take 15% off the bottom line, you walk out of here with a check right now.",
        "Lou: I don't know. That's surrendering a lot of profit.",
        "Dusty: Well, you tack six months onto the end of the lease with percentage increases, and we'll negotiate you to the lease.",
        "Lou: That's interesting.",
        "Dusty: We have a deal?",
        "Rose: Oh, wait, Dustin Donovan.",
        "Lou: I'll say you got yourself a deal.",

        "Lou: Sure.",
        "Dusty: Can you give me a minute with Rose over here?",
        "Lou: Sure, take your time.",

        "Rose: How can you be saving me any money when you're dishing out all the cash? I told you, I don't take handouts.",
        "Dusty: This isn't a handout, believe me. You have the expertise to make -- make a huge go of this place. I've got the money to back you. Now, I say we become partners right now, 50/50 split. You seal the deal right now with this guy, and you are in business."
