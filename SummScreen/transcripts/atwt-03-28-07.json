        "Cop: I looked for priors. He's passed a lot of bad checks.",
        "Margo: Did you call a lawyer?",
        "Cop: On his way.",
        "Margo: All right, let me know if they want to cut a deal.",
        "Cop: Will do.",
        "Margo: Well, Thomas Hughes, what are you doing here? You representing someone in lockup?",
        "Tom: No, and I'm going to try to keep that way. But Casey didn't come home last night. I have no clue where he is. And he's not picking up his cell --",
        "Margo: Oh, I should've told you. He left me a voicemail. He's spending a couple of days at the dorm.",
        "Tom: What? I thought the deal was that he stays at home until all of his debts are paid.",
        "Margo: No, no, it's fine. It's just for a couple of nights. He wants to patch things up with Elwood and then he owes some papers to professors.",
        "Tom: And you're okay with all this?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know I should have told you. I'm sorry.",
        "Tom: Well, I just assumed that maybe he jumped bail or -- okay, so, he's focusing on school. So, I guess there's probably nothing to worry about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Good morning.",
        "Gwen: Morning.",
        "Will: Did you sleep well?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Actually --",
        "Casey: Heads up.",
        "Gwen: I haven't slept that well in a long time.",
        "Casey: Breakfast. I've got extras, do you guys want any?",
        "Maddie: You.",
        "Will: You guys, I think we should ration this stuff.",
        "Maddie: Why? Don't we have that general store or whatever it was?",
        "Will: Yeah, we shouldn't go there unless we absolutely have to. We got to keep a low profile.",
        "Gwen: I hope that sheriff doesn't start asking questions about that movie that we're not making.",
        "Casey: Well, I hope these will hold you.",
        "Maddie: Graham crackers and juice boxes. I feel like I'm in preschool.",
        "Gwen: Do you?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, juice, graham crackers, friends, and I slept on the floor --",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, I aced preschool. It was my best year.",
        "Gwen: I actually haven't felt this safe since, I don't know, since before my mom came back into town.",
        "Will: Your mom is not coming anywhere near us. She got the big payoff.",
        "Gwen: What about when she goes through your entire trust fund?",
        "Will: Well, we'll be long gone.",
        "Gwen: You've given up everything for me.",
        "Will: We're together. That's everything I need.",
        "Gwen: I love you.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but we won't be safe until we cross the border. Once we get to Canada, we'll really be free.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Iris: Love that purse. I think it's a must have -- oh, Sweetie, I couldn't help but admire your purse and I was just wondering if you can tell me --",
        "Barbara: Hello, Iris.",
        "Iris: Barbie, hi. You know that bag is to die for. I don't suppose that you would even consider --",
        "Barbara: No, no, I wouldn\ufffdt. It's my own design.",
        "Iris: Wow, that's talent. Honey, you got a gift.",
        "Barbara: And so do you.",
        "Iris: Yeah?",
        "Barbara: Yeah, you always seem to know where Gwen and Will are.",
        "Iris: Yeah, I guess now that I think about it, you're right.",
        "Barbara: They told me that they were going to Fort Lauderdale for spring break, but apparently they've changed their minds. Do you know anything about that?",
        "Iris: Yeah, I know some. I mean, I was over there before they left. You see, and I'll tell you one thing, they weren't packing for the beach.",
        "Barbara: Did they say where they were going?",
        "Iris: No, no, nothing at all. It's was just a big secret.",
        "Barbara: They didn't say anything at all? Why is that?",
        "Iris: They're kids, you know. They don't know a thing about responsibility. But I'll tell you one thing, they sure don't want to be found.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Thank you.",
        "Margo: Okay, thanks. So you think this is a slippery slope?",
        "Tom: And you don't? Casey didn't ask permission to stay at the dorm, he informed you that he was going to be there.",
        "Margo: So, you want him to come home?",
        "Tom: I want him to pick up his damn cell phone! Why do we have these stupid things? I mean, we pay the bill, he doesn't pick it up! It's infuriating.",
        "Margo: All right, can we have this conversation so that your blood pressure stays in the healthy range?",
        "Tom: Why are you so calm about this?",
        "Margo: Because Maddie went to see her sister at Dwight. I think that Casey\ufffds probably just bored or lonely.",
        "Tom: Oh, stop, then let him do some chores or something around the house without a list from you and me. Let him just look and see what needs to be done and do it. That would show some maturity.",
        "Margo: Oh, I'd like to see that maturity, but you know what I really think?",
        "Tom: What?",
        "Margo: I think that part of Casey\ufffds therapy is he's supposed to make amends. Now, he got Elwood into major trouble. They haven't spoken since.",
        "Tom: Give me a break. You're breaking my heart. They were gambling buddies.",
        "Margo: Oh, Honey, but they were friends first. It wouldn't hurt either one of them to study together, would it? Now can we just order breakfast? Man, you know the night shift makes me hungry.",
        "Tom: Yes, as long as you don't order the number three and make me get oatmeal.",
        "Margo: Will you stop being so grouchy?",
        "Elwood: Hey, Mrs. Hughes. Mr. Hughes.",
        "Margo: Hi, Elwood. Are you here alone?",
        "Elwood: Yeah. Sorry to interrupt, but I'm getting a new roommate and I need Casey to move his stuff out. Do you know where he is?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: So how long will it take your friend to get us those passports?",
        "Casey: He said a couple of days, but I should probably check in with him.",
        "Maddie: I just hope they don't look fake like those cheesy driver's licenses, you know.",
        "Casey: No, they should look pretty legit.",
        "Maddie: Well, just watch what you say around the sheriff. Make sure he doesn't hear you talking about them. Because he's already way too interested on what we're doing.",
        "Casey: Come on, the guy owns this place, the store, and he's renting this.",
        "Maddie: I know, I'm just saying, just try not to act suspicious, okay?",
        "Casey: Whoa, listen. I didn't come up here to blow anybody's cover.",
        "Maddie: I know. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound bossy. I just -- I don't want us to be separated ever again.",
        "Casey: Yeah, me neither.",
        "Maddie: And I'm really sorry about Adam. I didn't mean to -- you have to believe me.",
        "Casey: I do. I do.",
        "Gwen: Um, while you and Casey are out, I'm going to clean up the other room for us or for them.",
        "Will: Do you want to wait for me? This place is kind of a pit.",
        "Gwen: No, I'll be fine.",
        "Will: Don't make me feel useless. It's a man's job to open up jars and kill bugs and stuff like that --",
        "Gwen: Well, if I come across any four legged creatures, they're all yours.",
        "Will: Okay, deal, but be careful. There's rusty nails and loose floor boards and there's no ER.",
        "Gwen: I'll be fine. I want to do it. Besides, it's the only way we get privacy. So, you can just, you know, think about that.",
        "Will: Well, I'll help you later, all right? We should really get going.",
        "Casey: All right, any requests?",
        "Maddie: Yes, come back soon.",
        "Will: Yeah, all right, we're out of here. Are you sure you're okay with me leaving you?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, no, I'm fine. You don't have to worry about me.",
        "Will: We'll be back soon.",
        "Maddie: I love it here. I feel really safe.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, it smells kind of rank, we're going to have to scrub it forever -- but it's peaceful.",
        "Maddie: I could get used to it.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, yeah, me too.",
        "Maddie: What was that?",
        "Maddie: What did that sound like to you?",
        "Gwen: I think someone's outside.",
        "Maddie: What should we do?",
        "Gwen: Shhh --",
        "Maddie: What are you doing? You can't go out there.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I'm going to take a peek. It's all clear.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I know. But we both heard something. And I think it was that guy. Zorro.",
        "Gwen: A raccoon?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, it looks like he's searching for food.",
        "Gwen: All right, well, I don't want you feeding him.",
        "Maddie: Well, we have some crackers I can give him.",
        "Gwen: No, no messing with the balance of nature. Come on, I don't want him moving in.",
        "Maddie: Oh, geez. Don't you think you're over-reacting? I mean, we haven't even been on one date yet.",
        "Gwen: Oh, right. Um, a joke, I remember.",
        "Maddie: Yes, you could've fooled me.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. I guess I'm still pretty stressed.",
        "Maddie: What did you think was out there?",
        "Gwen: Honestly? My head went right to Adam.",
        "Maddie: Okay, once we get to Canada, you're not going to think about him as much.",
        "Gwen: It's not really the geography, Maddie. It's what we did and how we left him. You know, we were wrong, and we know that.",
        "Maddie: I know, but nothing can bring Adam back, and nothing can change the way that he died. When we get to Canada though, I want to make up for what I did. Maybe help people, study to become a nurse or something.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, we'll be new people with new names.",
        "Maddie: Exactly. We can start fresh and maybe even one day, we can make a new demo.",
        "Gen: I can't really change my voice. But I can still write songs and have other people sing them.",
        "Maddie: That could work. You'd be doing something that you love.",
        "Gwen: The most important thing for me right now is that I'm free and that I'm with Will. And I promised him that we would get this place clean. So, I should probably start with mold. Mold -- does this look -- oh, my gosh, is this a bed frame?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. There's a mattress in the back room. It's probably been there since the civil war, but --",
        "Gwen: No, it doesn't matter. It's awesome. If we can put it together, that means one of us or two of us can actually sleep in a real bed tonight.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, that should be you and Will. Hey, listen, before we start this, it's getting cold in here. I'm going to go grab some logs.",
        "Gwen: Okay, fine. But no detours and no play dates with Zorro. I can't do this by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I'm confused. Gwen and Will don't want to be found by anyone? Or just you?",
        "Iris: Why don't you ask your son? But, from the looks of things, they're not going to be back anytime soon.",
        "Barbara: The looks of things?",
        "Iris: Yeah, they way just flew out of their place, Gwennie hardly had time to even close the suitcases.",
        "Barbara: They are in school. They have to be back for classes.",
        "Iris: Supposedly. Mmmm. You know, this is yummy. My lips, they get so dry in the wintertime. Want some?",
        "Barbara: No thanks.",
        "Iris: Oh, Honey, it's the good stuff. You know, it was 30 bucks a pop. Teeth?",
        "Barbara: I'll pass. That's all you know?",
        "Iris: Oh, I forgot to mention something. That Gwennie's friend, Maddie went with them.",
        "Barbara: Maddie? Why'd she do that?",
        "Iris: Beats me. Barbie, listen, since the bag is off-limits, do you want to tell me where you got those classy shoes?",
        "Barbara: I don't really remember --",
        "Iris: I bet it was Paris. Yeah, you know, I'm going to keep a lookout when I'm there.",
        "Barbara: You're going to Paris?",
        "Iris: Yeah. Ought to have goals. You know what, gotta fly now. First class.",
        "Barbara: You know, I'm sorry I couldn't help you with fashion issues.",
        "Iris: Oh, you've helped me more than you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, when's the last time you saw Casey?",
        "Elwood: Like right around the time he got arrested. Sorry.",
        "Margo: So he hasn't been back to the dorm?",
        "Elwood: Well, don't take this the wrong way, but he's not exactly welcome at the moment.",
        "Tom: So he didn't make plans to stay in your room or study with you?",
        "Elwood: No, I haven't talked to him. I haven't seen him. I don't think anyone at the school has seen him either, because I've been trying to track him for like two days now.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Elwood: Why, you don't know where he is either?",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm sure he'll turn up soon.",
        "Elwood: I hope so. I heard that he couldn't leave town or he'd get locked up.",
        "Tom: Yeah, yeah, look, if you hear from him, do me a favor and just let us know.",
        "Elwood: Sure thing. But if he's on some kind of poker bender, I'm not giving him a dime.",
        "Tom: Okay. Understood, understood.",
        "Elwood: So, just tell him I'm going to putting his stuff in storage.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. Fine, fine. Okay, thanks. So, all right, so, he wasn't with Elwood. All right, do you think he's gambling again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Yeah, that thing we talked about? Yeah, it's a go. All right, as soon as you can. All right, just tell me what I need to do and when.",
        "Will: It's not my first film, but it's my first feature, which is why I have to have all the shots lined up before I bring in the cast and cameras and crew --",
        "Sheriff: Sounds like it's going to cost you a bundle.",
        "Will: Yeah, that's why we have to be conservative, you know, about the money.",
        "Sheriff: That's Thelma. She keeps tabs on the state blotter. I better see what's up.",
        "Casey: Whoa, whoa, but that's not you said. No, it's fine. Just get them. I'll get the money.",
        "Will: That didn't sound good.",
        "Casey: He said he can get the passports, but he's worried about bringing them up here, so it's going to cost us extra.",
        "Will: How much more?",
        "Casey: A 100 bucks each.",
        "Will: On top of the 2 grand? I don't have that.",
        "Casey: I know. But if we want the passports, then we need to get the money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Adam hits Maddie over the head with a branch]",
        "Maddie: Oh, ow! Gwen?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: So, it's really all about money.",
        "Sheriff: It usually is, Son.",
        "Will: Yeah, so like I said before, things are really tight. My friend actually came and he doesn't have any cash to pay his own way.",
        "Casey: You know, I thought my parents would like to see me in a movie.",
        "Sheriff: No, huh?",
        "Will: No, yeah, they're sick of bailing him out, and they figure if he becomes an actor, it's never going to end. So they cut him off.",
        "Sheriff: Well, they've got a point.",
        "Will: Yeah, so we're willing to do work. You know, repairs, painting -- and I was wondering if maybe you gave us back some of the rent money, then we could just work it off in chores?",
        "Sheriff: I'm sorry, boys. I already passed your cash to my wife. There's no way in the world I'm getting a cent of that back. Maybe you ought to think about heading back home.",
        "Casey: Well, that went well.",
        "Will: You got any ideas?",
        "Casey: One -- but you're not going to like it. Well, I'm not thinking about robbing anybody, if that's what you're thinking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Finally! My hands are freezing off. But this is going a lot faster than I thought. So, if you just give me a hand, I can move it into the other room.",
        "[Gwen screams]",
        "Gwen: Adam --",
        "Adam: Hello, Gwen.",
        "Gwen: It's -- it's really you. You're --",
        "Adam: Alive? Yeah. No thanks to you or Maddie.",
        "Gwen: You saw her?",
        "Adam: Yeah. Maddie and I -- we already had our little reunion. I wouldn't get my heart set on that firewood if I were you.",
        "Gwen: What does that mean? What did you do? Tell me!",
        "Adam: I did to her what she did to me.",
        "Gwen: You hit her?",
        "Adam: Now to be more precise, I hit her on the back of the head and watched her fall.",
        "Gwen: Oh, God, Adam.",
        "Adam: Look at that concern. It is so touching. The only problem is you're not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, Sheriff, could I ask you something?",
        "Sheriff: I've already made my decision about the cabin, Boys. That's a cash- only deal.",
        "Casey: No, this is something else. What do you know about this flyer right here? They said they need laborers at Hotchkiss Mills.",
        "Sheriff: Yeah, I've got a call about that this morning. They asked me send any strays down that way.",
        "Casey: All right, then we'll check it out.",
        "Sheriff: Might as well.",
        "Will: How do we get there?",
        "Sheriff: You go out to the main road, make a right, and keep walking.",
        "Casey: All right, cool. This could be what we need.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Sheriff: Just keep out of trouble. I'm watching you.",
        "Will: All right, well, we'll see you later. Um, I think we should go back to the cabin first. Because if we get hired, then we're going to be gone all day. I don't want Gwen thinking anything's wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will's going to be back any minute --",
        "Adam: Don't even speak to me about Will. He spent five minutes mourning me, and then hatched his big romantic scheme to lead you off into the sunset with all your troubles behind you.",
        "Gwen: How do you know any of that?",
        "Adam: Well, when you're dead, it's pretty easy to eavesdrop. And play mind games with cell phones and flowers --",
        "Gwen: It was you! I did see you in front of my car that night.",
        "Adam: The thing is, you couldn't be too sure, could you? Guilt can really play tricks on the mind, can't it?",
        "Gwen: Did you enjoy torturing me?",
        "Adam: Oh, I'm not done yet. I want to see you break.",
        "Gwen: Haven't you seen enough? With that branch in my bed, and my ring back, you're in my house when will was gone --",
        "Adam: Yeah, you kept me busy.",
        "Gwen: And all this time, I thought it was --",
        "Adam: Who?",
        "Gwen: My mom.",
        "Adam: Iris doesn't even know I'm alive. But you played right into her hands. And she played the con right to the end. You know, your mom's a pro. Watching Will sign over his trust fund? That was priceless.",
        "Gwen: What do you want?",
        "Adam: I want to see the look on Will's face when he walks in here and sees us together. I just don't think that's going to happen any time soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, if we're going to get hired, we should go to that mill right now.",
        "Will: I wish we hadn't trashed our cell phones. I'd like Gwen to know where we are.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and then everyone else would know where we are, too. My mom is probably tracing right now.",
        "Will: Yeah, they're not going to be far behind us.",
        "Casey: Look, we need to move, okay? Because we're going to get out of the country, we need passports. To get passports, we need the money.",
        "Will: Look, I don't like leaving Maddie and Gwen alone.",
        "Casey: Me neither, but I don't think we have a choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What did you do to Will?",
        "Adam: Let's just say he won't be coming back to the honeymoon suite.",
        "Gwen: No, he just found out about what happened to you. He wasn't a part of it.",
        "Adam: Yeah, but he's a part of it now, isn't he? He's putting miles in between you and that grave site you dug for me.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Okay, I get it. You've come -- you've come for payback. So why don't -- why don't you just call the police? Okay, why don't you just get it over with?",
        "Adam: No, I'd rather keep this between us. How it belongs. At least for now.",
        "Gwen: Okay, then just let me -- please, let me just check on Maddie.",
        "Adam: No. No, no, no, the cold ground was good enough for me. I'm sure it's just fine for her.",
        "Gwen: Please, Adam, please, you're better than this.",
        "Adam: No, your snotty little friend is the one who needs an attitude adjustment. She actually believed I could hurt you.",
        "Gwen: I believed it, too. I mean, you just set up your brother to look like a thief -- you can't blame us if we didn't exactly feel secure around you?",
        "Adam: All I was trying to do is get a head start before you ratted me out to my mother and brothers.",
        "Gwen: It wasn't my job to bust you.",
        "Adam: So, you weren't going to turn me in?",
        "Gwen: I wasn't going to let Will go to prison for something that he didn't do. But I was going to let you own up to it yourself.",
        "Adam: You went postal on me!",
        "Gwen: You were all over me! And when Maddie saw you, she thought you were trying to hurt me. It was just a split-second response. She didn't hunt you down.",
        "Adam: Oh, you mean -- you mean, like I'm doing?",
        "Gwen: I'm not sure what you're doing. You haven't told me.",
        "Adam: Now, I forgot how well you play innocent. Is that why you thought you'd get away with it? Leaving me out there to rot?",
        "Gwen: No. No, we didn't know that you were still alive.",
        "Adam: Do you have any idea how lame that sounds?",
        "Gwen: Yes. And I'd take it back. We both take it back. We know that what we did was horrible. Adam That doesn\ufffdt begin to cover it, Gwen. When you came home, and you washed off the mud and the blood, and you crawled into bed -- I came to. Only I woke up in total blackness, with all that dirt pressing down on me.",
        "Gwen: Please stop --",
        "Adam: Yeah. I couldn't breathe. I could barely move.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry --",
        "Adam: And I had to figure out how I got there. And you know, that's when I wished that I had been killed.",
        "Gwen: No, no, don't say that! No one wanted that --",
        "Adam: But instead - but instead of lying there, letting myself die, I crawled out. And when I finally got out, when I could see the moonlight, I sat there. I sat on my own grave thinking --",
        "Gwen: Why didn't you go to the hospital?",
        "Adam: With so much to explain? You know, the last thing I remembered was arguing with you. I thought, it couldn't have been Gwen. Gwen wouldn't leave me out here to die -- then I remembered hearing a voice, it was Maddie\ufffds voice. And I thought, yeah, it had to be her. Because Gwen, you and me, we mean too much to each other. You must have gone for help and when you came back, then I turned myself in.",
        "Gwen: So, you just waited?",
        "Adam: Yes, Gwen. I waited. A long, long time. Then I saw something in the dirt. You know, if the moon hadn't been so bright, I probably wouldn't have seen it. I picked it up, it was a ring. It was your wedding ring. And that's when I remember hearing another voice. You were saying to Maddie, use your hands. You were showing her how to bury me alive.",
        "Gwen: If you would have given us a sign. If you would have shown --",
        "Adam: I couldn't move or speak!",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry --",
        "Adam: Then I thought how much I believed in you. How much I loved you. How I wanted to share my life with you. Think of that, Gwen. Imagine that. The person that you would do anything in this world for. And she's burying you alive. As much as I loved you, I knew I could not let you get away with that.",
        "Gwen: I didn't know. I didn't know you were still alive.",
        "Adam: That's hardly the point.",
        "Gwen: But if we knew, Adam, I mean, if knew that you were going through --",
        "Adam: What? What, what, what? What, you would've called 911? Yeah, yeah, you had your chance to do that, Gwen, when you thought I was dead. You passed that up.",
        "Gwen: I should have --",
        "Adam: Yeah, you should have the minute Maddie knocked me out.",
        "Gwen: We were scared, okay? Maddie didn't think that the cops would believe it was an accident.",
        "Adam: What, so you chose her over me?",
        "Gwen: No, no, no, it wasn't like that. We weren't thinking.",
        "Adam: Well, you threw her murder weapon in with me. You threw in my cell phone. It seems to me like you were thinking real hard about how to cover up your tracks --",
        "Gwen: I know and I don't blame you for wanting to get back to me -- I really don't but you have to believe, in spite of what I did, that I never wanted you dead.",
        "Adam: I know, you could've stopped it at any time.",
        "Gwen: I know but I didn't know that then. But now that I know you're okay, we can fix this. Please? I hated the way that I was that night -- I hated everything about it. I never wanted to hurt you.",
        "Adam: All I wanted to do was save you from living half a life with Will.",
        "Gwen: You don't understand --",
        "Adam: No, I do, Gwen. I do. I understand. First time I saw you, the first time I heard you sing -- I saw what you could be, what you could mean to the world.",
        "Gwen: And I'll never be able to thank you enough for that. You taught me so much about music. I'll always remember those times. I miss those times.",
        "Adam: Hey, we can have them again.",

        "Sheriff: You boys back already? What happened at the mill?",
        "Casey: Nothing. It was closed.",
        "Sheriff: That's strange. I'm sure that call was about Hotchkiss Mill. Maybe it's for tomorrow.",
        "Will: Well, I suppose we can go back.",
        "Sheriff: Well, I have to leave right now. A report just came in on a stolen car. That doesn't happen much around here.",
        "Casey: Hey, can we use your phone one more time?",
        "Sheriff: Just make sure the door is closed behind you when you leave. And if anything's missing, I know where to look.",
        "Casey: Yeah, all right, thanks.",
        "Will: We didn't make a mistake. Why is the mill closed?",
        "Casey: I don't know. It's weird.",
        "Will: I think we should get out of here. We should get back.",
        "Casey: Hey, Will? Sometimes it hits me so hard that Adam\ufffds dead, I can't believe it.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know.",
        "Casey: Sometimes, I feel like I could just call him up, you know.",
        "Will: Yeah, even if it was just to talk, it would be nice.",
        "Casey: Yeah, one time when I was six, I snuck into his car when he was going out with some friends. And he found me, I thought he was going to take me home, but --",
        "Will: What did he do?",
        "Casey: He took me to the movies and out to play pool with his friends. I guess I just thought, you know, one day --it could be like that again.",
        "Will: I know how you feel.",
        "Casey: I hope my mom keeps believing that Adam\ufffds okay. And he just split for some tropical paradise to avoid jail. I don't want her to find out that her son's dead. Or how he died.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Thank you. Thank you so much for your help. Okay, so Casey has not used his credit card in a couple of weeks.",
        "Tom: That's good news.",
        "Margo: Yes, it is. Considering I forgot to cancel his card. I swear, I will stay more on top of this from now on.",
        "Tom: Well, you're not used to policing Casey. Neither of us is.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know. It used to be we could trust him when he told us things. So, if he's not using his credit card, then he's not gambling, right?",
        "Tom: To tell you the truth, I can't think this is about poker. I logged on his computer, checked his browser. He hasn't visited any online sites.",
        "Margo: Well, that's good news, isn't it, yes? So, why hasn't he called? Why hasn't he called us?",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Tom: I'll get that.",
        "Barbara: Hi.",
        "Tom: Barbara, hi.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry to stop by so early. I was just wondering if I could talk to Maddie.",
        "Margo: Hi. Good morning, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Good morning. Um, is she here?",
        "Margo: Why? What's the matter?",
        "Barbara: Well, Gwen and Will have taken off and apparently they were not very truthful with me about where they've gone. And I thought maybe Maddie might know something.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, Maddie has gone to visit her sister in Dwight.",
        "Barbara: Is that the story she told you?",
        "Margo: Well, she left a message. I mean, it's not that Tom and I were very anxious for her to go visit her sister, but if she didn't ask our advice. And since she had the week off from school --",
        "Barbara: Well, I see I'm not the only one out of the loop.",
        "Margo: What do you mean? All the kids have the week off for spring break. Are we missing something?",
        "Barbara: I'm not really sure, but you should check out Maddie\ufffds story. In fact, you want to talk to Casey about that -- in fact, can I talk to Casey --",
        "Margo: Yeah, we'll talk to him.",
        "Barbara: Okay. If anything comes to light, please call me. I ran into Gwen's mother and she seemed certain that Gwen and Will and Maddie have taken off for someplace where no one can find them.",
        "Margo: Well, Gwen's mother is not the most reliable source.",
        "Barbara: Ordinarily, but I think she's telling the truth. I just wonder what kind of trouble Maddie\ufffds gotten them into this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: This should hold us. So, do you think that sheriff's going to be back soon?",
        "Will: Probably, but we can't wait.",

        "Will: I know, I know, we'll leave cash on the counter.",
        "Casey: And what if someone else finds it? Wait, here. Put it in here and then put the sheriff's name on it. Then, we should be covered.",
        "Will: All right. Done. We should get back. Maddie and Gwen are probably hungry. I don't believe it.",
        "[Jade walks by outside the window]",
        "Casey: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Maddie, please be all right. Please, please, please be all right. What did he do to you? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, come on, Maddie. I have to get you out of here, okay?",
        "Adam: Not part of the plan.",
        "Gwen: No, we got to get her out of here. She's bleeding.",
        "Adam: Yes, I know.",
        "Gwen: Please, let's just take her inside. It's warmer.",
        "Adam: Funny, I don't remember the weather being an issue when I was out in the cold.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry.",
        "Adam: Your apologies don't mean that much to me right now, Gwen. You know, if you and your little friend had showed one little ounce of compassion, I might return the favor.",
        "Gwen: No, she just made a mistake, okay? We both did.",
        "Adam: Maddie got exactly what she deserves -- now it's your turn.",
        "Gwen: No, no. No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What's Jade doing here?",
        "Will: She knows what Gwen and Maddie did to Adam.",
        "Casey: Jade? You think she followed you?",
        "Will: Let's find out. It won't open. She must've locked it from the outside.",
        "Casey: Whoa, did you see that?",
        "Will: Are you serious? There's got to be another way out.",
        "Casey: All right.",

        "Margo: Well, are you sure? No, no, I'm sure -- I was -- I was just probably misinformed. All right. Yes, thank you. Thank you so much for your help. I will.",
        "Tom: Any luck?",
        "Margo: That was the warden in Dwight. Maddie didn't go and visit her sister. Eve doesn't even have visiting rights.",
        "Tom: Maybe Maddie didn't even know anything out that.",
        "Margo: Well, don't you think she'd check that out before she made the trip?",
        "Tom: I don't know what any of these kids are doing, besides lying. I mean, are we really that intimidating?",
        "Margo: No, no, we're not. They're just -- they just don't want to disappoint us. They're trying to protect us.",
        "Tom: Didn't we always say that we could handle anything as long as it was the truth?",
        "Margo: Yeah. Man, what a couple of months this has been. First losing Hal, almost losing you, having to send Danny off to a boarding school, and then Casey gets into all this mess with online gambling and -- and then Adam -- Adam\ufffds just disappeared.",
        "Tom: That is all true, but to tell you the truth, I don't think Maddie and Casey are trying to spare our feelings.",
        "Margo: You really think they're together?",
        "Tom: I do.",
        "Margo: It just seemed like they were so broken up. I mean, after Casey was arrested, Maddie couldn't even look me in the eyes if I asked her as much as a question.",
        "Tom: Well, maybe she felt really abandoned when Casey got into the online gambling thing. I mean, given her family history, it's not what she needs right now.",
        "Margo: Did I tell you that Dallas told me that Maddie went to the morgue?",
        "Tom: What? No.",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah, she did. It was a couple weeks ago when that body was found in the woods out by the airport. And Maddie told Dallas that she just wanted to make sure it wasn't another one of her sister's victims.",
        "Tom: That's out there.",
        "Margo: Yeah. And then she lies about this trip to Dwight.",
        "Tom: If Gwen and Will were actually going to play at the beach, would Maddie have gone with them?",
        "Margo: Yeah, but why keep it a secret?",
        "Tom: Because if Casey was going to go along, they wouldn't tell anyone, because he would be jumping bail.",
        "Margo: No, he wouldn't risk jail just to party. He's not that stupid.",
        "Tom: Yeah, well, if Barbara\ufffds right, and Maddie\ufffds in some kind of trouble, wouldn't Casey follow her?",
        "Margo: He would. And then when he got picked up.",
        "Tom: It would be completely out of my hands. Because Casey knows he cannot leave the city limits with serious consequences. And I warned him.",
        "Margo: Yeah, we both did. Oh, my God, just a few short months ago, everything was so good. We were so proud of our boys. Casey was doing great at the university, and Adam was building his reputation in the music industry. Now I don't even know where they are. I don't even know who they are. What changed?",
        "Tom: Well, it wasn't us.",
        "Margo: Maybe it should have been us. Maybe we should have changed. Maybe if we had changed, we would have seen this coming, we could have done something.",
        "Tom: No, it's not your fault.",
        "Margo: It doesn't matter whose fault it is. Bottom line is, we're losing our family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: Threatening me isn't the way to win me over, Gwen. It doesn't make your apologies seem too sincere.",
        "Gwen: You're scaring me.",
        "Adam: So it's my fault you got violent?",
        "Gwen: You're hurting me. Ow!",
        "Adam: Better?",
        "Gwen: Yes. Thank you. Look, maybe we can just start over?",
        "Adam: We can pretend that you didn't lead me on?",
        "Gwen: What do you want? I don't know what you want.",
        "Adam: I want what I've always wanted, more.",
        "Gwen: Of what?",
        "Adam: Of you.",
        "Gwen: No, I can't give you that. I'm married to your brother. I love him. He gets all of me.",
        "Adam: You can change that.",
        "Gwen: I can\ufffdt. You're asking me for something I can't give.",
        "Adam: When I flew home from my father's funeral, I was just coming off a 2-year relationship that had just ended. I just lost my dad, my career was on hold, but none of that seemed to matter when I met you. The only time I felt any real peace, any real hope, was when you and I were together.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.",
        "Adam: This isn't about ideas! It's about you and me and what we can do if we just shut out the rest of the world -- just allow ourselves to feel, Gwen. We belong together.",
        "Gwen: No. I'm sorry, I don't feel that.",
        "Adam: You're lying! You don't want to admit that you want me. Because that would mean you weren't all good. Be an all good person. A good person wouldn't leave me out there to die. A good person wouldn't forget all about me and start a whole new life with my brother.",
        "Gwen: How I can forget about you? You've been torturing me and who knows what you did to Maddie.",
        "Adam: You still care more about that psycho than you do me. She wanted me dead!",
        "Gwen: She was just trying to stop you --",
        "Adam: I was trying to stop you from denying how you really felt. When we were in L.A., when we kissed, that meant something.",
        "Gwen: No. You're wrong --",
        "Adam: I'm not wrong. I was there. You wanted me. And I'm not going anywhere until you prove it.",
        "Gwen: No! No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I can't put this off any longer. I had to put out an APB when Adam disappeared and now I have to put one out on Casey. Because it's my job.",

        "Margo: Mm-hmm, he's officially a fugitive.",

        "Tom: Are you talking as a cop or a mom?",
        "Margo: Both. What we're doing is not protecting him.",
        "Tom: Well, what if he is protecting Maddie? Because he's in love with this girl. Now, don't we have to factor that in? Because I'd do anything for you. I'd cross the state line, I'd break any law, I'd leave the country --",
        "Margo: I know, but this is not the same thing.",

        "Margo: Oh, my God, of course I do.",
        "Tom: Okay. So put an APB out on him, and these charges start to stack up. And when it escalates, Casey could wind up doing some serious time. Is that what you want?",
