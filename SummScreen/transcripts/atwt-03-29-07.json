        "Brad: So, she keeps complaining to her friends and her therapist, but never tells the guy what's bothering her.",
        "Katie: That's right.",
        "Brad: You know, it's like the woman yelling all the time that the guy never helps, then when he does do something, he never does it the way she'd do it, so it's -- it's wrong.",
        "Katie: Right, it's not like she told him, or tried to tell him what was wrong and he didn't listen.",
        "Brad: What did you just say?",
        "Katie: I -- I think I agreed with you. And, that's all the time we have for today.",
        "Brad: That's great. Because I have no idea what to say.",
        "Katie: We'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Kim: And cut!",
        "Brad: What the hell are you doing, agreeing with me?",
        "Katie: You think I saw it coming?",
        "Brad: Well, what are we going to talk about if you keep pulling stunts like that? I mean -- since when did you start listening to me in the first place?",
        "Katie: This is too weird.",
        "Kim: Well, whatever it is you're doing, it's working. Because you guys have a ton of mail here, 95% of it positive. Look at it. See for yourselves.",
        "Kim: Want me to take it?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Oh, this woman says that even her husband watches with her now, and he can't believe that's there's people on TV that talk like we do.",
        "Brad: What is she talking about? I think my hair looks great.",
        "Katie: And she would like to take us home. That's cute.",
        "Brad: I wonder what her hair looks like. Hey, that is a great idea.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: That is a great idea. Wow, there is something in this, something that gets me thinking.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, not that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Sage. What are you doing?",
        "Sage: Reading.",
        "Jack: Well, I can see that. What are you doing here? Why aren't you in school?",
        "Sage: I'm sick. Aunt Emma said I could stay home.",
        "Jack: Oh. Well, let me feel you. Hmm. Looks like you've made a complete recovery. Come on, I'll take you to school.",
        "Sage: No! I'm not going.",
        "Jack: I see. Kind of taking a page out of Parker's playbook, aren't you?",
        "Sage: It's not funny, okay?",
        "Jack: Okay. All right. I won't joke around, as long as you tell me what's really going on. \"Mothers with muffins day.\" Yeah. Oh, Honey.",
        "Sage: They all feel sorry for me. I hate it! I just hate it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Craig has drawn the noose very, very tight. Of course -- with your help.",
        "Lily: How many times can I apologize?",
        "Lucinda: You signed a contract, Dear. A legal contract giving away practically complete control of Worldwide.",
        "Lily: I just wish there was something that I could do.",
        "Lucinda: I think you have done quite enough already.",
        "Lily: Yes. I guess so.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, well, if there's no legal recourse, I'll just have to get on the phone and find myself a hit man.",
        "Craig: Don't need to go that far.",
        "Lucinda: But I want to.",
        "Craig: Of course you do. I know that. But just do me one small favor and you can keep your company.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: One, two, three.",
        "Will: All right, one more time.",
        "Casey: Again. One, two, three. Damn it! Why did Jade have to find out about Adam? She's had it in for Gwen and Maddie since the beginning.",
        "Will: This doesn't make any sense.",
        "Casey: Of course it does. She trapped us in here so she can call the cops!",
        "Will: Yeah, but if she was going to do that, why follow us up here? Why not just do it when we're back in Oakdale?",
        "Casey: 'Cause it's worse here. Gwen and Maddie are on the run, I jumped bail -- wait, what the hell are you doing?",
        "Will: The hinges are weak. We got to get out of here, Man. Jade might have already called the cops. Come on, one more time.",
        "Casey: Let's do it again. Let's do it for real this time. [Both together] One, two, three!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Help me! Help me! Somebody help us! Help us! Somebody!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: You little --",
        "Gwen: No, what am I supposed to do? Not fight back? Just let you do whatever you want?",
        "Adam: You can fight all you want, it's not going to change anything.",
        "Gwen: And Maddie? What, you think she's just going to stop screaming? That nobody's going to hear her?",
        "Adam: I think you were too careful when you picked this place. Scream as loud you want! It's not going to change a thing.",
        "Gwen: So, that's who you want to be? The man who rapes his brother's wife?",
        "Adam: After what you and your little sidekick did to me, I think you deserve anything I want.",
        "Gwen: No! No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: No \ufffd",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Adam: You know, it's been a while since you and I had some time together.",
        "Gwen: Adam --",
        "Adam: That last night we were alone, I was just talking, trying to tell you how I felt --",
        "Gwen: That wasn't talking.",
        "Adam: You decided you had the right to kill me and to bury me.",
        "Gwen: I had the right to fight back.",
        "Adam: See, I paid for my crime without getting any of the benefits. Now, don't you feel sorry for what you did?",
        "Gwen: Yes. But, Adam, please -- please, remember who you are. Remember who your parents are --",
        "Adam: Shut up! Just shut up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie? Maddie, what happened?",
        "Maddie: I don't know, somebody hit me from behind.",
        "Will: Where's Gwen?",
        "Maddie: I don't know. I screamed, but no one came.",
        "Will: I'm going to go check out the cabin. Gwen! [Will pushes Adam away from Gwen] I'm going to kill you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're just like your mom, you know that?",
        "Sage: Don't say that!",
        "Jack: She hates when people feel sorry for her. Hates it.",
        "Sage: Good for her.",
        "Jack: Come here. And another way -- another way you're just like your mom? She'd always rather be mad than sad. And, you know, that was her choice. And it's your choice, too. But sometimes, when we allow ourselves to be sad and we tell somebody about it, sometimes it makes it better. Maybe.",
        "Sage: Daddy --",
        "Jack: It's not fair. I know, Honey. I know it's not fair. And you have every reason to be good and mad. You do. But being sad, that doesn't mean you're not tough. And you are one tough kid. I'm so proud of you.",
        "Sage: I don't feel tough. Sometimes --",
        "Jack: Sometimes --",
        "Sage: Sometimes I feel like I'll never see her again.",
        "Jack: You know, I'm mad at your mommy, too, right?",
        "Sage: Yeah.",
        "Jack: But as mad as I get, I know, Sage -- I know this. I know she will never stop working on seeing you again. She loves you that much. There is nothing on this earth that'll keep her away from you forever.",
        "Sage: I miss her.",
        "Jack: I miss her, too. I really, really do.",
        "Sage: Now I feel stupid!",
        "Jack: Don't -- don't feel stupid, Honey. You're blue, that's all. And me, when I'm blue, I go to Al's and get myself a grilled cheese sandwich and a chocolate shake. But that's just me. That's how I roll. That's how Daddy stays Daddy.",
        "Sage: You're not going to make me go to school?",
        "Jack: No. Emma, I've got Sage. We're taking the day off. We're going to pig out and do anything she wants to do.",
        "Sage: Yeah!",
        "Jack: Anything she wants to do except what I don't want her to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: We'll make it a contest.",
        "Katie: Make what a contest?",
        "Brad: Taking us home. We'll call it \"Win a day with Brad and Katie.\"",
        "Katie: \"Katie and Brad.\" And no.",
        "Brad: Oh, come on! No, come on! This is a great idea. We can announce on air that people should send us postcards, you know, telling us why we should visit them in their hometown. You know, and then we'll have, you know, like a drawing. And then whoever wins takes us home as the prize!",
        "Katie: Absolutely not.",
        "Brad: You know what, Kim? You see her response? That proves it's a great idea.",
        "Katie: All right. What do we do once we get there? \"Hey, winners, congratulations. You're so very lucky, you get to have these two people sit on your couch all day.\"",
        "Brad: What, you think we should do something while we're there?",
        "Katie: I don't think we should be there in the first place!",
        "Brad: Wait a minute -- wait a minute, wait a minute. That gives me a great idea.",
        "Katie: Oh, oh, I have a good idea, too.",
        "Brad: Yeah?",
        "Katie: I go get lunch, and Kim tells you how stupid your idea is.",
        "Kim: Glad to see that that agreeing with each other was only temporary.",
        "Katie: By the way, I just want to go on the record. I'm not against the idea just because it came from a fan letter. I think letters can be very helpful, actually.",
        "Kim: So do I.",
        "Katie: Someone does need to do something about his hair.",
        "Brad: Kim -- Kim, we've really got to do this. We really have got to do this contest thing.",
        "Kim: You really think it's that good an idea?",
        "Brad: I don't know. I don't know. All I know is that we work best when she's really ticked off. And they say, strike while the iron is hot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, what is this sweet sense of deja vu? Oh, do what I want and everything will be all right.",
        "Craig: I didn't say everything would be all right. I said you could keep your company.",
        "Lucinda: If what?",
        "Craig: If you tell me where Lucy and Johnny are.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my heavens. I mean, that's taken me by surprise. I never thought we'd go there. Darling, you got to admit this man is -- he's single-minded.",
        "Craig: Tell me where they are.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know.",
        "Craig: Right. All that time spent in Montega with Sierra and the topic never came up?",
        "Lucinda: I didn't say that. I said that I didn't know. And I'm happy, because I don't want to know.",
        "Craig: Right.",
        "Lucinda: Because then I might -- it might slip out of me. And I don't want you to ever know where they are from me, even inadvertently.",
        "Craig: They are my children.",
        "Lucinda: Well, as somebody on the Supreme Court said, paternity is not a blank check.",
        "Craig: Oh, and so that's your call to make?",
        "Lucinda: Yes. Because I love them, and I'll do anything I can to save them from you.",
        "Craig: Well, \"Anything\" doesn't mean that it's some sort of figure of speech. \"Anything\" means that you lose this company. Now! \"Anything\" means that you are out on your emeritus.",
        "Lucinda: You're enjoying this, aren't you?",
        "Craig: Oh, yes I am. Because your demise is so very richly deserved.",
        "Lily: I thought you were my friend. I thought you were trying to help me. You weren't trying to help me. You were just trying to use me to get to my mother.",
        "Craig: I was trying -- I was trying to get my children back.",
        "Lucinda: And you failed at that, once again.",
        "Craig: And what difference does it make what my motives are? I made you an offer, you accepted it. No one forced you.",
        "Lily: Something horrible happened to me, and you used it. You waited until I was vulnerable, and then you kicked me when I was down!",
        "Craig: When you say something horrible happened to you, isn't that a bit evasive?",
        "Lucinda: Don't, Craig.",
        "Craig: Huh? Something horrible happened to those children, Lily.",
        "Lily: You planned this.",
        "Craig: Really?",
        "Lily: Yes, you told me. You told me, keep going after the baby food company.",
        "Craig: And how could I foresee how bad you were going to handle it?",
        "Lucinda: Don\ufffdt. Just go, right now!",
        "Craig: All right. That's the last order you're going to give me. Oh, and just a little -- a bit of irony -- all the years that you passed judgment on me, made pronouncements about how I'm not good enough for your family, good enough for your children, your daughter -- look at your daughter now. Nice job of parenting.",
        "Lucinda: He certainly is a vile, vile man, Dear.",
        "Lily: No, but he's right. This is all my fault. He's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: You only like movies where cars blow up.",
        "Jack: Okay, so we'll go to the one where the girl finds out she's a princess.",
        "Sage: No, you'd hate that. Hey, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hey, Guys. Why are you fighting? And why aren't you in school?",
        "Jack: Oh -- teacher conferences.",
        "Sage: Yeah. Excuse me. I need to go wash my hands.",
        "Katie: Oh, did I say something wrong?",
        "Jack: No, no, it's not your fault. They're having one of those mother/kid days at school, so she's a little freaked out.",
        "Katie: Ew, that's so insensitive of them.",
        "Jack: No, it's not that bad. Here have a -- sit down, please. No, Sage tries to act like everything's fine. At least this got her talking about Carly.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah?",
        "Jack: Yeah. And I had the early shift, so now we we're going to spend the afternoon together. Which is great, but --",
        "Katie: But, what?",
        "Jack: Well, once we're through with the grilled cheese, it's not like we have a lot of common interests, if you know what I mean.",
        "Katie: Why, what do you mean?",
        "Jack: Well, she scoffed at my idea of making a model airplane.",
        "Katie: No!",
        "Jack: Well, yeah. [Jack laughs] We can't decide on a movie. So, it looks like I'm going to be dragged to one of those places where you design your own teddy bear or something.",
        "Katie: Jack, you can not ask that of yourself. Although, I would love to see you with the little teddy bear accessories.",
        "Jack: Those damned caps and mittens --",
        "Katie: But don't they have those little sweet hearts that say \"I wuv you\"?",
        "Jack: All right. Well, a man's got to do what a man's got to do. Right?",
        "Katie: Rough.",
        "Jack: Hey. All right, I came up with the perfect idea.",
        "Katie: No, excuse me. It was my idea. You're coming back to the studio with me to the hair and makeup department for a full makeover. [Both together] We are?",
        "Katie: Yes! Well, unless you'd rather build a model airplane.",
        "Sage: Katie, thanks!",
        "Jack: Katie, thanks.",
        "Katie: Hey, it's just my ploy to be able to hang out with two really cool people. Are you going to finish that grilled cheese? Mmm!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: What about Gwen?",
        "Casey: I'm sure Will is inside with Gwen and everything is fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: No, no, no, no, no!",
        "Will: Gwen, get out of here!",
        "Adam: You're going to pay for that.",
        "Gwen: Will!",
        "Will: That is the last time, Adam -- the last time you ever threaten my wife.",
        "Gwen: Will, no!",
        "Will: Actually, as a matter of fact, that is the last time you ever bother anybody anymore.",
        "Gwen: Will, put it down!",
        "Will: No. You know what I see when I look at you? I don't see my brother. I don't know where he is. All I see is the pig who tried to rape my wife.",
        "Adam: I -- I wouldn't --",
        "Will: You wouldn't what?",
        "Adam: I wouldn't do that.",
        "Will: And by that you mean rape her?",
        "Adam: I didn't do that, I swear.",
        "Will: Gwen, get out of here. Go find Casey and leave us alone.",
        "Gwen: No.",
        "Will: Gwen, this is between me and my brother.",
        "Gwen: No, we go get Casey together. Put down the knife!",
        "Will: No, I don't think so. Because right now it's the knife that's got his attention. Isn't it, Adam? You're going to listen to me, won't you? Won't you?",
        "Adam: Yeah.",
        "Will: That's good, because we've got a lot to talk about, like how much fun it was for you going after my wife. How much fun it was using my money to go after my wife.",
        "Adam: Nothing happened!",
        "Will: Yeah, nothing happened. That's right. She didn't want you. And that made you crazy, didn't it?",
        "Adam: I was crazy, all right?",
        "Will: No, no, no, no. I'm the crazy one, aren't I? I do the crazy things. You're fine. You're all grown up and organized. But you really screwed up this time, didn't you? Everyone's going to know how sick you are. But you couldn't just leave without coming after her one more time. And if sweet talk and trips to L.A. didn't work, then why not use brute force?",
        "Adam: Look, I didn't do that.",
        "Will: No, because Maddie stopped you. But now it's my turn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I don't think we should make any final decisions until we talk to Camille. You can show her what you like from the magazines, and then she'll tell you if it goes with your coloring and facial structure --",
        "Jack: Oh, I can't believe this. You guys have been talking about makeup for a half an hour straight. What do you know about makeup?",
        "Katie: You could talk about hockey for twice as long about a game that happened three years ago!",
        "Jack: Ah, yes, but that's important.",
        "Katie: Yeah, really important.",
        "Sage: You talk to him like you talk to Uncle Brad on TV.",
        "Katie: You watch our show?",
        "Sage: Aunt Emma tapes it. I watch it when I get home from school.",
        "Katie: Oh, I knew I loved this kid. Oh, Camille, come here. I want you to meet two very important people. This is Jack and Sage Snyder.",
        "Camille: Snyder?",
        "Katie: Yes, they are Brad's brother and niece. And yes, they are sane. I promise. So, Sage had a little bit of a bad day. And you know what cures a bad day better than anything? [Both together] Makeover!",
        "Katie: So, you go together and do some makeover stuff, and we'll see you soon.",
        "Sage: Are you coming, Daddy?",
        "Jack: I'll be right there, okay?",
        "Sage: Great.",
        "Jack: All right.",
        "Katie: Have fun! Actually, you know what I was just thinking? Making you go into hair and makeup was probably just as bad as making you go to that stuffed animal store.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Do you have any idea what it's like to see a smile on her face? Thank you, Katie. Really, thank you.",
        "Katie: You know, when things go wrong, just find a good shallow person --",
        "Jack: Shallow, right.",
        "Brad: Did you get your lunch?",
        "Katie: Yep.",
        "Brad: Good, because you're usually nicer after you have something eat.",
        "Katie: You really know how to get someone on your side, don't you?",
        "Brad: Hey, you know what? I really listened to you about how we should do something when we go to the winner's house.",
        "Katie: No, I said we shouldn't go to the winner's house at all!",
        "Brad: It got me thinking -- you know how we're always arguing about housework and cleaning and stuff?",
        "Katie: We're always arguing about everything.",
        "Brad: Right, okay, so, whoever wins -- we'll do a chore for them. Something they've been putting off.",
        "Katie: A chore?",
        "Brad: Yeah, we'll take a camera crew with us. And we'll clean, we'll fix something. It'll be like one of those reality shows. It'll make their day.",
        "Katie: Are you nuts?",
        "Brad: Katie. Just a day. And then you can come back to your world of giving orders and getting manicures.",
        "Katie: A chore?",
        "Brad: All right, hey, you know what? It's just an idea. But, you know, we're partners. So maybe you need some time to think about it.",
        "Katie: I don't need time to think about it. I told you, I don't like it.",
        "Brad: Now, wait. Now, wait. Now, I won't say anything to Kim. You know? And -- you know, we'll put off talking about it until you come to your senses. Or -- okay, until you feel more comfortable.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: So, no matter if we end up doing it or not, it's up to me? It's my choice?",
        "Brad: I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Kim: Hey, you guys. I just finished the production meeting. Everybody is in love with the idea of the contest. We're going to go with it ASAP.",
        "Katie: Right. My choice?",
        "Brad: I wanted you to think it was.",
        "Kim: What, you didn't know about this? You told me you called her and she changed her mind.",
        "Katie: He didn't call me! But I love it.",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Katie: Unlike you, Snyder, I can recognize a good idea, no matter where it comes from. Even if I've been manipulated and lied to.",

        "Lily: But it doesn't change anything. I know.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, what has to change now is you. You! You can't just say it. You can't say that you're sorry. You can't say that you want to change, and blah, blah. You've been saying things and promising things, and lying. And lying, Dear.",
        "Lily: I know. I know what I've done. And I know this doesn't mean anything to you right now, but I will do everything in my power to reverse this.",

        "Adam: It was payback! They tried to kill me. She tried to bury me alive!",
        "Casey: Well, you're going to leave her out of this! You came home for your father's funeral. Will, and me, your brothers, we welcomed you home, and look what you did to us. Don't even get me started on what you did to Mom. So, maybe you better stop blaming Gwen and Maddie for trying to protect themselves, and ask yourself what the hell happened to you.",
        "Maddie: It was you who did all those things to us.",

        "Casey: Yeah, but you're the only one you're worried about.",
        "Adam: I didn't make you steal those bonds.",
        "Casey: Whoa, whoa. You think I don't know how much this is my fault? How I hurt the people that I love? Man, look, what I really think you should do is go to hell. But you know what I really want you to do? I want you to just go away.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Casey: Look, Will, just -- if he goes away, then no one has to know about --",
        "Maddie: About what I did.",

        "Will: Ever!",
        "Adam: I didn't kill anyone. And I didn't steal anything, and you two still think you're better than me.",
        "Casey: What happened to him?",
        "Will: I think when Dad died he might have just snapped.",

        "Katie: Oh, yeah, right. Jack, it means a lot to me that you would let me be her friend. I'm sure I'm not at the top of your list for a female role model. The truth is, Mike was your friend, and you know what I did to Carly, and the fact you would put up with me for Sage's sake, it's just --",

        "Casey: No, but you sure helped Adam scare the hell out of them!",
        "Jade: I got knocked out when I tried to stop him from hurting Gwen!",

        "Lily: No, no, absolutely not! It's not that way. You know, you could tie both of her hands behind her back, put a blindfold on her and put her in the ring with you, and I would still pick her. She's not going to take this sitting down.",
        "Craig: There's nothing she can do.",

        "Lucinda: You had a bad day too?",
        "Emma: Yeah. I always thought that once your children were raised and educated and pursuing careers of their own, that you could stop worrying about them. Yeah, I thought maybe I'd even have a little time to myself.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, where do we ever get that idea? Will you please tell me, because I'd like to know.",
        "Emma: You know, my daughter, Meg, she works here. I really don't know what she's doing with her life. She's a beautiful, warm, intelligent woman. And she's completely ruined all her chances of -- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't know what's gotten into me today --",
        "Lucinda: No, please, don't apologize to me. I've got a beautiful, intelligent, warm daughter who's making whopping big mistakes.",
        "Emma: You know, Lily feels terrible about what happened.",
        "Lucinda: Well, she should. And she's going to feel much worse after what I've said to her today. [Lucinda sighs] Thank you, Dear.",
        "Emma: Vanilla, huh? Do the trick?",
        "Lucinda: Usually, it's just what the doctor ordered. But somehow, today, it really isn't hitting the spot. You know, I'm to blame. You know? Because -- for not realizing Lily was not up to that kind of challenge.",
        "Emma: Lucinda, come on, now. Take it easy on yourself. You know, I think you were just trying to show Lily that you had faith in her. I mean, everyone knew, everyone could see she was feeling insecure. And you were only trying to give her a vote of confidence. I think what you did was a really, really -- it was a good impulse. You're a very, very loving mother.",
