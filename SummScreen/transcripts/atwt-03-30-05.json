        "Celia: Wasn't Alison supposed to be here by now?",
        "Will: She's not that late. She'll be here.",
        "Celia: She better be. I told my brother it was going to be the four of us. If he finds out that it's just you, me and Casey, I'm going to be in trouble.",
        "Will: Alison is not going to leave you in a lurch. She knows that if Rafael found out you were out on a date alone without a chaperone, that you and Casey would be dead in the water.",
        "Alison: Hi, sorry!",
        "Will: See? There she is.",
        "Alison: Oh! Oh, oh! It's just a little spill. It happens all the time. See? It's like it never even happened. So, where's Casey?",
        "Celia: Powdering his nose. You look great, Ali.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Celia: I love that color on you.",
        "Will: Yeah, it's really nice.",
        "Casey: Hey, how's it going?",
        "Gwen: Good. You?",
        "Casey: Good. Alison, congratulations. You finally made it. Let's have a toast.",
        "Celia: To our first date?",
        "Casey: To Alison -- for making it possible.",
        "Will: To Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Les: Well, ain't you a sight for sore eyes. Come here, boy. Give your daddy a hug.",
        "Jack: Parker, why don't you take a seat at the table? And why don't you back up and give him some space?",
        "Les: All right. I think he's just a little bit shy. You haven't forgotten about me, have you, J.J.?",
        "Keith: It's going to take years of therapy for that.",
        "Les: I'd forgotten what a funny guy you are, Keith. Look, I'm not here to start trouble.",
        "Keith: Well, that's a first.",
        "Les: I'm only here to see my son.",
        "Keith: What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in prison. Who let you out?",
        "Les: Free man. I had a lot of time to think about all the ways I messed up over the years. But I've paid my debt I'm a changed man.",
        "Jack: If I had a dime for every time I heard that --",
        "Les: Like I said, I'm not here to start any trouble. I've got a fresh start and I want to make the most of it. I lost my wife. I lost a lot of time. But I'm here to recover what I can my family and that'd be J.J.",
        "Jack: J.J. isn't going anywhere.",
        "Keith: Not today, not ever.",
        "Les: Well, um, you guys are wrong about that. The law's on my side, for once. So why don't you step aside and let me have my boy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily's refusing all attempts to help her. Jessica's trying to get her to plea bargain, or plead not guilty by reason of insanity, but she wants to plead guilty to premeditated murder.",
        "Lucinda: Premeditated?",
        "Holden: And we're supposed to believe that Lily sent that letter to Julia, threatening her. And the letter showed up last minute, under very strange circumstances. But she insists that it's real.",
        "Lucinda: Well, that can't be. There's no way that my daughter would deliberately be responsible for this woman's death.",
        "Holden: But she's going around telling anyone who will listen that she is.",
        "Lucinda: What about you, darling? You're in the middle of it all. What do you believe?",
        "Holden: Honestly? I don't know what to believe anymore.",
        "Lucinda: Well, then maybe you should just stop right now. Stop and desist, and don't try to help her so much. Because, it seems to me, what you're doing is making things worse, not better.",
        "Holden: What are you talking about? I have been trying to do anything I can possibly --",
        "Lucinda: To ensure that she goes to prison? Is that what you really want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. You can tell the judge whatever you want. But right here, right now, when it's just us, I think I deserve the truth.",
        "Lily: We've been over this a million times.",
        "Carly: Well, it's a little muddy now, isn't it? I think we should clear it up. Tell me what happened that night?",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Carly: Because I think that it might help to talk about it. You can lie to everyone else about it, but you can't lie to yourself. And you can't lie to me. Lily, you are one of the most honest people I know. It's got to be killing you to keep all this inside.",
        "Lily: You're right. There are a few things I really should get off my chest. Things that I haven't told anybody about what happened that night.",
        "Carly: You can tell me anything. You know that.",
        "Lily: I was just afraid to tell anybody because I didn't think anybody would believe me, but I will tell you the whole story. Because someone should know the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Do you really believe that I want the mother of my children locked away?",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lucinda: It's just that I've seen precious little evidence of you being willing to put up a real fight.",
        "Holden: You know what? The arraignment is in a little while. I'm not going to stand here and defend myself.",
        "Lucinda: I mean, you say you don't know what you believe. Isn't that like admitting that you think that your wife committed murder?",
        "Holden: She swears that she did it.",
        "Lucinda: I don't care what she says. There's more to this, much more to this. And if you don't have the stomach to search for the truth, then I think you better step aside! Particularly as you are the one who's started this conflagration.",
        "Holden: I have tried to get her to tell the truth. But she shuts down. She doesn't want anyone to help her out. So what are we supposed to do?",
        "Lucinda: We just got to get her to admit what she's really doing. She's trying to protect Luke.",
        "Holden: Or maybe it's the other way around. Luke tried to plead guilty. Maybe he's trying to protect his mother.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, okay. Well, let's disagree on that. We'll agree on disagreeing? Okay? In the mean time, you and I, we've got to do something and we've got to do it quickly, or they'll lock her up and throw away the key. And I don't know about you, but I know that I can't live with myself if i don't do my utmost to help my daughter. I don't care what you believe! You just keep believing it. But I'm not going to let my daughter be locked away, not without a fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Les: Come here, J.J. let me take a good look at you. Oh! What happened to your leg, buddy? Somebody want to tell me what happened here? Hmm?",
        "Keith: He had a little accident.",
        "Les: A little accident? Really? It looks like a pretty big accident. Seems to me he needs better care than he's been getting. He needs his daddy. Isn't that right, J.J.?",
        "J.J.: It's not their fault I got hurt. Leave us alone.",
        "Les: Maybe I wasn't a perfect person before. But my boy never broke any bones when we were together. Now if a judge thinks I'm a fit parent, then, by God, I'm a fit parent. That's pretty good reading over there, isn't it, Jack?",
        "Jack: It's an amendment to the old custody agreement he had with Julia. Now that she's gone, he gets sole custody.",
        "Keith: You think I'm going to let him run off with my nephew --",
        "Jack: All I said was that the paper was legal. Listen, you would've saved yourself a lot of time if you just would have made one phone call.",
        "Les: Ho!",
        "Jack: You're not going anywhere with J.J.",
        "Les: Man, I don't know how you have any say in this, being that you're not blood related. And Uncle Keith, here? [Les sighs] you never had the time of day for J.J. till you found out he inherited all that money from his grandparents. You see, Keith, he was always a busy man, busy guy running off, flying off places. Now I may not be father of the year, but I've always loved that boy.",
        "Keith: Yeah. Well, you showed him by treating his mother like a punching bag. You put her in the hospital. You almost killed her. She couldn't get away from you fast enough.",
        "Les: Way I remember it, she couldn't get away from you fast enough, flyboy.",
        "Keith: She didn't want J.J. anywhere near you. She wanted him with me.",
        "Les: It doesn't matter. I got it -- I got it in writing! J.J.'s mine. And he's coming with me, whether you like it --",
        "J.J.: No! Just stop it. Make them stop fighting, please, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So, what did I miss?",
        "Casey: Nothing much. We were just about to order some --",
        "Gwen: You guys want to order some food?",
        "Casey: Maybe later. Thanks.",
        "Alison: Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Oh, no way. Alison Stewart, you look so different.",
        "Alison: So do you. I love the hair. The last time I saw you --",
        "Gwen: Oh, yeah. Don't even talk about it. That was another lifetime. I've evolved.",
        "Alison: Her mom works at Memorial, too. I haven't seen you in centuries. When did you start working here?",
        "Gwen: Just a couple weeks ago. I'm just doing it to make some extra bucks in between singing gigs.",
        "Celia: You're a singer?",
        "Gwen: I do it all. I've got a band now. All chicks -- The Itty Bitty Kitty Crew.",
        "Celia: What a great name. I love it.",
        "Alison: Oh, Gwen, this is Celia and Will, and this is Casey.",
        "Gwen: We've met.",
        "Casey: Yeah, we've already said hello.",
        "Celia: I think I've seen you around school. In the cafeteria maybe?",
        "Gwen: I try not to eat there if can help it, but sometimes you got to do what you got to do. [Bell rings] oh, that's me. Order's up. I'll be back.",
        "Celia: She's so cool. Maybe we can go see her band play some night.",
        "Casey: You don't even know if they're any good.",
        "Celia: Why wouldn't they be?",
        "Casey: I'm just saying I can think of a lot of other things I'd like to do. Back me up here, buddy. Do you want to see some girl band?",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. Whatever. Alison, I was thinking --",
        "Alison: Hold that thought. I'll be back in a flash.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You were right. I didn't tell the whole truth when I confessed.",
        "Carly: Tell me now.",
        "Lily: It was awful. Carly, it was so horrible.",
        "Carly: Hey. It's going to be all right. Really.",
        "Lily: And it stays between us?",
        "Carly: You know I only want what's best for you.",
        "Lily: You were right all along. I was struggling with Julia, she fell and she hit her head. It was an accident. And I went to find you because I knew you would understand. I knew you would help me.",
        "Carly: I'm still here. Tell me.",
        "Lily: She was alive. When I left her, her eyes were open. She was talking.",
        "Carly: Well, there's no way you could've killed her, then.",
        "Lily: That's not the entire story.",
        "Carly: There's more?",
        "Lily: So much more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You know, Les, all this noise about you changing your life -- why don't you start with not scaring your kid. Back it up and tone it down. The kid lost his mom. The last thing he needs to see is you going at it with his uncle.",
        "Les: J.J., listen, I'm sorry. I -- I -- I didn't mean for you to see that. It's just -- son, I miss you. I miss you so much and I want us to -- I want us to be together. You know, like before. No, no -- not like before. Better than before. Better than before, J.J. see, I promise. I got you something. When I was away, I got a present for you.",
        "J.J.: I don't want it. That's for babies.",
        "Les: Okay. Big man, I didn't know how much you'd grown up. But I guess you've been through a lot, haven't you? And that's -- that's to be expected. Look, I think you and I just need some -- some more time together, J.J. Just to get used to each other, you know? I haven't -- I haven't stopped loving you. You haven't forgot that, have you?",
        "J.J.: You hurt my mom!",
        "Les: I know. I know. And I'll regret that for the rest of my life, JJ. I was -- I was sick when I did that. It was terrible to do that. But I never stopped loving you. Or your mom. That's why I left. I went away. And then -- and I tried to help myself. I tried to learn things. And one of the things I learned was this thing called anger management.",
        "J.J.: What's that?",
        "Les: Well, it's like -- it's like when you go to school, you know? And, and it's a school for me so I can learn to be a better dad. I learned how to -- how to control myself so I wouldn't do all those bad things I used to do.",
        "J.J.: Like hitting people?",
        "Les: Uh-huh. I don't need to do that anymore. Okay? I don't. And I want you to know that. And I want your mom to know that. But then that -- that horrible thing happened to her. And son, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Now, we'll always be sad about that, won't we? But you see, we've got each other. You and me. You and me can be a family together, J.J. everything's going to change. Everything. I promise. I've got papers. It's legal. You're coming with me, buddy.",
        "J.J.: No. No! Just go away!",
        "Keith: Okay, come on. You heard the boy. Go ahead. Come on, get out of here.",
        "Les: You know what, I've got a few suggestions.",
        "Jack: Before this gets out of hand, why don't we just talk about this -- assess the situation.",
        "Les: Okay, here's the situation -- cop, okay? He's my son. All right? Get that through your head. He's my son and you're trying to keep me from him.",
        "Keith: We're doing what's best for J.J. Which means we're not going to let him go with you.",
        "Les: Yeah. See, I figured old money-hungry Keith here wouldn't want to cooperate. So I took some precautions. He's here to make sure you fellows uphold the law.",
        "Federal Marshall: Is there a problem here, gentlemen?",
        "Les: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, see, I showed these guys my documents, and I told them I was here to collect my son, and they won't -- they won't give him to me.",
        "Jack: I'm a detective here in town.",
        "Federal Marshall: Well then, you know what has to be done.",
        "Jack: No, and you should know that this guy is a three-time loser with a rap sheet like you wouldn't believe. He abused his wife in front of the kid.",
        "Les: Why do you have to bring that up in front of the kid, huh?",
        "Keith: Because you did it. You abused his mother in front of him. You did the damage.",
        "Federal Marshall: Look, I'm here to enforce the letter of the law, not pass judgments.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? The law's wrong here.",
        "Federal Marshall: Why don't we just take it easy on the kid and hand him over to his father?",
        "Keith: Or what's going to happen?",
        "Federal Marshall: Or I can make this a lot tougher for everyone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey. We were just about to order. So, what'll it be? My treat.",
        "Alison: Oh, that is too sweet. But since I'm the one who's responsible for the date tonight, it's only fair that I foot the bill. So I've already told Gwen to put everything on my tab.",
        "Casey: You didn't have to do that.",
        "Alison: I wanted to. So you guys, pig out and order whatever you like.",
        "Celia: Thanks, Ali.",
        "Casey: I hope you're sure about this, though. Have you seen what Will here can put away?",
        "Will: Me? This guy, he can eat a whole foot-long sub and then a pizza to boot.",
        "Casey: What can I say? I'm a growing boy. But don't worry, Ali. I'll try to keep the gorging to a minimum.",
        "Will: So, what do you want to do? We could go see a movie, or go bowling, go the mall -- whatever.",
        "Alison: Actually, Aaron's a little understaffed tonight. I really ought to go lend a hand.",
        "Celia: You're not staying?",
        "Alison: I wish I could, but Metro's really, really busy.",
        "Celia: What's my brother going to say when he finds out you're not hanging out with us?",
        "Alison: Oh, don't worry about it. I've got it covered. I found the perfect person to take my place.",
        "Will: You did what? What is this?",
        "Alison: Don't freak out or anything. She's totally cool, super cute and she knows about your past. She's totally cool about it.",
        "Will: Alison, I don't like it when you do this stuff.",
        "Alison: And tonight, the role of Alison Stewart will be played by the gorgeous Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Thanks. I'm so psyched to be off my feet.",
        "Alison: Okay. You guys be good, have fun. See you later.",
        "Celia: Bye.",
        "Gwen: Bye.",
        "Casey: So what looks good today, Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Getting the heck out of here. So, what are you guys up for?",
        "Celia: I don't know. Have any ideas?",
        "Gwen: Definitely. You want to go hear some music?",
        "Celia: Is there dancing?",
        "Casey: I don't dance.",
        "Celia: You will after I get through with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Just tell me one thing. How does it help Lily if you paint me out to be the villain?",
        "Lucinda: Well, darling, you're hardly the hero. And you haven't been a husband to her in -- in quite some time. So if anyone's going to save her, i don't think it's going to be you.",
        "Holden: It's not going to be Jessica either. Because Lily is ignoring all of her advice.",
        "Lucinda: Jessica shouldn't even consult with Lily! She's in no state of mind to make any decisions! She's drowning. She's a drowning girl. She's going to drag down all her lifeguards down with her.",
        "Holden: So, what are you proposing? That I knock her unconscious and drag her out to shore?",
        "Lucinda: Yes! Yes. If it'll work. What? What?",
        "Holden: Jess, its Holden. Do you have a minute?",
        "Jessica: I'm prepping for Lily's arraignment.",
        "Holden: Any change?",
        "Jessica: No, she still plans to plead guilty.",
        "Holden: Where are you?",
        "Jessica: The courthouse.",
        "Holden: I have an idea. Stay right where you are. I'm on my way.",
        "Lucinda: I'm coming with you. I coming.",
        "Holden: All right. I'll explain everything to you on the way.",
        "Lucinda: Is this -- is this going to work?",
        "Holden: I don't know. I'm hoping it will. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: There's something I never told you. I never told anyone because I didn't think anyone would believe me. That's why I left him out of it.",
        "Carly: Him who?",
        "Lily: I guess you could call him my accomplice. While I was at your house trying to get you to help me, he was at Julia's, making sure she was dead.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God, Lily.",
        "Lily: I didn't mean for that to happen. And I don't know if he read my mind, or he knew it had to be done, so he did it.",
        "Carly: But who was it?",
        "Lily: I have to know that this will never go any further. I promised him I would leave him out of it. I don't want him to retaliate.",
        "Carly: I'll make sure that you're safe. Just tell me.",
        "Lily: His name -- is Casper.",
        "Carly: Like the ghost?",
        "Lily: Yeah. But he's not friendly. He has a really bad temper.",
        "Carly: What -- is this supposed to be funny?",
        "Lily: Well, what about this? What is this supposed to be, Carly? What is this about? I thought you were supposed to be my friend. With friends like you, I'm safer here in prison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Carly: What would Rose think if she could see you throw your life away like this? You have to fight, Lily! You have to tell the truth!",
        "Jessica: If Lily goes in there and pleads guilty, it's over. If we exercise this option, at least maybe we can buy some time to try to get through to her or find out who the real killer is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Give me that!",
        "Lily: Did you get all the information that you needed? Oh, I hope the sound quality is good. For those of you who don't get it, I killed Julia Larrabee because she was a witch and she deserved to die. You satisfied?",
        "Carly: I was just trying to --",
        "Lily: What? If you say help me, I will scream.",
        "Carly: Just give me the recorder. No! Hey! That's not even mine.",
        "Lily: Was it Jack's? Or was it your idea? I guess you decided to save your family, you had to destroy mine.",
        "Carly: Oh, I think you're doing okay with that by yourself. Now that your children have to grow up without you!",
        "Lily: Just shut up! Shut up and stay out of it!",
        "Carly: I'm in it! I was in it the moment you came and asked me for help! And I'm trying to help you the right way!",
        "Lily: There's absolutely nothing you can do for me now.",
        "Carly: What would Rose think if she could see you throw your life away like this? You have to fight, Lily! You have to tell the truth!",
        "Cop #1: Lily Snyder -- time for your arraignment.",
        "Lily: Let's get this over with.",
        "Cop #1: They'll come after you in a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Ah. I was just thinking about you.",
        "Alison: Good thoughts?",
        "Aaron: Good thoughts? What is the fun in that?",
        "Alison: I can't wait to hear all about it.",
        "Aaron: Oh, believe me, you will. What are you doing here? I thought you chaperoning the teeny bopper crowd.",
        "Alison: Well, every -- everybody was getting along great. Everything was good, so I thought I'd come by in case you needed me.",
        "Aaron: You are so sweet. I can't even tell you. But it doesn't matter because I've got someone coming in to cover us.",
        "Alison: I didn't say Metro needed me. I was talking about you.",
