        "Emma: Oh, Lily, you're just in time to taste the soup. I think I put too much salt in it.",
        "Lily: Oh, no thanks.",
        "Emma: I made the most wonderful apple cake there. You know what? With the baby feeling better and -- oh, Holden called. He thinks he's going to come home a little sooner.",
        "Lily: What? He's on his way home?",
        "Emma: Yes.",
        "Lily: Right now?",
        "Emma: Lily, what's wrong?",
        "Lily: I just thought I'd have a little more time, that's all.",
        "Emma: Well, I hope I haven't ruined a surprise.",
        "Lily: I couldn't take any more surprises right now, Emma.",
        "Emma: Lily, what's wrong?",
        "Lily: I've ruined everything. I've let down everybody that I love.",
        "Emma: Come on, now, that's not true.",
        "Lily: Yes, it is true. When Holden comes home, he's going to find out what kind of a failure I really am.",

        "Craig: Thank you for coming on such short notice, Mr. Buchanan. I really appreciate it. Mrs. Shephard, thank you. Mr. Considine. Please, everybody have a seat. Notice the media layout outlining our new and fresh start and the latest P and l's. I know, they seem a little bleak at the moment, but they're --",
        "Dusty: What the hell's going on?",
        "Craig: You don't recognize your own board members or did the old lady not give you a seat at the table?",
        "Dusty: Answer the question.",
        "Craig: Please, Dusty. You already have a real bad case of corporate jitters.",
        "Dusty: Uh-huh, I'd like to talk to them.",
        "Craig: Well, that's not going to happen.",
        "Dusty: Where's Lucinda?",
        "Craig: She's terminated, effective immediately.",
        "Dusty: These people are loyal to Lucinda.",
        "Craig: They are loyal to a bottom line that's healthy.",
        "Dusty: These people won't even talk to you. What are you talking about?",
        "Craig: I can do whatever I want. I'm the boss.",

        "Will: Hey. It's just me. You okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. What are we going to do now?",
        "Casey: You're going to go home.",
        "Will: Are you sure?",
        "Casey: Yeah. Adam's gone. Jade's not going to say and there's no reason you can't go back.",
        "Maddie: I can think of a couple.",
        "Will: We don't need to make any decision right now.",
        "Gwen: I don't think I can face everybody.",
        "Will: Then we don't.",
        "Gwen: I mean, how do we explain to your parents that we were prepared to let them live the rest of their life not knowing if their son was alive or dead.",
        "Maddie: If you tell the whole truth, they'll know what Adam tried to do to her.",
        "Casey: Look, you guys are free, all right? There's no charges against you guys. We'll tell my parents what they need to know -- not everything -- but enough so they can stop looking for Adam.",
        "Maddie: What about you?",
        "Casey: I'm going too.",
        "Maddie: Casey, you said it yourself, you jumped bail. You're not just going to breeze through this. You can go to prison.",
        "Casey: The charges are my problem.",
        "Maddie: No, they're our problem. Listen, if you guys want to go back, you can, but Casey and I are packing up and heading for Canada.",
        "Will: No, the plan was that we stick together.",
        "Casey: That was before we knew Adam was alive, all right? The plan's changed.",
        "Maddie: We don't get a vote?",
        "Gwen: Casey, every single one of us here is guilty of something. Why should we get off and you go to jail?",
        "Casey: No, get it through your guys' heads. None of this would have happened unless I had that problem gambling, all right? I committed the crime.",
        "Will: Yeah, and Adam committed a worse crime, which was violent. So who's more guilty?",
        "Casey: You know what? That's not fair to you guys.",
        "Will: Who are you to say what's fair for us?",
        "Casey: My mom's not going to stop looking for me.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, we'll stay on the move.",
        "Casey: I'm going to be attached to those charges for the rest of my life.",
        "Maddie: No, technically just a few years.",
        "Casey: Well, that's a long time to live on nothing.",
        "Will: So, we'll get jobs.",
        "Casey: Will, I know how to spin music, okay? That's not a great resume. Besides, you shouldn't be looking for a crummy job, you should be finishing your degree.",
        "Will: What, they don't have colleges in Canada?",
        "Casey: What about Gwen's music?",
        "Gwen: If I have to, I'll spend a few years writing the greatest songs I write. Just won't be able to sing them, that's all.",
        "Casey: You guys are the best. I love that you would do this for me, but as long as you're with me, it's called aiding and abetting. So thanks for the offer, but I can't bring you guys down with me.",

        "Dusty: Another glass.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, hi. Take a pew.",
        "Dusty: So what is this, surrender?",
        "Lucinda: No. I'm circling the wagons.",
        "Dusty: Well, the rest of your wagons are sitting down with Montgomery right now in your boardroom.",
        "Lucinda: He didn't waste much time, did he? Have they gone over to the dark side yet?",
        "Dusty: Hey, it's hard to convince him not to with all these lawsuits.",
        "Lucinda: There's Craig in there just making promises and promises.",
        "Dusty: I wasn't even allowed in.",
        "Lucinda: No! Have a drink. Hey, come on. Take the bottle. Let's have a few drinks.",
        "Dusty: Nick Marshall told me something.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah? Has he rolled?",
        "Dusty: Probably. He said Craig has a -- a bail out plan, you know, to save the company.",
        "Lucinda: The only thing he knows how to save is his own rear end.",
        "Dusty: You've got plenty of collateral. We'll get your company back.",
        "Lucinda: According to Craig, I could get it back today if I just would do one teeny tiny little thing that he wants.",
        "Dusty: What's that?",
        "Lucinda: He wants to know where Lucy and Johnny are. As you know, I don't know where they are. And if I did know, I would choose death rather than tell him.",
        "Dusty: He's a very sick man.",
        "Lucinda: Yes he is. Hey, at least now we know what it is he wants. And that gives us power.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, if we tell him where my son is, and your granddaughter.",
        "Lucinda: Have you heard from her?",
        "Dusty: Lucy? No.",
        "Lucinda: It could be very interesting if we made him believe that we knew. Okay, forget about that one. We'll save that for another day.",
        "Dusty: Cheers.",
        "Lucinda: Cheers. And this is not the worst day of my life. I've had worse ones.",
        "Dusty: Me too.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. Cheers again, Darling. You know, Worldwide -- it's a huge part of my life. It's not me. It's not me! My family, my kids, the people I love -- it's just another company. It's just another company. Of course, it's a company that I could run in my sleep better than Craig if he spends the rest of his miserable days --",
        "Dusty: It shouldn't have happened.",
        "Lucinda: No. There are so many damn things in life that shouldn't happen.",
        "Dusty: Montgomery used Lily big time.",
        "Lucinda: She always had a soft spot for him. I said a lot of blunt things to her.",
        "Dusty: Maybe she needed to hear them.",
        "Lucinda: If you really want to know who's responsible in vino veritas -- do you know what that means?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, this has got its veritas.",
        "Dusty: In red wine there is truth?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, but this stuff does better. Cheers again. Darling, if you really want to know who's responsible of this fiasco, it's not just all Lily's problem. I'm there. I'm there. I'm the captain of the ship, for heaven's sake. So if you want to know whose fault it is that Craig has stolen Worldwide, you're looking at her.",

        "Emma: Lily, Holden adores you.",
        "Lily: How many times can I put that to the test?",
        "Emma: It seems to me that you've been pretty well tested, as well.",
        "Lily: This is different.",
        "Emma: Lily, Holden knows as well as everyone else what happened to Ethan and those other babies. It was just a tragic, tragic mistake.",
        "Lily: It was my mistake. I had a horrible fight with my mother about it.",
        "Emma: I'm sure that when Holden gets back, he'll help you deal with Lucinda.",
        "Lily: Or he could take my mom's side.",
        "Emma: No, no, no, I doubt that.",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Emma: I doubt that.",
        "Lily: He's lost faith in me, Emma.",
        "Emma: The two of you have been through so much, it's just such a strain. I'm sure he's said things that he regrets. The most important thing is that Ethan is fine and the other babies are fine. I mean, all the success and money in the world can't compare to that.",
        "Lily: It's true.",
        "Emma: And as far as Lucinda is concerned, she's not going to stay mad forever, you know that.",
        "Lily: She'll try.",
        "Emma: You know that there's -- there's nothing in the world that a mother can't forgive her child. Her little mama. You've had that experience. You know that, right?",
        "Lily: Yes. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Emma: Now listen, why don't you just cut us some of that apple cake.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Emma: I want the biggest piece. I've just got to do a few things out in the barn. I'll be right back and I'll put up some tea. Okay? Okay? And put it on some pretty plates, all right?",
        "Lily: I'll do that.",
        "Emma: Okay. All right, my sweetheart, be right back.",
        "Lily: Please, please, Faith, I can't handle hearing how I ruined someone else's life today.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: All right, Guys, can you give us a minute please?",
        "Casey: You're not going to change my mind.",
        "Maddie: We need to talk alone.",
        "Will: All right, we'll go settle the charges at the store.",
        "Casey: Do you have enough?",
        "Will: I think so.",
        "Maddie: Thanks, Will.",
        "Casey: Look, the last thing I need is for that sheriff to be after us. I should just go and take care of this myself.",
        "Gwen: No, just don't go anywhere until we get back.",
        "Maddie: We won't.",
        "Casey: Maybe.",
        "Will: Come on, let's go.",
        "Casey: Wait, what are you doing?",
        "Maddie: What does it look like I'm doing? I'm packing. I hear Montr\u00e9al is great this time of year.",
        "Casey: I'm not going to Montr\u00e9al.",
        "Maddie: Casey, turning yourself in isn't right or romantic or heroic. It's just stupid.",
        "Casey: Thanks a lot.",
        "Maddie: And it's a mistake that you can't undo.",
        "Casey: Maddie, it's a bigger mistake to keep running.",
        "Maddie: Not if we don't get caught.",
        "Casey: Everyone gets caught, Maddie. They've got TV shows to prove it.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, and there's killer and kidnappers on those shows, not college on-line gamblers and bail jumpers. And I get that you love your parents because I love them, too. But I love you more. And I want to be with you.",
        "Casey: Maddie, my dad just had a heart attack, all right? I've messed up in every way possible. And now they have to deal with the fact that they're not going to see Adam again, okay? I need to work this out, as a family for them, for me, and for you too, if you're going to keep living with them.",
        "Maddie: And I know. And they opened their home to me, and they treat me like I'm their own daughter. And after what I did to Adam -- if I don't come clean, I'm going to be lying about what happened in those woods. And if I do come clean, your parents will know what really happened with Gwen and Adam.",
        "Casey: Then fine, we'll tell them everything.",
        "Maddie: And they'll try to understand, because that's what they do. And they'll be so happy to see you that maybe they'll put up with me for a while. But it's not going to be the same.",
        "Casey: Then, fine. It's not going to be the same. But it's going to be a lot better than this.",
        "Maddie: Casey, come on. If you go home, we're going to get a few visiting hours and scheduled phone calls from wherever they send you.",
        "Casey: Then maybe we should take a break.",
        "Maddie: We tried breaking up. It didn't work.",
        "Casey: I don't want to keep hurting you.",
        "Maddie: Fine, if you don't want to hurt me, then promise me we'll head to Canada. Together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Worldwide is a huge part of my life -- was. But it wasn't everything. And it's not everything, not anymore.",
        "Dusty: No, of course not. Not with your beautiful children and grandchildren.",
        "Lucinda: Poor Lily. Poor Lily. I wasn't that good a mother really. You know? I was a workaholic. [Lucinda laughs] I was working, and I would push her around. And Lily -- I mean, if she's riding the horse, she has to compete. If she's playing tennis, she can't just play tennis for fun. No, she's got to win. So, then she gets in a situation like this -- now, as an adult, and she has to feel that she's got to perform and she's got to win at any cost.",
        "Dusty: I don't get it. I don't get why she didn't do her homework. Why she didn't see that these baby food people were slinging her a bunch of nonsense. She's always been very smart.",
        "Lucinda: She is smart. She's very smart. She just hit a blind spot.",
        "Dusty: Then, why was she in such a rush? Why was she in such a rush? She didn't even look at what Montgomery put down in front of her.",
        "Lucinda: That's it, damn him! That's it, he took advantage of her. And Ethan being sick, that just made his job a lot easier, let me tell you.",
        "Dusty: So now what?",
        "Lucinda: What time is it? Oh, oh. All right, I've had enough. I think I'm going to go and talk to my daughter.",
        "Dusty: Okay, do me a favor? Take a cab, will you?",
        "Lucinda: Ha, ha, ha. I have a driver waiting for me outside.",
        "Dusty: I should have known. You going to be okay? What are going to say to Lily?",
        "Lucinda: Um -- I'm going to be gentle. I'm going to be understanding.",
        "Dusty: There you go. You're a great mom. You're a great mom, come on.",
        "Lucinda: Thanks, Kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Is Grandma Lucinda mad about the baby food and what happened to those kids?",
        "Lily: Yes, she is. And I don't blame her for that. But we're going to get through this. Everything's going to be fine, don't worry.",
        "Faith: Can I help?",
        "Lily: You already help. You help. You're wonderful. Everything's going to be okay, I promise.",
        "Faith: With Dad, too?",
        "Lily: We love each other.",
        "Faith: Parker thought that his parents loved each other.",
        "Lily: Oh, Honey, this is nothing like that. This is very, very different.",
        "Faith: How?",
        "Lily: There is no one else in the world for me except your dad. And we disagree sometimes, but we do care about each other. And I think he feels the same way about me. So, I promise, we're going to get through this. Whatever this is, it doesn't matter. Just try not to worry.",
        "Faith: I'll try.",
        "Lily: Me too. I'll try. Hey, it's quiet. Where's your buddy Parker?",
        "Faith: He's at hockey practice.",
        "Lily: All night? Wow, no.",
        "Faith: It's fine. I have to do some homework.",
        "Lily: That's my girl. I'm very proud of you.",
        "Faith: Are you feeling better?",
        "Lily: That hug, wow. That was the best. That helped so much. I love you so much.",

        "Lucinda: Are you all right?",
        "Lily: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, we need to talk. That's why I'm here because we need to talk. You have been keeping me at arm's length for quite some time now, long before yesterday's fiasco.",
        "Lily: No, there's a very good reason for that.",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Lily: Because you wouldn't listen to any of my ideas about the company. So, I decided to stop going to you and -- you were right, I was wrong.",
        "Lucinda: But when the crisis came, Dear, I was just a phone call away. Why didn't you call me? Why did I have to hear from Ellman?",
        "Lily: I wanted to fix it myself.",
        "Lucinda: But you didn't fix it.",
        "Lily: I tried to fix it. And I went to Craig. I had no idea what he was really after.",
        "Lucinda: After all the history? Sierra, and everybody else --",
        "Lily: He was never like that with me. You know that.",
        "Lucinda: Dear, only because you didn't have anything that he wanted until now.",
        "Lily: The company was in a downward spiral. What did you want me to do?",
        "Lucinda: I wouldn't have wanted it to go down! Just to go down, rather than anything I had created would go to Craig Montgomery.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. What else can I say? I have no idea what else to say, but I'm sorry.",
        "Lucinda: And I'm sorry, too. I'm just so sorry. I'm sorry that I was on a vacation. I'm sorry I wasn't here when Ethan was sick. And I wish that you had just called me.",
        "Lily: I couldn't.",
        "Lucinda: That's the problem. Maybe if I had been less judgmental.",
        "Lily: Mother, please. Please, please, don't. I know exactly how you feel about me. And you can't come in here now -- you can't forget all of the things you said in the office. Can't. It's already been done.",
        "Lucinda: Well, Dear, you can't run away from disappointments and despair. You can't get away with that. You're got to head right into problems --",
        "Lily: I tried to do that.",
        "Lucinda: No. No, you didn't. No, you didn't. You looked round for someone who would swoop in and fix everything for you. And my heavens, you picked surely the wrong --",

        "Lucinda: What is this? Are you taking these?",
        "Lily: Would you just give that to me, please? Please. Just give it to me. Give it to me!",

        "Dusty: I quit.",
        "Craig: I got that from line one. Why? Why not stick around? Work on the inside. You know, sharpen your knives, and report back to Medusa. See if you can out-maneuver me. Could be fun.",
        "Dusty: Lucinda's going to get Worldwide back without my help.",
        "Craig: Well, not according to the board members. They think that while she was sunning herself in Montega, Lucinda's daughter was poisoning innocent babies.",
        "Dusty: You didn't win anything today.",
        "Craig: Really? Care to check out my stock portfolio?",
        "Dusty: The real prize was never Worldwide. It was finding Lucy and Johnny. How'd that work out for you?",

        "Casey: Where do you think you're going?",
        "Maddie: To Montr\u00e9al. Will and Gwen can go home if they want.",

        "Maddie: Yeah, like I haven't done a good enough job on my own.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but you don't have any charges against you. Okay? You need to go back and finish school and go to college.",
        "Maddie: I'll go to college!",
        "Casey: No, Maddie, look. College takes money. And if you don't go to college, then there's going to be some kid out there that doesn't get to have this amazing teacher. Or the best movie script ever is not going to be written. Or some disease isn't going to be cured. I'm saying all of this because I believe that it's true, all right? I believe that you can do anything. And I'm not going to cheat the rest of the world out of getting the chance to know the real Maddie Coleman. Because that'd be the biggest crime of all.",
        "Maddie: What good is all that, if I do it without you? I love you.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I love you, too. All right? We're going to get through this. We've gotten through a lot worse. I think we've proven that.",
        "Maddie: Okay, if we do this your way, and we go back to Oakdale, this could be the last night we spend together, alone in a really long time.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.",
        "Maddie: That makes me so sad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sheriff: Well, if isn't my old pal Jason. What's up, Jase? You come to destroy more private property?",
        "Will: Look, I came to apologize.",
        "Sheriff: Sorry doesn't pay for what you and your buddy did to my door.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know.",
        "Sheriff: Where is he, anyway?",
        "Will: I told him that I'd handle this.",
        "Sheriff: Well, you know, I'm out the only security system this place has.",
        "Will: Yeah, so, I came because I want to pay for the damages.",
        "Bartender #2: What in blue blazes happened? Nobody locks that door from the outside but me or the sheriff. How'd you get stuck in here?",
        "Will: I don't know. So, will a hundred cover it? I could go maybe as high as like $125, but that's it.",
        "Bartender #2: Fifty will cover parts and labor -- I'm the labor. We'll call it even.",
        "Will: Okay, thank you. It really means a lot to me guys. Thank you.",
        "Sheriff: Do me a favor? You look like a nice kid. Keep your nose clean. Stay out of trouble.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'll try. You know, it's a good thing he didn't take the hundred. Because we'd be out a couple bus tickets. [Gwen panting] What is it?",
        "Gwen: It's Adam. He's here.",
        "Will: Go wait outside. What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Guy: What's your problem?",
        "Will: I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else. My mistake.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, it looked just like him.",
        "Will: Yeah. Well, that's going to happen. If you see his face a million different places, I'm going to understand.",
        "Gwen: Let's just get out of here.",
        "Will: You okay?",
        "Gwen: You can't fix this for me, you know? You can't change the way that I feel about myself.",
        "Will: Do you want to tell me how you feel?",
        "Gwen: Like my mom.",
        "Will: No, don't say that.",
        "Gwen: I mean, why not? It's true. I lied. I hurt good people, I kept secrets. I was just as selfish as she's ever been.",
        "Will: No Gwen, you were scared. And I know all about being scared. I'd still be locked up in a hospital, if it weren't for the people that I love coming and forgiving me and helping me when I needed it. The nightmare's over, okay? You've got to start believing it. It's over.",
        "Gwen: Every time I see Tom and Margo I'm going to remember putting Adam's body in that grave.",
        "Will: Gwen, we're going to figure out a way to deal with this.",
        "Gwen: How? I mean, it's not like we can say we have good news and we have bad news. I mean, the good news is that your son is alive. The bad news is that he's an attempted rapist.",
        "Will: Well, if Maddie gets through to Casey, then we don't have to tell anybody anything. We can just start someplace new.",
        "Gwen: I think he's already made up him mind.",
        "Will: Well, that doesn't mean we have to go back.",
        "Gwen: Your whole family is there.",
        "Will: You make that sound like it's a perk.",
        "Gwen: Do you think Adam called Margo like he promised?",
        "Will: I hope so. But I doubt he's ever going to be able to face her. His mom was raped when he was just a kid. I don't think he would want her to know what he tried to do to you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you're probably right.",
        "Will: I don't care where we go.",
        "Gwen: You honestly don't?",
        "Will: No, I'll live anywhere. I just don't want to live in the past.",
        "Gwen: That sounds like a song.",
        "Will: That's what I'm talking about. You need to get back to singing and song writing.",
        "Gwen: Not about this.",
        "Will: Okay, not about this? But maybe about a guy who loves you so much that he'd so anything to make you happy?",
        "Gwen: I've already got a suitcase of songs about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Maddie, don't be sad, all right? Things are going to get better.",
        "Maddie: Are you sure you forgive me?",
        "Casey: Maddie, yeah. Look, if I'd seen Adam attacking Gwen, I would've done the same thing you did. Which is hit him as hard as you can. You didn't mean to kill him, and it turns out you didn't.",
        "Maddie: Thank God.",
        "Casey: Man, I wish Will and Gwen would get back. So we can tell them what we decided.",
        "Maddie: They might be gone for a while.",
        "Casey: Yeah, probably.",
        "Maddie: While we're waiting, you want to play a game?",
        "Casey: You want to play a game?",
        "Maddie: Why not?",
        "Casey: Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I'm wanted by the law. Or that it's freezing in here? Or I've got this brother out there who turns out to be just like Adam turned out to be?",
        "Maddie: See, you need something to keep your mind off all that stuff.",
        "Casey: All right, what's the game?",
        "Maddie: The game is called, \"What would you do if this was your last night on earth?\"",
        "Casey: You go first.",
        "Maddie: That's easy. If this were my last night on earth, and it sort of feels like it is -- I would want to make love to the guy who means everything to me.",

        "Dusty: You thought Lucinda would give up Lucy and Johnny for her company?",
        "Craig: She's still in shock. Soon, it'll wear off. And then, she'll miss being queen bee and then we'll see what happens.",
        "Dusty: Nothing's going to happen. Because Lucinda would never give up family for business. You got yourself a company, but you'll never see your kid again. I guess it's lonely at the top.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: These are pills you can get at any drugstore, next to the baby aspirin and the toothpaste. Don't make it sound like I got them on the street.",
        "Lucinda: Just because they're legal, doesn't mean that they're not dangerous. How often do you take them?",
        "Lily: Once in a while to curb my appetite.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, once in a while?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: You still haven't told me how long this has been going on.",
        "Lily: I don't know. I don't think about it.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you don't think about it? The girl that I saw groveling on the linoleum and grabbing at the pills as if they were gold, she thinks about it all the time. Now how long, Darling? Just -- cannot you answer a simple question anymore, Lily?",
        "Lily: Simple? Simple? I don't remember the last time my life was simple! I can't remember when my life felt like my life! I lost months, and months in that coma. I don't remember my own son's birth, my husband and my children. They were strangers, strangers to me. So it may seem shallow and vain to you, but the last thing I wanted to think about was my weight. I just wanted to feel like myself. Myself. I wanted one thing to be easy.",
        "Lucinda: Did you even read the labels, Dear?",
        "Lily: You're not listening.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I am.",
        "Lily: No, you're not.",
        "Lucinda: I'm listening. I am listening. I'm listening Darling. Everybody would like to take a pill, and everything be okay. It doesn't -- cancer, you take a pill. It doesn't work like that. It doesn't work. You have to fight the big battles. Honey, so you put on a little weight. So what? The wonderful girls that I know and raised, she would have bit the bullet and hit the gym and --",
        "Lily: Can't you just see this from my point of view?",
        "Lucinda: Darling --",
        "Lily: Please try.",
        "Lucinda: Stop! Your point of view is what the problem is. You risked your health Darling.",
        "Lily: I'm fine.",
        "Lucinda: Oh my God. Did Craig know about this? The pills? Of course he knew about it.",
        "Lily: He didn't judge me for that.",
        "Lucinda: No. The pills played right into his plans. Darling, he knew that eventually you'd just be so zonked out, that you wouldn't know what was in front of you. You'd sign anything that was in front of you. For heaven's sake. I don't know Darling! I think you're gorgeous! You're beautiful, and all's well with the world, and you've lost weight, and Craig has got -- he's got my company and my loyal stock holders, who loved me and were faithful to me -- they got shafted! That's --",
        "Lily: I'm very very very happy you have someplace to put your anger now.",
        "Lucinda: You're damn right I'm angry! I am angry! And I'm scared. Cause you're in trouble, Honey.",
        "Lily: I do not have a problem. I can stop those pills at any time.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, then why don't you do it?",
        "Lily: I do not have a drug problem.",
        "Lucinda: That's it. All right.",
        "Lily: Who are you calling?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you read my mind. I'm calling Holden. That's who I'm calling.",
        "Lily: Don't treat me like a child.",
        "Lucinda: Then don't act like a child. Holden has been sick worried about you.",
        "Lily: Please don't drag him into this.",
        "Lucinda: He's your husband, Darling. He's got to know what you've been up to",
        "Lily: Why, why would he care about something that doesn't even require a prescription?",
        "Lucinda: Hey, Darling \u0096 Darling, Darling, Darling, if Luke, if Faith, if they were around popping pills all the time you wouldn't believe one word that came out of their mouths! You wouldn't. And I know, I know Holden wouldn't like -- all right, okay, you make the phone call. You call him. You call your husband, and you tell him the truth, please. Or else I'll have to.",
        "Lily: Don't bully me, please.",
        "Lucinda: Don't think that's going to stop me from helping you?",
        "Lily: You don't want to help me. You want to punish me because you lost your company.",
        "Lucinda: That's very tempting darling. But it's not the reason I came.",
        "Lily: Can you just let me handle this, please? Let me talk to Holden and tell him in my own way, please?",
        "Lucinda: Rationally? Logically?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: The minute he comes home?",
        "Lily: I will tell him.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Honey, companies can be rebuilt. But families, they can only take so much before they break. You know? You'd be wise to remember that, Sweetheart. Oh God.",

        "Casey: No, I just think that it's a hard decision to make when you're already scared. I mean, I think we can wait.",

        "Maddie: Where?",
        "Casey: I don't know, not here. I'd have really great music playing and it'd be nice and warm.",
        "Maddie: We can make this place nice and warm. Here, take these. What? You have a thing against atmosphere?",
        "Casey: No, but that's what music is for. Which we don't have.",
        "Maddie: I'll hum, okay? Work with me. Just put one over here. And one here. And put some more wood on the fire. Look, it's beautiful.",

        "Casey: Okay, so let's go back to this game of yours. So we know how you want to spend your last night. But how would you want it to be? I mean up here, in fantasyland. Am I some guy in a black and white movie with a pipe and a smoking jacket, that says darling all the time?",
        "Maddie: No. You're this really hot guy who's sweet and brave, did I mention handsome? The kind of guy who helps a girl see that sex doesn't mean that a man is taking something away from her, it's that he's giving her something. That he shows her that forgiveness and patience are just other words for love. That's what you are to me, Casey. Not up here, but right in here.",
