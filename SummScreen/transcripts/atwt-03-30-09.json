        "Casey is tired of everyone telling him that he isn't living up to his potentially being a janitor at the hospital. Casey is hurt when he gets fired by grandpa Bob since the hospital has to cut its budget. Allison tricks Casey into registering for a class at college but he turns the tables on her by choosing the class which is the basics of the African drums.",
        "The judge denies Parker's petition for emancipation but because of Carly's past does remove her as trustee for his trust fund. Parker suggests that the judge appoint Craig as trustee because he thinks Craig will let him do whatever he wants with his money. Carly makes Craig promise her that he won't allow Parker to spend his money on in a reckless way. Margo thinks Craig is in love with Carly but he denies the allegation telling Margo that he and Carly are just friends with benefits. Jack's preoccupation with Craig and Carly continues to cause problems between he and Janet. Janet does finally manage to persuade Jack to focus on Parker and Liberty and how to rebuild the parental relationship between them."

        "[Carly groans] [Gags]",
        "Craig: Good morning, sleepy-head.",
        "[Carly screams] [Laughs]",
        "Carly: Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What have I done?",
        "Craig: Oh, you don't remember? I could describe the whole thing in x-rated detail.",
        "Carly: Oh, please, please, don't.",
        "Craig: I'll leave out the part of your ex-husband barging in. What is it, don't cops need a search warrant to catch people in bed anymore?",
        "Carly: Craig, I need you out. I need you out of my bed, out of my house, right now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey! Where were you? I woke up, and you were gone.",
        "Parker: I had to sneak into my mom's house to get my suit before she woke up.",
        "Liberty: Oh, well, you sure look amazing. But what about me? I have nothing to wear. All my good clothes are at my dad's.",
        "Parker: Try this on.",
        "Liberty: Did you buy me a dress, tough guy?",
        "Parker: Well, the saleslady at the gift shop downstairs picked it out. And if it doesn't fit -- if it doesn't fit, you can take it back.",
        "Liberty: No, it's ama -- it's amazing! I love it. Thank you!",
        "Parker: Well, I figured my wife should look like a million bucks at the hearing.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but this is kind of expensive, Parker. I mean, do you think we can actually afford this?",
        "Parker: Don't worry about it. Craig said he'd pick up the tab on anything we need.",
        "Liberty: Craig? No, he's been so generous. He's paying for the room, our food, dresses now.",
        "Parker: But he won't be for long. Once I get control of my trust fund, we'll be able to do whatever we want, and we won't have to rely on anybody for anything again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Here you go.",
        "Craig: Oh! Would you take it easy? What is your problem?",
        "Carly: Craig, what -- transpired here last night --",
        "Craig: Yes, two consenting adults who thoroughly enjoyed each other. What's wrong with that?",
        "Carly: Please stop it. Okay, Jack was here. And he wanted to talk about Parker, which is probably really important, because Parker's hearing is today. Oh, God, my head is pounding.",
        "Craig: All right, then take two aspirin with plenty of water and transform yourself into Parker's loving and beautiful mother and responsible trustee. There's no way the judge can't rule in your favor.",
        "Carly: I hope you're right. Parker thinks because he's married now that he's a grownup, but he's not. He's just a boy.",
        "Craig: This is all gonna work out. Trust me. It's gonna be fine.",
        "Carly: Where have I heard that before?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh! You're late. I almost ordered without you.",
        "Casey: Why, you got something better to do?",
        "Alison: Yeah, actually, I do. I was thinking of heading over to Oak U. to sign up for some of these summer courses.",
        "Casey: Ooh!",
        "Alison: Okay, check these out. They got ethnomusicology, the 20th-century avant-garde composers, politics of punk, and, what else do they have? They have rock lyrics, rebellion and poetry. I mean, these are pretty good, right?",
        "Casey: Great. Sounds like everyone's sitting around, singing \"Kumbaya.\" Awesome.",
        "Alison: Think about it, Casey. We could spend our spare time this summer together taking a class.",
        "Casey: Um, nice try, but I'm not going back to school.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hello, Parker, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Craig: You two all ready for court?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Liberty needed a dress, so I charged it to your account. Hope you don't mind.",
        "Craig: No, that's fine. That's fine. I told you, I'd help any way that I can. So, today's the big day.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and if it goes as planned, we won't need to mooch off you anymore. But thanks again, for everything.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, Craig. We really, really appreciate it.",
        "Craig: It's my pleasure. Like I said, I'm on your side.",
        "Parker: It's good to know someone is. Because our parents definitely aren't.",
        "Craig: Let me ask you a question. Are you sure that getting emancipated and taking control of your trust fund is something that you can handle? Because if you're just doing it because you're angry at your parents, you might regret that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, I can tell you're still mad.",
        "Janet: Not really.",
        "Jack: It was a slip of the tongue. Janet, I said that Craig and Carly were in my bed because it used to be my bed.",
        "Janet: Yours and Carly's.",
        "Jack: Right. It came out all wrong. I shouldn't have said it. I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: Jack, Jack -- what's wrong is you getting all bent out of shape about Carly. She's not your wife anymore. You can't control what she does. You need to stop worrying about her. You need to focus on what's best for Liberty and Parker.",
        "Jack: That's what I'm doing. I'm trying to help the kids, but Carly's making that impossible.",
        "Janet: Are you listening to yourself?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, but I can't pretend that Carly's doing right by the kids when she's with Craig.",
        "Janet: Oh -- ugh! I can't believe you! Craig and Carly! It's all about Craig and Carly! Craig and Carly! Craig and Carly! That's all you talk about anymore!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Carly: Hello? Hi. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?",
        "Janet: Perfect timing, as usual.",
        "Carly: Jack, you came by the house yesterday. What did you want?",
        "Jack: It doesn't matter.",
        "Carly: Of course it matters. You wanted to talk about something.",
        "Jack: It's too late now.",
        "Carly: It's not. If it was about Parker, Jack, it's very important.",
        "Jack: Forget it. I'll see you at the hearing.",
        "Carly: Jack. Jack! Wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I know you think it was smooth the way you got me to make up with my parents, but don't push it. Even if I was interested in going back to school -- which I'm not -- Oak U. kicked me out. I can't take courses there.",
        "Alison: Actually, you can. These are extension courses. So anyone can sign up.",
        "Casey: So, they give me the boot, but they can still take my money. That's great.",
        "Alison: Okay, would you stop being so negative? This could be fun. You know, something to do besides skateboarding.",
        "Casey: Skateboarding beats going to classes any day.",
        "Alison: Okay, not necessarily. Okay, how about this? \"Loose ends -- the long and twisted history of pasta.\"",
        "Casey: Hmm.",
        "Alison: No? What about plants and human affairs.",
        "Casey: I'd rather be brain dead, to tell you the truth.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, you know what? I think you probably already are.",
        "Casey: Oh!",
        "Margo: Hi, guys.",
        "Alison: Hi.",
        "Margo: Hi.",
        "Alison: I was just telling Casey here that he and I should take a class this summer at O.U.",
        "Margo: That's a great idea.",
        "Casey: Wait, is this an ambush? Did you guys think of this together?",
        "Margo: No, no!",
        "Alison: No! Of course not.",
        "Casey: Do you really think I'm that stupid? Alison makes the pitch. Mom comes in to seal the deal. You really think this would have worked?",
        "Margo: You know what? You try being a parent sometime, you see how hard this is.",
        "Casey: No, forget it. I'm busy. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: What, with your all-consuming janitorial duties?",
        "Casey: I have a steady job with a lot of room for advancement.",
        "Margo: That's right, mop your way to the top, baby!",
        "Casey: Don't knock it down. At least I have a job. I'm contributing to society. It's a lot better than staying up all night writing papers or sitting in some lecture hall listening to a windbag --",
        "Margo: Casey, an education is essential if you want to get --",
        "Casey: I'm not going back, okay? Listen, I -- I got to go to work. Work. Got it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: He had no right barging into my bedroom like that.",
        "Janet: I agree. And I told him so. Listen, Carly, I don't care who you sleep around with.",
        "Carly: I do not sleep around, thank you.",
        "Janet: Okay, whatever. I'm just saying that your timing couldn't have been worse.",
        "Carly: My timing? What about Jack's timing?",
        "Janet: He was going over there to work things out with you.",
        "Carly: He was?",
        "Janet: Yes. I finally convinced him that we needed to put our heads together as parents, without Craig in the mix, and figure out what is best for Liberty and Parker.",
        "Carly: What was he gonna say?",
        "Janet: He was gonna cut us some slack, which is what you and I have been begging him to do for so long. He was finally gonna compromise.",
        "Carly: Oh, no.",
        "Janet: Yeah. And if Jack hadn't walked in on your little booty call, we might have worked things out.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, don't be like him. Don't blame me for everything, please.",
        "Janet: Carly, I don't have time for this. I got to go get ready for court to make sure that I don't lose my daughter.",
        "Carly: You just remember something, though. I don't want to lose my son, either. I'll see you at the hearing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Nothing like a good meal before court, huh? Could I make a suggestion?",
        "Parker: Here we go.",
        "Craig: No, it's not a lecture. You just need to be sure about what you're doing. Now, if you can convince the judge to make you an emancipated minor, you just need to be sure that you're doing this not only for your best interests, but also for Liberty's.",
        "Parker: Well, I'm sure about all of it. And Liberty feels the same. Right?",
        "Liberty: Right.",
        "Craig: Well, I can tell you this much. I'm not gonna make this any harder than it already is. As I said, I'm on your side.",
        "Parker: Thanks. Are you gonna come to the hearing?",
        "Craig: I wouldn't miss it. I'll see you there.",
        "Parker: He's not so bad. And at least we know we have someone in our corner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Margo: Okay, how do I get my kid to go back to college?",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Jack: I wouldn't take any parenting advice from me. At the rate my son's going, he'll never even apply to college, much less get in.",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot. Parker's hearing is today.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I have to sit there and listen to some crooked lawyer tell the judge that Carly and I are such lousy parents that Parker should run his own life.",
        "Margo: Tom filled me in on the whole thing, and we're just hoping justice will prevail.",
        "Jack: So did I. Unfortunately, it doesn't look good. Yesterday I went over to Carly's to sit down, try to straighten this out, but she was too busy with -- never mind. You don't want to know.",
        "Margo: Yes, I do. Keep me from working.",
        "Jack: No, no. It cuts a little too close to home, Margo.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, then, you have to tell me. It's an order. Spill your guts.",
        "Jack: I found Carly in bed with Craig.",
        "Margo: Ew! You walked in on them? Oh, I'm sorry. I was hoping --",
        "Jack: You could've warned me.",
        "Margo: I didn't -- I didn't know. You know, Jack, you just got to -- you got to forget it. Just forget it.",
        "Jack: How? How am I supposed to do that?",
        "Margo: I know that you're really furious with Carly, but you're both Parker's parents. You really need to be on the same team today.",
        "Jack: Yes, I know. I know.",
        "Margo: And it's hard for you to do, because you bring out the worst in each other. That's, well, why you're not married anymore. But today, you got to bring out the best in each other -- for your kid's sake.",
        "Jack: I wish -- I wish Hal was here.",
        "Margo: I know.",
        "Jack: I just don't want to let him down, you know?",
        "Margo: It's been rough on everyone ever since Hal left. And Parker's taken the brunt of that. But he's so lucky that you stepped up to be his dad.",
        "Jack: I doubt he'll admit that.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, not now, he won't. But later on, down the road, he's gonna appreciate everything that you have done for him. But today, you got to make peace with Carly. You got to walk in that courtroom together, and you got to put your differences behind you for him.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Boy, you've got a pair of big ones showing up here!",
        "Craig: I'm gonna take that as a compliment. I need to see your husband, that is, if he's not armed.",
        "Janet: Well, lucky for you, he left.",
        "Craig: Oh. Do you know where he is?",
        "Janet: Do you really think I'd tell you?",
        "Craig: Well, I was hoping for Carly and Parker's sake that maybe Jack and I could bury the hatchet before we all show up at court today. I mean, it's not that he's one to take my advice, but maybe he could be a little less of a pain --",
        "Janet: You really think he would take your advice after he saw you in bed with Carly?",
        "Craig: And what was he doing barging into Carly's bedroom, I'd like to know.",
        "Janet: Yeah, me, too. You know, the funny thing is I used to think that you and Carly would be a good thing.",
        "Craig: Of course you did. Carly would be spoken for, and Jack would have to stop sniffing around his ex-wife.",
        "Janet: Yeah, but that's not happening. Because Carly still gets to him. And with you in the picture, he's even crazier.",
        "Craig: Well, I can't help it if I rub Jack the wrong way.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no. No, it's worse than that. You are getting in the way of what they are supposed to be doing, which is being good parents.",
        "Craig: All right. I really do wish I could find some way to help.",
        "Janet: You can. Butt out.",
        "Janet: If you really want things to work out with Carly, she's gonna have to make peace with Jack. They're gonna have to stop fighting and become friends. Or it's not gonna work out.",
        "Craig: Do you mean for me or for you?",
        "Janet: My marriage is solid. But it could be a little better if Carly wasn't in the picture, okay? I'm just saying please do everybody a favor and stay out of the mix.",
        "Craig: What am I supposed to do, disappear?",
        "Janet: Please. All you're supposed to do is just, like I said, butt out. Let them be parents. And remember, they're not your kids.",
        "Craig: I'm well aware of that, but how am I supposed to, as you so delicately put it, butt out when Jack is making a sworn enemy of his own son and making Carly miserable?",
        "Janet: Craig, you're not helping anybody. Not Carly, not you, not the kids. So for once in your life, do the right thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Casey, I got to talk to you.",
        "Casey: Sure. Anything to take a break. Of course, I'll get back on track. You know, I'm a lot better at this than when I first started.",
        "Bob: Yeah, I'm sure. The reports have been -- been good.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but why don't you look happy? Is everything okay? Is Great- grandma sick or something?",
        "Bob: Oh, no, no, she's fine. She'd appreciate a call from you. No, this is not a family matter. It's a hospital matter.",
        "Casey: Okay. What's up?",
        "Bob: Well, as you probably know, the hospital has some financial problems. We've got to find a way to save money somehow without, of course, jeopardizing patient care.",
        "Casey: Oh, if is this about the floor buffer, I tried to fix it. You know, but it was no help. It was on its last leg. And I know the new one was expensive --",
        "Bob: No, that's not the issue. We've got to trim the staff, and unfortunately, you were the last employee hired by the maintenance department.",
        "Casey: Wait a minute. Are you firing me?",
        "Bob: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I thought I'd see you at the hearing.",
        "Jack: We need to talk.",
        "Carly: Oh. Now you want to talk to me.",
        "Jack: Carly, I came by to say I'm sorry. I acted like a jerk yesterday. But when I saw you and Craig in our -- in that bed -- I know I don't have any right, but it was a gut reaction. And I couldn't control myself.",
        "Carly: Is that all you came to say?",
        "Jack: No. I was angry when I saw you and Craig together, so it stopped me from -- stopped me from saying what I came over to say.",
        "Carly: Which is?",
        "Jack: Parker's our son. We need to be on the same page. We need to show him that we're together on this, that we love him, even though we don't approve of what he's doing.",
        "Carly: And?",
        "Jack: And that we're willing to do whatever it takes to get him back, to show him that he's our son again.",
        "Carly: Yes, Jack. I totally agree with you. He can't be out there like he's some adult. He still needs his parents.",
        "Jack: I agree.",
        "Carly: Jack, that means that you can't fight him the way you've been fighting him. You have to drop the anger. You have to realize that you can't control everything.",
        "Jack: You'd think I would've figured that out after being married to you all those years.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Better late than never. I'm sort of in a hurry, Craig.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I thought I'd swing by, pick you up, and take you to the hearing.",
        "Carly: No. Thank you. I'm going with Jack.",
        "Craig: Oh. That's a switch.",
        "Carly: Well, we need to be together for Parker.",
        "Craig: Of course you do. Good luck today.",
        "Carly: Bye. Let's go. Our son needs us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Listen, I know I acted like this was a nothing job and I didn't care. But I was here every day, I was on time, I did what I was supposed to do. It felt good.",
        "Bob: Well, then it's a good experience for you.",
        "Casey: But that's it? This was my best shot. No one's gonna hire an ex-con. And I've ran out of relatives to ask for favors.",
        "Bob: Look, I know it's tough out there. But, you know, being laid off is not a black mark against your record. Casey, I believe in you. I think you're capable of doing a lot more than pushing a mop around.",
        "Casey: You know what? I'm sick and tired of people telling me what I'm capable of. If I'm so capable, why is my life a total disaster?",
        "Bob: Well, you have made some mistakes. Look, I know you have potential. You can be anything you want to be. You can -- you can do anything you want to do. There are jobs out there. You're just gonna have to find one.",
        "[Pager beeping]",
        "Bob: I got to go. Listen, call me. Come over for dinner. We'll talk more later.",
        "Alison: Hey. I'm sorry it felt like your mom and I were ganging up on you.",
        "Casey: No. No, it's fine. Don't worry about it. I actually have time now for noodle sculpting or needlepoint, bird watching, whatever it is.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Casey: I got fired.",
        "Alison: You're kidding. Why?",
        "Casey: It doesn't matter. But I'm getting the hell out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: So, Parker should be prepared for the judge to ask him all these questions, right?",
        "Parker: Yeah. No, it's gonna be fine. This is fine. I'll be right back.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Parker: Hey, thanks for coming.",
        "Craig: Well, I wanted to come by and wish you luck, but I can't stay.",
        "Parker: Why not?",
        "Craig: You know, Parker, this is really between you and your parents. I'd just be in the way.",
        "Parker: No, you wouldn't. You're my friend.",
        "Craig: Yes, I am. And I always will be. You know that, don't you? Okay. Good luck today.",
        "Liberty: Hey, where did Craig go?",
        "Parker: Forget about Craig. I got to look at these questions.",
        "Jack: Hey, Parker. Can we talk to you for a sec?",
        "Parker: There's nothing to talk about.",
        "Carly: Please, Parker. It's important.",
        "Jack: It's not too late to stop this, son.",
        "Parker: No way.",
        "Jack: Listen, your mother and I aren't fighting anymore, and we don't want to fight with you, either.",
        "Carly: Could you just hear us out, please?",
        "Jack: We can just -- we'll talk now. We'll talk about this as a family, and we'll come to a compromise.",
        "Parker: I don't think we can.",
        "Mr. Shink: The judge is ready.",
        "Parker: We better sit.",
        "Judge: Be seated, please. This is an informal hearing, but make no mistake. The results we reach here today will be binding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, excuse me, Dr. Hughes, can I ask you a question?",
        "Bob: Sure. What's up?",
        "Alison: Did Casey really get fired?",
        "Bob: Well, laid off, actually. Budget cuts. Not his fault. But I couldn't play favorites.",
        "Alison: I know. It's just a really bad break for him, especially now.",

        "Alison: I know. I just wish I could help. I've been telling him that he needs a new goal in his life. And his mom and I were even trying to get him to think about going back to college. But I don't think I can put any more pressure on him.",
        "Bob: Listen, don't stop trying. He's got to start believing in himself. He's not gonna take advice from me, but if he hears it from a young person your age, he might just start listening.",

        "Margo: Hmm.",
        "Craig: Well, I realized that my presence wouldn't do Carly or Parker any good. So if discretion is the better part of valor, I'm taking the high road. Well, how do you like this new discreet Craig Montgomery?",
        "Margo: Kind of hard to believe.",
        "Craig: You doubt my sincerity?",

        "Judge: I have reviewed this case and all pertinent materials. Mr. Shink, counsel for Parker Snyder, has drafted a petition requesting that all the monies from the trust fund be released in their entirety. He has also requested that Mr. Snyder's status as an emancipated minor be determined at the same time.",
        "Mr. Shink: As a married man, Parker should be eligible for emancipation. The trust fund will make him financially independent.",
        "Judge: Pending court's approval. Before we continue, I would like to know a little more about the source of this trust fund.",
        "Carly: Your honor, I can speak on that. When my son was born, my sister was --",
        "Judge: You know, I think if Parker is ready to act as an adult, maybe he can handle that question.",
        "Parker: My Aunt Rosanna gave it to me. And she wanted me to have the money, not my mom. And my parents want to use it to send me to a boarding school, and I don't want to go.",
        "Judge: Yes, I see from the affidavit that your mother and father want to send you to Eastlake Academy, a very prestigious boarding school. Could you tell me what your objection is to getting a fine private education?",
        "Parker: They don't want to send me to Eastlake for the education. They want to keep me away from my wife.",
        "Judge: And you find that unreasonable, given that you went out of state, got married without parental consent, and you're still 16 years old?",
        "Mr. Shink: Your honor, there are extenuating circumstances.",
        "Judge: Yes, yes. I have read the brief concerning the judgment and motives and temperament of the appointed trustee, Carly Tenney, Mr. Snyder's mother. \"Said trustee has been arrested multiple times, abandoned her three children, broke a bail bond, fled the country while under an outstanding warrant, aided and abetted a known jewel thief. Charges dropped after she repatriated, but family tension remained. Parker's parents married multiple times. Since the last divorce, Parker's been forced to remain in his mother's unstable household -- a living situation that has been and continues to be detrimental to his emotional and psychological well-being.\" Is all the above correct, Mr. Snyder?",
        "Jack: No, your honor, that's not correct. In fact, it's dead wrong!",
        "Janet: Jack, maybe you should sit down.",
        "Jack: No, I have to do this. Your honor, the report you just read needs some interpretation, I think. The facts may be true, yes, on the surface, but they give the impression that Parker has been living in some kind of nightmare home life, and that is just not the case. Carly has made mistakes. Yes. I have, too. Just recently, as a matter of fact. Maybe I've been too strict on my son. But know this. Parker's mother loves him very much. I love him, too. And we never laid a finger on his trust fund. And we never had any intention of using any of that money until recently with this school.",
        "Judge: My question was to Parker. Please sit down so this hearing can continue. Parker, since is the substance of your petition, I need to hear from you, in your own words, why you think your mother has been derelict. I need you to clarify two things. I need to hear from you why you think she is unfit to be a responsible parent and why you think she unfit to be a responsible trustee for your financial assets.",
        "Parker: It's all in the papers. You just read it. I just really this need to be done. There's been a lot of crazy stuff going on in my family right now, and I need to be in control, for me and for my wife.",
        "Judge: Okay, well, I need a little time to think about this. We'll adjourn for 10 minutes.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: No, no, no.",
        "Carly: Thanks for standing up for me, Jack.",
        "Jack: The judge has to see it's not so black and white.",
        "Janet: What the judge has to see is that those two kids are too young to take care of themselves, whether Parker has money or not.",
        "Carly: I just hope he does the right thing. I can't lose our son.",

        "Craig: You dropped the \"l\" bomb. And I have to tell you, you couldn't be more off. Carly and I are in business partners. We also happen to be -- very good friends.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. With benefits.",
        "Craig: So what? That's nothing to get all up in arms about. It's just casual sex.",
        "Margo: All right. Fine. Whatever. Whatever you want to call it. But now is not a good time to fall in love with Carly Tenney, because what she and Jack are going through with Parker is a little dicey. You want to steer clear of the fallout.",
        "Craig: And that is exactly what I've decided to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: Be seated, please. This hearing is back in session. I have considered all the relevant claims and counterclaims in this case. And I have concluded that Parker Snyder is a very bright, very capable, very determined young man who, like many 16-year-olds, is angry at his parents and in a great hurry to get control of his own life. However, I see no evidence in Parker's petition of an overly restrictive or in any way an abusive household. Therefore, it is the decision of this court to deny the petition for emancipation. The original terms of Parker Munson trust will be upheld, and the monies will be given in the specified increments when Parker Munson Snyder reaches the age of 21. However, I do see some merit in Parker's claim that his mother should be disqualified as sole trustee, given her past troubles, legal problems, and various indiscretions. So I am prepared to draft a petition to change trusteeship to another responsible adult, preferably someone outside the family, someone who is reliable, impartial, and mature.",
        "Parker: Do I get a say in who that is?",
        "Judge: Certainly. You can make a suggestion, pending court's approval.",
        "Parker: Okay, well, I'd like the trustee to be Craig Montgomery.",
        "Jack: No, that -- that's not happening!",
        "Judge: Order.",
        "Parker: Craig is a family friend, and he's in business with my mother. And I know I can trust him. And he won't take sides.",
        "Judge: Very well. I'll look into it. Mr. Shink, you can put change of trustee in motion, assuming Mr. Montgomery is willing and pending court's approval. This hearing is now adjourned.",
        "Jack: A word outside.",
        "Janet: Honey, come here. Come here. I need to talk to you later. But I also want you to know that you are my little girl, and you always will be my baby, okay? Okay?",
        "Jack: This is what Craig wanted all along, isn't it? First, he lends Parker his car, then he gets him out of trouble with the cops, and now he's paying for a honeymoon suite, all because you've been letting him get away with it!",
        "Carly: Are you crazy? You think I wanted this to happen?",
        "Jack: You could've stopped him, but you didn't!",
        "Carly: Jack, that's absurd! Nobody could have predicted this. I'm as upset about it as anybody!",
        "Jack: You're really tight with Craig. And now the guy has more responsibility for our son than we do because you've given it to him!",
        "Carly: How can you possibly be blaming me for this?",
        "Jack: Or maybe the two of you worked this out in advance. Is this the deal you made when you were in bed?",

        "Alison: What lecture?",
        "Casey: The one where how one door closes, another door opens.",
        "Alison: No, actually, I think it's a window, but --",
        "Casey: Yeah, and I'll probably jump out of it.",
        "Alison: Okay, Casey, stop it. I didn't bring you here to give you a lecture. And this is not a consolation prize. But you're gonna need it to keep up with me.",

        "Jack: No, it's just as bad, Janet. Both of our kids will be under Craig's influence. And he'll do whatever makes Parker and Liberty happy if it means he can keep his claws in Carly. It's a dream come true for Craig.",
        "Janet: You listen to me. There is no way I am going to let Craig or anybody else take my daughter away from me. And you're not gonna let that happen with Parker, either. So, we need to focus all of our time and energy into getting the kids to come back to us. Are you with me?",
        "Jack: Of course, I am.",

        "Craig: I don't understand.",
        "Carly: You didn't have to do that. You'd already gotten me into bed. You didn't have to ingratiate yourself with my son, unless, of course, you are after his money.",
