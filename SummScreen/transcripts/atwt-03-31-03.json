        "Chris: Hi. ",
        "Emily: Hey, Chris. I didn't know you were coming. That's -- that's really \r\nnice of you to be here. ",
        "Chris: What are friends for? ",
        "Alison: You really believe in me? ",
        "Chris: Why wouldn't I? ",
        "Alison: Thanks. ",
        "Emily: Sweetie, we all believe in you. ",
        "Hal: The important thing is for you to start believing in yourself. ",
        "Susan: Alison -- honey, I know you're ready to go into that -- that hearing \r\nroom and tell that judge that you're guilty, and that's very brave, but I want \r\nyou to know that it's not too late to change your mind. ",
        "Hal: Susan, I don't think Alison needs us confusing her this late in the \r\ngame. ",
        "Susan: I just don't want her bulldozed into doing this because she thinks \r\nthat we're gonna feel proud of her. ",
        "Emily: Wait a minute. You're not pleading guilty because you think that's \r\nwhat we want you to do? ",
        "Alison: I -- ",
        "Susan: Be honest. ",
        "Tom: Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. I was tied up with a client. Has the bailiff \r\ncalled us yet? ",
        "Hal: No, we just got here ourselves, Tom. ",
        "Tom: Good. Good. So -- set? ",
        "Alison: I thought I was, but -- now I don't know. ",
        "",
        "Rose: Welcome to -- to -- I don't know. Maybe I'll have a contest to name the \r\nplace. What do you think? ",
        "Paul: That could get you in big trouble. Well, look here. ",
        "Rose: Yeah, it could. ",
        "Paul: Looks like they fixed the plumbing. ",
        "Rose: Yes, they did. And I had the landlord fix a few other things before I \r\nsigned the lease. ",
        "Paul: You signed the lease already? ",
        "Rose: Surprise! It's all mine. ",
        "Paul: Really? Babe, congratulations. ",
        "Rose: Oh, thanks. Oh. ",
        "Paul: Congratulations. You are going to love having your own business. ",
        "Rose: Yeah. I wish I could, like, roll out the red carpet, you know? Red -- \r\nI'm seeing red drapes. Red capes. Red floor. ",
        "Paul: Red. Red. Red, red, red. Very, very red. Back up. I want to hear how \r\nyou managed to get the money. Did you take Lucinda's bankers a revised proposal?\r\n",
        "Rose: No. Actually, I -- I got one of those business partner/investment-type \r\nguys to help me. ",
        "Paul: Okay. Wow. You are working overtime. Anybody I know? ",
        "Rose: Yes, as a matter of fact, you know him very well. Dustin Donovan.",
        "",
        "Barbara: From problem solver to Rose's indispensable business partner. Not \r\nbad for a morning's work, Dustin. ",
        "Dusty: Doesn't come cheap. ",
        "Barbara: Oh, sure it does. Rose is as cheap as they come. Oh, I'm sorry. You \r\nwere talking about the seed money you need to pad your bank account. Whatever \r\nyou need. ",
        "Dusty: I need to lease a top-of-the-line car. ",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Dusty: I got business trips. I'll be dining out a lot. ",
        "Barbara: Of course you will. And of course you need to have enough to \r\neliminate those pesky calls from creditors, don't you? And I'm feeling quite \r\ngenerous. So -- how's that? ",
        "Dusty: Substantial. ",
        "Barbara: You don't look pleased. Did I miss something? Come on, Dustin. \r\nFriends confide in each other. Why so glum? ",
        "Dusty: You want me to be happy? To be sticking it to your son? You remember \r\nhim, right? Your -- ",
        "Barbara: Everything I do is for my children, especially Paul. Now, I have not \r\njudged you for the circumstance that you find yourself in. And I don't think you \r\nshould judge me, either. ",
        "Dusty: What are you doing? You don't need to remind me of my financial \r\nsituation. ",
        "Barbara: And I'm not trying to. It's just that as long as I am footing the \r\nbill for this business arrangement, I reserve the right to express my opinion.\r\n",
        "Dusty: Yeah, well, we all know this is more than business to you, right? This \r\nis a mission to save your son from the woman he loves. My question is -- what \r\ngood is it if you end up destroying him? ",
        "Barbara: He'll recover. ",
        "Dusty: All in a day's work, huh? ",
        "[Dusty sighs] you know, the more I think about this whole thing, the more \r\ndisgusted I am. It's true. Keep your money. ",
        "",
        "Mike: Nice. Nice touches, Molly. A little rumpled sheets, a little choice \r\nunderwear tossed around. You know, just a few subtle hints to let me know you've \r\nbeen rolling around with yet another guy. ",
        "Molly: Oh, I guess I should have had the maid come first. ",
        "Mike: Why? You know, miss the jealous rage you thought I'd fly into? Or were \r\nyou hoping I'd just go out and just get rip-roaring drunk over losing you? ",
        "Molly: I'm sorry, okay? All right, I shouldn't have had you come here. I \r\nshould have had you meet me somewhere else. I guess it was thoughtless. ",
        "Mike: Hmm, thoughtless? No, no, no, you knew exactly what you were doing. And \r\nthis is beyond thoughtless. This is deliberate and cruel. ",
        "Molly: I am not a cruel person. ",
        "Mike: Huh, okay. Not like me, right? Maybe you think I deserve this after \r\nwhat happened. Okay? But no matter what you tell yourself about what we've been \r\nthrough, I have never intentionally hurt you, not like this. ",
        "",
        "Susan: Look, you can blame me if you want. But I told Alison that she's got \r\nto be sure before she goes in that courtroom that pleading guilty is what she \r\nreally wants to do. ",
        "Tom: No. This is Alison's best shot, and we have talked about this. ",
        "Alison: I know. I know. And -- and I'm ready. Six months is a drop in the \r\nbucket, right? ",
        "Tom: That would probably best be determined by what you do with that time.\r\n",
        "Alison: Well, Aaron said that maybe we can ask the judge to make sure that I \r\nget assigned to the library. ",
        "Tom: Well, I'll see what I can do. ",
        "Alison: And also, I wanted to study for my GED. Maybe you could tell the \r\njudge that. ",
        "Tom: All I can do is recommend. The final decision will be made by the judge.\r\n",
        "Alison: Sure, but wouldn't the judge want me to improve myself and stuff? ",
        "Tom: Well, you -- ",
        "Alison: Isn't that what going away is all about? ",
        "Tom: You will be given an opportunity to make a statement, and all those \r\npoints should be brought up then, along with all the regret that you feel for \r\nthe things you did that got you to this place. ",
        "Bailiff: The State versus Alison Stewart? ",
        "Tom: We're all here. Thank you. Okay, you all set? ",
        "Evelyn: Tom, Alison. ",
        "Tom: Hi. ",
        "Evelyn: Wow, so many of you. ",
        "Alison: They just wanted to support me. Is that okay? ",
        "Evelyn: Oh, sure. Most judges like to see an exhibition of family loyalty.\r\n",
        "Tom: Now please remember that this is a hearing, and the only person here \r\nthat you have to impress is the judge. ",
        "Alison: Do you know who the judge is gonna be? ",
        "Tom: The D.A. told me there's been a last-minute substitute. ",
        "[Alison remembering] ",
        "Judge: Drop the sob story about your life, because I don't pity you. ",
        "You've got two weeks. Get your act together. If you fail to do so, you ",
        "will then answer to me. And I won't be as nice the next time we meet. ",
        "Susan: Oh, no. That's the family court judge I took Alison to see. She never \r\nreported back to him like we promised.",
        "",
        "Paul: You wouldn't accept my money. And my advice was completely out of the \r\nquestion, and now all of a sudden, you're going into business with some guy you \r\nhardly know? ",
        "Rose: I -- you know how I feel, not mixing business with family. And besides, \r\nyou were the one who told me to go to Dusty for advice. ",
        "Paul: Yeah, advice. Not money. ",
        "Rose: What was I supposed to do? Just let my dream go right down the toilet?\r\n",
        "Paul: No, but there's got to be some sort of middle ground between letting \r\nyour dream go down the toilet and going into business with my best friend. ",
        "Rose: I was gonna lose the space. The landlord had somebody else waiting in \r\nthe wings. ",
        "Paul: And would that have been such a bad thing? I mean, there are plenty of \r\nother storefronts in this town. ",
        "Rose: Hello. Location, location. It has to be this place. It's got a good \r\nvibe. ",
        "Paul: You know what? Maybe it's not too late. Maybe you can still get your \r\nmoney back. ",
        "Rose: Have you heard anything that I have said? ",
        "Paul: Yes. And have you heard anything I've said? I don't want you taking \r\nDusty's money. ",
        "",
        "Barbara: I'm going to ignore your little outburst. ",
        "Dusty: You know what? I tried to see Rose as this -- what do you call her? \r\nCheap, heartless money-grubber that you say she is. It doesn't track. It doesn't \r\ntrack with the woman I know. ",
        "Barbara: She threatened to take my son away from me forever if I didn't dance \r\nto her little tune. ",
        "Dusty: Well, she has Paul's heart. There's no doubt about that. Don't you see \r\nhow much he loves her? ",
        "Barbara: He thinks he loves her. ",
        "Dusty: He also thinks I'm his best friend. ",
        "Barbara: And you are. ",
        "Dusty: What if this whole thing backfires? What then? ",
        "Barbara: You know, I think you need to ask yourself -- \"if I don't help \r\nBarbara save Paul, who's going to save me?\" ",
        "Dusty: Maybe I go to Paul. ",
        "Barbara: You think he'll bail you out? ",
        "Dusty: Maybe. ",
        "[Barbara laughs] ",
        "Barbara: Paul has money, but he doesn't have the sizable amount that you \r\nneed. And besides, he'd resent you forever if he found out that you were working \r\nwith his mother. And then what then? No friend, and still no money. ",
        "Dusty: If I go along with this, do not think for a second that I support it, \r\n'cause I don't. ",
        "Barbara: Understood. But it doesn't mean that we can't find it mutually \r\nbeneficial. ",
        "Dusty: Or I walk. ",
        "Barbara: Of course. Of course you can walk. You can walk right back to \r\nChicago and take your chances with whomever your creditors are. I certainly hope \r\nthat you borrowed from conventional sources. Remember what it was like to be on \r\ntop? Why don't you get this over with quickly, and you'll be right back on top, \r\nwhere you belong. And nothing would make me happier than to see you thrive. I've \r\nbeen there, you know. I've had to make difficult choices as well. This is what's \r\nbest. For both of us. ",
        "",
        "Molly: How the hell can you stand there and claim that you never \r\nintentionally hurt me, Mike? What did you think was gonna happen when you slept \r\nwith my cousin? ",
        "Mike: Geez, I didn't put \"sleep with Carly\" on my to-do list. It happened.\r\n",
        "Molly: Oh, oops, just happened. Just like that? ",
        "Mike: You know I'm not excusing what I did. I know it was wrong. I've said \r\nthat till I'm blue in the face. ",
        "Molly: Yeah, well, you know what? I've heard it till I'm sick to my stomach.\r\n",
        "Mike: Well, you know, I also -- I didn't go out of my way to wrack my brain \r\nto see what would hurt you the most and then deliberately go out and do it. ",
        "Molly: Oh, no? Then how come every time I show up on your door to try to come \r\nback into your life, you shut it in my face? ",
        "Mike: Oh, okay, you know, one minute, you tell me that you don't want \r\nanything to do with me. And you go to these ridiculous lengths to show me how \r\nmuch that you don't need me, including flaunting that little affair with Jack in \r\nmy face. And the next minute, you're asking me to marry you. I can't keep up \r\nwith you. ",
        "Molly: There was no affair with Jack. I told you that. ",
        "Mike: Oh, and this is make-believe, too, right? Oh. ",
        "Molly: No, Mike, this is me moving on. ",
        "Mike: No, no, this is you stooping to adolescent stunts to get back at me, to \r\nhurt me. ",
        "Molly: Listen to me. You threw me out, so I am moving on. ",
        "Mike: I didn't throw you out. You said, \"let's get married.\" I said, \"let's \r\nslow down.\" All right, I don't just jump into marriage and hope for the best.\r\n",
        "Molly: No, you just jump into bed and hope you don't make a baby. ",
        "Mike: See? We can't even talk anymore. You know, it's -- I try to get on the \r\nsame page with you. It's impossible. I don't think you're ready for a \r\nrelationship. Not with me or anybody else. ",
        "Molly: You don't get to decide that. ",
        "Mike: I'll tell you what I can decide. You and I are not ready to be a \r\ncouple. And judging from what you've become, I'm not sure we ever will be again.\r\n",
        "",
        "Evelyn: And so, your honor, given the defendant's age and the extenuating \r\ncircumstances outlined in my brief, the prosecution has dropped the charge of \r\narson against Alison Stewart. ",
        "Judge Davin: And what charges are you pursuing? ",
        "Evelyn: Only the lesser charges, your honor, of reckless endangerment and \r\nobstruction of justice. ",
        "Judge Davin: I see. Well, I hope you realize, young lady, that the \r\nprosecution is being very generous with you. ",
        "Alison: I do, your honor. Thank you. ",
        "Judge Davin: And how do you wish to plead for the lesser charges? ",
        "Alison: Guilty, your honor. ",
        "Tom: If it please the court, there is someone here who would like to speak on \r\nAlison's behalf, after which she would like to address the court. ",
        "Hal: I'm Lieutenant Hal Munson, Chief of Police, Oakdale PD. But I'm not here \r\ntoday speaking as the chief of police. I'm here today speaking as the father of \r\nWill Munson, the boy that was injured in the fire that we've been speaking about \r\ntoday. Now, Alison has made a host of mistakes this last year, but it is my \r\nimpression, your honor, that she has honestly tried to learn from them. So \r\ntoday, I'm asking you to show leniency in your sentencing of her. I also know \r\nfirsthand how much Alison has grown up in these last few weeks. For one thing, \r\nshe turned herself in to me of her own volition. And she is showing remarkable \r\ncourage in deciding to accept responsibility for what she has done and bear the \r\nconsequences. I would also ask that in your sentencing, your honor, you consider \r\ngiving her library duty so that she can complete her studies. It's admirable \r\nthat she has maintained educational ambitions throughout all this. And the \r\nearning of an equivalency diploma would maximize the usefulness of her time \r\naway, your honor. Thank you. ",
        "Tom: You still want to make a statement? ",
        "Alison: I do. I don't know if you remember me, but you gave me really good \r\nadvice once. And before I was arrested, I was trying to do the things that you \r\nsaid. I -- I was in school, and I had two jobs, and my life was going okay. And \r\nI want you to know that I know that the D.A. gave me a gift by making the \r\ncharges lessened, so -- so I just want everyone to know that while I'm away, I \r\nplan to get my GED and plan what I want to do for the rest of my life. And this \r\nis my promise to you and my friends and family. Thank you. ",
        "Judge Davin: I'm glad you're not taking this lightly, young lady, and using \r\nthe time while you're incarcerated to improve yourself is admirable. Indeed, I \r\ndo remember you. And you seem like a very different young woman than the one I \r\nmet here several months ago. ",
        "Alison: I am, your honor. I truly am. ",
        "Judge Davin: Then you will have no problem with me accepting your plea and \r\nsentencing you right now. ",
        "Alison: No. No, your honor. ",
        "Judge Davin: Good. Alison Stewart, you will be taken to Oakdale Reformatory \r\nfor Women, where you will serve a sentence of no less than one year. ",
        "Emily: What? ",
        "Alison: A year? ",
        "Emily: Why did he -- ",
        "Alison: No way. I was only supposed to do six months. You lied to me! How \r\ncould you do that? You lied to me! ",

        "Paul: That was not my intention. ",
        "Rose: I'm drenched over here, Paulie. I feel like guy on the fish sticks box.\r\n",
        "Paul: Why? Because I'm advising you not to go into business with a man you \r\nused to think was stabbing me in the back and putting the moves on you? ",
        "Rose: Dusty and I made up. I mean -- ",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Rose: He's even got a girlfriend. ",
        "Paul: How do you know? ",
        "Rose: Because I went over to Molly McKinnon's room. And believe me, I got an \r\neyeful. ",
        "Paul: What were you doing in Molly McKinnon's room? You're not even friends \r\nwith her. You went looking for him, didn't you? You went and chased the guy down \r\nwith not even so much as a word to me? ",
        "Rose: Wait, you wanna know my every move now? ",
        "Paul: No, I want you to stop shutting me out. ",
        "Rose: Hey, I want you to start believing that I know what I'm doing! ",
        "Paul: Which is what exactly, Rose? ",
        "Rose: You know the bankers -- they said no! And Dusty said that he would back \r\nme, so I took him up on the offer. ",
        "Paul: Oh, Rose. He was just being gallant. He didn't expect you to take the \r\nmoney. ",
        "Rose: Why? You don't think I'm worth investing in? ",
        "Paul: No, that's not what I said. And that's not what I meant. I believe in \r\nyou 110%. ",
        "Rose: Then what is going on here? ",
        "Paul: I -- we said we would be honest with each other. ",
        "Rose: Wait -- how am I not being honest? Because I make a quick business \r\ndecision without you holding my hand? No, what's really bothering you here, \r\nPaul? ",
        "Paul: This idea. All right? This idea bothers me. I hate the fact that you're \r\njoining up with my best friend, all right? That's it. That's how I feel. Just in \r\ncase you give a damn. ",
        "",
        "Molly: Another proclamation from Mike that it's over. How unusual. ",
        "Mike: I didn't say we were over. I didn't say that even now. ",
        "Molly: You just said we couldn't be a couple. That pretty much means we're \r\nover. ",
        "Mike: I don't know anything anymore. All right? Everything's just so up in \r\nthe air. ",
        "Molly: So what do you want? ",
        "Mike: I want us to take our time. All right? Time to figure everything out. \r\nYou know, just see what everything means. I just -- I need to go slow, that's \r\nall. ",
        "Molly: What's to figure out? ",
        "Mike: This baby could be mine. And if she is, I don't need to make any more \r\nmistakes. I just -- I just really need to go slow, all right? ",
        "Molly: So what, we just -- put a halt on our relationship until Carly has \r\nthis baby? Wow. You know what I think? I think that really stinks. ",
        "Mike: What if it's the best I have to offer? What if that is the only thing \r\nthat makes any sense to me right now? ",
        "Molly: What if Jack -- what if Jack can't handle you being the daddy, so he \r\nleaves? Carly moves back in. Then I'm out again? ",
        "Mike: Can we have one conversation without bringing up her name? ",
        "Molly: How, Mike? And I swear to you, I am not saying this out of anger this \r\ntime. I'm not. Carly is probably carrying your baby. How do I possibly leave her \r\nout of the equation, huh? ",
        "Mike: Look, I -- that's why we need to go slow, okay? Just to figure it out.\r\n",
        "Molly: There's one other way it could go. Have you thought of this? While we \r\nare freezing our relationship, it could turn out that this baby's not yours. \r\nWhat then? ",

        "Molly: This is -- this is really hard on you, isn't it? It's an awful lot. \r\nAnd I have been so selfish. I've only been thinking about me. And I haven't \r\nstopped to ask you -- is us just too much to for you to deal with right now? ",
        "Mike: I want to say no, you know? But it's a lot. I remember that feeling \r\nthat I had when I saw you that day in New York. And I remember what it feels \r\nlike to hold you in the middle of the night. But now kind of a lot's happened. \r\nCan you honestly say that dealing with us doesn't overwhelm you? ",
        "Molly: I guess -- you know what? I just really needed to hear you say that \r\nyou remember how we were. That you haven't forgotten. Because I want you to know \r\nthat I haven't forgotten, okay? ",

        "Mike: Right, man. You missed your cue. You were supposed to show up about a \r\nhalf hour ago, actually. ",
        "Molly: Mike, come on. Don't leave, okay? I didn't know. ",

        "Lily: What happened? Something with the shop? ",
        "Rose: Your friend, Dusty, put up the money. And Paul made a big stink. Know \r\nwhat he told me? Give the money back. Can you believe that? I'd have to give up \r\neverything I've been dreaming about for the last six months. ",
        "Lily: Do you think maybe Dusty overstepped a little? ",
        "Rose: Overstepping was kissing me, thinking I was you. Showing up to save my \r\nbeauty shop, that was a lifesaver for me. ",
        "Lily: So you took money from Dusty, but you wouldn't go to your family or \r\nyour fianc\u00e9 for help? ",

        "Lily: That's why you should consider his feelings. You know what? When you're \r\ngonna spend your life with somebody, you have to compromise a little. Paul has \r\nput you first in almost every aspect of his life, including his relationship \r\nwith his mother. ",
        "Rose: I hate that thing you do, that voice of reason. ",
        "Lily: No, you love it. That's why you asked me here. You obviously need it.\r\n",

        "Lily: I didn't think I did. But I can tell you, it's worth every headache, \r\nevery sleepless night. Just as a good marriage is worth every concession. ",

        "Judge Davin: Yes, you may. ",
        "Tom: The District Attorney and I recommended this plea bargain to my client \r\nbased on a six-month sentence. To adjust that now seems a bit extreme. ",
        "Evelyn: Six months is what we discussed, your honor. ",
        "Judge Davin: The sentence is ultimately mine to decide, and I'm reserving \r\nthat right. You may return to your seats. The last time I saw you, young lady, I \r\ngave you two weeks to get your life together, enroll in school, get a part-time \r\njob, make a plan for the next two years of your life. Do you remember this? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. And I did what you said. I really -- ",
        "Judge Davin: And only days later, you ran away, breaking more rules that can \r\nfit on one page of notes. And also, the fact that you are now standing before me \r\nin a criminal proceeding speaks volumes. Based on the evidence and my own \r\nexperience with you, a shorter sentence for these charges would be \r\ninappropriate. The one-year sentence stands. ",

        "Alison: No. No way. I won't. The deal is off! ",
        "Alison: It's not fair. My attorney promised me that if I admitted everything \r\nand told the court how sorry I was, then I would only have to serve six months. \r\nDoesn't a promise mean anything? ",

        "Judge Davin: I will allow you five minutes so that Miss Stewart can compose \r\nherself. But after that, I am instructing the bailiff to proceed as usual. ",
        "Alison: Tell the judge that if he can change his mind, so can I. I want out \r\nof this deal. ",
        "Susan: I'm with Alison. That sounds good to me. We'll fight this in open \r\ncourt. ",
        "Tom: Well, I don't think you'll do any better at trial, even with the \r\nslightly longer sentence. ",

        "Susan: If you don't want to fight this in front of a jury, then we'll find a \r\nlawyer who can. ",
        "Tom: So what is wrong with you people? You can hire an entire arsenal of \r\nlawyers, Susan, but they're gonna each tell you the same thing. You're not gonna \r\ndo any better than this. So I think you need to wake up and show a little \r\ngratitude. Your daughter committed arson. She destroyed buildings. She hurt \r\npeople. And the D.A. has generously agreed to overlook that in exchange for \r\nguaranteed time for lesser charges. I recommend Alison live with this sentence. \r\nShe told the court that she's grown up and learned from her mistakes. It is time \r\nfor her to act an adult and show the court that she is what she says she is. \r\nPlease accept Evelyn's offer. Start doing this time. ",
