        "Brad tells Katie to get things straightened out with Jack so that she won't lose anymore sleep over their relationship. Jack tells Katie his family needs time to heal and since he doesn't know how long that will take she shouldn't put her life on hold for him. The INS agent is very suspicious of Noah and Ameera's marriage because they sleep in separate rooms and Ameera is friends with Casey. Luke solves the problem by saying Casey is his boyfriend something that Casey isn't happy about at all. Noah asks Casey to pretend to be Luke's boyfriend so the INS guy won't watch them so closely but Casey says he must think about it. Sofie offers to go to all of Barbara's radiation treatments with her and keep Will and Gwen informed so that Will and Gwen don't have to postpone their plans to leave town. Allison helps Chris with a trauma patient since they are short staffed and he tells her she did a good job and takes her out to lunch. Carly asks Jack if he is willing to start fresh with their relationship but he still remains confused about his feelings for Carly and Katie."

        "Ameera: I love my classes at Oakdale U., especially the open discussions.",
        "Noah: Oh, that reminds me, I need to get a book from my English Lit class.",
        "Ameera: My class doesn't start for a half hour, do you guys want to get coffee?",
        "Casey: Actually, I have to hand in a paper for Philosophy. They gave me an extension because of Parker's trial. I'll meet up with you guys later?",
        "Noah: Oh, wait, don't!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Hi. Barbara Ryan. I have an appointment in Radiology. I was going to wait for my daughter-in-law to go in with me.",
        "Nurse: I'll check you in.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Sofie: Excuse me. Have you seen Dr. Chris Hughes this morning?",
        "Nurse: I think he's in surgery. He might be a while.",
        "Sofie: Why, thank you. I'll wait.",
        "Sofie: Hi, Barbara, how are you feeling?",
        "Barbara: I'm, uh -- I'm -- I'm all right. I'm here for radiation and I'm waiting for Gwen to show up. She's a little bit late and, Sofie, um, thank you for convincing me to tell Gwen about the cancer.",
        "Sofie: They needed to know.",
        "Barbara: Listen, I know how difficult it must have been for you to give Hallie back to Will and Gwen, but I hope it give you some kind of comfort to know that they're going to be great parents. They're going to do a wonderful job with that beautiful little girl.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You know, I'm anxious to get out of here too. Okay, there you go.",
        "Plumber: Hi.",
        "Gwen: Hi. Yeah, come on in.",
        "Plumber: Yeah, you called about a leak.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, listen, uh, we're really late for an appointment of ours. Um, I've just got to get my bag right here. It's in there. So, just do whatever you need to do and kick shut the door when you're done. Okay?",
        "Plumber: Okay.",
        "Gwen: Great. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Ms. Ryan, the doctor's ready for you.",
        "Barbara: Well -- I'm still waiting for my daughter-in-law. I don't know what's keeping her.",
        "Nurse: Sorry, if you don't go now, you'll have to reschedule.",
        "Barbara: Okay. Well, I guess, I'll just go by myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Are you mad at me or something?",
        "Noah: No. No, of course not. I don't think it's safe for us to be kissing in public. You heard what the ICE guy said, they're going to be watching.",
        "Ameera: Your father warned us, too. We have to be careful.",
        "Luke: You guys are taking this too far, both of you. They're not going to be watching us 24/7, they just wanted to scare us. That's all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Yes, well...It's going to rain today. And if my roof doesn't get fixed, I mean, the rain's going to come in and spoil all the hay. And then what am I going to feed my animals? Send them to you to be fed? Now -- okay. Listen, thank you. Thank you. It's Luther's Corners. You know it, right? And, uh, you go up Mile High Road and make a right and go past the pond, we're the last house -- the only house there. Thank you. Bye. Just a minute. Whoever it is, I'm not buying anything.",
        "Agent Helms: Sorry to disturb you, Ma'am. I'm with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement checking up on Noah and Ameera Mayer. Uh, we've been instructed to look in on them to make sure they're conducting themselves according to our guidelines.",
        "Emma: Well, uh, they're in class right now. But they'll be back this afternoon.",
        "Agent Helms: It's not a problem. Part of the process is to inspect the habitat. I'd like to start with the bedroom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: How is Margo doing?",
        "Casey: She's coping. After she shot Nevins she just kind of went into police mode.",
        "Alison: Your mom's amazing, Casey.",
        "Casey: You're pretty amazing, yourself, too.",
        "Alison: Thanks. [Giggles] Um...",
        "Orderly: ER's backed up. You have to handle this patient, get a doctor in here.",
        "Casey: I guess that's my exit cue.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Casey: You take care now.",
        "Alison: All right. You, too. What do you want me to do?",
        "Orderly: Stabilize him until the doctor comes. There was a major collision on the interstate, we're swamped.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not even a nurse, I'm just an aide.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hello.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: I dropped the kids at school. How are you feeling?",
        "Jack: Oh, better. Looking forward to getting back to work.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] All right, Jack. You just take your time with that, all right? So I just wanted to see if you wanted anything before I go shopping. I'm gonna fill the cupboards with all your favorites.",
        "Jack: Oh, Carly, you have enough to do. You don't have to cater to me.",
        "Carly: Fine. It's my pleasure. You just relax, I won't be long.",
        "Jack: Listen, before you go, we need to have a talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Not exactly in the mood to be doing segments on the science of happiness.",
        "Brad: Hey, \"Turn That Frown Upside Down\" sold a million copies.",
        "Katie: What do you do at 3:00 in the morning when you're too tired to sleep?",
        "Brad: It's wired, wired.",
        "Katie: Oh, right. Okay. Why are rich people happier than poor people?",
        "Brad: Katie, its why are poor people often happier than rich people. Do we have the same script?",
        "Katie: Oh, God, I don't know what's wrong with me today.",
        "Brad: Okay, you know what? Why don't we take a break? You know, we're going to take five.",
        "Katie: No no no no, hey, listen. I'm just a little sleep deprived. Let's keep going.",
        "Brad: Your mind is a million miles away, and so is your heart. If it's this bad, why don't you go to him?",
        "Katie: Who? What are you talking about?",
        "Brad: I'm talking about Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly, I really appreciate everything you're doing for me. I want you to know that.",
        "Carly: It's no problem. I'm happy to do it.",
        "Jack: Thank you. But I don't want you going overboard and rearranging your life. This living arrangement, it's only until I get better.",
        "Carly: I know. I know you're here because you need to heal, and the best medicine is being with your family.",
        "Jack: Exactly.",
        "Carly: Well, it works both ways, you know. After everything that Parker went through, it's very good for him to have you around.",
        "Jack: Right. Right. It's important for us to be tight as a family and to be together under one roof. But this -- this isn't forever.",
        "Carly: I know that, Jack.",
        "Jack: As soon as I can manage on my own, Carly, I'm going to be moving back to the farm. I just want you to be aware of that going in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Look, I'm sorry if I overreacted. I just don't think we should be kissing in public right now.",
        "Luke: I don't want to go back into the closet, Noah. That's not what I want to be right now.",
        "Noah: I know. I get that, I do. Maybe it's easier for me, growing up in the army base, there was always somebody watching, just didn't break the rules.",
        "Luke: Look, I just hate having to hide our relationship again.",
        "Noah: I know. I know. I do, but we agreed to do this.",
        "Luke: Well, no one ever said it would be easy falling for a married man.",
        "Ameera: This is all my fault.",
        "Luke: No, no it's not, Ameera. We'll find a way to make this work, right, Noah?",
        "Noah: Right. We will. You guys want to meet up after class at Java?",
        "Luke: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Noah: All right. I'll catch you later.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Agent Helms: So you're saying that Mr. and Mrs. Mayer don't even share a bedroom?",
        "Emma: I mean, not here at the farm.",
        "Agent Helms: Now, why is that?",
        "Emma: Well, forgive me, I don't mean to be rude, but you're just going to have to ask them.",
        "Agent Helms: That does seem odd.",
        "Emma: Well, not really. They have very, very difficult hours and schedules.",
        "Agent Helms: Still, for newlyweds not to sleep in the same bed or even share a room. That's usually a red flag.",
        "Emma: You have to remember that Ameera's from another country, they have very different customs.",
        "Agent Helms: Well, she's not in Iraq anymore. She'll go back if this marriage isn't legitimate. Thank you, Mrs. Snyder, we'll be in touch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay, you can do this, Alison. uh... Okay, here's the pulse, that's good.",
        "Chris: Okay, I'm here.",
        "Alison: Chris, thank God! The orderly left him here, I tried to stop the bleeding, but I don't know. I hope he's okay...",
        "Chris: You can relax. He's still breathing. That's always a good sign. Who knows, maybe you even saved his life.",
        "Alison: Well, beginner's luck. Okay, I'm out of here.",
        "Chris: Hey, where do you think you're going?",
        "Alison: Uh, I'm leaving him with someone who actually knows what he's doing.",
        "Chris: Not so fast, this guy is alive, but not out of the woods. We're short- staffed in the hospital, so you have to help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: That treatment didn't take very long, did it?",
        "Barbara: No, but it packs a good punch.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry. I can see that you're drained.",
        "Barbara: Thank you for going with me. I appreciate it.",
        "Gwen: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I'm late, the babysitter canceled and then the plumber came late and I hoped I didn't miss your treatment.",
        "Barbara: It's okay. It's okay. Sofie filled in for you.",
        "Gwen: That's great. Um, I hope it didn't interfere with your morning.",
        "Sofie: No, it wasn't a problem. I should go. I should go.",
        "Gwen: I really am sorry, Barbara. If there's anything I can do to make it up to you.",
        "Barbara: How about taking me home? I'm already wiped out. Let's go.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm not deluding myself, Jack, I know perfectly well where we stand.",
        "Jack: I just want you to understand.",
        "Carly: We did make a great team, though, didn't we?",
        "Jack: Yeah, we work well together, as parents. I can't deny it. You're a great mom, Carly.",
        "Carly: And you're a great dad.",
        "Jack: But husband and wife, that's another story. We tried that over and over and it just -- it doesn't work. And I can't go back there. I just don't have it in me.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm not asking you to. I'm just asking you to relax, put your feet up, and relax. Let me do the shopping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Even if I wanted to get back together with Jack, it's not going to happen. He's living with Carly right now.",
        "Brad: He's living at the house with the kids. It's not the same thing.",
        "Katie: I know. His first priority is his kids. Especially Parker, with everything that's going on with him right now. It doesn't change the fact that he's living under her roof.",
        "Brad: And Carly's all too happy to smother him with TLC. Look, you -- you want him, now get yourself over there and get him the hell out. The longer Carly has her claws in him, the longer it'll take for Jack to leave.",
        "Katie: I don't think that's such a great idea. He needs some space right now.",
        "Brad: Do you think she's going to give it to him? You never know until you try.",
        "Katie: I guess you have a point. Thank you. Thank you for being such a good friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hi, Ameera.",
        "Ameera: Casey, it's good to see you. How are you?",
        "Casey: Doing better now.",
        "Ameera: Did -- did they catch that man that was threatening your mother?",
        "Casey: Oh, yeah. Not before he threatened to blow us up. We're just lucky the bomb didn't go off.",
        "Ameera: Oh, I'm so glad you and your family are safe.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Sometimes I think I was safe from prison, it's ridiculous.",
        "Ameera: You were in prison? Did you do something wrong?",
        "Casey: You can say that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Okay, sounds good. I need to take a culture; the swabs are on the counter.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Chris: That's it.",
        "Alison: Here.",
        "Chris: You're going to be okay, thanks to my friend here.",
        "Alison: [Sighs]",
        "Chris: Allie, are you okay?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: Yeah. I can't believe you were in prison.",
        "Casey: Believe it. I deserved the time.",
        "Ameera: What did you do?",
        "Casey: When I was living in the dorms, I got myself into online gambling and I just had a major debt. You know, I was addicted. It was actually so bad that I trashed my grandma's club and robbed money from my best friend Will. I can't believe they forgave me.",
        "Ameera: I can. You're a good person, Casey. I'm sure you learned from your mistakes.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I won't do anything to land me back in jail. But I did come close that night at Yo's.",
        "Ameera: Because of me?",
        "Casey: No, you just don't realize how much you take your freedom for granted until you don't have it.",
        "Ameera: It must have been horrible for you.",
        "Casey: Well, the inmates had it in for me because they thought I was some rich spoiled kid. Then some of them found out I was a cop's kid? They threatened to beat me up all the time. And sometimes they did. It actually got so hard, I couldn't sleep at night.",
        "[Ameera holds Casey's hand]",
        "Ameera: Casey, I'm so sorry you had to go through that.",
        "Agent Helms: Ameera Mayer, I'm Agent Helms, I've been assigned to your case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I don't know what came over me.",
        "Chris: It was pretty intense in there.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but I was fine while we were working on him, it was the minute we stopped that I felt faint. It's not like I haven't seen trauma patients before since I've been an aide. I've never actually worked on someone like that.",
        "Chris: Hey, hey, you did better than some med students I know.",
        "Alison: I doubt that.",
        "Chris: Seriously, Allie, you're good at this.",
        "Alison: Right back at you, Dr. Hughes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Agent Helms: So, what's going on here?",
        "Casey: We're having coffee. There's nothing wrong with that, is there?",
        "Ameera: We were just talking about a class we have together. Is there a problem?",
        "Agent Helms: You tell me. I just paid an impromptu visit to your home and discovered you and your husband don't even share a bedroom. And I come here and see you hanging out with another guy.",
        "Ameera: Casey and I are just friends.",
        "Casey: Yeah, we go to school together.",
        "Ameera: That's all really.",
        "Agent Helms: Unless you can convince me otherwise, I have more than enough data to make me question the validity of this marriage. Right now, I'd say your visa could be revoked.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, hello.",
        "Brad: Can I get you a cup of coffee?",
        "Carly: Uh, no, thanks. I'm just here to pick up Jack's favorite jelly donuts, then I'll go back to the house and see how he's doing.",
        "Brad: Knocking yourself out for your man. Gotta hand it to you, Carly. You move fast.",
        "Carly: I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you do.",
        "Carly: Well, if you mean that I'm trying to reel Jack back in, you are wrong. He's at the house to recuperate and be with his children. And when he's feeling better, he's free to do whatever he wants.",
        "Brad: Not on your watch. Don't forget, I know how you operate. I've experienced it firsthand.",
        "Carly: Jack is capable of making his own decisions.",
        "Brad: Yeah. With a little nudge from you.",
        "Carly: What is your problem, Brad? The longer that Jack stays with me and the kids, the freer Katie is to be with you, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Katie: I should have called. Are you not ready for visitors yet?",
        "Jack: I'm always ready to see you. Come on in. Can I get you some coffee?",
        "Katie: No, thanks. Actually, I should be waiting on you. How are you feeling?",
        "Jack: Getting better. Coming along.",
        "Katie: Glad to hear it. You gave us quite a scare.",
        "Jack: Well, I want to thank you again for everything you tried to do for Parker. Loaning us the money and everything.",
        "Katie: Stop. I told you not to thank me, I wanted to do it.",
        "Jack: So, how's work? Brad driving you crazy?",
        "Katie: Yeah, he's always driving me crazy. Um, work's not that good, though.",
        "Jack: How so?",
        "Katie: We were running lines this morning, and I was messing up and couldn't concentrate and that's just not like me.",
        "Jack: Any reason?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I couldn't stop thinking about us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You know, you're not doing me any favors by keeping my brother all comfy and cozy with donuts like the little woman who waits on him hand and foot.",
        "Carly: And why is that?",
        "Brad: I don't want to end up with Katie by default, that's why.",
        "Carly: I thought you wanted her any way you could get her.",
        "Brad: Look, I care about her a lot, and I have for a long time. But I am no one's second choice. I only want Katie if I'm number one.",
        "Carly: Ooh, I see your' ego's alive and well.",
        "Brad: It's got nothing to do with ego. And you know what, I don't want my brother to suffer just so I can get the girl.",
        "Carly: You mean if he ends up with me he'll somehow be suffering?",
        "Brad: No! Well, I didn't say that. I just want to make sure that when Katie makes her choice, she knows she chose the right brother. That's why I sent her to see Jack.",
        "Carly: When?",
        "Brad: She's probably talking to him as we speak right now. Surprised you're not bolting out the door.",
        "Carly: Well, you're wrong, Brad. You still want to buy me that cup of coffee? Yes, you got it all wrong, but what is else is new?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Barbara, please, you said you're tired. You're not obligated to take us to lunch.",
        "Barbara: I'm fine, thank you.",
        "Gwen: You should just go upstairs, get some rest, or something like that.",
        "Barbara: You know what? Being here with you and my beautiful granddaughter takes my mind off the cancer just for a little while, okay?",
        "Gwen: I'm so sorry again that I was late today. I --I won't be ever again. I'll make a point of getting there early.",
        "Barbara: Gwen, I don't want you pressuring yourself. You've got so much on your plate. You have a baby, you have school, I don't want you adding me to your list of responsibilities.",
        "Gwen: You're at the top of that list. Will and I are here for you, and don't you forget it.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I-- I've been doing some thinking. Maybe I don't need your help.",
        "Gwen: What are you talking about? Of course you do.",
        "Barbara: Gwen, I think it might be best for everybody involved if you and Will left town.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Agent Helms: Do you even know where your husband is right now?",
        "Casey: He's in English Lit class, why?",
        "Agent Helms: And how come you know his schedule?",
        "Casey: Because we're friends and we go to school together.",
        "Agent Helms: Or maybe it's because you're Ameera's boyfriend.",
        "Casey: Come on, that's insane, Man.",
        "Noah: Hi, Honey, sorry I'm late. Thanks for keeping her company, Casey.",
        "Casey: No problem.",
        "Noah: I missed you today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I know I was late today, I can handle being there on time. I really can.",
        "Barbara: I know you can. It's amazing how much you accomplish in your day. You have school, you have a baby, you're probably off composing music in some corner somewhere.",
        "Gwen: Yes, I am. So you know how much I can handle if you need somebody to be there with you for those radiation treatments. Will and I can handle that.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I know how blessed I am right now that I have my family around me again. And I'm a part of my granddaughter's life.",
        "Gwen: So what's the problem?",
        "Barbara: The problem is Sofie. Now, I know she can be sweet and caring, like she was today. But you know, she's human, and she took us all on a roller coaster ride with Hallie. Yes, she gave Hallie back to you voluntarily, but she could change her mind tomorrow.",
        "Gwen: She seemed really clear this time, you know?",
        "Barbara: I have seen the way she looks at Hallie. I have seen the longing in her eyes and it's not healthy for the two of you to keep running into each other every time you turn the corner. I think you and Will need to put some distance and get somewhere where you can have a life together as a family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Is there a problem, Sir?",
        "Agent Helms: There could be.",
        "Noah: Why, because I'm late meeting my wife?",
        "Agent Helms: No, because I paid a surprise visit to your home today and learned that you don't even sleep in the same bed. You're newlyweds, isn't that a little unusual?",
        "Noah: Well, it's just that, uh -- that's not our place. We're guests at the Snyders', and it's not very private. And in Ameera's culture, relations between a man and woman are very discrete, and I respect that. But we are looking forward to getting our own place near campus. Right, Honey?",
        "Ameera: Yes.",
        "Agent Helms: And uh, where does he fit in?",
        "Luke: He's my boyfriend.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Agent Helms: I've been assigned to your case, Mr. Mayer. From now on, I'm going to keep a close eye on you and your wife.",
        "Casey: I can't believe you told that guy I was gay.",
        "Luke: [Laughs] what's the matter, Casey, not man enough to take it?",
        "Casey: It's not funny, Luke.",
        "Noah: Wait a minute. Cool it, Guys. This could actually work for all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I can't believe you're suddenly so cool about Katie hanging out with Jack. I thought that the minute you found out, you'd be running off to stand by your man.",
        "Carly: You thought wrong. Give me some credit. If Katie is who Jack wants, I wish them well.",
        "Brad: Did you have a personality transplant or what?",
        "Carly: [Laughs] I'm just like you. I don't want to be second best.",
        "Brad: Well, see, the difference between you and me is you never see yourself as second best because you always find a way to eliminate the competition. You're very good at it.",
        "Carly: I'm in a different place now.",
        "Brad: Well, thank you for watching the St. Carly Show, next week she feeds the poor.",
        "Carly: I'm serious, Brad. I have a lot in my life to be grateful for. The charges against Parker were dropped. Jack is home, safe, recuperating. I have faith that the future will take care of itself.",
        "Brad: Really? With absolutely no meddling or manipulation from you?",
        "Carly: That's right. Well, thank you so much for the coffee. I'm going to get going. So when exactly did Katie go to talk to Jack?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I did not come over here to put any pressure on you.",
        "Jack: No, I know -- I know that we left things unresolved.",
        "Katie: Exactly. I'm just kind of stuck. I don't know what to think. So I was hoping you could help me get unstuck.",
        "Jack: I'm not sure that I can help anyone right now. I can barely help myself.",
        "Katie: I understand. Yeah -- no, it's just that we had talked about -- you said that when Parker's case was resolved, maybe we would take another look at us.",
        "Jack: I wish there was an easy answer, Katie. But I don't have it. Parker being cleared, that -- that was great. But he's still a troubled kid who needs help. And so do the other kids. We need a lot of time to heal emotionally.",
        "Katie: I know. Um. All right. Let me just put it this way. Do you want me to wait?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Look at it this way, Casey, if you and Luke act like a couple, and Ameera and I act like we're married, they'll have no reason to question us.",
        "Casey: No. Forget it. No. I'm not pretending to be -- gay. No way.",
        "Luke: What's the matter, Casey? Will it threaten your manhood?",
        "Casey: I'm warning you, Luke, back off.",
        "Luke: Look, you like hanging out with Ameera. You guys are getting pretty tight.",
        "Casey: Thanks for putting me on the spot, Luke.",
        "Luke: Don't you like her?",
        "Casey: Yeah, sure, I like Ameera as friends, right, Ameera?",
        "Ameera: Yes, Casey and I are friends.",
        "Noah: Right, but you heard the I.C.E. guy, even just friends is enough to make them suspicious. Think about it. This way everybody gets what they want.",
        "Ameera: Everyone, except me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Now, I think I'm going to take your advice and go upstairs and lay down for a while. Give that to her when the bill comes.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm paying for lunch. It's the least I can do for being late.",
        "Barbara: No, I am paying for lunch. And you are just going to take care of that beautiful baby. Bye, Sweetie.",
        "Gwen: Say bye to Grandma.",
        "Barbara: Bye. See you soon.",
        "Gwen: Sofie? Check? Thanks.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry, your server's on a break. But I'll get that for you.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Listen, Sofie. I know that it's really hard for you to be around Hallie. Um, but I apologize -- Will and I just really need to be here for Barbara right now.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Ameera, what don't you like about my plan? It works out for everybody, especially you. If Luke and Casey act like a couple, they'll stop questioning us.",
        "Ameera: I just don't want to live my life in America as a lie.",
        "Noah: Right, but you got married under false pretenses. We have toe keep up appearances or you're gonna get deported. I love Luke, you know that, right?",
        "Ameera: Of course, I know.",
        "Luke: Ameera, this really, really could work. This way, you and Casey can still be friends without worrying about the I.C.E. coming and taking away your visa.",
        "Ameera: Is this what you want, Noah?",
        "Noah: Yes, it is.",
        "Ameera: I'm your wife, I'll do whatever you say.",
        "Noah: Are you sure? I don't want to force you --",
        "Ameera: No, I'm sure.",
        "Luke: Okay, great. Then, the plan's a go.",
        "Casey: Wait a minute. Okay, hold on.",
        "Luke: Look, Casey, seriously, what are you so upset about?",
        "Casey: Nothing. I just need to think about it, that's all. Yeah.",
        "Luke: Hey, Casey, I think you're real cute.",
        "Casey: Shut up!",
        "Luke: [Laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I know you feel it's important to be there for Will's mom when she went through her radiation treatment. It's obvious they're taking a toll.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, there's really no way that we could have let her go through this alone.",
        "Sofie: I respect that, yeah. I respect that. But if that's the only thing that's keeping you here, I'm offering to step in and help.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Sofie: I could go with Barbara to the treatments. And I could be on call for her if she needs me.",
        "Gwen: No, Sofie. It wasn't that long ago you and Barbara weren't even talking to each other.",
        "Sofie: I know, but we are now. Yeah, I admit when you and Will first asked me how I felt about you leaving town, I was really upset because I knew how much I'd miss Hallie.",
        "Gwen: Well, what made you change your mind?",
        "Sofie: I was thinking about everything we were talking about yesterday. And you know, it's all true. It'll be so much better for us if we're not constantly bumping into each other. And if I help Barbara with this in a small way, at least, it'll make up for how much grief I've put you all through when I couldn't decide what to do without, um -- your baby.",
        "Gwen: Sofie, I don't know if we should do this.",
        "Sofie: No, think about it. Think about it. You go and I could call you with updates on Barbara and you could fill me in about Hallie.",
        "Gwen: Okay. I'll talk to Will. And I'll let you know. All right? That's the best I can do right now.",

        "Chris: Well, considering what he's been through, he's doing great. They'll be taking him to recovery soon.",
        "Alison: That's a relief.",
        "Chris: Score one for the home team, huh?",
        "Alison: You know it. It must be amazing what you did in there, Chris. You saved a life.",
        "Chris: No, correction, we saved a life. I couldn't have done it without you, Allie. Feels great, doesn't it?",
        "Alison: Yeah. It really does.",
        "Chris: Why don't we reward ourselves with a lunch on me?",
        "Alison: Ah, I don't know about that. You know, today was great, but we're not supposed to be tight.",
        "Chris: Why, because of Emily? She's not here, I'm starving and I'm offering to take you to lunch. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm not in the position to ask you to wait, Katie. That wouldn't be fair.",
        "Katie: Why don't you let me decide that? How do you feel about us?",
        "Jack: Conflicted. I don't know how long it's going to take Parker and the kids to heal, and I don't want to make any promises that I can't keep.",
        "Katie: I'm not asking you to make promises, I'm just asking you what you want.",
        "Jack: Well, I don't want to hurt you anymore. Don't depend on me to decide your future.",
        "Katie: In other words, don't wait.",
        "Jack: I want you to find the happiness that you deserve.",
        "Carly: Katie, what a surprise. What brings you by?",
        "Katie: Actually, I was just leaving.",
        "Jack: Katie, I'm sorry. For being confusing. For hurting you again.",
        "Katie: I know. Sometimes things happen that are out of our control.",
        "Jack: Are you all right?",
        "Katie: I'm good. Yeah, just kind of like a big weight has been lifted. Who knows, maybe things are working out the way they should.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey, Grandma. Do you have any apple pie left? I'm starving.",
        "Emma: I'm afraid not. I had quite a day today, and brownies is about the only thing I have.",
        "Noah: Well, anything that comes out of your kitchen, Mrs. Snyder, is a treat.",
        "Emma: Thank you. You know, the, um, the immigration officer came by and he asked to see your living quarters. I'm afraid I had to -- I had to show it to him.",
        "Luke: No, it's okay. We know about that already. Unfortunately, he found us at Java this afternoon.",
        "Noah: We answered all of his questions, so, hopefully he won't be bothering you again.",
        "Emma: Well, good, good, because I'll tell you something, I wasn't very good. This lying, it's not in my nature, I...",

        "Ameera: Thank you.",
        "Emma: Listen, Luke?",
        "Luke: Yes?",
        "Emma: You have to go out to the barn, there's chores for you. Hopefully, the roofer will be here in a bit, and uh, we need to make a space in the hay loft. Let me give you something here. Some brownies because I know you're going to work up an appetite. Here you go, Darling. There's three.",
        "Noah: I'll help you out with your chores as long as I get some brownies. Hey, Luke, I wanted to say thank you for going along to pretending to be Casey's boyfriend.",
        "Luke: Hey, hey. That's not a problem. Besides, it was me that blurted out that Casey's my boyfriend -- I had to think so far something to throw the agent off our case.",
        "Noah: Yeah, you know, if Casey goes along with this, this plan really could work.",
        "Luke: Yeah. But, I do think you need to remind Ameera this is a marriage in name only. Sometimes I get the feeling she thinks it's something else. But this way, you know, she can have more time to get to know Casey and other guys and maybe she can find someone special.",
        "Noah: Luke, no matter how cute you think Casey is, you belong to me.",

        "Plumber: Yeah. Good day.",
        "Gwen: You too. Oh, Boy. What a long day we had. I bet somebody is ready for their nap, yes I do. What do you think, Hallie? Should we take Sofie up on her offer and leave town? As long as I'm with you and Daddy. Nothing else matters. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Chris. I was looking for you at the hospital this morning.",
        "Chris: It was quite a morning.",
        "Sofie: Well, I had something to take care of, so I couldn't wait.",
        "Chris: Is everything all right?",
        "Sofie: Yeah. I just wanted to tell you that I talked to Paul and he promised he won't be a problem.",
        "Chris: You don't need to fight my battles for me, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, well, I was kind of in the middle of it so I wanted to set things right. Um, I'll be back for your order.",
        "Alison: What was that all about?",
        "Chris: Paul Ryan stirring up trouble. What else is new?",
        "Alison: Do you want a rain check on our lunch date?",
        "Chris: No, why would I?",
        "Alison: Seems like you and Sofie have a lot to say to each other.",
        "Chris: Not really. I've had a long hard morning, and I'm looking forward to an uncomplicated lunch with a charming friend.",
        "Alison: Well, I will work on the charming, but, uh, no promises on the uncomplicated.",

        "Brad: So how did it go with Jack?",
        "Katie: Um, let's just say I found out everything I need to know. Where were we? Okay, Folks, you want to turn that frown up side down? Well, we have some tips for you. 3:00 in the morning, you're too wired to sleep, don't make a list of things, make a list of things that make you happy.",
        "Brad: And one of those things would be Jack.",
        "Katie: Just stick to the script, all right?",

        "Carly: Glad to hear it.",

        "Jack: What do you want?",
        "Carly: I want to go forward. I want to build on what we had, when it was good. You have to admit, Jack. We had our moments. Can't we at least try?",
