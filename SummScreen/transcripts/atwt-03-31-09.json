        "Katie: It says right here that expectant mothers shouldn't eat sushi.",
        "Brad: There's a couple here that taught their daughter when she was 5 how to play tennis, and by the time she was 16, she was making $1.5 million on the pro tour.",
        "Katie: Vienna loves sushi. I hope she's staying away from it.",
        "Brad: As another guy taught his son to kick field goals, got him a full scholarship to Wisconsin and $5 million to sign with the Dolphins.",
        "Katie: I wonder if she'd be upset if I asked her about it.",
        "Brad: I remember our field-goal kicker in high school. He was, like, this little, scrawny, geeky guy.",
        "Katie: I would hate for her to think that I'm telling her what to do.",
        "Brad: You know, of course, no one recruited him to kick in college, let alone the pros.",
        "Katie: But she's really responsible.",
        "Brad: You know, of course, he ended up starting his own computer company and made like $6 kazillion. So what does that tell you?",
        "Katie: I do have the right to ask, though, don't I?",
        "Brad: Of course, no kid of mine is gonna be geeky or scrawny, so I guess teaching him how to kick is definitely the way to go.",
        "Katie: Should I do it?",
        "Brad: Of course not.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: I'll take care of it.",
        "Katie: You will?",
        "Brad: Of course!",
        "Katie: That's so sweet.",
        "Brad: What do you know about football, anyway?",
        "Katie: Football?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I was talking about sushi.",
        "Brad: What does sushi have to do with football?",
        "Katie: Nothing. Why would you talk to Vienna about football?",
        "Brad: Vienna?",
        "Katie: What if she's eating sushi and drinking wine or getting her hair dyed or not looking when she's crossing the street?",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. You're worried about the baby.",
        "Katie: Of course I'm worried about the baby!",
        "Brad: The baby's gonna be fine, okay? Who has a healthier body than Vienna? I'm just saying that she's very -- she's health-conscious. She takes care of her body.",
        "Katie: She does, doesn't she?",
        "Brad: And she's European. They're born kickers.",
        "Katie: What is with you and kicking?",
        "Brad: Read this. At least it won't keep you up at night.",
        "Katie: I just wish I could at least ask her.",
        "Brad: Well, why don't you?",
        "Katie: Because you just told me I shouldn't.",
        "Brad: Well, I think I was talking about football. This is our baby. You have a right to talk to her. She probably would love it. A mom-to-mom thing, sort of.",
        "Katie: You think?",
        "Brad: Definitely. Absolutely.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Katie: Hello?",
        "Henry: It's your favorite ex-husband!",
        "Katie: Henry, is something wrong?",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Katie: Then why are you calling?",
        "Henry: We're friends, remember? Can't we talk?",
        "Katie: Something's wrong, isn't it?",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Brad: What's wrong?",
        "Henry: We just wanted to take you guys out to lunch.",
        "Katie: They want to take us to lunch.",
        "Brad: That sounds good to me. I'm starved.",
        "Katie: We can do lunch.",
        "Henry: Lakeview, say, ten minutes.",
        "Katie: We'll be right there. Something's wrong.",
        "Brad: Why?",
        "Katie: Henry's buying.",
        "Brad: Well, I mean, maybe he cleaned up in a game of cards or his book got a movie deal.",
        "Katie: So it could be good news, right?",
        "Brad: Yeah. Could be.",
        "Katie: Okay. Good. I could use some good news.",
        "Brad: Then let's go get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: How could you tell her everything's fine?",
        "Henry: I didn't. I just didn't answer the question. We agreed that we were gonna tell them in person.",
        "Vienna: How do you tell someone her baby's -- gone?",
        "Henry: Technically, it never really existed.",
        "Vienna: It existed in her mind and mine.",
        "Henry: Okay. Okay. So, we'll try the insemination again if you want to.",
        "Vienna: Why wouldn't I?",
        "Henry: No reason.",
        "Vienna: You'd rather I didn't?",
        "Henry: I was never a big fan of the idea to begin with, but I got on board from the start, and I'm not gonna get off.",
        "Vienna: Just admit it, Henry. You're ecstatic that there's no baby!",
        "Henry: I'm not ecstatic.",
        "Vienna: Relieved?",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Vienna: Well, you're not exactly grieving!",
        "Henry: What? What? What do you want me to say?",
        "Vienna: Nothing. You know what? I really don't feel that good.",
        "Henry: That's just the tension.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not. I feel really sick.",
        "Henry: Relax, okay? You'll feel a lot better once we tell the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: What are you doing here?",
        "Luke: I missed you, too.",
        "Noah: You shouldn't be out of bed.",
        "Luke: I'm fine!",
        "Noah: You're not fine! You suffered a major head injury!",
        "Luke: It's not that serious.",
        "Noah: You can't remember what happened.",
        "Luke: All right. Well, maybe it was a little bit serious.",
        "Noah: I guess not enough to knock some sense into you.",
        "Luke: Good one. Anyway, I just had to get out of the house. I love Ethan, but three hours of \"Joey the Jellyfish\" cartoons. It's too much to bear.",
        "Noah: That sounds brutal.",
        "Luke: Anyway, Kim called. Some guy with a ton of money saw the interview she did with me and my mom. He did a little research on the foundation, and he wants to pay for a series of public service announcements against housing discrimination.",
        "Noah: No way! That's awesome.",
        "Luke: So, can you get out of here?",
        "Noah: Now?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I mean, he's at the station, and I'd really like some moral support, especially if I have to be on-camera.",
        "Noah: I guess I could take an early lunch.",
        "Luke: That's great. Let's go.",
        "Noah: It is amazing what can happen from the same interview. I mean, something as good as this and something as bad as that hate mail your mom got.",
        "Luke: And the hit-and-run.",
        "Noah: Well, we aren't sure yet if that's connected.",
        "Luke: I am. There's no doubt in my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: We have just got a whole pile of dead-ends here. The tread analysis came back, but the tire is used on too many cars to get a specific make or model. And as you know, the surveillance camera in that end of the parking lot is out, and there are no eyewitnesses.",
        "Lily: So what do we do now?",
        "Margo: Well, we've reached out to informants and various hate groups, but there's no leads there.",
        "Lily: So, it could have been someone who was careless or drunk.",
        "Holden: Listen, I know you don't want to believe it had anything to do with the foundation.",
        "Lily: It doesn't matter what I want to believe. We just have to wait and see.",
        "Margo: In the meantime, I want you all to be extra careful, please.",
        "Lily: I don't think Luke's gonna pull away from the public outreach he's been doing, and, frankly, I don't think he should.",
        "Holden: Even if someone tried to kill him?",
        "Lily: Holden, I'm as scared as you are, but Luke can't curl up in a ball and hide under the table.",
        "Holden: Yeah. He doesn't need to go looking for trouble either, and neither do you.",
        "Margo: Excuse me. Excuse me. You all need to lay low until we find out who did this.",
        "Holden: What if it wasn't someone from a hate group? What if it wasn't a stranger at all?",
        "Lily: Holden.",
        "Margo: Who?",
        "Holden: Damian Grimaldi.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: So, wait. Holden really believes that your father set up the accident?",
        "Luke: Wait. Holden is my father, and I wouldn't be surprised if Damian did it. Oh, excuse me? Could you tell Kim Hughes that Luke Snyder and Noah Mayer are here to see her? Thanks.",
        "Noah: You know that sounds crazy.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Noah: The idea that Damian paid someone to have you run down. I mean, how could he know you wouldn't be killed?",
        "Luke: Well, he probably hired a professional who knew what they were doing.",
        "Noah: Oh, yeah? You know all about these hired professionals?",
        "Luke: Look, Damian might not be a covert cops type of psycho like your dad is, but you don't know what he's capable of.",
        "Noah: I don't believe he would hurt you.",
        "Luke: But that's based off of a couple conversations you had with him, where he was probably lying through his teeth in order to charm you.",
        "Noah: I'm not so easily charmed.",
        "Luke: Well, I was able to do it, so it couldn't be that hard.",
        "Noah: Ha. Trust me, it wasn't your charm.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm just saying, I know Damian a lot better than you do, and he's not to be trusted.",
        "Noah: I still don't think he would arrange for a hit-and-run on his only son.",
        "Luke: Well, either way, I hope we got the message across that we want him the hell out of here.",
        "Noah: I think he got the message.",
        "Kim: Hi, you two! Thanks so much for coming on such short notice.",
        "Luke: Of course. We think it's a great idea.",
        "Kim: Oh, I know! PSA announcements are very helpful. I think we'll probably do the first one with you and your mother.",
        "Luke: Oh, that's great. The foundation's been getting so many calls still from the interview that you --",
        "Kim: Yeah, I know. The station is, too. It's wonderful.",
        "Luke: So, when do we start?",
        "Kim: You have to meet the donor.",
        "Luke: Of course. Where is he?",
        "Damian: Right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: We checked out Damian as soon as we found out that he was the one who brought Luke to the hospital, but no one saw him at the scene of the crime, and his car was clean.",
        "Holden: Okay. Do you really think it's a coincidence that Luke gets run down, and Damian just happens to be there in time to play hero and save Luke's life?",
        "Margo: I have no evidence to think otherwise.",
        "Holden: Keep looking. It's there.",
        "Margo: You really think that he would run down his own son?",
        "Holden: If he didn't do it, then he paid somebody to do it.",
        "Lily: I don't trust him, either. And I know only too well what Damian's capable of, but I don't think he would play games with Luke's life. He's here to rebuild their relationship.",
        "Holden: Which is exactly the reason why he would do it. Luke doesn't want anything to do with him, so what better way to turn the kid around than to save his life?",
        "Margo: Unless he was here for something else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I can't believe you set me up like this!",
        "Kim: Listen. I was thinking about the value of the PSA announcements. Believe me, I had no intention of upsetting you.",
        "Damian: Don't blame Ms. Hughes. I convinced her you'd never consider it if you knew I was involved.",
        "Luke: You're damn right.",
        "Damian: All right. But now that we're all here, can we at least discuss it?",
        "Luke: No! No! Damian, what the hell are you trying to prove?",
        "Damian: That I'm serious about making amends.",
        "Luke: And you think you can just write a check, and it's done?",
        "Damian: Well, it's a start. Look. You should consider what's best for your cause. Yeah. Public service TV campaign can reach a lot of people, Luciano.",
        "Luke: Damian, what's best for my cause is if you stay far, far away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: When you and Luke did Kim's show last week, you said that Luke had started the foundation with money he got from Damian's family.",
        "Lily: He did.",
        "Margo: Maybe Damian doesn't want the Grimaldi name associated with the foundation.",
        "Holden: So you're saying that he isn't here to win Luke back, but maybe to scare him off.",
        "Margo: It's possible, isn't it?",
        "Holden: It is, but we still need to protect Luke and Lily.",
        "Lily: Damian is not after me.",
        "Margo: No, no. We haven't ruled out the hate groups yet, and you did receive that letter.",
        "Holden: So what do we do now?",
        "Margo: Well, I keep investigating because this is all just speculation. I can't move on anything yet. And you two, keep your eyes open.",
        "Holden: For how long?",
        "Margo: I don't know.",
        "Holden: You know what? That's not good enough.",
        "Lily: Holden.",
        "Holden: You may have to play by the rules, but I don't.",
        "Margo: Holden, please don't take this into your own hands.",
        "Holden: I won't unless I have to. There's nothing I won't do to protect my family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey! You guys are here!",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Katie: We got you a gift. It's a photo album. So, the next time you get a sonogram, you can use the picture as the first baby picture in the book.",
        "Vienna: I think I'm gonna be sick.",
        "Katie: I can take the album back.",
        "Vienna: No. It's not that. My stomach's been doing flips all morning.",
        "Katie: It's probably morning sickness. That should be happening by now.",
        "Vienna: No, it's something I ate, probably.",
        "Katie: You didn't eat sushi, did you?",
        "Vienna: No!",
        "Katie: Did you get your hair dyed? 'Cause you know that can be really bad for the baby.",
        "Henry: It's not hair dye.",
        "Brad: Okay. Then what is it? What is going on?",
        "Henry: Vienna, why don't you just spit it out?",
        "Vienna: I can't spit it out. I think I'm gonna throw up.",
        "Katie: Is she okay?",
        "Henry: Yeah. It's just an upset stomach.",
        "Katie: You're sure?",
        "Henry: I'm positive! She'll be back in a minute.",
        "Katie: I feel terrible.",
        "Brad: Well, maybe it's something going around.",
        "Katie: No, no. I don't mean that way. It's just, I feel so healthy, and it doesn't seem fair. Vienna's green with morning sickness, and I've never felt better.",
        "Brad: Well, good thing we don't have to have babies, right? That would suck.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it would. If men had to have babies, then there would be no babies.",
        "Brad: That is so true.",
        "Katie: But it's good. The morning sickness thing is actually a good sign. It means her hormone levels are up, and everything's going fine. Okay! What is wrong?",
        "Henry: What? With me? Nothing. Nothing. I was just thinking about this hysterical chapter in my book, \"The Man from Oakdale.\" You finished reading it, right? Everyone's reading it. Of course you finished it. But you know what? This is a great chapter. I think I'll go upstairs and get another copy of it.",
        "Katie: Henry, sit! What aren't you telling us?",
        "Henry: What makes you ask that?",
        "Katie: You're evading the question.",
        "Henry: No, I'm not.",
        "Brad: You're talking to a professional interviewer. So, what's going on?",
        "Henry: Let's just wait for Vienna to get back down, okay? Hey, excuse me! Excuse me! Could I get a martini, please? Katie?",
        "Katie: Water's fine.",
        "Brad: Me, too.",
        "Henry: Okay. Wild crowd. Could you make that a double? Looks like I'm drinking for three.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Want some lunch?",
        "Holden: No, thanks.",
        "Lily: You're upset.",
        "Holden: No kidding.",
        "Lily: It'll be okay.",
        "Holden: If I find out that Damian tried to run down Luke --",
        "Lily: I don't think he did it. He wants to make things right with Luke.",
        "Holden: That's what he always says -- no agenda. He just wants to reconnect. Every couple of years, he comes back here. He tries to worm his way into everyone's lives. He gets shut down, and then he goes. You'd think he would have figured out that it doesn't work by now.",
        "Lily: I'll admit his tactics aren't always smart, but he'd be crazy to think he could win Luke back by running him over.",
        "Holden: Well, if it wasn't Damian, whoever it was, whoever did the hit-and-run is still out there, and we don't have a clue who that is.",
        "Lily: Margo will find him.",
        "Holden: I hope so.",
        "Lily: And Damian will go away again, once he realizes that there's no place for him in Luke's life.",
        "Holden: Or yours.",
        "Lily: Or mine. That ship sailed a long time ago.",
        "Holden: Good.",
        "Lily: And the position is now permanently filled.",
        "Holden: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I can't believe he can show up here and act like everything's forgotten.",
        "Noah: I'm sure he doesn't think it's that simple.",
        "Luke: Whatever. I don't even care.",
        "Noah: Yeah, clearly not.",
        "Luke: All right, I care. But I'm not gonna fall for another one of his stupid pranks.",
        "Noah: Oh, I understand that. But you know, Kim was right. Those PSAs can be really effective.",
        "Luke: I'm not gonna let him bribe me.",
        "Noah: So take yourself out of it. If he wants to make a contribution to the foundation, let him.",
        "Luke: My mom and I are in the first ad.",
        "Noah: But Damian doesn't have to be there. If he wants to just write his checks, let him do that, and forget about it.",
        "Luke: No, no. I'm not taking his money.",
        "Noah: Luke, you started all this with his money.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but that was different. He wasn't here.",
        "Noah: You don't even have to talk to him!",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, you make it sound so easy. But tell me something, truthfully. If your father showed up and started doing what Damian is doing, how would you feel?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: What are you doing here?",
        "Damian: I didn't mean to intrude.",
        "Holden: You were looking in our window!",
        "Damian: I need to speak to Lily.",
        "Holden: No, you don't.",
        "Damian: It's important.",
        "Lily: What do you want from us?",
        "Damian: I need to ask you a favor.",
        "Holden: Oh, come on. You're not serious?",
        "Damian: It's about our son.",
        "Holden: Hasn't Luke made it very clear he wants you out of his life?",
        "Lily: Holden.",
        "Damian: Thank you.",
        "Lily: What kind of favor?",
        "Damian: I wanted to do something for Luke, so I got in touch with Kim Hughes at WOAK. I wanted to pay for a series of public service announcements on housing discrimination, and Luke wouldn't allow it.",
        "Lily: And you're surprised?",
        "Damian: I'd like you to reason with him. Just convince him that I'm just trying to help.",
        "Lily: You're assuming that I think that's all you're really after.",
        "Damian: Have I done anything at all to make you think otherwise? I just don't want to -- look, I want to help him, and I want to show him that I've changed.",
        "Lily: I have to admit, a series of PSAs would be a tremendous boost to the work we're doing.",
        "Holden: Lily.",
        "Damian: Will you tell Luke that?",
        "Lily: I'll call him right now.",
        "Holden: Lily, what are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Luke: What's up, Mom?",
        "Lily: Damian's here.",
        "Luke: At the house?",

        "Vienna: Yes! Yes! Twins run in my family.",
        "Katie: Wouldn't they have been able to tell that on the sonogram?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes. They would have. They would have been able to see that. And what did they see on the sonogram, Liebchen?",
        "Vienna: Well, sometimes on a sonogram, one twin can shield the other from the sonogram, and their hearts beat so close, it sounds like one.",

        "Vienna: Maybe then, but now I can feel it. I know my body!",

        "Noah: I don't know, and neither do you.",
        "Luke: You know, that is one of things I really love about you. You totally go for that whole \"innocent until proven guilty\" thing.",
        "Noah: I thought you did, too.",
        "Luke: Most of the time. Some people don't deserve it, though.",
        "Noah: Maybe this time someone does.",

        "Damian: Then maybe you'll give me a chance to prove myself.",
        "Noah: I'm not the one you need to convince.",
        "Damian: Yes, you are, because you can help me reach my son.",
        "Noah: Sorry, but you're gonna have to do that for yourself.",

        "Liberty: I have a husband now, Mom. There's nothing I can do about that.",
        "Janet: You can get an annulment.",
        "Carly: Parker chose Craig. You may not like it, but there's nothing you can do about it!",
        "Jack: I guess you decided whose side you're on.",
        "Meg: I spent the night at Fairwinds with Paul."
