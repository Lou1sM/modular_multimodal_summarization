        "Katie: She was wearing her hair all tucked up in this weird, black, leather hat.",
        "Margo: So she was wearing a hat. A lot of people wear hats.",
        "Katie: And big, huge sunglasses? In Illinois? In April? I don't think so.",
        "Margo: Okay, okay, Pilar was wearing a hat and sunglasses. So what?",
        "Katie: And she was with a strange man --",
        "[With Russian accent]",
        "Margo: Ooh, Boris Badenov?",
        "Katie: Margo, I'm serious. The guy ran off when I showed up.",
        "Margo: Katherine! How many people have to tell you to let this go? Take the hint. It's none of your business.",
        "Katie: So there is something?",
        "Margo: I didn't say that.",
        "Katie: But if it's none of my business, it's some of someone else's business. So it is something. And you know what it is. Don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: You think I'm lying to you?",
        "Mike: I think that you're neglecting to tell me the whole story.",
        "Pilar: But I told you, he's an old friend --",
        "Mike: From Oakdale? What's his name?",
        "Pilar: No, he's not from Oakdale. He's from Spain.",
        "Mike: And he just happened to be passing through Oakdale?",
        "Pilar: No, I told you. He came -- to find me because -- he wanted to warn me. My ex-boyfriend called him. He was worried about me. I'd called him, from the hospital. When I was mugged. So he knew where I was --",
        "Mike: You're lying. All right? As close as we've been, and as much as I care about you, I am not playing these games with you.",
        "Pilar: I guess it's a good thing somebody stole everything I had. At least I won't have to spend a lot of time packing. Don't worry, Michael, I will be out of your way before you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: There's a line. It may be hard for you to detect in a family-run corporation like this. But there is one. And you just crossed it.",
        "Jordan: I don't think so.",
        "Paul: My relationship with my mother is your business --",
        "Jordan: Your reasons for returning to B.R.O., Paul, not your relationship. I could care less if you hate each other, as long as you both love B.R.O.",
        "Paul: B.R.O.'s profits have more than doubled since I've been back on board.",
        "Jordan: There have been some short-term gains. Yes.",
        "Paul: And your interest, somehow, is the long term? You think I've planted some kind of time bomb someplace?",
        "Jordan: I don't know how far you would go, to achieve your real purpose.",
        "Paul: And what would that be?",
        "Jordan: That's what I'm asking. Are your motives professional? Because I'm beginning to suspect that what's driving you is personal.",
        "Paul: What brought all this on?",
        "Jordan: Oh, come on. The whole industry knows about your love/hate thing with your mother.",
        "Paul: What's your mother like, Jordan?",
        "Jordan: I never met her.",
        "Paul: Well, take it from me. With a mother like mine, you reach a point where there's no point in arguing.",
        "Jordan: And maybe every reason for revenge.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, I decided against champagne, martinis for everyone -- extra dry, extra olives. Is something wrong?",
        "Jordan: Yes. Yes, I think there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: B&E, assault, robbery, possession of stolen property, transportation of stolen property across state lines -- plus, there's that suspended sentence in Palm Springs in '92 for fencing a sapphire tiara, which the owner later remembered she let you borrow. You like rich women?",
        "De Grassi: Who doesn't?",
        "Jack: You must be real fond of Rosanna Cabot then. Is she gonna visit you in stir? I guess it was all worth it. Taking the fall for someone like that. Instant respect in the cell block, right? First-time loser going down for a rich blonde?",
        "De Grassi: That's your story, not mine.",
        "Jack: It sounds like Rosanna's story, her plan, her patsy. I'm just curious. Why would she have you break into a house where she used to live? She wasn't interested in the antiques. No, that was your angle. You went in there after something she couldn't get herself. Right? What was that?",
        "De Grassi: You wanna know what she wanted?",
        "Jack: I'm curious.",
        "De Grassi: You can ask her yourself when you find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You want me to stop working with Paul? Throw out dozens of designs --",
        "Rosanna: What you do with your designs -- they're your designs.",
        "Carly: Based on a strategy that I created with Paul, for B.R.O., to market and produce --",
        "Rosanna: So we come up with a new marketing strategy. We find a new factory. I gave you a blank check. I will back any venture that you want. Just not with Paul Ryan. I can't have him in my life.",
        "Carly: Well, Rosanna, I really understand how you feel. When Paul told me what he had done -- I never wanted to set eyes on him again. Telling the police where Cabot was, is inexcusable.",
        "Rosanna: Good. I'm glad you feel that way.",
        "Carly: He should have gone to you, when he found out there was a problem with the adoption. He should have gone to you, but he didn't. He put his hatred for Craig above his friendship with you.",
        "Rosanna: Yes. That's exactly the way I feel. And I'm glad that you understand. And I know that I'm asking a lot. I know a blank check is a long way from success in the fashion world. And Paul helped you. But I can't have him in my life. So if you and I are going to be close --",
        "Carly: Hey, I'm mad at him, too. And I told him that, right before I came over here. He hurt you. He knows that. He feels terrible about it.",
        "Rosanna: Good. He should.",
        "Carly: He does. He knows that he made a terrible mistake. He wasn't thinking straight. It was a very tough time for him -- Rose's death. You weren't there, at the wedding. He wasn't himself. It's like he had some kind of breakdown, or something. And then to be accused of murdering Rose -- and to find out that Craig set him up because he was jealous of his friendship with you --",
        "Rosanna: Wait, wait, wait -- wait -- please tell me you're not blaming me.",
        "Carly: No. No, this is Craig's fault. And yeah, Paul did something really terrible, but --",
        "Rosanna: Yes, he did. But it's -- what are you saying? It's understandable?",
        "Carly: No. Yeah. Yes, it is understandable. If a person has basically lost their mind to grief, they're bound to make a few stupid mistakes.",
        "Rosanna: And if it was Parker? Or Sage? If you lost one of your children because somebody was upset and didn't think -- would you want him in your life? Or the life of anybody close to you?",
        "[Door knock]",
        "Craig: Rosanna. Are you in there? Rosanna. [Door knock] Rosanna! Rosanna! [Craig giggles] You're safe! Oh God, I was going out of my mind.",
        "Rosanna: I -- I -- we have a lot to discuss. You're the reason that I came home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Casey! We've got to get to practice.",
        "Katie: So, if you know what this woman is up to, why can't you just tell me?",
        "Margo: Casey?! He's got his headphones on.",
        "Katie: Okay, how can I convince you that this is not the jealousy thing? Not this time. This is serious, Margo. Mike could be in real trouble.",
        "Margo: Oh, and you're going to protect him?",
        "Katie: So he is in trouble?",
        "Margo: I didn't say that.",
        "Katie: Is he in danger?",
        "Margo: From you? Yes, yes. Case!",
        "Katie: Or from Pilar. Or this man who mugged her, or supposedly mugged her, or followed her here --",
        "Margo: Katie, as your sister who loves you -- and as an officer of the law, I am begging you, please, to stay out of this.",
        "Katie: I can't. I can't, Margo. Don't you understand that? I love him. Only we can't be together because Simon is alive. Which I'm, of course, glad that Simon is alive. But for some reason, Mike was fine with me loving Simon when he was dead. But now that he isn't, he isn't. So we're stuck. Only I still love him. And if he's in trouble, I have to help him.",
        "Margo: Katie, sometimes the people we love have to work things out on their own. I can't win Tom's cases and he can't solve mine --",
        "Katie: This isn't a case, Margo. This is Mike's life we're talking about.",
        "Margo: You don't know that.",
        "Katie: What am I supposed to think when you won't tell me anything?",
        "Margo: Katie -- go home. Good night. Casey!",
        "Katie: I'm gonna find out! I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: If you're waitin' on me to call your bluff, it's not gonna happen.",
        "Pilar: I arrive on your doorstep, bleeding. I can't tell you the whole story, and what I do tell you doesn't make sense. It's too much to ask. I understand. Michael, you are a wonderful man. I wish my life weren't so complicated.",
        "Mike: Look, whatever's goin' on -- it is obvious that you're in trouble.",
        "Pilar: It's not your problem.",
        "Mike: Pilar, please!",
        "Pilar: Forget I came here, okay? I'll be fine.",
        "Mike: Look, if it's not safe for you to leave, where are you going to go?",
        "Pilar: If I can make it to the courtyard and back again, it must be safe, right?",
        "Mike: Hey, come on -- I mean, you tell me you're in too much pain to get out of bed. Then, you disappear. You don't leave a note. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.",
        "Pilar: You don't trust me. And that's my fault. But I can't convince you, and I don't want to torture you anymore. So I'm going --",
        "Mike: You're not torturing me.",
        "Pilar: Go back to Katie. Be happy. And forget about me.",
        "Mike: Wait. Where will you go?",
        "Pilar: I'm sorry. I can't tell you that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Jordan is just reconsidering his options.",
        "Jordan: That's not true.",
        "Paul: Then remember this -- you work for me -- you answer to me -- I don't answer to you. Excuse me.",
        "Jennifer: What happened?",
        "Jordan: I don't want to talk about it with your brother looking over my shoulder.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, I want you to tell me what's going on.",
        "Jordan: Then, come on. I'll tell you everything I know, which isn't much.",
        "Lucy: I was just looking for you --",
        "Paul: Have you seen Rosanna?",
        "Lucy: What do you mean?",
        "Paul: Well, she's here, she's back and she's safe.",
        "Lucy: She is? That's great! Well, is she at Fairwinds? When did you talk to her? You know what, you can tell me in the car --",
        "Paul: Wait, she's not at Fairwinds. She's here. She's upstairs. She took a suite, here at the Lakeview.",
        "Lucy: Oh. Well, of course she did. Things are kind of a mess with my father. That makes sense that she doesn't want to go home yet.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Lucy: Well, let's go. I can't wait to see her.",
        "Paul: Lucy, there's something that I need to tell you first.",
        "Lucy: Can it wait?",
        "Paul: No, it can't wait. I don't want you to hear this from anyone else.",
        "Lucy: Hear what?",
        "Paul: I'm responsible. I did something to Rosanna -- and to say that I regret it -- I made a terrible mistake.",
        "Lucy: What did you do, Paul? Whatever it is, you can tell me. I'm your friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So you came home because of me?",
        "Rosanna: Why don't you come in, Craig? We have much to discuss. Carly and I were just catching up. Carly, this conversation with Craig won't wait.",
        "Carly: Oh, I -- I understand. I'll go.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, thank you. Why don't you help yourself to a drink? I'll be right with you. I know you're upset and confused. Okay?",
        "Carly: This is a lot to take in.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I understand that. And I'm not trying to hurt you. Okay? I'm just trying to look out for both of us. So, think about what I said. Let me know what you decide.",
        "Carly: Good-bye, Craig.",
        "Craig: Good-bye, Carly.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no. No, thank you.",
        "Craig: Well, all that with Carly was serious.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, it was. It was. But you and I have our own issues to resolve.",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah, I -- I was so worried -- I have missed you. Lucy's missed you. Everything went to hell when you took off like that --",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, listen. I have some things that I need to say, and --",
        "Craig: You left everything in such a mess, when you disappeared. I don't think you ever understood what I was really trying to --",
        "Rosanna: I know -- I understand what you were trying to do. I wanted a child. You wanted to give me one. Unfortunately, when you steal a baby --",
        "Craig: I didn't steal a baby. Okay? I cut corners, all right, but I swear I thought Cabot was ours. Free and clear.",
        "Rosanna: You knew that adoption wasn't legal.",
        "Craig: No, I didn't. What I knew was that you wouldn't be happy, unless we adopted. And none of the agencies you found would touch us. Well, not me, anyway. So -- so I found an agency that didn't seem to care whether my background was problematic. And I filled out all their papers. And I answered all their questions. And I paid their price and I brought you a child.",
        "Rosanna: He's gone, Craig.",
        "Craig: Well, what was I supposed to do? That all came up after the fact --",
        "Rosanna: I can't believe you're gonna stand around and try to justify it.",
        "Craig: I lost him, too! All right?! I lost, too. What, you don't think I know how hard this is? You don't think I know how you hurt? How you are devastated? So am I. You think -- you think I wanted this to happen? I did everything I could to make you happy. And I was happy, because we were happy. And to lose that -- to feel you slipping away. But I still wear this ring, you know, because I still love you. And I will still do everything it takes -- whatever it takes, therapy, counseling --",
        "Rosanna: Can you bring him back?",
        "Craig: What is this?",
        "Rosanna: Open it.",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Rosanna: That's what I want.",
        "Craig: A divorce?",
        "Rosanna: There are two copies. You can sign them both. I'll have them executed first thing in the morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Katie.",
        "Katie: Is Pilar here?",
        "Mike: No, she isn't.",
        "Katie: Well, I guess maybe that's a good thing.",
        "Mike: What do you want?",
        "Katie: Look, I know I told you that I was going to leave Pilar alone -- and I had every intention of doing that -- until I ran into her, quite by accident. And let me tell you, Mike, she was acting really weird.",
        "Mike: Well, do you blame her? After what you've put her through?",
        "Katie: I wasn't putting her through anything. I was minding my own business and being very nice. I said hello, I asked her who her friend was --",
        "Mike: What friend?",
        "Katie: That's what I'm trying to tell you. She was dressed up in some sort of disguise. She was with this weird guy, who took off the minute I got there. It was very bizarre.",
        "Mike: So you've said.",
        "Katie: Then I went to see Margo -- who finally admitted to me that there is a police investigation going on into Pilar. Mike, what's going on?",
        "Mike: I'm not discussing Pilar with you.",
        "Katie: Why? Because she's suddenly so important to you? More important than me?",
        "Mike: Because it's none of your business.",
        "Katie: Fine. I'll ask her when she gets back.",
        "Mike: She says she's not coming back --",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Mike: I'm not discussing Pilar with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #1: Message from your wife.",
        "Jack: Rosanna's --",
        "Carly: Jack, did they tell you I called? They wouldn't let me talk to you.",
        "Jack: Rosanna's home? She's in Oakdale?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I just saw her at the Lakeview.",
        "Jack: She seem all right?",
        "Carly: Yeah, she looks fine. No one hold her captive, that's for sure.",
        "Jack: So everything's okay?",
        "Carly: Well, not exactly. No.",
        "Jack: What's wrong?",
        "Carly: Rosanna's still pretty raw. You know, torn up about Cabot.",
        "Jack: That never goes away.",
        "Carly: That's the problem. She just found out that Paul is the one who called the Canadian authorities. Craig was right. And she's so furious with him that she can't see straight.",
        "Jack: Well, I can understand why.",
        "Carly: I'm mad at him, too. What a lousy thing to do. The problem is that I have to --",
        "Jack: You got to work with him.",
        "Carly: Not for long, if Rosanna has her way. She made it crystal clear that I have to choose -- drop Paul or lose my sister.",
        "Jack: Honey, I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Me, too. I don't want to lose Rosanna, Jack. But I've worked so hard, and this feels so right, working with Paul. He's a pro. He knows this business. He's exactly what I need.",
        "Jack: But I take it, none of that means anything to Rosanna.",
        "Carly: He betrayed her. She does not want that man in her life, not even if it's just through me.",
        "Jack: Well, that's what she wants. What do you want?",
        "Carly: Both. I want my sister and I want my career.",
        "Jack: So go for it, babe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: No, not like this. Not without even trying.",
        "Rosanna: You are never going to convince me that what you did was right, or even just misguided. I asked you point-blank, whether the adoption was legal. And you said yes, that Cabot was ours.",
        "Craig: That's what I believed.",
        "Rosanna: Because that's what you needed me to believe, because you were using that child to soften me up.",
        "Craig: No, I wasn't.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, you were. Our marriage was already under duress because of your little escapade with Barbara -- I don't know if you remember that. When you stole her designs and had her locked up in the cabin in the woods? That cost me my company. Fine -- I don't care about the money. But my child? That I cannot forgive.",
        "Craig: Everything I did -- I did out of my love for you.",
        "Rosanna: I can't survive your love. I'm not that strong.",
        "Craig: Well -- well, maybe that's how you feel now. All right? But in time --",
        "Rosanna: No. In time, I hopefully will have moved on.",
        "Craig: Huh.",
        "Rosanna: I've been quite generous here. I'm not making any claim on Fairwinds. I'm letting you keep the investment I made in Metro, plus, a sizeable cash settlement.",
        "Craig: I'm not interested in your money.",
        "Rosanna: If you weren't interested in my money, you never would have given me a second look.",
        "Craig: Oh! That is such an insult.",
        "Rosanna: No, it's not an insult. Well -- maybe you never would have married me, but you did. So I am making you a fair deal. I have talked to my attorneys and they've said that there is no way you can keep me from divorcing you. So, if you don't take it, you will lose it. If you don't do me this one favor, if you don't make it easy on me --",
        "Craig: Easy? Easy? It's supposed to be hard. I thought we were married. I was. I thought we loved each other. I loved you. It's supposed to be hard to sever that bond! I'm not going to make it easy for you.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Then you'll lose everything you've got -- your house, your club, every cent that you have. I will drag you into court and I will make sure that every paper in the country knows every lurid detail and Lucy will hate you even more than she already does.",
        "Craig: You -- you would do anything to Lucy?",
        "Rosanna: Sign the papers -- or its war.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Cheers.",
        "Jennifer: That depends. What were you and my brother fighting about?",
        "Jordan: I wouldn't call it a fight exactly.",
        "Jennifer: I haven't seen Paul that angry in a while.",
        "Jordan: I pushed a button, that's for sure.",
        "Jennifer: So, what happened?",
        "Jordan: I took your advice. I asked him straight out, why'd he come back to B.R.O.? I told him I was aware of recent events, and his history with Barbara, and I wanted to understand his motives. You saw his reaction.",
        "Jennifer: Why did this come up?",
        "Jordan: What do you mean?",
        "Jennifer: When you sent your resume to my mother, you knew about the recent history and that Paul had come back to B.R.O. So why is it suddenly an issue?",
        "Jordan: I guess it was something Rosanna Cabot said to me.",
        "Jennifer: When we were at the Lakeview?",
        "Jordan: No, afterwards. I ran into her outside of my room. She's moved into the suite across the hall from me. Anyway, she was charming, we chatted, and since she knew that I worked at B.R.O., She -- she felt that she had to warn me about Paul.",
        "Jennifer: She what?",
        "Jordan: I know. I thought they were friends.",
        "Jennifer: Well, they were friends. During the investigation into Rose's murder, Rosanna was Paul's strongest ally.",
        "Jordan: Well, all I can say is that things have changed. She is very suspicious about this reconciliation between Paul and Barbara. She can't imagine Paul forgiving Barbara under any circumstances. Which leads her to believe that Paul has come back to B.R.O. Under false pretenses. And that, in fact, he plans to hurt Barbara or sandbag B.R.O.",
        "Jennifer: But -- Rosanna and Paul -- it's not just a casual friendship. She's put herself on the line for him and he's done the same for her.",
        "Jordan: I know.",
        "Jennifer: What happened?",
        "Jordan: I'm not exactly sure.",
        "Jennifer: She didn't tell you what caused this total change of heart?",
        "Jordan: She said a couple of things. She said that Paul lied to her.",
        "Jennifer: She used those words?",
        "Jordan: Yes. She said that he betrayed her. And that because of Paul she had lost something priceless.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I wasn't thinking at all. I was just fixated on Craig and getting back with Craig --",
        "Lucy: So you're saying that you were the one who called the Canadian police? That you're the one responsible for -- that was the reason that they came and took Cabot away?",
        "Paul: I wasn't thinking at all, Lucy. I was just focused on Craig. I mean, he committed a crime. That the adoption was illegal. And I made a stupid, selfish mistake and I didn't -- think about the impact that it would have on you or Cabot -- and Rosanna. And that was wrong. The point that I'm trying to make is that I didn't set out to hurt Rosanna.",
        "Lucy: No, just my father.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Well, he'd hurt me. Now there was a baby in the picture and a birth mother who had no idea where her baby was --",
        "Lucy: Don't pretend you care about Cabot's birth mother.",
        "Paul: I'm just trying to get you to understand what my thinking was like at the time.",
        "Lucy: If you were thinking about anybody but yourself, you would have gone to Rosanna. You're supposed to be her friend, Paul, or at least you were pretending to be.",
        "Paul: No, no. I wasn't pretending. I cared very much about Rosanna. I still do.",
        "Lucy: Then why didn't you go to her? She's smart, she has connections. I mean, if you'd just explained the situation to her, she could've figured it out. But instead you called the police and then they came and took Cabot without any warning. You know, Rosanna barely got to say goodbye to Cabot. Think about him. He's just a baby. To be ripped away from his mother like that?!",
        "Paul: I tried, you know? I tried to fix it. I tried to get her out of the country. But it was too late. It's like I said, it was a stupid, selfish mistake. I've hurt people that I love. I couldn't possibly be more sorry. Lucy, listen --",
        "Lucy: Don't touch me. I barely know who you are anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm not going to do this. Not like this.",
        "Rosanna: Fine. I'll give you some time -- a very little time -- to consider your options. Call me when you've reached a decision.",
        "Craig: Okay, so now I'm dismissed?",
        "Rosanna: Well, I don't really see that we have very much else left to say to each other.",
        "Craig: Oh. What about your disappearance, huh? You suddenly lose contact with everybody and disappear under strange circumstances. We were all frantic. Lucy was scared to death!",
        "Rosanna: I'm aware that there was a misunderstanding about --",
        "Craig: A misunderstanding?!",
        "Rosanna: -- About my itinerary. But I sent a telegram.",
        "Craig: No. Oh, no, you didn't. The man who broke into our house sent a telegram, Rosanna. Jack and I tracked him to New York. We were afraid you were kidnapped, or --",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean you tracked -- you tracked someone?",
        "Craig: Yes, we tracked him to New York. He was arrested. And he is now in custody.",
        "Rosanna: Somebody's been arrested?",
        "Craig: Somebody named De Grassi. Jack is working on him right now, trying to find out where you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You wanna stick with Paul because of the business thing? I've got your back. Okay? You have my blessing. We'll work things out with Rosanna.",
        "Carly: But I understand how she feels. And I do not want to lose her. It's been awful these last couple of weeks thinking that something might have happened to her. If I had to know that she was around without being able to talk to her and see her. How would I explain that to Parker or Sage? They love her, and she needs them in her life right now.",
        "Jack: She say where she's been the last couple of weeks -- what she's been up to?",
        "Carly: No. I don't think it matters, does it? Now that she's back. That's what I wanted to tell you. You can ease up on this guy, De Grassi -- cut him loose.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: Come on. I'm gonna have to buy you a badge, Officer Carly.",
        "Carly: Oh, I think you can come up with other ways to show your appreciation.",
        "Jack: Get outta here before I violate the morals code again. [Jack sighs] What are you up to, Rosanna? Whatever it is, now that you're back, I don't have much time to figure it out.",
        "Jack: Mr. De Grassi! How'd you like me to drop all the charges?",
        "De Grassi: And I can get outta here?",
        "Jack: I'll personally escort you to the airport.",
        "De Grassi: What's the catch?",
        "Jack: No catch. Just tell me how Rosanna's involved in this mess -- all of it from the start -- and you're a free man.",
        "De Grassi: I can get this deal in writing?",
        "Jack: I think I can work that out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Katie: What? She's not answering her cell?",
        "Mike: No, and there's no way to tell where she's gone either.",
        "Katie: If she is gone -- she isn't coming back for something she conveniently left here.",
        "Mike: Stop making her out to be this conniving person.",
        "Katie: I'm just saying I don't think you've seen the last of her. Which is a shame because she's going to bring you nothing but trouble.",
        "Mike: You don't know that.",
        "Katie: She showed up out of the blue with a knife wound.",
        "Mike: That's not her fault.",
        "Katie: All right. You know what the problem here is? Me.",
        "Mike: That's the first smart thing you've said since you got here.",
        "Katie: See, you're mad at me! So anything I say, you're gonna disagree with. Which is why you're not listening when I'm telling you that she is going to hurt you.",
        "Mike: No, I did hear you. That's the problem. I listened to you.",
        "Katie: You did?",
        "Mike: Yes. And I started doubting Pilar, suspecting her based on you and your stupid ideas.",
        "Katie: They are not stupid, Mike --",
        "Mike: Now she's somewhere out there all alone.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Don't count on it.",
        "Mike: See? You're doing it again.",
        "Katie: What? You don't believe me? That she was with some strange man?",
        "[Mike sighs]",
        "Mike: No --",
        "Katie: So what?",
        "Mike: Look, you don't know who that guy was. You don't what they were doing together or what it all means.",
        "Katie: Do you?",
        "Mike: I don't need to! All I need to do was trust her because she needed me. And because of you, she's somewhere out there.",
        "Katie: Oh, you're blaming me?!",
        "Mike: Yeah, you better believe it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I guess that explains why he was in such a mood earlier. He'd just come from seeing Rosanna. Obviously they had an argument. I'll have to talk to him. Look, we can't take anything that Rosanna says as gospel. If she's upset and angry, of course she's going to put a bad spin on Mom and Paul and these motives he supposedly has.",
        "Jordan: Well, I considered that. But still, she has a valid point. Why did Paul return to B.R.O.?",
        "Jennifer: Paul built B.R.O. I mean, I don't mean to shortchange my mother but you and I both know that there are a lot of talented designers who go nowhere because they don't have sufficient backing or a business plan or any help. Paul put her on the map.",
        "Jordan: Well, he could've taken those skills anywhere. Why come back to Barbara after she made him so unhappy?",
        "Jennifer: Well, that's -- that's trickier. When we discovered that will was responsible for rose's death, Paul realized that the only way to help him was to grit his teeth and forgive my mother and try to make things work. I mean, he knows he can't change her and that he's the one who's gonna have to bend. And yes, I understand it's a huge shift. I understand why people might question it. But it was the only way. If he wanted to help will, then he had to let go of all this grief and resentment. He had to move forward. You know, and to her credit, my Mom has made a huge effort, too. [Cell phone rings] Oh, sorry.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, god, it's the sanitarium. Will? Honey, are you okay? Oh. Oh, that's great. Could you hold on one second, hon? He passed some evaluation and they allowed him a phone call, and he wants to talk to me. So --",
        "Jordan: I understand. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, thank you. Oh, Will, it's so great to hear your voice, hon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Lucy, everyone makes mistakes. And I admit, this was a huge one, but --",
        "Lucy: This wasn't a mistake. It doesn't make sense. How could you do this?",
        "Paul: You're right. It doesn't make sense. It was selfish and impulsive. You say you don't know me -- I don't even know myself.",
        "[Lucy sobbing]",
        "Lucy: Rosanna -- I have to -- I can't talk to you. I have to go find her!",
        "Paul: Lucy, I think you should give Rosanna some space --",
        "Lucy: I think you don't should tell me what I should do.",
        "Paul: I'm gonna find a way to make this up to you.",
        "Lucy: You can't.",

        "Rosanna: Craig, I have some things I need to do.",
        "Craig: I thought you were telling me about our future?",
        "Rosanna: We have no future. And the sooner you accept that, the better off you'll be. Now I'm asking you to leave.",
        "Craig: All right, fine. What about Lucy? She was scared to death.",
        "Rosanna: I called Lucy. I left her a message. I'm going to see her as soon as I possibly can. As for you, let me know when you've made your decision. I'll have the courier pick up the papers as soon as possible. Now go.",
        "Craig: This is a mistake.",
        "Rosanna: De Grassi, how could you be so stupid?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, you want to blame me for Pilar leaving? Fine. I'd be happy to take the credit. Because if listening to me saved you from whatever scheme she's pulling -- good.",

        "Katie: You're throwing me out?",

        "Katie: All right, but when you change your mind --",
        "Mike: I won't.",
        "Pilar: Hello?",
        "Mike: Hey, it's me. I was starting to think you were never going to pick up.",
        "Pilar: Michael, please. You have to stop calling me.",

        "Jack: All of it. From the beginning.",
