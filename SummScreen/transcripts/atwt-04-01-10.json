        "Janet: I don't want you waiting on us.",
        "Carly: Janet, if I say it's all right, it's all right.",
        "Janet: All right. Well, then, at least -- nope. Let me do the dishes.",
        "Jack: No. You got to stay off your feet. Do you want to end up in the hospital again?",
        "Janet: It's just dishes!",
        "Carly: I'm just going to load the dishwasher. Takes a second.",
        "Janet: Okay. Here. I will go check on Dusty at the hospital.",
        "Jack: Well -- Teri said she'd call if there was any change.",
        "Janet: Well, come on! I got to do something for somebody!",
        "Carly: Why don't you go see if Liberty wants something to eat?",
        "Janet: That's a good idea. Maybe she's awake by now.",
        "Jack: You want to go outside and kick a squirrel or something?",
        "Carly: You know what? If I were a better person, I would probably be very glad to help Janet.",
        "Jack: Well, if you were very glad, then I'd be very worried. Look at everything you're doing for her, huh? You've -- you've given up your privacy, your bedroom, and now you're looking after Liberty, too?",
        "Carly: I like Liberty, and Parker's happy to have her here, too.",
        "Jack: Still, that's another body under your roof. All right, listen, you've done enough. You need a break. What do you say we get away, just the two of us, hmm? A date.",
        "Carly: Right now?",
        "Jack: Right now.",
        "Carly: Oh! Oh, I love that! That's great. I'm just going to go and powder my nose, and then we'll go.",
        "Jack: Deal.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Delivery Guy: Are you Jack Snyder?",
        "Jack: Guilty.",
        "Delivery Guy: Special delivery. Sign here.",
        "Jack: All righty. Thank you very much.",
        "Delivery Guy: You're welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: For the last time, Ellis, will you relax? It's not like we're doing anything illegal!",
        "Ellis: Tell that to the judge or, better yet, Carly, when she finds out who's footing the bill for this place.",
        "Craig: Who the hell are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: 25 wonderful years.",
        "Kim: Oh.",
        "Bob: And they said it wouldn't last.",
        "Kim: You know, I actually can't believe that it's been 25 years.",
        "Bob: Quarter century.",
        "Kim: Oh! Do you have to put it that way?",
        "Bob: Hey, we're still here. I got to be the luckiest guy in the world. I get up every morning and I see that beautiful face.",
        "Kim: What? This old thing?",
        "Bob: Oh, we're not old. We're classic. To us!",
        "Kim: I'll drink to that.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Reid: We need to talk.",
        "Bob: Dr. Oliver, I'm having lunch with my wife.",
        "Reid: Yeah, lunch can wait. This is really important.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Our receptionist got so many calls for your office number that she had to put it on the website. It's only a matter of time before your mom offers you your own spin-off show.",
        "Chris: No, no. No, no, no. I'm already in business with my dad. If I start working with my mom, I'm going to lose my mind. Speaking of which, uh -- is she around?",
        "Katie: No. She just left for lunch with your dad.",
        "Chris: That's great, because I -- I need your help. I'm in charge of decorations for the surprise party.",
        "Katie: And you're just getting started now? Chris!",
        "Chris: I was in denial about my responsibilities, you know, but I'm sitting around, I'm thinking, \"You know, my parents are two amazing people. They have this legendary romance. I can't just pop some balloons on a wall there and call it a day.\" So, I thought maybe, you know, I have a picture here. I can enlarge it. See? Maybe -- I know, its lame, isn't it? It's lame.",
        "Katie: No, no. It's not lame.",
        "Chris: Then what? You think I should use another picture?",
        "Katie: No. It's perfect, and you came to the right place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: When was the last time we went somewhere without an entourage? What's up?",
        "Jack: This is the divorce papers. Messenger was just here.",
        "Carly: Weren't you expecting them?",
        "Jack: Well, yeah, but they -- they came so soon. Once Janet and I sign these, I'll be a free man.",
        "Carly: Isn't that what you want?",
        "Jack: Of course this is what I want. No sense in hanging onto a marriage that's over.",
        "Carly: You look like you just lost your best friend.",
        "Jack: Its divorce we're talking about, Carly. You know what it's like under the best of circumstances. Yeah, it's the right thing to do, but, no, I'm not proud of it.",
        "Carly: It means that you and Janet can get on with your lives.",
        "Jack: Well, it doesn't mean that I want to celebrate it!",
        "Carly: Well, all right. Then I'll cancel the fireworks and the marching band.",
        "Janet: Uh, Liberty's still sleeping, so I figured I'd go relieve Theresa at the hospital. Am I interrupting something?",
        "Jack: The divorce papers came.",
        "Janet: Wow. Well, that was fast.",
        "Jack: That's what I thought, too. On the other hand, the timing couldn't be better. This way, when Dusty wakes up --",
        "Janet: Right. We -- we could get married. He'll be very happy. Do you have -- do you have a pen? We can take care of this right now.",
        "Janet: Sure. No time like the present. I think I have one in my purse here, and -- I thought I -- I think I saw one in the kitchen. I'll be right back, okay?",
        "[Carly clears throat]",
        "Carly: I'm going to take a rain check on that date.",
        "Jack: No, no. We can still do this.",
        "Carly: Yeah. You know what? It seemed like it was a good idea at the time, but I -- I have a lot of work to do at the office. So, I'll call you.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Janet: Where'd Carly go?",
        "Jack: I'll be right back. Carly, wait. Listen, I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: You know what, Jack? I really don't want to hear how sorry you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Call the police.",
        "Gabriel: Look, do burglars normally try to rewire the entire office?",
        "Craig: What are you talking about?",
        "Gabriel: I work here.",
        "Craig: That's a new one.",
        "Gabriel: Is he still calling the cops?",
        "Craig: Ellis?",
        "Ellis: I'm on hold.",
        "Craig: Hang up, but keep the phone handy in case I change my mind. So, who are you, and what are you doing here?",
        "Gabriel: Well, I was planning to set up your Wi-Fi, but if you'd like me to do something else --",
        "Craig: I didn't hire you.",
        "Gabriel: Well, your partner did, all right? She gave me a key.",
        "Ellis: All right, Craig, look, I've got some things to take care of if you don't need me.",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah. I'll catch up to you later. You should have let me know you were going to be here. I don't like snoops.",
        "Gabriel: I wasn't snooping. I was wiring.",
        "Craig: Do you have a name, snoop?",
        "Gabriel: Gabriel Carris.",
        "Craig: Craig Montgomery.",
        "Gabriel: So, you're the guy who found this place? You know, you should have had someone check it out beforehand, because the wiring is --",
        "Craig: Are you a licensed electrician?",
        "Gabriel: Well, you don't need a license to see that there's a fire hazard.",
        "Craig: Did you fix it?",
        "Gabriel: Well, I started to, but I need a little more time.",
        "Craig: I want that key back.",
        "Gabriel: Fine. I want to get paid for the work I already did.",
        "Craig: I didn't say I was firing you, but you're not allowed in unless one of us is here.",
        "Gabriel: What is with the paranoia?",
        "Craig: It's not paranoia if someone's act -- you know what? You ask too many questions.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: You two stay here. I'll go up and see Barbara for a minute.",
        "Bob: Don't be long. I may need rescuing.",
        "Kim: You're on your own, Toots.",
        "Reid: I'm being sued for malpractice.",
        "Bob: By whom?",
        "Reid: The father of one of my patients back in Texas. His little girl died, and he needs someone to blame.",
        "Bob: Was it your fault?",
        "Reid: No. But now -- the father's avoiding his grief and coming after my career.",
        "Bob: It sounds like a very well-rehearsed answer. Be honest with me. Did you make a mistake?",
        "Reid: No. I would tell you if I had. Look, you've been really good to me -- not counting the stunt you pulled in court to keep me here, but since then. I don't want the new hospital wing being held up because of my bad P.R. maybe I should take a leave of absence until this whole thing's resolved.",
        "Bob: Absolutely not. You're not going anywhere. The new wing is you.",
        "Reid: But if I get dragged through the mud because of this malpractice case, the hospital's going to get dragged along with it.",
        "Bob: We can handle it. When someone threatens one of my doctors, they have to go through me. That's the deal.",
        "Reid: Thank you. Why? What's in it for you?",
        "Bob: For a genius, you're clueless.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: We're only ever going to have one 25th anniversary, for crying out loud! I just wanted it not to feel like every other day.",
        "Barbara: Well, you know, having an anniversary, isn't it a celebration of your life together? What better way to do it than just be right smack dab in the middle of it?",
        "Kim: Shut up, Barbara! You're not even going to let me sulk?",
        "Barbara: No! I'm -- no, I'm not. Now listen. I have plans tonight, but I can cancel them. I can come out. I can celebrate with you.",
        "Kim: No, no, no. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. No, not at all. I mean, frankly, I should know better. I mean, after all these years. [Sighs] Medicine comes first, and if I haven't learned that in 25 years of being a doctor's wife, I don't suppose I'm ever going to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I don't want you to think I came over here so you'd do my work for me. But since you're on a roll, do you have any ideas for a gift?",
        "Katie: You haven't gotten them a present yet?!",
        "Chris: It's not like I haven't tried. You know, these people already have everything. You know, I'm thinking my parents have been married for 25 years. I want to get them something that says \"A love like theirs lasts forever.\" I know. I'm boring you, aren't I? It's --",
        "Katie: No. No, you're not boring me. You're just -- you made me think about something that Brad got for me when I was pregnant. He said that the big circle is me and the little circle is -- nothing lasts forever. Sorry. Especially love.",
        "Chris: Katie, Katie, Katie. Hey. You don't believe that any more than I do. Whoa, my cut's still there.",
        "Katie: Love is hard and it's painful, and not everybody gets a fair shot at it. And once you grow up and you realize how hard love can be and what it can cost you, it's just -- it's not worth it. It's heartbreaking.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Chris: Hey, you know what? Maybe you shouldn't make a speech at the party tonight.",
        "[Katie laughs]",
        "Katie: Probably not.",
        "Chris: Look, you don't need me to tell you this, okay. But you are young, you're beautiful, you're smart, you're funny. You're going to find love.",
        "Katie: Not like Brad. I'm never going to feel the same way I did about Brad about anyone else.",
        "Chris: No. No, it'll be different. But I'm telling you, there is someone out there who can make you very happy.",
        "Katie: It's just that every time I let myself start to believe in love again, I end up alone. How many times do you have to go through that before you say, \"Enough is enough\"?",
        "Chris: You know what I think the trick is? You just got to keep trying till you get it right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Kim: Ooh. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Before he changes his mind. Hello?",
        "Bob: The bottle's still cold, but the bubbles are fading.",
        "[Kim laughs]",
        "Kim: I'm on my way down. We're going to finish our toast.",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm. I never doubted it. Don't you be too hard on him, because he loves you.",
        "Kim: Thanks, Boo.",
        "Barbara: And so do I.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Kim: I love you, too, Sweetheart. Okay. Whoopee, whoopee, whoopee! Here I come! Wait for me, my darling!",
        "Barbara: Oh.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Barbara: Hello? Well, hello. Yes. Of course it's still on, and it would mean the world to them if you showed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We don't have to do this now.",
        "Janet: Hey, you remember those vows we took? Didn't really mean it.",
        "Jack: I did. Every word. You did, too.",
        "Janet: Yeah. I just always thought vows were meant to be permanent.",
        "Jack: Nobody likes divorce. Well, look at it this way -- [Clears throat] You're with somebody new. We weren't right for each other, and now you have a whole new future ahead of you, and you deserve the best, Janet.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Janet: Oh. That could be the hospital. Ah, hello?",
        "Reid: Mrs. Snyder, its Dr. Oliver. I was just in to check on Mr. Donovan. There's been no change in his condition.",
        "Janet: Oh, okay. Well, thanks for calling, Dr. Oliver. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I have one more question.",
        "Reid: Yes?",
        "Janet: What if he doesn't wake up?",
        "Reid: I don't deal in \"What ifs.\" Good-bye, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Jack: What did Dr. Oliver say?",
        "Janet: No change. So, you remember that future you were just telling me about? I might have to face the fact that Dusty might not be in it.",
        "Jack: Aw, Janet, you can't give up hope.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on, Jack. We both know the longer he stays unconscious, the less likely he is to wake up.",
        "Jack: Janet.",
        "Janet: I'm not going to lie to myself, and I don't want you to lie to me, either. Things are going to have to change, right? I can't stay here forever. So, if Dusty doesn't wake up, I'm going to have to figure out something else for us.",
        "Jack: Us?",
        "Janet: Me and Liberty and the baby.",
        "Jack: What about me? Don't count me out. Just 'cause we're not married anymore doesn't mean I'm going to stop looking out for you.",
        "Janet: And how will Carly feel about that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Don't tell me you're done already.",
        "Gabriel: Ask him.",
        "Craig: I thought I was the one who did the hiring around here.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig, what is the big deal? Gabriel needs work, and we have work that needs to be done.",
        "Craig: Yeah, you really should run these things by me first.",
        "Carly: Well, if it's about money, I would be happy to call Morris myself.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. That's -- that's not what I'm saying. There's plenty of money -- take your foot off the furniture. There's plenty of money to hire a handyman. The point is, you offered him a job without knowing that.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm very sorry.",
        "Gabriel: So, am I going or staying?",
        "Carly: Well, unless you know how to run a wireless network.",
        "Craig: Fine. Well, go fix something.",
        "Carly: Okay. So, good. I finished my evening-wear designs here.",
        "Craig: Oh, good, good.",
        "Carly: Take a peak.",
        "Craig: Oh, these are great.",
        "Carly: Yeah?",
        "Craig: Yeah. You know, I've got a conference call with Ellis to Milan later today. Maybe I can set up an advanced showing.",
        "Carly: Do you really think they're good enough?",
        "Craig: Good enough? They're inspired.",
        "Carly: Oh!",
        "[Laughing]",
        "Craig: Great job. I'll see you later.",
        "Carly: Okay. What?",
        "Gabriel: Nothing.",
        "Carly: Gabriel, come here. Come on. Tell me what you think of these designs, huh?",
        "Gabriel: Well, I'm no fashion critic.",
        "Carly: Just tell me what you think, and be honest. You're not going to lose your job.",
        "Gabriel: Uh -- they're okay.",
        "Carly: What does that mean?",
        "Gabriel: I mean, they just look like things I've already seen.",
        "Carly: You mean boring?",
        "Gabriel: A little.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly may not like the situation, but she understands.",
        "Janet: Well, I sure wish she'd explain it to me. Hold on. Hold on. Uh, yeah. There's nothing about child custody in here.",
        "Jack: Yeah, 'cause we agreed that we would take care of that after the baby was born.",
        "Janet: I've changed my mind.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Janet: Because we talked about this before Liberty started responding to treatment, and -- and -- and we decided to get pregnant to save her life, you know. I wasn't really thinking straight.",
        "Jack: Well, you're still not. Liberty may be doing better, but between her and Dusty, this is not the time to be making big decisions.",
        "Janet: I know, but this baby isn't going to wait for things to calm down before it's born! I want this taken care of before we go any further.",
        "Jack: Janet, the baby wasn't a mistake. We -- we both agreed that this was the right thing to do. We talked about this.",
        "Janet: For Liberty.",
        "Jack: Yes! I wouldn't have signed on if I wasn't 100% committed. Now that he or she is a reality, I got to tell you, I'm kind of looking forward to being a parent again.",
        "Janet: But what if Liberty doesn't need the donor?",
        "Jack: What does that have to do with anything? A commitment's a commitment! It's not going to change just 'cause we signed that paper!",
        "Janet: So, you and me -- it wasn't a complete waste after all?",
        "Jack: Not even close. Okay, so we didn't make it as Mr. and Mrs. Snyder. We can still be fantastic parents.",
        "Janet: Yes, we can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You're absolutely right. They're boring. They stink. But thank you for being honest with me. I don't know why Craig couldn't have been half as straight.",
        "Gabriel: Seriously?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Gabriel: I mean, the guy practically falls over every time he sees you. I mean, he'll do anything to keep you around.",
        "Carly: You just met him.",
        "Gabriel: It's guy 101.",
        "Carly: Which explains why it's idiotic. I don't need a yes-man. I need somebody who believes in my talent like Morris Calman does.",
        "Gabriel: Who's that?",
        "Carly: He's our investor from New York. He's backing the company all by himself.",
        "Gabriel: If you say so.",
        "Carly: What -- what is that supposed to mean?",
        "Gabriel: Nothing. Good for Morris Calman. I mean, has he seen your stuff?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Craig faxes him like 10 times a day. He loves what we're doing.",
        "Gabriel: And he's told you that personally?",
        "Carly: Craig handles the financial stuff, so he deals with Morris himself.",
        "Gabriel: Okay.",
        "Carly: Hello. This is Carly Tenney. I'm calling for Mr. Calman. Is he available? Tenney. From -- from Monte Carlo, the business that -- that he's backing. In Oakdale, that's right. Oh. Oh, I -- I see. No. That -- that's all right. Thank you, though. No message.",
        "Gabriel: You okay?",
        "Carly: I don't know. That -- that was Morris Calman's secretary, and she said that Morris turned down Craig's offer to back the company months ago. He -- he doesn't have a dime in Monte Carlo.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: [Laughs] Aww, Katie, that is great. I could not have done this without you. That's beautiful.",
        "Katie: You're right, and you're welcome.",
        "Chris: Now let's go to Tom and Margo's! You can help me decorate! What do you think?",
        "Katie: Oh, my God! You are unbelievable!",
        "[Cellphone ringing]",
        "Chris: Oh, man. What is -- oh, this cannot be good.",
        "Katie: Oh, no.",
        "Chris: What's up, brother Tom? You still didn't figure out a way to do it? You do? Yeah, no. That's -- that's fine. I'll take care of it. Yeah, thanks.",
        "Katie: What now?",
        "Chris: Tom. He had one job to do, get my parents to his house, but now he's got to go to court, and he still didn't figure out a way to do it.",
        "Katie: So, you said you would do it.",
        "Chris: I did. I did, and I am so terrible at these things.",
        "Katie: So now I'm going to have to do it.",
        "Chris: That would be really, really nice of you.",
        "Katie: Of course.",
        "Chris: Although, as much as I hate to admit it, that one person who was connecting with my dad these days is Reid. Maybe I should have him call and get him over there.",
        "Katie: How do you feel about that?",
        "Chris: I'm not jealous, if that's what you're asking me. No, I'm serious, okay. I'm done with the great ideas and big plans with my dad, okay? I love him to death. Love him to death, but we're just not seeing eye to eye these days.",
        "Katie: And that's what he's found in Reid, someone who does?",
        "Chris: Apparently they're building the greatest neurosurgical wing in 10 galaxies, so what do you think, you know? Although, you know what? Enough about them, all right? Let's you and I get out of here, figure out a way to get my parents to that party without blowing the surprise, yeah?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Let's try this again, shall we?",
        "Kim: Hey -- what happened to your new best friend?",
        "Bob: Oh, I know he's not one of your favorite physicians.",
        "Kim: Ho, ho.",
        "Bob: But you should be relieved that he's agreed to stay in Oakdale.",
        "Kim: Why? You work twice as hard now as you did before he got here, and so much for cutting down on your hours.",
        "Bob: That's all going to change when the new wing is finished.",
        "Kim: Now, you know, that's something I do believe, because you're going to have more staff, more patients, more responsibility.",
        "Bob: You know, I want to leave Memorial a better hospital than it was when I got there for the doctors that come after me, like Oliver and like Christopher.",
        "Kim: Christopher. You know, he's so happy in pediatrics. He really doesn't want to run the hospital. He's made that very clear. But I do have a feeling that he'd like to have his father around for a few more years.",
        "Bob: I'm not going anywhere. With the new wing and Oliver in charge, I think that'll be my greatest achievement. Second only to our marriage, of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Good news. I just spoke to the head of Milan fashion week, and we're in. Now, I know it's soon, but we can divide and conquer. You can stay here, make sure the dresses get made. I'll fly over, make the arrangements ahead of time. Then, when it's all done, we'll take a few days and have a look at Italia, all in the name of work, of course. Did I miss something?",
        "Carly: No, no. You seem to have pretty much everything covered. Except your tracks!",
        "Craig: What -- hey!",
        "Carly: You arrogant, slimy creep!",
        "Craig: What's the matter with you?!",
        "Carly: I'll tell you what's wrong! You lied to me! I always knew that you were a manipulative snake. But I stupidly thought that was just with other people! You were supposed to be different with me!",
        "Craig: I am different with you.",
        "Carly: Why? Because you're worried about my feelings? You were supposed to care about me, but this whole thing is just another Craig Montgomery con!",
        "Craig: I do care about you. I wasn't gone that long. What the hell happened in here?",
        "Carly: I called Morris Calman. That's what happened.",
        "Craig: Why -- why would you do that? What -- what did he -- what did he say?",
        "Carly: Nothing. He said nothing, 'cause his secretary wouldn't even put me through to him, because it turns out he's not in business with us at all!",
        "Craig: Oh. Carly, Morris believes in your talent. He told me so himself.",
        "Carly: Just not enough to put money behind it, right?",
        "Craig: He just thinks you've been out of the game for a little while, and he wanted you to take some time to get back into the groove and then he'll put his money in.",
        "Carly: Would you just be honest with me? He said no, didn't he?",
        "Craig: Okay. I haven't been completely honest about the money.",
        "Carly: [Sighs] Who is backing this company, Craig?",
        "Craig: Me. I'm the investor.",
        "Carly: You.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Even though you've told me, like, a thousand times that the first rule of business is to not use your own money.",
        "Craig: Some rules are meant to be broken. I believe in you, Carly. I never lied about that.",
        "Carly: Do you even know the difference?",
        "Craig: Are you serious? Have you looked at this place? I did this for you, and personally, I'm looking forward to proving Morris Calman wrong.",
        "Carly: What if it doesn't work?",
        "Craig: It will. I'm not going to let you bail on me, Carly. Now, I know you're scared, and maybe Morris didn't get what you were doing. But the fashion people who came to our party, they were real, and they love your work.",
        "Carly: Yeah, in theory. But I'm trying to make clothes for young people, you know -- women in their 20s who go to clubs and parties and spend a lot of money on their clothes, and to those people, my designs are boring and predictable. Aren't they, Gabriel?",
        "Gabriel: Well, that's -- that's not exactly what I said.",
        "Craig: You're asking the handyman? Does he look like he spends money on clothes?",
        "Carly: He's got eyes, Craig.",
        "Craig: I believe in you, Carly. I know it sounds crazy, but you have to trust me.",
        "Carly: You're right. It does sound crazy.",
        "Gabriel: She asked me to tell the truth.",
        "Craig: Well, I hope it was worth it. You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, my darling Uncle Bob, I want to congratulate you on 25 years of surviving with this woman who is a force of nature.",
        "Bob: Uh huh, I know. I hope to be around for the 50th, if she'll have me. Will you join us?",
        "Barbara: No, no. I'm not going to intrude. Have you given him his gift yet?",
        "Kim: Uh, no. Actually, I was waiting for the right time.",
        "Bob: It's always the right time for a gift.",
        "Barbara: For Pete's sakes, put the poor guy out of his misery.",
        "Bob: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Give him his gift!",
        "Kim: All right, all right.",
        "Bob: The cabin! [Laughs]",
        "Kim: Exactly, our sanctuary.",
        "Bob: Oh, that it is. We always go there when we just have to get away.",
        "Kim: Yeah, I'm actually surprised you even remember it.",
        "Bob: Oh, come on, now. Of course I remember it. That's a beautiful picture, Honey. Thank you. I'll put it on my desk, and I'll look at it whenever things go bad.",
        "Kim: Well, actually, we can do a little more than that. I've had it all renovated. It's going to be ready for us tomorrow, and we can start our second set of 25 years off right, just the two of us.",
        "Bob: Tomorrow?",
        "Kim: Oh, don't worry, don't worry. I've been checking. I watched it. Your schedule is fine. You're clear.",
        "Bob: Well, I was, but the meetings with the architect had to be changed, so we have to go over the plans, and then we have to pick a contractor by the 15th. Maybe in a few weeks, Honey.",
        "Kim: A few weeks, okay. Well, you have any idea how hard it was to kind of orchestrate all of this and get it ready for us for tomorrow, exactly for tomorrow, and to watch your schedule and keep it a secret? I feel like if we don't go tomorrow, we're never going to get there.",
        "Bob: You can't spring something like this on me without a warning.",
        "Kim: That's how surprises work!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Reid, looking good.",
        "Reid: The answer's no.",
        "Katie: Listen, today is Bob and Kim's silver wedding anniversary, and we need someone to help us get them to Tom and Margo's house for their surprise party.",
        "Reid: What does this have to do with me?",
        "Chris: Aren't you being sued for malpractice?",
        "Reid: Excuse me?",
        "Chris: News travels fast when you get served in these court orders.",
        "Katie: My God! Why didn't you say anything?",
        "Chris: Katie, we got to focus on the bigger problem here. Okay, look. My brother, Tom, is the hospital's lawyer, all right. I'm sure if you call my dad, tell him that you got to meet him at Tom's house to deal with it, he'll come rushing over.",
        "Katie: Kim's easy, but we need help with Bob, please?",
        "Reid: Fine. Do I get to come to the party?",
        "Chris: It's more a family thing.",
        "Katie: Sure, if you want to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, hi. I'm so glad you're still here. Hug me, hold me, before I lose my mind. Thanks.",
        "Janet: [Clears throat] Sorry.",
        "Carly: Janet. I -- I didn't realize you were still here.",
        "Janet: Well, Jack was just about to drive me over to the hospital so I can sit with Dusty.",
        "Carly: You're leaving?",
        "Jack: Well, she didn't feel up to driving herself, but if you'd --",
        "Carly: No. Go. It's okay.",
        "Jack: I'm going to drive her, and then I'll come right back. You sure you're okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I mean, when was the last time I had my living room all to myself?",
        "Janet: Um, Carly, I hate to ask, since you're already doing so much --",
        "Carly: Ask away.",
        "Janet: Could you check on Liberty when she wakes up?",
        "Carly: Of course. I would do that anyway.",
        "Janet: Thank you.",
        "Jack: I'll be right back. I promise.",
        "Carly: Anything else I can do for anybody? Can I knit a little sweater, maybe make a batch of homemade ice cream?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, hi, Gabriel. Is something up at work?",
        "Gabriel: Uh, sort of.",
        "Carly: Well, then, you're going to have to go to Craig with it and tell him about it.",
        "Gabriel: I'd rather not, since he actually just fired me.",
        "Carly: He what?!",
        "Gabriel: Look, I was just hoping I could get paid for the work that I did.",
        "Carly: I -- I can't believe that he fired you. You were just being honest with me. Did you tell him that I asked you?",
        "Gabriel: He wasn't really in the mood to listen. I don't think he likes me very much.",
        "Carly: Well, too bad. I need somebody around who's going to tell me like it is. So, you are officially rehired, and don't worry. I will call Craig myself and break the news to him.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, cool. Thanks.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Oh, and, Gabriel, keep your eyes open.",
        "Gabriel: Keep my eyes open? Are you asking me to spy on your partner?",
        "Carly: Would I do a thing like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Come on. We got to hurry up. Reid's going to be here any minute with your parents.",
        "Chris: Look at them.",
        "Katie: How can you not?",
        "Chris: Yeah, they're like apple pie and baseball and -- what's that third thing?",
        "Barbara: Diamonds?",
        "Chris: Right. How could I forget diamonds?",
        "Barbara: Oh, oh, am I glad I got here early. I should have known you'd gone tacky.",
        "Katie: Hey, I was just about to put that up!",
        "Barbara: You know, you know, there are going to be a lot of pictures taken here tonight, and in six months, when you look at them, you're going to regret every one of these crepe paper bells. I mean, if it's a choice between bare and tacky --",
        "Katie: Well, you would know tacky.",
        "Chris: Okay, wait a minute. The wedding bells, that's my fault, all right? I was the most desperate person at the party store when they took advantage of me. My bad, all right? So don't beat up on Katie about it, all right? Today's all about positive vibes for my mom and dad, so --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: I've spent my whole career at Memorial hospital, and I'd like to leave something behind that all of those years are not forgotten.",
        "Kim: That's funny, because I feel the same way about our marriage.",
        "Bob: So do I, and when I retire, we'll be able to travel and do all the things we haven't had time to do before. But right now I'm in charge of building a wing on the hospital. I can't turn my back on that. It's my job.",
        "Kim: You and your job.",
        "Bob: Honey, be reasonable.",
        "Kim: I don't want to be reasonable! I want romance. I want to feel like I come first just for a change.",
        "Bob: Of course you do.",
        "Kim: Well, then prove it! Its a few days. I mean, the hospital is not going to grind to a halt without you. [Sighs] Happy 25th anniversary.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Yeah, thanks to that kid, Carly knows the money's not coming from Morris. But it's all right. I told her it's coming from me, and she bought it. She'll never connect the dots to Parker.",
        "Ellis: I hope you're right.",
        "Craig: Carly's under control, and I fired the kid. Now, if we're just careful enough not to leave anything around here, we should be fine. Actually, we're better off than we were before. Now we don't have to pretend to call Morris every time we want cab fare. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Just a minute. Finish this sketch. There. How's Janet?",
        "Jack: We signed the divorce papers. I dropped them off at Tom's office on the way back from the hospital.",
        "Carly: How do you feel?",
        "Jack: Like we just took a giant step forward.",
        "Carly: Maybe we should have that date after all.",
        "Jack: Mm. Is Liberty still sleeping? And Janet's going to be at the hospital for hours, which means we have this nice, long, comfy couch all to ourselves.",
        "Carly: I don't know what you're suggesting. Are you suggesting that we make out?",
        "Jack: Oh. Well, that depends. You going to let me get to second base?",
        "Carly: [Laughs] On our first date with you as a free man, what do you think?",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Casey: Nobody wants her at the party! Not my parents, not your parents, and especially not me.",
        "Chris: Is that really true?",
        "Casey: What do you think?",
        "Katie: I think this party would be a good chance to make peace. Everyone's going to be sentimental and happy. Come on. You can come as my guest.",
        "Barbara: I'm glad to see you. Where's Vienna?",
        "Henry: Not here.",
        "All: Surprise!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Chris: Where's Mom?",
        "Bob: That's a good question."
