Damian gets stabbed outside Java while following Luke in order to protect him. Noah saves Damian's life by calling 911 and getting him to the hospital quickly. Holden is convinced that Damian either stabbed himself or hired someone to stab him to get sympathy from Luke in order to get close to him. Noah tries to persuade Luke to give Damian another chance because he thinks Damian really loves Luke like a father. Luke tells Noah he won't allow Damian to hurt and manipulate him again and the only father he has ever had is Holden Snyder. Luke and Noah meet Zac and Zoe Finn a pair of very strange fraternal twins who finish each others sentences and are very affectionate with each other.

        "Casey: Is this really stupid?",
        "Alison: You're asking me? This was your idea.",
        "Casey: I know, but -- I just feel kind of weird.",
        "Alison: You're just jealous 'cause mine's bigger than yours.",
        "Casey: What? No, it is not!",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Alison: Made you look! Okay, now, can we please get these beats down for class? I don't want to get kicked out on the second day.",
        "Casey: Ooh! The shame!",
        "Alison: I know. Okay.",
        "[Clears throat]",
        "[Taps rhythm on drum]",
        "Alison: How was that?",
        "Casey: Excellent.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Casey: No, not at all. It's supposed to be like a tribal dance, not -- not a funeral march. You know, just, uh --",
        "[Taps rhythm on drum]",
        "Alison: I'm not getting it.",
        "Casey: Well, you can't -- okay, you can't just smack the thing. There's -- there's different ways of stroking it, you know?",
        "Alison: Don't be dirty!",
        "Casey: I'm not being dirty. Let me just show you, okay? So hands together. Hit it on the side. Like that.",
        "[Taps drum]",
        "Casey: Or you can have open hand in the center.",
        "[Taps drum]",
        "Alison: I see.",
        "Casey: Yes. And see? You want to hit it with the palm of the hand, okay?",
        "Alison: Somebody was paying attention.",
        "[Chuckles]",
        "Casey: Yes, yes. You can change it up, you know?",
        "Alison: Well, how do you know when to do that?",
        "Casey: Uh, do what?",
        "Alison: Change it up?",
        "Casey: Oh, um -- you know, it's like instinct. You just gotta find the rhythm.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Feel it now?",
        "[Chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey.",
        "Noah: Hey. What are you doing here?",
        "Luke: Look, I know you're working, but I really want to show you something.",
        "Noah: Oh! Couldn't you have just e-mailed me?",
        "Luke: Yeah, if you ever check your e-mail.",
        "Noah: I check my e-mail.",
        "Luke: No, you don't.",
        "[Chuckles]",
        "Luke: Anyway, you know I put that ad on Greg's list, looking for volunteers for the foundation?",
        "Noah: Oh, yeah. Did you get any responses?",
        "Noah: Yeah, tons. People who saw me on TV. People who have been discriminated against themselves. They all want to help.",
        "Noah: That's great.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I know. Tell me about it. And I think the more people, the better. I want to launch a broad campaign against discrimination, prove to those bigots that we're not scared of them anymore.",
        "Noah: \"Anymore\"? Talking about Damian, aren't you?",
        "Noah: Among others, yeah.",
        "Noah: Look, since you brought it up --",
        "Luke: I didn't. You did.",
        "Noah: Well, it's just -- something happened.",
        "Luke: With Damian?",
        "Noah: Yeah.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Noah: The other day, after you left, he came by.",
        "Luke: And?",
        "Noah: And he asked me to talk to you about giving him one more chance. [Scoffs]",
        "Luke: He doesn't stop, does he? Well, what did he say?",
        "Noah: What do you think I said? I told him no way. [Laughs]",
        "Luke: Of course you did. You're a good boyfriend. [Laughs]",
        "Noah: But I know you don't want to hear this, but I think you're making a mistake about not giving him one more chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I want to know why Damian hasn't been arrested yet.",
        "Margo: Because we require evidence that someone's actually committed a crime before we arrest them.",
        "Holden: Come on. We both know he's the one who ransacked our house.",
        "Margo: Well, no knowing ain't proving. It's not the same thing.",
        "Holden: Margo, the maid saw Damian cutting through the yard. There were footprints -- muddy footprints -- inside and outside the house. Luke and Noah -- they saw Damian with muddy shoes later on. What do you need?",
        "Margo: All right, well, here's the deal. We weren't able to lift a complete print from the mud inside the house to get a match. And Lily is on record stating that she let Damian into the house earlier in the day. [Sighs]",
        "Holden: What am I supposed to do? Can you tell me that? I don't want that guy anywhere near my family.",
        "Margo: I know, Holden, but Damian swears he's here to make amends with Luke.",
        "Holden: I don't buy it. The way he treated Luke, prejudice like that -- it doesn't just go away.",
        "Margo: So you don't think he can change?",
        "Holden: No, I don't. I have this very strange feeling that Luke is in danger.",
        "Margo: All right, well, what I can do is I can put Luke under police protection. But I don't think he's gonna cotton to having 24-hour surveillance.",
        "Holden: I don't care. Do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Some of the things Damian's done in the past have been really awful. I understand that.",
        "Luke: No, no, you don't. If you did, you couldn't sit there and ask me to give him another chance.",
        "Noah: I really think he's being sincere this time.",
        "Luke: Noah, it's just an act. Trust me, the last thing Damian Grimaldi is sincere.",
        "Noah: He told me all he wants is the chance to make things up to you.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, last time he was here, all he wanted was the chance to make me straight. You know, he can't make up for that.",
        "Noah: Yeah, well, if you won't let him.",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, I know that you'd love for me to say, \"Damian, I forgive you,\" but trust me, it's not that easy!",
        "Noah: If my dad was still alive and he wanted a real relationship with me --",
        "Luke: Oh, no, I have a real relationship with my dad! And so do you. He's the guy you call Holden Snyder. But as far as Damian goes, I have given him enough chances. I am done, okay?",
        "Noah: Okay.",
        "Luke: Okay. Look, so now I just -- I just want to find some volunteers -- [Chuckles]",
        "Zac: You can put that away now.",
        "Zoe: You won't be needing it anymore.",
        "Luke: What are you doing?",
        "Noah: Excuse me?",
        "Zac: Your search is over, boys.",
        "Zoe: Because we're exactly what you've been looking for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You shouldn't have come here, Damian.",
        "Damian: I need to talk to you.",
        "Lily: I don't have anything to say to you.",
        "Damian: Well, then, perhaps you can just listen to what I have to say. May I come in?",
        "Lily: At least this time you asked.",
        "Damian: Thank you. Lily, listen, I -- I understand your reservations, but I wish you could see that I don't mean you or our son any harm. On the contrary.",
        "Lily: Well, unfortunately, you haven't given us much reason to trust you, Damian.",
        "Damian: Come on. That's all in the past, Lily. How many times do I have to apologize?!",
        "Lily: Your apologies aren't gonna change what happened for any of us.",
        "Damian: Look at me, Lily. Do you honestly believe I was driving the car that hit our son, or that I could break into your home and tear it apart as a way to scare you?",
        "Lily: I don't know what to think.",
        "Damian: I was exonerated by the police! That should tell you something!",
        "Holden: You were released because of lack of evidence. That's not the same as being exonerated.",
        "Damian: There's no evidence because I'm innocent, Holden. I am not a danger to Luke! You are!",
        "Lily: Excuse me?",
        "Damian: You want so badly to believe I'm the bad guy here that you are blind to the truth!",
        "Holden: And what's that?",
        "Damian: That the real danger to our son is still out there.",
        "Lily: Damian, stop. You don't need to scare us any more than we already are.",
        "Damian: I think you should be scared.",
        "Holden: All right. I've had it with this.",
        "Lily: What are you doing?",
        "Holden: I'm gonna call the cops.",
        "Damian: Holden, all these things that are happening to Luke are connected. They're not a coincidence.",
        "Holden: It's no coincidence that you suddenly show up here, and my son is almost killed by a hit-and-run driver.",
        "Damian: You seem to forget that I'm the one who took him to the hospital.",
        "Holden: I'm not entirely convinced that you weren't the one behind the wheel, either.",
        "Damian: You know what? You're a child. You believe me, don't you?",
        "Holden: Look, stop looking to my wife to back you up.",
        "Lily: I just want this fighting to stop and for my family to be safe.",
        "Damian: Then listen to what I'm telling you. You can waste your time pointing the finger on me, blaming me for everything, or you can do something to find the person truly responsible.",
        "Holden: I want you out of my house, Damian, and I'm done asking nicely.",
        "Damian: Fine. But this one's on you.",
        "Lily: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Damian: It means until your husband can get past his anger towards me, Luke will never be safe.",
        "Holden: Your scare tactics are not gonna work on us, okay?",
        "Damian: And pointing the finger at me isn't gonna solve anything. I just hope you realize that before it's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: The minute we saw your foundation was looking for volunteers --",
        "Zac: We just knew that it was something that we were meant to be a part of.",
        "Luke: Really?",
        "[Zac laughs]",
        "Zac: Would we lie to you?",
        "Luke: I don't know. I only laid eyes on you a few minutes ago.",
        "Zoe: Hope those eyes like what they see. What do you think? Does he like what he sees?",
        "Zac: Mm, just tell them that when we commit to something --",
        "Zoe: We give it everything we've got.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Luke: Okay. That's -- that's -- that's good.",
        "Zoe: So, just tell us what you need us to do, and we're on it.",
        "Luke: Uh, how about we start with names?",
        "Zoe: Of course! We're Zoe and Zac Finn.",
        "Noah: And where are you guys from?",
        "Zac: Where aren't we from? Right, Z?",
        "Zoe: It's insane. Feels like we've been everywhere.",
        "Noah: And now you guys want to join up with the foundation?",
        "Zoe: You want to bring attention to what you're doing.",
        "Zac: And we're very good at attracting attention.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I can see that.",
        "Zoe: It's a social skill that's often undervalued.",
        "Zac: You probably get your fair share of attention all on your own.",
        "Zoe: Z!",
        "Zac: I'm simply pointing out the obvious.",
        "Luke: Well, something that's not so obvious, Z, is that he's taken. [Laughs]",
        "Zac: In some ways, we're all taken. And yet, there's a part of everyone that will always be free.",
        "Noah: Yeah, that's -- deep.",
        "Zoe: We want to be a part of this. We have all kinds of ideas and resources. All you have to do --",
        "Zac: Is say yes.",
        "Luke: Well, far be it for me to turn away volunteers.",
        "Zac: No. You have to say it.",
        "Luke: Yes.",
        "[Zac laughs]",
        "Zoe: Excellent!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, I don't want Damian coming around here anymore, and I don't want him in this house, okay?",
        "Lily: Look, what he said upset me, too.",
        "Holden: He accused us of putting Luke in danger.",
        "Lily: I know, but maybe he was lashing out because we accused him of having something to do with Luke's accident.",
        "Holden: Don't tell me you're feeling sorry for him.",
        "Lily: I'm not.",
        "Holden: Good, because I don't trust him, and I never have.",
        "Lily: But I have. And you're worried that I will again.",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Lily: I made a terrible mistake, and what I did, it almost cost us our son.",
        "Holden: I never blamed you for that.",
        "Lily: Thank you for saying that.",
        "Holden: Look, you, the kids -- you guys are my whole life.",
        "Lily: And you're mine.",
        "Holden: And I'm gonna do everything I can to protect us.",

        "[Tapping on drums]",
        "Alison: Okay, I think I have it down now.",
        "Casey: I still think you need help.",
        "Alison: Go beat your own drum!",
        "Casey: Whoa! Look who's talking dirty now?",
        "Alison: Your drum is over there.",
        "Casey: So?",
        "Alison: So you're messing me up!",
        "Casey: No, I'm not! I'm helping you out!",
        "Alison: Yes, you are! See? I'm all over the place!",
        "Casey: Whoa, what is wrong with you, woman?",
        "Alison: I'm trying to play my drum!",
        "Casey: Yeah, you're gonna bust a rib. [Laughs]",
        "Alison: You're vibrating.",
        "Casey: I know.",
        "Alison: I'm talking about your phone.",
        "Casey: I'm not.",
        "[Alison chuckles]",
        "Alison: You have serious problems. Answer it.",
        "Casey: Come on! You're no fun! Hello. Yes, this is Casey Hughes, drum master. Oh, hey, hello. Yeah, no. It's, uh -- it's an, uh, extension course, so I just thought it -- yeah, okay. No, no. It's no problem.",
        "Alison: Who was it? Casey?",
        "Casey: It was dean burns.",
        "Alison: From O.U.? What did he want?",
        "Casey: Apparently, he wanted to call me and tell me that I was expelled from school, that I'm ineligible to enroll in any of the extension courses.",
        "Alison: What? Oh, Casey, I'm so sorry.",
        "Casey: Why? Why are you sorry? This is what happens. Every time, it's the same thing. Something good happens, and I screw it up! I don't -- I don't even know why I try!",
        "Alison: Casey, I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: Don't. Please.",
        "Alison: Don't what?",
        "Casey: Don't -- don't be all sweet and kind because you feel sorry for me.",
        "Alison: I know, but this isn't your fault.",
        "Casey: I -- I'm pretty sure it is. Who else is there to blame, huh?",
        "Alison: Me, maybe.",
        "Casey: You didn't get me expelled.",
        "Alison: But it was my idea for us to take this extension course. I should have looked into it more.",
        "Casey: Yeah, to see if there's a \"no loser\" policy. Yeah.",
        "Alison: Okay, forget about O.U., all right? We'll just -- we'll go take a class someplace else.",
        "Casey: Why? What is the point?",
        "Alison: You can't just give up!",
        "Casey: You don't get it, do you? No one's gonna take me, Ali. Once they see I was expelled, no school is gonna want me.",
        "Alison: You don't know that.",
        "Casey: Oh, but they -- they want an ex-con? A gambling addict? Unemployed janitor?",
        "Alison: Oh, poor you.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Alison: You heard me!",
        "Casey: You are not funny.",
        "Alison: I'm not being funny, Casey. I've been there. I know what it's like. And I was way worse off than you were, but I was able to come back and turn my life around.",
        "Casey: Good for you. Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: Wow. That's an attractive attitude.",
        "Casey: Well -- I think you should go, Ali.",
        "Alison: For how long?",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Alison: Do you want me to just go for now, or do you want me to leave and like never come back?",
        "Casey: What do you think, huh? You're obviously better off without me.",
        "Alison: Maybe I don't want better.",
        "Casey: So you're just gonna settle?",
        "Alison: You know what I'm gonna do? This.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: The first idea we had was to get people talking --",
        "Zac: About themselves and about their experiences --",
        "Zoe: Their feelings. So we thought we should start a blog.",
        "Luke: A blog?",
        "Zoe: Yes, for both gay and straight people to come together in an open forum.",
        "Zac: They probably have more in common than -- than they realize.",
        "Luke: That's -- that's probably true.",
        "Zoe: And we were thinking of something else, too.",
        "Noah: What's that?",
        "Zac: A dance.",
        "Zoe: Who doesn't like to let the music take control, right?",
        "Noah: And what would the point of this dance be?",
        "Zac: To let people move their bodies and open their minds, experience something new.",
        "Luke: Well, how would a dance be something new?",
        "Zac: Because everyone would have to dance with someone of the same sex and someone of the opposite sex.",
        "Zoe: Regardless of whether or not they were gay or straight.",
        "Zac: Or bi.",
        "Luke: Well, that -- sounds interesting.",
        "Zoe: We thought so.",
        "Luke: Wow. You guys are really in tune with each other.",
        "Zoe: Yeah. Can kind of freak people out at first.",
        "Luke: How long have you guys been together?",
        "Zac: Our whole lives.",
        "Zoe: We're --",
        "Zac: Twins.",
        "Zoe: We've just always been super affectionate.",
        "Zac: Me and Z against the world.",
        "Zoe: Mm.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, I know the feeling.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Noah: Who's that?",
        "Luke: It's my dad.",
        "Noah: Which one?",
        "Luke: The only one I have.",
        "Zac: What does that mean?",
        "Luke: It's complicated. Pardon me a minute. Hey, Dad. What's up?",
        "Holden: Where are you?",
        "Luke: I'm at Java with Noah.",
        "Holden: You think you can swing by the house?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: What's up?",
        "Holden: I spoke to Margo earlier, and we both agreed that she should assign someone to keep tabs on you.",
        "Luke: What are you saying, I'm gonna have a cop following me now? Don't I get a say?",
        "Holden: It's for your own protection.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't want it.",
        "Holden: All right, fine. Why don't you just come on home, and we can discuss it. You can meet Officer Cohen.",
        "Luke: I'm on my way. I've got to go.",
        "Noah: Is everything okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, if you consider me being put under police protection okay.",
        "Noah: What?",
        "Zac: That sounds exciting.",
        "Luke: Trust me, it's not. I got to run.",
        "Zac: Mm, we should go, too.",
        "Zoe: Yeah, we've got work to do.",
        "Zac: We've got to make ourselves indispensable to our new bosses. Later.",
        "Noah: And then that happened.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Noah: Okay, well, I got to lock up, but then I'll come right by the house soon as I can.",
        "Luke: Okay. See you soon.",
        "Noah: Love you.",
        "Luke: Love you, too.",

        "Casey: Okay, wait. Slow down.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Casey: I -- I don't know.",
        "Alison: You're not making any sense.",
        "Casey: I know, I know.",
        "Alison: What's wrong?",
        "Casey: Why are we doing this?",
        "Alison: That's a rhetorical question, I hope.",
