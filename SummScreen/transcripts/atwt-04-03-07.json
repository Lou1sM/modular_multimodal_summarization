        "Susan turns to Dusty because she is worried that Emily is missing and in trouble. Emily approaches a producer in Las Vegas, who shot the movie she saw Allison in. Margo learns Casey was seen at a tollbooth in Northern Michigan. Tom thinks she should finally put out an APB, just as Casey walks into the station. Maddie worries about Casey handling this alone and races off to the police station. Casey tries to cover why he left town by coming up with a logical explanation for his furious parents. Dusty finally agrees to help find out where Emily is. Tom and Margo tell Casey he is in a lot of trouble, but they are also concerned that Maddie is in trouble and that is really why he left. Lance claims the girl in the pictures name is Jodi Miller from South Carolina, but Emily doesn't believe him. Cheri tells Dusty that Emily quit and was eagerly looking for someone. When Casey's explanation doesn't mesh with his parents, Maddie bursts in to his defense. Will and Gwen struggle with the after effect of Adam, but deal with more trouble when they come face to face with a furious Barbara, who has found out Iris has all of Will's trust fund. They try to blow her off, but she won't be deterred. Will admits the truth finally, as Barbara shows her unconditional support. Maddie claims it is her fault that Casey left town since he came after her knowing her excuse was fake. She also was the reason he stayed away overnight. Tom and Margo worry that Casey's bail will be revoked that night. Lance subtly threatens Emily to mind her own business; Emily relents and asks him to tell her sister that she loves her and just wants to know that she is ok. Allison comes out after Emily leaves and thanks him for covering for her; she just can't face her now. Dusty doesn't know what to tell Susan; she becomes angry when she doesn't think he is doing enough. Dusty leaves a message for Emily to call him immediately because he is worried. Barbara angrily confronts Jade and threatens her. Maddie and Casey say goodbye before Casey heads off to see the judge, who will be determining his fate."

        "Dusty: Reschedule? I'm a block from your office. One question -- is your firm working with Montgomery now? Because it's only -- it's only a matter of time before Ms. Walsh is back on top, I'm telling you. Yeah, I'll let her know who stood with us and who didn't. Fine. One hour? Tell him to be ready.",
        "Susan: Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Susan: You haven't returned my calls!",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry, Susan. I've been busy.",
        "Susan: Yeah, I heard. I've been hearing rumors about a big shakeup at Worldwide. What's going on?",
        "Dusty: Why don't you ask your daughter what's going on?",
        "Susan: She's missing.",
        "Dusty: Emily? Since when?",
        "Susan: Well, she left me a message a couple of days ago, that she was going out of town on that hooker story you have her working on. And then, I haven't heard from her since.",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm sure she's just busy.",
        "Susan: Too busy to check in, leave a message, or send me an e-mail, to me or her son? She usually calls me to let me know that she's arrived --",
        "Dusty: She didn't tell you where she was headed?",
        "Susan: No. That's why I've been calling you. Isn't there a record of travel expenses or something --?",
        "Dusty: No, I don't have access to that stuff anymore. You've got to talk to one of her assistants, okay? Call them --",
        "Susan: I have. I have. I did! They haven't heard from her either. And -- Emily is so out of touch. That only means one thing -- she's in trouble.",

        "Receptionist: Can I help you?",
        "Emily: Lance Barton, please.",
        "Receptionist: You don't have an appointment.",
        "Emily: Well, my business with Lance is personal. Maybe that's why you don't know about it. Just let him know I'm here. My name's Emily. He'll see me.",
        "Receptionist: Security?",
        "Emily: Just call him!",
        "Receptionist: Someone here needs an escort out of the building.",
        "Emily: Oh, Lance! Good to see you again.",
        "Receptionist: You know her?",
        "Emily: Of course he knows me. Emily. Remember, we met at the club? I said that I'd give you a call.",
        "Lance: Oh, yeah. And you decided to drop by instead?",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, I sort of wanted a second look. And I thought you'd might like one, too.",
        "Lance: Yeah, all right. Go on in. I'll be right with you.",
        "Lance: Okay, so you talked your way in here. Show me what you've got.",
        "Emily: That poster --",
        "Lance: Yeah, it's one of my movies. Big hit.",
        "Emily: I just -- wanted to talk to you.",
        "Lance: Yeah, we'll do that, after you strip. And remember, porn's in the angles. So, make sure you sell it to me from, you know, both sides. And you can feel free to use the furniture.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I just have a few questions.",
        "Lance: Yeah, I don't have time for questions, all right? So, if you want to keep your clothes on, you can yak it up with the security guys on the way out, all right? In here, you take it off.",
        "Emily: And then you'll answer my questions?",
        "Lance: If you make me hot enough, Baby, I'll tell you anything you want to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey, have you heard anything from Casey?",
        "Margo: Nothing on Casey yet, but I just got this. I sent out the make, model, and the license plate of his car on the QT to a couple of pals in various jurisdictions.",
        "Tom: Well, at least the camera caught him paying a toll instead of running a stop light.",
        "Margo: It's time-dated two days ago.",
        "Tom: Where is this toll booth?",
        "Margo: Northern Michigan. Canadian border.",
        "Tom: So he jumped bail. He was not planning on coming home.",
        "Margo: Yeah, it looks that way.",
        "Tom: I didn't think he'd do this. I mean, why -- why? Why -- why did he do this?",
        "Margo: Because he didn't want to spend the next ten years in prison?",
        "Tom: No, we were doing great on that. We would have had him a suspended sentence, maybe parole. It was his first offense. He was going really well.",
        "Margo: All right, we don't know that he actually did cross the border.",
        "Tom: I would have never asked you to hold off on reporting this, if I'd thought --",
        "Margo: I know. I thought he'd come home, too. We're never going to see him again.",
        "Tom: Oh, we'll see him. When they arrest him.",
        "Margo: Oh, Tom.",
        "Tom: It's been two nights already. Your son's officially a fugitive. So, turn him in. Alert the authorities in Michigan, send out an APB.",
        "Margo: No, I'm going to hold off on that.",
        "Tom: If you can't do it, give the job to Dallas or Jack. But I'm not going to stand around while my wife loses her job because my son is not man enough to stand up and do the right thing.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God. Casey!",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Are you all right? We were worried about you.",
        "Casey: I'm fine. I'm here to turn myself in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I should have gone with him.",
        "Gwen: No. He didn't want us there, Maddie. And it would probably make things worse for Casey if we had gone.",
        "Will: And if we're not going to say that we ran because we thought you killed Adam --",
        "Maddie: Maybe we should.",
        "Gwen: No, we've already gone over that.",
        "Maddie: I know. And I just keeping thinking that we didn't kill Adam. He's alive. And soon enough, Margo will know that.",
        "Gwen: If he calls her.",
        "Maddie: He promised that he would call her and let her know that he's okay --",
        "Will: Yeah, Adam's alive. And the last time we saw him, he tried to rape Gwen. Are you going to tell his parents that part? Because if you leave it out, then what's the point? Why go through it at all?",
        "Maddie: The only thing Casey did wrong was to come find me, because he loves me. And now, he's going to be locked up in jail until his trial, and I -- God, I wish I had my cell phone.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Maddie: So I can call the police station and find out what's going on.",
        "Will: That's not a good idea.",
        "Maddie: What if they put Casey in prison and I don't even get to say good-bye to him?",
        "Gwen: You know what? There's a pay phone by the ladies room. Here.",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "Will: They're not going to let her talk to him.",
        "Gwen: She's got to try. I mean, I would do the same thing if it were you.",
        "Will: You're really wiped out. We should go home.",
        "Gwen: No, no, I just need another coffee, and Maddie needs the support.",
        "Will: Gwen.",
        "Gwen: I'm fine. Honestly, I'm not tired. I'm relieved. For the first time in months, I don't have to worry about somebody showing up and saying, \"I know what you've done. I know you're an accessory to murder.\"",

        "Luke: So, what did they do to you this time?",
        "Jade: You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Anyway, is everybody okay? Is Ethan all right?",
        "Luke: I left you a message.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but you didn't give me any details. Is Ethan okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah, he's fine. But my mom is -- look, let's just go in. Or -- I mean, unless you want to eat somewhere else?",
        "Will: Jade can't hurt us. She can't do anything. The second she says anything about what you and Maddie did, then the cops are going to be all over her for obstructing justice and hiding Adam.",
        "Gwen: I guess.",
        "Will: Just ignore her. She can't hurt us.",
        "Gwen: I hate the way she looks at me.",
        "Will: So, ignore her.",
        "Gwen: It used to be so easy to feel better than her. She lied about being pregnant with your child. I knew that I could never do anything that sleazy and that cold --",
        "Will: Gwen -- Gwen --",
        "Gwen: Now, when I look at her, I just feel ashamed.",
        "Will: You shouldn't.",
        "Gwen: Maddie and I almost killed Adam. Even on Jade's worst day, she can't top that.",
        "Maddie: They wouldn't tell me anything about Casey over the phone.",
        "Will: Well, they probably didn't process him yet.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, I'm going over there. I have to be with him. Maybe I can help.",
        "Gwen: How?",
        "Maddie: I don't know, by finding a way to tell his parents the truth. Casey didn't do anything wrong. I did. Don't worry, I'm going to keep you out of it, okay? I promise.",
        "Gwen: Should we go after her?",
        "Will: No, we should stop avoiding what we were trying to do by sitting here, having coffee, eating breakfast and talking about Jade.",
        "Gwen: What?",
        "Will: We should go home. We should get some sleep.",
        "Gwen: I can't. I keep feeling Adam on top of me.",
        "Will: Gwen, he's not going to hurt you. He can't. And you're going to be able to sleep, because I'm going to be right there. Okay?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I was kind of surprised I made it this far. I figured there'd be an APB out for my arrest. So, every time I saw a black-and-white, I was sweating bullets --",
        "Margo: I didn't officially report you missing yet.",
        "Tom: But you're going to.",
        "Margo: Well, Casey's home now.",
        "Tom: You made calls to law enforcement all over the country, telling them to keep an eye out for Casey. We have a faxed photo confirming that he was in Michigan.",
        "Casey: Wait, you do?",
        "Tom: You need to follow through on this, Margo. Otherwise, you'll be brought up on charges and possibly thrown off this force.",
        "Casey: Mom, you can't let that happen.",
        "Margo: You know what? We'll deal with it --",
        "Casey: No, Mom, look, I'll deal with this, okay? I jumped bail. And I knew it could happen, and I did it anyway. I need to deal with this. You don't need to get slammed for something I did.",
        "Margo: I'll have Gonzalez start the paperwork.",
        "Tom: You told Mom that you were going to be spending time in the dorms.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Tom: So, that was a lie? Or did something happen at school, something that made you want to run?",
        "Casey: I lied to Mom. I didn't intend on going to the dorms. I knew I was leaving.",
        "Tom: And you headed to Canada? And what did you think you were going to accomplish by that, Casey? I mean, if you were successful in crossing the border, how did you think you were going to support yourself once you got there?",
        "Casey: I didn't think that far ahead.",
        "Tom: Okay, what were you thinking?",
        "Casey: I just -- I needed to get away.",
        "Margo: What, to get away, or to get to Maddie?",
        "Tom: What's your mom talking about? Is Maddie involved in this somehow?",
        "Casey: Look, I'm back. Can we just do whatever comes next?",
        "Tom: Yeah, what comes next, you tell us why you lied, where you went, and if Maddie is involved in this!",
        "Margo: Baby, calm down.",
        "Tom: And how am I supposed to do that when my 18-year-old son is now piling years on top of a probable 10-year sentence?",
        "Casey: I know.",
        "Tom: Do you know what we went through? How hard we worked to try to keep you out of prison, the strategizing, the therapy you had to go through to get rid of this gambling problem?",
        "Margo: Is that it? Was it a gambling problem? Is that why you left?",
        "Casey: No, I didn't gamble. I swear.",
        "Tom: Then what was this about, Casey? Why would you pull a stunt like this for a girl? It's insane!",
        "Casey: I'm not going to talk to you until you calm down.",
        "Margo: Whoa --",
        "Tom: I beg your pardon?",
        "Casey: Dad, I don't want you to have another heart attack, all right? I love you, but you need to calm down.",
        "Tom: Tell us why you left.",
        "Casey: Maddie broke up with me. But the way she did it, and the things she said, it didn't feel right. And I thought something was wrong with her, so -- I tracked her down. I needed to find out.",
        "Margo: Instead of coming to your father or to me?",
        "Casey: I trust you guys, but I didn't know if Maddie did. And I needed to find out myself. I needed to see if she was in trouble.",
        "Tom: And did you?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I did. And she's fine now.",
        "Margo: But she was in trouble?",
        "Tom: Hey, is Maddie in trouble?",
        "Casey: No --",
        "Margo: Casey, is Maddie pregnant?",
        "Casey: No, Mom, what -- why would you think that?",
        "Margo: Why? Because you jumped bail, you cross the state line, you travel hundreds of miles because you want to make sure that this girl isn't in trouble? This is the girl that I let into my own home.",
        "Casey: Wait, so, now you're mad at her?",
        "Margo: No, I'm not. I'm scared that she's into something that she can't handle. Would you please tell us what kind of trouble Maddie is in?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I need the names of her contacts for that story she's been working on. You just tell me who they are --",
        "Dusty: I don't know.",
        "Susan: And I -- I don't believe you. When Emily -- when Emily was beat up that time, you're the guy who said he was going to find out who did it. And you did, didn't you? Didn't you?",
        "Dusty: I checked out some things, yeah.",
        "Susan: Yeah, yeah, so, tell me their names.",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Susan: Okay, I'll go to the police.",
        "Dusty: She's not a missing person --",
        "Susan: I'm not talking about the missing persons division. I'm talking about the vice squad. If anybody can find hookers in Oakdale, I'm sure those guys can -- what am I talking about? I can just go to the free clinic at the hospital and talk to a few of the regulars. They can tell me who the pimps and madams are in this town.",
        "Dusty: All right, okay, all right. I'll check it out. You don't talk to anybody. You got it?",
        "Susan: Why, thank you. Sorry I'm leaning on you so hard. But I have a very bad feeling. And I'm hoping that Emily is all right.",
        "Dusty: I'm sure she is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lance: Leaving already? I thought you wanted to be a porn star?",
        "Emily: I want some information, and I'm willing to pay for it.",
        "Lance: Haven't you heard? What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.",
        "Emily: $200? $300? $1,000?",
        "Lance: Look, I'm not coughing up information for any amount of money. So why don't you just get out of here --",
        "Emily: Just tell me who the girl is in that poster.",
        "Lance: What, do you want to cast her in something?",
        "Emily: She's my sister. Her name is Alison.",
        "Lance: Is this some kind of gag?",
        "Emily: Look at this. This is Alison. This girl is my sister.",
        "Lance: Sorry. It's not the same girl.",
        "Emily: That's Alison.",
        "Lance: How long has it been since you've seen your sister?",
        "Emily: Okay, okay -- her picture in the poster doesn't look exactly like her, because clearly, she's airbrushed. And you only see this side of her face. But I know it's her. I'm sure of it.",
        "Lance: Why?",
        "Emily: Because I just saw part of your movie. And I know my sister. It was her eyes, her gestures, her voice. Where can I find her?",
        "Lance: All right, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but you seem to be so sure about this --",
        "Emily: Has something happened to Alison? What do you know? What has happened to her?",
        "Lance: No, I mean, I don't know about your sister, but the girl in this poster is fine. And her name's not Alison.",
        "Emily: Well -- okay, so, what? She has a stage name now?",
        "Lance: No, this actress's real name is Jodi Miller. I've known her for years.",
        "Emily: How many?",
        "Lance: Five or so.",
        "Emily: Alison was living at home five years ago.",
        "Lance: Well, there you go.",
        "Emily: Where's this Jody from?",
        "Lance: South Carolina. She was raised on a farm. Sweet girl, not too bright. You know, you give her five minutes, she'll tell you her life story. Look, all I'm saying is, if Jodi had a sister, I would have known about it, all right?",
        "Emily: Introduce me to her.",
        "Lance: What?",
        "Emily: Jodi -- let me meet her. Then I'll know for sure.",
        "Lance: I try to be nice to you -- this is how I get treated, huh? Why don't you just get out of here?",
        "Emily: Not without my sister.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I think you're looking for me.",
        "Cheri: I think not.",
        "Dusty: Are you going to act like you don't know me, Cheri? I only need a few minutes.",
        "Cheri: Yeah, that's all it takes some guys. Yeah, I remember you. You're Emily's boyfriend. The jealous maniac that almost got me and my whole operation busted.",
        "Dusty: Emily and I are friends. I'm worried about her working with you.",
        "Cheri: Oh, so, now that she's out of town, you thought you'd check out the other working girls? Is that it?",
        "Dusty: Is she out of town? What is she doing out of town? A job for you?",
        "Cheri: I'm strictly a local operation.",
        "Dusty: Then where is she?",
        "Cheri: Vacation, I guess.",
        "Dusty: Come on, everybody knows your girls don't leave anywhere without talking to you. So, why don't you tell me where she is?",
        "Cheri: And why don't you back off? I told you I don't --",
        "Dusty: Come on, I can put the cops all over you.",
        "Cheri: What for? I don't know what Emily's doing. I don't know anything about it. She's not one of my girls anymore.",
        "Dusty: Did you fire her?",
        "Cheri: You know, for someone who's supposed to be a friend of hers, you sure don't know every much. She's not hooking anymore. She quit.",

        "Casey: Maddie wasn't the one with the problem, it was me.",
        "Margo: Well, you just said that Maddie was in trouble.",
        "Casey: Oh, I thought that she was, because she said she didn't love me. And I couldn't believe that.",
        "Tom: So, knowing years of your life, your very freedom was at stake, you followed her anyway?",
        "Casey: I thought there was more to it than that, but I was wrong. She broke up with me because of the gambling. And then when I said was going to stop, and I didn't, and then I stole that $10,000 from will. And I thought she could get over that, but she couldn't. So, she left with will and Gwen.",
        "Tom: Who wound up a few miles from the Canadian border?",
        "Casey: They just went to the last place they thought that I'd look, that's all.",
        "Margo: What happened with Maddie?",
        "Casey: We patched things up and we came back. And Gwen and Will, too.",
        "Margo: So you were never going to leave the country?",
        "Casey: The only reason I was in northern Michigan was to find Gwen, Will and Maddie. And that's pretty much everything you guys need to know, right?",
        "Tom: Well, actually we're trying to help you, Casey. And your story doesn't make sense.",
        "Maddie: Please don't put Casey in jail! It's all my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I keep trying to forget about what Adam did, but I can't -- I can't stop. It's like pictures in my head.",
        "Will: Gwen, he attacked you. And that's not the kind of thing that you get over in a few hours. I understand.",
        "Gwen: I love you.",
        "Will: I love you, too.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I just put on a fresh pot of coffee, unless you'd like some more tea -- if you'd like that.",
        "Will: How did you get in?",
        "Barbara: I used the spare key that you always keep outside. In fact, I kept it for safekeeping while you were gone. Welcome back.",
        "Will: What do you want?",
        "Barbara: A kiss hello would be nice.",
        "Will: An explanation would be better.",
        "Gwen: Will --",
        "Barbara: Its okay, Gwen. I'd be a little grumpy, too, if I'd just given away my entire trust fund to my mother-in-law, the ex-con.",
        "Gwen: You found out about that?",
        "Barbara: You thought that I wouldn't?",
        "Will: Just lay off Gwen, okay? I gave the money to Iris, and I'm not apologizing for it.",
        "Barbara: No apologizes, got it. So, what's she got on you?",
        "Will: What are you talking about?",
        "Barbara: Iris is obviously blackmailing you. Otherwise, why would you have given her all of your money? With no apologies?",
        "Will: It's my money to give away, Mom. You gave it to me.",
        "Barbara: But I earned it. That money is the result of decades of my blood, sweat and tears. And now that woman is profiting from my labor? I don't think so, Will!",
        "Will: Mom, it's done.",
        "Barbara: You know what? That doesn't cut it. I'm not asking for an apology, I'm not asking for gratitude, and I certainly know that I'm not expecting any of your love after the last few years. But I will not stand for another minute without knowing why you threw my money away!",
        "Will: I didn't want the money, Mom. It caused nothing but problems for me and Gwen, so I gave it to Iris. End of story.",
        "Barbara: Why? Why did Will give your mother the money?",
        "Gwen: He just told you.",
        "Barbara: No, he just lied to me. That's why I'm asking you.",
        "Will: Mom, just leave her alone.",
        "Barbara: If Will had wanted to give the money away, he would have given it to a charity, where it would have done some good. He never, in a million years, would give his money away to a woman like that!",
        "Will: Stop it, Mom!",
        "Gwen: No, it's okay. I mean, you're right. My mother is a horrible person. And if I could go through the rest of my life without ever laying eyes on her again, I would. It would be a dream come true. And that's why Will gave her the money. Because she kept hounding us, and the only way to get her to leave us alone for good was by paying her off.",
        "Will: It was worth every penny.",
        "Barbara: So there was no blackmail?",
        "Gwen: No. There was no blackmail.",
        "Barbara: Don't you two -- don't you two get it? This is not going to end it. Now that you've given her money once, she's definitely coming back.",
        "Will: For what? Mom, we don't have anything.",
        "Barbara: And you never will? You don't plan on making a success of yourself, of owning things, having your own house? A bank account, a savings account --",
        "Will: Mom, the money that I gave Iris is more than enough to satisfy her --",
        "Barbara: She will go through that money in a couple of months, Will. And then she'll be back for more. So we have to have a plan. What does she have on you, Gwen?",
        "Will: Why does it have to be about Gwen?",
        "Barbara: Because it was about you, and she was going to tell one of your deep, dark secrets. You, Will, will take out a full-page ad and beat her to it. She knows the only way to get to you is through Gwen. What is she using to threaten you?",
        "Will: We don't have to explain anything to you. It was my money to give away.",
        "Barbara: I have talked to my lawyers. I can get that money back very easily, legally. So I will go to court and I will straighten this all out. And if I have to, I will hire a slew of private investigators and find out exactly what it is that Iris has over both of you.",
        "Will: Okay, fine. Knock yourself out.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay, this is the part I don't get. With me, you draw the line in the sand -- what you will do and what you won't do. But with Iris, you're letting her bully you, letting her overwhelm you --",
        "Will: Do you think -- do you think you're going to trick me into telling you, Mom? It was my money, it was my choice.",
        "Barbara: Okay, you want a choice? Here's mine. You either tell me what's going on right now, or I will drag Iris's butt into court and make her tell what kind of dark secret she has over you and make it a matter of public record!",
        "Gwen: Will --",
        "Will: You can't push Iris, Mom. Gwen and I could go to jail.",
        "Barbara: What happened? What does Iris think you did?",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry, that's all we can say. There are other people involved.",
        "Will: I'm going to talk to my mom alone for a second, okay?",
        "Gwen: No, please, Will -- I don't want her to know what I did.",
        "Will: I'm going to make it okay. I promise. Just trust me.",
        "Barbara: I know you're trying to figure out what you want and do not want to say to me right now. But you also have to understand that I have figured out that Maddie is probably involved in this, as is Casey.",
        "Will: You can't go to them.",
        "Barbara: No, I'm coming to you. What does Iris know?",
        "Will: Maddie tried to kill Adam and Gwen buried him alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You got to tell me what they did.",
        "Jade: It's nothing. It's just the same old stuff. I can't stand them. And they can't stand me.",
        "Luke: Oh, no, things have changed these last few days. Where were you?",
        "Jade: I was visiting a friend.",
        "Luke: Well, it must have been a really important friend. Because when you didn't call me back --",
        "Jade: Well, I just thought you were checking in. And you know, you needed my help or -- I thought he needed my help.",
        "Luke: So, this friend of yours, it's all over. It's all fixed? You're not going to bail on us again?",
        "Jade: No, no. I'm not going anywhere. I just, you know, don't want to think about Maddie and Gwen. And I want to go home and see if there's anything that I can do to help.",
        "Luke: So, that's it? It's just over?",
        "Jade: Yeah. They'll keep their distance, I'll keep mine.",
        "Luke: And if they don't?",
        "Jade: I'll make them regret it.",

        "Casey: Maddie, I already told my parents everything.",
        "Margo: Why do you think it's your fault, Maddie?",
        "Casey: I already told you --",
        "Tom: Well, now Maddie is going to tell us. So, you made Casey jump bail?",
        "Maddie: He had to follow me. Just like I would have had to follow him if he tried to make me believe that he suddenly stopped loving me.",
        "Margo: Well, if you had to stay away from Casey, why did you just not go to your brother's house and live?",
        "Maddie: I couldn't take the chance of running into him around town, and he'd see that I still cared. I didn't want him coming after me, so I lied to him.",
        "Tom: And to us. Now, Gwen and Will went because --",
        "Maddie: They were just trying to be there for me.",
        "Margo: Okay, so everything that you did to try and get away from each other, now you're back together and everything's okay?",
        "Maddie: Casey risked so much for me, and he showed me that he loves me no matter what, and that he can forgive me. I mean, how could I stay away?",
        "Margo: How indeed? Do you want to try this again, this time tell the truth?",
        "Casey: We already told the truth --",
        "Maddie: You're right. We need to tell you everything.",
        "Casey: Maddie, no!",
        "Maddie: Casey, I have to tell them. All of it, okay?",
        "Maddie: Casey found me the same day he left here. So, he could have been back that night, and everything would have been fine.",
        "Tom: No, he'd already left the jurisdiction. The damage was done.",
        "Maddie: But if he hadn't stayed overnight, it wouldn't be so bad, right? And did that because of me. Because we fought, and didn't want to give up on me. He just kept trying. And I'm so glad that you stayed so we could work things out. But if you hadn't --",
        "Casey: I did what I did because I wanted to, okay? I don't regret any of it.",
        "Margo: What did you fight about, Maddie? Maddie?",
        "Maddie: We fought -- we fought because I wanted him to leave the country with me. I couldn't stand the thought of him being in prison. So, we were so close to the border, but he wouldn't leave. He said he couldn't leave you guys.",
        "Margo: Because of Adam?",
        "Casey: Partly, I guess.",
        "Margo: You know that it is absolutely killing me that I don't know where one of my sons is. And if you had gone missing too --",
        "Casey: Mom, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry for everything. So, do I go straight to jail now?",
        "Tom: First, you appear before a judge.",
        "Casey: Today?",
        "Maddie: But because he turned himself in, he has a chance, right?",
        "Tom: My guess is that Casey's bail will be revoked. I think you should prepare yourself. You could be in jail in a few hours.",

        "Will: Iris tricked us by pretending to know what Gwen and Maddie did.",
        "Barbara: And so you paid her off to keep her quiet.",
        "Will: I had to.",
        "Barbara: Yes, you did. You and Gwen were justified in everything you did.",
        "Will: Even giving Iris your money?",
        "Barbara: Even that. And now that I know all the details, I can -- I can easily get this money back from Iris. I just have to call my attorneys and have them do it.",
        "Will: No, Mom. I'm not going to let you do that.",
        "Barbara: Honey, Adam is alive. Gwen hasn't committed any crime. And why should Iris profit from psychologically abusing her own daughter?",
        "Will: Because Gwen still feels guilty about this.",
        "Barbara: She will get over that. Don't you two realize what you could do with that money?",
        "Will: Mom, if you push Iris, then she's going to talk, and that's going to hurt Gwen. And I can't let that happen.",
        "Barbara: That might happen anyway. I mean, Adam could come back to town, and Jade -- Jade? That girl is a wild card --",
        "Will: All right, Mom, just leave it alone. Drop it.",
        "Barbara: Honey, don't worry. I would never do anything that's going to hurt either one of you.",
        "Will: Hey --",
        "Gwen: Hey. No, you told her everything.",
        "Barbara: Its okay, Honey. I was bound to find out sooner or later. Your husband is wise enough to know that.",
        "Gwen: I didn't want Will to hide anything from you. I just -- I just hate that you know this about me.",
        "Barbara: Do you think I'd think any less of you? Gwen, the upside of having a mother-in-law like me is that there's nothing that you could do that I probably haven't done myself. I still love you. I always will. And I'll make sure that no one ever puts your happiness in jeopardy again.",

        "Dusty: When's the last time you heard from her?",
        "Cheri: A couple of days ago, in Old Town. And that's when she quit. Well, it saved me the trouble of firing her.",
        "Dusty: What about this porn star she was looking for? The one in the movie. Did she ask you about that?",
        "Cheri: No, but I couldn't have helped her with that. I mean, none of girls moonlight as porn stars. And there's not a whole lot of movie-making down here in Oakdale, x-rated or otherwise.",
        "Dusty: So, Emily didn't tell you where she was going?",
        "Cheri: Just that she was in a hurry. And come to think of it, so am I. Are we done?",

        "Emily: In your movie.",
        "Lance: Don't start that with me again.",
        "Emily: The last time I saw Alison was a year ago. But since then, she's disappeared. She's not at her old address. Her phone's been disconnected.",
        "Lance: She was living here in Vegas?",
        "Emily: No, she was living in L.A. but I went out there, went to all the places where she worked. I met up with a friend of hers from Genoa City, nothing.",
        "Lance: You know, I wish I could help you, but -- I got a hundred girls a week coming to this town, and they're not looking back, you know. They don't want their old lives chasing them down.",
        "Emily: You know something.",
        "Lance: I'm just saying, if a girl doesn't want to be found, she won't be. So, why don't you just go on back --?",
        "Emily: I'm not leaving without my sister!",
        "Lance: You don't know what you're messing around with here, all right? You start digging around in this, and someone might have to come here and start looking for you.",
        "Emily: Are you threatening me? Did you threaten Alison? Did you hurt her?",
        "Lance: Look, for the last time, Lady, I don't know your sister. Okay? And I don't have to threaten the girls that work for me. This is a legit operation. But there are others out there that aren't. A girl that doesn't know her way around out here --",
        "Emily: Oh, I know my way around, believe me. And I know you're lying. And I'm going to prove it. Unlock the door.",

        "Dusty: She could be working. I promise, if I hear from her, you'll be the first to know.",
        "Susan: When your son -- when he was taken, Emily did everything she could to help you. And now my daughter's disappeared, my baby, and the best you can do is wait till something truly awful happens to her?",
        "Dusty: Hi, Emily, I know you're not answering your mother's calls. I don't expect you to answer mine, but your mother's worried about you. And now so am I. Call me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You have something else you'd like to say to me?",
        "Lance: The door's locked. Nobody knows you're here. If I was a different kind of guy, I could -- I could make you disappear.",
        "Emily: People know where I am.",
        "Lance: Now who's lying? Look, you seem like a nice woman, so I'm gonna make sure I get this through to you. Go home, so your mother doesn't have to lose another daughter. That door's open now.",
        "Emily: You tell Alison that I love her, and I just -- I just need to know that she's okay.",
        "Lance: How am I going to get a message to someone I'll never know?",
        "[Emily leaves]",

        "Gwen: I really think your mom might be the most bizarre mother-in-law in the entire world.",
        "Will: Well, that makes sense, 'cause she's the most bizarre mother in the world.",
        "Gwen: I think she even likes me better now that she knows that I've done something really horrible.",
        "Will: Yeah, well, that's my mom for you. I'm sorry I told her, but I didn't want her going to Iris and opening this whole thing up.",
        "Gwen: You really think she'll just forget the whole thing?",

        "Jade: You want to talk about what people deserve? Gwen deserves to be in jail.",

        "Maddie: I'll never forget it. I knew being with you would be wonderful, but I just --",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Maddie: I didn't -- I didn't think it would change the way that I feel about you. I love you even more now.",
        "Casey: Come on, where's your positive attitude?",
        "Maddie: Maybe your dad will get a judge that will give you a break, and you can be home tonight.",
        "Casey: I love you.",
        "Margo: It's time. Casey, you've got to go. The judge is waiting.",
