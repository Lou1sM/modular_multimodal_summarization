        "Holden: Hey, hey, hey. That's mine.",
        "Carly: Oh, hi. Sorry. I didn't see you.",
        "Holden: I took a long time to get that cup of coffee.",
        "Carly: Yeah, it's pretty crowded. May I join you?",
        "Holden: Um, yeah, sure, sure.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Holden: How's Jack doing?",
        "Carly: Fine. He's good. Better. I'm still chauffeuring him around. But today he decided to do some errands by himself.",
        "Holden: Good. Glad to hear things are working out.",
        "Carly: Well, not exactly everything. It's been good for the kids, you know. I'm sure that you're aware of the situation. I've been trying to get closer to Jack, but he insists that I'm trying too hard.",
        "Holden: What do you expect?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm looking for Lisa.",
        "Clerk: I'm sorry, she's out for the moment.",
        "Jack: She is? You want to tell me where she is?",
        "Clerk: I'm not sure. Would you like to leave a message?",
        "Jack: No, just tell her that Jack Snyder dropped by and wanted to see how she was doing. Check on the security system.",
        "Lily: Hey, excuse me, Jack. Mr. Snyder, what are you doing back to work?",
        "Jack: I'm not officially -- I'm not officially back to work. I'm just going a little stir crazy around the house.",
        "Lily: Oh, you better take some time to recover from the shooting.",
        "Jack: I will. I will. I'm doing much better. Thank you.",
        "Lily: How are you and Carly?",
        "Jack: She wants us to get back together. Like now. And it's putting a lot of pressure on me. And to tell you the truth, I don't think I'm handling the pressure very well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: When I heard that you were thinking about selling your land to a developer, I knew that I was the only guy for the job. We have such a long history together. I care about you. I care about the farm. I know how important it is for you to maintain the natural beauty of this environment. So I really hope I get the contract to do the development.",
        "Meg: Well, you should know that there is another offer on the table.",
        "Mike: Who else is bidding?",
        "Meg: Worldwide.",
        "Mike: Lucinda's company? That makes things complicated.",
        "Meg: Well, Lucinda is still chairperson, but the new CEO of Worldwide is Paul Ryan.",
        "Mike: Paul Ryan? Wow, would you really sell your land to Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey, Katie. I knew you'd be back. What is the matter with you and Brad stealing bikes? You reliving your teens?",
        "Katie: No, that was my fault, not Brad's. I kind of drove him to it.",
        "Margo: What's next? You're going to be robbing armored trucks?",
        "Katie: No, he proposed to me.",
        "Margo: Yeah. And you said no.",
        "Katie: No, I didn't say no, exactly. I told him I'd think about it.",
        "Margo: Are you out of your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay, so the bike goes in the lake. It lands a few feet from the shore. I'm sitting down with water up to my neck, I mean, how deep can a lake be, right? But you know me, I yell help to Katie and tell her I can't swim. She buys it, thinks I'm drowning! She jumps in. Boom, that does it. It proves she cares. So I get out, I'm soaking wet, I'm telling her I didn't even have to think twice. Suddenly, I'm down on one knee. And you know -- I'm a cold, wet, slimy mess. And I ask her to marry me.",
        "Vienna: Again?",
        "Brad: Again, again. But the really amazing thing is that she didn't say no.",
        "Vienna: Really?",
        "Brad: She actually said she'd think about it. And she sounded -- she sounded serious.",
        "Vienna: Oh my God, this is fabulous news! This is amazing! Good work, Brad. Good work. Well, your next move -- you have to make a grand gesture.",
        "Brad: Falling in the lake wasn't enough?",
        "Vienna: No, you have to do something really spectacular to seal the deal.",
        "Henry: No. That would be the worst thing that you could do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I don't believe this. You're seriously thinking of getting married again? I mean, wasn't this proposal a little, I don't know, out of the blue?",
        "Katie: Maybe, but Brad really does care about me.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, you know that advice I gave you a little while ago?",
        "Katie: Yeah, you said to get out there and have fun.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well disregard it, because it's making you do really stupid things like steal bikes and accept impromptu marriage proposals.",
        "Katie: But you also said to make up my mind. To decide once and for all if I wanted to be with Jack or Brad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Brad, don't go overboard with Katie. That will just backfire, all right? You proposed. You made your case. She said that she would think about it. So give her a little space. Let her come to you.",
        "Brad: Wow. We are back at square one. You're giving me advice on my love life -- again.",
        "Henry: Who knows better about Katie than I do? I mean, I was married to her. And I lost her. So I know what not to do.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry, Henry, but I disagree.",
        "Henry: Look, if you push too much here, she's going to run away from you so fast it will make your head spin and heart sink lower than you ever thought possible.",
        "Vienna: He has no idea what he's talking about.",
        "Henry: Look, okay, my best advice? Let Katie make her own decision in her own time. Be patient, Brad. She will appreciate that.",
        "Vienna: And Katie will also appreciate a truly stunning expression of your love for her.",
        "Brad: Okay, if that is the case, then what do I do to win Katie over and make her say yes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Katie, Katie, really, Honey, please, just be honest with yourself. You really want to marry Brad -- is it because you can't have Jack? Or worse, is it because you want to strike out at Jack by marrying his brother? See, either way, it's a really bad reason to get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Yes. I do have issues with Paul.",
        "Meg: But you're keeping an open mind.",
        "Emma: I'm trying to, anyway.",
        "Mike: So tell me everything. What was your biggest crop last year? How's the livestock? Did you sell the horses?",
        "Emma: Let me tell you. Eggs this year, you have no idea. I have a new rooster, I mean, I'm telling you. Harvey is his name. We have more eggs --",
        "Meg: Hey, Paul. It's Meg. Look, I thought I should tell you. I know who your competition is, the person who's trying to outbid you for Mama's land.",
        "Paul: How the heck did you find out?",
        "Meg: Well, he happens to be here. Right now. Sitting at the kitchen table with Mama.",
        "Paul: I'll be right over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude. But I know where Jack is coming from.",
        "Carly: Have you been talking to him about how he feels?",
        "Holden: Not recently, no.",
        "Carly: Then how do you know?",
        "Holden: Because I know my cousin. Jack is weary about getting involved with you again. And if you would just be honest with yourself, then you would admit that Jack has every reason to be cautious.",
        "Carly: Give me a break. Who the hell are you? What is it about you Snyder men that makes you so damn self-righteous?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Drink it. No, no, no. More. You need your vitamins. You need your rest. You should be home resting.",
        "Jack: Now you're really sounding like Carly. Stop it.",
        "Lily: Carly cares about you. And why wouldn't she want to get back together with you? Because you're a prince. You're a catch.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Oh, that's me.",
        "Lily: You are.",
        "Jack: Tell me something. How am I supposed to forget everything that happened? The lies, the schemes, the stunts that she's pulled, huh? Tell me, please.",
        "Lily: I know, I know. I shouldn't talk. I've had some issues with honesty in my relationship with Holden. And he had every right to give up on me. Not take me back, but somehow he felt he had enough love for me to give us another chance. So why don't you do the same with Carly? If there is still love there, no matter what you've been through, no matter how many hard times the two of you have shared, you have to find a way to make a fresh start. But first, you have to know if that love is worth saving.",
        "Jack: No, I've never doubted that Carly loved me.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Jack: And I've always loved her. That's not the issue. I just don't know that if we get back together anything will really change.",
        "Lily: You both have to change. That's what I'm trying to do with Holden. It's not easy. Jack, you have to try. You and Carly both have to try.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Maybe you should talk to Lily about this. She'd be more sympathetic.",
        "Carly: No, I'd like to talk to you. You're a man. You're a Snyder. Maybe you can help me understand.",
        "Holden: I'm not sure I can do this.",
        "Carly: Come on. Please. There's got to be a way that I can get through to Jack.",
        "Holden: Carly, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to go to Jack and plead your case for you?",
        "Carly: Would you mind?",
        "Holden: I'm kidding.",
        "Carly: No, I'm not. Jack and I are at a real crossroads here. We just saved our son together, and we're finally back together as a family. And what I want more than anything is for us be a couple again. And I know you understand how important that is, don't you?",
        "Holden: Of course, I understand. Lily and I are kind of in the same situation. I understand why you feel strongly about wanting to get back with Jack.",
        "Carly: Well, if you get it, then why can't he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You know how many times Carly and I have tried to make it work. We have been down that road over and over again. And it always leads to the same place. Carly always ends up lying to me. And I'm always surprised. I'm always hurt. And ultimately, the kids are the ones who pay for it. Do you know how much damage that does to the family? I can't let that happen to me or the kids again. I won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You know what I think? I think you just really like to be proposed to. It's really not about being married. No, you just want to be part of the gang and everything. And now that you can't have Jack --",
        "Katie: Wait, wait, wait. How do you know that?",
        "Margo: Well, he told me. He told me. And he said that he wasn't going to pursue anything further with you and now that you know that he's out of the picture, I think you're rebounding to Brad. And that is a really bad idea.",
        "Katie: Margo, this proposal with Brad didn't just start our relationship. It's been happening for a long time. I mean he's been the one that's been there for me during all this heartache with Jack. He's my closest friend. We tried to have a baby together.",
        "Margo: Yeah, that was another really bad idea.",
        "Katie: Well, maybe at the time. Yeah, but it brought us a lot closer. We have so much fun together. He makes me laugh. He's in my corner. He's always got my back. He's gorgeous and sexy and so fantastic in bed.",
        "Margo: All right, that's -- I don't need to know this.",
        "Katie: Okay, I'm sorry. I'm just saying that he has so much going for him. Why shouldn't I at least think about his proposal?",
        "Margo: Honey, how many times have you been married? Now you add Brad to the list. You're about to give Lisa a run for her money. Now is that really the kind of life that you want? All I ask is that you please just proceed with caution. Slow down. Don't rush into this. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: If you really wants to win Katie over, you got to make a big, grand romantic statement. Not sugary and sweet. But something powerful and exciting. Like a beautiful piece of vintage jewelry. Or maybe an extravagant trip?",
        "Brad: Vienna, come on. I've done all of that. I mean, I even bought the woman a brand-new house!",
        "Henry: Oh my goodness. Talk about overkill. No wonder you keep striking out with her. Brad, you're pushing too hard. You need to be laid back for a little bit.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no, no. You have to do something you have not done before.",
        "Brad: That's it. That's it. You're right. I have to do something completely different. I have to do something that'll convince Katie to say she'll marry me.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Vienna: There, you see, all he needed was a little bit of encouragement. He will win Katie over.",
        "Henry: Yeah, either that or he'll hit the wall, and it won't be pretty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What's going on? Why is Emma meeting with the competition? And who is it? Who made an offer?",
        "Meg: Why don't you see for yourself?",
        "Mike: That was the worst Christmas ever.",
        "Emma: Oh, no. The worst Christmas was when we couldn't get into the woods because of the snow to cut a tree -- Bigfoot.",
        "Meg: Hey, look who's here. Paul, you know Mike Kasnoff.",
        "Paul: Yeah, of course I do. Hi, great to see you. I'm so sorry to interrupt.",
        "Mike: How's it going?",
        "Paul: You tell me. I heard the overseas company that you work for had made a bid on Emma's land.",
        "Mike: That is true. And I've heard that you and Worldwide are also interested.",
        "Paul: Well, we made the first offer. And we're willing to match whatever offer you made, but I gotta tell you, I don't think we're in the mood for a bidding war.",
        "Mike: I totally agree with you. Which is why I've come up with a solution.",
        "Paul: Really, what's that?",
        "Mike: How about if you and I each make a pitch to Emma? Our plans are bound to be different. So, we'll lay them out on the table for comparison's sake. That way, Emma can listen to them, judge for herself, and then decide.",
        "Emma: Yes, I think that's a very practical idea.",
        "Paul: Well, Mike, this is your idea. Go ahead, knock yourself out.",
        "Mike: All right, fine. I'll just take one second here to get set up.",
        "Emma: Well, my goodness. Seems like you've really done your homework.",
        "Mike: It's really no trouble at all. I just want to let you know exactly what our plans are. Our company is experts at designing new developments and seamlessly into the existing landscape. We don't do cookie-cutter projects. See, everything is individually tailored to fit the natural surroundings. In this case, it's all about the farm. We want to maintain open spaces, so that each house seems surrounded by the farm, instead of the other way around.",
        "Emma: Yes.",
        "Mike: Now you want to maintain pond as your own private property, so we're going to work with you to preserve it and hopefully use it as a self- sustaining reservoir to keep the open spaces green and flourishing. Now, houses themselves are all going to be green buildings. The highest environmental standards, everything's eco-friendly, energy efficient, and they'll be plenty of space left over in case you'll want your children or your grandchildren to continue farming. So, that is it. But I also want you to know that we have an entire team of experts, who has put a lot of planning into everything down to the smallest detail. And we are really excited. In addition to being a beautiful, sustainable community, this can also serve as a model and really set a standard for all of Oakdale.",
        "Emma: Wow, wonderful. So, Paul, can you match that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Once Brad surprises Katie with a reason to say yes, she will be swept off her feet. Katie will accept his proposal.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'm not so sure. Actually, I am quite sure. I am so sure that I will wager 1,000 bucks that Katie will not say yes to Brad.",
        "Vienna: How can you say that? First of all, why are you so dead set against the happy ending between Brad and Katie?",
        "Henry: I don't know. I just don't see it happening. I'll up the wager -- $2,000.",
        "Vienna: That's my second point. I thought your gambling days were over.",
        "Henry: Oh Baby, they are. Oh gambling -- yes, those days -- those days are gone. So let's find out something else -- a better wage. I've got a great idea. How about we wager a marathon session in the sack? If I win, we do everything that I want to do. If you win, we do everything that you want to do. How does that sound? How does that sound?",
        "Vienna: Perfect. Because no matter what happens, we both win!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Seal the deal. A grand gesture. Seal the deal.",
        "P.A.: We are finished dubbing the tape.",
        "Brad: What?",
        "P.A.: For the Chicago talk show awards submission.",
        "Brad: Right. Thank you.",
        "P.A.: You want me to put these old tapes back?",
        "Brad: Sure. No. Wait, wait. No, no. No, I'll handle it. Yeah. Yeah, I'll take care of it. You don't have to bother.",
        "P.A.: They're all yours. Thanks.",
        "Brad: Baby, oh, Baby. This could do the trick. You could be exactly what I need. Katie's going to love it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Congratulations.",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Paul: That was very well done. Emma, I admit I'm not as prepared as Mike was. And to be honest with you, I don't even have a detailed plan as to what to do with you land. I don't have Mike's expertise when it comes to construction, and Worldwide has only just begun to develop real estate. We don't have the resources that an international real estate firm has.",
        "Emma: Wow, you're making a pretty good argument for me to go with Mike.",
        "Paul: No, I don't think that's necessarily the case. I would just like a little bit of time, so that I could come up with a strong, long-term development plan for your land. Now I'm not going to be using an in-house staff to develop these ideas because Worldwide has resources. We have the leading experts in their field Worldwide. And that means that every step of the process will be vetted and authorized by you and your family. I can guarantee that there will be no surprises. And when the project is done, that you will have no regrets. So, I guess the only remaining question really is whether you want the immediate gratification of going with a plan that's already in place, or if you're willing to give me a little bit of time so that I can't insure that you and your family have more input into what happens to your land.",
        "Mike: Emma, I hate to put the pressure on you. I really do. But my company is limited in their resources. And they only allocate them for a certain amount of time. We got a lot of projects on the back burner, and we don't like to keep money lying around. The bottom line is, you got to make a decision, soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: The bottom line is, if you don't have honesty in a relationship, then you really don't have a relationship, do you?",
        "Lily: I know. Believe me, I know everything you're talking about. Because I go through the same things with Holden. But you have to want to rebuild the trust. And it's not easy, but you have to try. Take baby steps, one step at a time. Come on, you've got to give Carly another chance. You know that she loves you so much, and she would do anything to make you happy. And let's face it, the two of you, no matter what you go through, your ups and your downs, you always find your way back to each other. You know why? Because you're meant to be together. How about this? You ever think that maybe the thing that's holding you back isn't Carly? Maybe it's you. Just think about that, okay? Take care of yourself.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily and I, we've been through a lot, but we've decided to try again. There are no guarantees. Maybe for Jack, right now, he just can't see trying again. Not every relationship is fated to make it. Sometimes they run out of steam.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, no, trust me. My relationship with Jack has not run out of steam. And it never will. I am committed to making him believe in me again. To believe that we can have a future together.",
        "Holden: You know what? I'm probably not the best person to ask for advice. I wish you luck, Carly. I hope everything works out.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hi, Jack.",
        "Jack: It's good to see you out of jail. Yeah, I saw you at the station this morning.",
        "Katie: Yeah, that, well, I was afraid my sister was going to throw me in the slammer.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm glad it all worked out.",
        "Katie: It did. They didn't press charges. So we just paid for the bikes and apologized to the owners.",
        "Jack: Good, good. So you and Brad are okay?",
        "Katie: Yeah. He proposed.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Katie: What do you think about that?",
        "Jack: Brad proposed?",
        "Katie: Down on one knee.",
        "Jack: Wow. Wow. If marrying Brad is what you want, I think you should go for it.",
        "Katie: Seriously? Well, then I guess there's nothing holding me back, is there?",
        "Jack: Not as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Katie: Great. Well, that's all I needed to hear. Thank you, Jack. Take care of yourself.",
        "Jack: You, too. You, too, Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "P.A.: We're ready to roll. In five, four, three --",
        "Brad: Welcome to a very special production of \"Oakdale Now.\" Actually, this segment is called \"Brad and Katie now.\" No, no, make that \"Katie and Brad now.\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It's really over. If it wasn't meant to be with Jack, why do you think it would work out with his brother? I'm sorry, Brad, I can't accept your proposal -- say it like you mean it, Katie. I'm sorry, Brad, I can't -- I just can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I hope that what I'm about to show you proves something. That you and I do belong together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I don't mean to pressure you, Emma, but I am on deadline. I know that you may go with Paul. And that's fine, because he was first one to step up to the plate, so he deserves to be the first one to take a crack at the ball. But I want you to keep in mind that Worldwide is new to the world of real estate development and my company has a long history. But it is completely your decision.",
        "Paul: I agree, Emma. It is completely your decision.",
        "Holden: Hey, Mike.",
        "Lily: Hey, Mike, how are you? It's so good to see you!",
        "Lily: Oh, give me a hug first. Come on.",
        "Holden: It's been a long time, huh? It's good to see you.",
        "Mike: You, too.",
        "Lily: So what are you doing here? What's going on?",
