        "Katie: All right, I need a roasted chicken with applesauce -- okay, perfect -- no, wait. Was that chicken soup or roasted chicken? They're probably not that hungry.",
        "Mike: Excuse me. Nurse?",
        "Katie: Um, actually, I'm a nurses' aide.",
        "Mike: Doesn't matter. I could use some help.",
        "Katie: Well, I could use some help, too. None of these stupid menus are adding up -- pepper steak.",
        "Mike: It's kind of an emergency.",
        "Katie: Oh, isn't everything in this place? Oh, wait I know you. Mike Kasnoff, right?",
        "Mike: Right. Right. And you're --",
        "Katie: Katie Frasier. How can I help you?",
        "Mike: Um, well I had an accident.",
        "Katie: Oh, your hand? What happened?",
        "Mike: I was working in the Burn unit. I cut myself on the band saw.",
        "Katie: Okay, you're gonna need the emergency room then. You just go down this hall, it's the second door on the right. Just go all the way to the end.",
        "Mike: Okay, thanks. Do you think you could help me find something before I go?",
        "Katie: Well, I don't know. What is it?",
        "Mike: The tip of my little finger.",

        "Regina: Alison spent last night in what we call \"classification.\" That's where we evaluate new prisoners and decide where they'll be living during their sentence.",
        "Emily: Wait a minute, don't they all stay here.",
        "Regina: Well, there are several levels of security, depending on the prisoner's needs and crime. Alison qualified for level one, which has the least restrictions.",
        "Emily: Great. I mean, if she has to be here?",
        "Regina: Well, I'm not sure Alison would agree. She insisted on seeing you before she was moved. That's why I called Hal.",
        "Hal: And I appreciate it, Regina. I know the rules call for no visitors during the first month.",
        "Regina: Well, you've done favors for me. So this was my turn.",
        "Emily: Did Alison happen to mention to you why she wanted to see us?",
        "Regina: Not specifically. But I got the feeling that she hasn't accepted the fact that she's going to be incarcerated for the next year.",
        "[Buzzer sounds]",
        "Alison: Please don't make me stay! We've got to go back to the judge.",
        "Hal: Alison, it's too late for that.",
        "Alison: No, no, no. I'm not going to make it. You've got to get me out.",

        "Newman: I told you Sam was a crack investigator. And he's got something I think you're going to like. Sam?",
        "Sam: Now this is a mock-up of the article. And we give the word, this is gonna run in every tabloid from St. Louis to Chicago.",
        "Newman: What do you think? You ready to lower the boom?",
        "Marshall: You know, I understand the benefits of acting quickly. But at this point, I don't think it's necessary.",
        "Newman: You know something I don't?",
        "Marshall: I've made a few moves. And I'd like to see how they turn out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You want me to consider dropping the case against Marshall? Why? Is it because of last night?",
        "Ben: No.",
        "Jessica: Ben, I really wanted to be with you. I did. But my heart was saying yes, but my body -- I don't know. When you touched me, everything just kinda shut down.",
        "Ben: Jessica, you don't have to explain that. I understand.",
        "Jessica: Well, I promise you it won't be like this forever.",
        "Ben: This is not some ploy for me to get what I want.",
        "Jessica: I know it's not. But why would you suggest that I drop the charges?",
        "Ben: Because I love you and I don't want to see you publicly destroyed.",
        "Jessica: Look, Ben, I know this is gonna be difficult for both of us and for our families. But I still think that facing this thing head-on is the right way to go.",
        "Ben: Not anymore.",
        "Jessica: Someone got to you, didn't they?",
        "Ben: Yes.",

        "Carly: It would be nice if you could bulldoze me into finishing the fall collection, the way you've bulldozed me into doing so many things in the past. But it's not gonna work this time, Craig. I've got the desire. I just don't have anything to back it up.",
        "Craig: Well, sit down. I'll help you.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Craig: I don't know. I'll improvise.",
        "Carly: Craig, it's too late. All right, whatever creative drive I had has just buckled under the pressure.",
        "Craig: You can rise above it. You have a will of iron.",
        "Carly: I also have a baby growing inside me, struggling to be born healthy. I've got Rosanna creating deadlines that are impossible to meet. I've got Barbara Ryan just waiting for me to fall on my face. I've got Jack and Mike battling over which one of them can take care of me best. And then I've got you. I've got you pushing and pushing without the slightest regard for anything else.",
        "Craig: Why don't we go for a walk around the pond? You can clear your head --",
        "Carly: That's not going to help anything!",
        "Craig: Nature can be very stimulating.",
        "Carly: Are you not listening to me? Please listen to me! Carly the designer is gone. She exists no more.",
        "Craig: I can bring in a consultant I know in Paris. She's young, eager to please -- she'll work with you for a little while, prime your pump. Then we send her home, and you're back in business.",
        "Carly: Would you please answer something for me. Are you refusing to hear me or are you just incapable of hearing me?",
        "Craig: No, I've heard what you're saying and I sympathize with your problem.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, thank you. Finally.",
        "Craig: But on the same hand, you can't let problems take over. All right, so why don't you take a cold shower or a hot bath or whichever works for you and wash all that negativity down the drain? Huh?",
        "Carly: Get out of here.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Carly: I want -- I want you out of here this instant.",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Craig: Carly, you and I are in this together and together --",
        "Carly: No, you are not listening to me, are you?",
        "Craig: I'm not going to let you wallowing -- I'm not gonna let you wallow in self-pity.",
        "Carly: Out, out! Out you go!",
        "Craig: Hey, what are you doing? [Talking over each other] you're wasting time here, Carly, we've got a show to do!",
        "Craig: Out of ammo?",
        "Carly: You're still here, huh? Ten seconds, Craig. I give you ten seconds, then I start throwing the china.",
        "Craig: Will you please calm down? Your blood pressure's gonna go up to quadruple digits.",
        "Carly: All you had to do was accept my decision and leave when you were asked. Then I could have remained calm. We could have settled this the easy way.",
        "Craig: I didn't mean to provoke you. But the way you were talking, I didn't know who you were.",
        "Carly: Things change, Craig. I don't want to fight a losing battle.",
        "Craig: There's no such thing. Not if you want something badly enough.",
        "Carly: Of course I want it -- money, respect, a future for myself, for my kids. I want it so bad, I get a lump in my throat just thinking about it.",
        "Craig: Then why are you backing off? And don't tell me it's the pressure. Because you have the nerves of a diamond cutter.",
        "Carly: You know why, Craig! The health of my baby. I am so far behind, I'd have to push myself too hard to make the deadline.",
        "Craig: What else?",
        "Carly: Why does there have to be something else?",
        "Craig: It's just the two of us here, Carly. You don't have to be motherly like for Jack you don't have to be monosyllabic like for Mike Kasnoff. Just tell me whole truth, and we'll both feel better.",
        "Carly: I'm afraid.",
        "Craig: Of what?",
        "Carly: Not being special.",
        "Craig: Hey, you can't help but be special.",
        "Carly: I know you feel that way about me. For some bizarre reason, it does make me smile. But it isn't enough.",
        "Craig: Look, it's okay to have doubts. Even I get them, sometimes. The important thing is not to let them take over.",
        "Carly: I've had one success, the B.R.O. show in New York. That's hardly enough to declare myself the savior of the fashion world.",
        "Craig: And who do you think is? Barbara Ryan?",
        "Carly: Maybe. Maybe all this time I've been a fluke and Barbara Ryan is the real deal.",
        "Craig: You don't believe that. She can't carry your thimbles.",
        "Carly: My sister seems to think otherwise.",
        "Craig: The only reason Rosanna wants Barbara Ryan involved at Monte Carlo is because she knows you and I will hate it.",
        "Carly: Well, she's right. It's driving me completely out of my skull.",
        "Craig: Well, then do something about it and design away.",
        "Carly: I can't. Without inspiration, I've got nothing!",
        "Craig: Yes, you do. You've got those pencils. You've got this pad. You've got a mammoth talent. That is your weapon. So lock, load, and let her rip, Carly!",
        "Carly: Jack's gonna be back soon. I really think it'd be better if you weren't here when he gets here.",
        "Craig: Yeah, he's probably figured out there is no six-car collision on route 18 by now.",
        "Carly: What? You sent Jack on a wild goose chase so you come here and try to change my mind?",
        "Craig: Well, just asking Jack to leave wouldn't exactly cut it, would it?",
        "Carly: Wait, you had no right to do that, Craig! Jack has every right to be worried about me! He wants me to be healthy!",
        "Craig: So do I. What?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Craig: Sit down. Sit down. How do you -- you feel all right?",
        "Carly: No, I feel like the top of my head is gonna blow off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Katie? Katie?",
        "Katie: I'll be right there. I have roasted chicken. What am I doing here?",
        "Mike: You fainted. So I carried you in.",
        "Katie: Oh. Thanks.",
        "Mike: How're you feeling?",
        "Katie: Great. Whoa -- that was stupid.",
        "Mike: I'll ring for some help.",
        "Katie: Oh, wait should you be looking for your --",
        "Mike: No, don't -- don't say it. I'll leave as soon as someone gets here.",
        "Katie: Are you sure? Because what if it gets lost?",
        "Mike: Or it could get eaten by a mouse. I'm sorry. I was trying to lighten things up a little bit.",
        "Katie: No, it's okay. I'm not usually the type of person who faints. It's just I've had kind of a rough year medical-wise. I donated part of my liver to my sister.",
        "Mike: You're kidding me.",
        "Katie: Hmm-mm.",
        "Mike: That's an incredibly brave thing to do.",
        "Katie: That's one way to look at it. But when you get that opportunity to save someone, you just say yes, what other answer is there?",
        "Chris: Katie? What are you doing here?",
        "Mike: She blacked out. So I carried her in.",
        "Chris: Did you hit your head when you fell?",
        "Katie: I don't know. Did I?",
        "Mike: No, no, I caught her before she had a chance to break anything. Look, stay healthy, all right?",
        "Katie: Thank you. Oh, good luck finding your finger.",
        "Mike: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: That package that was delivered here last night?",
        "Jessica: The x-rays from the hospital.",
        "Ben: It wasn't x-rays and it wasn't from the hospital.",
        "Jessica: You lied to me? Ben, I really don't need that right now.",
        "Ben: It was pictures of you and Travers together. It was a still lifted from that videotape. I knew that it was from Travers. It was his little invitation for me to go see him.",
        "Jessica: Why didn't you tell me that?",
        "Ben: Because it was sent to me and I wanted to deal with it.",
        "Jessica: So what happened when you got there? He managed to convince you that dropping the charges would be a wise decision on my part?",
        "Ben: Yes.",
        "Jessica: How?",
        "Ben: He made it clear that he was gonna release a copy of the photo to the press.",
        "Jessica: I should've -- I should've known that when the court ruled that tape inadmissible that Marshall would find some way to use it.",
        "Ben: Jessica, he wants to poison the jury pool. He wants to show the world that the two of you were lovers, not rapist and victim.",
        "Jessica: And that convinced you that I should back off?",
        "Ben: And he showed me that way that his lawyers are gonna treat you on the stand. I don't want to see you publicly humiliated.",
        "Jessica: Ben, I am an attorney. I can handle whatever they throw at me on the stand.",
        "Ben: Why put yourself through all this, if the chances of winning are so slim?",
        "Jessica: Because if I don't even try, then Marshall will have violated me all over again.",
        "Ben: Jessica, you can't win this trial! You can't win it.",
        "Jessica: Every day, I have had to force myself not to run away from this. I knew it would be hard, but I thought if I had you on my side --",
        "Ben: Baby, I am on your side. That's why I'm telling you all of this.",
        "Jessica: What, telling me to quit? Telling me I don't stand a chance? I mean, that's not the kord of support I need, Ben.",
        "Ben: My own brother doesn't believe you. How are you gonna convince a jury of 12 total strangers?",
        "Jessica: So that's why Isaac hasn't been around? That's why he didn't come to the arraignment?",
        "Ben: Yes.",
        "Jessica: He still hasn't forgiven me for cheating on you.",
        "Ben: Jessica, this is not about Isaac.",
        "Jessica: Well, then, what is it about? I mean, why would he take Marshall's word over mine?",
        "Ben: Because he read the letter that Travers wrote you.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie told me she threw that away.",
        "Ben: Well, she didn't. She read it.",
        "Jessica: And then she gave it to Isaac?",
        "Ben: And Isaac gave it to me, and I read it.",
        "Jessica: So the three of you are getting together behind my back?",
        "Ben: Jessica, that's not what's happening.",
        "Jessica: No, yeah, that's exactly what's happening. You're reading my letters and then you're forming opinions without even giving me the benefit of a discussion.",
        "Ben: That letter was Travers' calculated ploy to put you on the defensive and to plead for your sympathy at the same time. And I gave you the benefit of the doubt. I'd burn that letter on the spot.",
        "Jessica: What exactly did it say?",
        "Ben: Well, of course it says that he didn't rape you.",
        "Jessica: Yeah.",
        "Ben: He claims that he's still in love with you. But it doesn't matter what that letter says. That's his strategy, Jessica. He's gonna tell the court that you two are lovers, that you had this clandestine, on-the-edge relationship. You add that to the photo and the paper, and it's gonna look like it was some love affair gone bad.",
        "Jessica: Is that what you think it is?",
        "Ben: No, that's not what I think it is. I still think you need to drop this case.",
        "Jessica: Even if I'm right.",
        "Ben: Even if you're right. We haven't even gone to trial yet, and this thing is tearing you apart. I don't want to be forced to watch him publicly take your dignity.",
        "Jessica: But at least I'll have my self-respect. And I thought I would have you, too, Ben. But I guess I was wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: When we were in court, mom said that I could change my plea and I could get a trial instead of a hearing. Well, can't we go back and do that now? This place, Emily, it's a nightmare. There's no way I'll last a year.",
        "Emily: Would you mind if we had a minute alone with Alison? I promise, we won't be long.",
        "Regina: If you think it'll help.",
        "Emily: Thanks. Come here, sweetie. Come here. I know this is hell for you. I know it is. But I know how strong you are. I know you can handle this.",
        "Alison: No, no, I can't.",
        "Emily: Yes, you can. Listen to me -- have you met any of the other ladies? I mean, the girls that are here. Maybe it will be easier if you make some friends.",
        "Alison: They haven't let me talk to anyone. But the ones that I saw, Emily, they're not too friendly.",
        "Regina: Hal, I'm sorry, but it's time for Alison to go to her room.",
        "Hal: Yes.",
        "Regina: The other girls will be coming back from exercise any minute.",
        "Alison: They gave me two roommates.",
        "Emily: Well, that's good. I mean, maybe it'll be better if you have some company.",
        "Alison: Or maybe they'll hate my guts.",
        "Emily: All right, you listen to me -- just be yourself, all right, and try to get along.",
        "Hal: Alison, your roommates may try to test you. Now, it's important that you just stand your ground, okay?",
        "Alison: I'll do my best. I wish you guys didn't have to go.",
        "Emily: Listen, I have faith in you, honey. I have faith in you, and you're gonna get through this.",
        "Alison: Right. I'm like a shoo-in for prisoner of the month.",
        "Hal: We'll come back as soon they let us.",
        "Alison: Just don't forget about me.",
        "Emily: Never gonna happen. Never gonna happen. I love you, okay? We'll talk to you soon. We'll be back soon. Sorry.",
        "Regina: Let's go. I'll give you a few moments to get settled.",
        "Alison: I've got to be strong. I've got to make the most out of this. Hi. I guess I'm the new girl.",
        "Nicole: Who are you supposed to be? Malibu Barbie?",
        "Alison: That's very cute. Actually, my name is --",
        "Nicole: I don't care what your name is. You touch my stuff again, I'll cut you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's a little bit high, but I'm not in danger.",
        "Craig: All right. Well, we're not gonna have any more emotional discussions today. All right? We'll chat about the weather, maybe a chat about that rack of flan over there.",
        "Carly: I thought you were on your way out.",
        "Craig: I refuse to leave you in this condition.",
        "Carly: I'm fine.",
        "Craig: I'm not.",
        "Carly: See this?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: It's a book on yoga. Dr. Schiller said if I do just 20 minutes a day, my blood pressure will stay low and I will be totally mellow.",
        "Craig: Very interesting. Why haven't you read it?",
        "Carly: Well, I've been a little busy, Craig, burying my career.",
        "Craig: Uh-uh-uh, we will have none of that. You want to do some of those exercises? I'll talk you through them.",
        "Carly: I don't really see you as a stress-buster.",
        "Craig: That's because you don't understand the shavasana.",
        "Carly: The vash -- the what? What is that?",
        "Craig: Lie down. I'll show you.",
        "Carly: I think I've heard that before. Yeah, okay.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm?",
        "Carly: All right, help me out.",
        "Craig: Okay. There we go. Very good. Namaste.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Craig: All right?",
        "Carly: Yep.",
        "Craig: Okay, now. \"Shava\" means \"dead,\" \"masana\" is a posture, so you're lying down just like that.",
        "Carly: Oh, that's --",
        "Craig: Posture of a dead person.",
        "Carly: That's very relaxing. Great. Okay. What next?",
        "Craig: You watch your breath. Take your breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. In through your nose -- and out through your mouth.",
        "Carly: Feels good. You know, I -- I really do want my little girl to be proud of me.",
        "Craig: She will be. When she sees all the sacrifices you've made for her, she'll be counting her blessings when she comes into this earth.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Craig: She'll see that new fall line you did for Monte Carlo, the colors --",
        "Carly: Stop it. You stop it.",
        "Craig: Sorry. It was an involuntary reflex. Watch your breath.",
        "Carly: All right. [Craig breathing] hey, do me a favor, would you?",
        "Craig: I'll try.",
        "Carly: There's a blanket up there. Would you get it for me?",
        "Craig: Okay, coming. You asleep?",
        "Jack: What's wrong? What the hell did you do to her?",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: When did you get back?",
        "Craig: Namaste, Jack. We're doing a little relaxing here.",
        "Jack: You sure you're all right?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I'm fine. I was just a little stressed out, and Craig was -- well, he was reading the yoga book and kind of helping me through it. I guess I fell asleep.",
        "Craig: You woke her up, prince charming.",
        "Jack: Let me help you up. Come on.",
        "Craig: Me, too.",
        "Jack: No, back off. Was he trying to talk you into going back to work?",
        "Carly: Well, you know Craig. Always wants to have his way.",
        "Jack: Even if it means jeopardizing the life of a child and her mother?",
        "Craig: I'll be going. The two of you can get back to whatever you estranged couples do when you're alone.",
        "Jack: Wait a minute, not so fast.",
        "Craig: You want me to stay, Jack?",
        "Jack: I want you to hear what I have to say. You know, you need to decide once and for all. If you want Craig and his promises of glory, then by all means, I will leave you to that. But if not, Craig goes and he never comes back. Take your pick, Carly. Who walks out that door?",

        "Ben: And Evelyn Hart, she is gonna do her very best to fight for you. But she has no evidence. And then Travers, he's gonna get on the stand and he's gonna say that you two were lovers and that he was staying here in this house because you invited him to be here. And on the night in question, you asked me to leave so that you could be alone with him so that you could comfort him in his hour of need. Now, you look at me and you tell me that you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that a jury is gonna convict him of rape. You can't do that.",

        "Jessica: You see, this is why -- this is why I didn't come forward right away. Because I knew this was gonna be tough to prove. And I knew that Marshall would fight dirty. But I promised myself that if I took action, I wasn't gonna let anybody stand in my way, and that includes you, Ben. I won't let you stop me.",

I'm just gonna look at the newspaper tomorrow. I'm sure that I'll find something that pays just as good.",
