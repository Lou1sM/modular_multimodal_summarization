Lily worries about what she has done to her family. Holden greets her with a hug and is on her side, but the guilt is killing Lily.

        "Katie: I just think we should be looking at this from the perspective of a person winning the contest. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't winning the contest be something they would actually like to have happen?",
        "Brad: You're explaining the contest to me? I'm the one who came up with the idea. I mean, I'm the one who nursed it through development.",
        "Katie: Development? Shouting out, \"Hey, let's have a contest\" is not exactly a development.",
        "Brad: Now you're going to tell me how to produce it?",
        "Katie: All I'm saying is that me showing up with a nice bottle of champagne says festive. You showing up with a six-pack of beer, says hey, our brother- in-law lost his job again.",
        "Brad: Well, I don't want to seem high-fluted.",
        "Katie: You don't ever, ever, ever, have to worry about that. You'll never even have to worry about seeming medium-fluted.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, I get your point. We'll do it my way.",
        "Katie: We always do it your way!",
        "Jack: Hey, you two, do I have to give you both a time out?",
        "Brad: Oh, great. I get a lecture in stereo now.",
        "Jack: No, actually, I came here to talk to Katie.",
        "Brad: No, no, we are in the middle of a meeting, okay? And where's your professionalism?",
        "Katie: I cannot believe that you two are from the same gene pool.",
        "Jack: I can't believe that myself.",
        "Katie: What's going on?",
        "Jack: I wanted to talk to you about Henry.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I've been thinking about how upset you were about Henry and I think I might have come up with an idea of how you can smooth things over.",
        "Katie: After everything that you're going through right now, you have time to think about me and Henry?",
        "Jack: Well, yeah, you were crying. I don't like it when anybody cries, about anything --",
        "Katie: Okay, so what's your idea?",
        "Jack: Well, Emma agreed to let Henry and Vienna have the ceremony at the farm. I thought maybe you could give Henry the news, kind of like an olive branch type deal.",
        "Katie: Nice.",
        "Brad: Are you guys talking about Vienna marrying Henry?",
        "Katie: Gosh. I thought I was having a private conversation over here with your brother.",
        "Brad: Okay, well, just don't waste time on a bunch of wedding stuff. Because I have decided that they are not going to get married. I think it's a really bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Darling, there you are. I've been so worried.",
        "Henry: Worried?",
        "Vienna: Yes, whenever you're out of my sight, I keep thinking about all those beautiful women who throw themselves at you -- tempting you.",
        "Henry: Yeah, that's my lot in life.",
        "Vienna: I know you're hiding something. And more than that, I know exactly what it is.",
        "Henry: You do?",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. And I think it's very, very, very sweet, although, you shouldn't be doing that type of shopping all by yourself.",
        "Henry: Huh?",
        "Vienna: Okay. You can take it out and slip it on my finger.",
        "Henry: You know what, I don't think we're on the same page.",
        "Vienna: Of course, we are. Open the box, and put it on my finger.",
        "Henry: Okay. Do you want jelly or powdered sugar?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I got your message. What, are you and my mother double-teaming me or something?",
        "Dusty: Why don't you sit down?",
        "Emily: Why don't you tell me what's going on?",
        "Dusty: I want to talk to you.",
        "Emily: Talk to me or tell me off?",
        "Dusty: I need you to listen. For once, okay?",
        "Emily: What is it? What's wrong?",
        "Dusty: Craig Montgomery has taken over Worldwide. And I've quit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: This is just a very, very creepy feeling, to look over the last couple of months, thinking I'm making decisions, living my life -- and Craig was manipulating me the whole time.",
        "Meg: Yeah, that is a very creepy feeling.",
        "Lily: All he said was he was just looking for Johnny and Lucy -- but the way he talked to me, the things he said, the way he went after my mother -- it feels a lot more like revenge.",
        "Meg: Yeah, Craig doesn't ever have one reason for doing something.",
        "Lily: He enjoyed it. He enjoyed it, like it was a game.",
        "Meg: Yeah, we're all on his chess board, and he decides the moves.",
        "Lily: I trusted him. I am a fool. I am a fool.",
        "Meg: Lily, you were worried about Faith. You have a family, a new job, a new baby --",
        "Lily: I will not use my family as an excuse.",
        "Meg: No, no, that's not what I mean. Craig just has this -- this genius for sniffing out someone's vulnerability and using it against them.",
        "Lily: Yeah, he wouldn't been able to do that if I -- it's just all my fault. It's all my fault.",
        "Meg: Hey, hey, are you okay?",
        "Lily: To think what I've done to my family. It's Holden.",
        "Meg: Good.",
        "Lily: No, no, this is -- how am I going to face him after everything that I've done?",
        "Holden: It's going to be okay.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I'm so --",
        "Holden: You know what? You got sandbagged, it happens. But I'll tell you this, you and I, we are a lot stronger than Craig Montgomery.",
        "Meg: He's right, you know.",
        "Holden: How's Lucinda taking all this?",
        "Lily: Terrible. She's furious. Furious with me.",
        "Holden: Okay, you know what? I think it's time we start putting this family back together again. I'm going to call your mother.",
        "Lily: No. No, no, no, you can\ufffdt. You can\ufffdt. You can't do it.",
        "Holden: Lily, how many times have you and your mother fought and made up?",
        "Lily: No, please, you can\ufffdt. You can't talk to her. You just can\ufffdt.",
        "Holden: Okay, we don't call Lucinda.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Holden: Not right now. She came down on you pretty hard, huh? Well, of course, she never made any mistakes in her life, right?",
        "Lily: No, my mother has every right to be furious with me. She lost something she has worked her entire life for.",
        "Holden: Lily, your mother and Craig, they've been going at it for years and unfortunately, you got caught in the middle.",
        "Lily: No!",
        "Holden: Yes! In a million years, you would never do anything to hurt a child. You were used and Lucinda, she's kicking you while you're down.",
        "Lily: You don't know why.",
        "Holden: Okay, why? What is it that I don't know?",
        "Meg: Why don't I go see how Faith is doing --?",
        "Lily: No, please stay. Please? Meg has been great while you've been gone. And things haven't gone very well.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know that. Lily, what is it that you're not telling me?",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Lucinda: What are you doing?",
        "Lily: Getting rid of the rest of the pills.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily? What is it?",
        "Meg: Faith started throwing up again.",
        "Holden: Oh, Man. I knew it. I knew I shouldn't have gone.",
        "Meg: I don't think that would have changed anything.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry that I wasn't here. You know what? I need to talk to her.",
        "Lily: No, no, not right now. She's terrified that you're going to be angry with her.",
        "Holden: I'm not angry, just frustrated.",
        "Meg: Well, it looks like the same thing to Faith.",
        "Holden: So, what do we do? I thought we had this under control. What happened?",
        "Meg: This morning, I found her outside of Al's. And she was telling me she wasn't feeling well and then begged me not to tell Lily.",
        "Lily: And then she begged me not to tell you.",
        "Holden: What set it off this time?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Meg: You know, there's been a lot of stress.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "Meg: Ethan was sick. She could have absorbed that.",
        "Holden: I don't understand this. I don't understand why she's doing this. And she's keeping it all a secret.",
        "Lily: I told her she can't do that. I said this family cannot have any secrets.",
        "Faith: Why did you tell them, you fake? Why don't you tell him about yourself?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, you don't want Henry and Vienna to get married, so you've decided you're not going to let them?",
        "Brad: It wouldn't be right.",
        "Katie: You're jealous. Because she dumped you.",
        "Brad: She did not dump me.",
        "Katie: And now she's in love with Henry, so you're jealous.",
        "Brad: Jealous of him? Please. No, I am just worried about the poor girl, okay? It is obvious that she's circling the drain.",
        "Jack: Yes, it's obvious.",
        "Brad: You know, she couldn't have me, so she's marrying him. Can you spell rebound?",
        "Jack: R-e-b-o-u-n-d --",
        "Katie: There have been times, and people, who have thought me self-centered. But you make me look like Mother Teresa.",
        "Brad: I'm just using common sense, Guys. I mean, it's a known fact that you shouldn't make major decisions when you're in mourning.",
        "Katie: Oh, Vienna is mourning the loss of you?",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, I mean, why else you think she would marry that --",
        "Katie: That?",
        "Brad: That --",
        "Katie: That really great, really smart guy, who is giving and loving, and loyal?",
        "Brad: He's a loser.",
        "Katie: All right, you just crossed the line. Some of the things you see are funny, but that was just mean.",
        "Brad: Okay, all right, he's your friend. He's a -- whoa, he's a great guy. You know, but to think what is life will be married to Vienna. She will wear him out and throw him away like yesterday's Prado.",
        "Katie: You mean Prada.",
        "Brad: That's what I said.",
        "Katie: No, what you said is a museum in Madrid.",
        "Brad: Whatever.",
        "Katie: Jack, thank you for telling me about Emma. I will use that as good news to go over and congratulate Vienna and Henry on their marriage.",
        "Brad: Well, you're offering congratulations on a train wreck.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. The better man won. Walk me to my car?",
        "Jack: Sure. What about your meeting?",
        "Katie: Um, I'll tell Brad everything that's going on tomorrow.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Brad: So, how do you stop a train wreck? Get one of the trains off the track.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: We get engaged and this prompts you to buy -- doughnuts?",
        "Henry: I usually get doughnuts when I'm nervous.",
        "Vienna: But why are you nervous? Oh, it's because I proposed, isn't it? Because you're very traditional.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I guess -- I guess that's it.",
        "Vienna: What's more traditional is an engagement ring.",
        "Henry: I'm really sorry. I had no idea that you wanted one.",
        "Vienna: Oh, it's not important. What's more important is that my beloved Henry is unhappy.",
        "Henry: Of course, I'm unhappy. They didn't have any crullers.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not that. You're upset about the fight you had with Katie.",
        "Henry: No, I'm not upset about that. I'm not going to be upset about having a fight with someone that I can't stand. She's egotistical, and arrogant, and selfish. And if you look under selfish under the dictionary, there's a picture of her.",
        "Vienna: Henry, you're not going to be happy until the two of you get this settled.",
        "Henry: I'm not settling anything with her, until she realizes that you and I love one another and belong together.",
        "Vienna: Sweetheart, think about it. Her husband ran away. Her lover ran away. And you're blissfully happy. You know, take the high road. And cut her some slatch.",
        "Henry: Slack. I never expected you to be so generous with Katie.",
        "Vienna: Well, you're in for a lot of surprises. And you know what? We are lucky, Henry. Because we have each other. So, we can afford to be generous and forgiving.",
        "Henry: I think I'm going to buy you a very big ring.",
        "Vienna: You do know, don't you, that I am just being little bit selfish, too, right?",
        "Henry: Selfish?",
        "Vienna: Uh-huh. I want our wedding to be perfect and she's your best friend. Oh, I have it.",
        "Henry: You have what?",
        "Vienna: Ask Katie to be your best man. That will bring that beautiful smile back on your face.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You quit, and now I'm stuck to deal with Craig all alone?",
        "Dusty: I think you can handle it.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'm fired. This is great. You know what, this is just fabulous. Like my life can't any worse than what is already is, and now Montgomery owns me all over again?",
        "Dusty: I told you ahead of time, so you can get your act together.",
        "Emily: Oh, well, thank you. Your concern for me is overwhelming. You cut and run and I got to get my act together?",
        "Dusty: I am concerned about you. So is your mother.",
        "Emily: Okay. Go ahead. Here it comes, here we go --",
        "Dusty: You left town, you didn't tell her where you were.",
        "Emily: Like that's your business?",
        "Dusty: Look, I didn't ask to be your friend. I didn't ask to know the things I know about you.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry I'm such a burden.",
        "Dusty: Oh, it's so classic. You're going to run away? You run away from anybody would could possibly help you?",
        "Emily: You can't help me, okay? Not now.",
        "Dusty: With what? What's wrong with you?",
        "Emily: Nothing, okay? Nothing. You quit. So, just go. I'm fine. I'm just fine.",
        "Dusty: P.S. your mom thinks you left town because you were doing a story on hookers.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but you knew my research was hands on, right?",
        "Dusty: No. I know you quit.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Dusty: But I don't know why.",
        "Emily: You were spying on me?",
        "Dusty: Your mother called me, because she was scared.",
        "Emily: Oh yeah, far be it for you not to help a woman in distress.",
        "Dusty: I ended up having to speak with Cheri.",
        "Emily: Right. And she told you I quit.",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Emily: Great. See, that's terrific. You don't need to worry about me anymore. You saved me from myself. Now you get to quit with a clear conscience.",
        "Dusty: Tell me this isn't about the girl in the movie?",
        "Emily: What difference does it make?",
        "Dusty: Did you go looking for her? Did you find her?",
        "Emily: It's none of your business. Okay, my mother is my mother. I'm stuck with that. I'm stuck with her, but you for the life of me I can't figure out why you give a damn about where I go, or what I do.",
        "Dusty: Well maybe it's because lately you've been making such healthy decisions.",
        "Emily: That's nice. That's nice.",
        "Dusty: I have got to wonder, what possessed you to try to track down a porn star.",
        "Emily: Don't talk like that.",
        "Dusty: Come on what's going on with you?",
        "Emily: None of your business, okay! This is not your business.",
        "Dusty: Do you want to self-destruct?",
        "Emily: Oh, God.",
        "Dusty: What am I doing here? What's the point in talking to you?",
        "Emily: Dusty.",
        "Dusty: You're not worth it. Do you hear me?",
        "Emily: No, Dusty please.",
        "Dusty: You're not worth it!",
        "Emily: Oh thanks. Thanks a lot, Alison.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Emily: Hey, Mom.",
        "Susan: Hey, Mom? You fall off the edge of the earth and that's what I get? Hey mom?",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, work has been crazy, I can't talk.",
        "Susan: You have to. It's about Alison.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You want Katie to be my best man?",
        "Vienna: Yes, she will be adorable. I can see her now, in a little tuxedo, and that little top hat --",
        "Henry: A top hat?",
        "Vienna: And she will have to look after you and the rings, so she won't have time to think about her own failed marriages.",
        "Henry: Yeah, are you sure this is such a good idea?",
        "Vienna: Yes. And a better idea is for you to go out and find her. You need friends, Henry. Not doughnuts.",
        "Henry: I don't know if she'll talk to me. I mean, when I left her she was pretty mad.",
        "Vienna: But you were defending me and that was very sweet. But go and find her and take back everything you said and let her be a part of our happiness.",
        "Henry: Did you order room service?",
        "Vienna: No.",
        "Katie: Vienna, Henry? It's me, Katie.",
        "Vienna: You see? She was just as upset about the fight as you were.",
        "Henry: Hi.",
        "Katie: Hi. Listen, I'm really sorry.",
        "Henry: I'm sorry about what i said. I didn't mean it.",
        "Katie: I really am happy for you.",
        "Henry: You actually sound like you really mean that.",
        "Katie: I do.",
        "Vienna: Katie, how nice of you to drop by, please come in.",
        "Katie: Thank you. I want to start out by saying, congratulations to you because you have nabbed yourself one hell of a husband.",
        "Vienna: Oh, thank you.",
        "Katie: And secondly, I have good news. Jack said that Emma said that you guys could get married at the farm.",
        "Vienna: Oh, that makes us so happy, doesn't it?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, yes it does. Thank you for stopping by.",
        "Katie: Oh, and I know this might be a bad time. If it is, just say so, but I was wondering if -- I thought --",
        "Vienna: You need to spend some time with Henry. You two have a lot to talk about, it's fine. I was just about to soak in a bathtub, so take your time.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Vienna: And take the doughnuts, too. Because Henry is all the temptation I need.",
        "Henry: Ohh. Do you know what you are? You are a decent broad.",
        "Vienna: A decent broad. I like that. Now go and don't forget to ask her you- know-what.",
        "Henry: I'll see what I can do. So, Katie, what do you want to do?",
        "Katie: Well, Henry I don't know, what do you want to do?",
        "Vienna: I managed to make him happy and put her in a man's suit for my wedding. Henry, is that you? Did you forget your keys? You have to --",
        "Brad: Look like you knew I was coming.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Okay listen, I know you're upset, but you can't talk to your mother like that!",
        "Faith: That's not fair.",
        "Holden: No, it's not fair that you yell at her like that when she's trying to help you out. Okay?",
        "Faith: Everything she says is right and everything I say is wrong.",
        "Holden: Okay, we need to try to calm down. Remember what the doctor said --",
        "Faith: Why did she have to tell you about that? I didn't want you to know.",
        "Holden: Honey, I have to know. I'm your father, I have to know so that I can protect you. That's my job.",
        "Faith: You promised.",
        "Meg: No, I didn\ufffdt. I didn't tell to get you in trouble. We want to help you.",
        "Faith: I'm not the one who needs help. I'm not the one who messed everything up.",
        "Holden: Okay, I think that's enough.",
        "Faith: Ask Grandma what's wrong!",
        "Lily: Oh my God.",
        "Holden: What are you talking about?",
        "Faith: You say we can't keep secrets, but you're the one keeping them.",
        "Holden: Faith, stop.",
        "Faith: Ask her about her diet pills.",
        "Holden: The diet pills? I know all about them.",
        "Faith: You do?",
        "Holden: Yes. I know that your mother was taking them and I know that she stopped.",

        "Lily: No.",
        "Holden: Lily, wake up. What Faith needs is two strong parents to make her feel safe and protected. And thanks to you, you two are on an equal footing here. Why should she listen to anything that you have to say when you're just as self-destructive as she is?",
        "Lily: You don't understand, you have no idea what --",
        "Holden: You're right, I don't understand! Because I stood in this kitchen and I watched you throw away those pills. What was that, some sort of performance?",
        "Lily: No, no.",

        "Lily: You have no idea how hard it is.",

        "Holden: So you started up again. And from that second on, everything that you told me, every look that you gave me, was all a lie.",
        "Lily: No, please, I'm so sorry.",
        "Holden: That's why you didn't want to me to call Lucinda. Because Faith was right, she knows. That's funny. She never mentioned anything to me, either. Seems like old times.",
        "Lily: My mother knew. She just found out, she wanted to tell you herself.",
        "Holden: Yeah, no wonder Faith was upset with you. No wonder she might think that you're a little hypocritical.",
        "Lily: Well, maybe I was worried about how you would react. Judgmental --",
        "Holden: When? When did it all start up again?",
        "Lily: Does it really matter at this point?",
        "Holden: Yeah, it does matter! I might want to know if you were a little altered when you went into the baby food biz. Or when we were waiting to find whether or not our son would live or die. Or when you handed your mother's company over to Craig.",
        "Lily: Yes, yes, yes, yes! You're right. I'm a horrible, horrible, worthless person. Are you happy now?",

        "Vienna: Oh, Brad, you have to accept it. But you're sweet and amusing. Henry's what I call the real deal.",
