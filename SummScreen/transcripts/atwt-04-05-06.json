        "Hal: You want me to let Paul out and give him another shot at hurting you?\r\n",
        "Jennifer: Dusty is alive, and Paul knows where he is. ",
        "Hal: Maybe. ",
        "Jennifer: Dad, you follow him, you will find Dusty. ",
        "Hal: And what about the other charges? ",
        "Jennifer: If the murder charge is gone, why can't you just let the rest of it \r\ngo? ",
        "Hal: Honey, it is not that simple. I can't just pick up the phone, call the \r\nD.A. and tell him to let Paul walk. ",
        "Jennifer: Dad, I am begging you to make it simple. Find a way to drop those \r\nother charges and let Paul go. ",
        "----------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emily: This is insane. If they know you didn't kill Dusty, then how can they \r\nkeep you here? ",
        "Paul: Hal is holding me on old charges. ",
        "Emily: How? How is that possible? Where's Jessica? We have to get Jessica to \r\ntalk to him and make him let you go. ",
        "Paul: Hal goes by the book. And the book says that I jumped bail and I \r\ndestroyed hospital records. Unless there's a way for Hal to see Dusty with his \r\nown eyes, Hal is determined to keep me here. ",
        "Emily: He's like a dog with a bone, that man. ",
        "Paul: He just wants proof. Apparently, seeing a mug shot of Dusty in the \r\nnewspapers did not impress him. ",
        "Emily: It was real! I mean, they proved it was real, right? ",
        "Paul: Real, yeah, but not enough for your ex. ",
        "Emily: Well, what more does he need? ",
        "Paul: I know what I need -- I need to leave here and go home with my wife. \r\nAnd start our honeymoon. ",
        "Emily: That's what I want. That's all I want. ",
        "Paul: Yeah? But unless we parade Dusty, alive and kicking, right in front of \r\nHal in his own station house, I'm stuck here for a long, long time. ",
        "-------------------------------------------",
        "Meg: Mama? ",
        "Emma: You didn't answer my call. ",
        "Meg: Oh, I'm sorry. My lawyer called, and then I got sidetracked. ",
        "Emma: What did he want? ",
        "Meg: Well, he had good news. I won't be needing a lawyer much longer. ",
        "Emma: So, are you going to continue staying here at the Lakeview? ",
        "Meg: Yes. ",
        "Emma: How? Well, you're not working. It's his money, isn't it? You're being \r\nkept by Paul Ryan. ",
        "---------------------------------------------",
        "Carly: Hey. Hi, Gwen. ",
        "Gwen: Hey, where's the fire? ",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, I gotta go, something's come up. ",
        "Gwen: I just -- I need to talk to you. ",
        "Carly: I can't right now. I'm sorry, we'll talk later, okay? ",
        "Gwen: Look, it's not gonna -- it's not going to take very long. ",
        "Carly: Look, if you need a place to stay -- ",
        "Gwen: I don't need a place to stay. ",
        "Carly: Then I'm sorry. Whatever it is, I can't help. I have too much on my \r\nown plate right now. ",
        "-------------------------------------------",
        "Jack: What are you doing here? ",
        "Nick: Emma let me in. ",
        "Jack: What, you came by for the pie? ",
        "Nick: It's great pie. ",
        "Jack: Get out. ",
        "Nick: Jack, you saved my life, my job, my reputation. I just wanted to say \r\nthanks. ",
        "Jack: Go to hell. ",
        "--------------------------------------------------",
        "Hal: Moreno, get me an update on that surveillance on 21st street. ",
        "Jennifer: Paul knows more than he is saying. ",
        "Hal: That's what scares me. ",
        "Jennifer: And if you let him go, you can assign a whole team to watch him --\r\n",
        "Hal: Sykes, bring in those witnesses. They're late. ",
        "Jennifer: Would you talk to me? ",
        "Hal: I can't tell you what you want to hear, Jen. ",
        "Jennifer: So then you're just going to give up? ",
        "Hal: I'm not giving up. ",
        "Jennifer: Like you gave up on Johnny. ",
        "Hal: Hey, that was different. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, but you thought I was crazy then. Maybe you think I'm crazy \r\nnow. ",
        "Hal: I don't think you're crazy, Jen, but trusting Paul to help us find Dusty \r\nmight be a little delusional. ",
        "Jennifer: Dad, just follow him. ",
        "Hal: For all we know, he and Meg are still tied into this together. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, then so they'll both lead us to Dusty. ",
        "Hal: You don't buy that they're on the outs? ",
        "Jennifer: I'm not sure. ",
        "Hal: He married Emily. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, I still don't understand that. ",
        "Hal: Jen, go home, take care of Johnny. ",
        "Jennifer: You're angry at me, aren't you? Because I accused you of keeping \r\nPaul in jail for personal reasons. ",
        "Hal: Paul is in jail because he broke the law. Trust me on this. ",
        "Jennifer: Oh, that's so funny, Paul used to say that to me all the time. ",
        "Hal: Don't you compare me to him. ",
        "Jennifer: Dad, Emily is gone, okay? She was crazy to leave you, but she did. \r\nShe doesn't love you anymore. ",
        "Hal: I know that. ",
        "Jennifer: Do you? Or are you just holding on to enough of the good memories \r\nto put aside the fact that she made you miserable? She wants Paul. You can't \r\nchange that. But Dusty is alive and Paul knows where he is. So let him go. \r\nPlease! I need you to love me more than you hate Paul. ",
        "-------------------------------------------------",
        "Paul: You know, I can't stop wishing -- if we could just tell Hal where Dusty \r\nis, Hal could go there and this whole thing would just be over. ",
        "Emily: Oh, God, I wish that were possible. ",
        "Paul: Do you? ",
        "Emily: Why would -- ",
        "Paul: Do you really? ",
        "Emily: Why would you ask me that? ",
        "Paul: I'm just a little frustrated. I'm sorry, I don't mean to take it out on \r\nyou. ",
        "Emily: I just wish -- I wish there was something else I could do. I wish I \r\ncould've tried harder. ",
        "Paul: Come on, like what? ",
        "Emily: I don't know, talk to Hal, maybe. ",
        "Paul: I think that would just make things worse. ",
        "Emily: No, he used to listen to me. ",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, not anymore. I mean, things are different now. And you \r\ncan't trust Hal. Emily, the only people that you and I can trust are one \r\nanother. And that's how it's always been with you and me. It's you and me \r\nagainst the whole world. ",
        "Emily: It still is. ",
        "Paul: That's why you were the only one who understood why I could keep Johnny \r\naway from Jennifer. ",
        "Emily: I know, because -- because you loved her so much. ",
        "Paul: That's right. We don't listen to what anybody else says about what's \r\nright or wrong. We make our own rules. We listen to our own heart about what's \r\nright. ",
        "Emily: Everything I do, I do for you. ",
        "Paul: I know that. ",
        "Emily: Because I love you so much. And when you do something out of love, it \r\ncan never be wrong. Never. ",
        "Paul: Never. ",
        "Emily: I have to talk to you about something. ",
        "Paul: Okay. What? What is it? ",
        "Emily: Just promise me you're gonna understand, okay? ",
        "Paul: Emily, if I can understand why you shot me, and I do, I do, I can \r\nunderstand just about anything. ",
        "Emily: Oh, God, I feel so terrible about this. I'm an awful wife. ",
        "Paul: No. ",
        "Emily: No, I am an awful wife. ",
        "Paul: No, you're not. ",
        "Emily: You are inside this cell, feeling awful, feeling trapped, and here I \r\nam, having my feelings hurt because you said a few things to me. And that is \r\nawful, that is unfair. ",
        "Paul: That's -- ",
        "Emily: I need to stop thinking of myself and start trying to figure out a way \r\nto get you out of this place. ",
        "Paul: That's not what you were going to say. You've got something else on \r\nyour mind, right? ",
        "Emily: Yeah, there's a million things on my mind. There's a million things on \r\nmy mind. My husband is in jail, and my honeymoon is on this perpetual hold. And \r\nthe only people I talk to these days are lawyers. And every time I try praying \r\nto God, he hangs up on me. ",
        "Paul: Okay, I'm sure that God will understand no matter what you've done, \r\nthat it came from a good place. ",
        "Emily: I can't do this. ",
        "Paul: What? ",
        "Emily: There's something I need to go do. ",
        "Paul: We're not done talking. ",
        "Emily: I can\u2019t. I can't talk to you about this. ",
        "Paul: Emily, please, what's going on? ",
        "Emily: Nothing, okay? I just can't -- you know that phrase, \"God helps those \r\nwho help themselves?\" ",
        "Paul: Yeah -- ",
        "Emily: Well, I've gotta give God a little push. I will be back. I love you. \r\nHave faith. ",
        "--------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emma: Meg, the man has been accused of murder. ",
        "Meg: Not anymore. Dusty's alive. That's why my lawyer called. Jessica Griffin \r\ntold Paul that the murder charges were dropped. The police found evidence that \r\nhe's being held somewhere. ",
        "Emma: You mean he's been kidnapped? ",
        "Meg: Whoever it is sent Jennifer a note and a photo. ",
        "Emma: So Paul is free? ",
        "Meg: I don't know. ",
        "Emma: And what about you? Aren't you still under suspicion? ",
        "Meg: I'm not sure. But my lawyer's not worried. ",
        "Emma: But what about Dusty's gloves with your blood on them? ",
        "Meg: Okay, Mama, I can explain that, okay? I found Dusty's wallet at the \r\nparking lot of the wagon wheel motel. ",
        "Emma: You mean that place out by the airport? ",
        "Meg: Yeah, the wallet was covered with blood. I picked it up and that's how \r\nblood ended up on my gloves. ",
        "Emma: And that's what you threw off the bridge? ",
        "Meg: I knew how it would look if anybody found out I had Dusty's wallet, so I \r\npanicked and I just got rid of it. ",
        "Emma: Then why -- why didn't you tell me before? Are you protecting Paul? ",
        "Meg: We were protecting each other. ",
        "Emma: Oh, I see. So, trading in your values, are you? What did it get you? \r\nRoom service in a five star hotel. ",
        "Meg: Paul's innocent. And thanks for not judging me. ",
        "Emma: What do you expect? ",
        "Meg: Benefit of the doubt? Paul didn't buy my silence. It's just complicated.\r\n",
        "Emma: The man is complicated. Look, he is trouble, Meg. He is trouble. Just \r\nstay away from him. ",
        "Barbara: Hello, Emma. ",
        "Emma: Hi, hi. ",
        "Barbara: How are you? ",
        "Emma: Well, a little tired after our ordeal. How about you? ",
        "Barbara: Oh, well, glad to be back home, in spite of our ride back in a \r\npickup truck. Your mother is very resourceful. But I bet you know that, Meg, \r\ndon't you? Well, have a nice day. ",
        "Emma: And how do you think she'd feel if she knew about you and Paul? ",
        "Meg: Paul doesn't talk to his mother. ",
        "Emma: And what does that tell you? ",
        "Meg: He's lucky? ",
        "Emma: Fine. So it's good to be supported by a married man? ",
        "Meg: You know about Emily? ",
        "Emma: What, you didn't expect me to know about that either? ",
        "Meg: Okay, look, Mama, I tried it your way. Okay? I settled down, I had a \r\nhusband, I had a mortgage, but it didn't work for me. ",
        "Emma: Oh, yeah, what works for you? Being supported by a married man? ",
        "Meg: I have felt more alive in the last few months than I ever felt with \r\njosh. I love you, Mama, and I am so sorry you don't approve, but you don't know \r\nPaul the way I do. I have to go. ",
        "Emma: Where are you going? ",
        "Meg: You don't want to know. ",
        "---------------------------------------------------------",
        "Casey: So, did you decide on a name yet? ",
        "Lisa: I'm going to call it \"Crash.\" And you make sure that you pick music for \r\neveryone's tastes, not just yours. ",
        "Casey: I will. Gwen helped me come up with some crossover tracks. We should \r\nbe fine. ",
        "Barbara: And no one knows about crossing the tracks like Gwen. ",
        "Lisa: Hi there, Barbara. ",
        "Barbara: Hello, don't let me interrupt. ",
        "Casey: Hello, Ms. Ryan. ",
        "Barbara: Hello. I didn't realize that you and Gwen were still friends. ",
        "Lisa: I think I should nip this interrogation in the bud. ",
        "Barbara: It's just a friendly question. ",
        "Lisa: Casey's gonna be my deejay in my new club. ",
        "Barbara: Well, that's very exciting. And now I understand why you were asking \r\nGwen for advice. I understand she's rather musically inclined. ",
        "Casey: Yes, she is. I caught her band in Bay City about a year ago. The Itty \r\nBitty Kitty Krew. ",
        "Barbara: Catchy. ",
        "Casey: Yeah. Well, Grandma, I'm going to pick that music up before I go to \r\nthe library. Good seeing you. ",
        "Lisa: Good seeing you. ",
        "Casey: Ms. Ryan. ",
        "Barbara: Nice catching up with you, Casey. ",
        "Lisa: Well, honey, I must say you were almost civil where Gwen was concerned.\r\n",
        "Barbara: Oh, I'm trying. ",
        "Lisa: I know. I think that's wonderful. If I had known that a run-in with a \r\nbear would change your attitude, I would have taken you to the zoo a long time \r\nago. ",
        "[Both laughing] ",
        "Barbara: I'm trying to be supportive. ",
        "Lisa: Supportive enough to give Will his trust fund? ",
        "Barbara: If and when he graduates high school, yes. What are you looking at?\r\n",
        "Lisa: I was just looking to see if any pigs got stuck in the chandeliers as \r\nthey were flying through. ",
        "Barbara: Are we going shopping or what? ",
        "Lisa: Yes, we are. I want to find out where this change of heart comes from.\r\n",
        "Barbara: Okay, come on, you. Here we go. ",
        "------------------------------------------------",
        "Jack: You still here? ",
        "Nick: Jack, everything worked out for me because of you. ",
        "Jack: Well, I got to the truth, Nick. That's what a good cop does. ",
        "Nick: Well, just for the record, Carly hated working at that club. ",
        "Jack: Don\u2019t. ",
        "Nick: Every second. ",
        "Jack: Never stopped her. ",
        "Nick: All right, we don't have to talk about Carly. But what about work? ",
        "Jack: What about it? ",
        "Nick: You and I can get assigned to another case together. ",
        "Jack: I'll handle it. ",
        "Nick: I need more than that. ",
        "Jack: You came to the Lakeview to have sex with my wife. That's how that \r\nnight started. Were you hoping I'd forget about that? ",
        "Nick: It wasn't personal. ",
        "Jack: It wasn't personal? ",
        "Nick: You know what I meant. ",
        "Jack: Walking out of my house was personal. Telling my kids I was leaving was \r\npersonal. So don't come in here, put out your hand and expect forgiveness. I \r\ndon't want your damn thanks or your worthless apology. I'll work with you, Nick. \r\nI'll have your back on the job, but don't expect me to like it. ",
        "----------------------------------------------",
        "Gwen: Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. What's going on? ",
        "Carly: It's Jack. ",
        "Gwen: Yeah, what's wrong with Jack? ",
        "Carly: I can't do this right now. I can't talk to you right now, all right? \r\nI'm sorry. ",
        "Gwen: So am I. ",
        "-------------------------------------------------------",
        "Maddie: Where were you? ",
        "Will: I clocking a little overtime at work. ",
        "Maddie: Well, maybe you should clock a little overtime in Calculus. You're \r\nthree chapters behind. ",
        "Will: Okay, all right, I got it. ",
        "Maddie: Did you review? ",
        "Will: Yes, Mother. ",
        "Maddie: I'm serious. The problems on the exam are going to be a lot tougher \r\nand this exam is 80% of your final grade. ",
        "Will: 80%, are you sure? ",
        "Maddie: Positive. So, if you tank this one, buddy, you don't pass Calculus. \r\nAnd if you don't pass Calculus, you don't graduate. ",
        "-------------------------------------------------",
        "Hal: I'm sorry, Jen, letting Paul walk is not an option. ",
        "Jennifer: Leaving Dusty out there to die is not an option. ",
        "Hal: Jennifer, Paul was Craig\u2019s accessory after the fact. When he kept Johnny \r\nfrom you, it made him a kidnapper -- that is a felony. ",
        "Jennifer: But if I don't testify to his lies, if I don't go to court -- ",
        "Hal: Hey, you made your statement to the D.A. ",
        "Jennifer: I can change my statement. ",
        "Hal: Think about what you're saying. ",
        "\u00a0Jennifer: What I'm saying, Dad, is that I'm not gonna lift a finger to put \r\nPaul away. And Emily is his wife now, so she doesn't have to testify either and \r\nwithout us, your case falls apart. You want to play hardball, Dad? I'm playing \r\nhardball. ",
        "------------------------------------------------------",
        "Emily: I ordered chipped beef? ",
        "Dusty: You gotta let me go. ",
        "Emily: What, are you kidding me? And miss the blue plate special? ",
        "Dusty: What happened with the photo? ",
        "Emily: Relax. Your precious Jennifer knows you're alive. ",
        "Dusty: And what about your little Pauly boy? ",
        "Emily: What about him? ",
        "Dusty: Well, did he get out of jail? ",
        "Emily: No. No, Hal wouldn't let go of the old charges. I swear to God, the \r\nman would give him the death penalty for jaywalking if he could get away with \r\nit.",
        "Dusty: I think it's time for my help. ",
        "Emily: You? ",
        "Dusty: You need a plan. You don't have one. ",
        "Emily: I have a plan, thank you very much. ",
        "Dusty: Ransom? ",
        "Emily: No, Dusty, I don't think you're worth anything. ",
        "Dusty: Oh, really? Tell me, where are you going from here? ",
        "Emily: Shut up. Okay. Just shut your mouth and eat! ",
        "Dusty: This'll all go away. Do you understand me? Do you understand what I'm \r\nsaying? I can get you out of this whole mess! ",
        "-----------------------------------------",
        "Nick: I'm not proud of what I did. ",
        "Jack: Is that supposed to make me feel better, Nick? ",
        "Nick: Jack, what do you want me to say? I learned a lesson. I'm sorry I went \r\nfor the bait. ",
        "Jack: \"The bait\" was my wife, the mother of my kids. ",
        "Nick: Yeah, I know and I should've thought of that. Maybe the reason why I \r\ndidn't was because I never had a Carly. Or a family like yours. But I'll tell \r\nyou one thing, Jack, she never wanted me. ",
        "Jack: You wanted her though, right? That's why you showed up. ",
        "Nick: And I was wrong. ",
        "Jack: Whatever. Just stay the hell away from me. ",
        "Nick: It's a small squad room. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, remember that the next time you hit on another guy's wife. They \r\nmight not let you off so easy. ",
        "Nick: Jack, I'll go. Come on, you stay. ",
        "Jack: No, you stay, finish your pie. This time, clean up after yourself for a \r\nchange. ",

        "Jack: No, Carly -- ",
        "Carly: I will get on my knees! ",
        "Jack: Carly, get up! ",
        "Carly: Tell me what you want! ",
        "Paul: Jessica got the murder charges dropped, and Jennifer won't cooperate \r\nwith any of the other charges -- I'm released. ",

        "Jennifer: Hi. Could I talk to my brother alone, please? ",
        "Cop #4: I'm sorry, Lieutenant Munson made it very -- ",
        "Paul: He's got me on a very short leash. ",
        "Cop #4: All right. ",
        "Paul: You okay? ",
        "Jennifer: No, you? ",
        "Paul: Like you care? ",
        "Jennifer: Oddly enough. ",
        "Paul: Since when? ",
        "Jennifer: You know, I'm confused, Paul. ",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I'm a confusing guy. ",
        "Jennifer: No, don't do that. ",
        "Paul: Sorry. ",
        "Jennifer: Do you love me? It's a simple question. Do you love me? ",
        "Paul: Since the day you were born. ",
        "Jennifer: You know, when I was -- when I was in fifth grade, I had to write \r\nthis essay about who my favorite hero was. And everyone thought, of course, that \r\nI would pick my father, the cop. But I didn\u2019t. I chose you, and you want to know \r\nwhy? Because when I came to you and said that I wanted to be a ballerina, you \r\nsaid, \"good for you, Jen. Go for it.\" And the first time that I had my heart \r\nbroken, you were there with flowers and a box of tissues. And today, I just \r\nstarted thinking, trying to figure out why you changed. And then I realized \r\nsomething. ",
        "Paul: What? ",
        "Jennifer: The way that you see it, you haven't change at all. The second that \r\nyou knew Johnny was alive, that you decided you weren't gonna tell me, you \r\nthought you were still being my hero. You thought that it was okay, that you \r\nwere keeping me safe -- from Craig. ",
        "Paul: Jennifer, look, I've given up trying to get people to understand what \r\nI've done. ",
        "Jennifer: But that's the thing, Paul. I think I finally do understand. ",
        "Paul: Kind of sudden, don't you think? I mean, a few minutes ago you were \r\nripping into me, accusing me of knowing where Dusty was. ",
        "Jennifer: I was scared. I still am. But I thought about what you said, Paul. \r\nAnd I -- I believe you. I have to believe you because the one thing that I have \r\nfeared most in my life is starting to happen to me. ",
        "Paul: What? I don't understand. What's starting to happen? ",
        "Jennifer: Do you remember the day that I told you to move far away? ",
        "Paul: Yes, of course I remember. ",
        "Jennifer: I was afraid that having you around would remind me of what \r\nhappened to Johnny, and I didn't want to end up going to that dark place where I \r\nwould be unfit to raise my own son. ",
        "Paul: Oh, never. You're too good of a mother to ever be unfit. ",
        "Jennifer: So was our mother, a long time ago. We know what bitterness can do \r\nto people. That's why I -- I know that you can't go, so I have to let go of the \r\nanger, for Johnny. ",
        "Paul: On my life, I had nothing to do with Dusty's disappearance. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, I hope that's true. But whether it is or not, I have to stop \r\nhating you. That's why I told my father that I will not cooperate with his case. \r\nAnd without me, he has no way of convicting you. So, you're free, Paul. And now, \r\nfinally, so am I. ",

        "Emily: I don't want to put a gag in your mouth -- just shut up! ",
        "Dusty: I'm just asking you, how long since things have been normal for you? \r\nHuh? And if you ever want to get back to that, you gotta start thinking to \r\nyourself really serious -- what the hell are you gonna do with me? Okay? They \r\nknow I'm alive now. They're gonna step up the search. And believe me, you don't \r\nwant them to find me like this, all right? ",
        "Emily: Okay, so what am I supposed to do? Release you and everything will be \r\nhunky dory? ",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, I told -- I told you, I'm gonna keep you out of it. I can \r\ntell Hal that, you know, I got picked up by a old Chicago connection and I got \r\naway. ",
        "Emily: Picked up for what? ",
        "Dusty: Bad debt, bad woman. I don't know, whatever. ",

C -- Does Carly let Jack know where she's gonna be in \r\ncase of an emergency? Or D -- is Carly secretly planning to blow up the speed \r\nbump for Jack's own good? ",

Have you noticed that in her house, she's got them in every bedroom, \r\nshe's got them in the hallway, downstairs, everywhere. So, whenever I was \r\nreading the paper and I saw that there was gonna be an auction or maybe a yard \r\nsale, I'd call her up and I'd say, \"you think we could get together on some \r\nprices on this.\" So, honey, if you want my advice, try to get inside Gwen\u2019s head \r\nand find out what she likes. ",
        "Barbara: Lisa, you are a genius. I know exactly what I want to do for Gwen, \r\nbut I'm gonna need your help. I'm gonna need a big favor if I'm gonna be able to \r\npull this one off. ",

        "Will: So, you told her that you were having problems? ",
        "Gwen: No, I wanted to tell her that we got married. She just assumed that I \r\ncame to cry on her shoulder, which is bad enough. But then she couldn't even \r\nlisten when I tried to explain. ",
