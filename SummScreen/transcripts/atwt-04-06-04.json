        "Pilar continued to play head games with Mike. She sent Russ to fetch food. He went to the diner \u0096 and Henry recognized him from an artists' drawing Katie had commissioned. Henry followed Russ back to the motel where Pilar is staying. While Henry is trying to find a phone to call Katie, Mike arrived to bring Pilar back to his house. Henry got Katie to the motel. She arrived with a camera. As Mike and Pilar left the room \u0096 Katie snapped their picture. Jessica told Bonnie that Sarah could not move to Florida with her. Later she overheard Sarah and Bonnie talking and changed her mind. She knew Bonnie and Sarah belonged together.",
        "Lily had visions of Rose \u0096 who told her she should keep on singing. Dusty said he had to pick up a check for the foundation in Chicago the next day. Lily volunteered to go in his place \u0096 because of Rose's advice. Carly told Jack she was not in business with Paul anymore. Jack was disappointed she let Rosanna force her into that decision. Craig picked up the box of items from the New York pawnshop and found everything was not there. He went to the Lakeview to talk to Jack and Carly about the box. He wondered why Rosanna would hire someone to steal Cabot's silver comb and brush set."

        "Pilar: And that would be number seven. \"Pilar, it's Mike. Call me.\"",
        "Russ: He's gonna get sick of your games and stop playing. Call the man back.",
        "Pilar: I'm starving. And since this dump doesn't have room service, you'll have to make a food run.",
        "Russ: Oh, that's not my job.",
        "Pilar: Oh no? What do you think your job is, exactly?",
        "Russ: To threaten you so this chump Mike comes running to the rescue, isn't that what I'm getting paid for?",
        "Pilar: You get paid if I need you. And, you know what, Russ? I'm starting to wonder if I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Yes! Oh my god, that's him. That is amazing. How can I ever repay you?",
        "Sketch artist: Fifty bucks is the usual fee.",
        "Katie: Henry.",
        "Henry: What? Katie, that's, like, five martinis plus tip!",
        "Katie: I'll pay you back.",
        "Henry: All right. All right. Here you go, my good man.",
        "Katie: Thank you. All right. All we have to do now is show this around and find out if anyone has recognized Pilar's new friend.",
        "Henry: Right. Let's say we find someone who has seen this man talking to Pilar. What then, Katie? Hmm? Do we find out if he's a good conversationalist?",
        "Katie: We find out where he lives. Then we stake out the place.",
        "Henry: And we stake it out because --",
        "Katie: Because sooner or later, Pilar's going to show up there. And that way I can prove to Mike that whatever she's cooking up, they're in on it together",
        "Henry: You know, I can't believe I spent $50 -- and broke my diet before I remembered.",
        "Katie: Remembered what?",
        "Henry: That you are so obsessed with Mike Kasnoff that it is driving you crazy. Baby, give up the chase. You're running for all the wrong reasons.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We did great today, sweetheart.",
        "Lily: Sorry, I took so long. Holden had to relieve the babysitter, and we couldn't stop talking about tonight and how great it was. He was so pleased for us.",
        "Dusty: He should be. You were great.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: It's just unbelievable. I couldn't -- I couldn't believe you sang like that.",
        "Lily: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: Rose would be real proud.",
        "Lily: She was. When I was singing on that stage tonight -- it was like the two of us were together again. Can I tell you a secret?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Something happened to me tonight.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah?",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Mike: Hey. Did this woman come in here tonight?",
        "Lily: Pilar? Is she back in town?",
        "Mike: Long story. Have you seen her?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Mike: Well, if either of you do, call me, any time. It's very important.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Dusty: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It's great having Bonnie home, isn't it? I feel like we haven't stopped talking for five minutes since we found her here. Sarah, honey -- I know it feels like bad times are going to go on forever, but they do pass. Remember that, okay?",
        "Sarah: Yeah, I know. I just -- I wish Bonnie weren't moving so far away.",
        "Bonnie: Mom? Any idea where the rest of my clothes are?",
        "Sarah: Some of them are in my room.",
        "Bonnie: Well, see, there I go. Payback for all the times I've raided your closet. You come with me. Help me find some of my stuff.",
        "Sarah: Okay.",
        "Jessica: How did this happen?",
        "Ben: I hope you've been keeping that cobbler hot -- 'cause it's gonna be sick when I put this ice cream -- hey, baby, what's wrong.",
        "Jessica: I told you Bonnie wants to take Sarah to Miami? Well, I've realized, I can't let her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Thank you. So, we missed the charity event of the season --",
        "Jack: I'm really sorry about that. I thought that stakeout would wrap up sooner.",
        "Carly: That's okay. Now, we'll just have to give to a charity of our choice.",
        "Jack: Any suggestions?",
        "Carly: Well, I did hear about this poor, unfortunate housewife who rarely gets out and whose husband works way too much.",
        "Jack: Sounds like just the kind of gal I'd like to give my donation to. Did you tell the sitter we'd be home late?",
        "Carly: Of course.",
        "Jack: To be honest, the whole poor housewife stuff doesn't exactly hold water when it's coming from a talented designer who's about to be a star.",
        "Carly: About that job with Paul -- I quit.",
        "Jack: No, no -- honey, not because of what Rosanna said?",
        "Carly: No, it wasn't just that. I was already getting so bogged down, and really starting to miss you and miss the kids.",
        "Jack: No, I'm not buyin' it. At all. This is about the ultimatum you got from your sister. Isn't it?",
        "Carly: Paul is the major reason that she lost Cabot.",
        "Jack: Okay, and that's a tragedy. I'm with you there. But Rosanna doesn't get to make you choose between her and your career!",
        "Carly: I can hardly look at the guy, knowing what I know. Working with him is out of the question.",
        "Jack: If that's your choice, fine. All right. But you know what? Let's just make sure.",
        "Carly: No, who are you calling?",
        "Jack: Your sister has a lot of questions to answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Georgian teapot with silver filigree -- what the -- when is Detective Snyder going to be finished with that stakeout?",
        "Cop: He finished about an hour ago.",
        "Craig: So he'll be back any minute?",
        "Cop: He's off-duty.",
        "Craig: Wait! Is this everything from that pawn shop in New York? There are things missing. And I want to know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: She's back in Oakdale? She and Mike used to --",
        "Mike: Were old friends. I just heard she's back in town. I'm trying to track her down.",
        "Carly: How come? She owe you money?",
        "Mike: Later.",
        "Carly: Hey, Mike -- is everything okay?",
        "Mike: Yeah, come on -- you're letting that good champagne go flat.",
        "Carly: What was that all about?",
        "Jack: Who knows? Do you want another drink? 'Cause these are kinda flat.",
        "Carly: Yeah. No, I do in a minute. After you answer my question. How come you were so upset that Rosanna asked me to choose between her and Paul? And how come, yesterday, you told me not to make that choice? You're afraid.",
        "Jack: Of what?",
        "Carly: That if Paul doesn't bankroll me, Rosanna will.",
        "Jack: She did give you a check.",
        "Carly: A check which, clearly, you don't want me to cash.",
        "Jack: Darling, if you cash that check, it'll mean that she's the boss and you owe her. Do you really want Rosanna to have that much control over you?",
        "Carly: She's not going to try to control me.",
        "Jack: She already is! And you're letting her out of sisterly loyalty. Well, guess what? I've got some loyalties of my own, and they're all to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: They're not in the box.",
        "Cop: I don't know what to tell you.",
        "Craig: Well, I know who does. The guy who broke into my home. Go downstairs, get Di Grassi out of his cell and bring him upstairs so I can find out what happened to the items missing from my box!",
        "Cop: Di Grassi's long gone.",
        "Craig: He was released? Margo!",
        "Cop: Detective Hughes isn't here either.",
        "Craig: What? What is going on?! Hey, hey --",
        "Mike: Margo here?",
        "Craig: No! Margo's not here, Jack's not here, there's crime all over the streets, 'cause nobody wants to work overtime.",
        "Mike: Hey, if Jack wants to take his wife to Lakeview, it's none of your business.",
        "Craig: Lakeview? Thank you.",
        "Mike: Craig. Oh! Sorry about that, Jack.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: I promised Bonnie, when she went to jail, that I would take care of that little girl.",
        "Ben: Baby, baby -- Bonnie is out of prison. And she's moving to Miami.",
        "Jessica: And she can't take Sarah with her. It's just not good for Sarah, for Bonnie, for Isaac --",
        "Ben: Well, it sounds like you've made up your mind on this.",
        "Jessica: I have. I just wish I knew how to tell Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Tell me what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Call mike.",
        "Katie: And say what?",
        "Henry: You want him back.",
        "Katie: Get it through your head. I am just trying to protect someone I care about. Period. Pilar is out to hurt Mike and I'm not just going to be like that woman in France who, while everybody was getting their heads chopped off, just sat around with a couple of knitting needles and a ball of yarn!",
        "Henry: Why Katherine, I had no idea that your interest in Mike had such historical resonance.",
        "Katie: You're humoring me. First Margo, now you -- I thought you would at least understand.",
        "Henry: Bubbles, bubbles -- let's see what this guy would look like with an eye patch. Hello.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna just wants a show of support, that's all, a little solidarity.",
        "Jack: Honey, ever since I've known you, you've two dreams. Two major dreams -- to be a fashion designer and to have a happy family. Now, your sister has bullied you out of one by threatening the other.",
        "Carly: I can still have a career. If I cash her check. And I don't necessarily have to owe her anything. I plan on making enough money to pay her back. The only trouble is --",
        "Jack: Is what?",
        "Carly: I'm not even sure that she wants me to cash the check anymore.",
        "Jack: See? Honey, she's got you coming and going.",
        "Carly: Well, you're not helping, Jack! You hated it when I started working with Paul, and now that I've quit --",
        "Jack: I'll take Paul over this. At least I know what he's up to.",
        "Carly: A-ha! You see that? I knew there was something more going on. Tell me! Why do you think that Rosanna has some kind of secret agenda?",
        "Craig: That is the question, isn't it? And the answer begins with this box.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I think I know what it is you want to talk to me about, mom.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie --",
        "Bonnie: It's about Sarah, isn't it? You don't want me to take her to Miami.",
        "Jessica: It's more complicated than that, sweetheart. I just -- no, I don't want you to take her to Miami.",
        "Bonnie: Why, mom?",
        "Jessica: Because, sweetheart, you and Isaac need time together. Just the two of you.",
        "Bonnie: We've talked about that --",
        "Jessica: And you need to get to know each other again. A newlywed couple just needs time together --",
        "Bonnie: You love her. That's why you don't want Sarah to go with me. Because something happened that you didn't expect.",
        "Jessica: That is not the reason.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, come on, mom, it's okay. I know better than anyone how easy it is to love Sarah. That's why I wasn't worried about Isaac. Because I knew he would love her just as much as I do.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, Sarah is very fragile. And strong. Which is one of the things about that child. She's full of paradoxes.",
        "Bonnie: Too bad you don't love her.",
        "Jessica: I have grown very fond of Sarah. I mean, there's something very endearing about her. Even when she's so stubborn you just want to strangle her.",
        "Bonnie: She sounds like me at that age.",
        "Jessica: Okay. Okay, you win. But I really just want what's best for her. And I think that means her staying here with me and Ben.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Five thousand.",
        "Dusty: Fantastic. Next.",
        "Dusty: Lil? Lil? Where are you right now?",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Dusty: You want to take a break? I'll finish up here. It's been a long night.",
        "Lily: Oh, no, no, no. I was just -- just thinking.",
        "Dusty: About what?",
        "Lily: Being on stage.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Yeah, you were saying it was like Rose was up there with you.",
        "Lily: It's pretty intense. It's a little woo-woo.",
        "Dusty: Woo-woo, huh?",
        "Lily: All right. When I was singing -- onstage -- it was the first time since Rose died that I wasn't terrified that her memory was going to leave. It was like we were singing a duet. I knew she would never leave me. Okay, should we call Dr. Michaels, 911?",
        "Dusty: No, we're not calling Dr. Michaels. You know what I think? I think you're a great singer. I think Rose wouldn't just have you singing in charity events, now and then. I think she'd have you singing all the time.",
        "Lily: What do you mean? It's a little late for me to join show biz.",
        "Dusty: You think?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: I think you're a great singer. I think you should think about it. I'm going to put these things in the safe deposit box, and then I'm going to drive you home. Okay?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Rose: He's right, Tiger Lily. What's stopping you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Come on, Katie, the game's afoot!",
        "Katie: \"Stay put. I'll call. -- Henry\" how are you going to do that? I have your phone.",

        "Mike: Hello?",
        "Pilar: Mike!",
        "Mike: Where are you, Pilar?",
        "Pilar: I just wanted to tell you -- I'm safe. And I'm sorry. You're a good man. Too good to be involved in my messy life.",
        "Mike: Tell me where you are.",
        "Pilar: It doesn't matter.",
        "Mike: It does to me. You say you're safe, I want some proof.",
        "Pilar: I'm at a motel.",
        "Mike: Which one?",
        "Pilar: Don't press me, Mike. Just stay away.",
        "Mike: Pilar? Come on, damnit! A motel. All right, she's at a motel.",
        "Katie: Mike?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Mike! All right. I have such a talent at making men disappear. Can you add a big sundae to that, with everything on it? I think it's gonna be a long night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: This is supposed to be fast food.",
        "Russ: Well, I'm sick of fast food. The guy at the front desk told me to try a place called Al's diner.",
        "Pilar: Not bad.",
        "Russ: What happened with Kasnoff?",
        "Pilar: I called him. He's probably on his way right now, so don't get too comfortable. When he knocks on that door, you're out of here. And maybe you shouldn't bother coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: Sure I've seen him.",
        "Henry: You have? What's his name?",
        "Manager: Don't know. Room's not registered under his name.",
        "Henry: All right. Whose, then? A woman named Pilar Domingo?",
        "Manager: You have a nice day, ya hear?",
        "Henry: Oh, ye of little brain, thank you. Wait'll Katie hears this. Damn it! Where's my phone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Russ: Don't get cute, Pilar. You want to make it to the finish line with this, you're going to need me.",
        "Pilar: Relax, Russ, I don't want to fight. We're on to a good thing, so let's not blow it.",
        "Russ: What's the matter? Thought Mikey-boy would be here by now? Maybe he decided you aren't worth saddling up the white horse for.",
        "Mike: Pilar!",
        "Pilar: He's here! Go!",
        "Russ: No, wait a minute!",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: You were great up on that stage, tonight. You should do it again.",
        "Lily: I'm not an entertainer like you. There was a time that I thought \"maybe,\" but -- no, my singing days are over.",
        "Rose: Says who?",
        "Lily: I can't be here with you. Holden thought I was losing my mind. He's just starting to trust me again.",
        "Rose: I'm not here to start trouble. I just want what's best for you.",
        "Lily: You were best for me. But you're dead and I cannot afford to live some fantasy life -- conjuring you up like this.",
        "Rose: No, you're not conjuring me up. I'm with you because I belong here, with you. Always.",
        "Lily: When you're here with me, like this -- it feels great. I feel at peace. That's how I felt on stage tonight, at peace.",
        "Rose: That was because you were listening to that voice inside of you. That voice was telling you that you needed to be up there, singing. And you did it. You were free.",
        "Lily: I haven't felt that since -- I can't even remember.",
        "Rose: So, how long before you let yourself feel that way again, Lily?",
        "Lily: I can't -- no, I can't announce to my husband and my children that I'm starting a singing career.",
        "Rose: Why not? Life is not about pickin' one thing or the other. It's taking all the things that you love. Like, you know, Holden and your babies and Emma's cooking and -- what are the other things that we love?",
        "Lily: Anything chocolate --",
        "Rose: Cold champagne --",
        "Lily: Rainy days --",
        "Rose: Jumping in puddles --",
        "Lily: Riding my horse --",
        "Rose: And singing --",
        "Lily: And singing.",
        "Rose: Whatever it is. Lily, if you love it, you do it now. Now, while you can. While you're alive.",
        "Lily: Rose?",
        "Dusty: Okay, I'm done. Let's lock up and get out of here.",
        "Lily: Okay, I'll just get my things.",

        "Carly: What is in this box, exactly?",
        "Craig: Some of the things that were stolen from our house. Some, but not all.",
        "Carly: And what does Rosanna have to do with that?",
        "Craig: That's what I want to find out.",
        "Jack: Can you say \"third wheel?\"",
        "Craig: In several languages, Jack. If you think your date with your wife is more important than the fact that her sister is in real trouble, then you've got another think coming.",
        "Carly: Trouble? What is it that you're not telling me?",
        "Craig: Jack dropped the charges against Di Grassi, the man who broke into Fairwinds",
        "Jack: We couldn't keep him in custody!",
        "Craig: Tell her why, Jack.",
        "Jack: Rosanna had him sprung.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: She said that Di Grassi was an old family friend who had gone bad. She didn't want to charge him. I wanted to hold him! But you know Rosanna. She's got a whole team of lawyers working overtime. She probably had one of them put the squeeze on somebody. The next thing I knew, he was out of my hands.",
        "Craig: Why? Why would she put herself out to put a guy like that on the street?",
        "Carly: Well, he's not an old friend, that's for sure.",
        "Craig: She's out of control. First she disappears, then she sticks up for a guy like that. These last two items are the only things missing from that box.",
        "Carly: Cabot's silver comb and brush set?",
        "Craig: Yes, I kept them to remember him. They were stolen from the house, but they're not in the box.",
        "Jack: You really think Rosanna has them?",
        "Carly: Well, if she does, she has every right. They belonged to her son!",
        "Craig: He was my son, too. They were in our house. But, if she had to hire somebody to steal those memories of Cabot, I want to know why!",
        "Jack: What are you saying, Craig?",
        "Craig: I'm saying that Rosanna and Di Grassi are working together somehow.",
        "Jack: Are you're accusing her of receiving stolen goods from him?",
        "Carly: Don't even think about pressing charges!",
        "Craig: You are missing the point!",
        "Carly: Am I? Or are you trying to find a little leverage? Trying to figure out a way to keep Rosanna from divorcing you?",
        "Craig: I'm trying to find out what she wants.",
        "Jack: She wants -- she wants her kid back! And if she can't have him, she'll settle for souvenirs. Look, I'm going to make a phone call. When I get back, you, your box and your theories had better be gone.",
        "Carly: He gets a little edgy when the subject of Cabot comes up. Reminds him of how he lost J.J.",
        "Craig: At least he didn't lose you, too. Did he? Okay, I've lost my whole family. Lucy wants nothing to do with me. Rosanna is -- is a different person. She's cold. She's bitter. When she came back, I barely said hello. She handed me divorce papers.",
        "Carly: You can't blame her, Craig. It's because of you. It's because of you and your lies that she lost her child.",

        "Bonnie: I know, but it wouldn't be fair if I broke my promise to Isaac either, now would it? But can I tell you that the first thing we're going to do when I get to Miami is find a two-bedroom house, so that when school's out you can come and visit and have your own room.",
