        "Henry: We had seven minutes left on that meter. I don't know what that meter maid was lurking around there for, anyway.",
        "Katie: Well, maybe she saw a limo parked with the windows all steamed up and got a little curious. That was really embarrassing.",
        "Henry: What do we have to be embarrassed about? We're lawfully married. You want to give it another try? I'm sure we can find someplace private to park.",
        "Katie: Look, Henry, it is officially your first day at work. Maybe you should think about working a little bit.",
        "Henry: I am working, I am working. I'm waiting for my first assignment. My beeper is ready, I'm ready. I don't know. Honey, want to give it another try here?",
        "Katie: I think I need to think about work, too. We need to sell some more memberships or this whole thing is gonna go down the tubes.",
        "Casey: Hey, Katie, are we the only ones here?",
        "Katie: For what?",
        "Celia: The free trial.",
        "Katie: Free trial?",
        "Casey: Yeah, there were a bunch of these posted up around our school. Oh, this is my friend, Celia, by the way. Celia, this is my Aunt Katie and her husband, Henry Coleman.",
        "Celia: Hi, nice to meet you.",
        "Katie: Nice to meet you too.",
        "Henry: How are you?",
        "Katie: Is there something you need to tell me about?",
        "Henry: Well, you know, I was going to the interview for the limo job, and I put up a few flyers. I ouought it might bring in some customers.",
        "Katie: You are brilliant.",
        "Henry: I know. I am, aren't I?",
        "Casey: Yeah, this free trial thing is a great idea. Everyone's gonna want to check it out. So, can we get a tour before you get too crowded?",
        "Henry: Absolutely, you bet.",
        "Casey: Hey, Will. You here for the free trial too?",
        "Celia: Mr. Coleman was just about to give us a tour.",
        "Will: Do you mind if I just look around?",
        "Katie: Sure.",
        "Celia: He didn't even look at us. What is wrong with him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Wait, wait, hold on. I'm supposed to believe that you want to help my mom now?",
        "Keith: Well, you don't believe that your mom killed my sister. Do you?",
        "Luke: No, my mom wouldn't kill anybody, ever. I keep saying that, but nobody listens.",
        "Keith: Well, I'm listening, and I want to hear more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Lily? Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. Oh, oh, oh. It's gonna be all right.",
        "Lily: No, it's not, but I'm glad you're here. Thank you.",
        "Sierra: I'm surprised the police let me in to see you.",
        "Lily: Oh, they're a little lax with the rules, you know, with Mother, and I'm a very cooperative prisoner.",
        "Sierra: Because you're pleading guilty?",
        "Lily: And I'm not going to change my mind. So, please, I hope that's not why you're here.",
        "Sierra: Well, if Mother didn't turn you around, I don't suppose I stand a chance.",
        "Lily: She tried to have me declared mentally incompetent and that didn't work. So she brought Faith and Natalie here to see me.",
        "Sierra: Oh, that must've been so difficult.",
        "Lily: It was, but it was great too, holding them, kissing them and hugging them. I don't know if I'll ever get to do that again.",
        "Sierra: Well, you could very soon if you don't plead guilty.",
        "Lily: I have to, okay? Sierra, I just have to.",
        "Sierra: Well, what does Jessica say?",
        "Lily: Once I'm sentenced I'll probably see the girls and Luke about once a month.",
        "Sierra: That's not very much.",
        "Lily: I'll be a complete stranger to them, and Natalie's already changed so much. I mean, how do you raise children from prison?",
        "Sierra: Gosh, I really wish I could make this better for you.",
        "Lily: Actually, you can. Actually, there is a way that you can make things a lot better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: The guy's playing with your mind, Jen, and you're lettin' him.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, I'm pregnant!",
        "Dusty: You should've said so. I'll send you and Mike some champagne.",
        "Jennifer: It's not Mike's. Hi. I didn't see you there.",
        "Mike: Is it true?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know what to say.",
        "Mike: You don't have to say anything. Craig's the one who has to answer for this, if I don't kill him first.",
        "Jennifer: I am furious with Craig, and you know that, but in fairness, this isn't all his fault.",
        "Mike: Then whose is it? That guy stole your work. He took your trunk show right from under you. There is no way I will let him get away with that.",
        "Jennifer: You're upset about the trunk show?",
        "Mike: Is there more?",
        "Jennifer: The show -- the show is over now, okay? You don't have to defend me anymore.",
        "Mike: Maybe I want to.",
        "Jennifer: I can't believe you still feel that way, after everything that's happened.",
        "Mike: Jen. Jen, I love you.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Mike. I love you too.",
        "Mike: You okay?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Mike: All right, good. I'm going to find Craig.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, no, please, can't we just forget about him?",
        "Mike: After what he did to you?",
        "Jennifer: Look, I love that you want to protect me, okay? But it is enough for me to hear that you're on my side. I'm not sure I deserve it.",
        "Mike: Of course you deserve it.",
        "Jennifer: You are so amazing. I was so sure I had ruined everything.",
        "Mike: I had a talk with Katie.",
        "Jennifer: About us?",
        "Mike: Made me realize what we have. You know, about how good it is to be honest with each other. You were honest with me about Craig. I respect that.",
        "Jennifer: Still, I would give anything to not have done what i did.",
        "Mike: I know. I know. But if we let him split us up, that means that we gave Craig power over our lives. I will not do that.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, thank you.",
        "Mike: He's stolen enough already. No more. Let's go home.",
        "Jennifer: That sounds really good. I have a few business things I have to finish up. I'll meet you at home, okay?",
        "Mike: All right, don't be long.",
        "Jennifer: So, there you have the whole picture, whether you wanted it or not.",
        "Dusty: Craig's the father?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. I know, I know. I should tell Mike. Don't worry, I will.",
        "Dusty: Why would you do a dumb thing like that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tyson: Hey, Celia.",
        "Celia: Hi. Tyson, right?",
        "Tyson: What'd I tell you? All the hot ones know my name. I'm Max.",
        "Celia: Celia Ortega. I know. You're in my bio class. Are we supposed to get a tour of this place, or what?",
        "Henry: Step right up, folks. The tour bus is about to leave in just one minute. How you doing?",
        "Tyson: Tyson.",
        "Henry: Tyson, hi. That's quite a grip you got there. Kevin Sorbo. You know, you're probably interested in the free weights over here. I bet that's you're into. Come on down this way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What's up with you?",
        "Will: Nothing!",
        "Casey: You're blowing me off? Listen, man, after the way you acted, you're lucky I'm even speaking to you.",
        "Will: I didn't do anything to you.",
        "Casey: Dude, you know I'm into Celia, and you put on this front like you want to help, and then you get her flowers? Real nice.",
        "Will: All right, the flowers were for somebody else. I changed my mind and Celia was just standing there. Okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I totally believe that.",
        "Will: Believe what you want. I don't care!",
        "Casey: Okay, then. Who did you buy the flowers for?",
        "Will: None of your business.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Alison: Will? What are you doing? You just hurt your hand. Let me -- let me see it.",
        "Will: I'm fine.",
        "Aaron: Might as well let her look, buddy. She'll just keep nagging you till she wears you down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: I'll do anything. Just tell me what you need.",
        "Lily: You can watch over my children, okay? And with the girls, maybe you can invite them to slumber parties, maybe you could buy them their ballet slippers. Can you take care of my babies, please?",
        "Sierra: Lily, you should be doing that. You're their mother.",
        "Lily: I know. But I can't be there, so you have to be. And, also, Faith has her dance recital next week and she's playing a daisy and I really want her to look out into the audience and see her whole family there.",
        "Sierra: But her whole family includes you.",
        "Lily: I need you to take some pictures.",
        "Sierra: Lily --",
        "Lily: I want pictures of their barrettes -- their new barrettes -- their, their haircuts, their, their pictures. I need to see a lot of their pictures. And I also want to get a picture of the first time Faith makes her bed for the first time all by herself. And -- oh, and the girls, they have this nail polish and they do the \"two sisters nail salon\" -- I need a picture of that, because I never got a picture of that.",
        "Sierra: Lily, listen to me.",
        "Lily: I need to have it.",
        "Sierra: I can take pictures -- I can take a hundred pictures and so can Holden, but that's not going to keep you going. These children are part of you.",
        "Lily: And they always will be.",
        "Sierra: That's right. And you know what? Holden's a good Dad, but you take care of the little things. The details.",
        "Lily: I just hope they remember that, you know?",
        "Sierra: Come on. I will make sure of that. I'll keep you connected to your children. I promise you that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Is your dad home?",
        "Luke: No. He took Faith and Natalie to my grandmother's house. And I think if he saw you here, he wouldn't like it that much.",
        "Keith: Okay, well then I'll make it quick. I know you love your mother. That's why you tried to burn the evidence, right? Come on, come on. I'm just trying to get to the truth.",
        "Luke: The truth is that my mother's innocent.",
        "Keith: Then why does she keep telling everybody that she's guilty?",
        "Luke: To protect me.",
        "Keith: From what?",
        "Luke: I -- you know what? I just -- I don't want to talk about it right now. I know you hate her.",
        "Keith: No, I hate whoever it was that killed my sister.",
        "Luke: Well, it wasn't my mother.",
        "Keith: Okay. Well then, convince me. Because she's about to do twenty years to life for a crime she didn't commit. So either you trust me or you send your mother to jail. Those are your two choices.",
        "Keith: Look, I don't mean to scare you. I know why you did what you did. You love your mother and you wanted to help her. However, you see, it got everybody confused. So I'm giving you a chance here to straighten things out.",
        "Luke: Why? Why would you -- why would you want to help us?",
        "Keith: Look, if I wanted to hurt your mother, I would just walk away right now and let her confess. But I love my sister, and I want who killed her, the real person that killed her, to pay.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Keith: All right.",
        "Luke: What do you want to know?",
        "Keith: I want to know about that night. What doesn't make any sense? Maybe we can -- we can figure something out here.",
        "Luke: Well, what I don't get is why my mom is telling everybody that Julia was dead when she left that apartment.",
        "Keith: You don't think that's true?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Keith: So why would your mother lie?",
        "Luke: That's what I want to ask her, but we're not allowed to see each other.",
        "Keith: But if you could --",
        "Luke: Well, I would tell her that Julia was alive when she left, that she doesn't have to be scared, because she didn't kill Julia, and neither did I. But when I told her that I went over to the apartment to take care of things that was also a lie. And she believed it. And -- and that's why she went and told people that she had killed Julia, to keep me from going to jail.",
        "Keith: Are you sure about that?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Keith: Okay. Go get your coat.",
        "Luke: Why? Where are we going? Where are we going?",
        "Keith: We're going to the police station. We're going to get your mother out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Well, you didn't make the old injury any worse, but you sure tried. Don't pound on the bag so hard next time. How'd the tour go?",
        "Aaron: You missed a lot, nurse nightingale. How's Will's hand?",
        "Alison: Way better than it should be.",
        "Aaron: Maybe I ought to hurt my hand. I can get you for a while.",
        "Alison: More than a while -- forever.",
        "Katie: Aw, you guys are so cute together.",
        "Aaron: Easy on the cute stuff. You're going to ruin my reputation.",
        "Alison: I already did that. So how's married life?",
        "Katie: It's good. Henry is a wonderful husband.",
        "Henry: My ears are burning.",
        "Katie: And an even better partner.",
        "Henry: This place is on fire. You know, we should put out some more flyers tomorrow.",
        "Alison: Those were your idea? Genius. It got us to sign up.",
        "Henry: Both of you? You're both gonna sign up?",
        "Aaron: Hey, we live together, we work together. Might as well sweat together.",
        "Henry: I couldn't have said that better myself. You know, that should be our new slogan.",
        "Katie: Well, you know what? We're gonna give you a good deal. And especially if you join as a couple, we'll even give you a better discount.",
        "Alison: Well, actually, we're feeling kinda rich today. We got extra bonuses at work.",
        "Katie: Oh, Metro must be doing well. I'm so happy for you guys.",
        "Aaron: Thank you very much. So we thought we can afford an extra membership.",
        "Alison: Yeah. And it's my mom's birthday soon. And my sister would probably want one, too.",
        "Aaron: Your sister? You didn't tell me about your sister.",
        "Alison: Well, it's okay. I mean, if it's too much --",
        "Aaron: Oh, hell, whatever. Four memberships.",
        "Henry: Let me talk to you about the family plan. Family plan. Come on. I'll draw up the paperwork back here.",
        "Katie: I know what you're doing. And let me just say thank you. You're the best.",
        "Celia: Put me down. What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tyson: There's other ways to get in shape besides lifting weights.",
        "Max: Let's go, Tyse. How many reps can you do?",
        "Tyson: I don't think she's heavy enough to do any good.",
        "Celia: This isn't funny. Let go.",
        "Max: Relax, gorgeous. We're just here to have a good time.",
        "Tyson: I heard you Montega girls really know how to show a man a good time.",
        "Celia: Too bad you're not a man.",
        "Max: Don't be stuck up.",
        "Tyson: Yeah. Didn't your mama teach you manners?",
        "Casey: Hey!",
        "Celia: Leave me alone.",
        "Casey: You let go of her, man.",
        "Celia: Casey. Will, don't.",
        "Will: What's going on here?",
        "Max: This guy a friend of yours?",
        "Will: Yeah, actually, they both are. And I think she said you should let her go.",
        "Tyson: Like I care what you heard, loser.",
        "Will: Loser? Not me. I'm going to manage this girl some day.",
        "Tyson: Yeah, I hear she's gonna be a big star. Well, if you're her manager, why don't you have her sing something for us?",
        "Will: Oh, I wasn't talking about singing. I was talking about her boxing career.",
        "Max: Boxing.",
        "Will: Yeah. Nobody told you guys? She inherited her brother's left hook. Maybe you've heard of him. Rafael Ortega. He fought in the ring over there. It made all the newspapers.",
        "Tyson: You mean the guy who put the other fighter in the hospital?",
        "Will: That would be the one. And he taught his little sister everything he knows.",
        "Celia: That's right. So don't mess with me.",
        "Will: Yeah, don't let the pretty face fool you. She's meaner than a mountain lion. I mean, look what she did to me when I got on her bad side.",
        "Celia: I did not.",
        "Will: Yeah, but we know you could of. So why don't you guys just back off, all right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Am I understanding you right? Are you saying that I should keep my pregnancy a secret from mike?",
        "Dusty: That depends.",
        "Jennifer: On?",
        "Dusty: On what you want.",
        "Jennifer: What I want is to go back in time before any of this ever happened.",
        "Dusty: No, that's not an option. You've gotta look forward and ask yourself what you want. You want kids?",
        "Jennifer: One day.",
        "Dusty: What about Mike? He wants kids?",
        "Jennifer: Just about a dozen. But like most men, he would like for them to be his.",
        "Dusty: So don't tell him.",
        "Jennifer: He'll find out.",
        "Dusty: No, he won't. Not from me.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, he knows that I slept with Craig. He'll wonder.",
        "Dusty: Maybe for a minute, but he loves you. He wants to believe.",
        "Jennifer: This is so unfair. He already went through this whole thing with Carly. He spent months wondering if he was the father of her child, and then when he found out he wasn't, it tore him up inside.",
        "Dusty: So don't put him through it again. Lose the mystery right up front.",
        "Jennifer: But if he -- if he ever found out --",
        "Dusty: Jen, if you want Mike, go home, make love to him. And in about a month, you tell him the baby's on the way.",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. Don't know, Dusty. I'm don't know if I could live with my conscience.",
        "Dusty: If your conscience is more important than your happiness, tell him you're carrying Craig's kid. You'll sleep better, but you'll sleep alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: But so much has gone wrong. Craig --",
        "Mike: But right now we don't ever have to think of Craig Montgomery again.",
        "Lily: I used to be so strong.",
        "Keith: You are strong. Listen, you don't have to be scared anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I don't know what to do. I have made such a mess of my life.",
        "Dusty: You almost made a mess. Right now, it can still go either way.",
        "Jennifer: If you were in Mike's shoes, wouldn't you need to know the truth?",
        "Dusty: There are a lot of different truths. Do you love him?",
        "Jennifer: With all my heart.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's what I'd want to know. If you have that, I guess it can work out.",
        "Jennifer: You make it sound so easy.",
        "Dusty: Nothing worth fighting for is easy. Love is not easy.",
        "Jennifer: I think I should be honest with Mike.",
        "Dusty: You already made one mistake. I'd really think twice before you follow it up with another.",
        "Jennifer: How can I sit by and smile and just say, \"Mike, this is your baby. Let's live happily ever after.\" He deserves better than that.",
        "Dusty: And what's better about breaking his heart? You're gonna lose him. He'll lose you. The only winner's gonna be Montgomery.",
        "Jennifer: But if I let him believe that this child is his, he may not know that I lied, but I will. I will always know. And every time I look at that child, I will see Craig's face. I don't know that I can live with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tyson: No hard feelings, okay?",
        "Casey: No hard feelings? You were harassing her.",
        "Max: Was he talking to you?",
        "Will: Go easy, guys. All right? The manager's watching right now, and I wouldn't want her calling the cops if I were you. You know, my dad's chief of detectives, and Casey's mom wears a badge, so it wouldn't exactly be a level playing field.",
        "Tyson: We were just kidding around. This whole thing just got way out of hand.",
        "Max: Yeah. No harm done, right? Everybody friends?",
        "Celia: Very cool. You didn't even look angry.",
        "Casey: Yeah, man. Nice work.",
        "Alison: Smooth.",
        "Will: Yeah. Sometimes I actually manage not to mess up.",
        "Alison: Well, it's nice to see you smile. Looks like you're over whatever had you wailing at that bag earlier. Or not. Do you wanna fight?",
        "Will: I thought you said no fighting.",
        "Alison: That's right. I did. No, but seriously. I'm really proud of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh, Luke.",
        "Luke: Mom.",
        "Lily: What are you doing here? We're not supposed to be seeing each other.",
        "Keith: I fixed it with the desk sergeant. I'm the victim's brother.",
        "Lily: Wait a minute. You stay away.",

        "Lily: I killed Julia. Please just keep Luke out of this.",
        "Luke: No, no, no. Mom, Mom, Mom. He didn't force me to meme here. I came here because I wanted to.",
        "Lily: Okay, you can't be here. You have to leave right now.",
        "Keith: Listen. Your son's a lot tougher than you think. Go ahead. Tell her.",
        "Luke: I -- I didn't kill Julia.",
        "Lily: I know that. It is my crime. And when I go back to court, it'll be a matter of record.",
        "Luke: No, Mom, Mom, Mom. Listen to me. Julia was already dead when I showed up.",
        "Lily: But you said you --",
        "Luke: I know. I said that to protect you. I thought -- I mean, I knew you didn't kill Julia in cold blood. But then i saw your gloves, and I was afraid the police wouldn't think it was an accident, so I told them she was still alive when I showed up.",
        "Lily: But she wasn't?",
        "Luke: No. And I didn't do anything to her, because I knew that she was already gone.",
        "Lily: So you were going to go to jail to protect me?",
        "Luke: Just like you were ready to go for me.",
        "Lily: Oh, thank God. Oh, it's going to be okay. It's all going to be okay.",

        "Jennifer: Mike? What is all this?",
        "Mike: It's romantic take-out. At least, it will be romantic when I get these candles lit.",
        "Jennifer: This is so sweet.",
        "Mike: Sweet and sour, actually, is the shrimp. And we got some dumplings and some moo shu chicken, beef with scallions, no peppers. [Jennifer groans] you okay?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, just got a little queasy.",
        "Mike: Well, I thought these were your favorites.",
        "Jennifer: No, no, they are. They are. You -- you remembered every detail. I just haven't been feeling too great today.",
        "Mike: Maybe you're coming down with something.",
        "Jennifer: No. No, I just -- must have been just all the coffee with the stress, you know.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Oh, Mike, I'm sorry. You went to all this trouble and I don't want to ruin it.",
        "Mike: No, you won't. You won't. The food was just a tease. This is the big surprise.",
        "Jennifer: This is what you wanted to give me before, isn't it?",
        "Mike: Open it and see.",
        "Jennifer: It's a blueprint for an addition? A room on the back of the cottage?",
        "Mike: Well, it's not just a room. It's your studio. Yeah, Lucinda gave me clearance and once I finished the drawings, I never got a chance to give them to you.",
        "Jennifer: This is amazing! You thought of everything.",
        "Mike: I thought you might enjoy being able to go to work and stay in your pajamas. I like how you look in your pajamas.",
        "Jennifer: Just when I think you couldn't possibly be more wonderful, you amaze me all over again.",
        "Mike: Jen, I want you to be happy. Today and tomorrow, forever. We've had our setbacks and -- and it took me a while to sort some things out, but I know what I want. I want a life with you.",
        "Jennifer: I want that, too. But so much has gone wrong. Craig --",
        "Mike: Let's shut the door on him.",
        "Jennifer: I wish we could. I wish that with all my heart.",
        "Mike: Well, then let's do it. Let's start now. Right now, we don't ever have to think of Craig Montgomery again.",

        "Dusty: Thanks for coming down here.",
        "Sierra: Dusty?",
        "Dusty: Craig did everything he could today to upstage Jennifer. You know the trunk show she had scheduled? He shows up with knockoffs of all her stuff and undercuts the prices so that he outsells Street Jeans by 50%.",
        "Sierra: What kind of damage are we talking about?",
        "Dusty: I mean, it's not a death blow to the company, but I saw something very vicious in that guy today. Not only does he want to take over our market share, he wants to destroy Jennifer.",
        "Sierra: Did she perceive it the same way that you did?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. She's losing her mind.",
        "Sierra: You know, I feel completely and totally responsible for this.",
        "Dusty: Why you? It's not like you bankrolled his new company.",
        "Sierra: Because I should have anticipated that he would find funding someplace. I honestly -- I honestly thought that he had changed. I am not gonna make that mistake again.",
        "Dusty: We gotta take the offensive.",
        "Sierra: What kind of suggestions do you got?",
        "Dusty: You give me complete control of Street Jeans so I don't have to answer to anybody.",
        "Sierra: What are you planning?",
        "Dusty: I'll tell you, but you're not gonna like it.",

        "Celia: I wonder if Katie's going to be offering a self-defense class. I can't count on you two guys always being my heroes.",

        "Will: Yeah, me, too. Anytime, Celia.",
        "Celia: Let's go grab something to eat.",
        "Casey: We don't have time. The concert, remember? Come on, I've got the whole thing planned out to go.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Well, all I can say is I never thought getting married in a gym would be romantic, but it actually was. So you guys should consider it.",
        "Henry: You know, the best thing about it is, you don't have to worry about wearing white socks.",
        "Katie: No, but seriously, guys, it can be really beautiful. And we would make it so special for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't let you go to jail for something that was an accident.",

        "Luke: Are you okay with that, Mom?",
        "Lily: Yeah. I'm fine.",
        "Luke: You think I can tell Faith and Natalie that you'll be home soon?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Luke: Mom -- Mom, no, no, you don't have to pretend that you did it anymore. You don't have to protect me.",
        "Lily: I convinced a lot of people that I was guilty. It's going to be very difficult to change their minds, honey.",
        "Luke: Well, just try.",
        "Lily: I will. I will. I promise you, I will. Okay.",
        "Luke: Thanks.",

        "Luke: Please, help my mom get out of here.",
        "Keith: What's wrong?",
        "Lily: Everything is wrong. Everything. I started out just trying to keep my family together and I made a mistake after mistake. Now my kids are so lost, your sister is dead, my husband thinks I'm nuts.",
        "Keith: Yeah, I know, there's a lot of kids lost, including J.J.",
        "Lily: I know. I think about J.J., I worry about him, who's going to protect J.J.?",
        "Keith: I'm going to protect J.J., and when the day comes when he asks me what happened, I'll have the answer. So, let's get started. Are you going to be able to do this?",
        "Lily: I don't know. I used to be so sure of everything. I used to be so strong.",
        "Keith: You are strong. What you did for your son, take the rap that took a lot of guts.",
        "Lily: Why? Why can't I stop feeling like I'm going to just crack and break?",
        "Keith: Well, that's because you've been scared for a long time. Now listen, you don't have to be scared anymore.",
        "Lily: I don't know if you can help me. I did a really good job framing myself for murder.",
        "Keith: We'll talk to the D.A.",
        "Lily: Tom's not going to drop the charges just because I've changed my plea.",
        "Keith: He might.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I obstructed justice, Keith.",
        "Keith: Yeah, well, that's not 20 years in prison.",
        "Lily: Even if I could convince him that I'm innocent, I don't know if I should. Not if Luke becomes the number one suspect again.",
        "Keith: Well, things will be different this time, because you've got the victim's brother on your side.",
        "Lily: That's a lot of lies. A lot of lies. How do we start to unravel them?",
        "Keith: We'll unravel them, but you can't give up.",
        "Lily: No, I'm not, I just -- I don't know where to begin.",
        "Keith: I'll tell you where to begin, the day that my sister was killed.",
        "Lily: Everything changed. You and J.J., your lives will never be normal again.",
        "Keith: Our lives will be better. Once we find out who killed my sister, we won't be living with this anger and this bitterness. So, now listen, you were the last person to see my sister alive, other than the killer.",
        "Lily: The last person with the best motive, yes.",
        "Keith: Well, I don't know about that. My sister had a rather sketchy past.",
        "Lily: You think someone came to Oakdale and tracked her down?",
        "Keith: Maybe. I'll tell you everything about her past, before she came here, and you tell me everything about her life when she was here.",
        "Lily: There's a lot I'm not proud of when it comes to your sister.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? If we're going to work together, we got to trust each other. Otherwise, we're never going to get the truth.",

        "Aaron: Alison, I almost died in that ring.",
        "Alison: Well, maybe that's why we should get married there. You know, replace a bad memory with a happy one.",
        "Aaron: No.",
        "Alison: All right, but don't come looking for me at Luther's Corners. I already tried getting married there once.",

        "Tyson: You think you made me back down before? The only reason I didn't lay you out is because the manager was hanging with your girlfriend, and they were watching us.",
        "Will: All right, Alison's not my girlfriend.",
        "Tyson: Yeah, and she never will be. She's way too fine for you. But you go ahead and try. Watching you hang around the girl and dance with your tongue hangin' out, it's kinda fun. I'm waiting for her to teach you to roll over and beg. Every good dog should be able to do that.",
