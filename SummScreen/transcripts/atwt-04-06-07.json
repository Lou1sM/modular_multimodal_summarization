        "Margo wants Casey to take his house arrest seriously, as Casey is more interested in getting close to Maddie. Gwen struggles with the aftermath of her attempted rape; Will tries to be supportive, but he struggles to hide his hurt when she wants to spend time alone. Gwen interrupts an intimate moment between Maddie and Casey to ask for advice about her problems getting past her assault. Even though Maddie offers a sympathetic ear, Gwen ends up lecturing her. Maddie becomes upset because she thinks she is allowed to enjoy the time she has left with Casey; Gwen realizes how she came across and apologizes. Margo tells Will that Adam called. Gwen doesn't handle this well. Margo heads home to tell Casey and Maddie and finds them having sex. Jade gets a response from her ad that she posted for a Gwen-look-alike. Cleo looks nothing like Gwen though. Jade tries to get rid of her, but when Cleo sees Gwen with Will, she wants to say hi. Dusty and Emily go undercover to find Allison. When the porn producer brings Allison along with a few other girls to meet his supposed contact, Allison recognizes Dusty and realizes she has been found out. Emily and Allison argue about her career path, as Allison goads her about not rocking the boat because Susan is a recovering alcoholic and Emily is unstable. Dusty realizes Allison is in a lot more trouble then he originally thought; he takes her purse forcibly from her and finds a vile with a white powdery substance in it."

        "Will: Morning.",
        "Gwen: Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.",
        "Will: It's okay. It's nice way to wake up.",
        "Gwen: I don't think I'll ever take it for granted again what it feels like to wake up in bed next to you.",
        "Will: Yeah. I'm right there with you. Gwen?",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Wait, you're going to the station? You were working all night.",
        "Margo: Well, the paperwork has piled up the last couple of weeks. I've been distracted.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Here.",
        "Casey: What's this?",
        "Margo: It's your daily log. Now, there is a couple of things I want to go over here.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I got it.",
        "Margo: Wait a minute, you -- your father has walked on water to get you house arrest. And that's good. I'm glad, but you know what, it puts me in a little bit of an awkward position, being the new chief of detectives. It looks pretty much like my son has been handed a walk.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Margo: So, this is not joke. This is not a holiday. You are under arrest, is that clear?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Margo: Now, that means no television, no computer games, no nothing.",
        "Casey: Mom, I'm going to be working pretty hard to catch up on the last --",
        "Margo: That's right, you are. You are going to be working hard. You are going to clean out the garage, you are going to do your own laundry, you are going to do your own dishes, and you are going to keep that log accurately.",
        "Casey: Right. You got it.",
        "Margo: Because this is it, do you understand, Casey? Do you understand this is it?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I got it.",
        "Margo: Given the long list of laws that you have completely disregarded, I'm not sure that you deserve this break. So, straight and narrow, Casey. Do you understand?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I got. I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: There's food in the refrigerator. You clean up after yourself.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Maddie: Are you okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, she really let me have it.",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: It sucks because we both know that I deserve it.",
        "Maddie: No, you don't. You wouldn't have left town if you hadn't been trying to help me.",
        "Casey: She hates yelling at me, I know she hates yelling at me.",
        "Maddie: I know.",
        "Casey: Man, I really screwed things up, huh?",
        "Maddie: Don't say that. Please, don't say that.",
        "Casey: At least I've still got you though.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I cannot believe you read the newspaper. It's so -- long. I mean, you can get all of your news off the internet.",
        "Luke: Jade. What Britney says about Kevin is not news.",
        "Jade: Well, I think it is. So, come on, are you ready to go to the mall?",
        "Luke: I don't know.",
        "Jade: Come on, Luke. It will be good for you to get out. Besides your parents are going to be at the hospital all morning with faith.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I guess you're right. But I told my grandmother I'd check the mousetraps, won't be long.",
        "Jade: Sometimes I really appreciate traditional gender roles.",
        "Luke: Yeah. Throwing away dead mice. That is so masculine.",
        "Jade: Meet me for breakfast this morning in front of the bookstore in Old Town. [Jade leaves and gets a text message on her cell phone from Cleo. \"I'm the one you want. Well, we'll see about that.\"]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Did you sleep at all?",
        "Emily: What do you think?",
        "Dusty: We're going to find your sister. Don't worry.",
        "Emily: If I do find her, what do I say? You know what, I'm not even sure if I want this to work or not.",
        "Dusty: What? What are you talking about?",
        "Emily: How do I look after her?",
        "Dusty: She's your sister, she needs you.",
        "Emily: She's more than my sister. And I think all of this because of me. Part of her that is me.",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Dusty: Let's go.",
        "Lance: You Palace? John Palace?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, come on in.",
        "Lance: You going to shoot in here? You're going to have trouble with light, you know?",
        "Dusty: No, no, I got a house in the desert. My camera guy's all set.",
        "Lance: Good. Someone that knows what they're doing. Yeah, that's good. You know, this is a business. And I know a thousand guys just like you who, see one my films, think they can do what they do, you know?",
        "Dusty: Right. Well, if you've got the right girl for me, you're going to make a lot of money.",
        "Lance: I guess you've got a point. Okay, just so we're on the right page here, you're going to use one of my girls, you're going to pay them whatever you two work out. But me, I get what we agreed to on the phone. No matter what happens, okay?",
        "Dusty: I got it. Where are they?",
        "Lance: They're downstairs. I like to make sure everything's on the up and up before I make the introductions.",
        "Dusty: That's good.",
        "Lance: Yeah, it's kind of paternal of me, you know mean?",
        "Dusty: That's what I like about you.",
        "Lance: Hey, Ladies, get your butts up here. The Augustus suite. Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Nice meeting you.",
        "Lance: Huh?",
        "Dusty: I only audition girls alone. I don't like any, you know, paternal influences around.",
        "Lance: Don't mess with them. All right, you might be a big guy but, they've had bigger. You know what I mean, huh?",
        "Dusty: You all right?",
        "Emily: I think I'm going to be sick.",
        "Dusty: All right, get back in there. Back in here.",
        "Dusty: Hi, Alison. Long time, no see.",
        "Actress #1: I thought this guy was new to the business.",
        "Alison: He is.",
        "Actress #2: So how come it looks like you two know each other real good?",
        "Alison: Because we do.",
        "Actress 1 #: So, I don't like being set up, Pal. I'm going to call my friend.",
        "Dusty: Ladies, I'm sorry for wasting your time. This is for your troubles.",
        "Actress #2: Hey, you can trouble me any time you want.",
        "Actress #1: Well, what about her?",
        "Dusty: She and I are going to talk.",
        "Alison: You guys get going, okay. I'll be fine.",
        "Actress #2: I wouldn't mind having a little talk with him, myself.",
        "Actress #1: You're on the wrong side of the camera.",
        "Dusty: Well, as they say --",
        "Alison: What is a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?",
        "Dusty: I was going to say, fancy meeting you here, but whatever.",
        "Alison: Now, why would you say that, when you planned all this? You knew we were meeting here.",
        "Dusty: I was hoping to.",
        "Alison: You know, like my friend just said, I don't like getting set up either.",
        "Dusty: You're hard to connect through normal channels.",
        "Alison: So why was Dusty Donovan suddenly all hot on getting in touch with his old friend, Alison? Are you out of the boxing biz, huh? Or you a private, oh, what do they call it -- dick? Time to come out, Emily. I think you and I need to set a few things straight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: All right, rodent detail completed, let's hit the mall.",
        "Jade: Oh, Luke, I --",
        "Luke: Oh, here we go.",
        "Jade: What?",
        "Luke: You're not going.",
        "Jade: I went on line and I was working on a project --",
        "Luke: You know what, Jade. Just skip it.",
        "Jade: What are you, mad at me?",
        "Luke: Well, maybe I don't have a right to be, but you are a part of this family.",
        "Jade: I know that.",
        "Luke: Do you even care what's happening to it?",
        "Jade: Excuse me?",
        "Luke: Yesterday, you were all like, oh, poor Faith, what can I do to help? And now, today, you're acting like nothing even happened. I mean, you just float around in this cyberspace world.",
        "Jade: Faith isn't even here. Because she's with your parents, because they're dealing with a very difficult situation right now. And I don't think they'd appreciate me pushing my way into it. So what am I supposed to do?",
        "Luke: Nothing. Like me.",
        "Jade: Luke, what is going on here?",
        "Luke: What's going on? I'm just really upset and my solution is taking it out on you.",
        "Jade: Well, that being a part of the whole family thing? I'm very new to it.",
        "Luke: I know.",
        "Jade: I just don't think it comes very naturally to me.",
        "Luke: Okay, look. I'm sorry.",
        "Jade: No, it's fine. If it makes you feel better to take it out on me, I have a really thick skin. And I'm sorry I didn't understand how you were feeling this morning.",
        "Luke: This whole part of being a family thing? You're not that bad at it.",
        "Jade: Listen, I'm sorry about the date, okay? But tomorrow --",
        "Luke: No, it's okay. It's okay.",
        "Jade: Listen to me, tomorrow, we can make plans that cannot be broken, or changed, just you and me.",
        "Luke: Okay. Okay, just go. Go. And whatever it is that's so important, I hope it goes well.",
        "Jade: We'll see. We'll see.",

        "Maddie: I love you. But I don't want to get you in trouble.",
        "Casey: I know.",
        "Maddie: And I just -- I feel like I'm betraying your parents. I mean, after everything they've done for me.",
        "Casey: I know that, too.",
        "Maddie: I just -- more than anything in the world, I just want us to be able to be alone together. In a place that's our own that we're not hurting anyone.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and I pretty much fixed it so that can't happen.",
        "Maddie: It's not your fault.",
        "Casey: Ah, yeah, pretty much is. And staying here isn't even a sure thing, because any minute the judge could send me to --",
        "Maddie: Don't say it.",
        "Casey: It doesn't matter if I say it or not, I think about it all the time. That I've messed things up so bad, that we can't even have our time together.",
        "Maddie: Okay, well, then let's not think about what could happen. And let's think about what we have right now.",
        "Casey: I have you. And that's all I need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: You must be tired of hearing me say it, but it's true. I am -- I am sorry.",
        "Will: There's nothing to be sorry for.",
        "Gwen: You don't think so?",
        "Will: No.",
        "Gwen: After everything you've done for me, how you stood by me, how you stood up to your brother?",
        "Will: Look, I know I haven't graduated from college yet, but I got enough figured out to know that when someone's been through the things that you've gone through, and it's going to take a lot of time to get back to normal.",
        "Gwen: Are you going to major in psychology?",
        "Will: No, I'm going to enjoy the fact that we have our life back and I'm going to trust that you're going to start to feel better with time.",
        "Gwen: When we were in L.A., doing the photo shoot for the demo --",
        "Will: You don't -- you don't have to tell me anything or explain anything.",
        "Gwen: We had to take these pictures, and I was supposed to look really sexy. And I wasn't very good at it.",
        "Will: Yeah, right.",
        "Gwen: No, I wasn't. And Adam started talking to me about what it felt like to wake up in the morning and to be alone with you. And I thought he was asking me that because you know, for the photos, but now I know that he was just trying to get me to say things that were really personal. And private. You know, for his own reasons.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: It was like he was trying to get into every part of my brain.",
        "Will: That's why it's going to take time to work through it.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Will: Lucky for you, you got a swell guy like me to hang out with.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I am lucky.",
        "Will: Okay, you go get the paper, I'm going to go get some coffee, and we're just going to spend the day in bed, vegging out.",
        "Gwen: Will, I think I got to get moving.",
        "Will: Where?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. I think I'm -- I'll go see how Casey and Maddie are doing.",
        "Will: Well wait, can't you just -- can't you call them on the phone?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I just want to get going, you know --",
        "Will: All right, we'll just -- hold on, I'll get dressed and come with you.",
        "Gwen: Will, I think I need some alone time. You know, I'm just going to drive over there. And I'll be back. I'll be back really soon.",
        "Will: Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Whatever you want.",
        "Gwen: I'm just -- I don't know, I'm in a mood. You know, I'll be in a better mood when I get back. I promise.",
        "Will: Okay. I'll be here.",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Will: Margo. Hi.",
        "Margo: Hi. Sorry to just stop by like this, but --",
        "Will: No, it's okay. Come on in.",
        "Margo: Oh, good. Thanks. Oh, you're studying? Casey's trying to catch up, too. He's a -- it seems really lame to make small talk, doesn't it? Um, is Gwen here? I really want to talk to both of you.",
        "Will: Um, actually, she just went over to your house to see Maddie and Casey.",
        "Margo: Oh, oh, all right. Well, then I'll just tell you and you can tell her later. Or you can have her call me.",
        "Will: Margo, what is it?",
        "Margo: I was in the car and I got a call. From Adam.",

        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Casey: Don't get it. Don't get it.",
        "Maddie: No. It's okay. I'll go see who it is. Go upstairs.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I just came by to see -- wow, right. It's not a good time.",
        "Maddie: Gwen, wait, hang on.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.",
        "Maddie: It's okay. Don't apologize. What's wrong? You were upset when you got here.",
        "Gwen: No, Casey's waiting for you, go back inside. It's freezing.",
        "Maddie: No, come inside with me.",
        "Gwen: No!",
        "Maddie: Gwen, I'm not going back in, either, until you tell me what's wrong.",
        "Gwen: It's me, actually. It's me and Will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: What a big surprise. You meet someone unreliable on the internet.",
        "Cleo: Oh, excuse me?",
        "Jade: Yeah, can I help you? Because no offense, you really look like you can use some help getting dressed.",
        "Cleo: Wait, don't you know who I am?",
        "Jade: Uh, no. But I'm sure you're a very nice person. Okay, see you around.",
        "Cleo: Wait. Wait one second, I mean, aren't you Twingirl18?",
        "Jade: Yeah. And you're --",
        "Cleo: I'm the one who responded to your post. You know -- the answer to all your problems? Here I am!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay, so since we're finally face to face, I'm going to be blunt because you obviously can't take a hint. I don't want you here.",
        "Emily: Hi, Ally.",
        "Alison: Yeah, hi. So, now, listen. I don't like you stopping by my producer's office, and I really, really don't like you lying and telling me mom's sick.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Emily, you're way out of line.",
        "Alison: Look, if I'm ticked off at her for butting into my business, you can only imagine what I feel for you showing up here.",
        "Emily: I just want to talk to you for a minute --",
        "Alison: Yeah, right. Like I forgot that I just want to talk isn't code for, let me tell you how to live your life. Well, I'm an adult now. I make my own decisions.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, what kind of decisions can you possibly be making when you cut yourself off from your entire family?",
        "Alison: How do you know that's not the decision I'm talking about?",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Alison: Maybe I finally decided to be on my own without Alison's two little mommies telling her what to do and when to do it.",
        "Emily: Honey, we love you.",
        "Alison: Which makes you think you own me.",
        "Emily: No, that's not true.",
        "Alison: Have you started those real estate classes, yet? Are you really going to wear that blouse?",
        "Emily: Oh, would you cut it out?",
        "Alison: Look, I'm not going to take advice from two women who both have completely messed up lives.",
        "Emily: All right, I get it. I get it. You want to live on your own. But like this? Honey, this is -- this is not safe on every level.",
        "Alison: You have no idea what you're talking about, okay? Lance is a professional and he takes really good care of us.",
        "Emily: I heard the way -- I heard the way he talked to you. Get your butts up here? That's professional to you?",
        "Dusty: Does he have something on you, Alison? Some reason you can't leave?",
        "Emily: We will help you with him. We'll get you away from -- we'll take you home --",
        "Alison: Lance doesn't have anything on me! I'm doing what I want, where I want. So, why don't the two of you just go back to sweet little Oakdale and live whatever you call a life? I'm staying here.",
        "Emily: Okay, so, you're an adult now and how you live is your decision. And you chose this career.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Emily: And as far as you're concerned, you have nothing to be ashamed of.",
        "Emily: Good, so you won't mind me calling Mom and filling her in? Telling her how you struck out on your own -- and how you're having sex in front of a camera.",
        "Alison: You know what, Em? Go ahead and call. I dare you.",
        "Alison: Go ahead, call Mom. Make it sound real awful. Won't I be embarrassed then?",
        "Emily: I'm not trying to embarrass you, Ally, I'm trying to wake you up.",
        "Alison: But just think about what's going to happen when you tell her. You and I both know how hard she has to work at to stay sober. And the one thing she likes to tell herself, even if it isn't true, is at least her kids turned out okay. That's the one big illusion she has to hold onto. For a doctor, and for a woman who deals with life or death situations every day, our mother's just a wee bit fragile.",
        "Emily: Why do you hate her so much?",
        "Alison: Look, I get along with her fine. And with you too, when you're in another state and you don't know where I am.",
        "Emily: She loves you, Ally. And so do I.",
        "Alison: Right. Great. Right back at you. But you make that call and you end up with a drunk mom and me still here in Vegas, forging a career.",
        "Emily: I won't do it.",
        "Alison: So, fabulous seeing you again.",
        "Emily: But I won't -- I won't let you go, either. Ally, please, just let me help you, please?",
        "Alison: You, help me? Emily, think. Just how messed up does a person have to be to need help from you? You're not exactly the model picture of mental health, are you?",
        "Emily: I don't pretend to be.",
        "Alison: And I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but you show up here with the guy you kidnapped and the two of you are supposed to set me on the right path? You guys an item now? Did you manage to work through all the anger?",
        "Dusty: People change.",
        "Alison: Oh, that's so sweet.",
        "Dusty: You changed into an idiot.",
        "Alison: One of the real advantages of my new life is that I don't have to take crap like that anymore.",
        "Dusty: Right, I know. You're empowered. You and Lance. Are you guys equal partners?",
        "Alison: I don't see it like that. I see it like I'm an independent contractor.",
        "Dusty: You can call it whatever you want. You're getting used.",
        "Emily: Dusty, please.",
        "Alison: Okay, good cop, bad cop, right? Actually, that was one of the titles of one of my movies. Okay, listen. I showed up in Las Vegas with a guy who told me he was going to take care of everything. And guess what? He lied. Just like Mom lies, and you lie, and everyone in Oakdale lies. Everyone said, just behave and we'll take care of you. But you step out of line, you offend somehow, and they pull the rug right out from under you. Do you have any idea what it's like to not be good enough for the Snyders?",
        "Emily: Alison --",
        "Alison: So like you say, I take off my clothes and I have sex in a camera -- in front of a camera. And that is a bad world, not a safe world. Maybe. But it's what it is and they don't pretend they're something they're not. Make all the smug comments you want. I'm in charge of my life and I like it like that.",
        "Dusty: Sounds familiar.",
        "Alison: Man, I really can't stand you. Okay, now I'm going to -- how do the ladies say it back in Oakdale? Freshen up. And when I get back, I'm leaving and the two of you are going to go home and stay. There. Oh, and Em? One more stunt like this and I'll call and tell Mom myself.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. Oh, God, Dusty, she is so lost.",
        "Dusty: Hey. Cry later. You got to keep it together. Emily, we're going to get her out of here.",

        "Jade: I have a very hard time seeing you as the answer to anybody's problems, let alone mine.",
        "Cleo: You know what? I knew from your webpage that you'd be pretty funny.",
        "Jade: Uh, yeah, I am pretty funny. And I'm also busy and waiting for somebody.",
        "Cleo: Me.",
        "Jade: You don't remotely resemble the girl that I'm looking for.",
        "Cleo: But I'm the one who responded to the ad. You know, to look like that girl.",
        "Jade: Okay, where do you come from?",
        "Cleo: Turlock, California.",
        "Jade: Okay, do they have mirrors there?",
        "Cleo: Of course they do.",
        "Jade: Yeah, you might want to go back to Turlock and take a look in one because you don't look anything like the girl in the picture.",
        "Cleo: You know what, we are not going to get very far with a negative attitude like that.",
        "Jade: You're right. We are not going to get very far. There's a whole hour of my life I'm not going to get back.",

        "[Margo laughs]",
        "Margo: That is just too weird, you offering me a cup of coffee. I'm still supposed to be opening your juice box. I spend a lot of time lately thinking about when you three boys were young.",
        "Will: I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: So I'm driving to work and I get a call on my cell phone and it's Adam, and he says, \"Hi, Mom,\" like I'm supposed to pick him up from soccer practice. I'm not handling this the way I really wanted to handle it. I'm sorry. I just really thought that you and Gwen deserve to know that Adam called.",
        "Will: Did he say where he is?",
        "Margo: No, he was very careful to keep it short, so I couldn't trace the call. So, obviously, he's still on the run.",
        "Will: I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, I tried to get him to come home, but he just hung up.",
        "Will: You know, that night when Jade and I wanted to tell you that Adam left, I told Jade that I wanted to be the one to talk to you because you've always been so fair to me. Just like now.",
        "Margo: I'm really very sorry for everything that my sons have put you and Gwen through.",
        "Will: And all that stuff that you said about being there, seeing me grow up and -- it means you were also there for the times that I really screwed up. And the good part about that is, is you know that people can change. Maybe Adam will later on.",
        "Margo: Thank for saying that. That's very nice.",
        "Will: Well, I owe you for a lot of juice boxes.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, it was my pleasure. So you'll tell Gwen that Adam called?",
        "Will: Yeah, I will.",

        "Maddie: He's upstairs. Gwen, what happened?",
        "Gwen: It's just that, you know, after everything that we've gone through, after everything that Will has gone through, it's over. And now I feel like I'm treating him like Adam.",
        "Maddie: Okay, don't underestimate Will. Don't think that he's not going to be understanding that it's going to take you a while to get over what Adam did to you.",
        "Gwen: No, I know, he said this morning that he understood. You know, that he could wait.",
        "Maddie: Then take his word for it. Listen, after what Louis did it me, I didn't think I was ever going to be able to be with Casey. I didn't trust anybody.",
        "Gwen: I don't know, I just feel like -- I feel like I'm pushing him away.",
        "Maddie: You're not. You're just not ready. If it's any help, it doesn't last forever.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, apparently.",
        "Maddie: Gwen, I never thought that I could be happy that way. I thought Louis ruined all of that for me. But with Casey, it's like I can just --",
        "Gwen: Uh-huh.",
        "Maddie: Do you -- do you think I'm doing something wrong?",
        "Gwen: No, I think you're doing something stupid. And Casey's under house arrest. You're a guest in his parents' home.",
        "Maddie: I know all that.",
        "Gwen: I just can't believe that you take such a huge chance.",
        "Maddie: Wow, I'm sorry. I didn't know I had to call you and clear everything first.",
        "Gwen: Well, I walked in on you, Maddie. I mean, what if it was Margo or Tom?",
        "Maddie: You know, Gwen, Casey can't leave this house. And we don't know how much time we have together until he has to go off to prison. And we've waited a very, very long time to be together, and you may be shocked to hear this, but yes, sometimes we get carried away. And after the year of hell that I have been through, I want to just -- I don't want to be smart or rational, I want to be in love with my boyfriend.",
        "Gwen: Well, did you use a condom?",
        "Maddie: Great. Great. I tell you I'm happy, I tell you I'm in love and I get a health class.",
        "Gwen: Well, did you?",
        "Maddie: I'm not stupid.",
        "Gwen: I didn't say that you were.",
        "Maddie: You know what? This summer, when I was trying to get over everything that happened -- did I ever lash out on you and Will? I hated myself for being jealous that you guys were so happy together. So, I did everything that I could to cover that up.",
        "Gwen: I know. I do know that, Maddie. Hey -- hey, I'm sorry.",
        "Maddie: Gwen, I understand that you are upset and I get it. But Casey and I -- I don't know how much time we have together. And I just want to be happy right now.",
        "Gwen: I really am -- I'm really sorry. [Cell phone rings] It's Will.",
        "Maddie: Talk to him. No. Actually, listen to him.",
        "Gwen: Hey, there.",
        "Will: Hey. How's it going with Casey and Maddie?",
        "Gwen: They seem great.",
        "Will: That's good, so -- maybe do you want to come home?",
        "Gwen: Why? Is something wrong?",
        "Will: It's just something I need to talk to you about.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, sure. I'll be right there. I got to go home.",
        "Maddie: Good. I'm glad you're going home. To Will.",
        "Gwen: Hey?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Are we still friends?",
        "Maddie: After everything that you've done for me, don't you think it's going to take a little bit more to change that?",
        "Gwen: You know, I really am happy for you.",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "Gwen: It's just we had to keep this really horrible secret for so long. And even though Adam is still alive, I can't stop looking over my shoulder. And I can't let go of this feeling that something really horrible is going to happen.",

        "Dusty: I don't know, but we can't let her leave.",
        "Emily: Well, we can't keep her here against her will, can we?",
        "Dusty: She doesn't have a will. She's not making decisions, she's \u0096",
        "Emily: She's what?",
        "Dusty: She's in more trouble than you thought.",

        "Jade: It's really irritating when people don't know when they're being pushy.",
        "Cleo: I can't believe it.",
        "Jade: What?",
        "Cleo: We have a place in Turlock that looks exactly like this.",
        "Jade: No --",
        "Cleo: Yeah, it has a different name, though.",
        "Jade: What are the chances of that?",
        "Cleo: I know. And that's exactly how I felt when I saw the picture of that girl on your webpage. I thought, what are the chances that someone is looking for someone who looks like someone, who happens to look exactly like me?",
        "Jade: Very, very slim.",
        "Cleo: I know. And you know what? It came at just the right time. Because I love Turlock --",
        "Jade: Who doesn't?",
        "Cleo: I mean, I guess you can say that's in my blood, but lately I've just been feeling like, I don't know, like maybe it's time to spread my wings and take flight --",
        "Jade: Oh, so you flew to Oakdale?",
        "Cleo: No, I took the bus. But I guess it's like that song says, you know, that like if I can make it here --",
        "Jade: Excuse me? What is your name?",
        "Cleo: Oh, my name is Cleo Babbitt.",
        "Jade: Okay, Cleo. Cleo Babbitt, you got to go home. You got to go home now.",
        "Cleo: Are you're trying to protect me, huh?",
        "Jade: No. I'm trying to get rid of you.",
        "Cleo: Because you know what? I'm a lot stronger than I look. And you don't have to worry about me. Oakdale, I'm going to lick you yet!",
        "Jade: Is there something in the water in Turlock?",
        "Cleo: Oh, no, no. That's just me. Everyone says I'm a little bit cuckoo. But anyways, I have like a million questions. And I guess that my A-number one question is why do you want to hire a look-alike?",
        "Jade: I don't anymore --",
        "Cleo: And then my B-number one question is when do I get to meet my twin?",
        "Jade: I can answer that. Never. Not in a million years.",

        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey. What did you want to talk to me about?",
        "Will: Um, nothing. Margo just came over.",
        "Gwen: Why?",
        "Will: She just wanted to say that Adam called her.",
        "Gwen: Oh. What did he say?",
        "Will: Nothing much really. I think he just called and said that he was okay. And then he hung up.",
        "Gwen: That's fine.",
        "Will: Well, I'm actually really glad that he called, aren't you? He kept his promise. And now Margo knows that he's okay.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I just don't understand why she felt like she needed to tell us that he called.",
        "Will: She feels terrible, Gwen. She came to say that he called and to say that she's really sorry for what he did to us.",
        "Gwen: But it's not like he's coming back --",
        "Will: No, he's not coming back. He's gone.",
        "Gwen: You don't know that, though. I mean, you don't know that for sure. He could be playing games. I mean, he loves playing games.",
        "Will: He's gone. And he's not coming back. Everyone's on him. You know that.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I know that. But I don't know that.",
        "Will: Well, I don't know what else to tell you except what I've already said. Which is its going to take time.",
        "Gwen: I know. Maddie said the same thing. It's just I get scared and then I get mad that I get scared, and I feel like Adam's still controlling me.",
        "Will: I could kill him for what he did to you. Okay, listen to me, okay? Pay attention. You are going to be fine. I promise you that. Think of everything that your mother has put you through. And look at where you are now. It's because you're so strong.",
        "Gwen: I don't feel strong.",
        "Will: You are. And you are going to get through this. And one morning you're going to wake up, and you're going to know that you have your life back.",

        "Jade: Cleo, you're taking the bus back to Turlock, you're not riding the midnight train to Georgia.",
        "Cleo: Jade, if you ever come to Turlock, you can always call me. Because I have lots of friends --",
        "Jade: Oh, Cleo. I will never, never be in Turlock. And the next time you get an urge to answer an e-mail like that, you might want to try e-mailing back and forth first before you jump on a bus.",
