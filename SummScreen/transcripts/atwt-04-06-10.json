        "Janet: So, what are you guys gonna do today?",
        "Liberty: I think I want to go out.",
        "Janet: Out? Where?",
        "Liberty: I thought maybe I'd stop by the high school, see some of my friends.",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, I know that you're feeling better, but your immune system is still very weak. I don't think it's a good idea for you to be around all those kids.",
        "Liberty: I was stuck in that bubble for weeks, Mom, and ever since I've been home, it's like I'm in another one.",
        "Janet: Okay, I know it's hard. But the treatments have made you very susceptible to germs.",
        "Liberty: Tell her it's cool if I go out.",
        "Janet: Oh, I'm sorry. Parker, when did you get your PhD in medicine? 'Cause I missed that.",
        "Parker: Look, I agree with you, okay?",
        "Liberty: That's it. You're dead to me. You're a serious traitor!",
        "Parker: What do you want me to say? Your mom's right.",
        "Janet: Thank you, Parker. Thank you very much. And I am counting on you to keep an eye on her, okay? I love you, Sweetie.",
        "Liberty: Love you, too. Free at last! Where should we go?",
        "Parker: We're not going anywhere.",
        "Liberty: You said you'd do anything for me, remember?",
        "Parker: Don't look at me like that.",
        "Liberty: Like what?",
        "Parker: Like that. It's not fair.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Ellis, will you please relax? Once we have the show in Milan, we'll have more investors than we know what to do with. If I tell you not to worry, then stop worrying. It's not even your money. Yes, I know it's not my money. Stop reminding me. I'm gonna have to call you back. What are you doing here?",
        "Gabriel: I work here.",
        "Craig: No you don't. I fired you.",
        "Gabriel: I got hired back.",
        "Craig: Not by me.",
        "Gabriel: No, by your partner. She was supposed to tell you about it.",
        "Craig: She can't do that.",
        "Gabriel: Well, she did. So where do you want me to start?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okay. I could have walked, you know. It's a beautiful day.",
        "Jack: I wanted us to have some time alone together. We haven't had much of that lately.",
        "Carly: No, we haven't. Okay. Well, thanks. I'll call you later.",
        "Jack: Wait. Hold on. You're five minutes early. You don't have to go just yet.",
        "Carly: No, stop it.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Carly: Because look where we are. We're supposed to be adults. We can't make out in a car like we're in high school.",
        "Jack: It's kind of fun.",
        "Carly: You have lost your mind.",
        "Jack: Maybe. Let me see what I can do about changing yours.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Jack: Ow. Ow.",
        "Carly: Are you having fun yet?",
        "Jack: Let's get in the back.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jack: I'll drive to the end of the lot. No one will see us.",
        "Carly: Absolutely not.",
        "Jack: Fine. Then we'll just make out.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: Sorry. I -- I have to go to work. It's not happening, Jack.",

        "Janet: Hi. They keep telling me that you can hear me, so I'm just gonna keep talking until you get sick me and tell me to shut up. [Janet sighs] Liberty wants to go to school and be with all her friends, but I think it's still too dangerous, and Parker agrees with me. You know, and I know she just wants to get her life back, and I don't blame her, but I'm just afraid that if she tries to be too normal, she's gonna -- okay, anyway -- now that Liberty's back, I need you back, too, okay? I need you back for us, for me and Liberty and the new little baby on the way. So what do you say? Are you ready to come home? Okay. Okay. Not yet. I brought you some new CDs. Dusty? Did you do that? Oh, my God, Dusty! Are you awake? You're awake! You came back to me. Oh, thank God. Hi, Sweetheart. Dusty, can you hear me?",
        "Dusty: Janet --",
        "Janet: Oh, yes, you're awake! Oh, thank God! I didn't think you were gonna wake up! Oh, my gosh, does it hurt? Can you -- can you talk more? Are you hungry? Okay. It's okay. You don't need to talk, all right? I'll be right back. I'm -- what? What is it, Sweetheart? What is it? Dusty? Dusty, no. No, no, no, no, no! Stay with me, please! Stay with me! Stay with me, Dusty! Come on, wake up! Help, help! He was just awake. He said my name, and then he passed out again! Please, please, please, you have to help him. Please help him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Are you sure you don't want to move the car and get in the back seat?",
        "Carly: We can't.",
        "Jack: Why not?",
        "Carly: Because we're adults.",
        "Jack: That's overrated.",
        "Carly: I agree, but we're stuck with it.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on. Let's get in the back seat.",
        "Carly: Okay. But you got to move the car first.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you got it.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Jack: No, no, no, no.",
        "Carly: Answer it, Jack. It could be important.",
        "Jack: Not to me.",
        "Carly: Oh. It's Janet.",
        "Jack: Hello, Janet. What's up?",
        "Janet: Jack, Dusty woke up. He said my name.",
        "Jack: That's great.",
        "Janet: I know, but then something happened, and he passed out again.",
        "Jack: Is Dr. Oliver there?",
        "Janet: No, Dr. Oliver's in surgery. There's another doctor in there with him, but I've never seen him before. I -- I don't know what's going on.",
        "Jack: Janet, I'm sure he's in good hands.",
        "Janet: I don't know what to do.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'll be right there.",
        "Janet: Okay, thank you.",
        "Jack: Dusty woke up and then passed out again. She's panicking.",
        "Carly: Well, you're -- you're right to go to her. She needs you.",
        "Jack: Carly, I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: Hey, look on the bright side. I think she just spared us from making complete fools of ourselves.",
        "Jack: I just want to be alone with you. Why is that suddenly so complicated?",
        "Carly: I feel the same way. But this is obviously not the right way to go about it. Maybe we have to wait till things settle down.",
        "Jack: Yeah? When's that gonna be?",
        "Carly: You should go. Janet's waiting. Keep me posted.",
        "Jack: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I just want to go do something normal.",
        "Parker: Watch TV.",
        "Liberty: Something normal outside. We'll just eat and go. Please.",
        "Parker: Don't do that.",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Parker: Say please like that.",
        "Liberty: Please. You know you can't resist me.",
        "Parker: And you know you're not supposed to be anywhere near germs.",
        "Liberty: Germs are everywhere. Do you know there are millions of germs inside our bodies? I could sit here all day and catch something from you.",
        "Parker: You're right.",
        "Liberty: Really?",
        "Parker: Yes, we should probably sit in separate rooms.",
        "Liberty: That's not what I meant.",
        "Parker: Look, your mom doesn't want you anywhere near other people.",
        "Liberty: I've been trapped in a baggie for weeks. I just want to go out and get some fresh air. I promise nothing will happen.",
        "Parker: Okay. I guess we can go for a walk.",
        "Liberty: Then French fries?",
        "Parker: Sure. Sure, but we have to stop somewhere first.",
        "Liberty: Okay. You're the best! [Laughs]",
        "Parker: You probably shouldn't be doing that.",
        "Liberty: So, let go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Yes, Carly and I are partners, but she's strictly creative. I run the business side, and that includes personnel.",
        "Gabriel: Because it's all your money?",
        "Craig: That's none of your business.",
        "Gabriel: [Scoffs] Just saying.",
        "Craig: All you need to concern yourself with is that I don't want you here -- I'd advise you not to push me.",
        "Gabriel: What are you gonna tell her, the handyman is some kind of industrial spy?",
        "Craig: What I tell her is none of your business.",
        "Gabriel: Or you're worried I'm gonna find out you got something to hide?",
        "Craig: That's it. Get out now.",
        "Carly: What's going on?",
        "Gabriel: Uh, your partner here just fired me again.",
        "Carly: Ah. Well, then, I just rehired you again.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Carly: Because I want him to work here.",
        "Craig: You don't know a damn thing about him.",
        "Carly: I know that he's handy, and I need somebody handy. In fact, that outlet is acting kind of funny again, Gabriel.",
        "Gabriel: I'll get right on that.",
        "Craig: No, you won't. Carly, you really don't know anything about him. What if he has a record? What if he's on drugs? We don't have any references on him.",
        "Carly: [Sighs] Gabriel, have you ever been arrested?",
        "Gabriel: Uh, never convicted.",
        "Carly: You, uh, do drugs?",
        "Gabriel: Not today.",
        "Carly: Any references?",
        "Gabriel: Well, I was very popular in high school.",
        "Carly: Good enough for me.",
        "Craig: What if he's lying?",
        "Carly: Well, then, he'll feel nice and at home with you.",
        "Craig: You know, everything I've done here is for you.",
        "Carly: No, I don't know that, but I do intend to find out.",
        "Craig: What does that mean?",
        "Carly: It means that I want to know everything about this business -- where the money's coming from, where it's going, everything.",
        "Craig: That's ridiculous.",
        "Carly: Well, it might be, if I trusted you. But I don't, so I want to see all of the financial records for Monte Carlo right now.",
        "Craig: Fine. If it means so much to you to have him working here, he can work here. But you stay out of my way.",
        "Gabriel: Yes, Boss.",
        "Carly: I still want to see the books.",
        "Craig: Why? I put my own money into this business. Do you think I'd cheat myself?",
        "Carly: Are we partners or are we not?",
        "Craig: Yes, we are partners. But you should concentrate on the creative side. I'll deal with the business side. That way you can keep making up those beautiful designs.",
        "Carly: Ah, you mean I shouldn't worry my pretty little head with all those numbers?",
        "Craig: I never said anything like that.",
        "Gabriel: Actually, yes, you did.",
        "Craig: Who asked you?",
        "Carly: He's right.",
        "Craig: Carly, if -- if you want to be my partner, you have to trust me.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't know if I want to be your partner, and I know I certainly don't trust you. But this is my only choice to work unless I want to sit around, wondering what's become of my life.",
        "Craig: Carly, everything's gonna work out. Can't we all just get along?",
        "Carly: Oh, we can get along -- after I see the books.",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Carly: Oh, hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Parker: Liberty wanted to see the office.",
        "Liberty: No, I wanted to go to Al's, but Parker was worried there'd be too many germs there.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, I think it's great that you're both here. Tell you what, why don't you show Liberty around. And then afterwards, I bet she'd love to see what you've been working on.",
        "Liberty: That'd be cool -- if you don't mind.",
        "Carly: No. No, of course I don't mind. Come on.",
        "Liberty: You coming?",
        "Parker: Well, it's not that I don't love fashion, but I'll let you two have one of those girl moments.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Parker: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You all right?",
        "Janet: I was for about 20 seconds.",
        "Jack: And what did the doctor say?",
        "Janet: Nothing yet. It was awful, Jack. One minute he was there. He was with me. And then the next minute, he was out.",
        "Jack: Listen, the stress is dangerous. You got to try and calm down.",
        "Janet: I know. I'm -- I'm trying.",
        "Jack: I know you are. Why don't we go sit down, okay?",
        "Janet: Doctor, Doctor, how is he? Is he okay?",
        "Doctor: He's doing well.",
        "Janet: Well, I don't get it. One minute he was awake, and the next minute he was unconscious again.",
        "Doctor: That's a normal part of recovery after a severe trauma.",
        "Janet: So -- I mean, is he -- is he talking? Is he awake? Can I talk to him?",
        "Doctor: Sure, but he might not be able to respond.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Rocco: Hey, Janet.",
        "Janet: Pop.",
        "Jack: I'm, uh -- I'm gonna go talk to Dusty, okay?",
        "Janet: Okay. I'll be right there. I'll be right there. Thank God you're here, Dad.",
        "Rocco: Did, uh -- did Jack say he's going to speak to Dusty?",
        "Janet: He regained consciousness.",
        "Rocco: Really?",
        "Janet: Yeah. I mean, one minute he was awake, and the next minute, he was -- he was out.",
        "Rocco: That's great. Has he said anything about what happened?",
        "Janet: Well, no, not -- not to me. But -- but Jack just went in there. I'm sure that he'll ask him who shot him.",
        "Rocco: Jack shouldn't be grilling him, not now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: I work here. Is that -- is that all right with you?",
        "Parker: What if it isn't?",
        "Craig: Can't say I'm thrilled about it myself.",
        "Parker: Well, then, why is he here?",
        "Craig: Because your mother hired him.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Gabriel: What is your problem, man?",
        "Craig: Listen, do yourself a favor. Ignore him.",
        "Gabriel: Good idea.",
        "Craig: So, Liberty looks good.",
        "Parker: Yeah. She really shouldn't be around people, though. In fact, her mom's probably gonna kill me if she finds out that I let her out of the house.",
        "Craig: Eh, maybe, but I can understand why she'd want to get out.",
        "Parker: Yeah. I mean, she wanted to go to Al's, but I thought that maybe if I brought her here first, she'd get tired and then want to go home.",
        "Liberty: Parker, you've got to see the rest of this place. It's amazing.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] I told Liberty when she's ready, I could really use an intern.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I would love to, but I'm afraid they're gonna want me back in Minnesota. Even though I promised to continue my treatments here, I think my doctors there still want to be in charge.",
        "Parker: What if I used my trust fund to bring the doctors here?",
        "Craig: What are you talking about?",
        "Parker: Well, I've been thinking about it, and that way you wouldn't have to go back to the hospital.",
        "Liberty: You can't do that.",
        "Parker: Why not?",
        "Liberty: That would be like the longest house call in the history of the world.",
        "Parker: So?",
        "Liberty: So it would cost a fortune.",
        "Parker: And I have a fortune, and it's just sitting around.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but I'm not gonna let you blow it on me.",
        "Parker: I don't think anyone would consider this blowing it. And I can do this, can't I?",
        "Craig: Liberty's right. It would be extremely expensive.",
        "Parker: Sure, but it's my money.",
        "Craig: I just think you should think about it first.",
        "Parker: I have thought about it, and I want to do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Jack's not gonna give him the third degree!",
        "Rocco: I -- I just think it's a bad idea, that's all. Revenge would be nice. Don't get me wrong. But what counts is for Dusty to get better so he can make a good life with you.",
        "Janet: And what if the guy who did this to him decides to come back?",
        "Rocco: That won't happen.",
        "Janet: How do you know?",
        "Rocco: I don't. But it wouldn't make sense for a mugger to come back a second time.",
        "Janet: Okay, anyway, it -- it doesn't matter, Pop, okay? Jack's a good detective, right? He knows how to question a witness.",
        "Rocco: Yeah. I'm sure he does.",
        "Jack: I don't want to wear you out or anything, Dusty, but is there you can tell me about how you got shot?",
        "Dusty: I don't remember.",
        "Jack: Okay. The video from Metro's security camera shows you talking to a guy who's got a gun on you. But the camera shows him from the back. We can't make out his face.",
        "Dusty: I don't know.",
        "Jack: Well, see if you can remember this, okay? You offered the guy your wallet, and he refused it. Then you went on talking again. After that, you lunged at him, you struggled for a bit, and then he shot you. Do you remember what you were talking about?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Jack: Think. Think, okay? Think back to that night. Is there anything you can tell me about the guy who shot you, anything at all? Dusty, is there anything you remember about the shooting at all?",
        "Dusty: Sorry.",
        "Janet: Okay, that's enough, Jack. He needs to rest.",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay.",
        "Rocco: He remember anything?",
        "Jack: Not yet.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Rocco: I'll take this outside.",
        "Dusty: Janet --",
        "Janet: Yeah. I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. How do you feel?",
        "Dusty: I'm tired.",
        "Janet: Okay. Then you just need to close your eyes and get some rest, all right?",
        "Dusty: I want to look at you.",
        "Jack: Janet, I got to ask him just a few more questions, please.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no. No, no, it's enough for now, Jack.",
        "Jack: Listen, the longer we wait, the less likely we are to find the shooter.",
        "Janet: Okay, then we don't.",
        "Jack: Janet --",
        "Janet: No, Jack! I said no. He needs to get his strength back. His recovery is the most important thing.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Rocco: I'm telling you, Ralph, I saw him just now. He doesn't remember a thing. No, listen to me. You don't have to do that. He isn't a problem. I -- I think that's the right way to go. Thank you. Yeah, I'll call you if anything happens. Right now, the best thing for you to do is leave him alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Parker, we all want to do everything we can to help Liberty, but do you really think this is the best way to do that?",
        "Parker: She wants to be here, not in Minneapolis, and I have the money to make that happen, so I don't see a problem.",
        "Craig: We've had this discussion before.",
        "Parker: Yes, and before you were right. Now it's different.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm not saying that it isn't.",
        "Parker: Well, what are you saying?",
        "Craig: Carly, what do you think?",
        "Carly: I think that it's Parker's money, so it's Parker's call.",
        "Liberty: It isn't his call. It's mine.",
        "Parker: Liberty --",
        "Liberty: No. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but you can't make a decision like this for me.",
        "Parker: Well, I just thought that since I have the money --",
        "Liberty: It isn't about the money, Parker.",
        "Parker: Yeah, it is.",
        "Liberty: No, it's about my treatment, and that's up to my doctors, not you.",
        "Parker: But you hated being in Minneapolis.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I did, but you didn't ask me. You just decided for me.",
        "Parker: I just thought it's what you wanted.",
        "Liberty: All I want is a burger at Al's. And I'm gonna go get it by myself.",
        "Parker: You can't --",
        "Liberty: Parker, I need some time alone, okay? I'll call you when I'm done.",
        "Carly: No, no, no, no. Let her go, Parker. She just said she wanted to be alone. You have to respect that.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, outlet's fixed.",
        "Carly: Great.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, you mind if I take lunch?",
        "Craig: Take a week if you like.",
        "Gabriel: I only need an hour.",
        "Parker: I know I'm being really overprotective of Liberty, but I'm just scared for her.",
        "Carly: I know you are. But you can't protect her from this sickness. You can just help her deal with it her way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: Hey, hey, are you okay?",
        "Liberty: Fine. I'm just dizzy.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, come here. Have a seat.",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, you want a water? I actually have an unopened one.",
        "Liberty: You don't mind?",
        "Gabriel: No, not at all.",
        "Liberty: Thank you.",
        "Gabriel: You okay?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I don't know what happened.",
        "Gabriel: Just as long as you're all right.",
        "Liberty: I am. But I want to pay you for the water, because -- wait, I know you. You were just at Monte Carlo.",
        "Gabriel: Right, I work there. My name's Gabriel.",
        "Liberty: I'm Liberty.",
        "Gabriel: I actually picked that up.",
        "Liberty: So did they tell you to follow me?",
        "Gabriel: Well, if they had said to, uh, I might have said no. I mean, I'm on my lunch break.",
        "Liberty: Well, I don't want to keep you, so, um, I still have a couple dollars in my pocket.",
        "Gabriel: No, really, it's all right. Keep your money. I actually overheard what you were talking about. Um, sounds like you got dealt a pretty bad hand.",
        "Liberty: I'm doing all right.",
        "Gabriel: That's good. You seem different from the rest of them.",
        "Liberty: What do you mean?",
        "Gabriel: They all act like they -- I don't know, someone owes them or something. But you don't seem like that.",
        "Liberty: My mom had me when she was a teenager. Money was never something we had a lot of, so -- you know, it was just us till I met my dad a couple years ago.",
        "Gabriel: He blew you off?",
        "Liberty: No, not at all. He didn't know he had a kid till I showed up here. But he was totally great. That's why we stayed.",
        "Gabriel: Well, its good you guys found each other again. What's he doing now?",
        "Liberty: He was killed last year. He was shot. It was before I got sick.",
        "Gabriel: Wow. Uh, I'm really sorry.",
        "Liberty: Thanks. But, you know, aside from that and having no hair, everything's great.",
        "Gabriel: And you got a pretty cool hat.",
        "Liberty: Right.",
        "Gabriel: Sounds like you've been through a lot.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but, you know -- how are you? How'd you end up at Monte Carlo?",
        "Gabriel: Uh, Ms. Tenney hired me, and then, uh, this Craig guy fired me, and then she went ahead and rehired me again.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, that sounds like them.",
        "Gabriel: I mean, I know they're partners, but they seem like a bitter, old married couple or something.",
        "Liberty: They were almost married once, but then Carly went away for a while and Craig started sleeping with her sister. And he was actually married to her before.",
        "Gabriel: Well, that might explain why your, uh, boyfriend is wrapped so tight.",
        "Liberty: Parker's not really my boyfriend. I mean, we were married, but now we're just friends.",
        "Gabriel: Well, I take it back then. I think you fit right in.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Parker: What are you doing here?",
        "Liberty: We're talking. This is Gabriel.",
        "Parker: Yeah, we've already met. I -- I thought you wanted to get a burger.",
        "Liberty: I do.",
        "Parker: Let's go.",
        "Liberty: You're doing it again.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Liberty: Not letting me breathe.",
        "Parker: Well, it's cold outside.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, Dude, I think she wants you to back off.",
        "Parker: Did I ask you?",
        "Gabriel: No, but I'm just saying.",
        "Parker: Well, don't just say anything.",
        "Liberty: Parker --",
        "Parker: No, trust me, you really don't want to deal with this guy.",
        "Gabriel: [Laughs] You have a problem with me or something?",
        "Parker: Yeah. As a matter of fact I do. So why don't you just get out of here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: All right, I'm gonna take off. Call me if you need me, okay?",
        "Janet: I will, thank you.",
        "Rocco: You don't have to worry. I'll be right here.",
        "Jack: Good. I'll see you later. [Clears throat] Hey, it's me.",
        "Carly: How is he?",
        "Jack: Better. Conscious, but weak. Doctor says he's gonna be okay. Doesn't remember a thing about the shooting, though.",
        "Carly: Are you coming back?",
        "Jack: Actually, I was gonna stop by the station and put together some mug shots, bring them back here, see if Dusty recognizes anybody. Unless you need me for something.",
        "Carly: Jack, I know you want to catch whoever did this. But maybe you ought to give Dusty and Janet a little space.",
        "Jack: I'm doing my job.",
        "Carly: Maybe you're too close to it. Isn't there anybody else on the force who could handle this case?",
        "Jack: Is there a problem?",
        "Carly: No. I just -- no. It's fine. Do whatever you have to do.",
        "Jack: Well, don't worry. I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, I'd be glad to get lost if Liberty tells me to.",
        "Parker: That's funny, because I'm telling you to.",
        "Gabriel: Well, the thing is, you're -- you're not a cop, and you're not my boss, so what you want doesn't really concern me.",
        "Liberty: Let's all calm down, all right?",
        "Parker: No, let's get out of here, Liberty. You shouldn't be out in the cold this long anyway.",
        "Gabriel: Fresh air is not gonna make her cancer any worse.",
        "Liberty: I didn't say I had cancer.",
        "Gabriel: I -- I mean, I just assumed because of losing your hair and the dizziness.",
        "Parker: You -- you got dizzy?",
        "Liberty: I'm fine. Thanks for the water.",
        "Gabriel: No problem.",
        "Liberty: What's your problem with him?",
        "Parker: It's a long story. Still want that burger?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. I'm kind of tired.",
        "Parker: You want me to make you something back at the house?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Sure. That sounds good.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I wouldn't put this on a dog.",
        "Craig: How's it going?",
        "Carly: I got nothing.",
        "Craig: Oh, it will come.",
        "Carly: Not today. I am completely distracted.",
        "Craig: Hmm. Jack?",
        "Carly: And Liberty and Dusty.",

        "Carly: You just asked me to lunch.",
        "Craig: Oh. [Carly laughs] That's right. I'm -- I'm sorry. I -- I forgot.",
        "Carly: That's okay. I'll come along, too, and the three of us can go over the finances.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, you know, I --",
        "Messenger: Carly Tenney?",
        "Carly: Yeah, it's me.",
        "Messenger: Here you go.",

        "Craig: What is it?",
        "Carly: Enjoy your lunch with Ellis. I just got a much better offer.",

        "Gabriel: Oh, God! Ex -- excuse me. I'm so sorry. I was not looking where I was going.",
        "Ellis: No, you weren't.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, I -- I am so sorry. Uh, look, I'll give you my info, and you can send me the cleaning bill.",
        "Ellis: Don't worry about it.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, again, really sorry.",
        "Ellis: It's okay. Just watch where you're going next time, all right?",
        "Gabriel: You bet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey.",
        "Dusty: You look stressed out.",
        "Janet: Thank you. Thank you so much. It's probably because I've been sitting here for days waiting for you to wake up.",
        "Dusty: Sorry about that.",
        "Janet: How do you feel?",
        "Dusty: I'm not dead. I'm not, am I?",
        "Janet: Oh, no. I'm so relieved that you're not.",
        "Dusty: Sorry I worried you.",
        "Janet: Honey, don't worry about me, okay? I'm just so glad to have you back. I never knew how much I was gonna need you until I almost lost you.",
        "Dusty: How's Liberty?",
        "Janet: Oh, she's okay. She's getting better. The treatments are working. She's actually home with me now.",
        "Dusty: She is? That's incredible.",
        "Janet: I know.",
        "Dusty: Tell her I said so.",
        "Janet: I will.",
        "Dusty: See? I told you so. Everything's gonna be okay.",
        "Janet: Now it will.",
        "Dusty: How are you? How are you and the baby?",
        "Janet: We're fine.",
        "Dusty: Sorry I can't be more help.",
        "Janet: Don't worry about it. I'll make you make it up to me, 'cause you promised me the rest of your life. I'm gonna hold you to that, okay?",
        "Dusty: You bet.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rocco: Doctor, excuse me. Dusty Donovan -- uh, he seems really confused about everything. He can't even remember what happened to him.",
        "Doctor: Well, initial memory loss is normal, but it could come back.",
        "Rocco: Could? You mean it might not?",
        "Doctor: It's common not to remember a severe trauma.",
        "Rocco: Like getting shot? Better for him not to remember? Thanks, Doc.",

        "Carly: What is all this?",
        "Jack: What does it look like?",
        "Carly: Uh, a seduction.",
        "Jack: Exactly. I wanted you to know that no matter how many distractions we have in our lives, we'll always come up with time for where nothing else matters except us.",
        "Carly: This is so romantic. I can't believe you did this.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I surprised myself.",

        "Gabriel: Uh, what's that?",
        "Craig: [Sighs] First of all, I told Carly I was having lunch with you. So if she asks, back me up.",
        "Gabriel: Okay.",
        "Craig: Okay. The problem is she wants to see the books. Ever since she found out I lied about that investor, she's been suspicious. Now she wants to see everything -- receipts, payables, profits and loss -- the whole enchilada.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, okay.",
        "Craig: How can that be okay? We can't let her find out that I used Parker's trust to finance Monte Carlo.",
        "Gabriel: R -- right.",
        "Craig: All right. Here's what I need you to do. I need you to cook up a new, clean set of books. That way she can sit there and crunch the numbers all she wants until the cows come home. Can you do that?",
        "Gabriel: I'm not sure.",
        "Craig: I know it's illegal. I don't have any choice. And there's a big bonus in it for you.",
        "Gabriel: All right.",
        "Craig: Good. I need it by tomorrow. Can you do that?",
        "Gabriel: Sure.",

        "Dusty: What about you? Are you tired?",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, you just worry about yourself right now.",
        "Dusty: I promised you to always take care of you, didn't I?",
        "Janet: Well, okay, then. If you really mean that, I need some furniture moved.",
        "Dusty: That's got to wait.",
        "Janet: I know. Oh, Honey, don't worry about me. I am so happy right now. I have you back, and Liberty's home.",
        "Dusty: Where are you staying?",
        "Janet: Carly's.",
        "Dusty: You okay there?",
        "Janet: Yeah, sure. Pbht! You know, it's a little awkward, but she's been nice. And, you know, it's really good that Liberty has Parker around.",
        "Dusty: What about Jack?",
        "Janet: He's been great. He's doing everything he can to find who did this to you.",
        "Dusty: I wish I could help him.",
        "Janet: Don't worry about that. That's what Jack does best. Oh. And I got my Pop here with me.",
        "Rocco: How you doing?",
        "Dusty: Been better. [Remembering]",
        "Rocco: We got lucky.",
        "Dusty: You've got Ralph Manzo greasing your palm so he can use your store for shenanigans. Isn't that right?",
        "Rocco: You think I'm scared of you or something?",
        "Dusty: I could call Jack, put you in a cell right next to Ralphie.",

        "Carly: I can't believe you did all this for me.",
        "Jack: Well, you made it clear the car wouldn't do it for you, so I had to come up with something else. My -- my one regret is that took me long to come up with this.",
        "Carly: You've got a lot on your mind.",
        "Jack: It's no excuse. You're the most important thing in my life. I want you to know that.",

        "Jack: I'm gonna make sure you never feel that way again. Well, you've been great about letting them stay with you.",
        "Carly: Well, I like to be around when you're with her so I can keep an eye on you.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: You know you've got nothing to worry about there.",
