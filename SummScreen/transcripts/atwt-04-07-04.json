        "Holden: For you. ",
        "Lily: Oh. Wow. What's the occasion? ",
        "Holden: The benefit for the Rose Foundation was a huge success. ",
        "Lily: Do I have to share these with Dusty? ",
        "Holden: Ah, no. You were the star of the show. ",
        "Lily: Oh. ",
        "Holden: And the audience loved it. ",
        "Lily: They were being polite. ",
        "Holden: No. You knocked 'em dead, and I am very, very proud of you, so stop \r\nbeing so modest and say thank you. ",
        "Lily: Thank you. ",
        "Holden: That's better. Now -- we're alone, kids are asleep -- and it's been a \r\nvery long time since I kissed you by candlelight. ",
        "",
        "Rosanna: Well, some men wear a tuxedo. Others, the tuxedo wears them. You, \r\napparently, were born to it. ",
        "Jordan: Let's just say, in my business, it's not to hard to find a decent \r\ntailor on short notice. ",
        "Rosanna: And what was the occasion? Or are you just trying to make the rest \r\nof us feel underdressed? ",
        "Jordan: I was at a benefit for the Rose Foundation. ",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes, I heard about that. You never got a chance to meet Rose, \r\ndid you? ",
        "Jordan: No. No. But I -- I heard some pretty great things about her tonight. \r\nIt was -- it was quite a party. ",
        "Rosanna: So tell me -- in the heat of your busy social life, did you have a \r\nchance to think about my job offer? ",
        "Jennifer: Ah, sorry it took me so long. I had some messages I -- oh, hello, \r\nRosanna. ",
        "Rosanna: Hello, Jennifer. You look lovely. ",
        "Jennifer: Thank you. Jordan and I were just at the benefit -- ",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes, yes. I heard all about that. And a good time was had by \r\nall. ",
        "Jennifer: It was quite enjoyable. ",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's a very diplomatic view. ",
        "Jennifer: And your point? ",
        "Rosanna: Considering the way Rose died, I would imagine you wouldn't want to \r\nbe around her family and friends. ",
        "Jennifer: Yes, at first I didn't want to go. But then Jordan said that it \r\nwould be a gesture of goodwill, and he was right. ",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's no surprise. Jordan's one of those guys who always \r\nseems to make the right decision. ",
        "Jordan: Would you like to join us? We're gonna have one more drink before we \r\ncall it a night. ",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thanks. But I -- I have a really busy morning. It was good to \r\nsee you both. Good night. ",
        "Jordan: Good night. ",

        "Rosanna: Craig, it's Rosanna. Can you meet me at my suite? I need to see you \r\nright away. ",
        "Craig: Everything okay? ",
        "Rosanna: Just get there as soon as you can. Okay? ",
        "Craig: All right. ",

        "Mike: What are you doing? ",
        "Katie: Mike, I -- I didn't know it was you. ",
        "Henry: It wasn't. I mean, when did you get here? ",
        "Mike: Well, I have the same question for you, Henry. And you, too. ",
        "Katie: We were -- on assignment. ",
        "Henry: Right. That's -- we were on assignment. ",
        "Mike: For what? ",
        "Henry: For -- what? ",
        "Mike: You followed me here, didn't you? ",
        "Katie: No. Honest. ",
        "Pilar: If you didn't follow him, then they must've followed me. ",
        "Mike: Is that true? ",
        "Pilar: Oh, my god! This means he can find me, too. ",
        "Mike: No. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. I won't let \r\nanything happen to you. ",
        "Katie: All right, I know you're in here. You might as well just show your \r\nface. All right, you asked for it. Aha! Aha! Okay. All right, where is he? ",
        "Mike: Where's who? ",
        "Katie: The guy that she is in cahoots with. The guy that was here before you \r\nshowed up. What did you do? Throw him out the window the minute Mike got here?\r\n",
        "Pilar: You're crazy. I was alone until Mike found me. ",
        "Katie: Don't lie to me. I know for a fact that the same guy I saw you with in \r\ntown was -- ",
        "Mike: Stop, stop, stop, stop! I can't stand seeing you like this. ",
        "Katie: Like what? ",
        "Mike: You're making a fool of yourself. I mean, haven't you done enough damage? Do you have to keep making it \r\nworse? ",
        "Henry: Mike, I'm not going to stand here and let you treat Katie with \r\ndisrespect. ",
        "Mike: Fine. Get out. ",
        "Katie: No, stay right where you are. Don't let him talk to you like that. \r\nLook, I don't blame you for being surprised that Henry and I are here. But, as \r\nsoon as he found out that Pilar was registered at this motel -- ",
        "Mike: Stop -- I still don't know what you think Pilar's done to me. ",
        "Katie: Try playing you for a sucker since the minute she hit town. ",
        "Mike: Okay, you're so sure she's gonna hurt me. You tell me what you think \r\nshe's gonna do. ",
        "Katie: Well, she's the only one who can answer that question. But let me tell \r\nyou something -- she is setting you up for something, Mike. Why can't you see \r\nthat? ",
        "Mike: You want me to see things through your eyes? Well, I don't. What I see \r\nis this woman who used to have so much to offer turning into this obsessive \r\ncompulsive, inconsiderate little girl. ",
        "Henry: I'm sorry, Mike, but no one insults Katie in my presence. ",
        "Mike: I swear, Henry, if you say one more word to me, I will bury you. ",
        "Henry: Then again, I think he needs to get this off his chest. ",
        "Katie: All right. What about the guy I saw her in town with when she was \r\nsupposed to be sick as a dog in bed? Did she explain to you why she snuck out of \r\nyour house to go meet him? ",
        "Mike: Yes. ",
        "Katie: She did? ",
        "Pilar: Surprised? ",
        "Katie: Only if it was the truth. ",
        "Mike: Look, the guy's an ex-boyfriend of Pilar's -- ",
        "Pilar: Mike, no! ",
        "Mike: He's an ex-boyfriend of Pilar's who's threatened to kill her. I'm \r\ntrying to make sure that doesn't happen, but you keep getting in my way. ",
        "Pilar: I wish you hadn't said that. ",
        "Mike: Look, I had to. All right? Maybe now Katie will have the sense to leave \r\nyou alone. Look, I want your word, and yours, you're not going to tell anybody \r\nwhere she's staying. ",
        "Katie: How can you ask me to do that, Mike? It's playing right into her \r\nhands. ",
        "Mike: If you don't, someone's life could be in danger. Is that what you want?\r\n",
        "Katie: No. All right, fine, I won't tell anyone where Pilar's staying. ",
        "Henry: All right, me, too. Scout's honor. ",
        "Mike: Good. Get out. ",
        "Pilar: I don't care what they say, Michael. I still don't trust them. ",
        "Katie: What a coincidence. I feel the exact same way about you. ",
        "Henry: You know, Katie -- she's not a very good loser. ",
        "Pilar: No matter what I do, this just keeps getting worse. I promised myself \r\nI wouldn't get you involved in this, Michael, and that's exactly what I've done. \r\nIf anything happens to you, I'll never forgive myself. ",
        "",
        "Lily: Well, it has been a long time. ",
        "Holden: I always knew that we would find our way back to each other. Because \r\nno matter what happens, that's what we do. ",
        "Lily: Oh, I've missed you so much. You're my lover, my partner, friend, my \r\nwhole life. ",
        "Singer: That's why I need you to hear\r\nI found the reason for me to change who I used to be \r\na reason to start over new and the reason is you \r\nand the reason is you and the reason is you ",

        "Jordan: Jen, I know we haven't known each other that long. But if something's \r\non your mind, I'd be happy to listen. ",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. Maybe it's nothing. I just feel like Rosanna's been \r\nacting really funny around me lately. ",
        "Jordan: Funny, how? ",
        "Jennifer: I feel like she resents me or doesn't like me. It's crazy, right?\r\n",
        "Jordan: Well, I don't know. ",
        "Jennifer: Why? Has she said anything to you? ",
        "Jordan: No. But we both know how she feels about Paul. Maybe she's projecting \r\nsome of that onto you? ",
        "Jennifer: Well, do you think I should talk to her? ",
        "Jordan: What would you say? ",
        "Jennifer: Paul and I are two different people. ",
        "Jordan: Yeah, thank god for that. ",
        "Jennifer: Excuse me? ",
        "Jordan: Come on, Jen, we both know that Paul's not the easiest guy in the \r\nworld to warm up to. ",
        "Jennifer: Maybe not for you, but there are plenty of people who feel very \r\nclose to him. ",
        "Jordan: He was supposed to be Rosanna's friend. He hurt her. He was engaged \r\nto Rose D'Angelo, he humiliated her. ",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, you were not even here. You're just talking about what \r\npeople have told you. ",
        "Jordan: Are you saying that it's not true? No, you can't. Because, \r\nunfortunately, it is true. Paul happens to be one of those people who -- ",
        "Jennifer: He happens to be my brother. And I will not tolerate you, or anyone \r\nelse, talking against him while I'm around. ",

        "Craig: You know, it's funny, I just ran into Jack and Carly, and, wouldn't \r\nyou know it, your name came up. ",
        "Rosanna: How nice. ",
        "Craig: No interest in what we were saying? ",
        "Rosanna: Not in the slightest. I handed you divorce papers last night. Have \r\nyou had a chance to look at them? ",
        "Craig: You know, I'd like a drink. Hmm? No reason we can't be civil, is \r\nthere? ",
        "Rosanna: Bar's right over there. ",
        "Craig: Ah -- what a day, what a day. You know, those bulbs you planted by the \r\ngazebo are coming up early this spring. ",
        "Rosanna: You know, I'm -- I'm putting things in business terms, because I \r\nfeel at this point that there is nothing else between us. So, I've made a \r\nproposal. I would very much like your response. ",
        "Craig: Ah, yes, what you would like. I've been thinking about that quite a \r\nbit. ",
        "Rosanna: And -- ? Are you going to sign the divorce papers? ",

        "Pilar: This is a disaster! Katie and her friend know where I'm staying. Margo \r\nknows that my ex is after me. By tomorrow, it'll be a headline in the newspaper.\r\n",
        "Mike: Come on, that's not going to happen. ",
        "Pilar: He's going to find me, mike. And when he does -- you have no idea how \r\ncruel he can be. ",
        "Mike: Look, Margo's a cop. Okay, you should be glad she's in your corner. And \r\nif Katie gave her word, she'll keep quiet, she will. She's not going to give you \r\naway. ",
        "Pilar: Katie's word means nothing! If she gets the chance, she'll do anything \r\nto get rid of me. ",
        "Mike: That's not true. All right, she can be reckless, but she would never \r\nhurt anyone on purpose. ",
        "Pilar: You still have faith in her? After everything she's done? ",
        "Mike: I know her heart. She's a good person. She just gets a little ahead of \r\nherself sometimes, that's all. ",
        "Pilar: Maybe I should leave tonight instead of tomorrow. ",
        "Mike: I already told you, you're coming home with me. ",

        "Pilar: I've had so many bad things happen to me over the last few years. I \r\nlost faith, Michael. I stopped believing that there could be good in anyone's \r\nheart. But now that you're back in my life -- you remind me that there's \r\nkindness in the world. Thank you for that. ",
        "Mike: Any time. ",

        "",
        "Katie: How could this have happened, Henry? You saw Pilar's new boyfriend go \r\ninto that motel room, and then Mike comes out? ",
        "Henry: All right, I think I have an explanation. ",
        "Katie: I hope so. ",
        "Henry: I know for a fact that I saw the guy from the sketch go into Pilar's \r\nroom. So, he must've left when I went to get the phone from the manager. ",
        "Katie: And then Mike shows up in a matter of minutes? ",
        "Henry: I don't know. Can you think of anything else? ",
        "Katie: No, that must've been it. ",
        "Henry: All right, that was a tough break, but at least we know that Pilar's a \r\nphony. ",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, that was the easy part. The hard part is gonna be \r\nconvincing Mike. ",
        "Henry: Now, listen, are you willing to tell Mike everything I told you, hmm? \r\nAbout the sketch, the phone call, all the details? ",
        "Katie: No, 'cause he's gonna be so mad that I went investigating with all \r\nthat stuff, especially after he and Margo told me to stay out of it. ",
        "Henry: Yeah, but now we have results. And when we show him the results, Pilar \r\nwill be gone. ",
        "Katie: No, it's too late, Henry. He's all into protecting her. Needy women \r\nare Mike's weakness. ",
        "Henry: Alas, many of us have the same affliction. ",
        "Katie: And Pilar must've known that, which is why she knew her plan would \r\nwork! She didn't count on me, and I'm not giving up. ",

        "Katie: He'll thank us later. ",

Ever since I was a little girl, he's been like a god to \r\nme. So, maybe I am a little more sensitive than I should be. But that's just the \r\nway it is, and you're just going to have to accept it. You think I'm crazy. ",

        "Lily: Thank you. And, you know, there are lots of ways for us to spend some \r\nquality time together without going away. ",

        "Jordan: Do you want me to set up a meeting with Rosanna? Maybe it's better if \r\nyou speak to her yourself. ",
        "Jennifer: No, I'm not doing anything behind Paul's back. The first person I'm \r\ngoing to talk to is him. ",
        "Jordan: That's a good idea. Let me know what he -- what you want me to know.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: I will. You know, I guess I should've seen this coming. Everything \r\nwas going so well. ",
        "Jordan: You're not one of those people who blame the messenger, are you? \r\nGood. Then we're still friends? ",
        "Jennifer: We're getting there. ",
        "Jordan: Hey, I'll take that. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, I don't know about you, but this conversation has wiped me \r\nout. ",

        "Jennifer: You know, my mom's still might be up. ",
        "Jordan: Got it. I'm sorry that we had to end the night on such a downer. But \r\nup until the last couple minutes, I was having a really good time. ",
        "Jennifer: Thank you for being so honest. Even though it wasn't very pleasant, \r\nit's better that I know. ",
        "Jordan: I don't want to keep any secrets from you, Jennifer. I have the \r\nfeeling that you've had enough of that in your life already. Good night. ",

        "Katie: Henry, you are brilliant. ",
        "Henry: Well, well, I wouldn't say brilliant. Although I did well on all the \r\nstandardized tests. Why do you bring it up? ",
        "Katie: Well, I was thinking about what you said about Mike, and I figured out \r\nthe perfect way to expose Pilar for the phony she is. ",
        "Henry: Oh, we've said so much about old Mike in the last few days. Can you \r\nremind me? ",
        "Katie: Okay. Remember when you said that we should tell him about the sketch, \r\nyou saw the guy here and followed him to her motel? ",
        "Henry: Yeah, you said that would fall on deaf ears. ",
        "Katie: Yeah, right, if we tell Mike. But what about telling Margo instead? I \r\nmean, she's gonna be a little bit more open to all the holes in Pilar's story.\r\n",
        "Henry: Okay, what holes are those? ",
        "Katie: Okay, one -- why would you go meet a guy if he had threatened to kill \r\nyou? Hole two -- if she was so worried about protecting Mike, why would she go \r\nback to his house, therefore exposing him to more danger? ",
        "Henry: Um -- her toothbrush. Or her favorite pair of PJs. ",
        "Katie: Hole number three -- if she was so worried about someone tracking her \r\ndown, why would she register at a motel under her real name? ",
        "Henry: Ah, ooh! That's a good point. And it's very incriminating. ",
        "Katie: Thanks, I thought so, too. Now, I just have to hope and pray that \r\nMargo does not hang up on me. ",

        "Mike: Well, I guess things could be worse. Look, I'm just not at that place \r\nright now. I hope you understand. ",
        "Pilar: Your heart's been broken. Some men heal it by jumping into bed with \r\nthe first woman who comes along. Then there's someone like you. The kind of man \r\nwho only comes along once in a lifetime. ",
        "Mike: Don't make me out to be a hero. All right? I'm just trying to do the \r\nbest I can. You know, this would be a lot easier if Katie didn't keep popping up \r\nevery time I turn around. ",

        "Mike: We were different people then. I just think it's best for both of us if \r\nwe just -- if we stay friends. ",
        "Pilar: It's ironic though. Sometimes I think we have more in common now than \r\never. ",
        "Mike: For some reason, I get the feeling you're not talking about us both \r\ngiving up race cars. ",
