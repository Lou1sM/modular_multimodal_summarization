        "Alison: Do I want to get married?",
        "Alison: No, Henry was suddenly talking, and Katie, they were the ones talking about using the gym for a wedding.",
        "Aaron: Because that's what they did.",
        "Alison: And they're married, and -- when people that are married, when they're happy, they want everyone else to be happy.",
        "Aaron: Right. I mean, we're happy. Right?",
        "Alison: Right. And who could be more happy than you and me? And we have a great job and our own apartment. Well, it's your apartment, but I live there --",
        "Aaron: No, Ali, it's both of our apartments.",
        "Alison: And we love each other.",
        "Aaron: We love each other so much. Love, love is not even the issue here. I can totally understand why people -- you know, would think that we should make it official.",
        "Alison: Look, you and I are together. And no one's gonna change that, right?",
        "Aaron: Right.",
        "Alison: So, who cares what they expect? Or when or where. We're gonna do what we wanna do when we wanna do it. Right?",
        "Aaron: I guess so.",
        "Alison: So we're not gonna let anyone pressure us into getting married before we're ready.",
        "Aaron: No. No, they're not.",
        "Alison: And if we're not ready, we're not ready. I mean, we're talking about timing, right? I mean, not whether or not we want to --",
        "Aaron: No, timing. No, definitely timing. Yeah.",
        "Alison: And if the timing's not right, then forget it. And with Lily in jail and Holden needing you to pitch in with the kids, and you managing Metro --",
        "Aaron: No, definitely. Definitely. Thank you so much.",
        "Alison: For what?",
        "Aaron: For understanding. You're couldn't be more right, Ali. The timing could not be any worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tyson: The girl is taken. She's hooked up with that guy who runs Metro. So why don't you face it. Alison Stewart is not interested in you.",
        "Casey: And we're not interested in you, Ty. So my question is, why don't you go away?",
        "Tyson: You think your friends are gonna have your back when you get locked up again? 'Cause that's where you're headed.",
        "Katie: You are all headed outside if you don't cut this out. You want to fight? Fine. Take it outside.",
        "Casey: She's right, man. He's not worth it. Let it go.",
        "Will: I didn't start this! He did!",
        "Tyson: Yeah, and I say we finish it. Right here, right now.",
        "Hagwood: I'm an off duty police officer, ma'am. You need any help here?",
        "Katie: Ahh -- no, I don't think that'll be necessary. These gentlemen were just leaving.",
        "Max: Come on, man, let's get outta here.",
        "Tyson: Another time, Munson.",
        "Will: Yeah, see if you can squeeze me in between shop and remedial English.",
        "Max: Let's just go.",
        "Tyson: You think you're so smart. So, why haven't you figured out that Alison Stewart would never waste her time with a psycho loser like you?",
        "[Yelling]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I got your message.",
        "Dusty: Keep your voice down.",
        "Paul: What? What's going on?",
        "Dusty: I had a meeting with Sierra about how Montgomery has been treatin' your sister. Long story short, Sierra has given me full control of Street Jeans. This is very good news.",
        "Paul: I'm not so sure. It's Jennifer's company.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, but Montgomery wants to bury it.",
        "Paul: What do you want to do?",
        "Dusty: I want to make Jennifer happy, because that's what makes Worldwide happy.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Dusty: We're talkin' about your sister. Montgomery stole her designs, her samples --",
        "Paul: Yeah, Dusty, what are you planning?",
        "Dusty: I say we give him a taste of his own medicine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Buyer: You don't have a production house on board?!",
        "Craig: Well, we're only open a few days here --",
        "Buyer: I bought your whole line. What am I gonna tell my boss?",
        "Craig: You tell him that we'll deliver on schedule --",
        "Buyer: You have nothing in development.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no. That's not true. We have lots of wonderful clothes --",
        "Buyer: No, I want to see samples -- next week. Or I'm pulling my order.",
        "Craig: I can't let that happen. So, I need drawings. Jennifer, why do you have to be so confused? You have so many drawings. You have drawings for next season. Some of those might be construed as part of our body of Street Jeans work. And logically, I could help myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So, you want to steal back from Craig what Craig stole from Jennifer?",
        "Dusty: You got a better idea?",
        "Paul: Yeah, we just kill Craig.",
        "Dusty: Next time. Now, we got to search.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jennifer remembering]",
        "Mike: Okay, whatever's bothering you, I guess you need to say it, so go ahead.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, I'm pregnant!",
        "Dusty: Oh. Congratulations. I'll buy you and Mike some champagne.",
        "Jennifer: It's not Mike's.",
        "Mike: I know you said you weren't feeling so hot. Is it getting worse?",
        "Jennifer: No, it's not that, mike. I have to tell you something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: You know, Ali, when you get married, it's because you find that person that you want to spend the rest of your life with. Somebody you can talk to and somebody you can trust. Somebody who'll go to bat for you. Somebody like Ali.",
        "Alison: But the timing's not right.",
        "Aaron: It's -- it's -- there's more to marriage, Alison. I mean, it's more than just love. It's kids and it's a house. It's life insurance. You know, and -- you are all I want. But, you know, you're right. We have to work harder, save money. You know, bigger apartment. 'Cause you never know when Dusty's just going to yank this place from under me.",
        "Alison: Are you kidding? You would get hired in a minute. You're the best.",
        "Aaron: Well, if I am, it's because of you. And I want you to stop worrying about any of this, okay? I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Alison: I know. And as long as we have each other, that's all that counts.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Yelling over each other]",
        "Tyson: Let's go psycho, let's go!",
        "Hagwood: That's it! You guys are both going downtown.",
        "Tyson: Yo, man, he jumped me. Tell him!",
        "Max: I just got off being grounded. I can't get in any more trouble.",
        "Katie: People come to this place to have a good time. I cannot have this stuff going on here!",
        "Hagwood: All right, now look, if you want to press charges, I'm going to have to ask you to come downtown and swear out a complaint.",
        "Casey: Please, Aunt Katie? If you could just let him go this one time, I promise it won't happen again.",
        "Katie: Well, I can't exactly leave right now. My partner is working and I don't have anyone to cover for me.",
        "Hagwood: Well, look, I just came in here to work out, not to read anybody their rights, okay? So, I mean if you guys are willing to back off, I'll let it go. C'mon, you guys can't agree to disagree? Apologize, shake hands, and we'll all move on.",
        "Celia: Just say you're sorry, Will.",
        "Will: But I'm not sorry!",
        "Hagwood: If we go downtown, your dad gets involved, Will. Is that what you want?",
        "Will: You know, I haven't gotten what I wanted in so long, it might be a nice change of pace.",
        "Hagwood: It's your party.",
        "Will: So let's everybody get arrested, huh? Come on. On me.",
        "Tyson: What'd I tell you, man? Your friend is crazy.",
        "Max: So next time, steer clear of him. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know, if I were Craig, I would keep Jennifer's designs in a safety deposit box off premises.",
        "Dusty: That's too much work for a guy like that. Bingo! What'd I tell you? You see that? That's the lazy man's approach right here.",
        "Paul: Those are Jennifer's designs.",
        "Dusty: Right. Ready to get outta here?",
        "Paul: If we take these, Craig's going to know that we were here.",
        "Dusty: So what?",
        "Paul: So, I think we should keep Craig in the dark as long as we can.",
        "Dusty: That's why I have these. Settle down.",
        "Paul: Dusty, those are my mother's.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I found them. We're going to swap them out with Jennifer's samples. It's a perfect idea. What am I doing? See what a preplanner I am? That will keep Craig away for a little while.",
        "Paul: Dusty's very clever.",
        "Dusty: Once in a while, yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Melanie: Boulevard Jeans. This is Melanie. No, Mr. Montgomery isn't here. May I take a message?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Anyone home? Now, if I were an unstable princess artiste, where would I hide my designs? Well, you do have talent, Jennifer, I'll give you that.",
        "Barbara: Jennifer? Honey, are you here? Well -- okay. You may not like my designs, but at least you know I'm thinking of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Jen? You were a million miles away.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I'm sorry. I was just -- thinking about the best way to say this. You know that I never meant for any of this to ever happen. And I -- I -- of course, I took precautions, but I guess sometimes you just can't control it, and -- that night that I was with Craig -- there were consequences.",
        "Mike: That's what I realized tonight. What can happen? You know, you may have had your moment with Craig, but I was just as clueless with Katie.",
        "Jennifer: What do you mean?",
        "Mike: You were right. All that talk about getting having kids and having a family -- not that I don't want that, I do. But, the timing -- I now know that was all off of Katie and Henry getting married. You know, I -- I guess I just needed to prove that I'd moved on. And I have. But I never -- I never stopped and admitted how much it hurt losing Katie. And we're friends now. That makes up for it, but -- I don't know, I -- I know that I confused you.",
        "Jennifer: No. No, I -- I will not have you apologizing. It was just as much my fault as --",
        "Mike: No, no, no. I'm just trying to make a point here. Okay? That we need to keep being honest with each other. All right, I mean, I told you that I needed to figure out what I wanted to do. And that's why I gave you the blueprints to show you that we can start from scratch. On a good foundation. And you can have a career and still be close to home. Now I know that's important to you. And we'll start talking about having a family when you are ready. As long as we're honest with each other, that's all that matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So, what're we going drinking to?",
        "Aaron: Oh, Rafi showing up on time. Record profits. Hmm? Come on, those are good things.",
        "Alison: They're great things.",
        "Aaron: But, why you so quiet?",
        "Alison: I know it seems -- it seems dumb. We never even talked about getting married before, but -- for some reason, deciding not to get married just seems --",
        "Aaron: Hey, Ali, we didn't decide not to get married. We just decided not to get married right now.",
        "Alison: I know.",
        "Aaron: But I know exactly what you mean. It's -- it's like something big happening, and we're not invited to it, right? Or like, out of the blue, they just cancelled Monday.",
        "Alison: And you always work Mondays anyway.",
        "Aaron: Well, I get to sleep in with my girl. And you are my girl.",
        "Alison: See, this is one of the times when the fact that you're my best friend and my boyfriend is so hard.",
        "Aaron: Why?",
        "Alison: Because I really need to tell my best friend something. But we already had the \"not getting married\" conversation, and it's embarrassing.",
        "Aaron: Well, tell me.",
        "Alison: Okay. Okay, okay. You know how most girls have their wedding planned out by the time they're like six? Well, at least Katie did. But I was never like that. I tried with Chris, but that was a total disaster. But our wedding? I've got it all down. My dress, my hair, the flowers. I've written the vows.",
        "Aaron: Tell me. Tell me.",
        "Alison: No. It's bad luck?",
        "Aaron: No. Bad luck? Bad luck we've gone through. And worse. Ali, if it's important to you, I want to know.",
        "Alison: You sure? Well, I thought that we'd book the dining room at the Lakeview. And we'd set up the altar with daisies and roses.",
        "Aaron: White ones?",
        "Alison: Well, all kinds of colors. And we'd be all dressed up, but cool, you know? Like one of the couples in the magazines.",
        "Aaron: What about your hair?",
        "Alison: See, that's -- that's what you would do! We'd be at the altar and everyone would be there. We'd just looking into each other's eyes. My hair would be down and you'd just brush it away from my face.",
        "[Alison fantasizing]",
        "Preacher: Love. That's what brought you here. But marriage, that's a lifetime commitment. Which is why we make promises when we get married. To help us keep the love alive. Alison? You ready to tell Aaron what you promise him?",
        "Alison: We've been friends a long time. Since back when I didn't like myself very much. Nobody liked me. Except for you. You were the only one that would put up with me. The only one who would help me. And I fell in love with you. Only I didn't know what love was. It's simple. I hear your voice on the phone and I'm happy. I see your face on the pillow and I'm happy. And you make me feel like anything is possible. That we can have any life we want as long as we're together. So my promise to you, Aaron, is that I'll do whatever it takes to make sure we never forget how lucky we are to have each other. Not bad, huh? Oh, you don't get to kiss the bride yet. Not until you tell me what you promise me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hagwood: I'm sorry, lieutenant. I tried to resolve the situation, but Will wasn't interested.",
        "Hal: No?",
        "Hagwood: No.",
        "Hal: All right. Thanks. I'll take care of it. Hey, Will. What happened?",
        "Will: Does it matter?",
        "Hal: \"Does it matter?\" Yes, it matters. You attacked a kid in front of a half a dozen witnesses. I want to know why.",
        "Will: Well, I don't know what to tell you, Dad.",
        "Hal: Hagwood said that he gave you the opportunity to make things right -- square things away -- and you didn't take him up on it. Why?",
        "Will: I guess I didn't see the point.",
        "Hal: You're becoming your own worst enemy, Will.",
        "Tyson's dad: If I could have a word, lieutenant?",
        "Hal: Yeah.",
        "Tyson's dad: My son wants to press charges.",
        "Celia: This doesn't make any sense, Will. Just say you're sorry.",
        "Will: But I'm not sorry!",
        "Casey: Do you think Tyson's sorry? Let it go, man.",
        "Hal: Casey? I'm going to need your side of the story. Can you come in?",
        "Casey: Sure. Don't worry, man, I've got your back.",
        "Celia: What are you trying to prove?",
        "Will: Not a thing.",
        "Celia: So why put yourself through this?",
        "Will: Well, maybe I had nothing better to do.",
        "Celia: And maybe you're mad at Alison and don't know how to tell her. Call her. Before it's too late.",
        "Will: That's just it -- it's already too late.",
        "Celia: You talk about Tyson? You're the stupid one. You've got a nice house, a nice dad, nice clothes. You're smart, you get good grades, you're handsome. I know people who'd give anything to be like you. And you just want to throw it all away!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Melanie: Of course, Boulevard can guarantee an order for June delivery. Let me just pull out an order form. If I could put you on hold for just a moment while I go get that form. Yes, I promise. I'll be just be a moment.",
        "Dusty: I guess they got disconnected, huh? I would love to be a fly on the wall during his first production meeting, I'll tell you that.",
        "Paul: What? When they realize that the sketches don't match the photographs from the trunk show?",
        "Dusty: Yes. We can't underestimate him. We've got to change the combination on Jennifer's safe back at her office.",
        "Paul: I thought you changed the locks on the door.",
        "Dusty: I thought you did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: My next season's designs. Thank you, Jennifer.",
        "Barbara: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Could I ask you the same thing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: To be honest -- my career is not -- is not my top priority at the moment. You know, I'm too distracted to even draw. And besides, what's the point? Even if I outlast Craig, what do I have? A successful clothing line. So what? You know, it never made my mother happy.",
        "Mike: You're your own person. You're strong. You're talented. You have so much to give. You're just discouraged. Okay? And you've been hurt. But you can have it all. Okay? You can have a family, and career and a home. It just takes patience. All right? And a little help from the people who love you.",
        "Jennifer: I don't -- I don't think it's fair of me to ask that of you.",
        "Mike: Because of Craig?",
        "Jennifer: Yes.",
        "Mike: Look, you stuck with me while I worked through my feelings for Katie. And -- and -- okay, this timing with Craig, it got messy. But it's over. All right? It is time to forgive each other and move on.",
        "Jennifer: And what if we can't?",
        "Mike: What are you afraid of? Are you afraid that I'm not going to get past my wounded pride? That I'm not -- I'm not, I'm not swallowing my pride. I'm staking a claim. You're with me. If that's what you want. Because I sure as hell want you.",
        "Jennifer: Oh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: I don't want to talk. I don't want to think. All I want to do is make love to you and forget about everything else.",
        "Barbara: I'll make sure that nobody \u0096",

        "Aaron: Are you callin' me out?",
        "Alison: You have a problem with that?",
        "Aaron: No. Okay, you told me your secret, so I'll -- I'll tell you mine.",
        "Alison: So, you've actually thought about it? Our wedding day?",
        "Aaron: Well, yeah. I didn't think about the flowers, but everything else, I've thought of. You know, we were at the altar and you were beautiful. And I like the fact that you put your hair down because I don't like when the brides put their hair in all that hairspray and its all smushed --",
        "Alison: But you haven't, like, actually thought about it.",
        "Aaron: I've thought about the part that counts.",
        "Aaron: I never felt like I really belonged anywhere. And then, I met you. You were a mess. And that's probably why we click so well. You were the one person who thought I was enough just the way I was. And after awhile, I started believing it. And I made friends. I got a job, got an apartment. I had a few setbacks, times when I wanted to give up. But you made sure that I would be fine. You made me feel like I was worth it. And you took such good care of me, Ali. Because you are wonderful and you are beautiful. And you know how to laugh. And I am so blessed to be marrying you. And so grateful and so happy. And I promise to appreciate you and what we have every day for the rest of my life.",
        "Aaron: Or something like that.",
        "Alison: You better remember every word of that speech because when we finally get married, that's exactly what I want to hear.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Aaron: You better get that. I gotta get back to work.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Alison: Hello?",
        "Celia: Alison? It's Celia. I'm really sorry to bother you, but it's Will. He's in trouble.",
        "Alison: Now what?",
        "Celia: He got in a fight and there was a cop there --",
        "Alison: He was arrested?",
        "Celia: They're talking to him now. We're at the police station. I think you should come. The cop keeps saying that this whole thing could go away if Will apologizes. But he's in one of his moods.",
        "Alison: I'll be right there. And Celia, thanks for calling me. I've gotta go.",
        "Aaron: Oh, no. Don't tell me, somebody's in trouble.",
        "Alison: Will. Are you sure you don't mind?",
        "Aaron: No. Go save the world.",

        "Craig: I'm surprised anyone let you in here.",
        "Barbara: I'm here to see my daughter. What's your excuse?",
        "Craig: I'm picking up a few things I left behind.",
        "Barbara: What's that behind your back, Craig?",
        "Craig: This is a file I needed.",
        "Barbara: Those are Jennifer's new designs, aren't they? You put them back where you found them.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. They're mine. No can do.",
        "Barbara: All right, then I'm calling security.",
        "Craig: Give me the phone, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Don't you dare -- don't you dare!",
        "Craig: Give me the phone, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Are you sure you're okay? All right, because if there's anything left that you need to talk about --",
        "Jennifer: I don't want to talk. I don't want to think. All I want to do is make love to you and forget about everything else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Security, its Barbara Ryan. I need you upstairs at the B.R.O. Offices right away.",
        "Dusty: Oh, Montgomery. What a surprise.",
        "Barbara: He's trying to steal that file.",
        "Dusty: This file?",
        "Paul: Oh, let me guess. Jennifer's latest designs?",
        "Craig: Street Jeans, we developed them together. And since you apparently didn't know, why don't you ask your mother what she's doing here.",
        "Dusty: You want to throw him out a window?",
        "Paul: You can if you want to. Get him out of here. Want to tell me what you're doing here, Mother?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What are you doing here?",
        "Alison: I could ask you the same question.",
        "Will: Did she call you?",
        "Alison: Does it matter?",
        "Casey: I did what I could, but Tyson's dad still wants to press charges.",
        "Will: Whatever.",
        "Alison: Could if talk to Will a minute?",
        "Celia: I've got to get back anyway.",
        "Casey: I'll check in with you later, man.",
        "Alison: You let Tyson get to you again? Why? He's so obvious. Just go in there and apologize.",
        "Will: For what? Sticking up for myself?",
        "Alison: No, for failing to duck when the idiot was trying to hit himself in the head. Oh, you're laughing now, but you won't be laughing at 2:00 A.M. when they stick a drunk in the cell next to you. And trust me, it happens.",
        "Will: Well, it looks like a slow night, so I think I'll be fine.",
        "Alison: Why are you being so stubborn? Do you want Tyson to win?",
        "Will: Like you care.",
        "Alison: Of course I care. I left my job and came down here. Will you just get over yourself and go in there and say you're sorry. I'll -- I'll go with you. And I'll tell them that you tried to lighten things up, but Tyson wouldn't go for it.",
        "Will: They won't buy it.",
        "Alison: Of course they'll buy it. And Celia said that the cop was practically begging you to apologize. So, come on, let's just get this over with. For me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Give me the keys. [Craig chuckles] stay away from Street Jeans or I'll put you in the hospital. Get outta here.",
        "Craig: Hmm, not calling the police?",
        "Dusty: No, Jen doesn't need the headache.",
        "Craig: No kidding. She losing --",
        "Dusty: You had a shot here and you blew it, but that's no surprise. 'Cause you can't make good on anything. Now, get outta here -- before I find an open window for you.",
        "[Craig chuckles sinisterly]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I came by to see my daughter. Is that such a crime? And I left her some sketches. I wrote her a note. I thought maybe something might spark her interest, you know?",
        "Paul: Nobody needs your help, Mother.",
        "Barbara: That is not true. With Craig lurking around --",
        "Paul: Craig has been taken care of.",
        "Barbara: Well, aren't we mysterious.",
        "Paul: You can keep your sketches. Nobody wants them. Is this all of them?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I'll put them in the safe. A lot of traffic around here, today. Let's go.",
        "[Jennifer remembering]",
        "Dusty: And what about Mike? He want kids?",
        "Jennifer: Just about a dozen. But like most men, he would like for them to be his.",
        "Dusty: So, don't tell him.",
        "Jennifer: He'll find out.",
        "Dusty: No, he won't, not from me.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, he knows that I slept with Craig. He'll wonder.",
        "Dusty: Maybe for a minute, but he loves you. He wants to believe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Why would your brother be so concerned about you, Jen? He's too busy polishing that chip on his shoulder. Don't you worry, sweetie. Don't you worry? He'll come around and figure it out one of these days. In the meantime, I'm there to take care of you. I'll make sure that nobody -- who can grow a spectacular garden?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You're all set.",
        "Will: No firing squad at dawn?",
        "Alison: No, just math, first period. Tyson's dad dropped the charges. Would you mind if I asked something?",
        "Will: Probably. But go ahead.",
        "Alison: What exactly did Tyson say to make you go off on him like that? You had everything under control when I left. What happened?",
        "Will: I don't know. I guess I just lost my mind for a second.",
        "Alison: Oh, save it for someone who hasn't seen your act. You didn't lose your mind. You lost control and I wanna know why. Okay, fine, don't talk to me. The next time you get in trouble, save the S.O.S.",
        "Will: I didn't ask you to come down here.",
        "Alison: No, you just got yourself arrested the minute i walked out of the gym.",
        "Will: Well, it had nothing to do with you!",
        "Alison: Then, why did it happen?",
        "Will: Oh, look, Alison, just go home to your fianc\u00e9 and leave me alone.",
        "Alison: My fianc\u00e9?",
        "Will: Don't insult me, all right. I heard you talking about all that wedding stuff at the gym. And congratulations. I hope you have a really nice life.",
        "Alison: Will!",

        "Celia: Now's your chance.",

        "Rafael: Casey.",
        "Casey: Can I talk to you? I mean, if you have a minute?",
        "Rafael: Yeah, what's up?",
        "Casey: All right, there's a concert in Chicago and I want to take Celia. Before you say no, though, about what happened last time with the car -- that'll never happen again. I mean, I'll put the car in a garage this time. I'll have my cell phone so we can check in. I promise I'll have her home on time and there won't be a problem. This is Celia's favorite singer and in Chicago for one night only. I mean, you can trust me. Talk to my parents, if you want. I'm a good student. I'm an excellent driver. My mom's a cop and my dad's the D.A. I follow more rules than kids even know exist. Please, let me do this for your sister. I think it's only fair.",
        "Rafael: Do you really want to go to this concert, Celia?",
        "Celia: So much.",
        "Rafael: Okay.",

        "Craig: Here's to nothing. Oh, wait. I spoke too soon. I have one sketch anyway. Add that to what we already have -- Melanie!",
        "Melanie: What?",
        "Craig: Melanie! Has anyone been in here?",
        "Melanie: No. At least, I don't think so. I was at my desk. Is there a problem?",
        "Craig: No, no. No, thank you. You can go back to work.",
        "[Craig murmurs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh, Jenn. Honey -- no wonder you've been so overwrought. You and Mike, you're gonna have a baby. And now, all this ugliness with Craig? Don't you worry? Don't you worry? I am not gonna let him hurt the mother of my first grandchild. He'll have to kill me first.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I can't lie about this child. And I can't do this to Mike. Is this the family planning center? Yes, I would -- I would like to make an appointment -- for as soon as possible. First thing in the morning? That -- that's perfect. Thank you.",
