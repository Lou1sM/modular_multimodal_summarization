        "Mike: So do we have a deal?",
        "Katie: Yes. I will never keep anything from you again. Even if it is for your own good because you're 5,000 miles away and can't do anything about it anyway.",
        "Mike: Well, you're not going to have to worry about that, because I'm never going to be that far away from you again. It was hell.",
        "Katie: No kidding.",
        "Mike: All I could think about was getting back here and holding you. Kissing you. Everything after that.",
        "Katie: Don't stop there, it was just getting good.",
        "Mike: We've got mail.",
        "Katie: What? Hand delivered too, huh. I wonder what it is.",
        "Mike: So?",
        "Katie: Lucinda Walsh is throwing a party.",
        "Mike: Hey, whoopee. What's the occasion?",
        "Katie: She published a new book. It's called \"Oakdale Confidential.\"",
        "Mike: Somebody actually wrote a book about this place?",
        "Katie: Apparently. It doesn't say who, just that the contents are hush-hush. We're part of a select group, honey. Can we go?",
        "Mike: Is that really your idea of a good time? Going to some stuffy publishing thing.",
        "Katie: This title does not sound stuffy.",
        "Mike: A title's a title. How do you know it's not just a come-on?",
        "Katie: Let's face it, you don't have to look far to find scandal in this town. This could be the best thing to happen to this place in years. And besides, you've been running from a construction site to your brother's hospital room. It might be a nice change of pace.",
        "Mike: Okay, just put it on the calendar.",
        "Katie: It's tonight.",
        "Mike: Tonight?",
        "Katie: In an hour.",
        "Mike: No -- an hour? All right, well, I hope you don't mind being a little bit late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Oh, man, it feels so good to be home.",
        "Holden: I bet it does.",
        "Lily: Okay, what do you want to do first? Do you want to lay down first? Maybe I'll make you something to eat. You could stay downstairs.",
        "Luke: That's easy. Food. I've been dreaming about a home-cooked meal for days. Hospital food, not my idea of a good time.",
        "Lily: All right, I'll make you anything you want. I'll make you some hamburgers, pasta.",
        "Holden: Hey, can we get into the house before you give him a rundown on the meal?",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Jade: You're home! I've missed you so much.",
        "Luke: Yeah, me too.",
        "Lily: We haven't had time to really settle back in.",
        "Jade: I know. I just wanted to see him for a second.",
        "Luke: Well, then, come on. Let's go inside, Jade. My mom's making me lots of food. Pasta and hamburgers and bacon and eggs.",
        "Holden: Hey, easy, easy. You're going to end up back in the hospital with terminal heartburn.",
        "Lily: I'm sure Jade has other things to do, right?",
        "Jade: Oh, yeah, yeah. You're right. I should be getting back.",
        "Luke: Back where?",
        "Jade: You haven't told him?",
        "Luke: Told me what? Mom, what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Jen, I just talked to Dad. What are you thinking, letting Paul walk out of jail?",
        "Jennifer: I don't have time, will. Right now, I'm sorry I'm --",
        "Will: No, you're not going to go anywhere until you explain this to me. Dad said that you're not going to testify against Paul, and so all the charges had to be dropped.",
        "Jennifer: That's right.",
        "Will: But, why, Jen? How could you let that happen after everything that he did to you?",
        "Jennifer: I have my reasons, okay? And you're just going to have to understand that.",
        "Will: Understand that? Jen, you're going to have to do better than that.",
        "Jennifer: Will, I didn't have a choice.",
        "Will: What does that mean? Did he threaten you? Is he forcing you to do this?",
        "Jennifer: No! No, no. This is completely my decision. Totally mine.",
        "Will: Just because he's our brother doesn't mean he should get a free pass after everything he did.",
        "Jennifer: Well, no, he hasn't gotten a free pass for anything. He's been through hell and almost died sitting in a jail cell for a long time now. A week or two? He deserves to be there for years!",
        "Jennifer: I'm the one who's hurt and I'm the one who's making the decision. And if I'm okay with it, you should be too.",
        "Will: I just don't get it, Jen. Tell me why. Give me one good reason he should get out of jail.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not doing this for Paul, okay? I'm doing it for myself.",
        "Will: Jen, you're a really good person. Too good. And Paul doesn't deserve it. Unless this is something else. This is about Dusty, isn't it?",

        "Dusty: Dammit!",

        "Emily: Mrs. Paul Ryan. You have no idea how long I've waited to hear those words. So what do you think? What do you think of the place? Do you like what I've done? Is it romantic enough for you?",
        "Paul: I think it's amazing. You have completely outdone yourself.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? It's only the beginning. You have no idea what I have in store for you. Not that I'm complaining, but we don't need to rush, do we? I mean, we can take our time. We have all night.",
        "Paul: I just -- I want to take advantage of every single second.",
        "Emily: I know, so do I. That's why I've taken care of everything down to the last detail. Champagne's in the fridge. And then there's this.",
        "Paul: Wow, you're going to wear that?",
        "Emily: For a second or two.",
        "Paul: Well, we shouldn't waste any time. You should go put that on right now.",
        "Emily: No, I want to have some champagne first.",
        "Paul: Sure.",
        "Emily: You have made me the happiest woman in the world. I was so afraid this day would never come.",
        "Paul: Yeah, me too.",
        "Emily: But it's here finally, and even though our actual wedding was a couple of days ago, I want to treat tonight like our real wedding night, okay? A new beginning for the both of us. The way it should be.",
        "Paul: Em, I think I should go get that champagne.",
        "Emily: Good. Because I want to toast to our future.",

        "Katie: Come on, Kasnoff, where's that sixth sense? I was right there. Can't you feel me?",
        "Mike: I'm telling you, when I get my hands on you --",
        "Katie: Oh, promises, promises.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Mike: Ha! I gotcha! Tag, you're it. Double tag, actually.",
        "Katie: Double tag? Why?",
        "Mike: Yes, because I had two hands. That means you owe me two pieces of clothing.",
        "Katie: Oh, which two?",
        "[Door bell rings]",
        "Mike: You have got to be kidding me.",
        "Katie: Are you going to put out the closed for the season sign?",
        "Mike: Hey, let's pretend we are.",
        "Nancy: Katie? It's Nancy.",
        "Katie: It's Nancy Hughes.",
        "Mike: Who made that rule?",
        "Katie: To be continued. [Door bell rings] Go hide or put on clothes or something.",
        "Nancy: Hello, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hi, Nancy.",
        "Nancy: I have a feeling I've come at a bad time.",
        "Katie: No, no, I was just -- we were just --",
        "Nancy: Don't explain. I know Mike's back.",
        "Katie: He is. He got back today.",
        "Nancy: Don't think I'm too old to remember how fond absence makes the heart.",
        "Katie: That is true. I'm sorry. Come on in.",
        "Nancy: Are you sure?",
        "Katie: Yes, yes. Mike will be right down.",
        "Nancy: Well, I'm sorry, dear. I should've called first. But I just expected you to be at Lucinda's party.",
        "Katie: We're planning on coming.",
        "Nancy: But you got waylaid, is that it?",
        "Katie: Sort of.",
        "Nancy: Well, anyway, I wanted to stop by and give you this. It's a little welcome home present that you and Mike can enjoy.",

        "Jade: Do you want to tell him or should I?",
        "Lily: Your father and I thought it would be best if Jade stayed at cal's place for the time being.",
        "Luke: For the time being?",
        "Lily: While you're recuperating.",
        "Holden: Yeah, don't get the wrong idea. It's not punishment. We just want to make sure that you get a lot of rest while you recuperate.",
        "Luke: And you don't think that I can do that with Jade around?",
        "Lily: No, I don't, actually.",
        "Jade: Its okay, Luke. I agree with your mom.",
        "Luke: You do?",
        "Jade: Yeah, your health has to come first. And you need to get rest and I need be out of your way.",
        "Luke: Okay. Well, then, I guess I'm outnumbered. I just wish that I had been part of the decision.",
        "Jade: Your mom is just watching out for you. I'm okay with this, I swear. Anyway, Cal's den is really pretty cool.",
        "Luke: If you say so, yeah.",
        "Jade: It's not like we can't see each other at all, right?",
        "Lily: We have to get in and settle ourselves, so -- I have to cook a lot of food, as well. Okay?",
        "Jade: All right, see you later.",
        "Lily: Bye-bye. I hope you're not too upset about this, Luke.",
        "Luke: Surprised, maybe, but if Jade's okay with it, I guess I am too.",
        "Lily: Good. So what do you want food-wise?",
        "Luke: How about pasta. A big, big heaping plate of it.",
        "Lily: Okay. I'm so glad you're home.",
        "Luke: Me, too.",
        "Holden: Anything you need? Anything I can do for you?",
        "Luke: No, no, no. I'm cool. Actually, you know what, Dad? I could really go for a mug of hot chocolate. You know, the way you used to make when I was a kid.",
        "Holden: Really? You haven't asked for one of those in a long time.",
        "Luke: Well, I just got the urge. Would you believe it?",
        "Holden: All right. You know what? I could go for one myself. I'll be right back.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Jade: That was fast.",
        "Luke: Hey, I can't stay long. My parents are making me, like, a huge feast.",
        "Jade: Lucky boy.",
        "Luke: So are you really okay with my mom making you stay here?",
        "Jade: Yeah, this place is great. It gives me privacy. And actually, it's better for our plan.",
        "Luke: Why, because it keeps my mom happy?",
        "Jade: Yeah, and it gives you a place to sneak off to.",
        "Luke: Why would I want to sneak -- right. I've got to pretend like we're crazy in love.",
        "Jade: Exactly. We have to take every opportunity that we can to make it seem like we can't keep our hands off of each other, because if your parents figuring out that we're faking this, Lily will kick me out of her so fast it won't even be funny.",
        "Luke: Well, Jade, Jade, that's not going happen, yet. Well, not right away at least. I've got to tell you, once I'm strong enough, I'm going to tell my parents the truth. I'm going to tell them that I'm gay.",
        "Jade: Don't rush on my account. I'm really starting to like it here.",
        "Luke: Well, that's why I'm just reminding you, this game isn't going to go on forever. So if you really want to stay here, you've got to find a way to get on my mom's good side, yourself.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well don't worry about that. But in the meantime, you really do have to keep up the pressure for me to stay, because you're the only one Lily will listen to right now.",
        "Luke: Let's hope you're right.",
        "Jade: I am. But you really should get back before they figure out where you are.",
        "Holden: Hey, Luke, I was just wondering if -- hey.",
        "Luke: Hey, Dad.",
        "Holden: Where did you go?",
        "Luke: I was just out looking at the sky. You know, you should check it out. The stars are really bright tonight.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I bet they were especially bright over at cal's place. That's where you were, isn't it?",
        "Luke: Don't you think Mom's going a little overboard, making Jade stay there like that?",
        "Holden: Just count your blessings that your mom didn't kick her out altogether.",
        "Luke: Look, Jade knows she has a really hard road ahead of her, making you and Mom to trust her again. I'm just hoping that you're willing to give it a chance.",
        "Holden: I understand that this is hard on you. It's a tough situation for all of us.",
        "Luke: Including Jade.",
        "Holden: I understand that you like having Jade around. And I think that she's trying to make up for deceiving us. That's going to be a very tough sale on your mother.",
        "Luke: What about you? You seem to be at least willing to give us the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Holden: I'm trying to keep the peace, that's all. I don't want anybody to get upset. And I want you and your mom to stay happy and healthy.",
        "Holden: She's choking on kindness?",
        "Luke: Something like that.",
        "Holden: Do me a favor. Try to follow your mom's rules as best as you can.",
        "Luke: And steer clear of Jade?",
        "Holden: As much as any teenager in love possibly can, yes.",
        "Luke: Well, I'll try my best, for you and for Mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: The only thing that's important to me now is finding out where Dusty is.",
        "Will: And you're positive he's still alive?",
        "Jennifer: You've seen that photo and the note. You've heard about that, right? That's proof that he's out there. Even Dad has to agree.",
        "Will: Yeah, but where, Jen? Do you have any idea?",
        "Jennifer: No.",
        "Will: But you've got a theory? Do you think Paul knows where Dusty is?",
        "Jennifer: He says he doesn't.",
        "Will: And you don't believe him?",
        "Jennifer: Will, can you just let this go?",
        "Will: I don't care. I don't get it, okay? If Paul does know something, then why wouldn't you want him to stay in jail? Because it's the only place that's gonna wear him down and get him to talk.",
        "Jennifer: I've said all I'm gonna say.",
        "Gwen: I don't get it. He's your brother. I mean, if he knows where Dusty is, why don't you just ask him?",
        "Jennifer: I have.",
        "Gwen: And you think that he lied to you?",
        "Jennifer: Ok, apparently, you haven't figured out yet how our family works. But you'd better learn fast if you want to survive us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: This is like the best dream I've ever had.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Me, too. I feel the same way.",

        "Emily: How?",
        "Paul: Why don't you go put that little number on there that --?",
        "Emily: Why, so you can rip it right off of me?",
        "Paul: Exactly.",
        "Emily: Oh. Don't you move. Oh, wait a minute! [Emily laughs] We never did our toast.",
        "Paul: Oh, well, I'm not gonna pour an ounce of that stuff until I see that you have wiggled into that little thing.",

        "Paul: Oh, yeah I have a headache. It's not like, you know, the not tonight I have a headache, headache but I -- I have a headache. I just need something, you know, to take the edge off and then we can have the honeymoon that we have always dreamed of.",

        "Mike: Oh, come on, come on, come on, she'll understand. Can we just forget about the party?",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Mike: All right, or not. If you really want to go.",
        "Katie: Only if it's okay with you.",
        "Mike: Whatever is okay with me.",
        "Katie: I love how we compromise.",
        "Mike: Yes.",
        "Katie: Be right down.",
        "Mike: Oakdale Confidential. Hmm.",

        "Lily: Are you sure you want eat all of this before dinner?",
        "Luke: Mom, trust me, there is nothing that can spoil my appetite.",
        "Lily: Okay, good. Holden? Brownie?",
        "Holden: No actually, I have something that I need to take care of.",
        "Lily: Something wrong?",

        "Lily: Hello? Hello, Mother. I can't go tonight. Luke just got home from the hospital. He's doing much better, actually. Okay, well, have fun at your party tonight. Good luck. Bye.",
        "Luke: What party?",
        "Lily: Your grandmother is having a party for a publication of a new book.",
        "Luke: Oh, well, this is her first big work thing since she got sick, isn't it?",
        "Lily: Well, yeah, in public. I'm sure she's a little nervous, but she won't admit it, of course.",
        "Luke: Well then, Mom, by all means, go. I don't want you to miss it on my account.",
        "Lily: I want to miss it on your account. I want to stay home and spoil you like I used to do when you would stay home from school when you were a little boy.",
        "Luke: Mom --",
        "Lily: No, come on, it'll be fun. We could hang out. We could -- talk.",
        "Luke: About what?",
        "Lily: About Jade.",
        "Luke: And your decision to send her to exile?",
        "Lily: She's still on the property, right?",
        "Luke: Yeah, that's true. Jade knows that it's gonna take more than an apology for you to forgive her.",
        "Lily: She lied. She pretended to be Rose's daughter. She made me care about her. And honestly, I don't think her motives are as innocent as she claims.",
        "Luke: I know, Mom. I know and I don't know what I can do to make you feel otherwise.",
        "Lily: The only person who can do anything is Jade. And if she doesn't --",
        "Luke: Yeah, I got it -- I got it. She's out of here.",

        "Holden: Jade, it's Holden.",
        "Jade: What's wrong? Is Luke okay?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, he's fine. I just wanted to speak to you for a minute. Do me a favor, would you mind putting on a robe or something?",
        "Jade: Oh yeah, I was just getting ready for bed. Just give me a second. Come on in. So -- well then, what's on your mind?",
        "Holden: My son. And you.",
        "Jade: Well, Luke is an incredible guy. I can't even believe how much I missed him when he was in the hospital. Even though it was only for a few days.",
        "Holden: I think he's crazy about you, too. And that worries me. I know he was just down here.",
        "Jade: Yeah, he was. But, he was only here to make sure that I was okay.",
        "Holden: Well, he snuck down here and that's not okay.",
        "Jade: I told him that.",
        "Holden: You did?",
        "Jade: Yeah. And I sent him right back to the house. Listen, Lily has laid down the rules, and I intend to follow them. As best I can.",
        "Holden: For your sake, I hope that's true. And for Luke's sake, as well. I don't want him to get stressed out about anything, he could have a relapse. Do you understand that?",
        "Jade: Absolutely. I don't want him back in that hospital any more than you do.",
        "Holden: I really want to believe that. But you put my family through a lot of pain. When it comes to my family, I don't forgive or forget easily.",
        "Jade: What else do you want me to say?",
        "Holden: I don't want you to say anything. I just want you stay away from Luke.",
        "Jade: I get it. But I can't promise Luke is gonna stay away from me.",
        "Holden: Let us handle that. Are we clear?",
        "Jade: We are.",
        "Holden: Good, because -- if you're feeding me a line and you plan on doing something behind something my back, that would be a mistake.",

        "Mike: What?",
        "Katie: You're more interested in that book than you are in me.",
        "Mike: You wouldn't believe what's in here.",
        "Katie: Really? As interesting as Nancy says?",
        "Mike: Oh, it's interesting, all right. But not for the reasons you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Look, all I'm saying is that you can't handle our family the way you would a normal one.",
        "Will: We bring new meaning to the word dysfunctional.",
        "Gwen: Okay, fine. But don't forget, I've seen Paul in action. He tried to manipulate me before, too. Look, all I'm saying is I just think you're pouring gasoline on a fire by trying to manipulate him back.",
        "Jennifer: Look, I know what I'm doing. Dusty is alive, and he's out there somewhere. And I'm gonna do whatever I have to, to find him.",
        "Will: Just be careful, Jen. Brother or not, Paul's going to protect himself before he protects anybody else.",
        "Jennifer: He can't hurt me any more than he already has. And one way or another, he's going to lead me where I need to go. See ya.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry. Was that -- was that out of line?",
        "Will: No, don't worry about it.",
        "Gwen: This is going to take some getting used to.",

        "Paul: Yeah, and all I want is you. Just -- I mean, what about all the plans that we made?",
        "Emily: None of that seems to matter.",
        "Paul: All the trouble that you went to get everything all ready.",
        "Emily: No, none of that seems to matter right now.",
        "Paul: Of course it's matters, Emily. This is our wedding night. I want everything to be special. And magical. And perfect.",
        "Emily: It's perfect just because you're here.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but -- why don't we savor it a little bit. We got everything here -- the candles and the champagne and the music the sexy little outfit.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but all that stuff was just to set the mood, honey.",
        "Paul: Look, I just -- I don't want tonight just to be about sex. Okay, because we've done that. And tonight, I want it to be different. I want tonight to be special, something that we will always remember. Something that we can use to drive away all of the bad memories that we've ever had.",
        "Emily: I want that. I want to drive them all away.",
        "Paul: We should take this to a much deeper level.",
        "Emily: I can't believe I'm hearing you say these words. It's like I'm listening to my own heart talking.",
        "Paul: Go, get ready for me. Let's start our marriage with an evening that we won't forget for the rest of our lives.",
        "Meg: You're very convincing, I must say.",
        "Paul: Thanks. I think maybe you should go now. You know, before she gets back.",
        "Meg: Well, how about you? How are you going get out of her?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I'll think of something, I'll figure it out. Just go.",

        "Katie: Wow. I guess I should be flattered.",
        "Mike: No, we should be calling a lawyer. Half of this book is about us.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on. That's impossible. You didn't even have time to look through it.",
        "Mike: Look, I got part of the way through it.",
        "Katie: No, look, look, Carly's on the cover. Maddie's on the cover. It's called \"Oakdale Confidential.\" I'm sure it's about a lot of people in town.",
        "Mike: Well, I'd like to know if any of them gave their permission to whoever wrote this. Because I sure didn't.",
        "Katie: Honey, it can't be that bad.",
        "Mike: Wait until you read it before you say that. Somebody did plenty of digging into my past. I'm not real thrilled of what they decided to use here.",
        "Katie: You just don't like seeing your name in print.",
        "Mike: I don't like seeing personal stuff about my life in print, either.",
        "Katie: Why not? You hiding some deep, dark secret from me?",
        "Mike: That's not the point.",
        "Katie: Honey, relax. Nobody's gonna take this book seriously.",
        "Mike: How can you be sure?",
        "Katie: Fine, if that's the way you feel about it, we won't go to the party.",
        "Mike: Oh, no, no, we're gonna go to the party. We're going to find out first hand who wrote this piece of garbage.",

        "Luke: Mom, you are too good to me. I don't deserve it.",
        "Lily: Of course you do. You're my baby, no matter how old you are. You know I would do anything for you, Luke. You know that.",
        "Luke: I know. But right now, you really need to take care of yourself, too. And especially -- especially the state that you're in now.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Luke: You know. We should be cooking for you.",
        "Lily: You're okay with us having another child.",
        "Luke: Are you kidding? Of course.",
        "Lily: Are you sure? I mean with everything that's been going on, we haven't talked about it.",
        "Luke: Mom, I think it's awesome. I think it's going to be so awesome just to have a little -- a little bambino running around, you know? And after everything that's happened this past year, I think -- I really think that this is a blessing. I think it's going to bring you and dad closer than ever.",
        "Lily: I think you're right.",
        "Luke: But, it's also going to turn your world upside down.",
        "Lily: It's worth it. Seeing that baby -- smiling at you, beaming up at you. You know, I still see the baby in your eyes every time you smile at me. That's never gonna change. And you know that I would do anything for you because I love you so much. I just want to protect you. Whatever it takes.",
        "Luke: And I want to protect you, too.",
        "Lily: So, we'll take care of each other. Deal?",
        "Luke: Deal.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I was only staying because I wanted to be with Luke and I just have never felt this way before. I couldn't imagine being without him and I would do anything to stay close to him.",
        "Holden: Yeah, and I'll do anything to keep my son out of the hospital but being around you is more than he can handle right now. He doesn't need the stress.",
        "Jade: And what about the stress of being separated from the person that you love? You think that's better for him? Don't you remember when you were his age?",
        "Holden: Yeah -- yeah, I do.",
        "Jade: And didn't you and Lily meet when you were young?",
        "Holden: Yeah -- yeah, we did.",
        "Jade: And I bet a lot of people tried to keep you two apart.",
        "Holden: Yeah, so.",
        "Jade: And I bet it didn't work.",
        "Holden: No, it didn't. They can't, even today.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well, so, I guess you know what I'm saying.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I do. But I need to put my son's health first. And Lily as well. That is the bottom line here.",
        "Jade: Holden, I swear I would never let anything happen to Luke that would put him back in the hospital.",

        "Jade: Are you going to tell Lily we had this talk?",
        "Holden: Why shouldn't I?",
        "Jade: Well it might upset her.",
        "Holden: Well, we don't keep secrets from one another.",
        "Jade: Yeah. But, I mean, sometimes it's better not to know too much. Life is complicated enough, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I know it sounds crazy, but playing it straight in my family just doesn't work. Because, you know, we've been playing games with each other for so long that we don't know any other way.",
        "Gwen: That's the way that Barbara and Paul think. But you and Jen and your dad -- you guys are smarter than that. Why do you have to stoop to their level?",
        "Will: Because if we don't, then they win and we lose.",
        "Gwen: But then it never ends. And so you just spend your life trying to out maneuver each other.",
        "Will: Yeah, exactly. You're starting to get it. Which is why it was so hard for me to move back in with my dad. It's easier to just stay away from them, from all of them.",
        "Gwen: Well, you can't run from your family forever.",
        "Will: You did.",
        "Gwen: Are you always -- are you always this hard to argue with?",
        "Will: The only family that matters to me now is you. Because I know we're never gonna play games with each other. And we're not gonna lie to each other.",
        "Gwen: You're right. We won't.",

        "Emily: Yeah, well, you know what, maybe later. But right now, I want you. I have waited long enough.",
