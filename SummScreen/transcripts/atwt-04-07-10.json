        "Katie: Vienna, hi.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry to just drop by like this. I just didn't know where else to go.",
        "Katie: It's okay. Come in. What's wrong?",
        "Vienna: Everything.",
        "Katie: It's Henry, isn't it?",
        "Vienna: Yes. W -- wait. Well, how do you know?",
        "Katie: Well, you know, Henry is just being Henry. Why? What did he do now?",
        "Vienna: He's just changed completely. I -- I feel like I -- I don't even recognize him anymore.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on. He's still the same Henry you fell in love with. I'm sure it's not as bad as you think.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say because you haven't seen how odd he's been acting lately. It's -- it's as if -- [Vienna sighs] I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I don't think he loves me anymore.",
        "Katie: No, don't be crazy. Don't say that. Of course he does.",
        "Vienna: Then what else can it be? I mean, whenever we're together, the fire is just gone.",
        "Katie: Well, the fire's gone 'cause you were gone for a long time.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but I'm back now.",
        "Katie: Right, so you just need to give him some time.",
        "Vienna: Oh, trust me, I have given him time, and -- and costumes and food, and it doesn't work anymore! And that was never a problem before, ever! And you know this because you were married to him.",
        "Katie: Every relationship is different, and they all hit lulls. You really have to work on that passion if that's what you want.",
        "Vienna: I do want it. But I'm not sure if Henry wants me. Nobody knows him better than you do. Please, I want to know -- I need to know what's wrong. What can I do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, I was just thinking about you, and here you are.",
        "Henry: May I come in?",
        "Barbara: Absolutely. You know, I could feel it. I could feel that you were as enchanted by Bob and Kim's wedding as I was. There is something to be said for all that \"Happily after ever\" stuff.",
        "Henry: Yeah, there is. It's -- it's really touching. Although the \"Happily ever after\" part's always sort of eluded me.",
        "Barbara: Well, happiness is where you find it.",
        "Henry: Yeah. It's also like a sneeze. It sort of comes up, and then all of the sudden, it's gone.",
        "Barbara: We're happy together though, right?",
        "Henry: We're usually in flagrante delicto when we're together.",
        "Barbara: And you know how much I love it when you say that. Say it again.",
        "Henry: Barbara, stop. Stop! We can't -- we can't do this anymore.",
        "Barbara: Why not? Because of Vienna?",
        "Henry: Her coming back, it changes everything.",
        "Barbara: No, it doesn't change anything. She left you. She left the door open for us to find each other.",
        "Henry: I know. Even -- even good things have to come to an end.",
        "Barbara: And why would this have to come to an end?",
        "Henry: Katie's on to us.",
        "Barbara: [Laughs] No, she's not. She might be a little suspicious, but even if she is, so what?",
        "Henry: So what? She and Vienna are friends, and then she can tell Vienna everything.",
        "Barbara: Well, then, let her tell Vienna, because there's nothing between the two of you anymore.",
        "Henry: I -- I know that, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: In fact, I think that it's time that we take our relationship public.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: He regained consciousness, but he still seems pretty weak. Is that normal?",
        "Reid: Has he communicated with you?",
        "Janet: Yeah. He was worried about me. Can you believe it?",
        "Reid: That's touching. You were able to understand him? Was he coherent?",
        "Janet: Yes, yes, absolutely.",
        "Rocco: Doc, he doesn't seem to remember anything about what happened.",
        "Reid: Victims of traumatic violence often don't, at least not at first.",
        "Rocco: You're saying his memory might come back?",
        "Reid: It might. It might not. It's anybody's guess. I'll check back later.",
        "Rocco: Compassionate guy.",
        "Janet: I don't care about his bedside manner. I just want him to help Dusty get better.",
        "Rocco: It looks like Dusty's on his way to a recovery.",
        "Janet: Thank God.",
        "Rocco: It sure was a close call he had.",
        "Janet: Yeah. You don't have to tell me.",
        "Rocco: I can't imagine being attacked like that. Probably be better for him if he never remembers what happened to him that night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Mr. Judd, could I speak to you for a moment about Dr. Oliver?",
        "Judd: I got nothing to say to anybody except a judge.",
        "Luke: Well, then, maybe you can just hear me out. Look, I know Dr. Oliver did everything he could to save your daughter. And I also know that he's arrogant and obnoxious. What happened to your daughter was heartbreaking, and you must be so hurt and angry, and you're looking for someone to blame. I get it. I get it. And you must want some sort of retribution for everything that your family's been through. So maybe I can help. I have access to a lot of money. So wouldn't you rather avoid -- a trial that would just bring up your family's pain and suffering all over again?",
        "Judd: Do you think that money is going to bring back my little girl?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey! You're awake. How do you feel?",
        "Dusty: Like I got shot in the head. How are you?",
        "Janet: Oh, please, don't worry about me, Honey. I got Pop here to keep me company.",
        "Dusty: [Remembers] I understand you're still hooked up with Ralph Manzo. Thought I wouldn't find out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, there he is. You're awake. It's good to see. You up to doing some talking?",
        "Dusty: Sure.",
        "Rocco: Come on, Jack. He can barely keep his eyes open. Don't you think you're pushing it a little?",
        "Jack: Well, I think that's Dusty's call, Rocco. We can do this now, we can do this later, but the sooner I get the details of your attack, the sooner I can get a lead on the guy who's responsible.",
        "Janet: But I don't want you to push yourself. I just want to make sure that you're feeling better first, okay?",
        "Dusty: Everything's still a blur.",
        "Rocco: Doctor said he might never remember. He needs rest, not questions. Janet, tell your ex to ease up.",
        "Janet: My dad's right, Jack. We all want to catch who did this, but Dusty's just starting to recover.",
        "Jack: And the last thing I would want to do is to push you too hard.",
        "Dusty: I don't remember much, Jack. It's all a blur.",
        "Jack: Okay. We can do this some other time, then.",
        "Janet: Your memory's going to come back soon, Honey. I know it will.",
        "Dusty: I hope so.",
        "Janet: In the meantime, can I get you anything?",
        "Dusty: Water.",
        "Janet: You got it.",
        "Rocco: I'll come with you to the cafeteria.",
        "Jack: Actually, Mr. Ciccone, I was wondering if I could talk to you a minute.",
        "Rocco: What about?",
        "Jack: It won't take long. It's important.",
        "Janet: Jack --",
        "Jack: Janet, it will only take a minute.",
        "Rocco: Go on. I'll -- I'll catch up to you.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Rocco: What can I do you for, Jack?",
        "Jack: I'm just, um -- just curious about how much you know about what actually happened to Dusty.",
        "Rocco: About what you do. Somebody attacked him. He got shot.",
        "Jack: You're sure that's all?",
        "Rocco: What else would I know?",
        "Jack: Well, I was hoping that's what you'd be able to tell me.",
        "Rocco: What are we talking about here, Detective? Are you accusing me of something?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I would never presume that money would take the place of the daughter you lost. But this lawsuit of yours, it could keep Dr. Oliver from his work, from helping other people.",
        "Judd: Or from killing them.",
        "Luke: Dr. Oliver is not a murderer. He's a very good doctor. And I swear, he did everything he could to save your daughter's life.",
        "Reid: What's going on?",
        "Judd: Well, this is pathetic. You sent your boyfriend here to buy me off?",
        "Reid: What the hell are you talking about?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Vienna, I think really you just need to ask Henry what's going on.",
        "Vienna: I have tried. I've hinted. I have asked him outright what's going on, and nothing. I don't know what to do.",
        "Katie: I just -- I can't believe the two of you can't find some way to figure this out together.",
        "Vienna: He's acting as if he loves me. But then when he says it, he has this funny tone in his voice, and when we go to bed, nothing. I mean, that only means one thing.",
        "Katie: That he's tired?",
        "Vienna: Of me. He doesn't love me anymore.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. Don't say that. I don't believe that for a second.",
        "Vienna: What if he met someone else when I was gone? I mean, I can't be the only woman who sees how handsome and desirable he is.",
        "Katie: Henry will always love you.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, I thought so, too, but --",
        "Katie: Yes, he will always love you more than he could ever love anyone else. And the truth is you know what? You just got back. He's still healing.",
        "Vienna: I should never have left him.",
        "Katie: You were upset, and you were -- you were sad, and it's okay. You don't have to blame yourself for what's happening here.",
        "Vienna: You have to talk to him. You're his best friend.",
        "Katie: Me?",
        "Vienna: Yes, yes. You're the only one he will be honest with.",
        "Katie: Oh, Vienna, I don't know.",
        "Vienna: Oh, come on. Please, you have to talk to him. You have to find out what's wrong. I have to know if -- if I can fix this or if there's anything left here for me.",
        "Katie: What do you mean? If it's over with Henry, you'll go back to Sweden?",
        "Vienna: Come on. You have to help me with this, Katie, please. You have to find out what the truth is.",
        "Katie: All right.",
        "Vienna: You will do it for me?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Thank you, thank you. Can you go right now?",
        "Katie: Well, I mean, I just put Jacob down. The sitter's not here yet.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but I'll wait for the sitter, and I'll take care of Jacob. Please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I -- I owe it to Vienna to at least try to work things out.",
        "Barbara: From what I understand, there's not a lot to work out anymore.",
        "Henry: This is something I have to do, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Have to or want to?",
        "Henry: We -- we have a history together, Vienna and I. We shared a life. We shared a business. We -- we lost a child together.",
        "Barbara: And she walked out on you.",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, because she was in love with me, and I broke her heart.",
        "Barbara: Are you still in love with her? Is that why you're so determined to end things with us?",
        "Henry: Yes -- no, no. I don't know. [Henry stammers] You're not listening to what I'm saying here.",
        "Barbara: Because you don't know what you're saying. You're holding on to a memory of a romance that doesn't even exist anymore, and you're too afraid to admit it. Unless there's another reason.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Barbara: Maybe this has nothing to do with Vienna.",
        "Henry: It has everything to do with Vienna!",
        "Barbara: No, maybe it doesn't. Maybe you're just too afraid to tell me.",
        "Henry: To tell you what?",
        "Barbara: That you're embarrassed to be with me.",
        "Henry: Barbara, no, that's not true.",
        "Barbara: Then prove it to me. I'm tired of being your secret lover. I don't care if Katie has suspicions. If she's going to start making insinuations, so let her, okay? Let's just beat her to the punch.",
        "Henry: No, I -- I can't do that. I can't do that.",
        "Barbara: Why not? I mean, the way I see it, you have two choices. You can continue to lie to yourself and tell yourself that you have to take this second chance with Vienna, or you can just admit that everything you want is right here in front of you.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Henry: Barbara, don't. Barbara, don't. Please don't answer the door, okay? You don't know --",
        "Katie: I was afraid I'd find you here.",
        "Barbara: Your timing couldn't be more perfect.",
        "Katie: Why do you say that?",
        "Barbara: Because Henry has something he wants to say to you. Don't you, Henry? Come on, Henry. Here's your chance to prove me wrong.",
        "Katie: Whatever you have to say to me, Henry, you don't have to say right now, 'cause I need to talk to you first, in private. It's important.",
        "Henry: Yeah, of course.",
        "Barbara: Henry --",
        "Henry: No, uh, you heard what Katie said. She has to talk to me. Um, it's important. And -- and in private, so --",
        "Barbara: Well, there's my answer.",
        "Henry: No, it's not. No, I'm just saying we should have this conversation at another time.",
        "Barbara: There won't be another time.",
        "Henry: Barbara --",
        "Barbara: I think you should go.",
        "Henry: I will be coming back.",
        "Barbara: Don't bother.",
        "Henry: Look, just give me some time to sort this out.",
        "Barbara: You had your time and your chance!",
        "Katie: Henry, let's go.",
        "Henry: I just -- she is, uh -- she is really upset with me.",
        "Katie: She's not the only one. What the hell are you doing?",
        "Henry: Nothing. I'm not doing anything. I -- I just don't like when people are mad at me.",
        "Katie: You don't think I know what's going on here?",
        "Henry: Nothing's going on.",
        "Katie: Stop! I didn't buy your lame excuses when I saw you two together at Bob and Kim's wedding, and I'm not buying them now. Listen to me. Whatever Barbara has lured you into, you need to walk away. She's ruining your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You know, I -- I think there might be a little misunderstanding here. Actually a really big one.",
        "Reid: Well, I'm very curious to know what it is.",
        "Judd: I'll see you in court, Dr. Oliver.",
        "[Pager beeps]",
        "Reid: Hold on. I got to get back to the hospital. You'll have to fill me in later.",
        "Luke: Look, I am not Dr. Oliver's boyfriend, and he didn't send me here to talk to you, and I'm not trying to buy you off either. But what I am trying to do is save his career. He may be arrogant, but he's not incompetent. In fact, he's one of the best doctors I've ever seen. And if you go through with this lawsuit, you're not only going to destroy his career, but also the lives of a lot of people that he has to help. And that's not going to bring your daughter back either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm not accusing you of anything here, Mr. Ciccone. I'm just asking you a few questions about what happened to Dusty.",
        "Rocco: Yeah? Well, my experience with cops is always a little suspicion behind everything they say.",
        "Jack: You got a lot -- you got a lot of experience with cops, do you?",
        "Rocco: Where I grew up, it was hard not to. But we were talking about Dusty, not about me.",
        "Jack: From what we saw on the surveillance video, the assailant had quite a conversation with Dusty before they got into that fight.",
        "Rocco: What's your cop nose tell you that means?",
        "Jack: Like maybe he was trying to relay a message from someone else.",
        "Rocco: Yeah? That's a coward's way to work if you ask me. If I've got something to say, I say it to a man's face.",
        "Jack: I'm sure you do. But you do know people who work like that, right?",
        "Rocco: Everybody knows somebody who's a coward.",
        "Jack: Someone like Ralph Manzo?",
        "Rocco: What the hell has he got to do with anything?",
        "Jack: That's a really good question.",
        "Reid: Mr. Donovan's awake again?",
        "Jack: Uh, five minutes ago he was, yeah.",
        "Reid: Mr. Donovan, I'm Dr. Oliver. You don't know me. I'm the guy who saved your life. You're welcome. How are you feeling? Better?",
        "Dusty: I'm awake.",
        "Reid: And alive, so I'll take that as a yes. How's the old memory? Starting to remember things?",
        "Dusty: Bits and pieces.",
        "Reid: You haven't been able to tell Detective Snyder that much?",
        "Dusty: What's the point? Can't remember what's real and what's not.",
        "Reid: The point is you're in a lot better shape mentally than you're letting on.",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about?",
        "Reid: Come on. That might work with them. Not with me. I know that you're exaggerating your memory loss. What I want to know is why.",
        "Dusty: 'Cause Janet's life depends on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's interesting if you think about it.",
        "Rocco: What is?",
        "Jack: How both you and Ralph would benefit if Dusty were out of the picture.",
        "Rocco: Excuse me? That's one hell of an accusation. You're talking about the man my daughter loves!",
        "Jack: I know that, but it's not an accusation. More of a speculation.",
        "Rocco: You can keep your speculations to yourself.",
        "Jack: You and Manzo are friends, right? More like family if the stories I hear are true.",
        "Rocco: Where are you going with this?",
        "Jack: Just that if Dusty dies, Ralph gets payback for being send to prison and you get a guy you don't like out of your daughter's life.",
        "Rocco: I'm no killer.",
        "Jack: Ralph is.",
        "Rocco: You got a lot of nerve, Detective. I know what's going on here. You're trying to force a case because you don't like me because of the way I treated my daughter. Go ahead and try! I've got nothing to hide! My conscience is clear!",
        "Jack: Why are you getting so riled up?",
        "Janet: Hey. What's going on here?",
        "Jack: Well, your dad and I were just talking about Dusty's situation, running through possible scenarios. Isn't that right, Mr. Ciccone?",
        "Rocco: Yeah, right. Just two guys talking.",
        "Janet: Yeah, it didn't sound like just two guys talking to me.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: I got to take this. Excuse me. Snyder.",
        "Janet: Okay, Pop, what's really going on?",
        "Rocco: Your ex has some hell of an imagination. That's all.",
        "Janet: Why? What did he say?",
        "Rocco: I'm not sure if I should say anything.",
        "Janet: Why not?",
        "Rocco: 'Cause I don't want to upset you.",
        "Janet: I won't get upset. Come on. Just tell me what's going on.",
        "Rocco: He's trying to link Ralph to Dusty's shooting. You hear what I said?",
        "Janet: Yeah. I heard you.",
        "Rocco: And?",
        "Janet: Ralph is the reason Jack's brother is dead, okay? So I can see where in Jack's mind that wouldn't be too farfetched.",
        "Rocco: He's wrong, Janet.",
        "Janet: Pop, I know you and Ralph were close. But he's done some terrible things to us. He held Teresa hostage, right? So Dusty helped put him in jail. I can see where Ralph might want to get some payback.",
        "Rocco: Maybe, but I've got nothing to do with it.",
        "Janet: Who says you do? Is Jack accusing you?",
        "Rocco: He hasn't come out and said it, but I can tell he's considering it. Same old thing, guilt by association.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no, no. I know Jack better than that. He would never assume something like that.",
        "Rocco: Well, maybe you don't know him as good as you think you do. Look, I can understand him not liking me on account of all that happened between me and you. But I'm trying really hard to make up for that.",
        "Janet: I know you are. And it means a lot to me. And Jack knows that, too.",
        "Rocco: Don't be too sure. He's looking to throw blame around. He doesn't like me. He doesn't like Ralph. Bam! Case closed in his mind.",
        "Janet: Hey, hey, Pop, give him a little credit, okay? He's a good cop.",

        "Rocco: Yeah. Yes, we will.",

        "Dusty: The best way to keep Janet safe was to pretend I can't remember what happened.",
        "Reid: I don't care how much or how little you tell people about anything. I don't want to be dragged into your cover-up. I'm here to make sure that you get better, not help you lie about what happened.",
        "Dusty: I'm not asking you to lie. I'm asking you to keep quiet.",

        "Katie: Come on, Henry. Really, Barbara?",
        "Henry: What's wrong with Barbara?",
        "Katie: Nothing -- except you have beautiful, loving Vienna at home waiting for you -- in tears, I might add.",
        "Henry: Really?",
        "Katie: Yes. She's devastated. She thinks you've lost all interest in her.",
        "Henry: Well, I haven't. I don't think so.",
        "Katie: You got to get a grip, seriously.",
        "Henry: I know, I know, I know.",
        "Katie: You really think you would be better off with Barbara than with Vienna?",
        "Henry: No, not in any rational kind of way.",
        "Katie: Well, rational is the only kind of way you should be thinking right now.",
        "Henry: I know that. But desire is an ornery, unpredictable creature.",
        "Katie: Is Vienna right? Have you fallen out of love with her?",
        "Henry: I don't know. I wish I could tell you that my feelings were as strong as they were before, but things have changed, and I don't know if I can go on pretending that they haven't.",
        "Katie: So that's it. Everything you've gone through, everything you've meant to each other is just gone?",
        "Henry: Maybe -- maybe I don't forgive her for leaving me.",
        "Katie: Oh, don't you dare use that excuse. She had every right to leave you.",
        "Henry: I know, I know. I know you're right. I broke her heart. God.",
        "Katie: Henry, Vienna is the love of your life. Why she's even with you is one of nature's great mysteries. But she is -- or was.",
        "Henry: I'm not that bad of a catch.",
        "Katie: No, you're not, but she's the perfect catch, and you caught her.",
        "Henry: I know, I know, I know.",
        "Katie: And what you guys have was so amazing, so magical.",
        "Henry: It was earth-shaking.",
        "Katie: And you're just going to throw it away for a couple quickies with Barbara Ryan?",
        "Henry: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't make it sound so tawdry.",
        "Katie: It is tawdry.",
        "Henry: Maybe to you it is, but not to me.",
        "Katie: You're saying what you and Barbara have is special?",
        "Henry: I don't know what it is. That's what I'm trying to figure out, all right?",
        "Katie: Okay, here's what you need to hear. Vienna hates herself for leaving.",
        "Henry: She does?",
        "Katie: Yes! Why do you think she came back? She knows she made a mistake, and she can't live without you. But now she's worried that you've learned to live without her.",
        "Henry: She doesn't know about Barbara and me, does she? You haven't told her?",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no! Of course not. But I figured it out. It's only a matter of time before she does, too. And Barbara does not seem to want to keep it on the down low anymore.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know, I know.",
        "Katie: So do the right thing. Leave Barbara. Go where you belong -- with Vienna.",

        "Jack: That was the station. Just work.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no. I mean with my father. He thinks that you're trying to accuse him of having something to do with Dusty's shooting.",
        "Jack: I was asking him questions about Ralph Manzo.",
        "Janet: Do you really think Manzo had something to do with this?",
        "Jack: I think it's a definite possibility, yeah.",
        "Janet: Okay, then you can't possibly think that my father had a part in this.",
        "Jack: I'm not implying that he was -- he was the one to pull the trigger, no. But he was very defensive just at the conversation.",
        "Janet: Well, can you blame him? He thought you were accusing him.",
        "Jack: Janet, what -- don't you think it's a little odd that the guy shows up after 18 years of not even wanting to talk to you?",
        "Janet: He's here because Liberty is sick.",
        "Jack: So why is he sticking around?",
        "Janet: Because, Jack, it's never too late to make up for the things that you've done wrong.",
        "Jack: Well, I certainly hope that is the case here.",
        "Janet: It is the case, so please stop trying to chase him away.",
        "Jack: I'm not.",
        "Janet: Look, Ralph had us all fooled, okay? We had no idea what he was capable of. And my father is nothing like him. And the fact that he is here to make amends to me and Liberty proves that.",
        "Jack: Okay, what would you have me do?",
        "Janet: [Sighs] I would have you lighten up on him, okay? Please, just give him a break.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Janet: He's here to say he is sorry. And since he's been here, he's meant a lot to me. He has done a lot for me.",
        "Jack: All I have, Janet, are my instincts. And they're telling me that something's off.",
        "Janet: Your instincts are wrong. So stop treating my father like he is a criminal.",

        "Reid: Mr. Donovan, in case you haven't noticed, \"Empathy\" is not a word that's usually associated with me, and I don't get involved in my patients' personal problems.",
        "Dusty: Stay out of it. That's all I'm asking.",
        "Reid: Yeah, it sounds like you're asking for a little more.",
        "Dusty: No. Just time to get my facts straight.",

        "Janet: What does that mean exactly?",
        "Reid: He's no longer in any danger physically, but, uh, mentally he's a little cloudy. He -- he may have trouble communicating.",
        "Rocco: What about his memory of the shooting?",
        "Reid: He doesn't seem to be able to remember much about the actual incident.",
        "Rocco: Will it stay that way?",
        "Reid: His memory could take days, weeks, even months to come back, if then.",
        "Janet: Well, is there anything we can do to help?",
        "Reid: Just give him room. Don't expect too much. Don't push him. Excuse me.",
        "Rocco: You okay?",
        "Janet: No. I mean, I -- I thank God that Dusty's okay, and I want to find out who did this to him. But at the same time, I don't, because knowing might put him in more danger.",
        "Rocco: Maybe we should listen to his doctor and let him get some more rest. I was thinking of dropping by and spending some time with Liberty. You want a ride home?",
        "Janet: No, Pop. I want to stay with Dusty, okay?",
        "Rocco: Okay.",
        "Janet: Oh, hey, listen. Don't be mad at Jack for what he was saying before. He -- he's just doing his job.",

        "Katie: Vienna loves you for who you are, not who she wants you to be.",
        "Henry: I don't think that's true! The only reason that she came back is because I'm donating my money to build that hospital wing.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and you did.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, because you pushed me into it.",
        "Katie: So what if I pushed you? You still did it. And if Vienna ever pushes you, it's because she wants you to be the best man you can be.",
        "Henry: Yeah, sometimes I think she wants more of me than is possible, and that's why I keep letting her down. Do you have any idea how hard it is to live a life like that?",
        "Katie: True love isn't supposed to be easy.",
        "Henry: Who cares about easy? I'll take manageable. I mean, believe me, it is a lot easier being with Barbara.",
        "Katie: How is it easier?",
        "Henry: There are no expectations. I can be who I am, and she can be who she is.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. That's fine if you want to be with a lying, deceitful, manipulative, shallow --",
        "Henry: I -- I don't see her that way, all right?",

        "Katie: Yeah, I did. Um --",
        "Vienna: So how did it go? What did he say?",
        "Katie: He's kind of having a hard time right now, Vienna. He -- he feels like he's not living up to your standards.",
        "Vienna: My standards? I just want him to be all that I know that he can be.",
        "Katie: That's what I tried to tell him. But now you're going to need to convince him. I've done all I can.",

        "Luke: Well, consider it an apology.",
        "Reid: Apology for what?",
        "Luke: For speaking with Mr. Judd. I went behind your back, and I can only assume that you are probably pretty angry at me.",
        "Reid: Why?",
        "Luke: Because I butted my nose into your business. But just so you know, I -- I didn't go and speak with him because I -- I wanted to buy him off. I just -- I wanted to make that lawsuit just disappear.",
        "Reid: Sounds like the same thing to me.",
        "Luke: That sounds like something Noah would say.",

        "Luke: Wow! I actually impressed you. Must be one for the record books.",
        "Reid: You went to bat for me, however ill-conceived an attempt it might have been. It took guts, especially the way I've been treating you lately. I appreciate the gesture.",

        "Katie: If you think what you have is happiness, then you have a big problem.",
        "Barbara: Henry has realized he needs more than a superficial girl with a funny accent. He needs a sophisticated, intelligent woman who plays at his level.",
        "Katie: This little tryst that you two have going on has him confused. He's forgotten what really matters.",
        "Barbara: Happiness is all that matters, wherever and however you find it.",
        "Katie: Yes, and he had happiness with Vienna. They had a wonderful life together. They had a business. They were starting a family.",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm, and then reality set in.",
        "Katie: Do you really think you can offer him everything that Vienna can?",
        "Barbara: I can offer Henry everything he wants, and I won't walk out when the going gets tough.",
        "Katie: Oh, you mean like Vienna did?",
        "Barbara: You said it, Honey, not me.",
        "Katie: You bring out the worst in him, and I am telling you, I refuse to stand by and watch you drag my best friend into your lonely --",
        "Barbara: Let me tell you something! This is not about you! You have nothing to do with this! And it is none of your business!",
        "Katie: Well, I'm making it my business, starting right now. What I'm saying bothers you, Barbara, because you know it's true.",
        "Barbara: What I know to be true is this -- is that Henry is a big boy. He can choose his life and women as he chooses.",
        "Katie: Well, he's not going to choose you.",
        "Barbara: You found him here earlier, didn't you?",
        "Katie: That doesn't mean anything.",
        "Barbara: Let me tell you something you don't know about Henry. He doesn't need some perky little guardian angel with her own inferiority issues trying to lead him around.",
        "Katie: Doesn't it bother you that Henry is your son's brother?",
        "[Barbara laughs]",
        "Katie: That practically makes him your stepson. And you're sleeping together? How creepy and disgusting is that?",
        "Barbara: We are not related. Paul and Henry are half-brothers, simply put.",
        "Katie: You were married to their father.",
        "Barbara: Is that the best you can do?",
        "Katie: How many times have you been arrested?",
        "Barbara: Excuse me? What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Katie: Trouble follows you around like a heat-seeking missile ready to destroy anything in its path.",
        "Barbara: You have a lot of nerve preaching to me when your life story reads like a how-to manual of how to mess it up! You know what? Your life's miseries and lies stretches far as your wedding trains all tied together.",
        "Katie: I am only thinking about what is best for Henry.",
        "Barbara: And so am I. And I am so sorry you're having a difficult time trying to realize that I make him happy. But then maybe you don't remember what it's even like to be happy. But that's no reason to punish the rest of us about it.",
        "Katie: Do you love Henry?",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Katie: You heard me. Do you love him?",
        "Barbara: No. No, no. And he doesn't love me. I mean, that's not a complication that we want.",
        "Katie: See? That is where you're wrong. Henry does want love. He wants it very badly. You don't know him, Barbara, not like I do.",
        "Barbara: Get out.",
        "Katie: He wants a decent, uncomplicated life with someone who loves him back, and he wants to start a family, and that's never going to happen with you, and you know it. So if you care about him like you say you do, you will walk away.",

        "Henry: I -- I need to explain something.",

        "Henry: Yes, I do, I do. I've been behaving horribly and confusing you and making you feel like you've done something wrong, and that's completely unfair to you.",
        "Vienna: No, because I hurt you by leaving you, making you feel that you weren't good enough for me.",
        "Henry: You left me because I drove you away. That's my fault, not your fault. So let's just -- let me explain so this makes sense.",
        "Vienna: No, I really don't need an explanation, Henry.",
        "Henry: Why not?",
        "Vienna: Because it's in the past, and I don't think we should live in the past anymore.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Vienna: We have both acted like fools, Henry. But it's done. It's gone. So let's just wash it away and start fresh.",

        "Vienna: I did. I want to marry, Henry. I want to be your wife.",
        "Henry: I -- we had talked about this, and you said that that was not a game that we wanted to play.",
        "Vienna: Yes, I know, I know. But this time it's right for us. I know it. I can feel it in my heart.",
        "Henry: Are you sure?",
        "Vienna: Yes. I'm sure. I know what's wrong. I know what the problem has been ever since I came back.",
        "Henry: You do?",
        "Vienna: Yes. When I went away, I broke our bond, and now you don't feel that you can trust me, that I haven't really forgiven you.",
        "Henry: No, no, I do trust you. It's not --",
        "Vienna: No, but if we get married, Henry, you will know in the bottom of your heart that everything is forgiven and forgotten. Henry Coleman, will you marry me?",
