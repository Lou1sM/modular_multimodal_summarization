        "Alison: I'm sorry, Tish. It's not like I meant to shove your head down the toilet, I just sort of -- slipped. Yeah, like she's really going to buy that.",
        "Chris: Guess who?",
        "Alison: You weren't supposed to be working this shift.",
        "Chris: Yeah, they called me in to do a double. What's wrong?",
        "Alison: Just watching out for my supervisor. You haven't seen Tish around, have you?",
        "Chris: No. But I've been looking for you.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Chris: Because I had to tell you -- that dress you wore last night? Awesome.",
        "Alison: You already told me that -- when you were taking it off me.",
        "Chris: Yes, but the guys who were there last night -- they were talking about you while we were doing rounds.",
        "Alison: Really? Why, what were they talking about?",
        "Chris: They said that I have a gorgeous and amazing girlfriend.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, I'm not so sure everyone is nuts about me.",
        "Chris: Everybody loves you.",
        "Tish: There she is! Arrest her!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You've reached Jack Snyder, of the Oakdale Police Department. Leave your name and number after the beep.",
        "Craig: Jack, its Craig. Listen, I hope you're away from your desk, because you're busily pursuing leads about what's going on with my Rosanna. The strange way she's been acting -- springing De Grassi -- so urgent about pushing through the divorce. Anyway, meet me at Metro, will you?",
        "Lucy: What's so urgent? You said you needed to talk to me?",
        "Craig: You came! When you didn't call --",
        "Lucy: Look, I can't stay. But you said it was important.",
        "Craig: Well, a letter came for you today from Williams College.",
        "Lucy: The fellowship I applied for?",
        "Craig: Yeah, open it. Open it!",
        "Lucy: If it's no after everything that's happened I -- I just might lose it.",
        "Craig: And if it's yes?",
        "Lucy: I will definitely lose it.",
        "Craig: Do you want me to open it for you?",
        "Lucy: No.",
        "Craig: Yes!",
        "Lucy: Yes!",
        "Craig: Yes, ohh! Congratulations! I knew you had it. I knew you had it. See? See? I knew we were going to celebrate today. Just you and me, like old days. Huh?",
        "Lucy: Daddy, I really can't stay.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, wait, wait -- we have a lot to catch up on.",
        "Lucy: Maybe another time.",
        "Craig: I have news to tell you about Rosanna.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Jennifer, I don't understand why we have to sit down and have a meeting before you'll tell me what it is that's going on.",
        "Jennifer: It's important.",
        "Paul: Okay, well, then say it. Tell me. Whatever it is. We don't have time for this. We have a business to run. We really should be back at the office.",
        "Jennifer: Can we just go inside please?",
        "Paul: Not if this is about Jordan Sinclair.",
        "Jennifer: He's concerned.",
        "Paul: I don't care.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I do. And you should.",
        "Paul: I was the CEO of the company when he was still in high school. I'm not going to let Jordan Sinclair interfere with anything that I do.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan has a very good reason to believe that you never really forgave mom. And that the only reason that you're back to B.R.O. is to publicly humiliate her and to take the company from her.",
        "Paul: That's ridiculous.",
        "Jennifer: He said that you were going to have Carly Tenney replace her.",
        "Paul: And you believed him?",
        "Jennifer: I really don't know what to believe right now, Paul. Let's eat.",

        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Oh, you're early. I was going to be wearing something really sexy when you walked in.",
        "Jack: This works for me. What's this?",
        "Carly: It's my portfolio. Paul sent my designs back this morning.",
        "Jack: So, this -- this is it, huh?",
        "Carly: Yeah. My deal with Paul is totally and completely off. I am a free agent, a woman of leisure, a seductress intent upon wooing her man --",
        "Jack: You sure? You looked sad when I walked in.",
        "Carly: So, it'll take me a little longer to get my big break. Backing away from that deal with Paul was the right decision.",
        "Jack: Because that's what Rosanna wanted.",
        "Carly: No, don't start in on her. It's what I want, too. I'm through with Paul Ryan and his wacko mother. And I couldn't be happier about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Nice to see you again! Would you please join me?",
        "Walker: Certainly --",

        "Walker: So, you had another episode last night?",
        "Barbara: A headache worse than usual.",
        "Walker: And your vision was impaired?",
        "Barbara: Yes.",
        "Walker: How long?",
        "Barbara: I'd say over an hour.",
        "Walker: Your episodes have increased from a few minutes to over an hour? Barbara, we need to know what we're dealing with, here. You can't put off this treatment.",
        "Barbara: I just need help managing my pain, that's all.",
        "Walker: Painkillers will not help you manage a tumor! If you put off this treatment, this tumor could be fatal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tish: Of course there's no doubt in my mind. I'm this woman's supervisor, and I'm giving you a positive I.D. It was Alison Stewart who attacked me last night.",
        "Chris: What? That's crazy.",
        "Alison: Chris, I'll handle this, okay?",
        "Chris: What? And let her steamroll you for something you didn't even do? No way. Alison was with me last night. All night. We went to a fund-raiser for the Rose Foundation and then I took her home. Okay, we were together the whole time.",
        "John: Tish says the attack took place in the women's room. Now I assume you don't go into the women's room with Alison.",
        "Chris: There was a party going on, John. Don't you think that if Alison decked somebody in the ladies room, somebody would have noticed?",
        "Tish: Yeah, well, she waited until we were all alone and then she viciously attacked me.",
        "Cop: I have to take her in, doctor.",
        "Alison: I have to go to jail? Just like that?",
        "Chris: Yeah, she doesn't even get a chance to defend herself?",
        "Alison: Chris -- just calm down, okay?",
        "Chris: What kind of vindictive game are you playing, here, Tish? Because if this is about you and me --",
        "Tish: It isn't.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, it's not getting you anywhere. Okay, there's nothing between us now and there never will be.",
        "Tish: Yeah, well, don't flatter yourself. I'm not doing this because I'm jealous! I'm doing it because that -- that -- animal that you are so taken with -- she pushed me into a bathroom room stall and --",
        "John: Tish says that Alison dunked her head in the toilet.",
        "Chris: John, that's crazy.",
        "Alison: Chris -- it's true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: And Rosanna insisted I sign the papers right then. She didn't want to talk about it. She didn't want to have any kind of a waiting period. It had to be right then, right there. Right. So I signed.",
        "Lucy: So, you're getting divorced -- again?",
        "Craig: Why are you so surprised? I thought you and Rosanna would have talked about this by now. Right?",
        "Lucy: I have to go.",
        "Craig: What's the rush?",
        "Lucy: Thank you for getting the letter to me. If it hadn't been for you, I never would have applied for the fellowship.",
        "Craig: Oh, sweetie, listen, I'm your father. You never have to thank me for looking out for your best interests.",
        "Lucy: I'll see you.",
        "Craig: What did I say?",
        "Lucy: Well, grandmother's expecting me. I told her that I was meeting you here, but I should get back.",
        "Craig: Lullaby, I just told you my wife forced a sudden divorce on me -- out of the blue -- and you can't even say \"gee willikers, Dad, that's too bad.\" You're heading off for the hills. What is that? And we can't even celebrate your fellowship?",
        "Lucy: Look, Daddy, I don't know anything about Rosanna. But I can't fix the things that went on between you two.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Lucy: I didn't know Rosanna filed for divorce. She hasn't even talk to me since she got back in town.",
        "Craig: Why not?",
        "Lucy: I guess she's divorced me, too.",
        "Craig: Oh, sweetness, come on, Rosanna's not going to do that. Rosanna loves you. You know that.",
        "Lucy: Don't use me, Daddy.",
        "Craig: I would never --",
        "Lucy: Please. We both know Craig Montgomery will use anybody, anytime, anywhere to get whatever he wants.",
        "Craig: What does Craig Montgomery want now?",
        "Lucy: You want Rosanna back. You think that she'll confide in me, and then I can tell you everything she's said.",
        "Craig: You give me too much credit.",
        "Lucy: Well, obviously, Rosanna knows you as well as I do, because she's stayed away. And now, because of you, I've lost her, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So Jordan Sinclair starts talking trash, running his mouth about how I want to sabotage mother. And instead of telling him that he's full of it, you decide --",
        "Jennifer: I did tell him.",
        "Paul: Well, then why are we still talking about --?",
        "Jennifer: Then he told me where he got his information.",
        "Paul: What, tea leaves?",
        "Jennifer: Rosanna.",
        "Paul: Oh.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that's not the reaction that I expected. Are you saying that it's true?",
        "Paul: No. But I've -- I've done something that you don't know about. It hurt Rosanna, and I can understand why she'd want to make trouble for me.",
        "Jennifer: What did you do?",
        "Paul: Well, you remember how Craig Montgomery tried to set me up.",
        "Jennifer: For Rose's murder? Yeah, you didn't act like it mattered then.",
        "Paul: Well, it mattered. [Taps coffee cup] And I got a hold of something about Craig. Some information.",
        "Jennifer: Oh God, Paul, what did you do?",
        "Paul: The adoption that Craig and Rosanna -- it was an illegal -- adoption. And it wasn't Rosanna, you know. It was Craig. It was everything that he did. It was his deal. His cover-up.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, you're responsible for Rosanna losing her baby?",
        "Paul: Well, he was gonna just -- you know -- keep going like there wasn't -- anything to do except wait for a happy ending. That wasn't gonna come.",
        "Paul: I wanted her to know that he was a lying, manipulative piece of garbage.",
        "Jennifer: Right. And you are the all-knowing, perfect judge. Paul, Rose hurts you and you humiliate her in front of the whole town. Craig hurts you and you take his child away! And if your friend Rosanna gets a little bruised in the fight, well, then that's tough, because all is fair as long as Paul gets his revenge!",
        "Paul: As soon as I did it, I knew that I'd made a mistake.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan's right, isn't he? You do have some master plot going on against Mom.",
        "Paul: No. I -- currently do not have any plan in place to hurt Barbara in any way.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that sounds like a very clearly worded press release.",
        "Paul: What do you want from me, Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: I want more than just a sound bite, Paul! I don't want you claiming that you've changed. I want the real deal. I want our family working together again and loving each other and depending on each other.",
        "Paul: Well, that's what we have.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, until your plans change, Paul!",
        "Paul: Jennifer --",
        "Jennifer: No, it's what you do! You get angry, but you don't act. And then you sit and you stew and you wait and you plan.",
        "Paul: Look, if you're not going to listen to me --",
        "Jennifer: I'm through listening, Paul. Because whatever you're going to do to Mom, whatever plan you have, you better drop it. Unless you're planning on losing me, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I can't die. I won't let my company die, now.",
        "Walker: Barbara, you're not listening --",
        "Barbara: Walker, listen to me. I have made a lot of mistakes in my life. I haven't been just a misguided and inadequate mother. I have damaged my children. And now I have a chance to give them the kind of life that I could have given them if I hadn't gone off the deep end. And I will not walk away from that chance and walk into a hospital. I won't do it.",
        "Walker: What do you think it's going to do to them if you die? What do you think they're going to say, Barbara, if they know you could have saved your life and you didn't?",
        "Barbara: I need time.",
        "Walker: This tumor is not going to give you time, Barbara. That spell you had the other night? There's going to be more of these -- as this tumor keeps growing and pushing against your optic nerve. You're not going to be able to keep hiding this. You need to get help. Did you just hear what I just said?",
        "Barbara: I most certainly did. I need to -- I need to go see someone right now. If you'll excuse me.",
        "Walker: What about the treatment?",
        "Barbara: Well, if this works out, maybe I can have that treatment and save my company, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Bonnie and Sarah get off all right?",
        "Jessica: Yeah. For the first time in her life, bonnie was actually early. And all the way to the airport, they just talked about their plans. Where they're going to live -- where Sarah was going to go to school -- so excited and happy.",
        "Ben: I talked to Isaac this morning. He's pretty happy, too.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. Everybody's happy.",
        "Ben: How about you?",
        "Jessica: I'm happy. I mean -- just think about all the free time that this gives me.",
        "Ben: Hey, come on. This is me you're talking to.",
        "Jessica: Well, of course I'm going to miss them. But -- that doesn't mean I can't enjoy myself anyway. I mean, after all, I've got a brand-spanking-new husband. Tell you what --",
        "Ben: What? Jessica: Why don't you take the rest of the day off, and I'll show you how happy I really am.",
        "Ben: Ooh!",
        "Jessica: We'll have the house to ourselves. Curtis is gong to be very, very late.",
        "Ben: I want to.",
        "Jessica: Uh-huh, so let's go.",
        "Ben: You don't know how much I want to.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Ben: Okay. I can't. I can't, honey. I have patients. I've got a major surgery scheduled.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Ben: Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey --",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry. I promised myself I wouldn't do this. I wasn't gonna be sad. This is the best thing for Bonnie and Sarah. But, it just feels like --",
        "Ben: Like what?",
        "Jessica: Like everybody's got somewhere to go. Everybody but me.",

        "John: You are officially on suspension.",
        "Cop: Come along, miss.",
        "Alison: You had this all planned, all along! Didn't you?! You made me crazy on purpose!",
        "Tish: The girl is completely irrational. Excuse me, I have to go for my MRI.",
        "John: Alison, I'm sorry. You know, off the record, I think half the staff wouldn't mind doing to her what you did. But I have no choice.",
        "Alison: I couldn't help it. It just happened!",
        "Chris: Alison, you could have walked away. You could have yelled at her. But you had to put your hands on her. You have a record, Alison. Do you have any idea what they could do to you?",
        "Alison: Just please don't be mad at me.",
        "Cop: Let's go.",
        "Chris: I'll come.",
        "Alison: No, I don't want you to get into trouble. Just finish your rounds. I'll be fine.",
        "Chris: All right. Don't say anything more than you already have. I'll call Tom.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Sure, I asked about Rosanna. I thought you'd spoken to her, that's all. Conversation.",
        "Lucy: Really?",
        "Craig: You know what Craig Montgomery really wants to do? He wants to spend time with you. He wants to see that smile. He is so proud of you for snagging that fellowship. And I miss you. I miss you so much. How's your life?",
        "Lucy: It's -- it's a mess.",
        "Craig: A mess? What's the biggest mess? School? Lucinda?",
        "Lucy: You don't want to hear about my problems.",
        "Craig: What does that mean? You saving these conversations for someone else? Has Paul Ryan turned you so completely against your father?",
        "Lucy: You don't have to worry about Paul. I don't like him anymore. And if you do some kind of victory dance, I'm going to walk out of here.",
        "Craig: What did Paul do to earn your hatred?",
        "Lucy: I don't hate him.",
        "Craig: You will. What? Go ahead.",
        "Lucy: I know that he's the one who told the police about Cabot's adoption.",
        "Craig: Ah, at last! At last somebody gets a hint that Mr. Best Friend Paul Ryan is actually self-obsessed and rotten to the core.",
        "Lucinda: Only that rotter has a few good spots left, whereas you, Craig, have none.",

        "Jack: Are you sure you want to walk away, honey? This is what you wanted.",
        "Carly: I want to design, Jack, because it's what I was meant to do. But I'm not going to go through one more round of sneaking behind Barbara's back trying to stage a coup.",
        "Jack: That can be dangerous for your health.",
        "Carly: This way, it's clean. I'm not scamming anybody. I'm not lurking around in shadows having secret meetings. It's gonna be tougher, doing it on my own. But I can do it.",
        "Jack: I'll see you after work.",
        "Carly: Oh, sorry about the lack of lunch.",
        "Jack: Oh, with you I can live on love.",

        "Jennifer: But have you really forgiven her completely? Did you mean it?",
        "Paul: No. I don't think I could ever completely forgive Mother for what she did to me. Not to mention Will, or Rose. Please sit down. Hey, you wanted the truth. Please. Sit down.",
        "Jennifer: You know, it's hard for me to get past it, too.",

        "Jennifer: I think she wants to.",
        "Paul: There is no secret plot, okay? I don't have Carly Tenney waiting in the wings to take over Barbara's position at B.R.O. I don't. It's a brilliant plan. Really, it's a great plan. But it's just not happening.",

        "Barbara: May I come inside?",
        "Carly: So where's your pal, Stenbeck? Is he out there up on the telephone pole pretending to fix the cable? Or maybe you've got him in the back of your car, in a coffin full of Transylvanian soil.",
        "Barbara: I deserve that. But if I could please come in. I'd like to talk to you.",
        "Carly: I've seen enough vampire movies to know that if you don't invite them in, they can't get you.",
        "Barbara: This was a mistake.",
        "Carly: Hey! What kind of help do you need?",

        "Barbara: I know that you are starting your own line, Carly. So you're quite busy --",
        "Carly: What is it that you want, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: I want you to join B.R.O. as a designer.",
        "Carly: Gee, that sounds swell! Almost as inviting as that offer from the hot Paris designer a couple of years ago! Do you remember that, Barbara? When I flew off to Paris and ended up in some wacko doctor's spa in Switzerland?",
        "Barbara: This isn't a trick, Carly. I'm being quite sincere.",
        "Carly: That ain't possible.",
        "Barbara: And if you feel uncomfortable working with me directly, you can work with Paul or Jordan Sinclair.",
        "Carly: Why would I work for you at all? I'm not an assistant, Barbara. I'm a designer.",
        "Barbara: Which is why -- if you accept this offer and agree to come on at B.R.O. -- I'll make you a partner.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. For one hallucinating moment there, I thought you say that you'd make me a -- partner. Why would you want to make a partner of someone with, \"a modest little talent\"? Isn't that what you said to me, the last time we locked horns?",

        "Lucinda: Right, the chocolate decadence cake at Al's?",
        "Lucy: Sure.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, don't you forget. Because they do sell out so fast.",
        "Lucy: Yes, Grandmother.",
        "Craig: She is --",
        "Lucy: Don't say it.",
        "Craig: I have to. She is a breath of foul air. Sit down. Come on, sit down. Thank you for staying with me.",
        "Lucy: I wasn't finished. I'm mad at Paul for tipping off the police about Cabot. But what you did to Rosanna and me with your lies --",
        "Craig: What I did was make a mistake in judgment. All right? And I pay for that every day, okay? But if you're going to look at me straight on, you'd better look at him. All right? He weaseled his way into Rosanna's life, and she's gone. He weaseled his way into your life, and you're gone. From the house, not -- not my heart. Never my heart.",
        "Lucy: You don't have to say that.",
        "Craig: When -- when did you start thinking you were so insignificant to me? I'm your father. I will always be your father. You're the most important thing in the world to me. And I miss you. Will you please be my little girl again? Please? Because -- because I need you. I need you now, more than ever. As much as you need me.",

        "Lucy: I can't move back in with you, Daddy.",

        "Craig: One thing about Rosanna. Rosanna's having a very hard time, all right? And maybe she doesn't say anything to you because she doesn't know what to say.",
        "Lucy: She knows I love her.",
        "Craig: Maybe she needs reminding. I think right now she could really use someone to talk to.",
        "Lucy: Anything that Rosanna says to me is between the two of us. I will not be your spy.",

        "Barbara: Well, yes. Yes, of course. So you asked me, why now? Because I got a late start and I'm under the gun. And when I started thinking about adding a designer to my team, I came up with a lot of names of good designers, but not brilliant ones. And that's why you. Because -- for my kids. And all kinds of reasons -- I can't afford to have this show be anything less than brilliant.",
        "Carly: You hate my guts.",
        "Barbara: But I love your work. Come on, Carly. The first time that we worked together, we brought out the best in each other. Creatively, at least.",
        "Carly: That was a long time ago, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, it was. And I was married to Gal. And Jen was in high school. And Will was a little -- excuse me. I'm getting a little sentimental these days.",
        "Carly: It's still your company. It's your crew. I'm not going to let you run me.",
        "Barbara: I need a partner -- someone who understands the workings and the design philosophy of B.R.O. and who can step up if I need to step back.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you step back? You're gonna be barking orders from the grave.",
        "Barbara: Yeah. Maybe beyond. Oh, come on, Carly. We don't know what the future holds for any of us. Do we? And I know you don't trust me. And I understand why. But I've had a wake-up call recently.",
        "Carly: Will?",

        "Ben: Is there any word on when you're going to be able to start practicing law again?",
        "Jessica: No. Maybe I should just take up macram\u00e9.",
        "Ben: Hmm. Or take up belly dancing.",

        "Tish: Well, maybe she should have thought of that before she went in after me. And maybe you should get real and start dealing with what a delinquent your little girlfriend is!",

        "Aaron: Oh, relax, please. It's not that bad.",
        "Alison: No, I totally embarrassed Chris in front of everyone at the hospital -- and that's after I showed up drunk in front of Kim Hughes and blew his entire savings on that condo. And now I don't even have a job.",
        "Aaron: You know, I might be able to help you out with that.",
        "Alison: I am not working at your Dad's stables. Wait -- wait, doesn't Lily co- own that TV station with Chris' Mom? Maybe you could talk to her about making me a weather girl or something, and then Kim would have to go with it. That would be really cool, Aaron.",

        "Lucy: Okay, being mad at you is one thing, but being mean is another. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.",
        "Paul: I never intended for you to get hurt, Lucy -- you or Cabot. Or Rosanna. When I made that phone call to the Canadian authorities, I wasn't thinking about who would get hurt. And I know that this is too little too late, but I'm really sorry. And Lucy, the friendship that we had -- was really important to me.",
