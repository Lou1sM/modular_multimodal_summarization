        "Alison: Were you as busy as I was today?",
        "Chris: I've seen enough lacerations and fractures to last awhile. Sorry we didn't catch up at the hospital earlier.",
        "Alison: Oh, it's okay. I was busy directing gurneys and calming down patients. I really needed this break.",
        "Chris: You need more than a break. You need another adventure with Dr. Danger.",
        "Alison: Dr. Danger? Are you a comic book character now?",
        "Chris: I'm serious. Kite flying was too safe for us. We need to take it up a notch. How does bungee jumping sound to you?",
        "Alison: I think I read about that in a book. \"A hundred things to do before you die.\" Try that one first, and you skip the rest.",
        "Chris: Got any other ideas?",
        "Alison: Well, I was looking at this rock climbing wall. I was thinking about trying out, but it might be too tame for you.",
        "Chris: Trust me to hold your safety line?",
        "Alison: You've got strong arms, you can catch me.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm going to get all this stuff together, put it in the attic.",
        "Jack: I'll give you a hand.",
        "Carly: No, Jack -- no. You just keep me company, okay?",
        "Jack: That doesn't make me feel useful.",
        "Carly: You give yourself a break. You're getting stronger every day. Soon, you'll be all better, and you can go back to the farm. Which I'm not very happy about. I'm sort of used to having you here, you know? I'd like to keep it that way. [Phone rings] That could be Sage. She's at a sleepover. Hello?",
        "Dallas: Carly, hey, it's Dallas. Is Jack around?",
        "Carly: He's here, but he's sort of laying low. Can I help you with something?",
        "Dallas: Yeah, um, does he have a minute? I just need to talk to him about a case.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, Dallas, he's still recuperating.",
        "Dallas: Well, I could really use his input.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, it's just not a good time.",
        "Dallas: Okay. You know what, I understand. Umm, just tell him I said hey.",
        "Carly: Okay, I will. Bye.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Jack: Was that Sage?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Announcing your engagement, live on television? What were you thinking?",
        "Katie: Margo, stop. You are making a scene.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm not going to let you get married again.",
        "Brad: This is none of your business.",
        "Margo: Yes it is! My sister's in a very vulnerable state right now, and you're taking advantage of her.",
        "Brad: Katie loves me, I love her.",
        "Margo: This wedding is not going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Baseball season's starting, why don't we go to the batting cages? Do our own spring training?",
        "Alison: As you must recall, I was an all-star on the Oakdale Latin softball team.",
        "Chris: You think you can take me?",
        "Alison: Oh, I know I can.",
        "Chris: You, bats and a cage, it kind of sounds hazardous.",
        "Emily: I guess you didn't take my advice.",
        "Alison: I didn't ask for it.",
        "Emily: He's going to hurt you, Ali. Again.",
        "Alison: We're friends. We're just having coffee. You should go.",
        "Emily: Don't you see what he's doing?",
        "Chris: I don't think you're fit to give relationship advice.",
        "Emily: This is between me and my sister. Thank you very much.",
        "Alison: No, it's not. And I don't want to hear it anymore. This is my life. It's none of your business. So butt out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This new policy of being honest with you is really cramping my style.",
        "Jack: Who was it?",
        "Carly: Dallas.",
        "Jack: What did he want?",
        "Carly: Just a little input on a case.",
        "Jack: Thank you. I'm calling him back.",
        "[Jack chuckles]",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Dallas: Dallas Griffin.",
        "Jack: Dallas, its Jack.",
        "Dallas: Oh hey, how you doing, Man?",
        "Jack: Not bad. I'm better, what's up?",
        "Dallas: Oh nothing. Look, I'm prepping a case for court tomorrow, one of your collars. More questions about it though. I know it's a huge favor, but I don't want to bother Margo on her day off.",
        "Jack: No, it's cool. I can come in, just for a little while. It'll be good to get out of the house.",
        "Dallas: All right. All right, thanks, Jack.",
        "Jack: No problem. I'll see you soon. Not a word.",
        "Carly: I'll drive you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: You can't tell her what to do.",
        "Margo: Excuse me? This is between me and my sister.",
        "Brad: Excuse me, I think I'm just a little involved.",
        "Katie: Brad, please, just let me talk to Margo alone.",
        "Brad: No, she's going to mess with your head. You made your decision. She needs to respect it.",
        "Katie: I'm not going to let her talk me out of anything. Please, I have to deal with this.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. Okay, look, I'm going to be at the bar. But remember, we have a plane to catch.",
        "Katie: I have two words for you. Back off.",
        "Margo: No, no, no. No, no, Katie. I love you too much to let you make a mistake like this.",
        "Katie: Well, nothing you say or do can change my mind right now.",
        "Margo: Well, what am I supposed to do? Just sit back and let you ruin your life?",
        "Katie: You don't know Brad the way I do.",
        "Margo: Honey, you're on the rebound. You're leaping into something, you're not even considering the consequences.",
        "Katie: You're the one who told me to go after him if that's what I wanted.",
        "Margo: I told you to date him, not to marry him!",
        "Katie: Brad has spent the entire past year trying to prove to me how much he loves me.",
        "Margo: Do you love him?",
        "Katie: How can you ask me that?",
        "Margo: It's a real good question, because you're about to marry the brother of your ex-husband. And you're not even over Jack yet. You shouldn't be eloping. You shouldn't even be engaged right now.",
        "Katie: You are wrong about Brad, you just refuse to admit it. He makes me happy.",
        "Margo: Katie, you don't look happy.",
        "Katie: That's because you're turning on me when I need you the most.",
        "Margo: If you were doing the right thing, you wouldn't need me. But no, you're stubborn. And you're just going to rush right into this.",
        "Katie: I'm tired of being confused and miserable. I know I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I am trying to change that, okay? Do you know how painful it is to always be pulled in a million different directions?",
        "Margo: Yeah, I do. And I do know how hard this has been for you, and that is why I feel I want to help you.",
        "Katie: Good. Then give me your blessing.",
        "Margo: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I can drive myself.",
        "Carly: I'm offering you a ride, as a friend.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Carly. Sometimes friends need to give each other space.",
        "Carly: I didn't realize I was crowding you.",
        "Jack: I never said that. You'd be bored watching me work anyway. The only way I'm going to build up strength is by doing things on my own. If you baby me every step of the way, then I'll never get better.",
        "Carly: You get better, you leave.",
        "Jack: I'm not going to be at the station long, I promise. You need space from me, too.",
        "Carly: Will you be coming back?",
        "Jack: Where else would I go?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, my God.",
        "Mike: Long time no see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Getting involved with Chris is a mistake.",
        "Alison: We're having coffee, not dating.",
        "Emily: Yeah, yet.",
        "Alison: You're way out of line, Emily.",
        "Emily: Fine, you don't want to listen to me? Don't say I didn't warn you.",
        "Alison: Geez.",
        "Chris: Don't let her intimidate you.",
        "Alison: I could care less. She's just trying to make things difficult for us.",
        "Chris: Difficult for me, anyways.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Chris: Never mind, you have enough reasons to be mad at your sister already.",
        "Alison: No, what did Emily do now?",
        "Chris: She almost got me fired. I wouldn't put anything past her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Mom! Hey.",
        "Susan: Hey.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Susan: I'm almost done with my shift. Do you want to have dinner? On me.",
        "Emily: Oh. No, I can't. Sorry, I've got to head back to the office. But did you have a chance to talk to Alison about Chris?",
        "Susan: I spoke with her, but she's every bit as stubborn as you are. Alison always does what Alison wants to do.",
        "Emily: Right, because you never gave her the guidance she actually needed.",
        "Susan: Where's that coming from?",
        "Emily: Alison needs a firm hand, right? And clearly you are not the mother who can do that.",
        "Susan: You're in no position to lecture me on how I handle my children.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Emily: Of course, I'm in the position. I happen to be your daughter. I think I have the right. Don't go anywhere, we are not finished. Oh. Hi.",
        "Alison: Emily, I need to talk to you, privately.",
        "Emily: Fine. Fine, where are you?",
        "Alison: I'm still at Java.",
        "Emily: I'm on my way. Looks like I spoke too soon. I think Alison has finally come to her senses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Don't start a family feud because of me.",
        "Alison: Emily cannot get away with pulling a stunt like that.",
        "Chris: I'll stick around, back you up.",
        "Alison: No. No, I need to deal with Emily on my own. You go back to the hospital, I'll catch up with you later, okay?",
        "Chris: Good luck with her. You need it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Looks like you're getting ready for the Olympics.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, with three kids, there's always another sport. Tell me about this company you're working for.",
        "Mike: It's real estate. We are constructing houses with renewable energy. It's, you know, about preserving the environment. I'm really proud to be working for the company. I really feel like I can make a difference.",
        "Carly: Sounds very noble. The kids are always reminding me to shut out the lights and recycle. I'm surprised they haven't forced me to install solar panels.",
        "Mike: Are you thinking about making some upgrades? I could take a look around, make some suggestions.",
        "Carly: You'd have time for that, huh? I figured Oakdale was just a short stop on your world tour.",
        "Mike: I'm taking a break from traveling for a while. I got this business opportunity that's, you know, irresistible. I'm developing with Paul Ryan, the Snyder farm.",
        "Carly: Emma sold the farm to Paul Ryan?",
        "Mike: Yeah, she's, you know, going to keep the house and some of the land, but I am developing the acreage, with Emma's input.",
        "Carly: I surprised -- I'm shocked. I'm really surprised that she would even let Paul Ryan on her property. He's not exactly her favorite person.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I got the impression that she had some issues, but it's too good a deal to pass up. She's a little overwhelmed by the farm and didn't want to burden the family.",
        "Carly: It never occurred to me she'd give it up.",
        "Mike: People change their minds all the time.",
        "Carly: So does this mean that you're back in town for good, Mike?",
        "Mike: I'm not sure. It's going to take a little while to set the project up, and then it all depends.",
        "Carly: On what?",
        "Mike: More like, who.",
        "Carly: Of course. Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: No. No, I can't give you my blessings without feeling like a total hypocrite. I would feel like I was failing my sister.",
        "Katie: Well, I'm going through with it anyway, because I know its right in my heart.",
        "Margo: How do you know that? This man that you're so intent on marrying has a huge ego. He's never going to put you first.",
        "Katie: No, you're wrong. You're wrong. Brad is kind and thoughtful and wonderful. He was there the entire time when Jack broke my heart. He makes me laugh. I want it now. You already have it. You have the kids and the house and the husband. What is wrong with wanting to settle down?",
        "Margo: Well, what's wrong is that you're settling. That's what you're doing.",
        "Katie: Why can't you just be on my side? Please?",
        "Margo: I'm always on your side. All I can do is wish you luck. 'Cause -- you're going to need it.",
        "Brad: How did it go? Are you okay?",
        "Katie: I'm fine. Let's go get married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I knew you'd come to your senses.",
        "Alison: Yes, I have.",
        "Emily: All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I upset you, but I didn't want you to get your heart broken again. He's bad news.",
        "Alison: You know, I cut you some slack because you lost dusty and Chris left you -- and I thought -- I believed you were a decent, caring person who's had a couple of rough breaks, some of them my fault, but I guess I was completely wrong.",
        "Emily: This is coming from Chris.",
        "Alison: I can't believe you are so desperate that you can't stand anyone else being happy.",
        "Emily: What did he say to you? This is Chris talking, I know it. Because he would do anything to get back at me.",
        "Alison: You drugged his coffee, Emily. Almost got him fired. Chris could have killed a patient. You're lucky he didn't press charges and send you to jail.",
        "Emily: All right, it was a mistake. Okay, it was a mistake. I regretted it the minute I did it. But I had no idea he was going to go back to the hospital. I mean, you have to know I never intended to hurt anybody.",
        "Alison: Making excuses doesn't justify what you did. Do you ever think about anyone but yourself?",
        "Emily: I told you, it was a mistake.",
        "Alison: Oh, what a surprise.",
        "Emily: You know what, Alison? You think what you want about me, but I am here to tell you that Chris is the wrong guy for you. And I promise, I'm going to make sure you see that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I need to talk to you about my daughter.",
        "Chris: Which one?",
        "Susan: I am very concerned about Alison.",
        "Chris: You should be proud of her. She's doing a great job here.",
        "Susan: I am proud of her, but she's had a tough time and she's just back on track. She doesn't need you as a distraction.",
        "Chris: Alison and I are friends. We just hang out together. That's it.",
        "Susan: Leave my daughters alone.",
        "Chris: I have to check on a patient.",
        "Susan: Are you stacking up your conquests?",
        "Chris: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Susan: I've seen you with that young girl, Sofie Duran. You dump Emily, and you waste no time moving on with her. Does Alison know about her competition?",
        "Chris: I'm sure she'll hear all about it from you.",
        "Susan: She won't have to. You're a red hot topic around this hospital. But if you make Alison one of your locker room war stories, there'll be hell to pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know what? You have a history of messed up relationships. Really. I mean, first it's Chris, and then there's Aaron. Aaron was actually a pretty decent guy, but then you go back to Chris?",
        "Alison: So? You lose all the guys you care about and then sabotage all your relationships. Don't wreck mine.",
        "Emily: But why Chris, Ali? The guy cheated on you.",
        "Alison: He cheated on me with you! And now he and I are friends and you can't stand it because he dumped you.",
        "Emily: And why did he dump me? Huh? Why do you think he dumped me? Because he found out I was a prostitute. What do you think he's going to do when he finds out about your past?",
        "Alison: Why? Are you going to tell him?",
        "Emily: No. No, of course -- you know what? If you're so sure you have this real friendship with Chris, tell him yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: This is what you're talking about.",
        "Dallas: Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing because I was -- it's your day off. Why aren't you at home?",
        "Margo: Why aren't you working?",
        "Dallas: Okay --",
        "Margo: Ha ha, you mean Carly let you out of the house?",
        "Jack: Oh, man. No, Dallas needed help on a case.",
        "Margo: Okay, well I'm here. I can take care of it. Why don't you go home and you get better, and you come back here when you're 100% so you can keep me from losing my mind.",
        "Jack: Okay, in here. Now, please. Come on. Come on. What is going on with you?",
        "Margo: I just -- I'm having a moment. You know that moment when you realize that your foot is so far in your mouth. You know, that moment when you don't know if you did the right thing kind of moment.",
        "Jack: What happened?",
        "Margo: Katie -- and Brad happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: We're on flight 763 leaving to Vegas, can you tell us what gate that is?",
        "Ticket agent: Oh, it's gate six, but don't rush.",
        "Brad: Is it delayed?",
        "Ticket agent: No, it's gone.",
        "Brad: Oh!",
        "Katie: What? I'm so sorry. I made us miss our flight.",
        "Brad: No, no, no. It's not your fault. Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. When's the next flight?",
        "Ticket agent: Well, there is one leaving in two hours. That's wide open, you can book on that.",
        "Brad: Great, put us on that one. See, no problemo.",
        "Katie: Margo gets her wish.",
        "Brad: No, she doesn't. We are here, we're together. We're getting married.",
        "Katie: Two hours is a long time to sit around, hearing Margo's voice in my head, making me doubt every decision I've ever made.",
        "Brad: Forget her. She's got a big mouth. Okay, I know, coming from me, but still. You've just go to tune her out. We're going to be happy, whether she approves or not.",
        "Katie: You make it sound easy.",
        "Brad: It is. I have waited a long time for you. You know, two more hours is nothing. Oh, oh, check this out -- these are all the places that do instant weddings, legally binding. I'm thinking more traditional route. Elvis is a winner -- and then there's -- look, you can get married in a monster truck driving down the strip. That could be really tacky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I haven't seen Katie yet. I've been too busy, been taking care of business.",
        "Carly: Did Emma tell you anything?",
        "Mike: Well, she didn't volunteer anything and I didn't ask.",
        "Carly: Do you want to know?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I guess I do. Is Katie okay?",
        "Carly: Well, yes -- yes. She's fine. She can certainly take care of herself. I'm surprised you haven't seen her in any of the tabloids, Mike.",
        "Mike: Is she in some kind of trouble?",
        "Carly: She's always in some kind of trouble, or causing some kind of trouble.",
        "Mike: Well, don't keep me in suspense.",
        "Carly: Katie's become a celebrity of sorts. Definitely D-list, but she makes the papers. She's hosting a local morning talk show with Jack's brother, Brad.",
        "Mike: Well, looks like that butt-busting video she did finally paid off. How's that doing?",
        "Carly: What is it you really want to know?",
        "Mike: How about her personal life? Is she with anyone?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I know you hate waiting, but it's not going to make a difference.",
        "Katie: I'm not upset because we're delayed.",
        "Brad: This is your sister's fault. Why would she do this to you? You made a decision, the right decision, and she ruins it. She's going to get a piece of my mind when I get back. I'll tell you, no one get away with making my fianc\u00e9e cry.",
        "Katie: It doesn't matter. Margo already thinks I'm a disaster. How is it that she can make me feel so bad about myself?",
        "Brad: Typical sibling syndrome. Jack's like that, too. They always want you to think that they know better than you, but you just gotta -- you just gotta get over it. Ignore them.",
        "Katie: It just feels so wrong. Like we're starting off on the wrong foot. I don't know, we should be happy, but it feels wrong.",
        "Brad: I think I know exactly where you're going with this. So you need to tell me -- do you want to call it off?",
        "Katie: We've already wasted too much time. We are not calling off this wedding.",
        "Brad: Are you sure? Don't answer that question. I've waited a long time for you to come to your senses.",
        "Katie: It's just eloping -- no witnesses, no family, it just feels kind of weird.",
        "Brad: We can call Margo from Vegas when she's had time to calm down. She'll change her mind when it's official. She's won't be able to resist me as her brother-in-law.",
        "Katie: I just don't want us to start off our life with a big jinx hanging over us. Margo's been at all my weddings.",
        "Brad: Maybe Margo's the curse.",
        "Katie: It's just, don't you want your family there to watch us while we're saying our vows?",
        "Brad: All I need is you. You know what? If Margo's blessing is that important to you, then it's important to me.",
        "Katie: She's never going to accept it.",
        "Brad: Yes. I will make her see that we're good together. And when I'm done with her, she'll not only believe in us, but she will approve of this marriage. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Katie is eloping with Brad.",
        "Jack: Brad doesn't waste any time.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well -- as soon as I heard about it, I tried to stop it, but there was nothing I could do. I -- you know -- how -- I can't convince to her that Katie's making the biggest mistake of her life.",
        "Jack: It's Katie's choice, Margo.",
        "Margo: It's your fault, Jack.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Margo: Yes! You -- because you let her go. You're the good guy. Not Brad, never Brad. Don't you care what happens to her?",
        "Jack: Of course, I care what happens to her. What are you talking about? I'll always care what happens to Katie, but don't you think she's put her life on hold long enough?",
        "Margo: Well good, then why don't you call her and talk to her. And talk her out of this.",
        "Jack: No, 'cause it's not my place. I'm not interfering in Katie's life anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: So Jack and Katie got married? I never would've seen that coming. Must have gone over real big with you.",
        "Carly: Yeah, not so much. Sharing custody of my children with Katie is not something I was looking forward to.",
        "Mike: And now she's hooked up with Brad?",
        "Carly: She seems to have a thing for all my ex's.",
        "Mike: Do you think it's serious?",
        "Carly: I -- with Katie, who knows. Brad thinks he's in love. He's head over heels, even wants to settle down. So Mike, if you're thinking of throwing your hat into the ring, you'd better do it now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Alison and I are friends, co-workers, that's it. Maybe you should spend more time worrying about Emily.",
        "Susan: Stay away from Alison.",
        "Chris: Stay out of my private life, Susan. From now on, let's keep our discussions professional. Are we clear?",
        "Susan: Oh yes, Dr. Hughes, perfectly clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know what I'm saying about Chris is true.",
        "Alison: Chris left you because of your feelings for Dusty.",
        "Emily: Are you sure about that? Chris is a Hughes. Stewart women are always second best. Just ask Mom.",
        "Alison: Your own son is a Hughes.",
        "Emily: Yeah, exactly. And who's in charge of him? Tom Hughes.",
        "Alison: Why do you want to hurt me like this? I haven't done anything wrong.",
        "Emily: I'm not trying to hurt you. Look, I am trying to protect you. Once he finds out about your past, he's going to dump you, too.",
        "Alison: You'd like that, wouldn't you?",
        "Emily: Honey, I just don't want you to end up like me.",
        "Alison: Don't worry, I won't.",
        "Emily: Alison, just stop. Just, please think about what I've said.",
        "Alison: You've made your point.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: There's nothing I can do about Brad and Katie. It's up to her to find happiness. And if that's with my brother, I've got to accept it.",
        "Margo: You're giving up on her?",
        "Jack: Brad, I thought you were eloping.",
        "Brad: I'm here to see your boss. We need to talk, in private.",
        "Margo: Do I have a choice?",
        "Brad: No.",
        "Margo: So, what happened?",
        "Brad: You did. We were on our way to Vegas, Katie was too upset to get married without your approval.",
        "Margo: Oh good. Then she came to her senses.",
        "Brad: She has every intention of marrying me. That won't change.",
        "Margo: Brad, she's with you for all the wrong reasons.",
        "Brad: I'm a good guy. I'm loyal. I love your sister. I want to make a life with her. She'll be happy with me.",
        "Margo: You couldn't even get her to go to Vegas with you.",
        "Brad: Because of you. Now I hate to see the woman that I love upset, but if she won't get married without your approval, I am here to make sure you change your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I'm not sharing Katie with anyone. That happened with Simon once before. Never again.",
        "Carly: Katie's confused. Not that I feel bad for her. She definitely brought this on herself, but she's clearly on the rebound.",
        "Mike: Because of me.",
        "Carly: You, Jack, Simon, it's a long list.",
        "Mike: What's the old saying -- timing is everything?",
        "Carly: Exactly. So if you want Katie back, I think you have a chance, you just need to take it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You are -- are not getting anywhere with me.",
        "Brad: Why are you being so judgmental?",
        "Margo: Oh --",
        "Brad: I mean, you claim to love Katie, but you're hurting her.",
        "Margo: And preventing you from getting what you want.",
        "Brad: She is what I want, I am what she wants.",
        "Margo: Considering your track record --",
        "Brad: Track record? What track record? Spending the last year pining after her, chasing after her, waiting for her to see that I'm the right man for her? You're wrong about me, you know.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. Oh yeah? Well, prove it.",
        "Brad: All right. I never betrayed her the way Jack did with Carly. I bought her a house, I was willing to father her children. I was there for her when we were really going through really rough times. And I am not going to give her up because you think that I'm not good enough for her.",
        "Margo: Okay, there -- there. You're not good enough for my sister. And if by not giving my blessing, it keeps Katie from marrying you, then I'm going to stand by that.",
        "Brad: Katie loves me.",
        "Margo: Oh, Katie doesn't know what she feels right now.",
        "Brad: Hear her out. Don't boss her around or yell at her, tell her what to do or anything. Just listen to her, and then you can decide if your preconceived notions of what's best, what's right for Katie, is on the mark or not. I have always put her first. Maybe you should do the same. She's at the Lakeview if you come to your senses.",
        "Margo: Jack, I'm leaving, I'll be back.",
        "Brad: Do you want to know something?",
        "Jack: No, Brad, I don't think I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I'm going to head out.",
        "Carly: So what are you going to do?",
        "Mike: Think about it, that's all. I've hurt Katie enough, I don't want to do it again.",
        "Carly: She cheated on you.",
        "Mike: We've all had our moments, haven't we?",
        "Carly: Well, I don't care who Katie's with, as long as she's not with Jack.",
        "Mike: Just do me a favor, don't say anything about me being in town until I have a chance to figure out what my next move is.",
        "Carly: You got it.",
        "Mike: I'll see you later.",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: What can I get you?",
        "Katie: Tonic, please.",
        "Bartender: You want a little gin with that?",
        "Katie: No, thanks. I've got to stay sober. My entire life hangs on what I decide to do next.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Chris.",
        "Chris: How'd it go with Emily?",
        "Alison: Not great. Do you have a minute?",
        "Chris: I just finished rounds, could use a break.",
        "Alison: I -- I have something for you.",
        "Chris: A present?",
        "Alison: Not quite. Emily mentioned that you dumped her because she was a prostitute.",
        "Chris: Actually, it was because she lied about that and having sex with dusty.",
        "Alison: Well, either way, before we go any further as friends or whatever, I think you need to know everything about me. Open it.",
        "[Chris opens the bag it's a DVD of a porn movie Alison starred in]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey, hi.",
        "Susan: Hey. How did it go with Alison?",
        "Emily: Not well.",
        "Susan: Oh, she didn't come around?",
        "Emily: The opposite. Alison is determined to do whatever she wants despite the consequences.",
        "Susan: I just had a talk with Chris, that didn't go much better. He told me to mind my own business. Maybe we should just both back off.",
        "Emily: Maybe not.",
        "Susan: Emily, what have you done now?",
        "Emily: Nothing. But I have a funny feeling things will resolve themselves.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You did porn?",
        "Alison: It was a -- not a good time in my life. It was degrading and humiliating and, unfortunately, it's caught on video forever.",
        "Chris: Why?",
        "Alison: I was addicted to crystal meth and it fed my habit. Dusty and Emily saved me, got me off drugs. So now that you know all about me, do you still want to be friends?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Brad said I could find you here.",
        "Katie: Have you prepared another lecture? Should I take notes?",
        "Margo: Brad said that you could probably convince me that he's the man for you -- and then I would give my blessings.",
        "Katie: Is that even possible?",
        "Margo: I don't know. But I am going to keep my mouth shut and listen. And I don't lecture. I'm going to listen to what you say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Stop that. Stop. Stop it. What are you doing?",
        "Brad: Giving Margo time with Katie. They need to have a heart-to-heart.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Brad: I know you don't want to hear this, but Katie is the most important thing to me. Marrying her is all I want, but if the rest of the family doesn't go along, I don't think she'll go through with it.",
        "Jack: Okay, let's -- maybe Margo's right, maybe what you need is time. Maybe you're rushing into this. A nice, long engagement would be nice.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you would like that, wouldn't you?",
        "Jack: I just want Katie to be happy, Brad.",
        "Brad: I'm your brother, Man. Why don't you be happy for me? I know it's a long shot. You know, I didn't hook up with Katie to hurt you.",
        "Jack: I never said you did.",
        "Brad: I am the best chance of Katie having it all, and I will do whatever it takes to make sure she is happy every single day of her life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: May I have Katie Peretti's room number?",
        "Clerk: Sorry, I can't give out that information.",
        "Mike: Right.",
        "Clerk: But I can dial her room number and you can speak on the house phone.",
        "Mike: Sure, thanks. I guess she's not there.",
        "Clerk: Would you like to leave a message?",
        "Mike: No, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Brad is the one person who always makes me smile. He just makes the sadness go away, the sadness that I felt when Mike left, and then Jack. Brad promised he would never hurt me like that, and I believe him.",
        "Margo: But didn't you feel the same way about Jack?",
        "Katie: Yeah, well that's the funny thing -- I've realized that Brad was never the rebound guy, Jack was.",
        "Margo: Yeah, but Brad is -- he's wild and he's unreliable --",
        "Katie: And unexpected. I know. Just like me. We're both crazy and unpredictable, but still strong and solid. And he wants a family. We really do have a real chance to grow up and grow old together.",
        "Margo: Good. Then, there's no reason to rush into this.",
        "Katie: But Brad's been waiting for me for so long. He loves me and that means so much.",
        "Margo: Do you love him?",
        "Katie: Brad is what I need. It may have taken me a long time to actually admit it, but I do, I love him. I love Brad.",
        "Margo: You know, I just always want to be here to catch you, little sister. Because you are always leaping from man to man to man --",
        "Katie: Don't -- please. I know, I know. But Brad is it. He really is it. The one and only. Oh, it feels good to finally say it out loud. I've been holding it in for so long.",
        "Margo: All right, all right. So now, you are determined that you want to build a life with this man?",
        "Katie: I am and it would mean so much if you were happy for me.",
        "Margo: I always want to be happy for you. So, if he is who you want and if you believe in him, then you should go and build a life with him.",
        "Katie: Really? You mean it?",
        "Margo: He may not be the one I expected you to be with, nor the one I wanted you to be with, but you officially have my blessings.",
        "Katie: Thank you, thank you so much. You have no idea what that means to me.",
        "Margo: Oh, and to make up for all the grief I put you through, I'm going to throw you an engagement party.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I'm on duty tonight, how about tomorrow? Want to hang out?",
        "Alison: You still want to see me? Are you kidding? Why?",
        "Chris: Because I like you, I know you, I almost married you. And I'd like to get to know you again.",
        "Alison: But what about my past? Emily said if I told you, you'd never be able to deal with it.",
        "Chris: You told me the truth up front. Emily didn't. I've done things in my past I regret. I judged Emily because she lied to me. Emily's not honest, you are.",
        "Alison: Thanks for that, I don't hear it very often.",
        "Chris: So what do you want to do first? Rock climbing or the batting cages?",
        "Alison: Mom told me you'd be working late.",
        "Emily: What do you want, Ali?",
        "Alison: I told Chris everything.",
        "Emily: Oh, Baby. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to be so harsh with you, I just -- you needed to face reality.",
        "Alison: Chris is fine with it.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Alison: I told him about the porn, the meth, everything. He said everyone has things in their past they're not proud of. And we're going out again tomorrow.",
        "Emily: I don't get it. How did you manage to get a free pass and I got dumped?",
        "Alison: I don't know and I don't care. But do me a favor, and stay the hell out of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You were gone awhile.",
        "Jack: I just had to hold the fort down until Dallas came back.",
        "Carly: Is everything all right?",
        "Jack: I'm a little tired. More than I expected.",
        "Carly: Why don't you put your feet up? I'll fix you something to eat, and I think it's time for your pain medicine.",
        "Jack: Carly, you're fussing. Please don't.",
        "Carly: I can't help it.",
        "Jack: Actually, I think I'm going to turn in early. Goodnight.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay, so I will call you with the details about the party.",
        "Katie: Thank you so much. You are not going to regret this.",
        "Margo: Well, I better not, right? And you, Brad Snyder, you better stick to your word. If I hear that you hurt my sister, I will hunt you down.",
        "Brad: I -- I promise. She's going to be the happiest woman around. No one will have any regrets.",
        "Margo: Okay.",
