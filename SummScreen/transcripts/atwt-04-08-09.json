        "Brad and Katie cater to Vienna's every whim, as Henry at times feels left out. Kim arrives to talk about their show and learns the news about how Vienna is carrying Brad and Katie's baby; she thinks this would make a great curve ball to the original show. Everyone is onboard but Henry. He is finally coaxed into it, but flakes at the last minute leaving Brad and Katie to wonder why. Kim is interviewing Vienna, Brad and Katie about the baby, as Henry quietly watches close by. He has a strong reaction to some things Kim says about the baby and causes a commotion. Henry is forced to join the interview, but he takes off again. Brad tries to get him to tell him what is going on after he puts in his two cents worth, and it looks like Henry might, but Vienna comes to talk with him. Vienna wonders if Henry has changed his mind about having the baby, but he tells her that he hasn't, but he again can't get out of the interview fast enough. After they get home, Katie wonders what is eating Henry. Brad thinks he might be feeling inadequate, as Katie assures him that is not it, but they both put off their concerns and hope Henry comes around. Vienna confronts Henry about his feelings and though he hesitates, he tells her again he is not having second thoughts \u0096 even though he clearly is wrestling with something. An irate Vienna reminds him that Brad and Katie want this baby, so he needs to be a man and learn to deal with this. Carly finds Parker sulking and not wanting to go to school again. She offers him some advice, which Parker doesn't appreciate. Carly and Craig talk about how Liberty and Parker still haven't spoken, but Carly is bothered about how upset Parker is. Craig talks with Parker about how he reacted to Liberty's feelings and suggested that he wasn't being fair. Janet and Jack are happy Liberty went to school today and there are no more dramas for the time being. However, Liberty comes home soon and tells them Parker was a no show at school. Jack and Janet use this time to convince her to rethink the marriage at least until they are older. Although Liberty loves Parker, she thinks they might be right. Liberty comes to see Parker, who apologizes and begs her forgiveness. He was not being fair and he wants her to do whatever she wants in the future. Liberty looks unsure but accepts his apology, as they agree to respect the other's decisions and stand by them. Carly and Craig are told of Parker and Liberty's newfound united front. Carly is secretly unhappy, as Craig formulates a new plan. He tells Liberty he can get her into an internship at a Fashion Magazine in NY. Liberty is thrilled and Parker is frustrated. Craig makes some calls, it looks promising, and he goes to talk with Janet for Liberty. Parker doesn't react well, as Liberty tries to talk with him and Carly suggests that he not hold her back because they will resent one another if he does. Parker gives in and decides he is going with her, much to Carly's chagrin. Parker explains that Craig should have no problem giving him money for the summer since this was his idea. Craig talks with Jack and Janet, who are nervously waiting, thinking Liberty is breaking up with Parker. Janet is thrown by the news and is furious with Craig for suggesting NY. Jack and Craig are able to convince her this may be their only option, so she begrudgingly agrees. Craig comes back with his good news only to hear of Parker's plan. Craig gets a call from the Fashion Magazine for an interview tomorrow for Liberty, as Parker doesn't want her to go. He explains he has baseball tryouts, as Craig thwarts his attempt to join Liberty in NY by saying he and Carly have business there and they will take her while he stays there and goes to baseball tryouts. Parker finally agrees and sadly goes to help Liberty pack. Carly is impressed with Craig's help and they are happy so far, as Craig suggests they toast to their plan with some of their Vodka. Janet is unhappy and takes it out on Jack thinking he is living a double standard. Jack tries to explain his thoughts on Liberty's adventure to NY, but Janet is still heartbroken that Liberty will be so far away from her family and support system for the summer."

        "Brad: Katie, you see my gym bag?",
        "Katie: Shh! Wait. Brad, keep your voice down. Henry and Vienna are still asleep.",
        "Brad: Are you kidding? It's noon.",
        "Katie: They're taking it easy today. Thought I'd bring them brunch in bed. Oh, where is the little rose I had?",
        "Brad: I mean, I think it's great that Henry and Vienna moved in with us, but don't you think we're taking the \"Pamper the pregnant woman\" routine just a little too far?",
        "Katie: No, not at all. Vienna needs her proper rest. She needs lots of nutrition, vitamins -- O.J. vitamins, O.J. We want our baby to be born healthy and strong, don't we?",
        "Brad: Yeah! Yeah, sure, I do. Yeah. I mean, I -- I think they're great. I love them. You know that. It's just I don't see why we had to give them our bed. I mean, Liberty's bed is so tight, and my shoulder is -- it's like -- ow!",
        "Katie: Aww! I'm sorry. Poor baby!",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Brad: It's really bad!",
        "Katie: Come here.",
        "Vienna: Good morning! Isn't it a beautiful day?!",
        "Henry: Not until I get some coffee.",
        "Katie: You guys weren't supposed to come out. I was gonna surprise you with brunch in bed.",
        "Vienna: Oh, that's so sweet! Aren't we lucky, Henry?",
        "Henry: Where is the coffee?",
        "Katie: Vienna can't have caffeine. But I made all of your favorites, including that Swiss muesli that you love.",
        "Vienna: Oh! Ooh, it looks delicious! Oh, this is wonderful. We're like a little, cozy family.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Mama Bear, Papa Bear, Yogi, Boo Boo. And now, just be forewarned, Papa Bear gets a little cranky when he's hungry.",
        "Katie: Hey, Brad, can you bring me those cinnamon buns? Oh, and I have organic milk for your muesli. You just say when.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Carly: Hey. What's going on?",
        "Parker: I still feel sick, so I'm not going to school today.",
        "Carly: I'm not here to lecture you, Parker. But your dad's right, you know? If you miss too much, you're gonna have a lot to make up when you go back.",
        "Parker: I'll handle it, okay?",
        "Carly: Hey. I know you're hurting. I came here to see if there's anything I can do to help.",
        "Parker: Unless you can get Liberty to move back in, then I doubt it. Because of your boyfriend, my wife's not talking to me.",
        "Carly: Oh, now, don't blame Craig for that. That's what married couples do, you know? They fight. And if you're meant to be together, you'll work it out. If you're not meant to be together, you won't work it out. You'll just accept that and move on.",
        "Parker: Thanks for sharing.",

        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Coming!",
        "Craig: Good morning, beautiful!",
        "Carly: It's afternoon, Craig, and there's not much good about it.",
        "Craig: Wow. Who spiked your coffee?",
        "Carly: We're having sort of a rough day around here. Liberty hasn't come back. Parker's upset. They haven't spoken since she left.",
        "Craig: Oh. Too bad for Parker, but I should think that would make you happy.",
        "Carly: Happy? It's hard to be happy when my child is so depressed, he can't even get out of bed.",
        "Craig: I'll go talk to him.",
        "Carly: No, no. Don't bother. Parker has moved on from blaming Jack for everything bad in his life to blaming you.",
        "Craig: Let me fix this. I know exactly what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Would you like some more O.J., Vienna?",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Katie: Kim, hi! How are you?",
        "Kim: Okay, good!",
        "Katie: Good. You're just in time for brunch. Come on in.",
        "Kim: Sorry, I'm interrupting.",
        "Brad: No, not at all. Would you like -- the cinnamon buns are delicious.",
        "Henry: Are they? I wouldn't know.",
        "Kim: Are you having a sleepover?",
        "Katie: Well, sort of. Henry and Vienna are living with us temporarily.",
        "Brad: Until the baby comes.",
        "[Kim gasps]",
        "Kim: You're having a baby? Oh, my gosh, that's wonderful!",
        "Katie: Yes, it is.",
        "Kim: Oh, my golly. Oh. Well, that certainly puts a new light on the documentary we're making about you trying to have a baby. When were you planning on telling me?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Kim. I'm so sorry we kept you out of the loop. We did have to change plans.",
        "Brad: We had a little setback.",
        "Katie: But the good news is, our best friend, Vienna, volunteered to have our baby for us. Isn't that sweet?",
        "Kim: Oh, my gosh! Oh, my goodness. Vienna's having your baby.",
        "Katie: Well, we used Vienna's egg, but Brad's the biological father.",
        "Kim: Oh.",
        "Brad: Strictly A.I.",
        "Katie: Artificial insemination. That's why Henry and Vienna are staying with us right now. We -- Brad and I want to be hands-on during the whole pregnancy, so I guess we're not gonna be able to finish that documentary after all.",
        "Kim: Are you kidding? This is a much better story. I mean, wouldn't you like to all make a documentary about the four of you having this baby together?",
        "Brad: Yeah, why not?",
        "Vienna: Absolutely.",
        "Henry: No way!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: We sure made the most of this morning, didn't we?",
        "Jack: We sure did. I love you.",
        "Janet: I love you.",
        "[Chuckles]",
        "Janet: Wait a minute. Peace and quiet. Oh, it's so nice not to have to deal with Liberty and Parker's drama.",
        "Jack: Liberty seemed to be happy to go to school today. Wish I could only say the same for Parker.",
        "Janet: I just want them to be normal kids and do what normal kids do, right?",
        "Jack: Me too. In the meantime, why don't we do what normal adults do?",
        "Janet: Okay. Mm! Oh -- spoke too soon. Spoke too soon. Here she comes hi.",
        "Liberty: Hey. Hi.",
        "Janet: What are you doing home so early?",
        "Liberty: My last class was study period, so blew it off. Parker wasn't in school today.",
        "Jack: I heard. He called in sick again.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, he wasn't sick. He's mad at me for not coming home. What am I supposed to do?",
        "[Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I know you think I betrayed you, but all I did was have a talk with your wife about her future.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, you put some pretty dumb ideas in her head.",
        "Craig: You made her think her dreams don't matter.",
        "Parker: That's not true. I just don't think that she should be making decisions without me. I mean, I'm her husband.",
        "Craig: Parker, the secret to a good marriage is allowing your wife to have the same freedoms that you'd like for yourself. I mean, you don't like anyone telling you what to do, right? You need to let Liberty make her own choices and then support them. It's the only way you both are gonna be happy.",
        "Carly: How'd it go?",
        "Craig: Well, I gave Parker all my best advice on how to make a woman happy.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: And you're the expert.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: Hardly. But if I knew then what I know now, things might have been different for us. In fact, if you give me the chance, I'll be happy to show you some of the lessons I've learned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Honey, you have to be honest with yourself. What do you really want?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. I love him so much, and I -- I really don't want to hurt him. But this marriage thing, it's really taken over our lives.",
        "Janet: Honey, if you don't want to be married, you have to get out of it.",
        "Liberty: How am I supposed to do that?",
        "Jack: Listen, I know I've been rough on Parker lately, but he's still my son, and I only want what's best for the two of you.",
        "Janet: Me too. I feel the same way.",
        "Jack: Right. Ending this marriage -- it may hurt, but I guarantee you it will be the best thing, not only for you, but for Parker.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but guys, if I told Parker that I didn't want to be his wife anymore --",
        "Jack: Yes, it'll hurt.",
        "Liberty: No, it would kill him.",
        "Jack: Right, it might, at first, but he'll get over it. So will you.",
        "Liberty: God. I did not think being married would make me feel so, like --",
        "Janet: Trapped.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, yeah. I just -- I'm so used to having more freedom.",
        "Janet: Of course! That's the way it should be! Your future should have no limits! And no matter how much you love Parker, you cannot let him tell you how to live your life.",
        "Jack: Your mother's right. If you get separated now, you may be able to get an annulment. It'll be like the whole thing never happened.",
        "Janet: Yeah, and then you guys can go back to being kids, and you can finish high school, and you can go to college! And then later on, when you guys are adults, if you still feel like you want to be married and start a family, nobody's gonna stop you.",
        "Liberty: No, I totally see what you're saying. But I just -- I don't think there's any way that I can get Parker to see that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, you think you're very clever, don't you, using Parker's misery to your advantage?",
        "Craig: That's not what I'm trying to do.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. You want to show me how much you've changed, because you think it's your ticket to getting more involved in our lives. Isn't that where this is headed?",
        "Craig: I just want what's best for Parker. That's all.",
        "Carly: With a little bonus for yourself on the side.",
        "Craig: I just don't like to see you or your son hurting.",
        "Carly: Let's just not make this about us, okay? Can we concentrate on Parker?",
        "Craig: Of course.",
        "Carly: Thank you. And thank you for whatever advice you gave him. Let's hope he'll use it in his next serious relationship, when he's 26 instead of 16.",
        "Craig: Well, at least it's easier to get over a broken heart at this age.",
        "Carly: I don't know. It's never really easy though, is it? If -- if Parker and Liberty split up, I'm sure it's for the best, but I hate that she just ran out on him like that and left him.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Liberty: Hi. Hey, um, I'm sorry to bother you, but I really need to see Parker.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, he -- he's in his room. You can go on up.",
        "Liberty: Oh. Thanks.",
        "Carly: That can't be good.",
        "Craig: Be careful what you wish for.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Parker: Liberty! You came back!",
        "Liberty: Hey. Hey, Parker.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Liberty: Um, I -- I really wanted to talk to you about something.",
        "Parker: Yeah, me too. Look, Liberty, I am really sorry. I acted like a complete jerk, and you have every right in the world to be mad at me.",
        "Liberty: No, it's okay. I'm not mad. Parker, I -- I've -- I've just been thinking a lot about my future, and --",
        "Parker: Yeah, and I'm sorry I acted so weird when you brought up college. From now on, whatever you want to do is fine with me.",
        "Liberty: Really?",
        "Parker: Yeah. I -- I don't know why, but I felt like you were looking for excuses to do stuff by yourself.",
        "Liberty: No, it -- it wasn't about you. It was --",
        "Parker: Right, right. I know that. I know that now, and I know that I need to let you do your thing while we're married.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. The same goes for you, too.",
        "Parker: As long as we're together, we can do whatever we want.",
        "Liberty: I guess. Yeah.",
        "Parker: Liberty, I love you. I want you to be happy. Just please stay with me.",
        "Liberty: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I still don't think this is a good idea.",
        "Katie: Why not, Henry?",
        "Henry: Because making a film -- it's very difficult. We have to think about Vienna.",
        "Vienna: I'm fine! I want to do this! And think about the publicity you can get for your book.",
        "Katie: Ooh, yes. Absolutely. We can totally talk about \"The Man from Oakdale,\" if that's okay with you.",
        "Kim: Of course. I thought it was a terrific book. I couldn't put it down. I mean it, Henry. It kept me up all night long.",
        "Henry: Thanks. You really liked it?",
        "Kim: Oh, Henry, you -- you have a wonderful way with words. Which is a reason that you would be such a great addition to our documentary.",
        "Henry: Well, no, that's -- that's very nice of you to say. But -- look, the book is one thing, but what's happening with Vienna and I -- and Brad and Katie, of course -- it's -- it's very personal. I don't know if I want to share that with the world.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but we have no secrets, Henry!",
        "Henry: I don't know about that.",
        "Brad: I had something to do with making this baby, too, remember?",
        "Henry: Yeah. I don't know about that, either.",
        "Katie: What are you saying, Henry?",
        "Henry: I am saying that I don't think Vienna understands what an invasion of privacy this is gonna be, and that kind of pressure is bad for the baby.",
        "Vienna: No, I don't think there's anything to be worried about. And I -- I'm perfectly happy doing this documentary. And if I'm happy, the baby's happy, too.",
        "Katie: Good. Then it's settled.",
        "Brad: One more thing, all right? Does our original deal still, you know, hold? I mean, if I do this documentary, will you give me my old job back on \"Oakdale Now\"?",
        "Kim: That was the deal, and I will stick to it.",
        "Katie: Fantastic. So it's win-win for everyone.",
        "Henry: Almost everyone.",
        "Kim: All right. You know what I'm gonna do? I'll go back to the studio. I'll get everything set up. When you are all ready, come meet me there, and we'll shoot our first segment. How about it?",
        "Katie: Perfect.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Katie: We'll see you there.",
        "Kim: See you soon.",
        "Katie: I want to freshen up, and you should change your shirt.",
        "Brad: Oh, after you.",
        "Henry: I still don't think this is a good idea!",
        "Vienna: Why not?",
        "Henry: Why? For a million reasons. It's a lie, first of all. That's not Brad's baby inside of you. It's mine.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not! I'm still carrying this baby for Brad and Katie, and it's theirs in every way that counts!",
        "Henry: You say that now. Later on --",
        "Vienna: You specifically said you don't want a baby. Have you changed your mind, Henry?",
        "Henry: No! But --",
        "Vienna: But what? But what? Is there something I should know about?",
        "Henry: No, no, not -- I just don't like this.",
        "Brad: Are you guys ready?",
        "Henry: Uh, Vienna is. I -- I'm not going.",
        "Katie: Are you serious?",
        "Vienna: Yes, he is. He's serious. But we can do this without him, okay? Come on, guys.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Carly: So -- how's it going?",
        "Parker: Liberty and I decided to work things out.",
        "Carly: You did?",
        "Craig: Well, don't keep us in suspense.",
        "Parker: Well, she's gonna move back in, and we're gonna live here until we're old enough to get our own place.",
        "Carly: Really?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but don't worry, 'cause -- we're going back to school.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's good, but, uh, what about college?",
        "Parker: Well, she can go to whatever college that she wants. And we've decided that we're gonna respect each other's decisions, and we're definitely staying together.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I'm starving. And hey, just 'cause I'm the wife, does that mean I have to do all the cooking?",
        "Parker: Well, I figure the least I can do is fix you a snack.",
        "Liberty: Oh! That's so sweet. Being married isn't so bad.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Carly: Oh --",
        "[Mumbling]",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Oh, you know, you -- you say that you're gonna fix things, but somehow, they always get worse.",
        "Craig: You know, I can't tell you how happy I am that you two have worked things out. I guess that means Liberty won't have to give up on her dreams, huh?",
        "Parker: Right. She can go to college and become whatever she wants.",
        "Craig: It's, uh, fashion editor, if I recall correctly.",
        "Liberty: Yeah! That would be my dream job. But, you know, I might not make it that far.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, never sell yourself short. You know, Carly and I are going to have to do an awful lot of advertising in \"Fashionista Weekly.\"",
        "Liberty: Oh. They, like, do the best fashion covers ever.",
        "Craig: Everything from hip-hop sneakers to haute couture.",
        "Liberty: Oh, it'd be so awesome to work there one day.",
        "Craig: Why someday? I hear they have a very interesting intern program. I have a friend who works there. Why don't I give them a call, see if I can connect you with a summer job?",
        "Liberty: Craig, that would be so awesome!",
        "Parker: Wait a minute. Wouldn't you have to go to New York for that?",
        "Craig: Of course she would. Center of the fashion universe. Let me see if I can get him on the phone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Come on, Honey. It's your day off. Don't you ever take a break?",
        "Janet: No. I'm too nervous to sit. What's taking her so long?",
        "Jack: Honey, it's only been an hour.",
        "Janet: I don't care. Honey, you know what this means, don't you? This means Parker freaked out.",
        "Jack: Well, you don't know that.",
        "Janet: I feel bad for the poor kid. As much as I don't want them to be married anymore, I don't want his heart broken, either.",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what? I'll -- I'll take him up to the lake, and we'll go fishing, just the two of us.",
        "Janet: Good idea. Good idea. Get his mind off of things, right?",
        "Jack: He always loved to fish. Not sure how he's gonna feel about hanging out with his old man.",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, he'll love hanging out with his really old man.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Janet: I'll make a picnic for you. It'll be great!",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah.",
        "Janet: That's it. I'm calling her. I'm calling her cell.",
        "Jack: Okay, would you relax? Everything's gonna be fine. Everything is gonna be just fine, I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: We all set? Okay, roll it when you're ready. For some time now, we've all been following Katie and Brad's progress on the journey towards having a baby.",
        "Katie: A long, bumpy journey.",
        "Kim: Unfortunately, you've had some twists and turns, I know.",
        "Katie: But we haven't given up.",
        "Brad: And we're lucky to be getting help from a friend.",
        "Katie: Our dear friend, Vienna Hyatt, our surrogate mother.",
        "Vienna: Hello, everybody.",
        "Kim: Well, now, having a surrogate mother is quite common, but I think it's rare to have it happening this way. Do you want to explain how this all came about?",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sure our audience remembers how devastated I was when I found out that I couldn't have children.",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, we thought about hiring a surrogate, but that would be someone that we didn't know. And then Vienna just, well, sort of volunteered.",
        "Vienna: Yes, well, I always wanted to experience having a baby, and so this is something I wanted to do for my friends.",
        "Katie: That generosity does not happen every day.",
        "Kim: No. Agreed. Uh, so, how did it all work?",
        "Brad: Well, we're using Vienna's egg, and I donated my -- my --",
        "Katie: Sperm. It's okay, Brad. You can say it.",
        "Brad: Yeah. So -- so medically and biologically, I am the father. You name it.",
        "Vienna: I'm -- I'm only the mother until the baby's born. That's -- that's the agreement.",
        "Kim: I see. And Katie, does it bother you, not having that biological connection?",
        "Katie: Um, it's different. But I love the baby already, and Brad is the father, so as far as I'm concerned, that makes me a mom.",
        "Brad: And I think it's gonna be nice to have a little Brad or Bradlina.",
        "[Kim laughs]",
        "Katie: We're still picking out names.",
        "Brad: I think Bradlina's very --",
        "Katie: Bradley, no, no.",
        "Brad: It's very feminine.",
        "Katie: I don't think so. I just want to say though that this is all because of Vienna. We wouldn't be able to take this journey without her.",
        "Kim: And Vienna, have you given a lot of thought to the day that you're gonna have to give that baby away? Even thought how you're gonna feel about that?",
        "Vienna: You know, I am -- I'm totally at peace with this, because this is not my child. This is Katie and Brad's baby.",
        "Kim: Excuse me. I should explain that Vienna's partner is Henry Coleman. He is the author of the new book \"The Man from Oakdale.\" So, Vienna, how does Henry feel about this?",
        "Vienna: Oh, he's fine with it. He's on board 100%.",
        "Henry: Oh!",
        "Katie: Oh!",
        "[Henry chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, thank you, Randy. I really appreciate it. Okay, we'll talk soon.",
        "Carly: Well, that sounded positive.",
        "Liberty: What did they say?",
        "Craig: They're hiring summer interns right now. And with my recommendation, you have a very good shot at getting it.",
        "Liberty: Thank you so much! This is so exciting!",
        "Parker: Yeah, but, you know, you would have to go to New York for this.",
        "Liberty: Well, I don't know! I mean, I have to talk to my mom. She might be not too wild about it.",
        "Craig: I tell you what. Let me try and pitch it to your mom to help her understand that this could be a great opportunity for you.",
        "Liberty: You don't mind?",
        "Craig: Not at all.",
        "Liberty: Thank you so much, Craig. This really is like one of the most exciting days of my life.",
        "Craig: Okay, well --",
        "Carly: Yes. Craig, good luck.",
        "Craig: What'd I say? I don't want to fight.",
        "Liberty: You know, I wonder what my mom is gonna say about this.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm sure she'll love the idea. Like Craig said, it's an amazing opportunity.",
        "Liberty: I know.",
        "Parker: But New York is really far away. Are you sure you don't want to get an intern job that's a little bit closer to here?",
        "Carly: Oh, Parker, no. If Liberty wants to be in the fashion business, she's got to go to New York.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Carly: Or Paris or Milan maybe even.",
        "Parker: Thanks, Mom. You're such a great help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What do you want, Craig?",
        "Craig: Hello, Jack. Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Janet: Hey.",
        "Craig: I've just come from Carly's.",
        "Janet: Really? Did you see Liberty? How is she?",
        "Jack: Yeah. What about Parker? How's he doing?",
        "Craig: Why do you ask?",
        "Janet: Well, Liberty had sort of a -- a moment. She realized that she didn't want to be married to Parker, and so she was on her way over to tell him.",
        "Craig: Oh. Well, that's news to me. I mean, to look at them, they seemed closer than ever.",
        "Janet: Maybe she didn't get up the nerve to tell him yet.",
        "Craig: I don't think she intends to. The kids made it pretty clear that they want to stay together. Liberty said she'd even more back to Carly's.",
        "Janet: This isn't happening.",
        "Craig: I know. It's very upsetting. But I may have some good news.",
        "Jack: What are you up to now, Craig?",
        "Craig: By this summer, all your problems should be solved.",
        "Jack: And how's that?",
        "Craig: Because I've gotten Liberty a summer internship in New York.",
        "Janet: What? Your idea of solving my problem is sending my kid a thousand miles away? Oh, hell no! Over my dead body. Where the hell do you get off, Craig Montgomery? She is my daughter, and she is 17, and there is no way in hell you are gonna send her off to New York by herself! Because unless you're footing the bill, I'm not going with her!",
        "Craig: Well, she wouldn't be left to her own devices. I can promise you that. \"Fashionista Weekly\" has a top-rated internship program. They take promising students from all over the country, house them together in a supervised apartment, and drive them to and from work in a minivan. They even organize outings to theater, museums, and fashion shows. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You know how much Liberty loves fashion. This is the kind of job she's always dreamed of.",
        "Janet: She's just a teenager, Craig.",
        "Craig: That's true, but it also beats playing desperate housewife before she's out of high school.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen, I hate to admit this, but Craig may be right. This -- this -- this could be a solution.",
        "Janet: No, it isn't!",
        "Jack: As long as Liberty and Parker are living together, it's gonna be impossible to break them up, and nothing else we've tried has worked.",
        "Craig: I have to say, your husband has a point.",
        "Jack: Shut up, Craig. This could be -- this could be what Liberty needs to finally get over Parker.",
        "Craig: I won't move forward with this unless you agree, Mrs. Snyder. But I have to say, your daughter is very excited about this opportunity.",
        "Janet: I don't want to be the one to break her heart. All right. I hope I don't regret this. She can go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Liberty, New York is just so far away.",
        "Liberty: Okay, what about what you said before about we should respect each other's choices?",
        "Parker: So you've already made up your mind. That's what you're saying.",
        "Liberty: Parker, it's what I've always dreamed about. How could I pass that up?",
        "Carly: Don't ruin this chance for her, Parker. You'll both be miserable.",
        "Parker: All right, well, you really want to go all the way to New York?",
        "Liberty: I really, really do.",
        "Parker: Well, not that you need my permission, but if this is something that you really want to do, then go for it.",
        "Liberty: Thank you, Parker.",
        "Parker: And since I am your husband, I'm gonna go with you.",
        "Carly: You're what?",
        "Parker: Well, it's only for the summer. We can get a cheap apartment, and I can get a job, or maybe Craig could get me an internship at a sports magazine.",
        "Carly: Wait a minute.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Carly: Wait a minute. Firstly, we don't even know if that's possible. And secondly, you're not being realistic. Even the cheapest apartment in New York City is gonna be much more than you can afford.",
        "Parker: Well, I can get some money from my trust fund. It was Craig's idea for this whole New York thing. It's the least he can do.",
        "Carly: That's not how it works.",
        "Parker: I've made up my mind. If Liberty's going, then so am I.",
        "Liberty: That's fine by me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: What are you doing here? I thought you didn't want any part of this.",
        "Henry: How can I not be when it's my -- my partner having the child, now in front of the entire viewing public.",
        "Kim: You know, Henry, we would all love to have you join us.",
        "Henry: I don't think that's such a good idea.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on, Henry. Don't be so shy.",
        "Brad: Yeah. You can talk about your book.",
        "Henry: Okay. Uh, as long as you shoot my good side. Or just shoot me.",
        "Vienna: Come on. Sit next to me.",
        "Katie: Are you okay?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. I'm peachy. The show must go on, right?",
        "Brad: Hey, so how does it feel to be back in the limelight again, you know? The spotlight, the -- you know, the cameras? I mean, when was it? Last time, you were, uh, marrying Katie and I on live TV. And a year later, you guys are pregnant with my baby.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Who knew?",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Kim: Okay. You can roll it when you want. Uh, you may have noticed we have added a friend to our conversation, Mr. Henry Coleman. Henry, thank you. We're delighted you joined us. Thanks for coming. As I mentioned earlier, Henry is the author of the new book \"The Man from Oakdale.\" And any of you who've read his book, you know that Vienna is the love of Henry's life. And so Henry, how do you feel about having your partner be a surrogate mother for your best friends?",
        "Henry: It's complicated.",
        "[Kim laughs]",
        "Kim: I bet it is. I mean, even though artificial insemination was used, your partner and your best friend made a baby together.",
        "Henry: Yeah. No, no, no, no, no.",
        "Kim: Cut, cut, cut!",
        "Henry: I, uh -- I can't do this. I, uh --",
        "Kim: Henry, what's the matter?",
        "Henry: Sorry. It's -- it's -- I have stage fright, guys. Horrible stage fright. I'm sorry. Just -- just -- just go on without me.",
        "Katie: Strange.",
        "Brad: Okay, I think I know what that's about. Let me, um -- see what I can do. Okay, we need to have a man-to-man talk.",
        "Henry: I am not in the mood.",
        "Brad: I think I know exactly what's bothering you.",
        "Henry: Really?",
        "Brad: You're a guy. I'm a guy. Katie's my wife. Vienna's your woman.",
        "Henry: Brad, let's stop with the birds and the bees. Just get to the point, okay?",
        "Brad: I got her pregnant. I got Vienna pregnant. Well, at least, you know -- I mean, my -- my sperm did.",
        "Henry: Yeah. That's what you think.",
        "Brad: And I know it may seem all very clinical, with the latex gloves and the turkey baster thingies, but still, you know, on some level, it's got to feel maybe like Vienna's cheating on you.",
        "Henry: \"Cheating\"? Is that what you think?",
        "Brad: Yes, and I think it's perfectly natural to feel weird about Vienna carrying some other guy's baby, especially when in nine months or so, that baby's gonna come out of her body looking like the spitting image of me.",
        "Henry: Brad, trust me. That is not the problem.",
        "Brad: Then what is? Well, obviously, something's bothering you that you haven't shared with us. I mean, we're all in this together. So why don't you just -- come on, Henry. Put your cards on the table.",
        "Vienna: Excuse me, Brad. Can I have a moment alone with Henry?",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. I mean, if you want -- if there's anything at any time you need to get off your chest, I really -- I'm here for you.",
        "Vienna: Were you about to tell Brad something right now?",
        "Henry: No, but I should have, because that's not Brad's in there. That is mine. And I'm -- supposed to disappear, just pretend I don't exist?",
        "Vienna: But what does it matter? You don't want it!",
        "Henry: That's not the point!",
        "Vienna: Then what is?! Please, tell me.",
        "Henry: There's nothing to tell.",
        "Vienna: Are you sure? Are you sure?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, I'm sure!",
        "Vienna: Okay, okay. Well, then, why don't you come back out and be your charming, funny, adorable self? Okay? Okay. This time is for real. Henry is ready for his close-up.",
        "Carly: Well?",
        "Liberty: What did my mom say?",
        "Craig: It's a go.",
        "Liberty: Oh, my God!",
        "Craig: Janet agreed to let Liberty intern in New York.",
        "Liberty: I really -- I can't believe this. Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Craig: It's my pleasure. Well, that's good news for Liberty, but what about you, Parker? Uh, sure you're okay with this?",
        "Parker: Yeah, sure, it's cool, 'cause I'm going with her.",
        "Craig: Uh, when -- when did you decide that?",
        "Carly: Oh, about the time he decided that since it was the trustee of his trust fund's idea to -- to start this whole New York thing that said trustee should cough up some money for a summer rental.",
        "Craig: An apartment?",
        "Parker: Right. All you have to do is release the money.",
        "Craig: Well, we'll deal with that later.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: Uh -- Craig Montgomery. Randy, thanks for getting back to me so soon.",
        "Liberty: Randy's the guy that he talked about my internship with.",
        "Craig: An interview? Uh, I don't think that's a problem. Yes, of course. When? Tomorrow. Uh, yes, yes. She'll be there. All right. Thanks again. Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Well, it looks like Liberty needs to go to New York to have her big interview tomorrow.",
        "[Liberty laughs]",
        "Parker: But she can't. It's not gonna happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Would you elaborate on how you feel you've prepared yourself emotionally for the day you have to give the baby away?",
        "Vienna: Well, Henry and I -- we've decided not to have children. But it's always been a dream of mine to experience what it would be like to feel a new life growing inside of me and giving birth. And -- and now I can do that and share it with Katie. And -- and it just seemed like the perfect compromise.",
        "Katie: You're making me cry.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry. But, you know, the best part is that I know that this baby is going to have the most wonderful parents. And also knowing that Katie and Brad will let us be part of this baby's life, it's -- it's not going to be the same as -- as being a mother, but it will certainly make me very, very happy.",
        "Kim: And Henry, I assume you feel the same way?",
        "Henry: Oh, yes. I'm -- I'm happy, too -- deliriously.",
        "Kim: Well, you know, this is an amazing story, and I just know that we're all gonna look forward to checking in on you during your adventure, and we want you to come back often.",
        "Katie: Absolutely.",
        "Brad: We'll be here.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, with -- with bells.",
        "Henry: Can I go now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Gee, Craig sure made my day.",
        "Jack: Mm. You know how I feel about him, Janet. I don't trust him or his motives. But he does seem to be the only guy to get through to our kids lately.",
        "Janet: Why is it when he interferes in your son's life, you want to throw him in the slammer? But when he interferes with my daughter's life and wants to ship her off to New York City, he's the patron saint of teenagers. Do you see a double standard here, Jack?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I thought you were cool with this, Parker. Why can't we go to New York for the interview? What's your problem with that?",
        "Parker: I don't have a problem with going to New York. It's just that we can't do it tomorrow.",
        "Liberty: Why not?!",
        "Parker: Because I have baseball tryouts. It's my chance to make varsity.",
        "Liberty: Oh. Do you think that we can go the next day?",
        "Craig: Oh, I -- I don't think so. It's a group interview, and they're choosing all the interns tomorrow.",
        "Liberty: Oh, God. So we can't reschedule?",
        "Craig: No, I'm afraid not. But you'll only be away overnight. By the way, Carly and I have to go up to New York for a sales meeting.",
        "Liberty: Wow.",
        "Carly: Yes, we do. That's right. I forgot about that meeting.",
        "Parker: Well, then, if we have to go to New York, then I just won't play baseball this year.",
        "Carly: Oh, that's crazy! Parker, you're not gonna give up the whole baseball season.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Parker, you go to the tryouts and do your thing. Liberty will go to New York, have her interview, and do her thing. That's marriage. Give and take.",
        "Parker: I guess.",
        "Craig: You'll make the baseball team, Liberty will get her summer internship, and everybody's happy.",
        "Liberty: Its one night. Parker --",
        "Parker: Whatever.",
        "Liberty: Ooh!",
        "Carly: That's great. You know, I'm sure that Sage can stay over at the Liebels'. All you have to do is check up on her, okay?",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Will you help me pack?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Liberty: Come on. Let's go.",
        "Craig: Well, everything's going according to plan. We just have to be patient.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: That was pretty wild.",
        "Katie: I think the interview went well, but what was up with Henry?",
        "Brad: I think it's obvious.",
        "Katie: Not to me.",
        "Brad: That's because you're not a guy. You know, Henry's macho pride was hurt because Vienna's carrying another man's baby. You know, he says he's cool with it, but there's this -- you know, there's this feeling, deep down.",
        "Katie: What feeling?",
        "Brad: That he couldn't cut the mustard. Look, I'm not saying it makes sense. I'm just saying that sometimes, it doesn't take much for a guy to feel inadequate.",
        "Katie: No. That doesn't sound like Henry.",
        "Brad: Why not?",
        "Katie: I was married to him, remember? He was never inadequate -- in that department.",
        "Brad: Too much information.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. Sorry. Well, listen, if you're right, we know that Vienna won't let him feel inadequate for long. So by the time the baby comes, he'll be back to his old self and probably the most doting Godfather the world has ever seen.",
        "Brad: You're right. You're right. Everything's gonna be perfect.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Why did you take off without saying good-bye?",
        "Henry: Don't ask me. Ask Mr. Martini.",
        "Vienna: If you've changed your mind about having children, now would be the time to speak up.",
        "Henry: No, I haven't changed my mind. I've told you a million times. I don't want offspring.",
        "Vienna: Well, Brad and Katie do. So why don't you just be a man and get used to this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: My -- don't you look proud of yourself.",
        "Craig: I am. You should be, too. You wanted your son back. And if this works out, that's what you'll get.",
        "Carly: Maybe. We have to see what happens.",
        "Craig: Well, in the meantime, let's toast to a learning experience that neither Parker or Liberty will ever forget.",
        "Carly: Isn't it a wee bit early?",
        "Craig: Would you stop letting your uptight ex-husband get to you? Cheers.",
        "Carly: Cheers.",

        "Jack: You're the one who's done the 180.",
        "Janet: Me?",
        "Jack: Well, you -- yeah, you. You begged me to let him talk to Parker, to let Craig handle Parker's money. You swear that he's got my son's best interests in mind, and then he does one thing for Liberty -- one little thing -- and you're like, \"Oh, hell no! Over my dead body! Oh, no!\"",
        "Janet: Stop it! Excuse me for not wanting to lose my daughter!",
        "Jack: You're not losing her. This is an opportunity -- an incredible opportunity.",
        "Janet: She is going there by herself! What if something happens to her?",
        "Jack: Nothing is gonna happen to her, Janet.",
        "Janet: How do you know?",
        "Jack: Because we'll see that it doesn't.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's easy for you to say. Your son will be home with his family. I'm the one who will be here all summer without my baby girl! And she is still my baby.",
