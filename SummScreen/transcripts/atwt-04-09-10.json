        "Noah: I don't want to get my hopes up.",
        "Luke: I know, but it's something to hold on to. Your eyes reacted to the light.",
        "Noah: Yeah, but I didn't really see anything.",
        "Luke: Well, who cares? Maybe that will happen next time.",
        "Noah: I don't know.",
        "Luke: Come on, Noah. You and Dr. Oliver said that this was a great thing, and he rarely says anything positive, so it's huge! Hey, this is exactly what you wanted. I'm so happy for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Reid: What? Order a C.T. for him. I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Why don't I take you out to dinner tonight to celebrate? Uh, nothing -- nothing like that at all. We can invite some friends -- Casey, Ali, some of your film-crew buddies.",
        "Noah: I would. Um, I can't do dinner tonight.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Noah: I have plans.",
        "Luke: You have plans? Noah, do you have a date?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I could become accustomed to being spoiled like this, Dr. Hughes.",
        "Bob: As you should, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Kim: I cannot remember the last time we had a week alone when work or family or something else didn't come in and distract us from one another.",
        "Bob: It was a great second honeymoon.",
        "Kim: Oh.",
        "Bob: I'm, uh, looking forward to the third.",
        "[Kim laughs]",
        "Kim: Let's not wait another 25 years.",
        "Bob: Well, we don't have to do that. I think we should go on a never-ending honeymoon.",
        "Kim: Hmm. Now you're talking.",
        "[Pager beeps]",
        "Kim: Well, it was lovely while it lasted.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith, if we're gonna get to the cabin before dark, we need to leave now.",
        "Faith: You're really serious about this?",
        "Lily: Yes, I am. So go. Pack your bag. [Lily sighs] Holden, I -- I appreciate you offering to come with us, but you don't have to. I -- I think that Faith and I need some time alone.",
        "Holden: In truth, I -- I think that you can't handle her alone. You know, when she gets cornered, she acts out. She takes off.",
        "Lily: I am well aware of that.",
        "Holden: I think it would be better for the two of us to be there. This way, she can't pull any of her usual tricks.",
        "Lily: Can you believe it's come to this, that we have to stage an intervention to get her to see how much we love her, that -- that we're on her side no matter what?",
        "Holden: She's just angry. It will pass.",
        "Lily: I don't remember her when she wasn't. I don't know who she is anymore. You don't have to do this.",
        "Holden: She's our kid. We need to do this together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Oh, that smells so good. Hmm, what is it, cookies or pie crust?",
        "Emma: Well, it's both.",
        "Molly: Ah. Of course it is. You really put the rest of us to shame. You know that, right?",
        "Emma: Oh, well, I can't help it.",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "Emma: If you want a nice cookie fresh from the oven, it will be out in a half- hour.",
        "Molly: Ooh. Rain check.",
        "Emma: Well, good thing you have that little coat. Otherwise you might be a bit chilly.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Molly: Holden said that he was taking us someplace special tonight, so I went, and I picked up this new dress and then -- what? Is this TMI for my boyfriend's mother?",
        "Emma: TMI?",
        "Molly: Never mind.",
        "Emma: Well, when did you last, uh, speak to Holden?",
        "Molly: Well, just a little while ago when he told me he was taking me out tonight. Why do you have that look on your face?",
        "Emma: Well, he -- he just called me a little while before you came in and asked me if I would pick up the kids later from the babysitter.",
        "Molly: Why aren't the kids with Lily?",
        "Emma: Because Holden is, and he -- he will be for a while.",
        "Molly: Why?",
        "Emma: He's gone away with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Maybe going away is a bad idea.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. I get why you're doing this, and I agree with you.",
        "Lily: You do?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Forcing Faith to look at the consequences of her actions -- I think it's a good idea.",
        "Lily: Or it's a last resort.",
        "Holden: Look, she has a serious problem, and I had been reluctant to admit it, but you have dealt with it head-on. And I think we need to deal with it now as a family.",
        "Lily: But we're not a family anymore.",
        "Holden: Yes, we are.",
        "Lily: That was fast.",
        "Faith: Don't get too excited. If you want me to go away with you, fine. I'll go -- on one condition.",
        "Lily: What's that?",
        "Faith: I want Molly to come with us.",
        "Holden: Faith, this is a family matter.",
        "Faith: And your girlfriend's not family?",
        "Holden: This is for the three of us to work out. Molly has nothing to do with it.",
        "Faith: Mom can't stand Molly. That's the only reason why you're saying no to her coming with us.",
        "Holden: I'm saying no because it's not about you calling the shots. It's about what your parents want for you. And what we want is for you to see things more clearly.",
        "Faith: I already see things clearly, thanks.",
        "Lily: Faith, this isn't a lecture trip.",
        "Faith: Right.",
        "Lily: It's about us being together, having fun, remembering how to trust one another.",
        "Faith: Do you hear yourself?",
        "Lily: Yes, I do. Baby, do you remember when you were 10 and we took that road trip to California? We had so much fun together.",
        "Faith: Yeah, we did, because you didn't hate me then.",
        "Lily: Faith, I could never hate you. Baby, I don't hate you.",
        "Holden: Your mother is telling the truth, and I think you know it.",
        "Faith: So I don't have a choice?",
        "Holden: No, you do have a choice on how you go on this trip. You can either go with an attitude, or you can go with an open mind.",
        "Faith: Fine.",
        "Holden: Good. Open minds for all of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: I'm having dinner with a guy I met.",
        "Luke: Well, that's pretty much considered a date.",
        "Noah: Luke, its just dinner.",
        "Luke: You know, we could go back and forth like this all afternoon.",
        "Noah: Please, don't make something out of nothing here.",
        "Luke: What's his name?",
        "Noah: Richard.",
        "Luke: Where'd you meet him?",
        "Noah: Are we really gonna do this?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Noah: I met him at therapy.",
        "Luke: Oh. So he's blind, too?",
        "Noah: No, he's not blind, too. He got into a car accident a while back and hurt his hand, so he's been going to the same place I do for P.T.",
        "Luke: And he asked you out on a date?",
        "Noah: Luke, how many times do I have to tell you it's not a date?",
        "Luke: So he's not gay? Is he gay or not, Noah?",
        "Noah: Yeah, he's gay.",
        "Luke: Well, then, that sounds like a date.",
        "Noah: All right, you know what? Fine. It's a date. Does that make you happy?",
        "[Luke scoffs]",
        "Luke: Do you like him?",
        "Noah: He's funny and nice.",
        "Luke: Great.",
        "Noah: It is nothing, okay? It's just easy to hang around him right now. There's no pressure, which is exactly what I want and need -- someone who's not --",
        "Luke: Me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Place looks good.",
        "Lily: Yeah. Can't believe we didn't hit any traffic.",
        "Holden: Yeah, we were lucky.",
        "Lily: And the weather is supposed to be gorgeous.",
        "Faith: I have no cell reception.",
        "Lily: Well, you'll live.",
        "Faith: This is torture. Dad, can I use your phone?",
        "Holden: Sorry, Honey. I tried to call Molly. No go.",
        "Lily: It's part of the adventure.",
        "Faith: You mean prison sentence. Where are we all gonna sleep?",
        "Holden: I'll take the couch.",
        "Lily: We'll share a room.",
        "Faith: You want me to sleep in the same room as you?",
        "Lily: Sweetie, we're gonna be sleeping in the same bed, so get over it.",
        "Faith: I could die right here -- die.",
        "Lily: There's a great trail ahead about a mile from here. We could walk to it and then --",
        "Faith: Walk a mile to walk some more? And then what? I magically turn into that stupid 10-year-old who loved long car rides and board games?",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: Did you remember the chocolate?",
        "Holden: Um -- other bag.",
        "Lily: Excellent.",
        "Faith: S'mores? Oh, my God. I love those things.",
        "Lily: Apparently your dad remembered that.",
        "Faith: Like that's gonna make this nightmare okay.",
        "Lily: No. Why would it? You want to help me get the rest of the groceries out of the car?",
        "Holden: Yeah, sure. See? It's working already.",
        "Lily: Maybe.",
        "Faith: Please. I cannot believe there are still places on this earth that don't have cell reception.",
        "[Faith groans]",
        "Faith: What am I gonna do?",
        "[Faith sighs]",
        "Faith: Hello.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: You ran upstairs before I had a chance to tell you what -- what Holden and Lily were doing together.",
        "Molly: I know what they were doing.",
        "Emma: Faith has reached some kind of a breaking point. She's really bad off. And they -- they took her up to the cottage to see if they could get through to her.",
        "Molly: I get it. Parent intervention. Capital idea.",
        "Emma: Yes. I'm -- I'm so sorry that he had plans with you tonight.",
        "Molly: Emma, I am crazy about your son. I think you know that. And I get very jealous very quickly. But I know better than to try to compete for first place with his kids.",
        "Emma: He is so worried about Faith.",
        "Molly: I know. So am I. I've even tried helping, I've tried not helping, all at Lily's request. So I feel a little bit like a ping-pong ball, but I'll be okay. Those cookies smell so amazing.",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "Emma: Time to take them out. Oh, my goodness. Ooh, I --",
        "Molly: Are you okay?",
        "Emma: Mmm. Oh. [Laughs] Not the bender I used to be.",
        "Molly: All right. Hey, let me do it, okay?",
        "Emma: Thank you.",
        "Molly: I can do this.",
        "Emma: [Laughs] Watch now. Don't burn yourself. There you go. Ooh, they look good, huh?",
        "Molly: Oh, my goodness. Oh, these look so good. Oh, Holden would scarf up this whole tray in 10 minutes if he was here.",
        "Emma: Would you, uh, like the address of the cabin? What's going on out there is very, very serious.",
        "Molly: Exactly, so can you imagine how furious Lily will be if I just show up there?",
        "Emma: So what? So what? I've had it with Lily. I mean, look, I love her. I always will. But she really, really broke Holden's heart. And you were there for him through all that. Thank you. He relies on you, and you -- you are very, very special to him.",
        "Molly: Wow. Thank you. I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.",
        "Emma: Well, it's true. It's true. And you have. You have been there for Holden, and for -- and for Faith. And I -- I think they probably both need you right now.",
        "Molly: All this because I helped take the cookies out of the oven? I -- I really don't know what to say.",
        "Emma: If you can help Holden with Faith, then Lily's gonna have to welcome that no matter how she feels about you. Let me get you the address.",
        "Molly: What if -- [Molly sniffles] What if Holden thinks I'm asking desperate, just showing up like this?",
        "Emma: Well, I'll straighten him out when he gets home. He'll listen to his mom.",
        "Molly: If he knows what's good for him.",
        "Emma: Now, look. There is nothing -- nothing desperate about helping someone you love.",
        "Molly: Then I guess I just need one more thing.",
        "Emma: Directions?",
        "[Molly laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Faith coughs]",
        "[Car doors slam]",
        "Lily: Still can't get through to Molly?",
        "Holden: No. I know my mother was gonna let Molly know what I was doing, but I just wanted to let her know myself. Here. Let me help you out with that.",
        "Lily: Thanks. I used to love this part, when we'd go on trips with the kids.",
        "Holden: What, hauling the heavy stuff?",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: Settling the kids in and settling ourselves in after that. The kids would be so excited.",
        "Holden: So would you.",
        "Lily: I know. I'm easy. Guess things are a little different this time.",
        "Holden: Yeah, just a little.",
        "Lily: Thanks, Holden. Thanks for coming with me. You were right. I needed your help.",
        "Holden: You're welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Look, I didn't mean to hurt you, okay?",
        "Luke: No, no, it's fine. I shouldn't have asked. You didn't want to get into it. I shouldn't have pressured you.",
        "Noah: Look, it's just easy to spend time with Richard.",
        "Luke: Easy.",
        "Noah: I don't feel like I owe him anything. We don't have any history. He doesn't hover over me in case I fall. And I don't feel any pressure from him to be the old me, because he doesn't know the old me.",
        "Luke: So I hover and I pressure you. Got it.",
        "Noah: He doesn't love me, so he doesn't try to fix me.",
        "Luke: Let me get this straight. You want to be with somebody that you don't love?",
        "Noah: Luke, I am not with Richard. But it is easy to hang around with him right now. Can't you just accept that without getting all worked up? I've explained it to you.",
        "Luke: You know I wanted to be there for you.",
        "Noah: And you also said that for us to be together, it needs to be all or nothing. Well, I can't do \"All\" right now. Richard and I are friends. That's it. Come on. What are you thinking?",
        "Luke: That this sucks.",
        "Noah: Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.",
        "Luke: When are you meeting him?",
        "Noah: Soon.",
        "[Luke scoffs]",
        "Luke: I'm out of here.",
        "Noah: Luke --",
        "Luke: No. Noah, I want you to get what you need more than you will ever know, but I am not gonna sit here and watch it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Dr. Oliver --",
        "Reid: You're back. Nice trip?",
        "Bob: Yes, thank you. Uh, we have to talk.",
        "Reid: Well, I've got called in for a head trauma. He's being scanned right now.",
        "Bob: Dr. Oliver, the man that's suing you for malpractice has lodged a complaint with the medical licensing board.",
        "Reid: Meaning what?",
        "Bob: Meaning that they're opening a formal investigation into the death of Annie Judd.",
        "Reid: Okay. Thanks for the tip.",
        "Bob: No, no, no. The guidelines of this hospital state that if you're under investigation by the medical board that you're put on suspension through the duration of the inquiry.",
        "Reid: You're not serious?",
        "Bob: I'm sorry.",
        "Reid: That's draconian, Dr. Hughes.",
        "Bob: Well, be that as it may --",
        "Reid: Overrule them.",
        "Bob: I can't do that.",
        "Reid: Yes, you can. You just won't 'cause you're a coward.",
        "[Kim gasps]",
        "Kim: Don't you talk to my husband like that.",
        "Reid: Hi, I'm the best surgeon at this hospital. I do something that matters. And what do you do? Oh, that's right. You produce tabloid television.",
        "Bob: Okay, that's enough. You can say what you want to me, but you make one more remark like that to my wife, I'll knock you on your back.",
        "Reid: Go ahead, Bob. Great example to set. Then we can both be suspended. Let the interns run this zoo into the ground.",
        "Luke: All right, come with me and keep your mouth shut.",
        "Reid: What the hell are you doing? Let go of me!",
        "[Bob sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Got all that stuff.",
        "Lily: What you doing?",
        "[Slurred]",
        "Faith: Nothing.",
        "[Glasses clanking]",
        "Lily: You okay?",
        "Faith: Yeah. Whoops. My bad.",
        "Lily: Faith, what in the world is going on with you?",
        "Faith: I'm having fun, just like you wanted.",
        "Holden: She's been drinking.",
        "Lily: What? We were gone for like five minutes.",
        "Faith: You know that scotch burns, and then it doesn't?",
        "Lily: Of all the stupid and irresponsible things --",
        "Holden: You know what, Lily? Let's just try and deal with this calmly, please?",
        "Lily: No, Holden, I'm not gonna be calm. She's drunk, and she doesn't even care that we see it! You are just trying to sabotage this whole thing.",
        "Faith: Wow. You are such a drama queen.",
        "Holden: Is that how you want this whole trip to go?",
        "Faith: Hello. I didn't even want to come on this trip, remember? This whole thing is a joke.",
        "Lily: My wanting to take care of you, to help you to spend time with you is a joke? Am I -- am I that bad of a mother, Faith? Do I make your life that miserable?",
        "Faith: Yeah, you have. I hate my life, and it's all your fault.",
        "Holden: Okay. That would be the alcohol talking, and we've heard enough. Your mother, she loves you very much, and we are both worried sick about you.",
        "Faith: Isn't it a little late for that?",
        "Holden: You know what? You're so busy being defiant that you just don't understand that the reason we're up here right now is because we love you.",
        "Faith: What good is it?",
        "Holden: What do you mean?",
        "Faith: Do you know what it's like to be me, to have you two as parents? Has there been one solid month in my whole entire life in which things have been stable a -- and normal?",
        "Holden: Come on. That's an exaggeration.",
        "Faith: You guys are always talking about love and fun and togetherness and family. Are you serious? You guys break up, get divorced, get back together, remarry, leave again, disappear. I can't even keep it straight when kids ask me about it at school.",
        "Lily: And that must be very, very hard for you.",
        "Faith: I wonder what it would be like to be one of my friends. You know, two parents, one marriage, sticking it out. Nothing ever really changes.",
        "Holden: I really wish that we could have given you that.",
        "Faith: You guys always talk about always being there for us. Well, are you really, always?",
        "Holden: Faith, listen, I understand what you're feeling, okay, and I am here for you. And so is your mom. We're here for you right now because we care about you.",
        "Lily: We've made a lot of mistakes, but we have tried to make up for them, Faith. We are far from perfect at it, but we've tried. But things are different now. We can't do it alone. We need your help, Faith.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Faith: I don't know how to help. I don't know how to stop. I don't know anything anymore!",
        "Lily: Baby, come here. Here, Sweetie. It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: What the hell are you doing? I was in the middle of a conversation with my chief of staff!",
        "Luke: No, you were about to get canned by your chief of staff 'cause you couldn't stop running your mouth.",
        "Reid: Well, I'm already on suspension thanks to Mr. Judd's malpractice suit against me. Now Dr. Hughes, who fought so hard to keep me here, is turning his back on me.",
        "Luke: Can you stop being so outraged and just try to tow the line?",
        "Reid: Could you try taking a hike, since you don't know what the hell you're talking about?",
        "Luke: All right, the first thing is you've got to respect Dr. Hughes a little bit more, no matter what kind of information he's in charge of delivering to you.",
        "Reid: You don't get it. He could have fought for me. He's choosing not to! He's sticking his head in the sand! I'm the one who's gonna lose my career, not him. He might as well just shoot me. It would be a hell of a lot easier.",
        "Luke: What are you talking about?",
        "Reid: If I can't work, if I can't be in the operating room, I've got nothing.",
        "Luke: But you yourself said that these charges were baseless.",
        "Reid: Nobody's listening to me.",
        "Luke: Well, then, get yourself a lawyer and fight for it. Make them listen to you and just -- just keep doing your job.",
        "Reid: I can't do that. I am on suspension until the inquiry's closed.",
        "Luke: Well, maybe that's a good thing.",
        "Reid: Why, so I don't accidentally kill Noah, too?",
        "Luke: No. So you can focus on getting these charges dropped.",
        "Reid: I can't focus without my work. I haven't had more than a day off since I started med school. It's all I know. All I am is a doctor. Without it, I truly don't have anything else to hold on to. That's why, Mr. Snyder, I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I probably already know the answer to this, but why do you continue to put up with that guy?",
        "Bob: Dr. Oliver has a set of skills that I've never seen in another physician. I just can't turn my back on him.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bob: Oh, it's you for a change.",
        "Kim: Yikes. Excuse me. Uh, Kim Hughes. Yeah. Really? Of course I want to cover it. I'll be right in as soon as I can. This could be big.",
        "Bob: Okay, let's go. I'm going with you.",
        "Kim: Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: You need me? For what?",
        "Reid: Your name, your money, your power -- all of it. I want to use it.",
        "Luke: How?",
        "Reid: Bribe somebody, blackmail them. I don't care. Just get me back in the operating room.",
        "Luke: Well, the thing --",
        "Reid: Look, I don't -- I know you don't care about me. Why would you? But if you can help me, I can help Noah. Isn't Noah the one man in this world you love enough to do anything for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Mommy, I feel so sick.",
        "Lily: I know, Baby.",
        "Faith: Things are kind of spinning.",
        "Lily: That will stop, eventually.",
        "Faith: I'm sorry. I know you guys love me.",
        "Molly: Surprise. I'm sorry. I should have knocked first.",
        "Holden: Molly, what are you doing here?",
        "Molly: I should have called. I just didn't think. I -- I'll leave you guys. This was a horrible idea.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. Just -- just wait.",
        "Lily: Actually, Faith could use some fresh air. Come on, Sweetie. Let's go outside for a minute.",
        "Faith: Okay.",
        "Molly: Is Faith sick?",
        "Holden: She's drunk.",
        "Molly: Oh, no.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but we're dealing with it.",
        "Molly: Yeah, I can see that. And I'm sorry to intrude, or at least quite so much.",
        "Holden: Did my mother tell you that we were up here?",
        "Molly: And she told me that I should come up here. She thought I could help. But I think it was a big, big mistake.",
        "Holden: You know, I -- I tried to call you when we got up here, but there was no cell reception.",
        "Molly: It's okay.",
        "Holden: Are you upset that I didn't tell you that I was coming up here with my ex?",
        "Molly: I was worried.",
        "Holden: It's bad.",
        "Molly: Yeah, I can see that.",
        "Holden: And it gets worse. Faith was caught at school with prescription pills that weren't hers.",
        "Molly: Where did --",
        "Holden: Get them? Do you remember that package that she sent to you over at WOAK?",
        "Molly: Oh, my God, Holden. I swear to you, I had no idea.",
        "Holden: We know that. But Lily thought that we should step in, and fast. She wanted to handle everything herself, but that's when I decided that I should be here.",
        "Molly: Well, I think that was a really good call. She's your daughter, too.",
        "Holden: Right.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry. I'm sorry things have gotten so bad.",
        "Holden: It's a pretty big cry for help.",
        "Molly: This may be a really stupid question, but do I try and talk to Faith?",
        "Holden: No. No, not this time. I -- I really think that Lily is the only one who can help her get through this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You feeling better?",
        "Faith: A little, yeah.",
        "Lily: I'm glad.",
        "Faith: I'm sorry, Mom.",
        "Lily: And I'm sorry you felt like you had to get drunk in order to deal with me.",
        "Faith: I just don't think I'm ready for this.",
        "Lily: Well, we got off to a rocky start. Tomorrow will be better.",
        "Faith: No, Mom. I don't think I can do all this talking. It's not gonna help. Can I please just go back to Oakdale with Molly?",
        "Lily: No, Sweetie, I'm sorry. You can't.",
        "Faith: Why not? You're not being fair.",
        "Lily: Look, I know it feels like I betrayed you, and I know how horrible that must feel.",
        "Faith: No, you don't.",
        "Lily: Faith, Sweetie, I know this is a hard concept for you to wrap your head around, but I was your age once.",
        "Faith: Oh, here we go?",
        "Lily: And when I was, I was as mad at my mother as you are at me right now, maybe even worse. But I'll tell you something else. When you were born, I made a silent pact to myself that I would never, ever let us get to this. And look at where we are. I let you down, Faith, in -- in a big way, and I know that you hate me for that.",
        "Faith: I don't. It's not hate.",
        "Lily: Yeah, it is. It's -- it's a certain kind of hate. I know, because I felt that way about my mother more than once. And even now, years later, when I work through all my feelings with her, I -- I still have those days when I just want to pull her hair out strand by stand because I feel like she thinks she knows better than I do and I don't even know my own heart unless she tells me. But I'll tell you, when I think about the time somewhere down the line when she's not gonna be there to love me in her often imperfect way, it breaks my heart. She'd kill to protect me, Faith, until her last breath, and I know that. And, Sweetie, I would do the same for you. Look, I know I've made mistakes that weren't about you but that have affected you, and not in a good way. But it doesn't change for a second how much I love you.",
        "Faith: I know that.",
        "Lily: But --",
        "Faith: It's not gonna help me any right now.",
        "Lily: I know, Baby, and I want to change that. But I can't do it alone. You have to help me through it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Why did you come back here?",
        "Luke: I need to talk to you. Here's the thing. I'm not gonna do anything illegal, immoral, or underhanded, even if it's for the right reason. I've done it before, and it never turns out the way I wanted it to, and I never feel good about myself afterwards. It makes me feel like I'm Damian Grimaldi's son.",
        "Reid: You are Damian Grimaldi's son.",
        "Luke: Yeah. You called me Mr. Snyder for a reason.",
        "Reid: Well, I guess I'm out of luck then. A plea from a lovesick boyfriend to a medical board isn't gonna get me back on the operating room.",
        "Luke: Probably not, but I think my grandmother might.",
        "Reid: Come again?",
        "Luke: She has friends in high places. I asked her for help, and because she loves me, she made a few calls.",
        "Reid: To whom?",
        "Luke: The Texas medical review licensing board. They scheduled an emergency hearing. So you have to go, and you have to fight well. But I guess you fighting and saying that you're right probably wouldn't be very hard for you, so -- this is the part where you say thank you.",
        "Reid: Thank you.",
        "Luke: Well, don't schedule any surgeries. We have a lot of work to do if we're gonna beat this.",
        "Reid: \"We\"?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I'm not letting you do this alone. I'm going to Texas with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Listen, I -- I know that we both asked for your help with Faith, but I -- I really think that Lily is probably the only one who can help her at this point.",
        "Molly: I don't disagree. And I have to tell you, I never would have come up here if Emma hadn't suggested it. But I will admit the minute -- no, the second she said it, I could already picture myself in the car doing 75 to get to you. And if that seems desperate, I'm sorry. But you know what? I have been desperate. I have done desperate. And this is something different. And you want to know something else?",
        "Holden: What?",
        "[Molly sighs]",
        "Molly: You really hurt my feelings by coming up here without calling me first.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I am so sorry about that.",
        "Molly: Yeah, you should be. But I'm sorry, 'cause I should have stayed home and waited for you to make it up to me with flowers and such.",
        "Holden: I still can.",
        "Molly: I fully expect that.",
        "Holden: I can take you out on that date that I was gonna take you out on tonight. I can do that.",
        "Molly: Mm-hmm. Also expected, because you should see the dress I bought for the occasion.",
        "Holden: Tell me about it.",
        "Molly: No. You have to wait.",
        "Holden: Not for this, I hope.",
        "[Footsteps approaching]",
        "Holden: How are you feeling?",
        "Faith: I'm a little better.",
        "Lily: She's hungry. I'm gonna make us some dinner. Molly, you're welcome to stay.",
        "Molly: Uh, thank you, but I think I'm gonna take off. Get better. Your folks love you. And don't ever use me again like you did to get those pills. I mean it, okay?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Molly: Hello.",
        "[Breaking up]",
        "Kim: Molly, its Kim.",
        "Molly: Kim? I'm sorry, we have a really lousy connection.",
        "Kim: Uh, okay. Can you hear me now?",
        "Molly: Sort of.",
        "Kim: Okay, Molly, there's a breaking story. It could be very big. Outside the courthouse in Chicago.",
        "Molly: I'm sorry, Kim, did you say Chicago?",
        "Kim: Right, Chicago. I wanted you to have first dibs, but --",
        "Molly: Got it. Story at the courthouse. I need a diversion anyway. I can be there in like 20 minutes.",
        "Kim: Molly, wait a minute! When you hear what it is, you may --",
        "[Breaking up]",
        "Molly: Kim, can you hear me?",
        "Kim: Molly!",

        "Kim: Okay, okay. [Dialing] Oh -- nuts! I can't get a hold of her right now.",
        "Bob: Does she want to cover it?",
        "Kim: Oh, sure she wants to. She's in for a rude awakening when she gets there. I lost the connection before I could tell her what the story's about.",
        "Bob: Oh, she'll be fine.",
        "Kim: I don't know. Maybe I should meet her there just in case. Ooh. That really makes a hypocrite, doesn't it? I'm a hypocrite. I keep complaining that you're running around working all the time, and here I am, talking about running to Chicago at the drop of a hat.",
        "Bob: You know, I think we're both trying too hard.",
        "Kim: What, to be together and be happy?",
        "Bob: To reassure each other. It's something that should be a given. This calls for extreme measures.",
        "Kim: What are you talking about?",
        "Bob: Hey, Joe, can you record something for me?",
        "Joe: Yeah, sure.",
        "Bob: Okay.",
        "Kim: What are you doing?",
        "Bob: You -- just stay there and listen, and no producing, because I'm producing, I'm directing, and I'm starring.",

        "Reid: Al's?",
        "Luke: You have a problem with Al's?",
        "Reid: No. It's just that being your grandmother's plane and all, I thought they'd have white-glove, in-flight catering -- you know, borscht, caviar, whatever it is you people eat.",
        "Luke: That's not really my style. I get chili.",
        "Reid: With cornbread?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Reid: All right, excellent. I'm gonna get some magazines for the flight.",
        "Luke: Okay, well, don't be long.",

        "Bob: I wanted you to have them as a keepsake that you'll always remember that day.",
        "Kim: Oh, Sweetheart, that is such a -- mm -- lovely thing to do. Thank you.",
        "Bob: Well, you're welcome, and I -- I just thought that we should tape this -- what do you call it now, Joe?",
        "Joe: Digitize.",
        "Bob: Digitize?",
        "Joe: Yeah.",
        "Bob: I wanted to digitize this moment so that I could say once again that I will make sure that every -- every day, every week, every year for the next 25 years will be as special as this day was.",

        "Reporter: How did that happen?",
        "Molly: Good question.",
        "Silas: Well, my attorneys found some irregularities during the trial, brought them to light. The judge did the right thing and set me free. Excuse me. Thank you very much. Hello, Molly.",

        "Silas: Justice has a way of prevailing. It is wonderful seeing you again.",
        "Molly: I was sent here on assignment. I had absolutely no idea it was about you.",
        "Silas: Really?",
        "Molly: Are you insane? You publicly humiliated me and lied and now somehow slithered your way out of an attempted murder charge, even after you admitted to it on tape.",

        "Lily: [Laughs] We got snowed in for one day, but we made it seem worse so that we could stay for three. We were so happy then.",
        "Holden: Yeah, we were.",
