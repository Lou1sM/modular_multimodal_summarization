        "Parker: Jack!",
        "Jack: Hey, buddy. How are you?",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: So, what's up? Your mom said you wanted to talk to me.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I just wanted to see you before I went to my dad's.",
        "Jack: You're going to Hal's?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I'm going to stay there for a while.",
        "Jack: Really? That sounds really cool.",
        "Parker: I guess so.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Listen, why don't you go grab a cup of hot chocolate, and we'll talk about it? What's this about?",
        "Carly: Um, Hal just wants Parker to go and live with him for a bit. I think he's maybe lonely with Emily gone, and he wants the company.",
        "Jack: This has nothing to do with Emily or him being lonely. He's got Will and Gwen living with him. So what did he really say?",
        "Carly: I think he's concerned about everything that's going on between you and me, and he's afraid of what it'll to do to Parker.",
        "Jack: How long is Parker gonna be there?",
        "Carly: He didn't really specify. Hal's gonna pick him up here, because Parker wanted to see you first.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: It'll only be for a little while. Because we'll get through this, and you'll come home.",
        "Jack: Carly, don't. We are not gonna lie to ourselves. You might as well know that I'm here to meet with Jessica.",
        "Carly: Jessica? Oh, come on, Jack. Come on, you don't need a lawyer.",
        "Jack: Yes, Carly, I do.",

        "Holden: Why would it matter to you whether or not I told Lily that we had this conversation?",
        "Jade: Well, she's just looking for a reason to throw me out.",
        "Holden: You mean another reason? You've given her one good one already. But yet, she continues to let you stick around.",
        "Jade: I'm really, really grateful, I am. But she's pregnant, and she's supposed to avoid stress, isn't she?",
        "Holden: I just came down here to make sure that the rules were clear. Why would that be stressful for Lily?",
        "Jade: Yeah, I guess you're right. I guess it wouldn't be. It's really cool that you guys can be so honest with each other.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Holden: Excuse me. Hello?",
        "Lily: Where are you? Your pasta's getting cold.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I got a little tied up. I'm on my way. See you soon.",
        "Jade: She doesn't even know you're with me, does she?",
        "Holden: You know what? This conversation's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Casey: Have you guys seen Maddie around?",
        "Gwen: Nope.",
        "Will: We've been here a while, too.",
        "Casey: Damn. I thought I was late.",
        "Gwen: I bet she'll be here soon. Um, I suppose you heard the news about the club.",
        "Casey: What news? It's not happening?",
        "Gwen: No, no, no, it's happening. Um, it's we're gonna be working together, sort of.",
        "Casey: I'm not following.",
        "Will: Gwen's putting her band back together.",
        "Casey: Really? Good for you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, it was your grandma's idea. She wants us to play at the club. She wants to mix live sounds with the records you'll be spinning, so --",
        "Casey: Wow, cool.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. You sure?",
        "Casey: Why would I have a problem with your band playing at the club?",
        "Gwen: I don't know, it just means that we'll be working together a lot, and I just want to make sure that you're okay with it.",
        "Casey: Of course I'm okay with it. The bad stuff that happened between us, it's all in the past. We've -- we've moved on.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, yeah. I know I have.",
        "Maddie: Hi, sorry, sorry.",
        "Casey: And so have I.",
        "Maddie: What were you two talking about?",
        "Casey: Rock 'n' roll, a little history.",
        "Maddie: Oh, well, if you don't mind me changing the subject -- who's up for a party?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: So what do you think?",
        "Margo: I haven't read it. I don't really plan to.",
        "Kim: Oh, come on. You're not even the least bit curious? I mean, your sister Katie's right on the cover.",
        "Margo: Yeah, it looks like a bunch of gossip to me. I've never been one for gossip. Well, all right, fine, I am curious, you know, to look at it, just to find out who wrote the thing.",
        "Kim: Oh, well, that I would like to know. I keep wondering. You think it's somebody we know?",
        "Margo: Probably.",
        "Katie: Hey!",
        "Margo: Hey, look who's back! Hi, Mike. When did you get in?",
        "Mike: Today.",
        "Kim: Welcome back.",
        "Margo: So you're here for the big shindig? Just in time. Katie, any idea who wrote this thing?",
        "Katie: What makes you think I would know?",
        "Margo: Well, it's not a coincidence that you're prominently featured on the cover. So come on, what does it mean, hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I have waited so long for this, to make love to you as your wife. It's like all my dreams have come true.",
        "Paul: It's amazing, isn't it?",
        "Emily: Oh, after everything that's happened to us, it's downright miraculous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Are you lurking outside Paul's apartment like some crazed stalker?",
        "Meg: Not lurking. I couldn't bring myself to knock.",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing here in the first place?",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, but I really don't see how that's any of your business.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you're right, it's not. It's just that you and Paul have been trying to convince everybody that you can't even stand to be in the same room together anymore.",
        "Meg: This isn't a social call. I need to talk to him.",
        "Jennifer: Well, don't you think your timing is a little off? It is his first night home since he got married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hello?! Anybody hear me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Can't we take a little more time before you start going to lawyers?",
        "Jack: Why, Carly? What's the point?",
        "Carly: The point is, we need a cooling off period, Jack. You know, they say that you're never supposed to make an important decision when you're angry.",
        "Jack: I'm not angry. I'm sad. And I've made my decision.",
        "Carly: Jack, please. Wow, that looks good.",
        "Jack: Hey. Buddy, pull up a chair. Come on, tell me what's on your mind.",
        "Carly: Okay, well, I'm just gonna go and have a seat over there so you boys can talk.",
        "Parker: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Jack: So what's the scoop? You having a bit of a rough time?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Yeah? Feeling a little mixed up?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Everything's so weird. You're gone. I'm going to my dad's.",
        "Jack: Oh, so you're starting to feel like you don't have a home, is that it?",
        "Parker: I guess.",
        "Jack: Well, did you think that in some ways, it's just the opposite? Come on, not only do you have one home -- Parker, you've got three.",
        "Parker: I do?",
        "Jack: Sure. You've got the home with your mom, and J.J. and Sage. And then you've got the home with your dad. And I know Hal's probably really missing spending time with you. That's probably why he wants you to come over and hang out for a while.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Where's my third home?",
        "Jack: With me. Where'd you think?",
        "Parker: For real?",
        "Jack: Of course, yeah. Listen, Parker, wherever I am, that's your home, too, forever.",
        "Parker: Forever? But you and Mom said that you'd be together forever, too. That didn't turn out to be true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Look, I'm not trying to cause any trouble, okay? We're both on the same side. We're both trying to protect Luke.",
        "Holden: Right, so you're gonna stay down here at Cal's. You're gonna do your best to avoid Luke, and you're gonna steer clear of Lily. I want your word on that.",
        "Jade: You have my word.",
        "Holden: Good. I'm gonna remember this conversation.",
        "Jade: So will I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: At least you're getting your appetite back.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but what about you? You haven't even touched yours.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'll wait till your father comes home. I wonder what's taking him so long.",
        "Luke: Ah, he'll be here soon. [Door closes] See? I'm a psychic.",
        "Lily: Where have you been? I've been worried about you.",
        "Holden: You're not supposed to get worried. No stress, remember?",
        "Lily: Okay, then don't disappear without an explanation.",
        "Holden: Everything's okay. Don't worry about it.",
        "Lily: Okay, okay.",
        "Holden: Smells good.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, we've been saving some for you, but you better move fast. I've been making up for lost time.",
        "Lucinda: Ah, there you are, my whole family. My wonderful, wonderful family. Hi, darling.",
        "Luke: Hello.",
        "Lucinda: And you, it's so good to see you. It's wonderful to see you out of a hospital bed. How are you feeling?",
        "Luke: I feel good, Grandma.",
        "Lucinda: Great. Then you wouldn't mind if I borrow your mom for a couple of hours?",
        "Lily: Okay, I told you on the telephone, I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying home with Luke.",
        "Luke: Mom, don't be silly. If Grandma wants you to go, you should go.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you, Sweetheart. Look, darling, I just -- I just need you to help me through this ridiculous publication party.",
        "Lily: Since when do you need me to help you through anything?",
        "Lucinda: I need a sidekick. Come on. I need someone to say that my wig is cute. Moral support. Tell her it's okay to go with me.",
        "Holden: It is.",
        "Luke: We'll be fine.",
        "Lily: I'm not dressed.",
        "Lucinda: You look gorgeous.",
        "Lily: All right.",
        "Lucinda: All right.",
        "Lily: Just for a little while. Why not? Okay, call me if you need anything -- anything.",
        "Holden: We will. Have fun.",
        "Lily: Okay, thank you.",
        "Lucinda: We're gonna try. And I won't keep her past her curfew. Come on, come on.",
        "Holden: Looks like it's just you and me.",
        "Luke: So, maybe you can tell me what you obviously didn't want to tell her. Where'd you just go?",
        "Holden: I went to talk to your girlfriend.",
        "Luke: Mm. So you went to lay down the law?",
        "Holden: No, I went to cover your back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I'm sure that invitation will get all of us in, so --",
        "Casey: A book party? Man, sounds kind of boring.",
        "Will: Don't worry, Casey, you don't actually have to read.",
        "Casey: I hope not.",
        "Gwen: Free food. I'm always down for that.",
        "Casey: Wait, how did you get invited to this, anyway?",
        "Maddie: Well I actually read books.",
        "Casey: Oh, really? Did you read that one?",
        "Maddie: \"Oakdale Confidential\"? No, I haven't, but I'm dying to get my hands on it. I heard it's really hot.",
        "Gwen: Oh, my, hot book, hot party. What are we waiting for?",
        "Casey: Let's go.",
        "Will: Okay, let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm not the only person on the cover, you know? There's Maddie and Carly. It's called \"Oakdale Confidential.\" I think it's about a lot of people in town.",
        "Mike: Unfortunately.",
        "Margo: Ooh, you don't sound too happy about that.",
        "Katie: I just don't think Mike enjoys seeing his name in print.",
        "Kim: Actually, I can kind of understand why, I was just leaping through this thing, and I saw something right about here, I think it was.",
        "Mike: What page is that?",
        "Kim: 131? 132. 132. Oh, great, I upset him. I'm so sorry.",
        "Katie: No, no, it's okay. I think he's just tired from all the traveling. He's fine.",
        "Kim: I'm gonna find Lucinda. This suspense is getting old.",
        "Margo: So, you're honestly telling me you have no idea who wrote this?",
        "Katie: Do you?",
        "Maddie: Hey, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Maddie: Hey, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Margo: Hi, Maddie.",
        "Casey: Hey, Mom.",
        "Margo: Casey.",
        "Casey: What are you doing here?",
        "Margo: Um, I just dropped in. I'm not gonna be staying long. What are you doing here?",
        "Casey: Maddie got an invite.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, so then you won't be staying long then either, will you?",
        "Casey: Okey dokey.",
        "Maddie: Is that Mike?",
        "Katie: Yeah. He just got back in town today.",
        "Maddie: Oh, that's great. You must be thrilled. How long is he staying?",
        "Katie: Forever. We've finally set the date for the wedding.",
        "Margo: Whoa, you did? When?",
        "Katie: June.",
        "Margo: Oh, goodness, I'm so happy for you, baby!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: If you're so worried about interrupting Paul, what are you doing here?",
        "Jennifer: I came by to bring a present -- a wedding gift. And I was gonna leave it outside the door.",
        "Meg: A wedding gift? I thought you'd turned your back on Paul forever.",
        "Jennifer: I decided that all those negative feelings were just hurting me more than they were hurting him. So I am trying to let go of my anger.",
        "Meg: Well, aren't you a lesson for us all?",
        "Jennifer: Okay, look, it's not gonna happen right away. But I figure that this gift could be the start at burying the hatchet.",
        "Meg: And where would you like to bury it? In his back, maybe? 'Cause I'll be happy to hold him down while you do that.",
        "Jennifer: This isn't a joke, Meg. I'm trying to heal. And I'm doing it for myself as much as anyone else.",
        "Meg: Well, your brother's gonna take advantage of it. That's what he does. He takes advantage of people. And that's why I'm here to let him know not to do it to me, not this time. I am not gonna take the fall for Dusty's disappearance just because he's off the hook.",
        "Jennifer: What are you so afraid that my brother's gonna say about you, Meg? Or are you more afraid of what he might do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Look, I finally -- I finally got you into this sexy little number, and you're not even gonna let me feast my eyes. Look at you. You're more beautiful than ever. I just want to memorize this moment.",
        "Emily: Okay, that's enough memorizing.",
        "Paul: Hey, we -- we have all night.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know, and I plan to use every second of it.",
        "Meg: Did you hear that? It sounded like somebody fell.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, it did.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe you should knock, make sure everything's okay.",
        "Paul: Someone's at the door.",
        "Emily: Shh! Maybe they'll go away.",
        "Jennifer: Paul? Emily? Is everything okay?",
        "Paul: She knows we're in here. She won't go away.",
        "Emily: What is wrong with people? Don't they realize it's our wedding night?",
        "Paul: I know. I'll get rid of her.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, you better.",
        "Jennifer: Hi. I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: Everything okay?",
        "Jen: Yeah. I really didn't mean to bother you. I just came by to leave this, and I -- we heard a noise, and it sounded like somebody fell.",
        "Emily: We? We? Who was with you?",
        "Jennifer: Meg. Oh. She must've taken off.",
        "Paul: What the hell was Meg doing here?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. Wanted to warn you about something.",
        "Emily: What -- warn about what?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, um, I don't know, you'll have to ask her. I'm really -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you.",
        "Emily: That's okay. Thanks for dropping by. Thanks for the present. I'm sure it's beautiful.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, okay. All right, all right, then good night.",
        "Paul: Jennifer, are you okay?",
        "Jennifer: I'm fine.",
        "Paul: You know, I know that you and I are not on the best of terms, but I hate seeing you this upset.",
        "Emily: She just said she was fine, Paul.",
        "Paul: She's lying. I think you better come in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Are you okay?",
        "Lucinda: I'm fine. Here comes the glamour. Let's do it.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Margo: Well, well, well, here's the lady behind the mystery.",
        "Kim: Good. And the woman who can answer the question on everybody's lips.",
        "Both: Who is anonymous?",
        "Lucinda: Tell you, and ruin the surprise? Oh, you must give me more credit.",
        "Lily: Oh, what is the big deal anyway? What's the book about?",
        "Margo: Well, it's the secret and sordid lives of local townsfolk.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lily: And Carly? Why is Carly on the cover?",
        "Lucinda: Well, the last time anybody checked, she's still living here in Oakdale.",
        "Margo: And she certainly is secret and sordid.",
        "Lily: I thought this was supposed to be fiction, right?",
        "Lucinda: My darling child, good fiction is based on truth, surely, isn't it?",
        "Lily: Would you excuse me for one moment please? Thank you. I'll be right back.",
        "Maddie: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Maddie, you're on the cover.",
        "Maddie: I am?",
        "Casey: Don't pretend you didn't know. Obviously, that's why you got us to come here in the first place. So how'd you swing this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Hey, Lily, what's up?",
        "Lily: Are you coming to my mother's book party?",
        "Carly: No. No, I wasn't planning to.",
        "Lily: I suggest you rethink that.",
        "Carly: Is something wrong?",
        "Lily: Uh, you're on the cover of a new book called \"Oakdale Confidential.\" What do you think?",
        "Carly: Are you kidding?",
        "Lily: No. So come on, tell me the truth. Did you write the book?",
        "Carly: Is somebody saying that I did?",
        "Lily: Oh, it's credited to anonymous. That doesn't mean you can't get in trouble.",
        "Carly: I don't know if I can get away.",
        "Lily: I would try.",
        "Jack: Something wrong?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jack: Listen, if you got someplace to be, go. We're fine.",
        "Carly: It's not important.",
        "Jack: Hal's gonna be here any second, and this is man talk anyway, right, Parker?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Yeah. So you go and do what you gotta do.",
        "Carly: Are you sure?",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Carly: Okay. Okay, then. Now, when your dad comes to get you, do not forget this bag, okay? And sleep tight, and I'll call you first thing in the morning, all right?",
        "Parker: Okay, Mom.",
