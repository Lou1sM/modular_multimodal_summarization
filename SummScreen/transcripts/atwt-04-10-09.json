        "Lucy: Daddy!",
        "Craig: Good morning, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Actually, I need to ask you a favor.",
        "Lucy: Okay. Come in.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Lucy: So, what's up?",
        "Craig: Well, I need to leave this morning for an overnight trip to New York. Carly and I have a few meetings for Midnight Sun.",
        "Lucy: Is that a problem?",
        "Craig: Only where Johnny's concerned. I don't like to disrupt his schedule, so I was wondering if he could spend the night with you.",
        "Lucy: Really?",
        "Craig: Yeah. Unless you have other plans.",
        "Lucy: No, I don't. I would love to watch Johnny.",
        "Craig: Oh, great. Great. He's always so excited to spend time with you.",
        "Lucy: Thank you so much. That really means a lot.",
        "Craig: Me too. Feels good to know I can depend on you again.",
        "Lucy: You can.",
        "Craig: Listen, I know we still have a long way to go, but to have you and Johnny both back in my life after spending so much time alone -- well, I'm sure you can imagine what that means to me. Thank you, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: You're welcome.",
        "Craig: Okay. I'll let the sitter know what's up. Okay.",
        "Lucy: Safe trip.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Meg: How's Eliza?",
        "Paul: I'm not sure. The nurse asked me to step out for a little bit. There was a seat next to you.",
        "Meg: We're supposed to be taking turns sitting with her. We have to find her doctor.",
        "Paul: Hi. How's Eliza?",
        "Doctor: Her fever broke during the night.",
        "Meg: It did? Thank God!",
        "Doctor: She's responding well to the antibiotics. We should be able to discharge her this morning.",
        "Paul: And that's it? She's better?",
        "Meg: Not yet. I think the doctor's saying she'd be more comfortable at home.",
        "Paul: Well, I'll make sure to keep a close eye on her there.",
        "Doctor: Well, pneumonia can be tricky. Any sign the fever is returning, call me immediately.",
        "Meg: Oh, we will. I promise.",
        "Paul: Doctor, thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Meg: Do you know how lucky we are that we caught this in time? If we hadn't --",
        "Paul: I know. And don't worry. I'll hire a nurse to watch her full time.",
        "Meg: What? What?",
        "Paul: Well, you heard the doctor. She needs to be monitored.",
        "Meg: She already has a nurse. She has her mother. I'm the one who's gonna take care of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, what time are tryouts?",
        "Parker: 11:30.",
        "Carly: Hey, shortstop. So you won't be late.",
        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Carly: You know, those are keys to my car, not just to the house. Oh. I wasn't sure if you knew that from the enthusiastic response. I couldn't tell.",
        "Parker: Where am I supposed to go without Liberty?",
        "Carly: Parker, it's just for one night. Honestly.",
        "Parker: I still don't get why she had to go all the way to New York. How come she couldn't get an internship in Chicago?",
        "Carly: Parker, I rarely say this, but Craig is right. If you want your relationship to work, you're gonna have to let Liberty go off on her own sometimes.",
        "Parker: I know, but what if she doesn't want to come back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I'm so excited! I mean, I've never been to New York before, and I'm gonna get to see Soho and Fifth Avenue and Central Park!",
        "Jack: Take it easy there, Zagat. You're going there for an interview.",
        "Liberty: I know, for \"Fashionista Weekly\" magazine.",
        "Jack: Yes, and from what I understand, Craig and Carly have some business meetings lined up, so you probably won't have a lot of time to sight-see.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, that's true.",
        "Jack: But, if you think about it, have them take you to see your statue.",
        "Liberty: Oh, yeah! My statue that was named after me. I forgot!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jack: Yes, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Oh, Liberty!",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Jack: Craig.",
        "Craig: Jack!",
        "Jack: Your ride's here, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Okay. Oh, guys, this is kind of heavy.",
        "Jack: I got it.",
        "Liberty: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Listen, New York's a big town, so you be careful.",
        "Liberty: I will. Thank you.",
        "Jack: One more thing. One more thing. You knock 'em dead.",
        "Liberty: Oh, gosh! Count on it. Hey, I forgot something upstairs, so I'm gonna be down in two seconds.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Craig: Okay. She'll be fine, Jack. She'll be with me and Carly.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Ain't she just the luckiest girl in the world.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: My God! You didn't even know she was sick until I got there! I'm a nurse! Why would I let anybody else take care of my own daughter?",
        "Paul: It's not a decision you get to make.",
        "Meg: Think of Eliza and what's best for her, Paul.",
        "Paul: If you help me at all, you will do it at my house, and that doesn't change anything between us.",
        "Meg: I know that. You made it quite clear that you don't want anything to do with me.",
        "Paul: You can help me bring her home. That's as far as it goes.",
        "Meg: It's a start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I want to apologize for the way I acted yesterday.",
        "Lucy: You were upset.",
        "Dusty: That's no excuse.",
        "Lucy: You were trying to help Meg get her daughter back.",
        "Dusty: Anyway, I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: Look, I wanted to tell Meg the truth myself. I was horrified that Paul set her up so that she would lose custody of Eliza, but if I had come forward, then --",
        "Dusty: He would have gone straight to your father. I understand.",
        "Lucy: It must have been hard for you, huh? Dealing with Paul?",
        "Dusty: I don't understand how she could go back to him.",
        "Lucy: Well, do you know for sure that she has?",
        "Dusty: You saw them together just like I did.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but it might not mean what you think.",
        "Dusty: Sounds like you're telling me not to give up on Meg.",
        "Lucy: You never did talk to her last night, did you?",
        "Dusty: Nope.",
        "Lucy: So you don't know.",
        "Dusty: Know what?",
        "Lucy: Why Paul and Meg were at the hospital. Dusty, Eliza was admitted last night.",
        "Dusty: What? Is she all right?",
        "Lucy: She was diagnosed with pneumonia. But I called the hospital this morning, and I talked to her nurse, and she's responding to the antibiotics just fine. She's gonna be all right.",
        "Dusty: Thank God.",
        "Lucy: But that would explain why Meg and Paul were together last night.",
        "Dusty: Well.",
        "Lucy: Well, think about it. I mean, they were at the chapel. Meg was emotional, and Paul was just trying to comfort her.",
        "Dusty: So what?",
        "Lucy: So, maybe she hasn't chosen to go back to him.",
        "Dusty: Who knows?",
        "Lucy: Find out for sure. I mean, Paul can't use me anymore, so that might mean you have a chance with Meg, if that's what you want.",
        "Dusty: I should go.",
        "Lucy: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: Yes, yes. I'll think about it.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lucy: Hello? Oh, I wasn't expecting to hear from you today. This morning? Oh, I don't know if I can get everything in order by then. Oh, no, no. Don't, don't. If there's a shipment going out today, then I'll be there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: My little angel! You know, you gave us quite a scare there, but you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be just great. And you know why? Because Mommy's here. Mommy's here, and you know what? I will never let anything happen to you, ever. No. Yeah.",
        "[Eliza fusses]",
        "Meg: Hey, look! Daddy's here!",
        "Paul: Isn't she something?",
        "Meg: Yeah. You know, it's funny. I thought it would be weird sitting here on this couch, holding her.",
        "Paul: It isn't a little weird?",
        "Meg: No. It feels very natural. But the most important thing is that we were able to pull it together for her when she most needed us.",
        "Paul: Give her to me. I'll feed her.",
        "Meg: You sure?",
        "Paul: Yeah. You said you were tired. I got it. Look what I got for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm taking Liberty to New York so she can see there's a whole world out there that has nothing to do with Parker.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm.",
        "Craig: That is what you wanted, isn't it?",
        "Jack: Okay, yeah. It is what I want. But I also happen to love these kids, and I don't want to see either one of them get hurt.",
        "Craig: And I do?",
        "Jack: I think it's pretty clear what you want out of all this. You're using these kids to further your own agenda.",
        "Craig: I think we've all learned the hard way that it's pretty much impossible to make these kids do something they don't want to do.",
        "Jack: Yes, and you have all the answers, don't you, between the hotel rooms and this trip and agreeing to be the trustee of Parker's inheritance?",
        "Craig: And it's working. Whether you want to admit it or not, Jack, they're shutting you and Carly out, and they're letting me in.",
        "Liberty: All right. I'm ready to go!",
        "Craig: Okay, your chariot to the airport awaits.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I love riding in style! Thank you! Hey, I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Jack: Yes. Have a great time, and good luck, okay?",
        "Liberty: Thank you so much! See you soon!",
        "Jack: Bye-bye.",
        "Liberty: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I think you and Liberty can survive one night apart.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but what if she does get the internship? Then she'll be in New York for an entire summer.",
        "Carly: I'm gonna say something, and I don't want you to get upset.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Carly: You and Liberty are both very young.",
        "Parker: What does that have to do with this?",
        "Carly: Well, when you're that young, your feelings change quickly. They're supposed to. So, in a couple of months, you both could be in completely different places.",
        "Parker: So, Liberty will be in New York, and I'll be here?",
        "Carly: That's not what I mean, and you know it!",
        "Parker: Mom, you don't get it. The way I feel now is the way that I'm always gonna feel. I love Liberty, and I always will.",
        "Craig: We're back.",
        "Parker: Hey. Did you get everything?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Totally ready to go.",
        "Craig: Carly?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. I'm ready. Okay, Honey. I love you.",
        "Parker: I love you.",
        "Carly: Good luck at your tryouts, okay?",
        "Parker: Thank you.",
        "Carly: All right.",
        "Liberty: Hey, I'll be right out.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Carly: We'll be outside.",
        "Craig: See you, Parker.",
        "Parker: Bye, Craig.",
        "Liberty: See you in a minute. Come on, Parker, it's not that bad. I'm gonna be back tomorrow.",
        "Parker: All right. I just don't get why you have to go at all.",
        "Liberty: Parker, this is really important to me.",
        "Parker: I know. It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I get it. And maybe while you're there, you can scope out some cool places for us to live.",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Parker: I mean, that's if you do get the internship.",
        "Liberty: I know. God, how amazing would that be? Us two in New York for an entire summer.",
        "Parker: That's if Craig agrees to give us the money for it, but I doubt he will say no, given this was all his idea.",
        "Liberty: We'll work it out. I love you.",
        "Parker: I love you, too.",
        "Liberty: I'll see you later.",
        "Parker: All right.",
        "Liberty: Bye! Good luck.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: She fell asleep the minute I put her down.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "[Thud]",
        "[Clank]",
        "Paul: Oh, look who's up.",
        "Meg: Wow. How long have I been asleep?",
        "Paul: A couple of hours.",
        "Meg: How's Eliza?",
        "Paul: She's fine. She fell asleep right after you did, like she somehow felt that you were here.",
        "Meg: Why do you say that?",
        "Paul: Well, it's not like you've been around a lot lately, is it?",
        "Meg: Well, then, maybe I should get going while she's still asleep, and that way, if she wakes up, she won't be so confused.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Meg: You know, her antibiotics are in the diaper bag, and she'll probably need them in an hour and every four hours after that, and if her fever spikes, you remember what the doctor --",
        "Paul: I'll call the doctor. I know. Meg. Meg.",
        "Meg: Sorry. I'm doing that again. Would you mind if I came by tomorrow to check on her?",
        "Paul: Is that really necessary?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: Well -- no, not like that. It's just that the doctor said that we should keep a close eye on Eliza, and you are a nurse, so maybe you should just stay here.",
        "Meg: Do you mean that?",
        "Paul: Not -- no. This is just until Eliza gets better. This is not, like, a permanent arrangement.",
        "Meg: Yeah, obviously.",
        "Paul: Just so we're clear.",
        "Meg: I am.",
        "Paul: And I'm only doing it for Eliza.",
        "Meg: I know.",
        "Paul: Because that doesn't change anything with us.",
        "Meg: All right.",
        "Paul: It doesn't change anything with us.",
        "Meg: Right, right. Well, I'll go to the farm and pick up a few things.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey. What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: I came to check out Oakdale's version of spring training.",
        "Parker: It's not training unless I make the team. Are you checking up on me?",
        "Jack: Me? You caught me. Actually, I'm scouting for a rival school. Just don't tell anybody, okay? Parker, I'm trying. Come on.",
        "Parker: I know, I know. I just didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Jack: What do you mean? I come to all of your tryouts! I haven't missed a single one!",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, this isn't Little League anymore, Dad.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. I guess it's different in high school. If you don't want me to stick around, you want to do this on your own, I understand. I don't want to be a distraction. I know it's important to you.",
        "Parker: Kind of.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but I want you to promise me -- promise me you'll tell me how it goes.",
        "Parker: I will.",
        "Jack: All right. And watch out for Lamson's --",
        "Parker: His curveball. I know. You tell me every year.",
        "Jack: I tell you because I know. It's a beast. Listen, I know you're gonna be on your own tonight with Liberty and your mom in New York, so, if you need anything, just give me a call, okay? I'll be around.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Jack: Good luck.",
        "Parker: Hey, Dad?",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Jack: You're welcome.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder. Hey, Margo. What's up? Actually, I'm not due in for another hour or so. Smuggling ring. Yeah, Dallas said something about that. Well, as it turns out, I'm not too far away from the dock now, so I'll go check it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Is this it?",
        "Craig: Sure is. What do you think?",
        "Liberty: I'm officially intimidated by a building.",
        "Carly: Don't worry, Honey. You're gonna be great. I know it.",
        "Liberty: That's easy for you to say.",
        "Carly: Do you know how many times I've been right where you are right now with my portfolio, waiting to go into a meeting, terrified out of my mind?",
        "Liberty: My guess is at least once.",
        "Carly: More than once, and every single time, do you know what I realized?",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Carly: That the people I was meeting, Honey, they're just people!",
        "Liberty: Why don't they just tell you that up front?",
        "[All laugh]",
        "Carly: Don't worry. I'm sure they're just as excited to meet you.",
        "Craig: Especially considering the source of your recommendation.",
        "Carly: Yes. You see, the meeting's not even about you. It's really just about Craig.",
        "Liberty: Well, he was nice enough to get me the meeting, and I really can never thank you enough for that.",
        "Craig: There's no need to thank me. It was my pleasure.",
        "Liberty: I just hope I don't embarrass you, or me.",
        "Craig: That's impossible! Would you like me to go in with you?",
        "Liberty: No. I'd rather go in on my own so that I can pass out in private.",
        "Carly: Liberty, don't be nervous. You're gonna be great.",
        "Liberty: Thank you. Wish me luck, guys.",
        "Craig: Good luck, and we'll be right here when you're done.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Carly: Okay, you can wipe that smile off your face.",
        "Craig: What? I'm proud of Liberty! This is a big step for her!",
        "Carly: Well, what if she actually gets this internship?",
        "Craig: Isn't that what we wanted?",
        "Carly: Well, it's not what we want, and that's why I'm so skeptical.",
        "Craig: You need to have a little faith, Carly.",
        "Carly: You just don't get it, do you?",
        "Craig: Get what?",
        "Carly: This internship may not be the answers to our problems. You know, it could potentially make things much worse.",
        "Craig: How so?",
        "Carly: Look, you managed to convince them to come and live with me, and for that, I am eternally grateful to you.",
        "Craig: And is there nothing more attractive than a woman who is eternally grateful?",
        "Carly: Just let me finish, okay? I'm not thrilled about their marriage, but at least if they're under my roof, I can keep an eye on things.",
        "Craig: Right.",
        "Carly: But if Liberty gets this internship and the kids come to New York for the summer, I won't be able to keep an eye on anything.",
        "Craig: You know what you need to do, Carly, right now?",
        "Carly: Do tell.",
        "Craig: Put yourself into my very capable hands.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: So, these were delivered in time?",
        "Cesar: I'm glad your contact was able to reach you. When I heard about a last- minute shipment --",
        "Lucy: It was tight. I know. You think you'll be able to get these on the ship?",
        "Cesar: That's what you and your friend are paying me for. I'll get started now.",
        "Lucy: Okay. And you'll get your payment as soon as they're delivered.",
        "Jack: Lucy, what are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I heard about Eliza. Is she all right?",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah. She's -- she's good. She's doing much better.",
        "Dusty: Is she still at the hospital?",
        "Meg: No. No. They released her this morning.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Dusty: She's back at Fairwinds with Paul?",
        "Meg: He has custody.",
        "Dusty: How are you?",
        "Meg: I'm fine.",
        "Dusty: Anything I can do to help?",
        "Meg: No. You know what? I'm sorry. This really isn't a good time.",
        "Dusty: I got you into this mess. Paul should not have custody of your daughter.",
