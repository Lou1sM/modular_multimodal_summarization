        "Jack: All we have to do is find out who walked in during Julia's call to the pharmacy and we'll probably know who murdered her.",
        "Lily: But she was alive when I left her. I told you that, Jack. And that's what Carly said, too.",
        "Jack: Sure looks that way.",
        "Lily: So you believe me? You think someone else is the killer?",
        "Jack: The pharmacist doesn't have any reason to lie about his conversation with Julia, and since we know the exact time of the phone call, we also know that you weren't there.",
        "Keith: Well, somebody interrupted that call. And somebody was there and killed my sister.",
        "Lily: And Tom said he cannot reopen the case without new evidence. Does this qualify?",
        "Jack: I'll tell him what we've found out and maybe he can do something about getting you out of here, okay?",
        "Lily: From your mouth to God's ears. Yes.",
        "Jack: You hang in there, all right?",
        "Lily: Thanks. I can't almost believe this. We're finally going to find out who murdered your sister.",
        "Keith: Let's hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: What is that smile for?",
        "Alison: Oh, you know, just managed to do the impossible.",
        "Aaron: And that would be?",
        "Alison: Got Will to actually listen and take some advice.",
        "Aaron: Whoa. The guardian angel for the teenage crowd is earning her little wings. Wow. I just hope they see this and they know what you're doing for them.",
        "Alison: Well, it's never too soon to develop some good maternal skills for later on. And besides, if I keep them happy and occupied and out of trouble, it'll make your life easier, which will make you happier, which will make my life happier. See, it's all for you, sugar pie.",
        "Waiter: Hey, sorry to bust up the party, but the phone's for you. He said it was urgent.",
        "Aaron: Aaron speaking. Dad? That is so weird. I was just about to call --",
        "Alison: Holden? Holden? Seattle dad?",
        "Aaron: When did this start? What are you saying? All right, is there anything I can do? Okay. Well, is she going to be okay? I mean, just tell her that I love her -- tell her that I love her and that I'm thinking about her. And keep me posted, please. Okay. Yeah, me, too. All right, bye.",
        "Alison: What happened?",
        "Aaron: My mom is in the hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You really think Jennifer would terminate this pregnancy without telling Mike or Craig?",
        "Henry: I have no idea. But she certainly didn't want me knowing that she was going to a family planning center.",
        "Katie: Well, like I said before, it's her decision and we're staying out of it.",
        "Henry: Whoa. Are you -- are you feeling okay there, sweetheart? Because normally --",
        "Katie: This is serious, Henry.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Katie: This is Jennifer's body. If she's pregnant, then everything's going to change, and she and Mike have a lot to think about.",
        "Henry: You are 100% correct. You really are. You're not the least bit curious at all?",
        "Katie: Of course I am. I'm dying to know what's happening. I'm dying to know everything, but this is a right that Jennifer has to make this decision without anybody adding their two cents or trying to make it for her.",
        "Henry: Absolutely.",
        "Katie: That's a right every woman holds dear to her heart. So we are just going to let Jennifer decide what's best her and Mike and her future. Even though we are used to medaling until we find our answers, we're just going to leave Jennifer alone for once.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Yes, I'm trying to locate the driver who picked up my daughter this morning. Her name is Jennifer Munson. So, if you just put me in contact with the chauffeur who picked her up so I know where he dropped her off -- don't give me company policy. This is a family emergency. I want to know where my daughter -- hello? Hello? Where is she?",
        "Craig: Did you forget your medication again?",
        "Barbara: Oh, you're not going to get away with this, not this time. No.",
        "Craig: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Barbara: You know where my daughter is and if you've harmed one hair on her head --",
        "Craig: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Barbara: Tell me where Jennifer is.",
        "Craig: I don't know. But, based on your history, I'm guessing about as far away from you as her legs will take her.",
        "Barbara: I've got to go.",
        "Craig: Hold it, hold it, hold it. She in trouble? She in trouble? Because if she is, maybe I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bev: We're ready for you, Miss Munson.",
        "Jennifer: Um, did you find out if I could have the procedure done today?",
        "Bev: Oh, Dr. Martin said she'd consider it after we had our counseling session.",
        "Mike: What are you doing here? Are you really pregnant?",
        "Jennifer: Um, I'm sorry. Could we have a moment?",
        "Bev: Is everything all right?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, -- yeah. Fine, thank you.",
        "Bev: I'll come back, then.",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing here? How did you --",
        "Mike: Barbara showed up at the cottage with a baby gift. And I'm thinking, \"Who's having a baby? What baby?\" You know, then I found this ad for this clinic. Is there something you want to tell me?",
        "Jennifer: Telling you is the last thing I wanted to do. I kept telling myself that if i -- as long as I didn't say it out loud, then it wouldn't be true. No one would know and it wouldn't be true. But it is true. I'm pregnant.",
        "Mike: I figured out that much. What I can't figure out is what you're doing here. All right, why aren't we home celebrating?",
        "Jennifer: Because it isn't your baby, Mike.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: How can you be sure it's not mine?",
        "Jennifer: The due date. It was conceived when things were rocky between us, around the time that Craig -- I am carrying Craig Montgomery's child and I just want this all to go away, so, please, can you just leave me alone and please let me do this? Please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: This is incredible. I might actually get to go home.",
        "Keith: I know. I know how anxious you are to see your kids and everything.",
        "Lily: It's all I've been thinking about. All the milestones that I would miss -- birthdays, the proms, first dates and weddings, and now I finally see a way out, thanks to you.",
        "Keith: Well, you know, don't thank me just yet. You know, we've still got a few things to take care of here. We're not quite out of the woods.",
        "Lily: I know, but there's hope. I haven't had hope is such a long time.",
        "Keith: All right, come on. Come on. Come on now. Everything's going to be okay.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Keith: No, no, no. You don't have to apologize. You know, you were just doing it to protect your son. You know, you were willing to go to jail for that. That's -- that tell me a lot. I mean, you're a very brave girl.",
        "Lily: Brave. Crazy.",
        "Keith: Well, you know, it's a good combination, both of those. Now, listen, you will get through this.",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Lily: I don't believe this, but I might actually be going home.",
        "Holden: Home?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Holden: What happened?",
        "Lily: Jack, he went over the phone records again and saw that Julia made a phone call to some unknown person after I left her in the apartment.",
        "Keith: The time of the call was in the records.",
        "Lily: And I was with Carly at that time. So she can testify to that.",
        "Keith: Right, so if Julia was able to make the call, then Lily couldn't have killed her. Therefore, somebody else did it.",
        "Holden: This is great news. That's the best news that I've heard in a very long time.",
        "Jack: Lily tell you the latest?",
        "Tom: Yeah, yeah. That we may have a new suspect, whomever that might be.",
        "Holden: So, does this mean that she can go home?",
        "Tom: No, I'm afraid not. There are still some questions that need to be cleared up.",
        "Lily: Such as?",
        "Tom: How do you explain the note that Keith found? The one that you wrote to Julia, threatening to kill her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Well, I am proud of you, bubbles. Ignoring your baser instincts to meddle and intervene. Two of the qualities that I love most about you.",
        "Henry: I just hope that, you know, everyone's as noble as you are. I mean, the last thing Jennifer needs right now is a bunch of nosy people horning in on something so private.",
        "Katie: That being said, there is one little, tiny detail that is driving me crazy.",
        "Henry: I thought so, which part?",
        "Katie: The more I think about all this secrecy, the more I think that maybe Craig is the father.",
        "Henry: If, if, if, if she's pregnant, which we don't know for sure. And, you know what? Why even dwell on it anyway since we both agree that this is Jennifer's affair. Business decision -- decision.",
        "Katie: But if the baby is Craig's, don't you think he at least has the right to know?",
        "Henry: Absolutely and unequivocally, no.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: My daughter is not your concern.",
        "Craig: Why not?",
        "Barbara: You made her life a living hell.",
        "Craig: Blah, blah, blah. I was at the trunk show, she had a lot more on her mind than business and she didn't look very well.",
        "Barbara: Would you please just get out of my way?",
        "Craig: Don't you think you owe it to your daughter and her company to tell me what is wrong?",
        "Barbara: Why? So you can take advantage?",
        "Craig: No, I don't need an advantage. I have the drop on \"Street Jeans\" already. I'm going to undercut their retail sales by half, and corner the Asian retail market by the end of the month. But if something is wrong with Jennifer and she cannot compete, I want to know. I enjoy my little rivalries.",
        "Barbara: You can't even begin to compete with Jennifer, or any other company when you don't even have a designer on staff. Trust me, Craig, you will never again get your hands on anything that my daughter's has created. So I wouldn't be too cocky if I were you. You may think you're on top now, but it's not going to last. And no one will enjoy watching you crash and burn more than Jennifer. And me.",
        "Craig: Hmm. Well, there's one person who can help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Say something, please.",
        "Mike: I just wish you would have trusted me enough to tell",
        "Jennifer: I trust you more than anyone. And I wanted to tell you. I wanted to tell you last night, but you were just -- you were so sweet and so forgiving about all my mistakes. And I just didn't want to see the look in your eyes that I see right now. I didn't want to break your heart. I didn't want to lose you. And I didn't want it to be true. So, I told myself there was only one thing I could do is come here, get help, and get back to my life with you.",
        "Mike: It's not that simple.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it's why I'm here! Because I am tired of hurting you! I'm sick to death of it! So if I can just make this all go away, then that's all I care about. So please, can you please just let me do this?",
        "Mike: No, no, you know what? Don't think about me. Because the only thing that's important right now, is that baby. It's the only thing that matters. You need to make sure this is what you want.",
        "Jennifer: I was sure about it last night, and I was sure about when I walked in that door --",
        "Mike: You don't make a decision like this in one night. Please, please, take your time, and think it all through. Because the last thing that you want to do is make another decision that you're going to regret for the rest of your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I need to know how Keith came to be in possession of the letter.",
        "Holden: The letter, it was just a bunch of words. It doesn't proof anything.",
        "Tom: It proves intent.",
        "Holden: Maybe, but isn't it enough to know that Julia was alive when Lily left her apartment?",
        "Tom: The letter indicates premeditation. Add that to Lily's confession, we can't just sweep that under the rug. Can we? Unless Lily would like to explain to me why I shouldn't consider it.",
        "Keith: I planted the evidence. After she showed it to me, I though it would bolster her confession, so I told Jack I found it at the scene of the crime.",
        "Jack: And the whole time you were committing a crime of your own, weren't you?",
        "Lily: No, don't blame Keith. It's not his fault. I confessed. I forced his hand.",
        "Holden: How did you do that?",
        "Lily: I told him that I would confess to killing Julia if he told the police that he found the letter. He didn't know I was lying to protect Luke, and he didn't know that the letter was a lie either.",
        "Tom: Then you're both guilty of tampering with evidence, and that's a felony. I'll have to bring those charges against you both for that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I'm so sorry about your mom, do they know what's wrong?",
        "Aaron: Caleb just said she wasn't feeling well. She's been losing a lot of weight, so she checked into a hospital for some test. They still don't know why she's sick.",
        "Alison: And how's he taking it?",
        "Aaron: He said he's okay, but I could tell he was pretty shook up.",
        "Alison: Poor guy, that's awful. At least they're doing tests, I mean, she's in the best place she could be.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I know, Ali, I have that in my head, too --",
        "Alison: I know. Sometimes, it feels like everything bad happens at once.",
        "Aaron: You know, Holden's trying to get Lily out of jail. Luke, Faith and Natalie need me more than ever and now I've got trouble back home in Seattle.",
        "Alison: Well, what can I do?",
        "Aaron: I've been thinking about things I haven't done yet.",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Aaron: Alison, I haven't been home in years. And if I talk to my parents, it's only because they call me.",
        "Alison: Well, okay, so get your mom's number at the hospital and call her right now.",
        "Aaron: And say what?",
        "Allison: Tell her that you love her. Tell her you miss her. Tell her you're sorry.",
        "Aaron: You know what? She probably doesn't even want to hear from me. And I don't blame her one bit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: If you tell Craig that there is even a possibility that Jennifer is carrying his child, you know exactly what he'll do.",
        "Katie: He'll make it about him.",
        "Henry: Right. Of course. He'll insist on getting involved. And then before know it, he will destroy any chance that mike and Jennifer have of patching things up and moving on with their lives. Now, if it is her decision what to do with her body, then it's her decision about whom she tells the truth to. Whatever that truth may be.",
        "Katie: But he is my brother.",
        "Henry: And Mike is your friend. And he loves Jennifer. They're working things out, so they can be as happy as we are. Now, don't take that chance away from them.",
        "Katie: I know. It's just that this baby could very well be part of my family. How can I just completely turn my back on that?",
        "Henry: It not your decision.",
        "Katie: Craig has already lost so much with Bryant and Cabot. And now Lucy's away at college --",
        "Henry: Stop it. What's that? What is that? You telling me that Craig deserves to be nominated for Dad of the decade now, come on?",
        "Katie: No, of course not.",
        "Henry: Well, I mean, he has destroyed just about every woman who has had the misfortune to cross his path. Do you really want to give him the opportunity to corrupt yet another human being?",
        "Katie: All I'm saying is that I think he at least has the right to know.",
        "Craig: Oh, there's my highly aerobicized little sister. Just the one I wanted to see.",
        "Katie: Craig, what are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Can't I just pop in for a visit?",
        "Henry: Actually, Craig, we were in the middle of something right now. Business. As to how to mind one's own, not get involved in other people's --",
        "Craig: Oh, you must be talking about Jennifer. It's a shame about her, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I'm so sorry, mike. I really am. I've just ruined everything.",
        "Mike: No, you haven't. As long as you can find some way to put what happened with Craig past you and figure out what's next. What you want.",
        "Jennifer: I wish it were all about what I wanted. But it's weird, you know? Because I can feel it. This life inside me. I can feel it, even now. You know, and all the changes, I'm so tempted to give in to them.",
        "Mike: So what does that tell you?",
        "Jennifer: It tells me that if I wait any longer, I don't know if I'll be able to go through with this. I'm just scared that these feeling will dictate my decision. And then what?",
        "Barbara: Jennifer?",
        "Mike: This is none of your business.",
        "Barbara: My little girl is carrying my first grandchild. So, I'm sorry, Mike, but that absolutely makes this my business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns --\"",
        "Barbara: You two should be ecstatic. You should be over the moon --",
        "Jennifer: This isn't Mike's baby. Okay? Do you understand now?",
        "Lily: All that I can say is that I didn't do it, that I wasn't the one that killed her. I feel like I have a second chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: How did you find me?",
        "Barbara: That's not important right now, honey. I know you're upset. And I know you're worried. I just don't want you to do anything that's drastic. That you're going to regret later on. You two love each other.",
        "Mike: This is Jennifer's decision, not yours or anyone else's.",
        "Barbara: Honey -- I know that we've had our differences in the past, and I regret all of it more than you'll ever know. But I'm still your mother. And whether you realize it or not, you need me right now.",
        "Mike: Let's give Jen some space. I'll take you out to your car.",
        "Barbara: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Jennifer: Just forget about it, Mike. Just let her stay. She may as well know the truth.",
        "Barbara: The truth? Honey, what is it? Honey, if something's wrong, tell me and maybe I can make things better.",
        "Jennifer: No, you can't make this better, Mom.",
        "Barbara: You look so bleak. Must be the hormones kicking in already. You two should be ecstatic. You should be over the moon -- what's wrong? What's the problem? I don't understand.",
        "Jennifer: This isn't Mike's baby. Okay? Do you understand now?",
        "Barbara: No, I don't understand. If it's not Mike's, whose baby is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Jennifer? What about Jennifer?",
        "Katie: Is there something we should know?",
        "Craig: Well, I though Mike would have said something.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Craig: Well, no, no, no, forget it. Forget it. Obviously, they're keeping it a private matter.",
        "Katie: Who?",
        "Craig: No, no, no, never mind. Never mind. I'd better skedaddle before I say too much. It was good seeing you.",
        "Katie: Who told you about Jennifer?",
        "Craig: Well, I'm not going to name names.",
        "Katie: How much do you know?",
        "Craig: Well, I certainly know enough.",
        "Henry: Well, maybe what you know and what your brother knows are two completely different things. So, let's just stop the conversation right before we confuse the issue.",
        "Craig: Henry, I just want to make sure my sister is okay with everything that's happened.",
        "Henry: Why wouldn't she be, Craig?",
        "Craig: Henry? Katie, do you feel like sharing?",
        "Katie: Well, actually --",
        "Henry: No, you know what? No, no, don't say anything.",
        "Craig: Henry, stay out of this, please?",
        "Henry: Take a good look at him here, he's bluffing. He doesn't anything about Jennifer, and all he's trying to do is trick you into saying something.",
        "Katie: Craig? Is that true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You have to stop feeling so guilty about this. You left home with your family's blessing because things weren't going well between you guys. Am I right?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. I mean, Caleb and Julie were fighting a lot, and I felt like I was in the way. But they fixed things, like, a long time ago.",
        "Alison: Which would never have happened if you hadn't come here?",
        "Aaron: Well, maybe. But, I mean, after they got things on solid ground again, I could have gone back home.",
        "Alison: Did they ask you to?",
        "Aaron: No. Alison, you don't understand. I haven't gone back for holidays, birthdays, anything.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but you have a ton of stuff here. You have a family who needs you. A kid brother and sisters. A job. Friends. Me.",
        "Aaron: Thank God for you.",
        "Alison: You have no idea what you mean to all of us. What would we do without you?",
        "Aaron: I know, Alison, but my mom --",
        "Alison: Your mom is so proud of everything that you've accomplished. Of all people who love you and depend on you. And I know that she'd be happy to see the man that you've become. Doesn't matter how long it's been, that's how moms are. In fact, you know what?",
        "Aaron: What?",
        "Alison: You're probably just the medicine she needs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I'm sorry. I know you were hoping for an early release, but we have to deal with these new charges.",
        "Holden: So if you can't convict her of murder, you'll go after her for trying to protect our son?",
        "Tom: Lily and Keith just stood here and confessed to planting fraudulent evidence. Why don't you tell them what that means, Jack?",
        "Jack: It's a class five felony, punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years.",
        "Holden: You can't send her to prison over this.",
        "Tom: I don't write the law. I represent it, but I can't make this go away.",
        "Lily: Not even if you want to?",
        "Tom: There have been more than enough improprieties, wouldn't you say? There are other people in the D.A.'s office, the state's attorney's office, and the media. They're watching this case closely, and I have to answer to them.",
        "Jack: Can I talk to you outside for a second?",
        "Tom: Sure. Excuse us.",
        "Holden: I guess I owe you an apology.",
        "Keith: No, all that matters right now is finding out who really killed Julia, and getting Lily home so she can be with her kids.",
        "Jack: What if I had one of my guy's in the lab take a look at that letter Lily wrote? If he concludes it's a forgery, we could get it tossed out as evidence.",
        "Tom: Enough crimes have been committed, Jack.",
        "Jack: Tom, it's time to make things right. We both know that the real crime here would be putting Lily behind bars. She did what she did because she loves her son to much, she doesn't want to see him suffer. Parents do that.",
        "Tom: Not all parents.",
        "Jack: Hey, if Casey was in same situation as Luke, you have no idea what you'd do. Ease up, Tom. Please. Let the punishment fit the crime.",
        "Tom: So you want the D.A. to break the law?",
        "Jack: No, I want my friend to let Lily go home and see her kids. I'm not saying what she did was right. But you don't want to pursue these charges any more than I do. Let's bury the letter, and let Lily get on with her life.",

        "Jennifer: This is Craig's baby.",
        "Barbara: Craig's? Oh, God, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: Do you get it now? Do you see why I'm here?",
        "Barbara: How could that animal force himself on you?",
        "Jennifer: No, Mom, it wasn't like that.",
        "Barbara: Oh, no, I'm sure he tried to whitewash this, that he couldn't help himself. That he didn't know what he was doing. But you know what, honey? We'll make him pay for this. I promise you. You don't worry about a thing. Then we'll call your father and we'll put this --",
        "Jennifer: Mom, would you just be quiet and listen for one minute? It wasn't rape!",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Jennifer: It was consensual, okay? One messed up night when I was very unhappy. And I still don't understand how I let it happen, but I did, and I have to take responsibility.",
        "Barbara: How could you let that man put his hands on you?",
        "Mike: That's enough.",
        "Barbara: He destroyed our family!",
        "Jennifer: That's why I'm here! I don't want any part of him.",
        "Barbara: He's Bryant's father!",
        "Jennifer: Oh, stop it. You can't make me feel worse than I already do.",
        "Barbara: He stole your designs and your staff. He is trying to destroy your company!",
        "Mike: Hey, she made a mistake. She made a mistake and she regrets it! What's done is done, okay? You're not making things any better here.",
        "Barbara: You knew about this?",
        "Mike: Yeah. And we're trying to work things out, but its a little bit hard when you keep showing up where you don't belong. So if you really care about your daughter like you say you do, then you will let her deal with this and stop interfering.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry, honey. It's the shock of it. I'm not blaming you --",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, right.",
        "Barbara: I'm not. I'm not, Jen. And I swear to you, I won't tell anyone about you and what happened with Craig. Mike said it -- \"what's done is done.\" And now, we have to focus on what's important.",
        "Jennifer: Do you really mean that?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I do. We have to focus on this baby. This child growing inside of you. That's the most important thing right now.",
        "Mike: That's why I was telling Jennifer that she needs to take her time with this.",
        "Jennifer: And I know you were only looking out for me when you said that, but I could think about this for days and I still wouldn't change my mind. I'm ending this before it's too late.",
        "Barbara: No. You can't do that. I won't let you.",

        "Henry: He's on a fishing expedition. He doesn't know a thing.",
        "Craig: Henry, this is between me and my sister. Now, do you want to tell me what you were going to tell me before we were so rudely interrupted?",
        "Henry: You know, I got a better idea, Craig. If you really know what's going on, why don't you tell us?",
        "Craig: All right. The truth is, I don't know exactly, but I have been getting some particularly weird vibes from Jennifer recently.",
        "Katie: What kind of vibes?",
        "Craig: Well, there was a trunk show with some very important buyers. And she should have been working it for all she was worth, but she walked out. I tried to find out why, but Dusty, her father and brother all rushed a little too quickly to her defense. And now, everybody's silent. Even BarBar, who can't shut her mouth for anything.",
        "Katie: You couldn't get any information out of them, so you thought you'd just come trick it out of me?",
        "Craig: If Jennifer is sick, or she's having some kind of a breakdown or there is some other problem, I think I deserve to know. I worked with her for a very long time. I care about what happens to her.",
        "Henry: Don't -- don't listen to him, please? Don't listen to him. He doesn't give a damn about Jennifer.",
        "Craig: Stay out of this, Henry!",
        "Katie: Don't talk to him like that!",
        "Craig: It's Henry.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and he's my husband. So you shut up and apologize.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How'd it go? Did you get Tom to drop the new charges?",
        "Jack: I tried. No go.",
        "Lily: I was afraid you would say that.",
        "Jack: Once the murder charges are gone, there's still a chance you can get out on bail.",
        "Holden: Should I call Jess?",
        "Jack: Definitely. Once she gets the judge's approval, we can at least get you out of here for a while.",
        "Keith: Hey, you got a minute, Jack?",
        "Jack: Step into my office.",
        "Holden: So how do you feel?",
        "Lily: I can't stop thinking about just going home and seeing my babies.",
        "Holden: They're going to be very excited to see you.",
        "Lily: I'm going to read them stories. I want to just hug them and -- I want to wake up to Faith jumping on my bed.",
        "Holden: I'm sure she'll deliver on that.",
        "Lily: Do a midnight run at the refrigerator with Luke, and -- sit across from the table from him and just talk about his day. Ever since Julia died, I have not had one moment of peace. But now that I can say that I didn't do it, that I wasn't the one that killed her, I feel like I have a second chance.",
        "Cop: This fax just came through.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Keith: Is that about Julia's case?",
        "Jack: The incoming calls of Julia's cell phone on the night she was murdered. Check this out. This number here. Look at the time. Somebody called her just before she made that call to the pharmacy.",
        "Keith: Well, where it originate from?",
        "Jack: Looks like a pay phone exchange. So someone could've called her from a phone booth somewhere, then showed up and killed her. I think we have a new lead on a new suspect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I understand what you feel about Craig. No one knows more than I what a loathsome human being he is. But don't punish this baby because of it. Don't punish this baby because of who its father is. Bring this child into the world. I beg you, Jen.",
        "Mike: Barbara, that's enough. I am not going to tell you again.",
        "Barbara: This is between my daughter and me. Mother to mother.",
        "Jennifer: All right, I am not a mother unless I choose to be. This is not the right time or the right situation!",
        "Barbara: It's a baby! Your baby. Will and Paul's little niece or little nephew. My grandchild.",
        "Jennifer: Would you stop making this about you!",
        "Barbara: It's about all of us, Jen. This baby is our blood. It's a new life. A brand new chance for all of us. Maybe it'll finally bring us all together. You've gotta think about what's it's going to be like when they finally put that little baby in your arms and you look down into its eyes and you realize that you've been lucky enough to have been given a miracle.",
        "Jennifer: You don't know. You don't know what this feels like.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes I do. And I know how frightened you are. But you have me and you have your brothers and you have your father, and we will all be there for you, Jen. I can guarantee you that. And I will promise you one more thing -- that if you end this pregnancy because of Craig, you will always regret it. You will always wonder. You'll always wonder about what this baby could've accomplished. What she would have looked like, what joy she would've brought to you.",
        "Jennifer: She?",
        "Barbara: I must have been remembering what it was like when I was pregnant with you. I was frightened, too. And I knew your natural father was not going to be a part of my life, or yours. And so I had to make a very difficult decision. And I am so glad that I didn't give you up.",
        "Jennifer: Please, Mom, this is not fair.",
        "Barbara: I have never regretted one moment, jen. Not one moment of being your mother. But I'm worried -- I'm worried about you if you make this decision, because every time you see a child that would've been about your baby's age you will wonder. You'll wonder about what could have been. And you'll think about this conversation, and about this decision that you made so hastily. And you will hate yourself.",
        "Jennifer: Get out. Get out. I mean it! I can't stand any more of this!",
        "Barbara: I'm trying to help you --",
        "Jennifer: Would you just go! I can't stand it!",

        "Lily: I can't believe how excited I am to go home and make dinner. And after the girls are in bed, and I've kissed them as much as they can stand it, I am going to draw myself the longest bubble bath known to man.",
        "Holden: That's going to feel good.",
        "Lily: Nothing's going to feel as good as being with my children every day. I was so afraid I wouldn't be there to watch them grow up.",
        "Holden: They've missed you. It's a good thing you're going home.",
        "Luke: That's all you have to say? I thought you'd be shocked she didn't do it, but this looks like you're disappointed. Am I close, Dad?",

        "Alison: Go back to the apartment, throw some things in a suitcase, and jump on a plane to Seattle.",
        "Aaron: I don't know, Ali. I should probably wait.",
        "Alison: For what?",
        "Aaron: If I show up at my mother's hospital bed just out of the blue, she's going to think that something's wrong. I haven't been home in so long, if I show up, she's going to think she's terminal or something.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but your mom loves you. That's why your dad called, not because they want you to stay away. They want you there with them.",
        "Aaron: You think?",
        "Alison: Nobody will think that the sky's falling if you walk through that door. Two minutes after you get there, it'll be like no time has passed. I promise. Go home to Seattle.",
        "Aaron: You're right. You're right. I need to see them just as much as they need to see me. But what about Metro --",
        "Alison: Oh, don't worry about Metro. I can take care of this place for a few days. And don't worry Lily or Holden or the kids or me. We can take care of ourselves for a while. And we'll be right here when you get back, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I'm serious, Craig. Apologize to my husband, or you can forget finding out what I know about Jennifer.",
        "Craig: All right, Henry. I apologize. I did not come here to lash out.",
        "Henry: Well, that was very sincere.",
        "Craig: All right, I did what you asked. Now, are you going to fill me in on what am I missing?",
        "Henry: A heart, a soul, a moral compass. Did I mention a heart?",
        "Craig: I apologized, and now I get insulted? This must be quite a revelation. All right, let's hear it.",
        "Henry: Katie, Katie? Think about this, all right? Do you really want Craig to have this information?",
        "Katie: Well, I -- I said I was going to tell him, and I will. Jennifer and Mike are having problems. Jennifer's a wreck, and it looks like they are on the verge of breaking up.",
        "Henry: Oh, Katie! I cannot believe you did that, that you went and told him that.",
        "Katie: I'm just trying to do what's right.",

        "Katie: Well, that's all there is, Craig. That's all there is to know.",
        "Craig: Uh-huh. And there's nothing else you want to tell me?",
        "Katie: No. I'm sorry that I couldn't give you what you wanted.",

        "Henry: Always a pleasure. [Craig chuckles] you. Bubbles? Well, I just, I fell in love with you all over again. The way you lied and denied there, that was pure, vintage Peretti.",
        "Katie: Not too shabby, huh?",
        "Henry: Not too shabby? You had me going there for a little bit. I thought for sure you were going to spill the beans.",
        "Katie: Well, I was going to tell him about the baby. But when he came in here and tried to trick it out of me, I just decided not to.",
        "Henry: Well, you made the right decision. You know? It's Jennifer and Mike's choice. And if they want to say anything, let them -- if there is anything to say.",

        "Mike: Hey, hey, whatever you decide to do is going to be the right thing for you. Let me take you home. We'll talk it out, and then you can figure out what you want to do. Then if you decide that you want to terminate the pregnancy, that's what you'll do. All right, but don't tell me not to be nice to you, because I don't know how to do that. All I want to do is take care of you. Okay?",

And I love this child that's inside you. Don't let Craig destroy this baby, Jen. You can do this. You can have this baby and Craig never has to know it's his.",
