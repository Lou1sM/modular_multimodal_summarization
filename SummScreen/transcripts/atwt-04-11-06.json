    "Transcript": [
        "Lucinda: We invited our mysterious author to step forward, but let me first share something with you. I have myself have no idea who it will be. I, too, have been kept in the dark. I've heard a lot of buzz around this party about certain people, but that's because their pictures are on the cover of the book. But they're only characters, mere character in the book, points of view from which this juicy story is being told. Don't jump to any conclusions. No. Okay. Is the suspense killing you? Because it's killing me. So, as it plays, I happen to know on good authority that the author is in our company here today, so if he or she would like to put us out of our misery, now's the time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What are you doing here? Do you know what a risk you took? You know how lucky you are there was no one on the elevator?",
        "Paul: I'm a lucky guy.",
        "Meg: If anybody had seen you and told Emily --",
        "Paul: I had to get this to you.",
        "Meg: You got it back? When?",
        "Paul: After you left. Then Jennifer showed up, and driving her home is a perfect excuse for me to bring it to you. I've already been gone too long.",
        "Meg: Leave it with me and go.",
        "Paul: We can't do that. What if Emily looks for it, and it's missing? She caught me once, she'll know I have it.",
        "Meg: But this could be the one thing that leads us to Dusty. You can't just take it back.",
        "Paul: I know, so we have to think of something fast. If Emily shows up here and finds out I'm not with Jennifer --",
        "Meg: She'll shoot you again?",
        "Paul: One thing I've learned, you cross that woman, be prepared to die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I bet you didn't even leave me a goodbye note, did you?",
        "Dusty: My leg.",
        "Emily: Oh, wow, that's a real mess, isn't it? If I don't do something about it, you'll bleed to death right here. Dusty? Dusty! Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Will the brilliant author come forward and take a bow? Here's your chance. Going once --",
        "Margo: Here's your chance, be a star. It must be killing you not to take credit.",
        "Mike: What's the matter? Is it only fun trashing people if you can hide?",
        "Lucinda: Going twice --",
        "Jack: You might as well take your applause. You've already told the whole town our business.",
        "Carly: I did no such thing.",
        "Lucinda: Gone. I guess anonymous wishes to stay exactly that. So the rest of us have no choice but to pore over the book looking for clues. And make sure copies of it go to all your friends so they can join in the mystery. On sale right over there and enjoy the rest of the party.",
        "Carly: How can you think I'd do something like this?",
        "Jack: Like what? Expose our lives all over town? Humiliate me in front of everybody I work with and never tell me what's going on? Yeah, why would i think you could do something like that?",
        "Katie: What makes you so sure that it was me?",
        "Margo: It just smells right.",
        "Katie: Don't go cop on me.",
        "Margo: What did Mike think?",
        "Katie: Mike thinks Maddie wrote it.",
        "Kim: You think Katie is our author?",
        "Margo: She seems to think it was Mad Avenue Maddie but I don't see how it could be. The girl's been in town less than a year. She couldn't possibly know so much Oakdale history.",
        "Kim: Oh yes she could.",
        "Nancy: Margo, did you read page 32 yet? You're in for a surprise.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, not me.",
        "Mike: Come clean right now.",
        "Maddie: Mike, I didn't do anything.",
        "Casey: Hey. What's up?",
        "Mike: Just congratulating Maddie on this fine piece of work.",
        "Casey: It's awesome, right? She didn't even let on that she was writing this until tonight.",
        "Maddie: I wasn't serious.",
        "Casey: You lied?",
        "Maddie: More like you assumed.",
        "Mike: See how complicated it's already getting? Admit it, Maddie.",
        "Katie: Let's go, hon.",
        "Mike: No, wait. You know when Mad Avenue finally owned up about B.J. Green, you said she'd learned her lesson. I told you she'd just land in more trouble and take somebody else down with her.",
        "Maddie: I did learn my lesson. And even if I hadn't, how could I write this? I don't know half these people.",
        "Katie: She's right, Mike.",
        "Kim: You really are a sly boots, aren't you? When you said you were doing research, I thought it was for a school project.",
        "Mike: Research. What research?",
        "Maddie: It was for school.",
        "Kim: Maddie's been looking at archive tapes at WOAK for months now. And it was for a term paper. But you're full of surprises, aren't, you, missy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know this is a long shot.",
        "Meg: It's the only possibility connection we have to Dusty. If you're so sure it was a bust, why did you even bother?",
        "Paul: Because I wanted to come here and see you. Jennifer told me you were in the hallway outside my apartment.",
        "Meg: I hadn't had time to get away yet.",
        "Paul: So you heard what Jen heard, commotion inside, me and emily?",
        "Meg: Yeah, that's how i got away. Jen brought I was peace offering. That's ga sign, progress.",
        "Paul: Maybe, or maybe she's trying to get information out of him.",
        "Meg: You think?",
        "Paul: There's no way after all the things that I've done she could forgive me. Not yet. She thinks I have Dusty.",
        "Meg: Tell her what we suspect.",
        "Paul: I can't do that. If she ever went straight at Emily, God forbid --",
        "Meg: That would be bad.",
        "Paul: No telling what she could do. Emily has to believe that I am on her side completely.",
        "Meg: From what I've seen and heard so far, you're pretty convincing.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: About what?",
        "Paul: For what you seen and heard.",
        "Meg: Don't worry about me.",
        "Paul: Doesn't bother you?",
        "Meg: You're doing what has to be done.",
        "Paul: Still, couldn't have been fun.",
        "Paul: No, it wasn't fun to watch. I don't like to see you crawl all over each other. It's not my idea of a good time.",
        "Paul: Is that all?",
        "Meg: What do you want to hear, Paul, that I'm jealous?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Whoa! Whoa! Don't you dare!",
        "Dusty: I need a doctor.",
        "Emily: I fixed it.",
        "Dusty: It won't do the trick.",
        "Emily: I'll get you a principal, maybe, if you cooperate.",
        "Dusty: I want to help you.",
        "Emily: You want to help? That's why you tried to run away.",
        "Dusty: When you got that phone call, I thought your prayers were answered. I didn't think you were coming back.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, I'm right here, aren't I?",
        "Dusty: I just did what I could to save myself. You're not going to begrudge me, are you?",
        "Emily: Are you kidding me? You think I'm going to take that seriously?",
        "Dusty: What on the phone made you so happy? Let me guess. Paul?",
        "Emily: None of your business.",
        "Dusty: it was good news, right?",
        "Emily: Yes, it was.",
        "Dusty: Em, that's great. Things are working out for you.",
        "Emily: Yes they are. You're still bleeding.",
        "Dusty: I told you, I need a doctor.",
        "Emily: That can't happen. They'd ask questions.",
        "Dusty: I'll have answers. Ones that don't implicate you. Emily, come on, this is the you know if the cops find me here all the evidence leads back to you. Look at you, right now. You don't know how to get out. I know you want it to end well, so I advise you to take my deal. I will tell whoever the cops that some mole in Chicago kidnapped me and I'll never, ever mention the words \"Emily Stewart.\" You just get me home and it's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I really just did that for a project.",
        "Margo: You don't have to convince me of everything. I think you're doing a very good job of earning your own tuition money and I like that.",
        "Casey: Is that why you did it, for the money?",
        "Maddie: I didn't.",
        "Maddie: Boy, does he get mad.",
        "Katie: Doesn't like being jerked around.",
        "Casey: Maddie, you let me think you wrote it, but i should have known there was no way.",
        "Maddie: What do you mean, no way?",
        "Casey: You couldn't write a novel.",
        "Maddie: Don't be so sure.",
        "Casey: Are you saying you did write it?",
        "Maddie: How could I if there's no way I could.",
        "Casey: Man, you did. Why didn't you just tell Mike when he was here?",
        "Maddie: You saw me, he was about to rip my head off for putting me in the book.",
        "Casey: So it was you. Something I want to say to Missey Nonmuss here.",
        "Gwen: Ooh, do I have to read this or have I lived it all already?",
        "Will: Both. What brings you out here?",
        "Gwen: I thought you could use some support.",
        "Maddie: That's nice, you're right.",
        "Casey: She was great.",
        "Gwen: That's why you're here. You sure there's not another reason? Are you anonymous? Well, come on.",
        "Emma: Too much to do, too much moving my family in and out of my house.",
        "Lucinda: Who is else is there besides meg?",
        "Emma: Meg is staying here in Lakeview. Don't ask.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Emma: Now, Jack's staying with me.",
        "Lucinda: Jack?",
        "Emma: Oh, I spoke to Carly earlier, she doesn't say anything.",
        "Lucinda: I don't think she's too proud of herself right now at the moment.",
        "Emma: I know a little about what's going on, but I didn't think it had gotten that far.",
        "Lucinda: It has.",
        "Emma: Bad?",
        "Lucinda: Very bad. They're talking about a situation.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. That's not going to happen. It's never worked in the past.",
        "Jack: Here's how things -- it's not going to be a first time.",
        "Carly: You're not here about the book. You're here because you had to see me.",
        "Jack: I came to see what you'd done, Carly. I needed to see if I had to do damage control and maybe you wrote about your gangster friends.",
        "Carly: You don't believe a word of it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I do.",
        "Carly: Then look me in the eye when you say it. You're not through.",
        "Jack: I filed the papers with Jessica.",
        "Carly: It doesn't matter. Can you see a hundred lawyers? Can you get any little piece of paper you want? It doesn't change us. We belong together.",
        "Jack: No. We don't.",
        "Carly: I have to fight for you again? Fine. It won't be the first time. But you can't make me give up on us.",
        "Jack: Stop. You need to stop talking like that and accept where we are. There is no more us. It's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I wish I could trust you.",
        "Dusty: You've backed yourself into a corner. You know that, right? The minute you gave Hal that photo, you signed your death warrant and they're never going to stop looking for me now. The lab guys, they're going to be all over that photo and believe me, now that Jennifer knows, the pressure's on. They're going to find this place. They're going to find your DNA. I told you.",
        "Emily: I told you, just shut up!",
        "Dusty: I can prevent it from happening but you got to be in this with me! Let's face it, you need my help.",
        "Emily: I need you to shut up, Dusty. You don't know what you're talking about. Shut up and I'll deal with you tomorrow. Paul, it's me. Are you there?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul, if Emily Stewart is truly what you want, then you have my blessing.",
        "Paul: I never said that.",
        "Meg: There was a time you two looked like the perfect couple. And now that you're married and you find that, you know, it's all coming back, then --",
        "Paul: Then what? Do you honestly think that's what I want?",
        "Meg: Paul, you have a hundred answers to that question. You love Rosanna, so you can't love anyone else. You don't know how to love at all. I'm sure there was even a point that you told Emily that you loved her.",
        "Paul: Of course I did.",
        "Meg: So what does it matter what you say now?",
        "Paul: I suppose it doesn't.",
        "Meg: It's what you do that counts.",
        "Paul: Yes, like confessing to a crime I didn't commit to protect you because i did that. I did!",
        "Meg: I know! I know, okay. You were ready to go to jail for me and we're not even --",
        "Paul: Not even what? Nobody ever accused me of being simple.",
        "Meg: No, they didn't.",
        "Paul: I married Emily to get to Dusty because I owe it to my sister to bring him home and anything that happens with Emily is only about that.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Paul: Is it?",
        "Meg: I'm done with the key, I think you she had go.",
        "Paul: Are you sure?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I made a pretty good --",
        "Paul: That's not what I was talking about.",
        "Meg: I know.",
        "Paul: Meg, Emily is not who I want to be with.",
        "Paul: Are you okay?",
        "Meg: Sure.",
        "Paul: Really?",
        "Meg: Yeah, you should go.",
        "Paul: All right. I'll try and call you as soon as I can, okay?",
        "Meg: Don't do that. You have enough to worry about. Don't add me to the list.",
        "Paul: You're not on a list.",
        "Meg: Don't do anything to make Emily suspicious. All right? Just concentrate on finding Dusty. For Jennifer.",
        "Paul: Okay. I'll be in touch as soon as I can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I can't do it anymore, Carly. This myth that you and I are stronger than anything that happens, anything you can do to us, it's just that. It's a myth. And I'm tired of the drama. I'm tired of feeling like I'm in this alone.",
        "Carly: I know that feeling, Jack. I know it well. It's how I felt with you and Julia. Both Julia's! You think I'm the only one who has done wrong to our marriage?",
        "Jack: I didn't say that.",
        "Carly: I fought for you. And, you know, I felt alone sometimes, but I didn't let that stop me.",
        "Jack: And I didn't lie to you. Not then, not now.",
        "Carly: And that's the only thing that matters. Because I can do stupid things and be too scared to tell you, that weighs more than anything else? All the love, all the caring, all the holding on with bloody fingernails when I had to keep you from falling, Jack, that doesn't matter at all?",
        "Jack: It matters. It's why I will love you until the day I die.",
        "Carly: No, no, Jack! No!",
        "Jack: I can't live with us anymore.",
        "Gwen: Hey. You okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah. How's the party?",
        "Gwen: Kind of a bore now.",
        "Carly: Guess anonymous should've stepped up. It wasn't me.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. Like you'd have time to write a book.",
        "Carly: Of course I wouldn't, anybody should know that, right?",
        "Gwen: Is that why Jack looks upset?",
        "Carly: That's the least of it. I'm sorry.",
        "Gwen: Don't. Don't be. Did you drive here?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Stay right here, I'll be back in two minutes. Okay?",
        "Will: Hey, where've you been?",
        "Gwen: I went to the ladies room.",
        "Will: Check this. Maddie. Anonymous. This could get pretty ugly.",
        "Gwen: Can you tell them all goodbye for me?",
        "Will: I guess. Why?",
        "Gwen: Carly's in the lobby in a puddle. She and Jack just had a bad fight. Or maybe it was part ten of the same bad fight they were having the other day. Either way, she's in bad shape.",
        "Will: Go. You need the car?",
        "Gwen: I'll drive Carly's. I'll call you when I'm done.",
        "Will: Sure. This is a good thing, time with your sister?",
        "Gwen: Maybe. I think so.",
        "Will: Did you tell her we're married yet?",
        "Gwen: No, it has so not felt right.",
        "Will: Yeah. So don't let her see the ring.",
        "Gwen: You're right. Thanks. Thank you.",
        "Kim: How is my nephew the newlywed?",
        "Will: He's a happy guy.",
        "Kim: How's it working out living at your dad's?",
        "Will: We're all still alive. And none of us are in jail.",
        "Kim: That's the best you can say?",
        "Will: That's a good score card for the Munson/Ryan clan.",
        "Kim: How's Gwen doing with it is she holding her own?",
        "Will: She loves it. I'm serious. She's way into taking care of the house, making meals. She wants to pay her way, which is so not what I want.",
        "Kim: She'll settle into belonging.",
        "Will: I hope. She wants to make peace with the family, too.",
        "Kim: That sounds good.",
        "Will: Yeah, it sounds good.",
        "Kim: You're not happy about it.",
        "Will: Some wounds are too deep, you know? I'd rather say that's it and leave it alone.",

        "Lily: Hey. Buy me a club soda?",
        "Jack: You tell Carly she's going to send in the troops --",
        "Lily: You tell Carly whatever you want. She didn't send me.",
        "Jack: You suddenly decided this was a great time to catch up?",
        "Lily: I spoke to Emma. She said you'd moved out to the farm.",
        "Jack: Let me guess. My mistake?",
        "Lily: Just the opposite. I think it's the smartest thing you could've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I'm flattered. You don't hate me?",
        "Casey: No, I understood you were worried.",
        "Margo: No, your mom has a rule.",
        "Casey: You can't stop Maddie and me from seeing each other.",
        "Margo: I have no intention to.",
        "Casey: Okay, did that really happen?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I can't believe she likes me again.",
        "Casey: You totally scored writing that stuff about her. Do you know how easy it'll be to get together now?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. Too bad I never want to see you again.",

        "Emily: Excuse me, have you seen Paul Ryan tonight?",

        "Katie: Honey, you don't want a lawyer.",
        "Mike: The hell I don't. It's got to be defamation or something. How did Maddie even find out these personal things about me anyway?",
        "Katie: Honey, lots of people know you were in jail once. You never tried to hide it.",
        "Mike: I don't shout it from rooftops either.",
        "Katie: In the book, the jail time is for a completely differently crime. That's why they call it fiction.",
        "Mike: You think that makes it different?",
        "Katie: It just spices up the character. You know, good guy with a little edge. Makes the hero not so perfect.",
        "Mike: Hero?",
        "Katie: I bet you're the hero of the book.",
        "Mike: I repeat, you think that makes it better?",
        "Katie: If it's one little mention about a crime and it's not even true, who do you think it will hurt?",
        "Mike: It'll hurt if people don't want to hire a convicted felon.",
        "Katie: Anybody who looks up your license can find that out. Right?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Katie: And nobody looks because people who know you trust you completely and they'll keep you up to your ears in work for the rest of our lives.",
        "Mike: Why are you so casual and calm about all this?",
        "Katie: Because you're so upset about it.",
        "Mike: Uh uh. Why are you trying to convince me this book is okay?",

        "Lily: You and Carly should take some time apart and cool off.",
        "Jack: It's more than that.",
        "Lily: I know that's how it feels right now, but --",
        "Jack: I got a lawyer and fight the papers.",
        "Lily: Yeah, Holden and I have done that. More than once. Jack, you don't want to live without Carly.",
        "Jack: No. I don't. But I have to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I saw Jack at the bar throwing back drinks and I'm sorry, that's not someone who's done. You guys are going to get back together.",
        "Carly: I'm not sure.",
        "Gwen: I am.",
        "Carly: I hurt him so many times without even meaning to, you know that. I think I'm doing the right thing and i go all out and -- yeah. Boom. Now Jack is throwing back drinks, boom. And our whole life is in pieces. Bing.",
        "Gwen: You and Jack, you mess up and the reason I feels like the worst thing is because you guys care so much, but you have to go back to that love. Because there are so many places in the world where all you get is a slap in the face, you know?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I do.",
        "Gwen: I mean, maybe I don't get it.",
        "Carly: I think you do. Yeah. Thank you for getting me off that couch in the Lakeview. It was a mess.",

        "Gwen: I would've.",
        "Carly: You tried.",
        "Gwen: It's okay.",
        "Carly: It's not okay, you tried to give me some really important news and I didn't listen to you.",
        "Gwen: Carly, stop. It's okay. It's fine. I'm going to go to the ladies room and I'm going to clean up my face for a bit and I'm going to come back here and you're going to tell me everything about your wedding.",
        "Carly: Will, you don't look so good.",
        "Gwen: Nothing. Why are you here? Carly was starting to feel better, then she saw the ring. I should've taken it off.",
        "Will: Big lecture?",
        "Gwen: No, not at all. Actually, she wants us to be happy.",
        "Carly: I am happy for you. So, tell me all about it. I mean, about the wedding.",

        "Paul: Yeah. Took a lot longer than i thought it would.",
        "Emily: I thought you just going to drop Jennifer off.",
        "Paul: Yeah, she just kept gabbing away so I walked her in.",
        "Emily: Oh.",
        "Paul: I really didn't mean to keep you waiting.",
        "Emily: Jennifer must've had a lot to say.",
        "Paul: And all I wanted was to come home to you.",
        "Emily: Really?",
        "Paul: It's our first night home.",
        "Emily: Right, and you spent more time at the Lakeview than here. Since the second you got out of jail, it's amazing. It must be nice to see people milling around.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I guess. Yeah.",
        "Emily: The Lakeview was packed, right? Must have been nice to run into some old friends.",
        "Paul: No, the lobby was pretty empty by the time Jennifer and I got there.",

        "Casey: I was kind of surprised that I'm dating a girl that could write a book.",
        "Maddie: No wonder. You use to date girls who couldn't even read a book.",
        "Casey: They never gave me as much trouble as you either. And they could always look at the pictures and follow along. Hey. You know what? You're the biggest pain in the butt I ever dated.",
        "Maddie: Oh, thank you, I feel really special now.",
        "Casey: You're the most fun too. So, Mad, did you write that book or not?",

        "Mike: Katie?",
        "Katie: I just can't believe you're so upset about a book.",
        "Mike: Is it because it's Maddie? I know you've got a soft spot for the girl.",
        "Katie: I do.",
        "Mike: I told you we didn't do her any favors letting her off the hook before.",
        "Katie: Mike, this book isn't a crime. In fact, it could probably give you some good publicity.",
        "Mike: Huge got to be kidding me.",
        "Katie: Your name will be out there.",
        "Mike: As a convicted felon.",
        "Katie: Not for real!",
        "Mike: How did Maddie even find out so much dirt? She couldn't get all of this from watching old tapes at WOAK. Baby.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Mike: Did you tell Maddie these stories?",

        "Mike: No.",
        "Katie: So don't make judgments. For all you know there's one little mention about you being in trouble when you you were a kid and the rest of the time you slay dragons and solve crimes and get girls. Okay? Don't make judgments until you read the whole thing. Not right now! That's better. You've been away for months.",
        "Mike: I know. We have a lot of time to make up for.",
        "Katie: Forget the book.",
        "Mike: What book?",
        "Margo: No, really I would have put money on it being Katie, but it really looks like it was Maddie.",

        "Lily: Things with Carly won't look so bad in a couple of days. Maybe it'll take longer, but you will get past the hurt.",
        "Jack: I know. No, that's why I have to file the papers now because you're right, in a couple weeks, it will hurt less and in a month or two, all I'll remember is how much we love each other and then I'll just be waiting for the other shoe to drop and I can't do that. To me or the kids. I got to let it go.",

        "Carly: Lisa caught your bouquet?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but she doesn't want a husband this spring because she's too busy with crash. It's a club that she's opening.",

        "Carly: Yeah. He'll be there for a while.",

Even when I hated you, I'd go to your house to see the baby and, just walking inside of there into your guys' world, it was like watching a dance. You guys were so right. So together with the kids. That's not going to go away. Bye-bye. You know where to find me.",
        "Carly: I do.",
        "Gwen: I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?",

        "Emily: Really, i thought she wasn't a problem for you.",
        "Paul: She's not, but it's not like I'm going to hang around her. Besides, I want to get home. See my bride. What's wrong?",
