        "Jade: Lily? Holden?",
        "Lily: Jade?",
        "Jade: Sorry, I didn't realize --",
        "Lily: What are you doing in here?",
        "Jade: I was hungry. There's no food in that house.",
        "Lily: Is that my nail polish?",
        "Jade: Oh, sorry. It was in Faith and Natalie's bathroom. I knew they wouldn't mind, and I really can't afford a pedicure right now, so I just thought I would do a touch-up.",
        "Lily: A touch-up, right here, on the new carpet, in the middle of the living room?",
        "Jade: Sorry, I should've stayed in the kitchen.",
        "Lily: No, you should've stayed in the guest house, as we agreed, Jade. I can't have you sneaking in here every time I go out for an errand or I take the kids to school.",
        "Jade: I wasn't sneaking.",
        "Lily: As far as your financial situation? I have a solution.",
        "Jade: Great. I really didn't want to bother you, but I could really use a loan.",
        "Lily: What you need is a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Look, I was thinking. You know, now that Parker's living with us --",
        "Will: Parker's not living with us, Parker's living with my dad.",
        "Gwen: Okay, well, we're living in the same house. The point is, I was thinking that, you know, maybe we could invite Carly over. You know?",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Gwen: Why? I'm sorry, are you listening to me?",
        "Will: Yeah. No. I'm sorry, okay? My brain is melting. I know you want to help your sister out right now but -- how did I ever think I could finish a year's worth of Calculus in six weeks?",
        "Gwen: Five weeks. Sorry.",
        "Will: You were right to take it last year. I got a C on the last quiz.",
        "Gwen: So, let me help.",
        "Will: Okay. Do you know the area -- do you know how to find the area under a curve?",
        "Gwen: Depends on the curve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey, I woke up and you were gone. Couldn't you sleep?",
        "Mike: No, I guess I'm still on Latvian time.",
        "Katie: Oh, maybe we should go back upstairs and reset your clock.",
        "Mike: But you're all dressed.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but that's the thing about clothes. You put 'em on and you can take 'em off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Thank you. Here you go. Thanks a lot. Hey, it's me. I need your help.",
        "Paul: Em, you up? I made some food. Well, look who it is. How's your head?",
        "Emily: My head?",
        "Paul: Yeah, last night you said you were gonna take some aspirin, try and get some rest.",
        "Emily: Oh, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Paul: You feeling better?",
        "Emily: Yeah, great. Just super. Thanks for asking.",
        "Paul: Where're you going?",
        "Emily: Like you care.",
        "Paul: No, of course I care. Look, I made breakfast. I, I -- I'd hoped that we could go back to bed, you know? Make up for last night.",
        "Emily: Oh, you mean our first night home together? That you spent with your sister and Meg Snyder instead? I don't think so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: A job?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I mean, you're old enough to leave your home, your family, you're old enough to support yourself. Thus far, we've allowed you to live rent free at the cabin -- can't continue.",
        "Jade: You want to charge me rent?",
        "Lily: Rent plus utilities, food, those fancy pedicures. You're gonna have to find a way to pay for all that.",
        "Jade: Lily, I am so grateful to you for everything that you've done for me. Especially -- especially since I lied to you about who I was. And I know that you don't understand why I did it or why I still want to stay here knowing how you feel about me. But this place, it feels more like a real home to me than where I grew up. Partly because you're a family that actually cares enough to yell at me. And mostly because your son loves me. So if you say I need to get a job, I will do it. In fact, I have been looking. I spoke to the girl who works in the salon in town, but she's not hiring. Don't worry, I definitely will keep on it. And I will find something.",
        "Lily: Okay. Good, good, I'm glad that you feel that way, because I found you a job. You start today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: People don't read biographies anymore, do they?",
        "Gwen: No, why?",
        "Will: Because I was thinking if we don't find a place in like two minutes, and the stacks in the back are really just -- you and me, Winston Churchill.",
        "Gwen: Oh, we can't. I gotta go talk to Casey at Java about the music for crash and you have to finish your assignment.",
        "Will: Why do you get to have a life and I get to do Calculus?",
        "Gwen: Because it's a lot easier to write an essay on a book you've never read than to ace a quiz that you haven't even finished the chapter for in Calculus.",
        "Will: Okay, so, you take the quiz and I'll write the essay?",
        "Gwen: Okay, sure. Harrison is blind, but I do think she would notice if William Munson walked into her class with bleach-blonde hair. So, what do you think? Can I invite Carly over to see Parker? Sure, yeah, then Jack can arrest us for interfering.",
        "Will: Jack? Uh-huh, he's not going to arrest us. I know how you feel about your family, but --",
        "Will: Listen, I know you want to fix your family, but just don't get any ideas about my family. It's bad enough that we're living with my dad. Just wait until my mother tries to plot her next move.",
        "Gwen: She's kind of been leaving us alone.",
        "Will: Yeah, but that never lasts. You know, she's dangerous, okay? Just stay away from her. She's like that alligator that offers to give the little mouse a lift to the other side of the water and then just swallows it, you know?",
        "Gwen: Okay, I got it. I'll never take a lift from your mother. All right, what do you want for dinner? I'm cooking.",
        "Will: I don't know, surprise me. How am I supposed to do Calculus when all I want to do is --?",
        "Gwen: I know, me, too. But we've got stuff to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, what do you say, sexy? You want to go back upstairs?",
        "Mike: Don't you have a wedding to plan?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Mike: All right, so where are the books? The menus? The seating charts?",
        "Katie: Upstairs, I have a whole filing cabinet full. Why? I didn't think you were interested.",
        "Mike: I came all the way back from Latvia to marry you. You didn't think I'd be interested?",
        "Katie: Well, not in boutonnieres and bouquets.",
        "Mike: Hey, you've been collecting photos of wedding gowns since you were six, right? You got a chest in the attic filled with flowers and menus and wedding marches, right? Of course I want to be part of it. I want to share this with you.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Mike: Look, I feel bad enough about being gone for so many months. So, let me help out, you know? Besides, it'll be fun.",
        "Katie: It is so fun. Okay, well, I was thinking about having it outside, like a garden party. But then people will expect me to wear a hat and I don't want to wear a hat unless I change for the reception, which I could do, but then we also have to think about rain, so we could get a tent. Oh, and I saw the most beautiful Rose-covered canopy.",
        "Mike: Let's see it.",
        "Katie: It's in a book at the library. Oh, actually, I'm supposed to meet nancy over there later, we're gonna go over flower arrangements. Maybe I could ask her to meet me there earlier, I can bring all the stuff back here and then you and I could look at it.",
        "Mike: You're on.",
        "Katie: You promise you're not gonna punk out on me?",
        "Mike: I'll be here.",
        "Katie: Okay. You are the best fianc\u00e9 ever. I love you.",
        "Mike: Man, I was wondering when you were gonna get here.",
        "Nick: You told me to wait until she left. What's up?",
        "Mike: Look, I need to talk you about something.",
        "Nick: Something I did?",
        "Mike: No, something I did. A long time ago.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, Mama. Thanks for coming.",
        "Emma: Are you all right?",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, come on in.",
        "Emma: I hear that -- I hear that Paul Ryan has been released from prison. You know, his sister and his mother, they both live here. Maybe you should move back to the farm.",
        "Meg: You know, I don't want to talk about Paul. There is something I do need to ask, though.",
        "Emma: Where'd you get that?",
        "Meg: Didn't we used to have keys like this around the farm?",
        "Emma: Yeah, we still do.",
        "Meg: What are they for? Doors? Trunks?",
        "Emma: No, no, no. A key like this opens something larger like a padlock. You know, the kind we use to hold chains together. You know, like the chains we use on the machinery shed or -- we always used chains for animal pens.",
        "Meg: Yeah, right. I guess most farms still have old-fashioned padlocks like that?",
        "Emma: Yes, yes. Yes, they do. Why are you asking? Meg, you're scaring me. I mean, all this talk about chains and locks and mysterious keys. What's going on?",
        "Paul: You're upset at me because I drove my sister home?",
        "Emily: You lied to me. I saw you in the Lakeview.",
        "Paul: Jennifer said she wanted to talk with me. What was I supposed to do, say no?",
        "Emily: Yeah, why not? It was our first night home as a married couple.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, the only reason we had that night was because Jennifer refused to testify.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but that doesn't explain why you ran off to see Meg, now does it?",
        "Paul: I didn't run off to see Meg --",
        "Emily: And don't even try to explain yourself, okay? Don't try and lie, because I saw you. You were standing by the elevators. And I cannot believe when I asked you about it last night, you point blank -- you lied to my face.",
        "Paul: Is that why you got a headache?",
        "Emily: Well, excuse me for not wanting to make love to a man who walked out on me to be with another woman!",
        "Paul: I didn't walk out on you! I drove my sister home! The only reason I didn't mention seeing Meg was because I knew you were gonna do this, you were gonna get all freaked out. You were gonna get all upset.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, you know what, guess what? Being lied to upsets me even more.",
        "Paul: Come on, listen --",
        "Emily: No, don't, don't! It's obvious you don't want me here. My mother was right, you used me to get out of jail.",
        "Paul: First of all, Jennifer is the one that got me out of jail, okay? Not that I don't appreciate all of your support and your good Faith. But you know, the thing that I don't understand is why you couldn't just tell me the truth? Why didn't you just tell me that you saw me bump into Meg?",
        "Emily: Why? Because I don't trust you. You always make things sound so innocent. That's what you do. You always do that. You always make it seem like you're right and I'm wrong and I go off and I rough and I do things I'm ashamed of. And I'm not doing that anymore! I've already gone too far.",
        "Paul: What have you done that I don't know about?",
        "Emily: Like what?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I have no earthly idea. But something has got you all uptight. Look at you, you're so tense.",
        "Emily: Tense? I'm tense? I'm still dealing with having to live with what we did to your sister, keeping her from her son. I've done everything I can to get you out of jail, and you're asking if I need something else in my life that makes me feel tense?",
        "Paul: Emily, look, you've always been so loyal.",
        "Emily: You would say anything to get on my good side. Save it. I don't believe a word that comes out of your mouth.",
        "Paul: Wait a minute. You wait a minute! Now listen, you are my wife, and if there's a problem between us, then we need to talk about this.",
        "Emily: Talk? Remember what happened the last time we decided to have a little chat about how you betrayed me, I shot you in the back. You want to go there again?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Emily: Then let it go. What's the matter, Paul? You afraid I'm gonna hurt someone? Like your girlfriend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: So, I will stop by next week and see if you have an opening.",
        "Librarian: Oh, the job is yours, Jade. This is just a standard form for our records.",
        "Lily: When can she start?",
        "Librarian: How about right now?",
        "Lily: Perfect. My son, Luke, will be by later on, he'll drive her home.",
        "Luke: Oh, hey, Mom. Hey, I got your message.",
        "Lily: Oh, there you are. Yeah. We have very good news. Jade has a part-time job here at the library. I knew you were coming by, so I thought maybe you could take her home -- straight home.",
        "Luke: Yeah, not a problem.",
        "Lily: Good. Good luck, Jade. Bernice, thank you for your help as always, it's a good read. Bye, guys.",
        "Luke: Bye, Mom.",
        "Librarian: Why don't we get started?",
        "Jade: You knew about this, didn't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So, how'd the rest of your band take the news?",
        "Gwen: Are you kidding? They're psyched, it's amazing. We never thought that we'd be able to play together again. It's like a -- it's like a dream come true, you know?",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's pretty cool.",
        "Gwen: So, how'd it happen?",
        "Casey: Don't look at me.",
        "Gwen: Come on, you didn't tell your grandma to hire us?",
        "Casey: She asked about you, i said I'd heard you and that you were surprisingly okay.",
        "Gwen: Wow, you really went overboard there.",
        "Casey: I gave her that cd you burned me when you wanted to play prom.",
        "Gwen: You kept that?",
        "Casey: Sure, why not?",
        "Gwen: I don't know, I'm just surprised, that's all.",
        "Casey: Anyway, yeah, so, I guess Gram gave it a listen and decided she liked it. I don't know what else to say.",
        "Gwen: No, don't, it's fine, it's good. This is going to be really fun.",
        "Barbara: Lisa, I really owe you one. This is going to be a perfect job for my new daughter-in-law. I hear that Gwen is such a music lover, and a real talent to boot. Yes, well, I just want to thank you for giving her this opportunity. Thank you so much for hiring her.",
        "Gwen: What the hell is going on, Barbara? Are you setting me up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Who wrote this?",
        "Mike: I don't know. No one's taken credit. But I know it wasn't Katie.",
        "Nick: And it wasn't Carly. I mean, she doesn't have the time. But isn't this --",
        "Mike: Henry's sister, Maddie.",
        "Nick: Right.",
        "Mike: Look, whoever wrote it knows a whole lot about this town and the people in it.",
        "Nick: So is it fiction or is it --",
        "Mike: It's fiction, except when it isn't.",
        "Mike: There's some stuff in there about my past, Nick.",
        "Nick: Like what?",
        "Mike: The character -- who's me -- goes to jail. Only in the book, he's taking the rap for someone else.",
        "Nick: But everybody around here knows that you did a short hitch for a two-bit burglary.",
        "Mike: I don't care what people know. It's what they don't know.",
        "Nick: Oh, and you don't want them snooping around.",
        "Mike: Hell, no. Because if they find out what really happened, I'm in trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Just research.",
        "Emma: Research? What are you talking about? Are you trying to find out something about Paul?",
        "Meg: This has nothing to do with Paul.",
        "Emma: Then what are you trying to find out? What are you doing?",
        "Meg: Look, if you need to know, I'm trying to find Dusty.",
        "Emma: Dusty! Oh, come on, Meg. Now, don't get mixed up in that.",
        "Meg: I'm already mixed up in it, Mama. I was arrested.",
        "Emma: Look, if you think this key has something to do with that, why don't you take it to the police?",
        "Meg: I can't. They're gonna think I'm throwing suspicion on somebody else. And I'm still under investigation like you point out. So, I need to be careful.",
        "Emma: I don't like this.",
        "Meg: You know, neither do I. But until Dusty -- until we find him, it can't be helped.",
        "Emma: Well, I don't suppose you're gonna tell me where you got the key.",
        "Meg: If I knew what it meant or who it belonged to, I wouldn't be asking you questions about the key, would I?",
        "Emma: Hey, hey, hey. Listen, don't you get smart with me, miss.",
        "Meg: Okay, look, I'm so sorry, Mama. I don't mean to get smart. I just don't have the answers and I wish I did. But you've been a big help, and let's just leave it at that.",
        "Emma: I don't know. You show me this key and you tell me about you're looking for Dusty --",
        "Meg: And as soon as I find him, you'll be the first to know.",
        "Emma: Uh-huh. Somehow I doubt that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know, I'm worried about you. You've have no sleep. And you're so upset about everything. You're blowing everything out of proportion. I don't think it's a good idea for you to get behind the wheel of a car.",
        "Emily: Oh, there's an idea. I can run over your lover with me car.",
        "Paul: She's not my lover!",
        "Emily: Then what were you doing with her at the Lakeview?",
        "Paul: For the 6,000th time, I was driving my sister home! Honestly, Emily, do you think that Meg and Jennifer hatched some plot to get me out of the house and rendezvous with Meg in the lobby of a hotel? Come on, get a grip!",
        "Emily: You are unbelievable! You're angry at me?",
        "Paul: That's right I am! Because you're treating me like some kind of a sleaze who would cheat on his wife, and that doesn't feel very good. Especially when everything that we've done, we've done your way. You said you wanted to get married, I thought it was a bad idea. We went through with it because you wanted it so badly and because I love you so much.",
        "Emily: You love me but you didn't want to marry me. Not like this. Not until we'd had a chance to put the trust back between us. You wanted to get married because you wanted to prove something to yourself.",
        "Paul: Emily, the only reason I ran into Meg in the hotel is because she happens to live there. And the truth is -- yeah, she's got a little thing for me. And then after -- after we got married and I was released and now we're living together, it kind of snapped her. Look, I was trying to talk to her for, like, two minutes to calm her down so she wouldn't come here to our home and bang on the door. That's it! I came back here and you were in a mood. So I just, I let everything go. And I made you breakfast, and now -- look, here we are.",
        "Emily: Why didn't you tell me this last night?",
        "Paul: Because, I wanted to spend time with you in our bed. And I knew that if I started talking about Meg that -- that just wasn't gonna happen.",
        "Emily: I thought Meg was supposed to hate you so much she was gonna testify against you?",
        "Paul: She knew that I was still in love with you. She was trying to punish me. And then when I was released and things weren't working out, she completely flipped. She's been following me. She's obsessed with me. She's calling me. Emily, she's just trying to break us -- she's trying to break us up. Can't you see that?",
        "Emily: I want to. I really want to believe you. And it's just -- I'm a little afraid.",
        "Paul: Fine. You know what, we'll call a lawyer, we'll get the marriage annulled. Isn't this great, Meg Snyder wins.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. I don't want an annulment. I want to be your wife. But I need to know that you -- that you want that as much as I do. And that the only reason you turned your back on me the first time we were supposed to be married is because you were trying to protect me.",
        "Paul: I was trying to protect you. Look, I swear on my life I was trying to spare you.",
        "Emily: So everything I did was worth it?",
        "Paul: I don't know. What have you done? Emily, you keep alluding to this dark secret you have. Please, if you're in some kind of trouble, would you tell me? We'll get you what you need -- you need lawyers, money, fine. We'll get it. You want to go to the airport and leave the country? We'll leave, right now.",
        "Emily: You would do that for me?",
        "Paul: Of course I would do that for you, you're my wife. Emily, please, you need to talk to me.",
        "Emily: No, I don't want to talk. I don't want to talk anymore. Please, I just want you to hold me. Okay, please? Just listen, I don't want to talk. Because when I start talking, I start thinking and then I get scared. Please, I just -- I just want you to make love to me until all I feel is that I'm right where I belong. And that you love me and that everything's going to be all right.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Emily: Okay?",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Nick: You don't want to start borrowing trouble.",
        "Katie: Who's borrowing trouble?",
        "Gwen: I'm starting to think that you're right, okay? So I would like to thank you for giving me this chance.",
        "Meg: Damn it, Paul. Pick up. Oprah: Schools in crisis -- what can we do about it? How soon before you notice the change with the kids?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Why, Gwen, I didn't see you here. What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: You getting me a job at Lisa Grimaldi's club.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes, well, I guess I did mention something to Lisa about your musical talent. Hello, Casey.",
        "Gwen: I'm -- I'm sorry, you don't know the first thing about my musical talent.",
        "Barbara: Well, will has told me how musically gifted you are, and I was just trying to make things up to you.",
        "Gwen: Make things up to me? You're setting me up.",
        "Barbara: Now, what do you possibly mean by that?",
        "Gwen: Okay, it goes like this. You get me a job at your friend's club. And then what happens? Some of the stereo equipment goes missing. The cash register comes up short and who gets blamed for it? Me. I get taken off to jail and then who comes for a visit? Your lawyer. With very good news. All the charges will magically disappear if I agree to divorce your son.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay, I can certainly understand you're questioning my motives, especially after the unpleasantness at the Lakeview.",
        "Gwen: Oh, that was the first time she set me up to look like a thief. I got fired. And the second time, yeah, she had the cops to put out an APB. You remember that.",
        "Barbara: I thought that we were past all of that. And I would certainly like a fresh start, which is why I spoke to Lisa about this. We would both like to make up it up to you after what happened at the hotel. But if it makes you uncomfortable --",
        "Gwen: It does, it does. It makes me uncomfortable. I'm sorry, I can't do this.",
        "Casey: You sure?",
        "Gwen: I can't. Not if she's involved.",
        "Casey: Yeah, keep them. I'll call you later. Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: Casey. Gwen, look, we got off to a rough start and I admit it, it was my fault. It's just that I was very nervous about my son getting involved with anyone. I mean, he's so young. I didn't want to lose him. So, yes, I interfered. But you're married now. And I want to make us a family. So can't you please just accept this gesture? I spoke to Lisa about you because I thought it would make you happy. That's all it was. Can't you please accept that?",

        "Jade: Where were you this morning?",
        "Luke: Hello? School? Besides, Jade, you keep talking about how you need a job, now you have one. And this library's right at the heart of the town. Sooner or later everyone's bound to walk through those doors.",
        "Jade: It just feels like another way for your mom to make me feel unwelcome in her house. She's talking about charging me rent.",
        "Librarian: Less talking, more shelving, please.",
        "Jade: Yes, ma'am.",

        "Nancy: Don't worry. I've asked the librarian to put a hold on everything we need.",
        "Katie: What would I do without you? Wow, they're really making a big deal about this book, huh?",
        "Nancy: As well they should. It's very entertaining.",

        "Katie: I think it's an interesting read.",
        "Nancy: And Mike? Has he seen it?",
        "Katie: He's read parts of it. Actually I have to say his reaction to the book was a little surprising. His character, Mike, the character in the book is a noble guy, and he doesn't seem to think so. In fact, he's pretty upset about it.",

        "Emily: Oh, God, I'm so ashamed. I'm so sorry.",
        "Paul: No, no, listen, honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And what we had was so sweet, and I screwed it all up. I got us all mixed up with Jennifer.",
        "Emily: Yeah. You were just trying to protect her.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I hurt her. And I hurt you. I'll always regret that.",

        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Paul: We can get that back. Look, I know that it's difficult for you to share things with me. I know that it's hard for you to confide in me right now. But baby, that's the only way it's gonna work. Now you need to tell me everything. Okay? There can't be anymore secrets between us.",
        "Paul: You want to trust me again, don't you?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I do. But I start second guessing myself and suddenly I'm just spinning out of control.",
        "Paul: You know I know the feeling. When it happens to me I just tell myself that if I don't trust you, I'll lose you. And I don't want that to happen again, Emily.",
        "Emily: I don't want that.",
        "Paul: So what's it gonna take? What do I have to do to make you feel safe enough that you will tell me everything?",

        "Nick: This happened a long time ago, let it go. You don't want to start borrowing trouble.",

        "Barbara: Yes, of course I have an agenda. My son won't have anything to do with me. Do you have any idea how painful that is? Gwen, you had a son, and how painful was it for you when he was taken away from you? So you have to understand -- will won't have anything to do with me and I would do anything in the world to change that.",
        "Gwen: Even if that means being nice to me?",
        "Barbara: Yes. Exactly. So, you have this musical talent. All I did was make it possible for you to use your talents as a musician. That will make you happy, Gwen. And if you are happy, then Will will be happy and maybe he will find it in his heart to forgive me. All I did was make a suggestion to Lisa that she talk to you. I mean, no one even has to know that I'm involved.",
        "Gwen: Will and I don't have any secrets.",

        "Gwen: You make it sound so simple.",
        "Barbara: But it is. You can grab a hold of this opportunity. Give your band a chance. And you could hate me all day long if you want. I mean, just because you do this doesn't mean that you have to change your attitude or your feelings towards me. Or you could quit and go back to waiting tables. It's all up to you, Gwen.",

        "Emily: For a minute there it's as if nothing has changed. Don't you wish you could go back in time? Back to when we were happy?",

        "Luke: I just don't see what the problem is.",
        "Jade: The problem is she's splitting us up. We have to stay tight or else I'm gonna lose a place to live and you're gonna lose your cover and your parents are going to figure out you're gay. Does your dad know about this whole job thing?",
        "Luke: Okay, Jade, leave my dad out of this. He's not going to back you over my mom and its just gonna make things worse.",

        "Barbara: That's good to know.",
        "Gwen: And one of the things that's really important to him is that we get our own place as soon as we graduate. And obviously we would need jobs. And when I found out about this job at the club I was -- before I knew you were involved, I was so excited, you know? To get paid for playing music, that's all that I've ever wanted, work-wise. So I would hate to give that up.",
