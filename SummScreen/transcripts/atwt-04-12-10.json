        "Dusty wants to leave the hospital and does what he can to get released. Janet worries about him, but Dusty is more interested on having Jack promise, on the sly, that he will look after Janet, because he is worried about her safety. Jack feels Dusty may know more, but he doesn't let on. Dusty tells Janet that he can't move in with her right now, as Janet runs off and Carly is irate to see Jack once again go after her. Carly confronts Dusty, as he admits to what is going on and enlists her help. Carly isn't sure at first, but then agrees to help him by using himself as bait. Carly later has a conversation with Rocco, Janet and Jack about Dusty, which causes Rocco to excuse himself quickly. Janet is unsure as to why, but Carly thinks she knows. Someone shows up with a gun at Metro, as Dusty is leaning down in front of the safe trying to remember the combination. Craig doesn't like Gabriel and continues to make his feelings known. Johnny tells his dad that Gabriel was the one trying to talk with him on the playground causing Craig to confront him. Gabriel shows his true feelings when he talks about what he knows about him stealing Parker's money; he blackmails Craig into giving him 6 or 7 figures out of it. Craig doesn't take kindly to this, but has no choice since Gabriel threatens to got to the police. Liberty pulls away from Parker, who doesn't know how to not hover over Liberty for fear that she will cause herself a relapse. Liberty and Gabriel connect at the diner and they share some laughs. He gives her his cell phone number to talk. Liberty and Parker later have a conversation on how she feels suffocated by Parker, as Parker agrees to heed her and his mom's advice and give her some space. Liberty later calls Gabriel and asks him if he wants to hang out after he gets off of work. Jack realizes he is spending too much time with Janet and ignoring Carly; he reminds her that she is his priority and promises she will always be first, as Carly is thrilled to hear that but is also preoccupied with Dusty's plan."

        "Dusty: Where did you guys put my clothes?",
        "Nurse: They were covered in blood, but your girlfriend, she brought you these.",
        "Dusty: Oh, good. I got to get out of here.",
        "Nurse: Soon, Mr. Donovan, but your brain needs a little time to heal.",
        "Dusty: My brain's fine. I got to get out of here today. Can you, uh, get the doctor?",
        "Nurse: Dr. Oliver's out of town.",
        "Dusty: Whoever's covering for him. Please? I got to get out of here today.",
        "Nurse: Sure.",
        "Rocco: How's Mr. Donovan doing this morning? Any better?",
        "Dusty: Damn! I can't remember how to dial my phone!",
        "Rocco: Bad timing. I'll come back. I'll come back later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: [Whistles] You have been busy.",
        "Carly: I had to start the whole line over from scratch, and I want you to tell me what you think, but I don't want you to tell me what you think that I want to hear.",
        "Craig: I think these are fantastic, and, honestly, I liked your other designs, too.",
        "Carly: Maybe I should be partners with Gabriel. At least he's honest, and he seems to have a good eye.",
        "Craig: You're comparing me to a handyman?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I am, and, so, far, he's winning. If I'd shown the line the way it was, we would have been laughed out of this business.",
        "Craig: You're too hard on yourself, Carly.",
        "Carly: Well, the critics aren't gonna be any easier. I want Monte Carlo to succeed this time, and if that's gonna happen, we need to make some changes.",
        "Craig: We're just getting started.",
        "Carly: And we're already making rookie mistakes. We both know this company is not gonna survive if you're the only investor.",
        "Craig: Don't worry about the money. We have plenty to get us through the Milan show. After that, we'll be able to take our pick.",
        "Carly: Milan's coming up very quickly.",
        "Craig: I thought you wanted to bury yourself in work.",
        "Carly: I do. There's just a lot going on.",
        "Craig: Yeah. With Jack and Janet and Dusty.",
        "Carly: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Craig: There's really nothing you can do about it, you know. Could be the perfect time to get away.",
        "Gabriel: Uh, morning. Am I interrupting?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Carly: Not at all. I was just headed home.",
        "Craig: I thought we were gonna get some work done?",
        "Carly: Something came up.",
        "Craig: Oh, don't tell me. You're getting the bedroom ready for Dusty. Is he moving in, too?",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Gabriel: Is there anything else you'd like me to do?",
        "Carly: No, no. Just what's on the list. And, um, keep your eye on that thing that we talked about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rocco: I'm telling you, Ralph, I just came from the hospital. Donovan can't even figure out how to work his phone. There's no way he remembers the shooting, 'cause if he did, we'd have heard from the police by now. Call off your dogs, my friend. The man is no threat to us.",
        "Teri: What's this about a threat?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What are you doing out of bed?",
        "Dusty: I'm checking out.",
        "Janet: Did Dr. Oliver say it's okay?",
        "Dusty: No, he's out of town, but I can't stay here any longer.",
        "Janet: Honey, I would love to take you home, but you just had surgery a few days ago. It would be too risky.",
        "Dusty: I'm not the one at risk. I'm not sitting here while people I love are in danger.",
        "Janet: What are you talking about?",
        "Jack: You remember something about the shooting, don't you?",
        "Dusty: Somebody wants me dead. I know who, but I can't remember it.",
        "Jack: You're sure you don't remember anything? An image? A voice?",
        "Dusty: No. I would tell you. Janet, I can't rest here.",
        "Janet: Okay. Well, maybe if we get some of these people out of here, you'll be able to sleep for a few hours.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no. Just get the doctor for me. Please get me out of here.",
        "Janet: Okay. Okay, I'll go talk to him, but if he says you stay, you stay.",
        "Jack: She's gone. Now, is there something you want to tell me about the shooting?",
        "Dusty: I need you to take care of her.",
        "Jack: You can take care of Janet yourself. Your memory loss, your coordination, they'll come back. Just give it some time. The doctors are just being cautious.",
        "Dusty: Say you'll do it.",
        "Jack: You don't need me. Listen, you and Janet, you're gonna move in to that house that you bought.",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Jack: She needs you, man.",
        "Dusty: Not me. You.",
        "Jack: No. I'm busy trying to find the guy that did this to you.",
        "Dusty: It's over. Forget about it.",
        "Jack: I can't do that. Right now there's a guy walking around Oakdale with a score to settle. Maybe its okay if he comes in here and takes you out, but I'll be damned if it's gonna take you out on my watch.",
        "Dusty: It's over. You got to move on.",
        "Jack: What's really going on with you, Donovan?",
        "Dusty: Nothing.",
        "Jack: That's baloney. This isn't you. Someone does wrong by you, man, you make them pay.",
        "Dusty: Not anymore.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen. If you weren't laid up in this bed, you'd be out there hunting down the guy that did this to you. Lucky for Janet, you're in no condition to play vigilante right now. You worry about her while I find you some justice.",
        "Dusty: Jack, Janet's more important, and Liberty and the baby. Tell me you'll look after them. You got to promise me.",
        "Jack: All right.",
        "Janet: Okay. I spoke to the doctor on call, and -- what's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What are you doing up? I thought there was no school today.",
        "Parker: Well, I fell asleep in Liberty's chair, and she snuck out while I was asleep.",
        "Carly: What do you mean she snuck out? Where did she go?",
        "Parker: I don't know, but she's not picking up her phone. She didn't leave me a note. I am worried about her.",
        "Carly: Well, she probably just went for a walk. I'm sure after all that time in the hospital, she'll appreciate some fresh air.",
        "Parker: Well, she shouldn't be alone. I mean, she still gets dizzy. She's very tired.",
        "Carly: Parker, I'm sure she's not gonna go far.",
        "Parker: She has her chemo treatments later.",
        "Carly: Which is why she probably wants to take a walk now while she's feeling well. You know what it's like after her treatments.",
        "Parker: Why are you taking her side?",
        "Carly: I am not. I'm not taking anybody's side. I'm just saying, I can understand why she'd want some sunshine, especially if she knows she's gonna feel sick for most of the night. I do understand why you're worried.",
        "Parker: Thank you.",
        "Carly: Can I offer you a little advice?",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Carly: Keep those concerns to yourself. Don't smother her.",
        "Parker: I just want her to be safe, okay. What if the reason she's not picking up her phone is because she's passed out in some ditch somewhere? Why couldn't she have at least just left me a note letting me know where she was going?",
        "Carly: Probably because she knows that you'd overreact and follow her just like --",
        "Parker: Like who?",
        "Carly: Like your father.",
        "Parker: You know what? I wish. I mean, Dad always knows exactly what to do. He doesn't even have to think about it. He just takes care of it.",
        "Carly: Yes, he does, and I love him for it, but it also drives me crazy. Parker, you can't make other people's decisions for them. You have to let Liberty find her own way.",
        "Parker: What if what she's doing is dangerous.",
        "Carly: You'll be there for her if something goes wrong, but for right now, back off. Let her make her own choices.",
        "Parker: Mom, she's still sick, and she could die. I get what you're saying, I really do, but as far as Liberty's concerned, I'm not gonna back off, because watching her risk her life for something just as stupid as fresh air, just -- I don't like it.",
        "Carly: Yep. Just what Jack would say.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What are you doing up there?",
        "Gabriel: Fixing the wiring so you don't burn down the entire block.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't like you looking over my shoulder when I'm working.",
        "Gabriel: Ditto. So let me do my job. I'll let you do yours.",
        "Craig: You know, I don't like you, but for some reason, Carly's drawn a line in the sand where you're concerned, but that doesn't mean I have to make it pleasant.",
        "Gabriel: Look, whatever. I just want my money and I want to go home.",
        "Craig: The sooner, the better. In fact, forget what you're doing there. I have another job for you. I want you to go over to Al's and pick up two roast-beef sandwiches.",
        "Gabriel: I'm not a caterer.",
        "Craig: You are whatever I say you are. Right now you're a delivery boy.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, Mr. Boss man. You call the shots. For now.",
        "Craig: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Gabriel: Oh, mayo or mustard?",
        "Craig: Both.",
        "Gabriel: How'd I know that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waitress: Hey, forget about the menu, Lib. We can make you whatever you want.",
        "Liberty: I thought I would kill for an Al's burger, but now that I'm here, I am not hungry.",
        "Gabriel: Excuse me. I need a couple of roast-beef sandwiches with mustard, mayo, and arsenic, heavy on the arsenic. I'm just kidding. You can put the arsenic on the side. Thank you. Not hungry?",
        "Liberty: I've been eating hospital food for months.",
        "Gabriel: Mmm. Green Jell-O and chocolate pudding. Got to love it.",
        "Liberty: I don't know why they're so opposed to anything that crunches.",
        "Gabriel: Eh, too strenuous.",
        "Liberty: Too enjoyable, probably. When I was in there, all I could think about was an Al's burger and fries, but now, not so much.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, chemo's really messing you up, huh?",
        "Liberty: You remembered about the chemo?",
        "Gabriel: Well, cancer is kind of a big deal, plus, there's the hat.",
        "Liberty: I'm so used to it, I forget it's there.",
        "Gabriel: So, where's your boyfriend/bodyguard?",
        "Liberty: Parker's not my boyfriend. We're just good friends.",
        "Gabriel: Who used to be married? I just mean you mentioned that outside the bookstore.",
        "Liberty: Do you have, like, a photographic memory?",
        "Gabriel: No. I just mean it's weird. Weren't you like 12 years old?",
        "Liberty: It's a long story.",
        "Waitress: Okay. Your order will be ready in five.",
        "Gabriel: Actually, you know, the boss can wait. The lady is hungry. She'll have a grilled cheese. Go easy on the butter. And white rice instead of fries and plastic utensils instead of metal ones.",
        "Liberty: How did you know that silverware tastes funny?",
        "Gabriel: Well, I saw it in a movie once.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I was just filling Dusty in on the investigation.",
        "Janet: Well, do you have any new leads? I'd settle for one right now. Margo's got forensics taking a second pass of the scene in case we missed something.",
        "Janet: Oh, Jack, you don't miss anything.",
        "Jack: Listen, I'm doing everything I can to find the guy who did this to him, but in the meantime, you've got to take care of yourself and the baby. I don't like the idea of you spending so much time at the hospital.",
        "Dusty: I agree.",
        "Janet: Hey, hey, hey, you two! No ganging up on me! You just don't think I'm capable to know when I've had enough.",
        "Jack: No. That's not what I said at all.",
        "Janet: Stop it, now, all right? I know when I need to take a rest. Don't argue with me, Donovan. I'm stronger than you are right now.",
        "Dusty: Did you find the doctor.",
        "Janet: Yes, I did, and he said that if the tests come back the way he hopes they will, you'll be able to go home today.",
        "Jack: All right. I'm gonna check in with Margo, see if there's anything new on the case.",
        "Janet: Oh, finally. I'll be able to sleep tonight in bed knowing that no one I love is in the hospital. Do you know how long it's been since I've been able to say that?",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry I worried you.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? This is what love is. You've got to be willing to take the bad with the good.",
        "Dusty: You sure I'm worth it?",
        "Janet: Oh, you are so, so worth it. And you know what? You're gonna have plenty of chances to take care of me when I am eight months pregnant and my feet are a distant memory, but right now it's time for me to take care of you. In fact, I don't want you to do any heavy lifting, so I hired movers to move us into the house, okay? I don't want you so much as hanging a picture frame.",
        "Dusty: Janet.",
        "Janet: And Liberty and I decided that the basement will be your man cave!",
        "Dusty: Janet, I can't move in with you.",
        "Janet: You just had surgery. You're gonna need somebody to take care of you, and that person is gonna be me, so you're stuck with me. Hey, we're family. We may not be married yet, but we're committed to each other.",
        "Dusty: Not for this.",
        "Janet: Listen, when one person is down, the other person has to do the heavy lifting, and that's gonna be me. Let me ask you something, and I want you to give me an honest answer. Have you changed your mind about marrying me?",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Janet: Okay, then. Pretty soon we're gonna be taking those vows, you know, in sickness and in health. It's time to start walking the walk.",
        "Dusty: Some day. Not now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Did the video guy check out the surveillance tapes? Well, there's got to be a reflection somewhere. What about forensics? Anything off the bullet fragment? Okay. Can you please tell them to review it again? This was not the perfect crime. I guarantee it.",
        "Carly: Is everything okay?",
        "Jack: I'd be better if we found something to lead to Dusty's shooter. Other than that, yeah, everything's fine. What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: Well, I -- here.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Carly: I had a long talk with Parker this morning about becoming too invested in what's happening with Liberty.",
        "Jack: Did he listen?",
        "Carly: He seemed to, and then he told me to back off and let him do what he needs to do. If I'd closed my eyes, I might have thought I was listening to you.",
        "Jack: I'm not following.",
        "Carly: You're doing the same thing with Janet and Dusty.",
        "Jack: I'm doing my job. Carly, Dusty's still out of it. He remembers some things, but the little things, like dialing the phone, he has no clue how to do that.",
        "Carly: That'll all come back, won't it?",
        "Jack: There are no guarantees. And he remembers absolutely nothing about the shooting. That's why I'm racking my brain trying to find a new lead.",
        "Carly: So that's why you're at the hospital with Janet and Dusty, 'cause Dusty can't help you with the case.",
        "Jack: Listen, with any luck, he's gonna be discharged today. He's gonna need help walking and getting in and out of his car. Janet, she can't take care of that in her condition.",
        "Carly: And you want to be there in case anything goes wrong, like it did with Brad.",
        "Jack: Brad has nothing to do with this.",
        "Carly: Of course he does. Janet and Brad is the same thing. It's guilt, your guilt. You don't have to feel guilty about this, Jack. People break up every --",
        "Jack: What's wrong? Hey!",
        "Carly: Let her go.",
        "Jack: I -- I can't. I gave Dusty my word.",
        "Carly: What the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Thank you for this. I actually forgot about cancer for a few minutes. You're a good guy, Gabriel.",
        "Gabriel: Well, tell that to my boss. He thinks I'm into fashion espionage or something.",
        "Liberty: I hope he's not too hungry.",
        "Gabriel: I hope he's starving.",
        "Liberty: Ooh.",
        "Gabriel: Still, I better go. But, you know, in case you have any menu questions in the future, here's my cell.",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",
        "Gabriel: And, hey, welcome back to the human race.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm getting dizzy just watching you. All right, that's enough. You want a soda?",
        "Johnny: I'm hungry.",
        "Craig: Yeah, you and me both. The food should have been here by now. It's about time. Food's here.",
        "Johnny: That's the guy who talked to me on the playground.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just trying to get out of this hospital as soon as I can.",
        "Carly: Jack said he made you a promise.",
        "Dusty: That's between me and Jack.",
        "Carly: Oh, think again. What did you just say to Janet that made her go running out of here, crying?",
        "Dusty: Did Jack go after her?",
        "Carly: What do you think?",
        "Dusty: Good. Can I borrow your phone?",
        "Carly: Where's yours?",
        "Dusty: I haven't gotten it back yet. I just want to make a call to a driver to get me out of here.",
        "Carly: Oh, that's funny.",
        "Dusty: What is?",
        "Carly: Well, Jack just mentioned to me that you can't remember how to dial a phone, but you seem to be doing a good job there, which means one of you is lying, and my money's on you. You did just fine for a man who can't remember how to use a phone. This isn't even yours. You managed. What gives?",
        "Dusty: I'm having problems with my memory. The doctor said that the bullet did some kind of damage.",
        "Carly: But you can't remember, exactly.",
        "Dusty: No. You can ask the doctor if you don't believe me.",
        "Carly: No, I don't need to. Look, I have no doubt that you have brain damage. What I don't understand is why you want people to think it's worse than it is.",
        "Dusty: I have my reasons.",
        "Carly: Such as?",
        "Dusty: Would you hand me my watch, please? I'll trade you. If I don't answer your question, you're gonna go to Jack, won't you?",
        "Carly: Count on it.",
        "Dusty: All right. Well, I told Jack that I didn't remember anything about the shooting, but that's not true. I remember bits and pieces.",
        "Carly: Like what?",
        "Dusty: Like -- whoever did it was close to Janet's family. I never saw the guy before, but it was a professional hit.",
        "Carly: You think so? By who? Like, the mob or something?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Ralph Manzo or Janet's father.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God.",
        "Dusty: Either way, Janet's stuck in the middle. That's why he can't tell Janet. The cops can't know about this. It'll make these guys hide.",
        "Carly: But whoever put this hit out on you, I mean, they're gonna want to come back and finish the job.",
        "Dusty: I'll be waiting for them.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. I don't like this, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I got to make sure Janet's safe. It's too dangerous for me to be around them right now. Jack promised me that he would look after Janet, and I know this doesn't make things easy on you, but I had no choice. I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: So what happens now?",
        "Dusty: Once I know Janet's safe, I'll get word to her family that I'm starting to remember things.",
        "Carly: Why would you -- oh, no. You're gonna use yourself as bait, aren't you? You actually want them to come back and try to kill you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You know, he's just trying to protect me. That's why he's treating me like this.",
        "Jack: You don't know that.",
        "Janet: Yes, it is. If you guys had that guy who shot him in custody, he wouldn't be doing this to me.",
        "Jack: Come on. I really don't think he's thinking all that clearly right now.",
        "Janet: You know something, don't you?",
        "Jack: Janet --",
        "Janet: Come on, Jack! If you know who shot Dusty, you have to tell me right now.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Rocco: Jan.",
        "Janet: Hi, Pop.",
        "Rocco: What's wrong, Baby? Looks like you've been crying. Did something happen to Dusty?",
        "Janet: No, he's fine. He's out of the hospital.",
        "Rocco: Really? That's good news. So, what's the problem?",
        "Janet: Hey, don't start in on Jack, okay? He's just trying to help.",
        "Rocco: Yeah. Seems to be doing a real good job with that.",
        "Jack: You know what? I'm gonna go grab the car, and then I'm taking you back to Carly's. No arguments.",
        "Janet: Okay.",
        "Rocco: That guy just don't know when to stop being a cop, does he?",
        "Janet: Hey, hey. He is a good man, and I'm not sorry that I married him.",
        "Rocco: So why didn't you stay married? I'm just asking, as your father.",
        "Janet: Come here, Pop. Sit down. Sit down. Things happen, right? I honestly thought I was gonna be married to Jack forever, but things didn't work out, and I didn't think I'd ever find another man that I loved as much, and then along came Dusty.",
        "Rocco: I don't know him too well yet, but at least he's not a cop. But on the other hand --",
        "Janet: Hey, don't say anything bad about Dusty, okay? He invited me and Liberty and the baby into his life, and he is not asking for anything in return.",
        "Rocco: There's always something.",
        "Janet: Yeah, maybe for you. I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't -- I didn't mean it.",
        "Rocco: It's fine. It's nothing I don't deserve.",
        "Janet: It's just, Dusty's different, you know? And the only reason that he's pushing me away is because he wants to protect me, but I don't want his protection. All I want is him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Johnny: Dad, can I have your pickle?",
        "Craig: Sure, you can. Tell you what, why don't you take your sandwich in the back, turn on the TV, and I'll be there in two minutes.",
        "Gabriel: All right. Careful, little man.",
        "Johnny: I will be.",
        "Craig: Did you have fun? Stalking me.",
        "Gabriel: Excuse me?",
        "Craig: Breaking into my room, scaring the hell out of me in that elevator.",
        "Gabriel: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Craig: My son recognized you. You're the one that stopped him on the playground. You asked questions about me. You broke into my room and stole confidential documents. You're the one that sent me that threatening note with those ridiculous cut-out letters. What is this? What the hell do you want?",
        "Gabriel: Well, you seem to have all the answers. Why don't you tell me?",
        "Craig: No, I've got a better idea. I'll just call the police.",
        "Gabriel: I would rethink that if I were you.",
        "Craig: Why would I want to do that?",
        "Gabriel: Well, you call the cops, they start asking questions, I'll have to tell them you're stealing Parker Snyder's trust fund money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Liberty: Hi! You should try this. It's awesome.",
        "Parker: No, thanks. I thought you couldn't taste anything.",
        "Liberty: Apparently I can taste pie.",
        "Parker: Where have you been? I've been looking for you all over the place, and you're not picking up your cell phone.",
        "Liberty: I turned the ringer off. It's annoying to the other customers.",
        "Parker: So what?",
        "Liberty: So, it's rude.",
        "Parker: What were you thinking disappearing on me like that?",
        "Liberty: Um, I'm living like a normal person, and it's about time.",
        "Parker: Well, you're not normal, Liberty. You're --",
        "Liberty: I'm what? Cancer girl? Number 23 in a groundbreaking new clinical trial? The teenager with no hair?",
        "Parker: You have leukemia. You can't just act like you don't.",
        "Liberty: You wonder why I left the house without waking you up. I had to get out of there, okay? I had to get away from you so I could breathe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. Are you -- are you out of your mind?! You are lucky to be alive, and the next time, the shooter's gonna be more accurate, believe me.",
        "Dusty: I'll be ready for him.",
        "Carly: How? By making yourself a human target?",
        "Dusty: If I don't, how are we gonna find out who wants me dead?",
        "Carly: Fine. Go ahead. Walk out. Paint a bull's-eye on your chest, but don't expect me to keep my mouth shut about it.",
        "Dusty: You have to.",
        "Carly: This is not the way to protect Janet.",
        "Dusty: What about Jack? Either Jack goes after Rocco, Ralph, and their whole crew or he looks after Janet while I do. Your call. A few simple touches can make a big difference.",
        "Carly: Jack won't be taking those guys on by himself. He'll have backup.",
        "Dusty: You know how he gets. When it's personal, he's not gonna wait for the cavalry.",
        "Carly: That's true. And he's not gonna back away from this case until he finds out who shot you.",
        "Dusty: I asked him to take care of Janet. He said he would.",
        "Carly: Good. So Jack's gonna be holding Janet's hand night and day because you pushed her away. And what happens if you get yourself killed?",
        "Dusty: You got to trust that Jack loves you. Where's my --",
        "Carly: It's right -- I have it. Don't you remember that? This isn't all an act, is it? You're not all the way back, are you?",
        "Dusty: That's why I need your help.",
        "Carly: Okay. I won't tell Jack what you're up to. Don't make me regret it, okay?",
        "Dusty: There's something else. I'm gonna be armed and ready, but somebody's got to bait the trap.",
        "Carly: Why don't I just shoot you myself and get it over with?",
        "Dusty: Is that a yes?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Don't make up stories about me to get yourself off the hook. That's not a fight you can win.",
        "Gabriel: We both know I'm not making up anything, okay? You're financing this company with that kid's trust fund money. You're having your accountant make up phony books to cover your tracks.",
        "Craig: How do you know that?",
        "Gabriel: Careful, careful. We don't want junior to find out his dad's a crook, right?",
        "Craig: You can't prove a thing.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, maybe. Maybe not. That's your call, Mr. Boss man. Go ahead. Call my bluff. Call the chief. Call your sister. Tell her I'm making up stories. Yeah, I'm sure she'd believe you.",
        "Craig: What do you want from me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, but the truth is, it's really hard sometimes.",
        "Parker: Dealing with me is hard.",
        "Liberty: Last night you fell asleep in a chair because you were watching over me.",
        "Parker: I was worried that you'd be cold. Okay, I could have given you a blanket, but it's not your house. I didn't want you to wake up and not know where you were.",
        "Liberty: It's not exactly like your house is some strange place.",
        "Parker: My mom wants me to back off of you, and she says that you'll let me know when you need help, but I know you. You're never gonna ask for help. You're gonna try to tough it out on your own.",
        "Liberty: I am sort of a pain that way.",
        "Parker: So, how do I back off when I really care?",
        "Liberty: I don't want you to stop caring, Parker. Just give me some space. Go do something you want to do for a change.",
        "Parker: I'll just worry about you.",
        "Liberty: Do it anyway. It might make you feel better. I'll be okay. I just need to go out and get a grilled cheese once in a while, you know, pretend I'm normal even if I'm not.",
        "Parker: Sorry I said that.",
        "Liberty: You've said a lot worse to me before. Just stop treating me like a child or a ghost. It's too much pressure.",
        "Parker: Okay. I'll try to back off.",
        "Liberty: Try?",
        "Parker: I will.",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "Parker: I'd offer you a ride home. However, I assume that that is not really --",
        "Liberty: I'm good.",
        "Parker: Good.",
        "Liberty: But I will see you there later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Would you two give me some breathing room? All this hovering is driving me nuts!",
        "Jack: You need to take better care of yourself.",
        "Rocco: The man's right. You can't be too careful in your condition.",
        "Carly: That's just what Dusty would say. In fact, it's what he did say, just before I left the hospital.",
        "Janet: You saw him?",
        "Carly: Yeah, just now.",
        "Janet: I thought he was leaving the hospital. Did something -- was something wrong with his tests?",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Not that I know of. He seems to be handling things.",
        "Janet: Oh, good. Then I'll go see him.",
        "Jack: No, absolutely not. What you need is to get something to eat and then get some rest.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'll get you a sandwich.",
        "Rocco: What did Dusty really say? It won't go any further. You can trust me.",
        "Carly: He's doing really well. He just doesn't want to be a burden to Janet.",
        "Rocco: Thoughtful.",
        "Carly: He's checking out of the hospital as we speak. He's gonna head over to metro. He wants to clean things up. He's determined to get his life back.",
        "Rocco: That's admirable, but how? From what I heard, the guy can't even do the simple things.",
        "Carly: The doctor said he's recovering so fast, he could get his memory back at any time.",
        "Rocco: All of it?",
        "Carly: Apparently.",
        "Rocco: What exactly did the doctor say?",
        "Carly: Well, just that, as the swelling goes down in his brain, his memories are gonna come flooding back. He'll be as good as new. Thank God, right?",
        "Rocco: Thank God is right. In fact, I may go light a candle for him right now. Take care of her, Jack. I'll be back soon.",
        "Janet: What's wrong with Pop? He barely even said goodbye. Dusty Donovan -- d-o-n-o -- right, right. He's Dr. Oliver's patient. I'm his fianc\u00e9e. Really? Thank you.",
        "Carly: Something wrong?",
        "Janet: He checked himself out of the hospital. He didn't even call me.",
        "Jack: He told you that's what he was planning to do.",
        "Janet: Yeah, he did. I'll be right back.",
        "Carly: You know what? Maybe that's not such a good idea. If Dusty wants some time to himself --",
        "Janet: I'm not going to look for Dusty. He told me to leave him alone, and as much as I hate it, I'm gonna respect his wishes.",
        "Carly: Well, then, where are you going?",
        "Jack: I'm doing it again, aren't I?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Thank you so much. That was the best meal I have ever eaten. But don't tell my mom I said that. Hey, Gabriel. It's Liberty. I was thinking, if you're free after work, maybe we could hang out? Okay. Call me when you get this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You're not serious.",
        "Gabriel: Well, it's only money, right? And there's plenty of trust fund to go around, right?",
        "Craig: What kind of money are we talking about here?",
        "Gabriel: I'd say my silence is worth six figures, maybe seven.",
        "Craig: Kid, you're delusional.",
        "Gabriel: Well, you're a thief.",
        "Craig: No. I admit, I borrowed money from Parker's trust, but I also plan to pay it all back once the company's up and running.",
        "Gabriel: I would still call that stealing.",
        "Craig: I can't withdraw that kind of cash without raising all kinds of red flags.",
        "Gabriel: It doesn't have to be a lump sum, okay? Let's just call it an allowance.",
        "Craig: I call it blackmail.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, whatever, okay? As long as I get what I need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're right. You've been right all along. I'm too involved in Janet and Dusty's life.",
        "Carly: I'm glad you see that.",
        "Jack: I know that Janet's not gonna do anything that'll be bad for the baby.",
        "Carly: Of course she's not.",
        "Jack: And Dusty is a grown-up. He's a grown man. If he feels he needs to, I don't know, stand on his own, that's his business.",
        "Carly: But what if he's not as ready as he thinks he is? What if it's dangerous?",
        "Jack: I thought you wanted me to back off.",
        "Carly: I do. I do. And I know that Dusty's smart, right, so if he needs help, he'll call and ask for it. Right now I have you to myself, and I'm gonna be selfish about that.",
        "Jack: Oh, no. You're not being -- you're not being selfish. Far from it.",
        "Carly: I know you have a lot on your mind.",
        "Jack: You and the kids are my top priority. Never forget that. If it -- if it ever seems like I'm forgetting it, then you need to remind me and bring me back to what's important. Carly, I love you. I never want you to doubt that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Come on. Where'd you put it? Damn. What's the combination? I can't remember.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Craig: I'm gonna make you very sorry you ever crossed me.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, what? Like your son Brian?",
        "Janet: Pop, are you all right? Pop? Oh, my God!",
        "Janet: Because of you, my father might die.",
        "Jack: Dusty never should have involved you in any of this. It just made matters worse for all of us."
