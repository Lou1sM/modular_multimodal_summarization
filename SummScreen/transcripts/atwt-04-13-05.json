        "Keith: Yeah, right, it was a phone booth.\r\n",
        "Jack: Yes, it was a phone booth outside a \r\nconvenience store on the corner of Division and 14th. ",
        "Keith: Okay. Did you check it out? \r\n",
        "Jack: For what? ",

        "Jack: Yeah, yeah. I thought you were playing \r\nwith Parker. Don't tell me they were fighting again. ",
        "Carly: No, no, they were getting along fine. \r\nI got a call from a social worker who told me to bring J.J. here. ",
        "Jack: Social worker? ",

        "Mike: No, no, it's out of the question. And \r\nif you think that's going to get us anything but trouble, you need to go back to \r\nthat hospital that you were in last year. ",
        "Barbara: You know, you're the one who's not \r\nclearly here. You two love each other. You've started a life together. No one \r\nwould know that this baby is not yours, so why would anyone have to know? \r\n",
        "Mike: I would know. And so would Jennifer.\r\n",
        "Barbara: We need to protect her. ",
        "Mike: From what? ",

        "Mike: Lying's not the answer. ",
        "Barbara: You know, maybe I was wrong about \r\nyou. I thought you loved my daughter, and that you were looking out for her.\r\n",
        "Mike: I am, but I\u2019m not going to sit here and \r\nmake up a bunch of -- ",

        "Paul: What do you want, Jennifer? ",
        "Jennifer: Well, if you asked me a few weeks \r\nago, even a few days ago, I would've said a life with Mike and a successful \r\ncareer. ",
        "Paul: And now? ",
        "Jennifer: Now, I'm just exhausted. You know, \r\nI can't eat, i can't sleep and I have all these conflicting thoughts just \r\ncrashing around in my head, and I just want to close my eyes and make them all \r\ngo away. ",
        "Paul: Jennifer, this isn't going to go away. \r\nYou need a plan. Do you have a plan? ",
        "Jennifer: Well, it would be a whole lot \r\neasier if this baby were Mike\u2019s. ",
        "Paul: Well, that's significant. Are you \r\nsaying there's a part of you that wants to keep this baby? ",
        "Jennifer: If this baby were Mike's, then he \r\nwould still be in the equation. One -- one mistake I made and -- and my life is \r\nruined. ",
        "Paul: Jennifer, your life isn't ruined. \r\nMike's still here. ",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, for the moment. But even he \r\nadmitted that he doesn't know how he'll feel down the line. And whatever choice \r\nI make, I really don't think that he and I can recover from this. ",

        "Jennifer: He's been very careful not to weigh \r\nin on that. He says the decision is mine. But I know that -- that having this \r\nbaby will change everything. Having Craig\u2019s baby, living with a constant \r\nreminder of how I betrayed him, how -- how can you ask that of any man? I mean, \r\ncould you do it? ",
        "Paul: I'm not Mike. ",
        "Jennifer: You couldn't do it, could you? It \r\nreally is too much to ask. ",
        "",
        "Mike: I don't care what you think about me. I \r\nonly care what Jennifer thinks. I told her not to make any hasty decisions on \r\naccount of me, that I would accept whatever choice she makes. ",
        "Barbara: And you're willing to live with \r\nthat? ",
        "Mike: Look, she's trying to make up her mind, \r\nso I'm not going to sit there and tell her -- ",
        "Barbara: She's basing her decision on what \r\nyou're going to do. That's why she ran off to this clinic. She's scared to death \r\nthat you're going to leave her! ",
        "Mike: No, don't -- don't pressure me. Okay? \r\nIt's not fair to me or to Jennifer. ",
        "Barbara: And what about that precious baby \r\nshe's carrying? Do you think it's fair to it to be raised with Craig Montgomery \r\nas a father? ",
        "Mike: Fair or not, Craig is the baby's \r\nfather. There's nothing we can do to change that. ",
        "Barbara: We can change that. And we can keep \r\nyou and Jennifer together and make sure that that little baby is not raised with \r\na lifetime of misery. Just say yes. ",
