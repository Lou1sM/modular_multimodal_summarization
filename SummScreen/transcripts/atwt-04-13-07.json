        "Katie: Where are you?",
        "Jack: Talking to yourself is the first sign.",
        "Katie: Of insanity?",
        "Jack: Exhaustion. Go home. I'll find Henry.",
        "Katie: No, we have to keep looking. He's around here, and close. I know, I can feel it.",
        "Jack: Well, you've had that feeling all night. And what are you going to do when you see him?",
        "Katie: I'm just going to be there for him. He's been through a traumatic experience.",
        "Jack: He's been through a traumatic experience? What about Vienna?",
        "Katie: Come on. There has to be at least one bar that we didn't check.",
        "Jack: This is useless. He's probably left town.",
        "Katie: No, he wouldn't leave town. He wouldn't leave his little sister.",
        "Jack: Just his bride to be.",
        "Katie: Stop talking about my friend that way. Okay, I know Henry. He hides. He doesn't run.",
        "Jack: Well, he should hide after what he did.",
        "Katie: Okay, he didn't love Vienna, so not marrying her was actually a kindness, if you think about it.",
        "Jack: Well, it would have been kinder for Henry to think about it before the wedding. Instead, he puts it off until everyone's waiting for him to say, \"I do.\"",
        "Katie: Well, if I think about it, I think she pushed him too hard and way too fast. She pushed him to take all her money. She pushed him to live together --",
        "Jack: No, Henry wanted to be pushed.",
        "Katie: Oh, so he's just a big marshmallow? Yeah, everybody knows that, especially Vienna, and she used it to her advantage. She plied him with liquor and nice things. Of course he's going to say that he's going to marry her!",
        "Jack: Katie, she loved him.",
        "Katie: Maybe in her own weird way, she did. But if she really, really loved him, she would have seen his signals. Any fool could tell that Henry wasn't ready to get married, but she didn't care! So if you ask me, this is all on her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Whoa.",
        "Emma: Have you seen Vienna?",
        "Brad: No, no. Her door's closed. She's probably hung over from nursing her sorrows.",
        "Emma: Oh, no. Nobody's in her room. Somebody's been into my elderberry wine. And where did you get that bottle?",
        "Brad: It was right here. It was in the middle of the floor.",
        "Emma: Maybe she came down. It wasn't here a few moments ago. In the meanwhile, she might've come down here. [Vienna hiccups] Vienna? What are you doing under the table?",
        "Vienna: I'm waiting for someone to kiss the bride.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You might want to button your shirt.",
        "Alison: Do you have to be on me every minute?",
        "Emily: Mom's going to be here any minute.",
        "Alison: And what do you think? A little cleavage and magically she's going to know I'm a porn star?",
        "Emily: I think she's going to want you to button your shirt.",
        "Alison: You know, if we had just gone home instead of staying here at the hotel, I could have surprised Mom in our kitchen, over French toast.",
        "Emily: I thought I already explained to you --",
        "Alison: Right, we got into town too late and Mom was working a double. That's so lame. You were just trying to keep me hidden in case I went into withdrawal or whatever you were expecting.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm really glad you didn't.",
        "Alison: I told you, Emily. I'm not some sort of tweaked out addict. I've used meth like three times, it's not a big deal.",
        "Emily: Okay. The thing about being an editor of a newspaper is I can read, and I read a lot. And there are a lot of articles that say even if you use meth once, you can get hooked. So even if I believed you used it three times, it wouldn't set my mind at ease.",
        "Alison: I really hate you sometimes. You know that?",
        "Emily: Maybe Mom's in the dining room.",
        "Alison: So go check.",
        "Emily: I think I'll call her.",
        "Alison: Emily, the dining room is 50 feet away. Just go walk over there.",
        "Emily: I'm not going to leave you here, Alison.",
        "Alison: If I was going to run out on you, I'd be gone by now, believe me.",
        "Emily: I'll be right back.",
        "Alison: I'll be right here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So do you look at me and think -- desk clerk?",
        "Will: I don't know. Say, \"I hope you enjoy your stay, Mr. Munson.\"",
        "Gwen: I hope you enjoy your stay, Mr. Munson.",
        "Will: That sounded pretty good. It makes me want to kiss you. Is that good?",
        "Gwen: Kind of.",
        "Will: I think you could manage this whole place by yourself.",
        "Gwen: Thank you. But unfortunately, desk clerk is the only job available and we need the money.",
        "Will: Yeah, I could always go back to the hospital and mop the floors and everything.",
        "Gwen: No. We'll get more money for this with less hours. Which means we'll have time for classes and spending time together. Stop it.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: Stop thinking that you shouldn't have turned down your mom's offer to set up another trust fund.",
        "Will: How do you know what I'm thinking?",
        "Gwen: Because I know you. And I know that we're better off without that money.",
        "Will: Right, because the tougher things are, the happier we are.",
        "Gwen: Yes. Because we're crazy.",
        "Will: I truly wish you didn't have to work.",
        "Gwen: I like working. And I think it'll be really good for me to do something that doesn't involve music. Help me get over the whole Adam thing and maybe I can be a real wife to you again.",
        "Will: Why do you keep saying things like that?",
        "Gwen: Wish me luck.",
        "Will: Gwen '",
        "Alison: Will? Is that you?",
        "Will: Ali? Hi!",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cleo: Hey. What are you doing here? Hold on.",
        "Jade: I thought you country girls were early risers.",
        "Cleo: Well, first of all, I'm from California. And second of all, the bed's really comfortable. Hey, what about the suitcases? Are you going to come stay with me?",
        "Jade: No. I brought supplies. Help me get this on the bed.",
        "Cleo: This is pretty heavy. What do you have in there?",
        "Jade: Everything we need to change you into Gwen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Alison: What kind of best friend are you, Munson? You don't call. You don't write. I thought I was the love of your life.",
        "Will: Well, you thought I was a stalker.",
        "Alison: That, too. You look great! I didn't realize how much I missed you until I saw you.",
        "Will: So you never thought about me?",
        "Alison: Oh, just on lonely nights when I needed a pal.",
        "Will: Hey, if you need a friend, you know I'm there. So what are you doing here? Are you back to stay or are you just visiting?",
        "Alison: Tell me something. Why does anybody stay in this town? It's totally dead.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess it's not much compared to Seattle.",
        "Alison: Oh, I haven't lived in Seattle forever. I moved to L.A. and then to Vegas.",
        "Will: Really? Alone?",
        "Alison: That's the way I like it.",
        "Will: So what did you do in L.A.? Are you trying to be a movie star?",
        "Alison: We have got to catch up, but I'm here with Emily and we're meeting my mom, so I should probably go.",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. Let me give you my number, because I've got a lot to tell you. The last time you were here, I was a real mess, so --",
        "Alison: Aw, you were just a kid in high school. And you were madly in love with me. What's so messed up about that?",
        "Will: Yeah. Did you hear that I got married?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Alison: To who? Do I know her?",
        "Will: Gwen Norbeck.",
        "Alison: Gwen? I totally set you two up!",
        "Will: I know, I guess we owe you, like, dinner or something.",
        "Alison: You hated her. After that first date, you said you never wanted to see you again.",
        "Will: Well, that date was doomed from the start, because I knew you were setting me up with her just to get over you.",
        "Alison: Well, it looks like it worked.",
        "Will: Yeah. Gwen's just about the best thing that ever happened to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cleo shrieks]",
        "Cleo: I feel like I died and went to the mall! Oh, my God! Where did you get money for all this stuff?",
        "Jade: I have an aunt with money to burn. Put these on.",
        "Cleo: All right.",
        "Cleo: What's wrong?",
        "Jade: We have got to do something about your teeth.",
        "Cleo: But I thought that you were going to talk to a dentist, that's why you had me bite into that plastic thingie? I haven't had to do that since I got my own braces in the seventh grade.",
        "Jade: Yeah, right. Here, these are going to make your teeth look more like Gwen's.",
        "Cleo: This looks really uncomfortable. Can't I just smile with my mouth closed?",
        "Jade: No. You can try it on later.",
        "Cleo: Hey, what's all that stuff?",
        "Jade: This is Gwen's life, starting with the most important person in it. Her husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Come on, Darlin'. Let's go.",
        "Vienna: I want to be a wife.",
        "Brad: Come on. Good girl.",
        "Vienna: I want to be on my honeymoon.",
        "Emma: Yes.",
        "Vienna: I want Henry!",
        "Emma: Yes, I'm sure you do. Now, let me just have that bottle.",
        "Vienna: Where -- where is Henry? Why hasn't he come back for me?",
        "Brad: Hey, anybody up for wedding cake and coffee?",
        "Emma: Just stop it!",
        "Vienna: You know, Brad, he didn't think that there would be a wedding. No, you said that this wouldn't -- this wouldn't last. And I should have trusted you.",
        "Brad: When I'm right, I'm right.",
        "Emma: Come on, Sweetheart, let me have the bottle. I'll make you some nice bacon and eggs.",
        "Vienna: Oh, and herring and filmjolk.",
        "Brad: What's filmjolk?",
        "Emma: Anything you want. Just give me the bottle.",
        "Vienna: No, I want Henry! Why did he promise to marry me if he didn't love me?",
        "Brad: Well, I can think of a few reasons.",
        "Vienna: No, this -- this was supposed to be the first day of the rest of my life. And now my life is over.",
        "Emma: No, it's not. It's not. Things are going to feel a lot better when you get a little sleep.",
        "Vienna: No, because every time I close my eyes, I see -- i see Henry. Standing there, so tall and handsome, and beautiful, telling me how sorry he was.",
        "Emma: I know, I know. I'm sure he is sorry. Now, just let me have the bottle --",
        "Vienna: You know what? He should be sorry! He lied!",
        "Brad: Sure did.",
        "Vienna: No, he lied! He promised me that he would be with me for the rest of his life. And it was all a lie! All of it was a lie!",
        "Brad: Sure was.",
        "Vienna: All men are liars!",
        "Brad: Okay, what are you doing?",
        "Emma: Sweetie, Sweetie, just put the knife down. Put it down!",
        "Vienna: No, not down -- not until I cut that cake!",
        "Jack: It's not like she put a gun to Henry's head. He's an adult. And when you're an adult, you take responsibility for your actions. Nobody should know that better than you and I.",
        "Katie: What are we doing?",
        "Jack: We both survived busted-up marriages, didn't we?",
        "Katie: Oh, don't remind me.",
        "Jack: No, and it wasn't one person's responsibility. Sure, I wanted to blame Carly at first, but you know, it was just as much my fault as it was hers. And you and Mike --",
        "Katie: No, that was all me. Mike was a perfect husband.",
        "Jack: Whoa, really? He was crazy about you, you're still nuts about him, and he still left. What's so perfect about that? You made one mistake.",
        "Katie: One mistake? I made a million mistakes, but thank you for trying to make me feel better.",
        "Jack: No, my point is, Henry knew what he was getting into with Vienna, just like you and I will know what we're getting into the next time --",
        "Katie: Next time, what?",
        "Jack: Next time we try again with someone else. [Cell phone rings] Excuse me. Snyder.",
        "Emma: Hey, Jack, listen, could you come out here right away? I mean, Vienna seems to have lost control over here. She has a knife.",
        "Jack: A knife? Is she pointing it at anyone?",
        "Emma: No. And it's only a cake knife, but --",
        "Vienna: Why did he -- I hate weddings! I hate it!",
        "Emma: Go after her, please, Brad. She might hurt herself, please.",
        "Brad: But she made mincemeat of the cake without getting her wedding dress dirty. I mean, how much harm can she do?",
        "Emma: Brad, go!",
        "Brad: I'll go.",
        "Emma: Please, Jack, how soon can you get here?",
        "Jack: I'm on my way.",
        "Katie: Vienna has a knife?",
        "Jack: I'm afraid so.",
        "Katie: And we're going to go back over there?",
        "Jack: No, maybe you should stay here, now that the stores are opening, you can question the shopkeepers to see if any of them saw Henry here last night. I'll call you as soon as I know something.",
        "Katie: Okay, promise. Because I really -- I really am worried about Vienna. I want to make sure that she's okay.",
        "Jack: She loved the man, Katie. It's going to be a long time before she's anywhere near okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You couldn't believe Gwen threw herself at you on the first date.",
        "Will: Yeah, it really freaked me out.",
        "Alison: Well, I guess you decided to finally like a woman who isn't afraid to be sexy.",
        "Will: That's one of the things I love about Gwen.",
        "Alison: Gwen!",
        "Gwen: Hey. Hey, Ali, how are you? Good to see you.",
        "Alison: Congratulations on grabbing the best guy this side of the Mississippi.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, thank you. So, what are you doing? Are you in town visiting your mom?",
        "Alison: I haven't even seen my mom yet. I guess I've been too busy flirting with will.",
        "Will: You can flirt with me any time.",
        "Gwen: So, how's Aaron?",
        "Alison: I wouldn't know. We broke up a while ago.",
        "Gwen: I'm sorry to hear that.",
        "Will: Yeah, I'm sorry, too. I thought you guys had something good going.",
        "Alison: Oh, that's not what you said when you were trying to convince me to dump Aaron for you.",
        "Gwen: Who are you dating now?",
        "Alison: Well, no one as wonderful as Will. And now that he's taken, I guess I'm out of luck around here.",
        "Will: Alison thinks Oakdale's a little dull compared to Vegas.",
        "Gwen: Oh, you live in Vegas? That's got to be exciting.",
        "Will: Yeah, you know what? You should come by Crash one time.",
        "Alison: What's that?",
        "Will: It's a club. Everybody hangs out there now. We should hang out. It would be good.",
        "Alison: I'd love to. Anything to get away from my sister.",
        "Emily: Hey.",
        "Will: Hi, Emily.",
        "Emily: Hi. Hey, guys, how are you doing? Mom's going to be here in a few minutes. So, let's head back to the table.",
        "Will: Ali, I'll give you a call.",
        "Alison: Or I'll call you. Remember, I have your number.",
        "Emily: Come on --",
        "Gwen: You gave her your number?",
        "Will: Yeah, sure. So, how did the job thing go?",
        "Gwen: Home or cell?",
        "Will: What?",
        "Gwen: What number did you give her?",
        "Will: I gave her both. I mean, it's really good to see her. I never thought that she would be coming back here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Why did you just take off like that?",
        "Alison: I went to go look for Mom in the lobby, and I ran into Will.",
        "Emily: I thought we agreed that you would wait for me at the table.",
        "Alison: We did not. And I'm an adult, Emily. I don't have to report every move I make to you.",
        "Emily: Where were you going? Were you trying to buy drugs?",
        "Alison: Could you please just cut me a break?",
        "Emily: Mom's here. Stay here.",
        "Susan: Hey, what is so important that I had to rush over here after working all night? Are you having some kind of crisis?",
        "Emily: No, no, no crisis.",
        "Alison: Hi, Mom.",
        "Susan: Alison! Oh, it's so good to see you. Oh, Baby, let me look at you.",
        "Alison: It's just the same old me.",
        "Susan: What are you doing here?",
        "Emily: She's decided to come home and spend some time with us for awhile.",
        "Susan: Uh-oh. You're in trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cleo: Carly Tenney Snyder. That's Gwen sister. And actually, Gwen didn't know it was her sister when she first met her. And Carly hated Gwen because Gwen was trying to get her baby back.",
        "Jade: Whose baby was it?",
        "Cleo: Right. Gwen thought it was her baby, but it wasn't. And before that, the baby was adopted by Carly's other sister, Rowena --",
        "Jade: Rosanna.",
        "Cleo: Right. Rosanna. And then Carly's dad slept with Gwen's mom.",
        "Jade: Whose name is?",
        "Cleo: Iris. And Carly and Gwen are okay now, or at least they were until Carly helped some guy steal all these diamonds and she had to leave town.",
        "Jade: Leaving behind?",
        "Cleo: Leaving behind her ex-husband Jack and their three kids. Gwen has two nephews and a niece. Parker, J.J. and Sage.",
        "Jade: Impressive.",
        "Cleo: Except I got Rosanna's name wrong. But I won't do that again.",
        "Jade: Well, I don't even remember telling you the names of Carly's kids. Have you been doing research on your own?",
        "Cleo: No, but you showed me a picture of Jack last night and you told me about the kids. And I stayed up all night studying. I'm going to have so much fun being Gwen.",
        "Jade: Well, you can't be Gwen unless you sound like her.",
        "Cleo: Well, I'm working on it. Don't worry about it.",
        "Jade: Okay, well, here are some dubs of Gwen's recording sessions in the studio. Here, you can hear her talking and singing.",
        "Cleo: Hey, wouldn't it be so cool if I could sing just like her, too?",
        "Jade: Let's just work on a few simple sentences first.",
        "Cleo: I'm going to be perfect. You'll see.",
        "Jade: Okay, well, you know, we'll work on it for a couple of hours and we'll see how far we get.",
        "Cleo: A couple more hours? I can't. I'm starving. I'm about to fall over because of lack of nourishment.",
        "Jade: Well, Cleo, we have to get this done.",
        "Cleo: And I have to eat. I skipped breakfast.",
        "Jade: Okay. Okay, we'll eat first, and then we'll work.",
        "Cleo: Thank you. I'm so hungry, I could probably eat my own pet.",
        "Jade: Wait, wait, wait. Look in the mirror. I have invested a lot in this surprise for Gwen. So that hair, and that face, and these clothes, and you, do not leave this room.",

        "Will: Alison looked different.",
        "Gwen: How?",
        "Will: I don't know. She's just wearing different clothes, I guess.",
        "Gwen: Like what?",
        "Will: I don't know, like she got a different style.",
        "Gwen: This is coming from the man who wears blue socks with brown pants, and you noticed her style? That's really incredible.",
        "Will: I wonder what she does in Vegas. Maybe she works in a casino.",
        "Gwen: You know, I don't know, I bet you can ask when she calls you up on your cell phone.",
        "Will: What's wrong with you?",
        "Gwen: Nothing. This is finished. I'm going to put it up on the desk, we can leave.",
        "Will: Wait, hold on, you're mad at me.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm not. I'm hungry.",
        "Will: Okay. So do you want to get some food in the lounge?",
        "Gwen: I don't want to stay here.",
        "Will: You've been acting weird ever since we ran into Alison. I thought you liked her.",
        "Gwen: I did like her. And you liked her, too. Actually, no, you were in love with her. So, it was just kind of weird to come in here and see the two of you guys with your arms around each other.",
        "Will: We're friends. We're hugging.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Never mind.",
        "Will: Well, I'm not going to forget about this. I'm actually going to mark this day down in my calendar, do you know that? I'm going to put a big gold star right next to it.",
        "Gwen: Why, because Alison came back into town?",
        "Will: No, because you're jealous.",

        "Katie: I thought about what you said. This isn't Vienna's fault. And I just wanted to see if I could help.",

        "Gwen: I was just trying to make conversation.",

        "Brad: Well, good luck with that one. Marriage, living together, any long-term love thing, I mean, that's what it is -- that's what it's about, isn't it? You know, you hurt each other, you forgive each other, you jump each other's bones, and then you start all over again. Hurt, forgive, jump. It's the cycle of life, Simba. Get over it.",
        "Henry: I can't. I can't, no, I can't. I can't break her heart again. I can't --",
        "Brad: So what are you going to do? Are you going to walk the earth forever in your tuxedo? You drunk?",
        "Henry: No, I'm not drunk. I'm stone cold sober. I'm so sober that I realized the best thing to do for Vienna, for everybody, is to make them think that I'm gone for good. So here. Just tell everybody I left forever.",

        "Katie: Some of it made sense.",
        "Jack: Katie --",
        "Katie: I can't help it. Sometimes I'm just scared that love really is a lost cause. She picked the wrong person, you picked the wrong person, I picked the wrong person. Maybe we're never going to get another chance to get it right.",

        "Will: Yeah, but I always come back.",

        "Henry: Then help her get over it. You've wanted her since the beginning. This is your big chance. If you want her to get past her pain, Brad, then grab the bull by the horns and make her forget about Henry Coleman forever.",

And that love should be able to be strong -- just as strong as the first. And it will last. You know, just because you're stronger or wiser, or you're just too stubborn to let it go.
