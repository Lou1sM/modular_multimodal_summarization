        "Carly and Craig share more alcohol, as they are happy with how things are working out; their night is interrupted by Parker, who has flown there to see Liberty, thanks to Jack. Parker is none to happy to hear Liberty is at a party. When Liberty comes home with her new young boss, Colin, in tow, Parker is angry and lashes out at Carly and Craig mostly but also at Liberty. Parker hurls insults at his mother, who he spits has become an alcoholic. Liberty storms out and Parker goes after her. Carly is hurt, as Craig tries to comfort her. Parker and Liberty fight about her internship and moving to NY without him. Parker is sure Liberty is no longer in love with him and wants to get away from him. Liberty tries to make him understand and finally tells him that she thinks she will just pass on the internship and find something closer to home. Parker is thrilled Liberty chose him, as he sees it. Craig forces Carly to sober up and then offers to talk with Parker when Carly wants to. Craig learns from a smug Parker that they didn't win, and he and Liberty are staying together; he even tells Craig that Liberty is passing on the internship too. Craig chooses not to tell a distraught looking Carly of the new events when Carly is sure Parker hates her. Craig offers to hold Carly to comfort her, as Carly lets him. Damian appeals to Lily that he isn't the one sabotaging the Foundation. Lily still doesn't believe him, and is even more convinced of his guilt when she finds a Grimaldi ring in the drawer where the disks disappeared. She confronts Damian, who proves it isn't his, since the ring is way too small, but he thinks someone else from his family might be involved. Lily seems to be wondering if he might be true. They start to go over the evidence, as Damian wonders about the partial username that Noah remembered \u0096 PESC1. Damian takes Lily home where he sees Luke, who is not pleased to see him and is still adamant that he is the guilty party. Luke is also not happy to see that both Lily and Noah appear to believe Damian now. Lily wants him to know they are all on the same side, but Luke doesn't think they are. Luke and Noah have another strange run in with Zac and Zoe. Zoe wants to use the Ouija Board to talk to the spirits about who is trying to destroy the Foundation. The initials LG appear when Zoe asks who the spirits want to talk with and Luke admits that is his true initials, but he doesn't want to get more involved. The lights go out, and Noah goes looking for Zac, who has been snooping in Luke's room; he finds him waiting for him without a shirt. Zac comes onto Noah, who again turns him down. Zoe flirts with Luke, who turns her down. Noah is starting to dislike Zac and Zoe and worries that they can't be trusted, but Luke thinks they are harmless. Later, after Noah offers Damian his support in finding who is trying to sabotage the Foundation, and they realize the username may be Pisces, Noah sees Zac and Zoe wearing matching Pisces necklaces and confronts them on it. They react in such a dramatic way that Noah thinks he might be reaching, but he still ultimately looks like he is unsure about them."

        "Damian: I need information about the foundation.",
        "Lily: For what? What possible reason?",
        "Damian: To find out who's targeting Luciano. The only way to prove that I'm not behind these attacks is to find out who is.",
        "Lily: What makes you think you can do a better job than the police?",
        "Damian: I have resources that aren't available to the police.",

        "Carly: Parker, how did you get here?",
        "Parker: A plane and a cab.",
        "Carly: With whose money?",
        "Parker: Dad paid for it.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Parker: So I could figure out what's going on with my wife.",
        "Carly: She got the internship. She's so excited. Wait till you see her.",
        "Parker: She told me that they're not gonna let us live together.",
        "Craig: Well, that's because they want all the interns in the same housing.",
        "Parker: Well, we're married, so I came to straighten that out.",
        "Carly: Sweetheart, why didn't you tell me you were coming?",
        "Parker: Well, I called. So did Dad. You didn't answer. I left you text messages, too.",
        "Carly: I -- I didn't hear my phone.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and you must have been too busy to check it. Well, I was looking for her in her room, but she wasn't there, and I figured she might be here with you guys, but obviously she's not.",
        "Craig: Well, she should be back pretty soon.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Would you like something to eat, Sweetheart? Are you hungry?",
        "Parker: Where is she? I've sent her like a million text messages, and she hasn't responded, either.",
        "Craig: She went to a party with the interns.",
        "Parker: She went to a party?",
        "Carly: Wait till you see her. She is so happy. She is over the moon. This internship is such an amazing opportunity.",
        "Parker: Well, she's married now. She shouldn't be going to parties by herself.",
        "Craig: It's sponsored by the magazine, Parker. It's so she can get to know the people she's gonna be working with.",
        "Parker: I don't care.",
        "[Liberty laughs in hallway]",
        "Parker: That's her.",

        "Parker: You didn't tell him?",

        "Liberty: Parker, it didn't -- it didn't come up.",
        "Parker: Liberty, come on.",
        "Liberty: I was at a party with a bunch of interns and -- and fashion people, and -- and it was so amazing, Parker. It was in this really cool restaurant, and -- and there were models everywhere and like photographers, and there was this band playing, and then I saw Sarah Jessica Parker. I saw her just eating dinner like a normal person.",
        "Parker: You know I don't care about that.",
        "Carly: Hey, guys, why -- why don't you come in and -- and talk inside?",
        "Parker: You set us up, didn't you? You knew all along that they wouldn't let us live together.",
        "Carly: I had no idea.",
        "Parker: And then you let her go out with that guy.",
        "Liberty: I wasn't out with him, Parker.",
        "Carly: Please. Come inside. We'll talk in here.",
        "Parker: No. This is between me and Liberty. We don't need to talk to people that just want to break us up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: \"Batman\"!",
        "Zac: Oh, you can't be serious. That's what you study in film school?",
        "Luke: What are you guys doing here?",
        "Zoe: We told you -- we're ready to party, and we figured we should include our new best friends.",
        "Noah: But we're not --",
        "Luke: Really that into parties.",
        "Zac: Oh, Z, they're still ticked at us.",
        "Zoe: For the poster prank, right?",
        "Noah: Yeah. It sucked.",
        "Zac: We won't do it again. We promise.",
        "Noah: Well, that's good.",
        "Zoe: And we made it up to you, didn't we? Getting you dudes back together.",
        "Zac: It shows that we're not the axis of \"Zee-vil.\"",
        "Zoe: \"Axis of 'Zee-vil'.\" One for you, Z.",
        "Zac: So, all is forgiven?",
        "Zoe: Give them the present, Z.",
        "Zac: Oh, right. I forgot. Absinthe. The elixir of artists and madmen. Called the green fairy. Excuse the expression. 'Cause of its natural hallucinogenic properties.",
        "Zoe: Which we can attest to from personal experience.",
        "Luke: I already told you. I don't drink.",
        "Zac: Got it. But this is absinthe.",
        "Luke: Yes, but that doesn't matter.",
        "Zoe: You are so totally a Taurus.",
        "Zac: You drink, Monster, right?",
        "Noah: Not on weeknights.",
        "Zoe: Maybe we died and this is hell -- all these hot dudes who don't party.",
        "Zac: Well, we'll just have to drink for four. Mm.",
        "[Coughs]",
        "Noah: Okay. Why don't you guys, I don't know, take this party anywhere else?",
        "Zoe: We can't when you two so totally need lightening up. I'd love to see those dimples, handsome.",
        "Zac: I'd love to see a lot more than that.",
        "Noah: Okay. I told you.",
        "Zac: It's a joke. Oh, Z, I think it's time for plan Z.",
        "Zoe: I think you're right.",
        "Luke: What, you -- you want -- you want to play a game?",
        "Zac: It's not a game, Dude. Z can channel the spirit world.",
        "Zoe: Maybe the spirits will tell us who's messing with the foundation.",
        "Noah: You're kidding.",
        "Zoe: They're everywhere.",
        "Luke: You're serious?",
        "Zoe: Dead serious.",
        "Zac: One for you, Z.",
        "Zoe: I've done it before. But since this is your foundation, I'll need you to help connect. Maybe your dead ancestors will tell us what's really going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Whoever's behind this is very dangerous. Luciano was almost killed. I was stabbed.",
        "Lily: And that gives you the right to play detective?",
        "Damian: At least let me look around the office, see if I can find those backup disks.",
        "Lily: They're gone.",
        "Damian: Could someone have misplaced them?",
        "Lily: No. They were definitely stolen.",
        "Damian: All right, humor me. Where were they before?",
        "Lily: In there. Okay. Okay. You looked around. Now, Damian, you got to go.",
        "Damian: You know, I understand why your husband wants to believe I'm guilty. I just don't understand why you feel you have to agree with him.",
        "Lily: Maybe I actually do agree with him.",
        "Damian: That I would run our son down with a car? That I would ransack your home? That I would pay someone to stab me?",
        "Lily: You need to go.",
        "Damian: Lily. This is about our son.",
        "Lily: Then you should be talking to him, not me.",
        "Damian: He won't speak to me. You know that.",
        "Lily: Then you got a problem.",
        "Damian: Fine. There's no point going around in circles. I'll go, but you should look for those disks. Maybe you missed something.",
        "Lily: What is this? Damian.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hmm.",
        "Noah: I said no thanks.",
        "Zac: One drink isn't gonna kill you.",
        "Zoe: Ready to take this sucker for a ride?",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Zoe: Spirits, it's me, Zoe. As you can see, I'm here with Luke Snyder. It's moving. H-e I-s g-a-y.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Luke: The spirits don't lie, Z.",
        "Zoe: One for you, Luke. Now let's get serious. Spirits, we need to know who's messing with the foundation. Maybe I'm not the one they want to talk to.",
        "Luke: Well, who is?",
        "Zoe: Let's ask. Spirits, is there someone else you would rather speak to? L-G.",
        "Zac: There's no L.G. here.",
        "Zoe: Maybe we're working with spirits who don't know how to use a GPS.",
        "Luke: No. There -- there is an L.G. here. My birth name is Luciano Grimaldi.",
        "Zoe: Get out. That is such a sick name. Luciano Grimaldi! Why don't you use that?",
        "Luke: I don't know. It's -- it's not me.",
        "Zac: You'd rather be Luke Snyder?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Zoe: Whatever. The spirits are looking for you.",
        "Zac: Mm.",
        "Zoe: You okay, Z.?",
        "Zac: I think I'm gonna be sick.",
        "Zoe: Absinthe -- it happens every time.",
        "Luke: Then why does he drink it?",
        "Zoe: He's a romantic. Can I use your kitchen?",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Zoe: I'll make this, uh, fresh-fruit thing that usually helps him. Do you have a blender?",
        "Luke: Yeah. It's, uh, it's on the counter.",
        "Zoe: Point the way. Be back in a flash.",
        "Noah: Okay. Can we get rid of them like now?",
        "Luke: I think that's kind of hard. At least they're entertaining.",
        "Noah: Well, a little bit goes a real long way.",
        "[Zoe screams]",
        "Noah: Today's session?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: My goodness. You look splendid.",
        "Lisa: Thank you.",
        "Damian: What's your secret? How do you keep so young?",
        "Lisa: Oh. Oh. But that's easy. Clean living and a little boozing.",
        "Damian: Never mix, never worry.",
        "Lisa: Yes. And never mix with silver-tongued devils like you.",
        "Damian: It's good to see you.",
        "Lisa: Good to see you, too. I -- I really want to ask you why you're here, but I don't know if I want to hear the answer.",
        "Damian: It's no secret. I'm here because I'm trying to reconnect with my son. There's so much I have to make up for with him.",
        "Lisa: That is certainly true. Your behavior last time was terrible.",
        "Damian: Yes, and I regret it. But I'll do whatever it takes to make amends. There's nothing more important than family.",
        "Lisa: I know what you mean. You know what? The other day I was thinking of you, because I was looking through some boxes I had put away of Eduardo's, and I thought -- I have a lot of things in there. Maybe you'd like to go through it and, uh, take some things for yourself.",
        "Damian: That is very nice of you.",
        "Lisa: Well, he was your cousin, after all. And, uh, I've got a lot of things in there. I have pictures and letters and things, and some of them I don't even realize what they are, and I thought maybe they'd mean the world to you.",
        "Damian: Thank you.",
        "Lisa: Yes. So, whenever you want to look at them, let me know.",
        "Damian: Well, as it happens, I -- I have the evening free. I was gonna have a room-service dinner, but, uh, maybe I'll change my plans and invite you to one of your charming, excellent restaurants.",
        "Lisa: Oh, I would love that. What a sweet invitation. But I can't. I'm sorry. I do have dinner plans tonight.",
        "Damian: Of course you do. He's a lucky man.",
        "Lisa: Oh, how do you know it's a man?",
        "Damian: In Lisa, there's always a man.",
        "Lisa: Oh, now, if you're digging to find out some information about my love life, shame on you.",
        "Damian: I wouldn't dare.",
        "Lisa: Well, good, because I certainly wouldn't ask you about yours.",
        "Damian: Why, thank you for your discretion.",
        "Lisa: It's not discretion. I'm not asking because I know there's only one person for you, and that's Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Hey, you okay?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'm fine. What happened?",
        "Noah: I don't know. It's not a blackout. The streetlights are still on.",
        "Luke: I heard Zoe scream. Zoe?",
        "Zoe: I'm here.",
        "Luke: Are you okay?",
        "Zoe: Yeah. I just got scared.",
        "Luke: Well, a fuse must have blown or the circuit breaker or something.",
        "Zoe: I think it was me. I plugged in the blender, and there was this flash, and then everything went dark. I thought I got electrocuted and died.",
        "Luke: Well, I'll go check it out, okay?",
        "Zoe: Okay. Where's Z?",
        "Noah: Oh. You know, I don't think he ever came back from the bathroom.",
        "Zoe: He must be lost in the house somewhere. He must be freaking. Z! Z, can you hear me? Are you okay? Z?",
        "Noah: Zoe. Zoe, relax.",
        "Zoe: You don't understand. He's afraid of the dark. Z! Z!",
        "Noah: Okay. I'm gonna go try and find Zac. You guys try and get the lights back on.",
        "Zoe: Please find him.",
        "Noah: I will.",
        "Zoe: Let's light the rest of the candles. Maybe it'll help z find his way.",
        "Luke: Okay.",
        "Zoe: Cool.",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Zoe: The way it looks in here -- you can feel the ghosts circling.",
        "Luke: Let's try to get the lights back on.",
        "Zoe: Maybe this is a sign. Maybe all these dead Grimaldis are here and they blew out the lights so that they can talk to you.",
        "Luke: Wow. I don't want to talk to any Grimaldis.",
        "Zoe: Luciano! Luciano!",
        "Luke: Look, will you please stop calling me that?",
        "Zoe: Sorry. But don't you at least want to try?",
        "Luke: No. There's no use. I'm not on speaking terms with the Grimaldis, dead or otherwise.",

        "Damian: Lily. Are you allowed to be here?",
        "Lily: Don't. Recognize this?",
        "Damian: It's a Grimaldi ring.",
        "Lily: No kidding.",
        "Damian: Where did you find it?",
        "Lily: In the cabinet where the disks were kept. Guess it fell off when you were stealing them.",
        "Damian: I didn't steal them.",
        "Lily: This is your ring.",
        "Damian: Let me see.",
        "Lily: Don't tell me that's not yours.",

        "Zac: Waiting for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Get in here. Parker, you are so far off the mark. Why would I deliberately try to break up your marriage?",
        "Parker: Oh, I can think of a couple reasons.",

        "Parker: Well, I can.",
