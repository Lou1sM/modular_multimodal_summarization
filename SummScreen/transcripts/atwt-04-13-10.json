        "Liberty arrives late to her treatment in a fancy sports car driven by Gabriel because he took the car for a test drive. Gabriel intends to buy the car with the money Craig is going to give him to keep quiet about Craig using Parker's trust fund to fund Monte Carlo. Parker is jealous of Gabriel's closeness with Liberty and admits to her that he has always loved her and wants to be more than friends. Liberty tells Parker that she can't think of being anything more than friends right now. Gabriel tells Craig that Brian was a friend of his and he is blackmailing him because he deserves it for causing Brian's death. Parker asks Craig questions about his trust fund but Craig assures him that the trust fund is fine and will be available for him when he needs to use the money.",
        "Rocco takes the gun away from the hitman Ralph hired to kill Dusty and tells the hit man that he doesn't need his services anymore. When Rocco goes inside Metro with a gun, Dusty thinks he is the man trying to kill him, so they fight each other until Rocco has a heart attack. Rocco is rushed to the hospital where Dusty tells Janet everything and apologizes to her for lying to her and thinking that Rocco wanted to kill him. Janet is angry with Dusty and doesn't know if she can forgive him. Jack is also upset with Carly for helping Dusty with his plan but eventually forgives her. Jack tells Dusty that the surveillance tape at Metro shows that Rocco took the gun away from the hit man, so Dusty is grateful that Rocco saved his life."

        "Jack: You expecting a call?",
        "Carly: Just checking to see if one of the kids has tried to reach me.",
        "Jack: Doesn't it usually ring when that happens?",
        "Carly: You never know.",
        "Jack: What aren't you telling me?",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Jack: Hey, Buddy. You okay?",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Carly: What's wrong?",
        "Parker: Liberty.",
        "Carly: Did something happen?",
        "Parker: I just -- I don't get her. She's got a chemo treatment later today, and she's hanging out at Al's like it's no big deal.",
        "Carly: She's probably just trying to keep her mind on something else.",
        "Parker: I don't know how she does it. I mean, I can't. And then as soon as I start worrying, she gets mad at me, and then she asks me to leave. I just -- I don't know how to show her that I'm just trying to help.",
        "Jack: Well -- well, maybe you're trying too hard. Maybe she needs you to try and help less.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Parker: What's so funny?",
        "Jack: That's exactly what your mother was telling me to do.",
        "Carly: Ah.",
        "Jack: Ah.",
        "Parker: So, who were you trying to help?",
        "Jack: I have been spending a lot of time trying to find out who shot Dusty.",
        "Parker: That's your job, isn't it?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I -- I know that. But usually when it's -- it's personal like this, I don't know when to stop. You see, I can't do everything, and neither can you.",
        "Parker: What if Liberty isn't really taking care of herself?",
        "Carly: I don't think that's what's happening here. She may not be doing everything that you and her mother want her to do, but she's a smart girl. She's not gonna risk her health after everything she's been through.",
        "Parker: So what do I do?",
        "Carly: You let her do it her way, and you wait and see what she wants you to do.",
        "Parker: Right, because it's just that easy.",
        "Jack: No. Nobody said it was easy. You know, maybe it's us that needs the distraction, right? What do you say we go to the lake and have a picnic?",
        "Parker: A picnic? Seriously?",
        "Jack: Yes. Do you know how long it's been since we had a family picnic?",
        "Parker: Yes, a long time, and for a very good reason.",
        "Jack: It will be fun, Parker. Come on! We'll get Sage. We'll pack up these sandwiches, maybe even go for a boat ride.",
        "Carly: You know, today's not a good day for that.",
        "Jack: Why not?",
        "Carly: There's a lot going on.",
        "Jack: Like what?",
        "Carly: Well, Liberty's chemo, for one. And Parker should -- should be here, just in case she needs anything.",
        "Jack: But her mother is here, and Teri, and her grandfather's in town.",
        "Carly: No, I know that, but I still think Parker should stick around, just in case.",
        "Parker: You do?",
        "Jack: This isn't about Parker. Something else is going on.",
        "Carly: Like what?",
        "Jack: Like I don't know. You tell me.",

        "Janet: Uh, yeah, it's nice. Don't you remember? You have a chemo appointment.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I know. Don't you think that would go great with those shoes you bought me?",
        "Janet: Yeah. Is everything okay?",
        "Liberty: Everything's fine. I didn't forget I have an appointment. I didn't forget I have cancer.",
        "Janet: Liberty --",
        "Liberty: I mean, how could I when everybody's reminding me every second?",
        "Janet: They're just worried about you. That's all.",
        "Liberty: All I am doing is looking at clothes in a window, pretending everything's normal for, oh, three whole minutes.",
        "Janet: You need to take care of yourself, Baby.",
        "Liberty: I am. I'm sorry for being so witchy.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry, too. There you go.",
        "Liberty: Thanks. So, how is the other patient in your life? Uh, Dusty? Remember him?",
        "Janet: Yes, yes, I -- I remember him. He's -- he's fine. He -- he checked himself out of the hospital.",
        "Liberty: Oh, that's great.",
        "Janet: Yeah, it is, but he checked himself out and didn't tell me about it.",
        "Liberty: Why?",
        "Janet: Oh, I think he just thinks I'm smothering him.",
        "Liberty: I know the feeling.",
        "Janet: Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I smother you, too.",
        "Liberty: I was thinking of Parker.",

        "Liberty: So why is it a problem for Dusty?",
        "Janet: I wish I knew.",
        "Liberty: Why don't you do this -- give him some space and give yourself and the baby a chance to rest. Stop trying to take care of everyone else.",
        "Janet: I'm fine.",
        "Liberty: And you want to stay that way.",
        "Janet: I will. Now, do you want somebody to go with you to your appointment?",
        "Liberty: Mom --",
        "Janet: All right, okay, okay, okay. Say hi to Parker for me.",
        "Liberty: When I see him.",
        "Janet: Isn't he going with you?",
        "Liberty: I can do it alone.",
        "Janet: You don't have to.",
        "Liberty: Mom --",
        "Janet: Okay, all right! Good luck, baby.",
        "Liberty: Thanks. [Liberty sighs] Gabriel, it's me, Liberty, leaving message number two. I have some time to kill, and I thought we could hang out, but I guess you must be busy.",

        "Gabriel: Don't play games with me or else your partner's gonna find out you're trying to rip off her kid's trust fund.",
        "Craig: I'm not ripping off anybody. I borrowed some cash. That's all.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, I'm sure that's how they're all gonna see it, right? 'Cause you're such a trustworthy guy.",
        "Craig: You want to know what you can trust? You ever go near my son again, I'll kill you.",
        "Gabriel: Just give me my cash and nothing's gonna happen.",
        "Craig: You come within 50 feet of him ever again, and I swear to you, there won't be anywhere on this earth where you can hide. Now get out.",

        "Carly: Well, I told you. I think that Parker should stick around in case Liberty needs him. Besides, it -- it really does -- it looks like rain.",

Don't look at me like this is my problem and not yours. You're on the hook for just as much as me, Pal. You're the one that wrote the checks that I signed out of Parker's trust. You're the one cooking up the fake books. So if I go down, you're gonna be sharing my cell.",
        "Ellis: What fake books?",
        "Craig: The ones for Carly so she'll stop asking me questions. When I talked to you on the phone, I told you that Carly wanted to see the books, so we had to have a clean set of records, and you said you'd take care of it. Those books.",

        "Parker: Bank fees?",

        "Dusty: You should probably sit down.",
        "Janet: What were you thinking, beating up on an old man with a bad heart?!",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry.",

        "Janet: It's -- 10 minutes.",
        "Jack: Listen, the doctors aren't gonna know anything for a while. Why don't you go check on Liberty? There's nothing for you to do here.",
        "Janet: Okay. All right, fine. But I'm only one floor down, so if you hear anything, you come find me.",
        "Jack: Of course. What the hell were you doing? What were you trying to accomplish, huh?! Were you trying to get him to confess, maybe turn on Ralph, or were you trying to kill him, even the score?!",
        "Dusty: I don't know.",
        "Jack: That's not an answer.",
        "Dusty: I guess I wasn't thinking straight.",
        "Jack: Enough. You know, I was willing to give you a second chance, given the way you were treating Janet, standing by her. I thought you deserved it. After this little stunt you pulled today, I've changed my mind.",

        "Jack: Meaning I don't want you anywhere near Janet or my kid.",

        "Janet: What the heck is wrong with you? How could you show up late for your appointment?",
        "Liberty: I was having some fun, and now I'm here. I don't see why you have a problem.",
        "Janet: The problem is you lied to me. You told me you were gonna be here with Parker, and you show up with that guy?",

        "Dusty: So Rocco was telling the truth. He saved my life.",
        "Jack: What did Rocco say to you before he collapsed?",
        "Dusty: He said he took the gun away from some guy who was in the club, and I didn't believe him.",
        "Jack: Why not?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause I didn't see anyone else, and he had the gun in his hands, so I assumed that --",

        "Dusty: Yeah, it made sense.",
        "Janet: What were you doing at Metro? You were barely well enough to leave the hospital.",

        "Liberty: Yeah. We were, like, married.",

        "Craig: I told you, I borrowed some money. That's all. Just until we can get to the show in Milan. We sell Carly's collection, and we'll have investors breaking down the door, and I can repay every dime.",
        "Gabriel: Why don't you tell it to someone who cares?",
        "Craig: You should care. You have the upper hand right now, but that always changes. And when it does, you'd better pray I never find you.",

        "Janet: He wasn't even there.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you were inside. He came up to me. He was drunk. And he told me how much he hated that I was a part of your life, and I told him to get used to it, that I wasn't going anywhere.",
        "Janet: And he had a gun?",
        "Dusty: No. Then the shooter showed up a few hours later at Metro looking for me.",
        "Janet: What -- what does that have to do with my father?",
        "Dusty: I thought he, uh, called in a favor.",
        "Janet: You thought that my father asked Ralphie to have you killed?",
        "Dusty: Yes. I mean, at the time I did.",
        "Janet: But now you don't?",
        "Dusty: Well, Jack said the surveillance tape showed Rocco stopping a guy with a gun. He wouldn't have done that if he had ordered the hit.",
        "Janet: You know what the worst thing about this is? You lied to me. You didn't even tell me about the argument with my father or that you even remembered it.",
        "Dusty: I didn't want to upset you.",
        "Janet: Oh, right, and I'm not upset right now?",

        "Carly: It wasn't my place.",
        "Jack: Dusty was risking his life, and you knew that. You should have told me.",
        "Carly: He made me choose between protecting him and protecting you. I chose you.",
        "Jack: I can't say that I don't admire you for sticking up for him.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: What's worse, I -- I think I even get the twisted logic of him thinking he was somehow shielding Janet.",
        "Carly: He was.",
        "Jack: So I understand where he's coming from. But you -- Carly, I don't understand you at all.",

        "Parker: Okay, okay, look. Fine, I just thought that if you were okay hooking up with another guy, then you would be okay with talking about you and me.",
        "Liberty: We didn't hook up. He just gave me a ride.",
        "Parker: So you just ran into him while you were shopping for a new sports car?",
        "Liberty: Not there, but --",
        "Parker: Are you being honest with me?",
        "Liberty: Okay, he told me to meet him there, but it's no big deal.",
        "Parker: The guy's a tool.",
        "Liberty: Well, the guy doesn't make me feel like a patient.",
        "Parker: That's because you're just some girl that he's hitting on. He doesn't care about you. He doesn't love you. Sorry. I didn't mean to say that.",
        "Liberty: But it's true. You love me?",
        "Parker: I told you I didn't want to dump anything on you.",
        "Liberty: Just talk to me, Parker.",
        "Parker: Okay, okay. Yes, yes, I love you. But -- I didn't want to go there with everything that you've been going through. But I've always loved you, Liberty, from the day that I met you.",
        "Liberty: You couldn't stand me.",
        "Parker: But once I got past that, I never stopped. And even when you tried to push me away, it just made me love you even more.",
        "Liberty: I -- I don't know what to say.",
        "Parker: You don't have to say anything.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but I mean look at me. My hair is falling out. I'm hooked up to pumps.",
        "Parker: I don't care.",
        "Liberty: I do. This isn't how I want to be the next time I'm in love.",

        "Liberty: I'm saying right now, friends is the best I can do.",
        "Parker: Okay. I understand.",
        "Liberty: Do you? Because friends are good. Friends are crucial. I mean, I don't -- wouldn't have made it this far without you.",
        "Parker: Okay. We'll be friends.",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry.",
        "Parker: No, I am, for bringing it up.",

        "Gabriel: I went to the cemetery to pay my respects, saw you there.",

        "Craig: Why are you doing this?",
