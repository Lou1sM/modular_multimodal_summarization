        "Paul: I've wanted you for so long. You, only you.",

        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Emily: Strip.",
        "Dusty: Not tonight, honey. I got a headache.",
        "Emily: I got a gun. Guess who wins.",
        "Dusty: Okay, but it's been a while. You promise you'll be gentle?",
        "Emily: Hurry up.",
        "Dusty: Why? Who's waiting for you? Pauly boy?",
        "Emily: Ooh, your leg still hurts, huh?",
        "Dusty: I stepped in a bear trap.",
        "Emily: Maybe you shouldn't have tried to run away. Put these on.",
        "Dusty: Why? Why do I deserve the fresh clothes? You planning another photo op? The least you could do is make polite conversation with me.",
        "Emily: Hurry or I'll kill you. Polite enough for you, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: You know what? You should burn this.",
        "Emily: Are you kidding me? And waste these precious bloodstains? I don't think so.",
        "Dusty: Why? What are you going to do with it?",
        "Emily: Just hurry up. Get your pants on.",
        "Dusty: Maybe we should slow down and chat.",
        "Emily: Maybe you should shut up and do what I tell you to do.",
        "Dusty: You're walking right into a trap, Emily. Paul Ryan is setting you up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Noise]",
        "Jack: I guess somebody was feeling a little left out.",
        "Carly: She's missed you. So have I.",
        "Jack: Hey, honey. Did you just make that noise? Did you drop something?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Probably just one of her toys. I'll pick this stuff up later. Come on, sweetheart. Why don't we go get some ice cream, all right? Would you like that? Would you like to go get some ice cream? Come on, Jack.",
        "Jack: Wait a second. This is the valve for the boiler.",
        "Carly: I wonder how it got up here.",
        "Jack: That's a really good question. What'd you do, Carly?",
        "Carly: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: You just had to get me over here. What better way --",
        "Carly: Because I need you here to stop the leak, Jack. What exactly are you accusing me of?",
        "Jack: Sage, honey, where did you find this? Huh? Where was this? Who had it?",
        "Sage: Mommy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: There are stolen jewels in Carly's basement?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I hid them in the wall.",
        "Katie: Why there?",
        "Mike: That's where I lived when I was younger.",
        "Katie: And you think they're still there?",
        "Mike: I didn't move them. No one else knows I put them there.",
        "Katie: So why not just leave them there?",
        "Mike: I can't anymore. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Now that this book has come out, all bets are off.",
        "Katie: Mike, there is nothing even remotely close to rubies being in the book. I didn't know about it until now.",
        "Mike: My name is in the book. And the fact that I had been in prison.",
        "Katie: Oh, okay, so people are just going to come to the conclusion that because you were in jail, you were also involved in hiding a random suitcase full of rubies.",
        "Mike: You're forgetting about the woman who gave me the rubies in the first place. She could come back looking for them.",
        "Katie: If she hasn't by now, Mike?",
        "Mike: She could've been in prison or out of the country. Maybe she's told somebody about them. Someone who's now going to come looking for them.",
        "Katie: That is a lot of maybes. If we just leave it alone, I think it'll be so much easier.",
        "Mike: Okay, and spend the rest of our lives looking over our shoulders? Wondering every time a stranger shows up if they're here for the jewels?",
        "Katie: All right, what do you want to do now?",
        "Mike: I have to go to the police. There's no other way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Wait, wait, wait. Stop. What am I doing?",
        "Paul: Well, I think we both know what we're doing.",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? Just stay away from me. Just keep your distance, all right?",
        "Paul: Um, Meg, you know, I thought we were on the same page here. At least in the same bed.",
        "Meg: I'm glad that you think this is funny.",
        "Paul: I mean, are there any other options?",
        "Meg: You're married.",
        "Paul: Only in name.",
        "Meg: Please, just -- just go, please.",
        "Paul: You're throwing me out?",
        "Meg: I can't go to bed with someone who's tangled up with someone else. I did it with Dusty and I'm doing it with you.",
        "Paul: Technically, we haven't done anything. Yet. Meg, are you saying that you don't want to be with me?",
        "Meg: Did it look like I didn't want to be with you? That's all I want. That's all I think about.",
        "Paul: Me, too.",
        "Meg: But I can't!",
        "Paul: Look, I'm only tangled up in Emily because I have to be.",
        "Meg: If you say that you slept with Emily to save my life, I swear I will slug you.",
        "Paul: Just don't shoot me. You know something, Meg?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: I like you.",
        "Meg: Oh, gee, thanks.",
        "Paul: No, I do. You're spunky and you're bristly and you're edgy and you're always a surprise.",
        "Meg: I sound like a grumpy porcupine.",
        "Paul: And you're sexy. Oh, Meg. You're so sexy. So, what kind of underwear you got on?",
        "Meg: Okay, don't do that! I have no self-control with you.",
        "Paul: Music to my ears. Okay. Why do you like me?",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: I'm not telling you that.",
        "Paul: No, I'm serious. Nobody likes me. Just tell me. I'm curious.",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: Okay. If you don't want to talk anymore, we could kiss some more. That would be great.",
        "Meg: No, no, no. Okay, okay. Fine, fine, fine. Fine, fine. I will tell you. I like you because even though you went about it the wrong way, taking care of your sister, you still love her. And you made a lot of bad choices in life, but so have I. And who am I to judge? And you're smart and funny. Are there any buttons left on your shirt?",
        "Paul: I doubt it.",
        "Meg: Okay, well, you know what? Put it on. Please. Just go.",
        "Paul: Okay. You know, I lied to you. About liking you.",
        "Meg: You don't like me?",
        "Paul: I didn't want to tell you the truth because I really have no right to. And what could I possibly offer you? But somewhere along the line, Meg, I fell in love with you. Single last thing I ever expected to have happen.",
        "Meg: Well, isn't that a coincidence?",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Meg: Because I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So what's Pauly's game?",
        "Emily: You think you got it all figured out, don't you?",
        "Dusty: First he had you take a photo of me to prove he didn't kill me. Now he's got you doing something with my clothes. And the sad thing is, you don't even realize he's walking you into a trap.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about?",
        "Dusty: He's gonna pin my murder on you. He's setting you up to take the fall.",
        "Emily: Shut up. Shut up!",
        "Dusty: I'm just looking out for you.",
        "Emily: Nobody's looking out for me. Stop trying to figure out what I'm going to do because you'll never guess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, what's the most important thing?",
        "Mike: Staying out of jail.",
        "Katie: Right. And in order to do that, we have to get the rubies back to their rightful owner. We just have to go to Carly's and get them.",
        "Mike: And hope that Jack and Carly don't notice a big hole in their basement wall?",
        "Katie: We'll just have to break in when they're not there.",
        "Mike: Now you've got me committing new crimes on top of the old crimes.",
        "Katie: Honey, any other person couldn't do it, but you're a contractor. You can get in there, break a hole in the wall, get the rubies and patch it back exactly like it looked before. No one will know the difference. How long would that take?",
        "Mike: I'd have to replaster. Hopefully the color would look the same. Why am I even thinking about this? This is crazy.",
        "Katie: Honey, please, we have to at least try! We've lost each other so many times, usually because of some stupid thing that I did with Simon or Henry or whatever. And now if you go to jail because of this stupid book that I wrote -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Mike: I'm sorry. I should have told you about this a long time ago.",
        "Katie: Why didn't you?",
        "Mike: I'm not real proud of my past, Katie.",
        "Katie: Oh, like I'm so perfect? Look at all of the awful things I've done. You've always been there for me. Let me be there for you.",
        "Mike: If I end up going through with this, you can't be involved.",
        "Katie: Come on, honey, I can help. You need me.",
        "Mike: No. I can put a hole in a wall all by myself.",
        "Katie: Please, you need me to help.",
        "Mike: Why?",
        "Katie: Because I want to get married in June and I want to walk down the aisle in a white dress, not be married by a judge in a prison! And I don't want to spend the first few years of my married life with people with guns watching me! And I want my conjugal rights!",
        "Mike: Got to love those conjugal rights, but I'm not letting you help me.",
        "Katie: Honey, please, it'll be so much easier if we just work together. We can get the rubies. We'll put them in an unsigned, unmarked package. We'll send it to the police with a typed letter saying that these rubies were stolen and they needed to be returned to the rightful owner.",
        "Mike: Okay, even if we could get the rubies to the police without being traced, how do we get into Carly's basement?",
        "Katie: You take care of the rubies, I'll take care of getting us in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Come here, Sage. Come on. So was Sage watching while you were figuring out how to trick me? Did you give her the play-by-play so that she'll know how to lie to her husband when she's all grown up?",
        "Carly: Jack, please, don't.",
        "Jack: Sage, why don't you go upstairs and grab your jacket? Okay?",
        "Carly: Where are you taking her?",
        "Jack: To Emma's. Like I promised I would before you pulled this stunt.",
        "Carly: The boiler was broken, Jack.",
        "Jack: Because you broke it! Somehow you wrestled that valve off and you created a crisis that I would have to solve. And you knew damn well that I'd be standing right next to you in that wet t-shirt to solve it.",
        "Carly: I needed your help, so I called you. Isn't that what I'm supposed to do? This is still your house. Your children still live here. I am still your wife!",
        "Jack: You're still lying to me to get what you want!",
        "Carly: You want it, too. Us, together. You felt it, too.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I did.",
        "Carly: Then why are you pushing for this separation, Jack?",
        "Jack: Because you know no limits, Carly. I tried to tell myself, \"Yeah, she lies, okay. But at least not to me.\" And then you lie to me. And then I thought, \"well, at least doesn't use our kids.\" And then you go ahead and do something like this!",
        "Carly: I didn't. I did not use Sage. I didn't not ask her to lie to you.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but if I didn't catch on, you'd still be lying, wouldn't you?",
        "Carly: You push me to the wall, Jack. And then you wonder why I get desperate. It's because you won't even give me a chance to make it right!",
        "Jack: It's a vicious circle, Carly. The more desperate you are, the more you lie and scheme and twist things. And you know the worst part -- is no matter how much I love you, no matter how much you claim to love me, when you're in trouble, the last thing you think to do is to come to me and tell me the truth.",
        "Carly: I have done that. I have done that. I have told you the truth. I have told you the only truth that matters, that I love you. That I would do anything to save this marriage. I have -- I have apologized from the bottom of my heart. I have gotten down on my knees. And you pushed me away.",
        "Jack: Not because I wanted to, Carly. But because I had to.",
        "Carly: Jack, nobody knows me like you do, Jack. You know how hard I have fought to get here, to have a home, to have a family. To have a man who loves me. Is it any wonder that once I have finally gotten what I dreamed of my entire life, that I would do everything I could to keep it? Jack, we promised each other forever. And I never lied about that. Did you?",
        "Jack: I meant what I said when I made that promise, Carly. But things changed.",
        "Carly: No, things have not changed between us. The way we feel about each other has not changed.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but what I can tolerate and what I need from the woman who claims to love me, that's what's changed.",
        "Carly: You can't keep pushing me away, Jack. It hurts. It does damage. And if you push too far -- if you push too hard, there will be no going back. Is that really what you want? For us to be over? Just give me something. Just give me something to have a little hope. Just take one step toward me. Toward us. Toward our life together. Jack, please, just one step.",
        "Jack: I don't know how.",
        "Carly: It's easy. Just stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: When?",
        "Meg: When what?",
        "Paul: Tell me, when -- when did you figure out that you loved me?",
        "Meg: I am not telling you that.",
        "Paul: Okay, fine. I'm not gonna tell you, either.",
        "Meg: I loved Dusty ever since I was a teenager. I lied to Jennifer, I lost my job so I could keep him. And when I thought you killed him, I just wanted to protect you. So that's when I knew. So when?",
        "Paul: When what? It was sometime between the sixth and the seventh time that you said you hated me. [Meg laughs] Look, I want to protect you, too, Meg. I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you, especially now. And Emily, she's out of control. And we don't know what she's done with Dusty, if Dusty's even alive. Now, at the very least, please, can we get you out of town and away from her?",
        "Meg: No, I'm not leaving you alone with that woman.",
        "Paul: She's crazy, jealous. She'd do anything to keep you away from me.",
        "Meg: I'll take my chances.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but I'm not gonna take any chances, not with your life. You go.",
        "Meg: Would you go? Would you risk Dusty's life and Jennifer's happiness so you could save yourself?",
        "Paul: If anything happened to you, I wouldn't be able to live with myself.",
        "Meg: Same here. So we'll both be careful.",
        "Paul: That's it? You're not gonna change your mind? Oh. You know, any minute, Emily's gonna call and find out how that restraining order's going.",
        "Meg: Then I guess you'd better get to that.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Why? What are you gonna do?",
        "Meg: Well, I've been thinking a lot about Henry Coleman. He and Emily have been thick as thieves lately.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Henry's the key. Well, I've got to go.",
        "Meg: So when will I see you again?",
        "Paul: Well, once this restraining order's there, you know, you won't be able to call me. You won't be able to come over. We can't run into each other.",
        "Meg: So you'll come see me when it's safe?",
        "Paul: I would give anything to not have to go out that door right now, you know that.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Well, um, I'll give you something to dream about. My underwear is the matching kind.",
        "Paul: Oh. I really got to go.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Oh, sorry, it took so long. Thanks for waiting.",
        "Henry: Thanks are inappropriate when you have blackmailed someone into doing something, Em.",
        "Emily: I'm just trying to be polite here. Okay? You know, if you don't want your money, it's --",
        "Henry: It's not -- it's not about the money. It's not about the money. Just give it to me straight. Did you kill Meg?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Henry: Good. Why, then, are we meeting in a garage?",
        "Emily: Where's -- oh, you brought your toolbox.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Emily: See this lately baby here?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Meg's car.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Henry: I am not draining Meg's brake fluid.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, I got a much better plan than that.",
        "Henry: I'm not gonna attach a bomb to her ignition.",
        "Emily: I just want you to open her car, Henry.",
        "Henry: No.",
        "Emily: Not even for your money? Not even to save Meg's life? You do this for me, Meg will be inconvenienced a little, far away from Paul but alive. You don't do this for me -- well, I don't know what's gonna happen. It's up to you.",
        "Henry: I don't -- I don't know why you're doing this. I don't, I don't. Paul married you. You have him.",
        "Emily: Yeah, and I plan to keep him. Okay, fine, have it your way. So when Meg meets with an unfortunate accident, you're only gonna have yourself to blame.",
        "Henry: Get out of the way.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Henry: I can't believe this. Unbelievable.",
        "Emily: Whoa, that was fast.",
        "Henry: It's all in the wrist. What's that?",
        "Emily: You really want to know what it is?",
        "Henry: No. Do me a favor, just lose my number, okay?",
        "Emily: Wait, wait, wait, I'm not finished yet. I have one more thing to ask you -- one teeny, tiny, little thing.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Meg: Hello?",
        "Henry: Hi, Meg, it's Henry Coleman.",
        "Meg: What do you want?",
        "Henry: I need to tell you -- I need to warn you about something.",
        "Meg: It's Emily, isn't it?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, she's planning something.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Henry: Not on the phone. Um, I have proof. But if Emily finds out --",
        "Meg: What kind of proof?",
        "Henry: Not now. Just meet me at the old mill. You know where that is?",
        "Meg: Yeah. Why there?",
        "Henry: Because Emily is having you watched. So be careful. Take route 5. No one uses that. It'll be easy to spot a tail. I'll do the same thing, okay?",
        "Meg: Fine, fine. I'll be there in half an hour.",
        "Henry: Are you satisfied?",
        "Emily: I will be.",

        "Carly: What, Jack? What do you wish?",
        "Jack: Well, there she is. Hey. You all set to go down to Aunt Emma's and have cookies, hmm? I'll drop her off in the morning on my way to work, okay?",
        "Carly: Oh, Sage. Don't forget Sally. She's in the kitchen. Her new favorite doll.",
        "Jack: Since when?",
        "Carly: This morning. Jack --",
        "Jack: This is it, Carly. The point where we've both been pushed too far.",
        "Carly: You don't mean that.",
        "Jack: There's no going back. I mean that. And if you try to use what we had to push for something that's never gonna happen, it'll just make matters worse. Please, sign the papers.",

        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Carly: Katie, what do you want?",

        "Carly: Katie, would you like me to call the police?",
        "Katie: Call whoever you want, just hear me out first. No, listen, I -- I know you're angry about me helping Nick try to expose you for what you did to him, but it's just --",
        "Carly: Hey, Sergeant Tucker, its Carly Snyder calling. I need to report an intruder.",
        "Katie: It's not for me. This is for Mike.",
        "Carly: You know something, Sarge? I think maybe I spoke too soon. It's just one of the neighborhood kids. I can handle it. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure I'll call ya if I need ya. Bye. What about Mike?",
        "Katie: Can we talk someplace else?",
        "Carly: If you have something to say, Katie, say it.",
        "Katie: I will, I just would rather say it in someplace where you can't have me arrested for trespassing in case I tick you off.",
        "Carly: I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "Katie: Come on, we'll go to Java, its right down the street. I'll buy you a latte. Please, Carly, this really is for Mike.",
        "Carly: Can you tell me what it's about?",
        "Katie: I will, as soon as we get to Java.",
        "Carly: Is this about that book, that \"Oakdale Confidential\"?",
        "Katie: No, no, it's not about that. Come on, what do you have to do today? Come on, have a latte. I'll drive.",

        "Paul: Well, those cops over there apparently are too busy to help me. They said I should talk to a detective.",

        "Paul: Kind of personal. Someone else I can talk to?",
        "Jack: Hal's in his office. Go on up, top of the stairs.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know where his office is.",
        "Jack: You know where his ex-wife is? Oh, that's right, you're married to her now.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You got a problem with that, Jack?",
        "Jack: No, I have a problem with you. You let your sister believe that her baby was dead, and he wasn't. Let everyone else believe you were dead, and well, you're not. Tell everyone that you murdered Dusty Donovan.",
        "Paul: And I didn't. I know all this, Jack. I don't need to hear about it from you.",
        "Jack: Well, you asked. So what is so personal? Why don't you come by tomorrow? Maybe there'll be some friendlier cops around.",
        "Paul: I need a restraining order.",
        "Jack: You need protection from whom?",
        "Paul: Your cousin Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Siren blares]",
        "Meg: Is everything okay, officer?",
        "Cop: You have any idea how fast you were going, ma'am?",
        "Meg: The speed limit, I thought.",
        "Cop: I need to see your driver's license, vehicle registration, proof of insurance please.",
        "Meg: Are you sure I was speeding, officer? I mean, I haven't gotten a ticket in years.",
        "Cop: Mrs. Snyder, we received a report that a car matching this description cut another vehicle off a couple miles back. They said that you were driving erratically.",
        "Meg: Oh, no. It wasn't me. I haven't seen another car on this road since I turned on it.",
        "Cop: Well, apparently, they saw you. They gave us the first three digits of your tag.",
        "Meg: It wasn't me.",
        "Cop: Stay here, ma'am.",
        "Meg: Where are you going?",
        "Cop: Just procedure. Be back in a few minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What are you setting up here, Paul? You trying to make Meg look like some kind of nutcase, then you can frame her for whatever you did to Dusty?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Jack: You and Meg have something going. I can see that. Hell, anybody with eyes can see that.",
        "Paul: You're wrong.",
        "Jack: And apparently, Emily can see that, too. So either you're distancing yourself from Meg, because now you've decided that Emily is more useful, or Emily's jealous, and you're trying to throw her off the scent.",
        "Paul: Emily and I are very happy.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: Yeah, right.",
        "Paul: You gonna lecture me about marriage, Jack? How about you get started on the restraining order, or I can run upstairs and get you demoted, again.",
        "Jack: I'll get you the restraining order. No problem at all. 'Cause the best thing that could ever happen to my cousin is to be forced to stay the hell away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You see, I'm perfectly sober.",
        "Cop: These tests aren't conclusive. I'll tell you what, you mind if I take a look inside your car?",
        "Meg: You're not gonna find an open flask or drugs in my car?",
        "Cop: You can refuse. That would be within your rights.",
        "Meg: But you'd take me in?",
        "Cop: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Meg: Okay, when you don't find anything, can I go?",
        "Cop: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Meg: Okay, fine, search your heart out. Well, are you satisfied?",
        "Cop: Yes, ma'am. Put your hands on the roof of the car, please.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Cop: Put your hands on the roof of the car.",
        "Meg: I don't understand. What's going on? What did you find?",
        "Cop: You're under arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Emily: I was just checking -- checking to see how the restraining order's coming along.",
        "Paul: Yeah, the cops are all busy, so Jack Snyder is taking care of it.",
        "Emily: Oh, is he giving you a hard time?",
        "Paul: Meg is his cousin.",
        "Emily: That's okay. You know, if we don't get it tonight, we can take care of it tomorrow.",
        "Paul: I thought this was really bothering you.",
        "Emily: It was. And then I started remembering how amazing it was when we made love this morning, and I realized we're together. Nothing can change that -- not Meg, not anything -- as long as you're with me.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Say it.",
        "Paul: I love you, Em.",
        "Emily: You see? That's all that matters. Oh, everything is gonna work out just fine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What did you find? Will you tell me? I have nothing illegal in the car -- no drugs, no alcohol, nothing.",
        "Cop: You're right, there is nothing illegal here.",
        "Meg: Okay, so what's the problem?",
        "Cop: Bloody clothes, ma'am. Whose are they?",
        "Meg: I don't know.",

        "Carly: You were talking about your wedding.",
        "Katie: Right. Uh, well, I know that you and Mike have been friends for a really long time. And he would like you to come to the wedding -- and so would I.",
        "Carly: Really?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I mean, I know that you're angry with me and with Nick, but it would mean the world to Mike to have you there.",
        "Carly: I'll be there. If Mike wants me there, I will be there.",
        "Katie: Really? Oh, Carly, thank you so much. That would be so great.",
        "Carly: Okay, so is that what this was about? Then --",
        "Katie: No, actually, there's something else.",
        "Carly: What is it, Katie?",
        "Katie: Well, you know, I think it's great that you're gonna be at the wedding for Mike, but I was hoping that you and I could just get past everything that's happened and go back to being friends, like we used to be.",
        "Carly: Are you saying that you're sorry that you and Nick destroyed my marriage?",
        "Katie: Well, you did try and set Nick up. He could have gotten killed.",
        "Carly: I did what I did to help Ja -- I'm just sick of explaining myself. Just forget it.",
        "Katie: Hold on, hold on, please. Okay, it's not about being sorry or not being sorry. I would just like to have a fresh start.",
        "Carly: A fresh start? Katie, you have no idea what you did.",
        "Katie: I told Jack the truth. I thought he deserved to know.",
        "Carly: We were never friends. If we had been, you would have come to me before you went to Jack.",
        "Katie: I tried.",
        "Carly: You would have tried harder! You and Mike are getting married. You're still at that stage where every day, you find something new, something else to love about him. Being married isn't about something new. It's about what is constant. It's his arm around you in the middle of the night, the goofy jokes he tells the kids, his reaching for your hand. Just because --",
        "Katie: You love him so much, Carly. I know that, and I know you and Jack are gonna work this out.",
        "Carly: I wish we could, Katie, but what you broke can't be fixed.",
        "Katie: Maybe.",
        "Carly: I'll come to the wedding, but there is no friendship between us. Don't come to my house again.",
        "Katie: Carly, wait. Please, just listen! Oh, come on, Mike. You've got to get out of there. Damn it! He must be in the basement.",

        "Paul: I don't know. So tell me more about your plans?",
        "Emily: Well, they start something like this. I don't believe it. Meg's been arrested again? What'd she do this time?",
        "Paul: I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.",
        "Emily: No. No, no, honey, I don't think we should. That's really not our problem, now is it?",
