        "Paul: And of course my mother will only drink bottled spring water, so we had a cooler moved in on that floor. And if you have any other questions, there's a whole staff here that should be able to help you out.",
        "Nurse: I think we can make Mrs. Ryan very comfortable here, sir.",
        "Paul: Well, that's what we want. Thanks.",
        "Sofie: She's a good nurse.",
        "Paul: Oh, really? That's -- that's your professional opinion?",
        "Sofie: Okay, don't you start laughing at me. I've learned a lot about hospitals in the past month. I know a good nurse when I see one.",
        "Paul: Right. Well, thank you for helping her get home.",
        "Sofie: Oh, you're welcome. I really think it's a great thing that you're doing for your mom.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, you would expect that a son would take care of his mom, right?",
        "Sofie: Yes --",
        "Paul: But you wouldn't expect that out of the Paul Ryan that Chris Hughes told you all about --",
        "Sofie: That's not what I meant --",
        "Paul: It's okay. I can explain, Sofie. Truthfully, a year ago, none of this would have been possible. I was angry and -- bitter, and full of rage.",
        "Sofie: And what happened to make you change? Wait, actually, I think I know. Meg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Anybody home?",
        "Meg: Hey, Mike -- come on in. Um, Mama's away, if you need any answers on the property.",
        "Mike: Oh, no, thanks. I just brought a crew by to do a survey. We're also going to be doing some drilling.",
        "Meg: For oil?",
        "Mike: Don't you wish. No, we're taking core samples of the soil to see what we'll be building on.",
        "Meg: Do you need anything?",
        "Mike: No. Just want to let you know we'll be making some noise.",
        "Meg: Mike, hey -- um, are you okay?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Why?",
        "Meg: You seem a little down. Nothing to do with the project, I hope?",
        "Mike: No. Everything's fine. It's -- its personal stuff. I didn't think it showed.",
        "Meg: Should I ask? Katie, right?",
        "Mike: I just -- I can't believe she's getting married.",
        "Meg: Mike, you've been away for a long time. I mean, are you really surprised that she found somebody else?",
        "Mike: I guess not. The only surprise is how much it bothers me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Yeah, I need the O'Connell case file sent over. Now! Thank you. Hey, Katie, how did you find me?",
        "Katie: I called the station. They said you were working.",
        "Margo: Oh, that made it easy. What's up? What do you want?",
        "Katie: Well, I know you had issues with me marrying Brad -- even though you went to all the trouble to throw us that amazing engagement party.",
        "Margo: And I did that because I wanted you to know that I support you no matter what you choose.",
        "Katie: Good. Because things are happening a lot faster than we originally thought.",
        "Margo: Oh, really, you set a date? When?",
        "Katie: Um, right away.",
        "Margo: You're -- you're eloping?",
        "Katie: No, no. We want to have a nice little wedding with all of our closest family and friends. But I can't do it if I don't have your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Henry: I'm coming, I'm coming! Oh, it's you. I thought it was a police raid. Why are you battering down my door?",
        "Brad: Okay, it's a done deal. It's a done deal, Henry. We set a date.",
        "Henry: Well, that's great. You know, I had my worries.",
        "Brad: Was there any doubt, my man?",
        "Henry: The spine, the ribs, the buttocks -- the punctured lung --",
        "Brad: Okay. Serious question.",
        "Henry: Yeah?",
        "Brad: Will you be my best man?",
        "Henry: My what?",
        "Brad: My best man.",
        "Henry: Brad, that's -- wait a second, what about -- what about Jack? I mean, isn't it traditional to have the brother be the best man?",
        "Brad: Henry, my brother is the recently annulled husband of my bride.",
        "Henry: That's a good point. That is all sort of enmeshed, isn't it? Well, if Jack is out of the running, then I would be honored. No more hugs -- no more hugs, okay --",
        "Brad: I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm happy. I just -- I'm happy.",
        "Henry: Yeah, great. When is the big day?",
        "Brad: As soon as Katie gets a dress and we can find someone to perform the ceremony.",
        "Henry: That's -- right, no long engagements for you. Not with Mike Kasnoff in town. You need to make her Mrs. Brad Snyder immediately, if not sooner.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, are you going to help me or not?",
        "Margo: Uh -- yeah, I'll help you. I'll help you. I'll give you a piece of friendly advice. Um, don't rush into this wedding. Especially now.",
        "Katie: What does that mean, especially now?",
        "Margo: Especially now that Mike is back in town. You should talk to Mike before you go rushing down the aisle, again.",
        "Katie: I did talk to Mike. And he and I agreed that we need to move on.",
        "Margo: Okay, so Mike comes back to town. You want to marry Brad yesterday and you want everyone to think that that's a coincidence?",
        "Katie: I don't care what everyone thinks.",
        "Margo: Ooh --",
        "Katie: I care what Brad thinks and I care what I think. And Brad and I think that we don't want to wait. I'm getting married one way or the other, and I would love for you to be my matron of honor, but I can make other plans if that's what you want. So, will you do it or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Mike Kasnoff has got nothing to do with this. And Margo hadn't stopped us from eloping, Katie and I would already be married.",
        "Henry: That -- that might have been better.",
        "Brad: No, no, no -- she wants to have a ceremony with all of our friends and family there to support her. Mike has gotten nothing to say about this. We're getting married, and she's going to have the perfect day she always dreamed of. Now, are you down with that or not?",
        "Henry: Perfect day for Katie? I'm definitely down with that.",
        "Brad: Who are you calling?",
        "Henry: I'm calling my tailor. If we're going to have a perfect wedding, we're going to need tuxes, and soon. Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I would never stand in the way of your happiness. But I am your big sister and I will worry.",
        "Katie: Well, stop worrying. Brad and I really are good together. I promise you. It's taken me a long time to get to this place and please, please, please just support me. Be happy for me. Please!",
        "Margo: Poof, I'm happy!",
        "Katie: Okay, yeah -- will you help me get a dress?",
        "Margo: Okay, let's go.",
        "Katie: That was easy. Stop!",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Margo: You're welcome. I really hope you know what you're doing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mike, I am so sorry. I mean -- I've been there. Hell, I'm still there. Why is it so hard to let go of people?",
        "Mike: Maybe it's because deep down we know letting go of them would be a mistake.",
        "Meg: I guess with certain people -- like Paul is for me, or Katie is for you -- you don't really get over them. Yeah, your feelings might be abused or damaged, but the love doesn't really go away.",
        "Mike: Even after you've messed it all up.",
        "Meg: My trouble is that one day I see a future with Paul and it's beautiful. And then the next, I think I must be some kind of masochist to think of getting involved again. I can't seem to make a decision and stick with it.",
        "Mike: Well, if I'm going to make a decision, I don't have much time. Katie's getting married soon. Do I move on like Katie says she has, or do I do something about the way I feel?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I envy Meg.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Sofie: She made a real difference in your life. She helps you be a better man. And I tried that with Cole and it was a disaster.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe there wasn't any good in Cole to bring out. I'm sure if you meet the right guy, you can work wonders.",
        "Sofie: I hope so. [Cell phone rings] Sorry. Aaron, hi.",
        "Aaron: Hey, I just heard you called in sick. What's wrong?",
        "Sofie: Nothing. Nothing -- I'm not really sick. I've just been helping Paul move his mom into Fairwinds.",
        "Aaron: Okay, well, um -- I'm glad you're all right. Do you need any help?",
        "Sofie: No, no, that's okay. I think Paul and I got it covered. Thank you, though, for calling to check in on me. Um, bye, Aaron.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, it doesn't look like you're going to let Katie go.",
        "Mike: No. Not any time soon, anyway.",
        "Meg: Okay, so how do you plan on changing her mind?",
        "Mike: Damned if I know. If you have any ideas, don't keep them to yourself. In the meantime, thanks for the coffee and the sympathy. I'm going to get back to work.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Aaron: What's up, Mike?",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Meg: Aaron, hey.",
        "Aaron: Hey.",
        "Meg: Okay, first Mike, and now you. Um, is something wrong?",
        "Aaron: Nothing.",
        "Meg: Yeah, right. What's up?",
        "Aaron: It's Sofie. She's with Paul at Fairwinds.",
        "Meg: Really? What's that all about?",
        "Aaron: Probably nothing. She said she was there because she wanted to help Barbara move in. But --",
        "Meg: But?",
        "Aaron: I kind of got the feeling like she was blowing me off for Paul. I mean, you know Paul Ryan a hell of a lot more than I do. I mean, is there something going on here that I should be worried about?",
        "Meg: I know there is one sure way to find out.",
        "Paul: Well, I think my mom's got a great attitude. I just hope she can keep it up.",
        "Sofie: She will. She's going to get better so much faster here, Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Paul: Hello?",
        "Meg: Hey, it's Meg. I hear you brought your mother home to recuperate. How's that going?",
        "Paul: Oh, so far, so good. She's got full-time care. She's -- she seems settled in.",
        "Meg: Did you have any trouble getting her home?",
        "Paul: No, it's no big deal. Sofie helped out. You know my mom, she's very particular. But we're getting everything squared away.",
        "Meg: Well, I hope you're not too tired for lunch out on the farm.",
        "Paul: With you? Never.",
        "Meg: I am so glad to hear you say that. Oh, and of course, I want you to bring Sofie.",
        "Paul: We're on our way.",
        "Meg: Well, guess who's coming to lunch?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Lisa, Katie needs a wedding dress.",
        "Lisa: Well, congratulations. Who's the lucky fellow?",
        "Katie: Brad Snyder.",
        "Lisa: Brad?",
        "Katie: I'm looking for something very chic this time --",
        "Margo: Do you have anything in black?",
        "Katie: Margo, I -- I need it to be a perfect fit also because it's -- I don't have any time for alterations.",
        "Lisa: Oh, well, uh, why the big rush, darling?",
        "Katie: No rush. No, Brad and I just -- we've been wanting to get married for quite some time and we don't see any need to wait.",
        "Lisa: Okay -- uh, how about this one, huh?",
        "Katie: Um --",
        "Lisa: Yes, come on, come on, come on --",
        "Katie: Well, that's not exactly --",
        "Lisa: It's more beautiful on than it is on the hanger. Come along, Girls. Rush, rush, rush. Come on, come on --",
        "Margo: All right --",
        "Lisa: Yes --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Mike: Hello?",
        "Lisa: Mike, its Lisa.",
        "Mike: Hi, Lisa. How are you doing?",
        "Lisa: Uh, well, not -- not doing very well. Listen, I -- I need to ask a favor of you. I have just discovered that I have some -- well, they're bugs -- termites -- they're termites and they're here at Fashions and could you have a look?",
        "Mike: Well, I'm at the Snyder farm right now, but I could come down later today.",
        "Lisa: No, no, no -- that won't do, Mike. My customers can't see them -- you can't imagine the business I would lose if they did.",
        "Mike: Okay, Lisa, we can't have that. I'll be down as soon as I can.",
        "Lisa: Oh -- Katie, today is your lucky day. Wait until you see what I've got for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You understand, Signore? We need the tuxedos soon. Quick. Pronto.",
        "Tailor: Your friend is a huge.",
        "Brad: A huge? What's a huge?",
        "Henry: It's Italian for grande.",
        "Brad: Oh! Oh, what -- come --",
        "Tailor: Why did he jump like that?",
        "Henry: He's -- he's just ticklish. Brad, look, he's just trying to measure the inseam of your trousers. Okay, it's nothing personal. Don't get worried.",
        "Brad: Henry, it felt personal.",
        "Henry: Brad, you're getting married. Now be a man and let the tailor measure your inseam.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Uh, here.",
        "Margo: Oh, look, Katie. More.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Lisa. None of these are working. I just -- I guess I just don't have time to do this right now. I've got to get back to the station --",
        "Margo: Yeah -- I've got to get back to work, too --",
        "Lisa: No -- now, wait just a minute. Katie, you must make time to do this because we're talking about your wedding, Sweetheart, and that is not a decision you want to rush into.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I have to run into town. I just got a call from Lisa. She has termites and she's all bent out of shape.",
        "Meg: So why is she calling you when she should be calling an exterminator?",
        "Mike: Uh, don't worry about it, I'll be back soon. In the meantime, the crew is going to keep working.",
        "Meg: Okay. See you later.",
        "Paul: Hey, Mike. You sure are spending an awful lot of time here at the farm.",
        "Mike: All in the line of duty. Hi, I'm Mike Kasnoff.",
        "Sofie: Sofie. Sofie Duran.",
        "Mike: Well, I'll see you later, Paul. Nice to meet you, Sofie.",

        "Lisa: Oh, come on, Mike!",
        "Lisa: Now, where's the wedding going to be?",
        "Katie: Uh, we haven't quite nailed that down yet.",
        "Margo: I thought you had it all worked out?",
        "Lisa: Honey, you can always postpone it to a later date.",
        "Katie: No. No, if Brad and I can produce an hour television show every day, we can plan a wedding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, Sofie, thank you for coming.",
        "Sofie: Well, thank you for inviting me, Meg.",
        "Meg: Yeah, any friend of Paul's is welcome here at the Snyder farm.",
        "Sofie: Hey, Aaron, I didn't expect -- did you invite me? Was it your idea?",
        "Aaron: Oh, don't look at me. No -- I didn't set this up.",
        "Meg: He's telling the truth. It was all my idea. Oh, we're babysitting Aaron's little brother, Ethan. Aaron, would you mind going -- taking and bringing him in here?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I'll go get him. Sofie, do you want to come with me? Ethan's got a soft spot for pretty girls --",
        "Sofie: No -- I don't -- I don't think --",
        "Meg: Go on. Really.",
        "Sofie: Okay, okay --",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: It's uglier than the first one --",
        "Lisa: You're absolutely right. It's hideous. Take it off. I don't know what's wrong with me today. I just don't -- I just don't seem to be picking any winners whatsoever.",
        "Margo: Lisa, you usually have such a good eye when it comes to what looks good on people.",
        "Lisa: I know, I know -- I guess everybody has an off day. This obviously is mine, but we'll just keep on looking. Now, wait a minute. You know I'm bound to find something. We're bound to hit the jackpot, right? We just have to keep on --",
        "[Coughs]",
        "Margo: Lisa, are you all right?",
        "Lisa: No --",
        "Margo: Lisa?",
        "Lisa: Uh, water.",
        "Margo: Water -- where do I get --",
        "Lisa: Out -- out --",
        "Margo: Out?",
        "Lisa: Bottled water.",
        "Katie: There's a market -- get the market across the street --",
        "Margo: All right, I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: And what is it you think I'm doing, Paul?",
        "Paul: I think that you engineered this whole cold chicken thing, so that you can push Aaron and Sofie together.",
        "Meg: There wasn't much engineering involved.",
        "Paul: You know what I mean.",
        "Meg: Okay, fine, what if it's true? I mean, they're both young and unattached. It seemed like a natural match to me.",
        "Paul: I don't think you should get involved in this.",
        "Meg: Why not? You're involved, aren't you?",
        "Paul: No. I'm just helping Sofie out. She's going through a rough time right now. That's all.",
        "Meg: And I'm helping out my nephew. How does that make me more involved than you are?",
        "[Ethan crying]",
        "Aaron: He got bigger last time I saw him.",
        "Meg: You just saw him this morning.",
        "Aaron: Well, in that case, he's going to be a fullback pretty soon. Sofie, do you want to hold him a second?",
        "Sofie: No -- no.",
        "Aaron: What's wrong -- no?",
        "Sofie: No, I'm sorry.",
        "Aaron: Paul, can you hold him for a second?",
        "Paul: Hey, hey --",
        "Aaron: Sofie!",
        "Paul: What's the matter?",
        "Aaron: Sofie!",
        "Paul: Here -- you know what? You can stand on Emma's counter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Well, now we're talking. I think this is going to be the one.",
        "Katie: I hope so. Is that another customer?",
        "Lisa: Uh -- well, we'll just have to see, won't we? I'll go find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Henry, thank you so much for the tuxedo.",
        "Henry: Hey, Brad, to introduce you to a life of sophistication and elegance, it's what I live for.",
        "Brad: No, I'm serious. You know, I really want to look good -- for Katie. And you know, I just -- it's just good that I can count on you. You're a really -- you're a good friend.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay, you're welcome. I had enough of this manly sincerity. Have a seat. Have something to eat. It's on me.",
        "Brad: I wonder if Katie picked out a dress yet.",
        "Henry: Please, please, please -- these are women's mysteries. They're best left alone. Don't even think about it.",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no -- I have to think about it. Because when she does, that means we tie the knot.",
        "Henry: No --",
        "Brad: I'm going to go see if --",
        "Henry: No, Brad -- no, no. Brad, no, no! What are you insane, man? It is bad luck to see the bride --",
        "Brad: Oh, get real -- it's the 21st century -- okay, we don't need luck. This wedding is a go. It's going to happen. It's going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: So where did you see the termites? Point me in the direction.",
        "Lisa: One of the dressing rooms. I don't remember which one. But --",
        "Mike: Is anyone in there?",
        "Katie: We were so right. This is definitely the --",
        "Mike: Hello, Angel. You sure do look beautiful.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm a little worried about Sofie. You know, maybe I should find her. Make sure she's okay.",

        "Vienna: Oh, Dear, and I thought my language was getting way better.",
        "Henry: Your language, your English, everything is fine. I'm talking about cultural tradition here. Now, when you spill salt, you're supposed to take a little pinch. You toss it over your shoulder or there will be hell to pay. It's bad luck. Do you understand bad luck?",

That is the worst bad luck you can possibly have. Now, you add some spilled salt to that, and you're a dead duck, my friend.",

        "Margo: No, not at all.",
        "Brad: Then why is she still hiding in the dressing room?",
        "Margo: Because um -- women are very emotional before they get married. So, you know, you have to make allowances.",
        "Brad: I can do that.",
        "Margo: Okay. And she's going to be all right, really, she is. She'll be out in a minute. And in the meantime, Lisa, you and I are going to take a little sit on the bench and we're going to talk about nightmares. That was so mean, what you did to Katie.",

        "Margo: Yes, I do think, but Katie's made it very clear to me that she doesn't care what anybody thinks. So, my little sister wants a wedding and that's what I'm going to give her.",
