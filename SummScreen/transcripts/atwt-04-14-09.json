        "Meg: I see you.",
        "Paul: She's perfect.",
        "[Meg gasps]",
        "Meg: She is the most perfect little girl in the world.",
        "Paul: See how bright-eyed she is now.",
        "Meg: I know. It's the first time she's been willing to play in a while. I guess those antibiotics really worked.",
        "[Eliza coughs]",
        "Meg: Oh, here, Honey. Here.",
        "Paul: I think that -- you being her mom had something to do with it. I heard you walking her back and forth all night long.",
        "Meg: I would do anything for my daughter. You know that.",
        "Paul: Well, now she's back to her old self, you can go. Seriously. We'll be fine. You should leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hello, Dr. Hughes, Mrs. Hughes. You look great.",
        "Nancy: Thank you very much, Alison -- or should I be saying \"Nurse Stewart\"?",
        "Alison: Uh, not yet.",
        "Bob: Although I have been getting very good reports from her instructors.",
        "Alison: Oh, thank you, Dr. Hughes. Is today your day to work in the library? Because I have some eager patients who want to see you in pediatrics.",
        "Nancy: Well, I'm sorry, but they'll have to wait until tomorrow, 'cause I came here today for a checkup.",
        "Alison: Oh, is everything okay?",
        "Bob: Just routine.",
        "Alison: Ah! Well, must be nice to have pickup service provided by the head of the hospital.",
        "Nancy: Usually, I take the senior van, but the driver quit today, and the head of the hospital is such a skinflint that he won't hire anyone to take his place.",
        "Bob: Well, in defense of the chief of staff of this hospital, there has been a hospital-wide hiring freeze. But I tell you what I'll do. I'll get some volunteers to drive the senior van.",
        "Nancy: We don't need the volunteers. We need somebody who will take over the senior-citizen operation and do it completely.",
        "Bob: You're absolutely right, and it's a big job.",
        "Alison: Well, guess what? I may know just the right person to do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Jade, are you okay?",
        "Jade: You asked me that like you care.",
        "[Casey scoffs]",
        "Casey: I do.",
        "Jade: Right. That's why you ditched me.",
        "Casey: That's after I found out my ex was paying you to sleep with me.",
        "Jade: It was more than that and you know it, Casey. I was really into you. The money was just a bonus.",
        "[Scoffs]",
        "Casey: That's so wrong on so many levels. But okay, let's just -- let's just get past it. Are you waiting for someone?",
        "Jade: Why, jealous?",
        "Casey: You looked kind of on edge. I think you might need help. But obviously, I was wrong.",
        "Jade: Wait, Casey! I think you may be able to help me with something.",
        "Casey: Yeah? What do you need?",
        "Jade: Do you know where I could score some pot?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I said you could stay here until Eliza got better. She's better.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know.",
        "Paul: Really, you need to go.",
        "Meg: Paul, look, I know what we agreed on.",
        "Paul: Okay, fine, I'll have the housekeeper get your stuff together.",
        "Meg: Paul, wait.",
        "Paul: Look, the sooner you go, the sooner everyone can adjust. This is the way things are gonna be from now on.",
        "Meg: Look at our little girl. Look how healthy she is, how happy. We did that. We got her through this together.",
        "Paul: Fine. What's your point?",
        "[Meg stammers]",
        "Meg: My point is -- we should be celebrating. We should be celebrating her recovery, not fighting over her.",
        "Paul: I don't have any champagne on hand.",
        "Meg: Not like that. Look, we -- we've been all cooped up in here for days. Let's take our daughter out into the sunshine. Maybe we could grab some lunch somewhere.",
        "Paul: I don't think she cares where she eats.",
        "Meg: One lunch, Paul. Is that too much to ask?",
        "Paul: Fine. A family lunch. I'll make a reservation at the Lakeview.",
        "Meg: Not the Lakeview.",
        "Paul: Really? Why not?",
        "Meg: You know why not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: This dragon is going to eat you. Hmm? Did that thing scare you?",
        "Lucy: Dusty --",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Lucy: Dusty, don't encourage him! God, I feel like I'm having lunch with two little boys, not just one.",
        "Dusty: She thinks playing with your food's immature, but we know better, don't we?",
        "Johnny: Mm-hmm. Yeah.",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Lucy: God, Johnny, look at your face. Go ask Dave the waiter for some extra napkins, okay?",
        "Dusty: Go ahead. He knows the waiters by name?",
        "Johnny: Oh, just Dave, 'cause he knows to bring him extra French fries -- some of which usually get eaten when you're not around.",
        "Dusty: Sorry.",
        "Lucy: I'm not. Johnny really cheered you up.",
        "Dusty: I was feeling pretty low after what happened with Meg.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Well, if my father wasn't coming back to New York this afternoon, then I would see if I could keep this going a little longer.",
        "Dusty: Thank you for letting me spend time with my son.",
        "Lucy: Well, he is a miracle worker. God, I didn't think anybody could get a smile back on your face, but he did it.",
        "Dusty: No, you did it. I can't thank you enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Why would you object to lunch at the Lakeview? You can have a meal with me and Eliza, and then you can run upstairs and visit your boyfriend. You get the best of both worlds.",
        "Meg: Stop it, Paul! Dusty and I are finished.",
        "Paul: Yeah, whatever you say.",
        "Meg: You of all people should understand.",
        "Paul: You think I had something to do with the two of you breaking up?",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Meg: Of course you did.",
        "Paul: Well, at least now you know the truth about him. He's not the hero he pretends to be. It's good you figured out what he's capable of before you got in it too deep.",
        "Meg: Oh, so you're admitting you planned it, that everything you told the social worker was a lie?",
        "Paul: Why would I admit to something that I didn't do? I've done nothing wrong. I have nothing to feel guilty about.",
        "Meg: Not even when the things that you told the social worker made her decide that I was unfit to take care of my own daughter?",
        "Paul: You did leave our little girl alone in the kitchen, you did almost burn your mother's house down, and your lunatic boyfriend almost beat me to death. Sounds to me like Dusty's the one who should spend a little time in the rubber room.",
        "Meg: I do know what happened, Paul. And I do know that there's nothing I can do to make you change your story.",
        "Paul: Why would I change my story? My story's the truth?",
        "Meg: Okay, you know what? It doesn't matter. Whatever you did or said to provoke Dusty, his reaction was uncalled for. I -- I would never be with someone who attacked you, who attacked anyone so viciously. That's why I'm not seeing him anymore.",
        "Paul: Well, all right, then. Shouldn't be a problem with us having lunch at the Lakeview, right?",
        "Meg: You know what? You're right. Lakeview it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I can't believe you. After Reg O.D.'ing and everything that happened with Elwood, you -- you're actually trying to buy pot in Old Town?",
        "Jade: \"Trying\" being the operative word.",
        "Casey: Why would you think that I know where to get pot?",
        "Jade: You're young. You're a guy. You went to college. I don't know. I was just doing the math.",
        "Casey: Well, you did it wrong.",
        "Jade: But you're actually telling me you've never smoked pot before? What, did you not inhale?",
        "Casey: What I may or may not have done is not the point. I've done a lot of messed-up things, but getting busted for drugs is not one of them. That's stupid.",
        "Jade: You know what, Casey? A simple \"No, Jade, I don't know where you can score\" would have been just fine.",
        "Casey: No, Jade, I don't know where you can score.",
        "Jade: Fine. Thank you for wasting my time and yours.",
        "Casey: What is your problem?",
        "Jade: My problem is you're still standing here!",
        "Casey: I -- I think I can fix that problem, easily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I can't promise anything, but let me talk to the person I'm thinking of and see if he might be able to pitch in.",
        "Nancy: Do you think he'll be interested in helping a bunch of senior citizens?",
        "Alison: Maybe not at first, but I think I might be able to talk him into it.",
        "Bob: Well, good luck, and let me know what happens after you talk to Casey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Casey: Ali, hi.",
        "Alison: Hey. Casey, where are you?",
        "Casey: Java. Why?",
        "Alison: Uh, stay there. I'm on my way over now. I have a really important question to ask you.",
        "Casey: It's not about where to buy pot, is it?",
        "Alison: Uh -- of course not. Where did that come from?",
        "Casey: Long, very boring story. But never mind. I'll see you in a few, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: \"10 steps to boosting the buzz in your life.\" You know, I read that once.",
        "Williams: Huh?",
        "Jade: You know what it taught me? You can't read your way to a buzz. I'm sure we both know there are better methods than that out there.",
        "Williams: That's for sure.",
        "Jade: You know, I've been so tense lately. I could really use something to relax.",
        "Williams: What'd you have in mind?",
        "Jade: Why don't you tell me? You seem like a guy who could show a girl where to find a little chemical relaxation. But nothing major. Just like a joint or two. Do you know where I could find some?",
        "Williams: I sure do.",
        "Jade: Great.",
        "Williams: Sorry to be a buzz kill, but you're under arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You heading back to the office?",
        "Dusty: No. I don't feel up for it. When do you have to get back to the hospital?",
        "Lucy: Well, I have a double shift tonight to make up for the time that I've been spending with Johnny, but that's not for a few hours, so -- after I drop him off at afternoon kindergarten, I've got some time to myself.",
        "Dusty: Lucky you. Be a good boy at school today, all right?",
        "Johnny: I will, Daddy.",
        "Dusty: Bye, Buddy.",
        "Lucy: I'm probably gonna regret this, but do you want to go to a movie with me?",
        "Dusty: What about \"Time to yourself\"?",
        "Lucy: Well, I'll trade it in for some time in the dark with popcorn and a soda.",
        "Dusty: I pick the movie.",
        "Lucy: I knew I was gonna regret this. All right. How bloody and horrific is it gonna be?",
        "Dusty: You just get my boy to kindergarten. I'll be waiting for you here, finishing my coffee.",
        "Lucy: And picking up the perfect movie to destroy my afternoon?",
        "Dusty: Could you freshen up my coffee?",
        "Dave: Oh, certainly, Sir.",
        "Dusty: Are you Dave?",
        "Dave: Yes, Sir.",
        "Dusty: Thanks for always giving my son extra French fries.",
        "Dave: Anytime. Be right back with the coffee.",
        "Dusty: On second thought, forget about the coffee. Put everything on my tab.",
        "Paul: There goes your boyfriend. Why don't you run after Dusty? Eliza and I can stay here. We'll be fine.",
        "Meg: I'm not running after Dusty ever again.",
        "Paul: Just leave her in there. It'll be easier, don't you think?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: I can't believe it. Pretty soon, she'll be able to order right out of the menu, on your own, right? Right, Honey?",
        "Paul: Solid food. There's a thought, huh?",
        "Meg: Of course, we'll have to introduce it slowly.",
        "[Eliza babbles]",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: I'll do that. You don't need to worry.",
        "Meg: I'm sure you will. I'm just saying if you need help --",
        "Paul: I'm sure I can manage, thanks.",
        "Meg: You know what? I think she needs a change.",
        "Paul: I'll take her.",
        "Meg: Don't be silly! There's no changing tables in the men's room.",
        "Paul: I'm not letting you and Eliza walk out of here alone.",
        "Meg: If you're afraid that I'm gonna take her outside and run off, I will leave my purse here. I can't get very far without it. I'll be right back.",
        "Dusty: This is a dangerous game you're playing. How long are you gonna keep it up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: So, what is this question you have? And please tell me it involves you being naked.",
        "Alison: Uh, it's about your community-service project. So no, there is no nudity involved.",
        "[Groans]",
        "Casey: You can't blame a guy for trying.",
        "Alison: You haven't definitely decided on what you're gonna do?",
        "Casey: I'm still considering my options.",
        "Alison: Okay, 'cause the Dean's offer to let you back into school, Casey -- it's not gonna, you know, stay open forever.",
        "Casey: I know. I was -- I was thinking that, uh, asking Luke if I could help out with his foundation. They're starting an after-school program.",
        "Alison: No, I know. Um, but you haven't finalized anything with Luke yet, have you?",
        "Casey: Not yet.",
        "Alison: Okay, so you don't even know if there's a position available?",
        "Casey: No, I don't.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, I do know about a position that would be perfect for you.",
        "Casey: Really?",
        "Alison: Okay, get your mind out of the gutter.",
        "Casey: Well, stop talking about positions.",
        "Alison: Okay, I know about an opportunity that is available right now. And get this -- it's connected with the hospital.",
        "Casey: Connected with the hospital, which means spending time at Memorial and maybe running into you in the hallways?",
        "Alison: This is kind of what I was thinking.",
        "Casey: Well, yeah. Now you got my attention.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Thanks, Williams. I'll take it from here. Come on in. Jade -- I am so disappointed in you. Why are you here?",
        "Jade: Believe me, I don't want to be here, either. This is just a huge misunderstanding.",
        "Margo: You tried to buy drugs from an undercover cop.",
        "Jade: After an open invitation. You should have seen him, Margo. He totally offered to sell me pot.",
        "Margo: Sitting on a bench, reading a book, and you approached him?",
        "Jade: That is not how it happened.",
        "Margo: Hmm. You were both in Old Town, right, by the jewelry store? Well, there's a surveillance camera right there on the corner, so maybe we should just go to the videotape and see who's telling the truth.",
        "Jade: Fine. I went up to him.",
        "Margo: Fine, okay. Why?",
        "Jade: I was trying to buy weed, like you said. Can you just book me and get it over with?",
        "Margo: Wow. It's that easy for you to go to jail?",
        "Jade: Jail?",
        "Margo: Yeah. People who commit a crime go to jail.",
        "Jade: Weed's not like dangerous or anything. I mean, most people want it to be legal.",
        "Margo: Some people think little green men dance on their heads. It doesn't matter! The law says it's illegal. I just want to know why you did it.",
        "Jade: 'Cause my life sucks, okay? I have a new dad that doesn't want me. My ex just tried to kill me. And I try to get a job, and no one will hire me. So with nothing going on in my life, why not get a little high?",
        "Margo: I cannot believe you let some sleazy nothing like Robbie Sanchez ruin your life.",
        "Jade: What about a nice guy like your son, who dumped me like I was garbage? He can't say two words to me without letting me know what a waste of space he thinks I am. The worst part is, is I was dumb enough to think he actually cared. May actually like me. Stupid, right?",
        "Margo: No. You're not stupid, Jade. Just had a lot of tough times. And I'm sorry if my son added to that.",
        "Jade: Can you do me a favor?",
        "Margo: Well, that depends on what it is.",
        "Jade: Can we not tell Derek that this happened? I don't want him to know that the daughter he doesn't even want is more of a screw-up than he thought. Look, if I have to post bail, can we just call Lily?",
        "Margo: No, I don't think that will be necessary.",
        "Jade: Oh, come on! You have to at least let me post bail!",
        "Margo: Well, not if I'm not bringing charges.",
        "Jade: You're not? What's the catch?",
        "Margo: You are gonna do something for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You want me to drive a minivan, like a soccer mom?",
        "Alison: I don't think anyone is gonna mistake you for a soccer mom.",
        "Casey: But it's still a van, and it's for seniors. They're gonna make me want to drive like 10 miles an hour.",
        "Alison: You only have to do that part of the time! What they really need is someone who can organize the volunteers -- you know, set up the schedules.",
        "Casey: I don't know. It sounds like a lot of paperwork and calling people.",
        "Alison: Exactly. That's just the kind of stuff you did when you were managing Luke's campaign.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and we all know how well that turned out.",
        "Alison: Okay, the point is you have the skills, Casey. And -- and now you'll have a chance to use them so you can really help people.",
        "Casey: I -- I don't know. I don't think they're looking for someone with my track record.",
        "Alison: But the point of all this is to change your track record. Plus you'll be helping your great-grandmother.",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm. And seeing you in Memorial.",
        "Alison: Yes. And you'll be helping people get access to medical care.",
        "Casey: Running into you at Memorial?",
        "Casey: I could kiss you at Memorial?",
        "Alison: Okay, then maybe you can impress the Dean, make him see that letting you back into school is the right thing to do. So what's it gonna be, Casey? Are you, uh, man enough to wrangle the seniors of Oakdale?",
        "Casey: Oh, well, when you put it that way, I --",
        "[Imitating John Wayne]",
        "Casey: I might want to wrangle up a pretty little filly.",
        "Alison: Okay, you so do not sound like a cowboy.",
        "Casey: Oh, come on. I'm trying. I -- I just need a little practice.",
        "Alison: Well, why don't you practice helping some senior citizens, and then we'll see what happened later?",
        "Casey: Do I get a little reward?",
        "Alison: Do you need a reward to do the right thing?",
        "Casey: A little encouragement wouldn't hurt.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: So maybe I'll give you a little encouragement. But I'm not putting anything in writing.",
        "Casey: Okay, okay. Let's go to the hospital, sign up. I'm in the mood for some encouragement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Here is a list of our community-service options.",
        "Jade: Why, so I can wear an orange jumpsuit and pick up trash? No way.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Orange is not for you. We'll find something that's a little more color-coordinated.",
        "Jade: So it's jail or community service?",
        "Margo: No. Its jail or you get a handle on your life. You said yourself that you don't have anything in your life that matters. And I can't tell you how many of those guys down there sitting in the cells start off the same way. Hate to see another kid go that direction.",
        "Jade: Why are you doing this?",
        "Margo: 'Cause there's a lot of people in your life who care about you and think that you're worthwhile. Maybe I should give you the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Jade: So community service is supposed to save me?",
        "Margo: No, Jade. You are gonna save you. Community service is just giving you something to do in the interim. But I can't tell you what stops a pity party faster than seeing that there's someone else in the world who's worse off than you are.",
        "Jade: Thanks.",
        "Margo: No, don't thank me. Community service is not so much fun.",
        "Jade: Well, I'm sure it's better than jail or paying a fine that I can't afford. All right. So, um, what are these jobs?",
        "Margo: Well, why don't you start with the jobs at the hospital? They can always use volunteers.",

        "Dusty: You wouldn't go near him if he didn't have custody.",
        "Meg: You're wrong. Being at Fairwinds and seeing Paul and Eliza reminded me of how I wanted things to be, the three of us as a family.",

        "Margo: Yes. Yes, she has been. No doubt about that. Um, but I'm hoping that if she does something good in her life, then she'll get used to it. And, look, I -- I can't guarantee that she'll be perfect, but she knows that she'll go to jail if she doesn't do everything that you tell her to do.",

        "Lucy: Yeah. Apparently, he found out that this venture is not entirely legal.",

        "Jade: How hard could it be? Find a few people with cars, tell them where to go and when.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. This is a bad idea. Ali, Grandma, I'm sorry. Jade, it's yours. Start giving orders. Have a ball.",

        "Nancy: Well, of course, Dear. Where do you think you're going?",
        "Jade: To find a new community-service assignment. You seem like a nice lady. I'm not. You probably want some nice, quiet kid working next to you. Again, I'm so not. So let's just cut our losses.",

        "Alison: Wow. There is always an excuse, isn't there? If it wasn't Jade, it would be something else.",
        "Casey: I'll find somewhere else to do community service. There's always Luke's foundation.",
        "Alison: But you haven't even called him yet! Besides, Luke has millions of dollars behind him. The people at the hospital -- they really need your help, Casey. Isn't the point of community service to help the people who need you the most?",
        "Casey: You really want me to work with Jade?",
        "Alison: Of course not. But you want to know what bothers me the most, is the fact that it bothers you!",
        "Casey: Okay, okay -- you're officially not making any sense.",
        "Alison: Is it because, like, you're still attracted to her? Do you think if you're working together, you guys will hook up?",
        "Casey: No, no! I'd rather -- I don't even want to look at her! No!",
        "Alison: Okay. So then step up to the plate. Your grandfather said that both of you guys could work on the project.",
        "Casey: She acts like she's in charge.",
        "Alison: So? You act the same way. And like you said, she probably doesn't even know half of what's involved.",
        "Casey: Yeah. She'll probably screw it up worse than I would.",
        "Alison: Okay, so Casey, this community needs you, and you need this. If you want anything worth having, you're gonna have to commit to get it! And if you have to work with people who are pains in the butt, well, so what? You're just gonna have to suck it up like the rest of us.",
        "Casey: Okay.",

        "Dusty: That's okay. I can take care of myself.",
