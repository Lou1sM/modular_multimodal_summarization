        "Jessica: You're on your way to Craig's wedding, aren't you? I shouldn't have called you.",
        "Margo: No, you should. Something happened?",
        "Jessica: Last night, Marshall admitted that he raped me.",
        "Margo: What? Tell me everything.",
        "Jessica: It was just the two of us. There were no witnesses, of course. And he'll never admit it again. But he said it, Margo. He -- he knows what he did. He admitted it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Newman: Marshall -- I need you to take a look at this witness list. Before we are finished, that jury is going to believe that Jessica Griffin seduced you and then framed you just to get back at you for her humiliating loss.",
        "Marshall: It's over, Newman. I've reconsidered my defense. I want to talk to the D.A. about a plea bargain.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Barbara gasps]",
        "Barbara: My fire! My fire! My fire went out! Oh, no! And no one saw my smoke! No one's gonna come rescue me. And that was my only match! [Barbara screams] I hear you out there! I hear you out there! And you are not going to win! Do you understand?! You thought I was crazy before? You thought I was crazy before? Well, you coward! You're dead! Do you understand me? Because I'm gonna get out of here, and I'm gonna make you pay! You better run! Run! You understand, you coward?! Run!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey, we checked out that Jane Doe in Quincy.",
        "Hal: Barbara?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Hal: Thank God. What about the other reports?",
        "Jack: I've got everything set up in the interrogation room.",
        "Hal: Let me just check out these sightings, then we'll take off for the wedding.",
        "Emily: Okay, sure.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: And this cabin is where? The pine barrens? Okay. \"A voice inside screaming like a banshee.\" Yeah, I got it. We'll check it out.",
        "Emily: They found the eagle. And we're about to be a bunch of dead ducks. What are we going to do?",
        "Rose: Three things. First, we deny, then we deny, and then we deny more. Just take a deep breath, okay? And I'll see you at the wedding.",
        "Dusty: Trouble?",
        "Rose: Ooh, yeah. Barbara's about to be set loose on the world again. What was I thinking? Trusting a yutz like Montgomery?",
        "Dusty: And you're going to the yutz's wedding, too. Why?",
        "Rose: Lucy wants the whole family tree. And Paul is looking forward to it, so we go.",
        "Dusty: Hey, we were just talking about you. Come on in.",
        "Paul: So I take it you two are finished talking shop? Wow.",
        "Rose: All ready for a wedding.",
        "Dusty: Why don't you guys come and double date with me and Molly?",
        "Rose: That's a great idea.",
        "Paul: No, that'd be nice, but I gotta get there a little early.",
        "Rose: Why do you gotta get there early?",
        "Paul: I have a little investigating to do.",
        "Dusty: Investigating, huh?",
        "Paul: Yeah. There are tunnels under Fairwinds that my father used to use, and Craig knows about them. If he's got my mother, he's hiding her there.",
        "Rose: Huh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Emily, Emily, everything will be fine. Just calm down. I'm the one getting married today. I'm the one who's supposed to have the jitters.",
        "Emily: You're worried about slipping a ring on Rosanna's finger? I'm worried about my super-cop husband slipping a pair of handcuffs on me. And if it happens, Craig, I swear to God, I'm singing like a canary. And you're gonna spend your honeymoon --",
        "Craig: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Hi, darling. What are we going to do? It's freezing.",
        "Craig: No, everything'll be fine. But we'd better get the show on the road before the rain comes.",
        "Rosanna: Rain? It can't rain on our wedding day.",
        "Craig: Everything will be fine. But you better get that dress on in record time. We can make an honest woman of you before the raindrops fall.",
        "Rosanna: No, you can't kiss me yet. It's bad luck. So you just bribe somebody, do an anti-rain dance, do whatever you have to do. Just don't let it rain on my wedding day.",
        "Craig: Don't worry.",
        "[Rosanna laughs]",
        "Craig: Just don't let Bar-Bar swoop down on her broom before the \"I dos\" are done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Claire: Woe.",
        "Regina: Here's your patient, Dr. Hughes. Are all these visits medically necessary?",
        "Chris: I'm pretty sure this'll be the last time you'll be seeing me here.",
        "Alison: Chris --",
        "Chris: Listen, the only reason I came here is to tell you to lay off the phone calls. My father's already warned me that if I don't stay away from here, I could lose my job.",
        "Alison: And if you don't get me out of here, Chris, I could die. I mean it.",
        "Chris: Look, Alison, you're fine. Give it a few weeks, and you will be. But if you keep this up, we're both gonna get burned. Take care, okay?",
        "Alison: You can't just leave me here. Tell them -- tell them that I'm sick. Tell them that I'm dying, which is kind of true. Tell them anything, just get me out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Have you seen my little train case? It's got my stockings and my makeup in it. And I haven't been able to find it. I thought I put it --",
        "Lily: Hello? Hi!",
        "Carly: Hello.",
        "Emma: Happy wedding day.",
        "Rosanna: What are you doing here?",
        "Carly: We're here for the wedding. Have you forgotten?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well -- you're early, aren't you? I wasn't expecting you so early, unless my watch stopped.",
        "Lily: No, Craig mentioned that you might want to move up the ceremony because of the weather.",
        "Emma: Yes.",
        "Lily: So we --",
        "Emma: We thought we'd come by and give you a hand. Yes?",
        "Rosanna: Oh. He did? Well, isn't he just the most wonderful man in the world? [Laughter] You're here to help, too?",
        "Carly: What are sisters for?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. Everybody's being so nice to me today. I just can't believe I'm getting married.",
        "Carly: Let's go.",
        "[Speaking over each other]",
        "Emma: So beautiful.",
        "Lily: Um -- we'll take care of Rosanna. You just --",
        "Lucy: But I want to help her.",
        "Lily: I know you do. But you should stay here.",
        "Lucy: Aaron? Look at you. You look so handsome.",
        "Aaron: Me? No, you're beautiful.",
        "Lucy: My heart's beating like it's gonna burst.",
        "Aaron: You're not nervous about walking down that aisle, are you?",
        "Lucy: No. I'm nervous about falling.",
        "Aaron: You're gonna do great. But any time you want to back out --",
        "Lucy: No. Gloria says I'm ready. And you think I'm ready. And I am. I'm ready for my father to start letting us see each other again. All this sneaking around, it stops today. But you have to go before we get caught.",
        "Aaron: I love you.",
        "Lucy: I love you, too. I'll see you soon.",
        "Aaron: Break a leg.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Ah. A bit chilly for an outdoor wedding, don't you think?",
        "Craig: Well, the temperature has dropped a bit since you arrived. What are you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I was invited by your daughter. She told me to come. And she's very thrilled, you know, about being a member of this wedding. I wouldn't have missed this for anything.",
        "Craig: So I suppose that means you'll be staying?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yes. Yes. I've always loved it when the circus came to town. [Laughter] Anyway, I have to stick it out, so that I can offer my condolences to the newest Mrs. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Tom: Hey. I neglected to ask, who is the best man?",
        "Craig: Oh, well, being an independent thinker, I've decided to go without.",
        "Tom: Oh. Well, I was going to offer my services, but since you've got it covered --",
        "Craig: You'd do that for me?",
        "Tom: Yeah. I mean, I -- I am no substitute for Bryant. I know you'd rather have your son here than anybody else, especially on this day. But I also know you'd like Rosanna to be welcomed into the family. So I thought, why don't we go ahead and do this thing right? You might not have an army of friends, but you're family, I mean, you got. What do you say?",
        "Craig: Well, now that you mention it, it'd be nice to have a wingman to hold the jewelry, take some of the pressure off.",
        "Tom: Yeah? Well, let's get this thing done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Emily: Rose, hi.",
        "Paul: Hey, Emily. Any news about mom?",
        "Rose: You wanna look at those presents over there, em?",
        "Emily: I'd love to, Rose.",
        "Rose: Any word on Barbara?",
        "Emily: Are you kidding me? I keep having these visions of her blowing in this place with the watch and waving it in Hal's face. This is --",
        "Rose: Just take a deep breath and -- take a deep breath. Have a glass of champagne. We stick to the original plan.",
        "Emily: The plan?",
        "Rose: Deny, deny, deny.",
        "Hal: Paul, you don't really think Craig would grab Barbara and hide her here, do you?",
        "Paul: Well, I don't know. He's a lot like my father. They both like to hide their crimes in plain sight.",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Rose: Hi.",
        "Carly: So did you hear the news?",
        "Rose: Huh?",
        "Emily: What news?",
        "Carly: Miracle of miracles. I designed an entire line for Monte Carlo.",
        "Rose: You're kidding!",
        "Carly: I showed it to Rosanna, and she loves it. Now I have to admit, Barbara had me quaking in my pumps there for a minute. I've never been blocked like that before, and I was worried. But -- but somehow I busted through it. And I wouldn't have been able to without friends like you. And Barbara, wherever she is.",
        "Rose: I think we should have some champagne. Make a little toast to Monte Carlo.",
        "Emily: To your new beginning.",
        "Carly: Oh, and to Barbara Ryan. For disappearing. She's finally giving the people what they want.",
        "Emily: Right, okay, come on.",
        "Paul: Maybe it is a long shot, but I'm checking those tunnels.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: John Dixon's over there. Maybe we should go mingle with him, huh?",
        "Molly: Where is he? I don't see him.",
        "Dusty: He's right over there, unless you're looking at somebody else.",
        "Molly: No. No one in particular.",
        "Dusty: I thought you said he wasn't going to be here.",
        "Molly: Well, I just assumed. But I was wrong. What does it matter anyway?",
        "Dusty: Just as long as you're not using me to make him jealous.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I wish I didn't have to leave you like this.",
        "Jessica: It's okay. Bonnie's here.",
        "Margo: Okay, good.",
        "Jessica: I won't be alone.",
        "Margo: No. Never.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Newman: Are you out of your mind? You make a plea bargain now, that's as good as an admission of guilt. You'd be a convicted felon. That means jail time, Marshall. You'd be disbarred. Do you want that stigma hanging over your family's name?",
        "Marshall: All right, fine, okay, all right.",
        "Newman: No, it's not all right. I need that jury to believe that Jessica Griffin is a sex-starved woman, a lady in public, and a whore behind doors. She couldn't get enough of her doctor boyfriend, so she came crawling back to you for more.",
        "Marshall: That isn't what happened, Newman.",
        "Newman: Well, that's the way the game is played, my friend. Now what do you want to do? You want to quit? Or you want to win?",
        "Marshall: Win.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: There she is. Jess.",
        "Jessica: Oh, Kim.",
        "Kim: Oh, I'm so glad we found you.",
        "Jessica: Thanks for coming, Bob.",
        "Bob: Hi, Jess.",
        "Jessica: What's the matter? Is something wrong?",
        "Kim: Well, listen, I don't know if you've heard about this already or not, but I don't want you to go into the courtroom without knowing who's taking the stand next.",
        "Jessica: What? Some kind of expert or something?",
        "Kim: No. Ben.",
        "Jessica: Ben Harris?",
        "Kim: Yeah.",
        "Bob: He was subpoenaed.",
        "Jessica: He never said a word of it to me.",
        "Bonnie: Okay, mom -- mom, it's going to be fine.",
        "Jessica: Of course it is. Of course it is, sweetie. Listen, why don't you go on inside? I need to duck into the ladies' room for a minute. I'll be fine. Really. Go. How am I going to do this, Kim? I mean, I expected them to attack me, to destroy my reputation, but to use Ben to do it?",
        "Bailiff: Court is back in session.",
        "Kim: You can do this. Are you ready?",
        "Jessica: As I'll ever be.",
        "Kim: Good. Come on.",
        "Newman: The defense calls Dr. Benjamin Harris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I checked the tunnels under the house, and they are all sealed.",
        "Rose: Well, that's good, right? Because now you can relax, enjoy the wedding, maybe get a couple of pointers for us.",
        "Paul: Okay, all right. As soon as the ceremony starts, I'm going to slip inside the house and take a look around. Okay? Montgomery wanted my mother out of the way, and now she is gone. And once I find her, I'll make him and whoever helped him regret this till the day they die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Mike. What a surprise. You remember Dusty.",
        "Mike: How's it going?",
        "Molly: I didn't expect to see you here. With all your history with Rosanna and everything, I just -- I did not think that she'd be inviting you.",
        "Katie: Oh, she didn't. I did.",
        "Molly: Really?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Molly: Maybe we should go find our seats.",
        "Mike: What was that all about?",
        "Katie: Well, if she wants to date some other guy, then fine. It's called moving on. We all have to do it at some point. But it's not okay for her to flaunt it in front of your face when you're about to hear words like \"love\" and \"cherish\" and \"forever,\" and she'll know damn well that you're thinking about her. You'll thank me later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: What do you think?",
        "Margo: Wow! You look spectacular.",
        "Carly: That is an understatement.",
        "Rosanna: You really think so?",
        "Lucy: You look beautiful.",
        "Margo: Oh, yeah, Craig's going to have to have CPR when he sees you walking down the aisle. Okay, all the cell phones are turned off, and I confiscated Craig's. So we're good to go for a wedding.",
        "Rosanna: Margo, thank you so much.",
        "Margo: Oh, no. Thank you. Thank you for making my brother the happiest man in town. And welcome to the family.",
        "Rosanna: Everybody really has to stop being so nice to me. I don't know what to do.",
        "Carly: Whatever you do, don't cry. You'll ruin your makeup.",
        "Margo: I know what to do -- let's get the party started. Here, I'll help you out.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much.",
        "Lily: I'll get the door.",
        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: I don't know what's wrong with me today. I expected to be nervous. I didn't expect to be hysterical. You don't think I'm making a mistake marrying Craig, do you?",
        "Carly: Do you love him?",
        "Rosanna: I'm mad about him.",
        "Carly: Well, then you're doing the right thing. This was meant to be.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you so much for this day. You've made it so special. Thank you for calming my nerves and making me feel like a princess. Really, you've been wonderful. You've been like a real sister.",
        "Carly: Just don't cry. If you ruin that makeup, I will never forgive you.",
        "Rosanna: Could you do me a favor? Do you have any advice for me?",
        "Carly: Advice? From me? Okay. Well, if I were about to marry the man of my dreams, I would never take one moment with him for granted. I would keep no secrets. And I would always put him first. And when you walk down that aisle in a few minutes, try to remember every beautiful thing about this day, and when he slips that ring on your finger, never let him go. Not even for a minute. Or you will regret it for the rest of your life.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: That's my cue. Wish me luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Are you surprised, daddy?",
        "Craig: No. No. I just imagined this old heart couldn't get any happier. And you do something like -- what else have you been doing behind my back?",
        "Lucy: We'll talk about it later.",
        "Craig: Okay, all right. Well, listen, do you think you can help me back up there? I'm feeling a little shaky.",
        "Lucy: I'd love to. Just lean on me.",
        "Craig: Let's go.",
        "Lucy: We did it, grandmother.",
        "Lucinda: You did it. You did it. And I knew you would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: What do you think I can do?",
        "Alison: Well, can't you just give me something that'll make it only seem like I'm dead? And once I'm on the outside and I'm free again --",
        "Chris: Alison, you've seen way too many movies. Okay? I'm not helping you fake your death so you can escape.",
        "Alison: I'm not trying to escape. This -- Chris, this is a shank. They stole it from the cafeteria, and they sharpened it somehow. And then they put it under my mattress. Do you believe me, no?",
        "Chris: We gotta find a way to get you out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?",
        "Ben: I do.",
        "Judge: You may have a seat, Dr. Harris.",
        "Ben: Sorry, your honor, I cannot take the stand.",
        "Judge: Are you ill, Dr. Harris? Should we take a recess?",
        "Ben: Jessica Griffin is the finest woman I know. And she was raped by T. Marshall Travers.",
        "Judge: Counselor, what is the meaning of this?",
        "Newman: That's what I would like to know, your honor.",
        "Ben: That man is guilty! And he has to pay for his crime.",
        "Judge: Bailiff, please remove the jury from the courtroom. Mr. Newman, if you cannot control your witness, I will hold you both in contempt.",
        "Marshall: Do something, Newman!",
        "Ben: You can do whatever you want to me. You can lock me up if you have to, but I will not let anybody use me against Jessica!",
        "Judge: Bailiff -- get him out of here.",
        "Ben: She spoke the truth when it would have been easier to remain silent. And I will not take the stand and twist my words against her.",
        "Judge: Mr. Harris! Bailiff, get him out of here!",
        "Ben: I am standing for the truth with Jessica Griffin.",
        "Judge: Order!",
        "Ben: You know what you did to her, Travers!",
        "Judge: Order in the court!",
        "Ben: Tell the truth, if you remember how!",
        "Judge: Order in the court!",
        "Ben: He's guilty! He's guilty! He knows he is guilty!",
        "Judge: Get him out of here, bailiff! Now!",

        "Craig: I give you this ring as a symbol of our vows.",

        "Alison: I know I'm no angel. And I've done and I've said a lot of things that I wish I could take back. But I don't deserve to die, Chris. Not in this disgusting place.",
        "Chris: Let me go talk to Tom.",
        "Alison: You can't leave me.",
        "Chris: Alison, I am going to make sure nothing happens to you. I promise. You just gotta trust me.",

        "Molly: I'm ready to go. Are you?",
        "Dusty: No. You know, you get all dolled up for your ex-boyfriend tonight. And you see him with this hot little blonde, and all of a sudden, you decide to split, which is fine with me. But don't expect me to follow you around like I'm some kind of lapdog.",
        "Molly: Don't bother, Fido.",
        "Dusty: Fido?",
        "Rose: What was that about?",
        "Dusty: You know, she's just hung up on her ex-boyfriend. She's an unhappy woman.",
        "Rose: That's Molly.",
        "Dusty: Look at you. What happened? You're sitting next to an empty chair. What happened to Paul?",
        "Rose: Well, Paul is playing junior detective, looking for hints about where his mom is. I'd better go find him. Look, if you find him first, can you --",
        "Dusty: Keep him busy, yeah.",
        "Rose: Yeah, thank you.",
        "Mike: Some wedding, huh? How're you holding up?",
        "Carly: Good. Great. I made a decision today. I'm gonna move out of Emma's.",

        "Carly: I have a couple of options. I'm back on top again at Monte Carlo. I've got a big, fat check from Rosanna burning a hole in my purse. I think I'll get a suite at the Lakeview until I find the perfect house for my little family.",
        "Mike: Come on, you don't want to live in the Lakeview, live out of a suitcase. Come on, it's just a few months. Stay with me.",
        "Carly: No. Mike -- if this baby is yours, you will have plenty of time to play daddy. But until I know anything for sure, I really need some space. From you and from Jack. From everybody but my babies.",

        "Aaron: You were so beautiful walking down that aisle, I couldn't believe it.",
        "Lucy: Neither could my father. Did you see the look on his face? I can't wait to tell him how much you helped me. He'll probably come over and thank you personally.",
        "Aaron: I hope you're right.",
        "Lucy: I'll prove I am. I'm gonna go talk to him right now.",
        "Aaron: No, no, no, Luce, maybe we ought to wait just a little.",
        "Lucy: I'm tired of waiting, Aaron. Aren't you? I want us to dance together right here, in front of everyone.",
        "Aaron: I do, too, more than ever.",
        "Lucy: Okay, then, you just stay here. I'm gonna go talk to him. Then we'll be together, okay?",
        "Lucy: Daddy?",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, Lucy. Oh, Lucy, you look so beautiful tonight. So beautiful.",
        "Craig: And seeing you walk down the aisle was -- it meant the world.",
        "Rosanna: She worked very hard to surprise you.",
        "Craig: Yeah?",
        "Lucy: And I couldn't have done it alone.",
        "Tom: Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure as best man to introduce to you Mr. and Mrs. Craig Montgomery. [Applause] It is time for them to hit the dance floor for their first dance as husband and wife.",
        "Craig: It would be my pleasure.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, but what about Lucy?",
        "Craig: The first dance always belongs to the bride. Shall we, Mrs. Montgomery?",

        "Rose: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hey.",

        "Paul: Montgomery's phone.",
        "Rose: What's that gonna tell you?",
        "Paul: Maybe he's been in contact with the people who are keeping my mother hidden. Hal. Montgomery's phone.",
        "Hal: Turn it off and put it down, Paul. Leave it to the cops.",
        "Paul: Hal, are you serious? Are you serious? Playing by the rules, all that's gonna do is cost us valuable time and maybe my mother's life. How long are we gonna wait? Until she's gone months? Months, like Rose was?",
        "Hal: I'm taking this back to Craig. Keep investigating and I'm gonna run you in.",
        "Paul: Hal --",
        "Hal: Do you get me?",
        "Rose: You know, maybe Hal's right.",
        "Paul: You know what? I'm getting the feeling that you don't want my mother found.",
        "Rose: Of course I do. But I don't want you to be arrested, either.",
        "Paul: You know, I know my mother is far from perfect, and you and I both have every reason to distrust her, but she is my mother.",
        "Rose: And I -- as much as I love you, I am never gonna forgive that woman for what she did to me. Or Carly. Or Emily. What was she doing when I was being used like a guinea pig with that mad scientist? Going around town, trying to get everybody to feel sorry for her. Did her life stop? Did she shed a tear for me? Was she worried about you? What it was gonna do to you? No. So you know what? I can't worry about her. And my gut's telling me that she's gonna be back. I know it. I know she's gonna come home. All right?",
        "Paul: I wish I could be as sure of that as you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Judge: The court finds it would be impossible for any jury to ignore the inflammatory remarks of Dr. Harris. I find Dr. Harris in contempt of court. And unfortunately, I have no choice but to declare a mistrial. This court is adjourned.",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Evelyn: Do you want to pursue this?",
        "Jessica: No, I don't think so. I had my day in court. That was enough for me.",
        "Evelyn: Jessica, are you absolutely sure?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, I'm sure. Thanks for your help, Evelyn.",
        "Evelyn: Well, best of luck.",
        "Bonnie: So Marshall's not gonna go to jail? He's not gonna be held accountable for what he did to you? Mom, you can't let that happen!",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, what I can't do is put all of us through this hell again. No, I can't.",

        "Regina: When are you gonna learn, Nicole? Do I have to add another two months to your sentence?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, but none of that was my fault. Why you always gotta be up in my business, Ms. Corrado?",
        "Regina: Get used to it. We're gonna have plenty of time together.",
        "Nicole: I'm gonna love watching you bleed, Ms. Corrado.",

        "Ben: I never thought that by telling the truth, I'd get your case thrown out of court. That's not why I said what I said.",
        "Jessica: It's all right.",
        "Ben: No, it's not. But I didn't want to be the one to hurt you. I don't want to be that person anymore. Those people had to hear the truth, Jessica, and I couldn't tell them anything less. I'm sorry.",
        "Jessica: Listen -- you don't have to apologize for anything. You gave me back something I thought Marshall had taken. Something I thought I'd never have again. You gave me honor, dignity and love. And for that, I'll never be able to thank you enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: A man like Ben Harris has to go to jail, and a reptile like you gets to go home. Where is the justice, Marshall? You get to keep manipulating the law, breaking rules, raping women.",
        "Marshall: I wasn't found guilty of anything.",
        "Bonnie: Not by a court of law, you weren't. But we all know what you've done here, Marshall. You know it. I know it. Ben knows it, and my mother will never forget it. So I find you guilty. And trust me -- I'll make sure you pay for what you've done.",
