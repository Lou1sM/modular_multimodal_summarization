        "Keith: I have a chance to nail Julia's killer, but I'm gonna need your help to get the proof.",
        "Lily: What do you want me to do?",
        "Luke: Nothing. Why can't the cops handle it?",
        "Keith: Well, that's a delicate situation, and, you know, I mean, they're doing their best, but --",
        "Luke: But you want my mom to do it instead. Why? What is it, illegal?",
        "Lily: Could you let me handle this, please?",
        "Luke: Mom, you just got back. Okay? My little sisters just got their mom back, okay?",
        "Keith: You're right. You know what? I'm sorry I bothered you.",
        "Lily: Wait, wait, wait. Just tell me what you need.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't understand all that legal stuff. You know, maybe you should call the lawyer and talk to him yourself. The bottom line is that Les could get custody of J.J. at any moment. Yes, of course I will. All right. So, you're sure that you'll be home tomorrow, then? Me, too. I just hope you find whatever you need to, to put Les away for good. All right. Well, call me when you land. I love you, too. J.J.? J.J., you want to play that game now? Hey, J.J.? J.J.? J. -- J.J.!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Bubbles, this consult here, it's not -- we -- we talked about kids in passing, but --",
        "Katie: No. I am walking out of here with birth control. Not a thermometer and a mission. You can exhale now.",
        "Henry: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Deciding when and if we want to have kids is huge. You think that I would do that without you?",
        "Henry: I guess not.",
        "Katie: No. That's why I'm here. I am not letting us get taken by surprise like -- sometimes happens.",
        "Henry: Like Jennifer, who we don't even know if she is pregnant, and we will wait to hear from herself, if she chooses to tell us anything. Right? Right?",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Katie: Unless fate drops the answers in our laps.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Congratulations?",
        "Craig: Yeah. I heard the good news. You're still pregnant, aren't you?",
        "Jennifer: Yes.",
        "Craig: Well.",
        "Jennifer: Yes I am.",
        "Craig: Well, then I wish you all the very best. You and Mike both. You must be thrilled with the news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Whoa, whoa, don't come inside my house. You have a lot of nerve showing up here with your \"congratulations.\"",
        "Craig: What is this hostility about, business? At a time like this?",
        "Jennifer: You stole my company out from under me, and destroyed what little I had left. That's not business!",
        "Craig: Yes, it was. Now, Jennifer, I can understand how everything must feel personal at a time like this, what with all the raging hormones and whatnot.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no, no. Don't -- don't even. My hormones are not raging, but I am, and you deserve it!",
        "Craig: I wish I had known.",
        "Jennifer: Why? Would you do things differently? Would you -- would you save some samples just for old times' sake, and not take all of my customers?",
        "Mike: You've done enough. It's time for you to leave.",
        "Jennifer: You are a poor excuse for a human being. I don't know how I ever let you near me!",
        "Mike: Jen. Don't. Get off my porch.",
        "Craig: You know, I get the sense Jennifer has something to tell me.",
        "Mike: Well, I'm not gonna tell you again.",
        "Craig: Well, she doesn't look well. Do you want to sit down or something? You've got to take of yourself, Jennifer, for the baby's sake.",
        "Mike: You know what? I don't see how this is any of your business, anyway.",
        "Craig: Jennifer, maybe you should answer that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Tell me that isn't fate.",
        "Henry: It's confidential information.",
        "Katie: It's the Trifecta.",
        "Henry: Katie.",
        "Henry: Katie.",
        "Katie: Don't nag.",
        "Henry: I'm not. Nurse at nine o'clock. Well?",
        "Katie: I thought you didn't want to know.",
        "Henry: Well, I didn't, until you knew.",
        "Katie: Jennifer's file is in there. She's been to see Dr. Schiller recently. I think she's pregnant.",
        "Henry: Or she needed birth control.",
        "Katie: She went to the family planning center, Henry.",
        "Henry: So?",
        "Katie: So, why would she go to both? I mean, if she was just having a check-up or getting birth control pills, then she would just come here. But she didn't. She came here, and then she went to the family planning center.",
        "Henry: She said she was meeting a friend at the clinic.",
        "Katie: No. She went there to get something that she couldn't get here.",
        "Henry: Or she was meeting a friend.",
        "Katie: Well, why do we even have to wonder? The answer's right there.",
        "Henry: Why? Wait a second, why -- whatever happened to letting this just be mike and Jennifer's business?",
        "Katie: Fate happened, about five files from the top. Don't you always say that information is power?",
        "Henry: No, no, no. I said that information is the power to blackmail. Now, can you foresee any scenario in which either you or I will blackmail either Mike or Jennifer?",
        "Katie: Not off the top of my head.",
        "Henry: Okay, then let it go. All right? You go into that file now, you're nothing but a snoop.",
        "Katie: I suppose.",
        "Henry: Why are you so caught up in this?",
        "Katie: I don't know. I guess I'm just trying to be a friend to Jennifer. And I thought that's where we were headed, especially after she told Mike that she slept with Craig. Let's face it, Henry. She could use a friend right now.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Well, know what? Going through her private medical file is not a way to win her trust.",
        "Katie: I know. I guess I just keep thinking how hard it must be to be in her shoes and making these decisions. Do you have the baby? Is this the right time? Is the father okay with it?",
        "Henry: Oh, well, you know Mike. He's a prince.",
        "Katie: If --",
        "Henry: No ifs. He's a prince.",
        "Katie: Henry, you forget that we already talked about the unfortunate possibility that this baby might be Craig's.",
        "Henry: How could you wish that man a father on anyone? Katie?",
        "Katie: You know, not long ago, people could have talked about me like that. Or about you. And they probably did. And we probably deserved it.",
        "Henry: We -- no. We were never that bad, and you know it.",
        "Katie: Well, we could've been, if we didn't have somebody on our side. But we did. Sometimes it was Margo. Or sometimes it was you for me. And it was me for you. We had somebody to help us feel good. Somebody that gives us a chance.",
        "Henry: Craig is not some stray puppy that you have to protect. He has been given more second chances and more comebacks than Donald Trump. And Katie, this is not about Craig. All right? You're not fooling me for a minute.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Henry: You are not doing this because you want to be Jennifer's buddy. And this is not so you can be a good little sister to Craig. This is about mike.",
        "Katie: This is so not about -- yeah. This is about Mike.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I know. You're right. I just got home. But I think we owe it to Julia to find her real killer.",
        "Luke: Oh, Mom, don't.",
        "Lily: Okay. All right. Then we owe it to Keith. I would still be in jail if it weren't for him.",
        "Luke: He helped put you in jail with that fake evidence.",
        "Lily: And he could've left me there. Luke, I really believe all he wants is justice for his sister. I didn't believe that at first, but now I know that that's true.",
        "Luke: Yeah, he was pretty straight with me.",
        "Lily: So let's hear him out.",
        "Luke: As long as it's legal.",
        "Lily: Of course. Come on.",
        "Luke: Look, I'm sorry for jumping on you before. It's just, you know, we just got our mom back. And we don't want to lose that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Right. That's great you get a second chance with your mother. It's too bad that J.J. will never get that chance.",
        "Carly: What were you thinking? That is such a busy road out there!",
        "J.J.: I know.",
        "Carly: You know? Then what were you doing? All right. I'm sorry. I know that I sound mad. And I'm not mad. It's just that you scared me. Let me start again, all right? What's up, J.J.? What -- what were you doing? Are you bored playing inside? Then what were you doing?",
        "J.J.: I wanted somebody to give me a ride.",
        "Carly: You were hitchhiking? Do you have any idea how dangerous that is, honey? What, that's it? Come on. Tell me.",
        "J.J.: I heard you on the phone. You said Les could get me.",
        "Carly: And you wanted to run away? Oh, kid -- I'd be scared, too.",
        "J.J.: You can come with me.",
        "Carly: No, sweetie, we don't have to run away. You know why? Jack and your Uncle Keith are not gonna let Les take you away. Now, I know what you heard. And it's true that Les is trying to get another judge to help him. But that won't matter. They will stop him.",
        "J.J.: No, they won't. Les will stop them. He told me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Celia: Hey. Where's your bathroom?",
        "Casey: That way.",
        "Celia: Are your grandparents here?",
        "Casey: Not yet.",
        "Celia: Good, I can fix my hair.",
        "Casey: You look great.",
        "Celia: You're just saying that because I'm nervous.",
        "Casey: It's still true. And you don't have to be scared of my family.",
        "Celia: Your grandfather runs the biggest hospital in town. Your grandmother runs a television station. Your father is the D.A. Your mother is a detective. Doesn't anybody work in the mall or something?",
        "Casey: I will. I'll do whatever you want, if it makes you feel better.",
        "Celia: I wouldn't want that.",
        "Casey: What do you want?",
        "Celia: Your parents --",
        "Casey: They went to get supplies.",
        "Celia: Then I have time to get fixed up.",
        "Casey: You're not even messed up.",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Matt: At ease. Just me.",
        "Casey: Matt, this is Celia. Celia, Matt.",
        "Celia: Hey. I'll be right back.",
        "Matt: She is so fine I am speechless. Yeah, like you're interested in her razor sharp mind and her beautiful spirit.",
        "Casey: Are you here for the Chem notes?",
        "Matt: Yeah. I missed the lab, too. So what's the deal? You two hooking up?",
        "Casey: The test is Wednesday, man. Don't blow it. The team needs you.",
        "Matt: Ah, ducks the question like a total wimp.",
        "Casey: Or a total gentleman.",
        "Matt: Whatever. You're not prepared at all. I see it in your face. That girl is ready. She's hot and she wants you.",
        "Casey: See you later, Matt.",
        "Matt: Thanks for your help. Let me return the favor.",
        "Celia: Hey. Should we do something to help before your mom and dad get here? Casey?",
        "Casey: No, I --",
        "Celia: Think I'll pass inspection?",
        "Casey: Yeah, definitely.",
        "Celia: So anything we should do to help?",
        "Casey: No, everything's set up. Want to watch TV?",
        "Celia: Sure. TV's good.",
        "Casey: I lost the remote.",
        "Celia: We don't have to change channels.",
        "Casey: We don't have to turn it on at all.",
        "Celia: No, we don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Wait, wait. You can't be sure that Les is the one who called Julia's cell phone.",
        "Keith: That phone booth is right around the corner from the halfway house.",
        "Lily: But I thought everybody was locked in after seven o'clock? Didn't Jack talk to the guy?",
        "Keith: Well, he probably slipped out after lockdown, you know? I mean, I've got to get in and search his room.",
        "Lily: Then have the police get a search warrant to do it.",
        "Keith: Well, Jack's out of town right now and -- and I can't really rely on the cops. Not to mention the fact that I just got a call from my attorney. Sweeney is very close to getting custody of J.J. If that happens, he's going to grab J.J. and he'll be gone and none of us will ever see him again.",
        "Lily: So what do you want me to do?",
        "Keith: Well -- I'm a bit of a hothead when it comes to Sweeney. So I need someone who's got a little finesse. That's -- that's where you fit in here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Listen to me, J.J. Jack and Uncle Keith are going to be fine. Les can't hurt them. I know that he's hurt you. And that he hurt your mom. But he can't hurt big, tough guys like Jack and Uncle Keith. They are going to keep Les away from you. I am, too.",
        "J.J.: You're not very big.",
        "Carly: No, that's true. But I'm mean. I am mean as a snake when I want to be. And you know that's true, don't you? You want to say \"yes\" don't you? Don't you? [Carly laughs] and here's where it's good to be mean. Because I don't let anybody mess with my family. What?",
        "J.J.: I'm not your family.",
        "Carly: Oh, yes, you are. You are Jack's son. And that makes you my family just as much as Parker and Sage are my family. Do you know how to make a pinky promise? Pinky. You swear to keep a promise. And it's like a chain. It even looks like a chain, see? And so, J.J. Larrabee, I promise you that you will always be a member of this family. And nobody can ever take that away from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Yeah, can I help you?",
        "Les: Yeah, I'm looking for Jack Snyder.",
        "Hal: Jack's out of town until tomorrow, at the latest.",
        "Les: Well good. Good. That'll make this easier.",
        "Hal: What'll make it easier, Sweeney?",
        "Les: You know me?",
        "Hal: Oh, yeah, I know you. I've got your rap sheet memorized.",
        "Les: Yeah. Well, you need to get a life, man. That's okay. We'll be long gone by tomorrow. But, you tell Jack when you see him -- tell him I won.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Me wanting to know about Jennifer's baby is about Mike. But not in the way that you think.",
        "Henry: How's that?",
        "Katie: It's not like I want him to get rid of Jennifer so I can have him. I just don't want him to be played for a fool. Again.",
        "Henry: And it's -- and it's your job to make sure it doesn't happen again.",
        "Katie: Yes. As Mike's friend. Henry, it's not just me. This is a pattern with him. Women don't treat him very well. [Henry scoffs] and he's been through this baby thing before. Remember Carly? For months he hung out, hoping and praying that Sage was his. And I was there for that, Henry. I saw how bad it hurt him. I saw what he went through.",
        "Henry: No one lied to him, though. He knew what was going on. And Jennifer, I'm sure, has been honest with him too.",
        "Katie: Let's hope.",
        "Henry: She has given you no reason to think otherwise.",
        "Katie: Yet. What if Jennifer has the baby and let's Mike think it's his when it really is Craig's?",
        "Henry: Oh, come on! Come on. She is incapable of living with that kind of lie.",
        "Katie: You don't know that.",
        "Henry: If she is capable of telling him that she slept with Craig, she is certainly capable of telling him about a baby. All right? Let it go! Don't any of these periodicals have a sports section in them?",
        "Katie: I guess this means \"subject closed.\"",
        "Henry: I just -- I need to see who's at the track today.",
        "Katie: So you think Mike and Jennifer can figure this out on their own?",
        "Henry: I do.",
        "Katie: Did we just have a fight? 'Cause this is too weird. You're mad at me.",
        "Henry: Kat -- I love you. Bubbles. And I want -- you know what? I want to think about you. I want to think about us. And I don't understand why you have this uncontrollable urge to get all mixed up in the business of Mike and Jennifer.",
        "Katie: I told you --",
        "Henry: No. I know, you told me. And there's not a single fact in there that I can believe. So I wonder. Craig is a grown man. He can take care of himself. Besides which, we still don't know if Jennifer is pregnant, let alone if there is a problem. Would you get a hobby, sweetheart?",
        "Katie: You already have martinis and gambling. What's left? Online trading?",
        "Henry: Well, that could be dangerous.",
        "Katie: Knitting?",
        "Henry: Knitting? That's better. If you -- if you ever knit any kind of, like, woodland creatures, cute little things, I'm out the door.",
        "Katie: Deal. Domestic pets only.",
        "Henry: Come here.",
        "Katie: Fighting with you bites. Let's not do it again.",
        "Henry: Totally bites.",
        "Katie: Totally.",
        "Henry: We can start making up, right here, right now. What do you say? [Phone rings] ah. Henry Coleman. Yeah. Ah, sure, I can be there in 20 minutes. Okay. That's the dispatcher for the limousine service.",
        "Katie: Go ahead. I'm fine.",
        "Henry: You're sure?",
        "Katie: Uh-hmm. I'll meet you at the gym later, okay?",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Katie: No. Henry's right -- it is Jennifer and Mike's business.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Of course, it's different for every one, but don't be surprised if your morning sickness doesn't last until well into the afternoon. With Bryant, Sierra was queasy until dinnertime, but that went away after the first trimester. With Lucy, of course, she was only sick in the morning. But that went on much, much longer.",
        "Mike: Jen?",
        "Jennifer: No, it's okay.",
        "Mike: No, it's not okay. You are worse than her mother.",
        "Craig: Yes, funny you should say that. I saw her this morning.",
        "Jennifer: Is that how you found out I was pregnant? She told you?",
        "Craig: I overheard some things. Some things I didn't expect, actually.",
        "Jennifer: Like what?",
        "Craig: Like she had to convince you to keep the baby. Why is that?",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Craig: I thought you and Mike were so in love. So why would --",
        "Mike: I don't see how this is any of your business.",
        "Craig: I don't hear Jennifer telling me.",
        "Jennifer: Leave me alone, Craig.",
        "Mike: There you have it.",
        "Craig: No, I don't know. I don't know. I could come back another time, but I'm not going away.",
        "Mike: Why not? We both want you gone.",
        "Craig: I think you know why, Mike.",
        "Mike: You want me to hit you again, is that what you want? Because we could go outside and do that. That way I'll never have to see you again.",
        "Craig: No, I think I'm entitled to some answers, given the situation.",
        "Mike: Here's the situation. Jennifer and I are having a baby. She's going to be a mother and I'm going to be a father. And we're very happy about it. End of story.",

        "Mike: Why wouldn't we be?",
        "Craig: Oh, I'm just wondering where Barbara got the idea you didn't want the child.",
        "Mike: Once again, none of your business.",
        "Craig: Is it true?",
        "Mike: You know what? Give it up, man. I don't even know how she ever worked with you, much less --",
        "Craig: Much less everything else?",
        "Mike: Okay, see that door? It's right behind you.",
        "Craig: Yes, I know. Now, Jennifer, if you ever did consider giving up this child, please don't without giving it --",
        "Jennifer: Oh, God!",
        "Mike: Okay, man, you are not going to come in to my house and talk to her like that.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, stop, stop!",
        "Mike: You're not going to do it.",

        "Margo: Hey! What were you doing lurking in our driveway?",
        "Kim: I don't know. I rang the front bell.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, I guess nobody inside could hear that bell.",
        "Tom: Oh, well, that bell's been broken for more than a week and you knew that.",

        "Les: Oh! Now it's Les?",
        "Hal: Maybe it might be wise for you to just wait until Jack gets back.",
        "Les: Well, why, man? You saw the papers. Now, come on now. There ain't nothing you or Jack can do to change that. Now if you want to send one of your boys with me to make sure I get my rights, that'd be fine by me.",
        "Hal: Sorry. Don't have any officers available.",
        "Les: You don't have -- can't do it or you won't do it? Yeah, that's what I figured. That's okay. I don't need cops. I have a judge.",
        "Hal: Sarah? I want you to get a hold of the control tower. Find out if Jack's plane has taken off. If it hasn't, I want you to get him off that plane right now.",

        "Keith: Oh, you're surprised, huh?",
        "Mr. Simms: Who are you again?",

        "Mr. Simms: I got stories.",

        "J.J.: I never get settled.",
        "Carly: Of course, you will. All this moving around, it's gonna stop. And then you can join the Cub Scouts and you can join a baseball team, and you can do all the things that all the other kids do. And when you're bored, you can come and visit us here. Because we want you to visit as often as you can. We all do. Ha! Look at that. I won. What? High five. C'mon, I won. Low five. What is it?",
        "J.J.: Mom did that whenever she won a game.",
        "Carly: Oh. You still dream about her every night? Yeah. Well, that's because she's looking out for you. She wants you to be safe, even though things are tough right now. And she knows that everybody who loves you is going to keep you safe, J.J. and that includes me. If you want.",
