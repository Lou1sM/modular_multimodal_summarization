Jack and Carly disagree over how to handle things, as Carly decides she is getting on with her life \u0096 starting with Metro. Katie and Brad leave a minister waiting at Margo's, as she tries to make excuses. Katie wants Mike to leave her alone while he pleads with her not to marry Brad until they work through what is still between them. Katie falls in the lake trying to get away from him. Brad shows up to see the minister and is worried when Katie isn't there. Carly focuses on cleaning up Metro, as Jack gets called to the station and is forced to leave the kids alone because Carly isn't home on time. Mike follows Katie to her room and lets himself in \u0096 thanks to Lisa \u0096 and plants a kiss on her, who is less then thrilled. Katie tells Mike that it took her a long time to move on and be with Brad and she is not going to give that up because he thinks there is still something between them, as she kicks him out. The priest finally leaves and Margo once again voices her concern to Brad. Carly is irate when she finds Jack not at home and goes looking to confront him. Jack thinks she is picking a fight because he won't sleep with her anymore, as Carly answers that charge with a slap to his face. Katie shows up at Margo's flustered claiming she lost track of time and after Brad leaves, Margo calls her on it. Katie casually mentions Mike showing up again and Margo takes this opportunity to tell Katie that she needs to deal with all her unfinished business first before she gets married. There are too many men in her life with unfinished business. Margo can't support her until she does. JJ, Parker and Sage talk about how Carly and Jack are not getting back together, as Sage sobs at the reality. Mike tells Lisa that his showing up at Katie's did not go over well, as Lisa urges him not to give up. Margo is upset with Jack for him having left Katie to begin with and starting the ball rolling. Katie learns from Kim about Brad's idea and Kim and Brad are both surprised when Katie is all for it. Brad is confused to learn Margo is no longer involved in the wedding, as Katie won't allude as to what the whole story is. Katie tells Brad that everything will be fine just as soon as they are married; however, her face says something different. Carly finds a sobbing Sage and promises her that they are still and family and that she will always be there for her no matter what."

        "Jack: You're running late?",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Jack: Where's J.J. and Sage?",
        "Parker: They left for school early. I've got a free period. What's going on?",
        "Jack: What does it look like?",
        "Parker: You slept on the couch?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Did have you breakfast?",
        "Parker: I thought you and Mom were getting back together. Why are you sleeping down here again?",
        "Jack: Parker, do you need a ride to school?",
        "Parker: Why won't you tell me the truth?",
        "Jack: Because you're a kid. It's none of your business.",
        "Carly: Parker asked you a question. I think he deserves an answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Kim's waiting for these DVDs. Okay, we've got to hit WOAK, then we got to go by your sister's. We've got to meet with the minister, talk about the ceremony.",
        "Katie: Mmm.",
        "Brad: Get up, Peretti. If we're late, Margo will get on our case.",
        "Katie: I could just stay in bed all day. Couldn't you just stay in bed all day?",
        "Brad: Don't tempt me. You make groggy look good. But come on -- we've got to get going.",
        "Katie: \"We?\" What part of the ceremony are you planning?",
        "Brad: Well, I'm assuming you want me to stay away from the flowers. So, I was going to take care of the cake.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Katie: But keep it simple. No crazy designs.",
        "Brad: Oh, I had a great idea. How about like an exact replicas of us, with the \"Oakdale Now\" logo --",
        "Katie: That would be hot.",
        "Brad: On top -- wouldn't that be good.",
        "Katie: No, you know what you have to do? Call the place on Main Street. They made a cake for me and Henry that was amazing.",
        "Brad: I think I'll find someone else.",
        "Katie: Why? It was so good.",
        "Brad: For you and Henry. This is about you and me. So, let's leave ex-husbands and former ceremonies in the past, shall we?",
        "Katie: You've got a good point. I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: I do. I know.",
        "Katie: Why is everything so complicated?",
        "Brad: It's only complicated if we let it be. I can make your bride-to-be jitters go away, you know.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. I know you can. No, you're right, you're right. We've got to get on it.",
        "Brad: I'll tell you what. Why don't you take your time? Have a long, nice hot bath. Pamper yourself a little bit. I'll drop the stuff off at Kim's, and then meet me at Margo's.",
        "Katie: You take such good care of me.",
        "Brad: Better get used to it. I'm going to be doing it for the rest of our lives.",

        "Jack: Let's not do this in front of him, please.",
        "Parker: Look, something happened, just tell me.",
        "Carly: Your dad and I tried to work things out, but we have a different idea about what that means.",
        "Parker: So, you guys are splitting up again?",
        "Carly: Apparently, we were never together.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, Carly. He doesn't need to hear this.",
        "Parker: Why not? It's not like I haven't been through this before.",
        "Jack: These problems are between your mother and me.",
        "Parker: You guys stayed in the same room the other night. J.J. knows it, Sage knows it. We all talked about it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, we're not going to talk about it now. You've got to go to school.",
        "Parker: Well, when I come home, where do I go, here or the farm?",
        "Carly: Here. This is your home.",
        "Parker: What happened to trying to be a family again?",
        "Carly: Jack will always be your father. He just doesn't want to be my husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Brad makes kissing noises]",
        "Kim: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop it. Go away. You're a happy camper today.",
        "Brad: Of course, I'm happy. I'm marrying the most beautiful woman in the world.",
        "Kim: I'm glad it worked out for the two of you. Congratulations.",
        "Brad: Take some credit, for crying out loud. You had the vision. You put us together. It was stroke of genius.",
        "Kim: It was meant to be.",
        "Brad: What's wrong?",
        "Kim: The affiliates meeting was a bummer today. And the numbers are down.",
        "Brad: The ratings for the show? They're down? How far down?",
        "Kim: Let's just say that the advertisers are grumbling. And I'm under serious pressure to come up with something that will give us a great big kick in the seat of the pants. Something big.",
        "Brad: Like an on-air wedding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Mike: Hello?",
        "Katie: Mike. It's Katie.",
        "Mike: Hi, Katie. Did you get my gift?",
        "Katie: I did. We need to talk about it.",
        "Mike: Okay, well, I'm at Emma's right now and I'm about to head down to the pond, but I can meet you later for lunch or something.",
        "Katie: No, I need to do this right now. I'll will meet you at the farm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We are not discussing this in front of Parker.",
        "Carly: You don't get to decide that. When I said I was going to be honest from now on, I meant it. And that includes my children. Your father can't get over some of the things I've done.",
        "Parker: Why not?",
        "Carly: I made some very bad choices. I wish I could change that, but I can't. And Jack wishes that he could forget that, but he can't.",
        "Parker: But you guys were together the whole time that I was in trouble.",
        "Jack: Yes. We were supporting each other through a very difficult time. You needed us and we were doing what we thought was the best thing to get us through it together.",
        "Parker: But the other night -- I don't get it.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Parker: That wasn't the only time that you guys have stayed together in the same room. Doesn't that mean something?",
        "Jack: Your mother will always mean something to me.",
        "Parker: But you just can't forgive her?",
        "Jack: It's not that.",
        "Parker: Than what is it?",
        "Carly: Parker, Dad has tried to make it work, but you can't make somebody feel something they don't. And that's just the way it is, and there's nothing I can do to change it.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, I think this bites.",
        "Jack: Well, I think that was a case of too much information.",
        "Carly: I'm not going to lie to him, Jack. And I'm not going to lie to myself. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Well, good morning.",
        "Minister: Good morning.",
        "Margo: Please come in. Thank you for coming on such short notice. And boy, on time, too. Please, have a seat and I'll pour you come coffee and then we can get acquainted, huh?",
        "Minister: Thank you. I'm anxious to meet the happy couple.",
        "Margo: Oh, they're anxious to meet you as well.",
        "Minister: When I heard they wanted to get married right away, I rearranged my schedule to accommodate them.",
        "Margo: Did you, did you? I'm sure that they'll appreciate that. We all will. Donut?",
        "Minister: Oh no thank you. Where will the couple be exchanging vows?",
        "Margo: Well, I think maybe outside on our patio, weather permitting. Because Katie has always wanted an outdoor wedding.",
        "Minister: Lovely. And where are the bride and groom?",
        "[Margo chuckles]",
        "Margo: I have no idea. But I'm sure they'll be here soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I can't accept this.",
        "Mike: What's the problem?",
        "Katie: I'm not your angel anymore.",
        "Mike: My note offended you?",
        "Katie: It's a little inappropriate, considering the circumstances.",
        "Mike: Okay, fine. Throw it away. Forget I ever wrote it. But at least keep the gift.",
        "Katie: You're not hearing me. I don't want a wedding present from you.",
        "Mike: What is the big deal?",
        "Katie: Every time I see it -- forget it. Just take it back, please.",
        "Mike: Every time you see it -- what? You think of me? Katie, we've got unfinished business. And I think we'd better deal with it, don't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I don't think we should be dragging the kids into the middle of this.",
        "Carly: They're already in the middle of it, Jack. They live here. They know what's going on. They even know we slept together the other night!",
        "Jack: Yes, exactly! They've seen more than they can possibly understand, especially Parker. Now I know he's growing up really fast, Carly, but he's still a kid.",
        "Carly: I understand that.",
        "Jack: I don't think you do. I think you expect way too much out of him.",
        "Carly: Right, and we know that I have to watch those high expectations, don't I? I am not going to give those kids false hope.",
        "Jack: Have you considered breaking it to them a little more gradually? Maybe calling Dr. Seidman, getting her advice on how to deal with this the right way?",
        "Carly: Maybe you could have considered calling Dr. Seidman before you slept with me. Maybe she would have advised you to stop.",
        "Jack: I am not doing this to hurt you. Or the kids. We're still a family, and I still live here.",
        "Carly: Not for long. You'll leave. You can't forgive me for what I've done, and so you're giving up on our family.",
        "Jack: I'll never give up on my kids. We'll always be family.",
        "Carly: Oh, please -- words. Those are just words. I am so sick of 'em. I have been hiding from reality for far too long. But I have finally gotten the message, Jack. Loud and clear.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Are you out of your mind? You don't want to get married on the air.",
        "Brad: Think of the sponsorship alone.",
        "Kim: Oh, well, yeah. You've got a point there. The flowers, the food, the product placement -- ooh. Stop it, now. I'm not going to pressure you into this.",
        "Brad: No pressure. I'm a happy man, I want to tell the world. Look, I've already built a video montage of me and Katie falling in love. I mean, we can air that segment during the show.",
        "Kim: All right, you've got to listen to me. This is going to be a very special day for you. You don't want to exploit it.",
        "Brad: Kim, you're offering us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I mean, don't we owe something to our fans? We do, don't we? We owe it to them, we owe it to you. We owe it to WOAK.",
        "Kim: Oh, Katie's never going to go for this.",
        "Brad: When she hears that you need us, she will. She'll go for it.",
        "Kim: Oh, it would be so wonderful. But I am not going to do anything about this until you talk to Katie and you find out how she feels.",
        "Brad: I already know how she feels. She loves this show. We both do. We love that it brought us together. I mean, Kim, I guarantee you -- she wouldn't want to see it canceled anymore than I would.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Just because I'm returning a gift does not mean we have unfinished business. You're confusing my feelings of the past with my feelings right now.",
        "Mike: And right now you don't want any reminders of me hanging around.",
        "Katie: I don't want any reminders that I screwed everything up!",
        "Mike: So, this is our chance to fix it.",
        "Katie: There's nothing to fix, Mike. It's over. I'm in love with someone else. And I'm really, really happy.",
        "Mike: So, why don't you look happy?",
        "Katie: Maybe because I'm getting married tomorrow, and I don't have time to be sitting here arguing with you.",
        "Mike: Katie, I gave you that angel to remind you of what we meant to each other.",
        "Katie: All it reminded of is that you walked away from me. Brad would never do that. No matter how bad the mistake I made, he would forgive me.",
        "Mike: You weren't thinking about Brad when you came here today. And why did you come here, anyway? You could've mailed it to me. But you didn't. You showed up. Face to face. Why do you think that was?",
        "Katie: Stop reading things into this, Mike. I came here face-to-face for one reason. To make it clear that from now on, you can keep your gifts and your reminders and your advice to yourself!",
        "[Katie screams]",
        "[Mike laughs]",
        "Mike: Are you all right?",
        "Katie: I'm fine.",
        "Mike: You don't look fine.",
        "Katie: Stop it! This is all your fault. I hate you.",
        "Mike: Now you have to let me make my pitch.",
        "Katie: Please don't. Mike, really, whatever it is, I just don't want to hear it.",
        "Mike: I don't care. Katie, it's my turn to talk and you're going to listen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So, how are we going to make this work?",
        "Carly: The first thing I'm going to do is get back to work. I'm going to reopen Metro. It's time I made some money off of that place.",
        "Jack: Sell it.",
        "Carly: Not in this market.",
        "Jack: I really don't think it's a good idea to open that place again. It's got a bad mojo.",
        "Carly: I don't want your advice. I want your cooperation. And the first thing you can do is help me figure out a schedule so we can both look after our children and get on with our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I don't know about this, Brad. Going so public with your lives. That can be hard on a relationship. And listen. You and Katie have had enough ups and downs to last a lifetime.",
        "Brad: And it has made great TV.",
        "Kim: Yeah. Well, maybe, but just remember how Katie was so unhappy when you announced your engagement on the air. Think about that one.",
        "Brad: Let me give it one more try.",
        "Kim: You don't have a chance.",
        "Brad: You know what? Katie is full of surprises, Kim.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I know I hurt you. I was in shock, I didn't know what else to do, Katie. So I left.",
        "Katie: And then you sent me divorce papers in the mail.",
        "Mike: It was my way of hitting back. I never should have done that.",
        "Katie: But you did and it's done. And I apologized, and you apologized. So let's just leave it at that, okay? Maybe I can be your friend, but I'm not your angel anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I can watch the kids at night, while you're at Metro.",
        "Carly: All right. For now, I'm going to take advantage of your medical leave and get the club cleaned up.",
        "Jack: Well, how long you going to be? 'Cause I promised Margo I'd come to the station this afternoon.",
        "Carly: Of course. All right. Well, I will get as much done as I can, and be home sometime between 1:00 and 1:30, okay? The kids have a half-day of school, so you'll have to fix them lunch. Do you think you can manage that?",
        "Jack: Sure, Carly.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh. You know, you have never met a couple that is more determined to get married. But if you think that my sister and her fianc\u00e9, you know, are acting a bit hasty, let me tell you they're committed to this wedding.",
        "Minister: Then, you'll forgive me. I'm surprised that they aren't here yet.",
        "Margo: Yes, well, they're stuck at work. Because they are the hosts of a television show Oakdale Now, maybe you've tuned in?",
        "Minister: I'm afraid not. I'm awfully busy tending to my own flock. I haven't much time for television.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, say if you ever do stray from your flock, you should tune in. Because that is actually where Katie and Brad met and fell in love on television in front of the whole world.",
        "Minister: Well, perhaps that explains it then.",
        "Margo: Explains what then?",
        "Minister: Well, these folks in the public eye tend to get a little -- spoiled. They think that they can just keep other people waiting and no one will dare complain. Well, I'm not a fan of self-indulgent behavior. Celebrity cache or not.",
        "Margo: Say no more, say no more. Yes, I'm sure there's a perfectly good explanation. If we just -- [Knock at the door] See? What did I say? There they are right now. Couldn't be better timing. Thank God you're here. Where's Katie?",
        "Brad: Well, I have no idea. I was sure she would have been here by now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What are you doing here?",
        "Mike: Lisa gave me the key.",
        "Katie: She should not have done that. Mike, get out of here! Get out of --",
        "Katie: Stop it, stop it. What are you doing?",
        "Mike: You didn't want me to kiss you?",
        "Katie: I don't want you anywhere near me! I don't understand what's gotten into you, Mike. Time didn't just stop because you were off to Europe. I got on with my life. I managed to believe in myself again. And I found someone who loves me, even though I'm not perfect. Do you think I'm going to give all of that up just because you decide you want to come back?",
        "Mike: Katie, don't get married. Not yet.",
        "Katie: Don't you understand? You left me because I made one stupid mistake. You made me feel like a slut.",
        "Mike: Stop it. Do not say that. I never thought of you like that.",
        "Katie: It was hard for me to put my life back together again. You can't expect me just to -- for you to walk in here and I'll jump into your arms.",
        "Mike: Don't make the same mistake you made with me. If you marry Brad Snyder on the rebound, it will never work out.",
        "Katie: Oh, I am so sick of everybody thinking they know more about my life than I do. I've made it this far without you. Now you come back and you give me gifts that I didn't ask for, and you barge in here and you have the gall to put your hands on me? If you think that I'm going to leave the man I promised to marry for that, then you're still treating me like a slut!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: These donuts are really good, Margo. Wow.",
        "Margo: Yeah. They're from Al's diner.",
        "Brad: So Rev, you got any advice for the groom-to-be?",
        "Minister: I'd prefer to wait until both you and your fianc\u00e9e are present before I start to answer your questions.",
        "Brad: Yeah, Katie will be here any second. But I thought in the meantime, what's wrong with giving me a little head start? Got any tips in -- you know, in the vows department? I want to come up with something like super romantic.",
        "Minister: Little late in the game to be composing one's vows, isn't it? On the other hand, lateness seems to be the order of the day.",
        "Brad: No -- no, you don't have to worry, Man. Katie's on her way. I mean, she's had a tough time getting up this morning. Last night, we were --",
        "Margo: You know -- Katie's never been a morning person, really. Would you like some more coffee?",
        "Minister: You know what -- this is not going to work out today, I'm afraid.",
        "Brad: Now, Rev, you don't have to get all hot under the collar -- I mean, hold on a sec -- I'll just give her a call on the cell. Just wait -- wait, wait -- it's not answering. It's not even going to voicemail. That's weird.",
        "Minister: I'm sorry, I do have other appointments.",
        "Brad: No, I'm really sorry. This is not like her. She's all about being on time and making a good first impression. I'm sorry -- if you just give us just a few minutes --",
        "Minister: If you want to get married right away, then here's my advice to you. Locate your bride and then find a time when you can both meet with me. Promptly.",
        "Brad: Yes, Sir.",
        "Minister: I hate to say this, Mr. Snyder, but if you can't get your act together the day before the wedding, I'm not sure it's a good idea for the two of you to get together on anything.",
        "Margo: Oh, I couldn't have said that better if I tried.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I was angry, Katie. And I was hurt. But I never called you names. You were my wife. You were my best friend. And when I saw you yesterday -- when you were wearing that dress, you were so beautiful to me. You were my angel.",

        "Katie: It's too late, Mike. It took me a long time to get over you, but I did it.",
        "Mike: Fine, if that's the truth, then okay. I will accept it. But I don't think either of us can know the truth until we deal with this. That's all I'm asking.",
        "Katie: So, you just want to talk and just clear the air, right?",
        "Mike: No. I want more than that. I want you back.",
        "Katie: How long -- for how long? Until I screw up again? You didn't even call me. Not once. You didn't even e-mail me. We've had no contact for over a year except through lawyers. You have no right showing up and pretending to care about me.",
        "Mike: I never stopped caring about you. Katie, how could I? We were going to have a family and be together forever.",
        "Katie: Do you love me? Okay, I'm not giving up everything for a guy who can't even answer that one.",
        "Mike: Katie, there is still something between us. Please -- do not marry Brad. Not until we have a chance to deal with it.",

        "Margo: Oh, oh, all right, yes. This is my problem, because you say nothing about Mike being back. You're late to meet with the minister before your wedding. You are so upset and you lie about where you've been. But it's my problem.",
        "Katie: No, the problem is my ex-husband shows up out of nowhere and starts stalking me. But he's wrong about us and I told him that.",

        "Katie: I'm just going to have to find someone else to stand up for me. That's fine -- that's just fine. I wish my sister could see it in her heart to do that.",
