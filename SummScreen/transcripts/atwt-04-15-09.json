        "Katie and Henry talk about Vienna's pregnancy, as Katie promises to try not to obsess over Vienna's pregnancy after she overreacts after finding out she is sick with a cold. Vienna is feeling miserable and asks Brad to rub a homemade remedy for colds on her chest. He is unsure, but he then agrees to do it. Henry and Katie walk in to find Brad and Vienna doing this and neither reacts well. Brad goes after Katie, who has run off. Katie later admits to being envious of what Vienna is going through and feels she is being left out. Brad assures her that she is their baby's mother. Henry and Vienna argue over what he saw. Henry is not happy that Brad has his hands on Vienna when it is his baby, but he refuses still to step up and admit to anything. As they are arguing, Vienna falls, and Henry takes her to the hospital as a precaution. Brad and Katie learn from a WOAK cameraman that Vienna was taken to the hospital and rush over there. They are upset that Henry and Vienna didn't call them, as Henry doesn't react well and has to leave the room before he says anything else. Brad goes after them, as Henry almost spills the beans, but he then changes his mind \u0096 again. Brad and Katie can't wait until this part of the pregnancy is over so they can hold their baby in their arms and know it is theirs. Henry and Vienna continue with their charade about the baby's paternity. Luke is worried when he can't reach Noah. Zoe tries to support him in her own weird way, and offers to help look for him, as Luke finally hears from Noah. He claims that he thought they needed space so he went to Lisbon with some friends to a film festival. Luke is upset and feels he is running away. Damian tells Lily that the Grimaldi ring she found may belong to Luke. He wonders if Luke isn't more like him then Lily wants to believe, as he and Lily argue about this. She wants Damian to trust her that Luke isn't involved in framing him to get him back. No sooner though, does Luke come charging through the door at Damian, claiming he made Noah go away. He and Damian have words, as Luke is angry with his mother for not kicking Damian out and won't come back until he is gone. Damian tells Lily that he is going back to Malta to find out about the ring and then is going to Lisbon to bring Noah back. Lily discourages it thinking he will make it worse, but Damian feels he has no choice; he has to make things right with his son. Lily tells Luke that Damian has left town, as Luke worries about why Noah left. Lily doesn't think Luke should go find Noah; she believes Noah loves Luke deeply and will come back soon. Zoe shows up to see Zac at an abandoned warehouse where they have kidnapped and are holding Noah; she tells him of the details of what happened with Luke and how Damian left town. Zac is happy that their plan is going even better then they thought it would. Noah demands to know what they are planning, but Zac and Zoe won't tell him \u0096 they only allude to the fact that Luke will not be hurt, as long as he goes along with their plan."

        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Henry: Hey! Hey, there's my roomie. You just missed the morning rush. What can I get you?",
        "Katie: Oh, uh, coffee and a croissant to go, please.",
        "Henry: Okay. You off to the studio?",
        "Katie: Yes, a mountain of paperwork awaits me.",
        "Henry: Ah, the life of a TV personality. So many headshots to sign, so little time.",
        "Katie: Remember when that was all I ever wanted?",
        "Henry: Remember? You're looking at the guy who went to some incredible -- not to mention illegal -- lengths to make that happen for you.",
        "Katie: Yes you did, didn't you?",
        "Henry: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: Now all I want is to be a mom, and you're helping me with that, too.",
        "Henry: I don't know if \"Helping\" is really the right word.",
        "Katie: Yes, it is. You are the best, and you know it. Where's Vienna? In the back? I want to invite her for lunch today.",
        "Henry: Uh, no, she's not, actually. She's at home.",
        "Katie: She is? I didn't see her before I left.",
        "Henry: Well, she's feeling a little under the weather, so I let her sleep in.",
        "Katie: She's not feeling well?",
        "Henry: No, it's nothing. It's just a little cold.",
        "Katie: Vienna has a cold?",
        "Henry: Now, it's a couple of sniffles, a sneeze or two. That's it.",
        "Katie: Well, why didn't you say anything before you left? Brad and I are right down the hall. You could knock on the door and tell us she was sick.",
        "Henry: She's not sick. It's a runny nose. That's all.",
        "Katie: That is not all. Vienna is carrying our child. That is a very big deal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Vienna coughs]",
        "Brad: Oh, man, Vienna. Oh --",
        "Vienna: Oh, stop yelling. Stop yelling.",
        "Brad: What's wrong?",
        "Vienna: I'm sick. I got a cold.",
        "Brad: Oh, here, here. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Over here.",
        "[Vienna coughs]",
        "Brad: You sit down.",
        "Vienna: I thought that by sleeping late, I would fight it off, but now I feel worse than what I did two hours ago.",
        "Brad: Well, I think sleeping in only works with hangovers.",
        "Vienna: Oh.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Brad: Hold on.",
        "[Vienna coughs]",
        "Joe: Hey.",
        "Brad: Hey, Joe, what's up? What are you doing here?",
        "Joe: Kim wants us to start shooting today.",
        "Brad: Oh! The reality show.",
        "Vienna: Who's at the door?",
        "Brad: Give me a minute. Uh, it's Joe, the cameraman. I forgot, we're supposed to start shooting today",
        "Vienna: No, Brad. I can't be filming today. I look like a mess. Look, I'm sick, I'm sneezing.",
        "Brad: You're pregnant, and you're beautiful. I'll get rid of him.",
        "Vienna: I think I love you.",
        "Brad: Listen, Vienna's not feeling very well, so I think you're gonna need to come back later. Thanks, Bro. Oh, look at you.",
        "Vienna: I know.",
        "Brad: I mean, is there anything I could do to make you feel better?",
        "Vienna: Yes, there is. You can rub my chest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke, I wish you wouldn't let Damian get to you like this. I know its difficult having him around --",
        "Luke: Mom, it's not just that he's around, it's that he's everywhere. He's here, he's in Java, he's in Old Town!",
        "Lily: I know. I feel the same way you do.",
        "Luke: No, you don't. Because you don't see what he's doing to you.",
        "Lily: What is he doing?",
        "Luke: He's working you, just like he's working Noah. He wants the two of you on his side.",
        "Lily: There are no sides here, Luke. We all want the same thing. To find whoever's responsible for what's happening --",
        "Luke: Mom, we know who's responsible! It's Damian!",
        "Lily: Luke! Do you really think that he would run you down with his car or hire somebody to do it? I don't think so. And now that he knows how important this foundation is to you, I can't imagine him trying to sabotage it.",
        "Luke: Well, you know what? I'm not so sure. You know what the bigger question is? Why are you defending him?!",
        "Lily: Because I know how much he loves you.",
        "Luke: Mom, will you listen to yourself! Please! How much he loves me? He doesn't love me! He can't love someone like me. I don't deserve it.",
        "Luke: You know, I don't want to talk about Noah right now, Mom.",
        "Lily: You've got to try to work it out with Noah.",
        "Luke: You know, I would try. Maybe. If I could get a hold of him. I haven't heard from him since he left here the other night.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Luke: He won't return any of my calls, and -- I don't get it. I mean, I didn't think our fight was that big.",
        "Lily: He won't stay mad at you for long. How could he?",
        "Luke: Easily.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Lily: Maybe that's him right now.",
        "Damian: Hello, Luke.",
        "Luke: Oh, I'm so out of here.",
        "Lily: Luke!",
        "Damian: Let him go, Lily. I need to talk to you alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: Hey, Luciano!",
        "Luke: Zoe, its Luke.",
        "Zoe: Okay. Sorry.",
        "Luke: No, look, I'm sorry. It's not you, I'm just -- I'm in a mood.",
        "Zoe: I can tell. Is there anything I can supply to help take the edge off? Well, you can't blame a girl for trying.",
        "Luke: Must run in the family. I'm pretty sure your brother said the same thing to my boyfriend.",
        "Zoe: Zac's really sorry about the other night. We both are. Sometimes we just get carried away, you know? Cross the line? If it makes you feel any better, he's working on making up for the night as we speak. He's trying to track down this guy who will be able to figure out who's been messing with the foundation's accounts.",
        "Luke: You think he'll get anywhere?",
        "Zoe: Hopefully. See? He's trying to show you and Noah that his heart's in the right place. Speaking of, where's Noah?",
        "Luke: I don't know. We're not exactly on speaking terms right now.",
        "Zoe: Luke, what happened with Zac doesn't mean anything.",
        "Luke: Look, Zoe, I know that! I told Noah that. I told him that Zac was just messing with him.",
        "Zoe: And he didn't see it that way?",
        "Luke: Lately, Noah and I don't see eye-to-eye on very much.",
        "Zoe: Okay, so he's got some things to work out. He's taking some Noah-time. It happens, even with me and \"Z,\" and we're more inseparable than you two.",
        "Luke: No. Not Noah. When he gets upset about something, he likes to talk about it.",
        "Zoe: All right. So let's make him talk. First we have to find him. You're lucky I'm good at that. Let's roll.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I just got off the phone with my jeweler in Malta.",
        "Lily: Did he examine the ring?",
        "Damian: Yes.",
        "Lily: What did he say?",
        "Damian: He confirmed it was from a set he made for the Grimaldi family years ago. Lily, those rings -- they were never duplicated.",
        "Lily: Well, besides yours, who else in the family has one?",
        "Damian: Luke does.",
        "Lily: Luke?",
        "Damian: Yes, I gave it to him myself.",
        "Lily: You couldn't possibly think --",
        "Damian: No, Lily, no. I know it seems --",
        "Lily: No, no! If you're suggesting that my son put this nightmare in motion, you can just get the hell out of my house right now!",
        "Damian: I'm not accusing Luke of anything.",
        "Lily: It doesn't sound that way to me.",
        "Damian: I'm just saying this is one possibility we need to consider.",
        "Lily: You're that one that's been saying someone's targeting Luke. Now you think he just wants to make it look that way so he could get revenge on you? Luke wouldn't do that, not to you.",
        "Damian: Not to me? You mean his father? He's never thought of me that way, Lily. He sees me as an intruder, a threat to his real family.",
        "Lily: So he tries to implicate you in a series of crimes to drive you out of town?",
        "Damian: Is it really so impossible?",
        "Lily: Damian, these crimes started before we even knew you were back.",
        "Damian: What about afterwards?",
        "Lily: Oh, so he purposely sets out to destroy his foundation? He trashes this house? He stabs you?",
        "Damian: I don't know.",
        "Lily: I do. Luke is not like you, Damian.",
        "Damian: Lily, I think our son may be more like me than you're willing to admit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: Hey, hi. Is Noah working today?",
        "Barista: He's supposed to be here right now.",
        "Luke: He's late?",
        "Barista: Try a no-show. His shift started two hours ago.",
        "Luke: He didn't call in?",
        "Barista: No, we called him, but he didn't pick up. So, if you see him, tell him I'm not happy.",
        "Zoe: We'll be sure to pass that along. Thanks.",
        "Luke: This isn't good. This is so unlike Noah. He's too responsible not to call in.",
        "Zoe: Everybody plays hooky once in a while.",
        "Luke: Not Noah.",
        "Zoe: Maybe he's sick?",
        "Luke: Well, that wouldn't explain well, that wouldn't explain why he didn't answer their call or any of mine.",
        "Zoe: He could be like me and \"Z\". When we get sick, we sleep like the dead.",
        "Luke: Well, I'm trying him again. Voicemail.",
        "Zoe: Luke, I'm sure he's fine.",
        "Luke: No. No, he's not. Something is very, very off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I know if Vienna was really sick, you wouldn't leave her.",
        "Henry: Yeah, right, I wouldn't. Otherwise, she would kill me.",
        "Katie: It's just this baby changes everything.",
        "Henry: I know.",
        "Katie: And I know it probably feels like that's all any of us ever talk about or think about, but I don't want you to feel like you're not part of it.",
        "Henry: Oh, trust me. I'm a big part of this pregnancy. Huge.",
        "Katie: Yes, you are. And don't forget it. I know we joke about it all the time, but it's really true. What we're doing makes us a family.",
        "Henry: Well, I don't do that great with families.",
        "Katie: Henry, I'm serious.",
        "Henry: So am I.",
        "Katie: We need to learn how to embrace this part of the journey.",
        "Henry: Really? Embrace it how?",
        "Katie: By taking care of each other.",
        "Henry: Okay, Mama Bear. We're in a suburb, not a commune.",
        "Katie: I have an idea. What's your soup of the day?",
        "Henry: Chicken noodle. Why?",
        "Katie: I think it's about time you and I made a house call.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Vienna coughs]",
        "Brad: What is that?",
        "Vienna: This is something my mother always made when we were sick.",
        "Brad: It smells. I mean, what is it supposed to do?",
        "Vienna: This is gonna get rid of the congestion.",
        "Brad: It's about to get rid of my breakfast. Okay, look, why don't you just eat as much of that stuff as you need to, and I'm gonna be in the other room?",
        "Vienna: No, this is something you're gonna rub on my chest.",
        "Brad: [Laughing] You know what? A little warning, please. Okay? Yeah. I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Vienna: I'm gonna lay down, and you're gonna rub this on my chest.",
        "Brad: Yeah, maybe we should just wait for Henry. I mean, Henry can do it or Katie. Katie could rub it on you. I mean, you know, I think we'd all be down with that.",
        "Vienna: Brad, the sooner I can breathe, the better it is for your baby. So, why don't you just think about this as your first parental act?",
        "Brad: Okay. Fine. I'll just do that.",
        "[Clears throat]",
        "Vienna: Brad?",
        "Brad: What?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, you're going to need to look at what you're doing.",
        "Brad: Uh, yeah. I don't want to right now.",
        "Vienna: Brad.",
        "Brad: Okay. All right, just give me a minute.",
        "[Vienna coughs]",
        "Brad: Just give me a minute here. All right. All right.",
        "Brad: This is -- this is wrong, Vienna. This is wrong.",
        "Vienna: Oh, yeah. Oh, I can feel it starting to work.",
        "Brad: Already?",
        "Vienna: Yeah.",
        "Brad: Mm-hmm. You know, I've been told that I have magic hands.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Katie: What are you doing?",
        "Henry: Unbreast -- unhand her!",
        "Brad: Katie!",
        "Katie: What the hell is going on?",
        "Vienna: Hey, Darling.",
        "Brad: Okay, this is not -- this is not what -- this is not what it looks like.",
        "Katie: What is all over your hands?",
        "Henry: Who cares what's on the hands? Why were they all over Vienna?",
        "Vienna: 'Cause he was helping me breathe.",
        "Brad: I thought you were gonna be at the studio today.",
        "Katie: Obviously.",
        "Brad: Look, she's sick. Vienna -- she's sick.",
        "Katie: Oh, really? So you were just warming her up with your hands?",
        "Brad: No, it's some kind of home remedy.",
        "Katie: No, this is a home remedy!",
        "Brad: It was for the baby.",
        "Katie: Oh, right. For the baby. Vienna's carrying our baby, so you get a free pass.",
        "Brad: Katie --",
        "Katie: Don't let me get in the way of your magical, healing hands!",
        "Brad: Katie, Katie! Katie, come on!",
        "Vienna: Those two, getting all worked up over nothing. Thank goodness you're not like that.",
        "Henry: Guess again, Sweetheart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: Luke, slow down. Where are you going?",
        "Luke: I need to go to Noah's dorm room. I have to make sure he's all right.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Luke: It's Noah. Finally. Where are you?",
        "Noah: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to worry you.",
        "Luke: Why didn't you answer your phone?",
        "Noah: I couldn't.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Noah: Because I was on a plane.",
        "Luke: A plane? You want to repeat that?",
        "Noah: Look --",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Noah: The last couple days, it just really felt like we were getting on each other's nerves, you know?",
        "Luke: We had a disagreement. It was a little -- it was a difference of opinion. I mean, that's what I thought.",
        "Noah: I know. I just -- I think we both could use some time away from each other.",
        "Luke: Where are you?",
        "Noah: Lisbon.",
        "Luke: Lisbon, as in -- as in Portugal? You got to be kidding me.",
        "Noah: Just for a couple days. Maybe -- maybe more.",
        "Luke: What are you doing there?",
        "Noah: When I got back to the dorm a couple guys were there from my film class, and they said they were coming here for a festival.",
        "Luke: So you decided to just go? Just get on that plane without calling me?",
        "Noah: I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: What do you have to be sorry about? You're on vacation.",
        "Noah: It's not a vacation. It all happened so fast. I barely had time to pack.",
        "Luke: Gee, that must really suck for you.",
        "Noah: Look, we were just both fighting so much over Damian.",
        "Luke: I don't care about Damian. I care about you. Why are you doing this?",
        "Noah: Please, don't be mad at me.",
        "Luke: It's just -- you do this all the time. You just leave.",
        "Noah: Damian -- he's your father, your family. I shouldn't be involved.",
        "Luke: Noah, you're my family. And I'm yours.",
        "Noah: It's -- you just need to figure this out on your own. I'm getting in the way.",
        "Luke: You're not making any sense.",
        "Noah: I have to go. They're waiting for me. I'll call you later.",
        "Luke: Wait, Noah, don't --",
        "Zoe: You okay?",
        "Luke: I don't know.",
        "Zoe: I'm sure once you guys get together and do the whole talk-it-out-thing --",
        "Luke: We're a little too far apart for anything right now.",
        "Zoe: You'll work this out, Luke. You and Noah are so close.",
        "Luke: We were close. We were closer than ever. Then Damian showed up. Why does he always do this? Why does he ruin everything?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: We need to have a talk, my dear.",
        "Katie: No, you need to wash your hands. I could smell you coming from a mile away.",
        "Brad: It's not really sexy, is it? Is it?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brad: No. You really don't believe that there's something sexual going on between me and Vienna, do you? I mean, especially not when I'm covered in this goop.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brad: All right, then what is it? I was just doing what you asked me to do -- I was taking care of her. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that why we asked them to move in to the house?",
        "Katie: Yes, it is. I just got finished telling Henry the same thing. That's why we came by with the soup.",
        "Brad: Okay, so? All right, so what happened between the soup and the meltdown?",
        "Katie: I walked in, and I saw you taking care of Vienna, and it hurt.",
        "Brad: Because?",
        "Katie: Because it should've been me.",
        "Brad: Well, I told Vienna, I said, you should wait and let Katie put that stuff on your --",
        "Katie: No, it should've been me you were taking care of. Don't you get it? I want to be Vienna.",
        "Brad: You do. You do.",
        "Katie: I want to be pregnant with our baby. I want to have you rubbing stuff on my chest to make me breathe. I'm sorry! I'm a horrible person!",
        "Brad: Why are you horrible?",
        "Katie: Because she's the pregnant one, and I'm the one having a meltdown. It's not funny. It's not. She's doing this wonderful, amazingly selfless thing for us, and I'm acting like a jealous freak.",
        "Brad: You're the mother of my child, and I wouldn't have you any other way. Don't you know that you mean more to me than anyone?",
        "Katie: Except Vienna. It's true, Brad, at least for the next six months or so. Months, it's true. She's the one that's pregnant.",
        "Brad: I had no idea this was hard on you.",
        "Katie: I'm trying not to let it be. It's just so hard watching her go through all the things that I want to go through and experience, and knowing that I'm never gonna be able to feel any of those things, to feel what it's like to have your baby --",
        "Brad: When the day comes and that doctor puts our baby in your hands, in your arms, you're gonna know. And no one's going to be able to take that away from you.",
        "Katie: Yeah.",

        "Henry: Brad and Katie's?",
        "Vienna: Do you have a problem with that?",
        "Henry: You're carrying their baby.",
        "Vienna: So, nothing has changed?",
        "Henry: No. Nothing's changed.",
        "Vienna: Okay.",

        "Lily: Have you heard from Noah?",
        "Luke: No.",
        "Lily: He is going to come back.",
        "Luke: I wish I could believe that. But the fact that he didn't call me before he boarded that plane, it makes me think that he's not. He's not just taking a break, he's running away.",
        "Lily: Look, whatever Noah is going through, he needs to work this out on his own.",
        "Luke: Great. What do I do until then?",
        "Lily: You've got to stay strong for the both of you. And just remember that wherever he is, he loves you very, very much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Why are you doing this? What do you want with Luke?",
        "Zoe: You think we should tell him?",
        "Zac: Sure. The answers are simple. Answer number one -- you'll find out.",
        "Zoe: Answer number two -- because.",
        "Zac: Answer number three -- you'll see.",
        "Noah: Those aren't answers, you freaks!",
        "Zac: Aww. You're worried about your little boyfriend, aren't you, Monster? Don't worry. As long as Luciano plays along, nobody will get hurt.",
        "Noah: And if he doesn't?",
        "Zoe: We're just going to assume he will.",
        "Noah: Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Where are you going? Where are you going?! What are you -- why are you doing this?! Leave Luke alone!",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Alison: I looked at Casey today, and he wants me. I'm sure.",
        "Carly: I just finished promising Parker that we weren't gonna ambush him any more.",
        "Craig: This isn't an ambush. This is strategy. Nothing makes a kid change their mind faster than saying yes.",
        "Jack: You think it'll work?",
        "Craig: If you stay out of the way."
