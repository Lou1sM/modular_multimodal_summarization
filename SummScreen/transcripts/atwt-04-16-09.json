        "Alison: Sorry I'm late. Wow. How much did you eat?",
        "Casey: Had to carbo-load. This job is stressing me out. How was the lab- observation thing?",
        "Alison: It was interesting. I didn't think you'd be this freaked out about your first day at work.",
        "Casey: I'm working with Jade, remember?",
        "Alison: Yes. Well, you'll be fine. Who's your first passenger?",
        "Casey: Ms. Weinstein. What?",
        "Alison: She hates men!",
        "Casey: How do you know that?",
        "Alison: Ms. Weinstein has a rep. All her doctors are female, and I once even saw her kick a male orderly when he tried to help her into a wheelchair.",
        "Casey: Okay, that's it. I quit.",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no, no. No, you don't. Because you're gonna be the best van driver Memorial has ever had, and that is going to impress the dean, and that is gonna get you back into school.",
        "Casey: Even if I kill Jade?",
        "Alison: If you don't kill Jade, you get a reward.",
        "Casey: Ooh. It better be a good one.",
        "Alison: Well, I've got the rest of the day off, and my mom's on duty at the hospital all day, so the house will be empty. I'll make you lunch.",
        "Casey: Mmm, I likey that.",
        "Alison: And then, after lunch, maybe --",
        "Casey: Maybe?",
        "Alison: We'll see. Come on. I'll walk you to work.",
        "Casey: Awesome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Oh, have you seen Casey?",
        "Susan: No, but I think I heard Alison say that they were meeting for breakfast.",
        "Jade: Great. So, while he's chowing down, I'm stuck here taking full responsibility.",
        "Susan: For what?",
        "Jade: For the project we're supposed to be working on together.",
        "Susan: You volunteered to drive the outpatient van, too?",
        "Jade: I didn't exactly volunteer. Look, its mandatory community service, okay? But at least I'm here early fulfilling my obligations, unlike some people.",
        "Susan: Okay, okay.",
        "Jade: You're late!",
        "Casey: Check your watch. I'm 10 minutes early.",
        "Jade: No. The woman we were supposed to take to the hospital for her appointment has called twice already.",
        "Alison: What did I tell you? Weinstein, hell on wheels.",
        "Jade: Well, I hope you can take time from your busy social life so that we can get our job done here.",
        "Casey: At your service, Jade. Award?",
        "Alison: Only if you don't kill her.",
        "Casey: Easier said than done.",
        "Alison: Hey, Mom.",
        "Susan: Hey. Your boyfriend just went to work with his ex, and you're smiling? I'd like to know why.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, Libby-loo! Oh, my girl! I missed you so much! Oh! How was New York? I made cinnamon rolls. Do you want one?",
        "Liberty: No, no. No, thanks. But, hey, hey. I got you a souvenir.",
        "Janet: Oh, the statue of Liberty key chain! I always wanted one. That's fabulous. I wish I could have gone with you! So, tell me all about it. How was \"Fashionista Weekly\"? Was it absolutely fabulous?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, it was awesome.",
        "Janet: Good, good! So, when do I lose you forever for your internship?",
        "Liberty: Well, not going.",
        "Janet: You're not?",
        "Liberty: No, no.",
        "Janet: But, Honey -- those idiots. I'll bet you were the best person that interviewed for that job. I think I should go to New York myself and smack them upside their stupid heads!",
        "Liberty: Mom, stop. No, Mom. Mom, they offered me the internship, but I turned it down.",
        "Janet: Honey, working for a fashion magazine is a dream of yours.",
        "Liberty: I changed my mind.",
        "Janet: Why?",
        "Liberty: You know, Mom, you were the one who was so upset about me leaving for the whole summer, so I'm home to stay. Be happy. I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey, Honey. Did you sleep all right?",
        "Parker: Yeah. What's with all the cleaning?",
        "Carly: Well, I have decided to turn over a new leaf, starting with getting this house in order.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Carly: Well, I was thinking about the things you said to me in New York about my drinking.",
        "Parker: Look, I was really upset about Liberty and some other stuff, and then I went a little too far.",
        "Carly: I know. You were a little rough on me, yeah, but some of what you said is true.",
        "Parker: Which part?",
        "Carly: I have been drinking too much, Parker, but I'm not an alcoholic, okay? I'm not even close.",
        "Parker: I hope not.",
        "Carly: I've just been using alcohol as a crutch to help me relieve stress, you know? But I've stopped completely.",
        "Parker: If you say so.",
        "Carly: And I've also decided that I'm gonna stop giving you such a hard time about certain things, like your marriage to Liberty.",
        "Parker: Really?",
        "Carly: Really. I just don't want us to fight anymore, Honey. I love you, you know? I'd like to call a truce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Jack, I was just writing you a note.",
        "Jack: You got 30 seconds.",
        "Craig: Until?",
        "Jack: I arrest you for tampering with government property.",
        "Craig: Oh. Well, in that case. There you go. Plenty of time to spare. And I tampered with nothing. You can check for fingerprints, if you'd like.",
        "Jack: Don't think I won't. \"Call me\" that's cute. Why?",
        "Craig: Just trying to keep you informed regarding your offspring.",
        "Jack: Something happen with Parker?",
        "Craig: Yes. He's still married, thanks to you.",
        "Jack: What the hell is that supposed to mean?",
        "Craig: And despite the fact that you derailed all my plans by buying your son a plane ticket to New York --",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Craig: -- I'm not angry with you. Perhaps you just didn't grasp the motive of sending Liberty to Manhattan for an internship.",
        "Jack: I grasped it just fine.",
        "Craig: Because the idea was to get them to reconsider being married so young so we could help them find a chance for a better life.",
        "Jack: And perhaps you didn't grasp the fact that it was a terrible trick to play on a 16-year-old. He was miserable.",
        "Craig: No pain, no gain, but then no worries. I've got another idea, but just make sure you don't blow it this time, Jack, because we might not get another chance to get Liberty and Parker to put their lives back on track.",
        "Jack: Who the hell are you to tell me anything, let alone what's best for my son?",
        "Craig: Well, you don't have to get agitated, Jack. We have a common cause here.",
        "Jack: You and I have nothing in common, Craig.",
        "Craig: Okay. So, I don't waste time spinning my wheels. You want to clarify that one for me?",
        "Jack: Oh, gladly. Stay the hell away from me and my kids. That clear enough for you?",
        "Craig: Do you want Parker and Liberty to be married or not?",
        "Jack: They're too young to be married, Craig.",
        "Craig: Exactly, and I'm trying to correct that. Liberty was ready to spend the entire summer in Manhattan in a dorm room meeting kids her own age.",
        "Jack: I get the picture. Go on.",
        "Craig: The marriage never would have withstood that, and I thought that's what everyone wanted -- you, me, Carly, your new wife. And then you and your plane ticket, you send Parker up there.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? If you hadn't tried to manipulate them in to a situation they weren't ready for, your plan would have worked!",
        "Craig: All I did was give Liberty what she wanted. Now, if you can't see that, your new wife certainly could.",
        "Jack: Don't you dare try to play me against my wife.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Of course I hate the idea of you going away. I mean, you and I, we've been together practically every day since you were hatched, you know? I mean, me without you is like spaghetti without meatballs.",
        "Liberty: I know, Mom --",
        "Janet: And I would never want to stand in the way of a better future for you. I just don't want you to make the same mistake I did.",
        "Liberty: I won't, Mom. I'm not pregnant. I'm not alone. I have a husband and everything.",
        "Janet: But you're giving something up because Parker doesn't want you to do it.",
        "Liberty: Just this once.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, Baby. Listen. \"Just this once\" could eventually turn into a pattern, and that pattern can be very hard to break.",
        "Liberty: Mom, I love him. It's not a pattern I want to break.",
        "Janet: But you're sacrificing yourself.",
        "Liberty: Mom, I gave something up to be with Parker in the same way that he would give something up to be with me.",
        "Janet: Marriage shouldn't be about giving something up. It should be about rooting for each other and being really excited when the other person hits the jackpot!",
        "Liberty: Stop, Mom! Stop talking about it, okay? I'm married now, and I'm sticking with my husband, so please just stop making me feel bad about something I can't change.",
        "Janet: But you can change it.",
        "Liberty: No, Mom, I can't!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: We're all gonna be living under the same roof together, and if you're mad all the time, everybody's gonna be miserable, including Liberty.",
        "Parker: Could you stop talking about her?",
        "Carly: What? Now I can't even mention her name? Parker, I'm making an effort here. I told you I'm not gonna drink anymore. I'm gonna get off your case about your marriage. What more do you want?",
        "Parker: I just don't want to feel like there's always something coming my way.",
        "Carly: Like what?",
        "Parker: Like Craig trying to get Liberty to move to New York without me. He knew that she would have to stay in a dorm. He knew that from the beginning!",
        "Carly: You have my word that nothing like that will happen again, okay?",
        "Parker: Yeah, right. You do whatever Craig tells you to.",
        "Carly: Wait a minute, now. He wanted me to marry him. You see a ring on this finger?",
        "Parker: Not yet.",
        "Carly: Parker, from now on, any decisions about you and Liberty are gonna have to be made only by the two of you. Fair enough?",
        "Parker: I guess.",
        "Carly: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You don't think Liberty's mother should be included in discussions about her child?",
        "Jack: Janet belongs in the discussion, sure, but you don't. Out of all of us, you have the least say in what happens with these kids.",
        "Craig: That's true, but then again, I've had the most influence.",
        "Jack: Because you won't mind your own business!",
        "Craig: No, because Parker made me his trustee. You know, it doesn't matter. Even though New York didn't pan out, something else will set in motion.",
        "Jack: Like what?",
        "Craig: The foundation of this young marriage is already cracked. Now, if you just stay out of my way, I'll see to it that in no time it's irretrievably broken. I'll see you around.",
        "Jack: Wait. What are you gonna do?",
        "Craig: Now you're interested in my plans?",
        "Jack: Just spit it out.",
        "Craig: I found another internship for Liberty, closer to home.",
        "Jack: Giving them what they want.",
        "Craig: Nothing makes a kid change their mind faster than saying \"Yes.",
        "Jack: You think it'll work?",
        "Craig: I know it will, if you stay out of the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Can I get some help, please?",
        "Casey: She already hit me in the elbow with her cane.",
        "Jade: Just get the blanket.",
        "Casey: Here. Ms. Weinstein, the heater isn't really that reliable in the van. Ow!",
        "Ms. Weinstein: You're making me late for my appointment!",
        "Jade: Go easy on him, Ms. Weinstein. He bruises easy.",
        "Casey: Don't worry. We'll get you there in time. Excuse me.",
        "Jade: What are you doing?",
        "Casey: I drove over here.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well, it's my turn.",
        "Casey: No. You have to sit back here with her. She likes you, not guys.",
        "Jade: Look, give me the keys, or we're not going anywhere.",
        "Casey: Anything I can get you, Ms. Weinstein? Okay, I guess you're good. Good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Thank you. So, do you have any surgeries today? Tell me about them.",
        "Susan: I didn't take a coffee break to talk medicine. What's up with you and Casey and Jade?",
        "Alison: They work together.",
        "Susan: They used to do a lot more than that together.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know that. Mom, you don't have to keep telling me about that.",
        "Susan: It doesn't bother you?",
        "Alison: Nope.",
        "Susan: Why do you keep smiling?",
        "Alison: Because Casey's not in to her. In fact, he can't stand her.",
        "Susan: Hmm. And?",
        "Alison: And, I got the day off.",
        "Susan: And?",
        "Alison: And I invited Casey over for lunch after he's done with work.",
        "Susan: I knew it!",
        "Alison: It's just lunch, Mom.",
        "Susan: With dessert on the menu, am I right?",
        "Alison: Well, yes. No. I mean, I don't know. You don't approve?",
        "Susan: Yes, no, I don't know.",
        "Alison: Mom, he's a nice guy.",
        "Susan: Who used to be married to your sister.",
        "Alison: Okay, why do you keep bringing up Casey's sex life?",
        "Susan: Because in his short life, he's had a lot of sex, and if he's pressuring you --",
        "Alison: No, Mom, he isn't. He really isn't.",
        "Susan: But you're not sure about it.",
        "Alison: I'm not sure about me.",
        "Susan: Why not?",
        "Alison: Because of, you know, all the crazy things I did. All the horrible choices I made, whenever the question of sex comes up, I just implode, and I get all hung up and scared, and I end up doing everything wrong.",
        "Susan: That's why you shouldn't rush it.",
        "Alison: I didn't. I have waited, Mom, longer than I have waited ever with anyone, but I looked at Casey today, and I just knew. He wants me, only me, and I want him. So, finally, yes, I'm sure. Today's the day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Why'd you stop?",
        "Jade: It just died on me.",
        "Casey: Okay. We should check under the hood.",
        "Ms. Weinstein: Are we at the hospital?",
        "Casey: Don't worry. We'll be there soon. We'll get you there on time, beautiful.",
        "Jade: How did you do that? 10 minutes ago, she was trying to hit you with her cane.",
        "Casey: Well, I just asked her about her life, you know? Actually, in the '60s, she ran a nudist colony.",
        "Jade: You're so full of it. I thought Ms. Weinstein would be smart enough to realize that, too. Okay. I think it's the carburetor.",
        "Casey: What? Did you just, like, pull that out of thin air?",
        "Jade: No. I used to take an auto-mechanics class. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Casey: Ugh! What were you saying?",
        "Jade: Oops.",
        "Casey: That's what you said an hour ago, and there's still no truck here. Well, are you sending one or no? Are you serious? Of course I'm gonna be here. Where else am I gonna go?",
        "Jade: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Casey: There's a backlog, and there's no trucks available. It's gonna be a couple of hours.",
        "Jade: Well, can't we call someone else?",
        "Casey: If you want to pay out of your own pocket, you know? The hospital has a contract with the garage. At least Ms. Weinstein's sleeping.",
        "Jade: Are you sure she's not dead?",
        "Casey: She was snoring. Man, we were supposed to be done a while ago.",
        "Jade: You got plans or something?",
        "Casey: I'll tell you what. You stay here and watch for the tow truck. I'll hitch a ride back.",
        "Jade: No, no, no. Why don't you stay here, and I'll go back.",
        "Casey: It's not safe for you to hitch.",
        "Jade: Oh, right. You're concerned with my safety.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Casey: Hello?",
        "Alison: Hey. Are you back at the hospital yet?",
        "Casey: Not yet.",
        "Alison: Well, I forgot to ask if you're allergic to anything.",
        "Casey: No. No, I'm not.",
        "Alison: Good. Do you hate goat cheese?",
        "Casey: I love everything.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, what time do you want to come over?",
        "Casey: Alison, look -- I'm not gonna be able to make lunch.",
        "Alison: Why not?",
        "Casey: Our van broke down. I'm really sorry.",
        "Alison: No problem. It wasn't that big of a deal anyway. Some other time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Hey, did Liberty call?",
        "Carly: In the two minutes you were taking out the garbage? No.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Parker: So, did your mom like her present?",
        "Liberty: Oh, the key chain. Yeah, yeah, she liked it.",
        "Parker: And she must be glad that you're not going to New York for the summer.",
        "Liberty: Pretty much.",
        "Parker: Well, I talked to my mom, too, and it was good. Really good.",
        "Liberty: Any special reason?",
        "Parker: Yeah. First of all, she has decided to stop drinking, and she's also said that she's gonna take it a little bit easier on us which would make things not so tense around here.",
        "Liberty: Well, that's great, considering we can't afford anything else.",
        "Parker: Well, we can get summer jobs, right? Maybe even together?",
        "Liberty: Mmm, sounds awesome.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Craig: Good morning, Parker --",
        "Parker: Mom, it's for you.",
        "Craig: I think I know how you're feeling these days.",
        "Parker: And you would know that I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Craig: Well, I was hoping that you'd give me the chance to make it up to you. I mean, I am sorry about what happened in New York. I was really just trying to help Liberty. I didn't think anything would come of it.",
        "Carly: Well, why don't we just forget about that, huh?",
        "Craig: Well, I do have another proposition.",
        "Carly: Maybe it's not such a good time.",
        "Parker: That's right. It's not. Come on, Liberty.",
        "Craig: Why don't you just hear the offer, and then the kids can decide for themselves. That is what you want, isn't it?",
        "Liberty: Yeah. I think maybe we can hear him out.",
        "Parker: What's the offer?",
        "Craig: Well, since Liberty couldn't take the job with \"Fashionista Weekly,\" I have an alternative.",
        "Parker: In New York?",
        "Craig: In Chicago. I do work with a P.R. firm there that uses summer interns.",
        "Liberty: Oh, public relations. I don't really know much about that.",
        "Parker: Yeah, so that would probably be very boring for you, right?",
        "Craig: Well, I know that your main interest is fashion, and it's not that, but they do work with a lot of designers, and it's close enough to home that Liberty could live here and commute. So, why don't you two talk about it and tell me what you think. How about a cup of coffee?",
        "Carly: I just finished promising Parker that we weren't gonna ambush him anymore.",
        "Craig: This isn't an ambush. This is strategy. Brilliant strategy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Come here.",
        "Janet: You've got that look.",
        "Jack: Mmm! Like I want to grind Craig Montgomery up and use him as mulch?",
        "Janet: That's the one, yeah!",
        "Jack: When he set this whole New York thing in motion, he made things worse for the kids, and he's doing it again.",
        "Janet: What did he do?",
        "Jack: Got Liberty another internship closer to home.",
        "Janet: He did?",
        "Jack: Yeah, and he dropped by the station to give me instructions so I wouldn't ruin his plans. The guy's a flipping moron.",
        "Janet: Well, he's arrogant. But come on, tell me more about this job.",
        "Jack: He didn't give me any details. Don't tell me you think this is a good idea.",
        "Janet: Heck, yeah, I think it's a great idea! When Liberty told me she turned down the internship in New York, I got scared.",
        "Jack: Of what?",
        "Janet: That she'd end up like me.",
        "Jack: And that's such a bad thing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",

        "Parker: Yeah, right.",
        "Liberty: Chicago is so close, Parker. You were just talking about it, too. You said maybe I could find an internship there.",
        "Parker: I know, but does he really have to be the person to find it for you?",
        "Liberty: Parker, it doesn't matter who opens the door for me. It's what I do at the job when I get it, and it would look so good on my college applications.",
        "Parker: Okay. I guess. If you really want to.",
        "Liberty: Parker, what is so wrong about checking it out? We don't have to decide anything right this second.",
        "Parker: You want to think about it for a few more days?",
        "Liberty: No. I want to go to the interview, and I want to see if I like what they have to offer, okay? And then we will decide. How does that sound?",
        "Craig: Look, anything that gets Liberty out of Parker's bedroom and into the real world is bound to put some distance between them, and it's like natural evolution. Little by little, they begin to realize that this ridiculous marriage is just holding them both back.",
        "Carly: Liberty may realize that, but I don't know about Parker. He adores her.",
        "Craig: Believe it or not, I was once a lovesick teenager myself. Trust me, this will pass. Just be there for him.",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi!",
        "Liberty: We talked about it, and do you think maybe I could get an interview today?",
        "Craig: You know, I think that can be arranged, but Carly and I have a meeting. We can't go with you.",
        "Liberty: Oh, no. It's okay. I can borrow my mom's car and drive myself.",
        "Parker: And I'll come with you.",
        "Carly: Don't you have baseball practice?",
        "Liberty: Oh, yeah. Go to your practice, but I'll be home by the time you're done, and I can pick you up.",

        "Janet: I know, I know. I didn't mean it like that. It's a good job, and I'm lucky to have it right now, and I love my life with you, but having Liberty so young limited my possibilities, and I don't want her to make that mistake.",
        "Jack: I don't want that for Parker either.",
        "Janet: So maybe Craig's plan \"B-\" isn't such a bad thing.",
        "Jack: The thing about Craig's plans is that whether they work or not, someone always ends up getting hurt, and it's never Craig.",
