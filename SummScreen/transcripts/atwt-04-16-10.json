        "Jack: Hello, this is Jack Snyder. I'm calling for an update on the condition of a patient. Rocco Ciccone. I'm his ex-son-in-law. How's that work for you? [Jack laughs] Not family? I'm also the lead detective on the Dusty Donovan shooting. How about that? Great. When was his condition upgraded from critical to stable? All right, thank you.",

        "Jack: Snyder.",
        "Carly: Jack, it's me.",
        "Jack: Carly, what's wrong?",
        "Carly: I need you to come home right now.",
        "Jack: Is something going on?",
        "Carly: It's an emergency. Please, I need you.",
        "Jack: Call dispatch. I need any available unit over to my house in Milltown, ASAP.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I found your father's doctor.",
        "Janet: Well, where is he?",
        "Dusty: He's going into surgery. He said Rocco's vitals are good.",
        "Janet: Why won't they let me see him?",
        "Dusty: They'll let you in soon. They officially released me this morning.",
        "Janet: That's good.",
        "Dusty: The house is gonna take a while to close. There's a suite available right next to mine at the Lakeview. I could move you and Liberty in there today, get you out of Carly's house, and we can all be together.",
        "Janet: I'm sorry, Dusty. That's not gonna happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I can't make up my mind. Do I want to have you arrested for trespassing, or do I want to handle this the old-fashioned way?",
        "Molly: Holden, he's not worth it. Let him go. Holden, please.",
        "Holden: Don't come back here again.",
        "Silas: I really just wanted to introduce myself, but, apparently my reputation precedes me, as does yours.",
        "Molly: Silas, don't.",
        "Holden: Excuse me?",
        "Silas: You're the guy who spent the night with his ex, so Molly could have a drink with me. I owe you. Pleasure to meet you.",
        "[Molly sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith, I know you think you have all the answers. I thought so, too, when I was your age.",
        "Faith: Right, because it takes a genius to figure out you want Dad back.",
        "Lily: You're wrong. I don't want your father back. What I want is to make sure that I don't forget to pack all the stuff you need at the farm. [Lily sighs] I know that you're excited not to have to deal with me 24-7, but I think you're in for a surprise when you see what your grandmother has in store for you, living with her and your dad at the farm.",
        "Faith: And Molly.",
        "Lily: Why are you doing this?",
        "Faith: Because I was there at the cabin, and I you and Dad looking at each other. Talk about totally obvious.",
        "Lily: That's funny because it was obvious to me that your father is in a serious relationship with Molly.",
        "Faith: As if that would stop you.",
        "Lily: What did you just say?",
        "Faith: You want Dad back. I'm not saying you go for it, but at least don't deny it.",
        "Lily: I am not doing this with you. Your father and I are a team when it comes to you and the kids -- that's it. It's been since the divorce. And as for Molly, I wish them well.",
        "Faith: No, you don't.",
        "Lily: Faith, I let your father go a while ago.",
        "Faith: Well, I hope you mean it because you don't stand a chance against Molly.",
        "Lily: I'm gonna get you some sheets to take to the farm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly, you okay?",
        "Carly: I, uh, I think it was a false alarm, detective Snyder.",
        "Jack: Carly?",
        "Carly: There's been, um, a little misunderstanding.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Carly: I just wanted you to come home for a little alone time, so I might have overplayed the emergency angle a little bit because when I called you, I wasn't aware that you were gonna send a S.W.A.T. team.",
        "Cop: I think we'll just let you guys work out the details, Detective.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Carly: Hey, uh, maybe you guys could not call this one in over the radio, huh? [Carly laughs] Thanks. [Carly clears throat]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Carly: Now, I know you're mad, but my intentions were good. Come on, Detective. Cuff me. Oh, come on, Jack. For God's sake, can't you lighten up for 30 seconds?",
        "Jack: What the hell were you thinking?",
        "Carly: What am I thinking? Well, for starters, I haven't had two minutes alone with you in what feels like weeks. The kids are in school, Janet's at the hospital with her father, so I started thinking, \"Wouldn't it be fun to get Jack home and into bed in the middle of the day?\" But, obviously, that was a lousy idea!",
        "Jack: I'm a cop, Carly. I came over here thinking you were actually in trouble. And on top of it, I mean --",
        "Carly: You called for backup. I know.",
        "Jack: Do you have any idea how embarrassing it was for me to walk in here and see you like that, with --",
        "Carly: For who -- you? Because they were great about it. They thought it was funny. Why can't you?",
        "Jack: Because I was working, Carly. I was in the middle of a case!",
        "Carly: Oh, please. I know exactly what you were doing. You were sitting at your desk, obsessing about who shot Dusty, because even your work has to be about Janet!",
        "Jack: Oh, that's crazy.",
        "Carly: Do you know what I think is crazy? That you haven't said a word about what I'm wearing.",
        "Jack: [Chuckles] Don't you mean what you're not wearing? And you -- [Jack laughs] Stop it. You look fantastic. You look fantastic.",
        "Carly: Keep talking while you still can. You can't stay mad at me, can you?",
        "Jack: Oh, yes, when you look that good, you don't make it easy.",
        "Carly: So, am I forgiven?",
        "Jack: [Chuckles] Well, that depends if Margo takes my badge for this.",
        "Carly: I'll vouch for you.",
        "Jack: You might have to.",
        "Carly: It's your own damn fault.",
        "Jack: Is it, now?",
        "Carly: Yeah, 'cause you make me work so damn hard just to get a little attention from you.",
        "Jack: Guess what -- I'm here now, aren't I?",
        "Carly: I guess we're about to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: My father had a heart attack because he was fighting with you.",
        "Dusty: He's okay now. I spoke with the doctor. Your father does not want you to put your life on hold.",
        "Janet: Oh, so now you're speaking for him, too?",
        "Dusty: It makes no sense for you and Liberty to be living with Jack and Carly when I have a place for you. We can be together and get on with our lives.",
        "Janet: You know, it's funny. Not so long ago, you were telling me that I needed to get on with my life without you.",
        "Dusty: I was protecting you.",
        "Janet: You lied to me. You lied about how hurt you were. You lied about being in cahoots with Carly so you could set up my father.",
        "Dusty: It wasn't that simple.",
        "Janet: Don't justify it. He's in recovery, and the shooter is still out there somewhere.",
        "Dusty: Can we talk about us?",
        "Janet: All right. My feelings for you --",
        "Dusty: Your feelings have changed?",
        "Janet: In that I'm not sure I can trust you again? Yeah.",
        "Nurse: Mrs. Snyder? Your father is asking for you.",
        "Janet: Oh, thank you. Hi, Pop. How you feeling?",
        "Rocco: I'm okay. Don't worry.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? I was worried sick.",
        "Rocco: About your old man? Come on.",
        "Janet: No, it's true. I just got you back. I couldn't stand the thought of losing you again.",
        "Rocco: I wasn't going to let that happen, not before I told you I'm sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Holden, when you went up to the cabin with Faith and Lily, I decided to go out for a drink at the Lakeview, alone, and then he walked in.",
        "Holden: Oh, prison break?",
        "Silas: Justice prevailed. All the charges against me were dropped.",
        "Holden: I see. So you didn't actually try to kill Molly in New York?",
        "Silas: Hyperbole can be very damaging, Mr. Snyder. But luckily for me, Molly has been quite forgiving.",
        "Holden: You're something else. Did you use this same slick routine to get elected, too?",
        "Silas: Molly and I had a very productive discussion about our past relationship. I admitted that I have made some very big mistakes. I expressed my desire to atone for them. And being a reporter, Molly can provide a forum for me to do so.",
        "Holden: What the hell is he talking about?",
        "Silas: I'm talking about the two of us doing a TV interview.",
        "Holden: Wait a minute. You want to do an interview with the woman that you not only cheated on your wife with, but that you also tried to kill in New York?",
        "Molly: No, I didn't agree to anything, Holden.",
        "Silas: I know this is a volatile subject for the two of you, but, truly, this is in Molly's best interest, as well as mine.",
        "Holden: Why don't you get out of here while you can still walk? I said go. Are you okay?",
        "Molly: Not really.",
        "Holden: [Sighs] I can't believe he got out.",
        "Molly: I can't believe how freaked out I was when he just walked in here like that.",
        "Holden: Well, why wouldn't you be?",
        "Molly: It's just I've made some really lousy choices with men, present company excluded. Silas is the walking, talking manifestation of my terrible judgment.",
        "Holden: Well, you know what? That part of your life is over now, for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Liberty, hey. How are you?",
        "Liberty: Hanging in there.",
        "Lily: You look wonderful. It's great to see you out and about.",
        "Liberty: Thanks. I think I'll feel better when my doctor tells me my blood work looks better than I do. [Liberty chuckles] I hope Faith didn't get into trouble with you guys. She really helped me out, getting me back to Oakdale and everything.",
        "Lily: You know what, Faith? Why don't you chat with Liberty? I just remembered something else I want to get you to take to the farm.",
        "Faith: Okay.",
        "Faith: I'm moving in with my dad.",
        "Liberty: Seriously?",
        "Faith: Yeah, I even think I'm getting your old room.",
        "Liberty: Is, uh, everything okay with you and your mom?",
        "Faith: Yeah, it's -- whatever. It'll be better when I'm not living with her, like, all the time.",
        "Liberty: I hear you. I can't believe you're moving in when I'm moved out.",
        "Faith: I know. Could have been fun with us both being there at the same time, but you moved somewhere better. You're living with Parker.",
        "Liberty: It's actually not such a great thing for us.",
        "Faith: Really? You guys seem so close.",
        "Liberty: We were. We are, but the thing is, Parker, well, he told me he wants to get back together. That's not what I want right now, and I think I really hurt his feelings.",
        "Faith: Wow.",
        "Liberty: We're already such good friends, you know? But when it's something about this, I'm not the friend he needs.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You don't have to do this now. You just need to concentrate on getting better and getting back on your feet.",
        "Rocco: No, Jan, I took too long.",
        "Janet: You're here now -- that's all that matters.",
        "Rocco: No, Honey. I treated you so badly when you needed me most. I should never have done that. I ruined your life.",
        "Janet: No, you didn't. No, you didn't. You're here now for me and for Liberty.",
        "Rocco: I want you to know something. I'm going to earn back your respect, whatever it takes. I almost blew it, but I have a second chance, and I swear to you, I won't waste it. I want to deserve the honor of calling you my daughter.",
        "Janet: I was always your daughter, and I forgive you. Oh, Pop. [Janet sniffles] You saved Dusty's life, didn't you?",
        "Rocco: It wouldn't have needed saving if I hadn't stuck my nose in something I had nothing to do with in the first place.",
        "Janet: It wasn't your fault.",
        "Rocco: I didn't think the guy was right for you. If I'd just stayed out of it -- I never wanted to see him hurt.",
        "Janet: I know that, okay? I know. So you need to get better, okay? Because the hardware store can't do anything without you.",
        "Rocco: What -- what would you say if I sold that place and moved your mom here?",
        "Janet: You -- you would do that? Why?",
        "Rocco: So we can be close to you and Liberty and Dusty. I'm not sure how many years we have left, but I don't want to waste any more of them.",
        "Janet: I'd like that.",
        "Rocco: Good. And I promise you, I'm gonna get back on my feet so I can use them to dance with you at your wedding.",
        "[Janet sighs]",
        "Rocco: Dusty's a good man, Janet.",
        "Janet: Dusty doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is you getting better, okay? All right, can I get you anything?",
        "Rocco: I'd kill for your mom's lasagna.",
        "Janet: Oh, that's a good sign.",
        "Rocco: Yeah, something tells me that's not what they're gonna give me on the heart-healthy menu they'll give me when I get out of here.",
        "Janet: Well, I will get the nurses to get you some lunch, okay? Anything else I can get you?",
        "Rocco: A clean shirt would be good. They ripped the one I had on when they used those paddles on me.",
        "Janet: Oh, I hate that they had to do that.",
        "Rocco: Hey, I'm still here.",
        "Janet: I'm so glad you are.",
        "Rocco: I love you, Jan. You're my girl.",
        "[Speaking Italian]",
        "Janet: I always was, Pop. Okay, get some rest. Did you hear any of that?",
        "Dusty: Most of it, yeah.",
        "Janet: He's a changed man, Dusty. He was a little set in his ways, but he's different now. It's obvious.",
        "Dusty: I never meant to hurt you. You gotta know that.",
        "Janet: I'm gonna get some stuff for my dad, and I'll be back. We can talk then.",
        "Dusty: Okay. How's your heart?",
        "Rocco: Still pumping.",
        "Dusty: [Sighs] Thanks for saving me.",
        "Rocco: The least I could do. And Jan shot me down about it. I wanted to tell her everything.",
        "Dusty: Maybe that's not best.",
        "Rocco: I just want to handle things differently now. I've wasted so much time.",
        "Dusty: You can still set things right.",
        "Rocco: What are you getting at?",
        "Dusty: Tell me the name of the guy Ralph hired to take me out.",
        "Rocco: Not only can I tell you his name -- I can tell you where to find him, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: I'm kind of surprised you didn't get back together with Parker.",
        "Liberty: I know it's hard to understand, but you wouldn't get it unless you've been in my situation.",
        "Faith: I get it. But it's not like there's somebody else, right?",
        "Liberty: Another guy?",
        "Faith: Why is that so nuts?",
        "Liberty: Aside from the fact that I'm recovering from chemo and bald under this hat?",
        "Faith: Hats can be trendy.",
        "Liberty: [Scoffs] There's no other guy, not even a possible contender.",
        "Faith: So, why'd you say no?",
        "Liberty: Because Parker is my best friend. And I finally get what that means now, after all he did for me while I was in the hospital. The idea of losing that connection just so we can hook up -- it's so not worth it. Hey.",
        "Lily: Hey.",
        "Liberty: You're back. Did you get everything you need?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I think so.",
        "Liberty: Faith told me she's moving in with her dad.",
        "Lily: That's our next stop.",
        "Liberty: You're going to love living at the farm.",
        "Faith: I hope so.",
        "Liberty: Just remember -- I spent a lot of time being mad at people. You never really get that time back later on, you know?",
        "Lily: Thank you, Sweetheart. And good luck with your doctors.",
        "Liberty: Thanks. I'll talk to you soon?",
        "Faith: Definitely.",
        "[Lily exhales sharply]",
        "Lily: She is just amazing -- so strong and mature.",
        "Faith: Unlike me?",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Faith: Please, like that's not what you meant.",
        "Lily: That's not what I meant at all.",
        "Faith: Right. Can we go now? 'Cause Dad's waiting for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: You were very macho with Silas. You know that?",
        "Holden: I wanted to rip his head off.",
        "Molly: I know you did.",
        "Holden: If he comes near you or this house --",
        "Molly: Let's not go there. The guy is smug, but he's not stupid. You know what? Before he came in here, weren't we talking about doing some very naughty things in a hayloft?",
        "Holden: I think you were doing all the talking.",
        "Molly: Oh, yeah? So, what are you saying -- you're not interested?",
        "Holden: No, no. I'm interested.",
        "Molly: Mmm.",
        "[Holden chuckles]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Faith: I'm here.",
        "Holden: Faith. Hey, Honey. So you're all set, huh?",
        "Faith: More than you know.",
        "Lily: Should we have called first?",
        "Holden: No. No, it's fine. I'm glad you're here. We were looking forward to it, right, Molly?",
        "Molly: As always, your timing is just perfect, Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You do know what we do to people who break the law, don't you, Ms. Tenney?",
        "Carly: No, Officer, I'm afraid I don't, but I think I'd like to find out.",
        "Jack: We'll see. This, skimpy as it is, is entirely in my way.",
        "Carly: Get rid of it.",
        "Jack: But it's evidence.",
        "Carly: This is pretty much an open-and-shut case, as these things go.",
        "Jack: They never are. There's no such thing.",
        "Carly: Really? Keep talking.",
        "Jack: I'm kind of running out of things to say.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] It's about time.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Janet gasps]",
        "Carly: What the hell?!",
        "Janet: Oh, my God!",
        "Jack: Janet.",
        "Janet: I don't know what's wrong with me. I should have knocked. I just -- I'm gonna go.",
        "Jack: No, wait. Um, I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: So, what the hell are you sorry for?",
        "Jack: You heard her, Carly. It was an accident.",
        "Carly: Tell me something, Janet -- did you get an eyeful?",
        "Jack: Carly!",
        "Carly: Is this what you were hoping to see, what you hoped to walk in on?",
        "Janet: Oh, my God, no! What's wrong with you?",
        "Carly: You want to know what's wrong with me? You want to know what my problem is, Janet? I'll tell you -- it's you.",
        "Janet: I know you're mad at me.",
        "Carly: Oh, you picked up on that, did you?",
        "Janet: And I can't say how sorry I am. I just came in here to borrow one of Jack's shirts.",
        "Carly: What? Why?",
        "Janet: For my father. I didn't realize that you guys -- I didn't think you'd be here right now.",
        "Carly: Of course you didn't. And you know why?",
        "Jack: Carly.",
        "Carly: Because you never think. You never realize. You act like this is your house, like Jack is still your husband, like what's his is yours, and I have had it!",
        "Jack: Okay, why -- why don't we go down to the kitchen and talk about this, okay?",
        "Carly: What? Well, why should I go to the kitchen? This is my bedroom! She shouldn't be here!",
        "Jack: It was an accident.",
        "Carly: I swear to God, Jack, if you start defending her --",
        "Jack: No, Carly, I'm just trying to be reasonable about this.",

        "Carly: Oh, but much more difficult for her than it is for me, right? I should put her feelings ahead of my own the way you do -- is that it? What more can you possibly ask of me, Jack? I've given her a place at my table. I've given up my privacy. All I have left is you. And, yes, I know she's pregnant, and I can deal with that, and I can deal with you worrying about her every second of every day, but when is it gonna be enough?!",

        "Carly: I may not have a sick kid or a father in the hospital or a fianc\u00e9 with a bullet wound in the back of his head, but I do have a life, and I have a right to that life, and Jack is a part of that life. And if I want to spend time with him alone in the afternoon in my own home, I have a right to do that without worrying that his ex-wife is gonna walk in on us!",

        "Carly: I have gone along with absolutely everything you've asked of me, Jack. And there have been times I didn't want to, but I did. I went along with it, with all of it for you. So pardon me for being a little upset that when we finally had some time alone together in what I thought was the privacy of our own bedroom, Janet chose that exact time to borrow one of your damn shirts!",

        "Carly: I wanted to have sex with you, Jack, and that's not something I should have to schedule in my own house! I want to have sex when I want to have sex, and Janet got that!",

        "Jack: Do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now?",
        "Carly: I sound selfish? You are the only person who wants Janet to stay here, and I think it's time that you stopped and looked at that and figured out why because it's becoming really clear to me that you'd rather put a roof over her pregnant head than preserve anything we might have found together again.",
