        "Ben: I think I know who to call.",
        "Jessica: If you cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint one \r\nto you free of charge prior \r\nto questioning.",
        "Ben: Last I checked, I could afford it.",
        "Bailiff: Dr. Harris --",
        "Ben: I understand my rights, bailiff. Thank you.",
        "Jessica: Uh, I'll come down and help you with the paperwork. Listen, \r\nBen, but thank you, really. \r\nSweetheart, I need to go \r\ndownstairs and file some \r\npapers for Ben.",
        "Bonnie: I don't understand you.",
        "Jessica: What do you mean?",
        "Bonnie: I mean, it makes me sick to my stomach that Ben is going to \r\njail and Marshall is going \r\nfree. ",
        "Jessica: Believe me, Bonnie, I know exactly how you feel. I know it's \r\nhard to accept, but --",
        "Bonnie: Then why are you accepting it?",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, my reasons for pursuing this conviction, I just wanted \r\nMarshall to admit what he'd \r\ndone to me.",
        "Bonnie: He didn't admit a damn thing, mom.",
        "Jessica: Yes, he did. Yes, he did, yesterday. After you left, Marshall \r\nfound me in the courtroom. \r\nAnd you heard me tell him \r\nthat he was afraid to take \r\nthe stand. Well, I guess I \r\npushed some kind of button \r\nor something, because he \r\nplopped himself down in the \r\nwitness stand and allowed me \r\nto question him.",
        "Jessica: And he said it to my face. He admitted that he raped me.",
        "",
        "Barbara: I was kidnapped, chloroformed, held captive in a cabin in the \r\nwoods. And that man is \r\nresponsible. Craig \r\nMontgomery!",
        "Paul: Mom, are you saying that you saw Craig?",
        "Barbara: I know it was him. I knew it was him, because he knew my \r\ndesigns were brilliant, and \r\nhe wanted to stop me, \r\nbecause he wanted Carly to \r\nwin out. So he had me \r\nkidnapped.",
        "Craig: Barbara, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. \r\nYou're not wanted here.",
        "Rosanna: Do you know anything about this?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Rosanna: Don't lie to me.",
        "Carly: No. No, I swear to you. I have no idea what she's talking about.",
        "Craig: Jack, this is my house, my wedding. You here as a cop or a \r\nguest?",
        "Jack: I need answers, Craig.",
        "Paul: All right, mom, you made your point. Let's get you to --",
        "Barbara: Not until Craig has handcuffs on his wrists.",
        "Craig: You remember Hal's wedding? Barbara careening around in the \r\nbackyard? Nothing but \r\ntrouble.",
        "Barbara: And you never change.",
        "Craig: Barbara, have I been anywhere near you? No, I've been planning a \r\nwedding with my wife.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I'm sure you have an alibi, Craig. But it doesn't matter, \r\nbecause you had help, \r\nco-conspirators, and at \r\nleast two of them were \r\nwomen. Look familiar, \r\nladies? I snatched this off \r\nthe wrist of one of my \r\ncaptors. Now, which of you \r\ndarlings wants to claim it?\r\n",
        "",
        "Bonnie: Why would he admit he raped you?",
        "Jessica: I'm sure that wasn't his intention. I think he expected to \r\npersuade me that I was \r\nwrong, that it was no \r\ndifferent from what we had \r\ndone before. But I took him \r\nthrough it, moment by \r\nmoment. And he was forced to \r\nsee it with new eyes. And he \r\nwas -- he was surprised. He \r\ndidn't realize --",
        "Bonnie: Are you serious? Come on, mom!",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, I'm not denying what he did. I'm just saying that he \r\nhas been denying it to \r\nhimself.",
        "Bonnie: So this was, like, what? His moment of truth?",
        "Jessica: Yes, I think it was.",
        "Bonnie: Then why did he show up here this morning still claiming he's \r\ninnocent?",
        "Jessica: Because he is not prepared to go public.",
        "Bonnie: And you're supposed to accept that? Can't you see here, mom, \r\nnothing has changed? You \r\nstill have to prosecute him. \r\nAnd now, with his confession --",
        "Jessica: It's still my word against his.",
        "Bonnie: Have you spoken with Margo or Evelyn? Anyone?",
        "Jessica: Yes, I talked to Margo, and I'm telling you.",
        "Bonnie: And that's it? That's it? Marshall has his little emotional \r\nmoment with you, and he gets \r\nto go off scott-free?",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, it wasn't like that.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, tell it to the next woman he rapes.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Or maybe that doesn't really bother you. You know, the fact \r\nthat he's out there, he can \r\ndo it again to someone.",
        "Jessica: Of course it bothers me. But we did the best we could -- you, \r\nme, Ben, Margo, Evelyn. And \r\nwe didn't achieve \r\neverything, but it was more \r\nthan I expected. And, \r\nBonnie, that's how life is. \r\nYou set a goal, you do your \r\nbest.",
        "Bonnie: You want to give up? Fine. You give up. But I'm not done, not \r\nby a long shot.",

        "Marshall: Jessica?",
        "Jessica: What are you still doing here?",
        "Marshall: Just waiting on the commotion to die down so I could \r\ncongratulate you.",
        "Jessica: Congratulate me?",
        "Marshall: Now the world will never hear a jury say \"not guilty.\" And \r\nI've got to hand it to Ben, \r\nhe gave quite a performance.",
        "Jessica: That wasn't a performance. That was straight from his heart. \r\nNow, if you'll excuse me --",
        "Marshall: I came here today to change my plea.",
        "Jessica: So why didn't you?",
        "Marshall: Because I knew it wouldn't make any difference. I could spend \r\nten years in jail, and you \r\nstill wouldn't forgive me. \r\nSo what was the point?",
        "",
        "Barbara: Rose? Is this yours? No, a little too refined for you, I \r\nthink.",
        "Rose: Oh, refined? Oh, you're the picture of refinement, crashing a \r\nwedding like this.",
        "Barbara: How about you Carly? No, I think not. Timing isn't your strong \r\nsuit.",
        "Carly: Ah -- don't touch me.",
        "Barbara: That leaves Emily.",
        "Hal: Can I see this, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: They were feeding me like a dog, Hal. They were pushing food \r\nat me through a hole in the \r\ndoor. I grabbed this off of \r\none of their wrists.",
        "Hal: Did you draw blood?",
        "Barbara: I was kidnapped. You got to believe me. Jack, tell him.",
        "Hal: Excuse me.",
        "Barbara: Jack, make him believe me.",
        "Jack: That's not why we're here, Barbara.",
        "Rosanna: Really? Why are you here, Jack? This is hardly the time or \r\nplace for a serious \r\ninvestigation. ",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry, Rosanna. I really am. None of this is directed at \r\nyou.",
        "Rosanna: Nevertheless, this is my wedding. Or it was until you decided \r\nto turn it into a \r\nfree-for-all.",
        "Barbara: But this is Craig's fault. You have to understand that. He \r\nknew that I was about to \r\nturn in my designs to you, \r\nand Carly knew it, too. So \r\nthey had to get rid of me.",
        "Carly: Is that what you think, Jack? You think I was so afraid of this \r\n-- of this has-been that I \r\narranged to have her \r\nkidnapped?",
        "Jack: I'm just trying to nail down the circumstances surrounding \r\nBarbara's abduction.",
        "Barbara: That's right. I was abducted.",
        "Rosanna: And you've obviously been through a horrible ordeal. So, I'll \r\nmake this short. Regardless \r\nof the circumstances, you \r\ndid fail to turn in your \r\ndesigns as promised, \r\nBarbara.",
        "Barbara: Because I couldn't.",
        "Rosanna: So we decided to go in a different direction.",

        "Rosanna: We are using Carly's designs.",
        "Barbara: What?",
        "Rosanna: I will have a messenger drop off a check for you at the \r\nLakeview.",
        "Barbara: Wait a second. Wait a second. She turned in designs? Do you \r\nhear that, Jack? That's the \r\nproof! That's the proof! \r\nArrest them!",
        "Emily: Hey.",
        "Hal: Hey.",
        "Emily: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again, huh?",
        "Hal: Yeah, well, Barbara does have a way of turning a happy occasion on \r\nits ear.",
        "Emily: Yeah. But we survived, right?",

        "Isaac: Well, you can look at it like this -- with Ben refusing to \r\ntestify, at least they can't \r\nuse him to hammer your \r\nmother. And a mistrial's \r\nbetter than an acquittal.",
