Casey goes after her, but she is too hurt and embarrassed to listen to what he has to say. Inside Casey is cornered by is parents wanting to talk to him about the condom, but he wants none of the conversation. He gets so frustrated with Margo's constant nagging about the subject, he blurts out that Margo has no right to lecture him about sexual responsibility considering her track record. Outside, Kim talks to Celia and tells her to give Casey a chance to explain because she is sure Casey would not do anything to disrespect her feelings. Celia is overwhelmed with Kim's kindness, and takes her up on her offer to drive her home, and stop for lattes on the way. Craig asks Henry why he and Katie lied to him, and Henry tells him that it was not their place. However, Craig chides Henry's supposed morals claiming that he was just afraid Katie and Mike would find their way back to one another if the baby were his. Katie shows up back at the gym upon receiving confirmation inadvertently from the doctor that Jen was stressed about the baby and when her due date was. She talks further with Craig who is lamenting over his wanting a second chance with fatherhood, and by accident tells Craig that Jen is not 10 weeks along, but rather only 5 weeks pregnant. Jen and Mike discuss if he can really take on being a father to Craig's baby, because it would require him lying for many years to come. He convinces Jen he wants to, and the only person they are now worried about spilling the beans is Barbara. They invite her over to talk, and Jen threatens that if Barbara breathes a word of this, Jen will cut her out of her and her baby's life and never forgive her. Barbara agrees to Jen's boundaries, and Mike decides that everything feels right now, and asks Jen to marry him, and an excited Jen agrees. Les has shown up to take JJ, but Carly tries to stop him, and hits him over the head, and tells JJ to take off. An angry Les tries to strangle Carly, but JJ shows back up with a baseball bat, and hits Les over the head again. However, Les comes through in time to stop Carly and JJ from escaping. Lily and Keith find Julia's cell phone with a drop of blood on it hidden in the wall at Les' halfway house room. They decide to wait for Jack for help, and when they call looking for him, Hal tells them Les has received custody of JJ. They rush over to Carly and Jack's only to find Carly unconscious and JJ gone. When Carly comes through, she tells them Les has JJ.

        "Kim: Casey, I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: It's not what it looks like.",
        "Margo: Oh, so that's not a condom?",
        "Celia: Thank you so much for lunch, but I should get home.",
        "Casey: Celia, wait.",
        "Margo: Wait, Casey. We're not finished here. Case -- this is not funny. Casey is much too young to be thinking about that. And so is she.",
        "Casey: Celia, wait. I can explain.",
        "Celia: I don't want to hear it. And I don't ever want to see you again.",
        "Casey: I can explain.",
        "Celia: I don't want to hear it. And I don't ever want to see you again.",

        "Henry: I could make more money mowing lawns.",
        "Craig: The grass is always greener, Henry.",
        "Henry: How is the brother-in-law?",
        "Craig: Not happy -- with you, or my sister.",
        "Henry: Well, how could you not be happy with us? We're such a fun couple.",
        "Craig: You lied to me, Henry. You and Katie.",
        "Henry: Lied to you?",
        "Craig: All right. You failed to disclose the fact that Jennifer is pregnant. And you know what hurts me, Henry, is you thought I didn't deserve to know.",
        "Henry: Jennifer is pregnant?",
        "Craig: Try to give it a rest, Henry.",
        "Henry: Wow, a baby. Well, Mike must be so happy. Can't you just see him down on the floor, playing airplane?",
        "Craig: And the reason you didn't tell me, Henry, is because you assumed I was the father. Why is why you and Katie were unusually weird the last time I was here? You didn't want me to know. Don't you think I deserve to be happy, huh?",
        "Henry: You know, just because you and Jennifer had a moment doesn't make the baby yours.",
        "Craig: No, you're right.",
        "Henry: I am? I'm right about what?",
        "Craig: The child isn't mine.",
        "Henry: You want to run that by me again?",
        "Craig: The baby is not mine.",
        "Henry: Yes! There is a God!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: So, are we really gonna do this? Are we gonna lie to Craig, and the rest of the world, about this baby?",
        "Mike: Are you having second thoughts?",
        "Jennifer: No. No. And, especially after Craig showing up on our doorstep, it all just proves that you're right. He cannot, under any circumstances, find out he's that the father of this baby, or we will never have a moment of peace again in our lives. So I -- I do have to lie to him. But you don't.",
        "Mike: No, I don't. But I want to do it for you. For us.",
        "Jennifer: I so appreciate you stepping up when Craig was here. And I know you love me. And I know you can't help yourself. You see a woman in distress, and you just have to save her.",
        "Mike: Hmm. Make I'm saving myself. No, I figure a life with a strong, creative, beautiful redhead, and her child, might just be heaven.",
        "Jennifer: Oh. That is the most romantic thing I think I've ever heard. And I know you mean it. But this is a big decision. It will change your life. You have to be so sure, Mike. Will you be able to give your heart to a child that's not yours? You've already been through this with Carly and Sage.",
        "Mike: No, no, no, no. That's not a fair comparison. Carly was in love with Jack. That's a completely different situation. I want to spend my life with you. And that means, if you want this child, then I guess we're having a baby.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Mike. Oh, you have no idea how much -- I wish I could just forget all of that and -- and say yes.",
        "Mike: Then do it. Say yes.",
        "Jennifer: But we're talking about years. We're talking about a lifetime of hiding the truth. And you are the most honest man that I know, and I don't want to change that about you. And telling Craig a little lie is probably not that big of a deal, but will you be able to lie to Katie, and Henry, and Carly and Jack?",
        "Mike: Whatever it takes.",
        "Jennifer: And this child? If it comes to it, will you be able to -- to look this child in the eye when she's 10, 12, 15, and lie to her -- or him? And even if you could, is that who you want to be?",
        "Mike: But it won't be a lie, not really. You know? Because I will be her father, or his father.",
        "Jennifer: And you will be the best father in the world, if we can pull it off.",
        "Mike: We can.",
        "Jennifer: I just -- I'm not so sure. Right now, Craig thinks I'm ten weeks pregnant. But what happens in a couple of months when I'm still not showing? Or the due date comes and goes? Craig's -- Craig's no fool. He'll figure it out. What do we do then?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I knew it. Jennifer's pregnant. Five weeks along. Oh, I wish this thing said who the father was.",
        "Doctor: Be right with you, Mrs. Woods. Katie.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Doctor: Aren't you gonna get changed?",
        "Katie: Oh, yes. Of course. I was just about to, when I got a call from my good friend Jennifer. Jennifer Munson. She's so excited about the pregnancy.",
        "Doctor: Oh, really? That's encouraging. I'm glad to hear it.",
        "Katie: I know that, of course, when you saw her, she was not quite used to the idea. You know, this being her first baby, and -- you know, the whole situation. It makes sense that she wouldn't be exactly overjoyed, given the circumstances. You must see this kind of thing all the time, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Can you see anything?",
        "Keith: I see light, coming from a window, or something.",
        "Lily: In the kitchen?",
        "Keith: Probably.",
        "Lily: So, I guess you're right. I guess Les could have climbed down the dumbwaiter, snuck out the window, and --",
        "Keith: Killed my sister.",
        "Lily: He comes back here to a locked room. He has a perfect alibi.",
        "Keith: How are we gonna prove this?",
        "Lily: Maybe he left fingerprints on the window.",
        "Keith: Wait a second.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Keith: Something -- there's something down there.",
        "Lily: What is it? [Keith grunts] Mr. Simms, I want to thank you again so much for allowing us in.",
        "Mr. Simms: Well, what's taking so long?",
        "Lily: Just gonna be another minute.",
        "Mr. Simms: Yeah, well, I just made a few calls. I think maybe I made a mistake here.",
        "Lily: About what?",
        "Mr. Simms: The people here -- technically, they're still incarcerated. The department of corrections does not want a newspaper in here, because they were nervous about a lawsuit. I think you're gonna have to leave. Now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'm not quite sure why you're here, Lester.",
        "Les: Well, I'm here for my boy. It's all here. We got a new judge to rule in my favor. J.J. is mine.",
        "Carly: We haven't been notified.",
        "Les: I'm notifying you right now. I'm notifying you. J.J., get your coat, son.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'm sorry. Until Jack gets back, and we speak with our lawyer, I really can't help you.",
        "Les: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Too late for that. You lost, woman. The boy's mine.",
        "[Carly screams]",
        "Carly: I'm asking you to leave.",
        "Les: Oh, I'm gonna leave. I'll leave right now, with my boy.",
        "Carly: He's not going anywhere with you.",
        "Les: Why do women always have to make things hard? I might have to teach you a lesson.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doctor: Katie, you -- you understand that I can't discuss Jennifer's situation with you.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. Yeah, right. I was just excited to hear from her, and then you walked in, so I thought I'd share the joy. 'Cause that is what it is. A baby, it's a wonderful thing. Assuming that that's what you want, you know. If the particulars are all what you want. And, um -- I guess timing is everything. And Jennifer has this huge job, and -- you know, with the father, and everything. So I was just happy to hear that -- that she wasn't as upset as she was when she was here.",
        "Doctor: I never said that she was upset, Katie. She was a little tense, maybe, but that's normal. You said it yourself. She's got a very demanding career. It makes sense that she'd want to pin down the due date.",
        "Katie: Due date.",
        "Doctor: And that's all I have to say on the subject. Now, if you'd like to get changed --",
        "Katie: Yeah, you know what? Actually, sorry. My fault. We've been talking so long that I've just realized -- I'm gonna have to get going. All right. I'll see you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Craig already suspects that we're lying to him. He's gonna be snooping around. When the baby's a month late, he'll do the math. And then what? We will be caught in the middle of a monumental custody battle.",
        "Mike: We won't let it get to that.",
        "Jennifer: How? How? Craig is relentless.",
        "Mike: I know. And he's suspicious. But we have the facts, and that gives us a huge advantage.",
        "Jennifer: How?",
        "Mike: 'Cause we can plan ahead. Now, look. There's -- there's a couple different ways we could play this out. But I think the simplest is -- is by leaving town.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you mean before I start to show?",
        "Mike: Well, it doesn't matter, as long as we're gone by the time the baby's born.",
        "Jennifer: And we say we're leaving, because --",
        "Mike: Street Jeans needs a new showroom. I've got a big construction job. The reason doesn't matter, but we leave. And we stay away till the baby's about four or five months old, you know? Old enough where a couple weeks won't make a difference. And then we come back -- or not. You know, if we find a place that we like, then we'll just -- we'll stay there. We'll start a new life.",
        "Jennifer: That's not a bad idea, except for one thing. We're not the only people who know the truth. And I think we can count on Dusty and Paul to keep our secret. But my mother is a whole another story.",
        "Mike: I told you, Jen. Lying was her idea.",
        "Jennifer: It's always her first impulse. Which makes her completely unreliable. You know what? She could -- she could just get angry at me, or you.",
        "Mike: Oh, and tell Craig the truth.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Or just act so guilty or upset that she tips him off. I mean, look what happened after she found out I was pregnant. Two seconds later, she's at the house with a baby gift. She's a loose cannon.",
        "Mike: All right. We need to take care of her right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: We're just gonna be here for a few more minutes, and then all that is left is your interview.",
        "Mr. Simms: My interview?",
        "Lily: Of course. You are the heart and soul of this whole program.",
        "Mr. Simms: Me?",
        "Lily: Yes. That's why Les gave his permission to run this story. He said, \"You have to talk to Simms.\" So, listen. As soon as my photographer is done with his pictures, we have to take several pictures of you.",
        "Mr. Simms: Of me?",
        "Lily: Of course. For the front page. Can't do a profile without a picture.",
        "Mr. Simms: Should I shave?",
        "Lily: That's a good idea.",
        "Mr. Simms: Won't take me but ten minutes.",
        "Lily: Take your time. Take your time. Don't worry about it. What did you find? A cell phone? How did Les get a cell phone?",
        "Keith: It's Julia's cell phone.",
        "Lily: That's where it went. He must have taken it from her. What is that on the phone?",
        "Keith: It's blood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Don't be a fool, Les. I'm married to a cop. You touch me, and they'll lock you up, and they'll throw away the key.",
        "Les: No, not when I tell them you tried to kidnap my son.",
        "Carly: No one is ever gonna believe that.",
        "Les: Excuse me. You don't have custody. I do. You deny me the right to my kid, that's against the law. I don't care who your husband is. So just get moving, here. Get his jacket. You don't want any trouble here.",
        "Carly: And you don't want to touch either one of us. Not unless you want to lose custody altogether. They won't even give you visitation.",
        "Les: Oh, that's if they find us, and they ain't gonna find us. J.J.?",
        "Carly: No! No! Run! J.J., Run! Run!",
        "Les: C'mon, son. Listen to me, okay.",
        "[Glass shattering]",
        "Carly: Run! J.J.! Call Jack, honey! Run!",
        "Les: That's the last time you get between me and what's mine.",
        "Carly: No! No!",
        "Les: Keep trying! Huh?",
        "Carly: No! No!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So when we got home, Casey just say we walked in on them --",
        "Margo: Making out on the couch.",
        "Tom: Oh, come on, they're teenagers. And we didn't want to make a huge deal out it. Especially since you guys were here.",
        "Margo: Except now that Casey's carrying condoms around in his wallet.",
        "Bob: I think it's very responsible of him.",
        "Margo: Responsible? Bob, he's only 16.",
        "Bob: And he's certainly old enough to be aware of the risks and taking the proper precautions.",
        "Margo: You want to help me out here?",
        "Tom: I kind of agree with him.",
        "Margo: No, no, Casey is too young to be having a sexual relationship.",
        "Kim: Oh, Margaret, come on, don't jump to conclusions. You know, sometimes these boys carry around these things whether they need them or not.",
        "Bob: You know, Kim's probably right. It might be just for show. But if isn't, at least he's carrying protection in case it's needed.",
        "Margo: Doesn't anybody understand what I'm saying here?",
        "Kim: Of course we do, we understand perfectly. We realize how difficult it is to watch your kids grow up.",
        "Margo: He is not grown up. He's not a child but he's definitely not emotionally ready to be having sex. And I think as responsible parents, we have to make sure that he understands that. Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: Do you have any idea how much you just embarrassed me? Your parents invite me to meet your grandparents --",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. But how was I supposed to know that my mom was gonna grab my wallet and throw it across the room?",
        "Celia: Why did you even have that thing? We weren't going to -- to need it. And if you think that you can talk me into --",
        "Casey: No, of course not. Don't worry, it wasn't even for you.",
        "Celia: Then who was it for?",
        "Casey: Nobody. It's not even mine --",
        "Celia: Casey, my brother was right. I should have never trusted you.",
        "Casey: Celia, wait! Let me drive you home!",
        "Tom: Hey, hold on, buddy.",
        "Casey: I've gotta catch up with Celia.",
        "Tom: No, no. Not until we talk. Okay?",
        "Casey: You don't understand.",
        "Margo: You're not listening! You're not going anywhere!",
        "Kim: Um, we are going. Casey, it was wonderful, darling, to meet your young lady. She's a darling girl. Thank you very much.",
        "Bob: Hey, listen, buck up. As problems go, that's not a bad one.",
        "Margo: Oh.",
        "Bob: Thanks for everything. I hope we can do this soon again. Huh?",
        "Kim: See you later.",
        "Bob: I'll wait in the car.",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Casey: I have to explain things to Celia.",
        "Margo: No, you have to explain things to us.",
        "Casey: That can wait.",
        "Tom: You know what? Not now, you can catch up with Celia later. Right now, your mom and I need to talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: We didn't know anything for sure.",
        "Craig: You knew Jennifer and I --",
        "Henry: Look, I've done the wild thing. Craig, if for every time I took a girl around the park, I had to buy a stroller, I'd really be broke.",
        "Craig: Your sensitivity is touching.",
        "Henry: Oh, you know, did you deserve to know? No. Because the baby isn't yours. And if by some miracle of timing, it was, it is still up to Jennifer to tell you.",
        "Craig: Do I smell morality here, Henry? Since when do you do the far, far better thing?",
        "Henry: I resent that, Craig. I skipped town so Mike could have a shot with Katie.",
        "Craig: Oh, maybe once in your life --",
        "Henry: And I'm a changed man for it.",
        "Craig: The only reason you didn't tell me is because you were afraid it was true.",
        "Henry: Yeah, you're right. I was very afraid. You're a decent brother-in-law, Craig. But you're no prize as a father. I had to think of the baby.",
        "Craig: You don't care about that baby. You just don't want Mike and Jennifer to break up. Because if they do, then Mike would want Katie back and your marriage would be over before faster than you could say \"better man.\"",
        "Henry: I take it back. You're not a decent brother-in-law.",
        "Craig: Well, where's your loyalty, Henry?",
        "Henry: What? Where is yours? Katie's happy.",
        "Craig: Oh, okay, you keep telling yourself that little fairy tale. Because deep down, inside, you know she is still in love with Mike. And Mike is in love with her. And Jennifer knows it. One reason she came to me.",
        "Henry: You think Jennifer wants you, Craig? Look around, okay? This town is littered with women who hate your guts. There is not a female from here to Chicago who wants anything to do with you. And Jennifer is no exception.",
        "Katie: Henry, guess what I just -- Craig.",
        "Craig: Yeah!",
        "Henry: Craig, he just stopped in to say that is not the father of Jennifer's child. Isn't that great news?",
        "Katie: Oh. Really?",
        "Henry: Yeah. He just talked to Jennifer and she confirmed it. It's Mike's baby.",
        "Craig: Yeah, so it seems.",
        "Henry: Now, if this isn't cause for celebration, I don't know what is. What do you say to some champagne? Hmm, anyone?",
        "Katie: Sure.",
        "Henry: Great, I'll be right back.",
        "Katie: This is why we didn't say anything when you were here before. We had no way of knowing --",
        "Craig: It doesn't matter.",
        "Katie: Are you relieved? You and Jennifer haven't exactly been getting along.",
        "Craig: Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, well that's good. I think most men would be relieved. But you know what? I would have loved to have had a chance at another child.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I don't know what you think I've done but I assure you that --",
        "Mike: How about it's because of you Craig knows Jennifer's pregnant.",
        "Barbara: No, no. I didn't say a word to him. He overheard a conversation that I was having --",
        "Jennifer: Oh, yes, you were talking with Paul.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I'm your mother. And you were talking about terminating this pregnancy. Oh, honey, don't tell me that you've done something foolish.",
        "Jennifer: I decided to keep the baby.",
        "Barbara: That's wonderful. You won't regret this decision, I promise you.",
        "Jennifer: And we have already told Craig that Mike is the father.",
        "Barbara: Well, that's wonderful. You decided to take my advice.",
        "Mike: I'm not doing this because of you.",
        "Barbara: No, you're not -- you're doing this for Jennifer.",
        "Mike: We're doing this together so we can be a family.",
        "Barbara: I couldn't be happier for you both.",
        "Jennifer: And, well, before you break out the champagne, you have to understand something. While we've told Craig that Mike is the father, he, of course, is still suspicious. So he's going to pursue this. Which means we have to be very careful.",
        "Barbara: Yes. Because he is an awful man and a worse father and there is no way he could ever find out that this child is his. I understand that. I'll have a conversation with Paul.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not worried about Paul. I'm worried about you.",
        "Barbara: Me? But this is what I wanted for you. I wanted you and Mike and your child to live happily ever after. I would never do anything to jeopardize this child's future. You have my word, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: Your word is worth nothing, Mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: It's definitely hers?",
        "Keith: Yeah, J.J. programmed \"I love you\" whenever she opened it. Sweeney killed my sister.",
        "Lily: He must've taken it from her when she was on the phone with her the pharmacist.",
        "Keith: He beat her to death.",
        "Lily: He couldn't leave the phone in the apartment, there's blood all over it. So he took it with him.",

        "Lily: I have to call the cops. They have to know about this.",
        "Keith: No, we're not calling the cops. What are we going to say to them? How we dialogued our way in here without a search warrant? How I've got my fingerprints now all over the phone?",
        "Lily: I will talk to them. I will tell them.",
        "Keith: So what? What are we gonna get? A lecture? Sweeney walks. That's not going to happen. I mean, do you want that?",

        "Lily: Oh, Jack. He's not here. He's out of town.",

        "Carly: Yes, he is.",
        "J.J.: He used to get mad at my mom and hit her. I couldn't let him do that to you. You won't let him take me away?",

        "Kim: Really. After you've seen as many children and grandchildren grow up as I have, you are not to make any assumptions at all until all of the facts are in.",
        "Celia: If my mom had been there, she would be so mad at me and embarrassed. We never talk about things like--",
        "Kim: Like sex? Well, you know something? I can understand your mother's feelings and then her concern for your welfare. But it's really too bad. I think family should talk about things like this because, otherwise, it's difficult to avoid misunderstanding.",
        "Celia: And that's what this is. A total misunderstanding. Believe me, I would never ever do anything like that.",
        "Kim: Good, good. It's important to know what you're comfortable with and what you're-the-not ready for. You have to talk to your partner about that and be responsible. Which actually is the reason I think I'm not so concerned about this. Because I know my grandson and I know he is a very caring young man and I believe he would honor your feelings.",
        "Celia: Then why did he have that thing in his wallet? He never talked about ever needing anything like that.",
        "Kim: I don't know. I don't know. But you have to ask him that. And listen to his answer. I mean, who knows, maybe they're handing condoms out in the health class. Or maybe he's just curious, so I bought one, you know? For all their big talk, boys are just as uneasy about sex as girls, so don't make any assumptions until have you a talk.",
        "Celia: I just want to go home.",
        "Kim: Okay. We'll drop you off. Unless you want to join us. Bob and I were going to have a latte. Do you want to come along? We can talk about your school and your singing.",

        "Casey: The condom is not even mine. I had it in my hand when Celia came in and I stuffed it in my wallet so I wouldn't embarrass Celia. Then you grabbed my wallet, which I told you not to, and you embarrassed everyone in the room.",

        "Barbara: Sweetheart, why would I do anything to hurt you or this baby? I was the one begging you to save its life. All I want to do is to help you through a difficult time.",

And besides, it just feels right to me. If we're gonna have a child, we should be married. But if it's too much too soon --",
        "Jennifer: No, I just never expected -- I mean, all of it's too much too soon. But it's also wonderful. And yes, if you're going to be the father of this baby, I want to be your wife. Because I love you and -- and if all this works, we could actually be happy.",

        "Katie: No. I didn't even know for sure that she was pregnant until today.",

        "Katie: If Jennifer told you that you're not the father, then you're not the father.",
