        "Sofie: Hey.",
        "Paul: Hey. Sofie, what are you doing here?",
        "Sofie: I came to take your mom to the hospital for her radiation treatment. It's not canceled, is it?",
        "Paul: No. Oh, I totally lost track of time.",
        "Sofie: You okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm just trying to -- I'm trying to sort something out.",
        "Sofie: \"How to be a rock star in bed\"?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I already figured that out.",
        "Sofie: Then what's the problem?",
        "Paul: It's Meg. You know, every time I feel like I'm getting somewhere with her, I just -- I need something that's going to seal the deal.",
        "Sofie: Okay, and by \"Seal the deal\" you mean --",
        "Paul: I mean I need to think of something that is so spectacular, so romantic that it just -- it sweeps her off her feet. You know, I need to somehow make myself irresistible. And so far all I can come up with is jewelry and a foot rub and a Jacuzzi in the shape of a champagne glass.",
        "Sofie: Not one of those lodges with the heart-shaped beds? I'm really shocked.",
        "Paul: Okay, Sofie, hypothetically speaking, what would it take for you to fall head-over-heels in love with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Meg: Hey, Mike.",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Meg: Come on in.",
        "Mike: I don't want to track mud everywhere.",
        "Meg: It's a farm. We're used to it. Besides, Mama's out of town, so you're safe. Do you want some coffee?",
        "Mike: No time. I have a meeting with some surveyors out in the back field. Do you mind if I leave this stuff here so it doesn't get mud all over it?",
        "Meg: Sure. Door's always open.",
        "Mike: Appreciate it.",
        "Meg: So, how's the project going? Mike? Hey?",
        "Mike: Sorry, what?",
        "Meg: You okay?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm good. You know, just work.",
        "Meg: You know, I heard about Brad and Katie getting married. I don't mean to make any assumptions, but I'm sure it was a little rough for you.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm trying to be happy for her, but --",
        "Meg: Not working too well?",
        "Mike: It's just hard to believe that it's really over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What's the most romantic thing you've ever heard of?",
        "Sofie: It's kind of out there.",
        "Paul: Well, I'm looking for kind of out there.",
        "Sofie: Okay. Okay. Well, I've always had this dream of taking off in a hot air balloon with a bottle of champagne and the guy I'm in love with, just watching the sun set over the entire sky. Totally alone. Up above the earth. Doesn't that sound like what heaven must feel like?",
        "Paul: You're very clever. I do \"Balloon rental.\"",
        "Sofie: Hot air balloon.",
        "Paul: Oh, you're right. I don't want to end up with some $40-an-hour clown twisting up balloons into a dachshund.",
        "Barbara: Hey, Sofie, I didn't realize you were here already.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry, we got caught up.",
        "Barbara: Oh, well, if you're busy, I can go by myself.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. We're going to take you.",
        "Barbara: I don't need a fleet of chaperones. It's a routine treatment. I'm used to it by now.",
        "Sofie: No, it's not routine. I mean, not for Paul. He wants to take care of you. And, you know, it makes me feel good to be able to help.",
        "Barbara: You don't have to make a production out of it, though.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Mom. You of all people know that that's just the Ryan way. I got a number, we'll call from the hospital. You saved my life. Thanks to you, I'm going to look like a genius. Come on.",
        "Barbara: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Try to keep it a little off-center. It makes it more interesting visually.",
        "Casey: Okay, okay. Just point it where you want it, Luke. You know, I just want to hit a button and let things roll.",
        "Luke: Okay. All right. And we're going to pan later, so try not to bump it, okay?",
        "Casey: Whatever.",
        "Luke: All right. So, this is the first scene of the movie. You guys are a young married couple.",
        "Noah: I think we can do that.",
        "Luke: Yeah. You're in love. All right. So, Noah, you're going to carry Ameera across the threshold. And it's kind of like -- like you're bringing her into your new life. I know it sounds really cheesy, but --",
        "Noah: No, no, no. That's -- that's good. That could look good.",
        "Ameera: Is that really a custom?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Ameera: Why?",
        "Luke: I don't know.",
        "Noah: Yeah, it's just something people do. I never really thought about it. Are you okay with that?",
        "Ameera: Yeah, why not?",
        "Luke: So, you guys ready?",
        "Ameera: Will you show me how?",
        "Noah: Okay, come on. Put your -- put your arm around my neck.",
        "Ameera: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Oh, a little more. Whoa. That's enough.",
        "Alison: It's more cream than coffee.",
        "Chris: Yeah, it doubles as dessert.",
        "Alison: That's gross.",
        "Emily: Alison, I need to talk to you. Alison, I'm speaking to you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Welcome home.",
        "Ameera: Home. That sounds wonderful.",
        "Noah: Yeah. To me, too.",
        "Luke: Cut.",
        "Noah: Was that no good?",
        "Casey: Looked great to me, Man.",
        "Luke: It wasn't really convincing, but that's okay. That's okay.",
        "Ameera: Well, can we do it again?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, sure. If you want to.",
        "Ameera: I hope I'm not too heavy.",
        "Noah: Oh, please. Big strong guy.",
        "Luke: Okay, uh -- action.",
        "Noah: Welcome home.",
        "Luke: Cut.",
        "Ameera: Was I more convincing?",
        "Luke: Yeah, if you want to throw away the entire script.",
        "Noah: Sorry, I forgot my line.",
        "Luke: It's okay. We can get it in post.",
        "Casey: Maybe not. I don't think I got it. The switch was stuck or something. My bad.",
        "Ameera: We could do another take.",
        "Luke: No. You know what? That's okay. It's okay. It's getting kind of late. Why don't we just get some lunch, and we can come back to this tomorrow.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You all right?",
        "Alison: No, Emily doesn't bother me.",
        "Chris: You did a really impressive job of ignoring her.",
        "Alison: It was easy. I'm not interested in anything my sister has to say to me right now.",
        "[Beeper ringing]",
        "Chris: The lab. I'm going to use the phone in there. See you later?",
        "Alison: Okay. Bye. Oh, Ms. Ryan, are you ready for your radiation treatment?",
        "Barbara: You can just sign me in. I know my way around, Alison.",
        "Alison: I know, I know, but it's my job to escort you to radiology. And you don't want me to get in trouble with my boss, now do you? Do you want a wheelchair?",
        "Barbara: Don't be ridiculous. I can walk just fine.",
        "Paul: Mom, she's just doing her job. Stop.",
        "Alison: Don't worry about it. You ready?",
        "Paul: Hi, is this up, up and away inc.? I'd like a balloon ride, please. For today. You can? Great. This afternoon, then. And, I'm going to need like whatever you got, you know? Champagne picnic and roses, anything. No, no, I don't -- stop. I don't care what it costs. Just -- I need you there this afternoon at the Snyder farm. It's the one on the road to Luther's Corners there. Great. Great, I'm so glad we can make this work. This is going to be perfect.",
        "Sofie: Meg is so lucky.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I'm not stupid. I know Katie's a beautiful, independent woman. I didn't think I could just walk back into town and have our lives go back to the way they were, but we never really finished things.",
        "Meg: You divorced her. That's pretty final.",
        "Mike: I did it sight unseen. I did it because I was angry, and my pride was hurt. But I thought that maybe we had a chance to try it again. I assumed we did. That was my mistake.",
        "Meg: You took too long to come around, Mike. I hate to say it.",
        "Mike: I figured that out for myself. I had plenty of time to think about that when I was watching her say \"I do\" to another guy.",
        "Meg: It's not easy, is it? Trying to move on with your life when you have so much unfinished business. You know, it's hard to let a new person into your life when the old one is taking up so much space.",
        "Mike: You and Paul?",
        "Meg: Yeah, but I think we have a chance. I think we do. I'm sorry you and Katie don't get that.",
        "Mike: There's only one reason for that. I blew it. I let her get away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Paul, your mom wants to see you.",
        "Sofie: I'll wait here.",
        "Paul: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Emily: Alison.",
        "Alison: Not now, Emily. I'm working.",
        "Emily: Ali! Just who I was looking for.",
        "Chris: What are you doing here, Emily?",
        "Emily: I came to talk to my sister. But thanks to you, she won't speak to me.",
        "Chris: Don't put this on me. Your problems with Ali came way before I did.",
        "Emily: And your playing musical sisters has absolutely nothing to do with it?",
        "Chris: You know what? I don't have time for your drama, Emily. If you want to know why Alison isn't speaking to you, just look in the mirror. And if you will excuse me, I actually see someone who I enjoy spending time with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Sorry to run off like that, I'm babysitting today.",
        "Mike: That's fine. I know you're great with him. He's lucky to have you in his life. Oh, yeah, I'm going to get back down to the field.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Mike: It's just that Katie and I were thinking about having a kid, and every time I see one, I -- I think about her. I think maybe we'd had a little more luck, things would have worked out.",
        "Meg: Well, you still could have kids one day, if that's what you really want.",
        "Mike: Thanks for saying that, but we both know there's no guarantees in that department. I'll be back for my stuff later.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Okay. Mealtime. Mommy left some carrots. Great. [Telephone rings] Hello? No, Mike is actually in the back field. I don't think he'll be able to get cell reception back there. Is it important? Okay. Okay. I'll make sure he gets that message as soon as I can give it to him.",
        "Aaron: Hi, Meg.",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Aaron: How you doing?",
        "Meg: Good.",
        "Aaron: Listen, are you up to feeding Ethan? He's very hungry.",
        "Aaron: Depends on what's for lunch.",
        "Meg: Carrots.",
        "Aaron: I'm in.",
        "Meg: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Take your time. I don't have any plans today, so --",
        "Meg: Thank you. You're a rock star.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I haven't seen you since Gwen and Will left town. How you doing?",
        "Sofie: I'm okay. It's weird not being able to see Hallie. Before I was looking around every corner for her, so this is a lot better.",
        "Chris: No regrets?",
        "Sofie: Tons. Tons. But I made the right decision. So I'm trying to shift my focus, think about other people, not myself so much. I've been helping Barbara. She's here for radiation. And Aaron's been coming around, so that's -- that's good. He's good to talk to.",
        "Chris: Yeah, that's important. Have people you trust around when you're down.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I've seen you and Alison hanging out. That's a good thing, right?",
        "Chris: Definitely. Yeah, she's fun to hang with. We've got a history.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, Aaron told me.",
        "Chris: Maybe we should all get together for dinner some time. Be normal for a change.",
        "Sofie: That's a great idea, Chris. Except Alison hates me, and she and Aaron -- it's awkward.",
        "Chris: No, it's not like it'd be one-on-one. Safety in numbers. And maybe we could figure out a way to start over. Be friends again. I think the four of us could use all the friends we can get.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: We're going to order some food at the counter.",
        "Casey: You look really beautiful on camera. You know, you should think about being an actress or something.",
        "Ameera: That wouldn't be a good life.",
        "Casey: Yeah, yeah, being rich and famous. You know, fancy cars, nice clothes, going to all those parties -- yeah, that would really suck. You're in love with Noah, aren't you?",
        "Ameera: Don't say things like that. Noah isn't into women. He loves Luke.",
        "Casey: It doesn't matter who Noah's into. You're into him. Which is a huge waste of time.",
        "Ameera: I don't really want to talk about it.",
        "Casey: I won't, but you got to be real about those two. I don't -- you're a nice girl, I don't want you to get hurt.",
        "Ameera: I can take care of myself.",
        "Casey: Come on, Ameera. You know, you're smart and all, but you got to admit to yourself that you haven't been living on your own for a while, you know? Being innocent -- that's a good thing, but I actually think that makes you really awesome. Not going to happen, that's all I'm trying to say.",
        "Ameera: I know that Noah loves Luke, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm married to him. I'm his wife.",
        "Casey: No doubt. But he's into guys, and that's not going to change because of some piece of paper, you know? No offense, but if you have ideas that you're going to turn Noah straight, that's not how it works. No matter how much you want it to.",
        "Ameera: You should mind your own business, Casey.",
        "Noah: Is something wrong?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: If Alison and I can learn to be friends again, anything's possible. Besides, I like spending time with you, and Aaron's a good guy. Its one dinner, how bad can it be?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, you're kidding, right?",
        "Chris: Well, we could always throw food at each other and storm out. Sometimes a good food fight is just what the doctor ordered. And I am the doctor, so --",
        "Sofie: Okay, okay, okay. I will ask Aaron, and if he says yes, then we can have dinner. Assuming that Alison does not bite your head off when you ask her.",
        "Chris: I'm not afraid of Alison. Much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Paul: You look like you could kill somebody. Oh, that's right. You could kill somebody.",
        "Emily: You know what? You're not funny.",
        "[Emily sighs]",
        "Paul: You're jealous of Dr. Killjoy?",
        "Emily: He is constantly coming on to my sister. And the second she's out of sight, he's all over little miss what's-her-name.",
        "Paul: Sofie. Her name is Sofie. She's a nice girl.",
        "Emily: Well, good for her. You know what? She deserves better than him. And so does my sister. Way better.",
        "Paul: All of a sudden, you're a guardian angel?",
        "Emily: She's too trusting of him, my sister. She's -- she doesn't realize what a jerk he is. I just got a figure out a way to break them up before she gets hurt.",
        "Paul: No, no. You shouldn't get mixed up in people's relationships. You can hardly manage one yourself.",
        "Emily: Well, aren't you a fine one to talk?",
        "Paul: I'm turning over a new leaf.",
        "Emily: It'll wear off. Trust me.",
        "Paul: Wow. Could you put the broomstick in storage for like a day?",
        "Emily: Don't tell me where to put my broomstick!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mike! Hey!",
        "Mike: Hey, be careful, the ground's really uneven out here.",
        "Meg: I grew up out here, remember? Look, you got a message. They said it was an emergency. They called the home line.",
        "Mike: Yeah, it always is. As if today wasn't annoying enough already.",
        "Balloon guy: Hey, you must be the folks that ordered the balloon.",
        "Mike: Um --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Paul, hey, is your mom okay?",
        "Paul: Yeah, she's an old pro at this by now. But she does need some rest, and the technician asked if we could stick around. I hope that's not a problem?",
        "Sofie: No. No, Chris just asked me and Aaron out to dinner, but if you need help with your mom, I --",
        "Paul: No, no, no. I'll get her home. And there's a nurse to take care of her when she's there. Why don't you go? Go have some fun.",
        "Chris: I agree. So we're on?",
        "Sofie: If Alison and Aaron say yes.",
        "Chris: See you later.",
        "Sofie: Okay. Okay, but if Barbara needs anything, tell her to call me. All right?",
        "Paul: Okay. I have an appointment, so how long does my mom have to stick around here?",
        "Chris: They like to keep the patient around for a few minutes after treatment, just to make sure they're stable, but if you'd like to speak with the technician, its fine with --",
        "Alison: Chris, its Barbara. She's having some kind of reaction.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Balloon guy: Boss said to deliver a balloon to the Snyder farm.",
        "Meg: I think we'd know if we ordered a hot air balloon.",
        "Mike: Yeah. You didn't get a name?",
        "Balloon guy: I'll have to call the office.",
        "Meg: Well, that won't work out here. It's a dead zone.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm sorry to break it to you, Buddy, but no one out here ordered a hot air balloon. We're trying to get this entire area surveyed by the end of the week.",
        "Balloon guy: If this is some kind of practical joke --",
        "Mike: Wait a minute. If the ride's already paid for, since no one else is out here, why don't we take it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry to cause so much trouble.",
        "Paul: Mom, Mom, it's not your fault.",
        "Barbara: I don't know what happened, I just got so dizzy.",
        "Chris: You're dehydrated. With all the stress your body's been under, your system just shut down.",
        "Paul: I told you that you were doing too much. You're exhausted.",
        "Barbara: I'd argue with you, but I can't.",
        "Paul: You're not -- good. Good, you're too tired. I'm glad to hear you finally admit it.",
        "Chris: I'd like to keep you overnight, just to get your fluids up.",
        "Barbara: Oh, no.",
        "Paul: Hey, doctor's orders. She's staying. That's the end of her argument.",
        "Chris: You'll be okay. I promise. Just press the call button if you need anything.",
        "Barbara: Thanks, Chris. Thanks for staying.",
        "Paul: Yeah, no problem. I'm just glad you're okay.",
        "Barbara: I'm just so tired.",
        "Paul: Well, it's good you're here. You can rest as much as you want.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, well, that's not going to be much of a problem. Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Honey.",
        "Paul: You sure? 'Cause there is something I really want to do right now, but only if you promise that it's okay.",
        "Barbara: I'm not going anywhere. You do what you have to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Balloon guy: Ride's paid for. So someone might as well take advantage.",
        "Meg: Oh, well, I left Ethan with Aaron. He said he doesn't have plans, but still --",
        "Mike: Well, we don't have to go up for long. Come on, we could both use the adventure, don't you think?",
        "Meg: Well, I guess it is a little hard to be depressed looking at a hot air balloon.",
        "Mike: That's exactly what I'm talking about. So why don't we double our pleasure? Don't make me have all that fun all by myself. Come on. When is the next time you're going to be able to take a balloon ride in your own backyard?",
        "Meg: Okay, you're on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Quick thinking with you really got a knack for this kind of work.",
        "Alison: She passed out, Chris. It didn't take a genius.",
        "Chris: You really don't know how to take a compliment, do you?",
        "Alison: Yeah, so?",
        "Chris: Just saying. You on duty or pulling double shift?",
        "Alison: No, I am done. And I am starving.",
        "Chris: Good. Good, then let me take you out to dinner.",
        "Alison: Yeah? I'd love to.",
        "Chris: Yeah, with me, Aaron and Sofie.",
        "Alison: What? No way.",
        "Chris: Come on, Ali. It's a small town. You're going to run into them everywhere.",
        "Alison: And I am a champion ignorer. You just said so yourself.",
        "Chris: Well, wouldn't it be easier just to let it go?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Chris: I like Sofie. You and Aaron --",
        "Alison: Are so over.",
        "Chris: Then prove it. There's no reason we can't all be friends.",
        "Alison: I don't need a reason. I just don't want to. It feels weird.",
        "Chris: What would make it feel right?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Chris: How about a new dress? Something unbelievably hot, so Aaron knows exactly what he's missing. So he eats his heart out, suffers, tortures himself over what he let slip out of his grasp forever.",
        "Alison: So, you think you can appeal to my vanity? All right. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Assistant: Here are the transcripts from the debates.",
        "Emily: I asked you for those hours ago. Honestly, why do I bother paying you when I can do everything faster myself? No, I'm asking you a question. Instead of standing there looking stupid, could you bother answering it for me?",
        "Assistant: There. Whatever's bugging you today, it's got nothing to do with me. I quit.",
        "Emily: Good! Get out!",
        "Assistant: Already gone.",
        "Emily: Ugh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Hi.",
        "Sofie: Hi. Bad time?",
        "Aaron: No, no. Come on in. I'm just taking over for Meg in the babysitting department.",
        "Sofie: Oh. Well, I came by to ask if you wanted to have dinner with me tonight.",
        "Aaron: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I have to wait for somebody to come back to take care of Ethan.",
        "Sofie: Okay, well, maybe I'll wait with you. If that's okay.",
        "Aaron: Sofie, you don't have to. I know it's tough for you to be around babies right now. I already made the mistake of pushing you last time, I feel really bad about it, and I'm sorry.",
        "Sofie: No, don't be. Please, I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. It's not your fault. I hope I can make it up to you. Could I maybe help you baby-sit?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: Oh, no, nothing's wrong. I just get nervous being out in public. You never know who might be watching. It could be the I.C.E.",
        "Noah: So what if somebody's watching? We look like a normal, happy couple, right?",
        "Casey: Dude, what the hell, Man?",
        "Luke: Oh, come on, Casey, we've got to make it look real.",
        "Casey: No, we don't. I'm done. You know, I am not a cameraman, I'm not gay, and I'm not playing this stupid game anymore.",
        "Noah: Will you keep your voice down? You could blow the whole thing.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, excuse me if I don't want the entire town thinking I'm gay. I have to live here, too. I'm just saying I think this is stupid and pointless, and you're going to get caught.",
        "Luke: Why are you blowing up at us, Man?",
        "Casey: I'm uncomfortable. For a lot of reasons.",
        "Luke: Is this about the gay thing? Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to push it.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Luke: Look, you don't really think I'm coming onto you, right?",
        "Casey: No, no. You're all about Noah, and it's the same for you.",
        "Ameera: You should really keep your voice down, Casey.",
        "Casey: No one heard. But do you hear yourself? Honestly, look how scared you are. How long do you think you guys are going to live like this? How long do the three of you think you're going to pull this off?",
        "Noah: We've been doing okay so far.",
        "Casey: Living a lie is hell. I did it way too long with my family. After a while you have no life because everything is fake, and I don't want to get into that again. It's not worth it.",
        "Noah: It's not going to be for too long.",
        "Casey: It already is too long.",
        "Noah: Please. You have to help Ameera. Okay, if this doesn't work, she could get sent back. She'd be all alone. Isn't that worth it?",
        "Casey: Why don't we ask Ameera what to do. Well? Do you want me to stay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: He's getting so big. Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for letting me feed him and hold him. Hey, so did I mention that dinner tonight is with Chris and Alison?",
        "Aaron: No. Whose idea was this?",
        "Sofie: Chris'.",
        "Aaron: What does he want?",
        "Sofie: I think he wants to be friends.",
        "Aaron: Chris? Okay, well, I doubt that. The guy always has an agenda.",
        "Sofie: What could he possibly get from you and me?",
        "Aaron: Probably nothing. I just don't trust the guy. It's always about Chris, which is only interesting to Chris. I have no idea why Alison even likes to spend time with him.",
        "Sofie: She's probably thinking the same thing about you and me.",
        "Aaron: But Alison and I aren't getting back together.",
        "Sofie: And you're cool with that?",
        "Aaron: Yeah. I mean, it didn't work out. It happens.",
        "Sofie: But you still care about her.",
        "Aaron: Of course. I always will. But you can't stand her, so why would you even put yourself through a whole evening with her?",
        "Sofie: Maybe because I haven't been fair to her. I wasn't a big fan of Alison's because she took Gwen and Will's side, but now that Hallie's gone, I know it wasn't her fault. I know she was just being a good friend. And you know what? I could use some of those right now. So, I'm willing to give it a shot. It's only one night.",
        "Aaron: All right. All right. We'll have dinner. But I'm only doing this for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: This would look great on you.",
        "Alison: Oh, that is so gorgeous.",
        "Chris: No checking the price. This is a bribe to get you to go to dinner with me.",
        "Alison: I don't know, Chris.",
        "Chris: Try it on, Ali.",
        "Alison: You know, this whole appealing-to-my-vanity thing is getting to be a habit. But it does have its up-side.",
        "Chris: Well, I've got another one, if that one doesn't work.",
        "Emily: Ohh, great.",
        "Alison: Okay, what do you think?",
        "Emily: Alison? He's buying you clothes now? What are you doing for him?",
        "Alison: How dare you?",
        "Emily: Dress looks awfully expensive.",
        "Chris: You are way out of line, Emily.",
        "Emily: Really? I'm beginning to wonder. .",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: If you want to go, you should go.",
        "Casey: Thanks.",
        "Luke: Casey, wait.",
        "Casey: I quit you, Luke. Was that convincing enough? If the I.C.E. are watching?",
        "Luke: Look, this isn't about the gay thing. You have feelings for Ameera. That's why you're so upset.",
        "Casey: Did she tell you that?",
        "Luke: No, but it's obvious. But Casey, Ameera's from a different culture --",
        "Casey: Oh, don't talk to me like I'm stupid.",
        "Luke: Casey, stop being oversensitive. Ameera's smart, she's beautiful --",
        "Casey: And in love with her gay husband, who happens to be your boyfriend.",
        "Luke: No, no. When you save someone's life, you know, they're indebted to you. They have these feelings. But that goes away. She knows the deal.",
        "Casey: You think?",
        "Luke: Yeah. And if you walk away now, there's no chance. But if you stay --",
        "Casey: Sparks could fly?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah. Ameera really likes you, Casey. I could see something working out between you two.",

        "Paul: Hey, Sofie. What are you doing?",
        "Sofie: Hi. I'm babysitting for Ethan. He's really sweet.",
        "Aaron: And Ethan's in love.",
        "Paul: Hey, have you seen Meg?",
        "Aaron: She went out to the back field.",
        "Paul: Really, why?",
        "Aaron: She didn't say.",
        "Sofie: I hope the surprise isn't ruined.",
        "Paul: Yeah, so do I. [Cell phone rings] I guess she left her cell phone here.",
        "Aaron: There's no service out there.",
        "Paul: I gotta go see if I can head her off.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I don't know. Do you really think we should be doing this?",
        "Mike: You heard the guy. He's going to pack it up and take it away if we don't take it.",
        "Meg: It would be a waste of a beautiful thing.",
        "Mike: That is exactly what I'm talking about. You know how I'm all about conservation. After you.",
        "Balloon guy: Hop aboard.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "[Meg laughing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Wake up, Luke! Ameera's not interested in me. If she was, she would have asked me to stay, but she didn't.",
        "Luke: No, she's -- she's shy.",
        "Casey: She's obviously gotten over it.",
        "Luke: No, it's easy for her to talk to Noah because he's safe --",
        "Casey: She's not interested in me, Dude. She's after your boyfriend.",
        "Luke: No. No, no, no, no. She gets the deal.",
        "Casey: Whatever you say, man. I'm late for work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Salesgirl: Are you going to take the dress?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Chris: Yes, yes. It looked beautiful on you.",
        "Alison: I don't want it, Chris.",
        "Chris: Why, because of Emily? I thought you weren't going to let her get to you.",
        "Alison: I can't help it. She knows exactly what to say to make me feel cheap.",
        "Chris: That's Emily's baggage, not yours. Don't let her bring you down, Ali. You deserve way better.",
        "Alison: Not really.",
        "Chris: Yes! No matter what happened in your past, you came out of it a better, stronger person. You turned your life around.",
        "Alison: Do you really see me that way?",
        "Chris: Absolutely. And so does Emily. That's why she feels so threatened. The only person who doesn't see you that way is you. I'm buying you that dress, Ali.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Chris: Yes, and I don't want anything in return. You've been a good friend. You've been great at the hospital, picking up everyone's slack. Doesn't that deserve something nice? So just wear the dress to dinner tonight, have a good time. That would make me so happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: Oh, you're late, Hughes.",
        "Casey: I'll make it up to you at the end of my shift.",
        "Manager: No, you won't. You're fired.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. You can dock my pay if you want.",
        "Manager: You've been warned twice already. Three strikes, you're out. No more chances.",
        "Casey: Damn it!",
        "Emily: Casey, I need a drink.",
        "Casey: I don't work here.",
        "Emily: Well, then why are you wearing that stupid shirt? What? What's your problem?",
        "Casey: Do you really want to know?",
        "Emily: Sure, why not?",
        "Casey: The girl I like rejected me for a gay guy, then I show up five minutes late to work, and my manager fires me.",
        "Emily: Oh, please. Big deal. I'm rejected by everybody in this entire town, including my own lousy assistant, who the only reason I hired is because I felt sorry for him. So could you please get me a drink?",
        "Casey: Here. Knock yourself out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: I'll get some plates for this.",
        "Noah: It's a bummer about Casey dropping out.",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Noah: You can operate that better than him though, right? He could barely find the on/off switch.",
        "Luke: He was doing us a favor, Noah. He's never done this before.",
        "Noah: I know. I mean, he even seemed into it, too, until -- it was weird. I mean, I still can't figure out why he decided to fly off the handle at us.",
        "Luke: Really? Because I have a pretty good idea why.",
        "Noah: Will you care to share?",
        "Luke: He likes Ameera, and she's getting a little too much into this whole husband and wife thing.",
        "Noah: She's just acting. We all are.",
        "Luke: She kissed you, Noah. Was that in the script? No. She did that because she wanted to.",
        "Noah: So she wouldn't get deported.",
        "Luke: Look, is the I.C.E. in this house, huh? Is it? No. If she had any issues with her character, she could have asked.",
        "Noah: Yeah, and we would have said no.",
        "Luke: Exactly. That's my point. I get that you don't want to see it. I didn't want to see it either, but Casey opened my eyes. She is way too dependent on you.",
        "Noah: She's just scared.",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, how much do you even know about this girl?",
        "Noah: Look, it doesn't matter, even if Casey is right, I don't feel that way about her. I'm just doing this --",
        "Luke: Noah, we're both doing this. Every day you spend with her I lose.",
        "Noah: No. This is temporary. You've got to believe me, Luke. It doesn't matter what Ameera thinks or feels because I'm with you. I am. And she knows that. I'm in love with you.",

        "Aaron: Yep. I didn't think Meg was going to take this long.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, now that Paul's here, she's going to be gone the rest of the day.",
        "Aaron: Why?",
        "Sofie: He rented a hot air balloon. It was supposed to be a surprise. The company was going to set it up in the back field.",
        "Aaron: At the construction site?",
        "Sofie: I guess. You know, he had this whole thing planned. Champagne and roses, and then just floating away, untied to anything. I think it's the most romantic thing I've ever heard.",
        "Aaron: That's because you've never been on the back of a motorcycle before.",
        "Sofie: That sounds good, too. Maybe we should compare notes with Meg and Paul when they get back.",
