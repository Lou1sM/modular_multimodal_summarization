        "Paul: You really think this is worth another shot?",
        "Meg: Definitely. We keep the idea alive and eventually, it starts gnawing away at Craig, then he can't stand it anymore. And pretty soon, he's going to start wondering if he's didn't to pass up the best chance he had for finding Johnny.",
        "Paul: Well, he's not there yet. When I told him I knew where is kid was, he looked at me like I was delusional. Oh, his kid? And I hate thinking about Johnny as his kid.",
        "Meg: Okay, okay, okay, don't get hung up on that. What matters is what Craig thinks.",
        "Paul: Craig thinks that he won.",
        "Meg: He doesn't have Johnny. That's not a win.",
        "Paul: Okay, so, what do I do to make him think that I actually do know where Johnny is?",
        "Meg: Well, we have to believe that there's still a part of him that isn't sure. And we can make that work if you just stay calm.",
        "Paul: Right, so having a mental picture of strangling him -- that's counterproductive? I'm kidding. I am kind of.",
        "Meg: Look, the key to pulling this off is making it seem that you don't care. And I guarantee you he's going to come right back to you for another round. Look, I'd better get going. I don't want him to see me.",
        "Paul: Wish me luck.",
        "Meg: I do. And thank you. I know this isn't easy.",
        "Paul: You look at me like that, and anything is easy. I'll call you later.",
        "Craig: Any more hallucinations involving my son?",
        "Paul: You know when it happens, it's not really like a hallucination. It's much more clear.",
        "Craig: Oh, so then, there's no doubt in your mind that the child you saw was Johnny?",
        "Paul: Yeah, it was.",
        "Craig: Oh, know where he might be?",
        "Paul: Maybe.",
        "Craig: Ah, and what will it take to get you to share that information?",
        "Paul: Not much. I only have one condition.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Well, it sure looks like you're taking care of yourself.",
        "Jade: Well, somebody has to.",
        "Luke: Yeah, you got to look out for number one, right? So, what'd you get?",
        "Jade: Just some jeans. Nothing that would interest you.",
        "Luke: Oh, are you sure these are going to fit? They really don't look like your size.",
        "Jade: Why are you on my case? What, did I do something?",
        "Luke: Oh, no, actually, it's kind of like what you didn't do.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I really need somebody else on my back.",
        "Luke: Look, Jade, do you even think about anybody but yourself for like a second?",
        "Jade: What?",
        "Luke: While you were out shopping, my entire family is falling apart. Not that you give a damn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Yes, but as a board member, aren't you at all concerned that Montgomery took control of the company by misrepresenting his intentions? I mean, you've lived in this town a long time. You know as well as I do, that he's a man that can't be trusted. Uh, no. No, no, no. I put my daughter in charge of a subdivision. A sub -- uh, she signed that under duress. Merit, my friend, we've got a history, Darling. We have a history that should override any coup by anybody in the world, let alone Montgomery. So, why don't you call me when you get back to your senses. Damn, aargh!",
        "Bob: Lucinda?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, God!",
        "Bob: You're growling.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I am.",
        "Bob: That's not a good sign.",
        "Lucinda: No, it's not. Nothing is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Tell me what these are.",
        "Lily: What are you doing, Holden? You know exactly what they are.",
        "Holden: Come on, Lily. Say it. Own it. Call them what they are, diet pills. The pills you promised that you'd stop taking --",
        "Lily: I didn't even know that they were in my purse.",
        "Holden: These are diet pills. And for you, they are poison.",
        "Lily: Holden, please. Please. Please calm down. I didn't even that they were in there.",
        "Holden: No. No.",
        "Lily: Then toss them out. I don't even need those pills anymore.",
        "Holden: I don't believe you.",
        "Lily: The moment that I promised you that I would stop taking those pills, I went to every drawer in the house, and I got rid of them. Obviously, there was an oversight and I forgot one bottle that must have --",
        "Holden: Lily, stop! Just stop! Stop lying to me!",
        "Lily: I am not lying. I did stop taking them.",
        "Holden: But you carry them around anyway? For what? To test your resolve?",
        "Lily: No! As I was trying to tell you, obviously, it was an oversight. I didn't know the pills were in my purse.",
        "Holden: And every time you reached for your wallet or your cell phone, you didn't notice that they were in there? Let's see what else you have in here, shall we?",
        "Lily: That's not necessary. Stop! Stop! Please.",
        "Holden: What's this? A receipt from the pharmacy.",
        "Lily: Give it me!",
        "Holden: No. You bought these pills today.",
        "Lily: Don't make a big deal out of this. I -- I had stopped. Completely. And then I saw this display of the diet pills in the window and I knew that I would regret it the minute I did it. It was just an impulse. I didn't take any.",
        "Holden: If that's true, then why didn't you say that?",
        "Lily: Because I knew you'd make a big deal about me just buying the pills.",
        "Holden: Lily, you were in a coma for months. Don't you think I'm entitled to have this sort of reaction?",
        "Lily: Of course you are.",
        "Holden: We almost lost you. And I promised myself that if you ever came back to us, I would never let you leave us again.",
        "Lily: I haven't left anyone.",
        "Holden: I told Natalie and Faith that you were going to get well because the thing that you wanted most in this world was to be around, to watch them grow up. But for months -- for months, you have risked that.",
        "Lily: No. Please. Please. I feel guilty enough as it is.",
        "Holden: Not guilty enough to stop hurting us, or stop hurting yourself! Those pills, they have done more to take you away from us than that coma ever did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I care about what's happening with our family.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, you have a really weird way of showing it.",
        "Jade: What do you want me to do, Luke?",
        "Luke: Oh, I don't know, Jade. Maybe you could make a dinner, or spend some time with Faith and Natalie. Or tell my mom that you're sorry about everything that's happening. I mean, if you even care.",
        "Jade: Of course I care. I know that she lost your grandmother's company. And I did tell her that I was sorry.",
        "Luke: When?",
        "Jade: Yesterday. We met up to catch up. And I told her that I was interested in taking some classes and she was really supportive.",
        "Luke: So, in other words, she just gave you some money.",
        "Jade: She wanted to, Luke. I'm her niece, okay? It's not like she's giving money to a total stranger.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, would it kill you to return the kindness once in a while?",
        "Jade: Okay. Okay. I will help out more. Maybe I can baby sit Ethan or I could take Faith and Natalie to the movies.",
        "Luke: Okay. Well, you better mean it.",
        "Jade: I do.",
        "Luke: Okay. Well then that would be good, because the girls can use some time out of the house. My parents have been fighting a lot.",
        "Jade: I thought things were going okay.",
        "Luke: No. No. No, my dad found out the real reason that Mom made all those mistakes with the company. It's because she was all messed up on diet pills.",
        "Jade: Wait, that can't be the only reason.",
        "Luke: Jade, she has a real problem. She's been hiding these pills from my dad and lying about it.",
        "Jade: She mentioned something to me, but I had no idea how bad it had gotten. If I had had a problem, I never would have --",
        "Luke: You never would have what?",
        "Jade: A few months ago, I gave her some diet pills -- to try.",
        "Luke: You gave -- you gave my mother diet pills?",
        "Jade: I take them sometimes when I want to lose some weight.",
        "Luke: Did it ever occur to you that maybe it was a real stupid idea to give a woman who just got out of a coma some diet pills?",
        "Jade: No, it didn't because she wanted to lose some weight, okay? And I never had any problems with them.",
        "Luke: Okay, Jade, damn it! You've got a brain. When are you ever going to use it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Tell me what happened today. Why you bought the pills.",
        "Lily: I wanted to make things right with my mother. I offered to go work at Worldwide. Craig had offered me a job, I figured it would be a great way to keep tabs on him. Craig breaks the law, I tell my mother, she gets rid of him.",
        "Holden: Lucinda didn't go for it?",
        "Lily: She accused me of using her job to hide from my own problems.",
        "Holden: That must have hurt. And that's why you decided to buy the pills?",
        "Lily: I look at myself -- Holden, I hate everything about me.",
        "Holden: And the pills are supposed to help?",
        "Lily: I'm just tired of being needy. I'm tired of leaning on you -- I'm tired of my life being completely out of control --",
        "Holden: Lily, the pills, they're the answer --",
        "Lily: They just give me energy. I wouldn't have taken one today if I hadn't felt so down. That doesn't make me an addict.",
        "Holden: I thought you said that you didn't take one?",
        "Lily: Just one. Just one.",
        "Holden: Right. And if you hadn't had a crisis with Lucinda, it would've been some other excuse.",
        "Lily: No, I had stopped taking them. I had.",
        "Holden: That's the same thing Faith said. She said she stopped for days. But then Parker invited her to a pep rally and she was feeling nervous about the way she was going to look. So what does she do? She heads straight over to the cupboard where she stashed a box of laxatives. And she said she was going to do it this once. Sound familiar?",
        "Lily: It is not the same thing.",
        "Holden: No? As far as I can see, you both have eating disorders that are out of control!",
        "[Faith is in the next room and overhears all of this]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I've withstood hostile takeovers, I've -- market changes, all that kind of thing, but now, finally, I'm betrayed by my own daughter who let the barbarians in. And I'm sorry, Bob. This could have been avoided if she had just been truthful and she wasn't.",
        "Bob: Sometimes our children make mistakes.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, and I wouldn't be taking it so hard today if Craig hadn't already changed the name. It's Montgomery Enterprises now. Oh, yeah. Its Montgomery Enterprises. He's got the board against me. It's disgusting. I feel like I've been put out to pasture.",
        "Bob: Can you see any kind of blessing in any of this?",
        "Lucinda: Like what?",
        "Bob: Well, you've worked hard all your life. Maybe slowing down is not a bad idea.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling, if I wanted to retire on my terms, that's another thing. Or if I wanted to pass the torch to somebody that I really liked -- but to be escorted out of my company that I made by the guards that I hired? It's disgusting!",
        "Bob: And very stressful.",
        "Lucinda: Extremely.",
        "Bob: You know, it hasn't been that long since you have your bout with cancer. Maybe you should consider what's really important in the long run.",
        "Lucinda: You don't think my work is important?",
        "Bob: Well, I think that you've proven yourself an amazing businesswoman, but maybe you should try to pay a little more attention to the other parts of my life?",
        "Lucinda: Craig's hoping that I'm battle-weary, that I'll fold my tent. I may let him think that, just for a little while. But I'm not going to let him get away with this.",
        "Bob: Lucinda --",
        "Lucinda: No, I'm not. I'm going to get my company back, if it kills me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, of course you have an agenda, Paul. What else would inspire these miraculous visions?",
        "Paul: Look, I told you, I'll tell you what I know, on one condition.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, just exactly what you want?",
        "Paul: Oh, it's not for me.",
        "Craig: Oh, who -- who, then?",
        "Paul: Well, you know Meg's family is devastated by what you've done.",
        "Craig: Oh, if you mean my takeover of Worldwide, oh, Lucinda was more than ready for anybody to come along and just knock her off the throne. It wasn't personal.",
        "Paul: Of course it was personal. You took control of the company, so you could swap the company for information about Johnny's whereabouts. Only Lucinda has no idea where Johnny is.",
        "Craig: Oh, but you do. You and your visions.",
        "Paul: It's a matter of public record. All of my premonitions have been completely accurate.",
        "Craig: What exactly are you proposing?",
        "Paul: I propose that you relinquish all control of Worldwide -- immediately and unconditionally.",
        "Craig: Oh, okay, so I give everything back to Lucinda, and then you bring me to where Johnny is?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I think it's a bargain.",
        "Craig: Wow, you really are insane.",
        "Craig: Hey, I think you had some actual, physical brain damage in that accident. I mean, you are delusional.",
        "Paul: Well, I hate to disappoint you, Craig. But I'm completely sane.",
        "Craig: Well, you don't dictate terms to me.",
        "Paul: There are plenty of other companies, Craig. Why don't you go after one of them? Isn't Johnny more important than Worldwide?",
        "Craig: Oh, sorry. Am I supposed to think this is my last chance?",
        "Paul: No, I don't care, think whatever you want.",
        "Craig: Oh, really? Yeah, what happens next? I mean, do you lure me to some Central American jungle and then you pierce my heart with a poison dart when I yearn for a last look at my boy?",
        "Paul: Actually, Johnny's a lot closer than that.",
        "Craig: Well, you see, if that was true, then maybe I should be the one to torture you.",
        "Paul: Produces unreliable results. It would be a lot better if you just compromise to the deal.",
        "Craig: Worldwide for my son?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I said before, it's a bargain.",
        "Craig: I did want to see how far you would be willing to go to impress to Meg. That is what this is about, isn't it? Let her know that you care about her more than I do?",
        "Paul: I never stopped caring about Meg. You, you turned your back on her first chance you got.",
        "Craig: Oh, that's right. I have no interest in her or her family.",
        "Paul: Meg is very difficult to forget.",
        "Craig: Why would I grind up people that she cares about if I still wanted her?",
        "Paul: Maybe part of the reason that you did it, is because she doesn't want you.",
        "Craig: How many times did Meg leave you, Paul? I've lost count. Let me tell you something, there's far more security in winning a business deal than in ever winning a woman's heart.",
        "Paul: It's great to know. I have to go now. I'm going to go home and sew that on a pillow.",
        "Craig: Oh, you should, be my guest. Yeah you're going to need something to come up with to do, nobody in their right mind is going to hire you.",
        "Paul: No one will hire you either. That's why you got to go steal companies.",
        "Craig: Didn't your magical powers tell you? That everything that I do is completely legal.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but you still don't have Johnny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, Craig is the kind of man that sells companies like used cars. He has no respect for worldwide or it's reputation.",
        "Bob: You know, you may have to make a choice. If you're going to expend all of your energy trying to get your company back, you could harm your health and your family.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, for heaven's sake, Bob. I feel fine.",
        "Bob: Except about Lily. Look, don't let this go on. I don't know of anybody that ever longed for a new business deal on his deathbed.",
        "Lucinda: Bob, why are you talking about death so much to me?",
        "Bob: I'm sorry. Well, I lost a patient today. He died alone. His daughter didn't get there in time.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I'm so sorry. So, this was a cautionary tale?",
        "Bob: Just a reminder that there are some things we can't control. You need to make peace with Lily.",
        "Lucinda: Under the circumstance, you know, it's not so easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I was trying to help, Luke. And I'm really sorry that she got hooked, but you can't blame me for everything that goes wrong in this town!",
        "Luke: I'm not talking about everything, I'm talking about my mother. She is really mess up, Jade. And it's your fault that she's that way.",
        "Jade: I'm not taking the blame for this.",
        "Luke: Oh, you know what? You're so good at showing that you care. You're so good at being a part of this family.",
        "Jade: I told you that I was sorry. So, now what?",
        "Luke: I don't know. I don't know. I guess we just -- I guess that's up to my mom and dad.",
        "Jade: Oh, great. So, now you're going to go tell Holden that I was the one who got her started?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I don't think we should be throwing around terms that we really don't understand. An eating disorder is one thing. Being a little too dependent on appetite suppressants is another --",
        "Holden: I don't care what you call it, Lily. But you can't stop taking those pills. Just like Faith can't stop binging and purging.",
        "Lily: I can stop. I know the choices I have to make, I know how to follow through. Faith is a child. We can not expect her to have the same kind of will power.",
        "Holden: You are in total denial. You have no control over any of this. You need to be honest with --",
        "Lily: You need to stop attacking me! I made a mistake! I'm trying to fix it!",
        "Holden: Oh, what mistakes are we talking about? Trusting Craig, losing your mother's company, lying to me, lying to yourself? Buying more pills when you told me that you were going to stop taking them, what?",
        "Lily: That's not fair!",
        "Holden: No, what's not fair is that everyone around you is suffering because you're worried that you gained a few pounds. Does that matter more to you than how Faith looks at herself?",
        "Lily: I talked to Faith. We've had a very, very nice discussion and I admitted that I was a bad example. I asked her for forgiveness. And she was lot more understanding than you are. She doesn't blame me for all of her problems.",
        "Holden: Oh, so you're comfortable if she blames herself?",
        "Lily: No! No, no, of course not! All I'm saying is I'm taking responsibility for my part in this. It's a process. I have to help Faith and I have to help myself at the same time.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but right now you're hurting her a lot more than you're helping her.",
        "Lily: What about you? What about you? You're her parent! There's two parents here! Whatever you're doing for her, it's not helping either.",
        "Holden: Lily, I'm not lying to her. I'm not expecting her to do something that I can't do!",
        "Faith: Please stop fighting! I'll do whatever you want! I'll eat!",
        "Holden: Hey, Honey.",
        "Faith: I'll be good, I swear. See? [Faith takes a piece of bread and stuffs it in her mouth]",
        "Lily: Faith!",
        "Faith: No -- don't take it away! I want to show you --",
        "Lily: Stop, Faith! You're going to choke! Stop this! Stop!",
        "Faith: I don't care!",
        "Holden: Honey, Honey, its okay. It's okay. You don't have to do this.",
        "Faith: Please stop fighting --",
        "Holden: It's going to be okay.",
        "Lily: No, it's not you, Honey. It's not you.",
        "Faith: I'll be good. I'll eat whatever you want.",
        "Holden: No, no, listen to me. Your mom's right. None of this is about you.",
        "Faith: You wouldn't be fighting if I was normal, if I was pretty and skinny--",
        "Lily: Oh, Honey, no you're perfect just the way that you are --",
        "Faith: You don't believe that!",
        "Lily: I do believe it. I do.",
        "Faith: You say you're fat all the time. And when Dad says that you aren't, you tell him he's wrong.",
        "Lily: I do do that. I do do that. I'm so sorry.",
        "Faith: I know I shouldn't throw up, but I look at myself, and I want to be sick.",
        "Lily: And I take a pill.",
        "Faith: Maybe that's better.",
        "Lily: No, it's not. No, it's not. Because it makes me lose sight of what's really important.",
        "Faith: What's going to happen if we can't stop? I'm scared.",
        "Lily: I know. So am I. So am I. I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Is that really what you're worried about? That I'll bust you with my dad?",
        "Jade: We both know that Holden has issues with me. And I do not want him thinking that I was sabotaging Lily.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but he wouldn't go there.",
        "Jade: Oh, yeah. But you would? I can't believe you really think that I would hurt your mother on purpose.",
        "Luke: Look, Jade. It just would make my mom feel so much better if my dad knew that she didn't know what she was getting into.",
        "Jade: You can forget it. He's going to kick me out of the family.",
        "Luke: You know what? I just -- you talk so much about how you care about our family, how you love Lily, but then you don't step up. You know what? We're through.",
        "Jade: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Luke: Look, I know you're technically a part of this family, and I can't do anything about that. But right now, you don't seem like family. Right now, I don't even want you as a friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Well, well, well, well, well, look who's here?",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Lisa. Hello.",
        "Lisa: Hello. Hi. All alone, I see. How you doing?",

        "Meg: You know, Paul never told me anything about knowing where Johnny is.",
        "Craig: That's because it's a lie. But he should not be using my son as a bargaining chip.",

        "Meg: Well, what -- Faith, Faith. Why are you even talking to Faith? She's a little girl.",
        "Paul: I ran into Faith and Parker. Faith just volunteered the information.",
        "Meg: Oh, and of course you couldn't leave it alone. Don't you understand? I don't want to be the excuse for your revenge dramas, okay? It's what broke us up the first place. And I don't want it to be a part of my life anymore.",
        "Paul: So, Craig is just supposed to get away with what he's done?",
        "Meg: No, of course not! Tricking Lily when she believed that he had the answer to her prayer. That's -- that's unforgivable. Okay, but -- but you can't get down to his level, you can't find the answer there, okay? You can't solve the problem with more lies.",

        "Paul: Look, I don't think you understand what I've done.",

Now you encouraged Lucy to take Johnny and to run away from me. I thought it only fair, I could do what I could do to estrange your daughter from you.",

And of course, I'm not completely at peace about the other thing. I thought of Worldwide as a legacy. You know, for all of you. That I'd leave something behind for you all.",
