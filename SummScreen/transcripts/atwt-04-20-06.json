        "Jade: Oh. I'm glad I caught you.",
        "Luke: Well you're blocking the front door it's pretty hard to miss, you should be careful I could've been Mom.",
        "Jade: No she left about twenty minutes ago.",
        "Luke: What? So now you have the whole house staked out?",
        "Jade: You didn't answer my calls and I wanted to make sure you were okay.",
        "Luke: I'm fine.",
        "Jade: You're still mad at me about last night.",
        "Luke: Jade, you jumped me.",
        "Jade: That's what kissing me felt like? Like you were jumped?",
        "Luke: I can't be into you, and you know why.",
        "Jade: I just thought maybe the whole gay thing was about Kevin. He was the only guy you'd ever talked about.",
        "Luke: No, Jade, I really am gay.",
        "Jade: I'm sorry if I made you feel worse.",
        "Luke: You couldn't have, actually I kind of feel like, you know. I think my life would be a whole lot easier if I really was in love with you.",
        "Jade: As long as they think that we are you can be free.",
        "Luke: Free? No, I'm walking around with this gigantic knot in my stomach.",
        "Jade: Well I mean a lot of people go their whole lives and they never come out to their family.",
        "Luke: That's not me.",
        "Jade: I'm just saying you're not required to especially, if it's clear they don't want to know that you're gay.",

        "Casey: Okay. Not a good sign.",
        "Maddie: I'm reading about the French revolution. And I just got to the guillotine part.",
        "Casey: Yeah, that's way more interesting than me. A little better. Are we okay with everything?",
        "Maddie: What do you mean? Are we okay with you spending all your time at Crash with Gwen, leaving me alone and forlorn? Yeah, we're fine.",
        "Casey: Good.",
        "Maddie: And you're here.",
        "Casey: I couldn't miss your big day.",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Casey: I can't believe I had to read it in the newspaper, but okay. Fine, treat me like one of your drooling fans.",
        "Maddie: Whoa what are you babbling about?",
        "Casey: That.",
        "Maddie: What's going on?",
        "Casey: Like you don't know. Today \"Oakdale Confidential's\" author will be revealing her true identity to the world. And that's you, right? So get ready for your close-up, Maddie Coleman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Come on Jennifer just look at it.",
        "Jennifer: I know you shot yourself, Paul. I don't have to see it to believe it.",
        "Paul: Shooting yourself? Tough way to commit suicide.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Paul: Just look at it, look at the scar?",
        "Jennifer: I don't give a damn about your scar right! All I care about is finding Dusty. That's what matters.",
        "Paul: Emily has him. Until you realize that, you don't stand a chance of getting him back. Now look at it. And Jennifer its an exit wound.",
        "Jennifer: You couldn't have -- couldn't have, no --.",
        "Paul: Emily shot me. In the back, while I was walking away.",

        "Emily: Tom?",
        "Tom: Hey thanks officer we'll be fine.",
        "Emily: What's going on? Is something going on with Daniel? Is he okay?",
        "Tom: No, he's fine. That's not why I called you.",
        "Emily: Okay, well I don't have time to chat so --.",
        "Tom: Well this is official business.",
        "Emily: What -- what am I arrested or something?",
        "Tom: No, no I just have a few questions.",
        "Emily: About what?",
        "Tom: About Meg Snyder. You heard that she was arrested yesterday.",
        "Emily: Yeah I heard.",
        "Tom: So we're just going over the entire case. We're going back to first arrest and up until now.",
        "Emily: So what's that have to do with me?",
        "Tom: Well you were the reason that first arrest. I mean no one was even looking at Meg Snyder until you showed up, talking about what you'd found when you illegally broke into her hotel suite. So, why did you do that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: If someone shot you --",
        "Paul: Emily.",
        "Jennifer: So you didn't try to kill yourself.",
        "Paul: No. Emily shot me in the back, and then she pushed my body over a cliff. Come on Jennifer, if I wanted to kill myself, do you think that I would aim here?",
        "Jennifer: So Dad was right.",
        "Paul: Yes, he was --.",
        "Jennifer: But your fingerprints were on the gun.",
        "Paul: I put them there. Because I didn't want Emily to go to jail. Because it was -- all my fault.",
        "Jennifer: Your fault?",
        "Paul: It was New Years Eve, and we were supposed to get married and all I could think about was what you had said to me. You said I should think about somebody else. And I did -- I kept thinking about everything Emily had given up to be with me, and what she'd have to give up if she stayed with me. So I told her we couldn't get married.",
        "Jennifer: So Emily shot you on New Year's Eve. And now she has Dusty.",
        "Paul: Yes and that proves what she's capable of. She's capable of --",
        "Jennifer: No, no, this makes no sense. Makes no sense.",
        "Paul: It does -- it does make sense. I'm trying to explain to you.",
        "Jennifer: I don't care! All I care about is finding Dusty.",
        "Paul: That's all I care about. That's why I married Emily.",
        "Jennifer: Emily, who shot you --",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "[Jennifer laughing]",
        "Paul: Stop you can't go. You can't go to Emily now.",
        "Jennifer: Why.",
        "Paul: Because she doesn't know that we're onto her yet.",
        "Jennifer: We, whose we?",
        "Paul: Me and Meg. Now you and you now.",
        "Jennifer: That is not company that I care to keep.",
        "Paul: You can not go straight at Emily.",
        "Jennifer: Why because she's going to shoot at me?",
        "Paul: She could yes.",
        "Jennifer: You know what, I'll take my chances.",
        "Paul: Look are you going to take chances with Dusty's life? Because that's what you're doing. If you go right at Emily she feels the walls closing in, there's no telling what she'll do to your boyfriend, Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I knew Paul hadn't killed Dusty, he couldn't have. Meg was the obvious suspect.",
        "Tom: But he's already confessed to that crime.",
        "Emily: Yeah because he's been overwhelmed with a lot of things but he's innocent.",
        "Tom: Paul Ryan? Innocent?",
        "Emily: He was. I mean, he is. Everybody knows that now Tom.",
        "Tom: Yeah but he wasn't your husband. Not then. The story then was he'd dumped you at the altar, and you two were barely speaking.",
        "Emily: We are working at rebuilding our relationship. Which is no of your business. The point is, they have proof that Dusty was alive while Paul was in jail. He didn't take him. That's all that matters.",
        "Tom: Well then who did take him, where is he, is he still alive. Those things matter too.",
        "Emily: You have the person who took him. Ask Meg.",
        "Tom: Well then we need leverage. We need to build a real case against her so that's why we're going back to the beginning and looking over everything.",
        "Emily: Well what about the bloody clothes? What about Dusty's bloody clothes, they found in Meg's car. You have that don't you? That's what I read in the paper this morning.",
        "Tom: We do but there's no evidence she ever handled those. And she swears she had nothing to do with Dusty's disappearance.",
        "Emily: What did you expect? Of course she denies it.",
        "Tom: We have one piece of circumstantial evidence.",
        "Emily: What about the gloves that had Dusty's blood all over them?",
        "Tom: The gloves are inadmissible. The judge ruled that their tainted because someone obtained them when they broke into her hotel room. So, don't have enough evidence to charge her. I don't even have a motive. And I don't have enough evidence to convict her. So, guilty or not, Meg Snyder will walk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Go on, don't you want to meet your adoring public.",
        "Maddie: No.",
        "Casey: Yeah, you're probably right. You don't want to spoil the big surprise.",
        "Maddie: Right. No, Casey, listen --",
        "Casey: I can't believe they're late.",
        "Maddie: Who?",
        "Casey: Lia, Skyler, Megan and Bryn.",
        "Maddie: What? You invited all the girls who ignored me at school? Plus the ones that chase after you?",
        "Casey: Yeah. You don't want them to miss your moment of triumph, do you?",
        "Maddie: I'm going to be nauseous.",
        "Casey: That's probably normal. Just make sure you throw up before you change.",
        "Maddie: Change?",
        "Casey: For the television interview. You weren't going to wear that, were you? Forget I said that. It's a great outfit. I'm sure it's going to look even better on camera.",
        "Maddie: This is such a big mistake.",
        "Casey: No, it's not. You want the big splash, right? Live.",
        "Maddie: Live?",
        "Casey: Yeah. And they're going to be tuning in at school in the lounge, too.",
        "Maddie: Casey, why did you tell people that I wrote this book?",
        "Casey: Because I'm proud of you. What's the big deal?",
        "Kim: All right, all right, everybody, everybody. The moment of truth has finally come.",
        "Casey: Here we go.",
        "Kim: I give you the author of Oakdale's page-turning, tell-all novel, \"Oakdale Confidential.\" Our very own Nancy Hughes.",

        "Holden: Aren't you pushing it?",
        "Jade: I made sure you were home before I came over. I wanted to apologize to you for last night.",
        "Luke: Yeah, that's okay. Later.",
        "Holden: Where are you going?",
        "Luke: The library. I have got a study group.",
        "Holden: Can I speak to you a minute before you go?",
        "Jade: Do you want me to stay?",
        "Luke: No, it's okay.",
        "Jade: Are you're sure?",
        "Luke: Yeah, my dad and I have stuff that we need to talk about.",
        "Jade: Okay. See you later.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry that I had to run out of here last night. But I had to help out with Meg.",
        "Luke: Yeah, she's in jail? Did she do something do Dusty?",
        "Holden: Yeah, you know what? It's a mess. I'm more concerned about you.",
        "Luke: I'm fine.",
        "Holden: What about that fight you had with Jade?",
        "Luke: We're over it. It wasn't a big deal. I was just trying to stick to Mom's rules. Like I said.",
        "Holden: And I appreciate that you're doing that, but back to what I walked in on. If you're having a problem and you need somebody to talk to --",
        "Luke: Dad, Dad, its okay. Just please stop.",
        "Holden: What is it?",
        "Luke: There's something I need to tell you.",
        "Lily: What are you doing out here?",
        "Jade: Hi.",
        "Lily: Why are you snooping around?",
        "Jade: I wasn't. Luke's giving me a ride to the library. I was just waiting to see if he was on his way out.",
        "Lily: You couldn't ring the bell and ask?",
        "Jade: No. I know that I'm not welcome here and I didn't want to intrude. I can go wait by the driveway.",
        "Lily: Yeah, thank you. Jade, Jade, Jade. I don't want to leave things this way.",
        "Lily: Holden told me about the money that you tried to leave for me yesterday.",
        "Jade: I still have it if you want.",
        "Lily: No, I don't want your money.",
        "Jade: Well you can let me repay you. I know that I don't have that much.",
        "Lily: No, no, no, I don't want it. I think you should keep the money you earn from that library for rent.",
        "Jade: Oh, how much rent do you want? I can give it to you as soon as I get --",
        "Lily: No, no, no, rent for your new place.",
        "Jade: You want me to leave.",
        "Lily: Jade, the only reason I let you to stay in the guesthouse is because I didn't want my son to get sick. Once I know Luke is okay, you're on your own. You'll pay the landlord rent.",
        "Jade: Sure.",
        "Lily: Thanks for the gesture.",
        "Jade: You're welcome. Let me get that for you.",
        "Lily: Oh no, no, no, it's fine.",

        "Lily: It's nothing.",

        "Lily: No, no, no, I'm fine.",
        "[Lily winces]",
        "Luke: You've been so good about all of this. It's actually unreal.",
        "Holden: Well, I'm done yelling. Because it doesn't seem to work with you anyway. So what is it?",
        "Luke: Well I feel like for the past few months all I've done is disappoint you.",
        "Holden: That's not true. That's not true at all.",
        "Jade: Call a doctor.",
        "Lily: No. No. No. Not yet.",
        "Holden: What's wrong?",
        "Jade: It's the baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I'm never gonna live this down. Why'd you lie to me?",
        "Maddie: I didn't! I never actually said I wrote the book.",
        "Casey: One simple sentence, that's all it would've taken. Instead you tried to steal the spotlight from my great grandmother? I mean, who does that to a sweet lady?",
        "Nancy: Who are you calling sweet?",
        "Casey: Gram. Hey.",
        "Nancy: Hello, darling. Thanks for coming. Especially on such short notice.",
        "Casey: No way I could miss this. All these people are waving at you. I think they want your autograph.",
        "Nancy: They want to know my sources. But I will never spill the beans.",
        "Casey: Psych.",
        "Maddie: You knew all along.",
        "Casey: Oh, and you're gonna act all outraged?",
        "Maddie: Oh you know what? You are so lucky I'm scared of that sweet lady.",
        "Casey: Who isn't?",
        "Kim: My mother-in-law swears she will not reveal her sources, but she will sign these books, so come on down. Maybe you can slip a question in, and maybe she'll give us a hint.",
        "Lisa: Nancy Hughes, you've got some nerve.",
        "Nancy: Hello, dear. Is there a problem?",
        "Lisa: You better believe it! This is what I think of your trashy book!",
        "Nancy: Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: So Emily shot you. And now you're married to her.",
        "Paul: Because Emily has Dusty and this is the best chance we have of finding out where. That's the only reason I have anything to do with Emily.",
        "Jennifer: Because miraculously you've managed to fall in love with Meg Snyder.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Meg is amazing --",
        "Jennifer: Who had Dusty's bloody clothes in her car!",
        "Paul: Because Emily planted them there.",
        "Jennifer: Why am I supposed to believe that? How do I know that Meg didn't take Dusty? How do I know that the two of you aren't in this together to get rid of Emily? And you're just using Dusty to do it?",
        "Paul: If I wanted to get rid of Emily, all I would have to do is go to the cops and show them where Emily shot me. I could have done that months ago. Look, I know that if I don't bring Dusty home to you, that I'm as good as dead to you.",
        "Jennifer: You know, Paul, if Dusty doesn't come home you're dead. Period. I will see to that.",
        "Paul: Which is the second worst thing that could ever happen to me? It's almost as bad as if you cut me out of your life. Now, why would I do anything that would risk either one of those two things happen?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know. I don't know, Paul. Because this is all pretty twisted to me.",
        "Paul: Well, Jennifer. Look, we're gonna work this out. We're gonna straighten it all out.",
        "Jennifer: Ok, so she has him hostage somewhere? Why?",
        "Paul: She's scared. And she's not thinking straight. And now she's using Dusty to try and frame Meg.",
        "Jennifer: If Emily wants to get rid of Meg, it's not enough to have her just arrested. She's gonna want her convicted and sent to prison.",
        "Paul: For life. Emily wants Meg gone. And she will do anything, including kill Dusty to make that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So you need Dusty's body, don't you?",
        "Tom: Well, if he's dead. I mean, we hope that he's alive and we can get a location. But they grilled Meg Snyder all night and she did not budge. Doesn't have Dusty, doesn't know where he is. They found her very convincing.",
        "Emily: Oh, Tom, please. She's a woman scorned. Dusty dumped her, she wanted to pay him back.",
        "Tom: Because she loved him.",
        "Emily: Exactly.",
        "Tom: Then why the restraining order?",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Tom: Jack Snyder tells me that Paul took out a restraining order against Meg because she was stalking the two of you.",
        "Emily: Yes. That's right. The woman is seriously unbalanced.",
        "Tom: So in love with Dusty that she killed him because he dumped her. Yet at the same time so in love with Paul that she began harassing the two of you?",
        "Emily: Yes. Yes. That's what I'm saying. First Dusty, then Paul. Don't ask me to explain. I don't know. The woman has always been desperate and grabby.",
        "Tom: Well that's not how a lot of people see her.",
        "Emily: You want me to be nice about the woman who's after my husband? Forget it. You know what? Do yourself a favor, ask Jennifer Munson what she thinks about Meg. In the meantime you need to keep Meg behind bars!",
        "Tom: Lucky for you that's where she is.",
        "Emily: What do you mean lucky for me? She got herself arrested, I had nothing to do with it!",
        "Tom: Nobody said you did.",
        "Emily: Well then what are you implying?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Tom: Excuse me. Tom Hughes. I filed this morning. When is he ruling? Then tell Lansky to stall him, and I'll be right over. I need to go to the courthouse.",
        "Emily: That's it?",
        "Tom: Yeah, that's it. I know where you live.",
        "Emily: I am so onto you.",
        "Meg: Excuse me?",
        "Emily: You pull this whole wounded bird act for your cousin Jack to get him on your side, and then he talks to Tom and pretty soon you've got the whole town bending over backwards for poor little Meg. Well guess what? I'm not gonna let you walk out of this place. I'm gonna make sure you spend the rest of your life behind bars.",
        "Meg: If anyone belongs in jail for what they've done, it's you!",

        "Jennifer: Now all we have to do is figure out how to rattle Emily's cage.",
        "Paul: I have an idea.",
        "Emily: You gonna try to pin Dusty's murder on me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: You think that your ex killed my boyfriend because she's jealous of your new girlfriend.",
        "Paul: You want me to feel worse? Do you think I could possibly feel anymore responsible than I already do? I would do anything to make this right, including marry Emily.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then, what do we do? What do we do? We can't wait for the miraculous moment when Emily finally decides to tell you where Dusty is.",
        "Paul: I don't know. That was the plan, yes.",
        "Jennifer: We don't have time for that! Dusty -- hm-mm. No, there has to be another way. Henry. Henry.",
        "Paul: Henry, he doesn't know where Dusty is. I just spent hours trying to get him to talk.",
        "Jennifer: He didn't want to tell you. But if we bring him down to the police station and we get my dad to talk to him.",
        "Paul: Oh, right. Because Hal is so reasonable and detached when it comes to Emily. Come on! Henry doesn't know anything. And parading Henry through the police station isn't going to make Emily feel anymore safe.",
        "Jennifer: So what?",
        "Paul: So what? I told you, the only thing that's really important here is that Emily not panic!",
        "Jennifer: That's it. No, why, why, why? Because she's going to run straight to Dusty?",
        "Paul: That's what we need. That's exactly what we need.",
        "Paul: Yeah, we wind her up and then I follow her.",
        "Jennifer: No, we follow her.",
        "Paul: No, you're not going anywhere near Emily. She's too dangerous.",
        "Jennifer: Why, because she shoots? But only at you.",
        "Paul: I'm not taking chances with you, Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: That's not your call. I'm looking out for Dusty.",
        "Paul: Jennifer.",
        "Jennifer: No, the last time the two of you were in a room together, you almost killed each other. Right, that part was true. You got into a fight.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but --",
