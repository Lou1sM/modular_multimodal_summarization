        "Craig: How many times do I have to tell you this, Ellis? I will replace the money in Parker's trust as soon as Monte Carlo begins to produce a reliable revenue stream. Meanwhile, I still need to put another expense on the debit card.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Craig: But somebody's here right now. Let me call you back. Parker.",
        "Parker: Hi. We need to talk about my trust fund.",
        "Craig: Your -- your trust fund. Sure. What about it?",
        "Parker: Well, I was walking down the street today, and I walked by this car dealership, and there was this really sweet convertible on sale.",
        "Craig: Okay, I have to stop you right there. I think that's a pretty bad idea. Now, I got you the debit card so you could go up to Minnesota, see Liberty while she was still in the hospital there, but that was a unique situation.",
        "Parker: I agree with you.",
        "Craig: You do?",
        "Parker: Yeah. I mean, I realize that just because that jerk Gabriel got a hot new ride doesn't mean that I need to get one.",
        "Craig: He really is a jerk, isn't he?",
        "Parker: The point is, I've been working very hard this past year to do the right thing, to be responsible, to prove myself to my parents, to take care of Liberty. And I was ready just suddenly one second to blow it all because of an idiot.",
        "Craig: You know, I think that's -- that's very, very mature of you.",
        "Parker: That's why I want you to shut down the debit card account.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Parker: Well, Liberty's back home. She's doing better. So I don't need it anymore.",
        "Craig: That doesn't mean you have to shut it down.",
        "Parker: Well, I don't want the temptation, so I want you to shut down the account, take whatever money there is left in the trust fund, and make it as hard as possible for me to get at it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: So, what do you want to do?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. I'm actually fine just sitting here.",
        "Gabriel: Well, you just got some really great news. You don't want to celebrate?",
        "Liberty: I know, but I'm still trying to take it all in. I keep thinking my phone's gonna ring and the doctor will tell me there's been a mistake.",
        "Gabriel: Well, did he sound confused when he told you?",
        "Liberty: No.",
        "Gabriel: So I don't think you're gonna be getting that call.",
        "Liberty: I'm just having a hard time believing it's true. I must have thought a million times about what I'd do when chemo was over, but now that it is, I'm like lost.",
        "Gabriel: Right. It came sooner than you expected.",
        "Liberty: Shouldn't that make it even better?",
        "Gabriel: Just give it some time.",
        "Liberty: I guess. Don't you have anything better to do than just sitting here with me?",
        "Gabriel: Well, what could be better than sitting with someone who just got their life back?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, I did, didn't I? But I'm still kind of sick, and I'm bald, and I have a complicated relationship with my ex-husband.",
        "Gabriel: I mean, I'm pretty sure you just described the girl of my dreams.",
        "Liberty: Right.",
        "Gabriel: What?",
        "Liberty: Why are you here? I mean, really, why are you acting like someone who cares what happens to me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: Thought I heard somebody.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing here?",
        "Teri: I just came by to pick something up. I'm glad I ran into you.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Teri: Well, you haven't been around for a while, and we missed you.",
        "Dusty: Thanks.",
        "Teri: How are you feeling? The doctor said you could drink so soon after your surgery?",
        "Dusty: Well, they didn't say I couldn't.",
        "Teri: Maybe you should lay off.",
        "Dusty: You want one?",
        "Teri: No.",
        "Dusty: It might help.",
        "Teri: With what?",
        "Dusty: You haven't talked to your sister yet, have you?",
        "Teri: Talked to her about what?",
        "Dusty: You don't know?",
        "Teri: Know what? What are you talking about?",
        "Dusty: You better sit down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Sorry.",
        "Jack: No, don't be.",
        "Janet: I just keep carrying on like this, it's ridiculous.",
        "Jack: You just lost your father, Janet.",
        "Janet: I can't believe it.",
        "Carly: I saw Dusty. He told me what happened. I just want to tell you how sorry I am and tell you that you and Liberty are welcome to stay at the house as long as you need to.",
        "Janet: I can't.",
        "Carly: I know that you're upset with me, and I didn't mean to --",
        "Janet: No, I mean, I -- I just -- I can't do this with you right now. Excuse me.",
        "Jack: Why don't I call you later? I have to help Janet sign some papers so the hospital can release her father to the funeral home.",
        "Carly: Well, call me as soon as you can. It's important.",
        "Janet: Can you just back off for a second?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Janet: I just lot my father, and Jack is trying to help me deal with this. So would you get over yourself and just leave us alone?",
        "Carly: Janet, I'm -- I am not trying to take Jack away.",
        "Janet: You mean for the first time since we've been married?",
        "Carly: That is not true.",
        "Janet: What's the difference, Carly? You got what you wanted anyway, so why don't you let me mourn with my family? You can gloat later.",
        "Carly: I'm certainly not gloating.",
        "Jack: Maybe you should -- you should go.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: I've got to help Janet with a lot of things. Like I said, I'll call you later.",
        "Carly: Okay. Fine. I am so sorry.",
        "Janet: Thank you.",
        "Jack: Let's take care of signing that paperwork, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, Parker, if this were only a year ago, I think I would have agreed with you. I would have said, \"You're right, you shouldn't have that debit card.\" But now I think you're mature enough. I don't think you'll abuse it.",
        "Parker: I don't want it.",
        "Craig: I'll tell you what. I'll hang on to it for you. I know Liberty's doing fine now, but just in case she backslides, the card will be available in case you need it.",
        "Parker: She's doing a lot better. The doctor told us today that the cancer's retreating. So I don't need the card. What I do need is for that money to be in a place where I can't touch it.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Parker: Is this about my mom?",
        "Craig: Why would this be about your mom?",
        "Parker: Well, this whole you telling me how mature I am thing, is this you trying to butter me up to score points with her?",
        "Craig: I didn't even think about your mother.",
        "Parker: Come on.",
        "Craig: Trust me, I'm pretty sure that ship has sailed.",
        "Parker: Then why are you working so hard to bring Monte Carlo back to life?",
        "Craig: Because I think this company has great potential.",
        "Parker: My mom is back together with my father. You know that, right?",
        "Craig: Yeah. The news has reached me.",
        "Parker: And even if things are a little weird between them right now, they're together.",
        "Craig: Weird? Weird how?",
        "Parker: Never mind. It doesn't matter.",
        "Craig: I know they're fighting. Your mother told me that much just this afternoon.",
        "Parker: I'm not talking about this with you, Craig.",
        "Craig: Okay, well, but what about the debit card?",
        "Parker: Just forget it. I'll keep it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I don't know what I'm gonna say to my mother.",
        "Jack: Well, whatever you do, you got to say it soon. Your father was going after one of Ralph's guys. News like that travels fast.",
        "Janet: Gosh, it's weird, you know? All those years alone with Liberty on our own, I always thought that I was gonna be the one to get a phone call someday saying my dad was dead. I never thought I was gonna be the one making that call.",
        "Jack: You have Teri to help you.",
        "Janet: I have to tell Teresa.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you should, before she hears it from somebody else.",
        "Janet: You're right.",
        "Jack: Come on. We'll go find her.",
        "Janet: You'll come with me?",
        "Jack: Unless, of course, you want Dusty to do it.",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Jack: Okay. Then let's go.",
        "Janet: Wait, Jack. Are you sure? Because Carly wanted to talk to you, and I was really mean to her.",
        "Jack: Carly has been very, very patient, but she understands what you're going through. Don't worry. I'm here as long as you need me to be.",
        "Janet: That means a lot to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Mom, you okay?",
        "Carly: Janet's father died.",
        "Parker: Oh, my God. Well, does Liberty know?",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "Parker: Was she upstairs in her room?",
        "Carly: No. No one else is here.",
        "Parker: She's probably still out with Gabriel. She got really good news today and decided to go out with him to celebrate. Long story.",
        "Carly: I think you should probably find her and tell her what happened.",
        "Parker: Yeah, yeah. You sure you're okay?",
        "Carly: I'm fine. Go on, find Liberty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: They tried to revive him, but it was too late.",
        "Janet: Teresa --",
        "Teri: Janet. I don't believe it. I can't believe Pop's gone.",
        "Janet: I know. I know.",
        "Teri: I don't know what we're supposed to do. Did you -- did you tell Mom? Does she know?",
        "Janet: No. Teresa, I haven't talked to her in so long, I wasn't sure that I was the one that should call her.",
        "Teri: Okay. God, we have to tell her. We should do it together.",
        "Janet: Yeah, okay. I'd like that.",
        "Teri: I think Pop would, too.",
        "Janet: I know. Okay. Come on.",
        "Dusty: How is she?",
        "Jack: How do you think?",
        "Dusty: Anything I can do?",
        "Jack: Well, I think she thinks you've done enough.",
        "Dusty: But you can never do enough, right?",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Dusty: You think this is your big chance to make up for the lousy way you've been treating her all these months?",
        "Jack: I'm not doing this with you right now, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Jack, 'cause in the end, you always come up short, and I have to pick up the pieces.",
        "Jack: Do yourself and me a favor and just stay out of it.",
        "Dusty: I'm not gonna watch you disappoint her again.",
        "Jack: Is that your job?",
        "Dusty: You dumped her, went back to your ex. That doesn't change just because now you're suddenly Mr. Sensitive after her father dies.",
        "Jack: Don't give me advice on my marriage.",
        "Dusty: You're not her husband anymore, Jack! You're divorced! Did you forget that?",
        "Jack: I remember a lot of things, Dusty. Don't worry. So does Janet.",
        "Dusty: I think you should leave her alone.",
        "Janet: Well, I don't, so it doesn't matter what you think.",
        "Teri: I thought we were gonna call Mom. Is something wrong?",
        "Janet: That depends. Do we have a problem?",
        "Dusty: No, we don't. Let me know if you need anything, either of you.",
        "Teri: He's just trying to help.",
        "Janet: Don't defend him.",
        "Teri: Okay, okay. I understand why you don't want him here right now. Why is he here?",
        "Jack: I'm here to help Janet.",
        "Teri: What brought that on?",
        "Janet: Teresa, please.",
        "Teri: No, I don't understand why he's okay and Dusty's not?",
        "Janet: Because Jack didn't cost our father his life.",
        "Jack: Look, whatever happened between Janet and me, we're having a baby together, and I intend on taking care of both of them.",
        "Teri: The way you intended to take care of her when you were married?",
        "Janet: Please, Teresa, don't do this right now.",
        "Teri: No, I'm just curious as to why we're just suddenly acting like Jack's husband of the year. He did walk out on you, remember?",
        "Janet: I asked him to stay with me, okay?",
        "Teri: No. No, it's not okay. You wanted Dusty gone. That's how I feel about him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: So, I was thinking how we could celebrate.",
        "Liberty: Were you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: Yeah. We could go to Chicago, maybe check out a club.",
        "Liberty: I don't know if I'm ready for all that excitement.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, if you want something less exciting, maybe we could go to Canada.",
        "Liberty: Don't you think that's a little far?",
        "Gabriel: Oh, no, no, no. Nothing is too far when you've got a sweet ride.",
        "Liberty: You still haven't answered my question.",
        "Gabriel: What's that?",
        "Liberty: Why do you care if I get better? I mean, I hardly know you, but you don't really seem like the kind of guy who gets off from hanging around with cancer chicks.",
        "Gabriel: Well, my mom was a cancer chick.",
        "Liberty: Sorry. I didn't know.",
        "Gabriel: I didn't tell you.",
        "Liberty: Is she okay?",
        "Gabriel: Well, we waited to get some good news so we could celebrate, but it never came.",
        "Liberty: I'm really sorry.",
        "Gabriel: I mean, it was a long time ago. That's why I know how this could have gone. So that's why I'm really happy for you.",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",
        "Parker: Thought you were gonna bring her home.",
        "Gabriel: Well, I'm starting to see why this dude is your ex-husband.",
        "Parker: We have to go.",
        "Gabriel: Hey, Dr. Doom, she's okay.",
        "Liberty: Parker, it isn't that cold out?",
        "Parker: I know, I know, but this is important.",
        "Liberty: What's wrong?",
        "Parker: I'll tell you on the way.",
        "Liberty: I got to go.",
        "Gabriel: Sure.",
        "Liberty: Thanks.",
        "Gabriel: What for?",
        "Liberty: For making me feel normal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Teri, I'm not trying to upset anyone.",
        "Teri: You don't have to try.",
        "Janet: Teresa --",
        "Teri: What?",
        "Jack: Okay, look, I'm here because your sister asked me to be here. If she asks me to leave, then I'll leave.",
        "Teri: Ask him to leave, please.",
        "Janet: Can we please not take this out on Jack?",
        "Teri: I'm not taking anything out on him. But this is about our family. He's no longer a part of it.",
        "Janet: I think you better go.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I got that much.",
        "Janet: Listen, don't take it personally, okay? She's just hurting right now.",
        "Jack: No, I know. You still want me to go Melrose Park with you?",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Okay, as long as it's okay with Teri.",
        "Janet: I'll talk to her.",
        "Jack: Let me know.",
        "Janet: Okay. Jack -- thanks for making all the arrangements.",
        "Jack: You never have to thank me, Janet, ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hey, I was just gonna come see you.",
        "Craig: Lucky me.",
        "Dusty: I'd like to pick up Johnny from school and take him out for an ice cream.",
        "Craig: Today's not your day.",
        "Dusty: I was hoping I could trade you for another time.",
        "Craig: Nope.",
        "Dusty: Why not?",
        "Craig: 'Cause these rules are in place for a reason.",
        "Dusty: I just want to see him for an hour.",
        "Craig: What's wrong with you?",
        "Dusty: Janet's father died.",
        "Craig: I didn't know that.",
        "Dusty: It just happened.",
        "Craig: How's Janet?",
        "Dusty: How do you think? Can I pick up Johnny or what?",
        "Craig: Does she blame you for this?",
        "Dusty: I don't want to talk about this with you.",
        "Craig: Was it your fault?",
        "Dusty: What did I just say?",
        "Craig: She does blame you. Well, that's a tough break. There goes that regular life you were hoping for -- oh, and raising another child that wasn't yours.",
        "Dusty: What's your problem?",
        "Craig: Nothing. Really, Dusty, this is for the best. You're just not a white picket fence kind of guy.",
        "Dusty: Janet and I will be fine.",
        "Craig: You want to do what's right by Janet? Let her go. No, really, Janet and her kids will be a lot better off if they don't learn the truth about you the hard way.",
        "Dusty: What did you say? Would you kindly repeat that?",
        "Craig: Sure. What I'm saying is Janet just lost her father.",
        "Dusty: And what else?",
        "Craig: And apparently, you're to blame for it.",
        "Carly: Hey, hey. What is going on here?",
        "Dusty: Craig Montgomery's asking for it.",
        "Carly: Yeah, so, he always is. Why are you gonna give him exactly what he wants? And you -- I know why you're picking a fight with Dusty. And I'll tell you something, it's not gonna work.",
        "Craig: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Carly: Don't play games with me, Craig. I'm not in the mood.",
        "Craig: I think you're giving me too much credit.",
        "Carly: Dusty, haven't you known him long enough to see what he's doing?",
        "Dusty: He's giving me a good reason to do something drastic.",
        "Carly: Okay. And you're playing right into his hands.",
        "Dusty: Who cares?",
        "Carly: Won't Janet? Don't you want her to trust you?",
        "Dusty: She wants nothing to do with me.",
        "Carly: Well, that's not gonna change if you keep running around town, beating people up!",
        "Craig: Who can blame her when the man is clearly unstable? How could Janet possibly learn to trust you when the time comes that she actually needs you, and you run off on one of your crusades where somebody gets hurt or somebody dies or --",
        "Carly: All right, stop it!",
        "Dusty: No, it's all right. Let him talk. That's what he does best.",
        "Craig: I'm telling you the truth, Dusty, and you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Teri: I can't believe he's gone.",
        "Janet: I know. I feel like I missed out on so much, all the things we never said to each other. And we finally got a chance to reconnect.",
        "Teri: Hey, at least you got that chance, right? What if Pop had died before that had happened? He was glad it happened, too, Janet.",
        "Janet: Really? Was he? 'Cause I wasn't always so sure.",
        "Teri: You have no idea how much he missed you.",
        "Janet: And now I'm responsible for his death.",
        "Teri: No, you're not. What? Why do you think that?",
        "Janet: Yes, because I'm the reason he came to Oakdale. I'm the reason he met Dusty.",
        "Teri: No, he came to Oakdale because his granddaughter was sick. And I know you don't believe me right now, but you can't blame Dusty, either.",
        "Janet: Okay. I blame myself.",
        "Teri: Jan, it is not your fault that Pop went after the guy that tried to kill Dusty.",
        "Janet: I could have tried to stop him.",
        "Teri: Pop? Are you kidding? Once he gets something in his head, you can't talk him down.",
        "Janet: If only I got the chance, though.",
        "Teri: Do you know how many times I tried to convince him to reconnect with you? I had years, and it never got me anywhere.",
        "Janet: Yeah. He always was pretty stubborn.",

        "Janet: I can't, no.",
        "Teri: Why not?",
        "Janet: Because he scares me, Teresa, the way he goes charging off whenever he feels like it.",
        "Teri: He'll change for you.",
        "Janet: Okay, he'll promise to change. What's that worth?",

        "Janet: Oh, how did you find out?",
        "Liberty: Parker told me. Are you okay? This is so weird. You must be so --",
        "Janet: Sweetie, I am so sorry that you never got a chance to get to know your grandfather. He was a changed man, Liberty. He wasn't the same guy who turned his back on us so many years ago. He loved you, and he came to Oakdale because you were sick, and he wanted to help you. The doctor -- oh, my God. I forgot. I forgot about your appointment. What did the doctor say?",
        "Liberty: I'm done. No more chemo. The treatment's working. I'm getting better.",
        "Janet: Really? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, God, Baby, that's the best thing you could have told me.",

        "Carly: You want to convince Dusty that the best thing he can do is stay away from Janet.",
        "Craig: Why would I do that?",
        "Carly: Because if she's alone with everything she's got going on, Jack is not gonna leave her, and that leaves me --",
        "Craig: What, with me? Oh, if only that were true.",
        "Carly: Just a little while ago, you were practically begging me to give you another chance.",
        "Craig: But you're not going to, are you?",
        "Dusty: Of course she isn't.",
        "Craig: Janet just lost her father. Her daughter has cancer. And here you are, looking for trouble. Now, who does that leave her to turn to? Oh, that's right -- Jack. You don't need me to ruin your relationship. You're taking care of that all on your own.",
        "Dusty: I've had enough.",
        "Carly: You are amazing.",
        "Craig: Thank you. Oh, you don't mean that in a good way.",
        "Carly: Sometimes I do, because sometimes you can be a pretty great guy. But more often than not, Craig, you are a complete ass.",

        "Teri: Yeah, Mom, I'm okay. Jan, too. We're just really worried about you. Okay, well, maybe sure she stays with you until we get there. Yeah, Jan, too. It's gonna be okay, Mom. Don't worry. We'll see you soon.",
        "Janet: How is she?",
        "Teri: She's not good. Aunt Marie's with her, though.",
        "Janet: What did she say when you told her I was coming home?",
        "Teri: She said it was okay.",
        "Liberty: Mom, it will be okay.",
        "Teri: Okay, listen, what else do we have to do?",
        "Janet: Nothing. Jack's made all the arrangements. I signed the paper, and they're sending Pop's body home.",
        "Teri: Okay. Okay, listen, we should get going then. I have a few things I need to pick up.",
        "Liberty: How long will we be there?",
        "Janet: What? No, Liberty, I don't think you should go.",
        "Liberty: You don't want me there with you?",

        "Janet: Oh, please. They're gonna love you. But not as much as I do.",
        "Liberty: Then I'm coming.",
        "Janet: Okay. Well, then, we have to get something to wear, because we have nothing. So we'll stop by Fashions on the way home, and then we'll swing by, pick up Jack, and then we'll come and get you, okay?",
        "Teri: Jack's coming?",
        "Janet: Yeah. He doesn't want us to drive by ourselves.",
        "Teri: We're not by ourselves. There are three of us.",

        "Teri: Yeah, apparently he's back in the picture.",
        "Liberty: Why, because of the baby? What about Dusty?",
        "Teri: Your mom thinks that he is responsible for your grandfather's death, so she won't talk to him.",
        "Liberty: That's crazy.",
        "Teri: Yeah, I know. I tried to talk to her. I couldn't get through to her.",

        "Carly: It doesn't mean that you had to be the one to say it.",

        "Carly: You're coming at me now.",
        "Craig: Look, what amazes me is that it only took Janet a matter of months to realize that about Dusty, but you've had years, and you still don't understand that about Jack.",
        "Carly: What, your version of the truth?",
        "Craig: It's not an opinion. It's a fact. And the sooner you face it, the sooner you'll have a chance at a happy life.",

        "Janet: Because every time I look at you, I see my father, who was so stubborn and so sure of himself and does whatever he wants to do no matter how it affects other people, no matter how much it hurts them or hurts you. I can't live like that.",
