        "Ben: Curtis? Curtis, you here? Hmm. Guess he's still at work.",
        "Jessica: He is. I called from Dr. Schiller's office.",
        "Ben: Oh, you did?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ben: When?",
        "Jessica: When you were checking your messages. I thought, if no one was here, then maybe we could start as soon as we got home.",
        "Ben: Start?",
        "Jessica: Dr. Schiller said there shouldn't be a problem with me getting pregnant, so since it's what we both want, why wait?",
        "Ben: Oh, baby, I mean, you just took the test today. You don't want to wait until the results come back?",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, if I have a problem, we will deal with it then, but in the meantime --",
        "Ben: All right. Let's get to it.",
        "Jessica: \"Let's get to it?\" You sound like you're about to wax your car.",
        "Ben: Come on. Now, you know that's not what I meant.",
        "Jessica: Look, this is a special moment. I think that we should do something special to honor it.",
        "Ben: Hmm. Well, what'd you have in mind? Hmm?",
        "Jessica: Not that. No, while I was upstairs, I took the liberty of raiding the medicine cabinet, and I thought we'd start with a ritual -- the burning of the diaphragm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Also, the crew was late getting to that fire in Glenview. So we're going to hold that story until after the first commercial, okey-dokey?",
        "P.A.: All right, you got it.",
        "Kim: Let him know.",
        "Doc: Mrs. Hughes --",
        "Kim: Yeah?",
        "Doc: You got a sec?",
        "Kim: Sure, what can I do for you?",
        "Doc: Tell you what. Seeing that it's my first night on the air, I want to connect with the viewers right from the kickoff.",
        "Kim: Amen to that.",
        "Doc: I just know that I say things a lot better when I can say 'em, basically the way I say 'em.",
        "Kim: Yeah -- you're asking me if you can rewrite your copy?",
        "Doc: Boss lady, come on. I don't want to rewrite it, just doc it up a tad.",
        "Kim: I got to tell you, you were hired by this station because you're a unique personality. Anytime you can convey that better, be by guest.",
        "Doc: Well, thank you, Ms. Hughes.",
        "Kim: You're welcome.",
        "Doc: I knew you and I'd connect on that.",

        "Kim: Hi, hi.",
        "Chris: Hi. Doc all ready for his big debut?",
        "Kim: I certainly hope so. So, you came down here just to watch him do that?",
        "Chris: Well, no. There's something I need to talk to you about.",
        "Kim: Okay. Come on in here. What's up?",
        "Chris: Well, it's about what you said to Alison this morning at breakfast. I know that you meant well, but --",
        "Kim: You came down here to talk about -- Christopher, all I said was that I had concerns about the kind of hours you've been working. I certainly -- I mean, I certainly didn't mean to upset her or make her feel guilty.",
        "Chris: Well, you did, Mom. Okay, Alison is a lot more sensitive than she lets on.",
        "Kim: Let me get this straight. Did Alison complain about what I said?",
        "Chris: No, no. This is my issue. But from now on, I just want you to be a little more careful about what you say to her. Okay? Especially when it's about me.",
        "Kim: I'll do my best.",
        "Chris: Thank you. I knew I could count on you.",

        "Molly: Aaron, hey. We're short on wait staff, so call Alison and tell her to come in as soon as she can.",
        "Aaron: What if she can't?",
        "Molly: She'll come anyway, or she'll lose her job.",

        "Alison: Hello?",
        "Aaron: Alison, listen, it's me.",
        "Alison: I can't talk to you right now, Aaron. I'm in the middle of burning something special for Chris.",
        "Aaron: Look, we're down a waitress at Metro. Molly wants you to come in.",
        "Alison: Now? I -- it can't happen.",
        "Aaron: Why not?",
        "Alison: Because I'm in the middle of planning a special dinner with Chris.",
        "Aaron: Alison, I would seriously rethink that.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Aaron: Why? So far, you've only had one day of training. If you don't show up, Molly's gonna think that you're not serious about this job. Okay? Do you want her to go out and find somebody that is?",
        "Alison: Um -- I'll be there.",
        "Aaron: Atta girl. All right, I gotta go. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi, is this Chick? This is Violet Palmer. From open mike night. Hi, yes. Yeah, I was wondering -- I was gonna be in Chicago tonight. I was wondering if maybe I could be on stage tonight and sing? Great. Okay. I'll be there in a few hours. And thank you.",
        "Dusty: Hey.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Dusty: Guess who I was just calling.",
        "Lily: Me?",
        "Dusty: Are we on the same wavelength or what?",
        "Lily: Dusty, look, I need to ask you --",
        "Dusty: Don't you want to know why I was calling?",
        "Lily: Yes, of course. Sorry.",
        "Dusty: There's this guy -- there's this guy in Milwaukee, self-made man, made his fortune in the cheese business.",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. He wants to give us a huge donation, but he just -- he needs to see us in person first.",
        "Lily: Wow. Okay, great. Set it up for next week.",
        "Dusty: I told him we'd be there tonight.",
        "Lily: Tonight? I can't.",
        "Dusty: What do you mean you can't? We're talking five figures. Let's not give him a chance to change his mind.",
        "Lily: I have personal business in Chicago tonight, so --",
        "Dusty: Me and the cheese guy, yeah, I guess he could let things ferment for a while. Is that what you're thinking?",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: I'll tell him you got a tropical bug or something.",
        "Lily: Okay. Um, I need a favor.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Lily: I -- I'm leaving Holden a note telling him that I need to go to Chicago for business for the Rose Foundation. And I was hoping you would back me up on that.",
        "Dusty: You want me to lie to him.",
        "Lily: I know you don't want to do it, but, please, can you just please just cover for me this one time? And I give you my word. I will never ask again. Please? Please, this is really important to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay. \"Dear, Chris, I hope that you like your dinner. I put it in the containers in the fridge. I'm going -- to the movies with Emily and my Mom. I can't wait to see you. Love, me.\"",
        "Chris: Hey, Ali, wow. I'm so glad you're here. We can hang out till I have go back to work.",

        "Molly: Did you call Alison?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, she's on her way.",
        "Molly: Well, she's sure taking her sweet time.",
        "Curtis: Has Doc Reese shown up?",
        "Aaron: No, I haven't seen him. What's the problem?",
        "Curtis: He said he'd pay me back for covering his bar bill with my credit card. I figured he'd be here by now.",
        "Aaron: Maybe he forgot.",
        "Curtis: Man, I hope not. I just want to pay this thing off early, so Ben doesn't see that number and freak out.",
        "Aaron: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Doesn't -- doesn't doc start working at the TV station?",
        "Curtis: You're right. I heard something about that. Well, you don't have the number, do you? That's okay. I'll look it up.",
        "Aaron: Hey, Curtis -- hey, you know you do work here, man. I need some help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Hey, I must be having a bad face day. You're not done, yet, doll baby? Now, I need a couple of minutes to look over my copy and \"docasize\" it.",
        "Stylist: You're perfect.",
        "Doc: Thank you, darlin'.",
        "P.A.: Phone call for you, doc. Line one. They said it's urgent.",
        "Doc: Gotcha. Doc Reese on the horn. Talk to me.",
        "Curtis: Doc, it's Curtis Harris. From the other night at metro?",
        "Doc: Hey, Curtis, how are you, my man? What can I do for you?",
        "Curtis: Well, I was wondering about that money. You said you'd drop it off today.",
        "Doc: Oh, man, right. The money, the problem with my credit card. I forgot all about that. Are you still at work, Curtis?",
        "Curtis: Just started my shift.",
        "Doc: You know what? I'll be right there.",
        "Kim: Doc, something we can get for you?",
        "Doc: Just got a quick errand to run, boss, but don't worry your pretty little head. I'll be back in plenty of time for the show.",
        "Kim: Don't worry my \"pretty little head\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Instead of burning this, maybe we should just put it away for a while, okay?",
        "Jessica: Why? You think I'm gonna change my mind?",
        "Ben: Hey, it could happen. And if it did --",
        "Jessica: It won't. It won't, Ben. I have asked myself all the hard questions. And I am not going into this blindly. I want to have a baby, another baby, your baby. And whatever sacrifices that entails, I will make them.",
        "Ben: Now, you're not in this on your own. We're both gonna be raising these kids.",
        "Jessica: And that's still okay with you? Because after tonight, there may be no turning back. [Phone rings] Don't answer it.",
        "Ben: It could be the hospital.",
        "Jessica: All right, I'll get it. I'm a good doctor's wife. Hello? Yes, Dr. Harris is in. May I ask who's calling? Hold on, please. It's your bank. Something about your credit card.",
        "Ben: Hello, this is Dr. Harris. What? He charged how much? All right, now, where did he charge this? Yeah. Yeah, go ahead and approve it. Thank you. You remember that credit card that I gave Curtis in case of emergencies?",
        "Jessica: Yes and the understanding was that he wouldn't use it unless he called you.",
        "Ben: Well, he sure didn't call me about this.",
        "Jessica: About what?",
        "Ben: A bar bill at Metro for a couple hundred dollars.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily?",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Holden: Lucinda, hi.",
        "Lucinda: Hi.",
        "Holden: Was Lily expecting you?",
        "Lucinda: No, she's avoiding me, so I have dropped by unannounced. I want to know how she's riding out the rising tide of her triumph after the Rose Foundation benefit.",
        "Holden: She's been doing very well.",
        "Lucinda: Uh-huh.",
        "Holden: But unfortunately, she's not here to tell you that herself.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I can wait. Will she be back soon?",
        "Holden: I don't know. I don't know where she is. I just got home from work.",
        "Lucinda: She doesn't leave little notes? She doesn't leave messages on your cell phone?",
        "Holden: I guess she was in a hurry.",
        "Lucinda: All right, darling, I'm glad that we're alone, and I can just say it out loud. I've really been very concerned about the pair of you.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, we're fine. We're fine. We had a talk and got everything out in the open. In some ways, we're closer now than we were before.",
        "Lucinda: In some ways you are, in other ways what? My mother's intuition is telling me things are not so simple around here as you are describing them.",
        "Holden: Okay. I think that Lily might be hiding something.",
        "Lucinda: Is there any reason you know?",
        "Holden: She went to Chicago to do something for the Rose Foundation, and she came home very late. And when she realized that she left her cell phone behind, she decided that she was gonna go back there the very same night.",
        "Lucinda: And didn't give any explanation about why it couldn't wait till morning.",
        "Holden: I didn't want to ask. I didn't want her to think that I didn't trust her. But it bothered me. Still does.",
        "Dusty: I told you this before. If you want to lie to your husband, don't ask me to be a part of it, okay?",
        "Lily: I am not lying to Holden. I am -- I'm just not telling him what I've been up to. But that's it. At this point, I don't want to tell him.",
        "Dusty: What are you doing? You got some guy in Chicago? Huh? That's ringing your chains?",
        "Lily: Oh, with that again. No. Will you stop? Where did you come up with this idea?",
        "Dusty: You're telling me that's out of the question?",
        "Lily: I love Holden. I'm not looking at any other man. I just want to go to Chicago alone for one night. That's it. That's all this is.",
        "Dusty: Then why don't you tell Holden that? He's a reasonable guy. He'll understand.",
        "Lily: Yeah, he is, but, you know, we've been through so much. And now, after all of that, he would worry. If he knew I was going to Chicago alone, he would worry.",
        "Dusty: He doesn't trust you. And after listening to what you're saying, I don't blame the guy.",
        "Lily: I'm trying to protect him. I'm tying to protect my marriage. Is that so difficult for you to understand? Come on, I'm not asking for the moon, here. Why are you giving me such a hard time?",
        "Dusty: I don't know. Maybe because I don't believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You're not eating?",
        "Alison: I already had some.",
        "Chris: Mm. Did I just taste a water chestnut?",
        "Alison: I know how much you like them.",
        "Chris: Come here.",
        "Alison: Why?",
        "Chris: I want to thank you for making me dinner. You know, with my new schedule, I hardly get a chance to sit while I'm eating.",
        "Alison: And that's why I made you your casserole, but, I mean, you don't really want to overdo it, because it's kind of rich.",
        "Chris: Alison, I'm not finished.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but, you know, if you eat too much, you're gonna get really tired when you get to work.",
        "Chris: That's a good point. You know, I stopped by my mother's work and had a talk with her on the way home.",
        "Alison: About what? Chris, I asked you not to.",
        "Chris: I know. I know you did, but I'm really glad. Because she has to realize, Alison, that she can't go around lecturing you like you're some irresponsible kid, okay, who needs to be pushed into doing the right thing. You're a woman now. You're a woman that I love and trust with all my heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Patron: Yo, Doc Reese! Ah, man, you're my favorite ball player of all-time.",
        "Doc: Guess that makes you my all-time favorite fan.",
        "Patron: Thanks, man.",
        "Doc: My apologies, Curtis. I mean, I do love the game, but football has not been kind to my brain cells.",
        "Curtis: Is this the money?",
        "Doc: Couldn't let another minute go by, knowing I owed it to you, man.",
        "[Curtis sighs]",
        "Curtis: Thanks a lot. Aren't you supposed to be on TV or something?",
        "Doc: I got a car waiting outside. If traffic cooperates, I should be cool.",
        "Aaron: Curtis -- Pops.",
        "Curtis: Hey, Dad, what's up?",
        "Ben: What's up is the balance on your credit card bill.",
        "Curtis: How'd you find out?",
        "Ben: I just got a call from the bank.",
        "Curtis: Look, I know it's for emergencies only. But --",
        "Ben: You stay right there. I want to talk to you about this in person.",
        "Curtis: Dad, no! I -- I'll come home and explain everything.",
        "Ben: What? In the middle of your shift?",
        "Curtis: No one'll miss me. It's a really slow night. I'll be there as soon as I can.",
        "Doc: You okay, buddy?",
        "Curtis: Yeah, I'm cool. I gotta go home for awhile.",
        "Aaron: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Molly is not going to like that.",
        "Curtis: Neither am I. Thanks, Doc.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: Is Doc back yet?",
        "Stylist: Any message if he calls in?",
        "Kim: Message? You can tell him if he's not in his seat when we go on the air, this is going to be the shortest job he's ever had.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: I want to know what kind of so-called \"friend\" runs up a bar tab for $357.42, and then puts the pinch on you to pay for it? That's not the kind of friend I want you to have, Curtis!",
        "Curtis: Nobody put the pinch on me.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Jessica: Um -- I'll get it.",
        "Ben: I'm not finished with you.",
        "Jessica: Mr. Reese --",
        "Doc: I hope I'm not disturbing you, Mrs. Harris, but would it be all right if I came in?",
        "Jessica: Of course. Come in, come in.",
        "Ben: Doc Reese. What are you doing here?",
        "Doc: I didn't want the boy taking the blame for what happened. Him running up that credit card bill was my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, dear. I'm always right about Lily. I am. But you -- you, you don't trust Lily as much as you claim to.",
        "Holden: I trust Lily as much as ever. The problem is, I don't think she trusts me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. How not? What?",
        "Holden: Used to be that she could tell me anything. Now, after everything we've been through, I don't think she feels that way anymore.",
        "Lucinda: And have you given her any reason to doubt you?",
        "Holden: Yeah, only a couple of hundred of them. And now I'm paying the price.",
        "[Lucinda chuckles]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, honey, none of this mess is your fault.",
        "Holden: This -- the whole thing is my fault.",
        "Lucinda: No, it's not your fault because it takes two to tango, for God sake! It takes two to play tennis and if she doesn't hit the ball back, the game's over!",
        "Holden: Lucinda, we -- we had this faith that could not be shaken.",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Holden: Our whole relationship was built on it. It was our foundation. I miss that. I want that back. Only, the way things are going, I don't think that's going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Hey. As you know, I didn't go to college. I don't even have a favorite book. But I do know when somebody's lying to me. And you're doing a really bad job.",
        "Lily: What difference does it make why I'm going to Chicago? Come on. If Holden calls, just tell him I went on business for the Rose Foundation.",
        "Dusty: And when he finds out the truth? I'm not doing it. I'm not signing up for those problems. And another thing -- I'm getting a little tired of you using the foundation as your personal getaway.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Dusty: Your getaway. You know, from you husband and your kids. Every time you take off, you use the foundation as an excuse.",
        "Lily: No, that's not true.",
        "Dusty: Yes it is true. And I want it to stop. You can sneak around Chicago all you want behind your husband's back, don't use the foundation to cover your tracks. You hear me?",
        "Molly: Give him five minutes. He'll be back to apologize.",
        "Lily: Were you eavesdropping on me?",
        "Molly: No. No, I can just recognize an argument when I see one.",
        "Lily: I -- I just asked Dusty to run a little interference for Holden and me. He didn't want to do it. No interest. That's all.",
        "Molly: A word of advice from somebody who has no right to give it?",
        "Lily: Sure. Why not?",
        "Molly: Why do you constantly feel like you have to set up roadblocks between you and Holden? Lily, that man loves you with everything he's got. So whatever you're hiding from him, I am sure he'll understand.",
        "Lily: Hopefully you're right. [Cell phone rings] That's me. Sorry. Shoot. Ah! Hello? Hello? [Lily sighs] Holden. Probably looking for me. So much for making plans. Thank you. Good-bye.",
        "Molly: Bye. The Windy City Cafe.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: Doc, you're a superstar, man. How do you wind up letting a 17-year-old kid pay your bar tab?",
        "Doc: No excuse is going to make sense or even matter. It was wrong, and I sincerely apologize.",
        "Jessica: What about paying the money back?",
        "Curtis: He already did.",
        "Doc: I took the money down to Curtis at the Metro. And it's in cash. So, there's no need to worry about my check.",
        "Ben: So, you were there when I just called?",
        "Doc: Yeah. I just didn't want Curtis getting in trouble on my account. You got a good son there, Dr. Harris. You must be very, very proud.",
        "Ben: Yeah, he's all right. But, look, do me a favor -- next time you need a loan, find somebody else.",
        "Doc: Fair enough. No hard feelings?",

        "Alison: Yeah, but -- but you have a rough schedule, and --",
        "Chris: That's exactly my point, Ali. With my work schedule, who knows when we'll get a chance to do this again? So what do you say? I'll race you upstairs?",
        "Alison: Ah -- Chris, you know -- I'm just kind of -- I'm just not in the mood.",
        "Chris: What do you mean you're not in the mood? Your cheeks are totally flushed. You can barely catch your breath. Either you're having an asthma attack, or you are definitely in the mood.",

        "Lily: Why do you ask?",
        "Holden: Because I love you. And I know that things are better between us. And I just want you to know that we don't have to live some fantasy life now. If you have a problem or if there's something that troubles you, I want you to know that you can talk to me about it. You don't have to worry that I'm going to freak out and be afraid that things are going to go back to the way they were after Rose died.",

If I can't be honest, at least I'll make up a story that's even better than the truth. So let's get to it. The Lakers -- are down to the Hawks, 98-93. The Knicks over the Grizzlies, 95-81. And the Celtics were thrashed by the Pistons, 105-82. Now get out the first aid kits, people, because the Bulls were in New Orleans last night \u0096",
