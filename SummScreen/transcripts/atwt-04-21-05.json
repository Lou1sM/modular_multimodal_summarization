        "Will: 'Cause I know it's gotta be hard with Aaron being gone, so if you need anything, just ask me.",
        "Alison: No, I've got everything under control. You should go hang out with your friends.",
        "Will: My what? Who?",
        "Alison: Well, I am sure that you have one or two. They're probably at Al's right now.",
        "Will: Really, you're sure? You'd call if you needed anything, right?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I would, of course, yes. Go. Oh, thank goodness you're here. I've been so scared. I don't know what to do. I tried calling Aaron three times, and he hasn't answered and that's not like him.",
        "Holden: I know. He'll call you later.",
        "Alison: You've heard from him?",

        "Luke: I got a message that you were in the emergency room.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm fine. I told you that.",
        "Luke: Well, I know. But you don't always tell me the whole story.",
        "Lily: Right. I'm just waiting here for Keith. That's all.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Lily: Oh, it's been a very, very long night. You know how Les was trying to get custody of J.J.?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Okay, well, J.J. was at Carly and Jack's, Les came and he took J.J. and Carly tried to stop Les, and he knocked her unconscious.",
        "Luke: Oh, my God.",
        "Lily: I know. But we followed him. We followed Les in his car. His tire blowout, he ran off the road, and he went to the old mill, and he stabbed Keith.",
        "Luke: Well, is he okay?",
        "Lily: He's gonna be fine. Just a couple of stitches. It could've been a lot worse, but there's -- there's big news about Les. They arrested him for Julia's murder.",
        "Luke: Wait. Hold on, wait, wait. So the police know for sure and they've got him?",
        "Lily: Yes. You and I are cleared of all murder charges. It's over.",

        "Dusty: What's so urgent?",
        "Paul: I needed to talk to you tonight. I figured Craig's going to come after you next.",

        "Paul: No. Gone gone.",
        "Dusty: As in forever? Packed up and gone?",
        "Paul: Yes. And I, for one, am glad. She and Mike were only, like, three steps ahead of Craig. Craig just found out that -- well, he knows about the baby.",
        "Dusty: Oh! That's super.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and he would've made her life a living hell if she'd stayed in town.",
        "Dusty: She left before he found out? Before she even knew there'd be a problem, she hit the hills?",
        "Paul: Yew, thank God. She's pregnant with Craig's baby. She had to know there'd be a problem eventually. At least, this way, she can raise that child and keep it away from Craig Montgomery.",

        "Craig: We should be landing soon.",

        "Katie: Oh, no. Oh, no. I am sticking like glue to you.",

        "Katie: Maybe, Craig.",
        "Craig: Why else would she lie about her due date, okay? We all know what's going on here.",
        "Katie: No, you do not know. And I'm gonna keep reminding you that you don't know.",
        "Craig: Jennifer and Mike Kasnoff snuck out of town only to hide their due date from me. [Katie sighs] Okay?",
        "Katie: What is that?",
        "Craig: This is a list of wedding chapels in the greater Las Vegas area.",
        "Katie: Oh, good. There's hundreds of them.",
        "Craig: Uh-huh, I'll find 'em.",

        "Jennifer: Do we have a signature theme song?",
        "Mike: Let's just go with the standard. The usual is fine.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Meat and potatoes kind of folks.",

        "Luke: Where's Keith? I want to thank him.",
        "Lily: He's probably sleeping. They gave him a very sedative so they can stitched him up.",
        "Luke: And this les guy? He's in jail -- you're sure about that?",
        "Lily: I'm sure.",
        "Luke: What about the police? They could still charge us for something. I mean, we both lied.",
        "Lily: I know that. What we did was absolutely wrong. It was obstruction of justice. There are going to be some consequences.",
        "Luke: We could still go to jail.",
        "Lily: But they know. They understand why we did what we did. I'm just hoping for suspended sentences. [Luke sighs] Oh, I know, I know, I know. It takes a while for all this to sink in, but it's over.",
        "Luke: God. I really thought you would have to go to jail.",
        "Lily: Me, too.",
        "Luke: I was so scared.",
        "Lily: I know, I was so scared. I was so scared. We just thought we were doing what was right. Protecting each other. You know, we really came very close to blowing it.",
        "Luke: We would've been okay, Mom. Even though we were on our own, we still did okay.",
        "Lily: We had a lot of help. We're very lucky. We can never forget that. We have --",
        "Luke: Let's talk about the people we didn't have. Because he walked out on us.",
        "Lily: You're talking about your father, obviously.",
        "Luke: The one person who should've helped us the most was the one person who completely let us down.",

        "Holden: Aaron is fine and he will call you later. He only had time to make one call today, so he called me because he had to give me the news.",
        "Alison: So, what is it?",
        "Holden: His mom. She's not getting any better.",
        "Alison: Are they sure?",
        "Holden: Yeah. They think that maybe she only has six months, a year.",
        "Alison: Oh, no. His whole family must be freaking.",
        "Holden: Yeah, they are. Especially Caleb. So, he's gonna need Aaron, and Aaron's prepared to be there for him.",
        "Alison: So what does that mean, exactly?",
        "Holden: It means that he's not going to be coming home any time soon. He needs to help out with the family. He needs to see his mother for the time that she has left.",
        "Alison: Yes, of course. Sure.",
        "Holden: I need to head over to the hospital to see Lily. Are you going to be okay?",
        "Alison: Me? Please, I'm fine. I just feel so bad for Aaron and his family. This is a nightmare.",
        "Holden: Yeah, it is. But, they're gonna through it.",
        "Alison: Thank you so much for stopping by. I was getting really worried there.",
        "Holden: If you need anything, you call me, okay? Okay.",
        "Alison: I guess I better get real good at managing this place -- alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're sister's gone. You might not see her again. And you're smiling.",
        "Paul: I'm okay with this, all right? My sister got out. She's away from here, she's away from my family. She can have a real life. What's not to be okay with?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. You're right. It's a beautiful thing. We should celebrate. Where's the champagne?",
        "Paul: Oh, Dusty, come on.",
        "Dusty: Worldwide is out millions for backing your sister's company!",
        "Paul: Street Jeans is gonna be fine. Okay, we'll find a new designer. We'll back that designer the way we were gonna back my sister. And, who knows? Maybe once Jennifer's settled down somewhere, she can smuggle us some designs.",
        "Dusty: We're gonna pay a courier for her to ship her designs to us? Give me a break.",
        "Paul: Okay, look, I know it's not ideal, but we can make this work.",
        "Dusty: You have any idea how serious this is?",
        "Paul: I know what really matter.",
        "Dusty: Do you?",
        "Paul: Jennifer needs to keep that baby away from Craig. Nothing else matters.",

        "Craig: Elvis chapel? Too black velvet.",
        "Katie: You know, Craig, if you cared about me at all, you would just stop all this and go home.",
        "[Craig laughs]",
        "Craig: The in and out chapel? Too burger joint.",
        "Katie: I made one horrible mistake and it's like you're punishing me for it.",
        "Craig: Excuse me?",
        "Katie: I never meant to let you know what I knew, and now you're taking this one little mistake that I made and you're using it against me. Is that fair?",
        "Craig: Bingo! Palace of happiness.",
        "Katie: Why that one?",
        "Craig: Well, first of all, come on. Second of all, Rosanna and Jordan got married there. Jennifer knows it. She's in a rush. She's not gonna be comparison shopping.",
        "Katie: You're just guessing.",
        "Craig: I make educated guesses.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but you could be wrong. What then?",
        "Craig: Yeah, what then?",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Craig: You're not fooling anybody.",
        "Katie: Excuse me?",
        "Craig: Come on, you want something to bust up this wedding.",
        "Katie: That is so not true.",
        "Craig: Umm-hmm.",
        "Katie: If you bust up Mike and Jennifer's wedding because of something that I said, I will never forgive myself.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. More to the point, Mike will never forgive you. That's what got you all in a twist.",
        "Katie: I can't believe this is happening. I never meant for this to happen. I thought you could be trusted, Craig.",
        "Craig: What does that mean? Does that mean roll over and not take responsibility for my child? You've known I was coming after Jennifer and Mike. C'mon.",
        "Katie: I thought you would at least be decent about it if this is your baby, Craig. If, if anything, it is a baby that's growing inside a woman who can't stand you.",
        "Craig: Nothing new there. I'm used to that.",
        "Katie: No, all you're used to is making a mews of things and screwing up people's lives. All right? That's all you know how to do. I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Craig: All right. I believe you. But if I don't stop the wedding, you can't cry.",
        "Katie: Oh! Would you get over it, Craig? I am a happily married woman, and I want Mike to be a happily married man, if that's what he and Jennifer want.",
        "Craig: If? Finally, all right. Listen, I don't mind doing your dirty work --",
        "Katie: Stop saying that!",
        "Craig: But my only concern here is this child.",
        "Flight attendant #2: Ladies and gentlemen, we will be landing shortly. Please check to see that your seatbelts are securely fastened.",

        "Mr. Lovejoy: We are gathered here today to join Jennifer Munson and Michael Kasnott in holy matrimony --",
        "Mike: Kasnoff.",
        "Mr. Lovejoy: Excuse me?",
        "Mike: Kasnoff.",
        "Mr. Lovejoy: Oh, sorry.",
        "Mike: Right.",
        "Mr. Lovejoy: Want to get things legal here, don't we? Michael Kasnoff and Jennifer Munson in holy matrimony. Marriage is a sacred bond, not to be entered into lightly, but reverently and deliberately. If any of you can show just cause why they may not be married, speak now or forever hold your peace. Now for the vows. Michael Kasnoff, do you promise to love honor and --",
        "Mike: Would you mind if I said something personal here? My own vows?",
        "Mrs. Lovejoy: Oh, yes.",
        "Mr. Lovejoy: It's your marriage. We're good for another half hour.",
        "Mike: Great. [Mike sighs] Jennifer Munson, you are so beautiful. And I know this isn't the time or place or the way that we would've done this under ordinary circumstances but, I couldn't love you any more than I do right now. And I couldn't mean these vows any more than I do. I promise you that we will share a lifetime of beautiful things. Including that miracle you've already created. I love everything about you. Everything that you bring with you. Because it's a part of you. And I can't wait to start our lives together. I love you. I will cherish and protect you. And celebrate every day that we have together.",
        "Jennifer: My turn? Okay. Mike Kasnoff, you are more than I ever dreamed I could ever have. You are it. And I mean that little girl prince charming dream, right up through the grown-up version of it where you know that life can be random and cruel, and you know that you can be a mess, but you still want someone right there who will make everything all right. And, Mike, you make everything all right. You go so far beyond. And you are so much more generous and more loving and more fun than anyone has a right to expect. Especially me. Given everything that's happened in my life, everything that's gotten me here. I am so amazed and grateful to see you standing there. I don't deserve you. It's as simple as that. But I want to spend the rest of our lives making up for that. I will love you, and cherish and protect you. And I will celebrate our life together, but most of all, everyday, I will celebrate you.",
        "Mr. Lovejoy: Do you have a ring? Rings are a symbol of your unbreakable bond and devotion. Take her hand, repeat after me. \"With this ring I thee wed.\"",

        "Will: That's a lie.",
        "Alison: No, really. I mean, I'm not -- I'm not great, but I'm okay.",
        "Will: Alison, go ahead. It's okay. There's no one but me and you. You can cry, scream, throw something, whatever.",
        "Alison: I just feel like such a weenie.",
        "Will: You're the strongest person I know.",
        "Alison: No, I don't feel so tough right now.",
        "Will: That's 'cause you're not tough. That's why you can cry and stuff. But you're strong. And that's way better.",
        "Alison: And how about selfish and scared? Do you like them, too? Holden was telling me all about Aaron's family and all of the horrible things that they're going through, and all I could think was what about was me. When is Aaron coming home to me? Isn't that awful?",
        "Will: No. It's normal. What are you scared of?",
        "Alison: Guess.",
        "Will: Well, forget about that. If Aaron were gone for ten years, it would just make him love you more.",
        "Alison: Do you think?",
        "Will: No, I know. And if he were here, he'd say the same thing. He'd look into your eyes and he'd tell you how much he loves you.",
        "Alison: I need to hear that.",
        "Will: You do. You should. Like, everyday.",
        "Alison: You're right. I could look into Aaron's eyes, and hear him say those words, I would feel much better. I'm gonna go to Seattle.",

        "Paul: Craig thinks Jennifer's in Mexico.",
        "Dusty: Is she?",
        "Paul: No. You found this thing that I planted for him to find is an itinerary for some other trip.",
        "Dusty: Oh. I told Jennifer I would personally see to it that Craig stayed off her back.",
        "Paul: Yeah, how were you going to do that? You couldn't even keep Lucy from Craig.",
        "Dusty: Craig's her father.",
        "Paul: Exactly, and that's what Jennifer had to look forward to. A lifetime of Craig doing horrible things to their child. If you ask me, I'm glad she took my advice, I think she got out just in time.",
        "Dusty: Your advice is running away? That figures.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on. What, are you going to make this about you and me?",
        "Dusty: Nope. It's about business.",
        "Paul: Business is business, Dusty. Companies come, companies go. So what? You really think that's what matters?",
        "Dusty: It's the only reason you and me are back in the same room.",
        "Paul: No, no, no, no. This is personal for you, too. You wanted a shot at Craig, that's why you took this gig.",
        "Dusty: Oh, you think so?",
        "Paul: No, I think all of a sudden, you fell in love with the fashion industry. Look, we can still do this, okay? We can still go head-to-head with Craig. I would love to see him out of business.",
        "Dusty: With what? What are we going to use?",
        "Paul: I don't know. We'll figure it out. The important thing is that Jennifer and her kid got away and they can have a life. And that's all that matters to me. She has to be able to get away from this family curse.",
        "Dusty: Worldwide is hemorrhaging money because of your sister, but you don't give a damn. Because someone always cleans up after the Ryan kids. Not this time.",

        "Katie: Craig, please, is there anything I can say, anything I can do to make you leave mike and Jennifer alone? Please?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Katie: Please?",
        "Craig: It didn't have to be this way.",
        "Katie: No, it didn't.",
        "Craig: If Mike and Jennifer had been honest with me --",
        "Katie: You don't know if they were honest or not, Craig, because you still don't know the truth. Just remember that. And how's this? If you find Mike and Jennifer, just wait. Don't make a scene.",
        "Craig: We're just going to have a nice, little chat at everyone's convenience.",
        "Katie: And don't stop the wedding.",
        "Craig: Oh, no, don't stop the wedding, don't stop Mike from committing himself to someone other than you.",
        "Katie: Oh, you are so impossible.",
        "Craig: So are you, okay? I love you, all right? You've got a nice act going here, but I know. Remember? I remember everything. I knew you when you wouldn't stop at anything to get what you wanted.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I've changed. That was a long time ago.",
        "Craig: Yeah, you're smarter. You're getting your big brother to do all the heavy lifting. It's all right, I don't mind. I don't mind. I probably owe you one, anyway. It's all right, you just show up, act surprised and help mike pick up the pieces.",
        "Katie: That is not what I want.",
        "Craig: Okay, well, then you can turn around and go home since Mike Kasnoff is no longer your concern.",

        "Dusty: What are you talking about, you're managing this place while Aaron's gone.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and you can count on me 100%, but only not for a few days. Rafael is going to cover for me, it's all set, okay?",

        "Dusty: Yep.",
        "Sierra: I didn't know that she and Mike wanted to start a family. But don't be silly, she can still work while she's pregnant. I mean, I did with both my pregnancies, and Mike is a pretty great guy, but he'd be a lot more helpful than Craig ever was. What?",
        "Dusty: Let's have a seat.",
        "Sierra: Why?",
        "Dusty: Come on, let's sit down. Not only is Jennifer not working, she left town. And she's never coming back.",

        "Luke: Well, you cut him too much slack.",
        "Lily: All right, you know, I just know. I mean, I cannot count the number of times and ways that I have given your father reason to doubt me. So many times. I've given him much more grief than he's ever given me.",
        "Luke: So what, you keep score now?",
        "Lily: No, I'm just remembering, that's all.",
        "Luke: It's like you forgot what he did to you.",
        "Lily: No, I don't. I just remember more. And I think you're old enough to understand this now, but what your father did, walking out like that -- sometimes, people can be married, live under the same roof, sit across from each other and not really be there. That's kind of what I did to your father.",

        "Luke: Did you do this?",
        "Lily: I called him when I called you.",

        "Sierra: That is never going to work.",
        "Dusty: Of course not. Look, worldwide has made good on its initial investment. Montgomery outsold us with those stolen designs, with Jennifer still in place. You understand? My advice? Call it a day.",

        "Jennifer: How on earth did you get a hold of my medical file?",
