        "Chris, Allison, Sophie and Aaron meet up for an awkward dinner. Paul and Mike clash over Mike taking the hot air balloon ride with Meg, which upsets Meg. Lily has high hopes for her and Holden's dinner with Carly and Jack. Meg doesn't understand why Paul is reacting so poorly so Paul leaves. Jack notices how beautiful Carly looks, which makes Carly hopeful, as well as Sage. Chris and Aaron can't help but annoy one another. Jack notices Lily's romantic dinner set up and isn't too thrilled. Carly starts drinking. Mike notices the champagne lunch and realizes why Paul is so upset. Sophie sees Paul looking depressed and excuses herself from the dinner, but he blows her off. She rejoins dinner only to excuse herself again under the pretense of having to check in by phone with Barbara. Mike tells Meg to not make the same mistake he did with Katie; he tells her not to give up if there is something still there between her and Paul. Sophie shows up at Paul's and wants to help. Paul explains what happened with Meg and Sophie is irate that Meg would treat him like that claiming he deserves better, as she takes his hand a moment before Meg interrupts. Paul sends Sophie on her way. Aaron realizes Sophie has left the Lakeview. Lily tries to be subtle, but it is not working, as Carly drinks more. Finally, Lily casts aside subtlety and tells Jack how she really feels about what he is doing, which doesn't help and only makes Carly more angry with Jack by his response leading her to scream at him. Paul and Meg talk through their problems; they discuss Mike and Sophie as well. Sophie comes back and Aaron is annoyed as she lies about where she was. Aaron wants to leave and Sophie goes with him, as he later tells her to stop lying to him. Sophie tells the partial truth, which leads Aaron to wonder if they have anything between them since she is lying to him. Holden checks on Carly and makes her feel better. Carly wishes to start the dinner over, but before Jack can agree, Parker calls with news that the babysitter is sick. Meg and Paul share kisses as they are back on track. Paul gets a call from the balloon company asking how his trip went? Paul promises himself that he won't let Mike do anything like that again. Meg thanks Mike for his advice \u0096 she and Paul are better. Carly wants to talk, but Jack thinks she has done enough talking that night. Carly is incensed by the way he dismisses her. Lily and Holden talk about her trying to help with Carly and Jack. Holden tells her that she wouldn't be her if she didn't help those she loves. He hopes he stays at the top of that list of people she loves. After Lily leaves, Holden finds the bag that Lily stashed away with a few of Dusty's belongings that she couldn't part with."

        "Mike: Oh, that was fantastic.",
        "Meg: It was! I had so much fun!",
        "Paul: Yeah, I thought it might be fun.",
        "Meg: Hey, Paul! What are you doing here? Did you see --?",
        "Mike: Woah, what -- what is your problem?",
        "Meg: Hey. Hey, hey, Paul, stop!",
        "Paul: You hijack my balloon, you hijack my idea, my --",
        "Meg: You're what, Paul? Just what else do you think belongs to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hope you brought an appetite.",
        "Aaron: You know I did.",
        "Chris: You look great, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: Thank you.",
        "Chris: I hope you guys like white wine. I found a nice bottle of pouilly fuisse on the menu.",
        "Aaron: Sounds a bit rich for my blood.",
        "Chris: Hardly. In fact, the first time I drank it was in a rundown bistro that would make Yo's look fancy.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, maybe in Paris, but here at the Lakeview, they charge an arm and leg, so maybe I should take a look at the menu and get something closer to reality.",
        "Chris: I already ordered it. Only because I'm the one that did the inviting. Next time, your turn. And we'll drink whatever you choose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: We had no idea that you were the one that ordered the balloon.",
        "Meg: You never said a thing.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that's how a surprise is supposed to work, Meg.",
        "Meg: Why would you even do something like this?",
        "Paul: Oh, I don't know. I thought I'd do something that you didn't expect me to do. Thought it was a romantic gesture.",
        "Meg: Paul, that is romantic. And sweet.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm sorry about ruining your big moment. It was just a big misunderstanding. The guy showed up with a balloon, he has no idea who it's for -- there's no cell service out here --",
        "Paul: So you and Mike decided to just go ahead and help yourself to something that was meant for the two of us.",
        "Meg: Paul, it was a mix-up. It could be a do-over. We could go up there together right now.",
        "Mike: Yeah, and you'll have a great time, take my word for it.",
        "Paul: Oh, I'm not taking anything from you, Mike. And I'm sure as hell not letting you take anything else from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Something smells good.",
        "Lily: Oh! Who knew all these years I spent all that money on perfume. All I had to do was put a little Emma's gravy behind my ear to turn you on. So, all the homework, all checked?",
        "Holden: All done. And they're under strict order to put themselves to bed.",
        "Lily: Good. This is great. This is the kind of dinner we need.",
        "Holden: Uh-huh.",
        "Lily: To be acting like a couple --",
        "Holden: Right, and a chance for us to rub off on Jack and Carly?",
        "Lily: I didn't say that.",
        "Holden: You didn't have to.",
        "Lily: Would you mind putting the wine on the table while you tell me not to get my hopes up about Jack and Carly, please?",
        "Holden: If living together didn't bring them any closer, I don't see how this dinner is going to do it. And Mama's elderberry wine it tastes very good, but it is no love potion.",
        "Lily: Yeah, you never know where magic is going to come from. I think tonight is a new start -- a fresh start -- for all of us.",
        "Holden: Be right back.",
        "Lily: Okay. Oh, where's that -- oh, that's right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sage: Mommy, you look so beautiful.",
        "Carly: Well, thank you, Sweetheart.",
        "Sage: I bet you tonight's going to be really, really special.",
        "Carly: Oh, I really, really hope so. I could use something special.",
        "Parker: Hey, Sage, can you go get your pizza so we can start the movie?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I mean what I said, guys save some for the babysitter. You look great. All this for an evening at the farm?",
        "Carly: Well, I dress for the company, not the occasion.",
        "Jack: I'm sure Holden and Lily will be honored. I mean it, you look stunning.",
        "Carly: You ain't so bad yourself. [Doorbell rings] It's the babysitter.",
        "Jack: Babysitter. Hi.",
        "[Karen coughing]",
        "Carly: Karen. Hi. You don't sound good.",
        "Babysitter: Oh, no. I'm fine. I'm not contagious. I took an antihistamine. I'm not contagious.",
        "Carly: You sure you're okay?",
        "Jack: You know, maybe we should cancel tonight. I can call Holden, I'll explain everything.",
        "Sage: No, you have to go. Mommy got all dressed up and everything.",
        "Jack: Yeah, she is right. It would be a shame to waste that dress.",
        "Carly: Okay. Okay kids. You be good, all right? And I'll have my phone if you need anything.",
        "Sage: See? I told you, they are still together, and it's going to stay that way.",
        "Jack: I just hope this dinner isn't a mistake.",
        "Carly: It doesn't have to be. It can be whatever we make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I don't know how many times I can say I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: About what, Mike? Stealing my thunder or getting caught?",
        "Mike: Getting caught?",
        "Paul: Come on, you expect me to believe you wouldn't jump at the chance to be alone with Meg?",
        "Meg: You are blowing this way out of proportion.",
        "Paul: He saw his chance and he took it. What would've happened if I hadn't been here when you came down?",
        "Mike: Nothing. So why don't you dial down the accusations, all right? Meg does not deserve that.",
        "Paul: Don't you tell me what Meg deserves. You don't know a thing about her.",
        "Meg: And neither do you, Paul, if you think you can humiliate me like this.",
        "Paul: Is it really so hard to understand why I might have a problem with this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi, guys, come on in.",
        "Holden: Hello.",
        "Jack: Whoa. Candles, and flowers --",
        "Carly: They're pretty, Lily. And something smells delicious?",
        "Jack: Yeah, it does smell great. I'm starving.",
        "Lily: Oh, good, good, good. Uh, yeah, well, we'll eat as soon as we go up and say good night to the kids.",
        "Holden: I just did.",
        "Lily: But I didn't. I'd like you to come with me.",
        "Carly: Did you have to act like you've never seen flowers and candles before?",
        "Jack: I didn't realize when Holden invited us that -- I mean, it's clear that Lily has an agenda here, no?",
        "Carly: It's just dinner. It's not about what Lily wants, it's about what we want.",
        "Jack: Okay, well, while they're upstairs checking on the kids, I going to check in with the station. There's some few loose ends I got to take care of. Okay, I'll just be out on the porch.",
        "Carly: Why is there never a beer when you need one? Beggars can't be choosers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I want to propose a toast. To Ali.",
        "Alison: Me? What for?",
        "Chris: For doing a great job at the hospital.",
        "Alison: I haven't done anything more than any other nurse's aide.",
        "Chris: Oh, yeah you have. You're a natural at it, Ali. There are all kinds of careers in medicine. Aaron, help me out here. Tell Ali she can do whatever she wants.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, of course she can. The question is, is what Alison wants to do? She may just be happy doing just what she's doing.",
        "Chris: Sure, sure, there's nothing wrong with just having a job that you just like. I mean, it works for you, right?",
        "Aaron: You mean because I have a job as opposed to a career?",
        "Chris: Not at all. There's an art to being a great bartender.",
        "Aaron: You're not sounding condescending or anything like that.",
        "Alison: Aaron, please.",
        "Chris: No, Ali, if he needs to say something, let him say it. Things have been awkward between the four of us and the point of this dinner was to get over it. So if Aaron has a problem with me, I want to hear it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I am so sorry he took all of that out on you.",
        "Mike: Is there anything I can do to make it better? Do you want me to talk to him when he calms down?",
        "Meg: No, no, no. It won't help. Besides, you're not the one that should be reaching out to him. He's the one who owes you -- both of us -- an apology.",
        "Balloon guy: You two forgot this.",
        "Meg: That's not ours.",
        "Balloon guy: Oh yes, it is. It comes along with the ride.",
        "Meg: What is it?",
        "Mike: It's a champagne picnic. No wonder the guy wanted to deck me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I wasn't trying to condescend to you, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Then why start everything off by making such a big deal about the wine. Why is it that you have to be in the driver's seat and everybody else has to just sit in the back like little kids, huh?",
        "Chris: Anyone ever told you, you have a chip on your shoulder?",
        "Alison: All Chris wants is to get rid of the weirdness and see if the four of us can be friends.",
        "Aaron: Good luck with that.",
        "Alison: Everyone at this table has issues with someone else. Well, I mean, it's no secret that Sofie and I have had our troubles, too. Haven't we?",
        "Aaron: Sofie?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Where's Jack?",
        "Carly: On the porch making a phone call.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Carly: I poured myself a drink, I hope that's okay.",
        "Lily: Good, sure. Listen, would you go tell Jack that dinner's ready? Would you mind? What happened?",
        "Carly: Absolutely nothing.",
        "Jack: The file should be on Hennessey's desk. Yeah, he was checking priors.",
        "Holden: Dinner's ready.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'll be right there. Got it? Okay, good. Just put it on my desk, I'll deal with it tomorrow. Thanks.",
        "Holden: Wow, that file must've been really important, huh?",
        "Jack: Yeah, just as important as you checking on the kids two times in ten minutes.",
        "Holden: This was not my idea.",
        "Jack: Oh, I know that. But maybe you could tell Lily to put the brakes on, okay? This isn't helping me or Carly.",
        "Holden: All right, I'll do what I can.",
        "Jack: Thank you very much.",
        "Lily: Hey, boys, here you go. I would like to -- here you go. Here you go. I would like to make a toast.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Lily: To old friends and to new beginnings",
        "Jack: Oh, God, what is that?",
        "Lily: Oh, I don't remember it tasting like that.",
        "Holden: It's all sediments.",
        "Lily: Eww.",
        "Carly: It tastes good to me.",
        "Lily: Well, because you had the first top half of that bottle.",
        "Jack: Just how much did you drink, Carly?",
        "Holden: You know what? It doesn't matter. I'll run out and get us a couple more bottles.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm coming.",
        "Holden: Oh, no, no, no. You stay here. Stay here with our guests.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Oh, everything looks so good.",
        "Chris: If you want a recommendation -- unless Aaron you would like to recommend something?",
        "Aaron: No thanks. Alison's a big girl, she knows what she wants.",
        "Alison: Sofie? You haven't even opened your menu.",
        "Sofie: Oh. Sorry.",
        "Aaron: Sofie, are you okay?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Um, will you just excuse me for a moment? Paul?",
        "Paul: Hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Sofie: I'm having dinner with friends, but I saw you at the bar. You -- what's wrong?",
        "Paul: Nothing. I don't want to talk about -- I don't want to talk about anything. I'm going home. Have fun with your friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Wow, Paul really went all out.",
        "Meg: Yeah, good or bad, he never does anything halfway.",
        "Mike: Well, it doesn't look like he's coming back, so we might as well eat something.",
        "Meg: You know, I'm not really hungry.",
        "Mike: Well, at least have some champagne. He bought it for you, after all. [Glasses clink] Wow, this is really good. Your boyfriend really knows his champagne.",
        "Meg: He's not my boyfriend.",
        "Mike: Not now or not ever?",
        "Meg: We were engaged once. And you remember, I told you we were going to have a baby. But, you just saw what happened, what always happens. It doesn't seem to work out.",
        "Mike: Are you sure? It looked to me like a there was still a lot of sparks flying.",
        "Meg: Well, sparks have never been a problem. It's just that they get out of hand and then everything around us ends up in ashes.",
        "Mike: Well, at least you know someone's passionate about you. Katie and I, we had that once. And if I knew that there was a chance that I could get it back, I'd do anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Sofie, if you don't feel well, I can take you home.",
        "Sofie: No, I'm fine, please, no.",
        "Alison: You don't look fine.",
        "Sofie: I'm just -- you know, I'm really worried about Barbara. The radiation, she didn't react well to it today, so -- you know what -- I just want to make sure she's okay. I think I'm going to go call the hospital and check in on her, okay? Excuse me.",
        "Chris: I told you, she's a really nice person.",
        "Alison: Yep. Here's to Saint Sofie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: The real question is why you keep coming back.",
        "Meg: Well, if I didn't still care, I would have written Paul off a long time ago. But how many times can you keep hoping that person's going to change only to be disappointed? You know what they say the definition of insanity is? Repeating the same action and expecting a different result.",
        "Mike: I guess that's why they talk about being crazy in love. If I were you, I'd stop second-guessing myself. If you think there's the slightest chance that you two may have a future together, you owe it to yourself not to walk away so soon -- like I did.",
        "Paul: Sofie, you shouldn't be here. You should go back to the Lakeview with your friends.",
        "Sofie: Paul, you were there for me through the most difficult time in my life. You helped me so much, that I don't think I could have gotten through it without you. And now, it's my turn. So if you're in pain, I am not going to let you go through it alone.",
        "Lily: How's parker?",
        "Carly: He's good. Better. He has his bad days along with the good ones, you know.",
        "Lily: Uh-huh. I mean, thank god the two of you were able to get those murder charges dropped. You're quite a team.",
        "Jack: I'm going to grab myself a beer, okay?",
        "Carly: There aren't any, Jack. Um --",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: Lily, we know what you're trying to do here, it's not working.",
        "Lily: No?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Lily: I should have known. I bet it would make a mistake.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Lily: Yep. I went about this all wrong because the two of you do not handle subtlety. Jack, you're an idiot.",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Lily: You are. She is beautiful and talented and smart and great and perfect for you. We all know it. And so do you. So why don't you just accept it and admit it? What the hell's wrong with you?",
        "Carly: Don't look at me. She's talking. I'm not.",
        "Jack: My problem, Lily, assuming I have one, is really none of your business. I came here for nice family meal.",
        "Lily: Yes, a nice family meal, and we'll have a little chat with that family meal.",
        "Jack: We can chat. We can chat about anything you want. The weather, politics -- there's a lot to talk about there. But the topic of Carly and me -- not on the table.",
        "Carly: There you go. You see, you heard the man.",
        "Lily: Okay, if you don't want to discuss it, then just listen.",
        "Carly: You're not helping.",
        "Lily: Because you're not letting me help you. Do you two realize how ridiculous you're being? Any problems that you have, they can be worked out. Look around you, I mean, here, for heaven's sakes. I mean, look how Holden and I worked things out.",
        "Holden: Lily, I think you've said enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Tell me what happened with the balloon. Did the guy not come or something?",
        "Paul: No, no. He showed up. I was just at the hospital when it happened.",
        "Sofie: Oh. Well, then maybe you could reschedule. You know, after all that planning, it would be a crime not to float out into the wild blue --",
        "Paul: Meg did. Meg took the balloon ride with another guy.",
        "Sofie: How could she do that?",
        "Paul: She said she didn't' know when she saw the balloon who ordered it.",
        "Sofie: That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. She knows how you feel about her. If I got an amazing surprise like that, I would know exactly who did it for me. It's no wonder you were upset.",
        "Paul: Really? Because she said I was overreacting.",
        "Sofie: No. No, after all you have done to win her back -- after all you have done -- how could she turn this around and make it your fault? That's not fair, Paul. You deserve better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Clerk: Can't stay away, can you, Aaron?",
        "Aaron: Tell me about it. Even on my night off, I'm here. Listen, Charles, did you see Sofie? I think she came out here to make a phone call.",
        "Clerk: I saw her, but no she wasn't on the phone. She was headed outside.",
        "Aaron: Outside? Probably better reception. Where the hell is she?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, if you don't want your dinner that you worked so hard on to be ruined, then we should probably get started.",
        "Lily: Can you pour the wine?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Jack: Oh, Carly, I really don't think you need anymore wine tonight.",
        "Carly: Well, Jack, you have no interest in my needs. Why start now? Thank you, fill 'er up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I love Meg. And I know that she loves me, but it just seems like there's always something in the way, or someone. First it was Craig, now it seems like Mike.",
        "Sofie: I can't imagine Meg choosing Mike over you. I can't imagine her choosing anyone over you.",
        "Paul: I'm so glad you're here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. This is your mother's home, I think that we should do the right thing and hold hands and say grace.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on.",
        "Holden: Lily.",
        "Lily: Hey, hey. What's wrong with being thankful and saying grace? It's too much to ask. Please. Holden, Jack and Carly, please. Thank you. Thank you for this delicious meal, and spending time with people that we can about in this beautiful home which we love, being surrounded by people that love us as much as we love them. Amen.",
        "Holden: Amen.",
        "Carly: Amen.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Carly: What's your problem, Jack. Are you afraid I'm going to contaminate you?",
        "Jack: Carly, come on. Grace is over, I'm starving.",
        "Carly: Yeah. You snatched your hand away because you were hungry.",
        "Jack: Okay, you know what? You could use something to eat, too. You could probably use something in your stomach other than wine.",
        "Carly: What, am I embarrassing you, Jack?",
        "Jack: You're embarrassing yourself and probably Lily and Holden. They don't deserve that.",
        "Carly: What about what I deserve? Don't I deserve even the slightest bit of courtesy or respect, huh? Or is that too much to ask?",
        "Lily: You should go after her. Make sure she's all right.",
        "Jack: I don't want to make it worse. No.",
        "Lily: What if she tries to drive away?",
        "Jack: I got the keys.",
        "Lily: Well, somebody should make sure she's all right.",
        "Jack: I disagree. I think what she needs is time and space to cool off.",
        "Holden: All right, you know what, I'll go see how she's doing.",
        "Carly: Come to make sure I don't make a worse fool of myself? As if that's possible.",
        "Holden: No, I just wanted to see how you were doing.",
        "Carly: Peachy. I ruined Lily's dinner. Jack hates me more than he already did.",
        "Holden: No. No, he does not hate you.",
        "Carly: He can't even bare to hold my hand. Am I really that hopeless? Am I so repulsive?",
        "Holden: No, no, of course not. Look, it's a very -- it's a very sticky, tough situation. And Lily's dinner did not help things.",
        "Carly: No, don't blame Lily. She was just trying to help.",
        "Holden: You know who I blame? I blame my mother, all right. That elderberry wine that she makes? It's pretty lethal.",
        "Carly: Oh, I never thought I would live to see the day that Emma Snyder gets blamed for one of my screw-ups.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I just try to call it like I see it, and here's what I see, I just think you're under a lot of stress. A lot of stress right now. Why don't we just go back inside? Unless you want to ruin Lily's dinner, and that really would be your fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hi, Meg.",
        "Meg: Hey, Sofie. Am I interrupting something?",
        "Paul: No, no, not at all. Sofie was just leaving.",
        "Sofie: Sure. Yeah.",
        "Paul: Sofie, thanks a lot. I am so sorry. No, I am. I acted like a big jerk. I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: Yes, you did. But it's not impossible to understand. You planned a lovely, romantic gesture, and it got messed up in every way possible.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'll make it up to you. I will. I know that the balloon ride now, it's like old news. So, Caribbean cruise -- tell me what to do.",
        "Meg: Stop trying so hard. We're doing just fine going slow.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but, um --",
        "Meg: But?",
        "Paul: I'm scared that, you know, while I'm taking it slow, that you're slowly drifting away.",
        "Meg: The only way you're going to lose me is if you keep losing control. Like the way you did with Mike.",
        "Paul: Okay. But maybe you can help me with that.",
        "Meg: How?",
        "Paul: Well, um, it seems to me like every time I turn around, he's there. You know, your new best friend. Something going on with you and Mike?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Hey, sorry I took so long.",
        "Chris: Oh, that's okay. We sent yours back to the kitchen to keep warm.",
        "Alison: How's the patient?",
        "Sofie: Oh, sleeping. Sleeping, yeah. So, of course I didn't want to wake her. But I did want to see how she was doing, so you know, I asked the nurses to pull the chart and that's what took so long. You know, somebody had misplaced it, and it turned into this whole big thing. So, anyway, she's doing okay. And they're still releasing her tomorrow. So, that's good.",
        "Chris: Well, I hope Barbara appreciates you going the extra mile.",
        "Sofie: Oh, no, it was nothing. It was just a phone call.",
        "Chris: I wouldn't say that. You've been giving a lot of your time to care for a woman who has no right to expect anything from you. But you're doing it so she doesn't have to go through cancer treatment alone.",
        "Sofie: She's not going through it alone. She has Paul.",
        "Chris: Off and on. I wouldn't say he's the most dependable guy in the world.",
        "Sofie: He's very dependable. He's wonderful -- to his mom.",
        "Chris: I stand corrected. I have to hand it to you, Sofie. You see the best in people even sometimes when it's hard to find.",
        "Aaron: I need some air.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Is this how it's always going to be, Paul? You thinking that something's going on between me and some other man?",
        "Paul: Meg, the guy's like your shadow.",
        "Meg: He's working on the farm. Or did you forget that he's your partner in this project?",
        "Paul: Right. So when he's looking at you, he's thinking about real estate?",
        "Meg: Okay, Paul. If you want to talk about shadows, you know, Sofie's been spending a lot of time at Fairwinds lately --",
        "Paul: Yeah, because my mom's got cancer and she's here helping her out.",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah, but when I came in just now, it seemed like you guys practically holding hands. And you know what? Barbara's nowhere in sight. Should I be jealous?",
        "Paul: Of Sofie? [Laughs] What?",
        "Meg: So now you see how ridiculous you're being about Mike?",
        "Paul: Okay. I get it. I do. I get it.",
        "Meg: You better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, hey, first Sofie leaves, now you. What is going on?",
        "Aaron: Nothing.",
        "Alison: Is it something Chris said?",
        "Aaron: He's a little full of himself, don't you think?",
        "Alison: He's just trying to find a way for the four of us to all get along.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, whatever --",
        "Alison: Aaron, you can't leave without saying anything.",
        "Aaron: You're right. Sofie, I'm about ready to call it a night. Can I take you home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okey-dokey. How about we just pretend that I just got here?",
        "Lily: Okay. Carly, great to see you.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Lily: Thanks for coming --",
        "Carly: That's for having me.",
        "Lily: Come on in.",
        "Holden: Can I get you a glass of water?",
        "Carly: Thank you. So, how about it? Can we just start this night over again? [Cell phone rings] Oh, it's mine. Parker. Hey, Parker, what's going on?",
        "Parker: Uh, nothing. I have a question but you have to promise not to get upset.",
        "Carly: I'm not upset. What happened?",
        "Parker: Nothing. It's just, I was wondering, is 103 like a really bad temperature?",
        "Carly: Who's sick, Honey? Is it Sage?",
        "Jack: What's wrong?",
        "Parker: No, it's none of us. It's the babysitter.",
        "[Coughing]",
        "Carly: It's the babysitter. She has a fever of 103.",
        "Jack: Oh, perfect. Perfect ending to the perfect evening. Tell him we'll be right there.",
        "Carly: Sweetheart, you'll be back in a few minutes, okay. Bye. I'm so sorry.",
        "Lily: No, no, don't be sorry. Don't be sorry. Just get home to your beautiful children.",
        "Jack: Let's be sure and do this again real soon.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: You can't be serious, Aaron. Sofie's barely even touched her food.",
        "Sofie: No, I'm really not that hungry. And it's been a long day, what with everything that happened at the hospital and --",
        "Aaron: Right, right, right. So, thanks for a really super evening, guys.",
        "Chris: What?",
        "Alison: I can't believe it. You honestly think you had nothing to do with that?",
        "Sofie: I'm really sorry I took so long. You know, I just got so worried about Barbara after the hospital --",
        "Aaron: You know, just stop it. Please don't lie anymore than you have to.",
        "Sofie: What do you mean?",
        "Aaron: You weren't making a phone call. You left the Lakeview.",
        "Sofie: How could you know that? Were you spying on me?",
        "Aaron: The desk clerk saw you leave. So I went out to look for you and you were gone. I mean, where did you go?",
        "Sofie: To Fairwinds.",
        "Aaron: To see Paul?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, I thought he'd be the person with the best information about his mom.",
        "Aaron: And you had to go get that information in person? Why?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Come on, Ali. Aaron Snyder would get an attitude if I said the sky was blue.",
        "Alison: I thought you were going to try to get along.",
        "Chris: I did. I do. But that doesn't mean I'm going to censor everything I say just to keep from hurting his tender little feelings. And neither should you. You don't need his approval on anything you say or do.",
        "Alison: I know I don't.",
        "Chris: Okay, okay, so dinner was a bust. But there'll be other opportunities. And remember, everything doesn't have to be on Aaron Snyder's terms. Well, at least you and Sofie didn't get into a fight.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, that was because she was too busy being Barbara Ryan's watchdog all night.",
        "Chris: Well, her loss. She missed out on an opportunity to get to know you better. So we'll try again. Maybe we didn't get to where we want to be yet, but at least we made a start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: You want to know why I didn't tell you I was going to Fairwinds? I didn't want you to be mad about Paul again.",
        "Aaron: Well, guess what? Not only am I mad at Paul, I'm really mad that you lied.",
        "Sofie: Aaron, Paul's been a friend to me.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, but if you're my friend, too, which I thought you were, don't you owe it to me to be honest? I mean, I like you, Sofie. I really like you. But I can't be with anyone who can't be straight with me.",
        "Sofie: Are you saying we're not friends anymore?",
        "Aaron: All I'm saying, is whether we're friends or anything else -- that's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Are you sure you got to go now?",
        "Meg: I can't stay, not while Mama's away. We are still the owners of a working farm, remember. But you know what? I think this is one of the few times where we actually talked through our problems, and we ended up in a better place.",
        "Paul: Anyplace I get to be with you is better. Sweet dreams. Hey, you're going to call me in the morning, right? [Cell phone rings] Hello? This is Paul Ryan.",
        "Balloon rep: Good evening, Mr. Ryan. This is Up, Up and Away Incorporated. Wanted to make sure you were satisfied with today's service.",
        "Paul: Uh, yeah, well, I didn't get to go on this ride, so I can safely say that I wasn't satisfied.",
        "Balloon rep: But we were told that a couple went up. The picnic basket was returned empty. So was the champagne bottle.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I didn't get any champagne. But I know who did. And it's going to stop now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, are you still here working?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I'm just picking up some tools. It looks like things are better between you and Paul.",
        "Meg: Uh, yes, they are. And I owe it all to you. Thank you for encouraging me not to give up.",
        "Mike: I'm glad it all worked out. And I'd hate to be responsible for messing up someone else's love life. After all, I've already ruined mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Sage: You didn't have to come home early. We were doing fine.",
        "Jack: Oh, Honey, we were ready to come home.",
        "Sage: But it's still so early. Weren't you having a good time?",
        "Jack: It's just dinner at the farm. No big deal. Now everybody, come on. Up to bed. Let's go.",
        "Parker: I told you nothing would happen.",
        "Sage: They only came home early because you called Mommy.",
        "J.J.: I told you not to.",
        "Carly: Well, I think it will be a long time before Lily and Holden ask us to dinner again.",
        "Jack: And even longer before we accept. Tonight's been rough on both of us. Why don't you go on up -- no, no, I'll finish -- I'll finish down here.",
        "Carly: No, I don't mind. Besides, I think we should talk about what happened tonight.",
        "Jack: I think you've done enough talking for tonight, Carly.",
        "Carly: Don't dismiss me. I'm not one of the kids.",
        "Jack: You want to talk about dismissing? How about when you dismissed me when I suggested you'd had enough to drink? Carly, instead of talking, why don't you do more listening when someone who cares about you is actually trying to help you? Go. Go to bed. Whatever you need to say to me, you can say it in the morning.",
        "Carly: Oh, yes, sir, Jack. Anything to please you. I live to obey you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, dinner over so early?",
        "Lily: Don't ask.",
        "Holden: Hey, don't ask --",
        "Lily: Don't ask.",
        "Meg: That's an awful lot of leftovers you're putting away --",
        "Lily: Oh, let's just say there wasn't a lot of eating. Leave it at that.",
        "Meg: Good night.",
        "Holden/Lily: Night.",
        "Holden: Bedtime for you, too.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I don't know -- still have a lot of cleaning up to do.",
        "Holden: You know what, I'll take care of all of it. You did all the cooking.",
        "Lily: Nobody ate a bite.",
        "Holden: It's not your fault.",
        "Lily: Yeah, it was my idea.",
        "Holden: It was. But you wouldn't be you if you didn't try to help the people that you cared about.",
        "Lily: And you know that you're at the top of that list.",
        "Holden: Just make sure I stay there.",
        "Lily: I will. Okay, see you in a minute.",
