        "Luke: Damian kidnapped Noah, Mom. That's all there is to it.",
        "Lily: I don't think so, Luke.",
        "Luke: Oh, God. Don't tell me that you trust him.",
        "Lily: I can't believe that he would kidnap the love of your life and use him against you. I can't believe that he'd hurt you like that just for money.",
        "Luke: He used me for money. Trust me, Damian has done a lot worse things than this.",
        "Lily: I understand. And don't get me wrong, if it turns out that Damian is responsible, I'll be the first one to call Margo and tell her to lock him up and throw away the key. But I just don't think we should jump to the worst- possible conclusion until we know more.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but Mom, the problem is with Damian, the worst-possible conclusion is probably the right one.",
        "Lily: Right now, we need to focus on getting Noah home safe and sound.",
        "Luke: Well, right now, do you know what I need to do? Something, instead of just standing here and waiting. I'm gonna meet Dad at the police station.",
        "Lily: I'll go with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Have you completely lost your mind? Am I supposed to be a kidnapper now?",
        "Holden: You knew Luke would pay anything to get Noah back. Did you think he would raid the foundation to get the ransom money?",
        "Damian: I don't know what you're talking about. I know nothing about this. I went to Lisbon looking for Noah. Why would I do that if I was the one who kidnapped him?",
        "Holden: Which is why you never went at all. Your fake little trip -- that's when you grabbed him, isn't it?",
        "Damian: Holden, I'm innocent of this and everything else you've accused me of.",
        "Holden: I guess you never kidnapped Luke either, huh, Damian?",
        "Damian: I cannot defend the past. Those were desperate times. But I've learned much since then. I'd never do anything to hurt Luke or anybody I care about.",
        "Holden: You are nothing but a liar, and you always have been.",
        "Damian: All right, what do I have to do to convince you, Holden, huh? Swear on a stack of bibles? Take a lie-detector test?",
        "Holden: You'll find a way to trick the machine.",
        "Damian: That's the best I can offer. Take it or leave me alone.",
        "Holden: Fine. I'll take it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Well, you might as well stay here while I go sign you out, Mr. Pants, and then we'll get back to the nursing home. Do you need to use the men's room or anything? I'll take that as a no. So, are you gonna be fine till I get back? I'll take that as a yes! Ali.",
        "Alison: Casey.",
        "Casey: How are you?",
        "Alison: Oh, uh, fine, thanks. Um -- does he need help?",
        "Casey: Oh, Mr. Pants is doing just fine, aren't ya?",
        "Alison: Mr. Pants?",
        "Casey: Stanley Pantoliano, aka \"Mr. Pants,\" um, meet Alison Stewart.",
        "Alison: Pleased to meet you, Mr. -- Pants.",
        "Casey: Mr. Pants is a man of few words.",
        "Alison: He seems more like a man of no words.",
        "[Casey chuckles]",
        "Alison: Uh, I won't keep you.",
        "Casey: Wait, Ali, Ali. Wait. What's going on? Are you still mad about I missed our lunch date? 'Cause that was not my fault. The van broke down. Jade and I were stuck for hours.",
        "Alison: It's not that big of a deal.",
        "Casey: Then why are you making me feel like it is? It's like you're shutting me out. Is it because I was stuck in the middle of nowhere and -- and I couldn't do a damn thing to get out of there?",
        "Alison: Of course not.",
        "Casey: But you were the one who pushed me to work with Jade.",
        "Alison: Casey, I never wanted you to work with Jade. I -- just didn't want you to be afraid to work with Jade.",
        "Casey: Look, all I'm saying is if I'm working with Jade, if that's gonna be a problem --",
        "Alison: Look, it's not a problem.",
        "Casey: Then why are you acting like it is? Are you jealous?",
        "Alison: You think I'm jealous? You do! You think I'm jealous of Jade?",
        "Casey: Are you?",
        "Alison: Do I have a reason to be? I mean, because you guys have already slept together and we haven't. So -- I am not jealous of Jade! Anyway, I have to go back to work.",
        "[Casey groans]",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[Casey sighs]",
        "Casey: Okay, let's sign you out, and hit the road.",
        "Mr. Pants: Stupid kid.",
        "Casey: What did you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Margo, where's Holden?",
        "Margo: Well, I -- I don't know. Was I supposed to see him?",
        "Luke: Look, Noah's been kidnapped. God knows what they're doing to him.",
        "Margo: All right, well, just slow down and take me through this a step at a time.",
        "Luke: Okay. We, um -- we got in a fight, so when I didn't see him for a while, I just -- you know, I thought he was just trying to sort that out. And then I got a call from him saying that he was at a film festival in Lisbon.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. Well, when did you get this call?",
        "Luke: Yesterday.",
        "Margo: Did he sound like he was under duress?",
        "Luke: Well, like I said, we were in a fight, so I didn't really think about it. And now I'm kicking myself, because if I had just known -- if I had just known --",
        "Lily: Honey, there's no way you could have known.",
        "Margo: All right. Was there any other communication other than this one call?",
        "Luke: Yeah. I got a text from his phone earlier today, but I know he didn't send it.",
        "Lily: Kidnappers must have forced him to send it.",
        "Margo: Well, what led you to the conclusion that he was kidnapped?",
        "Luke: When I got this ransom note.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, all right, all right. Don't -- is that a Lakeview stationary?",
        "Luke: Yeah. No surprise there, huh?",
        "Lily: Luke, come on. Don't jump to any conclu -- Holden.",
        "Luke: There's your kidnapper. He kidnapped Noah. He wrote the ransom note. I'll give you the damn money! Just tell me where Noah is!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: Poor Noah. Are you tied up too tight? I hate to see you in pain, Monster, because none of this is your fault.",
        "Zac: Hey.",
        "Zoe: Don't be jealous, \"Z.\" You're the only one for me, too. No matter how much pain you're going through, can't be half as bad as losing what's rightfully yours.",
        "Zac: But that's all about to change.",
        "Zoe: Just as soon as we get the ransom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: He said he would take a polygraph test. Let's get him hooked up and get some straight answers.",
        "Damian: I'm telling you the truth, Luke. I know nothing about any kidnapping! I would never do anything to hurt Noah.",
        "Luke: Okay, fine. Then we'll wait for further instructions like your note -- sorry, sorry -- like the kidnappers' note said. We'll pretend that we all don't know that you did this. We'll play your stupid little game.",
        "Damian: I'm not playing games, Luke! All I want to do is help.",
        "Holden: If you want to help, then why don't you just tell us where Noah is?",
        "Damian: Luke --",
        "Luke: How can we get money from the foundation to pay off the ransom?",
        "Lily: I'll call the bank and find out the best way to handle this.",
        "Holden: Okay. It has to be the fastest way. Has to be the fastest --",
        "Margo: Wait. Wait a minute, both of you. Just -- uh, Damian, I'm sorry. Could you have a seat here? We'll be -- we'll be right back.",
        "Damian: Of course. Just do whatever you have to do to get Noah back.",
        "Margo: All right.",
        "Holden: Did you hear him?",
        "Margo: All right. Luke, I know how you must feel -- how you all must feel. And believe me, obviously, we will -- we will investigate Damian's involvement in the kidnapping. But the last thing you should do right now is pay that ransom. If you do, you put Noah at even greater risk than he already is.",
        "Luke: How can you tell me not to pay the ransom? If I don't, Noah will get killed.",
        "Margo: I know. I know that it sounds counterintuitive, but by paying the money now, you keep all the power in the kidnappers' hands. If you cooperate too quickly, you don't give us time to do our work, to -- to try and track them down.",
        "Lily: What are you suggesting we do?",
        "Margo: Well, have you had a communication from them as to where to drop the ransom?",
        "Luke: No, they said to wait for further instructions.",
        "Margo: All right. Well, when they do contact you, just try to keep the lines of communication open, all right? Don't hand over the money right away. You got to get something first.",
        "Holden: Like what?",
        "Margo: It's called proof of life.",
        "Luke: No, Noah's alive.",
        "Margo: I'm sure that he is. I am absolutely sure he is. But what you've got to do right now is buy time. You need proof that Noah's alive. If you hand over the money too quickly, you lose that leverage.",
        "Luke: So you're just asking me to keep Noah in danger?",
        "Margo: No. I'm asking you to do everything you possibly can to get Noah through this safely, okay?",
        "Luke: Okay. Well, just promise me you'll do everything you can --",
        "Margo: Oh, you have my word. You have my word.",
        "Holden: No, you know what? Let him go. He probably needs some time alone. Besides, that car Margo assigned to him is out there. He'll be okay.",
        "Damian: Luke, you have to let me help you.",
        "Luke: You really want to help me?",
        "Damian: Of course I do.",
        "Luke: Then call whoever you have to call to get Noah out of this.",
        "Damian: I would if I could. You have to believe me.",
        "Luke: I wish I could.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zac: Hey! Where you going?",
        "Zoe: Oh, to find Luke, to see how he's doing getting the ransom together. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. I'll make it worth your while.",
        "[Muffled]",
        "Noah: Hand me the water. Please, can I have a little water?",
        "Zac: Okay, okay. Guess it won't hurt to let you have a little water. Sometimes, she takes that dominatrix thing a little too far, you know? The tape, the ropes, it's kind of overkill.",
        "[Zac chuckles]",
        "Zac: Although it can be kind of fun sometimes, you know? Oh, sorry.",
        "[Zac chuckles]",
        "Zac: Loosen up, Sweetheart. All right. Water break's over.",
        "Noah: Thank you. Wait, no. Please, please, don't put that back on yet. I can't breathe with that on.",
        "Zac: For a big, strong guy, you are such a wuss.",
        "Noah: What did she mean before when she -- when she talked about getting what's rightfully yours?",
        "Zac: Well, I suppose it won't hurt to tell you. The money that Luke used to set up the foundation -- it was stolen, from us. And we're here to take it back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I know I'm not deaf, Mr. Pants. I heard you call me stupid. What did you mean, huh? Is it because I accused Alison of being jealous? It did tick her off. But you have to understand, I've been calling her and leaving her messages, and nothing, you know? You must remember what it's like, how crazy you can be about a girl that you want to talk to, but no, she doesn't want to talk to you. And I -- I've thought about taking her -- taking her to the storage closet, and you know? Believe me, I've thought about it. But even if she went along with it, you know, she would just get mad at me sooner or later. I don't get it. I really care about her. I just -- it just never seems to work out. And every time I try to fix it, you know, nothing seems to work. It just keeps going sou -- what did you do that for?",
        "Mr. Pants: Call your girlfriend.",
        "Casey: Are you crazy? Never mind. You -- you actually just proved you are.",
        "[Casey sighs]",
        "Casey: Oh, what the hell? What -- what am I gonna lose, right? What am I gonna lose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Alison: Casey, I told you, I don't have time for this. I have a pharmacology exam tomorrow.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I know you're busy, but, um -- I could really, uh, use a favor.",
        "Alison: What kind of favor?",
        "Casey: My, uh, car is stuck at the -- the corner of Price and Delmar, by the park.",
        "Alison: You've obviously confused me with a tow truck.",
        "Casey: There's nothing wrong with the car. Um -- our good friend Mr. Pants here threw the keys into the woods. I was wondering if you could, uh, come out and help me find them.",
        "Alison: Well, as much fun as that sounds, I really need to study. Oh, but here's an idea for you. Why don't you call your good friend Jade and see if she wants to come help you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Great, great. Good idea, Mr. Pants. Thanks a lot. Now she -- she's madder at me than -- no, I'm not gonna call her back, okay? It's just gonna make everything worse. That's just stu -- fine! Fine, I'll do it! I'll call her back, and then I'll prove to you that it's not gonna work, okay? It's not gonna work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Alison: Casey, I said no.",
        "Mr. Pants: Please help me! I need to get home!",
        "Alison: Mr. Pants? Okay, uh, I'll -- I'll be right there. Don't worry, okay? Don't go anywhere. We'll -- we'll get you home.",
        "Casey: Is she coming? She is coming! You have a way with the ladies, Mr. Pants.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: Luke, hey. You want to get a latte or something?",
        "Luke: Oh, no, no. No, I'm -- I'm okay.",
        "Zoe: Hey, is something wrong? I mean, you just don't seem like your fabulous self. Are you okay?",
        "Luke: Do you remember that text that I got from Noah, the weird one where he said, \"I love you\"?",
        "Zoe: Yeah, sure. We decided that absence is making his heart grow fonder, which is really sweet.",
        "Luke: Well, that's also really not the case.",
        "Zoe: If you think he doesn't miss you, you are out of your mind. You are missable and kissable and all --",
        "Luke: Look, Noah didn't send that text. He's been kidnapped.",
        "Zoe: Oh, my God! Kidnapped? Are you sure?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I just got the ransom note.",
        "Zoe: No wonder you look like you've been hit by a bus. Luke, I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't know what to do! I don't know what to think! I -- I'm going crazy. I don't --",
        "Zoe: Aw, poor baby.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: I never should have taken that money.",
        "Zoe: What money?",
        "Luke: A while ago, Damian sent me a family inheritance. I used the money to start the foundation. Now I guess Damian wants the money back, and the only way he can think about doing that is -- is holding my boyfriend for ransom, you know? How sick is that?",
        "Zoe: Are you sure it's Damian?",
        "Luke: Well, I can't think of anybody else who would do such a thing.",
        "Zoe: Wow, Dad is a bad, bad dude.",
        "Luke: Unfortunately, there's not enough evidence against him right now, but I'm sure the police will find something.",
        "Zoe: When did you go to police?",
        "Luke: Today.",
        "Zoe: Did they give you any advice?",
        "Luke: Yeah, they told me not to pay the ransom.",
        "Zoe: You're kidding. I mean, that is really weird.",
        "Luke: Well, they say that if I pay the ransom, it's giving the kidnappers, you know, an advantage. But I don't care about that. I just want Noah back.",
        "Zoe: That really sucks. I mean, if I was in your position, I don't know what I would do. Just the thought of someone taking \"Z,\" and to think about him hurting and calling out my name -- I could stop it all by just signing a check. I just don't think I'd be able to hold out.",
        "Luke: Okay, you know what? No offense, this isn't helping. I have to go home.",
        "Zoe: Sorry, sorry. I mean, go home and put your feet up, feel better. Just try not to think about what poor Noah's going through.",
        "Luke: So long.",
        "Zoe: Ciao, Luciano.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, when was the last time you saw Noah?",
        "Holden: Why don't you tell Margo how you kept pressuring Noah to tell Luke that you've changed? Only when that didn't happen, that's when you kidnapped him.",
        "Luke: Noah came to me and told me he knew I was innocent. He didn't believe I committed all the crimes I've been accused of.",
        "Holden: Yeah, right.",
        "Margo: And so when was that?",
        "Damian: Not long before he disappeared.",
        "Holden: So you admit that you were the last person to see Noah.",
        "Lily: The last person before whoever did the kidnapping!",
        "Margo: I will do the questioning, please. Thank you. So, did you two discuss anything else?",
        "Damian: I told Noah that I thought the, uh -- Luke hit-and-run and -- and, uh, the break-in at Holden and Lily's might have been made by, uh, another member of the Grimaldi family.",
        "Margo: Who?",
        "Damian: I know there are many members of the family who hate me. Some of the hatred might have carried over to my son.",
        "Holden: Look, Lily found a ring with the Grimaldi crest in her office. He's trying to get out of this by pinning it on someone else in his family!",
        "Damian: That ring isn't mine! But it obviously belonged to someone else in my family, yeah.",
        "Margo: Any idea who?",
        "Damian: No. Not without more information. Noah told me he'd found the computer username of the person who hacked into the foundation's bank account, but --",
        "Margo: So you think that that hacker used the Grimaldi name?",
        "Damian: Noah thought it might have been P-e-s-c-l, which is the Italian word for the astrological sign Pisces.",
        "Margo: So it's your contention then that the last time you saw Noah was when he gave you this information about the hacker.",
        "Damian: Yes. You have my word.",
        "Holden: Which is worth nothing.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Damian: You know, I'm sick to death of you and your endless accusations! Now, you blame me for everything that's happening to my son, but there's no evidence I -- I've been involved in any of it!",
        "Cop: Lieutenant, you wanted to see this ASAP.",
        "Margo: Yes, thank you. Excuse me.",
        "Damian: Will you tell your husband, please, that I was as surprised as you were to find that Grimaldi ring in your office?",
        "Lily: I've tried. His mind is closed.",
        "Holden: Closed to lies, the way yours should be.",
        "Margo: All right. We just ran a quick check of the prints on the ransom note.",
        "Lily: Were you able to find anything.",
        "Margo: Yes, we were. We're gonna be holding you on suspicion of kidnapping, Damian. The prints match yours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Alison sighs]",
        "Alison: Are you still looking for the keys?",
        "Casey: Yeah. No luck, though.",
        "Alison: Is Mr. Pants okay?",
        "Casey: Oh, Mr. Pants is having a ball. But I'm the one who's gonna be dead meat if I don't get him to the nursing home on time. Can -- can you help me find them?",
        "Alison: Well, what makes you think I can find them when you couldn't?",
        "Casey: Because you're a girl, and girls are good at finding --",
        "Alison: Okay, well, unfortunately, you know what, you're just gonna have to find them for yourself.",
        "Casey: Alison, I'm sorry. Please don't go. Look -- you're already here. I -- I -- can I use your help? I -- I'll buy you ice cream if you stay.",
        "Alison: No, thanks. I'm not in the mood for ice cream.",
        "Casey: How about a cupcake?",
        "Alison: No. No ice cream, no cupcakes. Look, I'll help you look for the keys, but then I'm out of here.",
        "Casey: Okay. Um, I already covered this area. We can go check up here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Why do you think you're entitled to Luke's money?",
        "Zac: See, that's where you're wrong. It's not Luke's money. It's our money.",
        "Noah: But how? Who are you guys?",
        "Zoe: Zac, I need you outside now.",
        "Zac: Hey, what happened?",
        "Zoe: They're not gonna pay the ransom.",
        "Zac: But why?",
        "Zoe: It doesn't matter why.",
        "Zac: What are we gonna do?",
        "Zoe: What else? We're gonna have to tell Luke where Noah is.",
        "Zac: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Zoe: Far from it. Trust me, Zac. I know what I'm doing. Just give me Noah's phone.",

        "Holden: So what do we do?",
        "Margo: Just sit tight. We've already got people canvassing the neighborhood, and we've got people planting bugs on your phone so we can monitor incoming and outgoing phone calls.",
        "Holden: Did Damian say anything?",
        "Margo: Well, not much, but we do know one thing. He couldn't have kidnapped Luke, 'cause he was here with me.",
        "Holden: Well, he could have hired people.",
        "Margo: That's true, he could have. But -- but it's very likely that he would try and send some sort of signal, and I can tell you that he's had absolutely no communication with anyone since he's been here. So listen, we will keep you and Lily informed. Just take care of each other.",

        "Luke: I didn't ask for that money. He gave it to me.",
        "Zoe: It wasn't his to give. It belongs to my branch of the family, not yours. Damian stole my birthright and gave it to you. For what? So you can laugh at the family you claim not to belong to whose fortune you're spending like water. No, no. Not anymore.",

        "Margo: I deal with ruthless people for a living.",
        "Damian: I know you do, but I know them in a way you never can. You have no idea of the resentment going back hundreds of years.",
        "Margo: So educate me.",
        "Damian: Look, they're targeting Luciano because I gave a -- a share of the family fortune to him. Oh, God, this is all my fault. If I hadn't given Luciano the money, none of this would have happened.",
        "Margo: No. You didn't force these people, whoever they are, to kidnap Luke and Noah.",

        "Alison: No, you have to take him back to where he belongs.",
        "Casey: I guess you're right. Well, uh, Stanley Pants adventure's over, but ours doesn't have to be.",
        "Alison: Is that an invitation?",
        "Casey: I'm not busy tonight. You?",
        "Alison: I wish, but I -- I still have that pharmacology exam tomorrow, and I really have to study.",
