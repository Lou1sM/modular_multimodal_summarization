        "Emma: Well, hello. Paul, Emily.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Emma: I see you've been shopping.",
        "Paul: Yeah, just picking up a few things for Eliza.",
        "Emily: What's the fun of having kids if you can't spoil them, right?",
        "Emma: Eliza is not your kid. She's Meg's.",
        "Emily: I -- I know that. I didn't mean to --",
        "Paul: How you doing, Emma?",
        "Emma: Oh, fine. Looking forward to summer. And Meg, uh, will be home for good hopefully. Where is Eliza?",
        "Emily: At home with the nanny.",
        "Emma: Oh. Is that so?",
        "Paul: So, uh, how's Meg doing?",
        "Emma: Oh, she's fine. Thank you for asking. Bye.",
        "Paul: Bye-bye.",
        "Emily: She hates our guts.",
        "Paul: Runs in the family.",
        "Emily: I don't know about that. I mean, you seem to be one of Meg's favorite people.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: And that's why I decided to spend most of my home visits at Paul's. I mean, since Eliza lives there now while I'm here, it will be a lot easier for her. And, uh, Paul's wife, Emily, is there, of course, and it couldn't have gone better. You know, I really can't wait to go home for good. Do you think I might be ready to do that soon?",
        "Doctor: We'll see. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I really wish she'd just let that go.",
        "Emily: What she did was way out of line.",
        "Paul: I think it was understandable.",
        "Emily: How can you say that?",
        "Paul: She's been locked up in a psychiatric ward for months. It's got to play with her head. She lost her sense of perspective. She lost her sense of propriety. That's all.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Paul: What are you doing? Got to work?",
        "Emily: Maybe. Emily Stewart. I -- I'm sorry. Can -- can you just -- hang on. I got to go get a better signal. I can't hear.",
        "Paul: Will you meet me in the bookstore?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Hello. Hi. Uh, I -- I'm sorry. Did you say you were a doctor at Deerbrook?",
        "Doctor: I wanted to get your take on Ms. Snyder's visit.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm sure Meg thought it was just peachy. But you know what? If you, um -- if you ask me, I mean, you want me to be honest, let's just say I wasn't exactly happy when I came home and found her in bed with my husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Hey, Katie, it's Chris. I'm at the studio. You are not. Everyone here thinks you're not coming in today, so I'm just wondering why you asked me to come -- I think I'm getting it now. Hey, Ali.",
        "Alison: Hey. Where's Katie?",
        "Chris: Uh, it doesn't look like she can make it.",
        "Alison: Okay. This is starting to feel like a setup.",
        "Chris: Go with that feeling.",
        "Alison: Why does she keep setting us up?",
        "Chris: Mm, I think its called matchmaking. New thing of hers. Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Alison: Because I'm also starting to wonder if you're in on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Was that the babysitter?",
        "Katie: I was expecting that message. Nothing to worry about. I want to concentrate on this wedding planning.",
        "Henry: I thought the idea was for you and Vienna to plan the wedding, and then I just show up and say, \"I do.\"",
        "Katie: You have to show interest, Henry. You'll make Vienna happy. And you do want to be happily married to Vienna, don't you?",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Yes, yes, of course you do. You need to put this fling with Barbara in the past, move on with the rest of your life with the woman you love.",
        "[Henry chuckles]",
        "Katie: One thing's for sure. You are not getting married in a gym like we did.",
        "Henry: Uh, the gym was -- well, the gym was romantic. It was so out of the box.",
        "Katie: Yeah. So sweaty and stinky. [Laughs]",
        "Henry: Hey, Vienna. Vienna, you okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, hello. I've been calling you. You must have been busy.",
        "Paul: Still busy.",
        "Barbara: Did you go shopping for Eliza? Why didn't you call me?",
        "Paul: Never even crossed my mind. You seen Emily?",
        "Barbara: No, I haven't. You know, whatever you bought for Eliza she is gonna look absolutely adorable in. You know, maybe it's time for a family portrait. What do you think?",
        "Paul: I think I want to know what's really going on.",
        "Barbara: I want to spend some time with my son and my grandchild. I want to reconnect.",
        "Paul: As a family?",
        "Barbara: Yes.",
        "Paul: Oh, that's great, Mom. Does that mean you're gonna take some time off from boinking my baby brother?",
        "Barbara: Don't you talk to me like that.",
        "Paul: I don't know. I think I was being circumspect. I could have said, uh, you were robbing the cradle --",
        "Barbara: Henry is hardly a child.",
        "Paul: -- Or you were taking him to cougar town.",
        "Barbara: I hate that word, as if men haven't been doing this for --",
        "Paul: How about incest?",
        "Barbara: Incest? Henry is barely your half-brother.",
        "Paul: Oh, well, that only makes it like half-creepy, I guess.",
        "Barbara: You know what? There is nothing creepy or wrong about Henry and me. In fact, our relationship -- our relationship is over.",
        "Paul: Yeah, so you claim.",
        "Barbara: It is over. I have told him I don't want to see him anymore. In fact, he is getting married. In fact, you were there at the engagement party.",
        "Paul: Yeah, so were you. You were drunk and determined to let everyone know about your special love.",
        "Barbara: I had a bad night, all right? Forgive me. But it's done. It's done. Enough, enough, okay? I want to see my granddaughter.",
        "Paul: I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Barbara: And why not?",
        "Paul: Because Emily and I, we're trying to provide Eliza with a stable home environment. And you are really far from being a stabilizing force in anybody's life, a -- at least this week.",
        "Barbara: I just told you that my relationship with Henry is over.",
        "Emily: What's going on?",
        "Barbara: I'm leaving. My son has the audacity to disapprove of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Are you sure you're okay? You looked a little worried before.",
        "Vienna: No, I was just -- I was just thinking about the wedding. My God, look at all these magazines.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I know. Now that I get to combine my two favorite hobbies, matchmaking and wedding planning, I'm going all-out.",
        "Vienna: Are you researching napkins?",
        "[Katie laughs]",
        "Henry: Is that too much?",
        "Vienna: No, it's wonderful. I want everything to be perfect.",
        "Katie: It will be. Henry is going to make all your dreams come true, aren't you?",
        "Henry: Yes, you bet.",
        "Katie: All right. Well, I have to get going. I have to get home to Jacob. The sitter has to leave early.",
        "Henry: If you got stuff to do, I -- I can look after the baby.",
        "Vienna: Well -- well, wait. I thought we were gonna have lunch and talk about the wedding.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. We've got a while before we walk down the aisle though, don't we?",
        "Katie: Vienna's right. The sooner you make decisions about what you want, the less chance you have of any last-minute glitches. So I'm gonna leave you two to talk. I will check in later and see what you've decided.",
        "Henry: Thank you, Bubbles, for everything.",
        "Katie: It's my pleasure.",
        "Henry: So, what first?",
        "Vienna: Well, why don't you start with, uh, looking at locations?",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Vienna: And I'm gonna look for -- [Gasps] Oh, my God, I just found it! That's it!",
        "Henry: What? What is it, at a yacht?",
        "Vienna: My dress. My dress. I just found my wedding dress.",
        "Henry: Oh, okay. Well, let me -- let me take a look at it.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. Not until the wedding day. Wow. It's exquisite, just the way I dreamed it was -- with a minor few adjustments, of course. God, I love it. I love it.",
        "Henry: [Laughs] Well, let's -- let's get that designer on the phone. Where is it?",
        "Vienna: I don't know. I think it looks Parisian. And if it is, I just have to fly over and meet with the designer personally.",
        "Henry: Whatever it takes to get you what you want.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I love you so much.",
        "Henry: I love you, too, Liebchen. So, uh -- so, where is it? Is it, uh, Paris? Is it Milan?",
        "Vienna: [Laughs] Oh, my God! It's a miracle. We have angels watching over us. It is a vintage B.R.O.",
        "Henry: B.R.O.? Uh, isn't that --?",
        "Vienna: Yes, it's Barbara Ryan Originals. And she's our friend, and she's right here. Now -- now I don't have to fly across the world to have my dress made. Oh, my God, it's perfect.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Don't get me wrong. I'm glad that we're friends again.",
        "Chris: Me too.",
        "Alison: But I only agreed to help with the medical segment on Katie's show because I thought we were providing a valuable service.",
        "Chris: And because I'm fun to work with.",
        "Alison: Chris, what I'm trying to say is --",
        "Chris: I am not gonna listen to anything you say until you admit that you're having fun working on the show with me and Katie.",
        "Alison: Fine. Yes, I'm -- I'm having fun.",
        "Chris: Okay. That's all I wanted to hear.",
        "Alison: Okay, Chris, wait.",
        "Chris: Hmm?",
        "Alison: We need to clear things up.",
        "Chris: There's nothing to clear up.",
        "Alison: I just don't want things to get complicated. We've been having a good time.",
        "Chris: Well, the good times don't have to stop.",
        "Alison: And you were amazing at helping to smooth things out between me and Casey, and you even convinced me not to take that job in Chicago.",
        "Chris: And I was happy to do all of the above. You don't have to thank me.",
        "Alison: I'm not thanking you. I'm trying to figure out what it is that you're really up to.",
        "Chris: [Clears throat] What are you accusing me of, Alison?",
        "Alison: Did you get Katie to trick me into coming here so you could be alone with me?",
        "Chris: No, I didn't.",
        "Alison: [Sighs] Good. Glad to hear it.",
        "Chris: On the other hand, I'm kind of glad Katie did what she did.",
        "[Pager beeps]",
        "Alison: Chris, please.",
        "Chris: They just called a code on one of my patients, pediatrics. I got to go to the hospital.",
        "Alison: Well, I'll go with you.",
        "Chris: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What do you mean how do I get along with Paul? I already told you, things are great between us. Uh, of course, we had a difficult divorce, but we fought like crazy over Eliza, like any other couple would. But since I've been sick, especially now, he's been a great friend.",
        "Doctor: And his wife?",
        "Meg: Emily? I told you, I am trying very hard to be friendly with her for Eliza's sake. There's a little bit of tension, but that's only natural.",
        "Emma: Hello, Doctor. I have come to take my daughter home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: How cute is this, huh? Eliza's gonna love it. I'm not sure whether it's a cow or a horse. Neigh. Moo.",
        "Emily: [Chuckles] You're really gonna drop this, aren't you?",
        "Paul: Yeah. I mean, you don't want to talk about it, its fine. You'll talk to me about it when you're ready to talk to me about it.",
        "Emily: Okay, I'm ready. The call I got earlier wasn't work. It was Meg's doctor.",
        "Paul: Why would he call you?",
        "Emily: He wanted to know how her visit went. According to Meg, it was perfect.",
        "Paul: He didn't believe her?",
        "Emily: He was fact-checking.",
        "Paul: What did you tell him?",
        "Emily: The truth. I told him the truth -- that I came home, and I found you in bed sleeping, and there was Meg sleeping next to you.",
        "Paul: Oh, Emily --",
        "Emily: And she barely acknowledged the fact that she had done anything wrong.",
        "Paul: Why would you do something like that?",
        "Emily: And what about those comments she made?",
        "Paul: What comments? She was trying to get Eliza to sleep. That's all.",
        "Emily: The comments about how comfortable the bed was, reminding me that she was the first one to sleep there. Forget it. She -- do you think she just said those things unintentionally?",
        "Paul: You did not need to rat her out to her doctor.",
        "Emily: This man is treating her, Paul. He needs to know that she's not well. And I knew you sure as hell weren't gonna say anything.",
        "Paul: You had no right to sabotage Meg's relationship with her doctor.",
        "Emily: You know what your problem is, really? You don't believe that Meg is really sick.",
        "Paul: I know she's got problems. I know that.",
        "Emily: No, no, she is sick, and she belongs in a hospital where she can get better. You -- you're not helping her by lying for her. You're only jeopardizing her recovery.",
        "Paul: No, no, no, no. You are because you're putting ideas into her doctor's head that she's got some kind of a thing for me, which she doesn't. It's just not true.",
        "Emily: No, she does -- excuse me. She does have a thing for you. She needs help. I know that. And I'm gonna make sure she gets it.",
        "Paul: Right, out of the goodness of your heart. Nothing but concern for Meg's welfare.",
        "Emily: No. Because I love you, and I love Eliza, and I love our life together. And I am really sorry, but I get a bad vibe from her. She is dangerous, and she will be dangerous again.",
        "Paul: She took her little girl and laid down in a bed with her and fell to sleep.",
        "Emily: Well, I don't want her to do that again. Do you?",
        "Paul: No. I told her that nothing like that can happen again, and she understood.",
        "Emily: Good. So does her doctor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mama, you don't have to do this.",
        "Emma: I believe I do. I was one of the strongest advocates for keeping Meg here, but not any longer.",
        "Doctor: Why is that?",
        "Emma: Because the moment she left here, she crawled into Paul Ryan's bed.",
        "Meg: Mama, I already explained it. It was because of Eliza. It had nothing to do with Paul in any way.",
        "Emma: Meg, what it was was inappropriate. Now, you know that, which proves you know right from wrong. Now, I don't know what she's learned being locked up here, but from where I stand, she seems more insecure, more confused every day.",
        "Doctor: Mrs. Snyder, psychoanalysis is not an exact science.",
        "Emma: Neither is mothering. But as a mother, I know, I feel that it would be a mistake for Meg to stay here just one day longer. Now, look, I -- I know she's going to have a tough road ahead of her, but I think it's time for her to come home and be around her family to help her with that, around her family who loves her. I think it's time to be with them. And I also think that it's time for her to start mothering her child. I'm taking full responsibility. I am signing my daughter out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: I am sure it's a beautiful dress, Liebchen, uh, but there's lots of other dresses out there. What were you saying about choices? I mean, w -- why get stuck on this one dress?",
        "Vienna: Because this is it, and wedding dresses are like men, so once you find the one that is right for you, you know. So why keep looking?",
        "Henry: You know what? We should talk to Katie about this.",
        "Vienna: Katie? Why?",
        "Henry: Because she is the wedding planner. And if you really like this dress, she can probably find one just like that by a different designer.",
        "Vienna: I want this dress. And why do you care more about what Katie wants than what I want?",
        "Henry: Oh, I do care about what you want, my little Pepparkakor, but why do we need Barbara? I mean, if you like the dress, let's buy the dress, wear the dress, and cut out the middle woman.",
        "Vienna: And have my dress look like someone else's dress? No, absolutely not. I need Barbara to customize it for me. I'm gonna call her right now.",
        "Henry: Um, you know what? You know what? Let me talk to her.",
        "Vienna: You know nothing about dresses. I mean, at least not wedding dresses.",
        "Henry: Right, right, yeah, yeah. But, I mean, the idea is to get Barbara to say yes, right? And I've got some experience with that.",
        "Vienna: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: I mean that we're -- we're sort of related, you know? I can -- I can work that angle. And -- and then if she says yes, you can go get fitted and then all that.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but wouldn't it be easier if I just handle this?",
        "Henry: You know what, Liebchen? Let me do this for you, for us, yeah.",
        "Vienna: You know I can't resist you when you say it like that.",
        "Henry: Good, good. That's good, that's good. Okay, I'll take care of Barbara. Now, now, what are you gonna do?",
        "Vienna: Well, I'm gonna sit here and think about, um, getting married to you and how happy that makes me.",
        "Henry: Okay. Mwah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: That was the most incredible thing I have ever seen. I mean, that little boy's heart stopped beating. He stopped breathing. And now he's in his room, smiling and playing with his toys. And -- and how did you know it was an allergic reaction?",
        "Chris: It was the only thing we hadn't ruled out. We ran out of options.",
        "Alison: But shouldn't they have caught it earlier?",
        "Chris: Well, I mean, it's rare, but sometimes that's what happens with allergic reactions. I mean, there's no -- there's no hives. There's no itching. There's no signals to tell you that's what's going on.",
        "Alison: A couple more minutes and -- and he wouldn't have made it.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I mean, with so many days that are just no matter how hard you try, no matter what you do, you lose. I'm just glad today wasn't one of those days, you know? We got lucky.",
        "Alison: No, no. It wasn't luck, Chris. It was you. You were amazing. Whoa, Chris. What are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey, I was just thinking about you.",
        "Vienna: I'm thinking about you, too.",
        "Katie: Come on in. Your timing's perfect. I just put Jacob down for a nap. You want some coffee?",
        "Vienna: No, thank you.",
        "Katie: Oh, look at this bouquet. It is so beautiful. The detail is un -- ah. Look at that. Vienna, is something wrong?",
        "Vienna: I think so, and I think it's something awful. I need to talk to you about Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: We've got a problem.",
        "Barbara: There is no \"We\" anymore, so please take your problem and go.",
        "Henry: I am trying to do what you asked me to do. I am trying to stay away, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Try harder.",
        "Henry: Trust me, trust me, there is nothing harder than planning a wedding, thinking about you, and trying not to think about you.",
        "Barbara: I am not gonna fall back into this again. Please, please go.",
        "Henry: Barbara, that's just it. I can't stay gone, not without your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: How would you feel if you walked into our bedroom and found me in bed with -- with Dusty or Casey or one of my ex-lovers, and -- and they blew it off like it was nothing?",
        "Paul: Okay, fine, I would freak out, all right? And you didn't do that, okay? You didn't. And I know that you didn't call the doctor. I know that the doctor contacted you.",
        "Emily: Well, thank you for recognizing the distinction.",
        "Paul: Recognizing that you're right?",
        "Emily: [Laughs] Thank you. Can we go now? I want to get home to Eliza.",
        "Paul: Eliza's fine. She's with the nanny.",
        "Emily: She -- excuse me. Did -- did you see the way -- did you see the way Emma looked at us when -- when we told her that she was home with her nanny, like we don't deserve to raise the child?",
        "Paul: I don't care what Emma thinks, all right? She doesn't call the shots, not where Eliza is concerned. We are giving Eliza a lovely home, and we don't have to prove anything to anyone.",
        "Emily: You're right.",
        "Paul: That's right. Sometimes I'm right about things, too. Let's go.",
        "Emily: [Chuckles] Paul, I'll get the door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: This is my mother, Emma Snyder. And this is Taryn, Eliza's nanny.",

        "Taryn: It's easy with Eliza. Such a sweetie.",
        "Emma: Yes, she is. Oh, and we are going to have such a day out. We're going to have girls' day out. Yes, we are. Honey, get the blanket for her. It's still a little chilly outside.",
        "Taryn: Mr. Ryan didn't mention anything about this.",
        "Emma: Oh, no, no? Well, her mommy's taking her, and it's me, her grandmommy, so what'd be a problem with that, right? Such a pretty nanny you have there. Yes, it is. Well, come on. Let's go. We don't want to be too late getting back to the farm.",
        "Meg: Come here, Sweetie.",
        "Emma: We're gonna make some beautiful little cupcakes.",

        "Barbara: Oh, that's -- really? Which one? Where did she see it?",
        "Henry: Well, I -- I don't know. What does that matter? It doesn't matter! Listen, she wants it, and you have got to convince her to change her mind.",
        "Barbara: No, I don't have to do that. She can go buy the dress. It's okay.",
        "Henry: Yeah, but she wants it modified or changed or something. I don't know.",
        "Barbara: So have her buy it and take it to a seamstress.",
        "Henry: She won't settle for another seamstress. She wants you.",
        "Barbara: I see. Well, I'm very flattered, and I frankly would rather do the work on one of my designs myself.",
        "Henry: Barbara, stop. Please, please stop. Uh, you've got to say no. You cannot do this.",
        "Barbara: Why, Henry? Why not? It's business.",
        "Henry: Business?",
        "Barbara: Mm-hmm.",

        "Barbara: What does it matter?",
        "Henry: It matters -- it matters because a woman I'm going to marry will be here constantly. She'll be talking to you about me. She'll be talking to me about you. You will be a part of our lives, a part of the wedding. I couldn't take that!",
        "Barbara: No, I'm sure you couldn't.",
        "Henry: I didn't mean that the way it sounded.",
        "Barbara: Really? You mean honest?",
        "Henry: I just -- I miss you, Barbara. I'm -- I'm trying not to, but I do. And if Vienna were to wear one of your dresses, it would be very --",

        "Henry: Are you okay?",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Barbara: I'm fine. It's not you. I ran into Paul earlier.",

        "Barbara: He reprimanded me.",
        "Henry: 'Cause you and I were --",
        "Barbara: Because he doesn't approve of us. And even though I told him there is no more us anymore -- he's my son. He doesn't want me involved in his life anymore.",
        "Henry: Well, then, he's out of his mind, because anybody would be lucky to have you love them.",

        "Alison: Me. I am saying that.",
        "Chris: Listen, before you walk away -- will you let me explain? One of the big reasons I came back to Oakdale was to see where we stood.",
        "Alison: You're kidding me.",
        "Chris: Ali, why does that surprise you so much? You know how I felt about you before I left. I mean, do you think those feelings, they just disappear?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'd hoped that they had.",
        "Chris: Way to make a guy feel special. Come on, Ali. Are you telling me you feel nothing for me?",
        "Alison: Well, how could I say that? I mean, how could I ever feel that way? We've been through so much. My first time was with you, and it's a big deal.",
        "Chris: Yes, yes, it's a big deal -- a big deal for me, too. It always comes back to you, Ali. When I was away, you were all I ever thought about. And when I heard that you and Casey had fallen apart, I thought that maybe --",
        "Alison: No, don't do this to me. I -- I asked you how you felt about me because I wanted to make sure that you weren't getting the wrong idea.",
        "Chris: I'm not getting the wrong idea. I got the same idea I always had about you. I'm attracted to you. I like you.",

        "Chris: Why not?",

        "Chris: Well, who else is there?",
        "Alison: Casey! We were almost married. How do you think he would feel if I start dating you?",
        "Chris: Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this. How does he feel about you? Does he love you? You can't answer that. You can't answer that, Ali, so he has no say in this. This is between you and me. What do you say?",
        "Alison: No, no. I've messed up too many times when it comes to love and sex. I can't do this with you, not after what's happened. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: What, um -- what happened with Henry while I was gone?",
        "Katie: Well, he was so lonely and just lost without you. He was just devastated and so sad.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but you saw him a lot.",
        "Katie: Well, I was furious with him at first. You know, I blamed him for Brad's death, so I didn't want to talk to him. I didn't want to see him.",
        "Vienna: But that obviously changed.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it did because, well, in the end, he ended up being there for me, like he always is. And I realized that no matter what happened, I was very grateful to have him in my life.",
        "Vienna: Right. I see. So did something happen? This tea is a little warm. I need to put some cold water.",

        "Meg: You know, maybe we shouldn't have brought Eliza here, at least not without talking to Paul first.",
        "Emma: Shh. Let's just relax and enjoy having you and Eliza both home, okay?",
        "Meg: So, when do I get to see everyone? Uh, when is Holden coming home, and Jack and Janet?",
        "Emma: Well, you know, I was just thinking, since you weren't home for Christmas, um, maybe we should have the whole family over for dinner, huh? Would you like that? How does that sound?",
        "Meg: I would -- I would love that. I would love that. Can we do it?",
        "Emma: All I have to do is make a few phone calls. And I know everyone will be so happy to see you. And you can play with all your little cousins, yes.",
        "Meg: Eliza, that would be so much fun having the whole family together again. Wouldn't it, right?",
        "Emma: This is just the way it should be -- having your baby home with you. Case closed.",

        "Paul: So what happens the next time Meg's out of the hospital and wants to visit Eliza?",
        "Emily: She can see Eliza and play with her. I'm not gonna stop her.",
        "Paul: So you don't mind if Meg comes here?",
        "Emily: No, of course not, as long as she keeps her hands off my hot husband.",

        "Vienna: Yes, you said it was some sort of a catastrophe. What -- what is it?",
        "Henry: Well, it's -- actually, it's a small little problem, really. Uh, Barbara has said no to making the wedding dress.",
        "Vienna: No! She did? Why?",
        "Henry: Well, you know, she's busy. She doesn't really do that sort of stuff anymore.",
        "Vienna: My God. I can't believe this is happening.",
        "Henry: I'm so sorry. I know you had your heart set on that dress.",
        "Vienna: Oh, it was perfect.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Everything is falling apart.",
        "Katie: You guys, I'm so sorry. I just -- I have to leave for a little bit. Would you mind watching Jacob for me? I promise I won't be long.",
        "Henry: Where are you going?",
        "Katie: You need time alone with your fianc\u00e9e, and I'm giving it to you. He should stay asleep till I get back, so make yourselves at home, talk, kiss. Enjoy.",
        "Henry: Subtle, isn't she?",
        "Vienna: Katie's right. We haven't been talking or kissing enough. Is there something going on you should tell me about?",
        "Henry: Like what?",
        "[Jacob cries]",
        "Henry: Whoa, whoa. Somebody's up early. Uh, I'll go get him.",

        "Vienna: Hi. You're so good with him, Henry.",
        "Henry: We're old pals, aren't we?",
        "Vienna: So, you spent a lot of time over here while I was gone.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. Quite a bit, actually. Katie needed the help, and I wanted to get our relationship back on track. And, uh, it's not really a hardship looking after this little guy.",
        "Vienna: You know, our baby would have been just a little older than Jacob. I think about the baby we lost all the time. Do you?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, I do.",

        "Chris: Oh, there was an emergency at the hospital. I got called.",
        "Katie: After I went to all that trouble to get you two to the studio?",

        "Katie: Sorry.",
        "Chris: Don't be. It sort of worked. Went to the hospital, saved a life, and, uh, everything was great, so I tried to kiss her.",
        "Katie: Really? That's great. She needs to know you're interested.",
        "Chris: Yeah, well, now she knows, and she can't get far away fast enough.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Chris: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: What is wrong with that girl? [Sighs] This matchmaking stuff is hard work. I don't understand why people can't just wake up and see what's right in front of them!",

        "Paul: What the hell were you thinking?",

        "Paul: You had no right to take Eliza from my house without my permission.",
        "Emma: Your permission? Meg is her mother. She doesn't need your say so.",
        "Paul: There are rules, Emma. You know that.",
        "Emma: The rules are changing. Meg has been released from Deerbrook. She's home for good.",
        "Emily: What? They -- they released you? They think you're better?",
        "Emma: Yes, they do. They think it's time for her to take her life back -- past time.",
        "Meg: You know, as far as custody is concerned, I'm sure Paul and I can work something out.",
        "Emma: You don't have to work anything out. Meg is her mother. She lives here. This is her home. This is where they both belong.",
        "Paul: Meg can live wherever she wants, but Eliza lives with me.",
        "Emma: For now.",
        "Paul: Where is all of this coming from? Emma, what did I do, aside from give Eliza a home when Meg was unable to do so?",
        "Emma: I have never been comfortable with the two of you raising my granddaughter.",
        "Emily: You have got to be kidding me.",
        "Emma: Considering your past behavior, I mean, it's only a matter of time before some other bomb goes off in that house.",
        "Emily: How dare you. We love Eliza.",
        "Emma: Love her? You know, a child needs attention. She needs values. You know, she's not some piece of furniture to be pushed off on some nanny and ignored.",
        "Paul: Whoa, whoa, hold on. I have never ignored my daughter.",
        "Meg: Mama, you're not being fair.",
        "Paul: Can we all just calm down for a second here? Now, Meg's out of the hospital. That's great. If she wants to visit Eliza, that's great, too. But Emily and I -- we deserved at least a phone call, don't you think?",
        "Meg: I apologize for that.",
        "Emma: You don't have to apologize to him, not after what he's done to you.",
        "Emily: What are you talking about, Emma?",
        "Emma: My daughter was a healthy, strong, independent woman before she became involved with him. You have manipulated her. You have used her. You have broken her heart, time and time again! Not Damian, but you. You are the one who made her end up in that hospital. And I am not going to have the same thing happen to my granddaughter. Eliza is a Snyder. She is not a -- a Stewart or a Ryan or a Stenbeck.",
        "Paul: Thank God she's not a Stenbeck. And I'm not a Stenbeck otherwise I would be calling the police right now and having you arrested for kidnapping.",
        "Meg: Paul, don't.",
        "Emma: Oh, please, Meg. Don't let him scare you.",
        "Paul: I am still Eliza's legal guardian parent, and I am taking her home with me right now.",
        "Meg: I'll get her things.",
        "Paul: No, she doesn't need anything. She has everything she needs at Fairwinds, including two parents more than capable of raising her.",
        "Emma: This is just the beginning.",
        "Meg: What are you doing?",
        "Emma: What I should have done long ago.",

        "Katie: I don't even know why I'm bothering. I have a baby at home. I get spit up on every five minutes.",
        "Chris: I can relate. It's part of the job. But I cannot let you walk around like that. Here. Take this.",
        "Katie: No, no. It's chilly out.",
        "Chris: No, I insist. What kind of doctor would I be if I let you walk around in wet clothes?",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Chris: Want me to hold it?",
        "Katie: Thank you for the jacket.",
        "Chris: I just copped a feel, gave you my jacket. My teenage self would be quite psyched.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] Well, as the official matchmaker of your adult self, I will do damage control. You rushed the kiss, but it's not a fatal error. I will figure out what your next move with Alison should be and will let you know.",

        "Barbara: You know, it's just not possible. I don't do that kind of work anymore.",
        "Vienna: Oh, but Barbara, it would mean so much to me if you do it. I'll pay anything. And I promise you, you're gonna get a lot of good publicity. And quite frankly, I think you owe it to me after what happened between you and Henry.",
        "Barbara: All right, fine. I will design your dress for you. Oh.",
        "Vienna: Thank you. Can we get started right away?",
        "Barbara: Sure. Um, paper and pencil over there.",
        "Vienna: Okay.",
        "Barbara: I'll get the measuring tape.",
        "Vienna: Oh, and I have a list of all the changes I want. Can I just leave it here?",
        "Barbara: That would be fine.",
        "Vienna: It's so nice of you to come out of retirement this way.",
        "Barbara: I haven't retired. I'm too young to retire. I've simply moved on to other areas of my business. Arms up.",
