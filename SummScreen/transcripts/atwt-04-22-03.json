        "Hal: About me thinking that you had something to do with Barbara's disappearance --",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no, no. I'm -- I'm tired. That's all. With the wedding and everything that's going on.",
        "Hal: Well, Will's tucked in to his computer. He shouldn't be a problem.",
        "Emily: Will is never a problem. So go. Go to work. The sooner you go to work, the sooner you get to come home.",
        "Hal: Wouldn't it be nice if it really did work that way? Whoa.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Hal: Hi.",
        "Carly: I would have called, but my phone died.",
        "Hal: Oh, Parker Joe, will you please tell your mommy that she never has to call when she brings you over? Can you give me a big hug? Oh. All right, you be good, okay? All right. I'll call if I get held up.",
        "Carly: Okay. So I need a huge favor. What's new?",
        "Emily: What's up?",
        "Carly: Can Parker and I crash here tonight? I'm planning on looking for a place first thing tomorrow morning, and I just can't bear the thought of another night at Emma's.",
        "Emily: Yeah, sure. Not a problem. Why don't you run upstairs? Will's waiting for you. Go on.",
        "Carly: Oh, good.",
        "Emily: So can I get you a cup of coffee?",
        "Carly: Oh, I wish, but I can't, you know, with the baby.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's right. Where is my mind? Okay. I'll get you something else, then.",
        "Carly: It's Hal, isn't it? He thinks that you kidnapped Barbara. Jack was all over me about it.",
        "Emily: Jack thinks I'm the one who kidnapped --",
        "Carly: Well, you and me and Rose. We're the perfect suspects, right? Don't worry about it. Jack's got a forensics team over at the cabin. He's got people looking through her suite and combing through her car. He'll figure out who really did it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hagwood: That cell phone we found in Barbara Ryan's car? It's hers.",
        "Jack: Any usable prints?",
        "Hagwood: Wiped clean.",
        "Henry: A troop does not a boy scout leader make.",
        "Jack: What the hell's that?",
        "Hagwood: Some whack job we found in the woods by the cabin.",
        "Jack: You think he's connected to Barbara's kidnapping?",
        "Hagwood: Well, he says he's innocent, but that was before we accused him of anything. Understand?",
        "Jack: Bring him in.",
        "Henry: What is -- what is -- a man can't go for a walk in the woods?",
        "Jack: Henry Coleman. Henry here's a thief and a blackmailer. I guess we can add kidnapping to that list.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You were supposed to convince Paul that Rose was involved in my kidnapping, not give her an alibi.",
        "Dusty: You want to do this in the hall?",
        "Barbara: You disobeyed a direct order.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Dusty: I don't take orders from anyone.",
        "Barbara: Oh. What a brave boy. Find yourself someone new to take care of all of your problems? To pay Molly McKinnon all the money you owe her? Take care of all of your friends back in Chicago? I certainly hope so. Because the bank of Barbara's closed. You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: You don't think I'm gonna pull this trigger, do you?",
        "Marshall: Yes, I do. That's why I'm trying to help you.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie, give me the gun. He's not worth it.",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "Bonnie: Mom? Mom? Mom?",
        "Marshall: Oh, no, Jessica.",
        "Bonnie: Get up. Get off of her. Mom? Mommy?",
        "Isaac: Oh, no, no, no, no.",
        "Bonnie: Mommy? Mommy?",
        "Isaac: Bonnie -- Bonnie, give me the gun. Give me the -- give me the gun. It's gonna be okay. Give me the gun. Bonnie?",
        "Bonnie: I didn't -- I didn't -- I didn't see her. I didn't know where she --",
        "Isaac: It's okay.",
        "Bonnie: I didn't mean to.",
        "Marshall: Hello, this is Marshall Travers. We need an ambulance at the Lakeview Towers.",
        "Bonnie: Mommy. Help her. Somebody help her. Somebody help her, please! Mommy!",
        "[Siren wails]",
        "Jessica: Bonnie -- where's Bonnie?",
        "EMT #1: Your daughter's right here, Ms. Griffin.",
        "Bonnie: Mom -- mom -- mom, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Jessica: It's okay.",
        "Bonnie: I'm sorry.",
        "Jessica: Listen to me. It's not your fault. You hear me? It's not your fault.",
        "Bonnie: Mom? I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to hurt you. I love you. [Monitor beeps] what's happening? What's going on? What's happening?",
        "EMT #2: Her pressure's falling.",
        "EMT #1: Nothing at the point of entry.",
        "EMT #2: We've got a bleeder!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're gonna fire me, huh? Go ahead. I only took this job to help you out.",
        "Barbara: You took this job because you needed the money. Paul was this close to believing that Rose was involved in my kidnapping. All you had to do was support that belief.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah? And then what?",
        "Barbara: He would have left her.",
        "Dusty: You see? This is why you're gonna lose your son. You don't even know who he is.",
        "Barbara: Really? And you do?",
        "Dusty: Do you know what was going on when I went down to the lounge? Paul was comforting Rose. He said his love wasn't going anywhere -- even if she had kidnapped you.",
        "Barbara: I don't believe that.",
        "Dusty: Believe it. Believe it. He promised that he would understand, given what you did to her in the past. And what was I supposed to do? Waltz in there? Alienate both of them? Give them a good reason to elope together? I don't think so.",
        "Barbara: I think you just wanted to scuttle my plan because you had one of your own. Figuring that I wouldn't pay you if I didn't need you anymore.",
        "Dusty: You do need me. Do I need your money? Yes. Did I sabotage your plan? Yes, because your plan would have backfired and ruined any possibility of ever getting to Rose.",
        "Barbara: All right, and you wouldn't want to give up that opportunity, would you? You just want to pretend that I'm holding a gun to your head. You've got a lech for that woman. I can see it.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's where you make your second mistake. Thinking you know anything about me. Or her.",
        "Barbara: Oh, tell me all about her.",
        "Dusty: She loves your son. She'd make him happy.",
        "Barbara: That's what you think. You see, that's the problem. Paul has what you want. And that's what this is really all about. You want her for yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Ask yourself something here, Detective Snyder. Why would a guy like me get himself involved in a conspiracy to kidnap the ex-wife of the chief of detectives, huh?",
        "Jack: Who said anything about a conspiracy, Henry?",
        "Henry: Every cop since Wyatt Earp.",
        "Jack: What were you doing in the woods?",
        "Henry: I -- I was minding my own business.",
        "Jack: And you can swear to that? You didn't chloroform Barbara and lock her in a cabin?",
        "Henry: Chloroform? Please. Come on, come on. The only thing I buy at the drugstore is toothpaste. Chloroform.",
        "Jack: Okay. Fine, we'll get a polygraph tech in here, we'll take care of this right away.",
        "Henry: Polygraph tech? Are those the guys that --",
        "Jack: If you're innocent, you've got no problem taking a lie detector test, right?",
        "Henry: No, not at all. In fact, I'd love to. I would. But -- but since a polygraph test is inadmissible, I feel it would be wrong for me to endorse their usage.",
        "Jack: Don't leave town, Henry.",
        "Henry: Can I go now?",
        "Jack: Remember this day, okay, Coleman? 'Cause if I find out you were involved after I asked you to come clean, it'll be the last happy day you ever have. Now, get out of here. Now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[machine beeps]",
        "Dusty: Barbara, it's Dusty. The renovations on Rose's beauty shop are about to begin. I need that $25,000 fast. Where are you that you don't have your cell phone?",
        "[Machine beeps] Barbara, it's me again. Where are you? I left you half a dozen messages. The money never showed up in my account. I need that money today. Call me.",
        "[Machine beeps]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: I want that room sealed off. Elevator, stairs. I want a statement from every occupant of every room, two floors up, two floors down. I don't care what time it is. Wake 'em up.",
        "Margo: Whoa, Hal, who was that?",
        "Hal: Fredericks.",
        "Margo: Fredericks? You put Frederick's on the Lakeview thing? I just drove right past there.",
        "Hal: I need you at the hospital. Fredericks can handle the door-to-door, which is about all we've got since the vic and all the eyewitnesses left the scene before the police were even called.",
        "Margo: Well, how'd that happen? I mean, it was on the scanner not ten minutes after the shot occurred.",
        "Hal: The shooting occurred in Marshall Travers' room. Jessica's been shot.",
        "Margo: No, I just left her at the Lakeview. We had just served Travers with a restraining order. She wouldn't go anywhere near him.",
        "Hal: All I know is that she was shot in his room.",
        "Margo: How bad is it?",
        "Hal: I need you to be at that hospital.",
        "Margo: Ben? What about Ben? Does Ben know?",
        "Hal: No, not yet. He's still in lockup.",
        "Margo: All right, well, Tom's down in night court trying to get him released, so I'll call Tom.",
        "Hal: We're not going to tell anybody anything. Not until we find out her condition.",
        "Margo: Why? It's that bad? Okay. I'll let you know what I find out. Okay. Thanks, Hal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: Mom? Mom? Wait, wait, where are you taking her? Where are you taking her?",
        "John: Your mother needs surgery. She's being taken to O.R.",
        "Isaac: But she's gonna be all right.",
        "John: The bullet has lodged in her chest. There is internal bleeding. Now, that's all I can tell you right now.",
        "Bonnie: I -- I did this to her. It's my fault.",
        "Isaac: She's gonna be okay. Your mother's a fighter.",
        "Bonnie: I did this to her.",
        "Marshall: Dr. Dixon, Bonnie is obviously in shock. She needs to be examined.",
        "Isaac: Who asked you, all right?",
        "Marshall: Isaac, the police are gonna be here any minute, and they'll want to question Bonnie. Now, if she's been examined by a doctor and found to be in shock, they won't be able to put anything she says in the record. Isn't that right, doctor?",
        "John: Yes, Bonnie should be examined. Come along, Bonnie. Let me take a look.",
        "Bonnie: But wait, my mom needs me.",
        "Isaac: I'll find you. Don't you worry. And you -- stay away from her.",
        "Marshall: Isaac, Bonnie's gonna need a lawyer. Right away, all right? Get her one.",
        "Isaac: Why? What are you gonna tell the cops?",
        "Marshall: Exactly what Bonnie would say if she weren't in shock. The gun went off. Make sure she uses those words -- \"the gun went off.\"",
        "Isaac: You have all the answers, don't you?",
        "Marshall: Look, Isaac, if you want to protect Bonnie --",
        "Isaac: Well, it's a little late for that, now that you've raped her mother. That's why Bonnie had a gun, 'cause she couldn't take it anymore, watching you dismantle her mother piece-by-piece. So, no, counselor, you keep your advice. You can't fix this! Bonnie is in a world of trouble, and Jessica -- you heard John. Anything could happen. She could die. And the one person she wants by her side, Ben -- can't even have that. He's locked up because of you. All because of you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So did Jack happen to say anything about what he found out?",
        "Carly: Jack's not gonna tell me anything. He believes me when I tell him that I wasn't involved, but he doesn't trust me to keep my mouth shut. And if Craig was involved -- do you have tea to go with this water?",
        "Emily: Tea. I'm sorry. Chamomile okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah, it's perfect. The thing is, I wouldn't want to know, you know, if Craig were involved. It would just complicate things. And the truth is, no matter how it happened, I think that Barbara deserved it. You saw me the day she lit into me at the farm. I was a mess. I couldn't draw, I couldn't think, there was no way I could come up with something with her poisoning the air.",
        "Emily: But kidnapping, Carly --",
        "Carly: Please. After what she did to us? I still wake up in the middle of the night feeling for my face, afraid that I'm still locked in that spa.",
        "Emily: I know. Me, too.",
        "Carly: I hate that woman. I hate that woman, and I always will.",
        "Parker: Mommy?",
        "Carly: Just a second, honey!",
        "[Rapping on door]",
        "Emily: What the hell are you doing here? What if Hal was home?",
        "Henry: Hal's not home. He's at the police station. You want to know how I know that?",
        "Emily: You go right now. Go.",
        "Henry: You and me both, baby. But I have been warned not to leave town.",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Henry: \"What?\" \"What?\" They brought me in for kidnapping Barbara Ryan.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Henry: Why? Because -- because like a good boy scout, I went down to the cabin, which no one bothered to tell me --",
        "Emily: Oh, my God.",
        "Henry: -- Emily, was crawling with cops.",
        "Emily: I'm so sorry. Everything happened so fast, Henry. I'm sorry.",
        "Henry: You're sorry? You're sorry? Listen to me, okay? Are you listening? I swear to you, if you do not get me out of this mess, I will take both you and Rose down with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Making any headway?",
        "Jack: Some. Hey, I heard about Jessica. You want me on that?",
        "Hal: I've got Margo and Frederick's on it.",
        "Jack: Fredericks?",
        "Hal: He's a good kid, Jack.",
        "Jack: Keep telling yourself that.",
        "Hal: So what do you have?",
        "Jack: Nothing that adds up. Montgomery's involved. He's got to be. Only I can't -- I can't figure out how. Then there's Henry Coleman.",
        "Hal: Henry Coleman?",
        "Jack: Yeah. We picked him up in the woods, heading towards the cabin, nervous as a gnat. And here is something even weirder. We retrieved Barbara's cell phone that she left in her car after she was abducted. Almost every single message is from Dusty Donovan.",
        "Hal: Well, what are the messages?",
        "Jack: \"Where's the 25 grand, Barbara? I need that money right now.\"",
        "Hal: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know about that.",
        "Jack: Well, and then there's Barbara, accusing Emily and Rose.",
        "Hal: And Carly.",
        "Jack: Carly's not involved, Hal.",
        "Hal: You're saying Emily is?",
        "Jack: No, that's not what I'm saying. It's just that Emma had Carly under lock and key.",
        "Hal: And Emily had her watch. Which I stepped right into.",
        "Jack: You thought the watch Barbara had was Emily's?",
        "Hal: And said as much. And she started waving the watch in front of me.",
        "Jack: Ouch.",
        "Hal: Yeah, she's not happy.",
        "Jack: Listen, don't worry about the watch. We've got guys tracing that. We'll figure it out.",
        "Hal: So what's your next move?",
        "Jack: Well, I think it's time I had another little chat with Barbara.",
        "Hal: Well, better you than me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey. Where's Ben?",
        "Hal: Still in lockup. Did you get the judge to release him?",
        "Tom: I got the judge to promise to release him.",
        "Hal: What does that mean?",
        "Tom: Well, he's still pretty angry about the mistrial. He slapped Ben with a huge fine, and now he's gonna make him wait till he faxes the order up.",
        "Marshall: Where's Ben?",
        "Hal: This is none of your business, Travers.",
        "Marshall: Ben. Look, have you heard about Jessica?",
        "Ben: Heard what? Tom?",
        "Tom: I've been in court.",
        "Marshall: Jessica was shot tonight, Ben.",
        "Ben: What?",
        "Marshall: She's in surgery over at Memorial. It's critical.",
        "Ben: Hal, you've got to let me out of here, man.",
        "Hal: Officially, you haven't been released, Ben.",
        "Marshall: And unofficially?",
        "Ben: Jessica is in critical condition. There's no guarantee.",
        "Tom: As soon as the judge faxes over the order.",
        "Ben: Look, I was cited for contempt of court. I will pay the fine. But don't make me stand here while Jessica fights for her life.",
        "Hal: Ben, without a written order --",
        "Ben: Fine.",
        "Hal: Ben! Ben! That's police property on your wrists.",
        "Ben: Please.",
        "Hal: Take 'em off.",
        "Ben: Thank you.",
        "Tom: I'll go with him.",
        "Hal: All right.",
        "Tom: All right. Let's go.",

        "Isaac: How are you doing?",
        "Bonnie: I just -- I just wanted him to admit what he did. I just wanted him to say it out loud that he raped my mother. But he wouldn't. He just stood there with this arrogant look on his face, telling me to get out. And so -- I wanted to hurt him. I wanted to make him feel powerless, to take something away from him against his will. But never -- never in a million years did I expect for my mother to be the one to get hurt. Never.",
        "Isaac: It's not your fault, Bonnie. The gun went off. That's what happened, and that's all you need to know.",
        "Bonnie: She's gonna die.",
        "Isaac: No, no, of course not.",
        "Bonnie: She is. She is. That's why she said this -- that this wasn't my fault. Because she knows -- she knows she's gonna die.",
        "Isaac: You don't know what you're saying.",
        "Bonnie: Because I shot her. Because I shot her.",
        "Isaac: You don't know what you're saying.",
        "Margo: Bonnie. You shot your mother?",
        "Isaac: No, you can't question her. Not without a lawyer present.",
        "John: Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, what are you doing here? She's still under my care.",
        "Margo: Fine, fine, fine. I will question her after she's released.",
        "Isaac: What are doing, Margo? I thought you were Jessica's friend.",
        "Margo: I am Jessica's friend, but I'm also the detective investigating her shooting. Now, I don't like this any more than you do. But Jessica will be the first one to tell you you can't bury the truth. No matter how much you want to.",

        "Chris: Earlier today. The matron at the prison called the hospital.",
        "Hal: Is she sick?",
        "Chris: Not exactly. But I'm the doctor off record.",
        "Hal: Oh, and pulled a string.",
        "Chris: She says that her cellmates are planning a murder.",
        "Hal: Yeah, that sounds like Alison.",
        "Chris: And that they know that she's onto them. She's afraid that they'll hurt her to keep her from blowing their cover.",
        "Hal: Oh. So she wants to convince you to get to your brother so he can get to a judge so he can take her to Lakeview, and there she has an appointment for a pedicure.",
        "Chris: Look, I know Alison has a history of lying.",
        "Hal: I can't say that I blame her for lying. I'd lie, too, if I were in her shoes. I'd want to get out of there, too. But, Chris, you can't accept her story at face value.",

        "Dusty: I know you're not gonna believe this. But Rose had nothing to do with your kidnapping. Why? She was with me the entire day. And if I pretended like she wasn't, she would have known something was up.",
        "Barbara: She was with you?",
        "Dusty: What did I just say?",
        "Barbara: And you saw her make phone calls to friends? Co-conspirators?",

        "Barbara: What does my personal communication have to do with you, Jack?",
        "Jack: You asked her for money several times, mentioned Rose.",
        "Barbara: Dusty, you don't have to respond to this.",
        "Dusty: No, it's okay. I'm happy to respond. If I can help the police, I'd love to. You may not know this, but I'm a financial analyst. I'm handling a few of Barbara's investments. I'm also Rose's partner in her new beauty venture. Anyway, regarding her disappearance, yeah. I'm sure I left her a lot of messages. I was concerned.",
        "Jack: Well, it sounded like you were desperate. But not about Barbara. About the money you needed. For Rose. Which -- which makes me think something else is going on here, Barbara. Maybe something you didn't want me to find out about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Kidnapping, Emily, that is a life sentence.",
        "Emily: Stop it, all right? Nobody is going to jail here.",
        "Henry: Why don't you tell that to Officer Jack, okay? He wanted me to take a polygraph test.",
        "Emily: There's nothing to connect us, all right? Nothing to tie us to the crime. If you'd just be quiet.",
        "Henry: What -- what about the water gun?",
        "Emily: Water gun?",
        "Henry: Never mind. Never mind. Forget I brought it up. Forget it.",
        "Emily: Would you just -- you have to be quiet, okay? Keep your mouth shut and stay away from me and Rose.",
        "Henry: Fine, I would love to. Fine. But you listen to me, all right? I swear to God, if you two sell me out, you will regret it.",
        "Emily: Hi. How's Parker?",
        "Carly: You kidnapped Barbara? You and Rose and -- and Henry?",
        "Emily: I want you to forget everything you just heard, okay? Shut the door.",
        "Carly: What? With Jack all over me and Hal all over you? I can't forget it. What were you thinking, Emily?",
        "Emily: It was Craig's idea.",
        "Carly: Of course it was Craig's idea. Craig has everything to gain. But you and Rose, why would you do this? This is kidnapping. My God, Emily, you're married to a cop. Rose is engaged to Barbara's son. What could possibly possess you to do something so ridiculously, utterly stupid?",
        "Emily: You. We did it for you, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: You've been out to talk to Alison before.",
        "Chris: And the last time I was out there, she told me to stay away. That her cellmates would resent the fact that she was allowed visitors. So I haven't been back until now. But as soon as I saw that knife, I understood why she broke down and called me.",
        "Hal: Chris, do you know how many times they toss those cells, looking for exactly that very thing?",
        "Chris: Which means that that kind of thing is available, that her cellmates could have gotten their hands on it.",
        "Hal: All I'm saying to you is that Alison -- I wouldn't put it past her to get her hands on a shiv just to make you think that she was in danger.",
        "Chris: Look, look, I know that Alison's lies have made your life hell for the past year. But she's new to the system, Hal. You really think that she could get her hands on contraband this soon? She's frightened.",
        "Hal: Good. I'm glad. Maybe next time, she'll think twice before she does something stupid.",
        "Chris: Can't you see that this kind of thing is new for her? Asking for help? Coming forward? Instead of running around the rules all the time. I wasn't wrong about Will, and I'm not wrong about Alison.",
        "Hal: Okay. She claims that her cellmates are gonna stab somebody. Only she doesn't know who, and she doesn't know when.",
        "Chris: And she's scared to death that they'll hurt her now that she's stumbled onto their secret.",
        "Hal: All right. I'll make some inquiries.",
        "Chris: Tonight?",
        "Hal: It's past lockdown. Nothing's gonna happen tonight. First thing tomorrow, I'll call the matron.",
        "Chris: Thank you.",
        "Hal: Do me a favor. Just don't mention this to Emily.",
        "Chris: Why would I do that? I mean, there's nothing that she could do.",
        "Hal: No, she could do plenty. Just nothing constructive.",
        "Chris: You're sure Alison's safe?",
        "Hal: There's guards on every floor. Go home, get some sleep, Chris.",
        "Chris: She's all alone, lieutenant.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: All right. Craig came to us 'cause he was worried about you. We all were. But we weren't about to commit a felony, all right? Or get mixed up with the likes of him. No way.",
        "Carly: So what changed your mind?",
        "Emily: That day at Emma's. Barbara was tearing into you. You know, it's like you said before. She always gets away with hurting people, you know, and I couldn't take it anymore. And Rose, she had her own axe to grind. Barbara's all over Paul, and she can't take it anymore, and Craig said that even if she did escape and ran around Oakdale telling everyone she'd been kidnapped, nobody would believe her because everybody knows she's crazy, and we weren't gonna let her take away your company, not without a fight, Carly.",
        "Carly: Emily, even if Jack and Hal think that Barbara is crazy, they're still gonna follow up on a kidnapping.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but you have nothing to worry about, okay? Because you had nothing to do with it. You didn't even know about it until I just told you. Hal -- I just cannot believe -- I can't tell him the truth. I wanted to tell him the truth early, but I just -- I hate lying to that man.",
        "Carly: Do you think that I'm going to enjoy lying to Jack? Although at least this time, I'm not doing it to save myself.",
        "Emily: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "Carly: Look, Emily -- you and me and Rose, we've gotten out of worse situations. We'll be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Tell me about these messages you left, Dusty.",
        "Barbara: The messages on my cell phone are none of your business, Jack.",
        "Jack: I thought you said you wanted this case solved.",
        "Barbara: No, what I want is you out of here.",
        "Jack: So what -- what would Rose make of these calls? And Paul? His best friend, calling his mother, asking her for money for his fianc\u00e9e?",
        "Barbara: If you discuss any of my business outside of the department, I will sue you. Do you understand me?",
        "Jack: Oh, I understand, Barbara. I'm understanding a lot. Take it easy, Dusty. Barbara.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Barbara: If he talks to Paul and Paul thinks there's some connection between us, he will never understand. He will never forgive me. Do you -- do you see that?",
        "Dusty: That was always a part of the risk.",
        "Barbara: And you are responsible. What were you thinking, leaving messages linking me to Rose?",
        "Dusty: What are you talking about? I wouldn't have even called you if you trusted me with the money instead of doling it out to me piece by -- ah, who cares? You fired me. It's not my problem anymore. See ya, Barbara.",

        "Ben: John?",
        "John: Yeah?",
        "Ben: Jessica -- is she still in surgery?",
        "John: Yeah. She's not out yet. Listen, the bullet is lodged in her chest, and there's internal bleeding.",
        "Ben: Who's doing the surgery?",
        "John: Rabinowitz.",
        "Margo: Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Tom: I was working on Ben's release so he could be here with Jessica. And now I'm representing Bonnie.",
        "Margo: You are? Since when?",
        "Tom: Since Marshall filled me in.",
        "Margo: I am not the enemy here.",
        "Tom: I know that. I know that.",
        "Margo: I know that you know and I know, but I want everyone to know that Jessica is my best friend.",
        "Tom: Well, then, let me represent her daughter so you can go ahead and do your job. Has Bonnie made a statement?",
        "Margo: No, not officially, but I did overhear her say that she was responsible for the shooting.",
        "Marshall: Had she been Mirandized?",
        "Tom: You know what, Marshall? I will handle this from here. Thanks.",
        "Margo: She's in exam room one.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Margo: Marshall, I do have a few questions for you. Starting with, why was Jessica in your room? You were given an order to stay 100 yards from her at all times.",
        "Marshall: She arrived unannounced and uninvited. I never had the chance to ask her why.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, all right. She arrived in your room and then what?",
        "Marshall: A gun went off. Jessica was shot.",
        "Margo: Whose gun was it?",
        "Marshall: I don't know.",
        "Margo: But it wasn't yours.",
        "Marshall: No.",
        "Margo: Did you pull the trigger?",
        "Marshall: No.",
        "Margo: Was the gun ever in your possession?",
        "Marshall: No.",
        "Margo: Why did you call a private ambulance service?",
        "Marshall: Jessica was bleeding. I was frightened. I wanted to get her help as quickly as possible. Those were my only thoughts.",
        "Margo: You're an officer of the court. Why did you leave the scene?",
        "Marshall: It was an error in judgment.",
        "Margo: Whose gun was it?",
        "Marshall: I don't recall.",
        "Margo: Who pulled the trigger?",
        "Marshall: I don't know that anyone did. A gun went off. It was an accident.",
        "Margo: Bonnie has been a thorn in your side since you came to this town. Now you're protecting her. Why?",
        "Marshall: Because her mother can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: It's better when you put the cookies in the ice cream. [Phone ringing] hello?",
        "Hal: Hey. Looks like it's gonna be a long night.",
        "Emily: The Barbara Ryan case?",
        "Hal: There was a shooting at the Lakeview. Plus, a couple other things came up. Carly and Parker still there?",
        "Emily: Yeah, they're still here. The boys wanted a sleepover, so they're gonna spend the night.",
        "Hal: Good. That's great.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey. Emma -- Emma told me you were here.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Parker wanted to see Will, and I just -- I just couldn't stand one more night --",
        "Jack: I understand. I totally understand. So -- you gonna be moving to a hotel or your own place?",
        "Carly: Tomorrow.",
        "Jack: Look, I wanted to make it clear that I know you had nothing to do with Barbara's abduction. And whatever Craig did, I know you got this shot on your own. Because you're talented. I'm sure your designs are great. And the fact that you -- you pulled it off with all the restrictions everybody was putting on you, including myself -- I'm just glad it all worked out. You should be proud of yourself.",
        "Carly: I am. Thank you.",
        "Jack: So you're okay? The baby -- the baby's okay?",
        "Carly: Oh, yeah, fine.",
        "Jack: Great. Then I should go. You sure you're okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Okay?",
        "Carly: Yes, just a little tired. But thank you for stopping by. I appreciate you sticking up for me.",
        "Jack: You get some rest.",
        "Emily: So what -- what did Jack want?",
        "Carly: It's fine. It's fine. He just said that he knew that I didn't have anything to do with what happened with Barbara.",
        "Emily: You know, it's gonna be a lot worse if Hal and Jack find out the truth all on their own.",
        "Carly: Well, you're right about that. Well, I guess that's why we have to make sure that they don't find out. Now, is there any way that Barbara could prove it was you guys?",
        "Emily: No. Absolutely not. At least I hope not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I want an apology for that business with Paul. Giving Rose an alibi. I'll cut you off. Okay, fine. I overstepped. I was angry. If you want Rose D'Angelo to yourself, what business is it of mine? But don't you think she's rather common?",
        "Dusty: I owe Molly McKinnon 25 grand. I want that money in my account tomorrow morning. I want our deal back in place. Same deal. If I break up Rose and Paul, I get the agreed fee. If I get Rose into bed, you pay me double.",
        "Barbara: I need to know you're not gonna sell me out.",
        "Dusty: I need to know that when you speak to me, you do it calmly. Now, we both have to settle for the fact that you need me.",
        "Barbara: I need to get Rose D'Angelo out of my son's life.",
        "Dusty: Good luck with that.",
        "Barbara: Okay, fine. Sit. You win.",
        "Dusty: You need to understand something. I can walk from the people I owe. You lose Paul, you lose your son forever.",
        "Barbara: You'll get your money.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Okay, I've given her a mild sedative for shock. You can take her home now.",
        "Tom: Given Bonnie's condition and the fact that she's under the influence of a controlled substance, I assume that she cannot be responsible for anything that she might say?",
        "John: Correct.",
        "Tom: Well, given that fact, Bonnie can't be questioned tonight.",
        "Margo: All right, you are all just denying the inevitable. I already overheard her say that she was responsible for the shooting.",
        "Marshall: When? Tonight? Before she was Mirandized? When she was still in shock? Detective Hughes, without a corroborating witness, you don't have enough to arrest her.",
        "Margo: Nobody wants to arrest her. Nobody wants any of this to be happening. Will you please set aside time tomorrow when I can talk to Bonnie?",
        "Isaac: Hey, hey, how you feeling?",
        "Bonnie: Is my mom okay?",
        "Isaac: Let me get you home. Tom's gonna be handling things from our end, okay?",
        "Bonnie: Tom?",
        "Tom: Yeah, you know, we're gonna -- we're gonna talk at home.",
        "Marshall: Thanks, Dr. Dixon.",
        "John: Your diagnosis of shock, though intended to impede justice, was correct. A sedative was called for.",
        "Marshall: How's Jessica?",
        "John: She's out of surgery. Ben's with her.",
        "Marshall: Look, I don't want to intrude, but -- I really need to know that she's okay.",
        "John: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Ben: Jessica? Just wanted you to know that you made it through the procedure and your heart rate is strong and your blood pressure is better than mine. Thank you, Lord. When I heard that you were in surgery, I froze. The thought of you -- the thought of anything happening to you -- I can't lose you, baby. I'm sorry. All this time wasted on Travers, it's not about Travers. It's about you. It's all about you. I'm afraid of losing you. And now -- you have to hang on, baby, because Bonnie needs you and I need you. I love you so much."
