        "Jack: How are the kids? ",
        "Carly: Fine. They're good. How's J.J.? \n",
        "Jack: Ben's taking him down for more tests.\r\n",
        "Carly: He must be so scared. ",
        "Jack: He's a tough kid. ",
        "Carly: He pretends to be. I wish I could be \r\nwith him, you know, just to hold his hands so he knows he's not alone. What is \r\nthat? Why are you smiling at? ",
        "Jack: You really got a soft spot for him now, \r\nhuh? ",
        "Carly: He happens to be a great kid. You \r\nthink Keith will let us stay in his life? ",
        "Jack: Oh, I really hope so. ",
        "Carly: I hope so, too. ",
        "\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Keith: Thanks for hanging around while I was \r\nstitched up. I'm gonna be fine. ",
        "Lily: Oh, you can't rid of me that easily. \r\nHow are you feeling? ",
        "Keith: Like I was stabbed. But, you know, I'm \r\na tough guy. I'll live. How's J.J.? ",
        "Lily: Oh, last I heard, Ben was taking him \r\ndown for more tests to see if he could go home tonight. ",
        "Keith: That's great. ",
        "Lily: Yeah? ",
        "Keith: Yeah. Now that this ordeal's over, you \r\nknow, mission accomplished, it's time for me to get back to my life. ",
        "Lily: Meaning? ",
        "Keith: Well, take J.J. back to Chicago.\r\n",
        "Lucinda: What a capital idea. ",
        "\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "[Knock at the door] ",
        "Celia: Alison? It's me, Celia. Alison, is \r\neverything all right in there? Will? What are you doing in here? ",
        "[Henry sighs] ",
        "Henry: Come on. Quit blinking at me like \r\nthat. Okay, all right. Do your worst. ",
        "Katie: Henry? Are you there? Please pick up. \r\n[Katie sighs] I guess you're not there or you're not picking up because I'm the \r\nlast person in the world you want to talk to right now. But, listen, I want you \r\nto know that I'm going to Vegas with Craig to keep him from stopping Mike and \r\nJennifer\u2019s wedding. I'll be home as soon as I can and I'll explain everything. \r\nI'm sorry, Henry. I'm really sorry. But I'll fix this. I promise. I know I can \r\nmake things right. I love you. ",
        "Henry: Oh. Hey. Well, I guess this is it. It \r\nwas fun while it lasted. Now, you take care of yourself, all right? I left \r\nplenty of food and water. It should tide you over until Katie gets back. Don't \r\ntake any wooden carrots, all right? ",
        "Margo: Hey. Where are you going? ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Craig: You two -- you two better get used to \r\nme. And get happy because I'm going to be in your lives for a long, long time.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: Oh, God. ",
        "Mike: No, no. Jen -- Jen, don't listen to \r\nCraig. Don't listen to Craig. All right, it doesn't matter what he says or does. \r\nI want to marry you. All right, I'll be this baby's dad, all of it. Nothing's \r\nchanged. ",
        "Jennifer: Yes, it has. He knows. ",
        "Mike: I don't care. The important things \r\nhaven't changed. I love you. I want to marry you. Come on, baby, let's do this \r\nright now. Let's get married. We are a couple of words away from being husband \r\nand wife. Think about what he did to your mother. All right, and Carly and \r\nRosanna. Be stronger than them. Take back your life. ",
        "Craig: Whoa, whoa, what are you talking \r\nabout? If this baby is my blood, I am a part of its life. Now, you can get \r\nmarried, you can move half-way around the globe. I don't care. But I will be \r\nthere. You cannot shake me off. ",
        "Mike: Okay, I wasn't talking to you, Craig. I \r\nwas talking to Jennifer. ",
        "Craig: I think you were talking to the mother \r\nof my unborn child. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Mr. Lovejoy: Folks, I'm sorry but I have a \r\npretty full schedule tonight. I need an answer. Should I proceed and pronounce \r\nyou man and wife? ",
        "Jennifer: I love you for doing this, mike. \r\nBut I'm sorry. I can't marry you. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Lily: Mother, what are you doing here? \n",
        "Lucinda: Well, dear, I heard what happened. \r\nChasing after psychopaths, almost getting killed, what are you thinking? \n",
        "Lily: Oh, I don't know. Trying to save a \r\nlittle boy's life, named J.J.? ",
        "Lucinda: Well, Mr. Morrisey, fine, if you \r\nwant to play superhero, that's just fine, because it's your life. But putting my \r\ndaughter in jeopardy? It's beyond me. ",
        "Lily: Nobody forced me to do anything. And \r\nthanks to Keith, Les is behind bars and I'm cleared of all murder charges.\r\n",
        "Lucinda: Oh, congratulations. Nevertheless, \r\nLily -- ",
        "Keith: You know, you're right. My job is done \r\nhere, so it's time for me to take J.J. back to Chicago. ",
        "Lily: This is not a good time for you to be \r\nleaving town. Because you have this horrible wound and J.J. has, at least, a \r\nconcussion. And besides the fact, you'll have to come back in a couple of days \r\nto testify at Les's trial because you're the one that found Julia\u2019s cell phone.\r\n",
        "Lucinda: What? ",
        "Lily: Yes. ",
        "Lucinda: A cell phone? ",
        "Lily: Yes, a cell phone. We searched Les's \r\nplace that he was staying at, the halfway house, when Julia died. And Keith \r\nfound Julia\u2019s cell phone behind a wall and it was covered in Julia\u2019s blood.\r\n",
        "Lucinda: Ooh. That's very incriminating.\r\n",
        "Lily: Yes. It's the most incriminating \r\nevidence that we have. So you, please, you need to stay. You need to stay here \r\nfor J.J., for Les -- [Lily sighs] for everyone. We need you here. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Will: Celia, you scared me. What are you \r\ndoing here? ",
        "Celia: I came here to see Alison. And when \r\nshe didn't answer and I heard glass breaking, I used my key. She and Aaron gave \r\nme one when I stayed with them. ",
        "Will: Right. ",
        "Celia: Where is Alison? ",
        "Will: She went to Seattle to see Aaron. She \r\njust took off a little while ago. ",
        "Celia: Great. But what are you doing in here?\r\n",
        "Will: Well, she asked me to get the mail for \r\nher while she was gone and I left my car keys here -- did you need to see her \r\nfor something important? ",
        "Celia: It doesn't matter. I'll deal with it \r\non my own. ",
        "Casey: I know you're mad at me, but we need \r\nto talk about what happened. Will? What's up, man? ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Margo: Well, I -- this is unbelievable.\r\n",
        "Henry: Every word of it's true. ",
        "Margo: Jennifer is carrying Craig\u2019s child?\r\n",
        "Henry: Yeah. If I saw pigs flying outside the \r\nwindow right now, I would not be the least bit surprised. ",
        "Margo: Huh. I had no idea that this was going \r\non. Well, that still doesn't your bags, though. ",
        "Henry: Well, when Craig is finished with Mike \r\nand Jennifer\u2019s relationship, mike will be a free man again. ",
        "Margo: Hmm, don't follow. ",
        "Henry: Free man. Free man, so there's nothing \r\nto keep Katie from being with the love of her life. ",
        "Margo: Oh, is that what you -- that's what \r\nyou think is going to happen? ",
        "Henry: Yeah. Look, she denies it, but I know \r\nthe truth, Margo. I do. I -- she swore not to tell Craig that the baby was his. \r\nShe knew how I felt about it. She knew the consequences to all of us if he found \r\nout. But she couldn't help herself. She did it anyway. ",
        "Margo: Well, let me ask you something. Do you \r\nlove Katie? ",
        "Henry: Truly, madly, deeply, and I also have \r\nmy pride, and I'm not going to wait here for my wife to show me the door. Okay? \r\nI'm not that big of a loser. ",
        "Margo: Well, Henry, I've got news for you. If \r\nyou walk out on Katie that is exactly what you will be. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Mike: We came here to get married because we \r\nlove each other. Don't let Craig change your mind. ",
        "Jennifer: We can't do this, Mike. I can't do \r\nthis to you. ",
        "Craig: That's smart, Jennifer. You should \r\nlisten. ",
        "Mike: And you know what? You should shut your \r\nmouth before I shut it for you. ",
        "Mr. Lovejoy: My wife and I will be in chapel \r\nof love number two, just down the hall, should you have a change of heart.\r\n",
        "Craig: I think that's wise now, Jennifer.\r\n",
        "Mike: If you don't want to dial 911, you'd \r\nbetter get your brother out of here, because I will throw him out. ",
        "Katie: Come on, Craig. ",
        "Craig: No, no, no. ",
        "Katie: Let's go! ",
        "Craig: I had to chase these two all the way \r\nto Vegas. I'm not going anywhere until I know we're all in some kind of \r\nagreement. ",
        "Mike: No. There's no kind of agreement here. \r\nOkay, you've done enough damage. ",
        "Jennifer: Mike, I don't feel well. \n",
        "Mike: You dizzy? ",
        "Jennifer: I need to sit down. ",
        "Craig: Right here, here's a chair. \n",
        "Mike: No, no, no. Okay, we don't need your \r\nhelp. Thank you. Baby, is there anything I can do? ",
        "Katie: Jennifer, I am so sorry. ",
        "Craig: What are you apologizing for? \n",
        "Jennifer: Craig, just leave us alone! \n",
        "Craig: Jennifer, look, I know you're scared. \r\nI know you want to escape from everything. I know you want me out of your life. \r\nYou can get married, I don't care. If the child is mine, I will fight for my \r\nchild. ",
        "Mike: You want a fight? You've got one.\r\n",
        "Katie: Come on, come on. Craig, let's go. \r\nJust leave them alone, please. ",
        "Craig: All right. Okay. We're done here for \r\nnow. ",
        "Mike: Hey, hey, it's going to be okay. All \r\nright? I promise I'll make everything okay. ",
        "Jennifer: Oh, Mike. You can't do that. No one \r\ncan. ",
        "Katie: Was that really necessary, Craig? \r\nTaunting them like that? ",
        "Craig: I wasn't taunting. ",
        "Katie: What would you call it? ",
        "Craig: That was telling the truth. You should \r\ntry it sometime. It's liberating. Oh, great! It's my day to do the dishes!\r\n",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Lucinda: Lily seems to think I was \r\ninsensitive earlier, Mr. Morrissey. If so, do forgive me. I'll try to keep my \r\nopinions to myself. Especially in light of the fact that my daughter rarely \r\nlistens to me anyway. ",
        "Lily: Okay. ",
        "Jack: Hey, hey! How're things going in here?\r\n",
        "Keith: Jack, thanks for asking. Everything's \r\nfine. How's J.J.? ",
        "Jack: Ben Harris gave him his walking papers.\r\n",
        "Keith: Good. ",
        "Lily: That's great. ",
        "Keith: That's terrific. ",
        "Jack: Listen, I was hoping Carly and I could \r\ntake him to Milltown while you're recuperating. ",
        "Keith: Um, I don't know, you know, I -- now \r\nthat Sweeney\u2019s behind bars, I think it's time to get back to Chicago, so -- I \r\nthink I'm going to leave first thing in the morning. ",
        "Jack: So soon? ",
        "Keith: This town is full of a lot of bad \r\nmemories. I think it's time for both of us to have a fresh start. ",
        "Carly: Somebody's been very worried about \r\nyou. ",
        "Keith: Hey, J.J. how you doing? ",
        "J.J.: Are you okay? ",
        "Keith: I'm going to be fine, yeah. \n",
        "J.J.: Well, did you get stitches? ",
        "Keith: I -- I do have some stitches. And as \r\nsoon as I get this bandage off, I'll show them to you. How's your noggin? \n",
        "J.J.: Well, I have a concussion! Carly said \r\nthat we can stay up all night, watch DVDs and play video games! ",
        "Carly: Yes, well, we both have to stay awake \r\ntonight. Doctor's orders. If that -- if it's okay with you, Keith? ",
        "Keith: I don't think that's going to fit into \r\nour plans. ",
        "J.J.: What plans? ",
        "Jack: Your uncle wants you both to wake up \r\nreally early and get back on the road to Chicago tomorrow morning. Listen, I'll \r\nbet he'll take you to the Pancake Palace, if you're really good. ",
        "Keith: Yeah. Come on, J.J., we'll get the \r\nlumberjack special and -- you can get anything you want. ",
        "J.J.: I don't want to go. I want to stay here \r\nwith Carly and Jack. ",
        "Carly: Yes. And we want you to stay here, \r\nsweetheart. Come on, Keith. Please. Please don't take him away. Not yet. \n",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Celia: Will doesn't have to explain anything.\r\n",
        "Will: Because there's nothing to explain.\r\n",
        "Celia: You're the one who needs to explain \r\nwhat you're doing here. Are you stalking me? ",
        "Casey: No. I just followed you here because I \r\nwanted -- ",
        "Celia: Isn't stalking and following someone \r\nthe same thing? ",
        "Will: Okay. I'm going to step outside for \r\nsome fresh air. ",
        "Casey: Why is he going on the fire escape?\r\n",
        "Celia: It isn't weirder than you stalking me.\r\n",
        "Casey: I am not. I just wanted to talk to \r\nyou. ",
        "Celia: Haven't you heard of the telephone?\r\n",
        "Casey: I've been trying to call you ever \r\nsince you ran out of my house. ",
        "Celia: I know. ",
        "Casey: If you knew, then why didn't you call \r\nme back? ",
        "Celia: I've been thinking a lot. ",
        "Casey: About us? ",
        "Celia: And I've been thinking -- you're a \r\npopular guy, you know? And popular guys have girls chasing them all the time. \r\nAnd you can hook up with as many as you want. So, if you're like this undercover \r\nplayer or something? You can scratch my name off your list. ",
        "Casey: Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. You've totally \r\ngot the wrong idea about me. ",
        "Celia: What was that condom for that popped \r\nout of your wallet? ",
        "Casey: I can explain the condom. ",
        "Celia: You don't have to. I know you're \r\nolder, and you're used to hanging out with older girls. But I'm -- I'm not ready \r\nfor all that. ",
        "Casey: That's what this is about? You think \r\nI'm trying to pressure you into having sex? ",
        "Celia: I don't know. Are you? ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Margo: All right, let me ask you something. \r\nWhen Mike found out about Craig and Jennifer, did he walk out on her? \n",
        "Henry: No. ",
        "Margo: No, no. He didn\u2019t. Because that's not \r\nthe kind of man he is. ",
        "Henry: Yeah, but Craig is -- ",
        "Margo: Craig, Craig -- forget about Craig. \r\nThis is about you and what you want and what makes you happy. And what makes you \r\nhappy is Katie. So if you want her, you've got to stay. ",
        "Henry: Wow. I wasn't expecting this. I \r\nthought you'd be the first person to shake my hand and say, \"better luck next \r\ntime.\" ",
        "Margo: Yeah. Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting \r\nit either. I wasn't expecting to be here, but here I am. Because you're good for \r\nKatie. I mean, you -- you have stuck with her through rich, poor, thick, thin, \r\nbad, to worse. It takes a strong man to do that. So if you dumped her now, it'd \r\nreally be kind of out of character. That'd make you a loser, wouldn't it? You're \r\nnot a loser. And Henry, Katie needs you. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Craig: Thank you very much. Here. Champagne \r\nto lift your spirits? Hmm? ",
        "Katie: What? ",
        "Craig: We should toast to a job well done.\r\n",
        "Katie: You expect me to celebrate? Craig, did \r\nyou see the look on Jennifer\u2019s face the entire time we were in that chapel? My \r\nGod, she was devastated. ",
        "Craig: She got caught! Good! At least she has \r\nher co-conspirator doormat to give her comfort. ",
        "Katie: Mike is not a doormat. Aah! The \r\nbiggest mistake of my entire life was telling you anything, anything at all! It \r\nis the last thing in the world that I meant to happen. ",
        "Craig: Now, Freud said, no accidents. So you \r\ncan drop the regretful act. ",
        "Katie: It's not an act! ",
        "Craig: You wanted me to know that baby was \r\nmine. You wanted me to break up the marriage in Vegas. You even got seats on the \r\nplane to fly out uninvited so you could sit front row. Okay? End of session. But \r\ndon't worry about it. They're not going to know it was thanks to you. Drink up.\r\n",
        "Katie: I am sick to my stomach. ",
        "Craig: It'll pass. Okay? Now, what would I \r\nhave done without my little sister here? Nothing like family. ",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Mike: Here, I found some ginger ale. Maybe \r\nit'll settle your stomach. ",
        "Jennifer: Thank you. ",
        "Mike: God, I wish I knew how he got here. You \r\nknow, Paul leaves a message says Craig\u2019s down to Mexico, I figure we were safe. \r\nYou know? How the heck he tracked us down here, out of all the wedding chapels \r\nin Vegas, I will never know. ",
        "Jennifer: He wanted to prove that we can run, \r\nbut we can't hide. ",
        "Mike: We'll get married and we'll go back to \r\nOakdale, and when the baby's born, my name will be on that birth certificate. \r\nAnd if Craig\u2019s still itching for a fight, he can bring it. ",
        "Jennifer: Maybe you're right. Maybe we should \r\ngo home. ",
        "Mike: Now you're talking. Let me get the \r\njustice of the peace, okay? ",
        "Jennifer: No, no, Mike, Mike -- I meant that \r\nI can't run away. But getting married would be a mistake. And I have made my \r\nshare in this lifetime. We have to end this. ",
        "Mike: Oh, come on, Jen. You don't -- \n",
        "Jennifer: No. I can't marry you, Mike. Not \r\nnow. And not ever. ",
        "\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" \r\n-- ",
        "Jennifer: I wouldn't wish Craig on my worst \r\nenemy, much less you. ",
        "Mike: All the threats in the world wouldn't \r\nmake me give up on you. It's out of the question. ",
        "Lily: I'd started thinking of you as a hero.\r\n",
        "Keith: Well, now what? ",
        "Lily: And now, unfortunately for your nephew, \r\nyou don't know how to think about anybody but yourself. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------",
        "Mike: Jen, don't surrender to this loser.\r\n",
        "Jennifer: No, I'm not giving in. And I'm not \r\ngiving up. ",
        "Mike: Then why are you pushing me away?\r\n",
        "Jennifer: Because it's my fight! ",
        "Mike: You let me take care of Craig. I've \r\nhandled him many times. ",
        "Jennifer: Craig came in here with a \r\nfull-fledged declaration of war! You heard him. It's -- it's his baby. And he \r\nwill not leave us alone until he gets what he wants. ",
        "Mike: Okay, but if the two of us work \r\ntogether we can -- ",
        "Jennifer: No! I -- I can't let you be part of \r\nthis. It's not fair! ",
        "Mike: No, okay. None of it's fair. \n",
        "Jennifer: Craig will make it unbearable. And \r\none day you will look at me and you'll hate me for getting you involved in this \r\nnightmare. ",
        "Mike: Never. Never. Jen, I love you. All \r\nright? This baby is just as much yours as it is his. And when we get married --\r\n",
        "Jennifer: We can't! ",
        "Mike: I will cherish and protect and love \r\nyou, because you deserve to be happy. Please. All you have to do is say the \r\nword, and just make it official. ",
        "Jennifer: Paul told me that if I keep this \r\nbaby, it would be caught in the crossfire between my family and Craig. And I \r\nlove you too much to let you be part of that. Okay? So you just -- you have to \r\nwalk away, Mike. You have to while you -- while you still love me. And while \r\nwe're still friends, while you still think the best of me, okay? We can end this \r\non a good note. You have to walk away, Mike, and get out while you still can.\r\n",
        "\r\n-------------------------------------------------------",
