        "Henry becomes surprisingly turned on by Vienna, as she tries on maternity clothes. A psychic's comments make Katie wonder about the baby, as well as her comment about Brad not being the baby's father. Katie asks her to meet Vienna and Henry, who are none to pleased with the psychic's comments hitting too close to home. Katie obsesses with what is going on and what might be wrong with the baby. The psychic does a reading, which is dead on with what Henry and Vienna are going through unbeknownst to Brad and Katie so much that Henry and Vienna make excuses and make a bee line for the door. Later, when Katie can't let this bad feeling about the baby go, Brad suggests that they could have Vienna tested for any genetic problems. Meanwhile, the psychic makes comments that are more telling when she sees Vienna and Henry alone later. Her comments cause Henry to think they should tell the truth. Katie and Brad ask Vienna to have genetic testing done and she doesn't want to, but Henry thinks it is a good idea so Vienna is forced to go along with this. Henry thinks it will be easier on Brad and Katie to learn the baby is his if it comes from a doctor and that way they won't think they have been lying to them for weeks. Vienna is very unsure and thinks the news will devastate Brad and Katie. Lily and Holden continue to argue about her defending Damian, as she doesn't care right now if he is involved; she just wants Luke and Noah home. Lily receives instructions about where to leave the money, as she doesn't tell Holden but instead goes to see Damian. Damian asks Lily for help to get out of jail so he can help find Luke. Holden finds Lily with Damian and is furious. Lily later goes to look at security footage of the hall outside Damian's room to see if someone broke into his room to use his stationary in order to set him up. Lily shows Margo evidence that someone let themselves into Damian's room and Margo lets Damian go. Damian promises to find Luke, as Lily heads back home to face Holden again. They finally reconcile, as Holden just doesn't want Lily to keep any more secrets from him. Lily uses this opportunity to tell him about the note. Holden agrees to let her use Damian as a resource after that. Holden and Lily agree to have him go show Margo the note too in case she has any thoughts. Lisa shows Damian some newspaper clippings about a murder connected to the The Grimaldi fortune; Damian notices the Pisces necklace and now knows there is a connection. He rushes over to tell Lily, who wants to include Holden in this information, but Damian tells her that Holden will not let them do what needs to be done in order to catch these people. Lily explains that she made a promise and doesn't want to go back on it. Damian tells her that she has the night to figure out which is more important her promise to Holden or their son's life."

        "Katie: Welcome to \"Author's Corner\" with psychic Myra Haft. Now, this is interesting. I didn't realize that psychics had specialties. Some are into ghosts, and some are all about past lives.",
        "Myra: Some of the brave ones even take on the stock market. [Laughs]",
        "Katie: And what is your specialty?",
        "Myra: Babies.",
        "Katie: Oh. That's fascinating. Newborns, toddlers?",
        "Myra: Yet to be born babies. I can sense when a couple's expecting, the sex of the baby, and whether they're reincarnated spirits.",
        "Katie: Oh, okay. Well, in that case, do you see anything about me?",
        "Myra: I -- I'm not getting anything. Are -- are you expecting?",
        "Katie: I am, but through a surrogate.",
        "Myra: Oh. My gift only works with biological parents. But congratulations. I wish you tremendous luck.",
        "Katie: I will take it. To read an excerpt from Myra's wonderful book, please visit our website. And remember, it's earth day. Take care of your planet. We'll be right back.",
        "Brad: And we're out.",
        "Katie: Hey, that's the stage manager's job!",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Brad: I know. I have always wanted to say that. And by the way, the director says that you are good to go.",
        "Katie: Okay. Oh, Myra, this is Brad, my baby's daddy.",
        "Brad: Hello.",
        "Myra: You're not gonna trip me up on that one again. He's not the biological father. Right?",
        "Brad: Yeah. Actually, I am.",
        "Myra: You're kidding?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Look at the colors for summer.",
        "Lisa: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Aren't they beautiful, Honey?",
        "Henry: Sure they are. Well, I'm gonna head over to Metro, get some --",
        "Vienna: No, no, no! You can't leave! No. I need your expert opinion.",
        "Henry: Ah -- baby decisions are not my territory. That's for you, Brad, and Katie.",
        "Vienna: Oh, come on. Just one outfit, please? Please.",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Lisa: Henry, my dear, you are a very noble young man to allow your beloved to carry a baby for someone else.",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, you're telling me. I went from hot and sexy to \u0096",
        "[Groans]",
        "Lisa: Oh, come on! Be brave.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Henry: Hmm.",
        "Vienna: So -- what do you think?",
        "Henry: Well, that's -- wow. I never thought I'd say this, but, um --",
        "Vienna: What, you hate it?",
        "Henry: Hate it? No, I -- I love it. You never looked more beautiful in your life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You didn't get a sense that Brad's the father? Why not?",
        "Brad: Because this psychic stuff, no offense -- I mean, it's kind of a crock.",
        "Katie: Brad, don't be rude.",
        "Brad: Vienna's pregnant with my baby. We have the doctor bills to prove it. Who needs a psychic?",
        "Katie: Why do you think you didn't get any \"Daddy\" signals from Brad?",
        "Myra: I don't know. You know, clairvoyance isn't foolproof. Sometimes I do get it wrong.",
        "Brad: What did I tell you?",
        "Myra: But if you'll read my book, you'll see I'm often right.",
        "Brad: I'm sure you are. It's nice meeting you. Ready to go?",
        "Katie: I did read the book, and our research here on Myra's success rate is off the charts. I'm sorry. I don't mean to grill you, but I just want to make sure everything's okay. Do you think there's something wrong with the baby? Is that why you're not sensing anything?",
        "Brad: Katie, come on.",
        "Myra: No, no, no, no. I'm sure the baby's just fine. It's probably something as simple as the fact that I'm seeing Brad out of context, with you instead of the woman who's carrying the child.",
        "Katie: So you're just getting mixed signals?",
        "Myra: Perhaps. You know, if Brad and the mother were standing here together, I'd get a better reading.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, in that case, let's -- let us take you out for a drink.",
        "Brad: Why?",
        "Katie: So Myra can meet Vienna, and you can tell us what you see. Please.",
        "Myra: Well, I certainly owe you a favor for agreeing to stay late when my plane was delayed.",
        "Katie: So you'll do it?",
        "Myra: I would be delighted.",
        "Katie: Oh, thank you so much. Let's go.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Brad: Oh, boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You heard what Margo said. You cannot pay the ransom.",
        "Lily: If we want to get Luke and Noah back, we have to give the kidnappers what they want!",
        "Holden: Or it's the surest way to get them killed. Listen, we need to let the police handle this. Maybe Margo can get something more out of Damian.",
        "Lily: Why do you keep harping on Damian?",
        "Holden: Just because Damian was in custody when Luke was taken doesn't mean he's innocent. He has people out there helping him.",
        "Lily: I don't care! If we give them the money, who cares who did what? Luke and Noah will be home!",
        "Holden: You want to give them the money? Fine. Who are you gonna give it to? Damian? That's the first name that popped into your head, isn't it?",
        "Lily: Just because you keep talking about him.",
        "Holden: What are you doing?",
        "Lily: I'm gonna look at this last note. Maybe there's a clue as to who they are or where I can give them the money. There's nothing. There's nothing.",
        "Holden: Lily --",
        "Lily: Why don't they just tell me where I can meet them and give them the money? I want my son back! God, Holden, I want my son back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So you can't tell me where Luke or Noah are, you can't tell me which rival faction of your family may have taken them, but you want me to let you go, and then you're going to lead me directly to the guilty party?",
        "Damien: I'm not saying I can find them right away. But I have contacts, Margo. People will talk to me that won't talk to you.",
        "Margo: Grimaldi people?",
        "Damian: Yes. I can get messages to members of the family, and they will lead me to the right places.",
        "Margo: I'm sure that you know your family very well, Damian. But I know you, and I can't dismiss the possibility that you are the one behind this.",
        "Damian: How could I have kidnapped Luke when you kept me locked up in here?",
        "Margo: Because you said yourself you have connections! You have contacts! You easily could have arranged Luke's kidnapping from your jail cell.",
        "Damian: If I'm so powerful, what good is it going to do to keep me here?",
        "Margo: I'll sleep better.",
        "Damian: Margo, my son and his friend -- they mean nothing to these people. They will kill them unless I can stop them. You have to let me go.",
        "Margo: Until you're arraigned and bail is set, you're not going anywhere.",
        "Damian: But we can't wait that long, Margo!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I keep imagining that knock on the door and Margo standing there and telling us --",
        "Holden: They're alive.",
        "Lily: How do you know?",
        "Holden: Because no money has exchanged hands yet. They need to keep Luke and Noah alive in order to get the payoff.",
        "Lily: Where are you going?",
        "Holden: I'm gonna go see if I can find any of Luke's friends, see if they've seen him, heard anything.",
        "Lily: I'll go with you.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. You need to stay here in case the kidnappers call. If I find anything out, I'll call you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Ah!",
        "Henry: I can't keep my hands off of you. What's happening?",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Vienna: Lust.",
        "Lisa: No, don't be silly. Look where his hand is. No, if a man has lust on his mind, believe me, he would be groping other places.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Lisa: Yeah, so this is definitely love.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. That's got to be it. Yeah.",
        "Lisa: Well, obviously, the outfit is -- it's a winner. So would you like -- how about another?",
        "Vienna: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Lisa: Okay, okay, good.",
        "Vienna: Another.",
        "Lisa: Yes, all right.",
        "Vienna: Come with me?",
        "Henry: Uh, yeah. Can I?",
        "Lisa: Sure. Why not?",
        "Henry: Drop it!",
        "Vienna: Oh!",
        "Henry: You're so sexy pregnant! I'm so turned on!",
        "Vienna: Me too! You're wonderful!",
        "Lisa: Uh, how's it going in there? You need another size?",
        "Vienna: No, no, the size is perfect.",
        "Henry: We're doing great!",
        "Vienna: Oh!",
        "Lisa: Carry on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: This is where Vienna works. She's our surrogate. She and her partner run this place, but I don't see them.",
        "Brad: Are Henry and Vienna in the back?",
        "Bartender: No, they're not here yet.",
        "Brad: Well, Henry said they were working here tonight.",
        "Bartender: I guess they got hung up.",
        "Brad: Ah! Well, you know, we tried. I guess we'll have to make a psychic connection some other time.",
        "Katie: Well, you don't have to rush off, do you?",
        "Brad: Well, Katie, she -- she's on a book tour. You got to be tired, right?",
        "Katie: You can stay a little longer, Myra.",
        "Myra: If it's important to you.",
        "Brad: We don't know when they're gonna show up.",
        "Katie: You'll know when you call them. Come on. Let's get you a drink. It doesn't affect your psychic powers, does it?",
        "Myra: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Vienna moaning]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Vienna: The phone's ringing. Answer before Lisa comes back to see what's going on.",
        "Henry: Yeah?",
        "Brad: Where are you guys?",
        "Henry: We're in the middle of something really important here.",
        "Brad: You said you were gonna be at Metro tonight.",
        "Henry: Yeah, we are. We're coming as soon as we can.",
        "Vienna: Mm!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Is there any news, Lily?",
        "Lily: Not yet. May I speak to Damian alone?",
        "Margo: I'll be right outside.",
        "Damian: What's happened? Why are you here?",
        "Lily: I need to discuss something with you.",
        "Damian: What is it?",
        "Lily: I've decided to pay the ransom.",
        "Damian: Have you heard from the kidnappers again? Did they give you an amount?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Damian: Did they tell you where to deliver the money?",
        "Lily: Not yet, but I want to be ready. Margo thinks I should wait, but I can't. I have to know in my heart that I'm doing everything I can to get Luke and Noah out of there as quickly as possible. Problem is Holden.",
        "Damian: Holden agrees with Margo?",
        "Lily: He thinks giving the money is giving up our leverage. But if it's the only way we can save Luke --",
        "Damian: Holden's right.",
        "Lily: You think I should stand by and let some kidnapper do God knows what to our son?",
        "Damian: Lily, these people want money and no chance of prosecution. It doesn't matter if they collect the ransom. They won't want to leave any witnesses behind.",
        "Lily: What should we do?",
        "Damian: I've got to find out who got them.",
        "Lily: Well, what do you need? How can I help you?",
        "Damian: I need my freedom. Talk to Margo. Convince her.",
        "Lily: Damian, the first ransom note was written on your stationary. There's no way Margo's gonna let you go.",
        "Damian: We have to find a way, Lily.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Lily: If there was anything I could do to help --",
        "Damian: Perhaps there is something.",
        "Margo: I thought you went back home.",
        "Holden: Waiting around was getting to me, so I decided to go and talk of Luke's friends to see if they knew anything about where he was headed before he disappeared.",
        "Margo: Any luck?",
        "Holden: I'm back to Damian. Is he still a prime suspect?",
        "Margo: He's all I've got. Of course, Lily doesn't think so.",
        "Holden: Did she call you?",
        "Margo: No. She's in here talking to him now.",
        "Holden: What the hell are you doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Henry, my dear, are you all right? You seem a little warm.",
        "Henry: Everything's great, Lisa. Thanks.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Lisa: There she comes. Both of you look a little overheated. Oh, Dear, maybe I should go and then kind of turn down the heat, huh?",
        "Vienna: No, no. No, don't -- don't do a thing. We adore your dressing room.",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Lisa: That's good. Oops!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Lisa: Yes, well, do come again.",
        "Henry: We will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: You're overreacting. Lily was just trying to help our son.",
        "Holden: Just stay out of this! You were supposed to stay at home and wait to hear from the kidnappers.",
        "Lily: I couldn't stand waiting any more than you could.",
        "Holden: I was out doing something productive, talking to Luke's friends, but you were here with Damian. Why?",
        "Margo: Perhaps the two of you should go home.",
        "Holden: Yeah, maybe we should. Call us if you hear anything.",
        "Margo: Of course I will. Um, I'm sorry. There's something both of you should remember.",
        "Lily: What's that?",
        "Margo: You didn't cause this, either of you. Try not to be so hard on each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Maybe you should call him again.",
        "Brad: Just relax. I'm sure they'll be here any minute, walking through that door.",
        "Myra: Think they just did.",
        "Katie: Hi!",
        "Myra: Well, I don't need to be a psychic to see that you're the surrogate mother. Yes, now I'm feeling it. You're the -- I'm so sorry. We haven't even been introduced.",
        "Katie: Oh, Myra, this is Vienna, and Henry is her partner.",
        "Vienna: In all ways.",
        "Myra: It's nice to meet you. I'm sorry. I really can't stay.",
        "Katie: What's wrong?",
        "Myra: I, um -- you know, a couple of sips of wine, and the jet lag just kicked in.",
        "Katie: Well, you were feeling fine before Henry and Vienna showed up. You sensed something, didn't you?",
        "Myra: Not necessarily.",
        "Henry: What's going on?",
        "Katie: Don't you have some sort of Hippocratic Oath against hit-and-run ESP?",
        "Myra: If I wasn't so tired --",
        "Katie: You can't feel something about our baby and then just run off before telling us what it is.",
        "Katie: Is there something wrong with the baby?",
        "Vienna: No, of course not. Why are you asking her that?",
        "Katie: Because she knows something that she's not telling us. What is it?",
        "Henry: Katie -- Katie, you're upsetting Vienna, all right?",
        "Vienna: No. Why would she know anything about the baby?",
        "Brad: She's a psychic.",
        "Katie: Don't say it like it's nothing. She specializes in predicting things about unborn babies.",
        "Myra: But I'm not a doctor, and if -- if Vienna is going to an O.B. regularly and she's been told all is well, then I'm sure it is.",
        "Katie: So you can't see anything?",
        "Myra: It's difficult.",
        "Katie: Well, we'll try another way.",
        "Henry: Why -- why are we trying this at all?",
        "Katie: I read in your book that if the auras aren't clear, you can do a tarot card reading.",
        "Myra: Cards can be useful.",
        "Katie: Well, let's do that then. Can you do a reading?",
        "Vienna: No, no. I don't want to.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Henry: Because it's -- it's a gimmick. It's a trick. Why waste our time?",
        "Katie: Because I don't feel like it's wasting time to find out things about the baby that I'm gonna raise and live with for the next 18 years.",
        "Brad: Or longer. And if it's a girl, I'm not gonna let her get married till she's at what, at least 30?",
        "Katie: Will you please just humor me? If you don't believe in it, then what's the harm?",
        "Henry: I -- I don't think it's a good idea. That's all.",
        "Brad: Okay, can we all just -- can we all just kind of please go along with this? I know my wife, when she's got a bug up her -- I mean -- I mean once Katie is concerned, you know, it's -- can we just help her to feel better, please? Let's play some cards.",
        "Henry: Sure.",
        "Katie: Okay. Here. Brad, come sit next to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You lied to me, Lily.",
        "Lily: I thought Damian might have some information that could help us. And some of what he said makes sense. If we could just help get him out of jail --",
        "Holden: Help him? Damian is where he belongs.",
        "Lily: Well, it is possible that someone else is responsible.",
        "Holden: Who, who?",
        "Lily: We're a wealthy family, Holden. That alone makes --",
        "Holden: They took Noah first. This is about punishing Luke. And that's exactly what your ex-husband does. I'm sorry I -- keep saying things like that. Maybe if we just don't talk about Damian at all --",
        "Lily: All right.",
        "Holden: You want some tea? I'll get us some tea.",
        "Lily: Tea would be nice.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Myra: Who wants to start?",
        "Vienna: Oh. She's beautiful.",
        "Henry: Yeah! That -- that's not a surprise at all. The cards represent us, right?",
        "Myra: Oh, you studied the tarot.",
        "Henry: I know about it. Doesn't mean I necessarily believe in it.",
        "Katie: What does Vienna's card mean?",
        "Myra: That's the empress card. She heralds conception, or the birth of a child.",
        "Katie: See? It works. Okay, me next.",
        "Myra: Ah, the lovers.",
        "Brad: Well, you don't have to explain that. I think we've pretty much got that covered.",
        "Myra: Well, it doesn't just stand for the love you two share. It stands for love in all its forms.",
        "Katie: Well, we already love the baby, and we love Henry and Vienna for helping us start a family.",
        "Vienna: Okay. Brad --",
        "[Vienna clears throat]",
        "Vienna: What did you get?",
        "Brad: Uh -- the king of cups. It's good to be the king.",
        "Myra: It's the sign of the seducer.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, you got that right.",
        "Myra: He has an air of innocence about him, but he thrives on the company of women.",
        "Brad: Well, that was the old me. I'm a one-woman king now.",
        "Henry: Okay. Uh, here goes nothing.",
        "Myra: The fool.",
        "Henry: Aha! Thank you, friends -- and lovers.",
        "Brad: Come on, Henry. When the card's right, you know they're right.",
        "Myra: It's actually -- it's not what you think. The fool actually stands for new beginnings. And he's almost always hiding something.",
