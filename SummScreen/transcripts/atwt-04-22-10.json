        "Holden: Hey there.",
        "Molly: Hey.",
        "Holden: You need any help making those sandwiches?",
        "Molly: [Laughs] I think I can handle it. I'm not so sure about the horseback riding, though.",
        "Holden: Oh, you'll be fine. You know, if you want to just have a little romantic picnic, the two of us, that would be okay, too.",
        "Molly: Oh, you're tempting. No, I think this will be really fun to do with Ethan and Faith. I like your kids, Holden.",
        "Holden: They like you, too. You know what I like?",
        "Molly: What? Oh, my God.",
        "[Laughing]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Holden: Getting a lot of calls today, aren't you?",
        "Molly: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I just hope it's not my producer with a last-minute job assignment. Could you go find us a picnic basket?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Holden: Be right back.",
        "Molly: Molly Conlan.",
        "Silas: I love the way you say that.",
        "Molly: Silas, stop calling me.",
        "Silas: You called me first.",
        "Molly: Yeah, well, I changed my mind, okay? I'm having second thoughts about the interview.",
        "Silas: I'm big news, Molly. You don't want me to go to the competition, do you?",
        "Molly: I don't need you anymore.",
        "Silas: Don't need me for what?",
        "Molly: It doesn't matter. Just don't call me anymore.",
        "Holden: Everything okay?",
        "Molly: Couldn't be better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Listen, while you finish coloring, I'm going to go upstairs and get ready for the party, and then I'll drive you over to Daddy's, okay?",
        "Ethan: Is Daddy ever going to live here again?",
        "Lily: No, Sweetie, I don't think so. He's happy where he is. But you are so lucky, 'cause you get to live in two places.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Luke, did you just get back?",
        "Luke: No. I'm still in Texas.",
        "Lily: What happened?",
        "Luke: We're still waiting for an answer about Dr. Oliver's status from the medical board.",
        "Lily: What's taking so long?",
        "Luke: I don't know. But I don't think I'm going to make it back in time for the awards ceremony for the foundation this afternoon.",
        "Lily: Oh Luke, I don't think I can handle that by myself. I -- I really don't know too much about your new projects. And what if they start asking me questions?",
        "Luke: I know. That's why I was thinking of somebody who could help you out.",
        "Lily: Well, I'm open to suggestion.",
        "Luke: Why don't you take Dad? He worked with me on these new proposals, so he'll know everything you need. Mom?",
        "Lily: Do you really think that's something that he'd want to do?",
        "Luke: Dad is really invested in the foundation, too. Just tell him to dust off his tuxedo and go with you. Call me later, okay?",
        "Lily: Will do. Don't worry about a thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: Sure you don't want to talk to Mommy some more?",
        "Luke: That was business.",
        "Reid: Only the pretentious do business in tuxedos, Mr. Snyder.",
        "Luke: Well, then, you must own several.",
        "Reid: Don't let me keep you from your appointed rounds. I mean, if there's flesh that you need to press, by all means go forth and fund-raise.",
        "Luke: You know what? I didn't think this was possible, but you are even crankier than usual. Lucky for you, I am giving you a free pass.",
        "Reid: Why?",
        "Luke: Because you've been waiting forever to find out if your medical license has been revoked. You deserve to be obnoxious.",
        "Reid: Oh, thank you so much for your permission.",
        "Luke: All right. That's it. We're getting out of here. What's there to do in this town?",
        "Reid: I don't know. What do you have in mind?",
        "Luke: Well, you lived here for years. What's there to do?",
        "Reid: I don't know.",
        "Luke: Well, don't you have some friends that we could call?",
        "Reid: All my friends actually work.",
        "Luke: Well, how about a favorite restaurant?",
        "Reid: I do takeout.",
        "Luke: Favorite bar? Club? Lounge? Ice-skating rink? Bowling alley?",
        "Reid: I went bowling once. I was 9 years old.",
        "Luke: [Laughs] No friends, no fun, no life. You, Dr. Oliver, are a sad, sad man.",
        "Reid: Why, thank you.",

        "[Henry groans]",
        "[Katie groans]",
        "Henry: What happened to you?",
        "Katie: I collided with a smoothie. How's Jacob?",
        "Henry: Who -- whose coat is that? That's not your coat.",
        "Katie: It belongs to Chris.",
        "Henry: He was up for a little while, and I -- I put him back to sleep.",
        "Katie: Oh. Is Vienna up in the bedroom with him?",
        "Katie: No, she left. What? [Gasps] No. I set it up perfectly for her to see you and Jacob together so you two could bond.",
        "Henry: We're engaged, Katie. How much more bonded could we really be?",
        "Katie: She's worried about you, Henry. That's why I left you two alone, so you would have the chance to show her she has no reason to have all these wedding jitters.",
        "Henry: She does, Katie. She has plenty of reasons.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh, and you might want to ease out on my waist.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Vienna: For the baby. By the time I walk down the aisle, I'm going to be pregnant with Henry's child. Shouldn't you write it down --?",
        "Barbara: Hmm?",
        "Vienna: My waist measurements?",
        "Barbara: Right.",
        "Vienna: You know, when I saw that vintage dress in the magazine, I just knew I had to have it. And my wedding day is going to be perfect, especially if I'm going to be carrying Henry's child.",
        "Barbara: So this is, uh -- a new development for you and Henry, deciding to have a baby?",
        "Vienna: Well, we haven't actually talked about it.",
        "Barbara: You haven't talked to Henry about this?",
        "Vienna: Well, Henry and I, we're madly in love. Why wouldn't he want to have a baby with me?",
        "Barbara: You know, Vienna, you and Henry seem to have so much fun together, and babies are very demanding. It will change things for you.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but I want to be a mom. And more than that, I want to have a baby with Henry.",
        "Barbara: Hmm.",
        "Vienna: You're wondering what I see in him.",
        "Barbara: Well, I have wondered what first attracted you to him.",
        "Vienna: Well, we got stuck in a limo together. And at first we were arguing, and then we were kissing, and then we were making passionate love. And then -- I just fell in love with him. I love him. I know Henry, he can be selfish and flaky, and -- and he seems to find himself wearing a dress quite often. But -- there's more to him.",
        "Barbara: And when did you know that he loved you?",
        "Vienna: Well, he showed it to me before he said it. Actually, he -- he doesn't even say it that often right now. But -- nobody has ever loved me like he has. Nobody's ever made me feel this special. You know what I mean?",
        "Barbara: Yes.",
        "Vienna: You know, when I was pregnant before, the idea of him being a father scared him. But then something changed, and he wanted a baby so much. Henry -- he will be a great father.",
        "Barbara: And a great husband.",
        "Vienna: Eventually, yes. There's been some distance between us. I mean, the way I left him and I stayed away for months, I think he's still getting over it. And I really don't know what happened to him when I was gone or how his life was without me.",
        "Barbara: And if you knew, would it matter?",
        "Vienna: Maybe. Maybe not. The past doesn't matter. So, do you need more measurements?",
        "Barbara: No, I -- I think we're done for the day.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Barbara. Thank you so much. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Every time you have the chance at something stable in your life, you start sabotaging yourself. You're just scared.",
        "Henry: Well, I think it's more than that.",
        "Katie: You've been having sex with Barbara Ryan. It's fried your brain.",
        "Henry: Barbara makes me feel good.",
        "Katie: Okay, let's nip this in the bud right now. She is the worst possible choice for you. She is the one woman who could do the most damage to your life.",
        "Henry: Barbara doesn't do any damage to me.",
        "Katie: Oh, snap out of it! Do you know what you have to lose if you don't commit yourself 100% to the right woman? You want a good, happy life with Vienna, don't you?",
        "Henry: Yeah. That's what I always wanted.",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Henry: Right. Right, you're right. I'm just -- I'm probably just, uh -- I'm just scared because we're going so fast. That's it.",
        "Katie: What's it?",
        "Henry: That's it, that's it. Uh, we need to slow down. If you want to help me, that's what you want to do, you've got to help me slow this thing down.",
        "Katie: No. If you're trying to get out of this engagement, I can't help you do that.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no! That's -- that's not it. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, okay? I'm not trying to bail. I swear I'm not trying to bail on this.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Henry: I'm just -- we got to put the brakes on this or I'm going to implode.",
        "Katie: All right, okay. Cool. That is a good compromise. I'm with you. I will do whatever I can. But in the meantime, get your act together. Forget about Barbara.",
        "Henry: Got it.",
        "Katie: Focus on Vienna.",
        "Henry: Will do.",
        "Katie: Keep telling yourself marriage is a good thing.",
        "Henry: Marriage is a good thing. Marriage is a good thing. Marriage is a good thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: How can you live in a place for years without stumbling upon one cool place to hang out or good restaurant?",
        "Reid: Not everybody's a loaded bank account with tons of free time. I was a little busy, actually, fixing people's brains. Although I have to admit, if the board rules against me, I'm going to have plenty of free time on my hands. And then won't that be fun? I could see the way those old buzzards were looking at me. They can't wait to really stick it to a young hotshot like me, teach me a lesson. Hey, Snyder --",
        "Luke: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you -- were you saying something?",
        "Reid: My life is over. I'll never work again. Blah, blah, blah.",
        "Luke: Do you have your wallet on you?",
        "Reid: My wallet?",
        "Luke: Yeah. We're going to need it. We're going out.",
        "Reid: Don't tell me. You found the nearest gay bar.",
        "Luke: Not exactly. Come on!",
        "Reid: You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Luke: Yippee ki yay. We went riding around rockin' to the sound.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, look who it is. You all ready for your picnic, Buddy?",
        "Molly: Wow. What's the occasion?",
        "Lily: I'm going to an awards ceremony for Luke's foundation.",
        "Holden: Oh, that's right. I forgot all about that.",
        "Lily: But there's a problem. Luke is stuck in Texas.",
        "Holden: You're kidding?",
        "Faith: So what's the big deal?",
        "Holden: Well, the big deal is there are a lot of contributors there, a lot of press. It's a chance for the foundation to make some money. So he wants you to handle this on your own?",
        "Lily: Actually, he was hoping that you would take his place.",
        "Holden: Um, well, if I had more notice. We -- we have plans.",
        "Lily: It's short notice. I understand completely. There'll be other events.",
        "Molly: You know what, Holden? If you feel like you need to be there, then you should go. It's for Luke. You know, I can watch Ethan, and we can go on a picnic some other time.",
        "Holden: Yeah. It is kind of a big deal for Luke. You know what? I'll change. I'll be right back.",
        "Lily: I'll get Ethan settled in the parlor. Come on, Buddy.",
        "Faith: You thought he was going to choose to go with us instead of her, didn't you?",
        "Molly: Wow. That really is a gorgeous dress.",
        "Lily: Thank you. And I'm sorry for ruining your plans.",
        "Molly: Don't worry about it. Holden and I -- we can go riding anytime. The horses are always there.",
        "Lily: [Chuckles] How are you doing, Sweetie?",
        "Faith: Well, I'm a little bummed. I really wanted to go on that picnic.",
        "Lily: Faith, I hope you know it wasn't my idea to ask your father to go. Luke is the one that --",
        "Faith: Maybe you should give Dad a beeper. That way you can page him whenever you need him and take him away from whatever it is he'd rather be doing.",
        "Molly: Faith --",
        "Faith: What? I'm just saying.",
        "Molly: Wow. You clean up good.",
        "Holden: Thanks. Can I have a minute with Molly?",
        "Lily: Oh, of course. Thanks again for watching Ethan.",
        "Molly: Anytime. [Laughs]",
        "Holden: I'm going to make this up to you. You know that, right?",
        "Molly: You better believe you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Reid: This isn't exactly my kind of place.",
        "Luke: Well, you don't exactly have a kind of place, because you never go out.",
        "Reid: Yeah, but still, I'm not really sure how welcome we are here.",
        "Luke: Would you relax? We're just going to get a couple drinks, listen to music, and hang out. It's not like we're going to be making out or anything.",
        "Reid: There's a brain trust. Why would anybody with a synapse in their head want to have their body swinging around like that?",
        "Luke: Because it's fun. You've heard of fun, right? There has to be some part of your brain that handles that.",
        "Reid: Yeah, see? That's -- a lot of people think that, that there's a single pleasure center of the brain when in actuality, there are several that can be activated by chemicals, electrodes, even rapidly moving images. What are you doing? You're not really going to do that? That's insane.",
        "Luke: Start it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Vienna.",
        "Vienna: Oh, hey, hi. [Sighs] Aw, look who's up from his nap.",
        "Katie: Are you okay? Henry said you left while he was sleeping.",
        "Vienna: You know, I am terrific. I just got back from Barbara.",
        "Katie: You went to see Barbara? Why?",
        "Vienna: Yes. I wanted to talk to her because she's the one thing standing in our way for a perfect wedding.",
        "Katie: How so?",
        "Vienna: 'Cause of what she told Henry, that she wouldn't want to design my dress.",
        "Katie: Oh. Oh, so when you talked to her, what did she say? Because I thought when she told Henry she wouldn't do it, that was the end of it.",
        "Vienna: No, I convinced her to change her mind.",
        "Katie: You did?",
        "Vienna: Mm-hmm. I told her she owed me for what has gone on between Henry and her before I left town.",
        "Katie: And she agreed?",
        "Vienna: Well, she knows that what she did with him was wrong, so she agreed to do me a special favor.",
        "Katie: That's nice.",
        "Vienna: So that's one more thing we can check off our to-do list for the wedding. So what's next?",
        "Katie: Setting a date and finding a location, I guess.",
        "Vienna: You know what? I think Henry and I, we should get married soon.",
        "Katie: Really? Why rush?",
        "Vienna: Why wait?",
        "Katie: Lots of reasons. Most of the best venues and photographers and bands book well over a year in advance, and if you want to do it right, you should take it slow.",
        "Vienna: Katie, why are you trying to slow us down?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh! Oh, somebody up there must really hate me.",
        "Henry: Tell me that sketch is for someone other than Vienna.",
        "Barbara: She came to see me. She can be very persuasive.",
        "Henry: Oy. Lord, don't I know it. What did you say to her?",
        "Barbara: I told her I would design her dress.",
        "Henry: You what? Barbara, why? I told you how difficult that would make things.",
        "Barbara: Do you have any idea how difficult this is for me? And you know why, too.",
        "Henry: Why, why?",
        "Barbara: Never mind.",
        "Man: Good afternoon. Pretty, isn't she?",
        "Henry: Beautiful.",
        "Barbara: Henry, Vienna wants you to get her pregnant.",
        "Henry: Wait a second, wait a second! No, no, no. You can't just drop a bomb like that and walk away!",
        "Barbara: I wasn't going to tell you. It's really none of my business.",
        "Henry: Why is she talking to you about babies?",
        "Barbara: We were taking measurements, and then all of a sudden, she said that she wanted to have your child.",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Barbara: She thinks it will solidify your relationship.",
        "Henry: [Breathing heavily] Marriage is a good thing. Marriage is a good thing. I keep telling myself marriage is a good thing, and it is a good thing. It's a great thing. But I just -- becoming a father -- I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.",
        "Barbara: Are you going to pass out?",
        "Henry: No, it's just everything's moving so fast right now, and now she wants to add a baby to the list? No, that's not gonna --",
        "Barbara: Wait a second. You were going to have a baby before, and you were happy about that. When she was pregnant before, didn't you want that baby?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes, yes, yes. And I was -- I was devastated when we lost Sven. I never thought I could mourn like that for someone I'd never met. But -- I mean, now that things -- things have changed, I just -- I mean, things have been a little crazy. My -- I found out my father's really crazy. Who wants Stenbeck DNA? I mean, look at all the crazy things I've done in the last few months.",
        "Barbara: Ah. By that you mean me.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. I wasn't talking about you. Not us.",
        "Barbara: Its okay, its okay, because we -- we were really crazy. Lovely, but crazy. And it's over, and that's okay. It's okay. And I know you didn't ask, but you'll be a wonderful father.",
        "Henry: Why?",
        "Barbara: Because you're loyal and spontaneous and loving. And James Stenbeck wasn't any of those things.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay, I'm trying to slow you down.",
        "Vienna: Why? You don't think we should get married?",
        "Katie: No, of course I do. I mean, you and Henry belong together.",
        "Vienna: So why should we wait?",
        "Katie: Because of last time.",
        "Vienna: I really don't want to think about last time.",
        "Katie: But it's important. Henry left you at the altar, and you ended up getting drunk on Emma's elderberry wine.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but Henry and I, we barely knew each other then.",
        "Katie: Which is why you were shocked that he walked out on you. But now you know how he reacts under pressure.",
        "Vienna: Which is why I'm not pressuring him. It will be different this time.",
        "Katie: I hope for your sake it will be.",
        "Vienna: I know it will be. He asked to marry me. He even gave me this beautiful ring.",
        "Katie: I know, Vienna. I know he wants to be with you. I know he wants to be married. That doesn't mean he won't manage to create some kind of crisis if he gets scared.",
        "Vienna: So you think that a longer engagement will help things?",
        "Katie: Don't you? It will just give Henry a chance to work out some of his issues.",
        "Vienna: Issues? What kind of issues?",
        "Katie: Oh, you know, just regular Henry being Henry kind of things. So you'll wait? I just really want things to work out for you two.",
        "Vienna: Thank you for your advice, Katie. You're really a good friend. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: And that's how it's done.",
        "Reid: Talk about a worthless skill.",
        "Luke: You couldn't do it.",
        "Reid: I wouldn't want to do that.",
        "Luke: Whatever makes you feel better.",
        "Reid: You think I'm scared of that?",
        "Luke: Those who can do. Those who won't --",
        "Reid: Okay, I'll have you know there are specific injuries associated with mechanical bull riding, including fractures of the second metacarpals, as well as the index-finger phalanges due to the extreme torque forces applied to the extremity during the severe gyrations.",
        "Luke: Yeah, it's a hand injury, and you're a surgeon. I get it.",
        "Reid: On the other hand, pun intended, a man's got to do what a man's got to do.",
        "Luke: Wait. Dr. Oliver, you don't have to do that.",
        "Reid: How hard can it be? You did it. You just get on and ride, right? [Reid laughs] That was fun. Let's do that again. Double or nothing I can beat your time, Mr. Snyder. What is it?",

        "Holden: Then why is he here? Why is he pursuing you?",
