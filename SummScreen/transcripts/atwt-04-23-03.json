        "Katie: He'll be back, Rosanna. I know how much it hurts. Ever since Simon left, I've barely been able to eat. At first, I couldn't even speak. All I wanted to do was just lay in bed and avoid all human contact. But that's the fast track to disaster. You need to eat, okay? You need to get up your strength, so that when Craig comes back, you can start your honeymoon with the man you were meant to be with. Now, what do you want me to get you?",
        "Rosanna: Craig.",
        "Katie: You know, I'll try to call him. When it comes to my brother, I am a master at the guilt trip.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. But really, the only person that can make any difference right now is Lucy, and frankly, I don't blame her for not wanting to talk to him. He's a stubborn, insufferable, impossible, stupid pig. He left me on my wedding night. After everything I've done for that man.",
        "Katie: He'll be back. He'll be back, Rosanna. I know it. [Doorbell rings] maybe that's him right now.",
        "Rosanna: No. He would use his key.",
        "Katie: No, this is Craig we're talking about. Maybe he's gonna make some dramatic entrance, you know? He has his hands filled with diamonds and champagne and roses. Oh, not you. Not today. Please, just take it somewhere else.",
        "Barbara: It'll just take a moment. Either bring me my designs or bring me Craig's head on a platter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hagwood: Detective? I think I've got what you're looking for.",
        "Jack: What's this?",
        "Hagwood: Charge card receipts. Now, there's only one jewelry store in the mall that sells the type of watch we're looking for. And that's everybody who's bought that model since January 1st, 2002.",
        "Jack: Gotta love a vendor with cutting-edge technology, huh?",
        "Hagwood: This is a printout of all the names. I made a notation next to one of them. Thought you should check it out.",
        "Jack: You talk to anybody else about this?",
        "Hagwood: No, you're the only one.",
        "Jack: Keep it that way.",
        "Hagwood: Done. What are you gonna do about it?",
        "Jack: First, I'll run this by the lieutenant. After that -- I haven't got a clue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Good morning.",
        "Emily: Morning.",
        "Hal: Good morning.",
        "Carly: Everything okay?",
        "Emily: Fine. Everything's just fine.",
        "Carly: Oh, good. Thank you. Well, thank you very much for letting me stay here until I find a new place.",
        "Hal: I was just telling Emily that Parker can stay here as long as he likes, and so can his mother. [Phone rings] hello? Yeah. All right, keep me posted. I'm on my way. Thanks.",
        "Emily: On your way where?",
        "Hal: To the station.",
        "Emily: It sounded important.",
        "Hal: It is.",
        "Emily: I'm needed at the station, too? Should I be worried?",
        "Hal: Not anymore. It's about Alison. I'll explain it to you on the way. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelsey: Is Malibu sleeping?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, we're clear.",
        "Kelsey: So, when do we stick it to Corrado?",
        "Nicole: After lunch. Everybody'll be outside and Corrado will be sucking coffee in the library. We'll do it there, sneak outside.",
        "Kelsey: They'll never know it was us.",
        "Regina: All right, ladies. Inspection time. Everybody out. Now. I said move it! Come on. Now. What's your problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I don't need to be examined, Dr. Dixon. I need to see my mother.",
        "Isaac: It's just a follow-up. You were in shock yesterday. You should be under a doctor's supervision.",
        "John: That's right. No shots, no needles, I'll take a look at you, you'll be out of here before you know it.",
        "Bonnie: How's my mom?",
        "John: She's sleeping.",
        "Bonnie: Sleeping?",
        "John: Yes, she's sleeping.",
        "Bonnie: Are you sure? Because if that's your way of telling me that she's in some sort of coma, I just -- I want to know.",
        "John: Listen to me. Listen to me now. Your mother is sleeping. She's got the best doctors in this hospital taking care of her, all right? Don't you worry. Your pulse is really racing. I'm gonna get you something to make you relax.",
        "Bonnie: No! No! No more sedatives. I am so sick and tired of everybody making decisions for me, it's enough!",
        "John: Bonnie, I'm going to write you a prescription. Whether you use it or not is up to you.",
        "Isaac: Why won't you let anybody help you?",
        "Bonnie: Because I can take care of myself.",
        "Isaac: If you could take care of yourself, you would have gotten yourself arrested last night, okay? The last thing your mother would want is for you to say or do something that would have you thrown in prison. Now, let us help you.",
        "Marshall: Dr. Dixon? How's Jessica?",
        "John: No major changes. Excuse me, I'm being paged.",
        "Marshall: Yeah, I know. I'm the one who paged you. Now, doc, please talk to me. I can't go in to see Jessica, but I can't leave. Not until I know that she's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Morning, sleepyhead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Craig isn't -- available, Barbara. What do you want?",
        "Barbara: I want my designs.",
        "Rosanna: Your designs? What designs?",
        "Barbara: The ones that were stolen. They don't belong to you, they belong to me. I want them back. Okay, fine. Just tell me where Craig is. I will deal with him directly.",
        "Katie: Craig's gone. Okay?",
        "Barbara: You are so helpful. Gone where?",
        "Rosanna: Katie, thank you so much for everything. I really appreciate it. But I can handle things from here, okay?",
        "Katie: Are you sure? 'Cause --",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Katie: -- We're sisters now, I've got your back.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. Would you please tell Lucy that I love her and just take her things and run them over to your house, okay?",
        "Katie: Okay. Call us.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: I tried to warn you. The man is pure poison. You poor, poor thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I need to be able to tell the police the whole story. I need to be able to tell them everything, because it is the only way this whole thing is just gonna be over with.",
        "Isaac: And that's the beginning of your prison term.",
        "Bonnie: You know, Isaac, maybe that's just exactly what needs to happen. You know, to balance the scales out a little bit.",
        "Isaac: Sweetie, this is not some divine test. Okay, God is not gonna take your mother from you if you don't tell the whole truth right this very minute. The last thing your mother would want is for you to do something that would land you in jail.",
        "Bonnie: Why are you all of a sudden telling me not to go to the police? Did somebody talk to you?",
        "Isaac: No, no, nobody talked to me about anything, okay? It's just common sense.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Have you seen Bonnie? 'Cause I went by Jess's place, she wasn't there.",
        "Marshall: Maybe she's with Isaac.",
        "Margo: No, I went there, too.",
        "Marshall: I'm not keeping tabs, detective. Why should you?",
        "Margo: 'Cause you are all gonna have to deal with this eventually.",
        "Marshall: But not now. All right, so tell Evelyn to back off and stop acting like everything's a federal case.",
        "Margo: Marshall, you know that Jessica is my best friend, and believe it or not, Evelyn is being incredibly patient about this whole thing. That's why I didn't question Bonnie last night before she left.",
        "Marshall: She was in shock, Margo.",
        "Margo: All right, well, unless you plan on coaching her to make that a permanent condition, she's gonna have to answer my questions sooner or later.",
        "Bonnie: I'm ready to answer any questions you have, Margo.",
        "Isaac: Very soon. But right now, we're waiting for her mother to wake up. And until then, your questions are gonna have to wait. Thanks, Margo.",
        "Margo: I must warn you -- I can't wait forever.",
        "Marshall: Bonnie, you're going to have to avoid answering any questions --",
        "Bonnie: I need to avoid you and all of your self-serving advice. In fact, why can't you just leave us alone? Just leave us alone!",
        "Marshall: You are three little words away from facing assault with a deadly weapon charges. All right, you tell Margo what she wants to know, and you're gonna go straight to prison. Oh, you don't want to hear it from me. Then tell her, Isaac, I'm trying to keep her from going to jail.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, don't do me any favors, okay?",
        "Marshall: If I hadn't already done you a favor, you'd already be facing felony charges. All right? I'm the reason you're walking around free. So if you want to keep being free, then I suggest you drop the attitude and the moral indignation and do what I'm telling you to do.",
        "Bonnie: Is that what you told my mother right before you raped her?",
        "Isaac: Bonnie! Be quiet and listen to the man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: I'm the one who was supposed to be watching you sleep.",
        "Jessica: Falling down on the job, eh? You had the sweetest smile on your face.",
        "Ben: Of course I did. I was dreaming about us.",
        "Jessica: Me, too.",
        "Ben: Thank God you're alive. Can you forgive me?",
        "Jessica: Forgive you for what?",
        "Ben: For making a mess of your trial and everything.",
        "Jessica: No, you didn't. I did.",
        "Ben: I kept disappointing you when you said you needed me most. You got good reason to be angry.",
        "Jessica: I can't be angry, I love you too much.",
        "Ben: So how're you feeling, physically? Discomfort? Pain?",
        "Jessica: Everywhere, I feel like I've been hit by a truck.",
        "Ben: I know, it sounded pretty touch and go when they brought you in last night.",
        "Jessica: Last night?",
        "Ben: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: Oh, my God, where's Bonnie?",
        "Ben: It's okay.",
        "Jessica: Where's Bonnie?",
        "Ben: It's okay. Bonnie went home with Isaac.",
        "Jessica: Was she questioned by the police, Ben? Please tell me she didn't say anything.",
        "Ben: Dixon treated her for shock and then he sent her home.",
        "Jessica: I need to -- I need to see her. It was an accident. It was an accident. She didn't mean for it to happen.",
        "Ben: I know. I know.",
        "Jessica: She loves me. She was just trying to protect me.",
        "Ben: Look, it's gonna be all right, Jessica. The police are gonna --",
        "Jessica: No, no, no, no. No police. No police, Ben. I need to see her. I need to see my little girl right now.",
        "Ben: You need to rest, okay? Relax.",
        "Jessica: No, I need to see her before she talks to somebody, before she says the wrong thing and ends up in jail. Please, Ben, help me. Please.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie didn't -- she didn't know what she was doing.",
        "Ben: She took a gun into Travers' room.",
        "Jessica: But it was for show, Ben. She didn't -- she wasn't gonna use it. It just went off. It was an accident. It went off. Bonnie loves me. She wouldn't try to hurt me.",
        "Ben: I know that.",
        "Jessica: Where is she? Where is she now? How is she?",
        "Ben: Look, she's a little shaky. She's gonna be fine. Bonnie will be fine.",
        "Jessica: I need to see her. I need to let her know I'm okay. She must be so scared. I need to tell her how to handle any questions.",
        "Ben: No, baby, baby, there's gonna be plenty of time to deal with the legal issues. Right now, you have to get your rest.",
        "Jessica: I can't rest, Ben. I need to see her. I need to -- talk to her. You have to find her and bring her to me. Please, Ben, I'm begging you.",
        "Ben: Okay, okay. Stay calm. And I'll go get Bonnie and bring her back here. We'll figure everything out, all right?",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Ben: All right.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marshall: Bonnie, listen. If we all tell the same story and stick to it, tell the cops the gun went off by accident, the D.A. can't prosecute.",
        "Bonnie: So you're saying we should lie.",
        "Marshall: It's not a lie. It's just the only way to protect you right now.",
        "Bonnie: Who gave you the right to protect me? I hope you're not expecting some sort of undying gratitude from my mother, because it's not gonna happen, Marshall. Because she doesn't want your help. And neither do I.",
        "Ben: Bonnie? Your mother wants to see you.",
        "Bonnie: She's awake?",
        "Ben: Yeah. One of the first things she did was ask for you.",
        "Bonnie: Are you sure she really wants to see me?",
        "Ben: Unless she has another daughter I don't know about.",
        "Bonnie: I can't. I can't. No, I'm not ready yet, Ben, no. Because -- she's in that bed because of me. How can I face her after what I just did?",
        "Ben: Look, look -- first, you kiss her good morning. Then you tell her how much you love her and the two of you, you work it out from there. Okay? All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelsey: Why'd she pick today for this?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Nicole: If you squealed, you are gonna be so damn sorry --",
        "Alison: I didn't say anything, I swear.",
        "Nicole: Smart girl.",
        "Alison: But they're about to look under my mattress --",
        "Kelsey: Shut up.",
        "Guard #1: All clear.",
        "Nicole: What were you looking for, Ms. Corrado? Maybe we can help you find it.",
        "Regina: Random inspection, Nicole. You know the drill. Get ready for work assignments, ladies. Alison, you'll be in the library today.",
        "Nicole: Are they gone?",
        "Kelsey: Finally. Is it in there?",
        "Nicole: Safe and sound. You're lucky they didn't find this knife, Malibu.",
        "Kelsey: You can have some major time added to your sentence if they find out you've been hiding a weapon.",
        "Nicole: You don't want that to happen.",
        "Kelsey: Oh, by the way, congrats on your new job.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, the library, huh? Pretty sweet. Corrado takes her lunch breaks in there.",
        "Kelsey: Maybe hanging out around all those books will smarten both of them up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I cannot believe you didn't tell me about Alison and these animals she's locked up with.",
        "Hal: Emily, let's just wait for the phone call, okay?",
        "Hagwood: Lieutenant?",
        "Hal: Yeah?",
        "Hagwood: Call from women's detention.",
        "Hal: Hal Munson.",
        "Regina: Hal, Regina Corrado.",
        "Hal: Did you find the knife?",
        "Regina: Nothing.",
        "Hal: Well, what about having her moved into another room?",
        "Regina: I don't know, Hal. I'll see what I can do, but I think it's only gonna make things worse for Alison.",
        "Hal: Do what you can, okay? Thanks, Regina. Well, I thought we would have better news. They searched the room. No knife turned up. But they are considering moving her into a different room.",
        "Emily: A different room? What is the point? She needs to be moved out of that zoo, period. Hal, she's there to be punished, not killed by her roommates.",
        "Hal: Emily, I had them search the room. Nothing turned up -- no contraband, no weapons, nothing. Now, she's going to be there for a year. If we keep running down there every time there's a problem, we could wind up doing more harm than good to her.",
        "Emily: Have you called Tom?",
        "Hal: No, not yet.",
        "Emily: You know what? I'm not gonna sit back and wait for something else to happen to Alison.",
        "Chris: You're calling Tom?",
        "Emily: Yes, I'm calling Tom, then my mother, then the warden, then the governor if I have to. I'm getting her moved out of that room today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: What are you doing here?",
        "Jack: Just looking for Hal.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, good luck. I came downstairs and Hal and Emily had both disappeared. I was just about to make myself something to eat. Would you like something? Maybe some waffles, some fruit, some scrambled eggs? The baby is having all sorts of cravings this morning.",
        "Jack: No, thanks, I'm good. Look, how long are you planning on hanging out here?",
        "Carly: Well, I don't know. They said that I could stay here as long as I like.",
        "Jack: The offer to move back into Milltown, that's an open invitation.",
        "Carly: Thanks, Jack. I think I'd better stick to the plan. I'm working with a realtor, and she's supposed to perform miracles.",
        "Jack: Well, can she work one for you today?",
        "Carly: What? Why? What is the big rush?",
        "Jack: There's new evidence in Barbara's kidnapping. It involves Emily.",
        "[Glass breaking]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: When I speak with Craig, I will let him know that you're looking for him.",
        "Barbara: You will probably speak to him next when you're around the negotiating table in your attorney's office.",
        "Rosanna: You know, it's a shame that whoever abducted you allowed you to escape.",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't tell me you're still holding out hope for this marriage? It's over, Rosanna. It was over before it ever started. I tried to tell you, but you ignored me.",
        "Rosanna: What do you want, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Nothing. I want to help you.",
        "Rosanna: You want to help me? You want to help me how?",
        "Barbara: If we work together, we can put Craig Montgomery behind bars once and for all.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, it seems by some strange coincidence, we've married the same man and lived in the same house, but I am not you, Barbara. And Fairwinds is not the same place.",
        "Barbara: And Craig Montgomery is not the same man?",
        "Rosanna: He loves me.",
        "Barbara: Well, perhaps. But he pretended to love me, too. And then he got his hooks into B.R.O. So he could have a toy to give to Carly Tenney. Sound familiar?",
        "Rosanna: Craig didn't ask for Monte Carlo. I gave it to him as a gift.",
        "Barbara: You played right into his hands. You see, he didn't want it for himself. All along, he just wanted to be able to hand it over to his grand obsession. It's all he ever wants, you know -- to give everything he can to Carly Tenney. There's nothing that he wouldn't do for her.",
        "Rosanna: He loves me.",
        "Barbara: That may be. But then he realized what you could give him. So he has used you to make her jealous, to get her attention. And he is still using you to make all of her dreams come true.",
        "Rosanna: You know, you really should get some help, Barbara. I hear there are wonderful advances in antipsychotic medication.",
        "Barbara: The next time, it won't be me being held prisoner in the woods. No, the next time, it will be you finding out how far Craig Montgomery is willing to go for Carly Tenney.",
        "Rosanna: There won't be a next time, dear.",
        "Barbara: Oh, good! That's good. You be smarter than I was. You do what I couldn't do. You find the evidence, because it's here. It's here in this house, or it's at Monte Carlo. The proof -- the proof that Craig Montgomery is a liar and a cheat, and that this is just the beginning of the end.",
        "Rosanna: I'd like you to get out. Get out and stay out of my house.",
        "Barbara: I wish you all the best, my friend. I mean that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Tom's still in court. Mom's checked out of her hotel room in Orlando. I don't know what we're supposed to do. We've got to get Alison out of there.",
        "Hal: Emily, we don't even know Alison is in danger.",
        "Chris: I know you think Alison's crying wolf again, but from what I've seen, Alison doesn't scare easily, and the girl is terrified.",
        "Emily: You know what? I have to do something. I have to go down there. I've got to get Alison moved. I don't care who I have to talk to or what I have to do. I have to do something, Hal. Doesn't anybody owe you any favors? The warden, somebody?",
        "Hal: All right, all right. I'll make a call. I'll let 'em know you're on your way.",
        "Emily: Okay, good, thank you.",
        "Chris: You want some company?",

        "Kelsey: I think we got company.",

        "Bonnie: I -- I think it's just gonna be really hard to see her like this.",
        "Ben: I'll make sure that Jessica's awake.",
        "Isaac: You know, your mother loves you very much, Bonnie. And what happened in that hotel room was an accident. You remember what Travers said about everyone sticking to the same story.",
        "Bonnie: I think my mother has taught me my whole life to tell the truth -- no matter what the consequences are. She went in that courtroom and she told the truth. And so did Ben. And despite the consequences, who am I to do anything less?",
        "Isaac: Just talk to Jessica, okay? She'll know what to do.",

        "Bonnie: Yeah, but -- look what I've done to you, what I did to you --",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, sweetheart, you had no intention of hurting me. I know that.",
        "Bonnie: Never. Never. That's what I'm gonna tell Margo. You know, I'm gonna -- I'm gonna tell the police everything.",
        "Jessica: Sweetie, that's why I wanted to see you now. We need to talk about what we're going to say to the police.",
        "Bonnie: I know what I'm gonna say, mom. I'm gonna tell them the truth. I'm gonna tell them the truth, no matter what Isaac or Marshall says.",
        "Jessica: Marshall spoke to you about this?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah. Yeah. He said that no one should say anything, that we should all just claim it was an accident. That no one saw what happened or how. That was the only way -- no one would be arrested.",
        "Ben: I'm gonna go grab a cup of coffee. I'll be back.",
        "Jessica: Okay, thanks. I want you to listen, Bonnie -- Marshall has a point. Now, if we stick to the same story, if we -- if we all say that we don't know how the gun got there, that the gun just went off, then you can't be charged.",
        "Bonnie: Are you saying that I should lie? To the police? Mom?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kelsey: Here, let me help you, Alison. Make sure you pack everything up, Malibu. We wouldn't want you accusing us of stealing or anything. This one's a real drama queen, let me tell you.",
        "Regina: All set to go, Alison?",
        "Nicole: Don't forget this.",
        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Nicole: It's been real -- unforgettable.",
        "Kelsey: Oh, but don't worry. We'll see you around.",
        "Nicole: It'll be like you never left. It's now or never. Before Malibu squeals.",
        "Kelsey: I'm ready when you are.",

        "Jack: Sure you're okay? You look jumpy this morning.",
        "Carly: Okay, Jack, let's just say for the sake of argument, that Emily did mastermind this silly little scheme to stash Barbara in a cabin for a few days. Isn't a part of you just a little bit happy that that woman got a piece of what she deserves?",
        "Jack: They don't pay me to think about that, Carly. They pay me to think about the law.",
        "Carly: Well, then maybe there was a -- a higher law at work here, Jack. Nobody did experiments on her face, did they? Nobody buried her alive. No one tortured her, did they? If you think about it, Barbara got off pretty easy.",
        "Jack: Well, yeah, but that's not the point --",
        "Carly: And what about Hal? He just got his little boy back. You want to break that up? You want to break up that happy home? For what, for Barbara? If I were you, before I did anything official, I would talk to Hal. I would call him.",
        "Jack: Fine.",
        "Carly: Right. You're gonna call him right this instant?",
        "Jack: Hey, this is Snyder. Munson around? Look, when he's free, can you tell him to meet me at the Lakeview? While you're at it, could you get the paperwork started on a search warrant? No. Fairwinds. Craig Montgomery's place. Thanks.",
        "Carly: What? You're gonna search Craig's place the day after he gets married?",
        "Jack: The sooner I nail Montgomery and end this entire investigation, the sooner we can all go back to being happy.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Carly: Leave, leave, leave. [Car engine starts] don't be such a slowpoke. Leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: If you're saying I should take advice from Marshall Travers on anything, then I'm absolutely sure you're not my mother.",
        "Jessica: Bonnie --",
        "Bonnie: Look, mom -- we'll talk about it later. Okay? When you're a little less weak and without sedatives.",
        "Jessica: I know what I'm saying. Do not talk to Margo. Tell her that I said you should wait until I'm stronger. Promise me you'll do that. Bonnie, promise me.",
        "Bonnie: Of course. Of course I promise.",
        "Jessica: Okay.",
        "Bonnie: As long as you make me a promise. You promise me to get some rest. I prayed all night. I prayed all night that you would be okay. I'm gonna give thanks for the rest of my life that those prayers were answered.",

        "Bonnie: You know what, Lisa? Right now she's -- I think she's gonna get some rest. But in a few hours, I'm sure.",
        "Lisa: That's wonderful. Then I'm going to go home and get some rest myself. I'll be back later.",
        "Bonnie: You're wonderful.",
        "Lisa: Honey.",
        "Bonnie: You're really great. Thank you.",
        "Margo: Well, it's good to hear that Jessica's on the mend. This has been pretty scary, hasn't it? Everyone's been so concerned about your mother, no one's been able to take care of you. How are you holding up?",
        "Bonnie: Better.",
        "Margo: Good. So do you think you and I could get a chance to talk a little while later?",
        "Bonnie: Margo, I'm telling you this because my mom asked me to. She wants me to wait. She doesn't want me to talk to you until she's stronger.",

        "John: What's bothering you, Marshall?",
        "Marshall: I am what Jessica says I am. I did what she said I did, except I realized it too late, you know? But I never meant to, John. I mean, I never intended to --",
