        "Allison tries to buy drugs from someone she used to know of in High School, but Paul interrupts her. Casey learns that the judge has made a decision. Maddie goes to talk with Will and Gwen because she is upset that Casey is going through with the sentencing without her; Will suggests they just show up at the police station. Jade continues to work with Cleo so she can impersonate Gwen; Luke shows up at the motel wondering what Jade is doing there? She covers and pretends she just wanted to give him space after their fight. Maddie, Will and Gwen show their support for Casey, as he is about to go to court. Paul is affected by some words out of Allison's mouth. Jade goes to meet Luke to talk about his mom, but she becomes distracted soon when she sees Cleo downtown after having informed her to stay at the motel. Maddie can't wait for Casey's call and tells Will and Gwen that she is going to wait at his house because he has to come home to her. Jade is horrified when Cleo slips away and pretends to be Gwen when she talks with Elwood. She bluffs her way out of a situation when Elwood asks her about a book for school. Elwood buys her as Gwen. Allison sees Will and Gwen, but is short with them when she sees the guy she is trying to buy the drugs from close by. Paul stops her again; he needs her to simply say five words to him. Hearing her say these words has an obvious impact on him. Cleo is thrilled with her success with Elwood, but Jade thinks she just got lucky; someone who really knows Gwen well might have come along and blown her out of the water. Maddie is at Tom and Margo's when they come home \u0096 with Casey in tow. This thrills Maddie until she hears that he didn't get off; he will be going to jail for six months, and he has to leave in the next day or so. Maddie is devastated. Margo and Tom struggle to come to grips with their son going to jail. Margo wonders if there was something they could have done differently that would have led them to a different outcome. Allison is unsuccessful again in procuring drugs since she has no money on her. Elwood is confused when he sees Gwen with a different book. He thinks they are playing games with him. Will and Gwen are confused by his words. Jade and Cleo almost run smack dab into Will, Gwen and Elwood."

        "Alison: Aren't you Jesse?",
        "Jesse: For you? Yeah, I'll be Jesse. Or Harry or whoever you want. And you would be?",
        "Alison: Alison.",
        "Jesse: Hello, Alison.",
        "Alison: Yeah, same old Jesse. Too bad you didn't think I was all that in high school.",
        "Jesse: You went to Latin? No way.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and you wouldn't give me the time of day.",
        "Jesse: Oh, I must have been blind.",
        "Alison: You were busy. You had a pretty hopping candy business going out of your parents' basement.",
        "Jesse: Candy? I don't know what you mean.",
        "Alison: I mean, I wasn't a customer back then, but I might like to be one now -- you think you could hook me up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Alison Stewart? Hey, Alison. When did you get back in town?",
        "Margo: Hey, I talked to Danny last night, and he said to tell you that you were right.",
        "Casey: About what?",
        "Margo: Some advice that you gave him about school -- it really helped him out this semester. Something about -- remember that this is boarding school, not boring school?",
        "Casey: Danny's probably the only one who still thinks my jokes are funny. Might want to tell him to get his advice from somewhere else from now on. 'Cause look where he might end up.",
        "Margo: Hey, I didn't bring up your little brother to make you feel bad.",
        "Casey: Everything makes me feel bad, Mom, all right, especially you using the small talk to try and make me feel better.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, okay, okay.",
        "Casey: No, I'm sorry -- that's still what I love about you the most -- you're always trying to cheer me up.",
        "Margo: Don't apologize to me, please. This is really hard for all of us. And I just brought up your little brother so that you know he feels safe and he's okay, and it's just one less thing for you to worry about.",
        "Casey: When I'm in prison.",
        "Margo: Don't jump the gun here. You don't know what -- what the sentencing is gonna be. I mean, you could get probation. You could get community service.",
        "Casey: Or ten years.",
        "Margo: Or ten years. But your father, he submitted a brief on the obstruction of justice charges, and he made it very clear Adam's role in it.",
        "Casey: But without Adam here, it doesn't really do much, does it? It's just hearsay.",
        "Margo: Well, you don't know. The judge could still consider it.",
        "Casey: I wish he'd call me in already. What's taking him so long?",
        "Margo: I'm sure your dad has probably heard something by now. I'll go find out what's going on. You take care.",
        "Casey: Did you see Mom? She's looking for you.",
        "Tom: Yeah, put down the phone, Son.",
        "Casey: No, I want to call Maddie. She's going to be worried sick about me. I want to let her know I'm all right.",
        "Tom: Sorry, Casey. I can't let you do that now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I didn't really know where else to go.",
        "Gwen: That's fine, you're always welcome here. Do you want something to eat? Will and I were about to --",
        "Maddie: No, I can't eat. I can't even think straight.",
        "Will: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Maddie: Casey was told last night that he's being sentenced today.",
        "Gwen: Today?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. He could be going in front of a judge any minute.",
        "Gwen: Well Maddie, why aren't you there?",
        "Maddie: His parents -- they won't let me near him.",
        "Will: Why not?",
        "Maddie: I don't know -- after Margo caught us together, she's convinced that something really bad will happen if I go near him.",
        "Will: Like what? He's arrested.",
        "Maddie: I know. She thinks, I don't know, like I corrupted him or something.",
        "Gwen: I don't understand. I mean, the two of you guys had sex. You're not the first people on the planet to do it.",
        "Will: Maybe they're just really freaked out about Casey and I guess this is their way of trying to keep control of everything.",
        "Maddie: I know. I know that they're scared, but I'm scared, too, and I know Casey has to be the most terrified out of all of us. And I just -- I can't stand it. I can't -- what if they take him away before I even get to say good- bye to him?",
        "Will: Okay, come on, let's go.",
        "Maddie: Where?",
        "Will: The police station.",
        "Maddie: Margo's the chief of police.",
        "Will: Yeah, well, it's a public place. She can't keep you away.",
        "Maddie: She can try.",
        "Will: Well, we'll try harder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You ran away to --",
        "Cleo: New York.",
        "Jade: With?",
        "Cleo: With Will.",
        "Jade: Because?",
        "Cleo: Because they were trying to take my baby.",
        "Jade: Whose name was?",
        "Cleo: Billy.",
        "Jade: Mm-hmm. Except somebody came to get you. Who?",
        "Cleo: My sister, Carly. Only we didn't know that we were sisters yet.",
        "Jade: Right, because?",
        "Cleo: Because pupil was messing with our heads. Come on, do we have to do this? I already know all of it.",
        "Jade: No, you don't. Not if you're calling your mother pupil. Her name is Iris.",
        "Cleo: I know. I was making a joke. Didn't it ever occur to you that everything would fall into place if I could just get out there and practice?",
        "Jade: It's not going to fall into place if you don't know your family members' names.",
        "Cleo: That's ridiculous. People mess up their family's names all the time. My mom used to call all of us by the same name. She'd be like, \"Ruth, no, Delbert, I mean, Cleo.\" And then she'd just give up and ask one of us to get her a drink.",
        "Jade: That's not how Gwen is.",
        "Cleo: I am Gwen.",
        "Jade: The real Gwen knows all her family's names.",
        "Cleo: You know, I have to say, you're making this about as fun as studying for an exam.",
        "Jade: Cleo, this is like studying for an exam. Except I'm paying you. So can we please focus on getting you a good grade?",
        "Cleo: Okay. But I want to go outside and get some fresh air first.",
        "Jade: No, Cleo, no.",
        "Cleo: Excuse me, I am not your prisoner.",
        "Jade: Cleo, somebody could see you.",
        "Cleo: And what? Arrest me for breathing free air? That's ridiculous.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Jade: Shh. That's probably the manager saying we're making too much noise. Be quiet. Luke?",
        "Luke: Where have you been?",
        "Jade: How did you know I was here?",
        "Luke: I didn't. I saw your car coming back from basketball practice. And I described you to the manager.",
        "Jade: Just remind me never to use a front lot.",
        "Luke: Look, Jade, I was really worried about you. You didn't show up for dinner last night or you weren't there for breakfast this morning --",
        "Jade: Oh, I decided to take a break.",
        "Luke: From me?",
        "Jade: I didn't say that.",
        "Luke: You didn't need to. Look, I know I slammed you really hard about giving my mom those pills, but I don't know -- I thought maybe we could talk about it? So can I come in?",
        "Jade: No -- we can talk here.",
        "Luke: You really are mad at me, aren't you?",
        "Jade: No, I'm not mad at you.",
        "Luke: Well then why are you staying at this dump?",
        "Jade: Listen, the place is not that bad, okay? And you know me better than that. How often have I ever held a grudge after one of our arguments?",
        "Luke: Off the top of my head? Like three times.",
        "Jade: You are so lame. Just come on, get out of here.",
        "Luke: You really want me to go, don't you, Jade?",
        "Jade: I'm busy.",
        "Luke: Why are you so eager to get rid of me? Wait, you have somebody in there, don't you? I'm right, aren't I? You've got somebody in there.",
        "Jade: Yeah, yeah, you're right. I'm a big slut.",
        "Luke: Hey, I didn't call you that.",
        "Jade: Yeah, but it's what you think. You think some guy picked me up and he took me back here and we're having a hell of a time.",
        "Luke: Okay, Jade, I'm sorry that I came down really hard on you, but I'm really stressed out with what's happening with my mom. You know, I thought you might like to know she checked herself into rehab last night.",
        "Jade: Oh, my God, Luke, I'm really sorry.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, it's probably the best thing she could do for herself right now. So, where can we go that's like some place to talk that's not a hallway?",
        "Jade: Nowhere.",
        "Luke: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Jade: Yes, I was fine until you interrupted.",
        "Luke: Because when I came to the door, I thought I heard arguing. If there's some guy giving you a hard time I feel --",
        "Jade: Luke, no, there was no guy. It's the maid.",
        "Luke: The maid?",
        "Jade: Yeah, she's a thief.",
        "Luke: A thief?",
        "Jade: Yeah. You know that silver bracelet that I have? I left it on the night stand, and when she came to clean, it was gone.",
        "Luke: Well, then why did you tell me the story about the one night stand?",
        "Jade: Because I thought it's what you'd believe.",
        "Luke: Oh, my god, we are really, really out of synch. Look, I feel really terrible.",
        "Jade: About what?",
        "Luke: Because I feel like it's my fault that you're sitting here getting robbed in some fleabag motel.",
        "Jade: Luke, Luke, its okay. I just need to deal with this. I just don't want her to leave until I get my bracelet back, okay?",
        "Luke: Then let me help.",
        "Jade: I don't want to open up a federal case. I can handle it.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Jade: Luke, there are so many things you just don't understand. Okay, I know what it's like to take something from somebody because you don't have anything nice of your own. All right, let me just handle this my way.",
        "Luke: Okay. I mean, if you say so --",
        "Jade: Yeah. But if you want to talk, I can meet you somewhere.",
        "Luke: Okay, where?",
        "Jade: I can meet you in Old Town in like 20 minutes. Let me just deal with the maid, all right? And Luke, I'm really sorry about your mom.",
        "Luke: Okay. Then see you there.",
        "Cleo: Sorry. Who was that? Was that your boyfriend?",
        "Jade: That was my cousin.",
        "Cleo: Oh. Hey, where are you going?",
        "Jade: I'm going out, all right? Now you study these names.",
        "Cleo: Wait a minute, hold on a second, I'm really hungry.",
        "Jade: There's a soda in the mini-fridge. You can have this.",
        "Cleo: Ew. Hey, I have an idea. Do you think that we could kick this meal up a notch? That's from Emeril. He's my favorite chef.",
        "Jade: Cleo, this'll tide you over until I can get you something when I get back. But don't go anywhere, I mean it.",
        "Cleo: Okay. [In Gwen voice] Don't go anywhere, I mean it. Stupid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Simmons told me you came from seeing the clerk?",
        "Tom: That's right. The judge made his decision.",
        "Casey: Hey, it's not like we didn't know it was going to happen.",
        "Margo: I just want you to know, whatever the judge's decision is that we love you and we're family and we're going to see you through this.",
        "Casey: Look, Mom, Dad, I don't want you to be worried about me. I'm gonna be fine in there.",
        "Tom: We ready?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Maddie: Casey, you're still here. I'm so glad we're not too late.",
        "Casey: Yeah, we're on our way to see the judge now.",
        "Maddie: We want to go with you.",
        "Tom: I wish you'd have respected our request and stayed away from these proceedings.",
        "Will: Wait, don't blame Maddie. This was my idea to come down here.",
        "Margo: I don't think it helps to have --",
        "Casey: It helps me.",
        "Tom: Look, we can't keep the judge waiting.",
        "Casey: Dad, whatever my sentence is, he's already made up his mind. Is two minutes really going to matter?",
        "Tom: Okay, two minutes.",
        "Casey: You guys don't know how much it means that you're here.",
        "Maddie: I want to be here when you hear your sentence.",
        "Will: Yeah, we all do.",
        "Gwen: We know that you got your parents, but we really care about you. Been through a lot together.",
        "Maddie: We want to be here for you.",
        "Will: Look man, it was my idea to come down here. I figured you'd want us to. But if it's too much pressure, then we understand. We just want what's best for you.",
        "Casey: You know what I really want right now?",
        "Will: What?",
        "Casey: Is for you guys to take Maddie to Al's.",
        "Maddie: Casey --",
        "Casey: It's what I want. It's what I want, okay? I'll call you when I find out.",
        "Maddie: Okay.",
        "Tom: Casey, the judge is waiting.",
        "Casey: Maddie, I'm always going to love you. Don't forget that.",
        "Maddie: I love you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Did you by any chance happen to notice I was in the middle of a conversation?",
        "Paul: Sorry, I didn't mean to chase away your friends.",
        "Alison: They're not friends exactly -- they're just kids I went to high school with.",
        "Paul: Didn't think they were a crowd you wanted to hang out with.",
        "Alison: How do you know what I want?",
        "Paul: You're right, I don't. I'm sorry, none of my business.",
        "Alison: You're right, it isn't.",
        "Paul: Why don't we go back and start over again. Hey, Alison, it's great to see you.",
        "Alison: Yeah, whatever.",
        "Paul: Aaron come back with you?",
        "Alison: Why do you care?",
        "Paul: Well, I'm just wondering. You back for good, or is it just a little visit?",
        "Alison: Like I said, why do you care?",
        "Paul: Well, for one thing, Emily's really missed you. She was very upset when you decided to leave.",
        "Alison: But not as upset as when you left her holding her wedding bouquet.",
        "Paul: If I could go back and undo some of the mistakes I've made with Emily and a whole bunch of other people, believe me, I'd jump at the chance.",
        "Alison: Look, if you ask me? The best thing you could do for Emily is steer clear of her. And you know what, the next time you run into me? You can just leave me alone, too.",
        "Paul: What did you just say?",
        "Alison: I said, leave me alone. Hey? What's up with you? Are you okay? Do I need to call a doctor or something?",
        "Paul: No, no, I'm okay.",
        "Alison: Maybe you should just sit down --",
        "Paul: I'm fine.",
        "Alison: No, you're not. You look like you've seen a ghost.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, for a second there, I -- you remind me of somebody.",
        "Alison: You've known me most of my life.",
        "Alison: Don't worry about it. People always think they know me from somewhere. When I was out in Vegas, there was this guy who swore I looked like this movie star that I didn't even know her name. You know what they say about everybody having a double. Well, I'd better get going.",
        "Paul: Yeah, catch up with your friends.",
        "Alison: No, actually, I'm job hunting.",
        "Paul: Hey, well, good luck with that.",
        "Alison: Thanks. Although, I think I'm going to need a little more than luck. If you know anything --",
        "Paul: I thought you wanted me to leave you alone.",
        "Alison: Right. So forget it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: What do you want to eat, Maddie?",
        "Maddie: I don't want anything.",
        "Gwen: Come on, you've got to put something in your system.",
        "Maddie: No, I don't. I can't eat and I can't sleep. I just keep thinking the same thing that I've been thinking since the day Casey turned himself in -- that I'm going to lose him.",
        "Gwen: You don't know that.",
        "Maddie: He could get ten years.",
        "Gwen: That's at the absolute worst. He'll probably get less, right? I mean, a lot less.",
        "Maddie: No, I should've -- I shouldn't have let him come back. I should've made him keep going north when he found us in that cabin.",
        "Will: You couldn't have kept him from coming back. He wanted to do the right thing.",
        "Maddie: The right thing would have been to change our names and go to Canada.",
        "Gwen: And then what? You have no work, you have no friends, you have no one to count on if something goes wrong.",
        "Maddie: Doesn't matter. We would have had each other.",
        "Will: And you would've been fugitives. That's a really great life.",
        "Maddie: We would have worked things out. At least we wouldn't be apart ever.",
        "Gwen: Maddie, you can't say that things would've been better if you'd run away. Because it's just not true.",
        "Will: And besides, Casey didn't want that kind of life for you.",
        "Maddie: And this is better?",
        "Will: At least you're safe.",
        "Maddie: And I can't stay here. I need to be with him.",
        "Gwen: Wait, what about Tom and Margo?",
        "Maddie: If I can't see him at the courthouse, then I'll just wait for them at the house.",
        "Gwen: And you really think that's a good idea right now?",
        "Maddie: You two just told me not to worry. So I'm going to think positive and wait at the house and hope that he comes back and he tells me that he just got community service.",
        "Will: Why can't we just wait here and see what happens?",
        "Maddie: You think that he's going to be thrown in jail already, don't you?",
        "Gwen: No, we're not saying that. We're just saying we don't know what's going to happen, and it'd probably be better if you were with friends right now.",
        "Maddie: You know what, maybe it'll be okay. Maybe the judge will see the same thing that I see in Casey. That he's a good person who just made a really bad decision and he's going to get a second chance.",
        "Gwen: And I honestly hope that you're right. But one way or another, you're not going to be alone right now. So either you're going to stay here, or we're going to come with you.",
        "Maddie: No!",
        "Will: No, we're going to wait with you until Tom and Margo at least get home.",
        "Maddie: No, guys, no. You want to come with me because you think that they're going to put him in jail and I'm going to go crazy. Okay, he's going to come home. And when he does, I'm going to wrap my arms around him and tell him how much I love him.",
        "Will: Are you sure you're going to be okay on your own?",
        "Maddie: Yes, I'm sure I'll be fine.",
        "Gwen: Will you do us a favor? If you get really upset, will you at least call us?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. But he is going to come home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Hey. Sorry I took so long.",
        "Luke: Oh, that's okay. Did you get your bracelet?",
        "Jade: Huh, what?",
        "Luke: The bracelet that the maid stole.",
        "Jade: Oh, yeah, I put it in the safe.",
        "Luke: The Wagon Wheel has a safe? I guess you learn something new every day.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I just don't want to be away from the room too long. I bet that creepy manager has a passkey.",
        "Luke: Jade, why are you even staying there? You have a home with us.",
        "Jade: Sometimes it's just easier to think about your life when nobody's around.",
        "Luke: Why don't you just admit that you're still mad about what I said?",
        "Jade: Because I'm not mad. I understand why you're worried about Lily.",
        "Luke: But my mom is a grown woman. If she can't control how many pills she was taking, that's not your fault. I mean, they sell those things over the counter.",

        "Jade: Luke, it's okay, we all blow up at friends sometimes.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but Jade, you're more than a friend -- you're my family. And I blasted you so hard that you felt like you had to leave the house.",
        "Jade: It's okay. It's really not a big deal.",
        "Luke: No, it's like I didn't even think about how many times you stood up for me. Like when I was coming out and everything. You totally stood up for me to Kevin when he was treating me so badly.",
        "Jade: Ooh, he really deserved it.",
        "Luke: Well, you know, we're kind of actually friends again.",
        "Jade: Well, he should worship you. You did save him at the lake last summer.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but it was you who made him realize how petty he was. And Jade, I am never going to forget that.",
        "Jade: You've really been thinking about this a lot, haven't you?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I have. I've been driving around looking for you. I mean, I couldn't sleep thinking about what I said to you. You don't deserve that.",

        "Jade: No, it's not that. I just need a break.",

        "Jade: I don't know. Just tell them that I am staying with a girlfriend. They're not even going to notice I'm gone with everything that's been going on.",

        "Jade: No, not today. I'm sorry. But I will call you. I'll call you.",

        "Jade: It's Casey's dorky roommate.",
        "Cleo: His roommate? His name's Elwood, right?",
        "Jade: Yeah, Elwood.",
        "Cleo: He's supposed to have a crush on me, right?",
        "Jade: Yeah, all the more reason for you to get out of here.",
        "Cleo: I think it makes him the perfect guinea pig.",

        "Cleo: Yes way. I think it's time that we kick it up a notch.",
        "Jade: Forget it. I told you, you're not ready and I mean it. All right, good. He's gone. You can get back to the motel, Cleo [Cleo goes around the corner and puts on her Gwen wig]-- Cleo? Cleo? Cleo, get back here! Cleo?",
        "Cleo: Hey, Elwood.",
        "Elwood: Oh, hey, Gwen. Gwen -- which version of \"Middle east in the 21st century\" did Dr. Kramer want us to get again?",
        "Cleo: Which version?",
        "Elwood: Yeah, you know, there's the abridged and then there's the unabridged. They're both on the shelf.",
        "Cleo: I don't remember.",
        "Elwood: Okay, what, are you trying to bust my chops? You were the one who asked Kramer which one we should get in the first place. Really, which one is it?",

        "Will: It was me a few years ago.",
        "Gwen: I honestly have no idea how that must've even felt.",
        "Will: You know when you're so scared that you don't know how to feel? It was kind of like that. I was a lot younger than Casey when it was happening to me, and I was getting torn away from my family. I just kind of shut down. But it wasn't the first time that I'd been through something like that. I mean, I spent time at the psych ward at Memorial.",
        "Gwen: Are you talking about when you were accused of setting that fire?",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Gwen: Well honestly, I can't believe that Alison let you take responsibility for that. I mean, you were just a kid.",
        "Will: Well wait, she came clean eventually. And I know that she felt bad.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she should've. Wow, what a coincidence.",
        "Will: You know, you guys used to be friends.",
        "Gwen: I know. I know, I guess we just lost contact.",

        "Will: Hey, Alison.",
        "Alison: Hey. Hey, Will, Gwen. How are the lovebirds?",
        "Will: We're doing great. So how's Oakdale treating you? Are you keeping busy, or are you still bored?",
        "Alison: There're a few things I'm interested in.",
        "Gwen: Do you want to sit down, talk a little bit?",
        "Alison: No, that's okay. You two have already ordered.",

        "Casey: I thought you couldn't stand me.",

        "Casey: You know what you are?",
        "Maddie: Oh, let me think --oh, the winner.",
        "Casey: No, you are a sneak. Actually, you're worse than that. You were like real sneaky. You put on this whole front where you act like you're all cute and innocent, and it's just a disguise for a mean, mean person.",
        "Maddie: Okay, it is not my fault that you're just really bad at this game.",
        "Casey: Oh, that's really nice. Really nice.",
        "Maddie: It just doesn't seem fair.",
        "Casey: It's not. Not to you. But I brought this on myself.",

        "Maddie: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I prayed so hard. And then when I saw your parents coming and you weren't with them, I was scared they'd taken you away and I'd never see you again. Are you okay?",

        "Casey: Thanks.",
        "Maddie: What happened? What did the judge say?",
        "Casey: Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought.",
        "Maddie: I knew it. I knew that he wasn't going to be tough on you. Especially because it's your first offense. So, okay, do you have community service?",
        "Casey: Not exactly.",

        "Alison: Yeah, I was just job hunting.",
        "Will: Well, that's always stressful.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and I'm supposed to go meet my mom and tell her the good news, except I don't have any. So I was going to grab a coffee with about ten sugars and hope it gets me through another lecture about why I should've gone to college. But next time, okay?",
        "Will: Yeah, next time.",
        "Gwen: She hates me.",
        "Will: She doesn't hate you. She's probably just uncomfortable seeing the two of us together.",

        "Will: Yeah, but we're happy.",
        "Gwen: So?",

        "Elwood: Great. Not. 'Cause the abridged version is like 100 pages shorter.",
        "Cleo: Well, you love to read, don't you, Elwood?",
        "Elwood: Yes. I also like to be read to. Any time you feel like ditching that will fella and whispering the Middle East histories into my ear, then you're more than welcome.",

        "Tom: I don't think we should be doing this. It's no more your fault now than it was then. Casey got himself into this situation.",
        "Margo: But you remember that helplessness? Do you remember how you replayed every moment leading up to that, and you just prayed that you could go back and you could do it again, and you could do something different. Or, god, if you could just do anything different. But you can't. Because there's this weight on you, and you can't move. That's how I feel.",
