        "Carly passes out having a close encounter with the skeleton. Jack calls in forensics to process the area, as Mike and Katie explain what happened to her. Jack finds an old change purse in the wall as well. Jack explains to Carly that the team leader can answer her questions later if she has any. As Jack is leaving and she hands him his laundry, their hands touch and the spark still is evident between them, but he still leaves. Jack later asks Mike not to leave town. Katie worries if that means Jack considers him a suspect? Carly hears a strange noise, but stops herself from calling Jack. Jen arrives at the abandoned house where Emily is holding Dusty, frantically calling out to Dusty. She finds pieces of his clothes with blood on them and panics. Emily explains to Dusty she has to kill him now because Jen knows. Paul is brought into the police station after his run in with Henry. Jen calls and explains she is alone at an abandoned house where Emily went. She needs his help. Meg helps Paul escape to go help Jen. Susan and Barbara bond over their children. Henry severs his ties with Emily but he still wants one more thing from her \u0096 his money! Hal is furious with Meg for her role in Paul's escape, so Meg lets him in on Emily's role in Dusty's kidnapping. An emotionally overwrought Emily tells Dusty killing him is the only way, but Dusty tries to stall as he tries to free his hands. He plays on Emily's insecurities, but she starts to break down about how everyone uses and leaves her. She is preparing to shoot him when Dusty breaks free and wrestles the gun away from her. Emily takes off and runs back to the abandoned house, where she runs smack dab into Jen. Dusty is in the woods calling for Jen when he runs right into Paul."

        "Jack: Carly, baby? Come on, wake up.",
        "Mike: Are the kids upstairs?",
        "Katie: No. Thank God.",
        "Mike: Jack, you want me to call an ambulance?",
        "Jack: No, no, she just passed out. She'll be fine. Hey, baby. Hey, are you with us?",
        "Carly: What happened? [Carly screams] Oh my God!",
        "Jack: Hey, it's okay. It's okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: That better be my attorney. Paul? What are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: Are you okay, Mr. Coleman?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Bartender: Between you and me, I hope you press charges. You can't let him get away with that.",
        "Henry: With what? Throwing me up against a wall and shredding what's left of my dignity? I hope he gets life. Hey, I could use many, many martinis.",
        "Bartender: On the house.",
        "Henry: Thank you. Well, Emily, this is the last message you're ever going to receive. And its way more than you deserve. Your beloved husband is onto you, and that is a fact that he made excruciatingly clear about ten minutes ago when he's threatened to rearrange my face if I didn't tell him where you were. So anyway, he's been arrested and that gives you a little bit of time to get out of dodge. Now I suggest you take advantage of this opportunity unless you want to spend the rest of your days in the penal system. So good-bye, Emily, good-bye. This is it, we're done. I don't ever want to see you or hear from you ever again.",
        "Susan: Henry, what has my daughter done now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door creaking open]",
        "Emily: Don't even think about it. You breathe wrong, I pull the trigger.",
        "Jennifer: Hello? Dusty. Oh my God, Dusty! Dusty? Dusty? Dusty",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Is that a person?",
        "Jack: It's just a bunch of old bones, honey, that's all --",
        "Carly: In our house?",
        "Jack: Hey, listen. I'm going to take care of this, okay? You just focus on me and I'm going to get you out of here, honey.",
        "Carly: Mm-hm.",
        "Jack: Okay, come on. Come on. I want you two to follow us upstairs, please. And do not touch anything.",
        "Mike: Katie?",
        "Katie: Oh my God, Mike. No wonder you were so freaked out.",
        "Mike: I'd give anything if you hadn't had to see that. Okay? All right, c'mon.",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Carly: No, I am not okay, Jack! Who -- who is that down there?",
        "Jack: I'm afraid we have no idea, Carly. Listen, I have to make some calls. I want to get forensics here and I want to secure the scene. If you have questions at all, I'm sure Mike and Katie can answer some of them for you. But I want the three of you to stay up here. As soon as we know something, I'll fill you in.",
        "Katie: Can I get you something, Carly? Tea?",
        "Carly: No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine, thanks.",
        "Mike: Look, Carly, I know you probably have a lot of questions. I don't know what Jack told you, but this is all my fault. And I am very sorry.",
        "Carly: So am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I've been trying to reach Emily all day.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and, well, that's a lost cause. If you'll excuse me.",
        "Susan: But weren't you just talking to her?",
        "Henry: No. Not that's any of your business, but I was leaving her a message.",
        "Susan: Why are you so angry? What is going on, Henry? Tell me. I'm her mother. I have a right to know if she's in trouble.",
        "Henry: She's a grown woman. And you know what? And if she is in trouble, trust me, you don't want to know.",
        "Susan: I do want to know. Obviously something is very, very wrong. Oh, I know. She's probably sworn you to secrecy. But you know and I know that she needs help. Her behavior these past few weeks has been totally irrational.",
        "Henry: I know. It's been a joy, it has.",
        "Susan: That's why we have to help her.",
        "Henry: No, I'm out of the helping Emily business.",
        "Susan: Since when?",
        "Henry: Susan, I got to go.",
        "Susan: Henry? Henry, what kind of friend are you? You stood up for her at her wedding, for God's sakes. You were her ring bearer.",
        "Henry: Not my choice.",
        "Susan: I don't understand.",
        "Henry: And I can't explain. I'm sorry, Susan, if that's rude in any kind of way. But when it comes to Emily, that's the best I can do.",
        "Susan: Henry, what have you done?",
        "Henry: Me?",
        "Susan: Have you done something to her? Have you involved her in one of your schemes?",
        "Henry: Oh my God. What is this, my fault now? Come on.",
        "Susan: Anybody who would encourage her to marry Paul Ryan --",
        "Henry: That was her idea.",
        "Susan: He's paying you. He's paying you. That's why you cozied up to her in the first place.",
        "Henry: She cozied up to me. She cozied up to me, not that that's any of your concern. And as for Paul, he just tried to kill me, all right? Don't believe me, call the police. So, no, he is not paying me. No, we are not friends.",
        "Susan: He tried to kill you, why?",
        "Henry: Because he's as crazy as your daughter.",
        "Susan: You think he tried to hurt her?",
        "Henry: Like I said, Susan, he's in jail. Remember?",
        "Susan: Does she know?",
        "Henry: Why? You want to throw them another wedding? We're done here.",
        "Susan: Henry, don't leave now that you've -- oh, Henry!",
        "Hal: Susan?",
        "Susan: Oh, Hal, thank God you've come.",
        "Hal: I got your message. What's going on?",
        "Susan: It's Emily. And I know that you said you've washed your hands of her. But she's disappeared. And Henry Coleman just told me that Paul -- Paul Ryan tried to kill him!",
        "Hal: What?",
        "Susan: He tried to kill him but he's been arrested. He's been arrested again. Please, something is terribly wrong. Please tell me that you'll help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop #2: Excuse me, ma'am. We weren't aware the room was occupied.",
        "Meg: Not a problem. He doesn't look dangerous.",
        "Cop #2: You didn't have to wrestle him into the patrol car.",
        "Cop #1: We can put him downstairs.",
        "Perpetrator: I want my lawyer. It's my right! What about my rights?",
        "Meg: What happened?",
        "Paul: I was trying to get Henry Coleman to tell me where Emily had gone and I guess the bartender at the Lakeview must have called the cops.",
        "Meg: Wait, I don't understand. I thought you and Emily were honeymooning.",
        "Paul: Okay, look. We've got about two seconds before they come back in here and separate us, so I need your help. Jennifer knows about Emily and she's gone after her.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: I had to tell her everything. I think that after she saw the photograph and everything that you told her, she pretty much figured everything out already. But, anyway, we made a plan. We told Emily that Dusty had escaped, hoping that Emily would go check on Dusty. That way we could follow Emily. But then I got knocked out and Jennifer's out there all by herself and I can't get a hold of her and if Emily sees Jennifer before I can get there, god only knows what's going to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Dusty?",
        "Emily: Cut it out! Cut it out. I mean it. I will kill you and then your girlfriend. Come on, let's go. Hurry it up. Keep moving.",
        "Dusty: So now what?",
        "Emily: You don't know?",
        "Dusty: With you? I don't know anything.",
        "Emily: This is it, Dusty. It's over. Jennifer knows. I have to finish this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So for all these years there has been a body in the basement?",
        "Mike: The truth is, we don't really know.",
        "Carly: But you knew about the jewelry, right? And you didn't tell me about that. Mike? We lived here together. For crying out loud, I thought you trusted me.",
        "Mike: I do trust you. I just -- I didn't think about it.",
        "Carly: How do you not think about something like that?",
        "Mike: Well, obviously, I blocked it out. Look, I just -- I wanted to start fresh, Carly. All that went down when I was a kid. You know, I wouldn't remember it unless I was forced to. And that didn't happen until Katie's book came out.",
        "Carly: Wait, Katie, you wrote \"Oakdale Confidential\"?",
        "Katie: Yes, and I'm really sorry. I -- I didn't mean to upset anyone by it. Please don't tell Jack that I wrote it. He said he was so upset when he read the parts about you two. I mean, it's not real. It's fiction. And I shouldn't have used the peoples' real names.",
        "Mike: It's all right. It's all right. It's not your fault.",
        "Katie: I just really wish that you wouldn't tell Jack.",
        "Carly: No, don't worry about it. Jack and I don't have many conversations these days.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry about that. And I'm sorry I wrote the book.",
        "Mike: Look, look, look, I am the one who hid the jewelry in the basement. If I'd have gone to the cops way back when, none of this would've happened.",
        "Carly: And you have no idea who stole the jewelry or who put that person down there?",
        "Mike: No. Forgive me, Carly. I never meant to hurt you or your family like this.",
        "Katie: Mike had nothing to do with putting that body there. He didn't even know it was there until a couple of days ago.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, I'm not accusing you of anything, really. It's just awful when you think about it. That somebody was walled up like that. You don't have any idea who he is?",
        "Katie: Or she. It could be a woman, right?",
        "Carly: Oh, I don't even want to think about it.",
        "Mike: Forensics will be able to tell us more pretty soon. Until then, your guess is as good as mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: There's several generations of plaster. There may be bone fragments, hair, fibers and who knows what else stuck between the layers. I think it's important that we're very, very careful when we pick it all up. I want you two guys to take the wall. There's a good chance that this thing might have to come down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Henry was angry but there was something more. I'm telling you, Hal, the man had fear in his eyes.",
        "Hal: You think he's afraid of Emily?",
        "Susan: And Paul.",
        "Hal: I'd take that with a grain of salt.",
        "Susan: But Paul just tried to kill him and you must admit, it's very strange the way Emily just suddenly disappeared. And there's something else, too. I called her earlier today to try to mend a few fences and I suggested that we get together, but she refused. Something about having to wait for a delivery for Daniel, but that's ridiculous. She's got a doorman. And anyway, I always know when she's lying. I would have written it off, but you know how long she can hold onto a grudge.",
        "Hal: Only too well.",
        "Susan: I thought she was trying to avoid me, but then she said something very strange. Something about having everything under control.",
        "Hal: What did she mean by that?",
        "Susan: I have no idea. Except that it must have had something to do with Paul trying to kill Henry.",
        "Hal: Look, I'm no fan of Paul's, but before we accuse him of attempted murder, let us not forget that Henry is not exactly what you'd call a reliable witness.",
        "Susan: He's not reliable. In fact, I've hated the fact that Emily's been hanging out with him these past few weeks. But I guess that's over.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Hal: Munson. Yes, I'll be right there.",
        "Susan: What?",
        "Hal: Well, Henry was right about one thing. Paul's been arrested.",
        "Susan: Oh, and you've got to go. Okay.",
        "Hal: I'll call when I know something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Paul: Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, thank God, Paul. I didn't get a signal. I couldn't get through.",
        "Paul: Are you all right?",
        "Jennifer: Where are you, Paul? You have to get here. I don't know where Emily is.",
        "Paul: You lost her?",
        "Jennifer: No, I followed her like we planned and she drove to the woods to this house and I went inside.",
        "Paul: What? Jennifer, did she hurt you? Did Emily hurt you?",
        "Jennifer: There was blood. And I found pieces of his shirt. And I know it was Dusty's. I know it was.",
        "Paul: But Dusty wasn't there?",
        "Jennifer: No, Emily hurt him and I think that she still has him. You have to get here Paul. I can't do this by myself. Where are you?",
        "Paul: I got hung up.",
        "Jennifer: I can't do this by myself.",
        "Paul: You don't have to. You just -- you just -- you just need to stay where you -- where are you? Jennifer?",
        "[Rustling in the bushes]",
        "Jennifer: I heard something. I think it's them.",
        "Paul: Well, look, just hide, okay? Stay away from Emily. She's dangerous. And tell me where you are. Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: The end of Old Mill Trail. There's an abandoned farmhouse near the bluffs.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I know where that is.",
        "Jennifer: And you'll come in a hurry?",
        "Paul: Fast as I can.",
        "Jennifer: Hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Stop. Dusty, I said stop!",
        "Dusty: Why, are you going to shoot me?",
        "Emily: Yes, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: So go ahead. Do it. You want to shoot me in the back?",
        "Emily: I don't want to shoot you at all.",
        "Dusty: All right, so don't. It buys you nothing right now, anyway.",
        "Emily: They'll never find your body. They'll never know that I was the one.",
        "Dusty: Paul knows. You think he's going to cover for you? He wants me dead. He wants you convicted of my murder. But it doesn't have to go down that way. I told you.",
        "Emily: I don't know what else to do.",
        "Dusty: You can get your story out there before he does. But if you fall apart right now and shoot me, that's murder, baby. That's the rest of your life.",
        "Emily: Yeah? Like that matters?",
        "Dusty: It matters if you don't want to spend the rest of your life in jail, that's what I'm saying. You got to get the D.A. to see that it was Paul's idea.",
        "Emily: Paul's idea?",
        "Dusty: Paul's idea, not your idea. So it's on him. You walk away clean. But you got to let me go.",
        "Emily: I can't.",
        "Dusty: Why not?",
        "Emily: I can't lose Paul.",
        "Dusty: And what do you think he'll be doing while you're in jail?",
        "Emily: Shut up. Just shut up. I can't think.",
        "Dusty: He wants to get rid of me because I got close to his sister. And who do you think he sent to do his dirty work? I'm looking at ya. Now is that fair?",
        "Emily: No, it's not fair. Not after everything I've done for him.",
        "Dusty: Oh, I bet you did it all. You know why? Because Paul Ryan's weak. And weak men are the most dangerous.",
        "Emily: Why?",
        "Dusty: Because strong women like you, they get sucked in. You take care of his needs and he plays you. He makes you feel needed.",
        "Emily: Yeah, that's what he did.",
        "Dusty: But, it's not you he needs. It's anybody. Somebody who will do what he says, and if they don't, he'll find somebody new.",
        "Emily: Meg.",
        "Dusty: Meg, he's using meg like he's using you. Somebody should put a stop to this.",
        "Emily: I tried. I tried.",
        "Dusty: He doesn't deserve you, you know that? Why don't you make a decision to take your life back.",
        "[Emily crying]",
        "Emily: I thought it was possible. I really thought it could happen, that me and Paul, we could be happy and you and Jennifer. We could all finally be happy again.",
        "Dusty: You can. You can. Not like this. You got to go back. To the way it used to be. You got to spend time with your son. Take care of him. You can do it. I know you can. You just got to walk away.",
        "Emily: I just don't want to be alone.",
        "Dusty: You're not alone.",
        "Emily: I don't want to be alone.",
        "Dusty: You're not. You got your son. You have your son and you have your mother.",
        "Emily: I just want -- I just want to be loved, you know? Is that so much to ask for?",
        "Dusty: No. No. But you got to get some rest. You got to put down the gun. You got to get some rest and then -- then you can take a good, hard look at what you want. And if it's a guy, it better be someone who takes care of you. Puts you first. Someone you can trust.",
        "Emily: I thought I could trust him.",
        "Dusty: No, you can't trust him. Look at what he did to Jennifer.",
        "Emily: It never works out for me. They leave me. Everybody leaves me. They use me or they just -- when you love somebody, you don't just walk away. You work it out. You see it through.",
        "Dusty: That's right.",
        "Emily: That's not me. I don't do that. If I love you, I do everything for you.",
        "Dusty: That's because you're a good person.",
        "Emily: I'm a good person. I am a good girl. And everybody leaves me. You leave me. Paul leaves me. Everybody leaves me and I'm sick of it!",
        "Dusty: And you should be sick of it!",
        "Emily: I am sick of it, and I know what you want me to do. You want me to walk away.",
        "Dusty: I want you to take your life back!",
        "Emily: What life? What life? I'm going to jail because of you.",
        "Dusty: No.",
        "Emily: Yes I am. So what? So what? You can go back to Jennifer and be happy with Jennifer? You don't give a damn about me. You're using me.",
        "Dusty: Paul's using you.",
        "Emily: No, you're using me. You! Paul! All of you.",

        "Forensics expert: Find something?",
        "Jack: Yeah, maybe. Listen, I want you to take the purse and its contents and analyze it, along with the plaster and the bones and anything else you might find.",
        "Mike: I have no idea whose body that is in the basement, and trust me, I have been wracking my brain, all right? But I didn't put it there and it wasn't there when I stashed the jewelry.",
        "Katie: And for all we know, the body could have been put there years later.",
        "Carly: But why there, in your hiding place, unless it's connected? Obviously, whoever buried the body knew about the jewelry.",
        "Katie: Maybe not. Maybe he just found the jewelry and kept it. I mean, people used to hide their valuables in the walls all the time, maybe the murderer just figured he got lucky.",
        "Carly: No, no, you can't really believe that.",
        "Katie: I don't know. All I know is that Mike had nothing to do with it.",
        "Mike: I'm just hoping Jack can figure it out. You find anything?",
        "Jack: The team's still working. There gonna be down there for a while, so you two can head back to the cottage if you want.",
        "Katie: Actually, I was thinking maybe we should go over to the Lakeview for a drink. This has been really stressful.",
        "Jack: Fine. I'll meet you over there in a little while.",
        "Katie: Oh. Okay.",

        "Carly: I know.",
        "Jack: Mike fill you in?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, he told me about the jewelry and finding the bones --",
        "Jack: And you understand that this is a crime scene. Which means, you are not to touch the door to the basement. Don't even look at it. And it's an ongoing investigation, so you need to maintain confidentiality.",
        "Carly: I know what a crime scene is, Jack.",
        "Jack: Then you know you can't say anything to anybody, Carly, under penalty of law.",
        "Carly: What do you think I'm going to do? I'm going to go out and tell everybody there's a body in my basement?",
        "Jack: I never know what you're going to do, Carly.",
        "Carly: Thank you for that.",
        "Jack: I don't think it's a good idea for the kids to stay here tonight.",
        "Carly: No, of course not. I just have to make a couple calls. Sage is next door and J.J.'s at the Stanhopes'. Where are you gonna be?",
        "Jack: At the station.",
        "Carly: You're gonna sleep at the station?",
        "Jack: Nobody's going to get much sleep tonight. I should get going. The guys are going to be here for awhile.",
        "Carly: So you said.",

        "Jack: I got to go.",
        "Carly: Oh, wait. Here.",
        "Jack: What is this?",
        "Carly: It's your laundry.",
        "Jack: Carly, you don't have to do my laundry.",
        "Carly: It was in the dryer already. I thought you might need it. And this is parker's -- his baseball uniform is in there. So could you drop it by or maybe give it to hal at the office?",
        "Jack: Thank you. Okay.",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, wait a second here. I've been waiting here all day and he gets drive-through service?",
        "Paul: Look, by all means, take the lady first.",
        "Meg: Yeah, good luck getting an attorney. You know what, would you be able to see if my attorney is here yet? I don't want to have to lodge a complaint. Please? Hey, would you be able to check on my mother, give her a call? Emma Snyder. Jack Snyder's aunt? You know, she hired the guy, so she'd be kind of upset if he doesn't show up. And if she's upset, Jack's upset. And you don't want Jack upset, because I'd feel sorry for you. What? Go, go ask your partner, he'll tell you who I am. Did Jennifer say where she was?",
        "Paul: Yeah. And I got to get there. Jennifer's freaking out. She saw blood. Dusty's blood.",
        "Meg: Does she know it's Dusty's blood?",
        "Paul: It was on his shirt.",
        "Cop #1: Your lawyer's tied up in court right now. And as for your mother --",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Yes, Emily it's me again. I know I told you that message would be my last, but then I forgot something. It dawned on me that when I told you to get out of town as fast as your pointy little hooves would carry you, I neglected to mention the fact that I would appreciate it if you would tell me where my money is before you go on the lamb. When you consider I was under no obligation to warn you about Paul following you, it just seems to me that the nicest thing you could do is return to me what is rightfully mine. Thanks. Good-bye, Emily.",
        "Barbara: Why were you warning Emily about Paul?",
        "Henry: Barbara, can you wear a bell or something so people know when you're coming up behind them?",
        "Barbara: Emily and Paul were married last I heard.",
        "Henry: Yes, yes. And boy, we missed you at the wedding. What happened, did Paul forget to send you the invitation?",
        "Barbara: Maybe my son didn't want to subject me to watching him say his vows in a jail cell. Ever think of that?",
        "Henry: No, I think he just hated your guts.",
        "Barbara: Why don't you answer my question? Why were you warning Emily about her husband?",
        "Henry: Because he's a raving lunatic, Barbara. And because he brutally attacked me, without any provocation, mind you, less than an hour ago.",
        "Barbara: My son attacked you physically?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Barbara: That doesn't sound like Paul.",
        "Henry: Well, you can tell that to my wrist. Fortunately, the Oakdale PD are a lot more sympathetic than you are.",
        "Barbara: You got the police involved?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes. Your bouncing baby boy is back in the slam. I hope he stays there this time.",
        "Barbara: Whatever Paul's done, Emily Stewart is the reason! That woman brings out the worst in everyone.",
        "Susan: Speak up, Barbara. I don't think they heard you out on the street.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Susan, I didn't see you there.",

        "Cop #1: He was picked up.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I guess Henry told you. He called the cops on your son.",
        "Barbara: Yes, he mentioned something about that. Though, I don't put any stock in anything that Henry Coleman has to say.",
        "Susan: Well, this time he was telling the truth. I was with Hal when he got the call. Your son's back in the slammer again.",
        "[Barbara sighs]",
        "Barbara: I better go see if there's anything I can do.",
        "Susan: Oh, relax. If there is the equivalent of frequent flyer miles over at the Oakdale jail, your son must be getting an upgrade to a first-class cell. [Barbara laughs] You must be proud.",
        "Barbara: Okay, Susan, we're even now. Can we stop trading insults, all right?",
        "Susan: Why did he do it?",
        "Barbara: Henry is a very annoying man. I've wanted to slug him myself on more than a few occasions.",
        "Susan: No. Why did Paul marry Emily? She thought it was over. She thought he had moved on. And then out of the blue he told her he loved her and that he was wrong to bail on her the first time when they were supposed to get married.",
        "Barbara: Paul said that?",
        "Susan: I didn't believe it, either, but she did. So she went through with that horrible, pathetic wedding ceremony. And then Paul got out of jail. And now, I don't know, it's like, she's dropped off the map. I'm afraid something's happened -- something bad.",
        "Barbara: Like what?",
        "Susan: I don't know, I just have a bad feeling that -- that she's in worse trouble than she's ever been in and marrying Paul, somehow, has brought it all to a head.",
        "Barbara: Oh, right, when I doubt, blame Paul Ryan.",
        "Susan: I don't -- not entirely. Emily got herself into this. But I just wish I knew what Paul was getting out of it.",
        "Barbara: Well, I wish I could tell you, Susan. But as I'm sure you already know, Paul really doesn't confide in me much anymore. I call him every day, I leave messages, he never returns my calls.",
        "Susan: Yeah, Emily never calls me back, either.",
        "Barbara: Well, I guess we have something in common, for one night.",
        "Susan: I guess so.",
        "Barbara: So, what do we do now? Shake hands?",
        "Susan: Ooh, I don't know. Is there anything in the mother-in-law's manual that covers this?",
        "Barbara: I don't think so.",
        "Susan: Just don't ask me to buy you a drink. I don't think I could deal with the temptation.",
        "Barbara: Well, then, there's always a decaf cappuccino. If you don't mind being seen on the street with me.",

        "Mike: I don't know if it's over, exactly.",
        "Katie: Well, we don't know the identity of the skeleton and we don't know who put it there, but you told the police about the jewelry. You brought them to where the skeleton was. I mean, you've done your part. You apologized to Carly. Now we can go home and you can sleep. It's all good.",
        "Mike: I hope so.",

        "Jack: Good.",
        "Katie: Did you find out who the skelton belonged to?",
        "Jack: No, not yet. Forensics still has to sift through all that plaster, look for hairs, fibers, blood. Anything that can give them a clue about that body.",
        "Katie: I'm surprised it went so long without being noticed.",
        "Mike: I have a feeling this skeleton pre-dated Jack and carly.",
        "Jack: If, in fact, it was a dead body that was dumped in that wall and not just the remains.",
        "Katie: How do you find that out?",
        "Jack: Well, the microbiologists gotta get in there and do their thing. It could take some time.",
        "Katie: Did you find anything else in the wall?",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's why I'm here. I don't know how long this is gonna take. I'm hoping that forensics gets back to me as early as tomorrow with their preliminary findings -- date of death, age and sex of the victim.",
        "Katie: It's just so strange. I mean, you see that skeleton and it's terrifying, and then you realize it was actually a live person once.",
        "Jack: That's because death is staring you in the face, Katie. But you're right, that was a real live person at one time and they deserves a name and a decent burial.",
        "Katie: How's Carly holding up?",
        "Jack: That's why I wanted to talk to you guys here instead of back at the house. She's still pretty shaken up. She'll be okay, though. Mike, you're not planning any business trips anytime soon, are ya?",
        "Katie: Why are you asking? It's not like he's a suspect, is he?",
        "Jack: No, let's not jump the gun here. I just may have some questions once forensics gives me something to go on.",
        "Mike: Jack, I'll help you any way I can, but I have no idea who the victim is.",
        "Jack: I know. That could change once we narrow it down, that's all.",

        "Mike: I still might be.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Mike: First thing he said when he came up here was he was working. Then he told me not to leave town.",
        "Katie: That's just because he said that he might need your help. They might need more information when they identify who the skelton was, that's it. I mean, he can't actually think that you had anything to do with how that person died. He can't.",
