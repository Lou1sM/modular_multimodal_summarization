        "Jade: I knew this would backfire.",
        "Cleo: What's the big deal? He ran into Gwen. It was bound to happen. The point is, he believed that I was her.",
        "Jade: Did you take one look to see what she was wearing? She was wearing a completely different outfit than you are.",
        "Cleo: You're right, she looks really cute.",
        "Jade: That is not the point. Would you get back to the hotel room? Now! Before everything we've been working on is ruined. And would you take the wig off? And don't talk to anybody!",
        "Cleo: What's the magic word?",
        "Jade: Turlock.",
        "Cleo: It's please.",

        "Elwood: Look, just admit what you did. You changed your shirt.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, when I got out of bed this morning.",
        "Elwood: No, not this morning, like ten minutes ago!",
        "Jade: Hey, Handsome, you're just the guy I was looking for.",
        "Elwood: Me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Hey, where's Faith?",
        "Meg: Hi, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: Where's my little trooper? Back from her therapy session on her difficult young life?",
        "Meg: Actually, Holden took her to the movies.",
        "Lucinda: On a school night?",
        "Meg: Well, apparently her session went well, and she finished her homework and they needed a little daddy-daughter time.",
        "Lucinda: Who said that the session went well?",
        "Meg: Holden.",
        "Lucinda: How does he know?",
        "Meg: Are you okay?",
        "Lucinda: What's that got to do with anything?",
        "Meg: Apparently the therapist spoke to him and Faith spoke to him and --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, for heavens sake! Did Faith eat her dinner?",
        "Meg: Lucinda, she's fine. Holden took her to Java. Would you like some tea?",
        "Lucinda: That pile of twigs your mother is always forcing on me?",
        "Meg: You know, most of us like her rosehip tea.",
        "Lucinda: No, not for me, Darling. I could use a glass of water, though.",
        "Meg: Sure. They still have you on the Tamoxifen?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, it's just precautionary.",
        "Meg: Okay, good. Look, I'm sorry about Craig and Worldwide.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling, Darling, why should you be sorry? None of it was your fault.",
        "Meg: Actually, it kind of is.",
        "Lucinda: What are you talking about?",
        "Meg: It goes back to me and Paul.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Paul. If I never hear his name again, I'll feel better.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Lucinda: He came to me this morning with some kind of a sob story about, he cares about and he wants to get together with me --",
        "Meg: You talked to Paul?",
        "Lucinda: He talked, I said no.",
        "Meg: To what?",
        "Lucinda: He wants us to get together and take care of Craig -- of course I didn't believe one, single word of that.",
        "Meg: He's telling the truth, Lucinda, he's on your side.",

        "[Paul remembering]",
        "Paul: I need you to say something for me.",
        "Alison: Like what?",
        "Paul: Five little words. I know what you did.",
        "Alison: Fine. I know what you did.",
        "Paul: I know you're not Rosanna. But when you speak, it's like she's here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I promise you I'm good for it.",
        "Jesse: Do I have to say this again? No cash, no candy.",
        "Alison: Come on, it's me -- Alison. We went to high school together.",
        "Jesse: Yeah, which is the only reason that we're still talking.",
        "Rob: We have people waiting, people with money.",
        "Alison: Okay, look. Why don't you give me your number so that I can call you when I do get the cash?",
        "Rob: You can call me anytime.",
        "Alison: Its seven digits. What are they? Great. I'll call you.",
        "Emily: There you are. Where have you been?",
        "Dusty: Who are your friends? I'd like to meet them.",
        "Alison: Sure, why not? Guys, this is my sister and a friend of hers. Emily, you remember Jesse and Rob.",
        "Emily: Actually, I don't believe we've met.",
        "Alison: We went to Oakdale Latin together.",
        "Rob: Hi, it's nice to see you again, Emily.",
        "Emily: And you're?",
        "Rob: Rob -- Rob Emerson.",
        "Jesse: I'm Jesse Calhoun.",
        "Alison: I'll catch you guys later.",
        "Jesse: It was nice to meet you.",
        "Alison: So what was so urgent?",
        "Emily: You weren't there when I went home.",
        "Alison: And that's a crime?",
        "Emily: Mom called because she was upset she had to go to the hospital and leave you all alone and she wanted me to go there and keep you company. But low and behold, you weren't there.",
        "Alison: I went for a walk. I can't sit in the house all day -- it's boring. What am I supposed to do while she's gone? Wax the floor?",
        "Emily: No, you're supposed to stay home Alison, or call me and tell me where you're going and why.",
        "Alison: What are you, my parole officer?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you're on probation.",
        "Alison: Says who?",
        "Emily: Says me. Now where were you and what were you doing?",
        "Alison: I told you, I went for a walk.",
        "Dusty: You do a little business with the boys?",
        "Alison: No, of course not.",
        "Dusty: Sure you didn't try to cop some candy?",
        "Alison: We went to high school together.",
        "Dusty: Is that an answer?",
        "Alison: Do I look high?",
        "Dusty: No, but your friend was flying.",
        "Alison: That's just the way he is.",
        "Dusty: Uh-huh, give me your bag.",
        "Alison: Are you serious?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you're a user, Alison. You leave the house without permission. Hanging out with three guys who were high.",
        "Alison: You want to drag me into the bathroom and search me?",
        "Emily: No, Alison, what we want is for you to follow the rules.",
        "Alison: What am I, two?",
        "Emily: Do you want me to trust you or not?",
        "Dusty: She's clean.",
        "Alison: I don't know, Dusty, without a body cavity search, you might never know. I could have a kilo of coke stashed on me somewhere, for all you know.",
        "Emily: All right, all right Alison, I know it's hard with us checking up on you every time you turn around, but that's just the way it's going to be until we make sure you're not self-destructing.",
        "Alison: I'm not self-destructing. And until you two showed up and decided to play good cop and bad cop, I was happy, I was making a living --",
        "Dusty: As a porn star, you were making a living. Come on, if you're so proud of yourself, why not advertise it? Plenty of dudes in this town would pay to see you in action.",
        "Alison: You know Dusty, it's too bad your wife was a junkie.",
        "Emily: Alison.",
        "Alison: What? I'm not Jennifer, and I'm not his problem.",
        "Dusty: You don't know what your problem is.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I do. You. You're my problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Elwood: Now, do I know you? I mean, I've seen you around. But have we met?",
        "Jade: Elwood, I'm kind of hurt. I'm usually the kind of girl that guys remember.",
        "Elwood: Oh, okay, yeah I remember you now. It's just that well, I'm the kind of guy that girls like you usually avoid -- unless you want something.",
        "Jade: I do want something. I want your brain. I was in the bookstore earlier and I was talking to the clerk, which was no help, but he did tell me one thing. That if I had any questions, to come to you.",
        "Elwood: Yeah, okay, about what?",
        "Jade: You know, school and courses. And books.",
        "Elwood: Okay, care to narrow it down at all?",
        "Jade: Oh, I don't know what course to take. People have told me that I have a knack for fiction. Maybe creative writing? Can you major in that?",
        "Gwen: What? Lying? You could teach a college course on that.",
        "Elwood: I've got a class, so I'm gonna split. But I'm sure I'll see you guys around.",
        "Gwen: You wanna leave him alone?",
        "Jade: I wasn't doing anything to him.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Will: It's Maddie. Hey Maddie, how's everything going? Is the hearing over? You're kidding. I'm so sorry. Do you want me to tell Gwen? Okay, I'll tell her. All right, just tell Casey to -- I don't know, I guess hang in there.",
        "Gwen: What happened?",
        "Will: He's going to prison.",
        "Gwen: What? No, no, I thought they were going to be able to work something out -- community service, probation or something.",
        "Will: I guess the judge didn't go for it.",
        "Gwen: I can't believe it. Did they say how long?",
        "Will: 180 days.",
        "Gwen: 180 days? That's -- that's six months.",
        "Will: He's tougher than he looks. Right? He can handle it.",
        "Gwen: That's so unfair.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I'll say. All the kid did was steal some bonds. You tried to kill his brother and left him for dead.",
        "Will: Why don't you shut up Jade?",
        "Jade: Good luck with your grief, Gwen. I'm sure you'll get over it.",
        "Gwen: She's right. What I did was a lot worse.",
        "Will: Gwen, you can't compare the two. So stop it.",
        "Gwen: I have no idea what I would do without you.",
        "Will: Neither do I.",
        "Gwen: Can Casey appeal?",
        "Will: No, I don't think so. He pleaded guilty, so the decision is up to the judge.",
        "Gwen: Did Maddie say when he has to report for incarceration?",
        "Will: No, she didn't, which means we still have a little time to do something for him.",
        "Gwen: Like what?",
        "Will: Come on. Let's go. I'll tell you on the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Jade is calling on her cell phone]",
        "Jade: Hey, are you back at the motel? Okay, good. Stay there. I'll be right there. What? I got you magazines yesterday. Besides, we don't have any time for that. After what just happened, we have to step up the plan.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Why would Paul be on my side? He doesn't care about me or my family.",
        "Meg: Well, he cares about me, and I care about the family.",
        "Lucinda: Well, that's very chivalrous of him but Darling, don't believe a word he says. He's just like his mother, he's out for number one.",
        "Meg: You're wrong. He's changed.",
        "Lucinda: And you're very young.",
        "Meg: Yes, and foolish, you're right. I made a colossal mistake trusting Craig and it's one of the reasons he went after you.",
        "Lucinda: No Darling, I think Craig went after Worldwide as a lever. He thought it would be a way to force me to tell him where Johnny is. As if a corporation and a child are to be equated in some strange way. Anyway, the laugh's on Craig. Because I don't know where Johnny is, and guess what? He has to turn up, show up and work every single day.",
        "Meg: Well, you sound very chipper for a woman who just lost her company.",
        "Lucinda: I'm gonna get it back.",
        "Meg: And I'd like to help.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I don't need your help.",
        "Meg: Well, I need to make amends. Look, maybe Craig did have his eye on Worldwide because of Johnny, but he pulled the trigger because of me. He caught me with Paul.",
        "Lucinda: Why would that matter to him?",
        "Meg: Because Craig was -- well, he was hoping he'd have a chance with me.",
        "Lucinda: Meg, why would he think that?",
        "Meg: Because, we became friends and maybe a little bit more, but I never made any promises. And I should have known that he'd be disappointed, and a disappointed Craig is a dangerous Craig.",
        "Lucinda: You knew he was coming after Worldwide?",
        "Meg: No, of course not! Otherwise, I would have warned you.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, you're just feeling guilty. And you'll get over it.",
        "Meg: Look, I am going after Craig!",
        "Lucinda: Well, Darling, I don't mean to be cruel but you are an unemployed nurse slinging hash in a ghastly diner. Now, what can you accomplish that my lawyers can't?",
        "Meg: Whatever I have to.",
        "Lucinda: And Paul\ufffds onboard for that? He'll let you?",
        "Meg: It's my fight, Lucinda, not Paul\ufffds.",
        "Lucinda: But Paul\ufffds been fighting with Craig forever. He sacrificed his nephew, he sacrificed --",
        "Meg: Paul's changed.",
        "Lucinda: Poppycock!",
        "Meg: Look, it's true. Ever since his accident, he's changed, he's different.",
        "Lucinda: He's hallucinating. Yeah, I heard that.",
        "Meg: Okay, look, I don't expect you to like him -- as a matter of fact, its better if you don\ufffdt. That way Craig will never suspect that you've joined forces with Paul.",
        "Lucinda: No, I'm not joining forces with you. I'm not joining forces with anyone. No, I'm not, Darling, you're on your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah, Mom, I'm with Alison. We stopped by to get a bite to eat. I'll tell her. Okay, bye-bye. Mom wants to apologize for having to go to the hospital and leaving you home alone.",
        "Alison: I don't care that she has to go to work.",
        "Emily: Yeah well, you know what? She cares. And I don't like lying to her, okay?",
        "Alison: Then why did you tell her we were getting a bite to eat when we're not. What? Not everything is my fault.",
        "Dusty: Would you cut your sister some slack?",
        "Alison: And will you crawl back into whatever B-movie you crawled out of.",
        "Dusty: You want to talk about movies, Jodi?",
        "Alison: Why am I your business? Or is this just some sort of weird foreplay. Maybe you got off on what you saw on the screen.",
        "Dusty: I really don't dig women with no self-respect.",
        "Alison: Good answer. Only I know men and I know it's a lie.",
        "Emily: Okay, you know what? That's enough out of you.",
        "Alison: Look, I can understand you, you're my sister. But him -- why is here? Why does he care?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause your sister and I are friends.",
        "Alison: Friends?",
        "Emily: Yes, Alison -- friends. Not everything is about sex.",
        "Alison: What's the matter, Dusty? Not getting any, huh? Still stuck on your dead wife?",
        "Dusty: You know? You're something else.",
        "Emily: You had to know that I would be upset when I went home and you weren't there.",
        "Alison: Look, I'll keep you posted next time.",
        "Emily: No, you will pick up your phone when I call you, okay? I called you like 20 times.",
        "Alison: Sorry. It didn't ring. It didn't! My service is from Vegas. I haven't even been getting phone messages.",
        "Emily: Okay fine, then I'll put you on my service.",
        "Alison: You don't have to do that --",
        "Dusty: Are you going to pick up the phone when your sister calls?",
        "Emily: And when you were on your walk, did you happen to find a job?",
        "Alison: It's been like a couple hours.",
        "Dusty: That's a no.",
        "Alison: I looked, I didn't see anything.",
        "Dusty: There's a sign right there.",
        "Alison: Al's?",
        "Emily: Help wanted. Waitresses wanted. Perfect.",
        "Alison: No, I will not go back to waitressing at Al's. It's bad enough that you dragged me back to Oakdale.",
        "Dusty: You've worked at Al's before?",
        "Alison: Yeah, in high school -- it was a nightmare.",
        "Dusty: Porn is a nightmare. Drugs are a nightmare. Serving hometown folks good food, that's a good job.",
        "Emily: Yeah, and you're taking it.",
        "Alison: Look, I'll get a job, just not this one.",
        "Dusty: No, you had a chance to find something you wanted. Now you're gonna take what's available.",
        "Alison: You won't even let me look?",
        "Emily: Sure, you can look all you'd like -- while you're working here, okay? It's a good job and you know how to do it. You're taking it.",
        "[Alison remembering]",
        "Alison: I'm good for the money. Really. My mom's a doctor here in town, I could easily --",
        "Jesse: Forget it. Forget it. No cash, no candy. No excuses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Do you want me to go in with you? Talk to the manager --",
        "Alison: No, I've got it. You're right, Em, I need the money.",
        "Dusty: I know it's hard.",
        "Emily: Yeah, right. You're the one who's always calling me a hypocrite. I never felt more like one than I do right now.",
        "Dusty: Come on. You pulled yourself out of a bad situation. And now you're helping your sister get straight. I think you're doing great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cleo: And she bowls! That's a strike ladies and gentleman!",
        "Jade: Would you give it a rest?",
        "Cleo: Why? I'm happy! I fooled that Elwood kid.",
        "Jade: Yeah, for about two seconds. And then when he realized Gwen was wearing a different shirt, he was all, \"When did you change, why are you trying to pull one over on me, why is everybody messing with my head?\"",
        "Cleo: Which proves that it worked perfectly! Because he wasn't going off about how he ran into somebody who looked like Gwen, he really thought I was her.",
        "Jade: Until I met you, I didn't think it was possible for a human being to be too optimistic.",
        "Cleo: Well, I think that you need to be more optimistic.",
        "Jade: Well, I think you need to do what you're told, Cleo. No more roaming around Oakdale. If you would've run into Will instead of Elwood, you would have been headed straight back to Turlock.",
        "Cleo: I would've fooled him, too.",
        "Jade: Oh, you think so, do you?",
        "Cleo: Yep, I know so.",
        "Jade: Let me get one thing straight with you. If this plan has any prayer of working, you're gonna do ex -- you're gonna -- you're gonna do exactly what I tell you.",
        "Cleo: And how many times do I have to tell you that you need to tell me exactly what your plan is.",
        "Jade: Let's just say it's a little more involved than bumping into Will.",
        "Cleo: Okay, listen Jade, I've done everything that you've asked me to do. I studied your stupid pictures and your stupid notes. I've changed my voice, the way that I stand, my clothes, the way I walk. I think I deserve to know what I'm doing here.",
        "Jade: Okay, it's really simple. We're gonna break up Gwen and Will for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Okay, look! Do you want reasons to work with me on this? I have a window into Craig that nobody else has.",
        "Lucinda: And why is that?",
        "Meg: Because he has feelings for me. He let me see a side of him that nobody else has.",
        "Lucinda: And you're going to appeal to his better side?",
        "Meg: I already have. And now I intend to use that against him.",
        "Lucinda: And Paul?",
        "Meg: Will protect me. He can sense when I'm in trouble.",
        "Lucinda: Right, he's got those visions. Yeah, get him a turban, deck of cards -- he'll take care of you all right.",
        "Meg: You know, I know what this is -- this is you, insisting on going at it alone -- as usual.",
        "Lucinda: Hey wait, all right. All right! I'll tell you what you can do. You can poison the bastard.",
        "Meg: You want me to poison Craig?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, who better? Who better -- you're a nurse. You have a knowledge of pharmaceuticals --",
        "Meg: I would never use that knowledge to hurt someone -- not even Craig!",
        "Lucinda: Then what are we doing here? I thought the whole point was we were going to hurt the man.",
        "Meg: The point is to get your company back. And teach Craig that --",
        "Lucinda: I am not a teacher! I would, however, rather like to have my company back and if Craig were out of the way --",
        "Meg: Lucinda, come on, you can't be serious. I can't poison him -- that's murder.",
        "Lucinda: You don't have to kill him, just incapacitate him. Come on, it should be easy. A little mild liver disease.",
        "Meg: There's no such thing.",
        "Lucinda: All right well, then something else! How about a stroke? A mild stroke? He could linger for one or two years then somebody would put him out of his mercy with a pillow over his face.",
        "Meg: Okay, stop, stop stop! Okay, nobody's going to be killing or maiming or poisoning anybody.",
        "Lucinda: Then you're of no use to me.",
        "Meg: Look, there's gotta be another way.",
        "Lucinda: Well, good luck. Hope you find it.",
        "Meg: Look, won't you at least consider working with us? Just think about it.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I'll think about it. If you, you promise me you'll think about poisoning him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Whoa, whoa, what is this? You're upset?",
        "Cleo: No, I can't do this!",
        "Jade: You just said you could fool Will.",
        "Cleo: That was before I knew why.",
        "Jade: Cleo, people break up all the time. Besides, why did you think you were here?",

        "Jade: Yeah, and then you realized I couldn't stand her. So at that point, you had to have realized, that whatever I was planning was to get her back, which she totally deserves.",
        "Cleo: No, no, I can't just to take Gwen away from Will. It just seems so wrong.",
        "Jade: Cleo, you told me that the only problem you had was breaking the law. And we're not. You made me swear that what we were doing was legal. And it is. So, now what?",

        "Jade: Yeah, but you don't have to worry about that.",

        "Gwen: This isn't exactly a happy occasion, I mean, he's going to prison.",
        "Will: Yeah, well this will take his mind off things for a little while. Show him that we love him and that we're always gonna be here for him. It's only six months.",
        "Gwen: A lot can happen in six months.",
        "Will: Whatever happens, we're gonna be here for him. This is just a little life detour.",
        "Gwen: You're a good friend. You know that?",
        "Will: He would do the same thing me. He's my best friend. We gotta show him that it's gonna be okay.",
        "Gwen: All right, so I don't know, we'll take the stuff over to his house tomorrow?",
        "Will: Yep, and we'll just party until he kicks us out.",

        "Susan: But that's great. You'll have spending money while you figure out what you want to do. And it means you're sticking around, that makes me so happy.",
        "Alison: For awhile.",
        "Susan: It's so good to have her back home. And the next time you guys decide to go out, give me a call, I might want to join you.",

        "Emily: Follow the rules and things will change. Number one, when you're finished with work, you need to come straight home. No more going out with your friends and meeting up with them -- the ones from Oakdale Latin.",
        "Alison: I just ran into them. I was at Al's talking to Will and they just showed up.",
        "Emily: Okay number two, I'm going to need to see all the money you make. All of it. And I'll be checking your purse, your pockets and your room at least once a day.",
        "Alison: I'm not your prisoner, Emily, and I won't be treated like one.",
        "Emily: Possession of drugs is a felony, Alison, you could've ended up in prison.",
        "Alison: Well, since I don't have any drugs in my purse, I guess I'm home free.",
        "Emily: Alison, you walk out that door, I promise you, I will call Mom, and I will tell her everything.",

        "Meg: I miss you, too. But something's happened.",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm fine. I just need to see you.",
        "Meg: I'm being serious. She wanted me to poison him.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well Lucinda\ufffds angry. And I don't blame her. Craig humiliated her. Went after her family, went after her business. Of course she's out for blood.",
        "Meg: Obviously, I said no.",
        "Paul: Great.",
        "Meg: You mean that?",
        "Paul: Yeah, of course I do. Why?",
        "Meg: Well for starters, you did try and kill him yourself.",
        "Paul: Well, that was a long time ago. I'm a kinder, gentler Paul now.",
        "Meg: Come on. I'm being serious.",
        "Paul: So am I. Meg, I see these pictures in my head and then a few weeks later, they happen in real life. It makes you think that maybe there is some kind of master plan and we're just trying to keep up. So I've given up trying to play God cause apparently somebody else has the job. Besides, the last time I tried to force the issue and make something happen, I almost lost you. And now I'm not going to do anything to ever jeopardize your faith in me again.",
        "Meg: You have changed. However, Lucinda, is having a little trouble believing that.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well -- wait, you tried to convince Lucinda that I was a new man.",
        "Meg: Yeah, why not? You are.",
        "Paul: She's never gonna buy that. She hates me as much as she hates Craig.",
        "Meg: Yeah, she made that clear.",
        "Paul: Well, it doesn't matter. Figure out a way without her.",
        "Meg: When it happened, when I broke it off with you, you blamed Craig. And now you're blaming yourself.",
        "Paul: Well, it was all my fault. Nobody has the right to take somebody's life, no matter how depraved that person is. His business, maybe -- his girlfriend, definitely. His life? No.",
        "Meg: What is it?",
        "Paul: Right there. That's where Craig ran Rosanna right off the road. Ran her off the road, put her in a coma, and stole her life. You know, I have trouble picturing her. I do, I have these photographs, and I can dig them out, but I forget. And then I see that spot back there, or I run into somebody, reminds me of her, hear a voice I think is familiar.",
        "Meg: That must kill you.",
        "Paul: It would if I felt guilty. You know, maybe we won't poison Craig, but there is another way to break him.",
        "Meg: What do you mean, break him?",
        "Paul: Well, not hurt Craig physically.",
        "Meg: Okay, then how?",
        "Paul: You know what? This is just the beginning of an idea. So maybe we shouldn't talk about it. Besides, I'm gonna need some help on this one. I'm not so sure that the person that I'm thinking of is going to be willing to cooperate.",
        "Meg: Paul, I don't think we should bring anybody else into this. It's a risk.",
        "Paul: Yeah, no more of a risk than having you go after Craig by yourself. Just give me a little time to try and figure this one out, okay?",
        "Meg: Well, can you give me a hint?",
        "Paul: Okay, what if Craig were to come face to face with his past.",

        "Alison: You're bluffing. You wouldn't call her. You know it would hurt her feelings.",

        "Alison: Do what I say or I'm gonna tell Mom you were doing porn? What do you call that?",
        "Emily: I call it trying to give you a second chance. I know you thought you had things handled in Vegas, Honey, but you didn\ufffdt. You were selling yourself. And I know it bothers you. I know it did because you were taking drugs!",
        "Alison: That's not why I did drugs. I wasn't trying to forget some terrible life, I was trying to have a little fun. Like going out for a drink. Or going to a party. It made me feel good. If you haven't tried it, you shouldn't knock it.",
        "Emily: Do you even -- do you hear yourself? What you're doing Honey -- you don't feel it now. You're hurting yourself. You're breaking your spirit, and I don't want that to happen to you.",
        "Alison: What did I do that was such a crime? I went for a walk. I talked to some friends. I didn't do drugs! I didn't take off my clothes on the middle of Main Street, but all you care about is that I broke a rule. So you know what? Forget it. I don't care. Call Mom, call Dusty, do what you want. I'm going back to Vegas. Get out of my way.",
        "Emily: You want to go to Vegas? Go.",
        "Alison: I need to get my clothes.",
        "Emily: No, you don\ufffdt. I've seen your films. You need a little eyeliner, a buzz -- that's it.",
        "Alison: Funny.",
        "Emily: I'm serious. You want to go to Vegas, Ali? Go. Give me your clothes.",
        "Alison: I'm not going to take my clothes off.",
        "Emily: Why not? You're a porn star, right? So it shouldn't bother you to walk down the street naked.",
        "Alison: It's cold outside.",
        "Emily: Yeah, it's cold. It's very cold. And it's very lonely out there. But I'm sure you'll meet some friends. Or at the very least, you'll meet some people who are willing to use you.",

        "Emily: Letting one guy after another take turns with your body -- that's professional to you?",
        "Alison: How many men have you had? And how many of them have you loved? Sex is just sex. So I get paid for it. So what?",
        "Emily: So what? So, you wanna go to Vegas? Take off your clothes.",
        "Alison: I'm not gonna take off my clothes.",
        "Emily: Why not? You just got done saying it was no big deal.",
        "Alison: It's a job. I get paid to do whatever the scene requires.",
