        "Craig: Johnny, you are a regular Picasso. He was a very famous painter. And you will be, too, if you keep this up. Would you like to show this to Lucy? I thought you'd like to hang out with your big sister. Come on. Hey, Lucy! We were just talking about you.",
        "Lucy: I didn't see you guys there. Hey, Johnny. Hey, how you doing, Sweetie? Did you just pick him up from school?",
        "Craig: I did. And I can tell you he's gonna get an \"A\" in art.",
        "Lucy: Oh, wow! You did this? Good job, man.",
        "Craig: Hey, listen, I have to take care of some business today. Would you mind taking Johnny this afternoon?",
        "Lucy: Oh, God. I would if I could, but I'm so sorry. Johnny, I'm so sorry. I can't. I'll see you later, okay? Okay, bye.",
        "Craig: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hello, Jack.",
        "Jack: Hi.",
        "Carly: Come in.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Is Craig here?",
        "Carly: No. He won't be hanging out here anymore.",
        "Jack: Really?",
        "Carly: Really.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry I was so rough on you about the drinking.",
        "Carly: I deserved it. After that, I told Craig that our relationship was over -- personally and professionally.",
        "Jack: Seriously? No more vodka business?",
        "Carly: I won't be making it or drinking it and certainly not with him.",
        "Jack: I'd like to believe that.",
        "Carly: You were right, Jack. I need to focus on Parker.",
        "Jack: We both do. Parker's gonna need us more than ever now that Janet's hired a lawyer.",
        "Carly: When did she do that?",
        "Jack: She figured the sooner Liberty gets an annulment, the better. That's a good thing, right?",
        "Carly: Yes. Maybe not for Parker. It'll break his heart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Well, I would like to have this settled as soon as possible. Please keep me posted. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
        "Liberty: Who was that, Mom?",
        "Janet: That was your lawyer. He is drawing up annulment papers for you to sign, and then he's gonna give them to the judge.",
        "Liberty: Won't Parker have to sign the papers, too?",
        "Janet: Don't you worry about that.",
        "Liberty: Are you kidding? Mom, all I can think about is what Parker's gonna say when he finds out. Because I haven't talked to him yet about making this official.",
        "Janet: Let his parents tell him.",
        "Liberty: Mom, don't you get this? When I moved out, Parker drank so much he ended up in the hospital. I mean, what if he tries something worse?",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, Jack and Carly will take care of him, okay? That is not your job anymore.",
        "Liberty: So I'm just supposed to turn my back and just ruin his life?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: What's with you two? Shouldn't you guys be yelling and fighting?",
        "Carly: Well, I told you that there are gonna be some changes around here. Your father and I are gonna stop fighting and start focusing on important things. Things such as you.",
        "Parker: Lucky me.",
        "Jack: We're gonna do what families are supposed to do, Parker -- pull together when things get tough.",
        "Parker: Oh, brother.",
        "Jack: Excuse me?",
        "Parker: It was dumb of me, stealing that vodka. I know.",
        "Carly: You could have died, Honey.",
        "Parker: I know, and I'm sorry that I freaked everyone out.",
        "Carly: I don't want to hear your apologies, okay? What I want is to know that you've learned from your mistakes.",
        "Parker: And the biggest mistake I made was trying to tell Liberty what to do all the time. But -- but I'm through with that now. I'm gonna make a promise to her that I will never tell her what to do again and I'm never gonna run her life. When she moves back in, she's gonna see just how different things can be.",
        "Jack: That isn't gonna happen. They've contacted a lawyer about getting an annulment.",
        "Parker: An annulment? But I haven't even talked to her.",
        "Carly: Sweetie, it's what she wants. And talking isn't gonna change that.",
        "Parker: No, I won't let that happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Dusty, oh, my God. What happened to you?!",
        "Dusty: Nothing. Had a run-in with Fredo on the docks the other day.",
        "Lucy: Oh, my God. I should never have let you go down there.",
        "Dusty: It's no big deal.",
        "Lucy: It is a big deal! It's horrible! I'm so sorry.",
        "Dusty: There's nothing to be sorry about. You're out of the smuggling business, right?",
        "Lucy: You know what? I should let you rest. I'm just gonna go, and I'll just call you back later.",
        "Dusty: I'm fine. What about you? What's going on, Lucy?",
        "Lucy: It's okay. I mean, I can handle it.",
        "Dusty: Handle what? Another shipment? You promised me you'd find another way to help out your refugee friends.",
        "Lucy: I have. I will. But I--",
        "Dusty: But what? Tell me.",
        "Lucy: Cesar called. There's something going down at the docks.",
        "Dusty: It's not your problem anymore. Walk away.",
        "Lucy: I can't do that yet. But don't worry about it. I can handle it.",
        "Dusty: No, you can't. You're gonna get yourself killed. I won't let that happen.",
        "Lucy: This is not up for discussion, Dusty. I can't let you get involved again.",
        "Dusty: You're not getting involved again.",
        "Lucy: I feel guilty enough about what Fredo did to you last time. You can't go down there again.",
        "Dusty: Relax. Have a drink. Don't worry about what's going on down at the docks.",
        "Lucy: I wish I could. But I'm worried about Cesar. He's been so good to me. If he's in trouble, I can't just throw him to the wolves.",
        "Dusty: He's a big boy. He can fend for himself.",
        "Lucy: If I don't at least try to help him, I won't be able to live with myself.",
        "Dusty: All right, then I'm going, too.",
        "Lucy: What if Fredo shows up?",
        "Dusty: Don't worry about Fredo. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: No, no, it's all right. It's -- its late notice. I'll call you next time. Thank you. Well, no sitters today. Guess it's just you and me, kid. Hey! That's Daddy with the phone. That's very good. You know, that gives me an idea. Why don't you draw a picture of Carly, and we'll go see her with a box of chocolates and some flowers. I'll bet she'll be so happy to see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You said you wanted to start over with Liberty. An annulment might give you a chance to do that.",
        "Parker: But we're married. It's not like we can just pretend that it never happened!",
        "Jack: I know how much this hurts. But it's best if you make a clean break.",
        "Parker: We have to talk, because we can still fix this.",
        "Jack: There won't be any fixing of any kind. Liberty doesn't want to be married anymore. You have to accept that.",
        "Parker: Just because you say so? That's crazy!",
        "Jack: It's not about me saying so. Liberty says so.",
        "Carly: Sweetheart, the longer this drags on, the more it's gonna hurt when it's over.",
        "Parker: How can it just be over? I don't buy that.",
        "Carly: It j-- it just didn't work out. It's not your fault. It's not her fault. It just happened. It happens when -- when you try to tackle things when you're so young.",
        "Jack: Your mother's right, Parker.",
        "Parker: So what's your excuse? You were old enough to get married. But you couldn't stick it out. So why should I take advice from you?",
        "Jack: This isn't about your mother and me.",
        "Parker: You two have been married so many times that I've lost count. And every time has been a total disaster. That's why I don't want to be like you. I want my marriage to last.",
        "Jack: And Liberty wants an annulment, Parker.",
        "Parker: That's because you and Janet have her brainwashed.",
        "Jack: No, she came to us, Parker. She didn't want to hurt you, but she decided that she couldn't live here. She decided that.",
        "Parker: We can still work things out and get back together. But that's never gonna happen if you guys won't even let me talk to her!",
        "Carly: You know, Jack, maybe -- maybe it would be helpful if Parker talked to her, you know, before this goes any further.",
        "Jack: All right. I'll drive you over to the farm.",
        "Parker: Great.",
        "Jack: But you have to prepare yourself. Liberty is not gonna change her mind. She's going through with the annulment.",
        "Parker: You don't know her like I do. I'll change her mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: I can't eat, Mom.",
        "Janet: You can't starve yourself.",
        "Liberty: I feel like such a creep. Mom, how could I dump Parker? He really needs me.",
        "Janet: Honey, Parker needs a lot of things. He needs to learn to control his temper. He needs to learn to believe in himself. But only he can do that. You can't do that for him anymore.",
        "Liberty: Mom, I'm still his wife.",
        "Janet: Honey, you're still a kid! And so is he! I can't believe that judge allowed you two to get married at your age.",
        "Liberty: Well, you know what? He did. And we took those vows.",
        "Janet: Because Parker insisted. But no matter what he says, he wasn't ready, and neither were you.",
        "Liberty: I know, but, Mom, what about you and Dad? I mean, you said that you really wish you'd married him when you got pregnant, and you were only 17.",
        "Janet: It would've been a mistake. It never would have lasted.",
        "Liberty: But you don't know that!",
        "Janet: Honey, this is what I know. I know that you are so much smarter than I was at your age. You realized that marrying Parker was a mistake, and you came home. And I am so proud of you. You did the right thing, Sweetheart.",
        "Liberty: It just doesn't feel right, Mom. I think I maybe overreacted.",
        "Janet: You are not overreacting, okay? Don't say that. You stick to your guns. Everything is gonna be okay. Hi. I thought we agreed that they weren't --",
        "Parker: I need to speak to Liberty.",
        "Jack: They got to talk sometime.",
        "Janet: I think it's a mistake.",
        "Liberty: Mom, Parker's right. We need to do this. Come on, Parker, let's go outside.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cesar: You were supposed to come alone.",
        "Lucy: Dusty knows everything. I trust him.",
        "Dusty: What's the problem?",
        "Lucy: This is the last shipment. It was supposed to go out today.",
        "Cesar: It got delayed.",
        "Lucy: Why?",
        "Dusty: [Whistles] I thought you were just shipping drugs.",
        "Lucy: [Gasps] Oh, my God!",
        "Dusty: Guns, too, huh?",
        "Lucy: I have no idea how these guns got in there. Did you do this?",
        "Cesar: No way!",
        "Dusty: Gun smuggling, huh?",
        "Lucy: Dusty, I swear, all I was trying to do was ship medicine. I was trying to save people, not help them kill each other!",
        "Dusty: If this traces back to you, you're in big trouble.",
        "Lucy: But I had nothing to do with it.",
        "Dusty: Who put these guns here?",
        "Cesar: I'll bet it was Fredo.",
        "Dusty: To get the cash he was trying to extort from you?",
        "Lucy: The doctors in those camps are desperate for those drugs. People will die without them.",
        "Dusty: People are gonna die with these guns.",
        "Lucy: We can't let that happen. But how do we get rid of the guns and send the medical supplies without Fredo finding out?",
        "Dusty: Forget Fredo.",
        "Lucy: I can't! What if he comes after you again?",
        "Dusty: I hope he does. It would make my day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: You got pretty lousy timing, Jack.",
        "Jack: Parker feels he has the right to at least state his case. I couldn't deny him that much.",
        "Janet: I just got her to agree with me. She's vulnerable right now. She was gonna stick to her guns. If Parker makes her change her mind --",
        "Jack: I don't want to argue about this. I have to do what's right for my son. Parker is a full partner in this, whether we like it or not, and if the partnership's gonna end, he can't be totally cut out of the process.",
        "Janet: So what are we supposed to do, just stand by and let them ruin their lives?",
        "Jack: Okay, we agree that they're not mature enough to be married, but we can't treat them like babies, either. If they discuss this, if they really talk this through, then Parker will realize that the annulment is the right thing to do.",
        "Janet: What if he doesn't, and my daughter gives up her future?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Liberty, I'm sorry. I know I was a jerk. But I'm not gonna be jealous anymore. Y-you can get a summer job and go to any college you want. And I'm not gonna tell you what to do anymore.",
        "Liberty: You make it sound so easy, but it's not, Parker. I just -- I just want to be a normal teenager, you know? And I just -- I don't think we should be married anymore.",
        "Parker: Why not? I've practically taken care of myself my entire life. And now I can take care of you, and we can take care of each other. Come on, that's like a million times better than being alone.",
        "Liberty: Parker, you're not alone. You have your family.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Yeah, right. You know how messed up my parents are.",
        "Liberty: Okay, that doesn't mean that they were wrong about us being to young to be married, Parker. My -- my mom had a lot of problems when she was my age because she got pregnant. And she had to grow up too soon.",
        "Parker: I'm not saying we should have children. I know we're not ready for that.",
        "Liberty: No, but we're not ready to be married either.",
        "Parker: When I said those vows, I meant them. Didn't you?",
        "Liberty: I thought I did, but I-I don't know now.",
        "Parker: I know you love me.",
        "Liberty: It's more complicated than that.",
        "Parker: It doesn't have to be. Why can't what we have now last forever?",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry, Parker. But I just -- I don't -- I don't want to do anything forever right now, okay? And I'm sorry that your life got really messed up when your dad died and when Carly left Jack, but I can't make it better.",
        "Parker: You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.",
        "Liberty: You're such a great guy, Parker. You're such a great guy, but I really don't think we should be married anymore.",
        "Parker: No, don't say that.",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry. My mind's made up.",
        "Parker: You're not even giving us a chance.",
        "Liberty: I'm gonna sign the annulment, and I think you should, too.",
        "Parker: Forget it!",
        "Liberty: Parker, wait! Parker, wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We have to trust Liberty. If she's as mature and as smart as we think she is, then she'll do the right thing.",
        "Janet: If she was so mature and smart, she never would've gotten married in the first place. Honey, are you okay?",
        "Liberty: I'm fine.",
        "Jack: Where's Parker?",
        "Liberty: He left.",
        "Jack: Where'd he go?",
        "Liberty: I don't know.",
        "Janet: What happened?",
        "Liberty: I told him that I want the annulment. He didn't really take it very well.",
        "Janet: Oh, poor thing. Honey, I'm proud of you. You did the right thing.",
        "Jack: I'd better go find him.",
        "Janet: Good idea. Good idea. Just make sure he's okay.",
        "Liberty: Maybe I should go with you.",
        "Janet: No, no, no, no, no. You stay here. I think you and I need to go talk to your father. He deserves to know what's going on.",
        "Jack: Don't worry. Parker'll be fine.",
        "Janet: Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's really not a good time, okay?",
        "Craig: I've got someone with me who wants to see you. See, even drew your portrait. Awfully good likeness, don't you think?",
        "Carly: Johnny, it's beautiful. Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Craig: Aren't you going to invite us in?",
        "Carly: Come on in, Johnny.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Carly: Don't think you can't use that sweet little boy to worm your way back into my life.",
        "Craig: Is that what you think I'm doing? I'm shocked!",
        "Johnny: Aunt Carly, can I have a chocolate?",
        "Craig: Johnny, it's not polite to ask for a gift back. I'm sorry. He's been eyeing those chocolates all the way over here. You know what, Johnny? I think Carly's a little too busy, so why don't we get out of her way?",
        "Carly: No, you know what? That's okay. It's fine for you to have a chocolate.",
        "Craig: What do you say?",
        "Johnny: Thank you.",
        "Carly: You're welcome. Now, would you like a glass of milk to go with that?",
        "Johnny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: [Laughs] Why don't you go into the kitchen and pour him a glass of milk?",
        "Craig: Okay. Can I have a glass, too, Aunt Carly?",
        "Carly: Don't push it. I'm doing this for Johnny, not for you.",
        "Craig: I know. You're one tough cookie. Speaking of cookies --",
        "Carly: Yes, he may have one. They're in the cookie jar. None for you.",
        "Craig: Come on.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jack: Hey, is Parker here?",
        "Carly: No, I thought he was with you. How did it go with Liberty?",
        "Jack: Exactly the way I expected. She held firm on the annulment, and Parker flipped out.",
        "Craig: What's up with Parker?",
        "Jack: So much for changing your life and focusing on our son.",
        "Carly: Hey, don't you dare walk out on me! I did not invite Craig here.",
        "Craig: That's true.",
        "Carly: You shut up!",
        "Carly: He just showed up here with Johnny.",
        "Craig: He's in the kitchen.",
        "Carly: I didn't have the heart to slam the door in the face of that sweet little boy.",
        "Jack: I suppose that Johnny's the one who brought you the flowers and the chocolates.",
        "Carly: As a matter of fact, Jack, he did. And I told Craig he has no place in my life!",
        "Craig: And she means it, too. Did you see the way she just looked at me? That's scary. Oh, but you've been there, haven't you, Jack?",
        "Jack: If Carly gave you your walking papers, why the hell are you still here?",
        "Craig: I've just never been very good at taking no for an answer.",
        "Carly: Can we stop talking about Craig, please? I want to know what happened with Parker.",
        "Jack: I told you, Carly. Liberty tried to let him down easy, but Parker couldn't hear, so he took off.",
        "Carly: And you have no idea where he went?",
        "Jack: I thought he'd come home. Clearly, I was wrong.",
        "Craig: I could go look for him if you'd like.",
        "Jack: Do you have any idea how much he hates you right now? He wouldn't be in such a mess if you hadn't interfered to begin with.",
        "Craig: Really? So rather than them get an annulment, you'd rather that Parker and Liberty stay married and live happily ensconced in Parker's bedroom. You know, it's not like tough love is a stranger to this household, so why am I in the doghouse for delivering some of it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Liberty? Liberty, I'm sorry I left. Can you come downstairs? We can work this out. Liberty?! Are you here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Ringing]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Janet: No, let it go to voice mail. Voice --",
        "Liberty: Hello? Parker? Where are you?",
        "Parker: At the farm. Where are you?",
        "Liberty: I'm with my mom. We're on our way to Al's to meet my dad and tell him what's going on.",
        "Parker: Can you please come back here so maybe we can talk a little bit more?",
        "Liberty: I don't see what good it'll do.",
        "Parker: Please. Give us another shot.",
        "Liberty: Parker, it's not gonna happen.",
        "Parker: You're not even gonna try? If we both try --",
        "Janet: Parker, its Janet. You need to let this go. It's unhealthy.",
        "Parker: Put Liberty back on.",
        "Janet: No, Sweetheart. She has made up her mind. The best thing to do is get an annulment and forget this whole thing ever happened.",
        "Parker: I'm not gonna forget anything. I need to talk to Liberty.",
        "Janet: Parker, go home to your parents. They can help you.",
        "Parker: Yeah, right. Thanks for nothing!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why are you still here?",
        "Craig: Johnny's finishing his milk. Shouldn't you be out looking after your own son?",
        "Jack: I'm not taking orders from you, Craig. You're one of the reasons Parker and Liberty got married to begin with.",
        "Craig: Me?",
        "Jack: They thought they'd have it made because you'd be standing there with a blank check.",
        "Craig: I haven't done that, have I?",
        "Jack: And the fact remains that you're not the influence Parker needs in his life right now. You claim to be helping these kids, but all you're doing is sending mixed messages.",
        "Craig: How can you say that when Liberty never would've left Parker if it wasn't for me?",
        "Jack: Craig, you're a real hero.",
        "Craig: Well, I did save your son from dying of alcohol poisoning.",
        "Jack: And where did he get the vodka, exactly?",
        "Craig: He stole it.",
        "Jack: All I know is that you and your vodka have done more harm than good around here. You never should've gone into business with this guy. It was a bad move for you and the kids.",
        "Craig: You're confusing the issue, Jack.",
        "Jack: It all comes back to you, Craig. You made Parker think he could have whatever he wants. You gave him your car keys. You gave him money to go to the concert in Chicago. You lied for him when he stole the money out of Al's diner. No wonder he put you in charge of his trust fund.",
        "Craig: Can't say I've lived up to his expectations. What I have done, though, is prevent him from spending his money irresponsibly.",
        "Carly: That's true, Jack. Craig didn't let the kids get their own apartment.",
        "Jack: One decent decision doesn't erase everything else.",
        "Craig: You know what? Can we try and remember that I didn't ask to be Parker's trustee. He did that because he couldn't trust his own parents.",
        "Jack: You should have refused to be the trustee. But you couldn't. You couldn't resist playing surrogate daddy, could you? You couldn't resist the power trip. Taking matters into your own hands, manipulating the situation wherever you could.",
        "Carly: He was trying to do the right thing.",
        "Jack: Why are you defending him?!",
        "Carly: 'Cause, Jack, I think in this case he didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Jack: Okay, whatever. You guys are consenting adults. Do whatever you want. But I'm warning you one last time. Stay the hell away from my son. You messed up your own kids. I'll be damned if you're gonna mess up mine!",

        "Brad: It's been a rough day all-around, huh? You did the right thing, Honey.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, everybody keeps saying that. Why does being right feel just so wrong?",
        "Brad: Because you got a great heart, and you don't want to hurt anyone. You're like your mom that way. And that's a great way to be. You know, she raised you to care about other people's feelings, and that's important. It's also important to tell the truth. Even if it hurts like hell. And the truth is that this marriage was doomed from the get-go.",
        "Liberty: Oh, come on. You didn't want me to be with Parker even before we were married.",
        "Brad: It's not personal. I mean, he's a -- you know, he's a good kid. You know, he reminds me of myself at that age. And that's a problem.",
        "Liberty: [Chuckles]",
        "Brad: Now that the annulment is, you know, in the works, life can go back to normalcy. And you start going back to school. Be a kid again.",
        "Liberty: That's the plan.",
        "Brad: The only thing is you won't be living with me and Katie.",
        "Liberty: No, I'll be at the farm. It's fine.",
        "Brad: I mean, you know how much we love having you around, though. I mean, you do know that. If it weren't for this whole baby thing --",
        "Liberty: I know. It's fine. Vienna's staying with you guys. You can feel like you're part of the process. It's cool.",
        "Brad: Yeah, and, you know, if she gets a craving or something, Katie can, you know, can take care of her. That way Katie kind of feels like she's pregnant, too. Does that sound crazy?",
        "Liberty: No. No! God, not at all. I mean, you guys want to be there for every step and really make it feel real that you're bringing something into the world.",
        "Brad: You got it.",
        "Liberty: Hey, it's gonna be an exciting birthday coming up for you.",
        "Brad: Definitely. Definitely. Almost as exciting as the one I celebrated last week -- May 5th, to be exact.",
        "Liberty: Whose birthday's that?",
        "Brad: It was mine.",
        "Liberty: Sorry, but your birthday's not in May.",
        "Brad: No, it is now. It is now. May 5th last year, that's when I got the DNA results back, so that was the day that I was -- I was born as a father.",
        "Liberty: Dad!",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Brad: I mean, before that, I was a kid myself, you know? But then I found out that there was this incredibly smart, gorgeous, wild, unruly miracle walking around that I was a part of. And that was my chance -- my chance to grow up.",
        "Liberty: Uh, sorry. You're kind of never gonna grow up.",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: [Laughs]",
        "Brad: You have no idea what you've done for me. If I end up being a good father to this new baby, it's all because of you.",
        "Liberty: Dad, that is really such an awesome thing for you to say. Thank you.",
        "Brad: I've never been more serious in my life.",
        "Liberty: Oh, hey, Mom's waiting outside. She kind of just wanted us to bond, whatever.",
        "Brad: Okay. Well, all right, well -- you're my number one. You're my number one. I mean, there's no one, no matter how much I love it, could ever take your place. I am so proud of you. Every day.",

        "Craig: And you always listen to Jack.",
        "Carly: In this case, I think he's right. And he's Parker's father.",
        "Craig: He's Parker's adoptive father. But I'll respect that. What I don't respect is the way he treats you and the fact that you keep taking it.",
        "Carly: I didn't ask you for your opinion.",
        "Craig: Maybe you should. You should be sick and tired of the way that he judges you. You're never gonna live up to his impossible standards. And it's made your life and your children's lives hell.",
        "Carly: You need to go.",
