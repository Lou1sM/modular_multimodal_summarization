        "Emily: I know, it -- it was an insane idea.",
        "Hal: Whose insane idea?",
        "Emily: Craig's.",
        "[Hal sighs]",
        "Hal: I figured as much.",
        "Emily: It didn't seem that awful at first, really. I mean, we had no intention of hurting Barbara. We just wanted to put her on ice for a couple of days.",
        "Hal: You know, the law has a word for it. I think they call it \"kidnapping.\"",
        "Emily: Yeah, but even if you have a really, really good reason for it?",
        "Hal: This I gotta hear.",
        "Emily: We wanted to help Carly. That's all. She was having such a horrible time of it. You know that. She and Jack split up, and she's pregnant. And she's having a really hard time coming up with designs for Monte Carlo. And Barbara's prancing around Oakdale, rubbing her nose in it.",
        "Hal: There's no law against prancing.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, there oughta be a law against Barbara Ryan.",
        "Hal: I'm looking for a little remorse here, Emily.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm not sorry for what I did. All right? I'm just sorry we got caught.",
        "Hal: Define \"we.\"",
        "Emily: Me.",
        "Hal: You said \"we.\"",
        "Emily: No, I meant -- I meant me.",
        "Hal: Emily!",
        "Emily: What? I mean, I was thinking of Craig.",
        "Hal: I can see your wheels turning. Who else, Emily?",
        "Emily: Nobody.",
        "Hal: Emily, you and I both know Craig never gets his hands dirty. Who else helped you?",
        "Emily: Daniel. I think I hear Daniel. I think I'd better go --",
        "Hal: Emily -- I want names, and I want them now. Who helped you take Barbara, put her in a deserted cabin against her will?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: May I say, Ms. Ryan, that you are looking as stunning as ever? Especially considering that whole horrible ordeal. I read about it in the City Times. I'm sorry. Have I introduced myself?",
        "Barbara: I know who you are, Mr. Coleman.",
        "Henry: I'm flattered.",
        "Barbara: Don't be.",
        "Henry: What happened to you -- the only word for it is \"shameful.\" Do the police have any leads?",
        "Barbara: Funny, I was wondering the same thing.",
        "Henry: Funny as in \"ha, ha\"? Or funny as in odd?",
        "Barbara: Funny as in curious. But then, you're a curious man, aren't you, Henry Coleman?",
        "Henry: Yes. It's my Achilles heel. Okay, I don't wanna take up any more of your precious time.",
        "Barbara: Oh, please! Please, please. Join me. Another martini.",
        "Henry: Yes, well, I would love to, but it is my shift to volunteer at the homeless shelter or something.",
        "Barbara: Oh, but I have information about my abduction, things you won't read in the paper. It's only a matter of time until Rose D'Angelo and Emily Stewart are arrested for my kidnapping.",
        "Henry: Huh! I'm sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler for details. Isn't Emily Stewart also known as Mrs. Hal Munson, as in the Dick Tracy of Oakdale, Hal Munson?",
        "Barbara: As far as I'm concerned, there's only ever been one Mrs. Hal Munson.",
        "Henry: Right! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's so hard to keep track. Marriages come and go so quickly here --",
        "Barbara: Shut up, and I'll give you the inside scoop, okay? The police are looking for a third conspirator. A man.",
        "Henry: A man? You sure?",
        "Barbara: I don't think Hal's gonna have to look very far to find him, do you, Henry? Drink up.",
        "Henry: I would love to, but I volunteer at the shelter -- it's my turn to hand out the soup. So --",
        "Barbara: Let's say -- hypothetically, of course -- that you know more about my kidnapping. Perhaps we could make a deal that would be mutually beneficial.",
        "Henry: What sort of deal?",
        "Barbara: A deal with a bunch of zeros on the end. You tell me what I want to know, and I will be very, very good to you, Henry.",
        "Henry: What do you want to know?",
        "Barbara: What I want is for you to state, for the record, that Rose D'Angelo and Emily Stewart were behind my abduction. And then you will be protected.",
        "Henry: Just protected? Because I could have sworn I heard something about zeros.",
        "Barbara: You will be amply rewarded. And I will tell the police that you had a change of heart. You repented. Saw the error of your ways. Allowed me to escape. An act of mercy.",
        "Henry: \"Mercy\" is my middle name.",
        "Barbara: That's what I thought. Now, you listen to me. If you don't cooperate, I will be telling Hal that the man that I saw at the cabin looks an awful lot like Henry Coleman. Tall, pasty, weak chin.",
        "Henry: Weak chin?",
        "Barbara: And the police will be combing your apartment before you finish that drink. Now, are you sure you didn't leave any evidence lying around? A piece of lint, perhaps?",
        "Henry: Okay, okay, okay. It was Emily and Rose, all right? But -- but Craig was calling all the shots. We just did the legwork.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. Now, here's a suggestion. You get back to your apartment, you break out the vacuum cleaner, and you clean house. You got it? Just in case. I'll be in touch.",
        "Barbara: Paul? It's your mother. I'm in the lounge. You get down here. I need to speak to you. I have some rather disturbing news about Rose.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Will you stop grilling me? Why do I have to incriminate somebody else, anyway? You know, we took good care of Barbara. Brought her food. We checked on her every now and then.",
        "Hal: You held a woman against her will!",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, at least I didn't sic a mad scientist on her.",
        "Hal: Emily! I know you have every reason in the world to hate Barbara. But I can't help you if you don't tell me everything.",
        "Emily: I don't want your help, okay? I'll just accept my punishment.",
        "Hal: And I should accept it, too? And Daniel and Will? You have a family. You can't just go running off and pulling crazy stunts without knowing that it's gonna hit home.",
        "Emily: I know. I have a family.",
        "Hal: Did we come into your mind when you were hatching this plot with Craig?",
        "Emily: Yes! Of course.",
        "Hal: Well, it didn't seem to make you put the brakes on.",
        "Emily: You know what? If I wanted guilt, I would've gone to my mother.",
        "Hal: You didn't have to lie to me, Emily.",
        "Emily: Yes, I did. I did. Don't you see? Once things got rolling so fast, I couldn't stop. And I didn't want to lie to you, I swear. At the wedding, when you noticed my watch, I wanted to drag you off so bad and tell you the truth.",
        "Hal: Why didn't you?",
        "Emily: Because I knew we'd end up right where we are right now.",
        "Hal: And this is exactly where we're gonna stay until I get names.",
        "Emily: Fine, you want names, huh? You want to play bad cop, tough guy? Fine. Break me. I hate it when you play this chief of detectives garbage on me. I want to slug you half the time. [Hal sighs] oh.",
        "[Emily sobbing]",
        "Emily: It was me and Rose.",
        "Hal: Surprise, surprise.",
        "Emily: And Henry Coleman.",
        "Hal: Henry Coleman?",
        "Emily: We were afraid we wouldn't be able to handle Barbara on our own, so --",
        "Hal: So you got into bed with Henry Coleman?",
        "Emily: Didn't you ever, ever make all the wrong choices for all the right reasons?",
        "Hal: Oh, Em --",
        "Emily: It's not like we asked for ransom or anything or kept her buried in a vault.",
        "Hal: Don't put lipstick on this pig. It's called kidnapping. And Jack already knows!",
        "Emily: Yeah, but just about me.",
        "Hal: He gave me the receipts so I could handle it myself. Handle it? 25 years -- that's what you're looking at, Emily. 25 -- how do I live without you for 25 years? Tell me how I do that.",
        "[Emily sobbing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: You think I have with my sister?",
        "Jack: Carly's not your problem.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I see. What about the fact that she's constantly drawing my husband into the tornado she calls a life?",
        "Carly: Now, wait a second. I don't draw Craig into anything.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes, that's right. He readily volunteers. Craig is a suspect in Barbara's kidnapping, right? You're looking for a motive? Why don't you look no further than your wife? Because she is the reason for everything that Craig does. So, yes, I told her that if this marriage is over before it began, then I'm going to seek my revenge where I can find it. And, yes, that is a threat. So if you want to arrest me, you go right ahead, because I mean every single word of it! And if you don't, I will be upstairs if you change your mind, and you want to read me my rights. So I'll just let the two of you figure things out, and you can leave on your own. And I hope it will be soon, because I have a splitting headache!",
        "Carly: Oh, gosh, don't - I'm ready! - I don't think so, honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Got here as fast as I could. What's this about Rose?",
        "Barbara: Sit down, darling.",
        "Paul: I'm serious, mom. What's going on? I want answers.",
        "Barbara: I want answers, too. I want to know why Carly is the toast of the company that I'm supposed to be designing for. I want to know why no one's been arrested for terrorizing me. I want to know what's happened to my work and how somebody could break into my suite and destroy it.",
        "Paul: I spoke to Jack earlier today, and he's working on the case.",
        "Barbara: Jack is still married to the slut who somehow came up with a fall line while I was held prisoner.",
        "Paul: Okay, what does any of this have to do with Rose?",
        "Barbara: I want you to take a look at these.",
        "Paul: Mom, I'm serious. What does this have to do with --",
        "Barbara: I want you to take a look at these. The preliminary sketches I did for Rosanna. That's all I have left to show any proof that I was working on a line.",
        "Paul: Mom, these are -- they're beautiful, mom.",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Paul: If it's any indication of the final product, it's -- it's incredible, really. I --",
        "Barbara: But Carly and her friends destroyed the final product. And they need to be punished for it. I mean, no matter who did it, it's wrong --",
        "Paul: Okay, you if start in on Rose, I am walking out of here.",
        "Barbara: I know things, Paul. I have details about when I was held prisoner. I have been able to put things together in my mind. And if somehow I am able to prove that Rose was involved --",
        "Paul: But you are not gonna be able to prove a damn thing, because she wasn't involved. Now let it go, mom.",
        "Barbara: Don't you think I wish I could do that? But I can't do that, Paul. She was involved.",
        "Paul: All right. I'm outta here.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. Listen to me. Listen to me. I have proof. I have an eyewitness. And he will swear that Rose was involved in my kidnapping.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna tell you exactly what I'm looking for.",
        "Rose: Just your basic centerfold, right?",
        "Dusty: No. Not even that. You know, just somebody who's honest. Somebody who's warm and funny and down-to-earth and -- she's just gotta have a big heart, you know, my disease.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: No receipt. No trail. No jail. It's perfect.",
        "Hal: I'm not destroying evidence.",
        "Carly: Well, then -- your wife goes to jail. Come on, Hal. Think about it. Emily's a mommy. And what about the kids? And what about Susan and Alison? Haven't they been through enough?",
        "Emily: And I'm the one who made the mistake, so I should pay the consequences. I will tell Jack everything and accept what happens.",
        "Hal: No. Not without a lawyer, you're not.",
        "Emily: Look, I never meant to hurt you or the kids or anyone. I promise. But if I lose you over Barbara Ryan -- it's really like some sick, cosmic joke they're playing on me.",
        "Hal: Stop. You are not going to lose me. Get that out of your head right now. All right. I'll talk to Jack myself first thing in the morning.",
        "Carly: Okay. I gotta go. I'll call you later. Now, you listen to Hal. Don't you be a martyr.",
        "Emily: I won't.",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack. It's me. I've got to talk to you right away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're gonna have to do a hell of a lot better than come up with some make-believe eyewitness.",
        "Barbara: The eyewitness is real. And he's telling the truth. And when the right people hear that truth, it will be revealed that Rose was a co- conspirator.",
        "Paul: That is impossible!",
        "Barbara: No, it's not. And what I want to know is, if the police find enough evidence to arrest Rose, will you stand by me?",
        "Paul: This is not a contest, mom. It is different. It's supposed to be different.",
        "Rose: Hey. I hope I'm not interrupting something.",
        "Barbara: Could we finish our conversation, please?",
        "Rose: Yeah. Go. Shoot.",
        "Barbara: How dare you come between me and my son when we were having a conversation after everything that you have put me through?",
        "Rose: Blow another tune, Barbara.",
        "Paul: All right. We were finished.",
        "Barbara: I need to know this -- that if what I am saying is the truth, I need to know that you will stand by me. I'm your mother. I raised you. I love you more than anything.",
        "Paul: It is not gonna play out the way you think. But if it does, okay, sure, I'll stand by you. All right?",
        "Barbara: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Okay. All right.",
        "Rose: Well, she certainly pulled out all the stops. What'd I miss?",
        "Paul: Nothing.",
        "Rose: Oh, no, no nothing. What's going on? What's got you all shook up?",
        "Paul: She tried to convince me that she has an eyewitness that will prove that you were involved in the kidnapping. I told her it was impossible, but --",
        "Rose: If it was possible, then you would stand by her.",
        "Paul: But it didn't happen, so it doesn't matter.",
        "Rose: It matters to me.",
        "Paul: Listen, I was just trying to get her off my back.",
        "Rose: I don't know what you were trying to do, but what you did do was sell me out. And I don't like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Dusty is in business with Rose. I want to make sure they're not going after her, as well.",
        "Molly: Oh, my God. I didn't even think about Rose.",
        "Katie: I'll keep your dinner warm.",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Katie: So, these guys were pretty scary, huh?",
        "Molly: Terrifying. Like I said to Mike, Katie, I didn't know where else to go.",
        "Katie: You knew exactly where to go, Molly. Straight into Mike's open arms.",
        "Molly: You know, Mike and I have history, Katie.",
        "Katie: Well, the thing about history is it's all about the past. That's an easy place to get stuck when you're trying to move on.",
        "Molly: Maybe I'm not the only one feeling threatened tonight.",
        "Katie: I'm not after Mike, if that's what you're getting at. I'm still married, and I miss my husband very much. But Mike is a friend of mine, and I don't like to see my friends get used.",
        "Molly: Nobody's using anybody here.",
        "Katie: Really? He's still totally into you, if you didn't notice.",
        "Molly: You guys have been talking about me?",
        "Katie: I told you. We're friends.",
        "Molly: Let me give you a little warning, Katie. I wouldn't let it get too far. I'd really hate to see you get your heart broken again so soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Molly, you gotta return my calls sometime. [Knock at door] just a minute! I'll try again later. Great. What do you want?",
        "Mike: Heard you had some company earlier today.",
        "Dusty: Is Molly with you?",
        "Mike: That's none of your business.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. She got the wrong idea. I had a couple business associates in from Chicago.",
        "Mike: Well, these associates think that Molly's your girlfriend. You know, they think you actually care about her, and they think they can get to you through her.",
        "Dusty: You've been watching too many gangster movies.",
        "Mike: Tell you what -- you tell your friends that you and Molly are finished. Because if they bother her one more time, I will come after you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Rose, the woman wears me down. You know how she gets. She gets on something, and she won't let it go. So, yeah, sometimes I take the easy way out, and I just tell her what she wants to hear. That's it!",
        "Rose: Is that what do you with me?",
        "Paul: No, never, because you don't ever wear me down. You just wear me out.",
        "Rose: Don't get all cute and sexy with me when I got a head full of steam.",
        "Paul: All right, listen to me. I waited for six months for you to come home to me. I waited another few months for us to get our feet back on the ground. And then, when we finally decide we want to get married again, it was you, wasn't it, yeah? It was you who told me that I needed to rekindle some sort of relationship with my mother, wasn't it?",
        "Rose: You're never gonna let me live that down, are you?",
        "Paul: Nope.",
        "Rose: All right. Then I need a promise from you. Now, it's gonna sound a lot like the promise your mom wanted, but it's a little different. 'Cause I am not her. I am the woman that's going to be your wife. So I have to know, if it came down to a fight between her and me, you would pick me, matter what.",
        "Paul: Of course. No matter what.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Rose: Sorry. Hello?",
        "Emily: Rose, it's me. Bad news.",
        "Rose: What a coincidence. Paul and I are just having a little bite to eat here at the Lakeview.",
        "Emily: We're totally busted. Hal knows everything. Jack has the receipt from the watch. And apparently I was IDd by some clerk at that jewelry store.",
        "Rose: Well, I'm sure you'll find another dress just like it.",
        "Emily: Hal's trying to find a way to help, but I don't know how. But I thought you should tell Paul yourself before he finds out from somebody else.",
        "Rose: You're right. Thanks for the heads-up.",
        "Paul: Everything okay?",
        "Rose: No. Everything's not okay. I gotta tell you something.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rose: And I'm just gonna say it and let the chips fall where they may.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. I'm glad I caught you.",
        "Jack: What are you doing down here, Carly?",
        "Carly: I hate the way we left things.",
        "Jack: That's a running theme with us.",
        "Carly: I'm really trying, Jack.",
        "Jack: Trying by using the information about the search warrant to help Craig?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Like I said, those guys were my business associates.",
        "Mike: What kind of guys push women around and threaten them?",
        "Dusty: I think she's being a little dramatic, don't you?",
        "Mike: Don't tell me about Molly. All right? Just stay away from her.",
        "Dusty: Look at you. Who's being the thug right now, huh?",
        "Mike: If anything happens to her, you had better pray that I don't find you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I know it's hard to believe, Molly, but some women don't just jump from one guy to the other. And even if I did want Mike, I wouldn't have to play games to get him to notice me.",
        "Molly: This is no game, Katie.",
        "Katie: Really? Did you forget the number to 911?",
        "Molly: You're funny. Don't get too comfortable. 'Cause with Mike, the beginnings are great. It's the end that'll kill you. Tell him I went home.",
        "Katie: Tell him yourself.",
        "Molly: You know what's really funny? It is. If you guys actually do fall for each other, when things go bad, you know who he'll come running to. Me. Later.",
        "Katie: I'm not falling in love with Mike. I'm not falling in love ever again, you witch!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack, please. Stop thinking like a cop and start thinking like a friend. Call Hal. Tell him you've thought it over, and you've decided that the clerk was wrong, that the woman who bought that watch was not Emily. He IDd the wrong woman.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: Please. Love him enough to allow him to break the rules. Just shut off your brain and open your heart. I know that heart, Jack. And I know it's capable of incredible, beautiful things. And I also know that I cannot make this decision for you. I know you'll do what's right, g-man. You always do.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Emily: Hello?",
        "Carly: Hey -- it's me. I think I just convinced Jack to bury the evidence.",
        "Emily: Oh, Carly!",
        "Carly: Just -- don't talk to Hal, okay? I think Jack's still trying to wrap his brain around this. Let Jack be the one to talk to Hal.",
        "Emily: Thank you, Carly. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. You saved my life.",
        "Carly: Hey. You saved mine. I'll talk to you later.",
        "Emily: Rose. Oh!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Telling you this is -- it's very hard. I've been wanting to tell you for a really long --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Paul: Okay, can you turn that damn thing off?",
        "Rose: As soon as I get this last -- hello?",
        "Emily: Rose, it's Emily. Did you tell Paul?",
        "Rose: I was about to, but I keep getting interrupted.",
        "Emily: Don't. We may be in the clear. But I won't know until the morning.",
        "Rose: Sure, I'll talk to Faith. Hey, honey. Yeah, aunt Rose loves you very much.",
        "Emily: All right, I'll let you know in the morning, when I have all the facts. Just sit tight.",
        "Rose: Yeah, yeah, uncle Paul's here, too. I will. Love you. Bye.",
        "Paul: Now, where were we?",
        "Rose: I was just gonna say that -- I can understand why someone would wanna take your ma and put her in that cabin. And take her designs.
