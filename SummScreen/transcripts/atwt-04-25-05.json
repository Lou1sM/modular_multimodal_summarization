        "On the plane home from Las Vegas, Jen tells Mike she cannot marry him ever, and she gives back his ring. Mike is determined not to let this drop, and he suggest they discuss it in the morning, but Jen tells a disbelieving Mike she will not be there because she is moving out and throwing herself back into her work. Katie desperately tries to find Henry to talk to him, and explain herself, but is having trouble locating him. Craig shows up and taunts where her heart truly lies. She is angered by Craig suggestions reminding him she went to Las Vegas to stop him, and even called Mike to warn him, but Craig suggests she went to be there to pick up the pieces of Mike's life if Jen left him, and when she supposedly called to warn Mike, she never ended up saying anything. Katie doesn't want to listen to him, but Craig subtly blackmails her suggesting if she doesn't speak glowingly about him at the custody hearing then he may let it slip to Mike that it was Katie who told him the truth, and then Mike would hate her. Later, when Mike arrives to talk to Katie, she tries to tell him of her role in his interrupted wedding, but she ends up not being able to, and just lends her support to Mike who is miserable at Jen leaving him. Jessica shows up at the Police Station informing a shocked Jack she will be defending Les. Jack tries to understand why, and assumes someone must be paying her a lot of money, but Jessica will not tell Jack any information other then she is just doing her job. Lily and Keith kiss at the hospital, but can't talk about what happened because Jack calls them to the Police Station. Keith, Lily, Jessica, Tom, Jack and Les are at the Station when the report comes back on Julia's cell phone. To everyone's amazement, Les' fingerprints are not on the phone, and it now looks like Les will not be charged with her murder based on the lack of fingerprints, and the way the evidence was discovered. Later at home, Carly is plagued with flashbacks of Les, and when Jack comes home and is forced to tell her about the lack of evidence on Julia's cell phone, Carly is petrified Les will get out and come after them all. Barbara seeks Paul out to inform her that Jen is back. Quickly she realizes he already knew. He relays what happened in Las Vegas, and immediately Barbara wants to run to Jen's side, but Paul tells her to leave her alone. Barbara doesn't want to hear any of it saying Jen needs her family's help, but Paul is angry at Barbara believing she started the ball rolling because when she ran to tell Hal, Craig overheard her. He wishes out loud that if he could help Jen, then he would wish her some other family's DNA. This statement angers Barbara and she leaves. Dusty is officially closing Street Jeans because Jen skipped town. Paul arrives and pleads with Dusty to reconsider, but to no avail. Jen shows up ready for work, and is shocked to find the office all boxed up. A furious Paul fills her in, and Jen asks to speak to Dusty alone. She pleads for a chance to make up for leaving, and promises she will work hard, but Dusty tells her to focus on the life growing in her, and that his decision is final, and it is best for business, and he leaves an overwhelmed Jen behind, who loses it later when Craig arrives taunting her further about his place in their child's life."

        "Mike: I hear babies love this stuff. Can't get enough of it.",
        "Jennifer: Well, the baby might like it, but this momma's not having any unless it comes with strawberry ice cream, chocolate syrup and a big old cherry.",
        "Mike: Well, I don't know if the airlines can oblige, but I'll see what I can do.",
        "Jennifer: I leave you at the altar and you're still taking care of me.",
        "Mike: What can I say? I'm your prince, right? I'd do anything to see you smile.",
        "Jennifer: Would you take this back?",
        "Mike: Anything but that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Henry? Henry, are you here? Henry, would you please pick up your phone? I know you're mad, but that is no reason to walk out on me. To walk on us. Listen, I just -- I want you to know that you are the only man I want to spend my life with. You're the only man that I love.",
        "Craig: Tell Mike Kasnoff I said hi.",
        "Katie: Craig!",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Katie: That was Henry's voicemail. What if your snide little comment ends up on his message?",
        "Craig: Well, I think Henry knows where your true affections lie.",
        "Katie: I love my husband.",
        "Craig: Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.",
        "Katie: You know what, Craig? I hope that Jennifer and Mike went through with their wedding. I hope they are on their honeymoon right now.",
        "Craig: Sure.",
        "Katie: I do. For one thing, it would wipe that self-satisfied smirk right off your face. And for another thing, if they are married, then Henry will know that I will never leave him for Mike.",
        "Craig: Because even though you would cheat on Henry, and Jennifer would cheat on Mike, Mike wouldn't cheat on Jennifer?",
        "Katie: You are making a difficult situation excruciating, you know that?",
        "Craig: Well, I know, but if you're really intent on showing the world that you love Henry and Henry alone, I have a solution for you.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Craig: Well, you go by Mike and Jennifer's cottage and you give them this expensive little trinket. Find out whether they really got married or not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I'll be right back, J.J. don't fall asleep! Oh!",
        "Carly: It's okay. It's okay. You will never have to see that man again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Les: Look, Jack, I've been wanting to talk -- I'm sorry about, you know, your wife got roughed up a little bit there, but I tripped, and next thing I know, she was on the floor and then I was on top of her --",
        "Jack: These tight enough for you?",
        "Les: Ah.",
        "Jack: Is that good? Is that what happened when you murdered Julia? You tripped and bashed her head in with her own phone?",
        "Les: Jack, I didn't -- I didn't kill Julia.",
        "Jack: You confessed it to J.J.",
        "Les: He's -- J.J., he's a kid. Whatever I said to him, he must've misunderstood. I didn't kill his mom. I wouldn't do something like that. Oh, what is it with this place? I get some kind of free legal aid or something, right?",
        "Jack: Well, that's still a no-show. It's a tough sell, trying to find someone desperate enough to defend someone like you.",
        "Jessica: Mr. Sweeny?",
        "Les: Yeah?",
        "Jessica: Jessica Griffin. I'm your attorney.",
        "Jack: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: That was a great kiss.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Keith: For me. How was it for you? I was completely out of line, huh? Lily, the kiss was out of line. You kind of caught me off guard there. I just kissed you and for a second, I thought you were kissing me back. Were you kissing me back? I'm going to be leaving.",
        "Lily: No, wait, wait, wait! Don't go. Don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You can't defend him, Jessica. You gotta get off this case.",
        "Jessica: Everyone has a right to counsel, Jack.",
        "Jack: Not your counsel. Is someone paying you to do this?",
        "Jessica: You need to get some objectivity.",
        "Jack: He attacked Carly. He pushed himself way into my house and he put his hands on my wife.",
        "Jessica: Jack --",
        "Jack: He put his hands on my wife. And if J.J. hadn't stopped him -- the kid had to use a baseball bat on his own father to keep him from killing Carly. Jessica, you can't help this guy.",
        "Jessica: So there are assault charges in addition to the murder charge?",
        "Jack: Why are you doing this? Why? You, of all people, know what it's like to be victimized in their own house. Who's paying you?",
        "Jessica: It's privileged. Shall we? Mr. Sweeny, I apologize for keeping you waiting.",
        "Les: It's okay. You're still my lawyer, right? For free?",
        "Jessica: That's correct. Jack, what evidence do you have against my client besides the circumstantial evidence?",
        "Jack: We found a phone on it in your client's room at a local halfway house.",
        "Jessica: A phone that was given to the police by the victim's brother?",
        "Les: Man, I knew it. I been tellin' everyone. I'm bein' framed here. Keith! Yeah, that makes perfect sense to me.",
        "Jessica: Why? Has he threatened you?",
        "Les: Yeah. He threatened me plenty -- just like this guy. But, well, Keith's had it in for me for years. He tried to keep Julia, his sister, from marrying me. But he didn't pull it off, and he's not gonna pull this off, either. I'll make sure he pays for this. Keith.",
        "Jessica: Mr. Sweeny, I would advise you not to make any threats.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder. Send them on over. The lab results are in. I'd be geared up to spend the rest of my life in a cage, Les. Because the evidence against you is about to be shifted from circumstantial to slam dunk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: \"Caught off guard.\" That's a good way to put it. I mean, here we are, we're having a very nice conversation, just, you know, maybe a hug or --",
        "Keith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: It's been an emotional day for everyone.",
        "Keith: Plus, I was stabbed. I -- might still be in shock. That's why I kissed you.",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Keith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: There's your excuse.",
        "Keith: Yeah, there it is.",
        "Lily: Where's mine? Because you were right. I did kiss you back.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Keith: Hello? Yeah. Okay, I'll be right there. That was Jack. I got to go down to the police station.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'll go with you. Um, unless you don't want me to go.",
        "Keith: No, I think that's a really good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: The only place I'm going is home to my husband.",
        "Craig: And what if Henry doesn't live there anymore?",
        "Katie: He'll be back. And then you can talk to him.",
        "Craig: About?",
        "Katie: The mess you made.",
        "Craig: I made?",
        "Katie: You were the one who slept with Jennifer and got her pregnant.",
        "Craig: Oh, I think she had something to do with that. And you were the one who told me how pregnant she was, thus confirming my daddyhood.",
        "Katie: You know I didn't do it deliberately. I made a mistake and you took advantage.",
        "Craig: You don't believe that. I don't believe that, and I don't think Henry's going to --",
        "Katie: All right, forget how you found out. All you have to do is tell Henry how I tried to stop you from stopping Mike and Jennifer from getting married. That that is the only reason I went to Vegas.",
        "Craig: The only reason you went to Vegas -- uninvited, I might add -- was to see me stop Mike and Jennifer's wedding.",
        "Katie: Stop saying that!",
        "Craig: Well, then, stop denying it. You were there so you could hold poor, devastated Mike Kasnoff's head against your heaving bosom. And if he had asked you to stay, you would still be there.",
        "Katie: Yeah -- okay. Then why did I try to stop you? Why, as soon as we landed, did I call Mike?",
        "Craig: Well, maybe you called, but you didn't say anything. You didn't leave a message. You didn't want them to get married.",
        "Katie: Yes, I did! And let me tell you something, if Mike Kasnoff walked through that door right now and told me that he and Jennifer did not go through with it, that he was a free man, I still would not want him.",
        "Craig: Well, if he found out that it was a slip of your tongue that brought me to Vegas, he wouldn't want you there ever, would he?",
        "Katie: You promised you would never tell anyone about that.",
        "Craig: Some things slip out.",
        "Katie: Are you blackmailing me?",
        "Craig: Sounds so sordid.",
        "Katie: All right, fine. What do I have to do for you to keep your mouth shut?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Please, Mike, take the ring.",
        "Mike: It's yours. Even if you don't want to get married right now, maybe in a couple of months, we can sit back down --",
        "Jennifer: In a couple of months, I'll still be pregnant and it'll still be Craig's. Take the ring.",
        "Mike: Now, look, you're getting upset. It's not good for you.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not good for you. Mike, I love you so much.",
        "Mike: So why are we having this discussion?",
        "Jennifer: Because loving you means wanting what's best for you, even if it's not me?",
        "Mike: So you're breaking up with me because you love me?",
        "Jennifer: Please, take the ring.",
        "Flight attendant: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for flying with us. And to those of you terminating your journey here, enjoy your stay in the Oakdale area.",
        "Mike: We'll talk about this more in the morning, after we get some rest.",
        "Jennifer: I won't be there in the morning.",
        "Mike: What do you mean?",
        "Jennifer: I'm not going to go home with you, Mike. I'll just, I'll get a cab from the airport.",
        "Mike: And go where?",
        "Jennifer: Back to work.",
        "Mike: Baby, it's the middle of the night.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I have to get started on my fashion line for next spring.",
        "Mike: So you're just gonna throw yourself in your job? When is that a solution to anything?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I have to start somewhere. I have to -- I have to build a new life. And I'm glad that my work will be waiting for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tracey: Everything's packed up, Mr. Donovan.",
        "Dusty: It looks good. The movers are coming in the morning?",
        "Tracey: Too bad this didn't work out.",
        "Dusty: I'm going to talk to sierra about, you know, getting you another job over at Worldwide, if you promise me you won't work for Montgomery over at Boulevard.",
        "Tracey: No, sir. I mean, yes, sir. I mean, thank you, sir.",
        "Dusty: You're welcome, sweetheart.",
        "Paul: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Dusty: I'm moving out.",
        "Paul: This is Jennifer's company. And my company. You can't just pull the plug without notifying us.",
        "Dusty: You're now notified.",
        "Paul: You couldn't give me a week? Give me a week, Dusty. Two weeks? Please.",
        "Dusty: For what? Is Jennifer going to grace us and come back?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Dusty: I can't believe she ran away. I would have gone to the mat with you guys to take down Montgomery.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Dusty, you know what she was up against.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Two official letters withdrawing Worldwide from this partnership. One for you, one for Jennifer. As of now, Street Jeans is officially out of business.",
        "Paul: The hell it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I'm going to have a messy custody case with Jennifer.",
        "Katie: Yeah, because you tried to blackmail her, too. You know, if you just would have played the nice guy for once, Craig, you could have kept your job at Street Jeans.",
        "Craig: If Jennifer had listened to me instead of being honest with Mike Kasnoff, you wouldn't have a chance of getting Mike back, which you now do, if you help me.",
        "Katie: What am I supposed to do?",
        "Craig: Now, I am only exercising my right to participate in the raising of my child. So, I need you to speak highly of me and my parenting skills.",
        "Katie: Or?",
        "Craig: Or I tell Mike that you put the kibosh on his happy-ever-after with Jennifer.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Craig: You don't want to go there.",
        "Katie: I am not going to let that sweet baby suffer, because you think you can threaten me.",
        "Craig: Oh, the baby is not going to suffer. And I can do more than threaten.",
        "Katie: You want to know what I would say in court? That my brother Craig is actually a sweet guy and great friend and a loving and encouraging and attentive father.",
        "Craig: I'm touched.",
        "Katie: Unless you cross him. And then he's grabby and pushy and downright heartless. And I think Jennifer's baby deserves better than that. Deserves better than you. So if you want to Mike to believe that I betrayed him, fine, go ahead.",
        "Craig: You'll never get him back.",
        "Katie: I don't care, Craig! I don't want him.",
        "Craig: You're bluffing.",
        "Katie: I think it's time for you to go home. I need to lock up and go home to my husband.",
        "Craig: Oh, hello, Mike.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. No, Mike, please, don't hit him. Don't hit him. You know him, he'll thrown you in jail. Please.",
        "Mike: You need to get out of here.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I know. But I'm guessing that this isn't your honeymoon. So --",
        "Katie: So just go home! Just go home, Craig!",
        "Craig: Yes, all right, I'm going. I'm going. Don't you have something to tell Mike?",
        "Katie: I'll tell him later.",
        "Craig: Better tell him now, lest you forget.",
        "Katie: It's nothing. I'll tell him later. Just go.",
        "Craig: Yeah. Mike, you still didn't say -- congratulations still in order?",
        "Mike: You think you accomplished something didn't you? Well, you didn't. Because married or not, Jennifer's never going to let you anywhere near her baby.",
        "Craig: Genius, it's our baby. The baby belongs to me, too. And if Jennifer forgets again, I am happy to remind her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're playing right into Craig's hands.",
        "Dusty: It's got nothing to do with Craig.",
        "Paul: Craig took my sister's designs, became her chief competitor and now you're going to take her company and just take it right off the map?",
        "Dusty: What company? Whose going to design now that Jenny's gone?",
        "Paul: Oh, Dusty, I'll find somebody.",
        "Dusty: Somebody? Worldwide didn't sign up for somebody! We had a partnership with your sister.",
        "Paul: Okay, that is a bunch of corporate crap. You don't even believe what you're saying.",
        "Dusty: Is that right?",
        "Paul: Yeah. You're just embarrassed because Jennifer leaving makes you look bad with the home office. And you're ticked off because Jennifer's talent was supposed to be your ticket to a free ride.",
        "Dusty: I was counting on being part of something special, because your sister is talented. Not just a little. Not a variation of your mother. Jennifer's got chops. And you let her throw it away, because you got scared, for her, perhaps. Regardless, she'll never know what this could have been. None of us will.",
        "Paul: Okay, if you really believe that, then just give us some time. All right? Keep the company going. Once Jennifer gets settled, we'll figure out --",
        "Dusty: Are you kidding me? Forget about it.",
        "Paul: What? Come on, you're not even going to hear me out?",
        "Dusty: I want to hear you out. It was tough enough saying no to your sister. Believe me, this business is dead.",
        "Jennifer: Hi, I'm back.",
        "Paul: Jennifer, what are you doing here?",
        "Jennifer: Ah, well, I work here. Or I used to. What's going on? Are we moving?",
        "Dusty: Closing.",
        "Jennifer: But I'm back.",
        "Dusty: Welcome back. You're fired.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: This is Detective Jack Snyder. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.",
        "Carly: Hi, honey, it's me. I'm just calling to make sure that everything's okay. You know, with Les, make sure that he's being locked away for good. Okay, um, well, then hurry home.",
        "Les: Counselor, how soon before I can get out of here?",
        "Jessica: If we can get rid of the murder charge, you can make bail tonight. If not, a little longer. Jack, where are those test results? I want my client arraigned and out of here.",
        "Jack: They'll be here any minute. And since they'll find your prints, get your affairs in order.",
        "Les: Look, I'm telling you the truth here. Keith planted the cell phone. It's the only it got there. And even if the do find my prints, all that only means is I touched the phone. Maybe after she died, maybe before she died, but it doesn't mean I killed her.",
        "Jessica: Mr. Sweeny, as your attorney, I'm advising you to shut up.",
        "Les: Okay. Oh, great, great, the guy that sets me up shows up here and he gets to stand there and watch while the dirty work puts me away. What -- can't you kick out of here?",
        "Lily: Jessica, you're defending this guy?",
        "Jessica: Yes, I am, and he's got a good point. What are you doing here?",
        "Cop #4: Detective. Here are those lab results you wanted.",
        "Tom: Ah, looks like I got here just in time.",
        "Les: Who's this guy?",
        "Jessica: It's the D.A. be quiet.",
        "Keith: What does it say, Jack?",
        "Tom: Jack?",
        "Jack: This can't be right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\"--",
        "Carly: What happened with Les?",
        "Jack: I said we'll talk about it later, okay?",
        "Carly: As in \"this is really bad news\" later?",
        "Katie: This entire thing is my fault. And if you have to hate me for the rest of my life, then that's exactly what I deserve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's got to be a mistake.",
        "Lily: What is it?",
        "Les: My prints aren't on it, that's what it is? Isn't that right, Mr. D.A.?",
        "Tom: Well, the lab ran tests for Mr. Sweeny's prints twice, Jack. So if the report says they're not there, they're not there. Without the conclusive evidence, you can't hold him on a murder charge.",
        "Les: Looks like I'm getting out of here sooner than later with J.J.",
        "Keith: That's not going to happen. We found my sister's phone with her blood all over it in Sweeny's halfway house. I mean, what more evidence do you want?",
        "Les: A lot more since you planted it there.",
        "Tom: Lily, were you with Mr. Morrissey when he found the phone?",
        "Lily: Yes. I was -- I mean, I was in the room. I didn't actually see Keith find it, but I know damn well he didn't bring it in with him, if that's what you're saying.",
        "Jessica: How do you know?",
        "Lily: Because I trust him.",
        "Jack: We have more evidence than just the phone, though. What about what he said to J.J., the threat he made?",
        "Tom: Well, that's not enough. What are you going to do, put the kid on the stand at his mother's murder trial to testify against his father?",
        "Les: Yeah, man, don't be cruel, Jack.",
        "Tom: Look, I'd like to hold this guy and throw the book at him. He had motive and opportunity.",
        "Jessica: But that's not enough for an arraignment on murder charges. So, can we get on with this?",
        "Tom: Right. Let's talk about the assault charges.",
        "Keith: Jack, once Sweeny's sprung, he's going to grab J.J. and he's going to split town. Now, I'm going to go to your house and get J.J. I'm going to take him back to Chicago.",
        "Lily: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, doesn't Les technically still have custody?",
        "Jack: Yeah, until his hearing, yeah. Which means the feds will be all over you within 24 hours for kidnapping.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Keith: I'm going to take that chance.",
        "Lily: What are you going to do? You going to run with that child the rest of his life? While the police and the feds are following you? They can't do that to him.",
        "Keith: Well, I'll have to risk it.",
        "Jack: Let me work on this. I won't stop until I get something strong enough to put him away.",
        "Keith: Well, in the meantime, what am I supposed to do?",
        "Jack: I don't know, go back to Chicago if you have to. I can look after J.J.",
        "Lily: Really, there's no reason for you to leave right now. Because if you stay, you can help Jack.",
        "Jack: Listen, whatever you decide to do, just let me know, okay?",
        "Jessica: Jack? I'm just doing my job.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well I intend to do mine. That means protecting my family. You got that? So if you manage to get your client out on bail, and he comes anywhere near my wife and kids, what happens next is on your head, Jessica.",
        "Les: I guess you're not going to get me to take the rap for this, after all, hey, Keith?",
        "Lily: All Keith is trying to do is stop you from hurting that little boy ever again.",
        "Les: Well, what's with you? After Julia was murdered, she was pointing a finger at Keith just like everybody. I think Keith was running all over town saying she was the murderer. So what happened? What, did he promise you he was going clear your name, that if you pinned the murder on me?",
        "Keith: Shut up, Sweeny!",
        "Les: Why, because it's the truth? Come on, these two used to hate each other. Now they're like a couple of crime-fighting buddies. I'll tell you what, you listen to me, this guy, he's snowing you. Yeah, that's right, he's snowing you. He's giving you all this garbage about how he was doing it all for the love of his nephew, that's all it is, a bunch of garbage. Now, I didn't kill Julia, please. But I bet you dollar to donuts, he did.",
        "Lily: That's it, we're going to get you back to the hospital.",
        "Keith: No, no, I'm fine.",
        "Les: Truth hurts.",
        "Keith: I've got to keep J.J. away from Sweeny.",
        "Lily: We'll find a way. We'll find a way to prove that he his guilty. We'll work together, okay? I will help you.",
        "Keith: No. No, that's not going to happen. >From now on, I gotta work alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: But you just said that you can't run this place without me.",
        "Dusty: That's why Street Jeans is finished.",
        "Jennifer: Look, I was gone a couple of hours. And now I'm here to stay. So let's just cancel this wake, unpack this stuff and let me get back to work.",
        "Paul: Jennifer, wait a second. What happened to you and Mike getting married and going someplace else?",
        "Jennifer: Craig showed up.",
        "Paul: How did he find out where you were?",
        "Jennifer: I don't know.",
        "Paul: Did he stop the wedding?",
        "Jennifer: No, I did. Mike and I -- I broke things off. Of course, I thought that I could come back here and concentrate on my work. I didn't realize that forces other than Craig were working against me.",
        "Dusty: It's not personal, Jen.",
        "Paul: Oh, no, no, no, it is personal, Dusty! You could turn this all around with one phone call, but he won't do it.",
        "Jennifer: Why not?",
        "Paul: Because you decided to make a decision, to live your life without consulting the great Dusty! Dusty, if this were really about business, you would be looking at the numbers that Street Jeans produced right after the initial launch. If this were about business you would be busting your hump to try and turn this thing around!",
        "Jennifer: Paul, Paul, Paul, please. Look, I really appreciate you sticking up for me, but I think that this might work better if I do it on my own.",
        "Paul: Maybe. Just so you know, he said you were brilliant. I heard him say it out loud.",
        "Jennifer: Did you really say that?",
        "Dusty: I've said that to your face. I wish you believed it. But whatever, it's too late now. Decision's been made.",
        "Jennifer: Well, there has to be a way to unmake it. Please, Dusty. I can't let Craig take this, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Why does everyone think that I'm trying to take something from Jennifer?",
        "Katie: You stole her business, Craig. Who's to think that you wouldn't try to steal her baby?",
        "Craig: She didn't want the business. And I am trying to share our baby to be his or her father. Because that is what I am.",
        "Mike: What you are is a guy who thinks only of himself. You don't care about anybody else. You don't care that Jennifer's life has been ruined because of you. Or that the baby she's carrying is going to be scarred just like the rest of your kids were.",
        "Craig: Well, since you think so little of me, maybe its best you're not participating in the raising of my child.",
        "Mike: I'd still marry Jennifer in a heartbeat.",
        "Craig: Oh, yes, well, she's walked away from you though how many times? The night she slept with me --",
        "Katie: No, no, no.",
        "Mike: All right, you need to go home.",
        "Craig: The wedding?",
        "Katie: Go. Mike, I am so sorry.",
        "Mike: You have nothing to be sorry about.",
        "Katie: No, you're wrong. This entire thing is my fault. And if you hate me for the rest of my life, then that's exactly what I deserve.",
        "Mike: Come on, how do you figure this is your fault? It's not like you told Craig about the baby.",
        "Katie: You know, I could have -- warned you again that Craig was coming. That way you guys could have found a different chapel and gotten married anyway.",
        "Mike: Wait a minute, you did the best you could. Even though he's your brother, you tried to help out. That's why I wanted to come by, just I really wanted to thank you for that.",
        "Katie: So how are you doing?",
        "Mike: I just said good-bye to the woman I thought I'd be spending the rest of my life with. But it's not like I haven't done that before. I didn't mean to guilt trip you. I just --",
        "Katie: No --",
        "Mike: At least with you, I wasn't worried. You know? Supposedly, you were going off to be with someone that you wanted more.",
        "Katie: Yeah, look how that turned out.",
        "Mike: Yeah, you're with Henry and you're happy. But with Jen, she's all alone.",
        "Katie: Well, you're alone, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Jen, why did you leave?",
        "Jennifer: I thought I was doing what was best for this baby.",
        "Dusty: I admire that, but what happens the next time?",
        "Jennifer: What do you mean?",
        "Dusty: The next time? When Craig arranges the custody trial to say, conflict with our runway show?",
        "Jennifer: I will work it out.",
        "Dusty: You're pregnant.",
        "Jennifer: That doesn't mean that I'm an invalid.",
        "Dusty: What about the stress while you're carrying the kid? It might not worry you, but it scares the hell out of me. I won't let you do it. It's not worth it. We're talking about business. You, you're creating a life.",
        "Jennifer: You said you would stand by me, whatever I decided.",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to keep a promise, sweetheart. You want a lift? By the way, I loved what you did here.",
        "Jennifer: Me, too.",

        "Barbara: I've been looking all over for you.",

        "Barbara: Jennifer's back.",
        "Paul: She is?",
        "Barbara: Yes, yes. A source told me that they saw her entering the Street Jeans offices. Isn't that fabulous?",
        "Paul: Fabulous for who?",
        "Barbara: For us. For our family. That means that your little niece or nephew, my grandchild, will be raised here. Isn't that wonderful? You knew. Okay. I want details then. And I'm going to sit here and dog you until you give them to me.",
        "Paul: Jennifer's plan hit a little snag.",
        "Barbara: I don't really care about that. All I care about are that she and the baby are safe and are healthy. I don't care about snags.",
        "Paul: Even if it means she called off her wedding to mike?",
        "Barbara: They were getting married? What happened?",
        "Paul: Craig happened.",
        "Barbara: Oh, of course, he did. Where is she?",
        "Paul: She's at the office, begging dusty not to take her company away from her.",
        "Barbara: Okay, I've got to go to her.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. Please, please don't do that.",
        "Barbara: She needs me. She has to know that I love her.",
        "Paul: Mother, with you, nothing says I love you more than staying far, far away.",

        "Jack: Hey, Carly? Hey, honey, it's me. Carly -- hey! I guess somebody missed me, huh? I'm scared to hold you too tight. I don't want to hurt you.",
        "Carly: I'm okay. Just a little sore.",
        "Jack: How's J.J?",
        "Carly: He's all right. He's having trouble keeping awake. He's been asking for you, you should go see him.",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay, I'll go do that.",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack?",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "Carly: What happened with Les?",
        "Jack: Listen, we'll talk about it later, okay?",
        "Carly: Later. As in \"this is really bad news\" later?",
        "Jack: His prints weren't on Julia's phone.",
        "Carly: But he's still being charged with murder, isn't he? He practically confessed to J.J. You told Tom what he said to J.J., right? How he threatened him?",
        "Jack: Yes, and eventually it might help, yes. But the only thing we can prosecute him for right now is attacking you and Keith.",
        "Carly: Is that going to be enough to put him away?",
        "Jack: Don't worry, we'll get him. Okay? Honey, I promise. I'll get him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: If this is about what happened between us earlier.",
        "Keith: No, that was good. This is bad.",
        "Lily: Then what? Why? What? What is it?",
        "Keith: Well, you know, you beat the murder rap. I mean, you got off and you haven't spent any time with your family. That's what you should be doing right now instead of running around looking for evidence on Sweeny.",
        "Lily: I never would have seen my family again if it weren't for you.",
        "Keith: Well, if you're doing this because you think you owe me, you can forget that.",
        "Lily: No, I don't feel like I owe you. I feel like I owe Julia. And J.J. And after what happened to me, I can't just sit home. I have to do something.",
        "Keith: What Sweeny said --?",
        "Lily: You think I'm going to believe that liar? Please.",
        "Keith: You stood up for me. Nobody has done that since my sister died. I just feel like I'm --",
        "Lily: Helping you today.",
        "Keith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: I felt like I did something decent for the first time in a really long time. It felt good. So are we in this together? Hmm?",
        "Keith: I'm glad you're on my side. However, you know, I can't let you do this anymore. Sweeny's very dangerous. He stabbed me. I don't want to see you get hurt. So I'm going to go it alone.",

        "[Jessica remembering]",
        "Les: When Julia was murdered, she was pointing the finger at Keith like everybody else. And then he was all over town saying she was the murderer. What changed?",
        "Jessica: Lucinda? I have some information for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: He'll come here. The minute Les makes bail, he'll come to this house. I know he will.",
        "Jack: We'll be ready for him.",
        "Carly: And what about that court order he showed me? Even with the charges against him, does he still have the right to come here and take J.J.?",
        "Jack: We're going to try to get the judge's order put on hold.",
        "Carly: But when? What if he comes here tonight?",
        "Jack: Carly? I want you listen to me. This is my house, those are my kids upstairs and you are my wife. Les Sweeny might be able to get past the D.A., past the courts, even past the front door, but, baby, I promise, he will never get through me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I really don't care what you think, Jennifer needs my help.",
        "Paul: Jennifer has never needed your help less than she does right now. You're the whole reason that this whole runaway train got started. If you hadn't shot your mouth off to Hal then Craig would never have found out the baby until it was too late for him to do anything about it.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay, I am very sorry that Craig overheard my conversation with Hal. I am sorry for all the mistakes I've ever made as a mother. But you know what? [Paul laughs] Jen needs us. She needs us to rally around her right now.",
        "Paul: With our family, rallying around is a recipe for disaster.",
        "Barbara: I know you hate me, but if you love your sister as much as you say you do, you'll put those feelings aside and you will help me help her.",
        "Paul: Oh, I will help her. I'll help her change her phone number, her hair color. I only wish I could help her change her DNA.",

        "Katie: Thanks. You going to be all right?",
        "Mike: Yeah, yeah. Someday. Look, thank you, again for trying to help me out. All right?",

        "Craig: Milk is good for expectant mothers. Sorry to hear about your broken engagement.",
        "Jennifer: Get out.",
        "Craig: You're moving out? Closing up shop? That's probably good. You could nest at home, work there. Heck, you could even marry me.",
        "Jennifer: Don't make me sick.",
        "Craig: It's a joke, Jennifer. That's a joke. All right, I'll see you in court. Because you have to know that no matter what happens, I will be my child's father. In every sense of the word.",
