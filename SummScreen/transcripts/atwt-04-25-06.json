        "Carly: Stop. He's dead. She. It. Dead, dead, dead.",
        "[Creaking outside] [Carly screams] It's a branch -- a stupid branch.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[ Glass breaks ]",
        "[Carly screams]",
        "Carly: Oh, J -- J.J., you -- startled me, honey.",
        "J.J: Sorry.",
        "Carly: What are you doing here? You're supposed to be over at the Stanhopes'.",
        "J.J.: Jason wanted to play that game Dad got for me, \"Third Empire Planet Wars.\" So, I said I'll find it and bring it back to his house.",
        "Carly: Oh -- wait! Where are you going, honey?",
        "J.J: Um, my game's down in the basement.",
        "Carly: No, J.J. -- You can't go down there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: How soon do you think you can get away?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. Like a, half an hour, maybe. I just want to double check on some things here at the club and make sure everything is ready for opening night.",
        "Will: You sound excited.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you should see how great the place is looking.",
        "Will: Yeah? How's Casey handling the stress?",
        "Gwen: Hmm. Actually, he's freaking out. I should probably bail him out.",
        "Will: Okay. Well, meet me at the Lakeview in a half an hour. Don't be late.",
        "Gwen: I won't. I love you.",
        "Will: Back at you.",
        "Gwen: Okay, what's the new crisis?",
        "Casey: I can't find my playlist for tomorrow night. I put together, like, 200 songs and somehow I deleted them all.",
        "Gwen: Well, okay, that's no big deal. You backed it up, right?",
        "Casey: Well, I was just about to sync into my pda but -- ah, they're all gone. Damn it!",
        "Gwen: Okay, do you remember the order?",
        "Casey: Well, kind of, but it was 200 songs.",
        "Gwen: Okay, it's not the end of the world. Take a deep breath. We're going to rebuild it. I will help you.",
        "Casey: No, I don't want to have to make you stay.",
        "Gwen: No, it won't take that long. You put the play list back together on your drive and I'll make a backup hard copy. How long will it take?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Will, you can't keep blowing off Calculus and expect to pass the course.",
        "Will: I'm not blowing it off. We're just gonna cut tonight a little short, okay? We're gonna work for a half hour and then I'll work twice as long as usual tomorrow.",
        "Maddie: What, do you have a date?",
        "Will: Yeah, actually. Gwen's been working like crazy to get Crash going for the opening. I kind of get the feeling that this might be the last free night we get to spend together for a while.",
        "Maddie: Hmm, tell me about it. Casey's been working 24/7 on that music and -- you know what? I have to tell you, you really need to start doing the same thing and get ready for that exam. Because if you don't pass the exam, you don't graduate.",
        "Barbara: And you can forget about having access to your trust fund, as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Do you really expect me to believe that Emily has been holding Dusty somewhere all this time? She is not capable of something like that.",
        "Meg: A lot's changed since you were married to her. She's not the same woman.",
        "Hal: You have any proof of this?",
        "Meg: Paul didn't try to commit suicide, Hal. He was shot. In the back, by Emily. She tried to kill him.",
        "Hal: That's insane.",
        "Meg: It certainly is. But that gunshot wound was not self-inflicted. And I should know, because I'm the one who nursed him back to health. So do the math. If Emily is capable of shooting Paul in the back, then she's capable of doing anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Jennifer!",
        "Jennifer: Oh, my God, where --",
        "Emily: Thank God you're okay!",
        "Jennifer: Where is -- where is Dusty?",
        "Emily: I have no idea.",
        "Jennifer: I heard a gunshot.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God, so did I. I heard the same thing. And then I saw your car outside. And I was so afraid I got here too late and something had happened to you.",
        "Jennifer: Are you saying that you followed me here?",
        "Emily: Yes. Yes, that's exactly what happened. You told me that Dusty tried to call you or you talked to him or something, and I was so afraid you were gonna try to go after him yourself so I contacted your brother -- I tried to and I couldn't reach him. So I figured I would -- I would go after you myself. And I've been all over town looking for you, and then I ended up in the woods and then when I -- when I saw your car outside I heard the gunshot.",
        "Jennifer: No! You are such a liar! Where is Dusty? Where is he?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Dusty, thank God. I heard that gun shot and I thought Emily had -- Jennifer is gonna be so happy.",
        "Dusty: Where is she?",
        "Paul: She's around here somewhere. We can look for her together, now. You need a hand?",
        "Dusty: One more step and you're dead.",
        "Paul: Look, I swear to you. We need to find Emily. Now will you put that gun down?",
        "Dusty: I will deal with Emily. Right now, I'm dealing with you.",
        "Paul: Look! We need to find Jennifer before Emily does.",
        "Dusty: I don't think Jennifer's around.",
        "Paul: She just called me and said that I was supposed to help her find you! She knows that you were in the cabin and that you were locked there. And -- and what, you think now she's just gonna split?",
        "Dusty: Take out your cell phone. Throw it right here.",
        "Paul: Why, what -- what are you gonna do?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna use it to call the cops.",
        "Paul: There isn't time for that! Emily is insane!",
        "Dusty: Because you drove her to insanity. Get down on the ground.",
        "Paul: What, you want me to just -- just be on the ground while Jennifer's out there trying --",
        "Dusty: On your knees!",
        "Paul: She shot me, you know. Emily shot me.",
        "Dusty: Really? Talk to me, tell me more.",
        "Paul: I wanted everybody to think that I shot myself, but that's not the truth. I just wanted everybody to believe that. The truth is that -- that Emily shot me in the back.",
        "Dusty: Why?",
        "Paul: Because I -- because I called off the wedding.",
        "Dusty: You want me to believe that?",
        "Paul: It's true! Look, we need to find Jennifer before Emily does, because if we don't find her first, God knows what Emily's gonna do to her. Now, look, I'll tell you what, we split up, we'll cover more ground that way.",
        "Dusty: Get down! You're not going anywhere, pal.",
        "Paul: Dusty, look, we don't have time for this!",
        "Dusty: What the hell's that on your finger?",
        "Paul: It's a wedding ring.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, Emily has the same one. You know, you had me for a second when you said she shot you.",
        "Paul: She did.",
        "Dusty: And then you married her? Let me guess -- to protect someone, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Jennifer, stop, stop, okay? I know you're worried sick about Dusty. But I promise you, I have no idea where he is.",
        "Jennifer: No, no. Stop -- stop it! You did not -- you did not follow me here, I followed you! And I called you and told you that I talked to Dusty because I knew, we knew that you would lead us right to him.",
        "Emily: We, we, we? You and Paul? Paul?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, yes, that's right. That's right. Oh, we knew. We knew all we had to do was plant the seed and then you would come here and check on him --",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. He did that? He lied to me? He betrayed me?",
        "Jennifer: Just please tell me -- tell me where he is! Just tell me where Dusty is, please. Damn it, Emily! Is he here or not? Is he --",
        "Emily: Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, he's here!",
        "Jennifer: Why?",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. I did it. I did it all for Paul! [Emily sobbing] To protect him! Everything I did was for him! Oh, God, I love him so much. And he made me believe he loved me! God -- he married me! He promised me! He promised me! Why did he do that?",
        "Jennifer: You can cry, Emily -- you can cry later. Right now, you're gonna taking me to Dusty. Get up!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: If this is true, why didn't Paul say anything? Why didn't he press charges against her?",
        "Meg: Because he felt he deserved what he got. And he felt that he was pushing her over the edge.",
        "Hal: Paul? He's not like that. He doesn't have a guilt-ridden bone in his body.",
        "Meg: Are you telling me that after Paul disappeared, you never had any inkling that Emily was hiding something from you?",
        "Hal: Well, she -- she was acting strange, but she -- but she'd just been dumped at her wedding. She was an emotional wreck --",
        "Meg: Hal, that wasn't from a broken heart. She was freaked out because she thought she killed a man! Look, Hal, I know it's hard for you to hear, but you have to hear it and you have to do something to stop her before she does something to hurt somebody else. Like Paul or Dusty or even Jennifer.",
        "Tom: Hal? Hey. You okay?",
        "Hal: Yeah.",
        "Tom: Listen, I spoke to Emily a little while ago.",
        "Hal: Oh? You don't think Emily had anything to do with Dusty's disappearance, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gee, Mom, where you been? It's been, like, a whole month since you dangled my trust fund over my head.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I was merely reacting to what I just heard Maddie say. Now, is it true? Are you failing Calculus?",
        "Will: No, she's just being tough on me.",
        "Barbara: Okay, well, I need to remind you about our agreement. You have to graduate in order to have access to your trust fund.",
        "Maddie: He's been working really hard, Ms. Ryan.",
        "Will: And I do plan on graduating. But not because of the money. I'm not even counting on getting it anyway, even if I do graduate.",
        "Barbara: What are you implying?",
        "Will: That Gwen and I aren't holding our breath. She's working at Crash. And I'm making good money at the hospital. So, we're gonna do just fine with or without the trust fund.",
        "Barbara: Not if you short-change your studies.",
        "Will: Is there something you needed to say to me, Mom? Or are you just here to give me a hard time?",
        "Barbara: I am trying very hard to make up for my past mistakes. Do I have to remind you who told Lisa to hire Gwen?",
        "Will: Yeah, and Gwen's very grateful for that.",
        "Barbara: Are you grateful, son?",
        "Will: I don't trust your motives, Mom. I never will.",
        "Barbara: Well then, I have a lot of work to do, don't I? But I didn't come here to talk about that, I came to ask you if you've talked to your sister.",
        "Will: Nope, why?",
        "Barbara: Because ever since Dusty disappeared she's become very remote, she doesn't answer her phone calls, she won't talk to me, I don't know where she is half the time.",
        "Will: Well, maybe she's trying to get away from you.",
        "Barbara: I have been supportive of her ever since this ordeal began. Much more than you or your brother, Paul.",
        "Will: Okay, Mom, if I see her, then I'll tell her that you've been worried about her.",
        "Barbara: There, now that wasn't so hard -- to be civil to your mother, was it?",
        "Will: Are you done?",
        "Barbara: Have a nice day, will. Nice to see you, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Nice to you, too.",
        "Will: She just -- she won't quit.",
        "Maddie: Did you ever think that she's just being honest? I mean, she looked like she was really trying, Will.",
        "Will: Come on, please. Not you, too.",
        "Maddie: Not me, too, what?",
        "Will: You sound just like Gwen!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Can I make a suggestion, oh great deejay of the night?",
        "Casey: What, do you have a problem with the sequence?",
        "Gwen: No, actually -- I actually like the way that you mixed the styles, but -- there's another version of the bloc party song right after the Coheed and Cambria, and it's pretty awesome.",
        "Casey: The Ladytron remix?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I've heard of it. It's pretty good.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, and it flows pretty well into the Arctic Monkeys track, don't you think?",
        "Casey: Nice. Look who knows her stuff.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, well at least I'll make some musical input. It won't be with my band, but at least it's something.",
        "Casey: Yeah, I'm sorry that didn't work out.",
        "Gwen: It's okay. You know, some things just aren't supposed to happen.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but -- why don't you just go solo?",
        "Gwen: We want to keep people in the club, not drive them out. So, I guess that's -- that's it. We're done here, right?",
        "Casey: Actually, there's another favor I need from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I just don't want you getting cut by all this broken glass, that's all.",
        "J.J.: I'm wearing shoes, Carly. How am I gonna get cut?",
        "Carly: Well, you can never be too careful. Ow! You see what I mean?",
        "J.J.: Are you all right?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I'll live.",
        "J.J.: Jack says to run it under cold water.",
        "Carly: Oh, yeah? Well, I guess I'll do that. Jack knows best, right? You need to get back to the Stanhopes'. So, I'm gonna pick the rest of this up and I'll walk you over, okay?",
        "J.J.: It's only, like, next door.",
        "Carly: Yes, I know. But still, I'll just throw this away and I'll bring you over, okay?",
        "J.J.: What about my game?",
        "Carly: Oh -- well, you know, I think that Jack put all your games upstairs.",
        "J.J.: No, I'm pretty sure this one's still in the basement.",
        "Carly: Well, J.J., I really would like you to look upstairs!",
        "J.J.: Okay, okay. You don't have to get so mad.",
        "Carly: I'm not -- I'm not mad, honey. It's just that it's -- it's so messy down there. I don't want you to trip over something and get hurt. Okay? That's all.",
        "J.J.: Okay.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Hello?",
        "J.J.: Dad, is that you?",
        "Jack: J.J.? What's up, buddy?",
        "J.J.: I came home to get a game to take back to Jason's.",
        "Jack: Yeah?",
        "J.J.: And Carly's acting all weird.",
        "Jack: Weird how?",
        "J.J.: I don't know. Just like, weird. She dropped some dishes and she won't let me go down to the basement.",
        "Jack: Did she ask you to call me, buddy? Tell me the truth.",
        "J.J.: No! No, she doesn't even know I'm doing it!",
        "Jack: Okay. Well, she probably is just a little jittery because she's home alone, that's all.",
        "J.J.: Can you come here and calm her down?",
        "Jack: I don't think that's really necessary, buddy. She's gonna be okay.",
        "J.J.: I know you guys are mad at each other, but whenever Parker and I get into a fight, you say we should work it out.",
        "Jack: This is a little different.",
        "J.J.: Why? Come on, Dad. Carly needs you. I can tell.",
        "Carly: So, this is the only one I could find. I know it's not \"Third Solar System Space Wars\" or whatever.",
        "J.J.: \"Third Empire Planet Wars?\" I know, but this one's fine.",
        "Carly: Good. What's the matter? You seem down.",
        "J.J.: I don't want to go back to Jason's tonight. I'd rather stay here with you.",
        "Carly: Aw, you always have such a good time with Jason, don't ya?",
        "J.J.: I know, but --",
        "Carly: What? What is it?",
        "J.J.: I don't think you like being alone.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, that's not really true. I'm perfectly happy. It's nice sometimes to have a little peace and quiet around here.",
        "J.J.: I called Jack.",
        "Carly: Why did you do that?",
        "J.J.: I thought you were acting weird. So I asked him to come over.",
        "Carly: Oh, J.J., I wish you hadn't done that. Because he's gonna think that I put you up to it.",
        "J.J.: No, I told him you didn't even know I was calling.",
        "Carly: What'd he say?",
        "J.J.: I don't think he's coming.",
        "Carly: Oh.",
        "J.J.: I wish you guys weren't fighting.",
        "Carly: Me, too. I love you.",
        "J.J.: So, I can stay?",
        "Carly: No. You don't want to disappoint your friend, do you? I'm sure that Jason has been really looking forward to spending tonight with you. So, come on. Let's go.",
        "J.J.: But, Carly --",
        "Carly: No buts!",
        "J.J.: You know, I can walk just next door.",
        "Carly: Huh. Well, aren't you the brave one? All right, you go ahead. Here's your game. Have a good time. Behave yourself. I'll see you in the morning, okay?",
        "J.J.: Are you sure you're gonna be all right on your own?",
        "Carly: Would I lie to you?",
        "J.J.: Okay. See ya.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "J.J.: Bye.",
        "Carly: Bye. What a night. [Door opens] Did you forget something?",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: This is good. It looks like you actually may be ready for the test. Will? Hello?",
        "Will: Hmm? What?",
        "Maddie: What are you doing? Are you thinking about the -- your date with Gwen?",
        "Will: Yeah. Well, its kind our two-month anniversary, so I really wanted it to be a special night.",
        "Maddie: Wow, two months. Time flies.",
        "Will: Yeah. You want to see what I got her?",
        "Maddie: Yeah!",
        "Will: Yeah, it's a guitar strap. You know, 'cause she was -- she really bummed out that she wasn't gonna get her band back together and I didn't want her to stop playing. So I figured, you know, maybe this will be a little inspiration.",
        "Maddie: That's so romantic. Gwen's really lucky.",
        "Will: No, no, I'm the lucky one.",
        "Maddie: No, you two are so in love.",
        "Will: Whatever. You and Casey will be that close one day.",
        "Maddie: Don't count on it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Why do I need a guitar for a sound check? Can't I just say, \"Testing one, two, three, testing?\"",
        "Casey: I need to hear how a singer fills the room up, so --",
        "Gwen: Well, what do you need a sound check for, anyways? What, you're gonna find another band by tomorrow night?",
        "Casey: No. But, Lisa still hasn't given up on the idea of having live music with my mixes. So, I'm still looking for talent. You know, it should be you up on the stage tomorrow night.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, well, that's life.",
        "Casey: Just do me this favor, please?",
        "Gwen: I'm lousy. I'm really lousy without backup.",
        "Casey: I'll be the judge of that. Come on. Are you chicken? Come on.",
        "Gwen: You're gonna owe me big time. Big.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: I'm not going to lie to you. Emily was beyond edgy. When I questioned her about breaking into Meg's hotel suite, she looked scared to death.",
        "Hal: It's Paul. Paul -- he's got her caught up in something.",
        "Tom: Well, there's no question that she's caught up in something, but I'm not sure Paul is pulling the strings this time.",
