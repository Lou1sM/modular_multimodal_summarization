        "Carly: Sage, your oatmeal is ready!",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "[Carly screams]",
        "[Bowl breaks]",
        "Carly: Oh. Jack! What the hell are you doing?",
        "Jack: I'm standing in the kitchen. What's wrong with you?",
        "Carly: The door was locked, Jack.",
        "[Keys jingle]",
        "Carly: Doesn't a locked door mean anything to you?",
        "Jack: No, not -- not here. I was just wondering --",
        "Carly: You know something, this isn't your house anymore. And if the door was locked, it was locked for a reason, like maybe I didn't want some man sneaking up on me with a weapon in his hand, right?",
        "Jack: Hey, listen for a second. I'm not just some man. It's not a weapon. It's a skateboard. Why don't you ratchet it down a bit?",
        "Carly: I'm just not happy with you walking in here like you're entitled or something, okay?",
        "Jack: Look, I just remembered that its teachers meetings this morning, so I thought I'd stop by and see if maybe you wanted me to take the kids for a while. I'm doing something nice, not breaking and entering.",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Did you ever hear of a phone? Could you maybe muster the common courtesy to use a phone? What the hell am I doing?",
        "Jack: You're overreacting.",
        "Carly: Why am I doing this? You did this. You clean it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Do you remember last night?",
        "Katie: Mmm. Vaguely.",
        "Brad: The part where we were having a fight, then we talked and we weren't having a fight. That's a new thing in my life. I liked it.",
        "Katie: Well, the only reason talking worked is 'cause you wanted something more than you wanted to be mad.",
        "Brad: That's not true.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brad: Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah, it is, but mainly I didn't want us fighting about Mike. So I've decided that I'm not gonna sweat your past anymore.",
        "Katie: Good.",
        "Brad: And, of course, there's no reason for you to sweat mine.",
        "Katie: How could there be? Hi, Mike.",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Brad: Good morning. Would you -- would you like some coffee or something?",
        "Mike: No. No, thanks. I just came by to talk and, uh, apologize.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Uh, you missed a giant glob.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: What the hell is wrong with you this morning?",
        "Carly: You. You walking in here and trying to take over.",
        "Jack: Take -- take over? What are you talking -- Carly, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that bringing my kids a skateboard and offering to take them to the park was taking over.",
        "Carly: You call first, Jack. You call first, and you clear it with me.",
        "Jack: You can't do this. You can try, but you can't push me out of my kids' lives.",
        "Carly: Jack, you are more than welcome to be a part of their lives, as long as I know about it in advance. I'm not gonna be the one feeding them and chauffeuring them and disciplining them so you can waltz in here like Santa Claus. I really did not want to start this day like this.",
        "Jack: All right, you know what? I'm leaving.",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "Jack: Because I don't want them to see us fighting like this, Carly. And I am so mad at you right now, I can't hide it. But this isn't over. You are way out of line.",
        "Carly: Mmm. You handled that well, Tenney.",
        "[Vehicle departing]",
        "Sage: Wasn't that Daddy's car? Why didn't he stay?",
        "Carly: Um, he had to go to work. Look what he brought you.",
        "Parker: This is so sweet.",
        "Sage: Where's my oatmeal?",
        "Carly: It's a long story. Do you know what this morning really needs? A do- over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Do you know when you're coming home yet? Okay. Here's Dad.",
        "Holden: Hi. Yeah, yeah, everything's great here. We were just about to have a family meeting to see what we were gonna do today. Right. Okay, all right, we'll call you tonight before bedtime. Bye-bye.",
        "Faith: She didn't sound very happy.",
        "Holden: Well, that's because she misses you guys.",
        "Faith: Then why doesn't she come home?",
        "Holden: So, Nat, what are we gonna do today? Go to Paris, Istanbul?",
        "Natalie: Daddy.",
        "Holden: All right. How about this? How about we go to the park?",
        "Natalie: Can we swing on the swings?",
        "Holden: Anything you want, Honey. Give me a hug.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Mom, we're out of cereal.",
        "Sage: Did you put cinnamon on it?",
        "Carly: I sure did.",
        "Sage: But I wanted blueberries.",
        "Carly: Okay, I'll start over.",
        "Parker: What is this? What happened?",
        "Carly: You know what? Why don't we just go through a drive-through? That way everyone will get the prompt and courteous service they deserve.",
        "Sage: You and Daddy had a fight, didn't you?",
        "Carly: It's gonna be a beautiful day. You don't have school, so let's go have some fun, okay? I'll get my keys.",
        "Parker: A really big fight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Wow. Aren't you a ray of sunshine this morning? Okay, I am, uh, gonna take a stab in the dark. Um, does your mood have anything to do with a personal relationship that isn't going quite the way you'd like it?",
        "Aaron: How'd you know?",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: Well, when you have me as a role model -- what happened?",
        "Aaron: Went to pick up Sofie from work last night. Turns out she left early. Called her. She didn't call me back. And her phone's still off.",
        "Meg: Ouch.",
        "Aaron: At least you can't call her needy. At least not to me. D\u00e9ja vu all over again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Yep. Only this time you're leaving.",
        "Sofie: So you can get trashed in peace and quiet? It's not gonna happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: So, I just -- I wanted to let you know that nothing like what happened yesterday will ever happen again. I'll stay out of your way like I should.",
        "Brad: Look, Mike, I get that someone set you up with that note. I mean, I totally get that, and you're not gonna believe this, but once -- or maybe eight thousand times -- I made a move I wish I didn't make. So let's just forget about it.",
        "Mike: I wish I could. I really wish I could. I'm sorry.",
        "Brad: Take care.",
        "Katie: Take care. What?",
        "Brad: He's a classy guy, isn't he? I don't like that. [Katie chuckles] Never know what a guy like that's gonna do next.",
        "Katie: Hey, you're a pretty classy guy yourself.",
        "Brad: Oh, yeah?",
        "Katie: In such an obvious way, not a consistent way. But classy nonetheless.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Liberty: Hi. Excuse me. You're Brad Snyder, aren't you?",
        "Brad: That's right.",
        "Liberty: I was just wondering if maybe you had, like, five minutes --",
        "Katie: We'll be right there. Listen, uh, we got to get to the station right away. That was Kim. She said there's a major problem.",
        "Liberty: Uh, just --",
        "Brad: Okay, you know what? I can't talk right now. I'm really sorry. But thank you so much for watching, all right? What'd she say was wrong?",
        "Katie: She just said we got to get there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: And the problem is, almost every other segment ties in with the nanny being on the show.",
        "Katie: So, tell us again why she backed out.",
        "Kim: Well, you couldn't call her articulate. She was just very, very upset.",
        "Brad: You think the judge got to her?",
        "Katie: I told her not to tell him she was doing the interview.",
        "Brad: Well, he's her boss, her boyfriend, her father figure wrapped into one. I'm sure she tells him everything.",
        "Katie: Yeah, and she thinks that he's taking care of her, that he loves her.",
        "Kim: Well, you know, there could be a little guilt there, too. I mean, after this article in \"The Intruder,\" the kids must know about it.",
        "Katie: And it turns out the judge is real stable. It said in the paper that he went after Emily Stewart with the proverbial blunt instrument.",
        "Brad: So, the nanny could be afraid of him, too.",
        "Kim: Yeah. It doesn't sound like we have much of a chance, does it? But it's not the first time we've had to put together a new show, actually in less time than this.",
        "Katie: You know what, Kim? Let me talk to her again and see if I can get her to change her mind. And in the meantime, you guys can brainstorm about a new show if we need it.",
        "Brad: How come you get to talk to the girl and I get the boring stuff?",
        "Katie: I talk to the girl 'cause I'm the one that can get her to change her mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Just do me a favor -- don't tell my dad any of this.",
        "Meg: Do you think he has enough on his plate?",
        "Aaron: I just look at what he's going through, and how can I be, you know -- \"My girlfriend stood me up\"? Especially when she's not even my girlfriend. Not really.",
        "Meg: Okay, do you want to hear my new, new year's resolution?",
        "Aaron: At the end of April, sure.",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Meg: Uh, better late than never.",
        "Aaron: Okay.",
        "Meg: Okay, here it is. I am never again gonna expect anything from a relationship with someone who just can't handle it.",
        "Aaron: For example?",
        "Meg: Paul. I mean, let him watch a plant for six months. Maybe -- maybe he could even work up to a goldfish, but leave me out of it.",
        "Aaron: You think I'm asking too much from a girl who was pregnant, gave up her kid, kidnapped it, and gave it up again? I mean -- where do we find these people?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Meg: You know, I sometimes ask myself, \"Am I asking for too much just to meet one normal person that doesn't come with three tons of emotional baggage?\"",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Mike: Hey, Meg. How you doing this morning?",
        "Meg: Hey. Great. I didn't know you were coming out.",
        "Aaron: Hey, Mike.",
        "Mike: Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Hey, thanks for the tips. I feel -- I feel awesome.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Aaron: Okay, later.",
        "[Meg chuckles]",
        "Mike: I don't believe he meant that.",
        "Meg: Yeah. So, what are you doing here? Not that it's not great to see you.",
        "Mike: I'm walking the property line with a contractor, and I wanted to see if you would like to come.",
        "Meg: Well, you know what? Um, I think that's exactly what I want to do this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: I'll bet you haven't had anything to eat.",
        "Paul: Look, Sofie, I don't want to throw you out of my house, but I will. You really got to get out.",
        "Sofie: Okay, listen, you didn't let me give up, so I'm not gonna let you give up.",
        "Paul: You are way too young for all of this.",
        "Barbara: I have to agree with my son there.",
        "Paul: Shouldn't you be lying down?",
        "Barbara: I have been lying down ever since I got back to the hospital, and, frankly, I'm a little sick of it. So I thought I'd come down here and harass you.",
        "Paul: Oh, great.",
        "Barbara: Why don't you go and let me take care of this mess, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Because I promised her, that's why.",
        "Faith: But the swings are so boring.",
        "Holden: Well, I'm sorry, but the dance clubs are not open yet.",
        "Faith: You're really in a bad mood, aren't you?",
        "Holden: I-I'm trying not to be.",
        "Faith: And I'm not helping.",
        "Holden: I didn't say that.",
        "Faith: You didn't have to. Hey, Nat, I'll race you to the swings. Last one has to push.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Holden: I can't tell you how happy I am to see you.",
        "Carly: And I can't remember the last time anybody said that to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Why don't you just give us a moment? Let me handle this, okay?",
        "Sofie: I'm really worried about him. He's been drinking a lot.",
        "Barbara: Sofie, the sad fact is there's nothing you can do about it.",
        "Sofie: Can you?",
        "Barbara: Maybe not, but I have a tougher hide than you do. Well, you certainly have been showing your houseguest a lovely time.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Hey, look, since you're up and around, why don't you take over and get her some breakfast or something, huh?",
        "Barbara: No. No. If you're gonna drink in the morning, I'm gonna stay right here and make sure that you don't enjoy it. So, what have you done this time, Paul?",
        "Paul: I screwed up.",
        "Barbara: Mmm. Okay. We have a lot of time here. Tell Mama all about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: It just seems to me that if we -- if we move the access road a quarter mile to the south, we can end up saving all those trees over there.",
        "Man: Quarter mile south? Is that still on Snyder property?",
        "Mike: Yeah. Yeah, we just surveyed it yesterday. You can check it out for yourself.",
        "Man: Huh. Wouldn't just save those trees, could save us about $10,000. I'm gonna go take a look.",
        "Meg: Wow, you're really good at this, aren't you?",
        "Mike: Ah, it's mainly just common sense.",
        "Meg: Well, thank you for saving those trees. I used to climb them when I was little.",
        "Mike: Oh, yeah?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Mike: You were a tomboy?",
        "Meg: Eh, I was incensed because I couldn't get on the football team. Come on, let me show you the great view from the valley.",
        "Mike: Okay. Just make sure you watch out for the -- gopher holes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, I just want to know what's bothering you about coming on the show.",
        "Nanny: I just think its private, that's all.",
        "Katie: Not anymore. It's been in the paper.",
        "Nanny: Well, that's just not right. They invaded our privacy.",
        "Katie: Your boss is a judge. He's a public figure.",
        "Nanny: I'm not.",
        "Katie: You are now, unfortunately. And he's made a statement. He's defending himself. But you -- nobody knows your side of the story.",
        "Nanny: Well, nobody wants to. They just think I'm some kind --",
        "Katie: I don't. I think you're the victim here. This powerful, well-to-do man and a young girl just trying to make a living.",
        "Nanny: Look, I'm not a victim. I didn't do anything I didn't want to.",
        "Brad: That's right, and you should come on the show and say just that. That's what's bothering you, isn't it? You think everyone's gonna feel sorry for you, and you don't want that.",
        "Nanny: How did you know that?",
        "Brad: Someone that goes out and gets a job with lots of responsibility, who is smart enough to deal with an important man like the judge, you don't want everyone thinking that you're a victim.",
        "Nanny: Everybody acts like it was some kind of vicious plot, like he tricked me or something.",
        "Brad: But it's not. It wasn't, was it? He loves you, and you love him.",
        "Nanny: Yes.",
        "Brad: Then don't let people decide what happened without telling the truth. Say what it meant to you and to the judge. Don't let people just assume that you're some kind of bimbo, because you're not, are you?",
        "Nanny: All right. I'll do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You went back out there to see Meg last night, didn't you?",
        "Paul: Yep.",
        "Barbara: She know that you'd been drinking?",
        "Paul: I wasn't that drunk.",
        "Barbara: Well, she knew that you were drinking, believe me. And -- and --",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Barbara: You went back out there to apologize, right? Well, you know what I think?",
        "Paul: No. What?",
        "Barbara: I think you want her to feel sorry for you.",
        "Paul: Come on. No.",
        "Barbara: Do you know how many songs men have written about, \"Oh, what would I do without you?\" Or, \"Don't leave me. I'll fall apart.\" It's manipulation, Paul. Now, if you want her back, you're gonna have to face a few facts. And the first one is, stop drinking. And then you have to face the fact that she's gonna have to do this on her time. And you're gonna have to be the man that she fell in love with -- strong, independent, and sober.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you -- you're assuming that I have a chance.",
        "Barbara: You don't if you keep that up, I promise you.",
        "Paul: All right, what do I do, Mom?",
        "Barbara: Honey, you talk to her. You don't play with her. You don't tell her how much you love her. You tell her that you're gonna make changes.",
        "Paul: No, that's what you want me to do.",
        "Barbara: I want my children to be happy. And I want you to be the man that I know you can be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Come here.",
        "Mike: No, I'm -- I'm okay, really. I just lost my balance there for a second.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Yeah, you're -- you're fine.",
        "[Mike groans]",
        "Meg: Oh, yeah, real fine.",
        "Mike: Ooh.",
        "Meg: Yeah, the -- when the color drained from your face and that stifled yell -- yeah.",
        "Mike: You remember what I said about denial?",
        "Meg: Uh-huh, yeah, yeah. You're fine. Okay. Well, you know, I only have one question. If you can't put any weight on that foot, how are you gonna get back to the house?",
        "Mike: Awkwardly.",
        "Meg: Yeah. You know, like the song says, lean on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Now, it's important that your hair and your makeup says just what you want it to say -- strong, independent woman.",
        "Nanny: I don't usually do anything special with my hair, but maybe today I should.",
        "Kim: So, we have our guest.",
        "Katie: Thanks to Brad.",
        "Kim: Oh, oh. Wait a minute, Honey. This is a closed set.",
        "Liberty: Oh, look, I-I won't stay long. It's just really important I talk to Brad Snyder.",
        "Kim: Uh, just a minute. Uh, Kurt, do me a favor. Take this young lady down to the front desk. You can leave a note down there for Brad.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, I'm so mad at Jack. And to exert my power, I said, \"No, you may not take them to the park. Be gone.\" So instead of having two or maybe three hours to myself, here I am in the great outdoors with two kids who are royally steamed at me.",
        "Holden: Guess you showed him, huh?",
        "Carly: Well, you know, it's not nearly as bad as it could have been, thanks to you.",
        "Holden: Well, don't thank me yet. Wait till you hear what I set up behind your back. Kids are gonna be very excited.",
        "Carly: About what? What did you do? [Holden laughs] You're -- you're not talking about organized fun, are you? I'm not so sure I'm crazy about spontaneous fun. You're gonna pay for this, farm boy.",
        "[They are all playing Baseball]",
        "Holden: All right, Guys, take it easy.",
        "Faith: Pitch it right by her, Dad.",
        "Sage: Come on, Mom, hit one.",
        "Natalie: Come on, Carly, you can do it.",
        "Holden: No batter. Whoo!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer: What are you doing here? I thought you took the day off.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that didn't work out. Thought I'd start processing the paperwork on that drug thief.",
        "Officer: Too late. Chief transferred that over to McLaughlin.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's great. That's -- it's just great to be kept in the loop like that. This day's turning out to be a stellar one.",
        "Officer: Must have seen Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Okay.",
        "[Liberty sighs]",
        "Carly: Parker!",
        "Carly: Parker. Parker. Don't try-- don't try to move, okay?",
        "Parker: I'm okay.",
        "Carly: Let me be the judge of that. Can -- can you move your fingers, Honey?",
        "Parker: Yeah, but it really hurts.",
        "Holden: I'll drive you to the hospital, Parker.",
        "Carly: No, Holden, that's all right.",
        "Holden: Carly, it's okay, it's okay. You can ride in the back with Parker.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe we can stop at the dump on the way and get rid of that damn skateboard.",
        "Parker: No. It wasn't the skateboard. It was the stupid girl.",
        "Carly: What -- what girl?",
        "Parker: Well, didn't you see her? She was right there. Where'd she go?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: So, he went to talk to Meg.",
        "Barbara: He did, which means that we have time to talk to each other. Listen, I know that Paul helped you through a very difficult time and you want to be a friend to him, as well.",
        "Sofie: I know what you're gonna say.",
        "Barbara: If you do, then you know that I'm right. Paul has to handle this by himself.",
        "Sofie: He's so unhappy, and the drinking is just making it worse.",
        "Barbara: I know. But he has to handle that. And we have to handle your career.",
        "Sofie: What?",
        "Barbara: Yes. I told you we need to talk about this. We need to talk about your jewelry line. Something wrong?",
        "Sofie: No. No, I -- it's just that no one's really believed in me before.",
        "Barbara: Well, Honey, I guess no one really paid attention.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You don't listen real well, do you?",
        "Paul: Meg, I need to talk to you.",
        "Meg: Open the door.",
        "Mike: You know, I'm fine if you need to talk.",
        "Meg: Wait here. Go and put some ice on your ankle, and hopefully it'll take down the swelling, okay? Oh, great. I'm so glad you're back. Can you get some ice for Mike's ankle?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Meg: I just need to go take care of something.",
        "Jack: Right. What'd you do?",
        "Mike: Oh, something stupid.",
        "Jack: You fit right in here.",
        "Meg: Okay, I won't live like this. I won't have you showing up whenever you feel the need to talk.",
        "Paul: Well, I did -- I really did want to talk to you. I -- listen. All right, what's going on with you and Kasnoff?",
        "Meg: He fell, and he hurt --",
        "Paul: He fell?",
        "Meg: You know, this comes under the category of \"None of your business,\" like everything else in my life.",
        "Paul: Oh, so he's in your life now? Oh, come on, Meg. Can't you see he's playing you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Okay, here's what I want you to do. I want you to come up with three pieces very fast, without thinking. Don't really think it through. Now, don't be like that.",
        "Sofie: Why?",
        "Barbara: Fast and fun. Because that way I can get a sense of your style, the real you. Don't worry about -- about the work. There will be plenty of work later on. I want you to have fun right now and just come up with something quickly.",
        "Sofie: I can't believe you're being so nice to me.",
        "Barbara: Wait till I start with the constructive criticism. Now, listen, do you need -- do you need cash in advance for materials? Stupid question. Of course you need it in advance. Don't worry about that.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, let me -- here, let me call the store where I got my supplies, and I can give you an estimate.",
        "Barbara: What? What?",
        "Sofie: It's a text message. I forgot all about Aaron.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Last night, I told you to go away and stay away. You know, Jack is in there.",
        "Paul: Last night was stupid, okay?",
        "Meg: I can arrest you for trespassing.",
        "Paul: It was a dumb thing to do. I'm a mess. I'm not doing so good right now, but I will be. I-I will be doing better. I -- I want to be the guy that you like. I really want to be the man that you fell in love with again. And -- and I'll wait. Meg, I'll wait. I don't care how long it takes for -- for you to believe in me again. I'll wait. I swear I'll wait.",
        "Meg: You can't change, Paul. I'm in there helping a friend with a sprained ankle, and -- and all you see is -- I-I don't know -- whatever whacked-out, psycho thing you see. And you know what? I don't care what you say anymore. And I don't even care what you do, as long as you do it away from me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: So, the judge -- he didn't want you to talk to us. Did he say why?",
        "Nanny: I didn't talk to him. His lawyer called. Said I could get in trouble.",
        "Brad: Have you talked to the judge since the whole story broke? Does that surprise you?",
        "Nanny: You think I'm stupid, don't you?",
        "Katie: No, it's what you think that matters. I'm -- I'm sorry. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have for this morning, but we'd like to issue an invitation to Judge Burke -- come join us. We'll talk about family values. All right, that's it. Thank you so much.",
        "Brad: Thank you. You did great. Thank you.",
        "Kim: Excuse me, Miss Kranston, you have a phone call.",
        "Nanny: Judge Burke?",
        "Kim: Your parents.",
        "Katie: Okay, now, that makes me really sad.",
        "Brad: I don't know. She's young. Maybe she'll wise up.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I wasn't making the best choices at that age, either.",
        "Brad: You ended up married to me. It turned out to be a happy ending.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it did. Mmm, I'm just glad her parents called. At that age, you think you're so grown up, but you still really need your family. You were so good how you got her to come on the show.",
        "Brad: Thank you very much.",
        "Katie: I think we owe it to her now to stay in touch with her and make sure she gets another job and that she's okay.",
        "Brad: Do you know what you are? You are a secret nice person.",
        "Katie: Shh. It just gets me how young she is. Oh, my God, here's that girl from this morning. I'm sorry, you don't really --",
        "Liberty: I need to talk to you now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: So, Paul was in really bad shape last night, and I-I didn't think he should be alone.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, he was in such bad shape that you couldn't answer your phone.",
        "Sofie: My phone was off, Aaron. I'm -- I'm so sorry.",
        "Aaron: No, it's okay. You were doing a good thing.",
        "Sofie: You know, you have every right to be mad at me.",
        "Aaron: I'm not mad at you. I was just worried.",
        "Sofie: I'm fine.",
        "Aaron: No, you're not fine, because instead of living your life, you're playing best friends to a whack job.",
        "Sofie: Please don't talk about him like that.",
        "Aaron: Don't listen to me. Why don't you just ask my Aunt Meg? How about Rosanna?",
        "Sofie: Stop it. Stop it. He's been wonderful to me. He's been a real friend.",
        "Aaron: Okay, Sofie. You're very good at sizing men up.",
        "Sofie: I was worried. Losing Meg is killing him, and this morning he looked so awful, and he's not eating, and he's been drinking.",
        "Aaron: Are you telling me that you spent the night with him?",
        "Sofie: No. No, he didn't do anything wrong, and neither did I. You just want to think that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Kim and Barbara laugh]",
        "Kim: But I have to say, if you hadn't called me today, you were in very hot water.",
        "Barbara: Uh-oh. What did I do to get in your doghouse?",
        "Kim: Well, I didn't want to bug you, but you did tell me you had an appointment with your oncologist this week sometime and you were gonna call me afterwards.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I have nothing new to report.",
        "Kim: Hmm, isn't that funny? It's not what I heard.",
        "Barbara: I forget you have spies at the hospital, don't you?",
        "Kim: You bet I do, and he misses nothing. The chief of staff knows all. Once in a while he tells me. He says your oncologist is singing your praises. You're his prime, favorite patient.",
        "Barbara: He says that?",
        "Kim: He said that. He also said that your numbers are terrific and your attitude is even better. I am so proud of you. You're doing a great job.",
        "Barbara: You know, my surrogate mom here -- if they still make those little gold stars they used to put in our little charts when we were in kindergarten, I'm gonna find one and put your name on it.",
        "[Kim laughs]",
        "Kim: Good. I love those things. Okay, enough of that now. I want to hear the real stuff, no pretty pictures. Are you feeling stronger?",
        "Barbara: It comes and goes. Paul's taking very good care of me, though.",
        "Kim: Oh, well, he should. But he gets a gold star for that, too.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, I think I'll put one at the bottom of his thank-you note when I say good-bye.",
        "Kim: Why are you saying good-bye?",
        "Barbara: I think it's time that I come back to my own place. I have been coddled and pampered and taken care of, and -- and I think it's time that I reclaim my own life. I think I'm ready.",

        "Parker: Yeah, doctors -- they're always right.",
        "Holden: Faith, why don't you take the girls down to the cafeteria and get some hot chocolate, okay? Grab one for Parker.",
        "Faith: Carly, do you want anything?",
        "Carly: No, thank you, Sweetheart. I'm all right.",
        "Parker: I'm sorry, but this really wasn't my fault.",
        "Carly: I know. You don't have to apologize to me. It was an accident. Parker, I just wish that you'd be a little more careful, a little less impulsive.",
        "Parker: Like you?",
        "Carly: Yeah, like me. Oh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Honey.",

        "Sage: It's Parker. He got hurt falling off his skateboard. And he's gonna --",

        "Aaron: Okay, and you think its okay to spend the night at his house while he's drinking?",
        "Sofie: Okay, you know what? He told me to leave. I wouldn't.",
        "Aaron: Right, okay.",
        "Sofie: No, no. Look, Aaron, I am sorry I didn't call you. I am. But I am not sorry that I helped Paul. And, you know, I'm not gonna let you tell me who I can or can't be friends with.",
        "Aaron: No, because it -- it wouldn't work anyway, would it?",
        "Sofie: No, no.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, 'cause you don't take advice from guys like me. I'm just not your type.",
        "Sofie: Okay, you know what? I don't -- I don't want to talk about this anymore.",
        "Aaron: Good, 'cause we're not, because, you know, I just found something out. The way you're not gonna change Paul is the same as the way I'm not gonna change you.",
        "Sofie: That's right.",
        "Aaron: Good. So from now on, you're on your own.",

        "Parker: Hey, Dad. I fell off my skateboard, but I'm fine.",
        "Jack: Did he break anything?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I don't think so. We're waiting to hear from the doctor.",
        "Doctor: And the wait is over. If you could all step outside.",
        "Carly: Don't you think it's a little hypocritical for you to be so indignant? You're the one who gave him the skateboard in the first place.",
        "Jack: Maybe I'm a little mad 'cause my son's in the hospital and it never occurred to you to let me know about it.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe we should all wear ankle monitors. Then you'll be able to keep closer tabs on us.",
        "Jack: I know what you're doing, Carly.",
        "Carly: I'm trying to make sure that my son is okay.",
        "Jack: This is payback. You're mad at me, so you're trying to cut me out of my kids' lives.",
        "Carly: Oh, I am mad at you, but the last thing I would try to do is cut you off from our children.",
        "Jack: I think a trip to the hospital is something I should know about.",
        "Carly: I'm waiting to see how he is. Clearly this is not critical.",
        "Jack: Yes, but it's personal, Carly. The next time one of our children are hurt, I want to know about it.",
        "Carly: Thank you, Jack. I've had a great day so far. And you barking orders at me, you're really making it a hell of a lot better.",
        "Jack: What if it was something that I didn't tell you about?",
        "Holden: Or what if you just put a lid on it, Jack?",

        "Kim: You know, uh, I'm thrilled that you feel strong enough to live on your own again, but maybe you're rushing it a bit.",
        "Barbara: I will. I'll take it easy the first few days or so and -- you know, besides, if I -- if I wanted to get waited on, I can order room service. I'll have to pay for it, but --",
        "Kim: Well, what we need to do is have Lisa come up and ask for a special rate on medical grounds.",
        "Barbara: No, that's just the point. I don't want any special treatment anymore. Part of the reason I want to come to home is I just want -- I want to feel whole again.",
        "Kim: Okay. I understand. I know when you're -- when you're a patient, you feel like you've lost control of your life, right?",
        "Barbara: I just want to think about something else other than cancer for a change.",
        "Kim: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: I even have a yen to go back to work.",
        "Kim: Oh, wonderful. That's such a good idea. Get those creative juices going, design wonderful things.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'll have my creative juices going, but I won't be doing the designing. Sofie Duran will.",
        "Kim: You're kidding.",
        "Barbara: No. I don't think that anyone has any idea how talented she is. But believe me, they're gonna hear it from me.",
        "Kim: Well, isn't she lucky? Taking her under your wing.",
        "Barbara: Well, I've been lucky, too. She's taken very good care of me, made sure I've gotten to all of my treatments. And when I've been staying with Paul, she'll come over and see how I'm doing, though I think it's just an excuse to see Paul. She's developed quite a crush on him.",
        "Kim: Oh, really? How do you feel about that?",
        "Barbara: Well, I don't think Paul is over Meg Snyder. So I have been doing my best to steer her in a different direction. I just hope it's done some good.",

        "Paul: You're still here.",
        "Sofie: I came back. How did it go with Meg?",

        "Sofie: That good, huh?",
        "Paul: Yeah, that good.",
        "Sofie: Hey, so, I was hoping we could get some lunch or something --",
        "Paul: Sofie \u0096",
        "Sofie: 'Cause I don't think you're eating.",
        "Paul: Sofie -- listen. You're really sweet. And you're really -- you're really young. You need to go be sweet and young somewhere else.",
        "Sofie: You mean with my boyfriend?",
        "Paul: Yeah, go have some fun. That sounds like a great idea.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, it's unlikely. Aaron and I broke up.",

        "Doctor: Good news is it's just a sprain. Remember the drill?",
        "Meg: Yeah, thanks, Ben. Good to see you again.",

        "Mike: Don't want to talk about it?",
        "Meg: No, not really.",
        "Mike: Well, whether you like it or not, you're a natural. It's been a long time since someone's taken such good care of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, Aaron and I -- I guess we never really made it past the custody hearing.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Sofie: Yeah. It's not that I blame him, 'cause I don't, but it is kind of hard to be close.",
        "Paul: Sorry.",
        "Sofie: I'm sorry about Meg. We're a real pair, aren't we?",
