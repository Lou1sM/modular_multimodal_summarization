        "Henry: Waiter? Un autre cocktail, s'il vous plait.",
        "Katie: You might wanna hold off on that, Henry. We've got work to do. Sorry I'm so late. I didn't know Cicero was so far away.",
        "Henry: Cicero? Why were you doing in Cicero? And don't tell me that you went to buy a grocery stand.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. I was shopping at one of the largest electronic surveillance stores in the Midwest. And wait till you see what I bought. Tiny little cameras, tiny little microphones --",
        "Henry: And these would be to get us into a tiny bit of trouble?",
        "Katie: Henry, why are you always so suspicious of me?",
        "Henry: Oh, I don't know, Katie. Maybe it's because you once marooned me on a desert island with a man who makes Bigfoot look like Pierce Bronson.",
        "Katie: That was a long time ago. This is gonna be completely different.",
        "Henry: Yeah, you're right. I know. Because I don't want any part of it, all right?",
        "Katie: Don't be such a wuss, Henry. All I need you to do is use this equipment to find out how Pilar is going to hurt Mike.",
        "Henry: Forget it.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Henry: Because in case you haven't noticed, Pilar is usually one step ahead of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Excuse me, miss? A friend of mine left me a message, told me I'd meet her here. Her name is Pilar Domingo. Sorry, I don't mean to bother \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I don't understand. What do you think that I've done?",
        "Paul: You lied to me. You've kept things from me. This has been going on for awhile.",
        "Barbara: And here I thought I would never have to defend myself to you. Yet, you still think --",
        "Paul: Just stop. The wounded act is not working for me. Paul sighs] When I called your cell phone, Walker Daniels answered, he said that you were at Metro. But you weren't at Metro, were you? I mean, not yet, anyway.",
        "Barbara: And that's why you're upset?",
        "Paul: I want to know where you were. I wanna know what you were doing. I want to know why he lied about it.",
        "Barbara: I went to see Will.",
        "Paul: You what?",
        "Barbara: I know, I know. He's not allowed family visits yet. But Walker has a friend who works at the hospital, and so I went into an observation room. I watched him from behind a one-way mirror. He didn't even know I was there.",
        "Paul: How did he look?",
        "Barbara: Vacant -- very lost -- I mean, I don't know if it was better for me that I saw him, or worse.",
        "Paul: We're losing our way here. Why did you give Jordan Sinclair authority to make purchases on your behalf at B.R.O.?",
        "Barbara: How do you know about that?",
        "Paul: It's my company. I make a point to knowing when someone's trying to take it away from me.",
        "Barbara: I'm not trying to do that.",
        "Paul: Sure you are. I mean, yeah, working with me was fun for awhile, but now you'd rather work with somebody that you can control.",
        "Barbara: Paul, you are my son. You have my commitment.",
        "Paul: You've been married I don't even know how many times. You say that you love your children, and then you refuse to see them. I don't think commitment means a whole lot to you.",
        "Barbara: Wait. Stop right now! You don't even know what you're talking about. Everything I have done has been for my children.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Well, I guess this isn't a business dinner any more.",
        "Jennifer: You're okay with that, right? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to --",
        "Jordan: No, no, no, no. Jen, don't apologize. You're an intelligent, beautiful, sexy woman. I would love nothing more than to get closer to you.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that's exactly how I feel.",
        "Jordan: But there is a problem. We work for the same company. We're around your mother and your brother all day long. We wouldn't survive that, Jen. It would be doomed from the start.",
        "Jennifer: Are you sure that's the only problem?",
        "Jordan: What else would it be?",
        "Jennifer: Rosanna Cabot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: It's done. Cabot motors has agreed to sponsor the B.R.O. Fashion show in Las Vegas.",
        "Carly: Just like that?",
        "Rosanna: Just like that. Well, when the head of a corporation calls the publicity department herself, I think her suggestions should be taken seriously.",
        "Carly: Got it. Well, how does that keep Jennifer Munson away from Jordan?",
        "Rosanna: My director of publicity has a thing for Jennifer Munson. He's seen her model several times. He has a picture of her up on the wall in his office. She's the only one at B.R.O. That he will deal with, at least that's what we'll tell Jennifer.",
        "Carly: Oh -- it's a little too obvious for me. Especially after you just broke up Jennifer's date with Jordan.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I know. I admit that could be a problem. But that's where you come in.",
        "Carly: No. No, no. I think this is where I get out.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no, no, no. Your suggestion will be taken seriously in this regard. All you have to do is sell Barbara on the sponsorship idea, and then convince her to sell Jennifer.",
        "Carly: That's an awful lot of selling, don't you think?",
        "Rosanna: Come on, you can do it. You can do it with your hands tied behind your back. Then, once everything is set, Jennifer will be off on her way to Detroit, and Jordan will be open to other distractions. Come on, you have to do it. You have to help me.",
        "Carly: You know who you remind me of now? Me.",
        "Rosanna: Is that good or bad?",
        "Carly: Truthfully? Frightening.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: I don't know where this is coming from. There's nothing going on between Rosanna and me.",
        "Jennifer: Rosanna drives into a ditch tonight and the only person on earth she can think of to call is you?",
        "Jordan: She didn't want to file an accident report -- there were legal issues involved.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, Rosanna has enough lawyers on her payroll to rewrite the entire constitution. Why wouldn't she call them?",
        "Jordan: She had her reasons.",
        "Jennifer: Right. She'd prefer to roll around in the mud with you.",
        "Jordan: Now, that was a complete accident.",
        "Jennifer: Just like it was an accident that Carly came over here with some bogus story about her fit model suddenly being unavailable. It's a setup, Jordan. Rosanna has her hooks out for you.",
        "Jordan: She's my friend. That's all I can say.",
        "Jennifer: If Rosanna was your friend, she would've left you alone tonight. She would have called someone from her staff.",
        "Jordan: Well, I'm not going to defend her anymore. Rosanna is not the issue here.",
        "Jennifer: You're right. You're right. The issue is me, throwing myself at you. Well, you're not gonna have to worry about that anymore, because I will never do it again.",
        "Jordan: Jen, please. Try to understand. I'm an outsider in a family business. There are too many obstacles.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, I've seen you when you want something. Obstacles don't stop you.",
        "Jordan: Your brother hates me. He's already fired me once!",
        "Jennifer: Okay, enough. Okay? I'm not going to argue with you about whether -- how'd you put it? Whether we get close or not. But I will tell you this -- if you weren't interested in me, you shouldn't have flirted.",
        "Jordan: I am interested in you. From the second I saw you, I --",
        "Jennifer: You knew I was Barbara Ryan's daughter, and that making nice to me would get you in good with the new boss.",
        "Jordan: That's not fair.",
        "Jennifer: To you or to me?",
        "Jordan: Jen, I wish things could be different. But, your mother really needs me right now, and I can't give your brother any reason to want me gone.",
        "Jennifer: You could always go work for Rosanna. Although, I don't think they have business cards for what you'd be doing for her.",
        "Jordan: Thanks for cooking dinner. I'm sorry things turned out the way they did.",
        "Jennifer: Wait, Jordan -- [Door shuts] Brilliant, Jen -- just brilliant.",
        "[Jen sobs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm sorry if I frighten you. But nothing is going to stop me when it comes to saving Cabot.",
        "Carly: I understand how you feel, Rosanna. I mean, I think I understand how you feel. But you have to admit, this is getting a little strange. Isn't it?",
        "Rosanna: Is it? How do you mean?",
        "Carly: Well, Jennifer Munson seems to be a nice girl, you know? And she's genuinely interested in Jordan. And you're sending her off to Detroit like she's some kind of canned ham.",
        "[Rosanna scoffs]",
        "Rosanna: She's a young girl. She'll have plenty of men before she's through.",
        "Carly: What if they had a real chance, you know? What right do you have to get involved in their relationship?",
        "Rosanna: I'm not going to stand here and argue ethics when my son's well-being is at stake.",
        "Carly: Okay. All right. Maybe if you'd finally, finally, finally would tell me why marrying Jordan has anything to do with Cabot --",
        "Rosanna: I can't. I can't. I've already told you too much.",
        "Carly: I know, you've already told me too much. I know, you've been saying it all along. But you are asking me to just follow you blindly, without knowing where I'm going, or why I'm going there.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I am.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Carly: Sisters.",
        "Rosanna: Well, now that we've got that settled, you wanna go find Barbara and tell her the good news about the fashion show?",
        "Carly: Yes, okay. I'll get right on it.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: What are you doing? How come you're mopping the floors?",
        "Pilar: It's my job, Michael. That's what maids are supposed to do.",
        "Mike: You're a maid? Since when?",
        "Pilar: This afternoon. I needed a place to stay and I worked out a deal with the manager.",
        "Mike: So, you came back to this -- ? Pilar, this is crazy.",
        "Pilar: It's what I can afford. And I'm fine with that. But I thought you might be worried about me, so I asked you here to see for yourself that I'm okay.",
        "Manager: I remember you. The guy who was looking for Russ Terry.",
        "Mike: Yeah, that was me.",
        "Manager: You looking for a room?",
        "Mike: Talking to Pilar.",
        "Manager: Well, keep it short. She's got work to do. When you're through in here, my office needs dusting.",
        "Pilar: Okay. This shouldn't take long.",
        "Manager: Make sure it doesn't. I'll be waiting.",
        "Mike: That's only going to get worse.",
        "Pilar: What?",
        "Mike: The manager coming on to you.",
        "Pilar: I can handle him, Michael.",
        "Mike: Yeah, but why should you have to?",
        "Pilar: I'm sorry you don't approve. But I'm doing the best I can. Since the moment I arrived in Oakdale, I've made one mistake after another. And I don't want to make another one, Michael. That's why I have to stay away from you.",
        "Mike: I understand. Doesn't mean I have to like it, but --",
        "Pilar: I'm not trying to get you to love me anymore. All I want now is your respect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Pilar bragged to me that she was planning on killing Mike, and at first I was stumped. I thought, \"Why would she admit to something that she knows I'm suspecting her of?\" And then it hit me. She wanted me to run to Mike with the news. So, she could say, \"oh, Michael, I don't know why Katie is accusing me of such horrible things.\" And then Mike would get mad at me, and cut me out of his life, and she would have a full shot at him.",
        "Henry: Okay, except Mike already is angry with you and he already has cut you out of his life.",
        "Katie: That's not the point. This is her plan, and we have to stop her.",
        "Henry: Okay, I'm game. How do we stop her?",
        "Katie: Easy. Instead of telling Mike what Pilar is up to, we let Pilar tell him herself.",
        "[Henry hums]",
        "Henry: Which is why we got the tiny little equipment.",
        "Katie: Exactly. All you have to do is plant this equipment in Mike's house, and sooner or later, Pilar will tell us, and him, exactly what we want to know.",
        "Henry: You know, in theory that is a great plan.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Henry: In reality, it is last week's clam chowder.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Henry: Because, I followed her sultriness today as you requested. And she's left Mike and checked into the Wagon Wheel Motel. Where she's also gotten a job as a maid.",
        "Katie: Why would she do that?",
        "Henry: I have no idea. But it does poke a few holes in your theory. Don't you think?",
        "Katie: No, it's still part of the same plan. She wants Mike to feel sorry for her so he is off guard. And then when he's not looking, she closes in on him.",
        "Henry: You planning on telling Mike about this?",
        "Katie: Maybe. I don't know. What am I supposed to do?",
        "Henry: I don't know, Katie. I really don't. But you know what? We've been at this a long time.",
        "Katie: And what? You think we should quit?",
        "Henry: Well, the idea does have some appeal. Hmm?",
        "Katie: If you have something to say, Henry, just come out and say it.",
        "Henry: I don't want to help you anymore.",
        "Katie: So what am I supposed to do? Just sit back and let Pilar kill Mike?",
        "Henry: It's not your problem. [Katie sighs] And the idea of you behind bars -- you, the eternal hummingbird, being locked up with women who mix their mojitos with motor oil -- it's just not something I want to see.",
        "Katie: You really are worried about me, aren't you?",
        "Henry: I mean, forgive me for having a Debby Boone moment her, but her immortal words do come to mind.",
        "Katie: Don't say it.",
        "Henry: Well, it's true.",
        "Katie: Thank you. You're very sweet.",
        "Henry: Good.",
        "Katie: But that's just the guy you are.",
        "Henry: Does this mean you'll let mike take care of himself?",
        "Katie: Yes, it does.",
        "Henry: And that you'll hire a lawyer and take these charges against you seriously?",
        "Katie: Absolutely.",
        "Henry: Incredible. I've actually had a good influence on someone. Waiter! [Henry laughs]",
        "Katie: You know, having Pilar at the Wagon Wheel makes this a lot easier.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Katie: We don't have to rent a van. We can just stash this equipment in the room next to hers.",
        "Henry: You haven't heard a word I've said, have you?",
        "Katie: Absolutely, I have. And I promise I will get legal advice. Just as soon as I nail Pilar. So, I'd better get going. I'll meet you back here in a couple of hours.",
        "Henry: Hey --",
        "Mike: Can you at least let me buy you dinner? Something cheap -- no tablecloths.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: Michael, I can't. They're hearing Russ's case in night court and I have to be there.",
        "Mike: I'm not sure that's such a good idea.",
        "Pilar: I need to look him in the eye. I want him to see that I'm not afraid to testify against him.",
        "Mike: I pretty much know the answer to this, but do you want me to go with you?",
        "Pilar: I have to do it alone.",
        "Mike: You've got a lot of guts, you know that?",
        "Pilar: I'm working on it. I'd better get to Lyle's office if I'm going to finish cleaning before I go to court.",
        "Mike: Hey, hey. Be careful of that guy, okay?",
        "Pilar: Don't worry, I'm armed.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Mike: Hello?",
        "Henry: It's -- it's Henry Coleman. I'm down here at the Metro. I thought you might want to meet me for a little chat.",
        "Mike: I'm not interested, Henry. Bye.",
        "Henry: No, wait! Wait, wait, wait. It's very important, and it'll make your life a lot easier.",
        "Mike: You're not trying to sell me something, are you?",
        "Henry: Only peace of mind, my brother. I have the inside scoop on what Katie's going to do next. And I don't know, I thought you might like a heads-up.",
        "Mike: I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I can always tell when you're hiding something.",
        "Barbara: Okay, maybe I should have told you that I was planning to go see Will. Maybe it wasn't very smart of me to hire Carly without discussing it with you first --",
        "Paul: Was it smart to sign documents that give Jordan Sinclair secret powers?",
        "Barbara: Wait a second. I was trying to save time! We have a deadline. I was trying to cut out the red tape! Paul, honey, you and I built B.R.O. We can do it again. It's possible. We just have to work very, very hard, and make sure that this show in Las Vegas is the biggest success that B.R.O. has ever had, and then these problems are going to disappear.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Carly: Is it a bad time?",
        "Paul: It's getting there, yeah.",
        "Carly: Look, I realize that we haven't spoken since I started at B.R.O., but I'm looking for Barbara --",
        "Paul: Well, you came to the right place. Mommy, your resident genius is here.",
        "Barbara: Hi, Carly, I assume this is about business.",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. I just heard about an opportunity, which I thought is very exciting. Of course, I can't approve of it myself.",
        "Paul: Right, so you decided to go right around me and straight to Barbara.",
        "Carly: No, Paul, that's not what I was thinking at all.",
        "Barbara: You know, maybe we should discuss this in the morning, Carly.",
        "Paul: I want to hear this great idea. The both of us here together. You and me, Barbara. Just like it old times -- only different.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Jordan. Hi, what are you doing here? I thought you were having dinner with Jennifer.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, we ended up cutting it short.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope it wasn't because you came and helped me.",
        "Jordan: It was a lot of things.",
        "Rosanna: Oh -- well, listen, I've already thanked you for coming to my rescue. But I'd like to do more than that.",
        "Jordan: No, really that's not necessary. Thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Everybody has this little gift that they really want but they're afraid to buy for themselves. Well, I would like to buy you that gift. So you just tell me whatever it is --",
        "Jordan: I don't want any gifts, Rosanna. But I would love to know the real reason you called me tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: I will tell you everything what went through my head when I rolled into the ditch. [Rosanna sighs] First, I checked myself to make sure that I wasn't bleeding. And then I did pick up the phone to call my assistant. Only I hung up. Because what I really needed was a friend.",
        "Jordan: And I was the only number in your phone book?",
        "Rosanna: Well, no. You know, what I've a rough year. I've been forced to give up my adopted child. I've had to divorce my husband. I've ended a relationship with a man I thought was my best friend.",
        "Jordan: Well, Paul doesn't deserve your friendship, not after what he did.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you. I don't really want to get into it. Except to say that you have been the one bright spot in what has otherwise a really bad year for me. So although I could call other friends, you're the person I really wanted to see.",
        "Jordan: I wasn't complaining. I just wanted to know.",
        "Rosanna: Any other questions?",
        "Jordan: No.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then would you mind if I joined you for dinner? Because it's been a pretty hectic day, I haven't had much time to eat.",
        "Jordan: I would love that. And in the meantime -- why don't you help yourself?",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You have got to be kidding me. Rosanna wants to sponsor the show?",
        "Carly: She felt an influx of cash would push us over the top.",
        "Barbara: Well, that goes without saying. But why she give a damn about our success?",
        "Carly: Well, people who follow fashion shows also buy cars. Of course she wants the Cabot Motors logo on the stage and on the programs.",
        "Barbara: Of course, but there are a lot of other tie-ins that will give her just as much publicity.",
        "Carly: Well, all right. She does have an ulterior motive.",
        "Paul: I'm shocked!",
        "Carly: She wants the show to do well, because she wants lots of people to see my designs.",
        "Paul: Well, nominate her for sibling of the year.",
        "Carly: There's just one small catch. There's a guy in the publicity department at Cabot Motors who has sort of a thing for Jennifer. He's seen her model a couple of times. He's got a picture of her in his office. Rosanna thinks that it might be a good idea if she is a contact at B.R.O.",
        "Barbara: Well, that will work. I'm sure Jen will do her part.",
        "Carly: Really? I mean, she'd have to fly to Detroit tomorrow, and she might have to stay for a couple of days. And of course, there might be trips down the road.",
        "Barbara: Well, you know, Jen has been in Oakdale for months now. I'm sure a change of scenery would do her well.",
        "Carly: So, you'll make sure she says yes?",
        "Barbara: I will get right on it. In fact, you know, I'm going to call Rosanna right now and thank her. Unless you think it's too late for me to be calling her.",
        "Carly: I do. I do think that it's too late. Why don't you wait 'til the morning?",
        "Barbara: I will do that. And I'll send her a basket of muffins. And we won't have to worry about anything. Do you know that? Carly -- I knew that hiring you was a smart idea. I just didn't know how right I was. [Barbara laughs]",
        "Carly: I guess I should be going, too.",
        "Paul: Not so fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Manager: Mind telling me what you're doing here?",
        "Katie: Oh, hi. You're the manager?",
        "Manager: And you're the broad with the baseball bat.",
        "Katie: Good memory.",
        "Manager: Get out.",
        "Katie: You know, that whole baseball bat thing was just a huge mistake.",
        "Manager: Cops didn't think so. I hear you're looking at assault charges.",
        "Katie: Yes, but that's only because I couldn't tell them the real reason I was here.",
        "Manager: Which is what?",
        "Katie: One of your employees could become the luckiest girl in the world.",
        "Katie: I am the associate producer of a new reality show called, \"The Maid and the Millionaire.\"",
        "Manager: That why you were beating that guy with a baseball bat?",
        "Katie: Kind of -- we have to do things like that so people don't get suspicious.",
        "Manager: Suspicious of what?",
        "Katie: Well, one of your maids has been chosen to go out on a blind date with Anton von Casey.",
        "Manager: Who's that?",
        "Katie: You've never heard of him? Oh, he's only one of the hottest and richest bachelors in the country.",
        "Manager: Yeah?",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm, umm, so this is how it works. Uh, one of your maids will be set up on a date with him by one of her friends, who's working for us. And when she opens the door she'll recognize Anton right away, and get to all watch her freak out.",
        "Manager: Sounds terrible.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, no, no. It could be a lot of fun. So all I'm gonna need from you is access to this room, and one next to it so that we can set up all of our equipment.",
        "Manager: You mean, the maid is Pilar?",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, that's right. Pilar -- what is it? Domingo?",
        "Manager: Yeah. And I gotta tell you. I don't know if I want Pilar going out with some playboy who's gonna break her heart.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, if you think about this, he might fall in love with her and ask her to marry him. You wouldn't want to stand in the way of that, would you? And, besides, you'll be very generously compensated, and we have some lovely parting gifts.",
        "Manager: I still gotta think about it. You mind?",
        "Katie: You know, I understand your hesitation. But, um, we only have Anton for one night, so --",
        "Manager: If he's so rich, tell him to buy himself some more time.",

        "Henry: Well, uh, right now, she's working on, um -- you know, I can't be very specific.",
        "Mike: Then why the hell am I here?",
        "Henry: Because I want you to know what's behind all the craziness. She's still in love with you.",
        "Mike: I'm not going to listen to this.",
        "Henry: Mike, listen. She is, she is, okay? And that's why you two need to sit down, alone, and see if you can work your ways back together.",
        "Mike: Katie's in love with Simon.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on, Simon's an obsession, all right. Katie's had hundreds of obsessions. But with you it's different. She feels something different for you. It's the real thing. It's, it's -- it inspires people to write poetry.",
        "Mike: We've had so many chances. What's gonna be different about this time?",
        "Henry: Maybe nothing. But the two of you have been talking at each other for months, and no one's been listening. Try listening, Mike. Give it one last chance.",

        "Barbara: What happened?",
        "Jennifer: Nothing much. I threw myself at him and he turned me down.",
        "Barbara: What? Honey, I have seen the way he looks at you. He's interested.",
        "Jennifer: Not anymore. He's got someone else now -- Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Jennifer: Her car broke down tonight and who do you think she called?",
        "Barbara: She is barely out of her marriage to Craig.",
        "Jennifer: I guess she thinks that Jordan can help her forget about that. The worst thing mom, I was totally uncool about it. I got angry and spiteful, and Jordan left.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I'm sorry. I know what high hopes you had for this evening.",
        "Jennifer: You should've heard some of the things I said to him. How am I gonna face him at work?",
        "Barbara: Well, you don't have to.",
        "Jennifer: You're not going to fire him, are you?",
        "Barbara: No, no, not on your life. But something came up tonight. Something that I think is going to be just what you need, and will maybe even make Mr. Jordan Sinclair realize what a fool he is.",

        "Carly: I shouldn't stay. Sage is feeling under the weather --",
        "Paul: This'll only take a second, and I -- you have to help me.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Paul: I am really confused. I mean, so much has happened so quickly, and I just feel like I've lost control of everything.",
        "Carly: Then tell me what's wrong.",
        "Paul: I know that you backed out of our plan to force Barbara out of B.R.O.",
        "Carly: Yes, I explained that.",
        "Paul: Right, Rosanna didn't want you to have anything to do with me.",

        "Paul: Can I finish?",
        "Carly: Sure. Go ahead.",

        "Carly: I know. I'm sorry. You should've heard it from me.",
        "Paul: And now, all of a sudden, Rosanna decides that she wants to fund the Vegas show for B.R.O., because she wants my company to do well. I mean, you can see why this would mess with my head a little bit! Can't you see that Carly?",
        "Carly: Yeah, just -- you have to believe me when I tell you that this is all happening for a very, very good reason.",
        "Paul: A good reason for who? Rosanna? Who would like nothing better than to see me run over by one of her overpriced cars?",
        "Carly: No, no, her decision has nothing to do with you, at all.",
        "Paul: She's trying to destroy me! I don't know how yet, but I'm going to it out, and when I figure it out, Carly --",

        "Pilar: What did she look like?",
        "Manager: Blonde -- cute -- button nose -- the same broad who smacked Russ Terry with the baseball bat.",
        "Pilar: I had no idea she'd go this far.",
        "Manager: You know her?",
        "Pilar: I'm afraid so.",
        "Manager: Well, don't worry, I'll get rid of her next time she comes by. And as for bugging your room -- not gonna happen.",
        "Pilar: Actually, I want you to let her do it.",
        "Manager: You do? Why?",
        "Pilar: Oh, it's just this silly game we've been playing. But you can't let her know that you've told me about it, Lyle. Okay? Pretty please?",

        "Katie: Oh, are we supposed to talk to each other? Again? Because talking obviously hasn't been working.",

        "Jordan: Well, sounds pretty good, but shouldn't you save it for a special occasion?",
        "Rosanna: What's not special about tonight? Can I ask you a personal question?",
        "Jordan: Well, I guess that would depend on the question.",
        "Rosanna: Growing up without parents must've been extremely difficult. And yet you have an air of confidence about you that's -- well, practically unshakable. Did you lave a mentor who helped you with that?",
        "Jordan: It's all just an act. Inside, I'm a quivering mass of fear and insecurity.",

        "Rosanna: Well that's terrific. Then we're all set. Did you happen to mention how we saw Jennifer fitting in?",
        "Carly: Uh, yes. Barbara just called me on the way over. She said Jennifer's that willing to work with your publicity department, so she'll be on a plane to Detroit tomorrow morning.",

        "Rosanna: All right, very impressive. I guess I'll save this for next time.",
        "Jordan: You know, everything I've ever read about you talks about how tough you are. But helping Carly out like this, and B.R.O., You definitely have a softer side.",
        "Rosanna: Well, let's keep that our little secret, huh? Good night, Jordan. Now that I'm going to be involved in the fashion show, I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of each other.",

        "Paul: You did this to me.",
        "Rosanna: That's right. And you deserve so much worse.",
