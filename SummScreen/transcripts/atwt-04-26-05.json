        "Jen packs her belongings to move out of Mike's house, but as she is leaving Mike arrives home. He pleads with her to change her mind, but Jen cannot subject Mike to a lifetime of Craig. Jen is adamant that she has to choose a path that gives her baby a fighting chance against Craig, and she has to protect her baby from Craig, and all of that means a life without Mike, and she leaves. Katie finally finds Henry at the gym, after having spent the night in his car, and pleads with him to give her another chance, but Henry has had it. Henry truly believes Katie is simply in love with the way he loves her. She asks what she can do to show him. Henry asks her to look him in the face and tell him she no longer loves Mike. Katie cannot do that, because she says a part of her will always love Mike. She admits that she used to wonder everyday what could have been with Mike, but now those thoughts are much less frequent, and it is because her feelings for Henry are now more important. She tries to kiss Henry, but Henry cannot do it, and he turns away. With that, an emotional Katie sets off telling him she will bring him proof to show him how much he means to her. Later, she searches out Mike, and when he tells her Jen moved out, Katie tells him not to take it lying down, and that she will help him win Jen back. Lily and Keith are teaming up to make sure Les pays for Julia's murder, and as they continue to work together, they grow closer. Lucinda meets with Jessica to find out what is going on with Lily and Keith. She wonders if Keith is not with Lily for her money. Jessica tells Lucinda that if the evidence against Les falls through, the police may start to look at Lily again as a suspect. Lucinda also wonders if that would benefit Keith as well, because she feels something is not right with him. When Lucinda then suggest to Jessica she not allow Les to get off, Jessica gives back her check saying morally she cannot throw her own case. After Lucinda leaves she walks in on a close moment between Lily and Keith at Lily's house. Carly is dealing with nightmares about Les and guilt feelings over believing she didn't do enough to help JJ, and when Jack comes home to accompany her to the Police Station to give her statement regarding Les, he finds her waking from a nightmare sleeping with a bat. He becomes more concerned about her, and questions her. Carly averts his questions by telling him they will be late to go to the station. Later at the station, Jack is sidelined talking to Tom about the evidence Ben found suggesting Julia might have died from a constricted throat instead of a head trauma. While waiting for Jack who is talking to Tom, a police officer tells Carly to wait in the interrogation room to make her statement. She goes to wait in the room, but once the door closes, she realizes she is not alone, and turns around to find Les blocking the door."

        "Jennifer: Mike.",
        "Katie: You had a talk with Henry? When? Oh. No, no, I appreciate it. Sisters don't come any better than you. I don't know how much good it did, though, because he didn't come home last night. No, I know. I'll let you know when I hear anything. Thank you. I know, I love you, too. Bye. [Katie sighs] Henry, why won't you answer your stupid phone? Who is there? We're not even supposed to be open yet. Hello? I said, who's there? Hello? All right, I'm giving you one last chance to get out here and tell me who you are.",
        "[Katie gasps]",
        "Henry: I hope that's not a commentary on my bodybuilding.",
        "Katie: Henry! Oh, I knew you'd come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: You need to lean on the cops and have them go over to Sweeny's halfway house and search it again.",
        "Tom: Really? On what grounds?",
        "Keith: On the grounds that I might have I missed something.",
        "Tom: Oh, during your unauthorized and highly illegal search? You're lucky somebody didn't bring you in for trespassing.",
        "Keith: I found evidence.",
        "Tom: You found nothing. It wouldn't stand up in a kangaroo court.",
        "Keith: Kangaroo court, huh? I found a phone with my sister's blood all over it. That means nothing?",
        "Tom: Not when it winds up in the hands of the victim's brother, who, by the way, has been harboring a long-term resentment towards the guy in whose room the phone was allegedly found. Now, if there had been a cop there, a licensed P.I., Maybe --",
        "Lily: Oh, what about me?",
        "Tom: What about you?",
        "Lily: I can vouch for Keith. I was there. The district attorney here could care less about solving my sister's murder.",
        "Tom: Let me tell you something, my friend. It's tough to uncover the truth when well-meaning people like you get in the way of the cops.",
        "Keith: Yeah, well, I'd like to be able to tell my nephew that his mother's killer is going to jail.",
        "Tom: Understood. We cannot rewrite the law. There are channels we need to go through. Let's start with you trusting the cops to do their job.",
        "Keith: Well, then, the cops should do their job and go back and search Sweeny's halfway house!",
        "Lily: Tom, please, you have to have a heart here. If, God forbid, your brother left a child orphan, are you telling me that you wouldn't do everything in your power to find out what happened? I don't think you'd give up any easier than Keith is. That's why he's pushing for this search. You would, too. Please.",
        "Tom: No promises. I'll do what I can.",
        "Lily: Thank you. What?",
        "Keith: I thought you were going to stay out of this.",
        "Lily: I thought you were going back to Chicago.",
        "Keith: Well, I -- I changed my mind. But it doesn't mean that you have to pick up my crusade.",
        "Lily: I'm sticking with you until we get to the bottom of this. I'm not going anywhere until Les Sweeny is put behind bars. For good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly dreaming] Carly: Jack, I knew you'd come back. [Carly gasps] What are you doing here?",
        "Les: Well, you and me, we're old friends, remember? Hmm, let me just put that away before you hurt somebody with that.",
        "Carly: Jack's coming back.",
        "Les: Yeah, that's what you said last time.",
        "Carly: He'll be here any second.",
        "Les: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. But he didn't come back, did he? Jack ain't coming back, Carly. I'm coming back, though. Again and again and again --",
        "Carly: No. No! No! No!",
        "Jack: Baby, are you all right? [Carly gasps] Carly?",
        "Carly: Wow, I guess -- I guess I was dreaming.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I guess you were. You wanna talk about it?",
        "Carly: No. No, I can hardly remember what the dream was now.",
        "Jack: What are you doing down here anyway?",
        "Carly: I was trying to stay awake. You know, doctor's orders. I came down here to watch some TV and I guess I dozed off.",
        "Jack: Holding this?",
        "Carly: What are you doing here anyway, Jack? Shouldn't you be at the station by now?",
        "Jack: Now, we were going to go in together, remember? Since you're giving your statement about Les.",
        "Carly: Right. I wonder why I pushed that lovely event to the back of my mind.",
        "Jack: I can understand you not wanting to drag it up again, honey --",
        "Carly: You don't have to talk me into it, Jack. I know what I have to do. I know that I cannot let Les get away with what he did to J.J.",
        "Jack: What about what he did to you?",
        "Carly: Who cares about me? I'm the one who blew it. I should have done something to keep him from taking J.J. I should have done something more to stop him!",
        "J.J.: You did stop him. You saved me, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: You know --",
        "Lily: Oh, thank you.",
        "Keith: You should forget about my problems and focus on the people that you care about.",
        "Lily: Who says I'm not?",
        "Keith: Okay, you know, whatever this thing is that you think you owe me, you don't.",
        "Lily: You helped get the charges against me dropped.",
        "Keith: Yeah, and you got me into Sweeny's halfway house, so we're even.",
        "Lily: That may be so, but who's going to even the score for what Les did to Carly and J.J?",
        "Keith: Look, you're not responsible for what Sweeny did to anybody.",
        "Lily: Well, I wish that were true. But, realistically, if I hadn't pled guilty to Julia's murder, then the cops could have been looking for her real killer. So, I have to do this. I don't have a choice.",
        "Keith: Okay. If I can't talk you out of this --",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Keith: I want you to know, things could get ugly, though.",
        "Lily: Last week, I was facing 20 to life in a federal prison? I can handle ugly.",
        "Keith: I bet you can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: What does Mr. Morrisey want from Lily?",
        "Jessica: Well, what makes you think he wants something? Maybe this ordeal with Julia's murder has created some kind of bond between them.",
        "Lucinda: The only bond he's interested in is one with multiple zeroes.",
        "Jessica: You think Keith is after Lily's money?",
        "Lucinda: Well, is that so inconceivable?",
        "Jessica: No, but it wouldn't be my first assumption. Maybe he simply likes her.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. I don't trust him. I just don't trust him. I'm going on instinct here. And I do trust my instincts.",
        "Jessica: And you suspect Keith is using lily to frame Les Sweeny?",
        "Lucinda: Now that it has been said aloud -- do you think that Les is telling the truth when he claimed he's being set up?",
        "Jessica: Well, I don't put a lot of faith in clients' claims. I put my faith in the facts. And the fact is the phone that Keith found in Les's room came back clean.",
        "Lucinda: And doesn't it seem odd to you? I mean, that the phone would be found at such an opportune time?",
        "Jessica: Are you suggesting Keith planted the phone?",
        "Lucinda: I never said that.",
        "Jessica: Neither did I. But I will say this. If you're convinced Les is innocent, and you do help in clearing him, there's a good chance that suspicion could turn right back on Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I called everywhere looking for you. If that was some kind of test to see if I would miss you if you stayed out all night, you were very successful. 'Cause I missed you like crazy. Why aren't you wearing any clothes?",
        "Henry: Ah, I never dress 'til after my morning shower.",
        "Katie: You slept here last night?",
        "Henry: No, but I should have. You know, because despite the soft -- butter- soft Corinthian leather, my seat's about a foot short.",
        "Katie: You hate me that much that you'd rather sleep in your limo than in our bed?",
        "Henry: I don't hate you. I'm the opposite of hating you.",
        "Katie: Then why? Why didn't you come home?",
        "Henry: I needed time to think.",
        "Katie: And did you?",
        "Henry: Incessantly.",
        "Katie: Okay, good. Glad you got that out of your system. When are you going to come home?",
        "Henry: I'm sorry, bubbles, I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I was going to call you. I -- I really wanted to spare you this, Mike. I tried to come by early, 'cause I thought then you would be working.",
        "Mike: I was supposed to bid on a new project, but I canceled that. I needed a personal day.",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry, Mike. I wanted to get my things out as soon as possible.",
        "Mike: Did I tell you I was in a hurry?",
        "Jennifer: No, but it's better for you if I --",
        "Mike: No, you know what? Don't.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Mike: Stop making assumptions about what's best for me.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, I thought that when we talked yesterday, that we were okay.",
        "Mike: You thought we were okay?",
        "Jennifer: Not that we were okay, but that we came to some understanding about why this is necessary.",
        "Mike: Right. Everything running smoothly at Street Jeans?",
        "Jennifer: Actually, it's not running at all. Dusty closed it down.",
        "Mike: Closed it down? Why'd he do that?",
        "Jennifer: He found out I'd left town without leaving a forwarding address and decided to pull the plug.",
        "Mike: Without even trying to track you down? That's not legal. He can't pull that out from underneath you. This company's your life. Look, you gotta track down an attorney, Jen.",
        "Jennifer: You see? This is exactly why I don't think that we should be together!",
        "Mike: Because I care about you? I stick up for you?",
        "Jennifer: No, because you feel like it's your obligation to fix my messes! All right? And you deserve your own life, Mike. You deserve to be happy, I want you to move on!",
        "Mike: Okay, what about what I want? How many times do I have to tell you this? I don't want to move on.",
        "Jennifer: But yesterday --",
        "Mike: No, no, no. Yesterday was insane. Come on. We throw some stuff in a suitcase, we get on a plane, we stumble into a chapel and we're two seconds away from saying our \"I dos\" and Craig shows up. Now you think that's a good time to be making a life-altering decision?",
        "Jennifer: I was -- I'm just trying to face the facts.",
        "Mike: No, no. You let some guy come in, blow smoke about his rights and his baby, and his this and his that. That has to do with him, Jen, not us. But you got so freaked out by all the threats you end up saying that we need to break up because it's what's best for me.",
        "Jennifer: And you don't think I meant it?",
        "Mike: You tell me.",
        "Mike: Oh, that is it, isn't it? You don't think you deserve to be happy. That's why you've been making everything about Mike. You know, what's this pregnancy going to do to Mike? What happens when Craig shows up? What's that gonna do to Mike?",
        "Jennifer: Well, you know, maybe I just don't deserve any more happiness than I've already had. You know, maybe I used up my share when I fell in love with you.",
        "Mike: You've gotta stop torturing yourself. Okay, you made a mistake. Let it go. Baby, if we have each other, we are stronger than Craig could ever be. We can figure this out, I'm telling you. All right? We'll just take it one day at a time. We can learn as we go.",
        "Jennifer: And what about the part that I don't have any control over? When Craig launches his war to have a piece of this baby. Being scared doesn't cover half of what I'm feeling.",
        "Mike: Okay. Look, I know I seem like I got it all figured out all the time, but I don't. All right, I'm lost, too. I probably should have told you this before, but -- I'm just as scared as you are.",
        "Jennifer: You are?",
        "Mike: Yeah. So, how about you and me just be scared together?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You know, when you didn't come home last night, a lot of things went through my mind. Do you remember our wedding?",
        "Henry: Is that a serious question?",
        "Katie: Because I remember it so clearly, every moment. I remember standing in front of our makeshift altar, saying those wonderful vows and realizing for the first time how very much you love me.",
        "Henry: Well, it doesn't matter.",
        "Katie: Yes, yes, yes, it does. I've made so many mistakes in my life, especially with men. And when it's all said and done, you were the one who saved me from making anymore. Not Simon, not Mike. You. You taught me to see beyond what I thought I wanted, to see what was real. What -- what really matters? What's good for me? What lasts a lifetime? And that's you, Henry. It's always been you. I would miss you so much.",
        "Henry: Do you love me, Katie?",
        "Katie: Isn't that what I've been trying to tell you?",
        "Henry: No, I -- I think you love how much I love you. 'Cause everything you're saying, how you love to be cherished and safe -- it hits me right here. It does, because I want that, too. I want someone to make me feel the same way.",
        "Katie: And I can do that. I will. I promise. I know it took me a long time to get to this point, but I'm here now and I am so ready to give you all the wonderful things that you've given me. Please, Henry, just say you'll give us another chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Maybe that's what Morrisey wants. He's wants Lily to trust him so that if the case against Les falls through, you know, if push comes to shove, he's got Lily close to accuse. Isn't that what you were thinking, isn't it?",
        "Jessica: All I know is what was in the coroner's report. And the report says that Julia died from a blow to the head. And Lily has admitted pushing her.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Jessica: And if Les is cleared and Keith continues to push the state to prosecute, it's only natural that they would take another look at Lily's actions leading up to the murder.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Then we've gotta make certain that Les isn't cleared.",
        "Jessica: Wait a minute. First you hire me to defend him and now you want me to undermine my own case?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I wouldn't want to make Lily suspect number one all over again.",
        "Jessica: Well, be that as it may, Lucinda, I'm a defense attorney and it's my job --",
        "Lucinda: Well, wait a minute, let's not talk about ethics. Not when it comes to Les Sweeny. Now, you're on the job because I'm paying you, and as of this moment, the job description has changed.",
        "Jessica: Well, as of this moment, our agreement is null and void.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: I don't care what that report says, Sweeny killed my sister.",
        "Tom: You need to calm down. Now, I'm just giving you the facts. Les' fingerprints were not on that cell phone, and there is no other evidence that connects him to the scene, so we cannot hold him for murder.",
        "Keith: What about his record? He's violated his restraining order. He beat my -- my sister senseless in front of her own son.",
        "Tom: Has no bearing here.",
        "Keith: In murder cases where the victim's been abused, it's a documented fact that the abuser is the one that kills them.",
        "Tom: It still has to be proven case by case. And in this case, there is no evidence placing him at the scene.",
        "Keith: So what are you saying? Sweeny comes over, beats my sister senseless, leaves her for dead? Somehow, his fingerprints get wiped off the phone, so he can't be a suspect? That was my sister's blood on that phone. Doesn't that mean anything?",
        "Lily: Okay, all right, you know, Keith, please, stop, this is --",
        "Keith: No. No, you know what? My sister's murderer's gonna go away scot-free because nobody here wants to look past the obvious!",
        "Lily: Keith?",
        "Keith: What?",
        "Lily: Oh, my God.",
        "[Keith groans]",
        "Lily: You're bleeding.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: He almost killed you just because you said to leave me alone.",
        "Carly: And he didn't kill me, did he? And if anybody saved anybody, it was you saving me. You were so brave to pick up that bat and stop Les from hurting me. But you know what? It's over. And Les isn't coming back.",
        "J.J.: Promise?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I promise. Because I'm going to the police station today, and I'm going to tell them what he did to you, and what he did to me, and they are going to put him away for a very long time. Now, why don't you go upstairs and get dressed, okay?",
        "J.J.: Can I go with you?",
        "Jack: And miss Emma's famous chocolate chip cookies? Are you kidding me?",
        "J.J.: Aunt Emma's coming?",
        "Carly: Yes, she is. But only children who have washed their faces and brushed their teeth get to have some of those yummy cookies. Go up and get dressed. J.J. Yeah!",
        "Carly: I guess I'd better get changed, too.",
        "Jack: Carly, wait. Honey? Look at me. Look at me. We need to talk.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up, on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: This is a choice about protecting my child, and having a life with you. But I have to choose my baby.",
        "Henry: Look me right in the eye, Katie, and tell me you don't love Mike.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Talk to me, Carly. Why didn't you tell me how far Les went?",
        "Carly: What would've been the point? He took J.J. It was more important to get the kid back, and I knew that I was going to be okay --",
        "Jack: Well, no wonder you're waking up screaming.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Please don't make such a big deal out of this.",
        "Jack: Darlin', it is a big deal.",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack, if we're ever gonna get to the station, I really should go and change. Okay?",
        "Jack: Wait, a second -- [Carly groans] what did Les do to you?",
        "Carly: I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. My arm is a little sore, that's all. I'll tell you something, I'm going to feel a lot better when that man is put away once and for all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Les: Hey, man. How much longer are you gonna hold me?",
        "Tom: Hey, man, are you serious? You're facing two separate counts of assault, stabbing Keith Morrissey and attacking a cops' wife.",
        "Les: Assault? Assault? No. I should just, like, pay a fine. That's it. Hey, it's more like self-defense. That witch came after me after I showed her my papers. What am I supposed to do, man? Just stand there and take it?",
        "Tom: Huh. You're a piece of work.",
        "Ben: Tom?",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Ben: Hey.",
        "Tom: Just in time. The coroner's report on Julia Larrabee, will you take a look?",
        "Ben: Sure. You know I'm not a medical examiner.",
        "Tom: Understood. But since your expertise is in neurology, see if you can find something besides a blow to the head that might have been the cause of her death.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: This is how I account your word?",
        "Jessica: My oath as an attorney comes first, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: Les Sweeny is a pathetic waste of oxygen and we both know it.",
        "Jessica: Which does not mean he killed his ex-wife. Now, I am bound to represent my client to the best of my ability. Whether I like the guy is irrelevant.",
        "Lucinda: Even if it makes Lily prime suspect?",
        "Jessica: One has nothing to do with the other.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, the hell it doesn't. I hired you to protect lily.",
        "Jessica: No, you hired me to defend Les Sweeny so that I could inconspicuously spy on your daughter, and I'm not going to do it. You hired me to defend Les, and that's what I intend to do. As far as Keith and Lily are concerned, you're on your own.",
        "[Lucinda chuckles]",
        "Lucinda: Had I known that you were seriously going to defend this slime, I would not have armed you with a point of view.",
        "Jessica: Listen, I've never had a problem building my own cases, thank you. I'll see you in court.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, you will. Oh, and if you don't help me, I'll just have to find someone who will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You know, you should be off your feet and resting, but yet, you decide that this the day I'm going to get in a fight with the D.A.",
        "Keith: Yeah, well, I should have punched him right in the nose.",
        "Lily: Oh, it's not bad enough that you've got blood soaking through your dressing. If you really were really concentrating, you could've gotten a broken nose, too.",
        "Keith: Well, then if you're so mad at me, why'd you drag me all the way over here for?",
        "Lily: Ah, you forget my first choice was the emergency room. But, since you nixed that idea, you gotta have to settle for my very inadequate nursing skills. So, please. Have a seat, I'll take good care of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: All right, come on, Jen, you and me. We'll be scared and we will be freaked out, but at least we'll be in this together.",
        "Jennifer: We can't.",
        "Mike: Why not? So what if we haven't done it before? We're gonna make great parents, Jen, I'm telling you that. Please let me share this with you.",
        "Jennifer: It'll only make things worse.",
        "Mike: How?",
        "Jennifer: Because Craig will be impossible. And then it won't be just me against him anymore.",
        "Mike: Isn't that the point?",
        "Jennifer: Don't you see how jealous he is already?",
        "Mike: Of me?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, Mike, you threatened him, because you are such a better man than he is. All right, you're more honest and straightforward.",
        "Mike: Isn't that the kind of person you want in your baby's life?",
        "Jennifer: Yes, yes, of course, except that Craig will still be there! All right? And he will see you, and it will make him feel like the small, petty man that he is. And then he will turn my baby's life into a tug of war.",
        "Mike: Okay, okay. So what are you saying is that you're going to live some solitary life and never be happy with another man because Craig may not like it?",
        "Jennifer: Craig destroys marriages, Mike! I've seen it close up. He destroyed my family, and I can't let that happen to my child!",
        "Mike: So you're going to push me away and let Craig win by default? C'mon! Don't make this a choice between him and me.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not. This is a choice about protecting my child, and having a life with you. And I'm sorry, Mike, but I have to choose my baby.",

        "Henry: I'm sorry, Katie, it's too late.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, it's not. Henry, just last week you were telling me how you felt like the luckiest, happiest man alive.",
        "Henry: Well, I was lying to myself.",
        "Katie: You're just angry right now. You'll get over it.",
        "Henry: No, I don't think I will. Look, all this pretending, it was okay in the beginning, because nothing between us was supposed to be real. We know -- you agreed to marry me to make mike jealous.",
        "Katie: Would you forget about Mike?",
        "Henry: How can I forget about Mike? He's between us all the time. He's the reason behind everything that you do and every promise that you make.",
        "Katie: That is not true. Not anymore.",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, do you know that I trained myself to look away every time Mike came into a room? Mike would come in, my eyes would go right to the floor. Isn't that pathetic?",
        "Katie: Why would you do that?",
        "Henry: Because I didn't want to see the way you looked at him. The way I want you to look at me.",
        "Katie: Oh, Henry, I'm so sorry.",
        "Henry: I knew -- I knew even though this whole time you still had feelings for him, it was okay, because my dream was coming true, so I swallowed my pride and I kept looking away.",
        "Katie: But I married you, Henry, you.",
        "Henry: I know. I know, I know. And that's what I said to myself. I said, \"You know what? She's mine now, in a way. Yeah. I mean, we're under the same roof and we share meals and so hey, if she still looks at her old flame like that? I can take it,\" okay? \"And if some self-esteem, some respect gets stuck in my craw, so what? I can choke it get back, it's worth it to have my dream come true.\"",
        "Katie: I never knew.",
        "Henry: Because I didn't let you know. Because I knew -- I knew that if Mike were available again, this whole thing would come to a screeching halt. So I made a promise to myself. I said, \"Henry, listen up here now, if you keep a little bit of your heart back, because if it all does come crashing down, you know, you won't get too hurt.\" And then --",
        "Katie: Then, what?",
        "Henry: We made love and it was -- it was everything I imagined, sweetheart, and a lot more.",
        "Katie: You don't think that it meant as much to me as it meant to you? It was beautiful, Henry, and no matter what you say, I know you weren't holding anything back.",
        "Henry: No, I wasn't. I couldn't. I can't do that anymore.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Katie: Making love with you was like the icing on the cake.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I started to want the cake. Oh, man.",
        "Katie: Hold on. You think that I haven't been afraid of losing you? You think that this marriage isn't something that I want to protect with all my heart? 'Cause it is, Henry. I want it. I want you. What do I have to do to make you see that?",
        "Henry: I don't know. Maybe -- you know, maybe you have to do what you've never been able to do.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Henry: Look me right in the eye, Katie, and tell me you don't love Mike.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm sorry -- I'm sorry, Henry, I can't do that.",
        "Henry: Well, I guess I should wish you luck.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Henry: Well, your brother busted up the wedding, so Mike's available again, so it's only a matter of time before you two get back together.",
        "Katie: Okay, you're right, Mike gets to me. Is that what you want to hear? That every time I see him, a little piece of me wonders, \"what if?\"",
        "Henry: That'd be a start.",
        "Katie: All right, I admit it. There are times when I wonder. But those times used to hound me day and night and they don't anymore. In fact, they're so seldom that pretty soon, they're going to disappear. And you know why?",
        "Henry: Because you're in denial, that's why.",
        "Katie: No, because every day, I've become more and more sure of my feelings for you. We always say that we're not going to lie to each other, and I'm not going to start now.",
        "Henry: So you do love Mike?",
        "Katie: Yes. But I'm sure a piece of me always will, but that doesn't mean that I want to be with him. I don't. What he and I had is completely over, Henry, I want to be with you, in every possible way.",
        "Henry: No. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, I can't do -- I can't get sucked back into this again. No.",
        "Katie: What do you want, proof?",
        "Henry: Proof of what's in your heart? Wow, if that were only possible.",
        "Katie: Okay, fine. Fine. You want proof? You will get proof.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I have to look at this situation the way it really is. All right, Craig is too big of a bully to back down. But you -- you're enough of a gentleman to let go. And I have to choose the path that will give my child a fighting chance. It's the way it has to be.",

        "Tom: Constricted? Was she choking?",
        "Ben: Note only says there's swelling in the throat.",
        "Tom: So why is that significant?",
        "Ben: Because airway constriction isn't typically consistent with a head trauma.",
        "Tom: Could that have caused her death?",
        "Ben: It's possible, but there's really only one way to find out.",
