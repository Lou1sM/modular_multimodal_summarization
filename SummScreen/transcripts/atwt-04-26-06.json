        "Carly wakes up in Jack's arms, which almost leads to them sharing a kiss. When they all gather around the Snyder table for breakfast it seems like old times. Paul and Meg reunite at the police station, where he happily tells her the charges against her have been dropped, Dusty is alive, but unfortunately Emily is still on the loose. Will is cold to Gwen when she tries to apologize for missing their date. Hal tells Gwen and Will about Dusty being alive. After Jen sees Will acting distant towards Gwen, she reminds him never to waste a moment with the person you love, look what happened to her and Dusty. Will follows her advice and goes to the club to apologize and give her her guitar strap. Paul wants protection for Meg, and Hal suggests she stay at the station, but Meg vehemently opposes that idea; she wants Paul to take her home to the farm; she will be safe there because Jack is living there now. Paul worries about Emma's reaction to him bringing her there, but Meg tells him that she will get used to him being around at some point. Jack tells a disappointed Carly that the forensics team is done at the house, so she can go back home. Carly puts up a brave face for the kids, as they pack up and then go home. Jack tells a thrilled Emma Meg is coming home. Paul takes off his wedding band and tells Meg that she is all he wants. Emma thanks Paul for getting the charges against Meg dropped. Later, when Jack gets a phone call about Emily still not being found, Paul declares he is going to find her before she hurts Meg. Jack advises him to stay clear of it, but Paul tells him he is going for a walk (yeah right). Susan comes face to face with Emily."

        "Jennifer: Hey, hey. Hey, it's okay. Hey, it's me. You're safe.",
        "Dusty: Hey, Red.",
        "Jennifer: Were you back there? God, I can't imagine how you -- well, at least maybe the view was better today, hmm?",
        "Dusty: Same view. But you're real now.",
        "Jennifer: Can I get you anything?",
        "Dusty: Want to give me a ride home?",
        "Jennifer: More than anything. But can you?",
        "Dusty: Yes, I can. Get me my pants, let's get out of here.",
        "Bob: Not so fast, Donovan. You should think about sticking around for a couple of days.",
        "Dusty: I'm fine. Just a bit tired.",
        "Bob: Well, that's probably anemia. You know, a severe blood loss -- remember that gash they stitched up last night on your ankle. Then there's dehydration, malnutrition, lack of proper food and water for weeks -- you take your pick. I think you should stay, Dusty. Just let us watch you for a couple of days.",
        "Dusty: Doc, I've been a prisoner for a few weeks. No more. I'm going home.",

        "Gwen: Yeah --",
        "Will: So you probably needed your sleep.",
        "Gwen: I don't need sleep so much as I need you. I'm sorry -- I'm sorry about last night. You know I was trying to get caught up at work. Casey lost the playlist for the --",

        "Meg: You know, I froze last night. Is it possible to get another blanket? Would that be easy to manage?",
        "Cop #4: I'll see what I can do.",
        "Meg: And have you heard anything about Paul Ryan? I know his car was spotted last night, and that's the last I heard. Do you know if they found him, or if he's okay?",
        "Cop #4: I just came on duty. I'll look for a report.",
        "Meg: Okay. You know, it's pretty quiet here today. Aren't there supposed to be a ton of people showing up to work?",
        "Cop #4: It was a busy night, that much I know.",
        "Meg: Okay, well, if you hear anything, please let me know. Even if my lawyer's here, just come on in, okay?",

        "Jack: It is.",
        "Carly: I was out here all night?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, I started to bring you up last night, but --",
        "Carly: I must've been out like a light.",
        "Jack: You wouldn't budge.",
        "Carly: I guess yesterday was a bit much. Skeleton in the basement, forensics in my kitchen. Thanks for getting me out of the house, Jack. And for rounding up the kids. It feels so good not to be alone.",
        "Jack: Yeah. You want some coffee?",
        "Carly: Yeah, sure.",
        "Jack: I'll put some on.",
        "Carly: I wonder if the kids are up.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I heard some rustling a while ago.",
        "Carly: Emma probably has them dressed.",
        "Jack: She's probably gonna have them doing chores after breakfast.",
        "Carly: Oh, well, they'd love that. You know, J.J.'s decided to be a horse whisperer when he grows up, so he wants practice staring into the horses' eyes and reading their minds.",
        "Jack: This is new.",
        "Carly: Yeah, he decided yesterday at breakfast.",
        "Jack: Oh --",
        "Carly: You should ask him about it. I'm sure he'll tell you everything.",
        "Jack: I will.",
        "Emma: I could have sworn this shirt was clean when I put it on her.",
        "Carly: Oh, she must have found that plant on the stair landing, huh?",
        "Emma: And good morning to you, too. Did you sleep well?",
        "Carly: Yes, we did. And don't worry about Sage's shirt. I think somebody around here told this little girl that there was candy at the bottom of that flower pot.",
        "Emma: Oh, they did, did they?",
        "Jack: It was meant to be a joke. Right, J.J.?",
        "Emma: Joke? Some joke! I think they should be made to muck out the stalls.",
        "J.J.: No, let me, please!",
        "Jack: You want to clean the horse stalls?",
        "J.J.: Yes.",
        "Jack: What? Now, who on earth would like a job like that?",
        "Emma: Wow, he could move in here.",
        "Carly: Beats me.",
        "J.J.: A horse whisperer!",
        "Jack: A who? Grab the plates, buddy. And please, please, please tell me what a horse whisperer is.",
        "J.J.: Well, first they listen to horses' thoughts. I think. It was in a movie, but the movie was long, and there was kissing, so I kind of forget part of it. But the horse part was cool.",
        "Carly: So thanks for letting them stay.",
        "Emma: Oh, listen, I wouldn't dream of letting you and the children stay at that house with the basement all messed up like that.",
        "Jack: Okay, everybody, eat up.",
        "J.J.: Aren't you eating, too?",
        "Jack: Oh, no, buddy, I've got some calls to make.",
        "Carly: Hey, your dad made pancakes and it's not even the weekend. I think that deserves some kind of cheer, doesn't it?",
        "J.J.: Do the wave!",
        "Emma: Whoo!",
        "[Laughter]",
        "J.J.: It's not as good when Parker's not here.",

        "Carly: Me, three. And take it easy on that syrup, sir.",
        "Emma: Yeah.",
        "J.J.: All right.",
        "Emma: Hey, do you know what we're going to do after breakfast?",
        "J.J.: What?",
        "Emma: We are going to candle eggs. Do you know what that means?",
        "J.J.: No.",
        "Emma: Well, we go to a very, very dark corner in the barn, and then we hold up a little light and we look through the eggy and see all the little, tiny chickies inside.",
        "J.J.: Awesome!",
        "Carly: On the fridge, behind the fruit.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",

        "Will: I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. You know, this shift started at 7:00. And since school's out today, I'll probably work a double. You know, we can use the money.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. I'll get paid tonight, too.",
        "Will: Oh, yeah?",
        "Gwen: Yeah. You know, I'll finally be able to throw some money into the pot.",
        "Will: That's good. Every last bit gets us closer to our own place.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Will: What is this, Dad, truancy patrol? You know there's no school today, right?",
        "Hal: I'm here to get a case statement. And Gwen needed a ride. Haven't you spoken to your sister yet?",
        "Will: Yet?",
        "Hal: She's here.",
        "Will: What, in the hospital?",
        "Hal: With Dusty. We found him last night. I have to get his statement.",

        "Hal: If I can make it, I will.",
        "Will: Hey, Dad, tell Jen that I'll come by when I can. When my shift's over.",
        "Hal: Will do. And, listen, if I can't make it tonight, you have a great opening. I'm sure you'll be terrific.",

        "Dusty: Yeah, what are you going to do about it?",
        "Jennifer: First? Follow doctor's orders.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, what's that? Boring food? Sponge bath?",
        "Jennifer: Hmm.",
        "Dusty: Sponge bath.",
        "Jennifer: Mm, my version.",
        "Dusty: Well, get me my chair, I'm ready. I need my pants.",
        "Jennifer: Not in my version.",
        "Dusty: I mean to get out of here.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm glad I remembered to bring some clean clothes when I went to check on Johnny.",
        "Dusty: I cannot wait to see my man.",
        "Jennifer: It took everything I had not to sneak him in here.",
        "Dusty: Well, let's hope that he's gonna be awake when I get there.",

        "Jennifer: Dad -- Dusty's been released.",

        "Meg: Oh, I was worried out of my mind.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that's what I heard.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: The guards outside my cell were talking trash about you all night.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: They didn't tell you where I was?",
        "Meg: No! I kept asking. Where were you?",
        "Paul: I was in a holding cell, raising hell, until I finally started to wake up judges and lawyers.",
        "Meg: What happened? You were arrested?",
        "Paul: Stupid charges from before. I already made bail. Hal just wanted me out of the way.",
        "Meg: Hal found you?",
        "Paul: Listen, more importantly, we found Dusty.",
        "Meg: Is he --",
        "Paul: Alive? Yeah. He's pretty beat up, but he's fine. He's alive.",
        "Meg: Oh, thank God.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Meg: What about Emily?",
        "Paul: Well, last I heard, they hadn't found her, but I'm sure they have by now. The area wasn't that large. I don't think we need to worry about Emily anymore.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Dusty's alive.",
        "Paul: Yeah. He's at the hospital right now. Jennifer's with him.",
        "Meg: Is he gonna be okay?",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. That's not the best part. You're clear, Meg.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Paul: Well, that's the other thing that I was screaming at my lawyer about. With Dusty alive, he was able to say definitively, flat out that you had nothing to do with his kidnapping.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Paul: Yeah, it's over. They're processing the paperwork right now.",
        "Meg: You did this?",
        "Paul: Well, it would have happened eventually, but -- yeah, I pushed it along.",
        "Meg: It's over.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You're free. You can go home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I didn't see anybody but Emily.",
        "Hal: But you were convinced that she wasn't working alone. Well, that's what you said last night.",
        "Dusty: Hal, I made my statement. You can see for yourself how things went down. Who's in the middle of everything? Besides Emily.",
        "Hal: I will pursue every trail possible. You can count on that.",
        "Jennifer: And you'll tell us as soon as you find Emily, right?",
        "Hal: Of course, I will.",
        "Susan: Oh, Hal --",
        "Hal: Hey.",
        "Susan: I heard an orderly say this chair is for Dusty Donovan, but I had to see with my own eyes.",
        "Dusty: Yes, it is.",
        "Susan: How'd you finally find him?",
        "Hal: He escaped.",
        "Susan: From where? Were you being held prisoner?",
        "Jennifer: He's been through quite a lot, so -- let's get him in that wheelchair and get him home where he belongs.",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Susan: Okay.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, let's do that. Thank you.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you. And dad, I'll check with you later?",
        "Hal: Yeah.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. All righty, here we go.",
        "Hal: Take care.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you.",
        "Dusty: See you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Susan, I --",
        "Susan: They couldn't wait to get out of here.",
        "Hal: I think you better have a seat.",
        "Susan: I need to sit for this?",
        "Hal: I think so. It's about Emily, and what happened to Dusty.",
        "Dusty: You took that last corner on one wheel.",
        "Jennifer: Well, you want to get home.",
        "Dusty: You know it.",
        "Jennifer: Don't you --",
        "Susan: So, wait, it started New Year's? Emily shot Paul?",
        "Hal: He confirmed it.",
        "Susan: But you can't believe a word out of that guy's mouth.",
        "Hal: Meg treated the wound, she confirmed.",
        "Susan: So we're supposed to believe that Emily, all by herself, stashed Dusty in some farmhouse?",
        "Hal: Out in Coker's woods. That's where we lost her. There's an entire search team out there right now. There's a S.W.A.T. team standing by.",
        "Susan: A S.W.A.T. team, after my daughter?",
        "Hal: Only if there's a stand-off. Susan, she tried to kill two people. She was armed.",
        "Susan: But she's probably scared, with all those people after her! She needs a doctor, not a bullet.",
        "Hal: The team has my personal orders not to -- hell, half the squad was at my house when we were married. Nobody wants to hurt her, Susan. But this is where we are. Now, if she tries to contact you, you have to let me know.",
        "Susan: She won't. She hasn't trusted me with anything since she first moved in with Paul. But now --",
        "Hal: And now she's desperate! So she might. And if she does, you know what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Were you talking to someone at the station?",
        "Jack: No. Why?",
        "Emma: Well, I called there earlier, and Meg wasn't in her cell, and nobody told me what was happening. They didn't know what was going on.",
        "Jack: I'll check on it first thing. Hey, how late were you at the station yesterday anyway? 'Cause I was up around 1:00, and you were nowhere to be found.",
        "Emma: It wasn't much later than that. You know, Jack, Meg has done a lot of things that she's not proud of, but she is not a criminal. And she really doesn't belong in there.",
        "Jack: Either she's protecting Paul or she's doing what he wants. She's not making it easy for us to help her.",
        "Emma: Well, she says she's in love with Paul. And we all know about that, don't we?",
        "Jack: So, what, is this time for my lecture?",
        "Emma: No, I'm not going to lecture you. And I'm not going to take sides, either. I just really want you to be happy. I want all of you to be happy.",
        "Jack: Okay. We don't make that easy.",
        "Emma: No. No, you don't. You all waste too much time being hurt. Listen, give me a shout before you leave. Okay?",
        "Jack: Okay. Love you.",
        "Emma: You, too.",
        "Carly: There's a couple of pancakes left, and some bacon, if you want.",
        "Jack: Oh, no, I'm not hungry.",
        "Carly: Well, how about some coffee?",
        "Jack: I'm good.",
        "Carly: So isn't J.J. a hoot with that horse mind-reading stuff? He was practicing on Sage the other night. And miraculously, he got the right answers -- that she wants cookies! [Laughter] She wants to stay up late and play videogames.",
        "Jack: He's an operator. Listen, you don't have to do that. Come on.",
        "Carly: No, I know, I don't. It's habit. So I thought that maybe we could take the kids out hiking around the pond later? I could pack up a picnic --",
        "Jack: I spoke to Jason McCoy from forensics.",
        "Carly: Oh?",
        "Jack: After we left, they sent a team into the basement. They worked all night.",
        "Carly: All night?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, at least, now they're done. They got every trace of the skeleton, every bit of evidence out of the house.",
        "Carly: That was fast.",
        "Jack: Yeah, they're good. They fumigated the basement, they sealed up the wall.",
        "Carly: Good.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so it's perfectly safe now. You and the kids can go back home today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I can't believe this. Home. Wherever that is.",
        "Paul: It's wherever you want it to be, Meg.",
        "Meg: Well, that's a loaded question these days.",
        "Paul: Okay, so we'll take it easy. We'll start with what we know. You don't want to be here anymore.",
        "Meg: Definitely not. No cops, no cells, no bars.",
        "Paul: So, what do you want?",
        "Meg: A hot shower. A cup of tea.",
        "Paul: Sounds like the Lakeview to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Well, then go with a wider grid. The longer Emily's gone, the colder the trail. Who's on it? Well, pull shanks in with the k-9 patrol. I want her found before sundown. All right, everybody, listen up. Emily Stewart is still at large. Here's what we're gonna do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Gwen: It was like something in him shut off. I mean, he was just --",
        "Will: A big jerk?",
        "Carly: Seeing your face, first thing. That's the definition of \"Okay\" to me.",
        "Paul: I love you.",
        "Meg: That's all I need, Paul. I'm so congested and I can't sleep.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: How could you lose track of her?",
        "Hal: What are you doing walking around here unshackled?",
        "Paul: Oh, please, I beat those charges before breakfast, Hal. All you did in locking me up was lose your best shot at finding Emily.",
        "Hal: The day you're my best shot at anything is the day I turn in my badge.",
        "Paul: I would've found her, Hal. I would've brought her here. And what are you left with now? Nothing. You've been forced to literally sic the dogs on Emily.",
        "Hal: You know, if you'd leveled with us from the beginning when you first suspected that Emily had Dusty, we wouldn't be in the position! We'd have Emily, and Dusty would've been home a hell of a lot sooner.",
        "Paul: Or Emily would've been spooked and she would have killed Dusty.",
        "Hal: I ought to charge you both with obstruction.",
        "Paul: Fine, some other day. In the meantime, can we find someone to make sure that Meg's okay? Emily blames Meg for everything that's gone wrong.",
        "Hal: Emily is going to be way too busy laying low to come after anybody, Paul, even Meg.",
        "Paul: You don't know that. You have no idea what Emily's gonna do next. She stopped thinking like a normal person a long time ago. Now, please, can we please get Meg some protection?",
        "Hal: Every officer I have is going to be out on the search. But you're standing in the one place that you can be sure Emily will avoid.",
        "Paul: Are you kidding?",
        "Hal: If you want police protection, stay in the police station.",
        "Meg: No. I am not staying here another minute. And you can't force me, can you?",
        "Hal: No, I can't hold you. The charges are dropped. But if I were you, Meg, I would think seriously about the choices you've been making these days.",
        "Paul: He's right. You should think about staying here. And you should probably think about dumping me.",
        "Meg: I'm not staying here. And I'm not dumping you, okay? Take me home.",
        "Paul: All right. But let's be smart about this, okay? Let's not go to the first place that Emily's gonna look for you. Now, we can't go to the Lakeview, can't go to my house --",
        "Meg: No, no. I meant home-home. With my mom.",
        "Paul: What, the farm?",
        "Meg: Yeah, she's been here half the night, she's worried. And I don't want to flake on her. And besides, Jack is staying there.",
        "Paul: I guess that passes for police protection.",
        "Meg: And you've seen my mama with a shotgun.",
        "Paul: Yes, I have. And I think I might see her with a shotgun again today, if I show up with you.",
        "Meg: She'll accept you, Paul. She'll have to. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I'm really sorry I didn't come by before. I had no idea.",

You know, I kissed Dusty one morning, went to run errands, and by that night he had disappeared. It's a miracle that I ever got him back. So whatever it is you two are fighting about, is it worth it?
