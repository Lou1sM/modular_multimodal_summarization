        "[Gwen reading]",
        "Gwen: Dear Gwen, I need your help. You're the only person I can trust right now. I wonder what Ray would think about me writing this. He probably thought we'd never even know each other, and we almost didn't. But now that you're in my life for better or worse, I have a huge favor to ask. Gwen, please, as soon as you possibly can, find a way to get to Montana, to a town called Mussel Shell. Come alone and don't tell anyone. The address is \u0096",
        "[Will comes to the table and Gwen closes her laptop]",
        "Will: One double chocolate banana split. All for you. What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.",
        "Gwen: Sort of. I just got an e-mail.",
        "Will: From who? From Adam?",
        "Gwen: No, not him.",
        "Will: Well, then who? Who's got you so freaked out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cleo remembering]",
        "Jade: It's a great plan, unless you don't think you can pull it off.",
        "Cleo: Can I be Gwen? Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Jade: Then no worries.",
        "Cleo: Can I ask you a question? Am I going to have to do everything that Gwen does?",
        "Jade: Every little thing. That's why I had you study up.",
        "Cleo: Even -- even sleep with Will?",
        "Jade: Is that a problem?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: You think anybody saw us?",
        "Parker: Who cares? Wait, don't tell me you feel guilty about leaving.",
        "Faith: No way. I only came because you asked me to.",
        "Parker: Really?",
        "Faith: Yeah. I hate pep rallies.",
        "Parker: You do?",
        "Faith: Yeah. All those kids screaming about a stupid team like it's so important.",
        "Parker: Yeah, and you're a freak if you don't show up in school colors. You're right. It's pretty lame.",
        "Faith: So if you hate pep rallies, and you were just going to sneak away, why did you even ask me to come?",
        "Parker: How else was I going to get you to hang out with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: No, Katie -- Katie, what do you mean you have to go up to Woodlawn? Woodley -- whatever. Why can't we meet and drive up together? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Katie, listen, that's not what we -- okay -- okay, all right. Okay, okay -- I said okay, bubbles, all right? I will meet you up there. Vienna -- Vienna! What's with the suitcases? Where are you going?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey, I could use a little help here. Hey, where are you? We need to get our strategy session going if we're going to make this work in time. I need you to come down here and tell me what you think -- tell me if you approve of this --",
        "Jack: Approve? Well, if we were keeping score, I'd give it about a 10.5.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: It's no business of yours where I'm going, Henry Coleman!",
        "Henry: Wait, wait, please -- Vienna, please, don't leave, not like this.",
        "Vienna: Oh, really? Well, how exactly is a jilted bride supposed to leave? And take your hands off me, Henry. You shouldn't touch what doesn't belong to you anymore.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay. I deserve that, I deserve that. You're not leaving town for good, though, are you?",
        "Vienna: No. Not for good. I'm doing someone a favor -- a friend.",
        "Henry: Which friend?",
        "Vienna: A good friend.",
        "Henry: How good? Does this friend's name begin with \"B\" and end with a \"rad\"? You know what? Forget it. I give up, okay? You can go on hating me forever -- you and your friend. I will leave you both to it.",
        "Vienna: No, Henry. I don't hate you. And yes, the favor is for Brad. He wants me to test some Swedish meatballs in this town called Wood -- Wood -- something, I can't --",
        "Henry: Woodley -- Woodley?",
        "Vienna: Yes, you know about it?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I just found out about it. Katie invited me there, too.",
        "Vienna: Why would she do that?",
        "Henry: I don't know, but I don't think it's a coincidence.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I thought you were still out of town.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I just got back. Is that yours? It's nice.",
        "Katie: Oh, this thing? No, it's -- it's for -- I mean, it's not for --",
        "Jack: Sorry.",
        "Katie: No, no problem. Yeah, this is just -- a present I bought for Henry and Vienna -- a surprise.",
        "Jack: Lingerie? Isn't that kind of personal?",
        "Katie: You would think, but there's a reason.",
        "Jack: Really? I'm behind the times, I guess. Are we giving \"I'm sorry you didn't get married\" presents now?",
        "Katie: Okay, you caught me. Brad and I decided that we would plan this little thing --",
        "Jack: You and Brad?",
        "Katie: Yeah, and I was just getting supplies. I mean, we'll see if it works. I don't know. So, when did you get back?",
        "Jack: Just now.",
        "Katie: Right. You said that already, didn't you?",
        "Jack: Listen -- I guess I owe you an apology for taking off like that and not letting you know where I was headed. This conference came up --",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, I know, I talked to Margo.",
        "Jack: Yeah, and I was a little bogged down. I had to hurry up and pack and write out the kids' schedules, and let Emma know where I was going and everything. So I guess the point is -- I meant to call you.",
        "Katie: No, it's fine. It's fine. The time apart was good.",
        "Jack: Really? For who?",
        "Katie: Well -- listen, Jack, with you gone for a little while, it gave me time to think about our kiss --",
        "Jack: And?",
        "Katie: And I realized that you were right, that we should just not make too much of it.",
        "Jack: Is that what I said?",
        "Katie: Yeah -- well, no -- whatever. I think you were worried that I would be worried -- and I was, but basically because the bottom line is, it didn't mean anything. So we should just, you know, forget it happened and go back to -- being friends?",
        "Brad: Hey, hey -- how was your trip to Chicago?",
        "Jack: It was fine.",
        "Brad: Just fine? See, that's the pitfalls of traveling alone. Next time, you've got to take me with you. We'll have a blast -- you know, all those big city girls --",
        "Jack: Okay, calm down, calm down. You know Chicago was just business, Brad. You know that.",
        "Brad: I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?",
        "Jack: Yeah, you are, actually. Can you give us a minute -- just one minute. Please?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Katie: No, wait. Brad, wait! It's okay. It's okay. We should finish what we started, anyway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: So, what do you want to do?",
        "Parker: Well, I thought we could get something to eat and just talk or whatever. How's your mom doing? Have you heard anything since she left to go to rehab?",
        "Faith: Parker, can't we just hang out? I thought we left the pep rally to have fun.",
        "Parker: Well, if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine, but I sure talked a lot when my mom left.",
        "Faith: It's not the same thing. My mom didn't run away.",
        "Parker: I know that, but it's got to feel weird that she's not around.",
        "Faith: She's doing something good. She's trying to stop taking diet pills. She's not running away with some guy. I'm sorry, Parker.",
        "Parker: It's okay.",
        "Faith: No, it's not. I shouldn't have said that.",
        "Parker: What, the truth? That your mom's coming back someday, and mine isn't? I've known it for a long time, and I'm over it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, who is it? Who's it from?",
        "Gwen: I'm not supposed to tell anyone.",
        "Will: Are you serious?",
        "Gwen: That's what the e-mail says.",
        "Will: And what do you say?",
        "Gwen: I say that we swore we'd never keep secrets from each other.",
        "Will: So, who is it that wants you to keep secrets?",
        "Gwen: Carly.",
        "Will: Carly -- are you sure? The e-mail's from Carly?",
        "Gwen: Take a look. See where she mentions Mussel Shell, Montana? That's where she was born.",
        "Will: She says something about Ray, too.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, Will, she talks about our dad.",
        "Will: What are you going to do?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. Go to Montana?",
        "Will: Gwen, you can't. She's on the run. She's a fugitive.",
        "Gwen: Exactly. She can't trust anyone, except me.",
        "Will: I understand you wanting to help her right now, but after everything that's just happened -- I think now's not a good time to be breaking any laws.",
        "Gwen: I know, but she's my sister, Will.",
        "Will: And you're my wife. Gwen, you can't tell me that you're honestly considering going to some town in Montana to help Carly --",
        "Gwen: I don't know.",
        "Will: Do you know how long you could spend in jail for helping her?",
        "Gwen: What do you want me to say, Will? I can't turn my back on her. She needs me.",
        "Will: More than you need your freedom? Gwen, don't do this. Don't throw away everything we have going on, even for Carly's sake. All right? If she needs help, if she needs rescuing, then Jack is the one to call. I think you need to talk to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Cleo? Cleo! What happened to you? I called your name, and you're, like, a million miles away.",
        "Cleo: Sorry, I only respond to Mrs. Will Munson now. I was dreaming about our wonderful life together.",
        "Jade: All right, well, wake up, because we have a lot of work to do.",
        "Cleo: I don't want to work anymore. I'm ready for the real thing. It's going to happen soon, right?",
        "Jade: Soon -- Mrs. Munson.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I can't, Will. I can't tell Jack, or anyone else.",
        "Will: I'm not even sure if this thing is real. Anyone could've found out where Carly was born.",
        "Gwen: You honestly think that somebody else sent that e-mail?",
        "Will: Maybe it was Adam. Who knows -- he gets you to go to Montana, and then you're all alone --",
        "Gwen: No, no. He doesn't know about Ray.",
        "Will: Well, still -- I don't think we should be making any assumptions here.",
        "Maddie: Hey -- hey, Guys.",
        "Will: Hey, Maddie.",
        "Gwen: Hey. Where's Casey?",
        "Maddie: Oh, he had to go home. He had to make curfew.",
        "Gwen: I really wish that you guys had more time together.",
        "Maddie: So do I.",
        "Gwen: But you know what? In six months, he'll be back, and you guys'll be better than ever.",
        "Maddie: That's what I keep telling myself. But listen, I wanted to thank you for letting us use your house tonight. If we didn't have a place to escape and to be alone, I don't know what we would've done -- so, thank you. Everything okay?",
        "Will: No, not exactly.",
        "Gwen: Its fine -- it's totally fine. We just had a bit of a rough day, that's all.",
        "Maddie: Are you sure? I mean, if there's anything I can do --",
        "Will: Yeah, actually there is something you can do, Maddie.",
        "Gwen: Will, I can't.",
        "Will: I'm just going to show this e-mail to our computer expert friend, here.",
        "Maddie: What e-mail?",
        "Gwen: I got a message from someone, and we want to make sure it's them.",
        "Maddie: Well, okay -- you have any ideas? What did it say?",
        "Will: Gwen thinks it's from Carly, but I have serious doubts.",
        "Maddie: You really think Carly tried to contact you?",
        "Gwen: Yes, absolutely. And if it is her, she would be terrified, which is why she didn't want me to say anything to anyone.",
        "Maddie: Okay, well -- Gwen, listen -- you know that if -- whatever it is, you can trust me.",
        "Gwen: No, I know.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Weird -- this I.P. Address -- this isn't from Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Do you see what is happening here? It is a setup.",
        "Vienna: What, you really think Katie is trying to get us alone together?",
        "Henry: Yes, yes. She thinks if she can get us into the same inn, she can get us into the same bed.",
        "Vienna: Well, would it?",
        "Henry: Vienna --",
        "Vienna: No, Henry, never mind. Save your excuses.",
        "Henry: No, wait a second. It's not -- Vienna, its excuses, okay? I'm trying to do what is best for you, and believe me, that is really difficult. Please, please know how sorry I am.",
        "Vienna: Well, you should be sorry. You are not the man I thought you were. Your heart is missing.",
        "Henry: What about Brad? Where's his heart?",
        "Vienna: How should I know?",
        "Henry: Maybe you should find out. Because he seems to be able to make you forget about poor, heartless me.",
        "Vienna: What do you mean? Brad and I --",
        "Henry: I don't -- you know, I don't want to know the details, okay? You can do whatever you want with whomever you want.",
        "Vienna: And isn't that a good thing? Because you don't want me anyway, do you, Henry?",
        "Henry: Just go, just go. You two sounded very happy together. I don't want to stand in your way.",
        "Vienna: Oh, wait, wait -- wait. What do you mean I sounded happy with Brad?",
        "Henry: I was outside the room.",
        "Vienna: When?",
        "Henry: The day after what was supposed to be our marriage, I heard you two together.",
        "Vienna: Oh, and you thought we were --",
        "Henry: No details, no.",
        "Vienna: No, but you're wrong, Henry. I wanted to be with him because you rejected me, and I was lonely and sad and hurt -- and then, he turned me down. And you know what? I'm glad he did.",
        "Henry: Really?",
        "Vienna: Really. And you know what? The two of you have more in common than you may think you have.",
        "Henry: How's that? Our callous disregard for other people's feelings?",
        "Vienna: No, no. Brad saved me from making a terrible mistake. And so did you. But the only difference is that I have no interest in Brad. The only person that -- I -- never mind.",
        "Henry: No, wait. No, no, wait -- please -- please, go on. Please.",
        "Vienna: It's not important. Past is past. You know, if Brad only invited me to Woodley so I could run into you, maybe -- maybe I shouldn't go.",
        "Henry: Maybe, but I think it might be considered criminal to turn down a beautiful room at a beautiful inn. I'm not putting any pressure here, but I'm game if you are.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So I have a bone to pick with your brother.",
        "Brad: What did I do now, princess?",
        "Katie: He thinks -- get this -- that I need Henry to be in love with me.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's ridiculous. You know that.",
        "Brad: Is it? I don't think so.",
        "Katie: Who cares what you think?",
        "Brad: Henry might. You've got him well-trained.",
        "Jack: Enough, Brad.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. Just please take my advice. When this whole thing is over and we get back from Woodley, leave the poor guy alone.",
        "Jack: What's in Woodley?",
        "Katie: A beautiful, romantic, little country inn. And Brad and I were thinking, if we can get Vienna and Henry there, they'll find their way back to each other.",
        "Jack: I see. That explains the little box of love you got set up here.",
        "Brad: Yeah, put that together with a conveniently overbooked hotel and you've got yourself an invitation to kiss and make up.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, what makes you so sure that this is going to work?",
        "Katie: It has to work. Vienna's miserable, and so is Henry, and I really, truly believe that if we can get them in the same room together and Henry can explain everything -- they'll make their way back to each other. And I promised him that I'd meet him there. So, I'll see you in the car.",
        "Brad: Five minutes.",
        "Jack: Hey, wait, Brad -- just, let me talk to you for a second.",
        "Brad: Why? Did you steal something from the box of love you want to fess up to?",
        "Jack: Come on. How is Katie? She seems --",
        "Brad: A handful -- like always, my brother.",
        "Jack: No, that's not it. She's -- different.",
        "Brad: How?",
        "Jack: I don't know. She's distant -- something --",
        "Brad: I don't know, man. She seemed pretty friendly to me. I thought that was the deal between with you two, you know? Just friends, right?",
        "Jack: Actually, I don't remember any kind of deal.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. When I came in here -- I'm sorry, I couldn't help but overhear her tell you that she wanted to move on. And if I was you, I'd respect her decision. She's not ready for anything serious, Jack. Anybody can see that. Hey hey!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Okay, what's that? I told you not to get me anything.",
        "Parker: Oh, come on. We'll share.",
        "Faith: No, thanks.",
        "Parker: But it's diet. Whatever. More for me.",
        "Faith: Dig in.",
        "Parker: Look, I can tell that you don't want to tell me about the food thing.",
        "Faith: What food thing?",
        "Parker: Faith, come on. I figured it out.",
        "Faith: I guess it's pretty obvious.",
        "Parker: No, no, no, that's not what I meant. It's just -- I've been watching, you know --",
        "Faith: Watching me? Why?",
        "Parker: I don't know. I like you. So, in school, I notice stuff -- like in the lunchroom, you look -- I don't know, you look sad. Plus, you go to therapy and everything --",
        "Faith: You do, too!",
        "Parker: I know. And sometimes I even like it. But if you ever tell anyone, I will have to kill you. But sometimes after I talk to the therapist, I feel a little bit better, when I talk to her about my mom. Does that ever happen to you?",
        "Faith: I guess. I am trying to get over it -- the food thing, I really am.",
        "Parker: Yeah, that's what I say about my mom, too.",
        "Faith: But you're not over it, so why did you tell me that?",
        "Parker: Okay, I'm busted.",
        "Faith: My therapist is always telling me that when something is really hard, it takes a while to fix. And the worst thing you can do is tell yourself it's not being fixed fast enough. It's weird talking about this.",
        "Parker: Weird, like bad?",
        "Faith: I don't know. But it's nice to know that I'm not the only kid who has to go to therapy. I am really sorry about saying that thing about your mom running away with that guy.",
        "Parker: It's okay. And it's nice to know I'm not the only person in therapy, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, Chicago, huh? Nice change of scene?",
        "Jack: Yes, it was. It was very nice for a conference.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: I needed to get away.",
        "Margo: From Katie, huh? Yeah, that's what I thought.",
        "Jack: Hey -- she wanted some space, so -- from me.",
        "Margo: What, who told you that?",
        "Jack: Brad did. Brad said that she wanted some distance, so I gave her some distance.",
        "Margo: I don't -- that's why you went running off to this conference, because of something Brad said?",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't go running anywhere. I was working.",
        "Margo: Uh-huh.",
        "Jack: I didn't know what she wanted, Margo. What was I supposed to do?",
        "Margo: You could ask her. I mean, I don't know what Brad said, but I do know that the last thing that my sister wants is distance from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Wow, look at this place.",
        "Katie: Yeah, it looks good.",
        "Brad: Good? This is -- this is perfect. Henry's gonna have a hard time keeping his hands off those Swedish meatballs. It was a joke, Katie-cat.",
        "Katie: Don't call me that, please, I'm not in the mood.",
        "Brad: So what happened to your old enthusiasm? You're not so hot on our plan anymore?",
        "Katie: No, you're right. You're right. It's my idea. I should focus -- get things ready. All right. Oh, where's the teddy?",
        "Brad: Well, maybe Jack swiped it as a lacy souvenir.",
        "Katie: That's not Jack's style, that's your style. Oh, here it is.",
        "Brad: Nice!",
        "Katie: Don't touch it -- it's for Henry and Vienna. They're gonna be here any minute. We've got to get ready.",
        "Brad: I couldn't wear it --",
        "Katie: No -- and don't touch that! That's for the happy couple.",
        "Brad: Let me ask you a question. How do you know they're going to be happy? You know, how do you know, you and I, we haven't jumped the gun? That they're not ready to get back together yet?",
        "Katie: This is no time for second thoughts, please.",
        "Brad: Okay, you're right -- yeah. You're right. Let's think positive, everything's gonna be fine. Henry's gonna -- Henry's gonna come in like this, okay? I'm Henry.

        "Brad: Okay, okay. Shh, shh. Okay, shh, shh. You know, you're spoiling my performance. I'm doing an Oscar-winning Henry Coleman here. All right -- Vienna, Darling, please don't torture me any longer. Don't -- you must let me apologize for all the bad things that I have done!",
        "Katie: Oh, my God.",

        "Brad: Are you sure? I mean, role-playing can be fun.",
        "Katie: Then go play out in the hallway.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, okay. All right. You know, I'm almost jealous, you know. Not just of Henry. But of Jack, too.",
        "Katie: Yeah, they both really had a shot with her, didn't they?",
        "Brad: Maybe. But they also had a shot with you. Well, that's when you were, you know, really fun. All right, well, don't work too hard, kiddo.",

        "Henry: Would that be such a bad way to end up?",
        "Vienna: No, maybe not. For an evening. No, but the next morning, nothing will have changed. Henry still doesn't love Vienna.",

        "Katie: No, wait! I'm sorry if I jumped the gun and stuck my nose in where it didn't belong. Please forgive me. It's just that, my heart was in the right place.",
        "Henry: Wow, you know, I would think that you had learned something over all these years. Like how flowers and candles and a hotel room don't make love work. You, of all people, should know that, Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: You have to create a fake account first. I did that with Katie when I was trying to get my brother and -- whatever, it doesn't matter. Anyway, I learned how to tell if an e-mail has been rerouted or not, in order to keep it from being traced.",
        "Gwen: So, what, you're saying it's too complicated for her?",
        "Maddie: You tell me. Is she good with computers?",
        "Gwen: Actually, come to think of it, no. She even needed Parker's help to check her e-mail.",

        "Brad: Well, you did kick my butt this morning. But no lack of trying. You know, I've never seen anyone work so hard to get two people back together. So no wonder you're so tense. Especially right here. See? I told you I have magic fingers.",
        "Katie: Okay -- it's getting late. We should really get going.",
