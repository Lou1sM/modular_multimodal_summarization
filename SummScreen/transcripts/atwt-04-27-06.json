        "Casey: If I'm lucky. But now, not so lucky. There's still tons of stuff left to do.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, but I just saw Gwen --",
        "Casey: Who knows? I got the sound problems, I don't have a live act, and there's a problem. So, later, okay?",
        "Maddie: But I'm wearing perfume.",
        "Will: There is nothing sexier than a woman with a guitar.",

        "Paul: I'm not proud of the way I've treated her.",
        "Susan: You're not proud and she's being hunted by the cops. I don't think that's a fair exchange.",
        "Paul: Okay, look, just -- just promise me that if she does comes to you, you'll let me know.",
        "Susan: She's not gonna come to me. You made sure that she cut herself off from everybody who loved her.",

        "Susan: And say what? That you love her? That's all she wants to hear, you know, even now.",

        "Paul: I do.",
        "Susan: Nobody who cares about my daughter could've -- could've played with her emotions the way you did. To actually go ahead and marry her?",
        "Paul: I had to. I had to find Dusty and bring him back to my sister. Jennifer has been through hell.",
        "Susan: What about the hell my daughter's been through? And thanks to you! I've got work to do.",
        "Emily: You see? Do you see the way he is? How easily he lies? He doesn't care about me. All he cares about is that I don't hurt his precious Meg.",
        "Susan: I'm so sorry, baby.",
        "Emily: God, I almost -- I almost believed him. I want to believe him -- still. Don't you get it? That's why I need to go far away. I need to go far away so I don't trick myself into hoping. Mother, please, my God, you've got to help me get out of here!",
        "Susan: All right, okay. I'll help you.",
        "Emily: Please!",

        "Katie: Because Lisa called to invite us to the opening of crash tonight.",
        "Mike: What'd you tell her?",
        "Katie: That I would talk to you first. I didn't really know if you were in the partying mood.",
        "Mike: Not really but maybe a party's exactly what we need.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Mike: Sure. Maybe if we start acting like everything's okay, sooner or later it will be.",
        "Katie: Dead people falling out of walls is not okay.",
        "Mike: Hey --",
        "Katie: We should just admit we're scared if we're scared.",
        "Mike: The only thing that scares me is losing you.",
        "Katie: Not gonna happen.",
        "Mike: Okay. Nick's gonna find out what he can from forensics, and he's sure that Jack is not out to pin this on me.",

        "Nick: I'm asking for a favor.",
        "Jack: That's a good one.",
        "Nick: Jack, he was trying to do the right thing by returning stolen property. Would he have gone near that wall if he thought he'd implicate himself in a murder?",
        "Jack: I am not having this discussion with you right now.",
        "Nick: All right, if you find anything that could tie Mike to that body, would you tell me?",
        "Jack: Stay out of this case, Nick. Having you on my back is the last thing that's gonna help Mike right now.",

        "Dusty: Become a fashion designer.",
        "Jennifer: Now I remember why he and I missed you so much.",
        "Dusty: I missed the drool he put down on my best shirts. I got used to the damp shoulders.",
        "Jennifer: You know, I think he knew something was wrong. He'd just start crying for no reason.",

        "Will: Well, not quite, not yet. But, you know, watch out, someday. So, do you want to go? I'll drive.",
        "Carly: I don't know. I'll think about it, but no promises, okay?",
        "Will: Okay. She goes on soon.",
        "Carly: I said I'll think about it.",
        "Will: All right, well, I've got to get back.",
        "Carly: Hey, Will. Thanks for letting me know. And if I don't show up, wish her luck.",
        "Will: I will. And I hope you do show up, because it would really mean to the world to her.",

        "Casey: Gwen, I'm a guy, all right? I can't do more than one thing at once.",
        "Gwen: So, you can't run music and notice that Maddie's alive at the same time?",
        "Casey: I noticed.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, what's she wearing?",
        "Casey: Something -- nice.",
        "Gwen: Man, I thought she mattered to you.",
        "Casey: She does matter.",
        "Gwen: Just not tonight?",
        "Casey: Gwen, this is huge for me. I blew my chance to go to Wisconsin. I've been the family screw-up for the better part of a year and maybe I just want to do something right for a change.",
        "Gwen: Oh, that's right -- I'm sorry, I forgot, you can't do two things right at the same time.",
        "Casey: All right, you know what? I don't need attitude.",
        "Gwen: Okay, well, what about Maddie? Do you need her?",
        "Casey: Where's that list for the third set?",
        "Gwen: Do you really not get it? Maddie looks amazing tonight. Not because she wants the general public to notice, but because she wants you to notice. All right, this place is great, and I want it to be a success as much as you do. But it's not worth me messing up with will or you losing Maddie, okay? No job is worth that much.",

        "Jennifer: Did you try his cell?",
        "Meg: Yeah, he's not picking up. He's gone after Emily. He's afraid that she'll hurt me.",

        "Jennifer: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: Come on, Red, she's playing you.",
        "Meg: I'm scared, Jen. You know what Emily's capable of, and Paul won't quit till he finds her.",

        "Meg: Thanks.",
        "Dusty: Are we done?",

        "Henry: Oh, man. What, do I need a restraining order?",
        "Paul: What did Emily say?",
        "Henry: I don't know. She doesn't write, she doesn't call, I really don't -- ah-hah, you owe me eight bucks.",
        "Paul: You tell me where Emily is, I'll buy you a whole case of booze.",
        "Henry: I don't know. She's in Bali, yeah. Or South America. I hear New Zealand's nice this time of year.",
        "Paul: Damn it, Henry, I need to find her, okay? And I came to you because obviously she needs -- she needs help from someone.",
        "Henry: Not my help. Not my help. I told her to get away -- as far away from here as her gorgeous little legs could take her. And if I get my wish, then she's on a beach somewhere now with a mojito in one hand and her very own little Paul Ryan voodoo doll in the other.",

        "Susan: He's changed a lot since then.",

        "Susan: Emily, you want me to kidnap my own grandson -- ship him off to a foreign country where his mother is a fugitive?",
        "Emily: I can't just never see my son again, mother. I need my baby.",
        "Susan: What about his needs?",
        "Emily: I'll make it up to him. I'll make it up to him once I get my life put back together.",
        "Susan: You can only do that here, where it fell apart.",
        "Emily: I can't stay here. I can't stay where Paul is in love with another woman. I cannot do it.",
        "Susan: Forget about Paul! This is about your son! [Emily sobbing] I love Daniel. I love my son. I will give him a good home.",
        "Susan: No, you won't. He'll end up taking care of you, just the way you took care of me.",
        "Emily: I am not you!",
        "Susan: You won't get back the time. Life happens in very small moments -- in the school auditorium, across the breakfast table, doing homework. That's the way you raise a happy, healthy son. And maybe I didn't do it for you, but I'm begging you to do it for your son.",
        "Emily: Don't you understand? Tom won't let me, the police won't let me.",
        "Susan: Honey, if you stay and face the charges, then you have a chance to be a mother to your son --",
        "Emily: No, no! Don't you see? They're gonna turn him against me!",
        "Susan: Don't you understand? That is never gonna happen, he loves you. He cries for you everyday --",
        "Emily: Oh, God, don't say it! I don't want to hear it! Please don't hear it!",
        "Susan: Emily, you have to hear it. Listen to me --",
        "Emily: Listen to me -- you listen to me! If you're not gonna send him -- then he's better off without me.",
        "Susan: How can you say that?",
        "Emily: Just let him -- let him remember the good times, you know, when he lived with me and Hal. He loved that. You know, I was home with him and I made him snacks and I took him to the movies. Because, you're right, those were the good times. I mean, I'm lucky if I'm just a good memory now.",
        "Susan: And what am I supposed to tell him when he asks me where you are?",
        "Emily: Tell him I'm dead.",
        "Susan: Emily?",
        "Emily: Just do it! It's cleaner that way. Just do it!",

        "Carly: Well, I stopped him before he got down on his knees.",
        "Gwen: Look, I know you probably don't feel much like going out right now --",
        "Carly: No, I'm fine. This looks like a fun night.",
        "Gwen: You're okay?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I'm here to have fun, not cry about my marriage.",
        "Gwen: Well, I'm really glad that you're here. Actually, I have to go check on a couple of things --",

        "Carly: Just to do whatever someone does before they sing.",
        "Will: Okay, do you mind if I --",
        "Carly: No, go ahead. Hey, Will -- thanks for inviting me.",
        "Casey: When did she leave?",

        "Jennifer: No -- it's not that simple.",

        "Jennifer: I don't think that he really loved Emily.",

        "Paul: Not unless there's a certified check involved, no.",
        "Henry: Oh, oh, that's really funny coming from the runaway groom.",
        "Paul: When did you talk to her last?",
        "Henry: A little before Dusty reappeared. Hey, help me out here. Help me wrap my olives around this idea, Paul. You got a woman who loves you more than your own mother, and she's a looker, she's really easy on the eye, and she's willing to break commandments for you. Now, would you please explain to me, what is not enough for you there?",
        "Paul: If you talk to Emily, please let her know that I need to speak with her.",
        "Henry: Why? She's gonna ask --",
        "Paul: So I can get through to her.",
        "Henry: Through to -- you tried that ace on New Year's Eve, you know. And there's very few people who know where and when their lives fall apart. Emily has the misfortune of knowing the exact date, place and time. So you tried to get through to her that night, you did, and you blew it, you blew it. I wouldn't press your luck, she's gotten to be a much better shot since then.",

        "Emily: Okay, okay, you distract her, okay? You take care of that and cover for me with Hal.",
        "Susan: Honey -- okay, I'll try, but how can I let you walk out of here?",
        "Emily: Think about -- think about our trip to the beach. Listen to me. I was nine. You were sober. We were happy. We swam. We ate ice cream for breakfast. See, I'm telling you, kids remember the good things.",
        "Susan: I love you.",

        "Casey: Well, you can leave after we talk. Come here. Look, I got you flowers.",

        "Katie: Oh, well, that's not the way to get on his good side. I'm sorry. We're supposed to be in the party mood and I'm ruining it.",
        "Mike: You know, when I got back from Latvia, I thought this was gonna be it for us -- now we're finally gonna be happy and together and -- I don't know, nothing seems to be working out the way we planned. Maybe we should postpone the wedding.",

        "Carly: I will drive myself.",
        "Nick: You do that and I'll just follow you and pull you over. I mean, it's your choice, Carly.",
        "Lisa: The best thing about Mabel's was the red hots. Well, we intend to keep this place red hot. That's the thing about Crash, we want to keep it hot -- and it's a place to be seen. But first of all, I want to introduce you to two wonderful people -- young people who have put the music together for us tonight. My grandson over there, Casey Hughes. Come up here, darling. Come on, up here. [Applause] And certainly to Gwen Munson. Come up, come up. [Applause] Yes. Let's give them a big round of applause. [Applause]",

        "Hal: She's not thinking rationally.",
        "Susan: But what if something happens? I mean, what if she resists arrest? What if something could happen to her?",
        "Hal: No, nothing's going to happen. Emily's been hurt enough. Tonight, the hurting stops.",
