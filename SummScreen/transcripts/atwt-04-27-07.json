        "Emily is optimistic after her talk with Allison, but Dusty brings her back to reality. Allison assumes Paul's \u0091job' for her is sex for money; Paul is shocked and sets her straight, but does ask her to keep it quiet. Paul gives Allison $100 for motivation. Emily takes Allison's tips, but isn't aware of the extra money she has. Emily and Allison have a girl's night out, but a former John interrupts them. Dusty ushers the man out; Emily and Dusty claim he was a former employee obsessed with Emily. Emily and Dusty grow closer. Allison purchases more drugs. Lucinda and Paul join up to bring Craig down; Paul tells her that he is going to need Allison's help. Lucinda is leery so goes to see Allison, but not before calling the clinic where Rosanna is. Craig flirts with Meg, who acts as if she isn't interested in order to reel him in further. At the farm, Meg lets Craig kiss her, as Holden walks in on them and is disgusted. Paul is upset when he overhears this and tells Meg she is out of the scheme."

        "Holden: Okay, so we have Miranda's birthday present right here. And your backpack with all your overnight things right here. As soon as you sign that card for Mommy, we're good to go.",
        "Natalie: I don't want to go.",
        "Holden: What do you mean you don't want to go? All week you talked about this sleepover. And Miranda, she can't have a birthday party without her best friend there. What's wrong?",
        "Natalie: I don't want to tell about Mommy.",
        "Holden: Well, you don't have to. It's private.",
        "Natalie: Why did she have to go away to get better?",
        "Holden: Well, that's a tough one, Nat. I know it doesn't seem fair, especially after Mommy spent all that time in the hospital. But you know what? She went there to get better. There are a lot of people who are going to help her out. And she's there because she's going to get better faster. I promise. And you know what? She wouldn't want you worrying about her. She wants you to have fun. She wants you to go to parties. So you need to do that. Do me a favor. Take that envelope, seal it up, and go drop it in that mailbox over there, okay? Can you do that for me?",
        "Lucinda: Hey.",
        "Holden: Hey.",
        "Lucinda: You're such a good father.",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Holden: Don't feel like one.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you are. You know just what to say to her to make her feel better.",
        "Holden: Yeah, well, Nat's easy. All she needs a hug and a trip to the mall. Faith, on the other hand --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, what now?",
        "Holden: I let her go to this pep rally with Parker today. And I'm just worried that somebody is going to say something or do something to upset her. And I'm like, \"Go, have a good time,\" when all I wanted to do was lock her up in her room.",
        "Lucinda: You can't do that. I mean, you can't. Even in the olden days, I couldn't. I tried hard enough.",
        "Holden: What the hell has happened to this family?",
        "Lucinda: I just can't stand it.",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lucinda: I just can't stand it that you -- you're in pain and yet, Craig gets off scott free. He should be suffering for what he's done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: My, my, my, you look beautiful this evening.",
        "Meg: Craig --",
        "Craig: But then again, you always do.",
        "Meg: Catch me at the end of my shift at the diner.",
        "Craig: Is that an invitation?",
        "Meg: Craig, look, I didn't expect to see you here.",
        "Craig: Really? You're telling me you chose this and it wasn't on the off chance we just might meet and make some beautiful music together?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Craig: No, I got to tell you, me being this intuitive guy and everything, I really get this impression that you're not exactly happy I just showed up.",
        "Meg: I'm just -- waiting for someone.",
        "Craig: You're waiting for Paul, and you don't want to tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey. Fancy meeting you here.",
        "Dusty: Wow.",
        "Emily: Wow, what?",
        "Dusty: You're smiling. I mean, it's been a while since I've seen that.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, I smile when I bump into a real friend.",
        "Dusty: Uh-huh. You're in a good mood. What's going on?",
        "Emily: Last night, Dusty, everything changed. Everything changed. Alison and I had the most amazing talk.",
        "Dusty: Really?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Yeah, and you know what? I was thinking -- I think it's a good thing we were so hard on her. Because she gets it. She really -- she really gets it. So I wanted to do something nice for her. I bought her a beautiful summer dress.",
        "Dusty: Sounds like a nice talk.",
        "Emily: Yeah, it was. She's really going to try, you know, so I wanted to give her something to look forward to. She always loved summer and parties and hanging out with her friends --",
        "Dusty: Hey, Emily --",
        "Emily: She gets to live her life again. She gets to be a kid again.",
        "Dusty: Sit down with me, okay?",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Dusty: What, I don't want to spoil your mood --",
        "Emily: What's wrong? But --",
        "Dusty: But I think you're getting your hopes up too high.",
        "Emily: What do you mean? Dusty, we got her out of that horrible place.",
        "Dusty: Emily, we didn't save Alison. We just moved her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: You want some coffee? It really stinks here.",
        "Paul: Uh, well then, I'll pass. Thanks for meeting with me.",
        "Alison: Yes, you're very lucky I was able to squeeze you in my jam-packed schedule. My days have just been jam-packed.",
        "Paul: Right. I said on the phone, I have a proposition for you.",
        "Alison: Yeah, so what are we talking about here? What's the job and what's the pay?",
        "Paul: Well, before we get into specifics, I need to know that what we talk about here remains confidential.",
        "Alison: Like, I need to use discretion? Well, that kind of goes without saying, doesn't it?",
        "Paul: I'm not sure I understand what you mean.",
        "Alison: Oh, come on, Paul. I know what you want and I know why you're here. Me, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You know what?",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Holden: Not a good time.",
        "Lucinda: Why?",
        "Holden: I don't think I'm ready to hear another Craig is the root of all evil speech.",
        "Lucinda: Me neither. Can I do anything? Anything at all? I mean, the kids, anything --",
        "Holden: Yeah, you can stop by the house, spend some time with them. They need to know that their family is still in place. You're a very important part of this family, you know.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, but you know -- you know you're the most important part. You gotta take care of yourself.",
        "Holden: You know, you're right. I've got four kids. I do need to take care of myself. Do you know what you need to do?",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Holden: Go after Craig. Get even. Take him down. Nat! Get out of that fountain! Think about it, okay? See ya.",
        "Lucinda: Right, right. Craig should -- he should get what's coming to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I am not waiting for Paul.",
        "Craig: Well, you didn't put on that dress for meeting with your book club.",
        "Meg: I don't belong to a book club.",
        "Craig: And you're not waiting for Paul.",
        "Meg: No, I'm trying to move on.",
        "Craig: Clearly, you don't want me hanging around to see who shows up.",
        "Meg: Well, you're right about one thing. I don't want you hanging around. Mainly because I don't like spending time with someone who thinks I'm a liar. Especially someone whose own regard for the truth is -- nonexistent.",
        "Craig: Why do I like it when you talk to me like that?",
        "Meg: Because everything about you is perverse. Tony, can I have my check, please?",
        "Craig: Tony, you can put that on my tab.",
        "Meg: No, I am paying my own way these days.",
        "Craig: Meg, look, I am more than happy to cancel my dinner meeting.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Craig: Why? Paul Ryan stands you up, I just happen by -- you don't think that's kismet?",
        "Meg: Whoa, wait a second! For the last time, and it really isn't any of your business, but Paul didn't stand me up.",
        "Craig: Well, there couldn't be another guy that stupid or that blind.",
        "Meg: Well apparently, the fact that I've been suspended from the hospital, not once, but twice, has given young Dr. Kaufman a case of cold feet.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, who's he, besides a jerk?",
        "Meg: Look, I don't blame him. Residents probably shouldn't date nurses who kill people.",
        "Craig: Meg, Meg, I hate it when you do that to yourself. You are this remarkable, beautiful woman, and you treat yourself like --",
        "Meg: Like a waitress at a diner? Which is exactly what I am, no matter what I'm wearing. So why don't you go to your dinner and let me make a dignified exit.",
        "Craig: Please, just --",
        "Meg: Good night, Craig.",
        "Craig: Look, you know, you said that you were ready to start dating people -- start seeing new people -- why not me? Why don't we just close the deal we were negotiating yesterday?",
        "Meg: I am ready to see new people. With the emphasis on new. [Meg leaves the room, Craig goes look for her, she hides behind a corner and get out her cell phone] Paul, it's me. I think I hooked him. But we need to be real careful about reeling him in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We got her out of Vegas, but she's still Alison.",
        "Emily: Don't, don't, okay? I'm grateful for everything you've done, but you were not there last night, okay? She totally let down her guard with me. You know, she wasn't tough and stubborn and mad. She was just Ali. My little Ali. And she hugged me and she told me that she loved me.",
        "Dusty: I'm sure she does. It doesn't mean she's going to get straight.",
        "Emily: Maybe she understands now. She gets it. She's working hard. She's doing the best she can. And if all I do is disapprove of her, what good is that?",
        "Dusty: Hey, nobody said tough love was easy.",
        "Emily: You know what your problem is? You have no faith.",
        "Dusty: A good hug, a talk, a few tears --",
        "Emily: She meant what she said. She meant what she said. You weren't there --",
        "Dusty: And all the ground rules fly out the window -- I'm sure she did. But she's got to play it by the rules. And she's got to know that the rules are enforced.",
        "Emily: I am her sister. Not a parole officer.",
        "Dusty: I know it's not fun, but hey, you know, she's your sister. You're worried about her.",
        "Emily: And I'm an idiot. You're right. You're right. I'm a total idiot.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah, yeah, beat yourself up --",
        "Emily: No, you know what, I'm acting like my mother. I've got blinders on.",
        "Dusty: That's going to help everybody.",
        "Emily: I just want everything to be all right, you know?",
        "Dusty: Well, if you do, then you gotta hang tough.",
        "Emily: I know. So what do you think? My higher power sent you my way to knock some sense into me?",
        "Dusty: Probably so. Look, I'm not trying to take away last night. I'm glad you and your sister had a nice time.",
        "Emily: No, no, you're not. You didn't. You just put it in perspective, you know. So now, I'm going to go to the diner and toughly and lovingly make sure Alison goes straight home.",
        "Dusty: She's lucky to have you, Em.",
        "Emily: I'm lucky to have you, Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You think I want you?",
        "Alison: Me and my nice discretion.",
        "Paul: And that that's a business transaction?",
        "Alison: Ready to talk terms?",
        "Paul: If you think that's what I'm interested in, why are you still talking to me? Why aren't you screaming at me or calling the cops?",
        "Alison: That's not what you had in mind?",
        "Paul: You seem pretty casual about -- well, about what, exactly?",
        "Alison: Ryan, look, with your history, don't you think we could skip the lecture? I know how you treated my sister, so I don't need to hear from you what's naughty or nice.",
        "Paul: How old are you? Who are you?",
        "Alison: Look, knowing you as long as I have, I thought that's what you wanted. Obviously, it's not, so could you stop wasting my time and clue me in on what you do want? What?",
        "Paul: You were going to go through with it?",
        "Alison: No. I was going to set you up and then pay you back. Really, Mr. Ryan, what kind of girl do you think I am?",
        "Paul: I'm a little scared to find out. Did something happen to you when you were gone?",
        "Alison: I grew up, okay? Look, I've been on my feet, smelling grease and stale coffee for about eight hours. We've covered that I have to be discreet. So could you tell me what it is I have to be discreet about? Like now.",
        "Paul: Okay. Well, I have a little deal for you, okay? But before we go into the specifics, it requires, as we said before, discretion.",
        "Alison: Okay, what?",
        "Paul: You can't tell Emily about this. If Emily finds out about this, the deal's over.",
        "Alison: She won't. What is it? Wait a minute, you don't want me to steal something or anything --",
        "Paul: No, no, it's nothing illegal. I just -- I have a little acting job for you.",
        "Alison: And you always wanted to direct, huh?",
        "Paul: Well, no, you'd be playing a part, okay, but it wouldn't be on stage or on camera.",
        "Alison: So, who do I play? And when do I start? How much do I make?",
        "Paul: Well, I can't get into all of that until I know that everything's in place.",
        "Alison: Man, you've been wasting a whole lot of my time.",
        "Paul: Wait, wait -- hold on, hold on -- maybe, maybe you know, if I give you -- a little -- a little deposit, if that'll keep you interested in the project?",
        "Alison: I've always been a huge fan of Ben Franklin's.",
        "Paul: I'm sure you're a real history buff. Look, I'll be in touch, okay? But don't talk to anyone. Sorry.",
        "Alison: Only my acting coach. Kidding.",
        "Paul: Okay. Later.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Jesse: What?",
        "Alison: It's me, Alison.",
        "Jesse: What do you want?",
        "Alison: What do you think I want?",
        "Jesse: Just to remind you, I need to see your money before you see my product. And this time, you better make that trip alone. I didn't like you wasting my time.",
        "Alison: Yeah, it being so valuable and all.",
        "Jesse: You know what? I don't need this.",
        "Alison: Look, I'm sorry. Really bad day, but get me the meth and I can be super friendly.",
        "Jesse: All right. Meet me in old town in five minutes.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'm leaving right now.",
        "Emily: I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you.",
        "(Crashing)",
        "Jesse: I'll be by the bookstore and I'm not waiting around. Are you there?",
        "Alison: Great. Can't wait. Bye. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?",
        "Emily: No, I think that's my line.",
        "Alison: I've got to go.",
        "Emily: Where, Alison?",
        "Alison: I'm not telling you because it's none of your damned business. And you can threaten me all you want but it's still my life --",
        "Emily: Sit down, Alison. Sit down. I thought we were clear on this, huh? I pick you up after your shift and you don't make plans with your friends without clearing it with me first.",
        "Alison: Right. You and Dusty drag me back here so I can't have a life.",
        "Emily: No, having a life is exactly what I'm talking about. A life where you actually make it to your 30s.",
        "Alison: I'm getting so tired of this.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, too bad. That's just too bad. The crap you've been putting in your body kills. And I'm not taking any chances of losing you. So, if you don't like it, that's -- that's just too bad.",
        "Alison: So last night, all the hearts and flowers, it didn't mean anything. You love me, but you don't trust me as far as you can throw me.",
        "Emily: That's right.",
        "Alison: That's not love. That's control.",
        "Emily: No Alison, that's love.",
        "Alison: You're enjoying this.",
        "Emily: Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, this is a real blast. This is exactly how I want to live my life. Half babysitter, half enforcer? And you know what the best part of my job is? I get to see all that gratitude in your eyes. So, you know what? Want to go home, and make some popcorn and glare at each other tonight?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Emily: No, me neither. I want you to remember something. You're the one who pulled the stunts that got us into this fun place.",
        "Alison: I was just going to meet a friend. And when you think it's something else, I get angry.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm sorry but it's going to be a long time before I trust you again. And it's not because I'm not on your side, Ali. It's because the stakes are too high -- would you look at me, please? We both know I'm not coming down hard on you because you skipped homeroom. You put your life at risk, Ali. That's why I'm not backing off.",
        "Alison: You've changed. You're not quite the flake I always thought you were.",
        "Emily: You thought I was a flake? And now you don't? Suddenly, I'm a little warm and fuzzy inside.",
        "Alison: I have that effect on people.",
        "Emily: Okay, okay, instead of popcorn and glaring, what do you say -- I don't know, what do you say we go out somewhere and have some fun, just the two of us?",
        "Alison: Fun? You and me? Together?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I bought this dress for you and it would be such a shame to waste it at home.",
        "Alison: So, now you're picking out my clothes for me. That was a joke. I say something nasty when I really mean -- thank you.",
        "Emily: Wow, you're saying an awful lot of \"thank you\" these days.",
        "Alison: So, where's this dress?",
        "Emily: In my car.",
        "Alison: Go get it and I'll go change in the ladies room.",
        "Emily: Okay. Oh, I almost forgot.",
        "Alison: What? You got me shoes, too?",
        "Emily: Your tips.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Emily: Your tips. I keep the money. Remember? Make sure it doesn't lead you astray. I'll save it for you, Ali. I'm sorry. I can't back down on what I already said.",
        "Alison: Everything you're doing, you're doing for me.",
        "Emily: For us, Ali. I'll be right back.",
        "[Alison calls Jesse]",
        "Jesse: What?",
        "Alison: Look, I can't get there right away. But I made tons of money today, so just hang around. I'll make it worth your while. And I'll be wearing a great new dress, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Holden?",
        "Holden: Dusty. Hey.",
        "Dusty: Are you okay?",
        "Holden: I lost track of time. I totally lost track of time.",
        "Dusty: You look a little out of it.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I dropped Natalie off for a sleep-over and realized I had some more time with the sitter. I couldn't get myself to go home. Some father I am, huh?",
        "Dusty: You know, in my little experience as a dad, I've realized you got to get your down time.",
        "Holden: Yeah. I told myself I wanted a cup of coffee. But I think what I really wanted was just a little time away from anyone less than three feet tall.",
        "Dusty: I remember thinking, if I could get a half hour alone. Now, I'd give anything to be with him all the time.",
        "Holden: Craig Montgomery strikes again.",
        "Dusty: Sorry about Lily.",
        "Holden: Yeah, you know what bothers me most about that? What did Craig know about my wife that I didn't? How was he able to just lead her around like that?",
        "Dusty: Nobody knows more about obsessing over Montgomery than me. The things I did or didn't do. But then I think --",
        "Holden: Yeah?",
        "Dusty: I just think about beating him up, you know.",
        "Holden: I didn't think anyone could make me laugh today.",
        "Dusty: Well, hang in there. Your kids are lucky to have you.",
        "Holden: Thanks. I've got to run. Good talking to you.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Montgomery's going down sometime. He's got to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: You're late.",
        "Paul: Oh, stop. Like you have anything better to do since you lost your company.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I think I'll just let that pass. That's just another reason for me to absolutely despise Craig. Add on to the fact that I have to deal with you.",
        "Paul: We're going to be the best of friends. May I?",
        "Lucinda: Sure. Help yourself. I found the merlot a little aggressive, with a disappointing finish. I think it will suit you.",
        "Paul: Shh. Shh. Checking a message.",
        "Lucinda: You have to do that? I thought you were clairvoyant. Don't you just see them?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you keep talking like that, and maybe we wouldn't be best friends.",
        "Meg: Paul, it's me. I think I hooked him. But we need to be real careful about reeling him in.",
        "Lucinda: What's wrong?",
        "Paul: That was Meg.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, yes?",
        "Paul: She told me about that little conversation you had with her.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you mean, she repeated to you the fact that I'm not sure that I want or need your help --",
        "Paul: As usually, you have it entirely backwards. Okay, I'm going to get Craig Montgomery. And I know how I'm going to do it. But it's my decision, if and how you fit into my plan.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my, oh, I don't know if I'm going to be able to measure up.",
        "Paul: You know what? I don't think you can. I'm very busy. I have a lot to do and none of it really includes trading insults with you.",
        "Lucinda: Wait! Wait, wait! Hey, wait!",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Lucinda: Do you really know how to get this guy?",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: I mean, can you really, really hurt him?",
        "Paul: I can hurt him where he lives.",
        "Lucinda: How do I help?",
        "Paul: Well, you can start by not trying to talk Meg into poisoning Craig.",
        "Lucinda: She told you about that, too?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you don't say or do anything like that to Meg again. I'll get Montgomery. But Meg needs to be protected in all of this.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. But did she make it clear, I'm not just playing around with words.",
        "Paul: We don't want to kill Montgomery. We want him to live in hell.",
        "Lucinda: Right. We want him to live in hell, okay. I never thought I'd say this to you, but I really like the way you think. So, what are you going to do?",
        "Paul: I'm going to tear a page from Craig's book. He specializes in exploiting people's vulnerabilities. Taking what people love and care about the most and using it against them.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, but not -- not, not -- Lucy, not Johnny. Not Meg.",
        "Paul: No. None of them.",
        "Lucinda: Well, then, who? I mean, they're the only people in the whole world that he likes. Oh, wait. And --",
        "Paul: He'll never know what hit him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: Well, isn't it obvious? I'm here for you.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I'm not sure you thought this through. This isn't the safest place in the world for you.",
        "Craig: Oh, there's no one else here. There's just you and me.",
        "Meg: Yeah, but in any moment, any one of, I don't know, four or five people could come in here. And any one of them would like nothing better than to blow you to kingdom come. So I think you need to leave.",
        "Craig: Do you know what was really nice?",
        "Meg: Ruining Lily's life?",
        "Craig: Seeing you come in here smiling and humming.",
        "Meg: Well, you took care of that, didn't you? I'm not smiling and humming now.",
        "Craig: Think about it. I mean, you got stood up tonight. You should be bitter and morose. But you are -- you're downright lighthearted.",
        "Meg: Oh, here it comes.",
        "Craig: You know, I know that our history together is complicated.",
        "Meg: Yeah, understatement of the year.",
        "Craig: But all this bumping into each other, this sparring that we do -- we can't help it. It makes us happy.",
        "Meg: I was enjoying a nice spring night. I saw my first crocus. And that made me happy.",
        "Craig: Right. So I've decided to believe you.",
        "Meg: Be still my heart.",
        "Craig: Because seeing you tonight is better than spring. So I have decided to believe you about Paul because -- because I want you more than I want to be smart.",
        "Meg: I told you, Craig. I'm moving on.",
        "Craig: I know. With me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Do you remember Alison Stewart?",
        "Lucinda: Sure.",
        "Paul: She's the key to all of this.",
        "Lucinda: How?",
        "Paul: Well, I bumped into her. She's completely changed.",
        "Lucinda: Anything would be an improvement.",
        "Paul: There was something about her. And I just couldn't figure it out. It was nagging at me. It was something about the way she carries herself, the way she spoke. And then it hit me. She is Rosanna.",
        "Lucinda: She's Rosanna?",
        "Paul: She sounds so much like her, it's spooky.",
        "Lucinda: But she's a child.",
        "Paul: No, not anymore. She's working at Al's. And I went to talk to her, and I think she might be motivated to find another way to make a buck.",
        "Lucinda: You think that she could possibly pull this thing off?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, she's kind of a loose cannon -- but she might be just what we need.",
        "Lucinda: And Craig -- Craig would think Rosanna has come out of her coma. The only woman that he really loves.",
        "Paul: The only woman who can really put him back in prison.",
        "Lucinda: That's nice. But you haven't spoken to the girl yet, have you?",
        "Paul: I haven't spoken to Alison because I'm not entirely sure that I can trust her.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, for heaven's sake. How can you get her to work on Craig if you're not even sure that you can trust her? And just because she sounds like Rosanna doesn't mean that she can convince Craig.",
        "Paul: I think she can. It's not just the quality of her voice. I mean, she -- she --",
        "Lucinda: Yes?",
        "Paul: I don't know. I think if I can convince her that this gig is her ticket out of town, she'll give the performance of a lifetime.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: To the healing power of new clothes. And Alison, who looks fantastic in them.",
        "Alison: Yeah. This is a little weird. I spent all day smelling like grease, and then I spend the evening here in a dress that probably costs more than what I'll make in a month.",
        "Emily: Okay, I know working at the diner isn't a lot of fun, Honey, but --",
        "Alison: But it's good for me, right?",
        "Emily: Well, I think you need structure right now. I don't think it's good for you to have too much time on your hands. You need to keep busy.",
        "Alison: Right.",
        "Emily: Come on, it doesn't all have to be bad. You know, I was thinking, maybe I'll renew my membership at the club. I know how much you love swimming. [Alison scoffs] Would you stop? I'm just trying to -- I'm not acting like I have all the answers, here, 'cause clearly, I don't, okay? So --",
        "Alison: Yeah, Mom told me about you and Paul. It must have been awful.",
        "Emily: Yeah. I mean, I don't know what she told you, but there were definitely times that I didn't think I was going to make it. But that's why when I found out you were doing drugs, Honey, it scared the hell out of me.",
        "Alison: So we'll swim our way back to mental health this summer.",
        "Emily: I don't care what we do. As long as we do it together, okay?",
        "Client: Well, well. Both of you in one place. How lucky can you get?",
        "Client: I'm standing here, working out the possibilities, thinking this is like winning the lottery --",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Client: I'm talking about endless possibilities. I'm talking about Nirvana.",
        "Dusty: You're disturbing the ladies. You and I are need to chat.",
        "Client: Hang on a second.",
        "Alison: What's going on?",
        "Emily: Just leave it alone, Alison.",
        "Dusty: Listen carefully to me. You're never going to see these women again. You're going to walk out of here right now. You understand? Or I'm going to break every bone in your body.",
        "Client: You don't understand, this one's a professional. The other one, she does this thing --",
        "Dusty: You're a moron. Get out of here. I'm telling you, you're going to get -- get out of here!",
        "Client: Okay, all right!",
        "Alison: What's going on? What the hell just happened there?",
        "Dusty: Sorry about that. Sorry. He's not going to bother you again.",
        "Alison: Who is he, Emily? You look really upset.",
        "Emily: He -- he --",
        "Dusty: He used to work at the paper, he's obsessed with your sister. Stalker kind of thing. We fired him.",
        "Alison: He didn't look like someone who was fired. He looked pretty happy to see her.",
        "Dusty: Well, he's delusional. It takes him a while to see that the attraction isn't mutual.",
        "Alison: Wait a minute, he said both of you, like I was part of it, too.",
        "Dusty: Like I said, he's delusional.",
        "Alison: Man, he really freaked you out. Are you okay? I'm sorry.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks to Dusty.",
        "Alison: Man, you got a real knight in shining armor thing going on, don't you?",
        "Dusty: Sometimes it takes somebody bigger than the other person to make them listen.",
        "Alison: You know what? I'm feeling a real \"three's a crowd\" thing going on here, so I think I'm going to leave you two alone.",
        "Emily: No, I don't know about that, Honey. I don't --",
        "Alison: Come on. I can get home by myself. And Dusty can give you a ride.",
        "Emily: No, I just don't think it's a good idea --",
        "Alison: Look, you're really upset and you obviously want to talk to Dusty alone. You think I'd let you down at a time like this?",
        "Emily: No. Not at all. Of course not. Of course not. I won't be late, okay?",
        "Alison: You better not be, young lady. See ya, Sir Galahad.",
        "Emily: I don't know how you knew what -- who he was. What he was. The way you covered for me, thank you. What?",
        "Dusty: I hope that wasn't a mistake.",

        "Paul: Well?",
        "Lucinda: Let us proceed. But with caution.",
        "Paul: I'll proceed however I feel like proceeding. You, you can either help me or take a pass, but it's important that you know that this is my show.",
        "Lucinda: Don't we have better thing to do than to argue about billing?",
        "Paul: It's not just ego. This thing won't work unless you know that I'm in charge.",
        "Lucinda: Fine, fine.",
        "Paul: And just so we're clear? No more little chats with Meg.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Darling, I'm way ahead of you on that. You'll be keeping her out of this because she isn't stable.",
        "Paul: Our working relationship might function better if you keep opinions like that to yourself.",
        "Lucinda: Fine. Are we done?",
        "Paul: Yeah, we're done. I'll be in touch.",
        "Lucinda: Okay.",
        "Paul: By the way --",
        "Lucinda: Yeah?",
        "Paul: Your merlot -- it's not just aggressive. It's just kinda rude.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, okay. Oh, me. Okay. Gute nacht. Good evening. This is Mrs. Walsh, Lucinda Walsh, from the states, and I'm just calling again to check on my darling friend, her state -- Rosanna Cabot. Oh, no change. I'm so sorry. Could you tell me when I might be able to speak, like tomorrow morning, to the director of the clinic? Now? Wunderbar.",

        "Holden: This is just perfect. I was wondering what might happen to make this day even more fun. Get out.",
        "Craig: Look, I didn't know you would be here. I didn't mean to intrude.",
        "Holden: I said get out. You're not welcome here. Move it!",

        "Holden: Thank you. That's just what I needed to see.",
        "Meg: I didn't know he was coming here. And you weren't here.",
        "Holden: You want to know why I'm here? Because Natalie had a meltdown, and I'm here to get her blanket because her mother isn't around to comfort her anymore because Craig ended up using her as a pawn in one of his crooked schemes. And here you are making out with him in the kitchen.",
        "Meg: Holden, you don't understand. It's not what you think, okay? I hate what he's done.",
        "Holden: You didn't seem to hate having his hands all over you, Meg. I don't get it. I don't get you at all anymore.",

        "Emily: God, if she ever found out what I did, Dusty -- I mean, I couldn't live with myself. Not that I wouldn't deserve everything I get. I mean -- but Alison would be the one who ended up getting hurt in the end, not me.",
        "Dusty: Why do you say things like that? That you deserve anything that happens to you.",
        "Emily: Why? Because I do, that's why.",
        "Dusty: You think Alison deserves anything that happens to her?",
        "Emily: No!",

        "Emily: She's not a fake like I am.",
        "Dusty: You know what, you're turning yourself inside out to take care of your sister, and she's not making it easy. And P.S., phonies don't smile the way you smile when you do something nice for your sister like buy her a new dress. That's very nice. So there.",
        "Emily: Wow. Wow.",
        "Dusty: \"Wow\" what?",
        "Emily: Wow. I don't know. I just -- I was just thinking -- I wish I could see myself the way you see me.",

So, we're not going to play like you're dangerous, 'cause I've seen dangerous and you're not that. What this is, is a local product supplier with a preferred customer who deserves respect.
