        "Jade learns of Luke and Noah's kidnapping and is desperate to help. Lily promises to get a photo to Jade for her to distribute soon, as Jade heads off to meet Casey. Damian uses software to age the daughter of the slain woman, wants Lily to see if she knows her, but Holden won't let Lily go, and instead goes to see Damian himself. Noah is getting worse, as Luke struggles to keep him conscious. Zoe agrees to get medicine for Noah if Luke will do whatever she wants. Jade leans on Casey for support, as Allison sees this and doesn't react well until Casey explains. Allison still is leery about getting involved and messing with the police investigation, but Jade and Casey won't be deterred and Casey and Allison argue because of this. Allison and Zoe come face to face, as she poses as a nurse; Allison realizes who she is and tries to stall her, but Zoe catches on and shoves Allison in a closet. Zac kills the police officer, who is guarding Lily's house, then poses as a police officer himself, and gets Lily to accompany him to her office where they are supposedly meeting Margo. Lily figures it out, as Zac orders her to make the money transfer. She won't until she receives proof that Luke and Noah are alive. Zac acquiesces and Lily is allowed to talk with Luke, but she also learns the Noah has been shot. Holden is worried when he comes back with the age-enhanced photo and doesn't find Lily or the police officer. Lily sends an SOS to Holden before she transfers the money to Zac and Zoe's account. Holden saves Lily, as Zac was contemplating killing her. Jade and Casey come up empty in their search but find Allison locked in a closet. They end up with one more piece of evidence \u0096 a storage locker receipt. Casey and Allison lean on each other for support \u0096 finally, much to Jade's sadness. Luke pleads with Zoe to give Noah his medicine, but she wants him to agree to do what she wants. Zac comes back with news that they have the money, which pleases Zoe so much. However, the rest of the plan still needs to happen, as Zac begrudgingly leaves Zoe to it. Damian shows up at Lily's to find the police officer killed, as he runs into Jade, Casey and Allison, who give him the storage locker receipt. He heads over there where he runs into a gun yielding Zac. Luke finally hears of Zoe's twisted plan- she wants him to sleep with her so she can bear a Grimaldi heir."

        "Alison: Hey, Case. Casey? Casey!",
        "Casey: What? Aah!",
        "Alison: Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Aren't you here for work?",
        "Casey: I am a volunteer, remember? As in no pay.",
        "Alison: So you're not here for work.",
        "Casey: No. I am waiting for Jade, who is a half an hour late with the files.",
        "Alison: Uh, did you let the patients know that their ride's gonna be late?",
        "Casey: We don't have anyone scheduled for today. We're actually gonna do a community outreach to let people know we exist, and I'm just enjoying the fact that I'm working with someone who is a bigger screw-up than I am. Baga!",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You should have told me they were kidnapped.",
        "Holden: We're trying to keep it quiet. We didn't want to upset Ethan or the girls.",
        "Jade: I get it! They're young! I'm not! Luke's my best friend. Where is he?",
        "Lily: We don't know.",
        "Jade: Well, what about the police? What are they doing?",
        "Lily: They're doing everything they can.",
        "Jade: You should have told me they were kidnapped. I know they're friends. I could ask around on campus. People might want to tell me stuff more than the cops.",
        "Lily: That might help. The girl that I saw at the drop-off, she was about college age. Maybe she knows Luke and Noah from school.",
        "Jade: Yeah, I should go now. I'm gonna hit up Java and then go to other places.",
        "Holden: You know what? I don't want you out there alone.",
        "Jade: Well, I'm not gonna go alone. Casey and I are supposed to be working. I'm late anyway.",
        "Lily: Well, that should be all right, right?",
        "Holden: Yeah, I guess. Just be careful. Watch your back.",
        "Jade: Hey, this girl you saw, what did she look like?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: Why aren't you watching Luciano's mother?",
        "Zac: She hasn't moved from the house all day, and there are a million people coming in and out, not to mention the cop that's right outside the front door.",
        "Zoe: So you took a food break.",
        "Zac: I brought it for you.",
        "Zoe: Okay, I'm sorry. I'm just freaking out a little.",
        "Zac: You never freak out.",
        "Zoe: I can't help it. We're so close.",
        "Zac: It's all going according to plan, so just let it happen, hmm? And eat something.",
        "Zoe: Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I don't think I've seen her.",
        "Lily: Well, the key is the Pisces pendant. It's hard to miss.",
        "Jade: Okay. I'll get Casey, and we'll get started.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lily: Hello?",
        "Damian: It's me.",
        "Lily: Damian.",
        "Damian: Have they called?",
        "Lily: No, not yet.",
        "Damian: Look, I might have something. Remember I told you I found the photo of Gia Pinnarossa when she was a little girl? Well, there's a computer program that does age enhancement, and I used it on the picture.",
        "Lily: So you have an idea of what she might look like now?",
        "Damian: Yes. I need you to tell me if it looks like the girl you saw at the war memorial.",
        "Lily: I'm on my way. Damian has a photo that might be her. I've got to go see it.",
        "Holden: Wait. Why can't he fax it or e-mail it?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Holden: I'll go get it.",
        "Lily: Holden.",
        "Holden: Lily, I agreed to work with him, but I don't trust him, and I don't want you anywhere near him after he almost got you killed.",
        "Lily: Fine. You go.",
        "Holden: I don't want to leave you here alone.",
        "Lily: Officer Catlin is right outside.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. Stay here.",
        "Lily: I will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Casey's at the hospital. Can you give me a ride?",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Jade: Okay. And if the picture is her, can you please send it to my phone so I can show people?",
        "Lily: Good idea.",
        "Holden: No heroics.",
        "Lily: You either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: You should get back to the house. Luke's mom has to be alone sooner or later.",
        "Zac: First chance I'll get, I'll make my move.",
        "Zoe: Watch out for the cop, he's armed.",
        "Zac: Oh, yeah? So am I. What about the lovebirds?",
        "Zoe: I've got it.",
        "Luke: He's still unconscious. He's sweating really bad. If he has a fever, that means that the wound might be infected.",
        "Zoe: Then you'd better hope they give us the money soon.",
        "Luke: You're not gonna be able to enjoy a penny of that money.",
        "Zoe: I don't think you're in a position to be making threats.",
        "Luke: I know you're gonna kills us once you get the money, but you have to know, my dad is still out there somewhere, and so is the entire Grimaldi family, and once they realize that you've killed one of the Grimaldi heirs, there is nowhere that you and your boyfriend are gonna be able to hide! So now that we understand that, this is what's gonna happen. You are gonna take Noah to the hospital and, in exchange, I will give you the money, and I will let you go!",
        "Zoe: I can't do that.",
        "Luke: Why not?",
        "Zoe: Because of your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Mother, you're already watching the children, and I know you have more radiation coming up. I know that you have help, but you have to conserve your strength. Besides, the police are all over it, and you know Margo. She's gonna find them. Well, no. Not yet. Margo says they're amateurs, and she's sure that soon they're gonna slip up, and we'll be able to find them. Yes. I promise I will call you if anything changes. And, mother, you can call me if you want. Okay. I love you, too.",
        "[Thud]",
        "Lily: Is anyone out there? Officer Catlin? Hello? I'm being silly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zoe: She played games. There has to be a price for that.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, whatever it is, I will pay it. Noah shouldn't be here, Zoe. He didn't do anything! Please, get him to a hospital! I will do whatever you want!",
        "Zoe: There you go, acting like you're in charge again.",
        "Luke: Okay, I'm sorry. Zoe, I know you loved your mother very much, and losing her must have been awful, but, please, do you have to take it out on an innocent human being?",
        "Zoe: He's not innocent! He broke her picture! He shattered it!",
        "Luke: Well, do you think he deserves to die for it? Zoe, please. If you won't take him to the hospital, at least get him some medication for the fever and the pain.",
        "Zoe: If I do that, you'll do anything I ask?",
        "Luke: Yeah, yeah! Anything! Anything you want!",
        "Zoe: I'll try.",
        "Luke: Thank you.",
        "Zoe: But remember, you said anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Well, well, well. Look who decided to grace us with her presence.",
        "Jade: No, I need your help.",
        "Casey: Oh, yes, you do, 'cause you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.",
        "Jade: Shut up, okay?",
        "Casey: Shut -- you're lucky there's not an old lady on a curb somewhere.",
        "Jade: Luke and Noah were kidnapped.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Jade: Yeah, they're being held for ransom.",
        "Casey: Okay. You're not using this as an excuse because you're late? What happened?",
        "Jade: Well, they grabbed Noah, and when Luke realized he was kidnapped, they grabbed him, too.",
        "Casey: Who are they?",
        "Jade: I don't know. One of Luke's cousins who wants the money he inherited.",
        "Casey: Are the Snyders gonna pay?",
        "Jade: If they have to, but there's no guarantee we'll get Luke and Noah back, okay? And his parents and the police are trying everything, and they're not getting anywhere.",
        "Casey: Shh.",
        "Jade: I'm sorry. I'm just so scared.",
        "Casey: No, it's okay. It's okay. Ali, don't go. Luke and Noah are in trouble.",

        "[Knock on door]",
        "Damian: Come in, Lily. The enhanced photo is on the screen.",
        "Holden: Lily isn't here.",
        "Damian: Where is she?",
        "Holden: She's at home in case they call, so I came instead.",
        "Damian: She needs to look at the picture.",
        "Holden: This is the Grimaldi girl?",
        "Damian: This is what Gia Pinnarossa would look like today. Lily needs to tell me if she looks like the girl she saw at the war memorial. You never saw her, right?",
        "Holden: No.",
        "Damian: Well, then she's the only one who could identify her.",
        "Holden: Well, that's why she needs to stay at home where it's safe. Do you have a printer?",
        "Damian: Not in the room.",
        "Holden: I'll go check downstairs.",
        "Damian: Do you have a computer at home?",
        "Holden: Of course.",
        "Damian: Well, then I can e-mail it to her.",
        "Holden: Why didn't you just do that in the first place?",
        "Damian: Honestly, I didn't think of it.",
        "Holden: You keep trying to pull her into this, no matter how dangerous it gets.",
        "Damian: I didn't think she'd be taking her life in her hands by coming to the hotel.",
        "Holden: You didn't think she'd be in danger at war memorial, either. If that lunatic cousin of yours had a gun, Lily could have been killed.",
        "Damian: And if you hadn't interfered, we would have caught her!",
        "Holden: I doubt that.",
        "Damian: I don't, Holden! I don't! Luciano would be free, and everyone would be safe. But you were so suspicious of me that you couldn't even consider the possibility that you might be wrong. You are the one who put Lily in danger, not me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lily: Who is it?",
        "Zac: It's Officer Hazen, Oakdale P.D.",
        "Lily: I thought Officer Catlin was outside.",
        "Zac: Oh, his shift ended. I'm his replacement. I need to talk to you, Ma'am.",
        "Lily: He didn't tell me he'd be leaving.",
        "Zac: Oh, he loses track of time. He's a very intense guy. That's what makes him such a good cop.",
        "Lily: So you'll be outside now, Officer?",
        "Zac: Hazen. Actually, Lieutenant Hughes is at your office. She asked me to take you down there to meet her.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Zac: I'm not sure. She just said I should bring you right away. I'm sure it had something to do with the investigation.",
        "Lily: Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Dark hair, very slender. She wears a necklace with a Pisces pendant.",
        "Alison: You mean, like, the zodiac sign?",
        "Jade: Yeah, the fish. Have you guys seen anyone like that?",
        "Casey: Not that I remember.",
        "Jade: Okay. I'm gonna go to some college-campus hangouts, ask some questions. Hopefully, at some point, Lily and Holden will send me a picture to my phone.",
        "Casey: Yeah, that will help. It's a lot easier for people to remember if they see a picture. We should start at Java.",
        "Jade: You're gonna come with me?",
        "Casey: Of course. They're my friends, too.",
        "Jade: Great. Lily and Holden didn't want me to go alone.",
        "Alison: Why? You think it's dangerous?",
        "Jade: Well, they're just freaking out right now.",
        "Alison: Then maybe you guys shouldn't do it, then.",
        "Casey: No one's gonna jump the three of us in broad daylight.",
        "Alison: Well, I can't go. I'm on a shift.",
        "Casey: Fine. Then we'll keep you posted.",
        "Alison: Aren't you guys supposed to be doing, like, outreach today or something?",
        "Jade: This is a lot more important!",
        "Alison: Well, what do you think you're gonna be able to do that the cops aren't doing?",
        "Jade: Well, we know a lot of people from O.U. they might be more comfortable talking to us than the cops.",
        "Casey: Yeah, and if they've seen her around, they might be able to help us, lead us to where they're holding Luke and Noah.",
        "Alison: And then what? You're just gonna charge in and screw up another rescue like you did with me and Matt?",
        "Jade: Look, I'm not gonna stand here and argue with you about this. If you don't want to come, don't come.",
        "Casey: Jade, wait.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I just don't want you to get in more trouble.",
        "Casey: What are you so afraid of?",
        "Alison: I'm not! It's --",
        "Casey: Yes, you are! You're always afraid! You're so afraid to act on anything that you do nothing!",
        "Alison: Are we still talking about Luke and Noah here?",
        "Casey: I don't know what we're talking about, but I don't feel like talking anymore, okay? I'm gonna go help Jade. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I really don't have time for this.",
        "Damian: Look, all I'm saying is you've been wrong about me from the start. I didn't kidnap the boys, but I'm your best hope of finding them. So, can we just put our differences aside until they're safe?",
        "Holden: All right. Fine. Just keep Lily out of it.",
        "Damian: I just want her to look at the photo! If the girl she saw is Gia Pinnarossa, I can take the picture to people who will know how to find her.",
        "Holden: You don't mean the police, do you?",
        "Damian: I'll get it to them, too.",
        "Holden: All right. We'll call you as soon as Lily sees the photo.",
        "Damian: Well, thank you. And, Holden, whatever you may think of me, I love Luke as much as you do, and I'll do anything to get him home safely. Anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Noah. Noah. Hey, hey. Wake up. Wake up. Yeah, wake up. Talk to me. Talk to me. Oh, thank God.",
        "Noah: Hey.",
        "Luke: Hey. How are you?",
        "Noah: I can't move.",
        "Luke: Yeah, it's 'cause we're tied up. Zac and Zoe, remember? We're hostages.",
        "Noah: Oh, yeah.",
        "Luke: Yeah. How are you? Are you okay?",
        "Noah: Uh, yeah, never better.",
        "Luke: No, no, no, no. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth, baby. Don't try to be a hero.",
        "Noah: It hurts. It hurts a lot, and it feels like I'm burning up. Is it really hot in here?",
        "Luke: You have a fever from a gunshot wound. It might be infected, but I sent Zoe to get you some medicine. Yeah, it was hard.",
        "Noah: Lucky she has a thing for your dimples. Can't say I blame her. What's she want in exchange?",
        "Luke: She just wants the Grimaldi money.",
        "Noah: She's gonna get that anyway.",
        "Luke: She didn't mention anything else.",
        "Noah: That's 'cause they're gonna kill us afterwards.",
        "Luke: No, no. No, they're not.",
        "Noah: Please don't lie to me. Not now.",
        "Luke: Noah, why would she go get you that medicine if she was gonna kill us?",
        "Noah: I don't know.",
        "Luke: We are gonna get out of here, we're gonna get you to a hospital, and then my dimples are gonna be yours forever.",
        "Noah: That's good, 'cause I'm pretty sure Zac's lost interest in mine.",
        "Luke: I love you so much.",
        "Noah: I love you, too. I'm gonna go back to sleep, okay?",
        "Luke: No. Noah, Noah, Noah, don't. Don't, please.",
        "Noah: I am. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Luke: No! Please, Noah! Please, wake up! Noah!",

        "Jade: So you're sure you haven't seen her?",
        "Java worker: A lot of people come in here. I don't remember anyone with that kind of necklace. Is Noah okay?",
        "Jade: We just have to find him.",
        "Java worker: I'll ask the staff and anyone else who knows him.",
        "Jade: Okay. And you have my cell phone number. Call me if anyone recognizes the description.",
        "Casey: I'm here.",
        "Jade: I didn't think you were coming.",
        "Casey: Well, any luck?",
        "Jade: Not yet.",

        "Alison: Can I help you?",
        "Zoe: Yeah. Where do you keep the drugs on this floor?",
        "Alison: You don't look familiar.",
        "Zoe: Yeah. I work on four. Dr. Robinson sent me up here.",
        "Alison: Oh. Oncology's on three.",
        "Zoe: He's seeing a patient on four.",
        "Alison: Dr. Robinson is a woman.",
        "Zoe: Well, it must be a different Dr. Robinson, then. Are you gonna help me or not?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Zoe: The meds?",
        "Alison: Oh, sorry. Right. In there.",
        "Zoe: Something wrong?",
        "Alison: No. Nothing.",

        "Lily: I thought you said Lieutenant Hughes was here.",
        "Zac: Well, that's what the dispatcher told me.",
        "Lily: Maybe you want to give her a call.",
        "Zac: Oh, we can get started without her.",
        "Lily: Started with that?",
        "Zac: Well, she wants you to transfer the funds in to this numbered account.",
        "Lily: Why would she want me to do that?",
        "Zac: I guess you'll have to ask her that when she gets here.",
        "Lily: I can't do that without talking to her.",
        "Zac: Sure, you can.",
        "Lily: You're not an Officer. You're one of them.",
        "Zac: Transfer the funds, Mrs. Snyder.",
        "Lily: Where's my son?",
        "Zac: If you don't want him to die, you'll do exactly what I tell you to do.",
        "Lily: Who are you?",
        "Zac: I'm the person who's about to steal all of your money. Sit down and transfer the funds.",
        "Lily: First let me know that Luke is all right, and Noah.",
        "Zac: You're not in any position to make demands.",
        "Lily: I'll give you your money. Just prove to me that they're not hurt.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lily: That's probably my husband. I should let him know that I'm all right.",
        "Zac: Unh-unh. Transfer the funds first. Did you hear me?",
        "Lily: I'm not giving you a penny until I know that Luke and Noah are safe.",
        "Zac: You do not want to push me.",
        "Lily: You can't get the money without me. So go ahead. Shoot.",

        "Margo: So, you think that this is a revenge thing.",
        "Holden: Well, that's Damian's theory, but we need to have Lily take a look at the photo first.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Margo: So, why didn't Damian e-mail the photo to me when he sent it to Lily?",
        "Holden: He wanted to wait until Lily gave us conformation.",
        "Margo: No. He wanted to go off half-cocked and handle this on his own.",
        "Holden: He did say he knew somebody who might be able to find her.",
        "Margo: Yes, his people.",
        "Holden: I guess.",
        "Margo: Yes, God forbid he should let trained professionals of the law handle this. No, he wants his people to handle it.",
