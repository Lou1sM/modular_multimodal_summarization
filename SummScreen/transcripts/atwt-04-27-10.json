Liberty shares her concerns about Parker with Carly who is also very worried about Parker.

        "Craig tells Carly that Ellis made some bad investments and they have lost all the Monte Carlo money. Carly is mad at herself for trusting Craig once again but he is determined to make things right no matter what he has to do. Parker is shocked when he discovers that his trust fund account has no money and he suspects both Craig and Gabriel of stealing the money from him when he looks at all the recent transactions on the account. Parker has a heated confrontation with Gabriel at the Monte Carlo office in which he ends up punching Gabriel who is knocked on conscious when he hits his head on the desk after Parker punches him. Parker leaves and Craig detonates an explosion of the Monte Carlo office hoping that the insurance will pay him the money he needs to launch Carly's clothing line. Lily and Lucinda have regrets that they didn't tell Craig that Gabriel was his son. Gabriel lays on the ground of the Monte Carlo office as the office starts to catch on fire."

        "Holden: It's time for you to come home. You said you were gonna be done over an hour ago.",
        "Molly: Yeah. Let me just finish this one -- last sentence. There, done.",
        "Holden: Somebody sent you flowers?",
        "Molly: Yeah, um -- they're from Silas.",
        "Holden: That guy couldn't take a hint if it hit him over the head.",
        "Molly: You know what? It's a business gesture, not a personal gesture. He's just thanking me for agreeing to do the interview, that's all.",
        "Holden: Molly, this is not a business gesture. Trust me.",
        "Molly: Well, that's all it is to me. That's all that matters, right?",
        "Holden: It better. Because if he starts sending you chocolates and perfume, then he and I are gonna have serious problems.",
        "Molly: Mm, I love it when you get all alpha male on me.",
        "Holden: Is that an offer?",
        "Molly: That depends. What'd you have in mind?",
        "Holden: Something very physical, if you're up for it.",
        "Molly: With you, always.",
        "Holden: All right, let's go get saddled up.",
        "Molly: Um -- [Laughs] I beg your pardon?",
        "Holden: I was talking about horse riding along the lake.",
        "Molly: Oh. Well, that sounds fun.",
        "Holden: And then maybe we could find a nice little spot and get very, very, very physical.",
        "Molly: Yeah, see? That sounds even better.",

        "Lily: Hey!",
        "Faith: Mom? Hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Lily: I'm looking for your dad.",
        "Faith: I haven't seen him.",
        "Lily: I need his help bringing over a box I put together for you.",
        "Faith: For me?",
        "Lily: Yeah, some of your stuff from your room. I thought you might like to have some of your books and stuffed animals.",
        "Faith: Oh.",
        "Lily: I put so much in the box, and now I can't lift it. I -- I need your dad's muscles.",
        "Faith: Well, I'll tell him to come pick it up when he can. Thanks. That was nice.",
        "Lily: So, you settling in here okay? Must be nice having a break from me.",
        "Faith: I'll say. I mean --",
        "Lily: Faith, its okay. I want things to ease up between us. And if living here with your dad makes that happen, I --",
        "Faith: I just need you to ease up, Mom. I made some mistakes, and suddenly you can't trust me at all. I can't make plans, I can't hang out with my friends.",
        "Lily: Sweetie, I've never stopped you from hanging out with Liberty and Parker, and -- and this new friend of yours -- that boy Gabriel Caras. Is that his name?",
        "Faith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: What's he like?",
        "Faith: He's cool.",
        "Lily: Good. How old is he?",
        "Faith: Don't know.",
        "Lily: What about his parents? Has he talked much about them?",
        "Faith: Why do you even need to know that?",
        "Lily: Just curious.",
        "Faith: No, you're not. You're just trying to figure out if he meets your standards.",
        "Lily: No, you've got it all wrong.",
        "Faith: Mom, just admit it. You're never gonna trust me, ever.",
        "Lily: [Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gabriel: You're calling me a criminal when you broke into my room?",
        "Parker: I broke in here to find proof so that everybody will finally see you for what you really are.",
        "Gabriel: Which is what, exactly?",
        "Liberty: Parker, have you totally lost your mind?",
        "Parker: Listen to me, Liberty. There's no way a guy like him can be living the kind of life that he's living on the money that my mom and Craig are paying him as a handyman.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, maybe I'm a trust-fund baby just like you.",
        "Parker: No, no, that's not what you are. You're a thief. Unless you're some kind of secret cross-dresser. I'm guessing you didn't buy these.",
        "Gabriel: [Scoffs] You're twisted, Dude.",
        "Parker: Why don't you tell us where you got them?",
        "Gabriel: I don't owe you any explanation.",
        "Liberty: I'd like one.",
        "Gabriel: They're not stolen, Liberty. I swear.",
        "Parker: Yeah, of course he's gonna say that.",
        "Gabriel: Look, I want you out of my room now.",
        "Parker: I'm not leaving until you tell me where you got these pearls and where you got the money to pay for that fancy sports car of yours.",
        "Gabriel: I don't owe you any explanation.",
        "Parker: You see that, Liberty? He can't even come up with a quick excuse, but, meanwhile, the guy's living the life in fancy hotel rooms, chartering private planes. There's only one way a guy like Gabriel can afford to pay for any of that. It's because he's a criminal, a thief, and a drug dealer.",

        "Carly: What the heck is going on? Craig, why are you throttling your accountant in the middle of a movie theater?",
        "Ellis: Yeah, Craig, why?",
        "Craig: Shut up! Stay out of this, Carly. Ellis just made a bad investment call, and I'm just straightening things out. Isn't that right?",
        "Ellis: [Coughs] I can't breathe.",
        "Craig: That is gonna be the least of your problems unless I get back my money!",
        "Ellis: I can't get it.",
        "Craig: Wrong answer.",
        "Carly: Are you crazy?! Let him go!",
        "Craig: Carly, this isn't your problem.",
        "Carly: It's gonna be my problem if you get arrested! Now, let him go!",
        "Craig: Stop! Get off --",
        "Carly: Let go!",
        "Craig: Carl-- come back! Come back here, you embezzler!",
        "Carly: Stop it!",
        "Craig: Get out of my way!",
        "Carly: Wait, Craig!",
        "Craig: Where'd you go, you son of a --",
        "Carly: Craig! What on earth are you doing? He's an accountant, for Pete's sake. He's not a mass murderer.",
        "Craig: Oh, he's killed more than you know. And thank you so much for letting him get away.",
        "Carly: Oh, don't blame me. And don't tell me this is about a couple of bad investments. I -- I know that look in your eye. You're out for blood.",
        "Craig: Well, what can I say? When it comes to money, I kind of go crazy, especially when I lose it.",
        "Carly: So, how much money are we talking?",
        "Craig: Really, Carly, this is nothing for you to worry about.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig. Something tells me that I ought to worry about it. So, come on. Tell me, Partner. What kind of mess have you gotten us into this time?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Faith, you're taking this the wrong way. I am not accusing you of anything.",
        "Faith: But you're accusing my friend, which is just as bad.",
        "Lily: No, Baby, I'm just curious. I want to know about your life, who you hang out with, what you do.",
        "Faith: Because you can't trust me.",
        "Lily: That is not true.",
        "Faith: Mom, I can see right through you. The only reason why you're asking me all of these questions about Gabriel is because you're worried that he's a bad influence on me.",
        "Lily: No, I just want to know a little bit about the boy. Is that such a bad thing?",
        "Faith: It wouldn't be a bad thing if it were that simple. But it's not, Mom. With you, it never is.",
        "Molly: [Laughs]",
        "Holden: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Faith: I'm out of here.",
        "Lily: Where are you going?",
        "Faith: I'm going to Java to do my homework in case you want to follow and spy on me.",
        "Holden: What happened?",
        "Lily: Nothing. Just an everyday conversation between a mother and a daughter. Everything's great. Can't you see? Excuse me.",
        "Holden: [Sighs] I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Those drugs were Faith's, not Gabriel's.",
        "Parker: That's bull.",
        "Liberty: It's true.",
        "Parker: Then why did you say they were yours if they were hers?",
        "Gabriel: So she wouldn't get in trouble.",
        "Parker: Oh, yeah. Like anybody's gonna believe that.",
        "Liberty: I do.",
        "Gabriel: You know what, Parker? I could care less what you believe. It's none of your business how much money I have, where I got it, and how I spend it.",
        "Parker: You don't think you have to answer to anybody, do you?",
        "Liberty: Okay, stop it -- both of you. Parker, why are you doing this?",
        "Parker: So you can see the kind of guy you're hanging out with in his private chartered planes, in his fancy hotel room.",
        "Liberty: Okay, we were just gonna watch a movie, and that's not really even any of your business. Parker, this has got to stop. This whole jealousy thing is totally out of control here.",
        "Parker: You think I'm doing this because I'm jealous?!",
        "Liberty: I think you think you're protecting me.",
        "Parker: Obviously somebody has to. And you still haven't told us where you got these pearls.",
        "Gabriel: You just don't quit, do you?",
        "Parker: Well, if you just answer the question.",
        "Gabriel: They belong to my mom, okay? Okay, my dad gave them to her, and they meant a lot, so I take them with me wherever I go. She's dead, by the way. So, sorry if you can't check to find out if I'm telling the truth or not.",
        "Liberty: Now would be a good time for an apology, don't you think?",
        "Parker: I may have been wrong about the pearls -- I'm not wrong about you.",
        "Liberty: Parker, will you stop? I'm so sorry about all of this.",
        "Gabriel: Don't be.",
        "Parker: Can we go somewhere and talk about this?",
        "Liberty: No. I don't want to go anywhere with you right now.",
        "Parker: Can I at least take you home?",
        "Liberty: I said no. Just leave me alone, okay?",
        "Parker: Fine.",
        "Liberty: [Sighs]",
        "Gabriel: I'm sorry.",
        "Liberty: It's not your fault. But I should go.",
        "Gabriel: No, I mean, you don't have to. We could still watch the movie like you planned.",
        "Liberty: I'm kind of not in the mood anymore. Another time?",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, you bet.",

        "Carly: Will you quit running away from me?",
        "Craig: I'm not going to discuss my financial difficulties in the middle of town for all of Oakdale to hear.",
        "Carly: [Sighs] All right, Craig. Well, we are alone now, so spill it. I'm not letting you leave here until you do.",
        "Craig: [Sighs] Fine, fine! You're gonna hear about it, anyway. Ellis made a bad investment with some funds.",
        "Carly: By some, you mean how much?",
        "Craig: It's in the neighborhood of -- everything.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig. You lost it all?",
        "Craig: Not me. We.",
        "Carly: We? You invested Monte Carlo money?",
        "Craig: Ellis swore to me it was a sure thing.",
        "Carly: And you bought that?!",
        "Craig: Look, I can fix this, and I was about to when you let Ellis get away.",
        "Carly: Craig, you can't fix a financial catastrophe by strangling your accountant in the middle of a movie theater. How could you let this happen?!",
        "Craig: It was a dream investment.",
        "Carly: Aren't they all until they become nightmares.",
        "Craig: Look, all I have to do is find Ellis, and I can turn this whole thing around.",
        "Carly: No, Craig. Don't bother looking for a silver lining here. You were conned. And I'm gonna lose everything.",
        "Craig: Maybe not.",
        "Carly: How could I ever let myself get involved with you again?",
        "Craig: Carly, this isn't my fault.",
        "Carly: How did it happen?",
        "Craig: I was trying to lift the -- the resources of the company so that you'd have all the creative resources you'd ever need.",
        "Carly: No, don't -- don't do that. Don't make it about me. I had nothing to do with it. I didn't tell you to foolishly put all of our money into someone else's pockets. You should have done your homework.",
        "Craig: Ellis has been my accountant for years. How would I know that he'd turn around and rob me? And for all I know, he could be as much a victim of this as me.",
        "Carly: Oh, you don't honestly believe that.",
        "Craig: Look, if you hadn't let him go, I was about to get to the bottom of this.",
        "Carly: I feel bad for you. I do. I wish that you had doubled your money and not lost it.",
        "Craig: Not half as much as me.",
        "Carly: But you did. You lost it. And none of that is on me.",
        "Craig: I know. I know. I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: You're always sorry.",
        "Craig: Listen, Carly --",
        "Carly: No, Craig. Once again you have made me regret ever being pulled back into your world.",
        "Craig: Don't say that. We're terrific together. We're always being drawn back to each other for all kinds of ways.",
        "Carly: Oh, you see, this -- this is -- this right there. That's another thing I can't stand. You're always coming on to me. You're trying to seduce me even when I told you there is no possibility for a romantic future for us ever at all.",
        "Craig: And one day you're going to realize that's a mistake.",
        "Carly: The mistake was that I ever trusted you in the first place.",
        "Craig: I promise I'll make this right.",
        "Carly: You can't. Your promises are meaningless. And even when I do buy into them, I'm left all dressed up with no place to go. And I'm tired of ending up with nothing.",
        "Craig: Just give me another chance.",
        "Carly: To mess up? No, thanks.",

        "Faith: Hey.",
        "Parker: Hi.",
        "Faith: Sounds like someone needs a cup of coffee.",
        "Parker: I need to ask you a question.",
        "Faith: Okay, sit. Ask.",
        "Parker: Remember when Gabriel said that the drugs that I found in my room were his? Was he covering for you?",
        "Faith: What? No.",
        "Parker: Look, I need for you to tell me the truth, okay? Because I just got in his face about it.",
        "Faith: Okay, yeah. It's true.",
        "Parker: Great. So he was telling the truth.",
        "Faith: I'm sorry, Parker. I should have told you before.",
        "Parker: Does this mean that you're buying drugs now?",
        "Faith: No. It was a one-time thing up at boarding school.",
        "Parker: Swear to me you're not still doing them.",
        "Faith: I swear. I messed up. It's over.",
        "Parker: I messed up, too. I just made a complete fool of myself in front of Liberty.",
        "Faith: Maybe I can help fix it? I guess I kind of owe you one.",
        "Parker: No, I think I should just probably apologize.",
        "Faith: So, why don't you just tell her you're sorry?",
        "Parker: 'Cause I don't think that's gonna be enough this time. I need to do something for her, something really nice.",
        "Faith: Flowers?",
        "Parker: Too corny.",
        "Faith: Well, if it was me, I'd love to be invited to a movie or dinner.",

        "Faith: She'd be crazy not to go for that.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I can make it into like a package deal.",

        "Parker: Get a hotel room in a really fancy hotel, first-class plane tickets.",
        "Faith: Yeah, that -- that's good.",
        "Parker: It's really good. Thank you for the idea.",
        "Faith: It must be nice to have so much money. That way, you can do whatever you want with it.",
        "Parker: Well, it's a special occasion, really. I'm not Gabriel, just throwing my money around so everybody looks at me and says, \"Hey, look how rich he is.\"",

        "Holden: Faith's only lashing out at you because she's scared that she let you down.",
        "Lily: I don't know how to get her to stop being so defensive so that we can just talk.",
        "Holden: I don't think you can do that right now. I think you just need to let this thing run its course, maybe let her work through it on her own.",
        "Lily: I thought I was. I can't even get that right.",
        "Holden: What prompted this flare-up?",
        "Lily: Nothing. I was just asking her about this boy that she's been spending time with.",

        "Lily: You know him?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, I met him once. Molly got him a job over at Monte Carlo.",
        "Lily: He's working with Craig and Carly?",
        "Holden: Yeah. Why? Is there anything to be worried about?",
        "Lily: No, I -- I -- I don't know anything about that kid. I -- you're right. I shouldn't have even brought it up. I was just trying too hard to be included in her life.",
        "Holden: Deep down, I think she knows why we're acting this way. She knows that we love her and that we care about her.",
        "Lily: [Scoffs] Not that she'd ever let us know that.",
        "Holden: Maybe one day she will. But in the meantime, I think we need to hold on tight because it's gonna be really, really, really tough. These are those dreaded teenage years.",
        "Lily: Oh, thanks. I feel so much better.",
        "Holden: Well, glad I could help you out.",
        "Lily: No, seriously. Thanks for trying to cheer me up, Holden.",
        "Holden: Anytime. So, why are you out here -- what for?",
        "Lily: I put together a box of some of Faith's things, and I need your help bringing it over 'cause it just got way too heavy.",
        "Holden: I'm sure she'll appreciate that.",
        "Lily: Or not.",
        "Holden: She will. Trust me. If you want, I can come by and pick it up.",
        "Lily: That'd be great.",
        "Holden: Well, yeah, the way I see it, I think I owe you.",
        "Lily: Owe me? For what?",

        "Carly: What launch? You said you blew all of our capital.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no. I said that there's a wrench in the machine that I'm going to remove as soon as possible.",
        "Carly: Well, don't bother. 'Cause even if you somehow manage to fix this, you're just gonna cause another catastrophe somewhere down the line, and another one after that. It's what you do, Craig. You dream big, you go for broke, and that's exactly where we've ended up.",
        "Craig: How could you have so little faith in me?",
        "Carly: Experience. Your track record speaks for itself.",
        "Craig: Oh, okay, okay. Let's just forget about me. Let's talk about you. I can't believe that you're willing to just walk away from your dream.",
