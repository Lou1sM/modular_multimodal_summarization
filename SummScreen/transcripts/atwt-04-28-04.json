        "Margo: You're wasting your time, and mine. There's no way Jessica's going to show up.",
        "Doc: Oh, she'll be here.",
        "Margo: In your dreams, Doc.",
        "Doc: What can I say, I must be living a charmed life. Because all my dreams come true.",
        "Margo: Oh, you really think so?",
        "Doc: Oh, I know so.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jessica: Someone needs a lawyer?",
        "Doc: That would be me. You're looking at him.",
        "Jessica: So, now that you're in trouble, you call on the cold, self-centered career woman to bail you out? I overheard what you told your date tonight about me, Mr. Reese.",
        "Doc: Listen, listen. Some of those words you're putting in my mouth. All right? But for the ones I put there myself? I apologize. I was just talking --",
        "Jessica: No, you don't need to be talking about me. You don't know anything about me. You don't know anything about my life --",
        "Doc: I do know that you are the best lawyer in this town -- I know that. And I want the best.",
        "Jessica: And you always get what you want.",
        "Doc: You say that like it's a bad thing? Listen. I had a little run-in with the law tonight, but I know someone as smart and sassy as you can make this thing go away in -- [Snaps his fingers] No time flat. So what do you say there, counselor?",
        "Jessica: I say you've wasted your flattery and your one phone call. Find yourself a lawyer who gives a damn.",

        "Bob: Dr. Hughes, I presume.",
        "Chris: Hey, Dad.",
        "Bob: If we didn't work at the same hospital, I doubt we would ever bump into each other.",
        "Chris: It's all those extra shifts I've been pulling at the clinic.",
        "Bob: When do you sleep?",
        "Chris: Oh, it's not that bad. You know, its great experience, I feel like I'm making a difference -- besides, the extra money doesn't hurt.",
        "Bob: Money isn't everything. You've gotta save some time for yourself, and time for Alison. Gotta keep those home fires burning.",
        "Chris: Yes. Well, the home fires are burning plenty bright, thank you.",
        "Bob: Look, son, I don't want to interfere. But I've known a lot of doctors, old and young, who get so involved with their work that they lose touch with what's going on at home.",
        "Chris: Well, that's not something you don't have to worry about with Alison and I. We are totally in sync. We've never been closer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Can you believe it? They ordered another round of drinks, and more food. This is my biggest bill tonight, and I know they're gonna be really great tippers!",
        "Aaron: Good luck!",
        "Alison: I don't need it -- I've got the magic touch!",
        "Aaron: Wooh! Emily! Emily! What brings you here tonight?",
        "Emily: Hi! Wow, Aaron. Big crowd.",
        "Aaron: It's been like this for a couple of hours now. Yeah. Ah, you here for somebody? You need help?",
        "Emily: Ah, you could say that.",
        "Aaron: Anybody I know?",
        "Emily: Maybe.",
        "Aaron: Well, why don't you tell me who you're looking for and -- and maybe I can help you out?",
        "Alison: Can I have another pitcher of beer, and two tequila shots!",
        "Emily: Thanks, but I just found the person I'm looking for. Oh my God, it's true. My sister's a cocktail waitress!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I got your message. I'm here. What's the problem this time?",
        "Paul: The problem is that there's something in the air and I can't figure it out, and I was hoping that you could ease my mind.",
        "Carly: Do you think that maybe this could wait until morning?",
        "Paul: Not too long ago, Rosanna threatened to disown you if you had anything to do with B.R.O. And now she's not only encouraging you to be part of the company, but Cabot Motors is sponsoring our next fashion show in Las Vegas. True or false?",
        "Carly: True.",
        "Paul: And my mother's new best friend, her right-hand man, is getting very cozy with my former best friend, Rosanna -- all in secret, of course --",
        "Carly: I don't think it's in secret --",
        "Paul: True or false?",
        "Carly: Well, that's true, I suppose --",
        "Paul: And now, out of the blue, Jennifer gets called for some mysterious meeting at Cabot headquarters, all because of Rosanna's generosity?",
        "Carly: What exactly do you want from me?",
        "Paul: I want to know what you and your sister are planning, Carly. And I want to know when it's all going to blow up in my face?",

        "Walker: We'll be there shortly. Thanks. Barbara? Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Yes?",
        "Walker: How's your head?",
        "Barbara: Unbearable.",
        "Walker: Can you sit up?",
        "Barbara: Why? Is there more news I shouldn't hear lying down?",
        "Walker: Well, thank god for Ben. He pulled a few favors, and he got you everything you requested. Your radiation treatments are going to be off-hours whenever possible, late at night, early in the morning. The hospital will be deserted, you'll go in under an assumed name -- no one will have to know.",
        "Barbara: So, when do I start?",
        "Walker: Tonight.",

        "Molly: Well, this is it.",
        "Holden: All the way from Oakdale you promised me that I would understand once we got to Chicago. Well, we're here. And whatever this is, I'm still in the dark, molly.",
        "Molly: Holden, have a drink?",
        "Holden: No, I don't want a drink! I want answers. And I want them now.",
        "Molly: Just watch. And listen.",
        "Chick: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the windy city cafe. Tonight, it's a privilege and a pleasure to introduce one of my favorites singing one of her favorites. I know you'll love her. Miss Violet Palmer.",

        "Holden: Lily, what is --",
        "Molly: Holden, wait. Don't do anything yet. Okay? Just listen to her. Okay?",
        "Lily: Thank you so much. You know, music is -- it's like magic. It can heal a broken heart, it can crystallize a moment or a person, or free your soul. And, for me, music is a way to bring somebody that I love very close to me. So, I'd like to dedicate this song to two people -- my sister, who taught me how to fly, and my husband, who is my safe harbor here on earth. Good night don't be afraid sleep safe in my arms I swear you'll be okay I'll keep you from harm 'cause I love you and I always will",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I know what this must look like.",
        "Emily: Yeah, it looks like you're working.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I know, but -- just the craziest thing happened. I dropped in to see Aaron, and they were short a waitress, and he was stuck, and I was just like, \"you know, I'm free. I might as well just roll up my sleeves and lend a helping hand.\"",
        "Emily: That's incredible.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Um, Aaron, can you please bring this to table six?",
        "Aaron: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Thanks. And I can probably just take off now. It looks like they've caught up.",
        "Emily: Oh, good. So, is this what happened the other night?",
        "Alison: What other night?",
        "Emily: Well, a friend of mine, actually, a one of the Mom's in Daniel's play group told me that she heard you were working here, and I told her I didn't hear about it. And, well, I thought I'd check it out to see for myself.",
        "Alison: Well, I was just helping out Aaron. I don't work here.",
        "Emily: Alison, will you stop with the lying? Clearly, you are working here.",
        "Alison: Okay. So what? So what?",
        "Emily: So what nothing. Why are you lying? What's the big cover up?",
        "Alison: Because Chris would kill me. So you have to forget everything that you saw and heard tonight, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Wait just a hot minute. You're pulling my leg, right?",
        "Jessica: Oh, no, no. I take the law very seriously. And I never joke about turning down a client.",
        "Doc: But I'm the new kid in town. You are the only attorney that I know.",
        "Jessica: Well, then, I suggest you let your fingers do the walking. And, please, if your credit card is rejected again, don't call my stepson. I'm sure Margo can put you in touch with the public defenders' office.",
        "Margo: Don't move. Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go. You're not going to walk away from this, are you?",
        "Jessica: Give me one reason why I shouldn't.",
        "Margo: Because it's an easy case. You can do this in your sleep.",
        "Jessica: You think I should represent that arrogant, self-centered, chauvinistic loudmouth? Why? And please don't tell me because you think he's cute.",
        "Margo: No, I was thinking more along the lines of Casey and Curtis, how they would never forgive us if their favorite sportscaster loses his job. You know, don't you want to be their hero? And besides, you've just been reinstated. I mean, don't you want to come back to the bar with a client who has personality? And yeah, he is kinda cute.",
        "Doc: All these law offices must be closed at this hour. I'm not gonna be able to get an attorney till the A.M.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, that may not be necessary.",
        "Jessica: I'm probably stark raving mad to do this, but I will help you, Mr. Reese. And please, please, don't make me regret it.",
        "Doc: All right, give it to me straight. What are we looking at here, counselor? $50 fine?",
        "Jessica: Do you realize the Lakeview Towers can charge you with trespassing, vandalism, malicious mischief --",
        "Doc: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. All this over breaking a $20 padlock and taking a dip in the hotel pool?",
        "Jessica: Oh, yes, there is the issue of indecent exposure. You could be charged with public nudity. This could be the most expensive skinny-dipping episode in history.",
        "Doc: You're kidding, right? What the hell kind of town is this? You people do know how to have fun here, don't you?",
        "Jessica: Oh, sure. We know how to have fun. But we don't have to break the law to do it.",
        "Doc: Oh, yeah, right. Listen, I know all about these small towns, all right? You're not fooling anyone. It was a joke. I mean, some harmless fun. I even tried to buy a new padlock. [Jessica scoffs] I did. I'm serious. I tried to make restitution to the night manager, but he was such an officious little -- let's just say he wasn't much of a football fan.",
        "Jessica: Well, then maybe we can go over the night manager's head. I happen to know the owner, and I can put in a call and see what we can work out.",
        "Doc: That's what I'm talking about, see? I like a woman who goes straight to the top.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm. Well, don't get your hopes up. The owner may not be much of a football fan, either.",
        "Lisa: I don't believe my eyes. Oh, it's \"Doctor Death\" Reese. Oh, my goodness. I've got to have -- I've got to have an autograph from you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Alison, listen to me. I think this is very responsible of you. I mean, I like the idea that you want to help Chris pay for the condo.",
        "Alison: Okay, so then, what's the problem?",
        "Emily: You're out of your mind if you think you're gonna keep this from him.",
        "Alison: Well, it's worked so far.",
        "Emily: Alison, I found out. I'm here. Half the town comes to this place. People who know me, people who know Chris. You want to keep a job a secret? Get a job in a cubicle or something doing data entry. That you can keep a secret.",
        "Alison: Well, that is why Aaron and Curtis are going out of their way to help me stay out of sight from little blabbermouths like you. Emily, the money that I'm making here is sick. I'm making like a couple hundred dollars on the weekends, and doing data entry? It would take me hours and hours to make that much money.",
        "Emily: So what about Kim and Bob? What do they think? And Nancy?",
        "Alison: Well, actually, Nancy is on my side. And she's helping me keep things under wraps.",
        "Emily: Are you kidding me? Are we talking about the same Nancy Hughes? Chris's -- Chris's grandmother?",
        "Alison: And I've got everything under control, Emily.",
        "Emily: Honey, you are lying and sneaking around your boyfriend's back again.",
        "Alison: Yes, but he'll understand one day, when I come in with a bunch of money and -- well, what else am I supposed to do when he won't touch the money from my college fund? What, are we supposed to just live at Kim and Bob's for the rest of our lives? And the money that I'm making here is unbeatable.",
        "Emily: You're playing with fire.",
        "Alison: Please, promise me that you won't say anything. Please, Emily. Please.",
        "Emily: This is such --",
        "Alison: You are the best sister.",
        "Emily: -- A bad idea. And I want you to know -- okay, all right.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Emily: I will never forget this.",
        "Alison: Okay, here's your check, and I'll take it whenever you're ready.",
        "Big spender: Thanks.",
        "Clumsy customer: Ah! I'm sorry.",
        "Alison: Don't worry about it. I've got it. I'm ready to take the check. Oh, my gosh. Oh, no. This can't be happening. Excuse me, did you see the person that just left? Did you see where they went? Oh, no. Oh, God, somebody help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You don't need my help. You need a shrink to help you get over your acute paranoia.",
        "Paul: I have every reason to be paranoid. Every time I turn a corner, somebody else is messing with my head. But I never thought it would be you, Carly. I never thought that you would join forces with Rosanna.",
        "Carly: She's my sister. We love each other. We want the best for each other. We would do almost anything for each other, but that doesn't mean that we're plotting against you, Paul.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Carly: There's no conspiracy.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Carly: Well, how many times do I have to explain this to you? Look, this is what happened. You and I were working together, and Rosanna freaked out. She just couldn't stomach the idea of me going into business with one of the two people she despises most on this planet. She made me choose, I chose her. But by the time Barbara offered my the job at B.R.O., Rosanna had calmed down. She realized all the work that I'd put into my designs. She knew what this opportunity would mean to me, so she thought it would be okay if I partnered up with Barbara. None of this has anything to do with you.",
        "Paul: Okay. Now convince me that my mother doesn't have an agenda. Because I know that her and Jordan Sinclair are up to something. I can smell it. I've been through this before, so I know all of the signs -- all the lies, all the sneaking around, all the conversations that stop the second that I walk into a room.",
        "Carly: I think this is your imagination, Paul.",
        "Paul: It's -- no. Barbara's giving him more and more authority at B.R.O. Every single day. This is not my imagination. I've seen the documents, Carly. They're making deals behind my back.",
        "Carly: Maybe she's just --",
        "Paul: I fire the guy, she rehires him. I mean, he's got some kind of weird power over her. They're joined at the hip. You cannot tell me that this is all in my head.",
        "Carly: Okay. Fine. Let's say that Jordan is part of some enormous conspiracy. Who exactly is he working for? Barbara? Rosanna? Is he playing both ends against the middle?",
        "Paul: I don't know. You tell me, Carly. What's your role in all of this?",
        "Carly: Me? I'm the one who gets to tell you that you're cracking up. You're angry. And you're hurt. And you're not seeing the big picture. And I'm sorry to break your heart, but the world does not revolve around you.",
        "Paul: Okay. So you're not keeping secrets from me. There's nothing weird about Rosanna's sudden change of heart. And my mom -- my mother's not, you know, signing documents and then hiding them from me, even though I am the C.O.O. Of her company. And none of this -- none of this has anything to do with revenge.",
        "Carly: Didn't you learn your lesson when you tried to get back at Craig for setting you up for rose's murder? Was it worth it, Paul? It cost you your friendship with Rosanna. And this time, it could wind up costing you so much more.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: We should probably go as soon as you get changed.",
        "Barbara: I can't. I can't do this.",
        "Walker: Listen, it's okay to be afraid. It's normal. In fact, I'd be a little worried if you weren't. But you are the toughest, most courageous woman --",
        "Barbara: You know, I'm not felling very brave right now. Even the word frightens me -- radiation.",
        "Walker: After everything you've been through, you're afraid of a little radiation? You're not alone, Barbara. I'm here. I made you a promise I'd be here till the end, and I don't break my promises. Lean on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "I know times have been hard life's treated you bad but, baby, let down your guard try not to be sad 'cause I promised to stay by your side and now that's what I'm gonna do",
        "Molly: You love that woman more than life. And I know she loves you the same way, so don't ever forget that, okay? I'll be here with you",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Lisa, you never struck me as a football fan.",
        "Doc: Well, that'll teach you to judge a book by its cover. Won't it?",
        "Lisa: Yes. My grand boys would come over and watch football. Margo's sons.",
        "Doc: Oh, please. You're not old enough to have grandsons.",
        "Lisa: Oh, listen to that. Flattery can get you anywhere. Yes, they would come over and I would order in a big mess of chili and chicken wings, and oh, we just had a wonderful time. They got me hooked on football.",
        "Doc: Wait, wait, wait --",
        "Lisa: Yeah.",
        "Doc: Let's go back a little bit. Did you say chili?",
        "Lisa: I did. Oh, honey, I -- I had the best chili in the whole wide world. You must come over with Casey and me some time.",
        "Doc: I would be honored.",
        "Lisa: Great.",
        "[Jessica clears throat]",
        "Jessica: Lisa --",
        "Lisa: Yes.",
        "Jessica: The incident at the Lakeview Towers --",
        "Lisa: Oh, yeah, of course. Now, okay, look, Doc -- I am a big fan, but I'm also a businesswoman, and pretty good if I say so myself. And I can be a good magician.",
        "Doc: Well, you don't say.",
        "Lisa: I do. Yeah, I make this whole little incident just disappear. But, I need a little cooperation from you.",
        "Doc: I'm all ears.",
        "Lisa: All right. You can swim at the hotel pool during hotel hours, the pool hours, and for heaven's sake, proper attire.",
        "Doc: Oh, come on.",
        "Lisa: Oh, and wait -- that's not all. Wait a minute. You will have to be the hotel golf pro. You can do that, huh?",
        "Doc: Hmm -- what would that entail?",
        "Lisa: Well, you would just have to do an occasional 18 holes and meet with an occasional VIP in case they want to rub elbows with a football hero?",
        "Doc: Ooh. You drive a hard bargain, don't you?",
        "Lisa: Yes, I do.",
        "Doc: But, I say we have a deal.",
        "Lisa: Excellent, excellent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Um, anyway, I heard all about you taking on a second job to make up for the money you lost in the condo. And, well, I also heard about you turning down Alison's offer to get a second job.",
        "Chris: I don't want her to worry about the money, okay? I can handle it.",
        "Emily: Well, I admire your chivalry in wanting to protect my little sister and all, and I know she loves you for it --",
        "Chris: But?",
        "Emily: But I'm probably sticking my nose where it doesn't belong, and Alison would kill me if she knew I was here. But, it's driving her crazy, seeing you shouldering 100% of the financial burden, when she feels totally responsible for getting into the condo in the first place.",
        "Chris: I've already told her 1,000 times --",
        "Emily: It's not sinking in -- trust me. And given past experience with Alison -- it won't. So let her help. Let her feel like she's in a partnership. I mean, it is the 21st century, Chris, and the idea of the little woman staying at home alone --",
        "Chris: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Is that what this looks like?",
        "Emily: I think it's probably how she feels. You know, like you've clipped her little wings and there's nothing she can do. Plus, I don't need to tell you -- she's very bad at sitting around, all by herself, with nothing but time on her hands. That's the last thing anybody needs.",
        "Chris: I definitely wasn't looking for trouble here. I was trying to keep her away from it.",
        "Emily: Trouble? What kind of trouble?",
        "Chris: Aaron Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Aaron! Help! Please tell me you took all of the money from table ten!",
        "Aaron: No. Why? Ten's your table. I'm busy here. I got -- my hands are full.",
        "Alison: Oh miGod, God, God -- oh, I am so dead!",
        "Aaron: Ali, don't tell me they skipped without paying?",
        "Alison: No, no -- I saw them. I saw him put the money down! I saw him -- peel one bill, and then another -- then somebody spilled something and I turned my back for half a second, and when I turned back -- he was gone, the money was gone, the people were gone -- my job is over --",
        "Aaron: Okay, okay. Don't freak out just yet, okay?",
        "Alison: Well, what else am I supposed to do?",
        "Aaron: We'll ask the busboy, okay? Maybe he picked it up. Or maybe they didn't even leave the check and the money there. Maybe they paid for it at the bar. Okay?",
        "Alison: Do you think so?",
        "Aaron: I'm gonna find out. Let's find out right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden -- what are you doing here? How did you find me?",
        "Holden: Molly brought me here.",
        "Lily: Molly?",
        "Holden: She didn't do it to be cruel. She didn't do it to stab you in the back. She only did it because I didn't give her any other choice.",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Holden: Look, you've asked me enough questions. Let me ask a question or two. What are you doing here?",
        "Lily: You wouldn't understand.",
        "Holden: Try me.",
        "Lily: This is -- it's not like before. It's not talking to psychics. And I'm not going off the deep end. You have absolutely nothing to worry about -- trust me.",
        "Holden: I know that. I knew it the second I saw you step up on that stage.",
        "Lily: I love you. I love the kids. And I know Rose is gone. Believe me, I know I'll never see her again. But being up on that stage and singing, it was -- it was a way for me to feel close to her. Singing something -- just the two of us.",
        "Holden: But how did you get here?",
        "Lily: I came to Chicago to pick up the check for the Rose Foundation, and I was finished with business, so I came down and I heard music and I walked in here and the crowd -- people. It made me think about singing at the foundation -- the fund-raiser. And I felt all complete and happy that night. And I just wanted to feel that way again.",
        "Holden: So you just -- you just walked up on stage?",
        "Lily: No, it was open mic night, and the owner gave me a chance. And I chickened out and I left, but I came back and got up on stage and started singing again. I felt -- felt --",
        "Holden: Like you found Rose?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Holden: So you don't feel sad or lost anymore?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Holden: You found the perfect way to share your sister with the world.",
        "Lily: You understand?",
        "Holden: Rose is part of you. She always will be. I've never had any trouble understanding that.",
        "Chick: Hey, is everything okay, Violet?",
        "Lily: Everything's fine.",
        "Chick: Oh, you had me scared the way you took off there.",
        "Lily: Oh, sorry for that strange interlude. Could you give us a minute, please?",
        "Chick: Sure.",
        "Lily: Thanks. Thank you.",
        "Holden: Violet?",
        "Lily: I figured if I used my real name people in Oakdale might find out.",
        "Holden: People like me? You were afraid that I'd find out?",
        "Lily: I know it sounds silly --",
        "Holden: No, no. I'm the one who's sorry.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Holden: Because you felt like you couldn't tell me the truth. I forced you to choose between me and Rose, and I never should have done that. But I was just afraid of losing you.",
        "Lily: You'll never lose me. Come on, I give you so many reasons to worry and not trust me --",
        "Holden: I should've trusted you --",
        "Lily: No, no, no, no. I'll never -- I'll never, ever shut you out again. Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here.",
        "Holden: I don't think we should do that.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Holden: Because there's something I want you to do first.",
        "Lily: What?",

        "Aaron: Look, there's nothing you can do. Were you crazy leaving that kind of money on the table?",
        "Alison: I didn't leave it! I turned my back for half a second, and that's all.",
        "Aaron: How much money are we talking about?",
        "Alison: You don't want to know.",
        "Aaron: That much?",

        "Aaron: There's only one thing you can do. You have to tell the boss. And right now, that's Molly.",
        "Alison: Can't I just leave town and change my name and just forget that this ever happened?",
        "Aaron: Okay, that's what the old Ali will do. But you? Come on. Just go, get it over with.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: But when did Aaron qualify for \"America's most wanted\"? When the two of them were married? When you thought that he was the father of her baby? Because if you're still holding a grudge about what happened in Chicago and the miscarriage, you can't --",
        "Chris: Emily, I'm not holding any grudges, okay? It's just -- the idea of working in a nightclub didn't sound very safe, okay? And with Aaron there -- you know whenever the two of them get together --",
        "Emily: What? They're just friends. You can't possibly be worried.",
        "Chris: No. And I get that, okay? But the last time the two of them were together, they -- you know, they cooked up that scheme about trapping Clark Watson. Okay, Alison ended up in the hospital. She could have been killed.",
        "Emily: Okay, all right. He was just trying to do a good thing. Because he's a good guy. He really is. He's very protective of Alison. He'd never let anything happen to her. And think about it. If she's going to work there, I feel better knowing that he's there and Curtis is there to look after her, right?",
        "Chris: Maybe.",
        "Emily: It's a safe place when you think about it, really. It's Metro. Family, friends -- our neighbors go there. And every single person in there will be watching her like a hawk, whether she likes it or not. Think about it.",

        "Paul: Right. Because my mother's an innocent bystander in all this, her hands are completely clean. Come on, this is my mother we're talking about. Can you really make me a guarantee that she's not out to get me?",
        "Carly: Look, I'd be the last person to assume that Barbara's got no ulterior motive. But if she's got one this time, then we are the last people in the world to know about it.",
        "Paul: What about Rosanna?",
        "Carly: What? She felt bad about what she put me through. About making me walk away from our partnership. And she was -- she was touched and grateful that I was willing to do it. So she wanted to do something for me in return, so she made the offer for the corporate sponsorship for B.R.O.. that was for me, for my career. That's it.",
        "Paul: That's it? Why is she spending so much time with Jordan Sinclair?",
        "Carly: He lives in the suite across the hall from her. I guess they met, I guess they hit it off --",
        "Paul: She's using him to get to me.",
        "Carly: No, Paul. I promise you, Rosanna's friendship has nothing to do with you.",
        "Paul: Then why am I suddenly completely off the radar screen? I go from being \"one of the two people that she despises most on the planet\" -- your words -- to being some kind of invisible man?",

        "Paul: You want to know what you can do, Carly? This is what you can do. You can take your designs and walk away from Barbara and never look back.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry, Paul, but I can't just walk away. I've made commitments to Barbara, to B.R.O., and I intend to honor them. I'm sorry if that doesn't work for you, but that's just the way it is.",
        "Paul: Something is going on here, Carly, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it. Am I'm telling you right now that whoever doesn't come out of this on my side is going down with Barbara.",

        "Walker: You trust me, right? Would I ask you to do anything that would hurt you? Would I ask you to do anything you can't handle? Bravery is not the absence of fear, Mrs. Grandview. It's being afraid and moving forward anyway. Just put one foot in front of the other. And I know you can do that.",

        "Bob: Oh, well, that's terrific.",
        "Chris: Yeah, it is terrific. We can go to work together, we can come home together. We can just be together all the time. It's the perfect solution. She -- she is going to flip. I can't wait to see the look on her face when I tell her the good news.",
