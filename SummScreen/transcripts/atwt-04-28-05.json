        "Lucinda: Oh! Lily, Morrissey came along at a time in your life when you were very vulnerable, okay. He's engineered a situation, you feel beholden to him, and he is playing it. He is playing to the hilt.",
        "Lily: How is doing that?",
        "Lucinda: Aren't you the woman -- aren't the woman that helped him get into the halfway house, to Les' room?",
        "Lily: How he got in there is not important. He found evidence.",
        "Lucinda: Why are you being so stubborn? He planted. He planted the cell phone when you were talking to the supervisor.",
        "Lily: You're telling me that Keith found Julia's phone, covered in blood , wrapped it up in cellophane and then planted it in the dumbwaiter? That's gruesome.",
        "Lucinda: Well, here's something else, then, darling. If -- if Les is really guilty and he wiped his fingerprints, why didn't he wipe away the blood? And why was he such damn fool as to take the cell phone with him?",
        "Lily: So what you're really saying here is that you don't think that Les killed Julia? You think Keith did?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: You've already done an autopsy on my sister. Cause of death? Her head was bashed her head in by psychotic ex-husband.",
        "Tom: The coroner did find evidence of blunt force trauma. However, when Dr. Harris took a second look at this report, he noticed --",
        "Keith: Wait a minute, Dr. Harris? Dr. Harris is married to Sweeny's lawyer.",
        "Tom: Dr. Harris and Ms. Griffin are divorced. Their former relationship has no bearing --",
        "Keith: The hell it doesn't! Ms. Griffin is using her ex-husband to get her client off, and you're just standing there, letting it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I'm sorry, Mike. I'd like to enjoy this, but I don't appreciate being set up.",
        "Mike: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm here to meet a real estate developer.",
        "Jennifer: Real estate? Lisa called me because she was having some fashion crisis. She needed me to cover for a coordinator.",
        "Mike: She called me, too.",
        "Jennifer: You're saying that Lisa is playing cupid?",
        "Mike: No. It was Katie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You set them up?",
        "Katie: Yes, so they could realize what a mistake they're making and get back together. Henry, I had to prove to you that it's not --",
        "Henry: No, no, no. This is not about me. You just feel guilty because you told Craig he was the father.",
        "Katie: Of course I feel guilty. If I would've just kept my big mouth shut, Mike and Jen would be out of the country and happily married. Just like you and I were before you decided that you couldn't trust me.",
        "Henry: Au contraire, darling. I trust you to do exactly what you did, and that is to fly to mike's aid.",
        "Katie: So he could marry Jennifer.",
        "Henry: So you could feel safe.",
        "Katie: No, honey, so you could feel safe. I love you. And if you weren't so stuck on my past, you would see that we could have a wonderful future -- just like Mike and Jen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Katie feels terrible about what happened.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it wasn't Katie's fault that Craig followed us to Vegas.",
        "Mike: Still, she feels responsible.",
        "Jennifer: Because he's her brother? She can't control him any more than I can control Paul or Will.",
        "Mike: Okay, the point is she's on our side. All right, she wants us to be happy, and she doesn't want Craig to win.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it's too late. He's already won.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Yeah, this is Craig Montgomery. Is there any word on my shipment? The boat was due in -- the boat was due in an hour ago. \"The Asian Star,\" from Singapore.",
        "Harbor master: It's due any minute.",
        "Craig: Oh, well, will you tell Mr. Hwa that I'll meet him at Metro?",
        "Harbor master: I'll give him your message as soon as he arrives.",
        "Craig: All right. I'll have another.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So that's the plan. Reactions?",
        "Paul: If we pull this off, Craig'll be finished.",
        "Dusty: I think if we do anything smaller-scale it puts Jen at risk. We've got to do this thing now.",
        "Sierra: I just wish that there was another way.",
        "Barbara: Sierra, you have to stop thinking about Craig and think about Jennifer. I warned you about Craig at Street Jeans.",
        "Sierra: I'm not disagreeing with you, Barbara. We all know that Craig has had more second chances than he deserves.",
        "Paul: Then why are we even debating this?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause this is a serious decision. Once it's made there's no turning back. The man's life is over.",
        "Paul: Great. Is there anyone in this room -- is there anyone in this town who hasn't suffered because of Craig Montgomery?",
        "Dusty: So we agree?",
        "Barbara: You even have to ask?",
        "Dusty: Sierra?",
        "Sierra: He's left us no choice.",
        "Dusty: Paul?",
        "Paul: Oh, I've been waiting for this for a long time.",
        "Barbara: And I've been saving this for a long time. Darling.",
        "Paul: Nice.",
        "Barbara: Sierra. Dusty. Paul. I think this occasion deserves a little toast, don't you? To better days.",
        "Dusty: And good-bye, Montgomery.",
        "Dusty: Montgomery is expecting a shipment from Singapore.",
        "Barbara: Knock-offs of Jennifer's designs. It's beyond the pale.",
        "Dusty: It's business. Luckily he's got more orders than he can fill.",
        "Paul: Which is why he called Hwa.",
        "Sierra: Hwa?",
        "Barbara: A loathsome little toad who owns sweat shops in Malaysia.",
        "Paul: But he can turn around an order overnight.",
        "Sierra: I'm assuming he can be bought then?",
        "Dusty: For enough coin, this guy will flip on his grandmother.",
        "Paul: You'll call him?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. It's gonna take some time. Can you handle Craig? Can you keep him busy?",
        "Barbara: Oh, it would be my pleasure.",
        "Sierra: Well, are you sure that Craig hasn't met Hwa. I mean, he goes to Singapore a lot.",
        "Paul: I'm pretty sure they move in different circles.",
        "Dusty: Craig's never met him directly, only through middle-men. Can you handle Margo?",
        "Sierra: Yes.",
        "Dusty: Then we're all set.",
        "Paul: Great, call me.",
        "Dusty: Then it's a go. Let's do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: The thing is, Katie, none of this changes how you feel about Mike.",
        "Katie: Henry, would I be bending over backwards trying to get him back together with Jennifer if I still had feelings for him?",
        "Henry: Do you really expect me to answer that?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Henry: No. No, I do not pretend to understand how women think.",
        "Katie: Well, you understand exactly how I think. That's why we're together.",
        "Henry: No, what I know is that you will never forget Mike.",
        "Katie: And you'll forget Vonda?",
        "Henry: Now how did you know about Vonda?",
        "Katie: You talk in your sleep. But it's fine. We're not 16 years old. I know you've had relationships, too.",
        "Henry: Six weeks with a female contortionist, now that's a bit of heaven, but it's nowhere near what you had with Mike.",
        "Katie: Mike is in my past, just as -- I hope -- Vonda's in yours.",
        "Henry: She married a sword swallower. They're raising Rottweilers in Berlin.",
        "Katie: Good. I hope they'll be very happy. Just as I hope Mike and Jen will be very happy. Just how limber was she?",
        "Henry: About a minute or two past al dente.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, really.",
        "Katie: Could she wrap her legs around her neck?",
        "Henry: And tie it in a bowtie.",
        "Katie: Hmm. But did she make you happy?",
        "Henry: Well, there's happy and then there's momentary bliss, you know?",
        "Katie: So it is possible to have bliss with somebody and then move on to somebody else. Somebody you can share things with that you couldn't share with somebody who loves Rottweilers.",
        "Henry: Or power tools.",
        "Katie: Like a sense of humor, Fred Astaire movies, card tricks --",
        "Henry: Are you trying to seduce me?",
        "Katie: Is it working?",
        "Henry: Did you -- did you talk to Mike?",
        "Katie: Yes, I did. And he is totally in love with Jennifer and completely committed to being her husband and father to her child.",
        "Henry: Right, but she's determined to go it alone.",
        "Katie: She doesn't want Mike to suffer for her mistakes. But what she doesn't understand is trashing a wonderful relationship because of a mistake is a mistake.",
        "Henry: Okay, I suppose it would be reassuring if Mike and Jen were to get back together.",
        "Katie: So why don't you go over there?",
        "Henry: Over where? The Lakeview?",
        "Katie: Yeah, that's where they're meeting.",
        "Henry: What do you want me to do? Spy on them?",
        "Katie: No! No. Just send over a nice bottle of champagne.",
        "Henry: Jennifer likes to dance, doesn't she?",
        "Katie: And I happen to know that Lisa has musicians on staff. You'll let me know how it goes?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I could do that.",
        "Katie: Because it would be really, really nice if I could tell Snickers that Daddy's coming home tonight.",
        "Henry: I'll call you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Craig hasn't won. He's just trying to intimidate you because he is a bully.",
        "Jennifer: He hired an attorney who's already served me with a subpoena. He wants me to take prenatal DNA test as soon as medically possible and once he's found out that he --",
        "Mike: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Those tests would put the baby at risk. What kind of father would do that?",
        "Jennifer: A father who cares more about his own rights than his child! He wants shared custody. And if I refuse, he'll go for sole custody.",
        "Mike: He'll never get sole custody.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, well, I never thought that he could get a court order for a prenatal DNA test, but obviously he's found a judge who sympathizes with him!",
        "Mike: So we'll get another judge.",
        "Jennifer: There is no we, Mike. That's the point. Now, please. I can't argue about this anymore. It's just too hard.",
        "Mike: You know what? Your kid in 20 years when he comes to you, wants to know why his family's all screwed up? Why he never had a decent father? That it was too hard?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Les insists that he's being framed.",
        "Lily: And you believe him?",
        "Lucinda: Can you look me in the eye and tell me that you're absolutely certain that Morrissey did not plant that cell?",
        "Lily: Why would Keith plant the cell phone unless he was 100% sure that Les's fingerprints were on it?",
        "Lucinda: Maybe he ain't so smart, as you seem to think he is.",
        "Lily: Oh, I see. So it's not bad enough that he murdered his sister that he loved. Now he's stupid. You've made a very nice case for me not getting involved with him. Which is what this is really about anyway, isn't it.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I hope you're not going to, darling, because you're a married woman.",
        "Lily: I'm a separated woman.",
        "Lucinda: With brains, with beauty, with three children. One of them not even out of diapers yet.",
        "Lily: Oh, Keith and I, we thought we should wait to have a child of our own. At least until Natalie's out of pre-K.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: You just mock me. Go ahead, I don't care. I saw what I saw and I saw him with his shirt off and your hands doing -- I don't know what -- you were holding hands. Whatever you want to call it.",
        "Lily: I was holding antiseptic and a bandage. The man was bleeding.",
        "Lucinda: And you were drooling.",
        "Lily: You know what your problem is? You need something to do because you're bored. You need a husband.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, please.",
        "Lily: Or maybe you want to date Keith. That's what this is about. Isn't it?",
        "Lucinda: Don't change the subject, honey.",
        "Lily: Oh, right, because your love life, when we talk about that, that's no good. But me, my love life is up for grabs.",
        "Lucinda: Excuse me. Where are you going? We're not through yet!",
        "Lily: If you'd like to stay and talk to the couch, be my guest.",
        "Lucinda: Honey -- honey, the man is dangerous.",
        "Lily: I don't think so.",
        "Lucinda: Why? Why? Because he looks cute in Holden's shirt?",
        "Lily: Oh, enough!",
        "Lucinda: Be angry! Fe angry! I'm unfair. I don't care. I'm worried about you.",
        "Lily: No you're not. You're worried about change. But things are going to change. Yes, they're going to change. They will never be the same again. Because Holden has moved on, and I'm trying to do the same.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, where are you headed?",
        "Lily: I am going down to the station and talk to Tom to see if there's any more developments in Julia's case.",
        "Lucinda: And, tell me, what about your family that worries about you? Carrying on with somebody who's no good for you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: According to Dr. Harris, Julia's airway was constricted by a swelling of the throat.",
        "Keith: So you're saying she was strangled?",
        "Tom: Well, I can't say. Now we know that she injured her head during the struggle with Lily, and that would be the evidence of the trauma. But until we get a second look at the throat, we really can't be certain what killed her or who did it.",
        "Keith: If you go anywhere near my sister's body, I swear to God I will destroy you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Margo? Do you have a minute?",
        "Margo: No, not really. No.",
        "Sierra: It's about Craig.",
        "Margo: Oh, you heard?",
        "Sierra: What, that he apparently has a child on the way?",
        "Margo: He asked me to vouch for him, but if he's going to go after Jennifer for custody --",
        "Sierra: How do you feel about that?",
        "Margo: With Craig as a father, that child has a better chance tossed onto the open highway.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Yes, it's Craig Montgomery, again. Last time I called, you told me my shipment was due any minute. Oh, well, that's fine. All right, I'm coming right down. You tell Mr. Hwa if the ship docks before I get there I'll meet him on the pier. All right, thank you.",
        "Barbara: Just the man I was looking for.",
        "Craig: Oh, no, I've done that.",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't rush away. We have things to discuss.",
        "Craig: I have business.",
        "Barbara: More important than the future of our family?",
        "Craig: Our family?",
        "Barbara: Yes. According to my daughter, I'm about to become a grandmother, thanks to you.",
        "Craig: You're gonna pour that on my suit?",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't be silly. You know I've always loved you in that suit.",
        "Craig: In boiling oil maybe.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Craig. That was then, this is now. You've made me very happy, and I want to celebrate. Welcome to the family.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: How can you accuse me of giving in? I'm going to fight Craig.",
        "Mike: By, what, letting him call all the shots? Come on, he's already cost us our relationship. Now he's going to get a court order to do tests on your baby? What's next? Is he gonna want to move in with you?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, don't be disgusting.",
        "Mike: Don't you see? He wants total control.",
        "Jennifer: Well, he's not going to get it.",
        "Mike: Fine. Tell him that by marrying me. Look, whoa, whoa. Hey, I know this is hard. And I know that you think you're doing the right thing. But, look, it doesn't have to be like this. All right? Craig -- Craig is just interested in the baby. And once we sort all that out, everybody will be calm. We'll have our family. All right, we'll deal with Craig one crisis at a time. But we'll be together. We'll be a family. Don't let him take that away from you. Okay, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry, it was great. I just -- we weren't expecting a serenade.",
        "Jennifer: Whose idea was this?",
        "Henry: Uh, that would be my idea.",
        "Mike: Katie.",
        "Jennifer: Katie.",
        "Henry: No, Katie's more of a folk rocky kind of gal. I just thought something a little higher end, you know. Or not. [Speaking foreign language] Everything okay?",
        "Mike: No. As a matter of fact, your timing couldn't be worse.",
        "Henry: Okay, I'll just -- I'll leave you two alone.",
        "Mike: No, that's all right. That's all right. I'm all talked out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Did you just threaten me, Mr. Morrissey?",
        "Keith: I'm just making myself clear. That if you dig up my sister's body, I will sue you and I will sue the coroner.",
        "Tom: Your reaction seems a bit extreme.",
        "Keith: Well, how would you feel if they wanted to dig up somebody that you loved?",
        "Tom: If I thought it could solve a murder?",
        "Keith: We know who did it! Sweeny. He put my sister in the hospital more than once. He confessed to J.J. put J.J. up on the stand, and he'll tell you so. Give the jury that phone. I don't care that Sweeny's prints aren't on it, because they jury will see past all that legal mumbo jumbo. Sweeny had motive. He had opportunity. He is guilty as sin. And what you want to do, digging up my sister's body, is just a fishing expedition, and I will not allow it!",
        "Lily: Am I interrupting something?",
        "Tom: You are. I think we could both use a break.",
        "Lily: You all right?",
        "Keith: No, I'm not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You came here for a reason, didn't you?",
        "Sierra: Yes, I did. I feel very responsible for what's happened here. I put Jennifer and Craig together. I forced her to work with him. Barbara warned me not to do it, but I didn't listen, because I was so sure that he had changed. I was so proud of myself that I had finally gotten through to him. But I was wrong. He seduced her. He stole her company. And now he wants to steal her baby. And Jennifer is never going to recover unless I do something to stop it. But I need your help.",
        "Margo: But he is the father. I don't see how we can prevent him from staking his claim.",
        "Sierra: I have an idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faux Hwa: Oh --",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Faux Hwa: I'm sorry. I think I have the wrong address.",
        "Paul: Come on in. You're in the right place. I've been waiting for you.",
        "Faux Hwa: You're looking for an actor?",
        "Paul: Yes, I am. And I -- I think that -- yeah, you might just be perfect for this part.",
        "Faux Hwa: Is this for a commercial? My agent didn't have any details.",
        "Paul: No, it's not a commercial. You'll be playing the part of Hwa, a very powerful businessman from Singapore.",
        "Faux Hwa: Oh, I see. For a film? Well, I did complete an independent film in Chicago last year.",
        "Paul: Great. Yeah, no, it's not a film. It's more of a reality tv show, only, you know, without the cameras.",
        "Faux Hwa: Well, I don't know what my agent told you, but I don't do porn.",
        "Paul: No, of course you don't. Neither do I.",
        "Faux Hwa: What exactly do you want me to do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I realize that this is not the ideal situation. But it is the reality. And I'm nothing if not a pragmatist.",
        "Craig: What's in it for you?",
        "Barbara: Precisely.",
        "Craig: Honest.",
        "Barbara: When Paul told me that Jennifer had run away with Mike and that I'd never see her again, never get a chance to hold my grandchild in my arms --",
        "Craig: She was running away from me.",
        "Barbara: Yes, of course she was. But she would have run away sooner or later, spread her wings. All children do that. But now, with a baby and married to Mike, she's gonna stay right here in Oakdale, all thanks to you.",
        "Craig: Well, that's illogical.",
        "Barbara: But true nonetheless. And if I've learned anything, it's to make the best of things.",
        "Craig: Lemonade?",
        "Barbara: Is it really so hard to love a baby? And if we can't learn to --",
        "Craig: To bury the hatchet?",
        "Barbara: Yes. About things in the past. And look forward to a brighter future, together.",
        "Craig: Sure. Let's celebrate.",
        "Barbara: What are you doing?",
        "Craig: I like champagne. I want to live past the toast.",
        "Barbara: You think that I --?",
        "Craig: Doped the champagne? Well, let's see. Bottoms up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Mike: I know what you did.",
        "Katie: Henry told you?",
        "Mike: Figured it out for myself.",
        "Katie: No, listen, Mike, before you say anything else, just let me explain.",
        "Paul: I thought it would be a good idea to inspect the cargo, make sure that boulevard didn't steal any of Jennifer's designs.",
        "Dusty: In short, this is your worst nightmare.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Mm. Not thirsty?",
        "Barbara: I'm just shocked that you'd think that --",
        "Craig: That I would catch you out?",
        "Barbara: What do you mean?",
        "Craig: You never know what I mean. I am suing your daughter for custody of your grandchild and you want to celebrate. You know I am expecting a shipment of jeans here tonight. That's why you waltzed in here with that bad cocktail, to sabotage me.",
        "Barbara: Don't be ridiculous.",
        "Craig: If I don't show up at the docks to sign for my goods, I don't get the goods. Boulevard Jeans goes bankrupt. That's why you come in here with laced champagne.",
        "Barbara: I've done no such thing, Craig.",

        "Jennifer: Well, the whole town of Oakdale knows I'm carrying Craig's child.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, I know. I meant with you and Mike. I guess Katie thought that maybe some quality alone time together would do the trick.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, well, you know, Katie's been great. I mean, she -- you know, she came to Vegas to stop Craig from ruining our wedding. But, you know, to be completely honest with you, Craig doesn't care who I marry, as long as he can sink his fangs into my child.",
        "Henry: So -- okay. I'm -- you know, I'm a little slow on this sort of thing. But if Craig doesn't care if you marry Mike, then --",
        "Jennifer: Henry, I can't drag Mike into a lifetime of riding to my rescue.",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, Mike was born on a white horse. He was born to do that sort of thing. And if you don't marry him, then he'll find someone else with worse troubles, and you know, and that could be terrible for everybody. For you, especially, because he loves you. He does.",
        "Jennifer: Henry, Katie loves you very much. You do know that, don't you?",

        "[Katie remembering]",
        "Henry: The thing is, Katie, none of this changes how you feel about Mike.",
        "Katie: Would I be bending over backwards trying to get him back together with Jennifer if I still had feelings for him?",
        "Mike: I know what you did.",
        "Katie: Henry told you?",
        "Mike: I figured it out for myself.",

        "Lily: Les?",
        "Keith: Well, if they can prove that he didn't bash her head in that she -- that she just, you know, choked on a pretzel.",
        "Lily: Maybe he punched her in the throat or he strangled her. Nobody knows what happened.",
        "Keith: I know what happened. She's dead. And I'm not gonna let them dig her up body and cause her anymore misery. That's not gonna happen. Nope.",

        "Margo: You should not be saying that to me here.",
        "Sierra: No, my only point -- my only point is I really have tried everything. Because I thought there was something worth salvaging, a soul in there to save. But you know what? I was wrong. And you know what? This may sound incredibly harsh, but in my heart I believe that if Bryant would have had any other father, he would be alive today.",
        "Margo: I don't think Craig would argue with you on that.",
        "Sierra: But would he admit that he killed Alan? That he stood by and let that happen? I mean, I don't have any proof. But I am sure that it was his fault. And I'm sure that it was his fault that Lucy was kidnapped and buried in a box. And what about little Cabot and Rosanna and how she has suffered because he has cut so many corners?",
        "Margo: All right, all right. We agree that Craig is the problem. That's not the issue. It's what to do about him.",
        "Sierra: Well, we can't change him. All we can do is find a way to not stand by and let him destroy that child.",
        "Margo: Sierra, what you're asking me to do is against the law.",
        "Sierra: It's in the name of justice. Listen, we are running out of time. Will you do it?",

        "Jennifer: She meant every word.",
        "Henry: So why did he leave?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, ego. You know how men get. Their pride gets in the way and they can't see the bigger picture. If they'd only stayed, they could lived happily ever after.",
        "Henry: If they hadn't walk out that door. I gotta go. Are you gonna be okay?",

        "Katie: You know, I think from now on, we should just let Mike and Jennifer deal with this on their own.",
