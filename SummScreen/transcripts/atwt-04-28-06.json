        "Emily: What's happened? What have I done with my life? ",
        "[Emily remembering] ",
        "[Gunshot] Oh God! Oh God! Oh, Paul, I loved you. I loved you so much. More \r\nthan myself. More than anything. And now I'm all alone. What am I gonna do? Oh \r\nGod, what am I gonna do? ",
        "[Emily weeping] ",
        "----------------------------------------",
        "Meg: You really know where Emily might be? ",
        "Paul: I was leaning on Henry and he accused me of turning my back on Emily, \r\nand then it all kind of fell into place. I bet she went back to where it all \r\nstarted on New Year\u2019s Eve. ",
        "Meg: The bluff where you were supposed to get married? ",
        "Paul: The bluff where I couldn't go through with the wedding. ",
        "Meg: Oh, come on, Paul, you honestly think she would go back to the same \r\nplace where she gunned you down? I don't think so. ",
        "Paul: I don't know. I feel like there's some kind of pattern. I mean, she \r\nshot me there and then she takes Dusty back there to the same woods and holds \r\nhim hostage. And I don't know what it is, but I feel like she has some kind of \r\nsick connection to that place. ",
        "Meg: But why now? To what end? ",
        "Paul: I'm not sure. One way or the other, I'm going up there and I'm gonna \r\nfind out. ",
        "Meg: No. No more heroics, okay? Let the police handle this. We're calling \r\nHal.",
        "------------------------------------------------- ",
        "Hal: Any word on Emily? ",
        "Cop #1: No, lieutenant. But state troopers are teaming up with us to cover \r\nall exits out of town. ",
        "Susan: I know my daughter, Hal. She's scared. She wants to turn herself in, \r\nbut she doesn't know how. ",
        "Hal: Yeah, well, I want to believe that. But at this point, anything is \r\npossible. For all we know, Emily could be halfway to Mexico by now. ",
        "Tom: I found this on my doorstep this morning. ",
        "Hal: Looks like Emily's handwriting. ",
        "Tom: \"My dearest Daniel, Mommy wishes she had more to give you.\" ",
        "Susan: Can I see that? ",
        "Hal: That's it? One line? ",
        "Tom: No, this was in a box along with the note. Look familiar to either of \r\nyou? ",
        "Susan: It's a family heirloom. It belonged to Emily's grandfather. She got it \r\nwhen he died. She told me she wanted to give it to Daniel when he turned 13. ",
        "Tom: So then if she left it on my doorstep to give to him now -- ",
        "Susan: What? ",
        "Tom: That means she's serious about running. I think it's time to call in the \r\nfeds. ",
        "Susan: No, please. You don't need the FBI for this. ",
        "Hal: I was gonna hold off a little longer on that. I still want to believe we \r\ncan bring her in ourselves. ",
        "Tom: For all we know, she's already crossed state lines. ",
        "Hal: I don't think so. I don't think she's left this city. We've got \r\nroadblocks up everywhere. ",
        "Susan: If you bring in the fbi, that's gonna drive her into a corner. Who \r\nknows what she'll do? This isn't her fault. If you want to sic the feds on \r\nsomebody, send them after Paul Ryan. This is his fault, not hers. He's the one \r\nyou need to lock up! ",
        "-----------------------------------------------------",
        "Dusty: Jennifer, there's nothing you can do for your brother right now that \r\nwon't put you in danger. He's out there looking for Emily. So are the cops. You \r\ndon't want to put yourself in the middle of that. ",
        "Jennifer: So you really expect me to sit here waiting and worrying. ",
        "Dusty: Your father's gonna fill you in on everything that happens. ",
        "Jennifer: Unfortunately, my father doesn't care about Paul any more than you \r\ndo. He still believes that Paul and Emily were working together. ",
        "Dusty: So do I. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, you're both wrong. Paul wants to bring Emily in. ",
        "Dusty: Why does he even care? ",
        "Jennifer: Because he feels responsible for the state she's in. He knows he \r\npushed her over the edge. ",
        "Dusty: Well, it's gonna end up bad because Emily's a psychopath. Your brother \r\nmight end up dead and take Meg along with him. You think I'm gonna let you walk \r\ninto that trap? ",
        "Jennifer: Honey, that's not gonna happen. ",
        "[Dusty sighs] ",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry I don't trust him like you do, and there's a reason for \r\nthat. There's a reason I'm not taking any chances. When I was away -- when I was \r\nlocked up all that time, you and Johnny were the only thing that kept me going. \r\nI held on because I got to come home to you guys. Nothing's gonna take you away \r\nfrom me, you understand? Nothing. ",
        "--------------------------------------------",
        "[Emily weeping] ",
        "Emily: Oh God! Oh, Paul, why did you leave me? Oh God, I'm lost without you!\r\n",
        "Paul: Turn around. ",
        "Emily: Paul? You're here. ",
        "Paul: Yes, I'm here. ",
        "Emily: I knew you'd come. Oh God, I knew you'd come for me because you still \r\nlove me! Please, I'm so scared. Tell me what to do. You're so cold. You're like \r\nice. Why are you looking at me like that? ",
        "Paul: Do you really think I'd here to help you? Do you really think I could \r\nfeel anything but hate towards you? After what you did? There's no love here. \r\nNot tonight. ",
        "Emily: Don't say that. Please don't say that. You're scaring me, Paul. ",
        "Paul: Oh, you should be scared. Tonight you face everyone you've ever hurt. \r\nTonight there will finally be justice. ",
        "Jennifer: How could you do this, Emily? ",
        "Meg: You tried to destroy my life and you're gonna pay for it. ",
        "Emily: No. ",
        "Jennifer: You hurt me so much. You kept my child from me for so long. ",
        "Emily: No, no, I thought I was doing the right thing. ",
        "Jennifer: And then you took Dusty from me. ",
        "Dusty: I almost died because of you. I almost lost everything that matters to \r\nme. Now it's your turn. ",
        "Emily: Oh God! Make them stop, please! Oh God, make them stop",
        "Paul: This wound in my chest is just one of your crimes. Tonight, you will \r\nanswer for al of them. ",
        "Emily: I never meant for it to happen. I never meant for things to get so out \r\nof control. ",
        "Paul: Oh, but they did, didn't they? ",
        "Emily: No. ",
        "Paul: And now you're going to get what you deserve. ",
        "Emily: No, no, I know what I did was terrible. Unforgivable, even. But can't \r\nyou just give me a second chance? Please, just one more chance. ",
        "Paul: It's too late for that it's way too late. ",
        "Henry: Didn't I tell you that Paul was on to you, Em? Didn't I warn you to \r\nget out of Dodge? But you didn't listen to me, though, did you? You never listen \r\nto me. ",
        "Emily: I just wanted him to love me. ",
        "Henry: I know, I know. That just proves how pathetic you really are. ",
        "Emily: Don't say that. You're supposed to be my friend. ",
        "Henry: I tried, Emily. I bent over backwards to be Mr. Compassionate for you, \r\nbut you used me more as a servant than a friend. You stole my money. You used me \r\nto get what you wanted. You never thought about what I needed. It was always \r\nyou, you, you. ",
        "Emily: No, I did care. I thought you wanted me to find happiness. ",
        "Henry: Not by involving me in kidnapping and planting evidence. That's not \r\nfriendship, Emily, its blackmail. ",
        "Emily: No, but I did it because I love Paul. You knew that! ",
        "Henry: Change the track, will you? I am sick and tired of the same old song.\r\n",
        "Emily: Tell him! Tell him! He doesn't understand! He doesn't understand \r\neverything I did was because I love you. Please, tell him! ",
        "Dusty: You don't know what love is! That's the problem. For love, you took a \r\nchild away from its mother? For love, you kidnapped me and tried to frame it on \r\nMeg? ",
        "Meg: For love, you'd pull the trigger and kill the man you claim you can't \r\nlive without? That's not love, Emily. ",
        "Dusty: It's madness. Pure and simple. Let's face it, you've lost your mind, \r\nand there's no going back. ",
        "Emily: No, no! Oh God, no! ",
        "---------------------------------------------------",
        "Jennifer: The cops are after Emily, not Paul. ",
        "Dusty: Right now. But once they find her, don't be surprised if they get her \r\nto implicate him. ",
        "Jennifer: Paul had nothing to do with your kidnapping. Not after what Emily \r\ndid to him. Honey, I saw that gunshot wound. You don't have to be a doctor to \r\nknow that that was not a self-inflicted wound. She put that bullet in his back.\r\n",
        "Dusty: And as far as s know, it could have been foreplay that got out of \r\nhand. ",
        "Jennifer: What a horrible thing to say. ",
        "Dusty: I'm just saying, I don't want you to trust your brother so quickly. \r\nYou understand? No matter what he tells you, he's always looking out for \r\nhimself. So if he's out there really looking for Emily, he's taking care of \r\nhimself. Don't worry. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm sorry. But if something happened to my brother and I did \r\nnothing about it, I would never be able to live with myself. And I'm sorry that \r\nyou can't understand that. ",
        "Dusty: Jen -- ",
        "Jennifer: Look, obviously, we've said everything that needs to be said. And \r\nobviously, we will never see eye to eye on this. So, I'm just going to go. ",
        "Dusty: No, wait a second. Jennifer, Jennifer. If you're really doing this, \r\nI'm calling the babysitter, because I'm going with you. ",
        "---------------------------------------------------",
        "Emily: You have no right to judge me! I won't let you judge me like this! \r\n[Emily sobs] Jennifer, you're here. You're not like them. You're a good person. \r\nTell me that you understand that I never set out to hurt you. We love Paul. Tell \r\nthem. Tell them I did what I had to because I love him. ",
        "Jennifer: I can't do that, Emily. Because you're incapable of love. You're \r\ndangerous. To yourself and to everyone around you. ",
        "Emily: I'm a woman, just like you. I want to be loved. ",
        "Jennifer: Then how could take Dusty away from me and keep him locked up? \r\n[Johnny fussing] You let me think that he was dead! Just like you did with \r\nJohnny. You kept my child from me! ",
        "[Johnny crying] ",
        "Jennifer: What kind of a mother are you, anyway? ",
        "Emily: I love my son. I would do anything for him. ",
        "Jennifer: Then why isn't he with you? ",
        "Why did Tom take him away from you? ",
        "Daniel: Mommy where are you? ",
        "Emily: Oh, God, Daniel! Oh, oh! I missed you so much, my baby! ",
        "Daniel: Mommy? I can't find you. I'm scared. ",
        "Emily: Honey, I'm right here! Oh, God, I'm right in front of you! Please see \r\nme! Oh, God! Daniel, I'm right here! ",
        "----------------------------------------------",
        "Tom: Susan, blaming Paul Ryan for everything is not helping anyone, least of \r\nall Emily. Now, Hal is gonna need all the help he can get tracking her down, and \r\nif that means calling the FBI, then he should, by all means. ",
        "Susan: You didn't see the desperation in her eyes. I did! She's at the end of \r\nher rope. ",
        "Tom: That is why she's running. ",
        "Susan: No, no, I disagree. I think that note means that she's planning \r\nsomething much more drastic. ",
        "------------------------------------------",
        "Daniel: Mommy? Where are you? ",
        "Emily: I'm right here. Mommy's right in front of you. I'm -- ",
        "Tom: Don't you touch him. ",
        "Margo: We're not about to let you destroy this poor boy's life. You've \r\npoisoned him. You've poisoned everything you touch. ",
        "Emily: How could you think I would ever hurt my son?! ",
        "Daniel: I can't see you. ",
        "Emily: Oh, God. ",
        "Daniel: Are you here? ",
        "Tom: Don't you understand? You're dead to him now, and its better that way.\r\n",
        "Emily: Oh, no. You tricked him! You made him tell you -- told him that I was \r\nnever coming home! You made this little boy believe that I abandoned him. ",
        "Margo: We would never hurt Daniel. ",
        "Emily: Oh, yes, you would! You've been wanting to get rid of me for years. \r\nGive me my son! Give me my child! ",
        "Tom: No, Emily, I'm sorry. It's time to say good-bye. ",
        "Emily: Please! I know I made mistakes, but I never deserved having my son \r\ntaken away from me! Please, bring him back! ",
        "Barbara: Listen to you. How desperate you sound. Do you know what happens to \r\ndesperate people, Emily? They get locked up so they can't hurt anyone. ",
        "Emily: I am not crazy. ",
        "Barbara: Oh, trust me, I know all the signs. I've been there myself. Now, it \r\ncan be a little scary in the beginning, but pretty soon, you'll just -- you'll \r\nbe comforted, just to let go, take a nice, long rest and let other people make \r\ndecisions for you. ",
        "Emily: No. You did this! It all goes back to you! You ruined Paul, and then \r\nhe ruined me! You're the horrible mother, not me! ",
        "Barbara: How easy it is to throw stones when your back is against the wall. \r\nThe truth is, Emily, you've brought this all on yourself. ",
        "Emily: No. No, it was you who twisted Paul's mind. You messed him up when he \r\nwas growing up, and now he doesn't know how to love. ",
        "Barbara: No, darling, he just doesn't know how to love you. ",
        "Emily: No, he did love me. He loved me, I know it. I could feel it. And we \r\nwould still be together if it weren't for you! ",
        "[Barbara laughs] ",
        "Barbara: How pathetic you are. Listen to yourself, Emily. Paul doesn't love \r\nyou. He never did. ",
        "--------------------------------------------------",
        "Paul: Stop. Look, the last thing we want is for Hal to be involved. For him, \r\nthis is all way too personal. ",
        "Meg: Oh, and it's not personal for you? Because it seems to me like you've \r\ngot your own axe to grind with Emily. ",
        "Paul: I have my reasons for finding Emily, but none of them are anything to \r\ndo with vengeance. I feel responsible. I feel like, since I'm the one that \r\npushed her to this point, I'm the one that should go get her help. ",
        "Meg: You know, I still can't believe that you're blaming yourself for what \r\nshe's done. ",
        "Paul: But I am to blame, partly. Look, when I told her that I couldn't marry \r\nher on New Year\u2019s Eve, I did it so that she could be free -- free from me, and \r\nfree from all of my baggage. And I know that I was doing it because Jennifer \r\npointed out that I should put somebody else's needs in front of mine. But she \r\ndoesn't know that. And she felt rejected. She felt kicked in the teeth. And it \r\nstarted this downward spiral, and people got hurt. Can you understand why I \r\nwould want to make this right? ",
        "Meg: Well, what makes you think that it's not too late? ",
        "Paul: I don't know, I just -- I want to get there before the cops get there \r\nand something terrible happens. ",
        "[Meg sighs] ",
        "Meg: I'm not gonna talk you out of this, am I? ",
        "Paul: No. ",
        "Meg: Okay, then I'm going with you. ",
        "Paul: No -- ",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no. I almost lost you once. It's not gonna happen again. ",
        "Paul: All right. Let's go. I hope we're not too late. ",
        "Dusty: Where's Emily? ",
        "Paul: I have no idea. ",
        "Dusty: Oh, you know, and you're gonna tell me. Tell me, now. ",
        "Paul: Dusty, there's no conspiracy here. Emily's on her own. We have no idea \r\nwhere she is. ",
        "Dusty: Where are you going in such a hurry? ",
        "Paul: I don't think that's really any of your business. ",
        "Meg: We're gonna go see Hal at the police station. ",
        "Jennifer: Is there news? ",
        "Meg: That's what we're trying to find out. ",
        "Paul: Yeah, maybe the police have had some luck tracking her down. We'll let \r\nyou know if we find anything. ",
        "Jennifer: Okay, Paul, don't shut us out. If you know something, please tell \r\nus. We want to help. ",
        "Paul: There's nothing to do. There's nothing for any of us to do except wait. \r\nWe're leaving this one to the police. ",
        "Dusty: If you find Emily, you better bring her in. If you let her get away, \r\nyou'll deal with me. ",
        "Meg: Let's go. ",
        "Paul: Thank you. ",
        "Dusty: If he wants to figure out the progress that Hal\u2019s making, all he has \r\nto do is pick up the phone. I bet he knows where Emily is and they're going \r\nafter her on their own. ",
        "Jennifer: Well, even if that's true, I don't think he was planning on helping \r\nEmily escape. He wouldn't do that. ",
        "Dusty: Well, I've got to make sure, 'cause Emily's gonna pay for what she \r\ndid. So does -- so does Paul. Let's go. ",
        "-----------------------------------------------------",
        "Emily: I know Paul loved me once. I couldn't have been wrong about it. I know \r\nit. I could feel it. I know it was real. ",
        "Barbara: Oh, please. You wouldn't know love if it walked up and bit you. \r\nYou're a leech, Emily. You attach yourself to people, and you suck the life out \r\nof them. It's dependence, its addiction, and it's sick. ",
        "Emily: Paul loved me! And so did Hal. Don't tell me I don't know what love \r\nis! I have a soul! I have a heart! ",
        "Hal: I thought you did. ",
        "Emily: Oh -- ",
        "Hal: That's why I fell in love with you. But it wasn't enough. ",
        "Emily: Oh, Hal -- oh, God, Hal, please, don't give up on me! Please, help me!\r\n",
        "Hal: It's too late, Emily. Even if I could love you again it's too late. ",
        "Emily: Oh, no. ",
        "------------------------------------------------",
        "Susan: At least tell your people to be gentle with her. She's so fragile \r\nright now. Whatever else you may think about her, however she may have hurt you, \r\nI know you don't want to see her hurt. ",
        "Hal: Of course I don\u2019t. ",
        "Susan: Anymore than I do. ",
        "Tom: Hal has a duty to the law, so don't forget that. ",
        "Susan: What about your duty to your son? If something happens to his mother, \r\nare you ready to explain it to him. ",
        "Tom: Look, I know you're scared for your daughter, Susan, but if anyone is \r\ngonna give Emily the benefit of the doubt, its Hal. ",
        "Susan: Convince me, Hal. Tell me you still love Emily enough to keep her \r\nsafe. Please, don't let anybody hurt her. ",
        "-------------------------------------------",
        "Hal: I could tell you that I still love you. I could tell you that you were \r\nthe best thing that ever happened to me. But what good would it do? Because you \r\nnever cared about me, not really. I was just a calm in the storm a temporary \r\nlull in the chaos you call your life! ",
        "Emily: I know, and I should have appreciated you more! I know that, 'cause we \r\nwere good together. We were good together. You kept me grounded. ",
        "Hal: Then why did you trash everything that we had? Why did you hurt me? ",
        "Emily: I never meant to. ",
        "Hal: But you did, because you can't be grateful with what you've got. You \r\nalways want more. And one day, you decided that wasn't enough! ",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. ",
        "Hal: No, I'm sorry, because you left me with a black hole where my heart used \r\nto be. And the only thing that will fill it now is to see you brought to \r\njustice. ",
        "Emily: No, no, you can't mean that. Please, you can't be so cruel. I'm sure \r\nyou can find some way to show me some mercy! Hal, please! ",
        "Hal: I wish I could. ",
        "Emily: Oh, God. ",
        "Hal: But I don't seem to have any left. ",
        "Emily: Oh, God! ",
        "Hal: You have to go away for a long time, Emily. It's what you deserve. ",
        "Emily: Oh, no. ",
        "Dusty: For kidnapping me, and torturing me. ",
        "Meg: For setting me up for crime I didn't commit. ",
        "Jennifer: For trying to take my baby away from me. ",
        "Emily: No, please. Please, stop tormenting me. ",
        "Tom: For abandoning your only child. ",
        "Margo: Daniel deserves a better mother than the likes of you. ",
        "Daniel: Mommy? Where are you? ",
        "Emily: Oh, God! I'm right here, Daniel! ",
        "Hal: He can't hear you, Emily. ",
        "Henry: You betrayed my friendship. You made me waste a perfectly good \r\ncocktail set on you. ",
        "Emily: Oh, no. ",
        "Hal: It's time for you to suffer. ",
        "Barbara: For everything you did to Paul. Thank God you will finally be out of \r\nmy son's life. ",
        "Susan: Let me through. Let me get to my daughter. ",
        "Emily: Please -- ",
        "Susan: Let me get to her. ",
        "Emily: Oh, thank God you're here. ",

        "Susan: That is not fair. Emily loves Daniel. She's scared of you. She's \r\nalways been terrified that you're gonna take Daniel away, and that's just what \r\nyou've done! ",
        "Tom: Well, I had no choice. After what she's done, did you seriously think I \r\nshould leave him in her care? I should have taken him a long time ago. But Margo \r\nand I have bent over backwards to try to keep Emily in Daniel's life. Every time \r\nshe messed up, I forgave her. I always offered her a second chance. ",
        "Hal: We all have. That's part of the mistake. Emily's had so many second \r\nchances, she thinks she can get away with anything right now. I'm as guilty as \r\nyou are, Susan. But I think it's time we took off the blinders and stopped \r\nmaking excuses. ",
        "Susan: I'm not making excuses for my daughter. I'm pleading for her life. If \r\nyou two don't understand that, then neither of you deserve to be called a \r\nparent. ",

        "Emily: No, would you listen to me? Just listen to what I'm saying! We don't \r\nhave time! You -- you have friends. You have friends in other countries, right? \r\nI know you do. You've got people that can make documents for us. Listen to me, \r\nMexico. We would love Mexico, and we would be happy there. We could pretend \r\nthese last four months never happened! ",
        "Paul: Okay, stop! Look, forget about Mexico! Listen to me. You -- we need to \r\nfocus on getting out of here, all right? Now, someone could have found our cars \r\nby now, and in a few minutes, this place could be overrun with cops. I mean -- \r\nnot now. It's not now, all right? Right now, it's just you and me, but we need \r\nto focus on getting out of here. We need to think fast. And you -- Emily, you \r\nneed -- you need to trust me one more time. Can you do that, huh?

        "Emily: Stop it! Shut up! I don't believe a word you say. And you -- you came \r\nhere together. You came here together to hurt me. Oh, my God, what, are you \r\ngonna kill me? You want to kill me up here? ",
        "Paul: How can you even say that? We came to help you! ",
        "Emily: What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? You gonna bury me in the \r\nwoods so nobody'll find me? That's a great idea. You could just tell everybody I \r\njust run away and then you two could be off and run to be together. You -- you \r\nand that slut of yours. ",
        "Meg: You're wrong, Emily. ",
        "Emily: Shut up! Shut up! And you -- your wedding ring? You couldn't wait to \r\ntake it off, could you? Because our marriage was nothing but a lie! It was a \r\ntrick! It was a trick! ",

        "Emily: Why'd you marry me anyway? So I would tell you the truth about Dusty? \r\nAnd you? I know you were on it the whole time. You and Jennifer, all of you. You \r\nall -- you all want me to believe your lies, all of you. But I'm -- I'm smarter \r\nthan you. I'm smarter than all of you. I hear everything. I see everything. And \r\nI know you all just want to hurt me. ",
        "Paul: Nobody wants to hurt you. Emily, nobody wants to hurt you! Okay, \r\nlisten, you're very frightened right now so you are imagining things. But -- \r\nbut, don't turn your back on me, all right? You said it yourself, I'm the only \r\none left that can help you. ",
        "Emily: Oh, stop pretending you care! You don't give a damn! My eyes are wide \r\nopen, now. You care about Meg. You've always cared about Meg! I heard you say it \r\nin the woods yesterday! You told Hal that all you cared about was Meg's freedom.\r\n",
        "Paul: Yeah, I only said that for Hal\u2019s sake. So that he wouldn't suspect that \r\nI was gonna come look for you. ",
        "Emily: Oh, yeah. You came -- you came -- you came for me, but didn't come to \r\nhelp me, you came -- you came to hurt me. To get me out of the way so you could \r\nbe with her! ",
        "Paul: Meg, I think maybe you should just go -- ",
        "Emily: Oh, stop it! You really think that's gonna make a difference? I will \r\nnever trust you, again. I will never go anywhere with you, ever again! ",

        "Jennifer: That could mean all sorts of different things. ",

        "Jennifer: She -- honey, she's obsessed when it comes to Paul. So obsessed \r\nthat she builds this fantasy world. ",
        "Dusty: Like hearing voices? ",
        "Jennifer: Just because she had this conviction that she was doing Paul's \r\nbidding, it doesn't mean that Paul was behind any of the things that she's done.\r\n",
        "Dusty: Well, if it turns out you're right, nobody's gonna be happier than me. \r\nBut my only concern's protecting you. Whatever it takes. ",

        "Paul: No. So I can make sure you're treated fairly. ",
        "Emily: Fairly? Fairly? What's fair about the police targeting me and not you, \r\nhuh? From the minute we were together, all I wanted was to make you happy. I \r\njust didn't know how sick you were. How far you'd go to protect your own sister \r\n-- but here we are, months later, and the police are targeting me and you're \r\nwalking around scot free. ",
        "Paul: You're right. Don't you think that they should know that? They should \r\nbe coming after me. You have to set the record straight, Emily, right? I mean, \r\nif you run now, you take the rap for everything. I get off scot free. ",
