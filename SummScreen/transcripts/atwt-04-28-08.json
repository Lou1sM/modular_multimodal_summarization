        "Margo: So, what are the chances, you and me having lunch alone? Bad guys must be having a field day.",
        "Tom: Well, what the bad guys don't know is that we will be planning the demise over moo shu chicken. Wasn't he there when we left? Have you moved?",
        "Casey: Sure, I did. I got breakfast.",
        "Tom: Why are you cleaning up after him?",
        "Margo: He's got -- to keep from smacking him.",
        "Tom: Hey Case, it's got to stop. You can't lay around the house all day. You got to start looking to your future.",
        "Casey: It's all planned out, Man. Lunch, maybe some channel surfing. It's not like I have a job to go to or anything, right?",
        "Margo: Come off it. Emily Stewart's not the last employer in the world.",
        "Tom: Thank God. Your mom's right. The last thing you need right now is to be working for Emily Stewart.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Okay. I thought I heard you say something no way you could actually have been saying.",
        "Liberty: I said I'm your daughter. You're my father.",
        "Brad: Ha, okay. This is perfect. This is -- you -- I mean, there, for a second, you almost had me going. [Imitates Darth Vader] \"Brad, you are my father.\" You're bad. You are so bad. Where did you find her?",
        "Katie: I've never seen her before in my life.",
        "Brad: Jack. I mean, it's got to be Jack.",
        "Liberty: I don't -- I don't know any Jack.",
        "Brad: Are you ser -- are you serious?",
        "Liberty: Of course I'm serious. I don't just go up to every old guy I see and accuse them of being my dad.",
        "Brad: Hey, I'm not old.",
        "Katie: Wait a second. I think I understand. I got it. This actually happens a lot. It's not a big deal. You see someone on TV and you feel really close to them, like they're a part of your family or something.",
        "Liberty: Oh, God, no! I'm really not a crazy, creepy stalker girl. I -- my mother is Janet Jaconi.",
        "Brad: Juicy Janet. We called her that because she really liked juice. She was a big juice fan.",
        "Katie: So you know this Janet woman.",
        "Brad: I haven't thought about her since junior prom night. She was something else.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I don't think Parker needs to hear his parents arguing right now, do you?",
        "Jack: Thanks, anyway, but this conversation is between Carly and me. You're not involved.",
        "Holden: I helped Carly bring Parker to the hospital. That makes me involved.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I would have been there, too, if she had made a phone call!",
        "Holden: There was a lot going on, okay? We just wanted to get Parker to the hospital. Why don't you just cut her some slack?",
        "Jack: This didn't just slip her mind in the heat of the moment, did it?",
        "Carly: No. Actually, I thought about calling you, and I decided against it.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Carly: Because I didn't want you here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Why can't I work for Emily? Is it because you two got it on way back when?",
        "Tom: You're way out of line!",
        "Margo: Emily Stewart is trouble, and that's the last thing you need right now, unless you enjoy being held hostage.",
        "Casey: Okay, it's not like she forced that crazy judge to come in the office and like --",
        "Margo: These kinds of things happen to Emily all the time, and I can't let you be put at risk.",
        "Casey: Well, thanks for saving me, Mom.",
        "Margo: Oh, you -- get down to the station and give me your statement about what happened at Worldwide.",
        "Casey: Okay, whatever.",
        "Margo: Whatever. Make sure he gets there. I can't be trusted around him right now.",
        "Tom: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You don't want to see me, that's your call, but no way do you keep me from my kids.",
        "Carly: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Holden: You know what? I'll round up the kids and take Sage out to the farm. You guys can focus on Parker.",
        "Carly: Thanks. Would you mind picking up J.J.? He knows somebody's coming.",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah, sure. No problem. I'll meet you out at the farm?",
        "Carly: Thank you, Holden. I don't know what I would have done without you.",
        "Jack: So, you called J.J. and not me.",
        "Carly: Yeah. But it wasn't so very long ago, Jack, you accused me of coming up with excuses to call you, and you can't have it both ways!",
        "Jack: And what I do have is custody of our kids, and unless you want to fight that out in court, you respect that and me.",
        "Carly: Oh. Every time we argue, you threaten to take my kids away. When is that gonna stop?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Now you know it's true. You're my dad.",
        "Brad: No. Wait, wait. Hold on. I didn't say that. I just said I remember your mom.",
        "Katie: Pretty well, it sounds like.",
        "Brad: Did Janet send you here?",
        "Liberty: We saw you on TV. She told me who you were. I decided to come here because I wanted to meet my dad.",
        "Brad: Stop saying that.",
        "Katie: Would you excuse us for just a second? Come here. Well, my dear, you have arrived. This is so classic. Old girlfriend comes out of the woodwork --",
        "Brad: She wasn't a girlfriend.",
        "Katie: Well, whatever. She sees you on TV, she remembered you from high school, she sends in her little daughter to cash in. It's one of the problems of celebrity.",
        "Brad: So this means I'm a celebrity. Huh.",
        "Katie: Just stop gloating and go tell that girl there's no way you're her father. There's no way you're her father, is there?",
        "Brad: Well, there could kind of maybe be a way. Come on, I was in high school. She was Juicy Janet. Come on.",
        "Katie: So she could be your daughter.",
        "Brad: I mean, what are the odds? It's not like we had a long-term kind of thing.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but there was a thing.",
        "Brad: It was junior prom, Katie. I was 17. How old are you? How old?",
        "Liberty: 16, almost 17.",
        "Brad: Okay, you know what? Look, I'm awful in math. Uh -- and meanwhile, it could all be a total coincidence.",
        "Liberty: You know, if you don't believe me, you can talk to my mom.",
        "Katie: She's just gonna back up her story.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, but, you know, my mom is one of the most honest people I know. She doesn't lie.",
        "Brad: So, what am I gonna say, \"Hey, Juicy. Hey, how's it going? Something you forgot to tell me?\" I explained about the juice thing already.",
        "Katie: Well, listen. No offense, really, to you or your mom, but we're gonna need some proof that you are who you say you are, so you're gonna need to take a DNA test.",
        "Liberty: That works for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hi, I'm Jack Snyder, Parker's father. How's he doing?",
        "Carly: Is he all right?",
        "Doctor: Can you both come inside, please?",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Parker: You guys okay?",
        "Jack: We should be the ones asking you that.",
        "Parker: I could hear you fighting.",
        "Carly: Oh, we're sorry. We're just very worried about you.",
        "Doctor: There's nothing to be worried about. At worst, Parker may have a mild concussion.",
        "Jack: So he's gonna be okay.",
        "Doctor: You can take him home, but watch him carefully. Keep him from falling asleep for at least six hours.",
        "Carly: Okay, thank you. Well, that's good news, huh? Come on, Sweetheart, I'll take you home.",
        "Jack: No. We'll take you home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hey, Margo. Did you happen to see that interview with the judge's nanny on \"Oakdale Now\"?",
        "Margo: No, can't say that I have.",
        "Emily: Well, you know what? It proves everything I wrote in \"The Intruder\" was the truth.",
        "Margo: Well, good. You'll be a shoe-in for muckraker of the year.",
        "Emily: Oh, please. Please! If you had read the same article in the \"City Times,\" you wouldn't have batted an eye. Let me ask you this -- would you let Casey work for me if I was the editor of a respectable paper?",
        "Margo: I wouldn't let Casey work for you if you had a room full of Pulitzer prizes.",
        "Emily: Right. You know what your problem is, Margo?",
        "Margo: Hmm?",
        "Emily: You never got over what happened between me and Tom. And the sad thing is, you have no problem letting Casey suffer for it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: What's wrong?",
        "Alison: Possibly the fact that I'm spending my first day of nursing school sitting here.",
        "Chris: What happened?",
        "Alison: I don't know. I went to go to my first class, and I started feeling lightheaded and sick to my stomach. Okay, smiling when someone's telling you how lousy they feel, bad bedside manner, Hughes.",
        "Chris: Hey, I have all the sympathy in the world for my patients, but you're not sick, Ali. All you're suffering from is nerves.",
        "Alison: Well, you might think that, but my stomach is not with the program. Excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You are probably the only person in the world who would dream that I could forget what happened to our family when you got involved with Tom. You are poison, Emily, and if you know what's good for you, you will stay as far away from my son as possible.",
        "Emily: Yeah, 'cause I'm such a bad influence, right? I'm the reason why Casey ended up in jail? You know what? Maybe I'm why Adam ran God knows where.",
        "Margo: Don't you dare bring my other son into this!",
        "Emily: Fine. Let's talk about my son, Daniel. Great kid. No spots on his record. But, boy, I really poisoned him, didn't I? So, you know what, lady? If you want to look at the woman who's hurting her sons, try looking in the mirror.",
        "Casey: Emily! That's enough. Don't talk to my mom like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Susan, I need some discretion here, okay?",
        "Susan: Oh, this should be good.",
        "Brad: I need a -- I need a paternity test.",
        "Susan: You and Katie already? And you don't think you're the father?",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no. Not me and Katie. I need that girl. I need that girl tested.",
        "Susan: How old is she?",
        "Brad: No, it's not that. No. She's my daughter. At least she says she is.",
        "Susan: She must be pretty desperate to claim you as the daddy.",
        "Brad: That's right. And you can help her out by proving her wrong.",
        "Susan: Okay. Let's put everybody out of their misery. What's her name? You don't know her name?",
        "Brad: I'm -- I'm so unpaternal. I'm so not her father. Okay, uh -- okay. Um, I'm sorry. What's your name?",
        "Liberty: It's Liberty.",
        "Brad: Why would your mother name you that?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. Why don't you ask her? Look, are we gonna take this test or what?",
        "Katie: Yes, absolutely. As soon as possible.",
        "Susan: Okay. Brad, we'll start with you. I'll take a sample of your DNA and then a sample of Liberty's.",
        "Brad: Is this gonna hurt?",
        "Liberty: So, you've known my dad for a while?",
        "Katie: I have known Brad for quite a while, yeah.",
        "Liberty: He is my father, you know. That test is only gonna prove it.",
        "Katie: Parker, what's wrong?",
        "Parker: Some airhead girl knocked me off my skateboard. She ran off and then left me passed out on the ground.",
        "Jack: What are you doing here?",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm just with Brad and -- and he is getting some tests taken.",
        "Carly: I hope he's okay.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm sure this problem will be cleared up really soon. Well, take care.",
        "Parker: Thanks.",
        "Katie: Good to see you. Where'd you go?",
        "Liberty: I just had to get some water.",
        "Brad: Okay, you can go and give your sample and we can get this, uh, whatever sorted out. There's no way.",
        "Katie: Of course not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Ali! Ali, I'm sorry you're sick. I didn't mean to make light of it. I just thought you were -- Ali, are you okay?",
        "Alison: Go away. Far, far away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You know what? Casey, my life would only improve if I never spoke to your mother again. The only reason I came down here was to give my statement about what happened at Worldwide.",
        "Margo: 'Cause we know what a model citizen you are.",
        "Casey: I came here to give my statement, too. How you doing?",
        "Emily: You know how I am.",
        "Margo: I know that I'm not your favorite person right now, but it really did feel good hearing you stick up for me.",
        "Casey: I shut Emily down because you're my mom, not because I thought you were right.",
        "Officer: Casey Hues, this way, please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey, where are you going?",
        "Parker: My room.",
        "Carly: No, you're not.",
        "Jack: Didn't you hear the doctor say that we needed to keep an eye on you? So down here. Down here where we can watch you, please.",
        "Carly: Are you hungry? Can I get you something to eat?",
        "Parker: No, thanks.",
        "Jack: Why don't we see what's on the old teley. Oh, great. A baseball game.",
        "Carly: Jack, a game?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Why? What's wrong?",
        "Carly: I don't know. Nine innings. It's just kind of slow. I don't want it to put him to sleep.",
        "Jack: Parker, you want to watch the baseball game?",
        "Parker: It's fine.",
        "Carly: Parker!",
        "Parker: What? I'm watching.",
        "Carly: You're not watching. Your eyes are closed. His eyes are closed.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'm sorry. Maybe this wasn't such a great idea. We could play a little bit of -- maybe we'll have a catch or something like that, okay?",
        "Parker: Sure, whatever.",
        "Jack: What's wrong with your mitt?",
        "Parker: It's just that scrape. You remember how I got it?",
        "Jack: At the Cubs game, right?",
        "Carly: When you caught that foul ball?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I fell out of my seat and scraped the mitt, but I still caught it.",
        "Carly: The mitt wasn't the only thing you scraped, as I recall.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but it was definitely worth it, catching that ball and getting it autographed, back when we were a real family.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that was a great day.",
        "Carly: The greatest. You know, I'm sure Holden's not expecting to watch J.J. and Sage all day and night, so I'll go get them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Blood taken. Now what? Do we wait till they call our names when they're done testing it?",
        "Katie: Well, it's a hospital, not a fast-food joint. It's gonna take a week, maybe two.",
        "Liberty: You're kidding? Why so slow?",
        "Brad: Believe me, I want to get this over with just as much as you do. Now give us your cell number and we'll call you when the results are in.",
        "Liberty: I don't have one.",
        "Katie: What kind of teenage girl doesn't have a cell phone?",
        "Liberty: The kind that loses it on the bus coming to meet her dad.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, okay. Just call us when you get home. Can we give you a ride to the bus station?",
        "Liberty: I'm not going anywhere until we get these test results.",
        "Katie: You can't miss that much school.",
        "Liberty: Whoa, just 'cause you married my dad doesn't make you my mom. Look, I'll be okay. It's fine. Just -- I'll call you in a few days. Maybe, you know, it'll go quicker than they say.",
        "Brad: Fine.",
        "Katie: Where is she gonna stay while she's waiting? Does she have any money?",
        "Brad: She's a big girl. She's gonna be fine.",
        "Katie: She's a kid, Brad. She may not be yours, but she's someone's. I wouldn't want someone letting my kid just run off not knowing they're safe. Liberty, wait.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: What can I do for you, Emily?",
        "Emily: You know what you could do? You could tell your wife to stop going after me every chance she gets.",
        "Tom: Okay, look, if this is about Casey --",
        "Emily: No, it's just -- it's just not about Casey. It's the way Margo goes after me for everything up to and including global warming, and I am sick of it! She acts like -- like our affair was my fault and only mine.",
        "Tom: Well, I was there, Emily, and she blames me much more.",
        "Emily: Yeah, but she stopped. She stopped blaming you. With me, it never stops. And I'm tired. I refuse to apologize for a relationship that gave me my son.",
        "Tom: And no one expects you to. I think this is really more about Margo trying to protect Casey.",
        "Emily: Because that's worked so well for her in the past? You know what? You want a little free advice? If you don't want Margo smothering Casey to the point where he does something, anything, to break free, tell her to lay the hell off!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, where are you going to be staying while you're in town?",
        "Liberty: Why?",
        "Brad: Well, we just want to know. Do you have any friends or relatives here?",
        "Liberty: Just you.",
        "Brad: What's your mother's number?",
        "Liberty: I told you, I'm not going home.",
        "Brad: Either you call her or I'm gonna call every Janet Jaconi I can find, and then when I do reach her -- point made.",
        "Liberty: Hey, Mom, it's me. I just wanted to let you know I lost my phone, but I'm fine. Don't worry. And I'll talk to you later. Happy?",
        "Katie: That's it? That's all you're gonna say to your mom?",
        "Liberty: We don't talk much.",
        "Brad: Yeah, I remember that about your mother.",
        "Katie: Well, this doesn't solve the problem of where you're going to stay.",
        "Brad: The same place she did last night. So just --",
        "Liberty: Okay, I slept in the park.",
        "Katie: You what?",
        "Brad: What? Are you crazy? Do you know how dangerous that is?",
        "Liberty: I'm not stupid. I put my pack in a tree, and I slept where there were a lot of lights.",
        "Brad: She put her pack in a tree and slept where there were a lot of lights. Are you --?",
        "Katie: We can't let her sleep in a park.",
        "Brad: No way.",
        "Katie: We have no choice. We have to let her come home with us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Holden: Come in.",
        "Carly: What is this? My children playing a board game and not yelling? What is going on here?",
        "Holden: Pretty amazing, right? How's it going?",
        "Carly: Good, good. Parker's fine. He's with Jack now.",
        "Holden: That's good news, right?",
        "Carly: Yeah. All right, let me get these two out of your hair. Come on, guys.",
        "J.J.: No way. We're kicking their butts.",
        "Faith: Are not.",
        "Sage: Are too.",
        "Natalie: Just one more game.",
        "Holden: You know what? I think we'll have a war on our hands if you don't let them stay a little bit longer.",
        "Carly: Ah. I think that we've imposed upon you enough. Come on.",
        "Holden: Why don't you pull up a chair and play the game? Help speed it up a little bit.",
        "Sage: Please play, Mommy.",
        "Holden: Red or blue?",
        "Carly: Red. Red all the way.",
        "Holden: All right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: No, you don't. Sit up. Come on. You feeling all right?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Jack: If you're lightheaded, if you're dizzy, we got to go back to the hospital and they got to run some tests.",
        "Parker: And you and Mom can fight in the corridor again. Yeah, that's okay.",
        "Jack: Listen, about that. I was upset that your mom didn't call me when you were hurt, but it was wrong of me to raise my voice in a hospital. I'm sorry.",
        "Parker: It's not like you guys going at it is anything new.",
        "Jack: It's gotten that bad?",
        "Parker: Sage and J.J. and I are used to that, but it doesn't mean that we like it. Maybe you shouldn't come around so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey, did you finish up?",

        "Chris: \"Ah.\" When you've actually made it to a nursing class, then you get to argue with the doctor. Until then -- still nauseous? Numb? Okay, long enough. Elevated, but not too bad. You probably have that stomach flu that's going around.",

        "Margo: Well, you know, between him being held hostage and vegging on our couch, I know what my choice would be.",
        "Tom: Well, it's not that simple, and you know that. It's not like Emily has crazy judges breaking into her office every day of the week, and, besides, you're the one that said you thought Casey handled himself well under pressure.",
        "Margo: Well, he did. I was really proud of him.",

        "Margo: And we think that you're bright enough to consider those opinions when you make your own decision.",

        "Casey: Well, thanks, Mom. Cool.",
