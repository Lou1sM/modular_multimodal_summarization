        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: How's Parker?",
        "Jack: I thought I'd ask you the same thing.",
        "Carly: Well, he's not here. I assumed he was with you at the farm.",
        "Jack: He was. I thought he'd come back here after Liberty told him what she was going through with the annulment.",
        "Carly: How badly did that go?",
        "Jack: He trashed Emma's kitchen.",
        "Carly: No! You're kidding me!",
        "Jack: I wish I were.",
        "Carly: Oh, God! He must have been devastated! You let him leave like that?",
        "Jack: I didn't see it happen. I only saw the aftermath.",
        "Carly: Do you know where he could have gone?",
        "Jack: I thought I did. That's why I'm here. I've never seen him so angry and so upset.",
        "Carly: Liberty broke his heart. With a little help from us.",
        "Jack: Well, what's done is done. All we can do now is help him find a way to get through it.",
        "Carly: We have to find him first.",
        "Jack: Who are you calling?",
        "Carly: Craig.",
        "Jack: Since when does Craig always know where our son is when we don't?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Well, the boy leaves with a $50,000 check in his pocket and returns with a smile on his face.",
        "Parker: I also returned with a lot more than just that.",
        "Craig: What did you do, revitalize the technology sector all by yourself? Buy all your friends smart phones?",
        "Parker: No. Not even close.",
        "Craig: Well, don't keep me in suspense.",
        "Parker: I parked it in the garage.",
        "Craig: You what?",
        "Parker: I parked it in the garage. I couldn't leave a car like that out on the street, could I? You said it was my money.",
        "Craig: It is, or it was.",
        "Parker: And that I could spend it on whatever I wanted.",
        "Craig: Right again.",
        "Parker: So, I got what I wanted, and I think you'll be impressed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Parker would never go to Craig. He blames him more than anybody for breaking up his marriage.",
        "Carly: He blames us, too, and with good reason.",
        "Jack: Oh, don't give me that. We didn't manipulate Parker.",
        "Carly: Didn't we, by pretending that we were being supportive when we really wanted them to break up?",
        "Jack: Okay. If you think there's a chance that Parker is with Craig, call him. Fine. At this point, I'd negotiate with the devil if I had to.",
        "Carly: Well, look on the bright side. Maybe Parker went over there to yell at him.",
        "Jack: You think?",
        "Carly: Anything's possible.",
        "Jack: I'd pay to see that, actually.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Hi, Craig.",
        "Craig: Carly, what a nice surprise.",
        "Carly: I'm looking for Parker.",
        "Craig: Really? I happen to be looking at Parker. Just another way that we're connected.",
        "Carly: We're not. Is he okay?",
        "Craig: Well, he wasn't at his best earlier, but right now he seems to be doing very well, thanks to yours truly. You're welcome.",
        "Carly: Well, could you send him home, please? His father and I would like to have a word with him.",
        "Craig: Well, I don't have the right to give your son orders, as I've been told repeatedly, but I can convey the message.",
        "Carly: Does he need me to pick him up?",
        "Craig: No. I think the question of transportation is well taken care of.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Oh, my God!",
        "Holden: Are you all right?",
        "Lily: How can you ask that? You saw what they did to that poor policeman!",
        "Holden: All right. Don't think about it.",
        "Lily: Holden, he was just trying to protect me, and for that, he lost his life. The people that we're dealing with, they're not just kidnappers. They're killers!",
        "Holden: The boys, they're gonna be fine. As long as these kidnappers don't have the ransom money, nothing is gonna happen to them.",
        "Lily: He was so calm. If he could kill that officer without a second thought, what could he do to our son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: What have you done with my son?",
        "Zac: Calm down. Luke's doing fine. In fact, some might say that he's doing more than fine.",
        "Damian: What are you talking about?",
        "Zac: He's in very beautiful hands -- hands that know exactly what they're doing. Believe me, I can personally vouch for him.",
        "Damian: What is she doing to Luciano?",
        "Zac: Making a man of him. Aren't you the one who sent him to scared straight camp? You should be all smiles by now. She gets what she wants. You get what you want. Happy times all around.",
        "Damian: You have no idea what I want.",
        "Zac: I know you don't want to die. I got a gun this time. It's a lot more accurate than a knife.",
        "Damian: You're the one who stabbed me.",
        "Zac: So no sudden movements because this time I won't miss.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Please, please. Give him the medicine. You have to help him.",
        "Zoe: He's fine, Luciano, and as far as helping him out, I thought we agreed you're gonna help me out first.",
        "Luke: Stop it! Stop it! Are you crazy?",
        "Zoe: Let's call it crazy for you. Does that make you feel better?",
        "Luke: I am not gonna get you pregnant.",
        "Zoe: Your equipment works, doesn't it? It's the right time for me, so no worries.",
        "Luke: Do you really think that you can force me in to having sex with you?",
        "Zoe: Either you cooperate, Luke, or Noah doesn't get the medicine that he needs. That's a good boy. Good little baby-making boy.",
        "Luke: Do you really think you're gonna get away with this? Even if your plan does work, you're gonna get caught! You're gonna spend the rest of your life in jail! And even if you have your precious little Grimaldi, you're not gonna be able to raise him.",
        "Zoe: But you will, won't you, Luciano? You would never abandon your own son. And then he'll get the money, just like my mother should have.",
        "Luke: No, no. I can't do this. I can't do this. I won't.",
        "Zoe: Poor Noah. I thought you loved him.",
        "Luke: I do! You know I do!",
        "Zoe: Then it's simple. The quicker you give in, the faster he'll get the meds. Just trust me. Relax. Who knows? You might even enjoy it.",
        "Luke: Zoe, Zoe, no.",
        "[Luke grunts]",
        "Zoe: Help! Zac!",
        "Zac: Inside, now!",
        "Zoe: Zac! Zac, help!",
        "Zac: Let her go!",
        "Damian: Over there! Move away from them.",
        "Zoe: No! I'm not finished!",
        "Damian: Yes, you are. Away! Are you two okay?",
        "Noah: I'm fine.",
        "Luke: No, you're not! You're bleeding again!",
        "Damian: Did they hurt you?",
        "Luke: He's been shot!",
        "Damian: We'll get him to a hospital.",
        "Noah: I told you I'm fine.",
        "Luke: Noah! Noah!",
        "Damian: Untie them. You'd better pray you didn't hurt him too much. I knew it. When I saw that picture, I knew. I knew I've seen you before, Gia Pinnarossa.",
        "Zoe: This is all your fault! That money belonged to my mother! If you never would have given it to Luke, this wouldn't have happened in the first place!",
        "Luke: Noah, thank God.",
        "Margo: Everyone freeze! Police! Are you two okay?",
        "Luke: I'm fine. Noah needs a doctor!",
        "Margo: Well, thank God Casey told me about this place, which is more than I can say for you, Damian.",
        "Damian: My first stop was for my son.",
        "Margo: Yeah. Did you stop off to pick up a gun?",
        "Damian: I got this for the kidnappers.",
        "Margo: Why don't you hand that over to me.",
        "Luke: Margo, please! You need to call 911!",
        "Margo: It's okay. The ambulance is on its way. Cuff them. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey, Parker.",
        "Jack: Hey, Buddy. How you doing?",
        "Parker: Great.",
        "Jack: That's good to hear.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Are you hungry? I can get you something.",
        "Parker: No, thanks. I actually already had something at the Lakeview.",
        "Jack: Is that where you talked to Craig?",
        "Parker: Yeah.",
        "Jack: How'd that go?",
        "Parker: Amazing.",
        "Carly: Oh. Yeah. He said that you were doing better.",
        "Jack: He seemed to be telling the truth for a change.",
        "Parker: It's not like I'm over Liberty. That's never gonna happen.",
        "Jack: Everybody feels that way about their first love, Buddy. It's gonna get better, though. I promise.",
        "Parker: Right. But I started thinking about one of the reasons that I wanted to get married in the first place -- to get control of my trust fund.",
        "Jack: You know why that can't happen. Do you understand that?",
        "Carly: Not at 16, Honey.",
        "Parker: You didn't trust me.",
        "Jack: No. It's not that simple.",
        "Parker: All I ever wanted was the freedom to make my own choices, and I got that! I finally had some control over my own life for a change!",
        "Jack: Just what do you mean by control? Don't tell me that Craig gave you his keys.",
        "Parker: No. These are not Craig's keys. They're mine.",
        "Jack: He bought you a car?!",
        "Parker: No, no, no, no, no, no. No. He didn't buy it. I did. Come here. Check it out. It's parked right out front.",
        "Jack: Parker, the only car out here is a brand-new sports -- a sports car.",
        "Parker: I know.",
        "Carly: How could you possibly --",
        "Parker: My trust fund.",
        "Jack: That thing had to cost like $20,000, $30,000, Parker.",
        "Parker: Actually, Craig gave me $50,000, and he said I could spend it on whatever I wanted. He saw what I needed, and he made it happen. How great is that?",
        "Jack: I want you to stay here with your mother. I'll be right back.",
        "Carly: Jack! Jack! Don't do anything stupid!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Luke!",
        "Holden: Hey, Noah, it's good to have you home.",
        "Lily: How are you feeling? Luke told us what happened.",
        "Noah: I'm fine. Don't listen to him. He likes to make a fuss about everything.",
        "Luke: You just behave yourself, and let the doctor attend to you. How are you guys?",
        "Lily: Great now that you're back.",
        "Holden: Are you sure you're okay? You're not hurt or anything?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'm fine. Mom, they were threatening you so much.",
        "Lily: I'm fine.",
        "Holden: Yeah. No thanks to Damian.",
        "Lily: Never mind that. How was Noah? Is he gonna be all right?",
        "Luke: Well, apparently, they gunshot wound was infected, so he has to be on antibiotics. They're hoping they don't have to do a blood transfusion.",
        "Lily: Is there anything we can do?",
        "Luke: The doctor said they have it all under control. I just wish Noah didn't try to be a hero.",
        "Holden: What happened?",
        "Luke: He was protecting me, but, you know, I really don't want to get into it right now.",
        "Lily: Of course not. Not unless you want to.",
        "Holden: Yeah. That's fine. The important thing is you're okay and that Noah is going to be okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Damian: Yes, Margo?",
        "Margo: Damian, I need you down at the station right away.",
        "Damian: Something the matter?",
        "Margo: We'll discuss it when you get here.",
        "Damian: I'll be right there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Since you're things are gonna be okay with Noah, I'm gonna head down to the police station and see what's going on.",
        "Lily: I'm sure Margo has everything under control.",
        "Holden: I'm sure she does, too, but I'll sleep a lot better tonight knowing that those kidnappers are behind bars.",
        "Lily: I'll stay here with the boys. I'll call you if anything changes.",
        "Holden: Okay. Never, ever scare your mother like that again, okay?",
        "Luke: I won't.",
        "Holden: All right. I'll be back in a bit.",
        "Luke: You know, whenever he gets really scared, he puts it all on you.",
        "Lily: Luke, we were going out of our minds. Why don't we go out in the hall and give the doctor some space?",
        "Luke: Okay. Noah, we're gonna be out in the hall. You gonna be okay?",
        "Noah: I'll be fine. Doesn't look like I'm going anyplace anytime soon.",
        "Luke: I never thought I'd say this, but it feels so good to be in this hospital. Anything's better than that pit they kept us in.",
        "Lily: They're gonna pay for everything they put you through.",
        "Luke: Good.",
        "Lily: Luke, I didn't want to admit this, not even to myself, but there was a time when I didn't think we were all gonna get out of this in one piece.",
        "Luke: I knew something happened. What did they do to you?",
        "Lily: Damian figured out that Gia, or Zoe, whatever she calls herself, was the one that kidnapped you.",
        "Luke: She seems to think that she's the rightful heir to the Grimaldi fortune. Now, is she just crazy, or is there something to that?",
        "Lily: She did, through her mother. Damian figured out a way to trap her into making a mistake. Unfortunately, I got knocked out, and she ran away.",
        "Luke: Oh, my God. Mom, you could have really been --",
        "Lily: I wasn't. I wasn't, and I don't regret it because Damian was obviously on to something, and if it hadn't been for him, we wouldn't have figured out how or where to find you, Luke.",
        "Luke: If it hadn't been for Damian, I might not be here. If he hadn't showed up and somehow managed to get that gun away from Zac, I don't know what would have happened.",
        "Lily: I don't even want to think about that.",
        "Luke: You got knocked out. Damian could have gotten shot. You both risked your lives for me.",
        "Lily: We'd do it again in a second. You're our son, Luke. Protecting you is our job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: What's this about?",
        "Margo: I've been questioning the suspects.",
        "Damian: Well, they're more than suspects, Margo. You saw it yourself.",
        "Margo: Well, no. I didn't because I got there late because you didn't tell me where you were going. By the time I did get there, I found you standing over them with a gun.",
        "Damian: You need a statement from me? I'll tell you everything I know -- anything to put those two behind bars.",
        "Margo: Well, that's the thing, Damian. It's beginning to look more and more like you'll be joining them. They both swear that you're the one behind the whole thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: What do you think you're doing?",
        "Craig: Well, I was going to pay for my drink. I could walk away, but that would be just wrong.",
        "Jack: I'm not in the mood. Do you have any idea what thin ice you're on? Tell me about the car.",
        "Craig: Oh. You've seen Parker's new toy.",
        "Jack: Just how the hell is that supposed to be helping my son?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You wanted a car. Okay. What 16-year-old doesn't? But you also blame your dad and me for the end of your marriage, so you went out and you bought something you knew very well we didn't want you to have -- something that would make us worry every time we saw you behind the wheel. Are you still gonna tell me that I don't get it, that I don't get you?",
        "Parker: Not the way that Craig does. He did try to break up my marriage, too, but he realizes that he was wrong, and this is his apology.",
        "Carly: No, Parker! Buying you a car is not an apology! It's a bribe!",
        "Parker: So what? It's done! It's legal, and it's fantastic! It's mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: I have done nothing by trying to protect my son. How can you suggest that I would work with people who would try to hurt him?",
        "Margo: I'm just telling you what I was told, Damian, and, quite frankly, knowing you the way I do, it's not much of a stretch to believe that it's true.",
        "Damian: You can't be serious.",
        "Margo: Well, let's say that you regretted giving Luke the money or you weren't very happy with what he was doing with the foundation.",
        "Damian: Look, we've been through this before. All right, I am proud of what Luke has done with his foundation, and I don't need the money for myself. Besides, he wouldn't even know about Ana and Gia Pinnarossa if it weren't for me.",
        "Margo: Yes, and isn't that an incredibly convenient bit of knowledge, hmm?",
        "Damian: You're saying I made it up?",
        "Margo: No. I'm just saying that, you know, you're very determined when you want to go after something. How do we know that this Gia Pinnarossa even exists or that that girl in there we're holding is her or just someone that you hired?",
        "Damian: Are you thinking that I -- you know I have nothing to do with this! Damn you! Tell the truth! Tell the truth, or I'll choke it out of you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey, there.",
        "Noah: Hey, there, yourself.",
        "Luke: Listen, I should probably thank you for saving me from a fate worse than death, but next time, please, please don't try and be a hero.",
        "Noah: I didn't do that for you. I just couldn't stand to see the psycho slut with her hands all over my boyfriend.",
        "Luke: I love you.",
        "Noah: I love you, too.",
        "Lily: I see the patient has finally opened his eyes. Is there anything I can get you, Noah?",
        "Noah: You know, a new arm would be great if they have one out there.",
        "Lily: Actually, the doctor says your arm is going to be just fine. You're a very lucky young man, you know that?",
        "Noah: Yeah, I do.",
        "Lily: Ooh. I think that's my cue to give you guys some privacy.",
        "Noah: No, please. Don't. Don't feel like you have to leave.",
        "Lily: No, no. There are a lot of people out there that want to know that you boys are fine and doing well, so I better get started making all those calls. Take good care of each other.",
        "Noah: When are you gonna say it?",
        "Luke: I thought I already did.",
        "Noah: No. Not \"I love you.\"",
        "Luke: Then what?",
        "Noah: That I was right about your -- about Damian. He really came through for us.",
        "Luke: You're right. He did.",
        "Noah: So, what are you gonna do about it?",
        "Luke: I don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Damian! Damian, get a hold of yourself now or I book you for assault.",
        "Damian: Well, at least you'd be arresting me for something I actually did instead of listening to lies!",
        "Zac: I told you he was crazy. If you want me to testify against him, I'm gonna need protection.",
        "Zoe: Give it up, Cousin Damian. The plan didn't work.",
        "Damian: I had no plan!",
        "Zoe: I didn't want to do it, but he told me it was the best way to get the money that belonged to my mother. I never should have believed him.",
        "Damian: Shut your mouth, you little --",
        "Holden: What's going on?",
        "Damian: I'm being accused of planning the kidnapping.",
        "Holden: Well, if it's not true, then you have nothing to worry about.",
        "Damian: Lily. Lily saw the evidence. She can back me up. Please, call her. Get her down here as soon as possible.",
        "Holden: Sorry, Damian. No can do.",
        "Damian: Of course you can't. After everything I've done, why would you help me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We didn't raise Parker to believe that money was the answer to everything, Craig.",
        "Craig: No, it's not, but it can answer some of life's unpleasant questions.",
        "Jack: That's what you want to teach your kids, fine, but you keep your gospel according to Craig away from mine. Thank you.",
        "Craig: My parenting skills aren't the issue here.",
        "Jack: Oh, good, because they're even worse than I thought. I didn't think that was possible.",
        "Craig: I helped Parker because I felt it was the right thing to do.",
        "Jack: The right thing to do for you maybe, get on Parker's side and soften Carly up. You're so predictable, man.",
        "Craig: Carly and I are through. She told you that.",
        "Jack: Yeah. You asked her to marry you, and then she couldn't go through with it, and ever since, you've been sniffing around her no matter how many times she tells you to get lost. Can't help hoping she'll change her mind?",
        "Craig: No. I can't help but hope she'll realize how much better off she is without a self-righteous, judgmental jerk like you in her life. You know, if you were half, even half, the model of parenting perfection that you think you are, you might have a leg to stand on, but you have no one but yourself to blame for the mess that you've made of the relationship with your son.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm. Says the man who once attempted to kidnap his own daughter. That why she took off with little Johnny, do you think? She was afraid the same thing was gonna happen to him?",
        "Craig: I've had it with you and your family.",
        "Jack: Right. Until you get the itch to see Carly again.",
        "Craig: No. Not anymore.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder.",
        "Cop: We've got a homicide down at the docks.",
        "Jack: I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Are you kidding me? The two of them are actually accusing Damian of being involved in the kidnapping?",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Holden: Hey, it could be true for all we know.",
        "Lily: You sound like you want it to be true.",
        "Holden: Of course not, but we need to stay open to the possibility.",
        "Luke: No. Dad, there is no possibility. Damian wasn't in on this.",
        "Holden: All right. Then, fine. Margo needs to prove that.",
        "Luke: Well, I want to go down and talk to her.",
        "Holden: No, don't do that. Damian is with his lawyer, and they're trying to work it out. I'm sure he will work it out. He always does.",
        "Lily: I think Luke should go if he wants to.",
        "Luke: Will you tell Noah that I'll be right back?",
        "Holden: Why are you encouraging him?",
        "Lily: Why are you trying to stop him? He's just trying to help the man who saved his life.",
        "Holden: Yeah, the same man who put his life in jeopardy more than once. Lily, haven't we had enough of Damian's dramas?",
        "Lily: I think Luke needs to do what he thinks is right.",
        "Holden: Fine, but I'm not gonna let him do it alone.",
        "Lily: Holden. Holden, wait!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: The only reason why I came back to Oakdale is to reconcile with my son. Why is that so impossible for anyone to believe?",
        "Margo: It's not so impossible. It's just highly unlikely. Well, my, my, my. Isn't this interesting?",
        "Damian: What is it? Why is Luke here?",
        "Margo: I don't know. I'll find out. Luke, what can I do for you?",
        "Luke: You can let Damian go.",
        "Margo: No. I'm afraid that's not possible. According to your kidnappers, he's the mastermind behind this whole thing.",
        "Luke: Well, the kidnappers are lying. Zac and Zoe, or whatever her name is, worked alone without any help from Damian.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. How do you know that?",
        "Luke: Well, Zoe didn't exactly hide the fact that she hates Damian. She thinks he stole a portion of the Grimaldi inheritance that was supposed to go to her mother.",
        "Margo: Then maybe he coached her to deflect suspicion away from him.",
        "Luke: Well, why would they frame him by using Lakeview stationery? Why would they try to kill him?",
        "Margo: You mean the stabbing? Well, Luke, you told me yourself that maybe he hired someone to do that.",
        "Luke: I know. I've been distrustful of Damian since the moment he stepped into this town, but I was trapped with those people for days. There's no doubt in my mind that he didn't keep any secrets from us.",
        "Margo: Maybe that's because they never expected either of you to live to tell anyone.",
        "Luke: And that's how I know that Damian isn't involved. Zac and Zoe worked alone.",
        "Margo: Okay. Thanks, Luke. Would you like to talk to him?",
        "Luke: No, no. No, thank you.",
        "Lily: Are you sure?",
        "Holden: Its okay if you want to.",
        "Luke: The only thing I want to do right now is go back to Noah.",
        "Lily: You made the right decision.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: And don't think just because you have your own car the old rules don't apply. No driving anywhere without permission, and no driving at night without an adult. You understand me?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Jack, what happened?",
        "Jack: Nothing. Nothing's changed. It never does with Craig. Listen, I was hoping to come back to the house so we could finish our conversation with Parker, but I got called away on a case. I got to go check something out at the docks. I'll come by as soon as I can.",
        "Carly: I have to get to work, but if you want to come by and talk to Parker alone when you're through with your business, be my guest. But I'm warning you, I don't think you're gonna get anywhere. I have to get to metro. You can make yourself a sandwich, or, if you have any money left over after buying that car, you could spring for a pizza.",
        "Parker: Mom, the car, it's not -- you and dad were wrong about me and Liberty, and, yeah, I'm mad about that, but the car, it's -- it's a really sweet car.",
        "Carly: Just make sure that it's sweet and safe, okay? Where are they? I just had them.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Carly: My keys. I had them earlier.",
        "Parker: Mom?",
        "Carly: Yes?",
        "Parker: Why don't we take my car?",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Don't you even think about it?",
        "Parker: I was just trying to be nice.",
        "Carly: No. You're trying to soften me up. I don't like what you did, and giving me a ride in your fancy car is not gonna change anything.",
        "Parker: Oh, come on. The weather's great. I could put down the top. You would feel the wind in your hair.",
        "Carly: I said no. Is it really a convertible?",
        "Parker: It really is.",
        "Carly: Oh, what the heck. Okay. Just don't tell your father, all right?",
        "Parker: Sure. It goes from 0 to 60 in less than 6 seconds and has a top speed of 150 miles per hour.",
        "Carly: No one is going 150 miles an hour in this car, young man! No one!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: The victim's over here, Detective.",
        "Jack: I know this guy.",
        "Carly: Well, look who's here, the man who put my 16-year-old son behind the wheel of a sports car.",
        "Craig: Not now, Carly. I'm not in the mood.",
        "Carly: I don't care about your mood. You are going to hear me out.",
        "Craig: No, I'm not. I've taken all I'm gonna take from you and from Jack.",
        "Carly: Well, I don't know what Jack said to you, but whatever it was, I'm sure you deserved it.",
        "Craig: For helping a young man that I've been close to since he was a child? Well, no longer. I'm done.",
        "Carly: Good! So I guess you finally realized that you can't weigh in on Parker's life whenever you get a parental urge.",
        "Craig: I mean I'm done with you, Carly. You've pushed me away so many times, I've lost count. Well, congratulations. You've won. Consider me pushed.",
        "Carly: What is the matter with you? Why are you acting like this?",
        "Craig: Because I've taken enough! I'm so busy fighting everyone else in this town. I'm done fighting with you, too. You're so anxious to be rid of me? I'm gonna give you exactly what you want.",
        "Carly: A check? What exactly is this supposed to mean?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Would you reread this statement one more time and make sure everything is there?",
        "Damian: Gladly. I want to make sure those two get what they deserve.",
        "Lily: We should be going.",
        "Holden: You know what? Why don't you go along without me? I need to talk to Damian.",
        "Lily: Holden --",
        "Holden: Lily. Lily, it'll be okay. I promise.",
        "Lily: All right. I'll see you back at the hospital.",
        "Holden: Damian, wait. I owe you an apology.",
        "Damian: So you finally believe I had nothing to do with the kidnapping?",
        "Holden: Yes, and I am very grateful for everything you did to rescue Luke and Noah. I just wish you would have done it without putting Lily at risk.",
        "Damian: Well, if you hadn't interfered -- I'm sorry. I had no right to put your wife in danger.",
        "Holden: Apology accepted. Maybe if I hadn't taken such a hard line, Lily would have confided in me about your plan. I'm partly to blame for not giving you the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Damian: Well, I've given you enough reason over the years not to trust me, but I would never do anything to hurt Luke or Lily. I hope over time I will be able to convince you that I've changed.",
        "Holden: Maybe there's a way to do that. I have a suggestion.",
        "Damian: What is it?",
        "Holden: Leave Oakdale.",
        "Damian: Leave?",
        "Holden: Yes. I know that it's not deliberate, but your presence here, it puts people that we care about at risk.",
        "Damian: I understand.",
        "Margo: We'll send your statement over to the D.A.'s office. I'm not sure if you'll be called for trial or not, but keep yourself available.",
        "Damian: I will. But if I'm required to return, allow time for me to make travel arrangements. I'm leaving town as soon as possible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: So, I told Margo that Damian had nothing to do with the kidnapping.",
        "Noah: I can't believe she believed a word Zac or Zoe said.",
        "Luke: Well, I can. I mean, think about it, Noah. Those two are expert pretenders. Their whole life was an act.",
        "Noah: That's true.",
        "Luke: And with all the suspicions I had about Damian, you know, you can't blame Margo for hers.",
        "Noah: I'll bet he was happy you stood up for him.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Noah: You guess? What did he say when you went to bat?",
        "Luke: Oh, I didn't. I just told Margo what I knew and left.",
        "Noah: Without talking to Damian at all?",
        "Luke: Well, what am I supposed to say to him? I mean, I don't know what kind of relationship we can have, if any at all, so -- Noah. I can hear you thinking. What?",
        "Noah: I think before you start worrying about where things could lead, you should get to know him better.",
        "Luke: Why?",
        "Noah: You're never gonna get to know Damian. I mean, who he is, what he is, who you are. That whole side of the family, I mean, if you don't try, everything that's happened to us the past couple of weeks is telling you that. Maybe you should listen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Everything okay?",
        "Holden: Everything's fine.",
        "Luke: So, Mom told me that you stayed to talk to Damian.",
        "Holden: I did. I suggested that now that you and Noah are back home safe that it might be best for everyone, including Damian, that he leave.",
        "Luke: What did he say?",
        "Holden: He agreed.",
        "Lily: When is he leaving?",
        "Holden: He told Margo as soon as possible. So I think we've seen the last of Damian Grimaldi, unless either one of you can think of a reason for him to stay.",
        "Lily: He doesn't need to stay on my account.",
        "Holden: Well, good. Then it's settled. I think I might head home, check on Ethan and the girls. I'll see both of you back at the house. I can't tell you how happy I am to say that.",
        "Lily: I should get going, too, soon, unless you want me to wait with you while you're waiting to hear how Noah's doing.",
        "Luke: Oh, no. We'll be fine. Mom, you think dad's right? Do you think Damian should leave?",
        "Lily: Maybe it's for the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Are you gonna explain this?",
        "Craig: I'm buying you out of midnight sun, Carly. You're the one who didn't think we should even work together anymore. I'm just finally taking you at your word.",
        "Carly: Yes, well, I don't think we belong together, not as a couple. But as business partners, you know, maybe you should rethink this.",
        "Craig: No. I've already thought it through.",
        "Carly: Well, so have I. Craig, I know what I said in the beginning, but I've put a lot of effort into this company. I don't think I should walk away now when it looks like we might actually turn a profit.",
        "Craig: Well, nothing in life is certain, Carly, least of all making a profit in business. I think the figure I've assigned your share is more than equitable.",
        "Carly: What if I don't want it?",
        "Craig: It's better this way. I've also subtracted the $200,000 I loaned you, so you can wash your hands of me, and I can wash my hands of you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Name is Cesar. Cesar something. I ran in to him when I was looking for Parker.",
        "Cop: A witness saw him stop the boat from leaving.",
        "Jack: Any idea why he was killed?",
        "Cop: These might have something to do with it.",
        "Jack: M-16s?",
        "Cop: Yeah. They're hidden under some vodka bottles.",
        "Jack: Midnight Sun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Damian.",
        "Damian: Lily. Something wrong? Everything all right?",
        "Lily: Everything's fine, Damian.",
        "Damian: Does Holden know you're here?",
        "Lily: Not yet, but he will.",
        "Damian: Of course.",
        "Lily: I couldn't let you leave without saying good-bye, after what you did for Luke.",
        "Damian: I did what any other father would have done.",
        "Lily: That's just what I told Luke.",
        "Damian: I'm glad. You know, it's for the best that I leave. It was my family that caused all of this, and, Lily, I will never forgive myself for putting you in danger.",
        "Lily: You have to know that nothing that happened was your fault, and I'm sorry that we all misjudged you so badly for so long.",
        "Damian: Don't apologize. I understand why Holden and Luke felt the way they did. I know I can never change the mistakes I made in the past.",
        "Lily: None of us can.",
        "Damian: Yeah, but you must admit that my mistakes have done a lot of damage to you and your family. I just hope that one day I can win Luke's forgiveness.",
        "Lily: I hope so, too.",
        "Damian: Will you let me know how Luke is doing? I don't mean to spy on him or anything.",
        "Lily: I'll talk to Holden about it.",
        "Damian: Of course. I'm so proud of our son.",
        "Lily: I wish he could hear you say that. He pretends that your opinion doesn't matter, but I know it does.",
        "Damian: Whatever our son does with his life, whoever he becomes, he will always mean the world to me, as will you. Who's there?",
        "Luke: Oh, it's me. The maid let me in when she left. I guess having a mom who's part owner of the hotel has its perks, huh?",
        "Damian: Indeed. What can I do for you?",
        "Luke: I don't know how to say this. I don't really even know what it is I want.",
        "Damian: Anything you need, I will give you. You have only to ask.",
        "Luke: I've just realized that I don't know you. I mean, I know the DNA. I know the name. I know the history. But I don't know you.",
        "Damian: You know, I find myself in a similar situation where you're concerned.",
        "Luke: And I don't know what kind of relationship we can have. I don't know if we're even capable of one.",
        "Damian: What is it you want?",
        "Luke: All I know is this -- I'm not ready for you to leave my life.",
        "Damian: Well, then I won't. I'll stay here in Oakdale for as long as you like.",
        "Luke: Okay. I should probably get back to Noah.",
        "Damian: He's a very lucky boy.",
        "Luke: So am I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: They're back. They're safe and sound, Mama. Noah was injured, so he's at the hospital. He's getting checked out. But the boys, they should be home very soon. Yeah. I'm sure an apple pie would be great. Or pecan. That would work, too. All right, I will. Bye-bye. Mama is very relieved.",
        "Lily: I gathered. How many pies is she making?",
        "Holden: I think I was able to keep her down to two. You know, I went over to Lucinda's, and I checked on Ethan and the girls, and they're all fine.",
        "Lily: I know. I called, too.",
        "Holden: I'm so happy that they had no idea what was going on.",
        "Lily: Mother clamped down on the TV and the internet just to make sure there weren't any accidents.",
        "Holden: I'm surprised you're back so soon. I thought you were gonna stay at the house for a while.",
        "Lily: Actually, I stopped by the Lakeview to say good-bye to Damian. I hope you don't have a problem with that.",
        "Holden: I'm certainly not gonna pretend that I'm sorry to see him go, but I am happy that you went and said good-bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't see why you're in such a hurry. We should talk about this.",
        "Craig: I'm not negotiating with you, Carly. You can either take the check from me now or you can take it from my lawyer later.",
        "Carly: You don't mean that.",
        "Craig: Okay. Lawyer it is. I'll have him call you.",
        "Carly: Wait. Craig, obviously I can't make you be my partner.",
        "Craig: Good. So you'll be reasonable about this.",
        "Carly: But you do have to admit we do work extremely well together.",
        "Craig: That we do.",
        "Carly: It seems a shame to let that go to waste.",
        "Craig: No. The shame is letting a good proposition like this become as tortured as everything else. Take the money and move on, Carly. I intend to. What? What do you think you could possibly say to me to make me change my mind? Oh, Jack. What joy. Listen, if you're here to reprise the Parker song and dance, you can save it. You and Carly can yell at each other all you want, but I'm out of it.",
        "Jack: This isn't about Parker. It's an official visit.",
        "Carly: Official how?",
        "Jack: I'm afraid you're both gonna have to come with me. I'm bringing you in for questioning.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Janet: I never said she was in trouble, Parker.",
        "Parker: You wouldn't be here if she wasn't.",
        "Janet: It has something to do with her vodka company.",
        "Parker: That's bad.",
        "Carly: How did that get in there?",
        "Jack: That's what we'd like to know.",
        "Dusty: You knew he'd take the fall if things went wrong.",
        "Lucy: But not for murder. I can't let him take the blame for that.",
        "Jack: This could be your last chance. Think about what it'll do to the kids if you let Craig Montgomery take you down with him."
