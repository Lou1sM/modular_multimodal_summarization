        "Luke: Is that from Katie?",
        "Reid: Yeah. Because my rent is due. She and the baby are having dinner with Nancy Hughes.",
        "Luke: Ah. Well, I was just gonna say hi, so I guess I should get going.",
        "Reid: Ah, where you got to go? Got another awards banquet to run off to?",
        "Luke: You mean for my multimillion-dollar foundation? Uh, no, I -- I think I am caught up. Why?",
        "Reid: Well, I figure I owe you for helping me meet the medical board and saving my career. So what do you say? Pizza and a beer, we're even?",
        "Luke: [Laughs] You're so generous. Uh, I don't drink.",
        "Reid: All right, forget the beer. I'll throw in watching the game instead.",
        "Luke: Look, that's nice, but I -- I think I'll pass. You really don't owe me anything.",
        "Reid: And if you leave now, we can go back to being Dr. Oliver and Mr. Snyder, and we don't have to talk about that kiss. Is that the idea?",
        "Luke: Well, there's nothing to talk about. A kiss is just a kiss.",
        "Reid: Don't worry, Luke. It won't happen again -- unless you want it to.",
        "Luke: Pizza sounds good.",
        "Reid: Pizza it is.",

        "Faith: You talked to Craig about your trust fund?",
        "Parker: Well, I couldn't find him, but I know he's been stealing from it, him and Gabriel.",
        "Faith: Gabriel? Are you sure about that? I mean, he --",
        "Parker: He did it. He did it. I had it out with him, and he admitted it to me.",
        "Faith: He seemed like such a nice guy.",
        "Parker: Because he covered up your drug use? That's not being nice. That's not being your friend. The guy's scum.",
        "Faith: You're really mad at him, huh?",
        "Parker: Would you be?",
        "Faith: So, what are you gonna do? Try and get Craig to give you your money back?",
        "Parker: What money? They've probably got it hidden in some tropical island somewhere. I'm gonna go to the police.",
        "Faith: Are you sure you should?",
        "Parker: My aunt gave me the money, and they stole it, so they should be in jail. Hey, where are you going? You're gonna go warn your friend Gabriel?",
        "Faith: I'm going with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: If Ellis lost all your money, how can you afford to take me to dinner?",
        "Craig: Things aren't so dire that I can't spring for dinner.",
        "Carly: They're not?",
        "Craig: I'll find the money to bring the company back.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Craig: As long as you've known me, haven't I always managed to come out on top?",
        "Carly: And no matter who you've had to stomp on to get there.",
        "Craig: Thank you. Just trust me when I tell you that I will scrounge up enough money to bring Monte Carlo back.",
        "Carly: Legally? Ethically?",
        "Craig: Oh, I am turning over a new leaf. No more bad behavior, and no more bad financial reports. How many second chances have I offered you? Can't you spare me at least one?",
        "Carly: Where are we going to eat?",
        "Craig: Oh, I -- I say Chicago, someplace classy, expensive.",
        "Carly: Just don't get any ideas. It's just dinner. And what happened earlier was a mistake.",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah, I know. Your heart belongs to Jack.",
        "Carly: Also, I don't believe really that we're gonna get this business back on track because my luck doesn't work that way.",
        "Craig: Well, this time you're wrong. Go do what you have to do to get ready. I'll make a reservation. And we'll dine while Monte Carlo burns.",

        "Lily: Should I call Gabriel and ask him to come over here?",
        "Lucinda: Why would you do that?",
        "Lily: To try to make things up to him.",
        "Lucinda: But we haven't harmed him.",
        "Lily: Well, to ask him how he feels about all of this, what he plans to do about Craig.",
        "Lucinda: We know how -- what he feels about this. He wanted to find his father. He has now found his father. And if he's got any standards whatsoever, he can't bear him. And what he plans to do about that, that's -- that's none of our business.",
        "Lily: Mother, we made it our business when we conspired with Sierra to keep this whole thing a secret.",
        "Lucinda: Well, the secret's out, so it's no longer our responsibility.",
        "Lily: His mother is dead.",
        "Lucinda: And that's supposed to matter?",
        "Lily: Lidia can't tell him why he wasn't allowed to know Craig was his father. We can.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, I'm telling you, it's better for everyone involved if we stay out of this.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] You know, when Gabriel was a little boy growing up in Montega, I could pretend it didn't matter that -- that none of this happened, but it did. It does! He's here!",
        "Lucinda: What are you doing?",
        "Lily: I'm gonna call Craig. I am going to tell him the truth -- something we should have done a long time ago.",
        "Lucinda: Lily, give me the phone.",
        "Lily: Craig has a right to know that boy is his son.",
        "Lucinda: You speak to me about the rights of Craig Montgomery, the guy who cheated on my daughter and multiple nefarious crimes, including stealing my company from me?",
        "Lily: We are talking about his son! By not telling him the truth, we have denied Craig the chance to be a father to that boy.",
        "Lucinda: Tell me why I should give a damn?",
        "Lily: Well, what do you care about?",
        "Lucinda: I care about the promise we gave, that Sierra gave to the mother.",
        "Lily: Oh, and I'm supposed to be bound to that promise for the rest of my life?",
        "Lucinda: Does her death nullify her -- her right to dignity, to privacy, and to protect her own son?",
        "Lily: [Scoffs] Of course you would see it that way. Hide the truth at all costs. I mean, after all, that's what you've done to me my whole life! If it were up to you, I'd never know that Iva was my biological mother.",
        "Lucinda: And I was wrong.",
        "Lily: And you're wrong about this.",
        "Lucinda: You're misunderstanding me, Darling. You see, I -- I kind of knew that Iva was a good person, and my deepest fear was that I would lose you to her.",
        "Lily: Mother, your fears were unfounded. What if Lidia was wrong about Craig? You, me, Sierra -- what if we were all wrong?",
        "Lucinda: But, Darling, there's more to it than all of that. You see, I think that it has enriched your life, actually, to know that Iva was your birth mother. Now, what will this boy get from knowing that Craig is his father?",
        "Lily: I don't know.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I can tell you. I -- let me edify you, Darling. He'll -- he'll ingratiate himself. He'll smarm around on the kid. He'll do -- glad hand -- anything he can do until he's got the kid. And then he'll do what he does every time when someone makes the mistake of loving him. He'll use him and disappoint him and hurt him.",
        "Lily: Mother, you can't see the future. You can't be sure of that.",
        "Lucinda: Well, let me tell you, Craig's firstborn son would confirm what I say. Only he can't, because poor Bryant's dead.",

        "Parker: I -- I'd like to file charges against someone.",
        "Margo: Someone? Who?",
        "Faith: You're probably busy. If you want to dump us on somebody else, that'd be okay.",
        "Margo: No, no. I have all the time in the world for you two. What's the problem?",
        "Parker: I got ripped off.",
        "Margo: Okay. Well, um, I will get some forms, and then you can get --",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Margo: Sorry. Hold on. Excuse me. Hughes. What? O'Neal, I can hardly hear you. A fire? All right, what is the address? 256 River Front Drive. All right, was there anyone in the building? Oh, you're right, it is after hours. All right, all right, all right. I'll -- I'm on it. I will tell the commissioner, and I will meet you there. I'm so sorry, guys. I got to take this one. But I'll have someone take your, uh, information in the interrogation room, okay? Sorry.",
        "Parker: We've got to go.",
        "Faith: Where?",
        "Parker: That building that's on fire -- that's where my mom and Craig have their office. And I've got to get there right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Oh, good. There you are. I have a reservation. We have to get going if we're gonna make it.",
        "Carly: Okay, all right. I'm just gonna leave a note for Parker to let him know where I am and what he should make for supper. Okay.",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Carly: There. All set -- take it easy! I'm ready.",
        "Craig: Good, great. Let's get moving.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Hello. Yeah, this is Carly Tenney. No, not -- we left the office for the day. We just have the one employee. He shouldn't be there either. Really? Um, okay. Well, we're on our way right now. Thank you.",
        "Craig: What is it?",
        "Carly: That was the security company. Our office building is on fire.",
        "Craig: You're kidding? What happened?",
        "Carly: No -- nobody seems to know. Let's go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Looks like your cable's out.",
        "Reid: Yeah. Sorry about the game.",
        "Luke: Yeah. I'm sure you are.",
        "Reid: Hey, I like baseball.",
        "Luke: I know something that you like more.",
        "Reid: Brain surgery?",
        "Luke: More than that.",
        "Reid: What's that?",
        "Luke: Not talking. You live for not talking.",
        "Reid: I like to talk. I just don't do small talk. It's a waste of time.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but this means you'd have to be civil -- at least until the pizza came.",
        "Reid: Hey, I haven't said anything insulting to you for at least 48 hours.",
        "Luke: Yeah. What happened?",
        "Reid: Well, you get enough of that from Noah. It's not fair to pile on. Want something to drink?",
        "Luke: Soda's fine. And, you know, you're wrong. Noah and I are okay.",
        "Reid: He kicked you out. Do you call that okay?",
        "Luke: If that's what he needs.",
        "Reid: No, what he needs is to learn some gratitude.",
        "Luke: You think I want Noah to give me --",
        "Reid: You know he's still punishing you for his accident.",
        "Luke: But it was my fault. He -- he was messing with fireworks. I was distracting him. If he was totally focused on that instead of me --",
        "Reid: Everything you've done since then doesn't matter? Getting him into rehab, kidnapping the finest neurosurgeon in the country to do his surgery?",
        "Luke: Full of yourself much?",
        "Reid: I'm just saying, for him to keep dumping on you after everything you've done for him -- frankly, it's rude.",
        "Luke: You're not blind, and you're rude. What's your excuse?",
        "Reid: Why are you sticking up for him?",
        "Luke: Because you're talking trash about him.",
        "Reid: I'm just speaking the truth. It's time somebody stuck up for you.",
        "Luke: I'm fine.",
        "Reid: Noah's blaming you. You're letting him. You guys are both idiots.",
        "Luke: And now you're back to insulting me. You know, I knew it.",
        "Reid: Accidents happen. They're not always somebody's fault. It's not okay for Noah to beat up on you, calling the shots while you put your life on hold, waiting for him to come around. Aren't you sick of that yet? You sure as hell should be.",

        "Carly: What happened, Margo?",
        "Margo: Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know that was your building till I already got here. I'm sorry.",
        "Craig: So it's bad?",
        "Margo: Yeah, it looks like it is.",
        "Craig: Thank God we were done for the day. Do you have any idea how it started?",
        "Margo: It's too soon to know anything for sure. Come on, let's talk to the fire chief.",
        "Craig: Okay. Carly, you coming?",
        "Carly: I'll catch up with you.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Carly: What are you two doing here?",
        "Parker: We heard about the fire.",
        "Carly: Is it on the news already?",
        "Faith: Actually --",
        "Parker: Did they get everybody out of the building?",
        "Carly: The building's empty.",
        "Parker: How do they know?",
        "Carly: I told them. We're the only tenants right now.",
        "Parker: But did the firemen actually check?",
        "Carly: I assume they did, yeah.",
        "Parker: Well, they need to check again, mom.",
        "Carly: I'm sure they're doing their job, Parker. What is the problem?",
        "Parker: Well, I'm going in there myself.",
        "Faith: Parker, stop!",
        "Carly: What the hell are you doing?!",
        "[Fire alarm blaring]",
        "Fireman: Anyone in here? Room's clear. Heading down to two.",
        "Parker: You know, there might be somebody in there that we don't know about. I have to go in and check.",
        "Carly: You are not going in there.",
        "Parker: But Mom --",
        "Carly: You are not going in that building! Just get away from it! Take Faith and move farther back.",
        "Parker: All right, but at least --",
        "Carly: Just go! It's too dangerous here to argue!",
        "[Sirens wailing]",
        "Carly: How bad is it?",
        "Craig: We couldn't get any information from the fire chief.",
        "Margo: Do either of you have any idea how this might have started?",
        "Carly: I -- I don't know what you mean. Do you mean did we leave a coffee machine on or something?",
        "Craig: No, no, absolutely not.",
        "Carly: The office is barely set up. Most of the supplies are still in boxes.",
        "Craig: Well, there is one possibility.",
        "Margo: What? What's that?",
        "Craig: There could have been an electrical fire.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig, this is not Gabriel's fault.",
        "Craig: We don't know that yet.",
        "Margo: Wha -- who's Gabriel?",
        "Craig: He's this kid that Carly hired. You know, I did say we should get a licensed electrician.",
        "Carly: He seemed to know what he was doing. He's an okay kid. Craig just doesn't like him. You can't blame everything on Gabriel.",
        "Margo: Well, the insurance company will insist on a full investigation, so don't worry. They'll find out what happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Craig made mistakes with Bryant. He'd be the first one to admit that.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. And with his only daughter, who's --",
        "Lily: Craig is a better man now.",
        "Lucinda: Oh? What proof do we have of that?",
        "Lily: Johnny. He loves that little boy with all his heart.",
        "Lucinda: [Sighs] He broke every kind of law to get possession of that poor little boy, including almost killing Rosanna Cabot.",
        "Lily: He was never convicted of that.",
        "Lucinda: And he badgered the poor little boy's mother to an early grave.",
        "Lily: What are we gonna do when that boy shows up at my doorstep, asking questions about Craig and the deal we all made? What do we do then?",
        "Lucinda: Why would he do that?",
        "Lily: Well, he's gonna want some sort of explanation.",
        "Lucinda: Why would he come to you? Oh, Honey, for heaven's sake. Look, he wanted to find out about Craig. He found out about him, obviously, because he got a job in Monte Carlo. That means the kid had an agenda. Let's let him have it.",
        "Lily: Yeah, well, he probably thinks that Craig deserted him, I mean, when the truth is Craig didn't even know he existed.",
        "Lucinda: And if he wants to leave town without telling anybody, isn't that his choice?",
        "Lily: What if he does tell Craig?",
        "Lucinda: I think we can act as surprised as anybody else. [Chuckles] Because let me tell you, Honey, if Craig finds out that we had a secret and we kept a secret son from him, oh, all hell will break loose.",

        "Reid: What? You're leaving? Where are you going?",
        "Luke: I don't want to discuss my relationship with Noah.",
        "Reid: Okay, fine. We don't have to talk about it. We can talk about something else. We can talk about your foundation, how the Cubs suck almost as much as the Astros, our kiss. What?",
        "Luke: Well, now I'm the one that doesn't want to talk.",
        "Reid: It's 'cause you liked it.",
        "Luke: There could be a lot of reasons for that, like it's been a long time.",
        "Reid: Yeah.",
        "Luke: And, uh -- being wanted by someone like you, it's a compliment.",
        "Reid: Yes, it is. And --",

        "Luke: Saved by the bell.",
        "Reid: This guy is getting a lousy tip.",

        "Noah: Luke?",
        "Luke: Noah, Noah, hi. Uh, we just got back from Texas. Good news. He's been reinstated.",
        "Noah: [Sighs] That's a relief, considering my surgery's scheduled for tomorrow.",
        "Luke: It is? Oh, wow. I just had no idea. Well, I'll be thinking about you.",
        "Noah: Thanks.",
        "Luke: But you wanted to talk to Reid.",
        "Noah: [Scoffs] It's Reid now?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Um, can you just wait a couple seconds?",
        "Noah: You know what, Luke? Uh, don't worry about it. It's, um -- it's not a big deal. I was just, uh, checking in. Um, he doesn't have to call me back.",
        "Reid: Who was it?",
        "Luke: Noah. You didn't tell me his surgery is tomorrow.",
        "Reid: No, I didn't. You want to get some plates.",
        "Luke: No, I want to know what kind of game you're playing.",

        "Faith: Why did you try to get to the fire like that? You scared me.",

        "Faith: Where are you --?",
        "Parker: Stay here, please. Hi. Are you sure that there was nobody in that building?",
        "Fireman: We looked.",
        "Parker: Okay, because I thought I saw somebody in a window on the third floor, okay? I know it sounds crazy, but it was that window right there. My friend saw it, too.",
        "Fireman: Anybody's up there, we'll find them.",
        "Faith: You didn't see anyone in the window. What's going on? Are you getting one of these feelings you used to get?",
        "Parker: Yeah. A bad one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Is the fire out?",
        "Craig: Hot spots keep popping up.",
        "Carly: If it was just smoke damage, we could salvage something. But it's more than that, isn't it?",
        "Craig: I'm afraid so.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig, it was bad enough when we lost all that money and we knew it couldn't go forward. Now if we lose all those designs, all the samples, all that work --",
        "Craig: I know. It's just -- just devastating. But at least the insurance is paid up.",
        "Carly: How much is the building insured for?",
        "Craig: Actually, I'm not really sure, but it -- it might be enough to rebuild the company.",
        "Carly: I'm just so glad no one was hurt.",
        "Margo: They found someone in the building!",
        "Carly: Craig!",
        "Faith: Oh, my God, Gabriel!",
        "Parker: Is he gonna be okay?",
        "EMT: I don't know, kid. We got to get him to the hospital.",
        "Faith: You knew he was in there, didn't you?",
        "Parker: I never thought something like this was gonna happen.",
        "Carly: That's Gabriel Caras.",
        "Margo: The electrician you told me about?",
        "Carly: We had no idea he was in the building.",
        "Margo: Did he have a key to the office?",
        "Carly: Yeah. I gave him one. Maybe he was here, catching up on some work or picking something up.",
        "Craig: Had no business being in there.",

        "Carly: I don't know. He didn't say anything to me about parents or anything. Has he said anything to you?",
        "Margo: Craig?",

        "Carly: I -- I don't see Parker. I'm gonna look for him, okay?",
        "Margo: All right, all right. I can get what I need from Craig. You go take care of your son.",
        "Faith: Did you do something to Gabriel before the fire?",
        "Parker: No, no, no, no. No, no way.",
        "Faith: But you were talking about getting back at him and Craig.",
        "Parker: Yes, I meant through the police.",
        "Faith: Then how did you know Gabriel was in there? Parker, answer me!",
        "Parker: Okay. I -- I went to the office to find Craig to find out what was going on, but Gabriel was there, and we got into a fight. I accused him of stealing my money.",
        "Faith: And what did he say?",
        "Parker: He said that it wasn't him, that it was Craig.",
        "Faith: So then what, you left?",
        "Parker: No, he got in my face, so I shoved him.",
        "Faith: You shoved him?",
        "Parker: No, I -- I punched him. And he fell, and he hit his head, and he knocked himself out.",
        "Faith: Parker!",
        "Parker: I checked to see if he was okay, and he was! He was still breathing. And then I took off.",
        "Faith: And what about the fire?",
        "Parker: I had nothing to do with that.",

        "Faith: But you didn't.",

        "Luke: Yeah, but when did you plan this? You must have been talking about it with him while we were in Texas.",
        "Reid: I'm not discussing my patient with you.",
        "Luke: We were just talking about Noah. You brought him up.",
        "Reid: We weren't talking about his medical care.",

        "Reid: Yeah, that -- that about sums it up. It's called doctor/patient privilege.",
        "Luke: Well, that is not what this is about, and you know it. You didn't want to tell me about Noah's surgery because you knew that I would go straight to him and see him through it.",
        "Reid: You're acting like I'm the only one who knew the time and date of this surgery. Noah knew. Did he -- did he call you? Did he ask for your loving support?",
        "Luke: No. But that's probably because he knew that I was in Texas with you and thought that you would tell me. But no, you were too busy trying to work me, trying to start something with me.",
        "Reid: I thought we were starting something together.",
        "Luke: You know, and I think that's a conflict of interest.",
        "Reid: What is my sinister plan, huh? Keep him blind so he'll need you? Restore his sight so he wants you back?",
        "Luke: Who knows? Who knows what you think. Because one minute, you're this pompous ass, and then the next minute, you're kissing me and making me feel like --",

        "Carly: In reference to what?",

        "Lucinda: He had Bryant. Bryant was only 20 when he died. Cute. So stubborn. So impertinent.",
        "Lily: Like you?",
        "Lucinda: Uh, no, 'cause I was never as cute as he was. But, um, he trusted Craig, and look what happened. Got in that car, and that was that. He never lived to learn anything from that mistake.",
        "Lily: Don't you think that Craig has changed, that given the second chance he'd do things differently?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Sweetheart, you don't know that. You really don't know that. And if you tell Craig, you're just risking Gabriel, the kid's anonymity and his happiness to assuage your own sense of guilt.",
        "Lily: Maybe you're right, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: I am.",
        "Lily: I mean, maybe we should just wait to see what happens. If Gabriel tells Craig himself, then we really don't have to say anything.",

        "Faith: I like him. But there's some people that don't.",
        "Lucinda: With cause?",
        "Faith: Yeah. He can kind of show off. He acts tough. You know the type.",
