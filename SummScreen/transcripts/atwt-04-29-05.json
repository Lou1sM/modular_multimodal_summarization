        "Carly: You were right, Jack. It is good to get out.",
        "Jack: That house has so many reminders of what happened with Les. I figured getting away for a while would only do you some good.",
        "Carly: And what I need is time with you. It doesn't matter where. Although, I will say it is nice to be out among people, happiness and laughter.",
        "[Glass crashes] [Carly screams] Whoa. I guess I'm a little jittery.",
        "Jack: Honey, you had a pretty big shake up. You don't have to downplay it for me.",
        "Carly: I'm not downplaying anything. You're making a big deal of it. Now just watch. A little glass of wine, a nice dinner and a kiss from my husband, I'll be good as new.",
        "[ Rafael clears his throat ]",
        "Rafael: Well, this should be a nice start. I don't know much about wine, but Dusty did say that this is good one.",
        "Jack: Oh, well, thank you.",
        "Carly: Oh, okay. Mm. Dusty's right. This is good.",
        "Jack: Les is going to be out of our lives very soon, honey. I swear to you.",
        "Carly: I will drink to that.",
        "Jack: And I'm sorry you had to run into him at the station. That was a rookie move on my part. I should've been more aware.",
        "Carly: It's not your fault and it's no big deal.",
        "Jack: Honey, that's what I'm talking about. It is a big deal. It is. The man attacked you. You don't have to pretend that you're not scared when you run into him again. And you don't have to go through this on your own. I want you to talk to me.",
        "Carly: No, I don't want to talk about anything expect what's happening right here and right now. All right? I want to forget about Les. I want to forget that Julia was murdered. I just want to be here, right now, with you. A proper date with the man I love.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: Dammit.",
        "Carly: Well, who is it?",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: It's Tom.",
        "Carly: I guess you have to take it.",
        "Jack: What's up, Tom?",
        "Tom: Jack, I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but Keith has finally agreed to the exhumation. Yeah, I'm over here at St. Thomas cemetery. The guys are standing by and we're about to remove Julia's body from the grave now. But I sure would like it if you could be here. Okay, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I know how hard this must be for you.",
        "Keith: How would you know? How would anybody know? I'm sorry. Sorry.",
        "Lily: No, it's okay.",
        "Keith: I don't know why I'm snapping at you.",
        "Lily: It's okay, really.",
        "Keith: No, it's not. I mean, you've been the one friend that's been a friend to me in spite of everything.",
        "Lily: I am. Count on it, okay?",
        "Tom: Excuse me, Jack's on his way over here now.",
        "Keith: Of course. Wouldn't want to miss the show.",
        "Tom: So, Keith, the guys -- they gotta get started.",
        "Keith: Time's a-wasting. Right, bring 'em in.",
        "Lily: This is the right thing to do. You know that.",
        "Keith: Is it? You know, I'm looking at her gravestone here and, I mean, this is her resting place. Her final resting place. I mean, why do they even say final? It's supposed to be final, that's what -- that what that means. Oh, Julia --",
        "Tom: Lily, maybe you guys --",
        "Keith: Look, this was a mistake.",
        "Lily: We talked about this. You know, this is the right thing to do.",
        "Keith: No, it's not the right thing to do! It's not going to happen. I don't know why I let you guys talk me into this. It's not going to happen, not today!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Why haven't they called? Something could have gone wrong, you know?",
        "Sierra: We don't know that anything has gone wrong. Barbara, please. Just sit down or lay down or do anything, but stop pacing. You're making me nervous.",
        "Barbara: They should have called by now. I'm going to call Paul.",
        "Sierra: No, no, no. You know, the last thing they need is you checking up on them. What has got you worried all of the sudden?",
        "Barbara: I don't do waiting very well. You know what? Craig could have caught on to this. You know, there could be a little hitch, a little snag, he would sense it and our little plan to get rid of him would be blown out of the water. Have you forgotten what it's like to be on Craig's bad side?",
        "Sierra: You know, I know just how vindictive he can be. But it's not going to get to that. And you know what? We need to trust Dusty and Paul. We have no reason to believe that they're not in total control of the situation. And you know what? For all of Craig's bluster and bravado, looking down the barrel of a loaded gun, even Craig Montgomery will turn to jello.",
        "Barbara: Yeah. As long as he doesn't suspect the gun is empty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What is this? What are you trying to do to me?",
        "Faux Hwa: It's no use, Craig. I knew this wouldn't work.",
        "Customs agent: How many more of these packets am I going to find, Mr. Montgomery?",
        "Craig: I don't know! I don't where that one came from!",
        "Dusty: You may as well cop to it, because you busted.",
        "Craig: I have never met this guy. We only spoke on the phone, officer. I set up a shipment from his factory in Singapore to my company in the U.S.",
        "Faux Hwa: You told me you had customs taken care of. You said you paid these guys off!",
        "Craig: That's a lie!",
        "Paul: I guess it's true. I guess you really will do anything for a buck.",
        "Craig: You -- you're all over this, aren't you? And you, too. This is set up. You're not getting away with this.",
        "Paul: The only one not getting away with anything today, Craig, is you.",
        "Craig: I'm calling my lawyer.",
        "Margo: Why would you need to do that, Craig?",
        "Craig: Oh! Margo, thank you. I'm saved.",
        "Margo: Wouldn't bet on it.",
        "Craig: Margo, come on! Don't you see how ludicrous this is?",
        "Margo: Who -- who are you?",
        "Faux Hwa: Xian Hwa, at your service.",
        "Margo: How do you know my brother, Mr. Hwa?",
        "Faux Hwa: He contacted me about manufacturing clothing from his company's designs. We worked out a contract.",
        "Craig: That's the last true thing you're going to hear Hwa say.",
        "Margo: Go on.",
        "Faux Hwa: Once everything had been arranged and the shipment was ready, Mr. Montgomery contacted me again, this time with an adjustment to our deal.",
        "Craig: That's a complete fabrication.",
        "Faux Hwa: He told me something would be added to the shipment before it left Singapore. Something illegal.",
        "Craig: Okay, now we're going to enter Mr. Hwa's wonderland.",
        "Margo: Just stop talking.",
        "Faux Hwa: He pressured me. He threatened to pull the contract if I didn't agree to help him smuggle cocaine. Look, I had no choice. I needed the money.",
        "Craig: Margo, this is some kind of trick. Okay? I bet there's not even a real controlled substance in there.",
        "Margo: May I?",
        "Craig: Well, so what? I didn't put it there! Why would I do something -- why would I risk my freedom on something so stupid, so dangerous, so despicable?",
        "Paul: How about greed?",
        "Craig: These two clowns are trying to set me up to kill my custody fight with Jennifer!",
        "Margo: That's a little paranoid, even for you, Craig.",
        "Craig: Margo, it's an obvious plot! Even Barbara's involved.",
        "Margo: How is Barbara involved?",
        "Craig: She tried to poison me earlier tonight at Metro.",
        "Margo: Well, she's already tried that. Why would she do that? I mean, in your greater scheme of conspiracy theories, isn't the point to get you down here as soon as possible so that you can get caught?",
        "Paul: Kind of hard to do that if you're face down in a quaalude cocktail.",
        "Craig: You -- you, I will bury you and you.",
        "Paul: No, Montgomery, you have finally buried yourself. And I'm just glad I'm here to see it. Because now you won't be able to hurt Jennifer or anybody else that I care about.",
        "Dusty: Take a deep breath, pal. It's going to be your last.",
        "Craig: Do you hear this, Margo? That is practically an admission of guilt!",
        "Margo: All right, all right. Why don't you let me handle this? You -- you, I think you need to take Mr. Hwa down to the federal building and further interrogate him. If I have any other questions, I will call you. Why don't you go through the boxes and see what else you can find. And you, do I have to use these or are you going to come along peacefully.",
        "Craig: You're going to arrest me?",
        "Margo: Craig Montgomery, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.",
        "Craig: You're breaking my heart, Margo.",
        "Margo: No, Craig. You're breaking mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: You know, the medical examiners and the coroner, I mean, she's just a statistic to them, just a number. It's not right. It's not right that she gets cut open like this. It's wrong!",
        "Lily: What's wrong is that she's dead. And that she was murdered by someone that the police have not been able to prove killed her.",
        "Keith: I just don't want Julia to hurt anymore. I know that sounds crazy because --",
        "Lily: It doesn't sound crazy at all. But you know what would hurt Julia more than anything? That the truth about her death remained hidden. If we never found out, never knew what really happened to her.",
        "Keith: She was knocked around her whole life. I just want her to have some peace.",
        "Jack: Then let's catch her killer, Keith. And put him away for good.",
        "Keith: The reinforcements have arrived.",
        "Jack: No, there's no us and them here, Keith. We're in this together. And we're close. We can nail him. Julia's got the answer. Don't you think she'd want us to find it?",
        "Lily: The Julia that you loved, your sister, she'll always be with you. In your heart.",
        "Keith: That's why it hurts so much.",
        "Lily: Want to give her some peace? Find out the truth.",
        "Tom: So, where do we stand?",
        "Keith: Okay. Do it. Before I change my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rafael: What happened to Mr. Snyder?",
        "Carly: He promised that he'd be right back. He had to go check on a corpse.",
        "Rafael: No way, get out.",
        "Carly: No. It's true. My husband, the grave robber.",
        "Rafael: You know, I think I saw that movie.",
        "Carly: Yeah? How'd it end?",
        "Rafael: Bad.",
        "Carly: Oh. Well, luckily, this isn't a movie. It's real life, so I have some hope that it'll turn out all right.",
        "Rafael: Well, hope's good.",
        "Carly: Yeah, you got it. Hope is good. So is courage. You get high points for courage, you know, because without courage, where would we be?",
        "Rafael: Well, it's nice and safe and warm in here.",
        "Carly: Yeah. That's a good thing, huh?",
        "Rafael: Real good. I'll be right back.",
        "Carly: Yeah, go. I mean, here I am blabbing about nothing and you have to work. So, go. Go ahead and do it. And no matter how I appear right now, I actually am fine. So, you go, do your work and I'll just be right here. I'll wait for Jack. Good ol' Jack. He'll be back. Lily? I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. Or maybe I wanted you to be. Get a grip, Carly. Or maybe get some air. Get some air. That'd be good. Ooh!",
        "Man: Excuse me.",
        "Carly: You're excused.",
        "Rafael: Hey.",
        "Carly: Yeah? What?",
        "Rafael: What's wrong with you?",
        "Carly: Nothing. I'm fine. Just tell Jack -- it's all right. I'll tell him myself. I'm gonna go see him right now.",
        "Rafael: But I thought you said he was --",
        "Carly: He's digging up a grave? He is.",
        "Rafael: Are you sure you want to go to a graveyard right now?",
        "Carly: I'm okay. I'm a cop's wife. I can handle it. Its being alone I can't handle.",
        "Carly: Jack? Honey? Are you here? Whoa! Watch out, boys, that last step is a killer. Oh, Julia -- it's you. Or -- not anymore. Jack? Jack, are you here? I'm too late. Hey, Julia, I'm -- I'm really sorry that you're dead and all. Nobody deserves to go like that. But when is it going to end? Your life is still haunting me. I just want it to be over. I just want things to go back to normal. Is that too much to ask? [Cell phone rings] Hello? Hello? [Carly gasps] Great. What now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yeah, mission accomplished. Dr. Harris has the body in the morgue now. No, there's no way of telling how long it's going to take. But listen, when I know something you know something. I'll talk to you soon. Whatever it is, Lucinda, I'm busy. I don't have the time right now.",
        "Lucinda: Make the time, Jack. Because I have vital information on the Julia Larrabee murder case, unless of course the department isn't interested in solving it.",
        "Jack: No, we are interested in solving it. As a matter of fact, I am not even supposed to be here tonight. But because of the murder you're referring to, I was dragged away from the one night alone with my wife in months.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, then it's important. Has there been a break in the case?",
        "Jack: Why don't you tell me? You're the one with the vital information, right?",
        "Lucinda: Right, yeah. Look, I think you're just operating under false assumptions.",
        "Jack: Meaning what?",
        "Lucinda: The cell phone. The cell phone found in Les Sweeny's room. No one actually witnessed the discovery at the time Keith Morrissey supposedly made it.",
        "Jack: Lily seems to think it's legit.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Lily. She's not thinking. Gratitude is blinding her from the man's motives.",
        "Jack: Which are what?",
        "Lucinda: To keep Sweeny here, to keep him here and the suspicion on him and divert it from himself.",
        "Jack: That's an interesting theory. It is. But before you go printing headlines in \"The City Times,\" I'd wait for hard evidence if I were you.",
        "Lucinda: Jack? Are you comfortable having somebody held here in the slammer on planted evidence?",
        "Jack: What I'm not comfortable with is the fact that I'm standing here arguing with you and my wife is probably wondering if she's ever going to see me again tonight. So if you don't mind, I've got work to do.",

        "[Barbara daydreaming]",
        "Craig: Hello, Barbara. Surprised?",
        "Barbara: Craig. What are you --?",
        "Craig: What am I doing here? I'm the last person you expected to see, huh? Let me give you a little piece of advice from a professional. When you're trying to destroy someone, you never ever send a blood relative to do your dirty work. It took me all of about ten minutes to reduce Margo to tears, pleading with me to forgive her for trying to bring me down.",
        "Barbara: I don't know what you're talking about. What dirty work?",
        "Craig: Save it for somebody who cares. As usual, you tried and failed. I, of course, won't. So get ready, Barbara, because I'm going to set about destroying you and Paul and Jennifer. Jennifer, I'll save for last and let her give birth to my child. And my child and I will stand gloating over your miserable world. You ready for your close- up? It's fade out time. The end.",
        "Sierra: Here we go. Barbara?",
        "Barbara: I've got to call Paul. I've gotta find out what's going on.",
        "Sierra: No, no, no. Dusty just called my cell. They're on their way.",
        "Barbara: He did? What did he say? Is everything all right?",
        "Sierra: Well, I don't know. The signal broke up before I got any details. You know, I've never seen you so rattled.",
        "Barbara: My family is on the line here. If anything goes wrong, it won't be very good for us.",
        "Sierra: It won't be good for any of us.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am. I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Sierra: What a pair, huh? The sudden unlikely allies in a scam to scam a scammer. Who would've ever imagined this moment?",
        "Barbara: Not I. I guess, it just proves that under the right circumstances we are all capable of anything, aren't we?",
        "Sierra: Yes, we are.",
        "Barbara: What happened?",
        "Dusty: It wasn't pretty.",
        "Paul: It sure wasn't pretty at all. It wasn't pretty for Craig Montgomery.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: All right, I get the point, Margo. You want to teach me a lesson. You know I wouldn't smuggle drugs, yet you want to punish me for crimes you feel I've committed against humanity.",
        "Margo: You know, if you're trying to butter me up, save your breath.",
        "Craig: Or maybe this is Jennifer's idea, that I have no claim to the baby. You know that is wrong. If you think this little joy ride is going to intimidate me --",
        "Margo: Craig, you are under arrest.",
        "Craig: Yeah, right.",
        "Margo: You think I'm fooling around? You think I'm playing with you? No, I'm not. I'm done playing with you.",
        "Craig: You believe I'm guilty?",
        "Margo: You have been most of your life. [Craig laughs] This little conspiracy theory of yours? No one is going to buy it, not even the judge. When he hears this and checks out your record, he's going to throw the book at you, Craig. He's may throw the entire encyclopedia of law at you.",
        "Craig: What am I looking at?",
        "Margo: 30 years, at least.",
        "Craig: I'd never survive that.",
        "Margo: Well, you should've thought of that before.",
        "Craig: Before what? I was set up! Margo, you want to be a party of throwing your own flesh and blood in jail for a crime you know I didn't commit, huh? Can you sleep with that, knowing you did that to me? Or --",
        "Margo: Or?",
        "Craig: Or can you let me go.",
        "Margo: Just like that.",
        "Craig: Yes, just like that. You have my passport. It was in the manifest you confiscated at the docks. You can stop the car. You can close your eyes. You can let me slip away.",

        "Craig: We're in the middle of nowhere, Margo. What's going on?",
        "Margo: Just be quiet. Craig, you have drained my patience, you've drained my compassion, my --",
        "Craig: Don't say love. 'Cause I know you love me.",
        "Margo: Shut up. I don't want to still love you. You don't deserve to be loved. Not by me -- especially by me. But yet there's still a part of me that somehow hopes --",
        "Craig: That I can change?",
        "Margo: That maybe there's a soul inside of you.",
        "Craig: You're letting me go, aren't you?",
        "Margo: Not if you don't be quiet I won't. I don't know, maybe it's this town. Maybe it just brings out the worst in you.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, I've often considered that.",
        "Margo: You are not going to shut up, are you?",
        "Craig: Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be part of my nature.",
        "Margo: You know what, Craig, you were right the other day, at the police station. You said that you were nothing but a sad, flawed man.",
        "Craig: Yes, I am. Yes, I am. And I am in need of a break. A big change. A new start.",
        "Margo: Every bit of me wants to believe that that could happen.",

        "Margo: 'Cause you can never come back here.",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Margo: Never. You can never contact me or Katie or Jennifer. No one. Understand?",
        "Craig: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the baby? What about my child? Jennifer's baby?",
        "Margo: Wait a minute, wait a minute. There is no negotiation on the table here, all right? You go down that road to the airport just beyond the underpass.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Margo: You get on the first flight out of here, but not to New York, not to L.A. -- Out of the country. You leave the country. And I'm not to know where you are. But wherever you end up, you better have a foolproof plan to change your identity and to disappear completely. Do you understand? Because I will not be able to stop them from putting out an APB on you. And they will hunt you down like a dog.",
        "Craig: What will happen to you?",
        "Margo: Nothing will happen to me. I'll make up a story. They'll believe me.",
        "Craig: All right, I don't want you hurt.",
        "Margo: You know, that's the problem, Craig. You don't even know you do it. Here's your passport. I'm gonna give you all the money I've got on me, okay?",
        "Craig: All right, okay. I'm feeling -- I don't know. I'm feeling there's something I should -- is there something I should say? I mean, are we missing a moment here?",
        "Margo: I guess we missed it a long time ago. Good-bye, Craig.",
        "Craig: Come here. Come here. You're doing the right thing.",
        "Margo: You know what? This isn't about doing the right thing. This is about love. And sometimes they don't go hand in hand. Go on, go. Go.",

        "Keith: Listen, I want to apologize about what happened in the cemetery. You know, I went a little crazy being out there. So if I --",
        "Tom: It's okay. We understand.",
        "Jack: It was a tough decision to make. But you've gotta believe that it was the right one.",
        "Keith: Okay. What about Carly? How's she doing?",
        "Jack: Well, you know, the attack shook her up a little bit. And she's trying to hang in there, but I think she's having a little more trouble than she's willing to admit. And you know, right now, she's is sitting alone at Metro waiting for me, so I gotta --",
        "Keith: Okay.",
        "Jack: Good luck. \u0091",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I can't see a thing. Where's a full moon when you need one? [Branch snaps] Who's there? Hello?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Hey, don't tell me you're finished with the autopsy.",
        "Ben: No, not yet. But I came across something I figured you'd want to know right away.",
        "Keith: What?",
        "Ben: Julia did not die from a blow to her head.",
        "Keith: What are you talking about?",
        "Lily: Then how?",
        "Ben: Well, judging from the internal swelling and toxicology report, my guess is that it was anaphylactic shock.",
        "Tom: You mean, like an allergic reaction?",
        "Ben: That's what I'm thinking.",
        "Lily: So it was an accident?",
        "Ben: Not necessarily. All right, let's take this one step at a time. First, we have to find out if there was anything she was extremely allergic to.",
        "Tom: Keith? Any ideas?",
        "Keith: Yeah, I do. Bees. She was very allergic. She was stung when she was seven. She almost died.",
        "Ben: Okay, well, that'd fall in line with what I'm seeing.",
        "Lily: But Julia died in the middle of winter -- no bees.",
        "Ben: Well, somebody could have given her some bee venom. Or maybe even a little bee pollen would have done the trick. It could have been injected, inhaled, there's lots of possibilities. But that's why I don't think it was an accident.",
        "Tom: And that would mean it was premeditated.",
        "Lily: What a horrible way to die.",
        "Keith: Yeah, and I know just how it happened.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Who are you? What do you want?",
        "Groundskeeper: You shouldn't be here.",
        "Carly: I'm waiting for my husband. Jack Snyder, Detective Jack Snyder. He's a cop. He'll be here any second.",
        "Groundskeeper: I don't think so.",
        "Carly: You stay away from me! You stop! Stop right there!",
        "[Carly screams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: You know, a progress report would have been nice. You know how I get when I'm out of the loop.",
        "Paul: I kind of had my hands full with Craig.",
        "Dusty: It's done. Montgomery's gone for good now.",
        "Barbara: We don't know that, not for sure, not until we talk to Margo.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah? Is there reason to think that Margo might not follow through with her part of the plan or what?",
        "Sierra: No, I don't think that we need to worry. All she had to do was scare Craig, right? And he was scared, wasn't he? I mean, he thought the cocaine was real.",
        "Paul: Yes. He thought Mr. Hwa was real. He even thought the customs agent was real.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's all good. But the final push has to come from Margo.",
        "Paul: Margo will come through.",
        "Barbara: So long as she forgets for one moment that she's Craig's sister.",
        "Sierra: Margo knows as well as any of us that Craig needs to be run out of town.",
        "Margo: I just wish that would have made it easier for me.",
        "Dusty: Tell us you got good news.",
        "Margo: It's done. He's gone. I don't expect this means anything to any of you, but I hated every minute of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Help! Anybody? Somebody help me! You stay away from me! I've got something in my purse here! Don't make me use it.",
        "[Carly screaming]",
        "Jack: It's me! It's me! It's Jack! Honey, are you okay?",
        "Carly: Oh, where were you? Oh, I was so scared and that guy.",
        "Jack: What guy? No, that's Pete. Pete's the groundskeeper.",
        "Groundskeeper: I'm sorry I scared you, lady. But you sort of scared me, too.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack --",
        "Jack: Honey, what are you doing here? I was on my way to Metro to meet up with and Rafael called and said you left kind of suddenly. Honey, what's -- what happened?",
        "Carly: Oh, God.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: And I remember one time Sweeny was laughing and making fun of Julia, you know, saying she couldn't handle a little bee sting. It really made her mad, because, you know, she prided herself on being so strong. She never got sick. And this is just one thing she couldn't stand up to or handle, you know?",
        "Tom: So who else knew about the allergy?",
        "Keith: Well, me, J.J. and Les. So do the math.",
        "Lily: You think Les injected her with bee venom?",
        "Keith: I don't think, I know so. He found a way to get his hands on it, he slipped out of the halfway house and he killed her. Julia was alive and talking on the phone when he got there. We can prove that. Sweeny showed up out of the blue.",
        "Julia: What are you doing here? Les, what are you doing here? If the police find you here -- if they find you anywhere near me or J.J. --",
        "Les: You're the one that's gonna be locked up this time.",
        "Keith: He had a court order demanding shared custody.",
        "Les: Read it. Read it.",
        "Julia: What is this? What is this?",
        "Keith: He wanted J.J., and Julia wasn't about to let that happen.",
        "Julia: I will never let you take my son away from me. Are you crazy? Never. Get out!",
        "Les: Not without my son.",
        "Julia: Quit pretending you love him, Les. You don't love him. You hurt him. You hurt him so bad. I'm never going to let you hurt him again. Never. We're going to go somewhere that you won't find us.",
        "Les: Not this time.",
        "Julia: What are you doing?",
        "Les: Shut up! Shut up!",
        "Julia: Les, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? No, what is that, Les? What is that? What is that? Stop, please. What is that? What are you doing?",
        "Les: What am I doing? I'm winning. This time I'm winning.",
        "[Julia screams]",
        "Keith: It didn't take long for the anaphylactic shock to set in.",
        "Julia: J.J. -- J.J. --",
        "Les: J.J., J.J. Oh, J.J. will miss you for a while, Jules. But, you know, he'll get over it.",
        "Tom: We'll need more proof.",
        "Ben: Well, I'll check for puncture wounds. Run some tests for any traces of bee pollen or bee venom.",
        "Keith: You know, this makes it even worse. Because this wasn't something that just spun out of control. This was premeditated. This was cold blooded. This was, you know, first-degree murder. Something's gotta be done to Sweeny. He's gonna have to pay for this.",
        "Tom: If we can prove that he killed her, he'll pay with a life sentence. I promise.",
        "Keith: Well, I'm holding you to it.",
        "Lily: You okay?",
        "Keith: I just gotta get out of here.",
        "Lily: You want me to come with you?",
        "Keith: No. No, no, I just need to be alone.",
        "Lily: You really shouldn't be out there by yourself.",
        "Keith: Listen, Lily, I know you want to help. But there's nothing you can do right now. I need to be alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Margo -- Margo, listen. We all did what we had to do. And it really is the best for everybody.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know. I want to believe that. I do. And I take full responsibility for my part in it. I just hope that it's over for good now.",
        "Dusty: Craig's on a plane, right?",
        "Margo: Yes, and far away from Oakdale.",
        "Dusty: You're not having a sudden crisis and decide to tell him the truth, are you?",
        "Margo: No. I know that Craig had to leave town, one way or the other. I know he had to leave. It was just painful saying good-bye, that's all. And I hope wherever he ends up that he can pull his life together. And I know it's highly unlikely, as long as he was here when he screwed up, he had people watching out for him. But out there, he's on his own.",
        "Paul: Craig's a big boy. I think he can take care of himself.",
        "Barbara: Better out there than here, ruining lives.",
        "Margo: You know, what, Barbara? He's still my brother and I love him. I don't think you'd ever understand that.",
        "Sierra: I do.",
        "Dusty: I think the best thing for Craig is for him to feel a few punches for a change, you know?",
        "Margo: I just wonder where he's going to end up.",
        "Paul: Probably the last place any of us would ever expect.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Woman: Is this your first time going to Bangkok?",
        "Craig: What? Oh, no.",
        "Woman: Business?",
        "Craig: No, no, no. My business in the Far East ended abruptly this evening. I don't think it's going to resume any time too soon.",
        "Woman: Why Bangkok?",
        "Craig: Why not?",
        "Woman: I've never been there before. Is it nice?",
        "Craig: Nice? I hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Feeling better yet?",
        "Carly: I don't know, Jack. I keep telling myself that I'm fine, but -- I was scared here in a crowded room.",
        "Jack: So heading to a cemetery, that sounded like a good idea?",
        "Carly: I was headed to you.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry I wasn't there when you got there, honey.",
        "Carly: Not as sorry as I was, Jack.",
        "Jack: Pete is harmless.",
        "Carly: That's the problem. Nothing seems harmless to me right now.",
        "Jack: I've been thinking about it. Maybe you should get away for a few days. Go to Montana, visit with Hannah. Or someplace else -- anyplace you want to go.",
        "Carly: With you? Just the two of us?",
        "Jack: Honey, I can't get out of town right now. I'm in the middle of this murder case. And with Les on the loose, you're never going to feel safe here.",
        "Carly: I don't think I'm going to feel safe anywhere, jack.",
        "Jack: That's why you need a distraction.",
        "Carly: I want you to distract me.",
        "Jack: Oh, baby, I wish I could, but --",
        "Carly: I know. I understand.",
        "Jack: Well, at least some decent news came out this autopsy. Tom called me while you were cleaning up. They got a new lead on something that might prove conclusively who killed Julia and how.",
        "Carly: Something that will prove that Les did it.",
        "Jack: I'm not jumping to any conclusions. But we're close. This will all be over soon, babe.",
        "Carly: Oh, I hope so, Jack. I really need it to be over. We all do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Look, you've gotta go to bed, pumpkin. It's late, and don't even think about waking up your sister just 'cause you can't sleep. I promise I'll come in and kiss you when I get home. I love you. Bye.",
        "Tom: Ben's finishing up the autopsy.",
        "Lily: Anything new?",
        "Tom: Well, he found a puncture wound on Julia's thigh, consistent with an injection from some type of syringe.",
        "Lily: So, Keith was right. Les did poison her.",
        "Tom: No, it means somebody may have injected something into her leg. And that's all it proves. I have a search warrant for the halfway house and the hotel where he's been staying since they let him out.",
        "Lily: Did you tell Keith?",
        "Tom: Well, I tried. His phone was turned off. Tonight was pretty rough on him.",
        "Lily: It's all been very rough on him.",
        "Tom: So you two seem to be getting close.",
        "Lily: We're friends. He's in a lot of pain right now and he's kind of alone.",
        "Tom: Well, you tell him we're closing in. I think we're about to catch our killer.",
