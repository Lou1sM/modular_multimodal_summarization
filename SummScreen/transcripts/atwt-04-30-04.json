        "Nancy: Are you all right? ",
        "Alison: Oh, great. I'm great. ",
        "Nancy: Compared to what? You look as if \r\nyou've been run over by a cement truck. Isn't it time you stopped sneaking out \r\nat night and waiting tables? ",
        "Alison: I can't, Chris is working himself to \r\ndeath because I pushed him into getting that stupid condo. I have to do my part \r\nto help make up for what we lost. I cost Chris so much. ",
        "Nancy: How much do you think you're going to \r\ncost him when he finds out you're lying? How much do you think it's going to \r\ncost your relationship? ",
        "Chris: Good afternoon, beautiful. ",
        "Alison: Oh, so the shower's free. I'll be \r\nright back. ",
        "Chris: Nice to see you, too. Gram, do we have \r\nanything to eat? Because I am starving. ",
        "Nancy: Chris -- maybe I shouldn't meddle.\r\n",
        "Chris: Well, that's never stopped you before.\r\n",
        "Nancy: Very funny. Have you thought any more \r\nabout letting Alison work at night? She wants much more to do. ",
        "Chris: Alison still wants to work a second \r\njob? ",
        "Nancy: Yes, and I don't see anything so bad \r\nabout that. ",
        "Chris: You know what? Me, either. ",
        "Nancy: You've changed your mind? ",
        "Chris: I've done better than that. I got her \r\nhired. ",
        "",
        "Carly: Barbara. Barbara! ",
        "Barbara: Carly -- I didn't see you there.\r\n",
        "Carly: That's the part that's got me stumped. \r\nI was standing right in front of you. You just bumped into me. ",
        "Barbara: Yeah, well I have a lot on my mind.\r\n",
        "Carly: Obviously. ",
        "Barbara: And in fact, I didn't expect to see \r\nyou here. I thought you were working at the office today. ",
        "Carly: I just brought parker to the doctor.\r\n",
        "Barbara: Oh, I didn't realize. Is he sick?\r\n",
        "Carly: He's just running a slight fever, but \r\nEmily\u2019s with him. Now stop trying to change the subject. Why are you hanging \r\naround Memorial with Walker Daniels when we're supposed to be putting the \r\nfinishing touches on the fashion show? ",
        "Barbara: Oh, well, we just had some details \r\nto go over for the fund-raiser. ",
        "Carly: Really? ",
        "Barbara: Yes. Yes, in fact -- I was just \r\ngoing make some phone calls to some donors and then go back and work from my \r\nsuite this morning. ",
        "Carly: Alone? ",
        "Barbara: Well, Carly what are you getting at? ",
        "Walker: Well, I'm ready to take you home, \r\nBarbara. Shall we? ",
        "Carly: Oh, no. There's no need for that. I'll \r\ntake her home. ",
        "Barbara: Oh, that is not necessary -- \r\n",
        "Carly: Yes, of course it is. I need to spend \r\nsome time with you. She's such a busy lady. If I didn't know better, I'd say she \r\nwas spreading herself too thin. ",
        "Walker: Are you okay to ride with Mrs. \r\nSnyder? ",
        "Carly: Oh, yes she is. I have a million \r\nquestions about the show. And you can answer them on the way home. And you can \r\nget back to your patients. ",
        "Barbara: No. No, you have to stay with me.\r\n",
        "",
        "Blaine: Hey, we've never gotten this kind of \r\npre-show response. Every reporter in the trade has been calling -- publicity's \r\noverwhelmed. Cabot Motors has created quite a buzz. ",
        "Paul: Give these to my Mother. Barbra was the \r\none that was jumping up and down when Cabot Motors agreed to sponsor the fashion \r\nshow, so let her deal with the noise. ",
        "Blaine: Ms. Ryan's out. ",
        "Paul: She's out where? ",
        "Blaine: She had an appointment, and she's \r\ngoing to be checking in when she's done. ",
        "Paul: Well, give them to Jordan Sinclair. \r\nHe's always trying to appear like he's indispensable. ",
        "Blaine: Uh -- he's not here either. \r\n",
        "Paul: Oh, where the hell is he? ",
        "Blaine: He said he'd call in. ",
        "Paul: I didn't ask you if he was going to \r\ncall in. I asked you where he was. And I expect an answer, Blaine. ",
        "Blaine: He doesn't want to be interrupted.\r\n",
        "Paul: Have you forgotten who you work for?\r\n",
        "Blaine: No. ",
        "Paul: Jordan Sinclair doesn't run this \r\ncompany, I do! And unless you want to file for unemployment, you're gonna tell \r\nme where boy wonder is and what he's up to! ",
        "",
        "Jordan: Not a good idea. ",
        "Rosanna: Feels like a very good idea to me.\r\n",
        "Jordan: What we feel and what is right for us \r\ncan be different things. ",
        "Rosanna: Aw, come on. Live a little. You want \r\nthis as much as I do. Hmm? ",
        "Jordan: Doesn't matter what I want. \r\n",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes it does. It matters to me. \r\nAnd I will do anything -- anything -- to give it to you. ",
        "Jordan: Right now I'll settle for a promise \r\nthat you won't take this the wrong way. We can't see each other, Rosanna. That's \r\njust the way it has to be. ",
        "",
        "Nancy: You got Alison a second job without \r\nasking her? ",
        "Chris: It's a surprise. ",
        "Nancy: Not all surprises are welcome. \r\n",
        "Chris: Gram, we're not talking about a night \r\nshift at a burger joint. Okay? It's with me at the clinic. We can go to work \r\ntogether, come home together. It's perfect. Okay? She is gonna be so totally \r\nstoked when I tell her that she's been hired. ",
        "Alison: Hired? Me? For what? ",
        "Chris: It was supposed to be a surprise.\r\n",
        "Nancy: It is. ",
        "Alison: Chris? ",
        "Chris: Starting tonight, you get to work with \r\nme at the clinic. ",
        "Alison: You're kidding! ",
        "Chris: Look at her, Gram. She doesn't even \r\nknow what to do with herself. Yeah, from now on, you and I get to spend every \r\nnight together. ",
        "Alison: Every night, wow. ",
        "Chris: Surprised? ",
        "Alison: Definitely. ",
        "Nancy: Alison may have a surprise of her own.\r\n",
        "Alison: Right. Hey, Chris, I really -- I \r\ndon't know exactly how to say this. ",
        "[Pager beeps] ",
        "Chris: Oh, hey, hold that thought, will ya? I \r\ngot to call the hospital. ",
        "Nancy: Tell him the truth, Alison. \r\n",
        "Alison: He'll never understand. ",
        "Nancy: I can't believe I'm saying this -- \r\ndon't tell him. Quit work at the Metro and start at the clinic. ",
        "Alison: You don't understand. I can't quit \r\nworking at Metro. Not after what happened last night. I am so dead. ",
        "[Alison sighs] ",
        "",
        "Walker: Yes, yes, you're right. We didn't get \r\na chance to talk about those donors you wanted to tell me about, and if I take \r\nyou home, we can get that out of the way. ",
        "Barbara: Absolutely. We have an awful lot of \r\nloose ends to tie up about the fund-raiser. ",
        "Carly Oh, will you forget about the \r\nfund-raiser? ",
        "Barbara: I can't, Carly. I made a commitment.\r\n",
        "Carly And I just let somebody else bring my \r\nchild home from the pediatrician. I guarantee you, I will wake up at 3:00 in the \r\nmorning consumed with guilt about that, but until that last model walks down the \r\nrunway in Vegas, our personal lives have got to be on hold. So whatever is going \r\non here between the two of you might just have to wait for now. ",
        "Barbara: I'm gonna let Walker take me home, \r\nand then you and I can speak later, all right? ",
        "Carly I don't want my questions answered \r\nlater. I'd like them answered now. ",
        "Barbara: Carly, I have okayed every detail \r\ndown to the last button, so if you have a problem, you can deal with it \r\nyourself. ",
        "Carly So you -- you suddenly have no interest \r\nin the finale of a show that could make or break the both of us? ",
        "Barbara: Fine. Fine, just bring the car \r\naround, all right? I'll meet you outside. ",
        "Carly Good. I'll see you in a minute. \r\n",
        "Barbara: Yeah. Is she gone? ",
        "Walker: Yes. ",
        "Barbara: God, everything looks dark. I ran \r\nright into her. I didn't even know she was there. I even tried to cover. I told \r\nher that I was distracted, but I think she may have guessed what's wrong. \r\n",
        "Walker: I doubt it. But sooner or later, \r\nsomebody's gonna figure out your secret. ",
        "Barbara: As long as it's after our huge \r\nsuccess in Vegas, I don't really care. ",
        "Walker: What happens if you have one of those \r\nepisodes while you're there? ",
        "Barbara: Oh, good. Good. It's clearing up.\r\n",
        "Walker: Barbara, you didn't answer the \r\nquestion. What happens if you have another episode when you're in Las Vegas?\r\n",
        "Barbara: Well, I've gotten pretty good at \r\ncovering, don't you think? ",
        "Walker: For how long, Barbara? ",
        "Barbara: I gotta go. She's not a very patient \r\nwoman. Would you walk me out, please? ",
        "Walker: Who's going to help you while you're \r\nin Las Vegas? Covering these episodes in a strange town, unfamiliar rooms, \r\nunfamiliar people -- it's going to be a whole other ballgame. ",
        "Barbara: You're not helping me much. You're \r\nsupposed to be supporting me. ",
        "Walker: I am supporting you. That's why I'm \r\nhaving second thoughts about this. ",
        "Barbara: What do you mean? ",
        "Walker: I mean I can't let you leave town.\r\n",
        "Blaine: I don't want to be fired, Paul. I \r\njust promised Jordan he wouldn't be disturbed. ",
        "",
        "Paul: I still run this company, and when an \r\nemployee of mine goes AWOL a few hours before a fashion show, I get to know why. ",
        "Blaine: He's not blowing off work. He's \r\nhaving a meeting about the show. ",
        "Paul: With who? He doesn't want anyone to \r\nknow with who? Okay, you have two seconds, Blaine, or you can start looking \r\nthrough the want ads. ",
        "Blaine: Rosanna Cabot. Jordan is meeting with \r\nRosanna Cabot. ",
        "",
        "Rosanna: What are you talking about? We're \r\ntwo consenting adults. Of course we can see each other. ",
        "Jordan: Well, maybe after the fashion show. \r\nBut right now, I have a lot of responsibilities. This is a critical time for \r\nB.R.O. and I have to stay focused. ",
        "Rosanna: You know, you sound like Barbara. \r\nYou've been talking to her, haven't you? ",
        "Jordan: She is depending on me right now, \r\nyeah. ",
        "Rosanna: Right now? Barbara doesn't do \r\ndependency on a limited-time basis. If she's starting to lean on you, you'd \r\nbetter run. ",
        "Jordan: No, it's not like that. ",
        "Rosanna: You know, she messed things up so \r\nbadly with her own son, she's probably desperate to find another man that she \r\ncan own. ",
        "Jordan: Nobody owns me. Okay, Rosanna? I'm \r\nsticking with Barbara, because it's the right thing to do. ",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I -- I just \r\nthought that you -- never mind. Sometimes I can be such an idiot. ",
        "Jordan: What? What did you think? ",
        "Rosanna: I just thought that you cared about \r\nme. ",
        "Jordan: I do. I care about all my friends.\r\n",
        "Rosanna: The same way that you care about \r\nJennifer? ",
        "Jordan: We've gotten close, yes. ",
        "Rosanna: Close like you're gonna send her a \r\nbirthday card, or close like this? You know, if she has hopes and you want to \r\nlet her down gently, I understand. I just hope that you don't have the same \r\nplans for me. ",
        "Jordan: I don't get this. ",
        "Rosanna: What's not to get? ",
        "Jordan: You. You're -- you're smart, sexy, \r\nsuccessful. What the hell do you want with a guy like me? There's nothing that I \r\ncan give you that you don't already have. ",
        "Rosanna: Jordan, you have no idea. \r\n",
        "Jordan: I have to get back to the office. \r\nThank you for the ego boost, but I just -- I don't belong here. ",
        "Rosanna: You know what? You're right. You're \r\nright. I am a smart, successful woman. I am a wealthy woman. I carry a lot of \r\nweight in the business world, and what has that gotten me? It's gotten me a life \r\nfull of \"yes\" men. Do you know what I want? I want a man who isn't afraid to \r\nrise to the challenge. I want a man who isn't afraid to win big. And you are \r\nthat kind of man, Jordan Sinclair. I'm the biggest prize in the Cracker Jack \r\nbox. So what are you waiting for? Dig in. Today we're so busy... ",
        "",
        "Alison: I don't understand. I've lied to \r\nChris so many times, and I swore that I would never do it again. How do I keep \r\ngetting myself into this mess? ",
        "Nancy: Telling the truth is a matter of \r\nchoice. You have to be brave enough to choose it. ",
        "Alison: I mean, you don't understand. 'Cause \r\nlast night I was waitressing this group of people, and they ordered a ton of \r\nstuff and they ran up their bill, and then they stiffed me. ",
        "Nancy: Oh, that's terrible. ",
        "Alison: Yes, and to make it worse, now I have \r\nto make good on that. And I can't stop working at Metro until that bill is paid \r\noff. ",
        "Nancy: And you can only work there at night.\r\n",
        "Alison: Yes, because I'm working at the \r\nhospital during the day. ",
        "Nancy: Then there's only one solution. I will \r\ncover your bill, and you can pay me back over these next few months. ",
        "Alison: Mrs. Hughes, thank you so much for \r\nthat. I appreciate that. But if I stop working at Metro and I start working at \r\nthe clinic, I'll never be able to pay you back and help Chris. And I won't be \r\nmaking all of those tips. ",
        "Nancy: Then you're out of options. You have \r\nto tell Chris the truth. ",
        "Chris: Ali, that was Ben who paged me. He \r\nwants to know what you decided. Are you going to come work with me at the clinic \r\nor not? ",
        "Nancy: Oh, my goodness, look at the time. I \r\nshould have watered the plants long ago. ",
        "Alison: Ah -- well, would I have to work at \r\nthe clinic every night? ",
        "Chris: Nope. Just the nights I'm working. And \r\nI was thinking midnight meetings in the supply \r\ncloset. ",
        "Alison: Can I just, you know, just have a \r\nlittle bit of time. ",
        "Chris: That's what I'm offering. Time \r\ntogether. ",
        "Alison: I just -- I just need you to stop \r\npressuring me. ",
        "Chris: Well, sorry, Ali. I thought you'd be \r\nall over this. ",

        "Barbara: There is no way I am staying here in \r\nOakdale while my children are out in Las Vegas. This show, this entire relaunch \r\nis not about some kind of personal triumph. It's a triumph for my entire family.\r\n",
        "Walker: You have a fast-growing brain tumor \r\nthat's producing episodes of blindness in increasing numbers. ",
        "Barbara: Oh, I know what it's doing. I'm \r\nliving it. ",
        "Walker: We have a window of opportunity here, \r\nBarbara. If we don't take it -- ",
        "Barbara: I could die. I get that. But this \r\nshow has the power to reunite my family like nothing else has, and I'm not going \r\nto give that up. I'm going to Las Vegas. ",
