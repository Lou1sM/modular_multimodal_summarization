        "Jack tells Margo that Katie stayed overnight with Brad at an Inn outside of town. Margo thinks Jack should just talk to Katie to clear the air instead of being the strong silent type. Katie dreams of Jack, but she wakes up hungover in bed with Brad. Gwen worries that Adam and/or Jade will always be after them to hurt them. Cleo tells Jade that she is not leaving town and will continue on with their plan for her to become Gwen alone. Brad drops his towel in front of Katie. Brad tries to convince Katie that Jack will remain unavailable in the love department for the foreseeable future. Cleo pretends to give in to Jade and will leave town, meanwhile she is completely hung up on Will. Will lies about not having class and goes to find Jade. He threatens Jade to stay away from them. Katie has a plan, which involves syrup. Cleo lets herself back into Will and Gwen's and dresses up as Gwen. Katie goes to the Farm to see Jack, but when he is not there, she pretends it is no big deal. Jack goes to see Katie at WOAK, but finds Brad and lets him know he doesn't appreciate the game he is playing. Brad explains that his and Katie's relationship changed when he ended up naked in front of her; he thinks she liked it; Katie walks up wondering what she liked? Barbara walks in on Cleo, as Gwen, and has a conversation with her. They have an interesting exchange, but Barbara leaves happy and positive about \u0091Gwen's' new outlook on life. Jade and Gwen have another run-in. Jade then sees Barbara, who is borderline nice, thanks to the conversation she just had with \u0091Gwen' at their home. A shocked Jade realizes that Barbara talked with Cleo. Cleo (still dressed as Gwen) is rushing out of Will and Gwen's house when she runs into Will."

        "Margo: Wow, that Sanders Commission report has got you hooked --",
        "Jack: What? Oh, yeah. The recommendations are um, perceptive.",
        "Margo: So, are you, Jack. They haven't published the recommendations yet.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Margo: Jack, where are you?",
        "Jack: I guess I'm a little distracted. Sorry.",
        "Margo: What, the kids?",
        "Jack: No, no. Thankfully everyone's on an even keel at the moment.",
        "Margo: That's a blessing.",
        "Jack: What's going on with Casey?",
        "Margo: Counting the hours until his whole life blows up.",
        "Jack: And you are, too -- I'm sure.",
        "Margo: Yeah, Tom and I have to keep reminding each other that his being home is just temporary. It's so hard to remember the real story.",
        "Jack: Yeah, denial? Never heard of it. So, when those recommendations are published, you'll be sure I get a copy?",
        "Margo: Is it my sister that you're not talking about?",
        "Jack: Katie? Why would I avoid talking about Katie?",
        "Margo: I don't know. You tell me. I mean, the last we touched on the subject, you were going to get a hold of her?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, she had to go out of town.",
        "Margo: She didn't tell me that she was going anywhere.",
        "Jack: Left with my brother.",
        "Margo: Katie and Brad? Where?",
        "Jack: Some country inn up in Woodley?",
        "Margo: Together?",
        "Jack: Together.",
        "Margo: And that note I'm hearing in your voice, that would be jealousy?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Katie and Brad are fully clothed lying next to each other, Katie dreams of kissing Brad, she snuggles next to Brad and wakes up]",
        "Brad: Morning, Sunshine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Is there anything else from Carly? Or whoever's pretending to be her?",
        "Gwen: No. You and Maddie are right. That first email couldn't have been from Carly. Otherwise, she would have sent me more asking me why I didn't get back to her.",
        "Will: Unless she was afraid, but she has to know that you wouldn't turn her in.",
        "Gwen: Of course I wouldn't. The thing is, is that even though I know that the email wasn't from her, I can't help wishing that it was.",
        "Will: You miss her.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, a lot. And if she would have needed me to go up to Montana, I would've done it, you know, in a second. Whoever sent that email must have known that. Then -- never mind.",
        "Will: Well, say it. Just say it. I mean, you have the right to be sad or mad or whatever.",
        "Gwen: I mean, it's just whoever -- whoever pretended to be my sister must have been pretty sick.",
        "Will: Well, we know who it was. It was Jade or Adam or both.",
        "Gwen: And it's never going to stop, is it? I mean, Jade or Adam -- they're going to keep coming after us and pushing and pushing until they make our lives as miserable as they possibly can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jade: Cleo! Cleo, come on! Open up. Cleo? I got you checked out of this place. And I've got the car running. We've got to leave now or else we're going to miss the bus. What are you doing?",
        "Cleo: What does it look like I'm doing?",
        "Jade: It looks like you're being Gwen. Except that's over, Cleo. We're done. You're not even packed.",
        "Cleo: I'm not going.",
        "Jade: Of course you are. I don't even know why I thought this stupid plan would work in the first place. Listen, just get your stuff in the bag, so I can take it out to the car.",
        "Cleo: You don't get it. I'm not leaving town. The more I think about it, the more I know I can do it on my own. I don't need you anymore, Jade.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Katie? Katie, relax.",
        "Katie: Don't tell me to relax! I just woke up in a bed with you!",
        "Brad: Look at yourself.",
        "Katie: Look at yourself!",
        "Brad: No, I mean, look down. You're dressed. Head to toe. So am I. Nothing happened.",
        "Katie: Oh, thank God. Oh, what is that pounding?",
        "Brad: That would be the champagne we finished off.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. Oh, no. It's all coming back to me. It didn't work, did it? My big plan was a big flop.",
        "Brad: It was not a complete flop.",
        "Katie: Henry and Vienna aren't here. They didn't get back together, did they? We didn't even get them here to the inn.",
        "Brad: You've just got to look at the bright side.",
        "Katie: How did they figure it out? I don't get it. I mean, Henry says that he's not in love with her, but I know him. I know if we got them here on neutral territory, without the pressure of the wedding, they would have gotten back together. They would have seen something in each other that they didn't see before. Why are you looking at me like that?",
        "Brad: Like what?",
        "Katie: Like you can't believe that I would honestly want for someone else's happiness. I'm not that selfish, Brad. I wanted this for Henry. I really did.",
        "Brad: And I'm not a total jerk. I mean, I can see how hard you worked to make things happen for your buddy. I mean, it was sweet.",
        "Katie: Well, what good did it do if it didn't work?",
        "Brad: I'll tell you what good it was, all right? We had a hell of a lot of fun last night. You know what your problem is? You know what your problem is, Katie? You underestimate the value of fun.",
        "Katie: I do not. I am fun! I am!",
        "Brad: You're right. You're right. You know, last night, you climbed the fun meter a little bit. You know, I would even give you a nine out of ten.",
        "Katie: Oh, I didn't know we were getting scored. How did I score so high?",
        "Brad: Well, you were laughing. And you were actually talking to me. And you know, you kicked my butt at the board game you made me play.",
        "Katie: Yeah, we did kind of have fun, didn't we?",
        "Brad: And the champagne? What about the champagne?",
        "Katie: The verdict on that is still out until this aspirin kicks in. And now, let's see what I look like. I'm so scared. Ohh, ohh. Look at my eyes. They're so red. I hope I can get this redness out before we get to camera.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. Okay, yeah. We got to get the lead out. Because otherwise, Oakdale Now is going to turn into Oakdale Later. Okay, um, let's flip a coin to see who gets the shower first? Ready?",
        "Katie: Everything really is a game with you, isn't it?",
        "Brad: Well, isn't life better that way? Heads.",
        "Katie: Tails.",
        "Brad: I go first. Okay, so hey, what made you wake up anyway?",
        "Katie: I don't know. It was a dream or something.",
        "Brad: Was it a good dream?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Yeah, it was amazing.",
        "Brad: See, I have that effect on women. Owwwwwww!",
        "Katie: What? What happened?",
        "Brad: Oh, man. The damn razor just shredded my chin.",
        "Katie: No, no, don't let me see it. Just put pressure on it. Here, I'll help you.",
        "Brad: Sorry. It slipped. I didn't mean to give you more than you bargained for this morning.",
        "Katie: Its okay, Brad. Your little secret's safe with me.",
        "Brad: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, nobody is going to hurt us.",
        "Gwen: They already have. Somebody pretending to be my sister to get me to go to Montana.",
        "Will: Jade. But she didn't succeed, did she?",
        "Gwen: Only because you figured it out and you called her and you terrified her. What if she's working with Adam again, Will? What if they come up with something and we're not ready for it?",
        "Will: Adam's not going to be able to do anything. If he even shows his face here, he's going to get thrown in jail.",
        "Gwen: And what about me?",
        "Will: What about you?",
        "Gwen: I didn't go to jail. Doesn't that seem unfair?",
        "Will: Oh, Gwen, stop it.",
        "Gwen: No, I'm serious. I got off too easy. I've never had to pay for anything that I've done.",
        "Will: You have been. Adam's made you pay in a thousand ways. He played on your guilt. He followed you up the Michigan, he tried to rape you. Isn't that punishment enough?",
        "Gwen: No --",
        "Will: You've been paying every day since.",
        "Gwen: No, it's not the same.",
        "Will: We can't let Adam and Jade get to us. If they're going to play games, fine. We let them. But we're going to be ready for them. We'll see it coming a mile away. We have nothing to be afraid of.",
        "Gwen: Do you have any idea how much I wish I could believe that?",
        "Will: So, believe it.",
        "Gwen: You know, there is one good thing that came out of all this.",
        "Will: What's that?",
        "Gwen: I know that I can count on you for anything for the rest of my life.",
        "Will: So, why then don't you believe me when I say that all the bad stuff is behind us?",
        "Gwen: It's not that I don't believe you. It's just how can you be so sure?",
        "Will: Because I just know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: This was my plan, my idea and now it's over.",
        "Cleo: You know what? If you want to stop, that's fine. That's your deal. That's your decision. But I've worked too hard, I've studied too hard and I've put in way too many hours to just throw up my hands and walk away. I have skills now and I'm going to use them.",
        "Jade: Why? There's no more money. There's nothing in it for you.",
        "Cleo: Sure there is. It's like you said from the very beginning, this could be the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me.",
        "Jade: Oh my God, this is about Will, isn't it?",
        "Cleo: Yeah. I can't wait to get close to him.",
        "Jade: Sit down.",
        "Cleo: You're wasting your breath.",
        "Jade: Listen to me. I know you think that you know everything there is to know about Gwen, but you don't.",
        "Cleo: You said that you told me everything.",
        "Jade: Yeah, okay. But you think I didn't hold anything back, for insurance? I'm not stupid. And if you try and pull this off on your own, you can get into a lot of trouble.",
        "Cleo: I'll take my chances.",
        "Jade: How? The whole plan was based on getting Gwen out of town so you could replace her. But she didn't take the bait.",
        "Cleo: So?",
        "Jade: So? Hello? There cannot be two Gwens running around town.",
        "Cleo: I guess I'm just going to figure out a way to deal with that.",
        "Jade: How? Cleo, listen to me. I know it really sucks to work really hard on a project that isn't going to take off. Okay, but think about it this way, you had some fun, you made some money. Think of it like, um, show business. Some shows take off, and some shows don't. And this one didn't.",
        "Cleo: No, look, I know that I don't have all of the details worked out yet, but I will. And in the end, it's going to be worth it.",
        "Jade: What do you think is going to happen?",
        "Cleo: I'll get to be with Will. He's the greatest.",
        "Jade: Cleo, I know you think you have a crush on Will, because you've been playing Gwen. But you're not Gwen. You're Cleo. And the only place you're going to go if you keep this up is jail. And I'm sure as hell not going to go there with you.",
        "Cleo: You said that everything was legal!",
        "Jade: Listen, I didn't really think it through, okay? Playing dress-up is one thing, but when you get into actually impersonating somebody, you can get sued for fraud, okay? And that's another reason why I'm calling this off, because I don't want to get into that kind of trouble. And I know you don't either.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Cleo: What is it?",
        "Jade: It's my cousin, Luke. I told him I was going to pick up Natalie and I'm running late because of you. Listen to me, here's what you're going to do. You're going to take a cab over to Gwen and Will's. Here, you're going to take a cab over to Gwen and Will's. They should be at class --",
        "Cleo: You're letting me go over to their house?",
        "Jade: Cleo, you have to return the clothing that you stole before Gwen realizes it.",
        "Cleo: Why don't you do it?",
        "Jade: Because Will practically threatened my life over the phone about the email from Carly. There is no way I'm setting foot anywhere near their place. Anyway, would you listen to me? There's a key underneath the pot at the door. Go in, replace their stuff, okay? And meet me by the bus station. I want to make sure you're on that bus.",
        "Cleo: Okay.",
        "Jade: All right, Cleo. Make it really fast. Get in and get out. You got it?",
        "Cleo: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Did you do this for me?",
        "Will: Yeah, if I say I'm going to take care of you, I'd better put my mustard where my mouth is, right?",
        "Gwen: I love you. You're the best.",
        "Will: Okay, come on. Have fun at class.",
        "Gwen: Wait, aren't you coming with me?",
        "Will: Oh, I forgot to tell you, Mr. Stevens had to cancel class today, so I don't have to go to school for like an hour.",
        "Gwen: Oh, okay. I'll see you later then?",
        "Will: You bet.",
        "Gwen: Okay, I love you.",
        "Will: Hey, Marcus -- what's up? It's Will. Can you take notes for me in Lit class today? No, no, I'm fine. I just -- I can't be there. I've got something I gotta do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Listen Katie, about earlier --",
        "Katie: Don't worry about it. I was married several times. Seeing a guy naked is no big deal.",
        "Brad: Well, speaking of big deals, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.",
        "Katie: Of course you did. Such a liar. That's exactly what you wanted to do. And now you're fishing for a compliment.",
        "Brad: Well?",
        "Katie: Okay -- you, like some of Michelangelo's statues, have a certain sculpted quality.",
        "Brad: You think?",
        "Katie: Not an inch wasted. [Laughter] This, however, is a total waste.",
        "Brad: Oh, you're not still upset about Henry and Vienna, are you? Come on.",
        "Katie: No, not really.",
        "Brad: So, what's going on? What's -- what's happening with you?",
        "Katie: I don't know. When I was at the farm yesterday and Jack walked in, I was holding this sexy thing, before he knew what it was for, he kind of looked at me like he was really happy to see me.",
        "Brad: Well, he's a guy. Skimpy, sexy things make us smile.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know, but it was more than that. It was like he had something to say.",
        "Brad: About what?",
        "Katie: I don't know. I was too flustered to let him get it out. He would start talking, and then I would start talking, and then you walked in, and the moment was just kind of lost.",
        "Brad: Damn. I didn't mean to throw a wet blanket on something sparking between you two.",
        "Katie: No, you see, that's just it. I don't know if there was anything. I mean, I'm not sure if I'm making too big of a deal out of this. It's just -- I don't know though. I just have this feeling that he was going to say something important, and I can't get it out of my mind.",
        "Brad: Okay, I don't mean to be a killjoy, but I don't think my brother, who I love very much, by the way, was going to pour his heart out to you.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Brad: Well, think about what he does for a living. I mean, he's -- you know, guys that wear a badge, they're not really into sharing their feelings.",
        "Katie: Well, Jack seems pretty straightforward to me.",
        "Brad: Yeah, he's straightforward, but you know, but not if it gets too personal, you know. I just don't think he's going to be putting his heart on his sleeve any time soon. You know what they say about everybody having that one big love? Jack had his.",
        "Katie: Oh, you think he still has a thing for Carly? That he's still stuck on her?",
        "Brad: Like a big wad of gum.",
        "Katie: I don't know. I have to disagree. I mean, yeah, of course, he's always going to love her. He's always going to have a place for her in his heart. They have kids together. But, Jack knows it's over for him and Carly.",
        "Brad: Okay, will you listen to experience? All right, there was a time we were both going after Carly. The woman is in his blood. Still is.",
        "Katie: All right, well, not after all the things she's done. And I'm not just talking about leaving with Simon.",
        "Brad: Okay, I feel that we got to a certain place last night where we can be honest with each other, right? I just don't think my brother is going to be able to kick his Carly habit anytime soon, Katie.",
        "Katie: You weren't here when they broke up. She did things that just crossed the line. She compromised Jack's job. She put her whole family in jeopardy. She did selfish things that are unforgivable. That's why Jack divorced her. She wanted him back, too, after that. And he didn't go back to her.",
        "Brad: Okay, I'm not going to argue with you. You're going to see what you wanted to see. But I know what I know. You know, and Jack's -- you know, he's always going to be stuck on Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: And in case you thought I was ignoring your advice, I tried to call Katie.",
        "Margo: And what happened?",
        "Jack: Well, before I could get to a phone, Brad was calling me saying that he'd had too much to drink and they were spending the night at that inn.",
        "Margo: So you have reason to believe that Katie was with him?",
        "Jack: Yes, I heard her in the background. But instead of telling her that I was on the phone, he made some big point of saying, goodnight, Emma. Click. I swear sometimes he's still in the second grade.",
        "Margo: Well, he didn't want Katie to know that was you on the phone.",
        "Jack: Right, Margo, but why?",
        "Margo: Because he's always been highly competitive with you, Jack. He's jealous. He thinks that there's feelings going on between you and Katie. He wants to nip it in the bud. Can you get a clue here, Detective?",
        "Jack: Why would he be jealous, though? It's not like he and Katie get along all that well.",
        "Margo: Well, I heard that they're getting along better.",
        "Jack: It's got to be the competitive thing. It's got to.",
        "Margo: Well --",
        "Jack: He's just trying to push my buttons or something.",
        "Margo: Why don't you talk to him, see if he can give you an answer?",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Margo: Well, if you can't get an answer from your brother, I know where you can.",

        "Margo: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: I tried that.",
        "Margo: Well, try again because she just might have the straight story on this. What is wrong with you, Jack? Never mind, don't answer that. Don't answer that. This is something that cops are notoriously bad at.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Margo: Just keeping things inside.",
        "Jack: Okay, I'm not doing this with you, Margo. It's uncomfortable at best --",
        "Margo: Jack, you're such a great guy. You -- you're a good cop. You are a great father and partner. And when Carly left you, you just shut down. And you never dealt --- never dealt with your feelings.",
        "Jack: You don't have to whisper, I know what those are.",
        "Margo: Well, of course you do. I've seen you with Parker. I've seen the way that you listen to him. And you got support for him. And could use a little for yourself.",
        "Jack: Hey, he's a kid. He needed the help.",
        "Margo: Jack, it's the 21st century. You don't have to suffer in silence just because you're an adult male. Will you talk to somebody? Talk to a friend, get some professional help, talk about your feelings. And then maybe you won't be so tongue-tied when it comes to getting things clear with Katie.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I guess I have been doing a dance with her, haven't I?",
        "Margo: Yes, you have. And you know what? Dating is hard and you are out of practice.",
        "Jack: Are you still up on the Wilcock case?",
        "Margo: Yeah. The son needs to be questioned.",
        "Jack: And he works in the same building as the studio where Katie tapes her show, right?",

But, and please, you have to tell me if you think that I'm interfering -- but, I brought you clothes! Clothes! So, just -- here they are. I'm thinking of toying with bringing my company back up again.",

        "Barbara: Well, I know they're a little more conservative than what you usually wear, but I thought they must be fresh enough to appeal to someone your age.",
        "Cleo: And you really -- you really designed these while you were thinking about me? I mean, nobody's ever done anything like that before.",

        "Cleo: Yeah, well, you know, I think Will and I are in a good place now. You know, I feel like we're just getting to know each other. Again, I mean.",

Okay, I know things were kind of weird when I was here yesterday, so I thought maybe we can clear the air. Maybe I'm just weird and he's not interested and I'm making a fool out of myself.",

        "Jade: No. I don't need to threaten you, Gwen. I don't need to do anything. In fact, I don't need to call the police, I don't need to get Adam to come back to town -- I don't have to do squat.",
        "Gwen: Then, what are you talking about?",
        "Jade: I think you know what I'm talking about. You put some really bad energy out there, Gwen. What goes around comes around, and I don't have anything to do with it. But you are going to pay. And you're going to pay big.",

        "Barbara: Honey, after everything that happened, everything that Adam and Jade did to you, Adam attacked you -- he tortured you for weeks. He let you think that you had killed him. How can you be casual with something like that?",
