        "Meg gets an eyeful of Paul and Sophie, as Paul leaves a half dressed Sophie and races after Meg. Chris and Allison make plans for dinner, but when Kim reminds him later that he had plans with her and Bob, Chris has an idea. Margo asks Casey if he wants to see Matt before he heads to Statesville. Casey doesn't want to, but Emily convinces him to go, but she sends him on his way with a listening device \u0096 unknown to Casey. Paul chases Meg to Mike's pleading with her to talk with him. Mike calls security when Paul becomes out of control and he is soon hauled away. Casey and Matt talk and afterwards Casey finds the recording device. Allison reluctantly agrees to Chris' plan that she joins him and his parents for dinner. Casey confronts Emily about her manipulating him and the situation with the recording device. Mike suggests Meg get a restraining order against Paul, as she finally agrees. Kim offends Allison by accident causing her to excuse herself. Sophie comes to bail Paul out, as Paul and Meg come face to face and Paul tells her that Sophie was a mistake. Emily and Casey work things out and decide to have dinner. Emily sees Allison with Chris and finds out they are having dinner with his parents and leaves in a huff. Mike and Paul come to blows and Meg gets her restraining order. Sophie gets Paul released, but walks out on him. Allison wonders if they should rethink getting into a relationship, as Chris convinces her to give their relationship a try and pleads with her to come back to the table. Bob, Kim, Chris, and Allison decide to try again, as Allison saves a man from choking, which impresses Bob, Kim and Chris not to mention the man and the rest of the restaurant. Casey follows Emily, and they talk even though Emily tries to push him away. They end up making a bet involving a pool game, which Casey ends up winning hands down; so they continue on to get dinner. Sophie shows back up to see Paul and ask if he meant what he said to Meg about them being a mistake? Chris asks Allison upstairs for a nightcap. Paul tries to explain to Sophie why they wouldn't work, but Sophie is sure enough for the two of them; she loves him for who he is and would do anything for him. Meg and Mike lean on each other, as she is sure Paul has already moved on. Emily and Casey share dinner and enjoy each other's company. Once upstairs, Allison becomes unsure about things after she realizes what Chris shared with Emily and leaves quickly. Paul and Sophie start things back up where they were interrupted before \u0096 on the couch kissing and taking off each other's clothes. Katie: Would you excuse us for just a second? Come here. Well, my dear, you have arrived. This is so classic. Old girlfriend comes out of the woodwork --"

        "Paul: Meg! Meg!",
        "Alison: Hey, stranger. Where you been?",
        "Chris: Assisted on a quintuple bypass with complications. It wasn't pretty. Thought I was gonna be in the O.R. all night.",
        "Alison: Well, my shift's almost over. You?",
        "Chris: Just got to ditch the scrubs, and I'm all yours.",
        "Alison: Good, 'cause I'm gonna buy you dinner tonight to thank you for taking such good care of me. Still can't believe I spent my first day of nursing school puking my guts out.",
        "Chris: Well, I did take the oath to heal the sick, but, in your case, it was my pleasure.",
        "Alison: Well, either way, I still owe you a steak, whatever you want. Your pick.",
        "Chris: Sure you feel up to it?",
        "Alison: I'm fine. Yeah, actually, my appetite is kind of back with a vengeance. You know, you order the prime rib, and I'll just eat the whole cow.",
        "Chris: Well, man, now, this I got to see.",
        "Alison: Okay, well, just give me five minutes to file these, uh, sign out, and I'm good to go.",
        "Chris: All right. Sounds like a plan.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Kim: Hello.",
        "Chris: Mom?",
        "Kim: Hi.",
        "Chris: I didn't see you.",
        "Kim: Got your eye on a cute nurse?",
        "Chris: Nursing student.",
        "Kim: Really? Hmm.",
        "Chris: So, uh, what brings you to Memorial?",
        "Kim: Well, I'm here to pick you and your dad up for dinner.",
        "Chris: Oh, Mom, I completely forgot.",
        "Kim: Christopher! I e-mailed you to confirm.",
        "Chris: I know, and I don't have an excuse, but I made other plans, and now I have a date.",
        "Kim: So, now we're back to the cute nursing student?",
        "Chris: Alison Stewart.",
        "Kim: You're kidding. Oh. I wonder what Emily's gonna have to say about that one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey. Before I go, they need your John Hancock on this so everyone gets paid.",
        "Emily: Oh.",
        "Casey: Including me, so don't forget.",
        "Emily: Congratulations.",
        "Casey: What? I got a raise already? Oh, my God. Thanks.",
        "Emily: Oh, you so wish. No, for getting through your first day of work without some madman making threats. [Telephone rings] Oh, maybe I spoke too soon.",
        "Casey: Uh, mind if I use your phone?",
        "Emily: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Casey: Emily Stewart's office.",
        "Margo: Hey, Casey, it's Mom.",
        "Casey: I'll be home soon, Mom. You don't have to bug me at work.",
        "Margo: Uh, no, this is an official bug.",
        "Casey: Am I in trouble?",
        "Margo: No, no, not at all. It's -- Matt O'Connor is here, and, uh, he asked me to call. He wanted to see you before he got shipped off to Statesville.",
        "Casey: Forget it. I have nothing to say to him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I don't need Emily's permission to go out to dinner with her sister.",
        "Kim: I didn't say you needed her permission. I just meant she's gonna have a fit.",
        "Chris: Well, if she has a problem with Alison and me being friends, too bad. It's none of her business.",
        "Kim: I just had hoped that you had learned your lesson, for crying out loud.",
        "Chris: Can we skip the lecture, please, Mom?",
        "Kim: Well, now, just let me see. You were engaged to Alison, and you broke up because of Emily, and then you left town, and then you came back to town with Emily, and then you broke up with Emily, and you're back to Alison now. That is quite a merry-go-round.",
        "Chris: Well, you know those signs at amusement parks that say you have to be this tall to take this ride? I made the cut a couple years ago, Mom. I don't need parental permission, okay?",
        "Kim: Kiddo, my advice to you is, fasten your seat belt. You're gonna have a bump or two ahead.",
        "Chris: Thank you for your concern, Mom, but I know what I'm doing.",
        "Kim: You think?",
        "Chris: Positive.",
        "Kim: Okay, then, why don't you invite Alison to join us for dinner?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Tell Matt I said, have a nice life.",
        "Margo: Well, Matt told me he thought you wouldn't want to see him.",
        "Casey: Hmm. He was right.",
        "Margo: Honey, I know that he worked with Nevins, and he put our lives in dangers, but, ultimately, he did tip us off, and he'd like to apologize. Come on. He'd like to make it up to you.",
        "Casey: I'm not interested.",
        "Margo: You sure?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I'm sure. See ya. I'm sorry about that.",
        "Emily: That's okay. Is everything all right?",
        "Casey: Yeah. I was in jail with this guy, Matt O'Connor. He was working for Nevins, and because of him, my mom and dad and Alison could've been killed. And now he wants to make nice with me? Yeah, I don't think so.",
        "Emily: Well, I -- I think you should reconsider.",
        "Casey: You're kidding.",
        "Emily: No, I'm not. I definitely think you should go see Matt.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Mike, are you there? It's Meg.",
        "Mike: Meg, what -- what's wrong?",
        "Meg: It's Paul. I saw him --",
        "Mike: What happened? Where? When?",
        "Meg: He was, uh -- I went to his place, and uh --",
        "Mike: Just now?",
        "Meg: Yeah, yeah, and he was -- [Sighs] he was with Sofie. And --and they were. They didn't know I was there.",
        "Mike: Oh, Meg, I'm so sorry.",
        "Meg: Why -- why did I even go there? I mean, Paul -- Paul tells me that he wants me and he would do anything to be with me. And then that day -- that very same day, I find him with another woman. I mean, what kind of fool am I?",
        "Mike: It's okay.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Paul: Meg! Meg! Meg, come on. I know you're in there. Please open the door. Huh?",
        "Mike: Go away.",
        "Paul: I can explain.",
        "Mike: Ryan, she does not --",
        "Paul: You stay out of this. Meg! Meg, I love you! Meg, please forgive me! Please!",
        "[Banging on door]",
        "Paul: Come on, Meg, open up. Come on, Meg. Meg!",
        "Meg: No! Mike already told you, I don't want to see you! Go away!",
        "Paul: No, I'm not leaving until I get you to understand!",
        "Mike: I'm gonna call security. They'll get rid of him.",
        "Paul: Look! I swear, Sofie means nothing to me --nothing! I -- I --",
        "Mike: Hi, this is Mike Kasnoff.",
        "Paul: I don't know what I was doing.",
        "Mike: Yeah, please send --",
        "Paul: I would never go near her, but you --",
        "Mike: --In the hallway.",
        "Paul: You shut me out, and I -- I went a little crazy, and --",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Meg --",
        "Meg: Go away. I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Paul: Look, I know I know that I hurt you. I know that. But if I hurt you, doesn't --",
        "Mike: Please.",
        "Paul: Doesn't that mean that you care? And if you care, can you give us another chance?",
        "Meg: You used up all your chances, okay? Leave me alone!",
        "Mike: You heard what she said!",
        "Paul: Now you stay out of this!",
        "Mike: Ryans!",
        "Paul: You stay out of this! Meg, open that door!",
        "Meg: No!",
        "Paul: Meg! Meg! You open this door now, or I'll break it down! You open the door!",
        "Security guard: Mr. Ryan, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.",
        "Paul: Meg!",
        "Security guard: You're disturbing our guests!",
        "Paul: Not going anywhere! Meg!",
        "Security guard: I'm afraid that I insist.",
        "Paul: Meg!",
        "[Banging on door]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Why the hell should I go see Matt? I mean, what good is it gonna do?",
        "Emily: Because your family was put through a terrible ordeal.",
        "Casey: Yeah, exactly. And I don't wanna dredge it up again.",
        "Emily: Yeah, especially when you're still blaming yourself for everything that happened.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Emily: I know you, Casey. And I'm sure you've been kicking yourself for bringing Matt in your family's life.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Emily: Well, it's not your fault. And -- and until you fully accept that and you get some closure, you're never gonna get past this. So my advice to you is you go down there, and you listen to whatever Matt has to say one more time. Just do it. It's the only way you're gonna get some peace of mind. Trust me. I'll go down to the station with you if you want. I'll be there.",
        "Casey: My mom would really love that, yeah. No, I'll go myself.",
        "Emily: You're doing the right thing.",
        "Casey: Can I clock out, boss?",
        "Emily: Sure. Oh, yeah, one more thing. Um, can you bring me the ad report before you leave?",
        "Casey: Hey, you got it.",
        "Emily: Thanks.",
        "Casey: Here you go.",
        "Emily: Oh, thank you.",
        "Casey: See you in the morning.",
        "Emily: See you in the morning.",
        "Casey: Take care.",
        "Emily: Good luck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, all set?",
        "Chris: That was my last patient.",
        "Alison: I hope you've worked up an appetite.",
        "Chris: Oh, I have, but, uh, I was wondering. Are -- are you open to a slight alteration in our plans for this evening?",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, if you don't want to get a steak or whatever, I could do Italian, Mexican.",
        "Alison: But this isn't about the food, is it?",
        "Chris: What would you say to dinner at the Lakeview with my parents?",
        "Alison: Are you crazy? No. No way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hi. So, you changed your mind about saying good bye to Matt?",
        "Casey: No, Emily convinced me to come here. And don't say anything.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, all right. You're just in time. Transport for Statesville just arrived, so he'll be escorted down soon. He's right in there. Honey -- I know how hard this is for you.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I remember being shipped off, you know.",
        "Margo: I remember.",
        "Matt: Casey. I didn't think you'd come, man.",
        "Casey: Wasn't sure I should.",
        "Matt: I'm -- I'm glad you did. Look, I -- I really messed up.",
        "Casey: You think?",
        "Matt: No, I'm -- you were my friend. I should've warned you and your parents a lot sooner about Nevins. I know that. I just -- Dude, at this point, I don't -- I can only say what I've said already. I'm sorry. Really. I -- I thought about turning him in, but I knew Nevins would come after me and kill me, and --",
        "Casey: Which he did anyway. I just --",
        "Matt: Dude, I know. I learned that lesson a little bit too late, okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, whatever. It's -- whatever.",
        "Matt: Casey, one more thing. You're a good guy. You're too good. You're too trusting sometimes.",
        "Casey: Right, right, yeah, and you sure took advantage of that. And I'll -- I'll know better next time.",
        "Matt: Anyway, I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I'm sorry you were a friend I -- I couldn't trust.",
        "Matt: Your, uh, parents talked to the judge. Yeah, they got my sentence reduced, so -- which I probably don't deserve, but I wanted to let you know that I'm grateful. If there's ever anything I can do to make this up to you -- you --",
        "Casey: Just take care of yourself, man.",
        "Margo: It's time. Honey, you okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I'm fine. I -- I got to go. I'm sorry. What the hell is --?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I didn't mean to freak you out, Ali.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I was feeling better, but dinner with your parents makes me feel like I'm gonna hurl again.",
        "Chris: Come on, it's not gonna be that bad! Yeah, well --",
        "Chris: Oh.",
        "Alison: You know, it's just -- it's not like we're seriously dating here. I mean, we're just friends, right?",
        "Chris: Yeah. Yeah, it's -- it's no big deal. It's dinner. A dinner that was on the agenda that completely slipped my mind.",
        "Alison: So you can't reschedule?",
        "Chris: No, unfortunately. Not when I'm trying to rebuild trust with my father.",
        "Alison: Right.",
        "Chris: You know, you -- you'd really help me out if you -- you came along and kind of split the focus.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah. Okay, so, I could catch all the incoming bombs and missiles, just like back in the old days.",
        "Chris: It's not gonna be like that. Actually, it was -- it was my mother's idea to invite you.",
        "Alison: You're kidding?",
        "Chris: No. She was -- she was pretty cool about it.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Chris: I would have such a better time if you were there with me.",
        "Alison: Now you're not playing fair.",
        "Chris: If you don't want to, I, you know, totally understand.",
        "Alison: Okay, fine, fine. If it's that important to you, I will go.",
        "Chris: Thank you.",
        "Alison: But you owe me, big-time.",
        "Chris: I will make it worth your while.",
        "Alison: Yeah? How about another dress?",
        "Chris: How about two?",
        "Alison: I'm kidding. You don't have to get me a dress. Oh, no, I do need a dress. I need to wear something that your mother would actually like.",
        "Chris: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, do not dress like my mother. That would totally mess me up.",
        "Alison: Well, you deserve it. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: He's gone.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Meg: Sounded like it got pretty rough out there with the security guard.",
        "Mike: Yeah, I told you, Meg, the guy has got serious anger-management issues.",
        "Meg: I'm almost afraid to leave.",
        "Mike: You could get a restraining order.",
        "Meg: You know, my brother mentioned that a few weeks ago, and I told Holden it was a bad idea.",
        "Mike: Well, maybe -- maybe it's time to reconsider. You know, if you ask me, that's the only way a guy like Paul Ryan is gonna keep his distance.",
        "Meg: You could be right.",
        "Mike: Come on, I'll take you down the police station.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: How the hell did this get in my -- it's voice-activated?",
        "Margo: Yep, that's what they do.",
        "Casey: Who would want to plant a bug on me?",
        "Margo: Oh, I don't know. I'm going out on a limb. Your dirt-digging boss?",
        "Casey: Emily? No way! Why -- why would she do --",
        "Margo: Oh, Casey, grow up. She works for the -- she is \"The Intruder.\"",
        "Casey: But why would she do this?",
        "Margo: I don't know. Why don't you ask her yourself?",
        "Casey: Hey, Emily. What are you doing here? Chasing a story?",
        "Emily: No. No, actually, I got a message from Paul. I have no idea what it's about. He just asked me to come down right away, so here I am.",
        "Margo: Oh, well. Gang's all here. What's he charged with?",
        "Cop #2: Disturbing the peace, resisting arrest, assaulting a security guard.",
        "Cop #3: A real trifecta.",
        "Margo: All right, book him.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but book me quick. Let's get this paperwork over. Emily's here to bail me out.",
        "Emily: I'm not your guardian angel.",
        "Paul: No, you're my business partner. You're paid to watch my back.",
        "Emily: Paid to -- you know what? I've got better things to do. You are on your own.",
        "Margo: Yeah, you are on your own, Paul. Get him a mug shot. Make it pretty.",
        "Emily: Well, you look like you've been put through the wringer. How'd it go with Matt?",
        "Casey: Um -- you tell me. I'm glad you're not denying it, 'cause I know you planted it.",
        "Emily: Consider it the rites of initiation.",
        "Casey: What -- excuse me?",
        "Emily: You're in the news business, my friend. And I saw you had the makings of a great story, so, instead of having you take notes, I decided to streamline the process.",
        "Casey: You're not using my private conversation to sell your papers!",
        "Emily: Your private conversation would have made a great human-interest piece! I was handing you the scoop!",
        "Casey: Oh, that is crap! You're using me! And I'm not gonna let you get away with it again.",
        "[Margo laughs]",
        "Margo: I am biting my tongue so hard right now.",
        "Emily: Good. I hope it swells up so you can't talk anymore -- ever.",
        "Margo: I wouldn't blame Casey if he quit on you. Can't say as I didn't warn him.",
        "Margo: Bye.",

        "Kim: Alison, you look great. Love the dress.",
        "Alison: I thought you might like it.",
        "Chris: Alison always looks great.",
        "Bob: Alison, I'm glad that you could join us for dinner tonight. Your supervisor at the hospital has been telling me what extraordinary work you're doing.",
        "Chris: Well, that's probably why the nursing program snapped her up the minute she applied.",
        "Bob: Well, congratulations. Susan must be very proud that you're following in her medical footsteps.",
        "Kim: Just don't follow in her footsteps when it comes to men.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Will you stop making me run after you?!",
        "Casey: Oh, that was about as low as it gets.",
        "Emily: If I had asked you to wear a wire, what would you have said?",
        "Casey: No way.",
        "Emily: I rest my case.",
        "Casey: I didn't go in there to get you a damn story.",
        "Emily: What are you moaning about? Matt is a confessed criminal who's going to jail!",
        "Casey: Well, Matt is treating me a hell of a lot better than my boss is right now. At least he apologized. Did you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Hey. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it looks like you're spending the night with us.",
        "Paul: Yeah, great. I really thought I could count on Emily. Another mistake I made tonight. What's so funny? You know, get me a phone, will ya? Post bail another way?",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no. That's not how it works here.",
        "Paul: Oh, no, I know how it works around here. You commit a really big crime, then you get to walk your own brother who tried to blow me up with a bomb. You haven't done a thing about that.",
        "Margo: You're not making it any easier for yourself here, Paul.",
        "Paul: Maybe we should get that investigated with, you know, a grand jury and a special prosecutor.",
        "Margo: Fine! Fine. Make another phone call.",
        "Paul: Gee, thanks, Margo. You're a peach.",
        "Margo: Don't sweet-talk me. I'll change my mind.",

        "Emily: Yes, Sir. I'm sorry. Come on, let me -- let me buy you dinner. On me.",
        "Casey: What is that, like a bribe?",
        "Emily: No. Okay, it's a small bribe.",

        "Alison: It's fine. No worries.",
        "Kim: You know, I just wonder -- what is it between the Stewart women and the Hughes men?",
        "Bob: What do you say we change the subject?",
        "Kim: No, no, no, I'm really -- I'm really interested. I would like to understand -- what the dynamic is here.",
        "Chris: What dynamic?",
        "Kim: Well, you keep getting your hearts broken, and then you turn around and come back for more.",
        "Chris: I hope you're not expecting me to comment on that.",
        "Alison: For the record, um, Chris and I are just friends, that's all.",
        "Kim: Well, then I should commend you both because most people would find it very difficult to stay friends after everything that you've been through.",

        "Mike: She's here to get a restraining order.",
        "Margo: Uh, well, you know, actually, you have to go to a judge to get that. That probably won't happen until the morning. But the good news is, at least for tonight, it looks like Paul is gonna be behind bars.",

        "Sofie: I'm here to post bail for Paul.",

        "Meg: Especially after what I walked in on.",
        "Paul: Oh, Meg, it was a mistake. That was a mistake. I -- it was self- destructive and stupid, and I know that. That -- that -- that's what happens when you're not around. I -- I just -- I become unglued. I need you. Meg, please, I need you so much.",
        "Mike: Back off, Paul.",

        "Emily: Knock yourself out.",
        "Bob: What was in that seltzer?",
        "Kim: Nothing. Oh, just relax. I'm gonna keep my mouth shut the rest of the night.",
        "Bob: You know, I was hoping we could have one calm dinner with Christopher without needing a scalpel to cut through the tension. I think it's a good idea if certain topics are off-limits.",
        "Kim: Such as?",
        "Bob: Such as Emily. I heard enough about her from Tom today.",
        "Kim: What's she done now?",
        "Bob: Well, she's hired Casey to be her assistant.",
        "Kim: Casey is working at \"The Intruder\" for Emily? Holy smokes. That's a recipe for disaster.",
        "Bob: Hmm.",
        "Casey: These won't cut it. I need some real food. So why don't we go someplace quiet, get a nice meal?",
        "Emily: Yeah, so we can listen to all our fellow diners talking behind our backs?",
        "Emily: Can we just face it? Nobody wants to see us hanging out together, okay? Not -- not my sister, not Chris, and certainly not your mommy and daddy.",
        "Casey: I -- okay, I told you, my parents are cool with us working together.",
        "Emily: Working. Operative word. Okay, that doesn't mean having a nice little dinner for two or hanging out in bars.",
        "Casey: Hey, you offered to feed me. It wasn't my idea.",
        "Emily: Casey, go home. Okay, ask your mother to make you some mac and cheese. Just go. I'll see you at work.",
        "Casey: I got a better idea. How about a game of pool? If I lose, I'll get lost. But if you lose, you got to get me that dinner you promised, and you got to just stop feeling so sorry for yourself. So, what do you say, Boss? Game on?",
        "Alison: I don't usually agree with Emily, but she's right. We shouldn't be a couple. Been there, done that, and it ended badly.",
        "Chris: So, who says we can't do it right this time? Don't tell me you're gonna let Emily run your life.",
        "Alison: Of course not.",
        "Chris: Then why can't we give ourselves another chance, if -- if we both think we can make it work?",
        "Alison: Chris, this dinner with your parents is like d\u00e9ja vu all over again. I lived with you -- with them, remember? And they didn't like me then, and they don't seem to be finding any reasons to like me now. So what the hell are we doing?",
        "Chris: Forget about my parents. I don't care what they think of us. I care what we think of us. A lot has changed over the years. I mean, we're -- we're like totally different people now.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, yeah. You're a discredited ex-chief of staff, and -- and I'm an ex-porn star with a history of drug use. Oh, we're a perfect couple.",
        "Chris: So, we've both been beaten up by life. Gives us something in common. And, if you ask me, it earns us the right to make up our own mind -- not let anyone else tell us what to do. I really think we have something here, Ali, and I think we can make it work this time, so I'm willing to give us another shot. Are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: All right.",
        "Margo: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. I will find a judge tonight to issue an immediate restraining order. I'll get it to Meg in the morning.",
        "Mike: Thank you, Margo.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry it's come to this.",
        "Cop #3: Bail's posted.",
        "Margo: Good. Good, good. Good bye, good riddance, go. You violate that restraining order, you'll be back here so fast, your head will spin. Good night. [Paul sighs]",

        "[Emily chuckles]",

        "Alison: It's fine. No worries.",
        "Kim: You know, I just -- I have a tendency to be overprotective.",
        "Alison: I know. My mom is the same way, and so is my sister. I get it. Trust me.",

        "Casey: But, uh, tell me the truth. Did you have to check in with the overnight editor? Or are you still on that kick about not being seen in public with me?",
        "Emily: You really are full of yourself, aren't you?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I got that memo -- you know, from a guard at Statesville.",

        "Paul: Because it's wrong.",
        "Sofie: No. You're seeing the downside to everything right now, 'cause you're hurt. And why wouldn't you be? You lost Meg, and -- and she's not coming back.",
        "Paul: Well, at least you got that part right.",
        "Sofie: There's no reason why something good can't come out of today. And -- and if you'd be honest with yourself, you would see that the answer to all your problems is standing here, right in front of you.",
