        "Damian: Hello, Son. How's Noah doing?",
        "Luke: He's better. The doctors say he can be released soon.",
        "Damian: That's good news. Would it be all right if I stopped in to say hello?",
        "Luke: Actually, he just fell asleep, so maybe later. I was just getting some air.",
        "Damian: You were here all night.",
        "Luke: It's kind of a hard to leave him. I don't know what I would have done if I lost him.",
        "Damian: I feel the same way about you, Luciano.",
        "Luke: Well, we have a lot of people to thank for saving us, most importantly you.",
        "Damian: I did what any father would do to protect their son.",
        "Luke: Well, I owe you. Big time.",
        "Damian: In that case, why don't you join me for lunch? We can celebrate at the Lakeview.",
        "Luke: I think my parents are expecting me.",
        "Damian: No problem. I'll invite them, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, I'm back.",
        "Lily: Hi, Honey. How's Emma?",
        "Holden: She's great. She's cooking up a storm for Noah. How is he? Did you hear from Luke?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Luke just called. Noah's doing much better. He should be home soon.",
        "Holden: Well, that's good. Why don't you head over to the hospital, take the boys lunch?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lily: Where is that?",
        "Holden: In your purse?",
        "Lily: Yeah. If I could just find it. Oh! There we go.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Lily: That always happens.",
        "Holden: Did they leave a message?",
        "Lily: It's Damian. He wants to know if we want to join him and Luke for lunch at the Lakeview.",
        "Holden: Forget it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: We got to make this fast. I'm on deadline.",
        "Lucinda: Hi, Darling. Surely you have time for me.",
        "Emily: Lucinda, what are you doing here? I have a budget meeting with Dusty in five minutes.",
        "Lucinda: I canceled it. You and I, we need some face time.",
        "Emily: I thought you were still on medical leave.",
        "Lucinda: Supposedly I am, but I have -- I allow myself to work when I feel up to it, and my heavens, there's so much to do these days, especially with this economy.",
        "Emily: Okay. I know. I know the bottom line has taken a hit and ad revenues are down, but I was just about to tell Dusty I've come up with some creative solutions here. If we could just coordinate operations with both newspapers, the \"City Times\" and the \"Intruder,\" we could save a ton of money. We could share staff with marketing and payroll.",
        "Lucinda: Sorry, Darling. It's too late. As of today, the \"Intruder\" is no longer gonna be published.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: My parents are probably pretty busy.",
        "Damian: They wouldn't turn down a chance to have lunch with their son.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but it's kind of last-minute. Oh, there's Alison, somebody else I need to say thank you to.",
        "Damian: Go right ahead. I'll see you at the Lakeview. Ciao.",
        "Luke: Hey, Ali, you got a minute?",
        "Alison: Hey, Luke. I'm so glad Noah's feeling better.",
        "Luke: Oh, thank you. So am I, and we have a lot of people to thank, you included.",
        "Alison: Well, actually, Casey and Jade helped the most.",
        "Luke: Well, when Noah's 100%, we are gonna take you all out to celebrate.",
        "Alison: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Luke: All right, well, take care. I'll see you around, okay? And thank you again.",
        "Alison: No problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Mrs. Fletcher has a wicked crush on you.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I'm really in with the over-90 crowd.",
        "Jade: What is it with you and old ladies?",
        "Casey: Shut up! Actually, I'm in to young nurses. Hey, Ali!",
        "Alison: Oh!",
        "Casey: You want to go grab lunch?",
        "Alison: Actually, yes, I would. I worked the early shift, so I'm done for the day.",
        "Casey: Excellent. I'll take you out. My treat.",
        "Alison: Well, how can I refuse an offer like that? Should we invite Jade?",
        "Casey: You really want to?",
        "Alison: Why not? Hey, Jade, we're going to lunch. You want to come with us?",
        "Jade: Yeah, sure. I just got to file this, and I'll be right there.",
        "Casey: Okay, Ali. What are you up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How will Luke feel if we refuse to have lunch with him?",
        "Holden: I will have lunch with Luke anytime, but Damian, no can do.",
        "Lily: I thought the two of you were getting along.",
        "Holden: Yeah, because he was leaving town, but I don't want to go hang out with him. I don't want to socialize with him, okay?",
        "Lily: I don't think Luke's gonna feel comfortable having lunch with Damian alone. Why can't we be gracious?",
        "Holden: Because Damian doesn't deserve it.",
        "Lily: He's gonna be leaving town soon, and he did save our son's life and Noah's!",
        "Holden: Damian is the reason that Luke and Noah were in danger in the first place.",
        "Lily: Fine. You don't want to go, you don't have to. I'll go by myself.",
        "Holden: Oh, no, you don't.",
        "Lily: Nothing bad is gonna happen, Holden.",
        "Holden: Something bad always happens with Damian.",
        "Lily: It's just lunch. I'm going.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Hey, you still didn't answer my question. Why do you want Jade to come to lunch with us?",
        "Alison: You guys work together, you know, so I figured it would be rude not to invite her.",
        "Casey: Come on. There's got to be more to it.",
        "Alison: I was just being nice, Casey. Is that so hard to believe.",
        "Casey: It's a little weird.",
        "Alison: Me being nice?",
        "Casey: No. You being nice to Jade.",
        "Alison: Well, I don't know, I mean, I just feel like the three of us should be friends.",
        "Casey: The three of us?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Like close friends?",
        "Alison: Sure. Why not?",
        "Casey: How close?",
        "Alison: I don't know.",
        "Casey: Is this a test? Like you, me, Jade, lunch -- that's all?",
        "Alison: Yeah. What else?",
        "Casey: I was thinking maybe I could get a threesome out of it. I don't know.",
        "Alison: God, you're such a jerk! The only thing you're gonna get is a burger, if you're lucky!",
        "Casey: Hey, just throw a beer in, and I'll be there.",
        "Alison: Why do you have to make everything so dirty and complicated?",
        "Casey: Actually, threesomes aren't complicated.",
        "Alison: Shut up. Just shut up.",
        "Jade: All right. I'm ready. Where we going?",
        "Casey: The Wagon Wheel.",
        "Jade: That's a motel, not a restaurant.",
        "Casey: It has vending machines and vibrating beds.",
        "Alison: You're sick. Just stop it.",
        "Jade: What is with you two?",
        "Alison: Casey's just acting like a 13-year-old boy.",
        "Casey: I am taking two hot girls out. Man, I must be getting something right. Please.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: How can you just shut down this paper?",
        "Lucinda: The newspaper business has gone the way of the dinosaur. It's nearly extinct!",
        "Emily: Lucinda, I am doing better than 2/3 of our competition.",
        "Lucinda: I don't want a tiny piece of a shrinking pie.",
        "Emily: But we still have a viable business model. All we have to do is increase subscriptions.",
        "Lucinda: You know that's not true, Emily. That's not going to happen.",
        "Emily: Okay. This newspaper is in my blood. You used to feel the same way. How could you just give up?",
        "Lucinda: I'm not giving up. I'm making a shrewd business decision.",
        "Emily: By shutting us down? That's not shrewd. That's criminal!",
        "Lucinda: Just listen to me for a moment, please.",
        "Emily: No, no, no, no. How could I listen to you when you're trying to kill my baby?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Emily, get a grip on it!",
        "Emily: I am fighting for my life here, Lucinda!",
        "Lucinda: Listen to me for just a minute! Will you, please? Your baby's alive and kicking.",
        "Emily: Really? How do you figure that?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, we are not going to be publishing the \"Intruder\" on paper. It's going digital!",
        "Emily: Digital?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, 24/7 news available online, and your job is still available, if you choose to accept it.",
        "Emily: No. I'm sorry. I can't do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: This is cozy. Not as cozy as a hotel room.",
        "Alison: Okay. Don't push it, Casey.",
        "Casey: So, what do you guys want? My treat, you know, in honor of you guys saving Luke and Noah.",
        "Jade: Oh, come on. You worked just as hard.",
        "Alison: Let him be generous. He doesn't do it very often.",
        "Jade: Okay. I'll have a Jack cheeseburger and fries.",
        "Alison: Ooh, me too, and a diet anything.",
        "Jade: Same here.",
        "Casey: Mind if I have a beer?",
        "Alison: Be my guest.",
        "Casey: Okay. I'll be right back.",
        "Jade: Okay. So, you want to tell me why I'm really here?",
        "Alison: Hang out and have a good time with friends.",
        "Jade: Since when are we friends, Alison? Why did you invite me here?",
        "Alison: I was just trying to be nice. That's all.",
        "Jade: No. There's got to be more to it than that. Why are you trying to get on my good side?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: So, what do you plan to do when Noah gets out of the hospital?",
        "Luke: What do you mean?",
        "Damian: How will you celebrate?",
        "Luke: I don't know. It depends on Noah.",
        "Damian: Are you still going ahead with your plans to move in together?",
        "Luke: We're taking things one day at a time.",
        "Damian: But the two of you are still committed to each other?",
        "Luke: Yep, yep. You know, this is really weird.",
        "Damian: Yeah. Yeah, I understand.",
        "Lily: Damian, we got your message. Thank you for inviting us.",
        "Damian: It was my pleasure. Holden.",
        "Holden: Damian.",
        "Lily: Hi, Luke. How's Noah?",
        "Luke: Oh, he's good. Hi, Dad.",
        "Holden: Hey, Luke.",
        "Luke: Thanks for coming.",
        "Holden: Sure.",
        "Lily: Well, we couldn't refuse one last opportunity to thank Damian for everything he's done for you.",
        "Damian: Last opportunity? You make it sound so final.",
        "Holden: Yeah. The next time we're in Malta, we'll be sure to stop by and say hello.",
        "Damian: That won't be necessary. I mean, I may go back to Malta on occasional business, but once I'm settled here in Oakdale, I'm sure we'll see a great deal of each other.",
        "Holden: Since when are you staying in Oakdale?",
        "Damian: You didn't tell your parents?",
        "Lily: Tell us what?",
        "Luke: Oh, I was at the hospital all night with Noah. I didn't get a chance to tell them the news.",
        "Holden: What news?",
        "Damian: I've decided to stay in Oakdale. It's time I get to know my son better.",
        "Holden: Luke is my son, and I don't want you anywhere near him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Why are you and Casey so suspicious just 'cause I invited you to one stupid lunch?",
        "Jade: Maybe 'cause I tried to break you guys up.",
        "Alison: That was a while ago.",
        "Jade: Okay, I get it. Try and be my best friend so I don't take your guy.",
        "Alison: That is so twisted.",
        "Jade: Okay, but it's true, right?",
        "Alison: Okay, yeah, fine. It's true. Is it working?",
        "Jade: Maybe a little.",
        "Alison: Yeah? Maybe a lot? Come on.",
        "[Alison laughs]",
        "Casey: What's so funny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I thought we talked about this. I appreciate everything you did for Luke and Noah, and I accepted the fact that you weren't behind the kidnapping.",
        "Damian: So, why can't you accept the fact that I decided to stay in Oakdale?",
        "Holden: Because your presence here, well, it complicates things for Luke and for Lily, and when we talked, I thought we both agreed that it was best for everyone if you leave.",
        "Damian: And I meant it. I mean, not only was I resigned to going, but I was sincere when I said goodbye. Isn't that true, Lily?",
        "Lily: I hope so.",
        "Holden: So why aren't you going?",
        "Damian: I couldn't refuse my son. Luciano doesn't want me to go.",
        "Holden: This was your idea?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, I asked him.",
        "Holden: You did?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Holden: Okay, fine. Fine. Do whatever you want.",
        "Luke: Oh, come on. Dad, wait!",
        "Damian: Lily, I'm so sorry. I did not want to cause any trouble.",
        "Lily: But somehow you always do.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dad, Dad. Wait up. Let me explain.",
        "Holden: Luke, there's nothing to explain. If you want to have some kind of relationship with Damian, that's fine.",
        "Luke: It's not like that. It's complicated.",
        "Holden: I hope you're not doing it out of guilt. Damian, he rescued you and Noah, but you don't owe him anything.",
        "Luke: Dad, I'm not doing this for Damian. I'm doing it for me.",
        "Holden: You think there is an obligation here to learn more about where you come from?",
        "Luke: Oh, no. This is not about blood lines. I am a Snyder. I am not a Grimaldi. You're my dad, the only one I'll ever need. It's just I realize I know so little about Damian, and it's, like, I can't fully know myself until I open up those lines of communication with him, you know?",
        "Holden: You're nothing like Damian. You're a good person. You have a conscience.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but I think he might, too, and that's why he came back. Look, this is hard for me to admit, but I think Damian might not be as bad as we all think he is. Anyway, I need to find out for sure.",
        "Holden: All right, fine. I'm not gonna stop you. I just don't want to see you get hurt, or your mother.",
        "Luke: I won't let that happen. You got to trust me on this one.",
        "Holden: I do trust you. It's Damian I don't trust.",
        "Luke: I get that.",
        "Holden: Promise me you'll be careful.",
        "Luke: I will. But you promise me that you're not gonna think I'm rejecting you because of this.",
        "Holden: Not a chance. Don't you know by now you're stuck with me?",
        "Luke: Cool.",
        "Holden: Do what you need to do and know that I always have your back.",
        "Luke: Sounds good to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: What's the matter, Emily? What? Are you afraid of something? I thought you'd be absolutely thrilled that your services are still required.",
        "Emily: I know I can edit. That's not the problem, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: What is it?",
        "Emily: Beyond using the online thesaurus and sending e-mails, I am an idiot when it comes to the internet. This technology totally defeats me.",
        "Lucinda: Don't be silly. Don't be silly, for heaven's sake.",
        "Lucinda: I can still remember the brave new world of electric typewriters, yet I managed somehow to push myself into the 21st century.",
        "Emily: Lucinda, I do newsprint, not websites!",
        "Lucinda: Well, we are going to have to expand your horizon.",
        "Emily: What if I don't get the handle of it.",
        "Lucinda: I have faith in you, Emily -- total, total faith in you, whether you believe it or not, and all you need is to let other people help you.",
        "Emily: Why do I get the feeling you already have somebody in mind?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I have promoted a young man who -- from I.T. department, and he will be your co-editor.",
        "Emily: My co-what?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Emily: First you take away my newspaper, now you take away half my job title? You know what? I'm resigning. How's that? Lucinda!",
        "Lucinda: Don't you dare do that. I want you to meet him. He's charming, and you're gonna like him very much. Come along. This way. Don't move. This is the young man who's going to change your life. Hunter. Hunter, I'd like you to meet Ms. Emily Stewart. Hunter!",
        "Hunter: Sorry. I'm Hunter. Oh! It's okay. I got it.",
        "Emily: You're kidding, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: That burger wasn't bad.",
        "Alison: Definitely hit the spot.",
        "Casey: Yeah. At least you guys weren't throwing fries at each other.",
        "Alison: Yeah. He really wanted us to get into a catfight. It's a big turn-on for guys like Casey.",
        "Casey: Do you see what I put up with?",
        "Jade: Oh, you love it.",
        "Casey: Are you guys ready to tell me what's going on yet?",
        "Alison: Nothing. Right, Jade?",
        "Jade: Right.",
        "Casey: So I'm just imagining this incredibly awkward vibe?",
        "Jade: Look, Alison and I have come to an understanding.",
        "Casey: Really? About what?",
        "Alison: We decided that you're too obsessed with sex, so we're just gonna do everything we can to keep you from getting turned on.",
        "Casey: Are you planning to stop breathing?",
        "Alison: Oh! Flattery will get you nowhere, my friend. What do you think, Jade? Should we take pity on him?",
        "Jade: What? I'm sorry. What did you say?",
        "Alison: You should go for it.",
        "Jade: What do you mean? Just walk over there and say hi?",
        "Alison: Why not? Come on. What do you got to lose? I mean, he's looking right at you.",
        "Jade: No, he's not!",
        "Casey: Yes, he is. He thinks you're hot. I know that look.",
        "Alison: Yeah, you should. You make it like a thousand times a day.",
        "Casey: I do not!",
        "Alison: You do, too. Really, Jade, go over there, before he pays for his drink and leaves.",
        "Jade: It would feel weird.",
        "Alison: You never know. It might feel good. I mean, it might feel really good.",
        "Casey: Down, girl! Whu-psht!",
        "Alison: Come on. Jade saw him first. He's all hers.",
        "Jade: What should I say?",
        "Casey: Oh, like you need a lesson.",
        "Alison: Go and ask him to play a game of pool. I mean, he's not gonna bite.",
        "Casey: He might if you're lucky.",
        "Jade: Okay, I'll do it just to shut you guys up.",
        "Casey: Yes. Good. I thought she'd never leave.",
        "Alison: She did seem kind of shy, I mean, especially for Jade.",
        "Casey: Obviously, she has nothing to worry about.",
        "Alison: Yeah. I kind of figured that.",
        "Casey: So, tell me, is this what you planned all along?",
        "Alison: Not really, but it seems to be working out pretty well, don't you think?",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: So, is Hunter your first name or your last?",
        "Hunter: Last name.",
        "Emily: Do you have a first name?",
        "Hunter: You can call me Hunter. No \"Mister\" required.",
        "Emily: Okay, Hunter. What is he, 12?",
        "Lucinda: The internet is a primary source for information and entertainment in his demographic.",
        "Emily: Okay, but there still are child-labor laws, right, Lucinda?",
        "Hunter: I graduated college two years early. Then I went to grad school.",
        "Emily: Good for you. What did you get your degree in?",
        "Hunter: I have two -- database design and systems engineering.",
        "Lucinda: See? He's born -- born for the job. The young cut their teeth on computers.",
        "Emily: Well, he nearly broke his ankle on his laptop.",
        "Lucinda: He has many, many other qualities.",
        "Emily: He doesn't have a clue about what makes a good newspaper, does he?",
        "Lucinda: No, he does not have that. He does not. That is your job. His job is to take care of the online aspects of the news operation.",
        "Emily: Okay. I have news for you, Lucinda, off-line and off the record -- there's no way in hell this is gonna work!",
        "Lucinda: There's no choice, Emily. This is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. If you cannot work with Hunter and bring the \"Intruder\" successfully online, then you can join the ranks of the overqualified ex-editors on the unemployment line. Oh, my heavens! There's no response! Good. Fine. All right. Have fun, kids, and good luck.",

        "Damian: Lily, I decided to stay in Oakdale because I could be near my son. It was not to upset your husband.",
        "Lily: But you knew it would.",
        "Damian: All the more reason to start getting rid of all the tension in the family for Luke's sake.",
        "Lily: It's gonna take a lot more than a nice lunch for you to bond with Luke.",
        "Damian: I realize that.",
        "Lily: You hardly even know who Luke is. He's finally come to terms with his sexuality. He's very happy being with Noah. But he has some serious problems.",
        "Damian: Such as?",
        "Lily: Well, he's made some horrible mistakes. He got kicked out of college. That sent him into a downward spiral, and he started drinking again.",
        "Damian: I know that. With his medical history, that could be fatal.",
        "Lily: He's being very careful now. His work with the foundation has made him feel useful, but he still needs direction. He's looking to define himself.",
        "Damian: I can see that. And part of this is my fault.",
        "Lily: What do you mean?",
        "Damian: As his father, I'm part of what defines Luke. Perhaps that's why he asked me to stay, so to better understand who he is.",
        "Lily: I'm not even sure Luke knows why he asked you to stay -- guilt and appreciation, I suspect. But you wasted no time jumping at the invitation, regardless of how it would affect my entire family.",
        "Damian: So we're back to Holden.",
        "Lily: He's my husband, Damian!",
        "Damian: Very well, Lily. I'll leave it up to you. You tell me what to do. Should I go, or should I stay?",
        "Lily: It's not fair of you to put me in that position.",
        "Damian: Luke is a man now, and he's choosing to get to know me better. I consider that a blessing, but I will not pursue it if you tell me not to.",
        "Lily: First of all, I have to consider how Holden would feel.",
        "Holden: Lily, don't worry about me. If Luke wants to get to know Damian, it's up to him.",
        "Damian: Holden, I understand this must be difficult for you, and I appreciate your efforts, but I want to go on record that I will never do anything to hurt Luke.",
        "Holden: Believe me, I'll make sure that you don't. Enjoy your lunch. Lily, I'll see you later.",

        "Emily: That name has sold a lot of newspapers, Hunter.",
        "Hunter: Yeah, but that was when it was something people could hold in their hands, and now it's a completely different animal. So it has to adjust, redefine itself, starting with the name.",
        "Emily: Okay, okay. Let's just start with \"You couldn't be more wrong.\" The \"Intruder\" is our brand. We lose the brand, we lose reader loyalty.",
        "Hunter: But we need more than the same old readers. The whole point is to become a multi-platform information-delivery system that will appeal to people below median middle age.",
        "Emily: Right, right. So, in other words, we stop writing for grown-ups. We might as well be producing a video game.",
        "Hunter: Actually, video games can be instructive, in the way they lead to serial applications. The uses of rabbit holes, for example.",
        "Emily: Rabbit holes?",
        "Hunter: Well, not in the reality based sense, but in the overall matrix.",
        "Emily: Okay. Alice has gone through the looking glass.",
        "Hunter: I thought your name was Emily.",
        "Emily: Never mind. I'm gonna go out for some reality based lunch.",

        "Damian: But it was illegal.",
        "Luke: Well, they'll be able to get the money back, but apparently it's this very long and brutal process. In the meantime, the foundation's not gonna be able to see any of that money.",
        "Damian: Will that be a problem?",
        "Luke: Yeah. We've already committed cash to a couple of organizations that need the money right away. Like, there's this one where they deliver meals to elderly people who can't shop for themselves or cook.",
        "Damian: What will happen to those people?",
        "Luke: Well, a lot of them will go hungry if we can't subsidize them, and that's just about, you know, 1 of maybe 20 groups that we support.",

        "Hunter: Despite our platform differences, our new website can use multi- standard conforming interfaces in order to allow them to exchange graphics and synthesize diverse programs.",
        "Emily: Okay. That's not even English. And why do people in the I.T. department speak in tongues? And why is it when my computer crashes, they don't fix it? They just order me a new one?",

        "Alison: You're fired?",
        "Emily: No. But there's no more newspaper. I'm sorry. The \"Intruder\" will now be published online, and the boy toy you saw with me in there is my new business partner. He's supposed to, I don't know, make me more web savvy, help me interface.",

        "Holden: Yeah, and live to get away with it.",
        "Lucinda: Ha, ha. No executive likes to cut corporate fat and trim away, but I thought I was being quite creative. Everybody's paranoid.",
        "Lily: Budget cutbacks at Worldwide.",

        "Lucinda: I thought Lily said Damian was leaving.",
        "Lily: He was. Luke asked him to stay.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Luke wants to get to know his biological father, so I'll just have to find a way to live with that.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Holden's got the patience of job. I wouldn't -- I could be that generous.",
        "Lily: Luke has had a rough time. He doesn't need his parents fighting over him.",
        "Holden: So I'm not fighting.",

        "Holden: Oh. So much for the lack of influence from Damian.",
        "Lily: Luke, you don't need to get the cash from Damian. I'll fund the foundation.",
        "Luke: Oh, no, no. That's okay, Mom.",
        "Lily: I'm executive director on the board. It'll be much easier.",
        "Luke: I don't think you understand. I want this. Damian has caused so much trauma in my life. If he wants to try and make things better, I think the right thing to do is to let him.",

        "Hunter: That would be great.",
        "Alison: Okay. First of all, never, ever argue with her, okay? And, also, never try to correct her. Emily likes to be right all the time, which is really annoying, but you get used to it.",
        "Hunter: Promise?",
        "Alison: Look, what I do is just agree with her, and that way, she might actually listen to you a little.",
        "Hunter: Thanks. I'll try that.",

        "Hunter: Listen, I was thinking about what you said, and, you know, you're totally right.",
        "Emily: I am?",
        "Hunter: It would be a big mistake to change the \"Intruder's\" name on the website. Like you said, it's a brand. That's important. I'm sure we can make it work.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm glad you listened to me.",
        "Hunter: So, I'll be back tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.? If that's okay.",

        "Damian: That's what Luke wanted.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I know, but there's much more at stake here than you making amends to your son. Why? Because Lily and Holden will be affected by whatever you do.",
        "Damian: I mean them no harm.",
        "Lucinda: So you say. I don't know what you know. I don't know what you're aware of. They've been through bad times. Their marriage has been tested. At the moment, their marriage is stronger than it has ever been before.",
        "Damian: I'm sure it is. Look, I have no intention of interfering in Lily's marriage.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, please, please. I'm not brain-dead, even though you may want me to be. Look, Darling, if you have any thoughts of inserting yourself between them or causing any problems for my family, I want you to put that out of your mind right now because I will not allow it. Now, is that understood?",
        "Damian: Perfectly. You know, I'm just as protective of my loved ones. But with all due respect, Lucinda, unfortunately, you're not my mother-in-law anymore, so I don't need to listen to your lectures. Thanks for stopping by.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Holden, you can't expect me to give up my job at the foundation just because Damian's gonna be signing the checks for a while!",
        "Holden: Damian is handing over his own money for the foundation. That means he wants to be more involved.",
        "Lily: Yes, with Luke. Not with me.",
        "Holden: Yes, he wants to get closer to Luke, and that's fine. It's okay with Luke. But he also wants to get closer to you.",
        "Lily: That's not gonna happen because I'm not interested.",
        "Holden: It's not about what you want. It's about what Damian wants. He wants his family back, and that includes you.",
        "Lily: Well, he's gonna be disappointed because I just want to be with you.",
        "Holden: What if that doesn't stop him?",
        "Lily: I believe in Luke's foundation. I made a commitment to him and to the causes we support together. I refuse to walk away from that!",
