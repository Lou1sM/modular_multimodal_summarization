        "Holden: Whatever it is you think you did, I'm sure it's not that bad. [Voice breaking]",
        "Lily: It is.",
        "Holden: Does it affect the kids?",
        "Lily: No, no. But I didn't think it through. I didn't think it was my place to question the decision.",
        "Holden: Lily, we all make mistakes. If there's one thing I learned by now, it's that.",
        "Lily: But people are still getting hurt by what happened, and I don't know if I can make this right.",
        "Holden: You know you can talk to me about it, right?",
        "Lily: I -- I'd like to.",
        "Holden: You can tell me. You know you can confide in me, right?",

        "Craig: You're my son. I believe that now. You're tough, resilient. You're not afraid of anything. I've already seen that. You're going to need all of that if you're going to get through this. You can. You're a survivor, like me. You can get through this and fight your way back. But you have to want it. You have to want to survive.",

        "Parker: That's how I realized that Craig's been stealing money from my trust fund.",
        "Carly: Why -- why would Craig steal your money? He's got plenty of his own.",
        "Parker: I don't know, but the bank confirmed it. The money's gone.",
        "Carly: I -- I still don't realize what this has to do with Gabriel.",
        "Parker: Well, somehow he figured out what Craig was doing, and instead of coming to me or coming to you or to the police, he blackmailed Craig into paying him off.",
        "Carly: No wonder Craig hates him.",
        "Parker: And that's why I was so mad at him. But I didn't go there looking for him. I was looking for Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hey, wait. Do you mind if we hang out here just a little while longer and enjoy the beautiful spring day?",
        "Jack: Not at all.",
        "Janet: Thanks. I never realized how stifling Melrose Park was.",
        "Jack: [Laughs] You did great.",
        "Janet: Oh, um, I know I've told you this before, but I'm gonna say it again. Thank you so much for coming with me, because I don't think I would have been able to face those people on my own.",
        "Jack: I don't think you give yourself enough credit.",
        "Janet: No, its true, Jack.",
        "Jack: I was happy to do it. Well, not happy. You know.",
        "Janet: I know. Oh, my family. Oh, they can be a little much, right?",
        "Jack: Are you kidding? Have -- have you taken a look in there? I'm kind of used to difficult families.",
        "Janet: Well, listen, I know that Carly wasn't thrilled that you came with me.",
        "Jack: She understood.",
        "Janet: [Sighs] I just -- I wish everything wasn't so difficult.",
        "Jack: Hey, we're all kind of used to that, too, right?",
        "Janet: It's not gonna get any easier.",
        "Jack: Listen to me. No matter what happens, you and your baby will always be a part of my life -- always.",

        "Carly: I'm at the hospital. I'm about to put Craig in intensive care.",
        "Parker: Dad and Janet are home.",
        "Carly: What did you tell him?",
        "Parker: Nothing yet. They're still out on the porch.",
        "Carly: Don't say anything.",
        "Parker: Really?",
        "Carly: We agreed not to get anyone else involved until we know more.",
        "Parker: I don't like lying to Dad.",
        "Carly: You don't have to lie, Parker. Just don't volunteer anything.",
        "Parker: What's the difference? What if -- what if he asks me what's going on?",
        "Carly: Just -- just try not to talk to him, okay? Just say \"Hello\" and go on up to your room.",
        "Parker: For how long?",
        "Carly: Until I get there. I'm on my way now.",
        "Parker: But what about Craig?",
        "Carly: I'll deal with him later. Everything's gonna be okay, Parker. Don't worry.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Craig: You gonna stay out here, or are you gonna come see him?",
        "Carly: S -- something came up. I'll see him later.",

        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Parker: How was it?",
        "Jack: Hard.",

        "Janet: Hi, Sweetie. Oh!",
        "Liberty: My God, I missed you so much.",
        "Janet: I missed you, too. How are you doing? Are you feeling okay? Everything all right?",
        "Liberty: It's not me. There was a fire in Carly's building. Gabriel was trapped in the office, and no one knew he was there.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God. Is he gonna be okay?",
        "Liberty: I don't know. He's in the hospital, and he hasn't woken up yet.",
        "Jack: Was anybody else hurt -- your mother?",
        "Parker: No, she wasn't there.",
        "Jack: What caused the fire?",
        "Liberty: They don't know.",
        "Carly: Jack, I'm so glad you're back. Did you hear about the fire?",
        "Jack: Yeah, just now. Listen, I'm gonna give Margo a call.",
        "Carly: No, you know what? I'm -- I'm sure that she's got it covered. And the kids -- they missed you so much. Why don't you spend a little time with them before you head back to work?",
        "Jack: Yeah, okay. Sure.",
        "Carly: Oh, it's so good to see you. They don't know why Gabriel didn't get out. They think he might have fallen in -- in the smoke. When they found him, he was unconscious.",
        "Jack: Well, they'll -- they'll be able to question him once he wakes up.",
        "Liberty: If he wakes up.",
        "Janet: Oh, come on. He's young and he's strong. That counts for something.",
        "Liberty: I hope so.",
        "Jack: What about your business?",
        "Carly: Uh, well everything is pretty much lost in -- in the fire.",
        "Jack: You have insurance, right? You'll be able to rebuild.",
        "Carly: Um, I'm not even thinking about that right now.",
        "Jack: No, of -- of course not. You're right.",
        "Liberty: I feel so sorry for Gabriel. He's all alone.",
        "Janet: No, he's not. He has you. And he has Carly.",
        "Jack: Well, didn't he give you references when -- when you hired him?",
        "Carly: No. No, I hired him as a favor to Molly. She brought him to me.",
        "Liberty: He told me both his parents were dead and he has no other family.",
        "Janet: Okay, Sweetie, why don't you come upstairs and help me unpack, all right? Come on.",
        "Parker: Hey, you want me to get those?",
        "Liberty: We got it.",
        "Janet: Thanks.",
        "Carly: So -- how was the funeral?",
        "Jack: Rough.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I bet. It's good that you were there for Janet.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry I wasn't here for you. It sounds like you guys had a tough enough time, you know?",
        "Carly: We're -- we're fine. Aren't we, Honey?",

        "Margo: Wow. I -- I had no idea you were so close.",
        "Craig: We're not. He worked in my office. That's all. The fire started in my office, so I feel responsible.",
        "Margo: You looked pretty emotional just now.",
        "Craig: Why are you surprised that I have actual feelings?",
        "Margo: I -- I didn't say that.",
        "Craig: Then why do you look so damned shocked?",
        "Margo: I'm not.",
        "Craig: You know what? I don't need this right now.",
        "Margo: Craig, what is really going on?",

        "Lucinda: I don't think it will do any of us any good to wallow in unhappy memories.",
        "Holden: Who said we were talking about unhappy memories?",
        "Lucinda: I'm just making a point.",
        "Holden: Well, thanks for that. Could you give us a few minutes?",
        "Lucinda: Clearly you're upset, Dear, but, um -- um, it's not gonna help to rehash things right now.",
        "Holden: Who said she was upset?",
        "Lucinda: Well, I know my daughter's face. For heaven's sake! It's clear she's upset about something.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, this is between Lily and me, so stay out of it.",
        "Lucinda: I won't stay out of it. And you, after all you've put her through --",
        "Lily: Mother, stop!",
        "Holden: You know what?",
        "Lily: Holden hasn't done anything wrong, and you know it.",
        "Holden: Maybe you should just leave.",
        "Lucinda: No, I'm not going to leave. I'm not going to leave. I just got here.",
        "Lily: Holden, it's -- it's all right. You -- we'll talk about this later.",
        "Holden: Are you sure?",
        "Lily: Yeah. It's nothing that can't wait.",
        "Lucinda: And, uh, now I'm here, so I'll make sure whatever she needs, she'll get it.",
        "Lily: It's okay.",
        "Lucinda: Satisfied?",
        "Holden: Fine.",
        "Lily: We'll talk later, I promise.",
        "Holden: All right. Just call me if you need me.",
        "Lucinda: She won't. [Sighs] What are you up to? Have you lost your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: I'm sorry I wasn't here for you.",
        "Liberty: It's not your fault. I'm glad you're here now.",
        "Janet: I didn't realize you had gotten so close to Gabriel.",
        "Liberty: I didn't either. He was really nice to me during the chemo and picking me up at your parents' house so I didn't have to sit through the funeral.",
        "Janet: He obviously means a lot to you.",
        "Liberty: He never treated me like a cancer patient. I was always a regular person with him.",
        "Janet: What about Parker?",
        "Liberty: What about him?",
        "Janet: Does he think that Gabriel is as nice as you think he is?",
        "Liberty: They don't get along. Whenever he saw me with Gabriel --",
        "Janet: I know. Listen, maybe you are not his friend in the same way you think you're his friend. Do you know what I mean? Get where I'm going?",
        "Liberty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: I guess not.",
        "Janet: Yeah. So, did something happen between them?",
        "Liberty: It started when Gabriel picked me up from Melrose Park. Parker was, like, obsessed with how he could afford it.",
        "Janet: Yeah, how could he afford it? I thought he was a handyman or something.",
        "Liberty: He has money from somewhere. I don't know. It doesn't really matter to me.",
        "Janet: But it mattered to Parker.",
        "Liberty: Yeah, they got in a huge fight.",
        "Janet: About money?",
        "Liberty: No, about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I know this has got to be tough on you. You worked so hard on Monte Carlo. And to lose it like that --",
        "Carly: I'm just thinking about Gabriel right now.",
        "Jack: But it wasn't your fault.",
        "Carly: Well, I know, but he worked for me, and he was trapped in my office.",
        "Jack: You didn't cause the fire.",
        "Carly: Of course not.",
        "Jack: And what about you?",
        "Parker: What about me?",
        "Jack: Well, it can't be easy seeing a kid your age in the hospital like that.",
        "Parker: It isn't.",
        "Jack: What's important is to know that just because you knew him and because he worked for you, it doesn't make you responsible.",
        "Carly: Well, we -- we know that.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I -- I know that. I get it.",
        "Jack: Okay. Of course. Of course you do. Right now I think it's important to focus on us, our lives and our family.",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "Jack: So I tell you what. Why don't we grab Sage and, uh, I don't know, go for a walk, spend some time together, maybe just be alone and talk this through?",
        "Carly: We can't do that.",
        "Jack: You can't what, go for a walk?",
        "Carly: No, we -- we can't, not now, because P -- Parker has a paper, and he hasn't done enough work on it at all.",
        "Parker: Right. I do.",
        "Carly: You should be at the library right now, really.",
        "Parker: You're -- you're right. It's -- it's due tomorrow, and I'm way behind.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I didn't mean to pull you away from your studies.",
        "Carly: Well, we both appreciate the thought.",
        "Jack: I'm just worried about you.",
        "Carly: I know. And you're sweet. But you were right before. The best thing we can do is just get back to normal.",
        "Parker: Which means I should really go work on that paper.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Why don't you go get your stuff, and I'll give you a lift to the library?",
        "Parker: Okay. Be right back.",
        "Jack: Okay, what's going on?",
        "Carly: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: You and Parker.",
        "Carly: Oh, we're -- we're just -- we're just worried about the fire and all that.",
        "Jack: And I'm -- and I'm trying to help.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Jack: So -- so why are you pushing me away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Craig, what's wrong with you?",
        "Craig: Nothing's wrong with me?",
        "Margo: Well, I -- I didn't mean to criticize you for having feelings.",
        "Craig: That's what it sounded like.",
        "Margo: I'm sorry.",
        "Craig: Why shouldn't I feel bad about what happened to this kid?",
        "Margo: Well, you should. It's great that you do.",
        "Craig: Ahh. Except you're just so shocked.",
        "Margo: No. It's you made a real point of -- of telling me that you really didn't care much about this kid.",
        "Craig: He's a -- he's a kid. He's all alone in the world.",
        "Margo: Well, I think it's great that you're showing interest in him. I like that you show people that you've got a heart.",
        "Craig: Including you.",
        "Margo: Including me, yes.",
        "Craig: So sorry to shock you like that.",
        "Margo: [Sighs] Have you been able to track down his family.",
        "Craig: I wouldn't know where to start.",
        "Margo: What about, do you ever see him hanging out with anyone? Does he have friends in Oakdale?",
        "Craig: Did this just turn into an interrogation?",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. We're trying to find out why he didn't get out of the building.",
        "Craig: You told me he was unconscious.",
        "Margo: Well, yes, beyond that. Listen, did you ever see him get in an argument with anyone?",
        "Craig: You think someone did this to him?",
        "Margo: I'm just asking a few questions?",
        "Craig: Well, I barely saw him. Look, you know what? I really -- I have to go. Sorry.",
        "Margo: Really, there's nothing more you can tell me about him?",
        "Craig: I told you everything I know.",
        "Margo: [Sighs] Well, what about you -- you hired him. You really didn't fill out any forms?",
        "Craig: Everything went up in the fire.",
        "Margo: All right, all right. About the fire, you have any idea how that started?",
        "Craig: Margo, you have experts to tell you things like that.",
        "Margo: Craig, I'm just asking if you have any idea.",
        "Craig: I -- look, I -- I don't know anything more, really. I wish I could help you.",
        "Margo: I wish you could, too. Call me if you think of anything.",
        "Craig: Yes. Yes, of course. I will.",
        "Margo: I'm -- I'm gonna walk you out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: So, what was the fight about?",
        "Liberty: Parker was jealous, even though he had no reason to be.",
        "Janet: That happens.",
        "Liberty: But, Mom, he went way over the line. He totally lost it when he found out Gabriel came to pick me up.",
        "Janet: Honey, he cares about you, a lot.",
        "Liberty: We caught him in Gabriel's room, going through his stuff.",
        "Janet: What?! Why was Parker going through Gabriel's stuff?",
        "Liberty: Because he's convinced Gabriel's hiding something from me. He wasn't, but it got really intense for a couple of minutes.",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry.",
        "Liberty: [Sighs] And, like, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I want to be friends with both of them, but Parker is making that really hard right now.",
        "Janet: Well, that's not your fault.",
        "Liberty: I know, but you know how much Parker's done for me. He's been there every time I needed him.",
        "Janet: I know, I know, but it doesn't sound to make like you are choosing Gabriel over Parker or that you're rejecting Parker.",
        "Liberty: I'm not.",
        "Janet: Okay! Then you haven't done anything wrong.",
        "Liberty: I guess. It would be so much easier if I'd never become friends with Gabriel in the first place.",
        "Janet: Hey, do not blame yourself for Parker's behavior, okay? As long as you have been honest with both guys, you've got nothing to feel guilty about.",
        "Liberty: They sure don't make it easy on us, do they?",
        "Janet: No, they don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I know you're upset, and you want to share. You want to share everything with Holden. You can't.",
        "Lily: Why not?",
        "Lucinda: Because Holden doesn't lie. He cannot tell a lie. He only tells the truth. He will tell somebody, and then Craig will find out that Gabriel is his son.",
        "Lily: Don't you think he has a right to know?",
        "Lucinda: And you know what he'll try to do to us when he learns that we've kept the secret all these years.",
        "Lily: We're gonna find out soon enough, because he already knows.",
        "Lucinda: How -- he knows what?",
        "Lily: He knows that Gabriel is his son.",
        "Lucinda: How? How does he know that?",
        "Lily: I told him.",
        "Lucinda: You are out of your mind! Now, why?! Why did you do that?!",
        "Lily: Mother, that boy could be dying, and he's here all alone.",
        "Lucinda: He has us.",
        "Lily: Oh, please. Have you even been to see him?",
        "Lucinda: No. Have you?",
        "Lily: Yes. That's -- that's when I ran into Craig.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, oh, and then you had to tell him! You had to tell everything!",
        "Lily: Yes, I had to tell him that that boy that was lying unconscious in that hospital bed was his son!",
        "Lucinda: Why? Why -- would you risk everything after --",
        "Lily: It wasn't our place to keep it from him anymore!",
        "Lucinda: It was the mother's decision! It was Lidia's decision!",
        "Lily: Lidia is dead, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: Yes.",
        "Lily: And Gabriel must know about Craig. Why else would he have come here?",
