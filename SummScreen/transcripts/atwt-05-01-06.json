        "Meg: I can't check her pupils. It's too dark.",

        "Katie: Honey, nobody knows what's gonna happen. It's life. I could step off the curb tomorrow and get hit by a bus. Tornadoes, hurricanes, wipe out entire lives.",
        "Mike: You're talking about accidents of fate. This is different. I brought this nightmare to us.",
        "Katie: Yes, to us, not to you. We share everything or nothing, okay? We need to make a strategy. Let's just go home and start planning.",

        "Margo: Oh, I switched shifts with somebody. So, where's my kid?",

        "Margo: My Casey?",
        "Lisa: Yeah, your Casey, yes, you should be really proud of him. He's got the whole success of this entire place resting squarely on his shoulders.",

        "Casey: Well, it's not your call.",
        "Will: It's not yours.",
        "Maddie: Guys, can we not do this?",

        "Nick: So, I guess you don't need me anymore?",
        "Carly: I appreciate the ride. Let's leave it at that. Oh, I think I have some of Jack's beer in the fridge. You want one?",
        "Nick: This is getting way too civilized.",
        "Carly: Light or regular?",
        "Nick: Stop it, Carly.",

        "Nick: You don't care what kind of beer I want.",

        "Jennifer: No, Paul's down there with her. And Dusty and Meg too.",
        "Hal: What did Paul do to her?",
        "Jennifer: Nothing. Dad, Emily tried to kill herself.",
        "Hal: Are you saying that Emily didn't fall, that she jumped?",
        "Jennifer: Yes. Dusty thought that Paul might've been helping Emily escape so we followed him. And we got here and he was -- he was trying to bring her in -- trying to get her some help. He did everything he could to get her away from the edge. Dad, I already talked to a dispatcher when I left the message for you.",
        "Hal: This is Munson. I'm in Coker's Woods, on the bluff, past the second access road. Is the chopper on its way? Tell 'em to hurry! I'm going down there. In the meantime, I want you to call Susan. Here's her number.",

        "Paul: She's not breathing.",
        "Dusty: What -- tell me what to do?",
        "Paul: Stay away from her!",
        "Meg: Look, I need to find out if her airway's constricted, okay? I don't want to move her head too much because I don't know if something's broken.",
        "Dusty: Then leave it for the medics.",
        "Meg: She could die if we don't help her right now.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's what your boyfriend wants, isn't it. So she can't --",
        "Paul: Will you get the hell out of here!",
        "Meg: Okay, I think her airway's clear. Dusty, come here, come here. Grab her wrist. Put your two fingers there. Okay, do feel that?",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Meg: Okay. Paul -- Paul! Look, I need you to breathe air into her lungs while I support her head. All right? Go.",

        "Margo: Yeah.",
        "Katie: We were making plans.",
        "Margo: You were nigh onto lewd and lascivious there.",
        "Katie: Where is Tom anyway? Why's he missing Casey's big night?",
        "Margo: Tom's -- he's taking care of Danny. Things are a little rocky with Emily -- so, for tonight it's divide and conquer.",
        "Mike: That's your advice for happy marriage?",
        "Margo: No, no, no, be there for one another and keep the checkbook away from Katie.",
        "Katie: Don't listen to her.",
        "Mike: Whatever you say, Captain. You're in charge of strategy.",
        "Margo: Strategy? What about strategy?",
        "Katie: We're planning our wedding.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know. I've got it in the date book.",
        "Katie: No, I mean we're really planning our wedding. We just moved it up to this month.",
        "Mike: Maybe even this week. As fast as we can.",
        "Lisa: Hello, may I have your attention please. So many of you have asked me where did I get the idea for this club. Well, it's very simple. I just wanted people to feel welcome when they come here and well if you love rock and jazz and blues, soul music. And if you're young, if you're not so young, if you're a local people or if you're out of town. My grandson says, well there's nothing more fun than just crashing a party. And that's what I want you to do. That's what this club is all about. I want you to feel like you can come right in that door, and crash our party every night. Now, there's something very special. This is our opening night, the grand opening, and we have a wonderful, wonderful young singer who is going to crash onto the music scene. And so I have asked her if she would be happy to sing for us and she said yes, she would. So put your hands together and give a nice, warm welcome to Gwen Munson and her band, the Krew.",
        "Gwen: Thanks, Mrs. Grimaldi. Ok, wow. Yeah, three, four --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Why can't Luke see what that girl really is?",
        "Holden: Luke sees a girl that he's crazy about, helping out his dad and his family is having a hard time. And she's with a girl, she's helping them as well, while their mom is in the hospital.",
        "Lily: It's my fault. I let her stay. Why couldn't you get somebody else to take them today? Your mother. My mother. Your sister.",
        "Holden: She was there. And the girls like her.",
        "Lily: So now, again, she gets free rein of our home.",
        "Holden: Ok, so what are we supposed to do? Pull a Lucinda? You wanna forbid Jade and Luke from seeing each other?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I'm tempted. Believe me.",
        "Holden: Well, he made it very clear that if she leaves, he leaves?",
        "Lily: If he hadn't gotten sick, I'd call his bluff. I swear.",
        "Holden: Well, he did get sick. And I hate to inform you of this but the girls are starting to get attached to Jade.",
        "Lily: Oh, yes I noticed. I saw the lovely pictures of all of them together. So, we're painted into a corner. If we don't let Jade stay, then Luke gets sick again. If we do let her stay, we have to hand over our lives to a con- artist. I don't think I can do that. I don't think you can either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Thanks.",
        "Carly: So, you are right. I don't do alone very well.",
        "Nick: Yeah, but Jack has worked plenty of nights before, Carly. This can't be your first time holding down the fort.",
        "Carly: The difference then was, I knew he was coming home.",
        "Nick: Plus you didn't have a skeleton in your basement. Mike and Katie had told me.",
        "Carly: You see the thing is, it's not even here anymore and it's still really creeping me out. I hate it, I can't stand not feeling safe under my own roof.",
        "Nick: Want me to take a look around?",
        "Carly: Look for what?",
        "Nick: I don't know. Things that go bump in the night? Come on, I'll start in the basement.",
        "Carly: Two favors in one night? We might forget we hate each other.",
        "Nick: I'll risk it, if you will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Nothing? Nothing?",
        "Meg: Keep trying.",
        "Dusty: Her pulse is fading.",
        "Hal: Let me take over, Dusty. Come on, go, Paul, again. Come on, baby, you can do it. Breathe. Breathe. How long have you been trying?",
        "Meg: Long enough. It's not looking good, Hal.",
        "Hal: Well, we're not giving up now. There's a medevac copter on the way.",
        "Paul: That was a breath and she did it on her own.",
        "Hal: Thank God.",
        "Meg: We have a decent pulse. What about you, Hal?",
        "Hal: It's getting stronger, stronger. Check her eyes.",
        "Meg: I can't I have no light.",
        "Hal: Here.",
        "Meg: Thanks. They're unequal.",
        "Dusty: What's that mean?",
        "Meg: Possible head injury.",
        "Hal: Hang in there, baby. Help is on the way. Any minute now. I'm gonna update the EMT's on her condition.",
        "Paul: You are unbelievable.",
        "Meg: You brought her back.",
        "Paul: I think we all did. Dusty why don't you go up and check on Jennifer. I'm sure she needs you right now.",
        "Dusty: I'll keep an eye on things down here.",
        "Paul: Yeah, Hal's probably got that covered. Emily, listen, Hal's talking to the EMTs right now. And they're going to get you out of here and everything's going to be all right. Ok, I promise you. You are going to be all right now.",
        "Hal: Great. Ok, they're going to drop a litter with a board and a collar in that small clearing behind those pines. Meg, you and I will put her on the board and we'll carry her back to the tether line -- what happening? Why is she seizing?",
        "Meg: I don't know. We've lost her pulse.",
        "Paul: Emily!",
