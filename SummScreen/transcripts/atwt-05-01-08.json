        "Sage: But Mom, I don't want to go!",
        "Carly: Sage, you have been begging for months to go to sleep-away camp. Now all of a sudden, you're not interested? Why?",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Carly: Parker, would you get the door?",
        "Sage: Lori said that Madison said that sleep-away camp is scary. I don't like scary stuff.",
        "Jack: What's going on?",
        "Parker: Preteen meltdown.",
        "Carly: Sage, I'm not deciding anything right this minute. I'm just gonna go and look at the camp today.",
        "Sage: Why do you have to look at it? I don't want to go. Daddy, don't make me go.",
        "Jack: Okay. You know, maybe your mom and I should talk about this some more.",
        "Carly: I'll take lots of pictures, and I'll bring home some brochures. And then, you and I will go over everything tonight, and we'll decide together, okay?",
        "Sage: But I already decided.",
        "Carly: Sage, why don't you get ready for school so you're not late?",
        "Sage: You're mean!",
        "Carly: You can disagree with me whenever you want, but I would appreciate it if you didn't do it in front of the children.",
        "Jack: Sage was upset. What's going on with this camp thing?",
        "Carly: Nothing. I just have an appointment to have a tour, that's all.",
        "Jack: I thought your car was in the shop.",
        "Carly: Holden's driving. Thanks for shuttling, Jack. I'll be home by supper.",
        "Jack: You gotta cancel this camp deal.",
        "Carly: Jack, I'm not --",
        "Jack: Sage doesn't want to go! I'm not gonna force her to go, and neither are you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Mama, have you seen that list of questions I printed out? I thought I left them on the desk, but I can't find them anywhere.",
        "Emma: Mmm.",
        "Holden: Ah. Thank you.",
        "Emma: You're welcome. Oh, Sweetheart, come on, now. Relax. It's not the first time you sent a child away to camp.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but it's the first time for this camp. Lily used to handle all the details.",
        "Emma: Has Carly been helpful?",
        "Holden: Yeah, sure. Okay. Nat -- she wants to make sure they help her out with the scrapbook.",
        "Emma: Oh, and don't forget, Faith wants to take archery.",
        "Holden: They let these kids shoot arrows around this camp?",
        "Emma: Oh, Holden, stop worrying.",
        "Holden: Okay. All right, how do I look?",
        "Emma: You look the same as you always do -- very, very, very, very handsome. Why do you ask?",
        "Holden: Well, there's a waiting list. I don't want to blow it for the girls by making a lousy first impression.",
        "Emma: Come on, now. Everything is going to be fine.",
        "Holden: I wish Lily were here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: You don't want to rush things, Lily, Darling. I mean, if you need time, take it. Well, of course I'd be very happy to see you. Okay. Okay. Bye. Did you pay the bill? Leave a tip? Excellent. Keep the change.",
        "Faith: I love spending the night at your house and getting breakfast. I feel so grown-up.",
        "Lucinda: Let's do it more often, all right? Now we're gonna get you to school.",
        "Faith: Grandma, did you let me spend the night because Mom's gone?",
        "Lucinda: No. I wanted one-on-one time with my favorite girl, Faith.",
        "Faith: I miss Mom so much. Sometimes it feels like she's never coming home.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. Don't even think that way. You have my word she's coming back very soon.",
        "Faith: I don't think so.",
        "Lucinda: I wasn't going to tell you this yet. I spoke with Mom. She's coming home today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Did you, uh -- did you call Lily this morning?",
        "Holden: No, yesterday. She sounded a lot better, too. She said she was gonna call tonight after dinner.",
        "Emma: Maybe you should call her now. Let her know what you're doing with the girls.",
        "Holden: Nah. I don't want to pressure her. What? What is it?",
        "Emma: I don't know, Holden. I mean, all this time you and Lily are spending apart, for whatever the reason, I -- I really don't think it's good for your marriage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Sage has changed her mind at least ten times about going to camp.",
        "Jack: Which is proof that she's upset about it.",
        "Carly: She's a little nervous, Jack. But if she can be there with Faith and Natalie, she'll make the adjustment in no time.",
        "Jack: You can't be sure of that, Carly.",
        "Carly: What do you think, that no one can know our little girl better than you? Not even the woman who gave birth to her?",
        "Jack: Ever since you took off with Simon, the kids have been insecure.",
        "Carly: Oh, good God. Are you gonna throw that in my face every single time we have an argument?",
        "Jack: They didn't know where you were or if you were ever coming back, Carly. It's taken its toll.",
        "Carly: Well, I think it would be a good idea for Sage to get away from all the tension around here. And maybe with some time away, she'll get over this fantasy that you and I will ever be back together again.",
        "Jack: So you think sending them away is the cure-all for everything?",
        "Carly: I'm not sending her away! We decided that this would be a good idea for her.",
        "Jack: I guess I'm having second thoughts.",
        "Carly: You've had a lot of those lately, haven't you?",
        "Parker: Wow. You guys went a whole five minutes without fighting. That's a new record.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Where's the kid?",
        "Katie: She's still in the shower. Did you talk to her mom?",
        "Brad: Yeah. Janet swears that I'm Liberty's father.",
        "Katie: Do you believe her?",
        "Brad: I don't want to, but I don't really have a reason not to.",
        "Katie: And she had no idea that Liberty had taken off to find you?",
        "Brad: She says that it's okay if Liberty stays here for the DNA test results to come in. I mean, she wouldn't do that if I wasn't her dad, right?",
        "Katie: I guess.",
        "Brad: Janet says she's going through some stuff. That the mother-daughter thing has been rough.",
        "Katie: Rough how?",
        "Brad: I don't know. She didn't go into details. She just says that she needs me to step up now.",
        "Katie: Okay. Well, I guess we should get to work and start acting like parents.",
        "Brad: Katie, this is my mess, it's not yours.",
        "Katie: Liberty's not a mess, she's your daughter.",
        "Brad: She's a teenager. That's work.",
        "Katie: So? I was a teenager not that long ago, actually. I can handle her.",
        "Brad: But why would you want to?",
        "Katie: Because I married you for better or worse.",
        "Brad: This is as bad as it gets.",
        "Katie: Don't say that.",
        "Brad: Look, I didn't -- it's true. This is not what I promised you when I asked you to marry me.",
        "Katie: So, we'll adjust.",
        "Brad: Listen to me. Listen to me. You didn't sign on to be a stepmom, and I'm not gonna hold you to that.",
        "Katie: What are you saying?",
        "Brad: That if you want out of this marriage, I'll let you go. You know that song? \"Time in a Bottle\"?",
        "Katie: You want to divorce me?",
        "Brad: Of course -- of course not. But things are not stacking up the way we planned, so if you wanted out, I couldn't very well hold it against you, now, could I?",
        "Katie: Now you're insulting me.",
        "Brad: Listen to me. Listen to me. I'm trying to be a good guy here, Katie.",
        "Katie: Then listen up. You're my husband. I love you. Don't forget that. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life being driven crazy by you.",
        "Brad: And possibly my teenage daughter.",
        "Katie: We're in this together.",
        "Brad: You mean that?",
        "Katie: I really, really mean that.",
        "Brad: I knew there was a reason I love you. Now, what do we do with a 16-year- old?",
        "Katie: First thing we do -- send her to school.",
        "Liberty: That's silly. I'm not going to school. You can't make me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Your mom and I were just having a discussion, okay?",
        "Parker: It sounded like an argument.",
        "Jack: Can you give us five minutes, please? Five minutes. Just go wait in the car. Thank you. So much for that resolution we made to stop snapping at each other.",
        "Carly: I'm trying, Jack. I know you are, too. You and I, we're gonna have to find a new way to communicate. And while we're doing that, I think that we need to protect our kids.",
        "Jack: By sending them away?",
        "Carly: By making sure that they have things to do and friends to be with away from all of this drama.",
        "Jack: Where they can run away from their problems, Carly?",
        "Carly: They're our problems. They have nothing to do with them. This camp, Jack -- I just wish that you would think about it.",
        "Jack: Okay. It's your decision. I just hope you're making the right one.",
        "Carly: Hey. Sage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Carly and I, we should be back later tonight.",
        "Emma: Well, you drive carefully, you hear?",
        "Holden: I will.",
        "Emma: Let me see. Handsome.",
        "Holden: And Mama, what you said about Lily, about us spending a lot of time apart -- if she can come back and be herself again, it'll only make our marriage stronger. You'll see.",
        "Emma: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Liberty, if you're gonna stay here and we're gonna get to know each other, then this is -- this is the deal. You have to go to school.",
        "Liberty: No, thank you. Ooh!",
        "Brad: Not an option. Okay, you have to enroll in that -- what's the name of that fancy high school?",
        "Katie: Oakdale Latin.",
        "Liberty: Oakdale Latin? Isn't that one of those weird schools that, like, makes you wear a uniform?",
        "Brad: Is it?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Liberty: Well, it still sounds preppy and snobbish, and I'm not going there.",
        "Katie: Fine, then you can go to one of the public high schools. I'll call and find out what district we're in. We'll get your transcripts and transfer you over.",
        "Liberty: Why don't I just save us a lot of trouble and we'll just bag the whole thing?",
        "Brad: Not an option.",
        "Liberty: But I'm gonna go right at the end of school, where there's finals. I'm gonna be slammed.",
        "Brad: Okay, do you want to repeat the whole year next year?",
        "Liberty: You're rich. Have me homeschooled.",
        "Katie: What? No! Wait, hold on, hold on. You know the best part about starting a new school? New wardrobe. What do you say, let me take you shopping?",
        "Liberty: Can I get whatever I want?",
        "Katie: Well, we'll have to set a little budget, but I promise it will be generous. What do you say?",
        "Liberty: I can't wait to go to school. I'll be back in five minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Holden: Better grab your coat. It's pretty windy and very chilly up at the lake.",
        "Carly: Uh, Holden, I really hate to do this to you, but I'm not feeling very well. Maybe you should go on your own.",
        "Holden: Don't tell me you're gonna make me go see these camp counselors on my own.",
        "Carly: You're a tough guy. You can handle it.",
        "Holden: Okay. All right. Feel better, Carly.",
        "Carly: Hey. Do you think I'm a good mother?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Carly: That's a vote of confidence.",
        "Holden: No, I mean, I think only you can be the judge of that.",
        "Carly: I need an impartial opinion.",
        "Holden: Okay. All right. Well, let's test you. Do kids roll their eyes at you, talk back to you and tell you that you're really lame?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Holden: That means that you're raising them to think for themselves. That's good. Next question. Do they throw up all over you when they're sick?",
        "Carly: Yes, often.",
        "Holden: Well then, that proves that you're there when they need you. Now here's a tough one. Are they happy?",
        "Carly: Used to be. I guess two out of three ain't bad.",
        "Holden: That's what I aim for. What brought this on? Did one of the kids say something?",
        "Carly: Jack.",
        "Holden: Jack said that you were a bad mother?",
        "Carly: He thinks sending Sage to camp is another example of me abandoning my children. He was serious.",
        "Holden: Aw, come on. Don't tell me that you're buying into that. Carly, camp is not a life sentence. Sage can come home whenever she wants. Jack needs to lighten up, and I think that you need to come with me to this camp.",
        "Carly: Oh, I don't know.",
        "Holden: Come on. Just take a ride with me. Keep me company. Are you gonna abandon me in my time of need?",
        "Carly: All right, I'll go. But I control the radio.",
        "Holden: You got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Faith: Grandma, where's Dad?",
        "Emma: Why aren't you at school?",
        "Lucinda: What can I say? She wore me down.",
        "Emma: What's going on?",
        "Faith: Grandmother and I have really good news. Is Dad in the barn?",
        "Emma: No, no. He won't be home till this evening. He went to check out that camp for you and your sister. Why?",
        "Faith: Mom's coming home.",
        "Emma: Is this true?",
        "Lucinda: She ought to be home by dinnertime.",
        "Emma: Well, that's wonderful news. I'll go call your dad and get him right back here.",
        "Faith: Wait, Grandma. I have an idea. Maybe we won't tell him. That way, we can make it into a surprise party for Mom and Dad. I'll go find decorations.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Country music plays]",
        "Holden: That works.",
        "Carly: Jack likes country music, too.",
        "Holden: I know he does. You watch. It'll hit Parker and J.J., too.",
        "Carly: What kind of music does Lily like?",
        "Holden: I don't know. She's into a lot of different stuff. But she really loves live music. We get tickets every summer to the arts center. It's weird. I don't even know if she'll be back by then.",
        "Carly: At least you know she wants to come back, that she will be home eventually. That's more than I have with Jack.",
        "Holden: You know, you and Jack -- I think you guys are just going about it all wrong.",
        "Carly: Oh, please advise, oh, wise one.",
        "Holden: You and Jack, you guys are like ice cream.",
        "Carly: Cold and sticky? Melt in the sun?",
        "Holden: If your ice cream falls off the cone, do you scoop it up, dust it off and try to eat it?",
        "Carly: It depends how hungry I am.",
        "Holden: You gotta cut your losses. You gotta buy a new scoop and try not to fix something that cannot be fixed.",
        "Carly: Holden, that's deep. [Holden laughs] Got that from a country song.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Look, when Mom comes home, she may not be ready for such a big celebration, you know? It may take a little time before she's her real self again.",
        "Faith: I don't get it. If Mom's coming home, she's better, right?",
        "Emma: Well, you know what it's like when you have a cold and you go back to school and you still kind of have sniffles? I mean, you don't get better right away sometimes.",
        "Lucinda: I think what we're trying to say, darling, is you shouldn't get your expectations up too fast, you know? Because it just may take a little time before Mom's on track and \"Normal\" again.",
        "Faith: All I want is my mom with my dad. That's normal enough for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey, where's the store?",
        "Katie: Its Fashions, right there.",
        "Brad: You want me to come shopping with you?",
        "Katie: No, it's okay. You don't have to.",
        "Brad: Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm. No problem. It's gonna take a while. What are you gonna do?",
        "Brad: I don't know. Manly stuff. Probably build a house, plant a tree.",
        "Katie: Cool, cool, cool. Have fun.",
        "Brad: Cool, cool.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Jack: Snyder.",
        "Brad: Snyder back at you. Question.",
        "Jack: Shoot.",
        "Brad: School, kids -- explain.",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Lisa: Katie, who's that little girl?",
        "Katie: That's Liberty. We don't know for sure yet, but --",
        "Lisa: But? But what?",
        "Katie: She might be Brad's daughter.",
        "Lisa: Honey, you poor little thing.",
        "Jack: Hey, Bro. Where's Katie?",
        "Brad: She's busy. You could have told me how to handle the school stuff over the phone. You didn't have to come down here.",
        "Jack: No, I know. But it really -- it can get pretty complicated, so I figured that while I had the time, I'd come down here, take you and Katie over to the school, make some introductions. While I was there, catch parker's baseball game.",
        "Brad: Yeah, and while you're helping me with my maybe daughter, you could maybe score some points with my wife. It's not gonna happen.",
        "Katie: Okay, Liberty, we've officially maxed out our budget. [Liberty gasps] Katie, look at this bracelet. Is this so cute?",
        "Katie: It's really cute.",
        "Liberty: Can I get it, please?",
        "Katie: Maybe next time.",
        "Liberty: But do you think it'll still be here when we come back next time?",
        "Katie: If it's not, I'm sure there will be something just as pretty. [Liberty sighs] I'm just gonna finish checking us out.",
        "Jack: Unbelievable. You ask me for my help and then you question my motives. Unreal.",
        "Brad: You're unreal. The last time we talked, you totally messed with my mind.",
        "Jack: I gave you advice.",
        "Brad: No, you didn't. No, no. You made it sound like Katie was really upset, that there was no way she would be able to accept if Liberty turned out to be my daughter. And you're wrong. 'Cause you know where they are right now? They're shopping. They're totally bonding.",
        "Jack: Okay. Well, I'm glad that I'm wrong.",
        "Brad: Me, too.",
        "Jack: And just so you know, I'm not holding a secret torch for your wife. Katie and I are history. I would never interfere with your marriage.",
        "Brad: Like you did when I married Carly?",
        "Jack: That was hardly ever a marriage.",
        "Brad: All right. Touch\u00e9.",
        "Jack: We're family, Brad. There's no reason we can't be friends, too.",
        "Brad: I would like that.",
        "Jack: Good.",
        "Security guard: Excuse me. Could you please empty your pockets?",
        "Liberty: Why? I mean, we paid for everything. Ask her.",
        "Katie: Yeah, no. It's okay. He's just doing his job. Don't get defensive.",
        "Brad: What's going on?",
        "Katie: Just a security check.",
        "Security guard: Did you pay for this?",
        "Katie: No. No, we didn't. I apologize. This must be some misunderstanding.",
        "Security guard: It wasn't. She stole this.",
        "Lisa: Oh, is there, uh -- is there some problem here?",
        "Jack: Oh, yes, Lisa. Your security guard is accusing Liberty of stealing this bracelet. Did you do that?",
        "Lisa: Honey, wait a minute. Before you answer that, just know that my shop has many cameras in it. It's so easy to check.",
        "Security guard: I saw her grab the bracelet.",
        "Lisa: Ah.",
        "Katie: Okay. What do we do now?",
        "Lisa: We have had just a terrible run of shoplifting lately, so I instituted a no-tolerance policy. But since, I mean, it's Brad and Katie -- I mean, because of you -- well, why don't I just take this bracelet back, and we'll just say forget all about it, okay?",
        "Brad: No. I don't want to forget about it. Arrest her.",
        "Katie: Brad, your brother has something to say.",
        "Jack: You've proven your point. Take her home.",
        "Brad: Not yet.",
        "Jack: She's been in there for hours.",
        "Brad: Not yet.",
        "Parker: What are we looking at?",
        "Jack: Hey, Parker. How you doing?",
        "Parker: I thought you were coming to my baseball game.",
        "Jack: Well, I was planning on it, yeah, but I ran in to kind of a situation here.",
        "Katie: Don't you think you're being a little hard on Liberty?",
        "Brad: You practically buy out a clothing store for her, but, no, that's not enough. She's got to steal something. I'm not gonna let my daughter grow up to be a criminal. She needs to be taught a lesson.",
        "Katie: I agree, but you just met her. Do you really think jail is the best option? Maybe, perhaps, you could, I don't know, ground her for a week?",
        "Brad: And have us be stuck in a room with an angry teenager? I'm trying to punish her, not us.",
        "Katie: And I'm trying to make sure that if Liberty is your daughter, there is some small chance that she may actually end up liking you. This isn't the way.",
        "Brad: Kids need rules, right? I mean, that's what they say. Boundaries.",
        "Katie: They also need love and, they say, understanding.",
        "Brad: I just can't believe that my maybe daughter, you know, is a criminal. I mean, she's not even -- she doesn't even think. I mean, she just does stuff.",
        "Katie: Like you.",
        "Brad: She's stubborn.",
        "Katie: Also like you. She just wants to be loved, Brad, and understood, just like you.",
        "Parker: So who'd you push off a skateboard this time?",
        "Liberty: Don't tell me, you're here to press charges, too.",
        "Parker: Okay, shoplifting in front of a store full of people and video camera. What were you thinking? Don't sweat it. They'll let you out of here soon.",
        "Liberty: No. I did the crime. I'll do the time.",
        "Parker: Have you ever been in a jail cell before?",
        "Liberty: Sure. Plenty of times.",
        "Parker: No, you haven't. You have no idea what it's like.",
        "Liberty: You have?",
        "Parker: Yeah. And believe me, you don't want to go there.",

        "Carly: I want to go to that camp. Did you see that arts and crafts cabin?",
        "Holden: More like an arts and crafts showroom. And that camp director.",
        "Carly: So cute and peppy, she almost makes you want to scream, but you can't 'cause she's so nice.",
        "Holden: She's got a PhD in psychology. That's a plus. Faith -- she needs people who can help her stop being such a perfectionist.",
        "Carly: What did camp-mom Eleanor have to say about that?",
        "Holden: She said a lot of girls Faith's age go through that, and what they try to get them to do is focus on the process instead of trying to be right all the time.",
        "Carly: You know, she said she'd put the girls in the same cabin so they don't get homesick.",
        "Holden: Where was I when that happened?",
        "Carly: I believe you were out practicing your archery.",
        "Holden: You know what? This has been a fun trip. I'm glad I talked you into it.",
        "Carly: Me, too. Now if I can only talk sage into going. You know, she needs this. She needs to be a kid 24/7 instead of always worrying about me and Jack. [Carly sighs] And you really have to stop listening to this country music, you know. I'll find some jazz here.",
        "Holden: You know what? I gotta call my mother. Check in with her.",

        "Holden: A lot better than I expected.",
        "Emma: Will you be home for dinner?",

        "Parker: I didn't kill the guy, but I almost got sent away for a very long time.",
        "Liberty: Wow. This town is tougher than it looks.",
        "Parker: Yeah. See you later.",
        "Brad: I know the kid's got issues, and she's not a felon yet, but it's, like, I don't want to be the one to mess her up. I mean, she's gonna end up on death row and they'll do some TV show where they trace it all back to the first time she shoplifted and her clueless dad ignored the warning signs.",
        "Katie: Honey, I think she got the message.",
        "Brad: How do you know?",
        "Katie: Just go in there and talk to her and make sure she knows what she did wrong and take her home. Do you want me to go with you?",
        "Brad: No. No. I'll be okay. I'll be okay. Unless she starts crying, and if she does, I'm gonna need you, so stay close.",
        "Katie: Will do.",
        "Brad: Okay, Liberty. You've been here a long time. I think you learned your lesson, so I'm gonna -- I'm gonna take you home. Let's go.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Lucinda, are you sure? Are you sure you don't want to stay and welcome Lily home?",
        "Lucinda: No. I think she should be allowed to concentrate on Holden and the girls. I think that's quite enough for now.",
        "Emma: Listen, can I ask you, how did she -- how did she sound on the phone?",
        "Lucinda: Well, she sounded happier than she has in months.",
        "Emma: Is there something you're not telling me?",
        "Lucinda: Emma, you know Lily. She talks a better game than she's capable of playing sometimes.",
        "Emma: I think it's too soon for her to come back.",
        "Lucinda: I look at those two girls in there and I think she can't get back here fast enough. They need her. At the same time, I'm worried about her. If she pushes too hard -- I don't care what she says or how she acts -- Lily's fragile. Very fragile.",
        "Emma: Well, we'll just make sure that she takes it slowly. Don't worry, Lucinda. I love her. I love her very much.",
        "Lucinda: Good. Thank God for that.",

        "Holden: Hell if I know.",
        "Carly: What is it with us and cars? First mine breaks down, now yours.",
        "Holden: Anxious to get home?",
        "Carly: Sort of. I want to show Sage the pictures from the camp. Although the thought of going another round with Jack doesn't thrill me.",
        "Holden: You and Jack -- you guys don't fight all the time, do you?",
        "Carly: Pretty much. Actually, that's partly why today was so terrific. I'd forgotten what it's like to just have a good time and not have to defend myself every five seconds.",
        "Holden: You know, when the marriage is working, you feel like you can conquer the world. And when it's not, it's --",
        "Carly: Lonely. Like you keep losing your best friend. You must miss Lily so much.",
        "Holden: You know, I was telling my mother today that when she gets back, she's gonna be stronger and that things are gonna get better. But even when I said it, I knew I was lying.",
        "Carly: Which part isn't true?",
        "Holden: I don't know who's gonna walk through that door. The Lily I fell in love with or the one that I don't trust or someone else altogether.",

        "Liberty: Oh, say that again. You demand me?",
        "Brad: You know what I mean.",
        "Liberty: Yeah. Oh, I get you, but you obviously don't get me, so let's just lay it all out there.",
        "Brad: Good. Go for it. Let's do it.",
        "Liberty: Two days ago, you wouldn't believe you were my dad without a DNA test, so where do you come off bossing me around?",
        "Brad: If I am your dad --",
        "Liberty: I know you're my dad. Even if you don't. But if this is how you're gonna be, I'd rather just go home to my mom.",
        "Brad: Okay. If that's what you want to do, then go.",
        "Liberty: Okay --",
        "Brad: I didn't think so.",

        "Brad: Okay, easy. All right. I talked to your mom this morning.",
        "Liberty: You didn't tell me.",
        "Brad: I know things are rough with you at home, and all I am trying to do is keep you in school, put food in your mouth, a safe place to sleep until the DNA results get in.",

        "Holden: Me, personally?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holden: Well, I've been a stable boy, a corporate exec, TV producer, a horse breeder.",
        "Carly: And how many times have you taken a break from her?",
        "Holden: A few.",
        "Carly: How many times have you come back?",
        "Holden: Every time.",

        "Jack: Why not, Liberty? What happened?",
        "Brad: Go ahead, Liberty. Tell the nice policeman what I did that was so bad. Huh? I grabbed her arm.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Jack: Well, did he hurt you, Liberty? Hmm?",
        "Liberty: Will you arrest him if I said he did?",
        "Jack: Of course.",
        "Brad: Your move.",
        "Liberty: Okay, he didn't hurt me, but I still hate him.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Liberty: Because he's too demanding.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, welcome to my world. Let me introduce you to Brad Snyder, the most condescending, patronizing, egotistical, chauvinistic, arrogant man in the entire universe.",
        "Brad: Gee, thank you, Honey.",
        "Katie: Now ask me why I married him.",
        "Liberty: Why?",
        "Katie: Because he has a good heart. Because he would give his life for me and anyone else he truly loves.",
        "Liberty: He doesn't love me. He doesn't even like me.",
        "Katie: Ignore that. Brad usually gets things wrong before he gets them right, but he'll come around, eventually. You just have to cut him some slack in the meantime.",
        "Liberty: Well, not until he apologizes to me.",
        "[Brad clears throat]",
        "Brad: Yeah, right. I am sorry for grabbing your arm.",
        "Liberty: Apologize for having me arrested.",

        "Katie: Why should he have to apologize? You're the one who messed up.",
        "Jack: Liberty, we know you stole the bracelet. So unless Katie and Brad vouch for you, I'm gonna have to lock you up.",
        "Katie: Or you could apologize for getting arrested and being disrespectful to Brad. The sooner we get out of here, the sooner we can try on our new clothes.",
        "Liberty: I'm sorry, Dad.",
        "Brad: Apology accepted.",
        "Jack: Shall we?",
        "Brad: She just called me Dad.",
        "Katie: It beats the alternatives. Come on, let's go.",
        "Jack: There you go.",

        "Emma: We thought you were Lily.",
        "Holden: Why would you think that?",
