        "Henry: It's -- it's mine? No! No, there's got to be some kind of mistake. Are you saying -- I'm the father? So, what do you think? Which one should I go with?",
        "Vienna: Whatever you want to do is fine with me.",
        "Henry: You don't think that one is more authentic than the other?",
        "Vienna: No, not really.",
        "Henry: Vienna, Sweetheart, how we react to the news is crucial.",
        "Vienna: I know how I'm supposed to react, Henry.",
        "Henry: Good. Good. Okay. Now I will think back, and then it'll hit me! Oh, my god! After the insemination, we didn't wear protection because we thought we were safe!",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God! I'm shocked.",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, you're gonna have to work on that a little, bit, okay? Because the number-one, crucial, vital point here is that we make it look like --",
        "Vienna: I know. We can't let Brad and Katie suspect that we knew that this baby is really ours. So, we convince them of that, and then what?",
        "Henry: We wing it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, when we see the doctor and he gives us the results of the genetic testing, no matter what the results we will be happy.",
        "Brad: No matter what they are, okay, the baby is gonna be perfect. I don't need any test to tell me that.",
        "Katie: Well, no offense, but you're not exactly a geneticist.",
        "Brad: These are my genes we're talking about, all right? We're talking grade- a-quality DNA.",
        "Katie: What if there's something wrong with Vienna's DNA?",
        "Brad: Vienna's only flaw is that she's not you. And that's something we're just gonna have to live with.",
        "Katie: You think I'm being a freak, don't you?",
        "Brad: No. No, I just -- no. I just think that you let that baby psychic get under your skin for some reason.",
        "Katie: Well, she told me to trust my instincts about the baby. That was her way of saying that there was something wrong.",
        "Brad: That's what psychics do. That's how they rope you in.",
        "Katie: No, no. This was different. When I looked into her eyes, I could tell she was telling me the truth. She believed what she was saying.",
        "Brad: When we meet with the doctor and he tells us that the baby is perfectly healthy, will you do something for me?",
        "Katie: Stop listening to psychics?",
        "Brad: No. Yes -- okay? But no. I want you to say, \"Brad, good-looking husband of mine, you were right, as usual. And I will never, ever doubt you again.\"",
        "Katie: I'd rather just tell you to shut up and take your clothes off.",
        "Brad: That works, too.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Katie: I have to get that.",
        "Brad: No, you don't.",
        "Katie: Yes, I do. Hey, Margo, what's up? No, please tell me you're kidding. No, of course you're not kidding. Okay, no, thank you for calling. I will. All right, bye.",
        "Brad: What's wrong?",
        "Katie: My brother's been arrested.",
        "Brad: Craig? Good.",
        "Katie: Brad.",
        "Brad: I'm just saying it couldn't have happened to a slimier guy. What are you doing?",
        "Katie: I'm gonna go see him.",
        "Brad: What about our doctor's appointment?",
        "Katie: I should have time. I'll just -- I'll meet you there.",
        "Brad: Okay, in that case, I'm going to come with you.",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brad: Hell, yeah. I mean, after you, there's no one else who'd I'd like to see in handcuffs more than Craig. Must be genetic.",
        "Katie: Out!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Did Johnny get off to school okay?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I drove him in to school, and I told his teacher what's going on.",
        "Craig: How much does he know?",
        "Lucy: Well, he asked about you, where you are.",
        "Craig: What did you tell him?",
        "Lucy: I told him you had to go on a business trip. He seemed okay with that. He asked about calling you. Hello?",
        "Craig: I'm here. Lucy, thank you for stepping in like this.",
        "Lucy: Oh, no, you don't have to -- I mean, I love Johnny, and I want to do whatever I can to make him happy.",
        "Craig: So do I. Well, you can't help but appreciate the irony that is my life. I'm sitting here in jail, and I didn't actually do anything.",
        "Lucy: I'm sorry.",
        "Craig: It's not your fault. I blame Jack.",
        "Lucy: Jack? Why?",
        "Craig: Are you kidding? He's been waiting a long time for this. I made his month. As far as he's concerned, I won't be able to corrupt Carly or Parker anymore.",
        "Lucy: Daddy, I -- you need to forget about Jack right now. You just need to concentrate on yourself.",
        "Craig: Lucy. The things they're accusing me of -- using Midnight Sun to smuggle guns, murdering that dock worker -- I didn't do any of it. I'm innocent.",
        "Lucy: I know you are.",
        "Craig: You do?",
        "Lucy: Yes. You're surprised?",
        "Craig: Uh, yeah. Frankly, I -- I didn't think you'd ever believe in me again. Just knowing that my word is enough for you.",
        "Lucy: Look, I just -- I hope we can convince the police of the same thing, that you're innocent.",
        "Craig: With you on my side, Lucy, anything's possible.",
        "[Beeping]",
        "Craig: What is that?",
        "Lucy: It's the hospital. I'm on-call. I have to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What do you think, Tom?",
        "Tom: Well, if you're serious about challenging Johnny's custody arrangement, Craig's arrest is definitely gonna work in your favor.",
        "Dusty: And the charges against him?",
        "Tom: Gun smuggling is a serious offense. They're not gonna go lightly on him for that.",
        "Dusty: What about the murder?",
        "Tom: Well, since he hasn't been officially charged with anything, the murder charge will have some traction. I think that if I could get this before a judge, I could have this custody thing reversed by the end of the day.",
        "Dusty: Seriously?",
        "Tom: If you want to pursue it.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, of course. I want my son back.",
        "Tom: All right. You mind if I hang on to this?",
        "Dusty: Keep it.",
        "Tom: Then let me get back to the office. I'll contact the judge.",
        "Dusty: Save the trip. Why don't you give him a call right now?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So are you here on official business?",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Carly: Well, then I guess you're not gonna arrest me or anything, are you?",
        "Jack: Well, I could, if that's what you'd like.",
        "Carly: No.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Now, believe me, I'm perfectly happy out of the line of fire. Thank you.",
        "Jack: I know you're capable of a lot of things, but gunrunning and murder is a bit of a stretch, even for you.",
        "Carly: A bit. Thank you.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Carly: The thing is, we're running into some problems with the investigation, trying to figure out what exactly happened down at the docks.",
        "Carly: What kind of problems?",
        "Jack: Besides Craig insisting that he's innocent?",
        "Carly: Well, maybe he is.",
        "Jack: Except that he refuses to give us anything to back it up.",
        "Carly: Oh, I see. So in your mind, that means he's automatically guilty.",
        "Jack: And all I have to do is prove it.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry, Jack. But I don't think I can help you with that.",
        "Jack: Actually, Carly, I think you're the one person who can.",
        "Carly: I already told you everything I know.",
        "Jack: It's not what you know that I'm after.",
        "Carly: Well, if Craig won't talk to you, I don't know how I could possibly help.",
        "Jack: Well, I was hoping that maybe he'd talk to you.",
        "Carly: And just admit to everything? That he's been using our company to smuggle guns? Come on, Jack.",
        "Jack: Carly, a man is dead. Let's not forget that.",
        "Carly: I haven't.",
        "Jack: You don't think he's guilty, do you?",
        "Carly: So? You don't think he's innocent.",
        "Jack: You don't find it odd that he gave us just enough to let you off but not himself?",
        "Carly: I didn't ask him to do that.",
        "Jack: No, I know that, Carly, but this selfless gesture, it's a bit out of character for Craig, don't you think?",
        "Carly: He knows I didn't have anything to do with this.",
        "Jack: Carly, maybe not, but the longer this goes on --",
        "Carly: What? Are you saying that I could become a suspect again?",
        "Jack: You're his associate, his partner. If this situation escalates -- the only way we'll be able to clear your name is to get Craig to admit what he's done.",
        "Carly: You want me to get Craig to incriminate himself.",
        "Jack: No, I want you to get the truth out of him.",
        "Carly: Isn't that your job?",
        "Jack: He's stonewalling us, Carly! You don't want the investigation to turn in a different direction. Believe me.",
        "Carly: Is that a threat?",
        "Jack: You know me better than that.",
        "Carly: I thought I did.",
        "Jack: Carly, I need you. Help me put this guy away before he inflicts any more damage on our family.",
        "Carly: You're not after the truth, Jack. You're after what you want to be the truth. And I will not help you with that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Elevator bell dings]",
        "Dusty: I was just coming to see you.",
        "Lucy: Is everything okay?",
        "Dusty: Everything's great. With your father's arrest, Tom thinks I can get custody of Johnny by the end of the day.",
        "Lucy: Wow. Wow, that's so fast.",
        "Dusty: I know. Why aren't you more excited?",
        "Lucy: I just can't help but feel guilty about all of this. I mean, it's happening because of me.",
        "Dusty: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: Are you gonna try to tell me that's not true? Because it is. We both know that. My father could not only lose Johnny, but he could spend the rest of his life in prison. And it's all my fault.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Katie, what are you doing here?",
        "Katie: Margo called me.",
        "Craig: I wish she hadn't of done that.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Brad: Yeah, why? I mean, good news of your arrest, I mean, it really deserves to be shared.",
        "Craig: Is he even allowed indoors?",
        "Katie: Stop. Are you okay?",
        "Craig: Given the circumstances, I'm as good as can be expected.",
        "Katie: And what are those circumstances? Margo was out on a call. She couldn't give me the details. What's going on?",
        "Craig: You mean, what am I being charged with? Gun smuggling and murder.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Craig: Well, right now, they're having a little trouble making the murder charge stick, so technically, just the gun smuggling.",
        "Katie: And that's all you have to say?",
        "Craig: I'm innocent. You don't believe me?",
        "Brad: Don't worry, Craig. I believe you, man.",
        "Craig: Oh, good. Because your opinion matters most of all.",
        "Katie: Brad, please, I -- I don't -- I just -- I don't know what to say.",
        "Craig: You don't really think I'd do something like that?",
        "Katie: Do you blame me for having doubts?",
        "Brad: Nope.",
        "Craig: Katie, look at me. I'm your brother. I'm not a murderer.",
        "Brad: Yeah, just ask Paul Ryan. Oh, I'm -- yeah, I know, I know, I know. You didn't kill him. I mean, you tried to of course, but hey --",
        "Katie: Brad! Brad, please!",
        "Brad: I'm just saying, Katie.",
        "Katie: You told me you had changed. I've seen you with Johnny. I thought you were working things out with Lucy. Why? I thought this was different.",
        "Craig: It is.",
        "Katie: You know what? The funny is when Margo called and told me you were arrested, I was actually kind of surprised for a second.",
        "Brad: I wasn't.",
        "Craig: You know what? I bet you weren't.",
        "Brad: Excuse me?",
        "Craig: You're the one that set me up, aren't you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You have no reason to feel guilty.",
        "Lucy: How can you say that? My father wasn't smuggling guns. He didn't murder Cesar.",
        "Dusty: He's done a lot of things -- that he's gotten away with. He's deserves what he's getting.",
        "Lucy: I don't know if I believe that.",
        "Dusty: I thought you wanted Johnny with me.",
        "Lucy: I do. But, Dusty, playing both sides of this, it's a nightmare. He just thanked me for taking care of Johnny. Thanked me!",
        "Dusty: You've always taken care of Johnny. Did the right thing, getting him back to me. Your father does not deserve your sympathy. I'll see you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Just think about what you're doing here. If we don't get a confession out Craig, we're gonna be forced to look at other suspects.",
        "Carly: \"Other suspects\" -- meaning me.",
        "Jack: What do you want me to say, Carly? The evidence didn't clear you. Craig's word cleared you. Are you really willing to risk your entire future on that?",
        "Carly: What about my word, Jack? Doesn't that mean anything?",
        "Jack: I've taken you at your word before, Carly. We both know how that's worked out.",
        "Carly: Cheap shot.",
        "Jack: I'm just trying to get you to see what's at stake here.",
        "Carly: No, you're trying to intimidate me. You're trying to strong-arm me into doing your dirty work for you, and it's not gonna work.",
        "Jack: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Carly: No, you know what, stop talking! This conversation is over. I'd like very much for you to leave. Go on, get out! Come on, Jack. Get out of here.",
        "Jack: Carly, I came by to talk to you, to try to talk some -- what the hell is this?",
        "Carly: What does it look like?",
        "Jack: I thought you were done with this stuff.",
        "Carly: I am. I was. I had a bit of a rough day yesterday, if you recall.",
        "Jack: The bottle's half empty. What's going on?",
        "Carly: It was already open. So you can stop the interrogation, okay?",
        "Jack: You and Craig, you do a lot of drinking together?",
        "Carly: We sell vodka! The drinking happens during business meetings. It's not like we go out on wild benders, Jack.",
        "Jack: Hold on a second. Stop getting so defensive. I'm trying to get to something here.",
        "Carly: Get to what?",
        "Jack: The meetings! How many of them ended with you having had a few too many?",
        "Carly: A few times, I had a few too many. Happy?",
        "Jack: What about Craig? Did he get drunk, too?",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "Jack: Carly, if that's the way it went down -- if you got drunk and he was sober, with all the clients you met, all the meetings you took, how can you be sure you know what really happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh, for crying out loud! Brad, did you set him up?",
        "Brad: No.",
        "Craig: Like the lumberjack has never lied to you before.",
        "Katie: Oh, you know what?",
        "Brad: You know what? Let me. Okay, we're gonna get something real straight here.",
        "Craig: You're not gonna lecture me?",
        "Brad: Stay away! Stay away. Leave us alone. We don't like you, and we're not gonna get pulled into any more of your crooked little dealings, you understand?",
        "Craig: \"Crooked little dealings\"?",
        "Brad: Yeah. Yes, crooked little dealings. All right? Whatever you got going on here, we don't want any part of it. Or you.",
        "Craig: Katie, you might need to take him out. I think he's starting to foam at the mouth.",
        "Katie: All right, maybe it was a mistake coming here.",
        "Craig: Maybe it was.",
        "Brad: You know, by the way. You know, if you were set up, I would love to shake the hand of the man that was responsible.",
        "Katie: Let's just go to the hospital.",
        "Craig: The hospital? What? Is everything all right?",
        "Katie: Everything's fine.",
        "Craig: Right, I forgot. You're having a baby. If I didn't say congrats before, congratulations.",
        "Brad: Yeah, whatever.",
        "Katie: I hope this gets cleared up. 'Cause I would hate for my child not to know his Uncle Craig.",

        "Tom: Sure, sure.",
        "Dusty: Hi, Tom.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Dusty: We all set?",
        "Tom: The judge is waiting for us.",
        "Dusty: Good. Let's get my son back.",
        "Tom: Hold on. Hold on. I just -- I don't want you to get ahead of yourself here.",
        "Dusty: Do I have reason to worry?",
        "Tom: I don't think you do. But the judge may feel differently about the charges against Craig than we do.",
        "Dusty: The judge has to serve Johnny's best interests. That's removing him from Craig's custody, putting him into mine.",
        "Tom: Well, that is our goal. But the judge may not want to make a ruling on Craig's case until that case is settled.",
        "Dusty: I've waited long enough to get my son back, Tom.",
        "Tom: Well, I know you have. Can you do me a favor? Can you promise me that no matter what happens in there, you will maintain control? You think you can do that for me?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I can do that.",
        "Tom: Good.",
        "Dusty: I want you to assure me this is gonna go my way.",

        "Craig: Oh, Lucy. You are a sight for sore eyes.",
        "Lucy: Why do you say that?",
        "Craig: Well, my last visitors weren't so pleasant.",
        "Lucy: Oh, who was here?",
        "Craig: Katie and Brad.",
        "Lucy: What happened?",
        "Craig: Well, Katie seemed genuinely sympathetic to my situation, but Brad was gloating so much, it makes me wonder if Jack isn't responsible for all this.",
        "Lucy: W-wait a minute. You think that -- you think that Brad set you up?",
        "Craig: I know. It's probably giving the oaf a little more credit than he deserves, but --",
        "Lucy: I really don't think that Brad Snyder had anything to do with this.",
        "Craig: I don't know, Lucy. Often the people that bring you down are most often the closest ones to you.",
        "Lucy: I need to talk to you.",
        "Craig: Yeah, we do need to talk. I'm thinking about bringing in some help from the outside. Maybe a private investigator.",
        "Lucy: That's -- that's not what I want to talk about.",
        "Craig: Lucy, are you all right?",
        "Lucy: I just -- I can't help you with any of this.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I know. And you shouldn't have to. You've already been so much help already.",
        "Lucy: No, I haven't. I haven't.",
        "Craig: Yes, you have. Lucy, without you and Johnny, I don't know how I would get through this.",
        "Lucy: Just stop talking. Just -- okay?",
        "Craig: Lucy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.",
        "Lucy: No, it -- okay, there's -- there's something I need to tell you. Since you were arrested, Dusty's went to talk to a judge.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Lucy: He's trying to get Johnny back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey, sorry we're late.",
        "Vienna: Oh, that's okay.",
        "Katie: Did you see the doctor yet?",
        "Vienna: Nope, not yet. Ooh, there's one.",
        "Henry: Yeah, that's not the person who ran the tests. We're waiting for Dr. Chisholm.",
        "Dr. Schmeglitz: Hi, I'm filling in for Dr. Chisholm because he's still in the delivery room.",
        "Katie: Oh, hi, I'm Katie Snyder. This is my husband, Brad. We're the parents of the baby. And this is Vienna Hyatt, who's carrying the child for us, and her partner Henry.",
        "Dr. Schmeglitz: Hi, I'm Dr. Shmeglitz.",
        "Henry: Dr. Shmeglitz?",
        "Brad: No offense, Doctor. I don't think we're gonna be naming the baby after you.",
        "Katie: Brad!",
        "Brad: I'm sorry. You know, expectant father humor. So, I'm assuming you have the test results.",

        "Lucy: No, that's not what I said --",
        "Craig: It makes perfect sense. First he sets me up. He gets me thrown in jail, and then he makes his move to steal my son!",
        "Lucy: I don't think that's what's happened!",
        "Craig: Lucy, I know you still have a teenage crush on the man. But I know what he's capable of. I know what he'll do to get what he wants.",
        "Lucy: No, listen, he may have taken advantage of the situation, but I don't think that he set it up. He wouldn't do that.",
        "Craig: Lucy, don't be so naive.",
        "Lucy: I'm not!",
        "Craig: He's the only one with the connections to make this happen.",
        "Lucy: That doesn't mean he did it.",
        "Craig: Lucy, he would do anything to get his hands on my son.",

        "Craig: The middle? Lucy, I thought you were on my side.",
        "Lucy: How can you not see that this is exactly reason that I took Johnny away in the first place?",
        "Craig: You're not thinking of taking him away again, are you?",
        "Lucy: No. I couldn't do that to him. Johnny can't live on the run, and neither can I.",
        "Craig: I'm glad to hear that. Lucy, that kind of life isn't what I want for either one of you.",

        "Carly: I honestly just don't know how to explain any of this, do you?",
        "Craig: To who? The police? You don't have to do that.",
        "Carly: No. No, I mean, to myself. I mean, how did all of those guns end up in our shipment without either one of us knowing about it?",
        "Craig: I don't know, Carly. That's one of the great mysteries of smuggling -- how things get where they do.",
        "Carly: You know, Craig, a man is dead.",

        "Craig: I'm gonna stop you right there, Carly.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Craig: Because I'm not gonna waste your time. I'm not gonna answer anymore of your questions. You're free to tell Jack that you tried, but I didn't fall for it.",
        "Carly: I am not here because of Jack.",
        "Craig: I know. You're here because you care about me, to make sure that I get all the TLC that every prisoner is entitled to.",
        "Carly: I'm starting to wonder why I bothered.",
        "Craig: If you wait a moment, I'll explain that for you. You bothered because Jack asked you to. What did he say? That you're the next suspect down the list right after me? If you want me to tell you the truth, extend me the same courtesy. If nothing else, we've always been honest with each other.",
        "Carly: Okay. Jack did ask me to talk to you because he thinks that maybe there's something that you're not telling him.",
        "Craig: Thank you. That wasn't so hard, now, was it? Now think about it. You know me. You know my strengths. You know my weaknesses. And you know what I'm really capable of.",
        "Carly: All too well.",
        "Craig: Take all that into account and ask yourself, Carly, do you really think that I'd do something like this?",
        "Carly: You may not want me to answer that.",
        "Craig: All right, I'll ask it a different way. Why do you think I started this vodka business?",
        "Carly: Uh --",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: To drive me insane?",
        "Craig: I did it for us.",

        "Craig: Well, me.",
        "Carly: Ah! Yeah, you see, now, that I believe.",
        "Craig: I did it so I could get closer to you. So I wouldn't have to explain myself every time you answered your door.",
        "Carly: Wait -- I asked you that, a-and when I asked you that --",
        "Craig: I denied it.",
        "Carly: Well, so much for being honest with each other.",
        "Craig: Carly, if you knew my real motives I never would've stood a chance.",
        "Carly: My God! I've been so gullible.",
        "Craig: Can't say it didn't work, though. We did get closer, Carly. We connected.",
        "Carly: Okay, just stop it. Because this whole time, you -- you just played me.",
        "Craig: Did I really, Carly? Don't turn what we had into something trivial. Because it wasn't.",
        "Carly: Fine. We had s-something.",
        "Craig: Yeah, it was something, all right. And it didn't have anything to do with smuggling guns or murdering dock workers.",
        "Carly: Okay. Okay, Craig, so if you stand here unjustly accused, then who do you think is really responsible?",
        "Craig: I've got a pretty good idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Didn't you think Henry was acting a little weird at the hospital?",
        "Brad: Well, what's weird to us is, like, normal to Henry. I mean, the man plays dress-up. Why should we be surprised at what comes out of his mouth?",
        "Katie: It's just the way he was grilling that doctor. He was so intense.",
        "Brad: Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah, it was a bit over the top. But you know how protective he is of Vienna.",
        "Katie: I don't think he was being protective of Vienna.",
        "Brad: Then, what do you mean?",
        "Katie: I can't believe I'm about to say this, but -- I think Henry is getting a little too attached to the baby. You don't think?",
        "Brad: No. No. No, okay, this is Henry we're talking about. The only full house that he's interested in is one that he can cash in on. Why are you looking for trouble?",
        "Katie: I'm not.",
        "Brad: Yeah, you are.",
        "Katie: No, I'm not! I'm just thinking that maybe Vienna's not gonna be the one who has a problem giving up the baby.",
        "Brad: What, are your instincts are telling you this?",
        "Katie: Oh, my God!",
        "Brad: Oh, Katie! Oh, Katie, come on! Katie -- Katie, I was kidding. I was just kidding. You really don't think Henry's gonna be a problem, do you?",
        "Katie: Yes, I do. And you know what? He has no claim to this baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Answer me, Vienna. What did you do?",
        "Vienna: I didn't do anything.",
        "Henry: No, I-I've been to the doctor with you before, several times, and I have never seen money exchange hands until today. So, one more time, what is up with you and Dr. Schmagoo?",
        "Vienna: Why are you being like this?",
        "Henry: Oh, my God. You bribed him.",
        "Vienna: No.",
        "Henry: Yes, you bribed him! You paid him to break his Hippocratic Oath.",
        "Vienna: How can you say that? I would never do such a thing!",
        "Henry: Only you did, Sweetheart.",
        "Vienna: No, I didn't. Because he never took his Hippocratic-tatic oath!",
        "Henry: How do you know that? How do you know that?!",
        "Vienna: Because he's not a doctor.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Vienna: He's a comedian.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Vienna: He's a stand-up comedian. I met him here at metro, and I asked him to do me a favor.",
        "Henry: You paid him to pretend to be your doctor. Why?",
        "Vienna: You know why.",
        "Henry: Vienna, Sweetheart, we agreed that the results of the genetic test would be the best way for the truth to come out that this -- this baby is mine. It's really mine.",
        "Vienna: Yes, it is.",
        "Henry: And yet, you get this doctor, this guy, this very unfunny guy, by the way, to tell Brad and Katie that it wasn't. How could you do that?",
        "Vienna: Why don't you answer something for me?",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Vienna: Why are you so upset that Brad and Katie didn't find out that this is your baby?",

        "Dusty: Yeah. Lucy, you kept my relationship with my son alive despite your father trying to cut me out of his life.",
        "Lucy: Which is what you're gonna do to him.",
        "Dusty: He deserves it. What is it?",
        "Lucy: I went to see him.",
        "Dusty: Craig? Why?",
        "Lucy: I thought he deserved to know what was going on with Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Why do you waste your time feeling for him?",
        "Lucy: Excuse me? I know you don't want to see it, Dusty, but my father is the victim here.",
        "Dusty: Lucy --",
        "Lucy: No, he is. For once, he is. He lost Johnny, and he's sitting in that cell, and it's all my fault.",
        "Dusty: We did what's best for Johnny.",
        "Lucy: Did we?",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Lucy: He -- he suggested that maybe you set him up so that you could get custody of Johnny. I defended you. I said you would never do that.",
        "Dusty: You're asking me if it's true.",
        "Lucy: Is it? Tell me you didn't set my father up so that you could get Johnny.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: It's just that, if Henry's possessiveness over Vienna is spilling over to the baby she's carrying for us --",
        "Brad: The love of his life is pregnant with some other man's child. If the situation was reversed and that was you, I'd --",
        "Katie: Okay. I know. I know. So, you're saying that this is something that's just gonna blow over?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I am.",

        "Brad: Look at me. Nothing's going to go wrong.",
        "Katie: Promise?",
        "Brad: I promise. Look at it this way. Henry's never wanted children. If he doesn't want one of his own, he's definitely not going to want to raise another man's child.",
        "Henry: All I'm saying is they have rights. They should know that you're carrying my baby and not Brad's.",
        "Vienna: Why?",
        "Henry: Why, because they're our best friends, and we can't lie to them forever.",
        "Vienna: We made a deal with them.",
        "Henry: We made a deal, and that was for their baby. That's not what happened.",
        "Vienna: Okay, so, you want to tell them the truth?",
        "Henry: I think it's only fair.",
        "Vienna: Okay, fine. Fine. So we'll them that I am carrying your baby, not Brad's.",

        "Vienna: Then what?",
        "Henry: Then it is all out in the open!",
        "Vienna: Then what if they don't want the baby?",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, they would never renege on that.",
        "Vienna: But why would they want a baby that is not theirs?",
        "Henry: Because -- because they're not like that. Because they want to be parents.",
        "Vienna: She might want to try again. And then they might want to use a different surrogate, too.",
        "Henry: Right, okay. Then what'll we do with that baby?",
        "Vienna: I'm not comfortable giving Sven to strangers to raise. So I guess we'll just have to keep him.",
        "Henry: Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. I see what you're doing here. No, no.",
        "Vienna: Well, isn't that why you're so upset, because you want us to raise our baby?",
        "Henry: No. No, no, it's not. It's because I am not comfortable lying to our best friends.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you're a fine one talking about lying. You, who's doing everything you can to avoid admitting the truth!",

        "Dusty: Yeah. Especially when it's my son's welfare at stake. I thought you'd be happy about the turnout here.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, you know that I want you to raise him. I never wanted my father to raise him.",
        "Dusty: Then what's the problem?",
        "Lucy: I don't know how I'm supposed to live with myself if I let my father go to jail for something he didn't do.",
        "Dusty: All right. I understand. I do. He's your father, and you love him.",
        "Lucy: So what do I do?",
        "Dusty: Give it time.",
        "Lucy: For what?",
        "Dusty: For Tom to make sure that I have permanent custody of my son. Then we'll see where we are. If your father's still in jail, we'll try to set things right.",

        "Craig: It's exactly his style. He had the means. He had the motive. I just can't figure out how he got the opportunity. Except Jack would like to see me fry just as much as Dusty would.",
        "Carly: Are you -- if you're trying to imply that you think that Jack had something to do with this, you're absolutely wrong! He would never do it.",
        "Craig: Would you wake up? If Jack thought he had a way to keep me out of your life, out of Parker's life, be the big town hero one more time? I mean, even I have to admit, that that would answer a lot of people's prayers.",
