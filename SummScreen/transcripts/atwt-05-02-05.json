        "Holden: I'm sorry. The least you deserve is some peace. At least maybe now we'll get some answers about how you died.",
        "Lucinda: Uh, good morning. Hi.",
        "Holden: What are you doing here?",
        "Lucinda: Emma told me that you would be here. I'm sorry that I'm -- if I'm interrupting something. It's just, I've got Lily on my mind.",
        "Holden: Lily and I are separated. I'm not the person you should be coming to.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Well, you tell me who, then?! You tell me who! Who else has loved her for half of his life?",
        "Holden: That is not the answer to everything. And it certainly doesn't change they way things are now.",
        "Lucinda: Well, she's still in danger.",
        "Holden: Lily is not going to jail.",
        "Lucinda: That's not the problem.",

        "Lily: Did you lose your phone?",
        "Keith: No. I just turned it off for awhile.",
        "Lily: I was worried.",
        "Keith: Well, you know, I just felt like I wasn't -- fit company.",
        "Lily: Oh. I don't think anybody would be after what we found out. To think that Les killed Julia out of anger was one thing, but the fact that he deliber -- it's a good thing you turned off your phone, 'cause I'm so much fun, aren't I?",
        "Keith: I think you are. And I'm counting on it.",
        "Lily: Really? Why?",
        "Keith: Well, okay -- I can't do anything for Julia right now. J.J.'s back in school. I feel like I've been handcuffed to this misery, this responsibility. I -- I feel like I need an escape, I need to get away. I think you do, too. Do you want to come with me?",

        "Alison: Oh, yeah, all my bills. Goody.",
        "Will: Cheer up. The cosmetic companies have missed you, and they're holding a special gift just for you. And of course, you may have already won $10 million.",
        "Alison: Do you want to come in and have a soda?",
        "Will: Sure. Let me get your bag. So how was the trip?",

        "Tom: Now, we promised ourselves we were never going to let that get out of hand.",
        "Margo: I know. I won't. It's fine. Everything's fine. I promise you. How's the Larrabee case?",
        "Tom: I think that's about to wrap finally. So, you're sure there's nothing you want to tell me?",
        "Margo: If there is, I will tell you. I promise.",

        "Jennifer: I am so sick of being jerked around. You know, there's a company, there's not a company. I have to work with Jordan, then I have to work with Craig --",
        "Dusty: Take a breath!",
        "Jennifer: How long, Dusty?!",
        "Dusty: How long what?",
        "Jennifer: How long would I get to keep my company? Huh? Until Craig pulls another stunt? Oh, oh, that's it, isn't it? That's why I would get to keep my company, because you want to have another excuse to go after Craig.",
        "Dusty: I don't need an excuse. Believe me --",
        "Jennifer: Just forget it. Forget it.",
        "Dusty: Can I get a word in?",

        "Dusty: Not anymore. Me and Craig. Not anymore.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: Look, this is how it goes, Jen. We will pay you a good salary, you can work, and it's all good if you make Street Jeans money.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, you closed me down. All right, no matter how much I begged you, everything was finished. Street Jeans was finished, you said. So why the 180? What has changed?",
        "Dusty: Everything.",
        "Jennifer: What everything?",
        "Dusty: Craig's gone.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: But there aren't really charges against Craig?",
        "Margo: No. It was just a rotten trick, but it's the only thing we could come up with to make sure he'd get out of the country and leave everybody alone.",
        "Katie: So, he's really gone?",
        "Margo: Yeah. And I'm sorry. I know that you didn't get a chance to say good- bye to him, but we had to move fast on this or it wouldn't work at all. You want to take a shot at me? Come on.",
        "Katie: No, no. What? No. I'll be fine. It's just weird, you know? I mean, no matter what, he is our brother.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know. But Craig's been off the tracks for a while now. I mean, he's always been a user, but this time, he went over the line.",
        "Katie: Well, it will be easier for a lot of people to have him gone.",
        "Margo: But not for you.",
        "Katie: Yeah, even for me. I mean -- you know how hard it is to see him hurt people.",
        "Margo: I know. But if you ever miss him so much you can't stand it and you wonder if anyone understands, call me, I do.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Margo: Okay. You know, here comes your husband, and he can't know anything about it, or I am in a lot of trouble -- a lot of people are in a lot of trouble. We can make it vague. Just say Craig had a business deal that went south, he left, that's it.",
        "Katie: Okay. Got it. And you take care. Listen, for what it's worth, you did the right thing.",
        "Margo: Oh, it's worth a lot.",
        "Katie: You and Tom come over soon, okay?",
        "Henry: Well, I'm all square with the law. What do you say we take advantage of the next few hours, huh? Okay. What did Margo want?",

        "Alison: And the necklace that Aaron gave to me, it was engraved. Why would anybody take it? I mean, they couldn't sell it, \"to Alison, with love forever, Aaron.\"",
        "Hal: I know. Alison, I know, it feels awful.",
        "Alison: They touched all my stuff.",

        "Alison: No, it was like that when we came in, right?",
        "Will: Right.",
        "Hal: Oh. Well, then I'm going to dust it for prints. This isn't a forced entry.",

        "Will: I don't remember.",
        "Hal: Alison, why don't you come and stay with us for a while? Emily will only be gone for another night. I'm sure she wants you to stay with us.",

        "Will: I'll help you.",

        "Alison: No, there's paychecks that need to be signed. I need to pay people.",
        "Hal: All right, then, I tell you what, I'll stay here until you get back. Can you take her over?",

        "Alison: Thanks.",
        "Will: It's going to be all right. Okay, Ali? We'll take care of stuff at Metro and then we'll come right back here, get everything cleaned up, put it back in its place. You won't even know it ever happened, okay?",

        "Holden: Lucinda, I came here for a little privacy. I think I deserve it, don't you?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely, I respect that. I really do. But I, frankly, am more concerned with the living than with the dead. And you may wash your hands of Lily if you want to. That is your choice, but your children are living with her, and any man that she moves into the ambience is going to affect their lives.",
        "Holden: So, you want me to get custody? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Lucinda: You are purposely misunderstanding me.",
        "Holden: And you are purposely trying to manipulate me.",
        "Lucinda: I am not. I'm just scared.",
        "Holden: Okay. All right, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I was going to go see the kids today anyway. I will go over there, and I will see what's up.",

        "Lucinda: Of course.",
        "Holden: Good.",

        "Lily: I should've known this would be your idea of taking a break.",
        "Keith: Well, come on. Its fun, isn't it?",
        "Lily: Yes, it is fun.",
        "Keith: That's why I love it up here. Everything is so free, you know what I mean? Everything down there seems so small. It's not even worth troubling your mind.",
        "Lily: Yes, instant perspective. Everything goes from hazy to clear in the matter of a minute. I wish life could be more like that.",
        "Keith: Well, you know, up here in the cockpit, things come into focus. All the possibilities, you know? All the room.",
        "Lily: Like it's all up to you.",

        "Keith: When your kid was in trouble, you jumped right into action. You would've done anything --",
        "Lily: Yeah, I was grasping at straws. I would do anything to keep my family together. I felt like I was shoveling water.",

        "Lily: Me?",
        "Keith: Yeah, yeah. Take it, take it, take it, take it --",
        "Lily: No! I don't -- I don't know how to fly a plane! Oh, oh! We're plunging. We can't do this. Please, keith, do something!",
        "Keith: I am doing something. I am giving you a chance to have the adventure of a lifetime.",

        "Dusty: Jen, I promise you -- he's gone.",
        "Jennifer: You did this, didn't you?",

        "Jennifer: Well, you didn't -- Craig is still alive, isn't he?",

        "Dusty: You with me? It's done now. Craig's gone. And Worldwide is ready to back you. If you can handle it.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I can handle it. I could always handle the work.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah? You got to give it 100%. No taking off in the middle of the night, leaving everybody high and dry! Worldwide pulled out 'cause of you, not Craig. Don't forget that.",
        "Jennifer: You won't let me forget it.",
        "Dusty: 'Cause that's my job, Jen. Keeping it together is yours. And I know you're going through a tough time right now, hormonally and otherwise --",
        "Jennifer: Excuse me?",
        "Dusty: Maybe you can't handle it, you know? And maybe you don't want to, now that Craig's gone. You might get back with Mike, whatever. Whatever decision you make, stick with it. So what's it gonna be?",

        "Margo: You'll be dancing with me, darling. What other reason do you need?",
        "Tom: Um, no other reason. Why don't you just go out and get a dress, a facial, something? Whatever you want.",

        "Jennifer: Mike, this was a unique situation that could have hurt you worse than any --",

        "Jennifer: Mike, you didn't grow up the way I did, all right? I've always had someone fighting over me or bargaining with me. But I've never really had someone who just loves me no matter what. So it just takes a little getting used to. Especially after I've done so much to ruin it.",
        "Mike: The one thing that messed it up was sending me away.",
