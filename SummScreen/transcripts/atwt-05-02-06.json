        "Casey and Gwen's opening night is a success, as Maddie and Will view this pretty much from the sidelines. Will has an verbal altercation with Jade about her pretending to be Rose's daughter. She witnesses an exchange between him and Barbara and praises him on matching her fake sweetness point for point, but Will wonders if that is the same tactic she used on Lily and Holden? Luke later tells Jade he can't live this lie anymore. Will wonders about his mother's offer to send Gwen and Casey to Chicago. Gwen is upset Carly missed her singing and when Jack shows some concern for Carly having left, Gwen calls him on it. Carly and Nick hang out at her house, but later show back up at Crash, where Jack sees them come in together. He questions Carly who takes a tough stance with him, and then asks him point blank if he is jealous of her and Nick? Jack claims he is not, but he leaves quickly after Carly tries to put up a brave front by making a beeline to dance with Nick. As Hal and Susan hold vigil at Emily's bedside, Emily manages to mutter Paul's name. Bob tells them that is a good sign, and that they should find Paul and have him help them bring Emily out of it. Hal begrudgingly locates him and Meg, as they are ready to go upstairs to Meg's room. Meg convinces Paul to do it after he worries it could make matters worse for Emily. Paul sits with Emily and finally she opens her eyes."

        "Lisa: I couldn't have done it without you, sugar.",
        "Casey: It came out okay, huh?",
        "Lisa: You and Gwen have made this the best club in town. Every table in the place is full. And my hostess is overloaded with people trying to get reservations. I'm going to go help her. Handsome and talented. What a combo.",
        "Margo: Hey Lisa, congratulations. Another big success. It must get old.",
        "Lisa: Oh, don't use that word. Thanks for coming.",
        "Margo: I wouldn't have missed this. My handsome and talented son's big debut.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Margo: Hey, I know I've said this before. I'm so proud of you.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Margo: I said I'm proud of you. Is that loud music making you deaf?",
        "Casey: Nah, I did want to hear it again. It's been a long time since you've said it twice in one night.",
        "Margo: Not only am I proud of you for all of this. You kept up your schoolwork too. You're going to graduate with honors.",
        "Casey: And I have an amazing girlfriend, who makes it all work.",
        "Margo: What? Was that the g word?",
        "Casey: Are you going to embarrass me now?",
        "Margo: If at all possible.",
        "Casey: Fortunately you already know her so it's not going to be hard. Want to dance?",
        "Maddie: Sure.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Mrs. Hughes.",
        "Margo: There she is, our star.",
        "Gwen: No way.",
        "Margo: Lisa has been singing your praises.",
        "Gwen: I owe her so much for this.",
        "Margo: Don't get too famous too fast.",
        "Gwen: Not a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I know all about it. You tried to pass yourself off as Rose's daughter.",
        "Jade: And that's supposed to hurt, coming from you? You killed the woman! I can't believe you get to walk around.",
        "Jack: Hey Will, have you seen Margo?",
        "Will: She's inside.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Jade: Will, wait. Please don't go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: And here he is. Oakdale's finest is taking a break.",
        "Jack: No.",
        "Margo: Oh, come on. You deserve a little R&R. It's the hottest spot in town and you're going to stay and have some fun.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Thanks again for the ride.",
        "Nick: It was no problem.",
        "Carly: And for scaring the ghosts out of the basement.",
        "Nick: I always wanted to be a ghostbuster.",
        "Carly: You can go, Nick. Thanks.",
        "Nick: Did you just dismiss me?",
        "Carly: No, no, I just -- I don't need a babysitter. I may've been a little wobbly before, but I am now officially stone cold sober. So you don't have to stay on my account.",
        "Nick: Okay.",
        "Carly: And I feel like a jerk for missing Gwen's show. If I go right now maybe I can catch some of it.",
        "Nick: You want to go back to the club?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Nick: That's a bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I have to stay. Just until Emily wakes up.",
        "Meg: She's in hypovolemic shock, Paul. If she does wake up, it could be a long time.",
        "Paul: You don't think she will.",
        "Meg: Emily's brain was without oxygen for a while. We don't know how much damage that did.",
        "Paul: So the sooner she wakes up, the better. Right?",
        "Meg: Yeah, that would be a good sign. But it wouldn't mean -",
        "Paul: Then she'll wake up. Emily's strong. She'll be okay.",
        "Susan: Leave.",
        "Paul: As soon as she wakes up.",
        "Susan: You are the last person she needs to see. Go!",
        "Meg: Susan had no right.",
        "Paul: Yes, she does. Let's go.",
        "Hal: It's me, Em. Can you hear me? Squeeze my hand if you can hear. That's okay, I'll wait. But you knew that, didn't you? No matter what I said, I was waiting. Still am. I won't leave you, honey. Did she?",
        "Susan: Yes.",
        "Hal: She heard me. Emily?",
        "Emily: Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Oh, come on. Let me buy you a drink.",
        "Jack: It's an official visit. It's Emily.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Jack: They found her. She was on one of the bluffs. Word has it Paul was there before the police and tried to talk her down but she jumped.",
        "Margo: Oh, my God, Emily is dead?",
        "Jack: She survived the fall from what I understand she still hasn't woken up.",
        "Margo: I gotta tell Tom.",
        "Jack: he is not answering the phone or pager. That's why I though you might know where he is.",
        "Margo: he is home with danny right now. I got to go. I don't want to ruin the night.",
        "Jack: I'll tell them its police business. No problem.",
        "Margo: Thanks.",
        "Jack: You got it. You're a big star now. Not talking to me anymore?",
        "Gwen: Jack.",
        "Jack: That almost qualifies. You're avoiding me now because of what happened with Carly is that it?",
        "Gwen: Is that why she left?",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: She left before I went on the stage.",
        "Jack: Not because of anything I did. Gwen, I just got here. I didn't even know Carly was here until you told me right now.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Jack: You're saying she left. She was upset?",
        "Gwen: I don't know. I have to go.",
        "Jack: Wait a second. Gwen!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I'm sorry. I just had a fight with my boyfriend and I took it out on you. It was lousy to bring up Rose's death. You were a kid. From what I hear, it wasn't really your fault.",
        "Barbara: Hi, honey. Why are you standing out here?",
        "Will: Good question.",
        "Barbara: Has Gwen already played?",
        "Will: Yeah, she was great.",
        "Barbara: I'm so sorry I missed it. But I was working for the cause, so I think I have an excuse.",
        "Will: The cause?",
        "Barbara: The tickets for Casey and Gwen's trip to Chicago.",
        "Will: What?",
        "Barbara: The Acid Rain tour. Now I know it sounds nauseating to me but I know they're over the moon about it. And it'll really help them book really good talent in here. You do know Gwen and Casey are going off together, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, have you guys seen Will?",
        "Casey: Not for a while.",
        "Jack: Carly's car is still in the parking lot.",
        "Gwen: Okay.",
        "Jack: Is it?",
        "Gwen: Why are you asking me?",
        "Jack: You said she went home. So how'd she get home?",
        "Gwen: No clue.",
        "Jack: You're sure.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'm sure.",
        "Jack: You said she was here, upset, went home, only her car is still here. If there's something going on -",
        "Gwen: If there is, it's not your problem, right? You walked. So why do you care what happens with Carly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: It looked like you had a lousy time tonight trying to have fun that's why you got drunk.",
        "Carly: Well at least I didn't dance on the table. That's when you know I'm in trouble.",
        "Nick: Mrs. Jack Snyder dances on tables.",
        "Carly: I'm still Carly. Carly Tenney. I loved Jack. And I miss him so much sometimes I can't even breathe. But I am still me, a woman that can do more than just survive. I can go out on my own. I can be a good sister. I can spend time with my friends. I can dance the night away if that's what I want to do.",
        "Nick: You don't believe it any more.",
        "Carly: It used to be true. It will be again but you're right tonight is different. When I walked into the club it surprised me. How hard it was on my own. But there's only one cure for that.",
        "Nick: You really want to go back tonight.",
        "Carly: Yes! I am sick of listening to my own sad thoughts. I want to have fun.",
        "Nick: Then I'm driving.",
        "Carly: Great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Emily, its Mom. It's Mom.",
        "Bob: I got the page.",
        "Susan: She woke up.",
        "Bob: Could she focus?",
        "Susan: She didn't open her eyes long enough to tell.",
        "Bob: Are you sure she was conscious?",
        "Susan: She spoke.",
        "Bob: Words or just sounds?",
        "Hal: She said \"Paul.\"",
        "Bob: Was she asking for him?",
        "Susan: No!",
        "Hal: Probably.",
        "Bob: This is a good sign. Speech in itself indicates a high level of brain function. If it was cognitive, if Emily actually asked for someone, that's even better.",
        "Hal: I don't know that for sure.",
        "Bob: We've got to find out. As soon as she can show us that she can focus on something the better. And that something may be Paul.",
        "Susan: Emily. Honey. You need to wake up. Emily?",
        "Bob: Where is Paul?",
        "Hal: He was right outside.",
        "Bob: Not when I came in.",
        "Hal: So he's left her high and dry again. Big surprise.",
        "Susan: I sent him away.",
        "Bob: Get him back.",
        "Susan: Do you know how many times he's broken her heart? I can't even count that high. He might as well have pushed her off that cliff with both hands.",
        "Hal: She's right.",
        "Bob: Yes. But if his name is the only world that's coming from Emily's mouth --.",
        "Susan: Maybe she was having a nightmare.",
        "Bob: Is that what it sounded like? Her vitals were steady. No sign of distress. Right now you two seem more distressed than she is.",
        "Hal: The last time Paul tried to talk her down, she jumped. What if he makes her worse?",
        "Bob: She's hit bottom. He can't make it worse. We need Emily awake, whatever it takes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You know that Susan and Hal won't call.",
        "Paul: I don't even need this thing.",
        "Meg: I know the shift nurse in ICU. I know she could give us updates on Emily's condition.",
        "Paul: Thanks.",
        "Meg: Shall I go ask the bartender for a deck of cards? We can start a new gin rummy tournament.",
        "Paul: I can't.",
        "Meg: Yes we can. It will take the pain away. Remember? I know I left the scorecard at the cabin but I do remember that I was winning. I'll go get the cards.",
        "Paul: Please, please, don't. It's not going to help.",
        "Meg: I will not sit here and watch you tear yourself apart for what Emily has done.",
        "Paul: I drove her to this.",
        "Meg: Paul, she tried to kill herself after shooting you, holding Dusty hostage and nearly killing him. There is nothing that you did that anybody did that justifies that.",
        "Paul: I should have seen it coming.",
        "Meg: You did. But you were a little busy recovering from that bullet she put in you. I think you're forgiven for not staging an intervention.",
        "Paul: Maybe. But it was a terrible idea to marry her.",
        "Meg: She had Dusty chained to a wall bleeding to death. We had to find out where. Come on, stop.",
        "Paul: I can't. I keep seeing her on the cliff. You know and I thought I had her she's about to take my hand.",
        "Meg: Then I showed up.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Meg: It's true. Emily thought there was still a chance between the two of you until I showed up. I guess I pushed her off the edge. I put her in the hospital. It's not. I'm responsible.",
        "Paul: No, Meg, no.",
        "Meg: Yes. That's right. No. I'm not responsible any more than you are. You have to let this go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: I knew about the trip to Chicago.",
        "Barbara: Really? Just you seem add little surprised.",
        "Will: Only because you obviously didn't know that Gwen is not going. She found out you were behind it and she decided she couldn't.",
        "Barbara: Well, why not?",
        "Will: It's too generous, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I'm just trying to help. It's my pleasure to help.",
        "Will: We so appreciate it, thank you. Mom, come on. Who is fighting. Enjoy the party. Okay?",
        "Barbara: I will. I'll see you inside.",
        "Jade: Wow, she's good.",
        "Will: You're still here?",
        "Jade: I wasn't going to miss a good show. The way you matched her point for point was totally awesome. you totally didn't let her get to you.",
        "Will: I learn add few survival skills.",
        "Jade: I can tell. Won't give her anything to fight against no matter what she trying to pull. That little catch in her voice when she tried to make peace with you. Pretty convincing.",
        "Will: Yeah. Is that what you did?",
        "Jade: What?",
        "Will: When Holden and Lily found out you were scamming them.",
        "Jade: Is that what you think of me? Will; That was good. I was wounded and hurt. A little catch. That's what I think of you. Otherwise I can't figure out why you're not in jail right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Where is she?",
        "Luke: hey Lisa. This is a great party.",
        "Lisa: When are you going to introduce me?",
        "Luke: To who.",
        "Lisa: Lilly told me this young woman has totally stolen your heart away.",
        "Luke: She told you that, did she?",
        "Lisa: Yeah.",
        "Luke: Did she tell you everything?",
        "Lisa: Uh-huh. Yep.",
        "Luke: And you still want to meet her?",
        "Lisa: Of course I did.",
        "Luke: Then she must not have told you everything. Do you know that she lied about who she was?",
        "Lisa: Yes, I know that. I know she pretended to be Rose's daughter but your mom said if she made you happy that's all that matters to her.",
        "Luke: She said that?",
        "Lisa: Yeah. So when am i going to meet her?",
        "Reporter: Ms. Grimaldi?",
        "Lisa: Yeah.",
        "Reporter: I need a few quotes for my story.",
        "Lisa: Okay. You're going to stick around now right?",
        "Luke: Yeah, I'll be here.",
        "Lisa: That's a good thing. I'll be right back. This will just take a minute. I want to meet this young woman and see if she is good enough for you. Here I come.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly is not picking up at home.",
        "Gwen: I don't really get it. You told carly your marriage was over, done, forget about it. Why are you tracking her down?",
        "Jack: Something could have happened she is still the mother of my kid.",
        "Gwen: Look at me, Jack. Do you honestly believe that she is in danger and you're protecting her because you care about your kids?",
        "Jack: Probably not.",
        "Gwen: So what is really going on? It's not fair to her if she thinks you two have a chance. I get a free drink for working here and I can't drink it.",
        "Jack: I don't want your drink, you're just trying to get me out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: You heard? Yeah, Jack tried to call. Couldn't get through.",
        "Tom: Yeah, he did. Danny of course wanted to hear his favorite book, The Titanic. Had a million questions. What happened? Why did it sink and the phone is ringing and I'm letting the boys -- why couldn't they save all the people and my pager is going off and I'm just ignoring that. So I want to answer all the questions so I can hold his hand until he falls asleep because he's in that place.",
        "Margo: That poor kid. He's always expecting the next disaster. Always asking the questions about everything that could possibly go wrong. Doesn't want to hear any other story.",
        "Tom: A pretty good understanding of the world he was going into.",
        "Margo: No, no, only part of it, Tom. No, you never failed him.",
        "Tom: I don't know. How I help him. I called the sitter and had her come down here so the phone wouldn't be ringing at the house. I don't want him to hear something.",
        "Margo: Any word on Emily?",
        "Tom: She is still out. I talked to Dad. She stopped breathing up on the cliff and lack of oxygen. That could be brain damage. She could pull through or not.",
        "Margo: No, really, we can say that. Even after everything Emily has done she is still a human being. No one deserves this.",
        "Tom: I know I was pretty mean to Susan about -- how does a mother leave her son with a watch and a note.",
        "Margo: When's the last time you talked to her.",
        "Tom: Dad is keeping an eye on her.",
        "Margo: Everything is a free ride on this one.",
        "Tom: No. Not everybody. How could nobody see this coming?",
        "Margo: Because, Emily is good, Tom. She's a survivor and she forceful and I'm sure that she held it together so nobody could see this coming.",
        "Tom: In the end she cracked wide open. For Danny's sake she can put herself back together again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: This is wrong.",
        "Nurse: What?",
        "Susan: This kress is too -- drip is too slow.",
        "Nurse: This is the way the doctor ordered it.",
        "Susan: I am a doctor. And I am telling you it is wrong. Fix it.",
        "Nurse: I'll page Dr. Li Nu.",
        "Bob: You looking for a fight?",
        "Susan: Yes, I am but it's with her and she won't wake up.",
        "Bob: You and Emily. The fights were the best ever.",
        "Susan: There's no movement. Not even involuntary. She has been completely still. I don't have to tell you that Emily Stewart is never still. She gave me a present today.",
        "Bob: What was that?",
        "Susan: Before she left she told me she remember add vacation that we took at the beach when she was nine or ten. One of the few times I wasn't drunk and we had a really good time. After that, very nice reminiscence I paid her back by calling the cops and that's probably the last memory she has of me.",
        "Bob: You were trying to protect her.",
        "Susan: Think it felt that way to her?",
        "Bob: Susan you didn't put her on that cliff.",
        "Susan: I didn't stop her.",
        "Bob: No one could.",
        "Susan: Paul could have.",
        "Bob: Maybe he can again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're amazing. You know that? You are. This is probably the last place in the world you want to be.",
        "Meg: It's where you are. So that's where I am.",
        "Paul: You deserve better.",
        "Meg: Yeah, and you're on the hook for it. Don't worry.",
        "Paul: Don't lose the score pad. Hold on to it. Want another drink?",
        "Meg: We can't. It was last call when we got these.",
        "Paul: I completely lost track of time. And place. Look at us. Meg, we're in public together.",
        "Meg: Yeah, instead of jail. Pretty nice change of pace.",
        "Paul: Yeah, we're free. Going to enjoy this.",
        "Meg: Well don't rush it. You have time.",
        "Paul: look. The truth is I don't need to force anything. You make me happy. You know that? I'm so glad you didn't run from the house. You're a gift. A precious gift.",
        "Meg: You know, I realize we're in public.",
        "Paul: I just said that, didn't I?",
        "Meg: Come upstairs with me?",
        "Hal: Your phone is off.",
        "Paul: You called?",
        "Hal: Yes. You need to get back to the hospital right away.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Hal: Because Emily woke up and she wants you.",
        "Paul: What do you mean, Emily wants me?",
        "Hal: She woke up and said your name. She spoke?",
        "Hal: One word anyway.",
        "Meg: That's a good sign.",
        "Hal: That's what Bob said. But that was it. One word, then she was back out. They need to keep Emily awake and responsive. Bob thinks seeing you could be the push she needs.",
        "Paul: Or not. This could be a bad idea.",
        "Hal: Right.",
        "Paul: Hold on, Hal.",
        "Hal: I read you loud and clear, Ryan.",
        "Paul: No, you don't! I don't want to make things worse, Hal. That's all.",
        "Hal: Things couldn't be any worse.",
        "Paul: What is she going to think? I'm in love with her and coming back to her. And what happens when she finds out that's not true?",
        "Hal: That doesn't have to be the first thing out of your mouth.",
        "Paul: I can't lie to her again.",
        "Meg: Maybe you won't have to. Don't worry about that right now. Think of it as a chance to pull Emily back off that cliff again.",
