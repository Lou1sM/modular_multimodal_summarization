        "Casey: Thanks, Mom.",
        "Tom: So, eat your breakfast, Buddy, you've got a long day ahead of you.",
        "Casey: Yeah, we wouldn't want me going to prison on an empty stomach.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Margo: Hi, Guys.",
        "Will: Hey.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Will: We hope its okay. We weren't sure when he was going to leave.",
        "Margo: Yeah, come on in.",
        "Gwen: Thanks. Hey, there.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Gwen: No, no, no, finish your food. We didn't want to interrupt.",
        "Casey: No, I'm glad you guys came.",
        "Gwen: We wouldn't let you go without saying good-bye.",
        "Casey: That means a lot, really.",
        "Tom: Sounds like my cue to check his paperwork and see if that's in order. Your cue, as well.",
        "Will: So, how are you holding up?",
        "Casey: I can't really tell. I feel kind of numb.",
        "Gwen: Where's Maddie?",
        "Casey: I don't think she wants to be here. And I really don't blame her, after last night.",
        "Gwen: Why? What happened last night?",
        "Casey: I messed up. And now I may never see her again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Hi. Can I have one mimosa, please?",
        "Bartender: Coming right up.",
        "Vienna: Thank you. Oh, Madeline! So good to see you!",
        "Maddie: Hi, good to see you, too.",
        "Vienna: Hey, why so glum, Darling?",
        "Maddie: Oh -- no, I'm fine. I'm just enjoying my morning ritual. You know, some people have coffee --",
        "Vienna: And you and Henry prefer herbal teas.",
        "Maddie: Right.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you two are so similar. It's almost like you were brother and sister.",
        "[Maddie laughs]",
        "Maddie: Yeah, whenever Henry was upset, I used to always find tea bags laying around. And he said it used to calm him, and I used to tease him about it, but now I -- it kind of calms me, too, so --",
        "Vienna: Right. What's wrong? Is it Casey?",
        "Maddie: He's going away today.",
        "Vienna: Oh, no. I'm so sorry.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, I've been dreading it for so long. And now that it's happening, I really need somebody that I can talk to that knows me, that can make me laugh, and make me tea -- and you know, just make sense of everything.",
        "Vienna: And that's Henry.",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: We all need Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Damn, that's all I got left?",
        "Emily: That's all you have left of what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: I guess it wouldn't do any good to remind you that we're not supposed to be seen together?",
        "Paul: No, I missed you.",
        "Meg: I missed you, too. But Paul, if we're really seen together, then it would defeat the whole purpose --",
        "Paul: Yeah, I made sure that everybody was gone.",
        "Meg: How do you know? Somebody could still be outside.",
        "Paul: Like who? Craig?",
        "Meg: I told you the truth, Paul. I had no idea he was going to follow me here. But now that I know he has --",
        "Paul: Now that he has, I'm here to protect you.",
        "Meg: You know, you and Holden make quite a team. You need to trust me more. I know what I'm doing.",
        "Paul: Okay, then, why don't you remind me? What are you doing?",
        "Meg: I am regaining Craig's trust, just like we planned.",
        "Paul: By any means necessary?",
        "Meg: This is about him kissing me, isn't it? You heard Holden freaking out, so now you're freaking out, too.",
        "Paul: Can you blame me?",
        "Meg: Okay, look, I don't expect you to like it. And -- you've got to know that I don't like this, either. It was just a kiss, Paul, okay? One kiss. It's never going to be anything more. Because as soon as I get Craig to trust me, then we can finally nail him. Look, I've got to see this through. You've got to understand. You're acting like I'm trying to hurt you with Craig.",
        "Paul: No, Meg, you're the one that's going to hurt. Craig has a lot to lose, and I'd hate to see what he would do to try and keep everything. Look, I know what we planned, but I don't care. You're out of this, now.",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Paul: Yes.",
        "Meg: I've spent too much time and laid too much groundwork to walk out on this right now. And I already have a big brother second-guessing me. I really don't need another one.",
        "Paul: Tell me, you know, how do I get Holden's words out of my head? How do I get the picture of Craig's hands all over you out of my head? And I know that you said that it won't go any further, but that's a problem, too, because Craig's not the kind of guy that likes to hear the word \"No.\"",
        "Meg: Well, he'll have to, won't he? Or he'll lose me forever. Look, the whole time I was with Craig, I was thinking about us. And the same thought kept going through my head -- that this is working.",
        "Paul: Yeah, a little too well.",
        "Meg: Who said that justice was supposed to be easy, huh?",
        "Paul: I just think that there's a better way. I know that there's a better way.",
        "Meg: Okay, let's hear it.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to tell you -- yet. Got to keep your hands clean, in case Craig wises up.",
        "Meg: So, what? I'm supposed to bow out and sit nice and tight, not even ask why? Oh, well, you know, I'm sorry, but I think you need to fill me in on everything, right now, or I move on as planned.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: That's all you have left of what?",
        "Alison: Emily --",
        "[Alison sneezes]",
        "Emily: Bless you.",
        "Alison: Sorry, you caught me in the middle of an allergy attack.",
        "Emily: Since when do you have allergies?",
        "Alison: Oh, they started in Seattle, I guess because of all the rain. And I went to the doctor, and he gave me stuff that totally didn't help. And then I went to Vegas, and boom -- nothing. No sneezing, no more stuffy head -- 'cause, you know, it's really dry out there.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, maybe that's because Las Vegas is in the middle of the desert.",
        "Alison: Yeah, right, the desert. So -- and then I got back here, and the rain, and the flowers and the grass --",
        "Emily: Yeah, I get it. I get the picture.",
        "Alison: So, what are you doing here? Breakfast at Al's?",
        "Emily: Maybe. I actually just wanted to stop by and say thank you for doing such a great job on Mom's house. I honestly don't think I've ever seen it so clean in my entire life. And all before your morning shift. Where do you get all the energy?",
        "Alison: Oh, who knows? High on life, I guess. And besides, you and Mom have done so much for me. I mean, you got me a job, a place to stay, and most important -- no new chaos.",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah, let's keep it that way. You sure you're okay, Honey? You look -- I don't know, your eyes look a little tired to me.",
        "Alison: Oh, they're just red from the sneezing. I'm not tired at all.",
        "Emily: No, you're not. You're peppy, I'd say.",
        "Alison: Well, I was just on my break, and it was so nice out that I decided to take a walk. Don't you just feel good some times, when it's nice out and everybody's in a better mood?",
        "Emily: Yeah, of course I do -- I do. Aly, come on. I had to practically drag you back to Oakdale, and ever since you've been here, you've given me a ton of grief about how you have nothing to do here, and you miss your friends --",
        "Alison: You know what I don't miss?",
        "Emily: What?",
        "Alison: Having zero control over my life. I think -- now that I'm back away from that, I can actually see how I thought of myself as this movie star. But everyone else was making the decisions, not me.",
        "Emily: You have no idea how glad I am to hear you say that. So, why don't we do something together, just you and me? I don't know, go get a mani-pedi? My treat?",
        "Alison: Oh, that would be fantastic!",
        "Emily: You are just little miss excitement today, aren't you?",
        "Alison: Oh, my break's over. I've got to run, but I'll see -- what's wrong?",
        "Emily: You tell me. And let's start with this morning. And then you can finish up with where all this sudden excitement is coming from.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I really need Henry. He'd know what to do.",
        "Vienna: I don't think anyone can keep your boyfriend from going to jail.",
        "Maddie: No, I know that. It's just -- about me. I got accepted to Wesleyan. It's my dream school.",
        "Vienna: Oh, the university, of course. Forgive my ignorance. I don't know much about American colleges. But that's amazing. Congratulations. It must be an amazing opportunity.",
        "Maddie: For someone else.",
        "Vienna: But you just said it was your dream?",
        "Maddie: I know, it is. But the problem is, it's in Connecticut. And I don't know if you know where that is, but it's really far away.",
        "Vienna: And that troubles you?",
        "Maddie: I don't want to be far away from Casey when he's locked up. I feel like if I accept Wesleyan, I'm just giving up on us and our future together.",
        "Vienna: And what does he think about it?",
        "Maddie: That's the thing. He wants me to go. He wants me to accept the admission, and it's -- it's like he just wants me gone forever.",
        "Vienna: Oh, don't say that, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Why not? It's true. I mean, why -- why doesn't he want me anymore, Vienna? Why can he not see that we need each other?",
        "Vienna: Because he's in love. And when a man is that vulnerable, he's not going to admit that he needs anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I totally blew it.",
        "Gwen: Why? What did you say to Maddie?",
        "Casey: Something about me not letting my stupid mistakes keep her from going away to school.",
        "Will: And you're right.",
        "Casey: Yeah, but now she thinks I want her gone.",
        "Gwen: No, she doesn't think that. She knows how much you love her.",
        "Casey: Does she? I mean, 'cause I don't know anymore. I can't keep hurting the people I love, you know? I think that I just need to think about what's best for Maddie, even if it means that we can't see each other as often as I planned.",
        "Gwen: I honestly think that you did the right thing.",
        "Will: Casey, you can't leave, Man.",
        "Casey: Whoa, just -- all right, watch me, okay?",
        "Will: What about your parents?",
        "Casey: What about Maddie? I can't just leave and not say good-bye to the girl I'm in love with, all right? And neither could you.",
        "Will: Casey! Casey, wait! You're not doing this to yourself, man.",
        "Casey: Just get off me, all right? I have to find her!",
        "Will: Your parents really put themselves on the line to get you more time and freedom. You want to make them regret it?",
        "Casey: What about Maddie, though? I'm not gonna leave things like this!",
        "Will: Just forget about Maddie, all right? They're really trusting you right now. Don't cause them more pain.",
        "Casey: Okay, fine, you're right. You're right.",
        "Will: So, Gwen and I will take care of Maddie for a while.",
        "Gwen: Will, do you mind if I talk to Casey out here for a little bit?",
        "Will: Yeah. I'll go see how Tom and Margo are doing.",
        "Gwen: Hey, I'm really sorry -- for everything. I can't actually believe that this is happening.",
        "Casey: Yeah, me, neither. But you have nothing to be sorry for. This is all on me.",
        "Gwen: That's not true.",
        "Casey: Yeah, it is.",
        "Gwen: No, we all made mistakes, and you're the only one who's being punished. It's not fair.",
        "Casey: I stole those bonds, all right? And I lied about gambling. I think we both know that lying is a bad habit of mine. I put you through hell, and I haven't forgotten that.",
        "Gwen: We don't -- we don't have to talk about that.",
        "Casey: Yeah, no -- yeah, we do. 'Cause, I mean, who knows if I'm going to get another chance to do it.",
        "Gwen: Well --",
        "Casey: I'm sorry that I lied to you about our baby. I know that hurts you more than I can ever make up for.",
        "Gwen: Really, we don't have to do this.",
        "Casey: Yeah -- you know, I guess it's true what they say -- lies catch up to you sooner or later.",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Casey: I'm a total downer. All right, let's, like -- let's go inside, and then you and Will can go.",
        "Tom: I'm sorry to say this, Guys, but it's time to go.",
        "Will: Take care of yourself, all right?",
        "Gwen: Hey, you're not alone. Remember that, okay? Everyone loves you. We'll all be waiting. Even Maddie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Calm down, Emily. There's nothing to worry about, thanks to you.",
        "Emily: Why am I having a hard time believing that?",
        "Alison: I don't know. Maybe you're just used to playing Mommy around me. Old habits die hard, I guess. But I've really got to go, okay?",
        "Emily: Hi, Lucinda. I just wanted to say how sorry I am for everything that happened at Worldwide.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, well, thank you. Thank you, Emily.",
        "Emily: Well, I won't keep you, I just wanted you to know how much I appreciate everything you did for me with \"The Intruder.\" Well, know that you have my sympathy.",
        "Lucinda: How have I done without that all these years, I ask myself.",
        "Emily: Right.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, is that -- is that Alison? Is that -- waitress, come here. My heavens.",
        "Alison: Hi, Ms. Walsh.",
        "Lucinda: Look at what a lovely young lady. You always had the potential, but my heavens, before, you didn't have the discipline.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Alison: Hi. Ms. Walsh, nice to see you.",
        "Emily: Sorry. Oh, that's work. One minute. I'll let the two of you catch up.",
        "Alison: So, do you want me to order you something, or --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Wait a moment. Yes, I do. A vanilla milkshake. Can you handle that?",
        "Alison: I'll check with the kitchen and see what we can do. Oh, by the way, I was really sorry to hear about Lucy. I'm sure you miss her.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I do. I miss her very much. You probably miss her, too. I mean, the two of you were thick as thieves, once upon a time.",
        "Alison: Yeah, and then she went to college and med school.",
        "Lucinda: And you --",
        "Alison: I didn't. I'm going to go put your order in.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, forget about the milkshake. It's medicinal, anyway. Come on. Oh, I want to catch up, I really -- well, come on, sit down. Sit down -- sit with me, and let's have a nice chat.",
        "Alison: Sorry, I can't sit with the customers. I have to go back --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, but, wait a moment. I'm not just any customer. I'm Mrs. Walsh. I've very special. Now, what have you been doing since you got back?",
        "Alison: This. You impressed yet?",
        "Lucinda: There's nothing to be ashamed of. Good heavens, there's always merit in honorable work. Oh, looking at you, I think I got a proposal that will be absolutely suited to you, if you're interested.",
        "Alison: What proposal?",
        "Lucinda: Well, let me just think of it as an investment in your future or as a helping hand to you, you know.",
        "Alison: In return for what? Lucinda:Um, all I ask is complete discretion. That's all.",
        "Alison: Weird. You're the second person that I've talked to lately who's been all about discretion.",
        "Lucinda: Really? What a coincidence. Who is the other one?",
        "Alison: Paul Ryan.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, my heavens that is a coincidence. He and I are working on a little project together.",
        "Alison: Gosh. Isn't that a coincidence?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. Oh, but what a lucky one for you, Darling. You look like a young lady who's been be just waiting for her luck to change. Am I right? Now's the chance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Do you love me?",
        "Meg: You know I do.",
        "Paul: Then trust me. Something unexpected has come up, all right? It just fell into our lap and I think we can use it for our advantage. As soon as I figure out all the details, I'll tell you everything.",
        "Meg: Have it your way.",
        "Paul: Wait, wait, wait! Meg, wait! It's Alison Stewart. She's back in town.",
        "Meg: Emily's little sister?",
        "Paul: Well, yeah, she's all grown up now. And when I was talking to her, it hit me. I mean, something about the way that she sounds -- she sounds like somebody from Craig's past. Someone that I'm sure Craig had hoped he'd never have to deal with again.",
        "Meg: Who?",
        "Paul: Rosanna.",
        "Meg: You're kidding?",
        "Paul: No, I'm serious. We can use Alison's voice to trick Craig into thinking Rosanna is out of the coma. That Rosanna's out to get him. And now, with Lucinda on board, I'm positive --",
        "Meg: Whoa, whoa, wait. Lucinda's on board?",
        "Paul: Yeah, it took some doing. But it's good because Lucinda's the only one who knows that now with Lucy out of town --",
        "Meg: Rosanna's the only one in the world who could put Craig behind bars.",
        "Paul: Right. So, we use Alison's voice to spook Craig into thinking that Rosanna wants him to make him pay. To pay for running her off the road -- for causing the accident. He'll be so crazy with grief and guilt. He'll have no choice but to confess.",
        "Meg: So, Rosanna gets justice. Craig gets life behind bars. And Lucinda gets Worldwide back.",
        "Paul: Exactly. That's a lot of birds to kill with one, tiny little stone.",
        "Meg: You know, it's an interesting plan. Except that you refuse to let me have anything to do with it.",
        "Paul: Well, that's because you don't really have to have anything to do with it.",
        "Meg: Really? You know, if it works, and Craig is tortured by guilt as much you want him to be, who does he come to? Who does he confide in? Me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Here you go. That's all they let you take. Look, Baby, I know that six months seems like an eternity, but it isn't. This will be over. So, if things get tough, you just remember that.",
        "Casey: I will. And thank you guys both for getting my sentences as short as you could.",
        "Margo: Oh, I wish this wasn't happening.",
        "Casey: All right, Mom, don't do that, okay? Because you guys did everything you could. And I mean, this is my problem. This is my responsibility.",
        "Tom: Well, we're your parents, Casey. We're in this with you.",
        "Casey: I know, but don't spend any time wondering if you should've done things differently, okay? You guys are the best parents ever. You gave me the courage to grow up and now I've got 180 days to finally do it. Dad, could you -- could you hold onto this for me?",
        "Tom: Your great-grandfather's watch.",
        "Casey: Maybe when I get out, I'll earn the right to wear it again. I want to be the type of man that Chris Hughes would be proud of.",
        "Margo: Well, when did you get so brave? I'm sorry. I swore I wasn't going to do this. But I'm going to do it. I love you.",
        "Casey: I love you, too, Mom.",
        "Tom: Is there anything else? Anything you need before --",
        "Casey: Well, there's one more thing, but I don't think she's going to show up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: All I wanted was for Casey to read my acceptance letter, say congratulations, and then beg me not to go. How confusing is that?",
        "Vienna: Well, it sounds to me that Casey was thinking of you. And trying to love you the best way he could.",
        "Maddie: By sending me away? What kind of love is that?",
        "Vienna: The unselfish kind. You know, it's a shock when men tries to do the right thing, isn't it?",
        "Maddie: Yeah. I guess, love is hard.",
        "Vienna: So, make it easier. You know, you're a smart girl, Madeline. And smart girls should do things that make them even smarter.",
        "Maddie: What do you mean?",
        "Vienna: Enroll at the university. You know, Casey, he knew that this was your dream and he wanted you to go. And that says to me, that he really loves you.",
        "Maddie: But what if he stops loving me because I can't visit him anymore? What if the day he gets out, I have finals or something, and I can't see him?",
        "Vienna: Well, then he'll come to you. You should go and make yourself a better woman for him.",
        "Maddie: I never really thought about it that way. And you really think that he's going to come out and see me?",
        "Vienna: Well, now, in my book, the man should always follow the woman. And maybe by the time he gets released, you might still be available.",
        "Maddie: Well, of course, I'm going to be available.",
        "Vienna: Or maybe not. Who knows? Maybe you'll fall in love with a Connecticut boy who hasn't been behind the bars?",
        "Maddie: No, no, no. No way. I will never love anyone as much as I love Casey.",
        "Vienna: Okay, and that's all wonderful. But you shouldn't give up your dream for a man, my darling. You know, your dreams make you who are, the girl Casey loves.",
        "Henry: Oops, sorry. Looks like I stumbled on a meeting of Oakdale's greatest minds. What's this about Wesleyan's latest superstar, huh? Congratulations, kid.",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "Henry: You okay?",
        "Maddie: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Well, I should be going, too.",
        "Henry: Five minutes?",
        "Vienna: For what?",
        "Henry: Just to thank you for what you said to Maddie.",
        "Vienna: You were listening? That was a private conversation.",
        "Henry: I know. I know. I'll admit to being rude, if you admit to being wonderful. Is it a deal?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I'm exhausted.",
        "Will: Yeah, me too. Imagine how Casey feels right now. I mean, he's putting up a good front, but you know deep down, he's scared out of his mind.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, he's probably terrified. Of course, he didn't talk about that. He just started apologizing for all these things that happened in the past.",
        "Will: Yeah, like what?",
        "Gwen: That he deserves everything. That this is just all payback, what's happening now. And not just for stealing the bonds, but when I was pregnant, and how he never came around and he didn't helped out.",
        "Will: So, he thinks he's going to jail for that, too?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, in a way. That because he wasn't punished for it then, it's happening now.",
        "Will: Do you believe that?",
        "Gwen: Do I believe that things, that bad things eventually catch up with you? Yeah, and Casey and I are the same. You know, we both made horrible mistakes.",
        "Will: Gwen, stop doing this to yourself. You're not Casey. He knew exactly what he was doing when he stole those bonds. He planned it out.",
        "Gwen: What I did to Adam, was that planned? No. But afterwards, I didn't say anything. I should have gone to the cops. But instead, I kept this really horrible secret. And what if Casey is right? What if that is the way that the universe works? And what if it is really just a matter of time before I'm punished too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Craig kissed me because he was testing my boundaries, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah. So, what happens when he gets to the next boundary? What if Craig tries to hurt you?",
        "Meg: He won't. Physical violence isn't his thing.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you're right. He prefers a different kind of stab in the back.",
        "Meg: Exactly. And that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to pretend to be his friend. The person he confides in when Rosanna suddenly appears into his life. I'll sympathize, but everything I say will be designed to make his paranoia worse. Pretty soon, he'll be a basket case.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Right where he want him.",
        "Paul: Unless he figures out that you're a part of the plan. I can't let you do this.",
        "Meg: Well, you have no choice. Working together, Lucinda, you, and I, we have a chance. Apart, the only winner is Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So, you and Paul have made this deal? And what part of it do you need me for?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, you have an unique talent that we can't find elsewhere.",
        "Alison: That sounds shady.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. Absolutely legitimate. All right. I'm off.",
        "Alison: What is this?",
        "Lucinda: Um, that's all you need to know for now. Your cab fare is covered. Just prove your worth, Darling. Turn up at the address on time.",
        "Emily: Wow, you must be some kind of waitress?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Emily: What did Lucinda want?",
        "Alison: Oh, you know, just to talk about Lucy and old times. I think seeing me reminds her of when Lucy was happy.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure. So, is your shift over? Can you go? Can you go with me and beautify?",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah. About that -- I really --",
        "Emily: Alison, come on. It wasn't easy getting a last-minute appointment for the two of us.",
        "Alison: So, we'll go tomorrow.",
        "Emily: You don't need to go tomorrow. You need to go today. You've been on your feet all morning, you need a little T.L.C. what's wrong with today?",
        "Alison: Nothing. I'm just tired.",
        "Emily: What do you mean, you're tired? A minute ago, you were little miss excitement.",
        "Alison: And now, I'm not. I can't go with you, okay?",
        "Emily: Why can't you go with me, Ali? What's wrong?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I'm just not in a really good place right now.",
        "Emily: Are you okay? You feeling okay?",
        "Alison: Not exactly. I'm sorry to mess up our plans, but I think I -- I think that I need to go to a meeting.",
        "Emily: Oh, of course. Okay, if that's what you need to do, do you want some company?",
        "Alison: You mean to my meeting?",
        "Emily: Yeah I mean, would it help if I came along with you?",
        "Alison: Maybe you forgot, but the name of the group has this word in it, anonymous? When there's outsiders there, people feel like they're being watched over their shoulders.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I got it, I got it. Sorry, I get it.",
        "Alison: Well, thanks for being understanding.",
        "Emily: Sure.",
        "Alison: Bye.",
        "Emily: Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So what's it going to be? Am I in?",
        "Paul: No. Okay, yes. You are an expert in the art of persuasion.",
        "Meg: You like it?",
        "Paul: I'm helpless in the face of your blinding logic. All I can do is concede defeat.",
        "Meg: Good.",
        "[Phone ringing]",
        "Paul: I'm not getting that. Lucinda, everything okay?",
        "Lucinda: Everything's fine, thanks to me. And I'll be brief. I know you want to get going as soon as possible.",
        "Paul: So everything went well?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, meet me as planned.",
        "Meg: Well, don't you look happy.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well Lucinda is very much on board.",
        "Meg: Word to the wise? She's not a very patient woman. She wants results yesterday.",
        "Paul: Well, then she'll have them. Do me a favor. Promise me that you'll let me know the next time Craig comes around.",
        "Meg: I promise. But you have to promise, too.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Meg: Promise that you'll trust me to keep Craig at bay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What you said to Maddie about going to college, that was amazing.",
        "Vienna: I'm very fond of your sister, Henry. And when we were planning our wedding, I started to look at her as my sister too, and now I can't stop.",
        "Henry: For her sake, I'm glad.",
        "Vienna: Well, I think we all have a responsibility to take care of the ones we love. Now, if you'll excuse me. I think my job is done here.",
        "Henry: Vienna, Vienna, wait!",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Henry: How can I ever thank you enough?",
        "Vienna: You just did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Gwen, you can't keep living your life like this.",
        "Gwen: What? Accepting responsibility for my actions?",
        "Will: No, there's a difference between accepting things and constantly reliving them.",
        "Gwen: But this is my life. I mean, these are my choices. I can't treat them like they're nothing.",
        "Will: So, you don't have to, but looking over your shoulder every five minutes isn't going to fix anything. If you keep waiting for the worst case scenario that's never going to happen, then you're not going to be living in the present.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Will: So, if you want to do something constructive, then think about counting some blessings, you know? Think about how lucky we are to have each other.",
        "Gwen: And our freedom.",
        "Will: Yeah, which is why we can't be living in the past, you know, we have so much to look forward to. Let's focus on that.",
        "Gwen: Okay, that sounds good to me.",
        "Will: Yeah, how good? Want to start thinking about finishing the demo?",
        "Gwen: Actually, I'm not ready for that one, yet.",
        "Will: Why not?",
        "Gwen: You just said that I can't live in the past. And when I think about recording, you know, I think about Adam. They're completely combined and that's the one person I'm trying to let go of.",
        "Will: The demo is one thing, but performing live? That's something totally different. You were doing that before Adam ever came along. And I know your fans would love to hear you sing.",
        "Gwen: You mean like the fan that you found in our house, wearing my clothes. I think that's the kind of fan that I could avoid.",
        "Will: Yeah, well, at least she has good taste, right? I'm gonna be late, I have class, so we'll talk more about this later.",
        "Gwen: All right.",
        "Will: You gonna be okay alone?",
        "Gwen: Of course I will. I'm gonna focus on staying in the present.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Look, your mom and I have done our best to try and set you up with a little job on the inside.",
        "Casey: Dad, you've done enough.",
        "Tom: No, it'll help you pass the time and add some structure to your day. I mean, it's not much, but at least it's something.",
        "Casey: Thanks. Guess this is it, huh?",
        "Tom: Yeah.",
        "Casey: It's gonna be okay, Dad.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: So what do you think of Alison's story?",
        "Lucinda: I hate to be the one to admit it, and I mean, I do admit it. I think your plan is going to work.",
        "Paul: You're giving me a key?",
        "Lucinda: The girl, she's a wild card, all right? But the similarity -- the vocal similarity to Rosanna is astounding!",
        "Paul: And this would fit in where?",
        "Lucinda: The front door at Fairwinds, Darling. All right? You may need it.",
        "Alison: You're both here. Creepy.",
        "Lucinda: Alison, Dear, join us! Sit down.",
        "Alison: I can hear you fine from here, thanks. Let's just get to the point.",
        "Lucinda: I can't believe it! She sounds more like her every single minute.",
        "Alison: Sound more like who?",
        "Paul: We understand you're looking for a job?",
        "Alison: Nope. I got one.",
        "Lucinda: Ah, but I made it very clear that the remuneration in this case is going to be far above what you're used to in the greasy spoon as a waitress.",
        "Paul: And all you have to do is make a few phone calls.",
        "Alison: To who? What do you want me to say?",
        "Paul: Well, we'll provide you with a script, nothing complicated, might be kind of fun.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I'll bet. Too bad I'm not your girl.",
        "Lucinda: Um -- Dear.",
        "Paul: Wait, wait, wait.",
        "Lucinda: We're not finished.",
        "Alison: Oh, yes we are. There's no way that this is legit. And I'm not risking any more trouble.",
        "Lucinda: My darling girl, it would be no trouble for anyone if you do exactly as we ask.",
        "Alison: Well, if that's all you're paying, I don't think so.",
        "Lucinda: There will be more. Much more.",
        "Alison: When?",
        "Lucinda: Very soon, child. But of course, everything will depend upon how well the first assignment goes, won't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I didn't think you'd come. I thought you hated me now.",
        "Maddie: Impossible.",
        "Casey: I didn't mean to hurt you.",
        "Maddie: I know. I know and I get it. I get why you wanted me to accept Wesleyan. You didn't want me gone, you just wanted what was best for me.",
        "Casey: Last night was one of the worst nights of my life.",
        "Maddie: Mine too.",
        "Casey: I never want to push you away, Maddie. Not in a million years. You're my girl, and I always want what's best for you, and if that means that I have to give up some time with you, that's fine.",
        "Maddie: I know, and I'll always be your girl no matter how far away I am.",
