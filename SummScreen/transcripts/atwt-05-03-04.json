        "Henry: You ate \r\nall the blue ones. ",
        "Katie: I did \r\nnot. ",
        "Henry: Find me \r\na blue one, Katie. I dare you. You can't because you ate them all. ",
        "Katie: Relax, \r\nHenry, we have more important things to worry about. What are you doing? \r\n",
        "Henry: This \r\nstakeout is officially over. ",
        "Katie: You \r\nstart that car and I swear I will never let you drive again. ",
        "Henry: Fine, \r\nI'll walk home. ",
        "Katie: No, \r\nHenry, please, don't go. I will buy you a lifetime supply of blue ones. I'll \r\npick them out myself and keep them in jar with a padlock on it in the freezer.\r\n",
        "Henry: Good.\r\n",
        "Katie: Please, \r\nI need to prove to Margo and Mike and everyone else that Pilar is up to no good.\r\n",
        "Henry: By \r\nlistening to her drapes? Her pillow cases? The senorita is not home. ",
        "Katie: She'll \r\nbe home soon, I can feel it. And then, because you were so smart and such a good \r\nfriend and planted that bug in her room, we will get a recording of Pilar doing \r\nsomething terrible and then Mike will believe me, and then -- ",
        "Henry: And then \r\nwhat, Katie? You'll get over yourself and tell the man you love him? No. So \r\nwhat's the point? ",
        "Katie: Just \r\nbecause I can't marry the man, doesn't mean I have to let him get killed. \r\n",
        "Henry: Shh!\r\n",
        "Katie: Do you \r\nthink she's home? ",
        "Henry: Well, \r\nunless the maid has a maid service, it's Pilar. ",
        "Pilar: Hey, \r\nMike. It's me. Yeah, I'm done with work. You busy? ",
        "Katie: Please \r\nbe busy, Mike. ",
        "Pilar: I \r\nthought maybe we could hang out. ",
        "Henry: He'd be \r\nup to his eyeballs if a certain blonde -- ",
        "Katie: Shh!\r\n",
        "Pilar: Dinner \r\nwould be great, or a movie, um, whatever -- ",
        "Katie: Dinner \r\nand a movie? That's a date. That's not just hanging out. She can't do that.\r\n",
        "Pilar: So why \r\ndon't you come over here and we'll decide. ",
        "Katie: Say no, \r\nMike! Come on, you're busy. You had a long weekend. You have to pay bills or do \r\nlaundry. ",
        "Pilar: Great. \r\nSee you soon. ",
        "Katie: No!\r\n",
        "Pilar: And \r\nMichael, I'm really looking forward to it. ",
        "Henry: One \r\nphone call, Katie, and he'd forget all about her. ",

        "Jessica: That \r\nbad, huh? ",
        "Margo: Oh yeah, \r\nyou know every once in a while the guys try to get Mom to make the coffee. On \r\nthose days, Mom orders out. Can I get you anything? ",
        "Jessica: Um, \r\nsome herbal tea? No, no, we are not pregnant, but we're trying. ",
        "Margo: All \r\nright. Yeah, hi, Grace, yeah, it's Margo -- yeah, they did it again. You believe \r\nit? Okay, yeah, the usual and can you throw in some extra sugar please? And an \r\nherbal tea. That's great, thanks. So what brings you here? Your favorite client \r\nin trouble again? ",

        "Kim: That's \r\ntrue. ",
        "Doc: That means \r\nI must be doing something right. ",
        "Kim: Actually, \r\nI would have met you at the Lakeview lounge. But then I decided it probably \r\nwasn't so smart for you to show your face there this morning -- having shown \r\nalmost everything there last night. ",
        "",
        "Barbara: Of \r\ncourse I can see. Why would you think such a thing? ",
        "Carly: Because \r\nyou can't see my hand waving in front of your face. ",
        "Barbara: Okay, \r\nokay, you caught me. Not that this is any of your business but when you saw me \r\nat the hospital earlier today I just had a little cosmetic procedure at the \r\nhospital. I mean, I want to look my best for the show tomorrow and it just made \r\nmy vision a little bit blurry. That's why I wanted to work here at home this \r\nafternoon. In fact, I wanna take a nap, Carly, so if you wouldn't mind running \r\noff -- ",
        "Carly: Botox \r\ndoesn't make you blind, Barbara. ",
        "Barbara: I'm \r\nnot blind -- ",
        "Carly: I showed \r\nyou a stick figure, and you told me it was a lovely design. That's not blurry, \r\nBarbara, that's legally blind. And if you think you -- oh my God, well that's \r\nwhy you wanted me to work at B.R.O., because you couldn't finish the collection.\r\n",
        "Barbara: I just \r\nneeded your help, that's all -- ",
        "Carly: But you \r\ndidn't tell me why. And all this time I figured you had some sudden change of \r\nheart. ",
        "Barbara: Carly, \r\ndon't -- ",
        "Carly: But you \r\ncan't see to work. That's why you needed to hire me. That's why you kept making \r\nup excuses why you couldn't look at my designs. That's why you handed everything \r\noff to Jordan and to Jennifer! Because you can't see! ",
        "Barbara: Okay, \r\nokay, it's true. I can't see. ",
        "",
        "Paul: Jordan \r\nSinclair had trouble sharing in kindergarten. This has got everything in it \r\nexcept his baby teeth. How long does it take to get something like this \r\ntogether? It must have took -- months. Long before Rosanna came back to Oakdale \r\nand met Jordan for the first time. ",
        "Paul: How long \r\nhave you had your eye on Jordan Sinclair? ",
        "Rosanna: Ever \r\nsince he came to Oakdale. ",
        "Paul: I knew \r\nit. Well, she's been lying through her teeth to you Jordie-boy. You and me both.\r\n",
        "",
        "Rosanna: You \r\nmean you've changed your mind? That you wanna spend some time with me after all?\r\n",
        "Jordan: \r\nRosanna, you are a beautiful, fascinating woman, but the timing -- the show is \r\ntomorrow. ",
        "Rosanna: Well, \r\nof course. You need to devote yourself completely to your work. I would be \r\ndisappointed in you if you didn\u2019t. After all, it's my sister's designs up there \r\non the runway that you are representing, and I'm counting on you to look after \r\nher. Speaking of which, someone has to be there to represent Cabot Motors. After \r\nall, we're backing the show. And Carly has asked me to be that someone, so what \r\nif I came to Las Vegas? I mean, wouldn't it be great, after you got all your \r\nwork done we could spend a little time together after the show. If you're still \r\ninterested. ",

        "Pilar: Hey, \r\nMike. ",
        "Mike: You still \r\na Chablis girl? I figured since the Wagon Wheel isn't exactly a mini-bar kind of \r\nplace -- ",
        "Pilar: That is \r\nso sweet. I'd love a glass of wine. But then you always could read my mind.\r\n",
        "Katie: Gag me \r\nwith a corkscrew. ",
        "Henry: Ouch.\r\n",
        "Mike: You got \r\nsome glasses in the bathroom? ",
        "Pilar: You \r\nstay. I'll get them. ",
        "Katie: How can \r\nhe not see through her? She's such a phony. ",
        "Henry: Oh, I \r\nhate to break it to you, bubbles, but men line up for that kind of phony. \r\n",
        "Katie: If you \r\ncan't say anything encouraging, don't say anything at all. [Henry sighs] What \r\nare they doing? What are they doing, Henry? We should have put the camera in \r\nthere. ",
        "Henry: Paris \r\nHilton, here we come. ",
        "Katie: I'm not \r\ntalking about that and you know it. Russell Terry said that Pilar wanted to kill \r\nMike. She ran up to me and said pretty much the same thing. Who's going to \r\nprotect him if we don't? ",
        "Pilar: Have you \r\nheard from Katie? ",
        "Mike: She's \r\nkeeping her distance. ",
        "Pilar: You okay \r\nwith that? ",

        "Carly: Brain \r\ntumor? ",
        "Barbara: Which \r\npresses on my optical nerve and sometimes causes my vision to go blurry. And \r\nthings get very dark for a while, sometimes a little longer. ",
        "Carly: You're \r\ngetting treated, right? ",
        "Barbara: I just \r\nstarted radiation, and we're hoping we can avoid surgery, but the doctors aren't \r\nreally sure yet. ",
        "Carly: Well, \r\nyou'll recover. They'll get rid of the tumor and you'll be fine, you'll be able \r\nto see again. Barbara -- ? ",
        "Barbara: My \r\nfocus right now is the show, which is tomorrow in Vegas. I just have to get \r\nthrough tomorrow, which means I'll need your help getting through today. \r\n",
        "Carly: Yeah, of \r\ncourse. I am so sorry. Does it hurt? Are you in any pain? ",
        "Barbara: I get \r\nheadaches. ",

        "Carly: No, no, \r\nof course I won\u2019t. ",
        "Barbara: Jordan \r\nknows, too. He found out just like you did, accidentally, which is, I guess, \r\ninevitable 'cause we all work together. But that's it. Beside the two of you, \r\nonly my doctors know what's going on. ",
        "Carly: And your \r\nfamily -- ? ",
        "Barbara: I \r\nhaven't spoken to them. ",
        "Carly: What do \r\nyou mean? ",
        "Barbara: I \r\ndon't want them upset them when there's so much at stake with the company right \r\nnow. So I'll talk to them after the show, after I've conferred with my doctors.\r\n",
        "Carly: You mean \r\nJennifer and Paul have no idea what you're going though? ",
        "Barbara: No, \r\nthey don\u2019t. And you have to respect my privacy, Carly, both personally and \r\nprofessionally. ",
        "Carly: Barbara, \r\nyou have a brain tumor. That could be very, very bad. ",
