        "Will and Gwen talk about Crash; Will asks if she and Casey have plans to scout out new talent, after recalling his conversation with Barbara. Gwen tells him no, which seems to bother him. When Casey isn't sure that he'll be able to get Gwen to go on the trip to Chicago, Barbara pretty much rescinds her offer unless Gwen goes, claiming this was all about helping her daughter-in-law. Casey promises he will do everything in his power to get her to go. Carly comes to the station to pick up a sick Parker, but Jack sarcastically asks if she is there to meet Nick? When he sees Parker he apologizes; he can't help but still get jealous. Carly tells him it is a good thing because she knows how he feels; she is not going to get over him and she doesn't want Nick because she only wants him, and sooner or later he needs to stop denying his feelings. Emily comes to and sees Paul and assumes everything was a terrible dream, but when Susan tells her the neurologist will be in to see her and then she sees Meg outside, she realizes it is not a dream and cries out asking why they didn't let her die? The church is only available that night for Mike and Katie to get married, so they decide tonight is the night, as they start to make plans. Jade comes to see Lily after doing some laundry and she and Luke fight, which Lily partly overhears. Jade can't help but guilt Lily into having her around, by saying that she and Luke were fighting about her and the fact she doesn't want him happy with her. Casey meets up with Gwen and finally convinces her to come to Chicago with him for the day. Paul convinces Tom, strangely enough, to have Daniel come see his mom to give Emily something to live for. Emily finds out Paul saved her. She asks him why he did it \u0096 out of guilt? He just wants her to live and be happy because he cares for her still. She doesn't know what that means and shocks him when she asks if he will be there for her and will they be together after this? Mike and Katie go to Carly's to invite her to the wedding and in the end, Carly offers Katie a wedding dress she had before at BRO. Mike gets called to the station for questioning after tests came back on the skeleton, but he doesn't tell Katie. It seems the skeleton might be the woman who gave Mike the rubies. Jack shows him some evidence and Mike seems to recognize one of the items. Jade and Luke have another face off at Java and after she leaves, Will tries to talk to Luke, who is adamant that Jade is not his girlfriend. Gwen keeps trying to reach Will but he is occupied with Luke and does not hear his phone."

        "Gwen: Have you seen my calculator, I have study group in 15 minutes I thought I put it --",
        "Will: You don't need a calculator where you're headed. You're the real thing, I saw the crowd last night they couldn't get enough of you.",
        "Gwen: That's because I was the only thing that wasn't pre-recorded. But thank you for being my number-one fan, thank you. And as much as I'd like to keep this going, you have to study. Harris is famous for giving impossible final exams.",
        "Will: So stay and quiz me.",
        "Gwen: What's going on with you?",
        "Will: Nothing. I just miss you when you're gone.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, we kind of had a good time last night.",
        "Will: You kind of had a good time last night.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you were gonna tell me something about your mom. What'd she try to pull this time?",

        "Announcer: The role of Casey Hughes is being played today by Scott Porter.",
        "Barbara: So the only problem is that these passes are good today and today only starting at noon. And since the best bands perform first --",
        "Casey: No, today is great. I just wasn't sure if you'd, you know, come through.",
        "Barbara: Can you come through, that's the question. You said that you can get Gwen to go with you.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Barbara: So, where is she? I mean, you two need to get a move on if you're gonna make the opening act.",
        "Casey: I haven't had a chance to go over the details with her yet. But if she's not free, I can still talk to my parents and see if they'll let me cover the bands by myself. I know it's a long shot, but I can at least try, right.",
        "Barbara: Ah, no, Casey. That wasn't our agreement.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Jade: The girls left these at my place yesterday when they changed to go to the fair. So, I washed them so Lily wouldn't have to.",
        "Luke: Wait, wait, wait where are you going?",
        "Jade: Upstairs to put them away.",
        "Luke: No, leave them. I'll put them away. You're not supposed to be here.",
        "Jade: What am I doing? I'm dropping off some clothes.",
        "Luke: Jade, my mom just got out of the hospital. Have a little bit of respect, okay?",
        "Jade: Well, why do you think I did this? I'm trying to help.",
        "Luke: You want to help? Well then get out of here!",

        "Katie: And remember we said we were going to get married in May?",
        "Mike: Yeah, we have the whole month.",
        "Katie: No, we don't. I just talked to the secretary at the church. And they are booked solid -- weddings, christenings, memorials, because of Memorial Day. The only date they have is tonight.",
        "Mike: Tonight? Okay, when we told Margo it's going to be soon, I don't think she thought it was going to be this soon.",
        "Katie: I know, me neither. But remember you -- a couple weeks ago, you said you wanted to elope. And then last night you seemed pretty happy about moving up the date, so -- I mean, unless you don't want to.",
        "Mike: Katie --",
        "Katie: Which I would understand if you don't want to, because it's such short notice. It's no notice, its tonight. Which means it's today, which means we have a lot to do. But you know what? If we let this skeleton thing get in the way of our happiness -- is that a yes?",

        "Jack: You take a look?",
        "Cop #3: I skimmed it. There's a lot there, but it's not the whole story.",
        "Jack: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Jack, I didn't know you'd be here so early.",
        "Jack: Why? You looking for Nick?",
        "Carly: Right, yeah. Last night was so special, I thought I'd come down and chase him around the squad room.",
        "Hal: See, here's your mom. Thanks for coming so fast, Carly. The champ here whoopsed his cookies. He's a little under the weather.",
        "Parker: I threw up.",

You gotta open your eyes, huh? And if you want to yell and scream at me -- throw things. It'd be okay, you know, I deserve that. Please, wake up. I'm right here. Em? Hey.",

        "Susan: Emily --",

        "Dr. Linn: I've got her.",
        "Susan: Okay. Get rest!",
        "Paul: She's awake. Looks like she's gonna make it.",
        "Susan: Weren't you listening? She wants to die.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, that's because she didn't remember everything when she woke up, and then she did -- look, I had doubts about being at Emily's bedside when she -- when she woke up, but you're the one who said that it might help.",
        "Susan: I -- I know what I said.",
        "Paul: We both knew that she was gonna be hurt and angry. Look, she has every right to be. But the important thing is that she survived the fall, she's in good hands, she's gonna -- she's gonna be fine.",
        "Susan: And then what? What's gonna happen to her when she's finally able to get out of bed? She's going to jail. Her life is over!",
        "Meg: Well, that's not Paul's fault.",
        "Susan: The hell it isn't. She was a vibrant, healthy, happy woman before she met you. And now look at her!",
        "Meg: She's a mom, she feels helpless. She has to blame someone.",
        "Paul: She has a point.",
        "Meg: Before Emily hooked up with you, where was she? She was married to Hal and very unhappy. She glommed onto you because she knew she was about to go under.",
        "Paul: But I didn't save her.",
        "Meg: Okay, so you'll never be a St. Bernard. But you could use a haircut.",
        "Paul: This from my little lhasa apso, huh?",
        "Meg: Yeah, that would be me. Thanks.",
        "Paul: You were here all night?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I still have a friend or two on staff. They let me crash in the nurses' lounge.",
        "Paul: You should go home.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well, sorry but I've got this man that needs a little TLC.",
        "Paul: Tom --",
        "Tom: We have nothing to say to each other.",
        "Paul: I'm sure you're right, but Emily's doing a little better. I'm a little worried about her.",
        "Tom: Really? Well, it's about time.",
        "Paul: Okay, look, she's out of the coma, but she's not doing so well emotionally. In fact, she was -- she was saying that -- she wishes that we had let her die.",
        "Tom: And that surprises you?",
        "Paul: I just think that it would be great if she could see Daniel.",
        "Tom: You want me to bring my son to visit his mother in the hospital while she's hooked up to all these machines and there's a policeman standing outside?",
        "Paul: Well, you are the D.A., Tom, you could dismiss the cop and you could prepare Daniel for a visit.",
        "Tom: He's already having nightmares. He hasn't seen his mother in weeks.",
        "Paul: Which is why I thought it would be a good idea for them to both see each other.",
        "Tom: Oh, so now you know what's best for Emily?",
        "Paul: No, I don't. I have no idea. Look, I just -- I know that she loves her son. And I know that Daniel is the one person in her life who has never hurt her. She needs something to live for, Tom. And I think it would be really good for Daniel to know that he was helping his mother. I don't know, it's just -- it's just an idea.",

        "Hal: A couple of days with your mom and you're gonna be good as new.",
        "Parker: Then where do I go?",
        "Hal: Well, I love having you with me, Parker. We sure had fun the last couple of days, didn't we? Well, I want to keep that going, so let's wait until you're all well again. And then we'll do some more, okay? I'm gonna call ya.",
        "Carly: All right. Let's get you home.",
        "Parker: I like it with Dad, but I like it more at our house. When everybody's there.",
        "Jack: I know. I know, buddy. And you and I, we're gonna spend some time together as soon as you start feeling better, okay?",
        "Parker: It's never going to be the way it used to be, is it?",
        "Jack: Afraid not.",
        "Parker: Can I get a soda from the break room?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Ginger ale, okay?",
        "Jack: Look, I'm sorry about earlier -- the Nick thing. I can't help it, I still get jealous.",
        "Carly: Good. You should.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: I'm not sorry, Jack, and I don't want to be. I don't want to get over you or move on or let go. I love you and I want you back - that's just the way it is. So when you feel jealous -- I'm glad. Because it lets me know how you really feel. If you want to be in denial and make yourself miserable, go ahead. But I'm not gonna do that because I'm focusing on what I really want. And just so you know, Nick is not on that list. There's just one name on there.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: So?",
        "Mike: Well, you better practicing your toast. We're getting married tonight.",
        "Katie: Hopefully there will be someone to hear it because it's kind of short notice.",
        "Nick: Yeah, why is that? I thought you were getting married later this month.",
        "Mike: Well, we were. But with this case of Jack's --",
        "Katie: No, it has nothing to do with that. The church was booked solid till the 4th of July and we didn't want to wait.",
        "Mike: So let's get on it. Where's the guest list? I'll start making calls.",
        "Katie: It's upstairs. And I have to order a cake and flowers and food -- help!",
        "Nick: You okay?",
        "Mike: Yeah, I just got a lot on my mind. Where're you going?",
        "Nick: Early wedding present. I'm gonna clear your name.",

        "Lily: What is going on down here? What are you fighting about?",
        "Jade: Nothing. We're not having a fight.",
        "Lily: I know what I heard.",
        "Jade: It's not a fight. It was a disagreement.",
        "Lily: About what?",
        "Luke: Mom, it's really just not important. Why don't you just please go back to bed.",
        "Jade: No, I think she should know. I just stopped by to drop these off. The girls left them and I washed them. And Luke was afraid that seeing me might upset you. I told him that that was ridiculous -- that I was doing you a favor. And that if you got upset -- it was because you didn't want him to be happy.",
        "Lily: That's not true.",
        "Jade: You don't want him seeing me -- you've made that very clear. But even if you don't like me, your son does. And if you think that it's okay to make him feel like he can't love somebody unless you approve, then you're the one with the problem. I'll see you later.",
        "Luke: Mom, I'm -- look, I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: Is that what you think? That I don't want you to be happy? Because that's not true.",
        "Luke: I know.",
        "Lily: Do you know that? Really? Because I don't like her. Jade is right. She hurt me when she pretended to be Rose's daughter. But I will forget about all of that if she makes you happy. But I don't think that she does. I'm still very angry at Jade for getting my hopes up. I just wanted her to be Rose's daughter and when I found out it was a trick, I just --",
        "Luke: Okay, we don't have to go over this again.",
        "Lily: You're right. I just want to understand -- you. See, I don't get a sense of your feelings, at all. Maybe that's what happens when your children grow up. You stop being able to read their minds.",
        "Luke: Maybe that's a good thing.",
        "Lily: She really makes you happy?",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Okay -- okay, then I will try very hard to be nicer to her.",
        "Luke: Mom, you don't have to do that.",

        "Barbara: Then you have a problem.",
        "Casey: Why?",
        "Barbara: Because, darling, Gwen is my daughter-in-law. I'm doing this for her. And for Will. They are newlyweds. She can't be expected to perform every single night. She needs to be home with her husband. Besides that, they're in school.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well I'm still in school.",
        "Barbara: Yeah, but you're not six months behind. So, Gwen needs to go to Chicago with you so you can line up other acts so she can spend some time with her husband.",
        "Casey: They spend all day together every day. And he loves to see her sing.",
        "Barbara: Look, Casey, I encouraged your grandmother to hire Gwen because I thought that she would enjoy the work. And besides that, they need the money. And it's worked out pretty well so far, don't you think?",
        "Casey: Yeah, it's been great.",
        "Barbara: Good. So keep it great. Go to Chicago. You need to find some other acts. I mean you need to make business decisions together. Didn't Lisa hire both of you to be in charge of the music?",
        "Casey: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Barbara: So making this trip is important for my daughter-in-law for many, many reasons. I hope you'll understand that and make every effort to include her.",

        "Will: So, you and Casey have any plans to find some other bands for the club?",
        "Gwen: We talked about it, but we haven't decided anything yet. All right. I've got to go. And you need to ace an exam.",
        "Will: Yeah, but no pressure.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, or a lot. We kind of have to graduate.",

        "Barbara: The acid rain tour. Now, I know it sounds nauseating to me, but they're over the moon about it. And it'll give them a chance to book some really good talent in here. I mean, you do know that Gwen and Casey were going off together, right?",

You'll have a lot more time to study with Will. She just wants you to graduate. Look, its one day. We'll be back tonight. What's the big deal?",

        "Gwen: She said that?",
        "Casey: Yeah. You heard her last night. She was ready to rename the club, \"Gwen's.\" Look, let's just do this. We'll go, book a couple bands, you'll have a lot more time with Will. I'll have a lot more time to spend with Maddie. It's a win-win.",

        "Jade: Yeah, well I'm not the reason why her sister died.",
        "Luke: You know what? It is no surprise to me that you're all alone. Because you have no idea about how to treat other people. And that's what family is about -- other people.",
        "Jade: Really. Because I thought family was the one place where you could be yourself. Where you could tell the truth and still be accepted. You're afraid that your mom won't accept you. Because you don't trust her.",
