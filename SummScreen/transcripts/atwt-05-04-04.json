        "Jessica: I was \r\nlooking for you, and I got worried. I thought maybe you had an emergency at the \r\nclinic or something. ",
        "Ben: Well, \r\nactually, I was picking up a surprise for you. ",

        "Doc: For?\r\n",
        "Margo: My \r\napology. ",
        "Doc: Because I \r\nasked someone how married you are? ",
        "Margo: No, \r\nbecause it's none of your business how married I am. ",
        "Doc: All right, \r\nsorry. I apologize. If I had known you and your husband were having problems --\r\n",
        "Margo: We're -- \r\nTom and I are not having problems! Tom and I are perfectly happy! The question \r\nwas inappropriate. ",
        "Doc: And that's \r\nwhy I asked my lawyer instead of asking you. ",
        "Margo: But -- \r\nJessica is my best friend. So anything you say to her about me is -- ",
        "Doc: Eventually \r\ngets back to you, I understand that. And that's what I love about you. \r\n",

        "Margo: Good. \r\nGood. ",
        "Doc: But I do \r\nlove your smile. You know what, I would not apologize for that. I won\u2019t. All \r\nright. The reason why I'm down here -- my boss told me to come by here and \r\napologize for jumping in that pool and getting arrested. ",
        "Margo: Okay. \r\nWell, consider your duty done. Okay? ",
        "Doc: And I want \r\nto thank you for getting me an attorney. ",

        "Rosanna: Where \r\ndid you get that? ",
        "Jordan: \r\nBeautiful, amazing, rich Rosanna Cabot! I was driving myself nuts trying to put \r\nit all together. Why would a woman like you be into me? ",

        "Katie: I'm \r\nsorry. I'm sorry, but everything's perfect now. I saved Mike's life and he \r\nbelieves me. I didn't even have to tell him about the bug. ",

        "Mike: Start \r\nfrom the beginning, Katie. ",
        "Katie: I had to \r\nknow what Pilar was up to. So, yes, we planted a bug and then we were listening \r\nin the alleyway. And it's a good thing. ",
        "Mike: What did \r\nyou hear? ",
        "Pilar: There \r\nwas nothing to hear! ",
        "Katie: Pilar \r\nwas on the phone with somebody, saying how you were gonna get it! And Henry \r\nheard, too, right? ",
        "Henry: If a bug \r\nwas planted by some unknown person, I may have heard something about it. \r\n",
        "Pilar: I was \r\ntalking about dinner. I was on the phone ordering take-out. ",
        "Katie: Oh, \r\nthat's a good one. Like when any normal person orders food like this, \"hi, it's \r\nPilar. Mike's here. You know what to do.\" And, another thing, Ms. \"I have an \r\nanswer for everything\" -- you were ordering take-out -- where is it? ",

        "Katie: About \r\nthe phone call and the take-out, maybe. But I know what I saw. Pilar put poison \r\nor something into this glass. And when Margo shows up, she's going to be \r\narresting Pilar, not me. ",

        "Rosanna: I \r\noften do research for young executives for my company. ",

        "Rosanna: Are \r\nyou going to yell at me, or are you going to let me explain? ",
        "Jordan: Sure. \r\nExplain the sudden interest. Was that just me, or do you do that for all the \r\nyoung professionals? ",
