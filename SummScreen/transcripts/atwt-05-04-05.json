        "Katie: Let's talk about the cubs, or your family. Don't know anything about them. When am I going to meet them, Henry?",
        "Henry: No segues, sweetheart. We were talking about Mike and Jen.",
        "Katie: They're together, they're happy. Craig's gone. Problem solved. Ooh, the zins look good.",
        "Henry: I don't want to be a nag here, but just parking Craig on Pluto does not put you in the clear.",
        "Katie: But why do they have to know that I spilled the beans?",
        "Henry: Because beans are funny, they repeat on you. Look, the longer that you keep a lie out there, the greater the chance it's gonna come back to hurt you, okay?",
        "Katie: I love when you get all protective. It's so sweet.",
        "Henry: Don't, don't, don't, don't even. I invented the art of the schmooze.",
        "Katie: Okay, fine. Fine. I will tell them. Okay? I just need to do it in my own way. As soon as I figure out what my own way is. Okay? Wait, Henry, I've got it. I think I know how to tell Mike the truth and still end up his friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Schiller: I didn't divulge any specifics about your case, Jennifer. I always guard my patients' privacy, but Katie led me to believe that you two were close friends. I'm sorry if I've caused a problem of any kind.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no. It's not your fault. Dr. Schiller, but -- could Mike and I have a few moments alone, please?",
        "Dr. Schiller: Of course. Here's your sonogram picture, before I forget.",
        "Mike: I can't believe Katie. I can't believe she'd do this to us?",
        "Jennifer: Hey, where are you going?",
        "Mike: I'm not letting her get away with this. I'll meet you back at the house.",
        "Jennifer: Mike, no, don't leave like this, not now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So you're like my permanent bodyguard now?",
        "Will: Yeah, why not?",
        "Alison: Because I don't need one. You saw the bars on my windows, and I've got a new deadbolt.",
        "Will: Well, you haven't been here in a while. It might still be kind of weird for you. Is your cell phone charged?",
        "Alison: I'm gonna plug it in as soon as I get inside. Will, really, I'm fine. Okay, so I'm a little freaked, but I'm sure that it won't last long.",
        "Will: You know, Emily said that you could stay there. Or I could drive you to your Mom's.",
        "Alison: No, that'll just make the next time worse.",
        "Will: You're sure about this?",
        "Alison: I'm sure.",
        "Will: All right, call me if you need anything.",
        "Alison: Will do.",
        "Will: Bye.",
        "[Crashing sound]",
        "Alison: What was that?",
        "Will: I'll check it out.",
        "Alison: Thank you. I know I'm just being stupid.",
        "Will: No, you're not at all. Okay, I'll figure out what this is. And don't worry, I'm not gonna leave until I know you're okay.",

        "Holden: Faith? Luke? Lily?",
        "Lucinda: Hi.",
        "Holden: Hi.",
        "Lucinda: Um, the girls are in the den with the sitter.",
        "Holden: Oh. Well, Faith -- she left this at the farm. I thought I'd bring it by. Where's Lily?",
        "Lucinda: She was leaving just as I was arriving.",
        "Holden: She's out?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah, she's out. Mm-hmm. Your wife is officially dating a murderer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Joe: I did the job. I took care of her, just like you asked me to. Now it's time to get paid for it. I want my money now.",
        "[Lily remembering]",
        "Lucinda: You've got yourself all gussied up to go out with a murderer?",
        "Lily: Hey, I'm sorry I'm a little earl -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had company.",
        "Keith: Oh, no. No problem here. We're -- we're finished.",
        "Lily: Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Oh, Lily, this is an old friend of mine, Joe Spinelli. This is Lily.",
        "Joe: A pleasure.",
        "Lily: So how do you two know each other?",
        "Keith: Flight school. He's just visiting a cousin here in Oakdale.",
        "Lily: Oh. I see you two are in the middle of something. I'll just wait for you in the lobby.",
        "Keith: No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. We're finished. In fact, I'll just -- let me walk you to the elevator. I'll be right back.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Joe: See ya.",
        "Lily: Bye.",
        "Keith: Hey, come on. You'll get your money.",
        "Joe: When?",
        "Keith: Soon.",
        "Joe: Soon don't pay the bills. I'll give you got 24 hours, pal. After that I take what's owed me.",
        "Keith: Hey, Lily.",
        "Lily: Hey. Are you sure you still want to go out?",
        "Keith: Absolutely. Yes.",
        "Lily: It's just that your friend didn't seem all that ready to leave.",
        "Keith: Ah, he's a little intense. He should have called first. I'd have told him I had plans. Now I understand there's a new martini menu at the Metro. Do you feel like experimenting?",
        "Lily: Sure.",
        "Keith: Good, come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: There is a trust fund. And he wants to get his hands on it. It's for the kid.",
        "Holden: Yeah, J.J.'s trust fund. I know all about it.",
        "Lucinda: And you know that he gained control of it when Julia died. Don't you think that's convenient?",
        "Holden: Who told you this?",
        "Lucinda: I had a chat with Les Sweeny.",
        "Holden: Les Sweeny?",
        "Lucinda: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holden: You're listening to Les Sweeny?",
        "Lucinda: He has a checkered past, but about this, he's right.",
        "Holden: The guy's spent half his life in jail.",
        "Lucinda: Would you please give me a little credit around here? For heaven's sake! Here. I got that from a friend of mine. He's on the board of the First National Bank of Chicago. Now read that before you walk. That will prove what kind of a man Morrissey really is.",

        "Celia: You like it?",
        "Casey: What's with the poodle?",
        "Celia: It was the style.",
        "Casey: Why poodles? Why not schnauzers?",
        "Celia: Casey, I'm serious.",
        "Casey: You'll look great. You'll look just like what's her name from the movie -- did they ever show \"Grease\" on Montegan TV?",
        "Celia: Sure.",
        "Casey: Looks like I'm gonna have to stock up on my hair oil.",
        "Celia: You're not serious.",
        "Casey: If you're gonna look like the real thing, so am I.",
        "Celia: Oh, well, you'll be the handsomest greaser at Yo's.",
        "Casey: Or I'll be the luckiest.",
        "Celia: You mean that?",
        "Casey: Would I lie to you?",
        "Celia: You kind of don't mind lying to Alison.",
        "Casey: I didn't lie to Alison. I just didn't want to say anything that was gonna get will in trouble.",
        "Celia: She should know about him being in her apartment.",
        "Casey: I still don't see how that's our business.",
        "Celia: It's Alison's business. She has a right to her privacy, Casey, and he didn't respect that. She shouldn't trust him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Look familiar?",
        "Alison: Aaron collects these old things. I hung it on the door to remind me of him.",
        "Will: It must have fallen off when you came in.",
        "Alison: Yeah. You can say it. I'm a chicken.",
        "Will: I was freaked out, too.",
        "Alison: I guess no matter how many bars are on the window, it's not the same without Aaron here.",
        "Will: Yeah, I guess that's one thing guys can still be good at. You know, making their girlfriends feel safe.",
        "Alison: Yeah, not just safe. You know, when I went through stuff, like breaking up with Chris, he would never let me feel down or feel sorry for myself.",
        "Will: Well, what would he do?",
        "Alison: We would have all-night poker marathons. And we'd play until one of us fell asleep. And the loser would have to clean up the next morning.",
        "Will: Well, poker. That's great, I love poker. I haven't played in years. Let's play poker.",
        "Alison: It's late, and I'm too old for a baby-sitter.",
        "Will: No, I could use the practice. And you'll call the game.",
        "Alison: Okay, but then I'm throwing you out.",
        "Will: You got it.",
        "Alison: I'll get the cards. The chips are on the desk. I'll make us some popcorn.",
        "Will: Popcorn sounds great.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I want tonight to be about us. Okay? Not about Katie. Not about Craig. Look -- this is what we just saw. This is our baby. Can you believe it?",
        "Mike: It still blows me away to think that you have this little person growing inside of you right now.",
        "Jennifer: And pretty soon we'll be able to know if it's a boy or a girl.",
        "Mike: Do you want to know?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I'm not sure.",
        "Mike: It'd make doing the nursery a lot easier. I figured I'd ask Lucinda if we could add on a nursery on top of that studio I promised you. You know, that way we can stay at the lake.",
        "Jennifer: Would that involve you wandering around in that sexy tool belt?",
        "Mike: It'd be a lot of work, but I think I can get it done.",
        "Jennifer: I love the idea of making a home for our baby.",
        "Mike: So do I.",
        "Jennifer: I was so scared, Mike. I just kept praying, \"God, please, let me keep this baby. Let me keep our life together.\" That's all I want.",
        "Mike: That's what I want, too. But just because I'm happy with you doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about what Katie did to us.",
        "Jennifer: Well, just for tonight then, okay? 'Cause tonight I want to celebrate all of this and how lucky we are.",
        "Mike: Okay. Okay. You know, when I heard you tell Dr. Schiller that you were the father, it made me feel like we were already a family. And Katie can't take that away from us. Craig can't take that away from us. Right now, nobody can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, you really sure this is all it's gonna take? You throw a little party and all is forgiven?",
        "Katie: Just get the banner ready, okay? Oh, no. They're not even home. What am I going to do now?",
        "Henry: You're going to be grateful that you have a chance to rethink this. Because I think mock-champagne and flowers, it makes it look like you're trying to bribe Mike to forgive you.",
        "Katie: Oh, no. Mike won't think that.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know grudges, sweetheart. I come from a long line of who is not speaking to whom and why.",
        "Katie: We've been through so much. It just makes me so sad to think that this could all be over.",
        "Henry: Well, look on the bright side. You'll still got me.",
        "Katie: Oh, I know, thank God. Look, Henry, you didn't create this mess. You shouldn't have to clean it up. Thank you so much for being here with me and supporting me, but I think that this is something I should do alone. Okay?",
        "Henry: Okay. I'll wait for you at Java, all right? Good luck.",
        "Katie: Thanks. I'll need it.",
        "Mike: I'm starving. Let's have some breakfast for dinner. We'll have some waffles or some eggs. What are you doing here?",
        "Katie: I'm here to surprise you. What's wrong? Did something happen with the baby?",
        "Jennifer: Why do you want to know, so you can report back to Craig?",
        "Mike: We know exactly what you did. So don't come here and act like you give a damn about us or our baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Full house, queens high. I own you, pal.",
        "Will: I'm not busted yet. We'll play one more hand. We go all in. Winner takes all.",
        "Alison: Anything wild?",
        "Will: Just the ladies.",
        "Alison: One.",
        "Will: You sure -- just one?",
        "Alison: Just one. I'm glad that you stayed, Will. You're great company.",
        "Will: That's the nicest thing anybody's said to me in a long time.",
        "Alison: Will? Will, my card?",
        "Will: Yeah, right. Just one?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Will was hanging out in Alison's apartment, but that doesn't mean that he trashed it. I mean, he would never hurt her that way.",
        "Celia: Are you sure? The guy is crazy to get her attention. He's using the situation, Casey.",
        "Casey: Maybe he is. So would a ton of other guys with a big crush on a really hot girl.",
        "Celia: So that makes it okay?",
        "Casey: No, but, if I was -- I mean --",
        "Margo: Here straight up, guys, what do you guys think? Huh?",
        "Casey: For you?",
        "Margo: No, this is for your dad. I'm wearing army boots. Duh, for Yo's -- the '50s dance, huh?",
        "Celia: It's great. I love it.",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Margo: It's not too young for me?",
        "Casey: No, it's great.",
        "Margo: It's great? It's great sandy? It's great Rizzo?",
        "Casey: The one with the blonde hair.",
        "Margo: Sandy. I can do that. I can do dangerously innocent. Would you hold onto this stuff? I'll go get some coffee.",
        "Casey: Sure.",
        "Celia: I can't wear that skirt now.",
        "Casey: Why not?",
        "Celia: Do you want me to look like your mom?",
        "Casey: Don't even go there.",
        "Celia: I'll get another outfit.",
        "Casey: At this hour?",
        "Celia: I know the perfect place, and the price is right. I won't be long.",
        "Casey: Okay.",

        "Lucinda: Mm-hmm. The man tried to pilfer from the child's account the very same day -- the same day -- that his sister was murdered.",
        "Holden: It's still not proof that he killed her.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, do you want this man to tuck your children in at night? I mean, you've gotta do something before it's too late.",
        "Holden: It's not my job to tell Lily how to run her life.",
        "Lucinda: But it is your job -- it's your job to protect your family.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, I know that you love Lily. I know that you love this family.",
        "Lucinda: Do you, really? Because I always thought that was something that you and I had in common. Maybe not much of anything else. I know I'm not an expert on marriage. Lord knows I'm not. But I know a few simple things, like if a marriage is gonna succeed, both people each morning having to say, \"we're going to do our damndest to make this thing succeed.\"",
        "Holden: If you know so much, why don't you write a book about it?",
        "Lucinda: Holden, Holden! Do you like being a stranger in your own home?",
        "Holden: No, I don't. Do you know how long I stood outside trying to decide whether or not I should use my key or ring the bell? It would have felt weird letting myself in, but the thought of ringing the bell was even worse. My kids are here, Lucinda, but my life isn't here. I showed up earlier, the guy's car is in the driveway.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I'm sorry. His car.",
        "Holden: For your information, I woke up every morning and I tried to stay married. I did everything that I could possibly imagine. So don't lecture me about what it takes to make a marriage work.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. It's just that Lily doesn't listen to what I say. I mean, she hasn't for ages. But I know she still -- she still cares very much what you say. So don't turn your back on her now when she needs you -- you.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, she's not listening to anything that I say anymore either.",
        "Lucinda: Then you're not the hero I thought you were.",
        "Holden: I guess I'm not.",

        "Lily: Nothing, I'm fine.",
        "Keith: You don't want a drink?",
        "Lily: No, no, thanks.",
        "Keith: Have I done something? Because you've been really quiet all the way over here, you know?",
        "Lily: Sorry.",
        "Keith: Well, don't be sorry. Just tell me what's going on.",
        "Lily: Oh, I'm just not feeling that well.",
        "Keith: Oh, okay. Well, then come on. I'll take you home.",
        "Lily: No, no, I'll take a taxi. I'll get my car tomorrow. That's okay.",
        "Keith: Wait a second. Now listen, up until about a half hour ago we had a really great day today.",
        "Lily: Yeah, well, that's the trouble with flying. Eventually you have to land back on earth.",
        "Keith: Yeah, but right now you're looking for the closest exit that you can run out of. Why?",
        "Lily: I heard your conversation with Joe. Who did he take care of for you? And why is he holding it over your head?",
        "Keith: That conversation had nothing to do with you. You shouldn't have heard it.",

        "Keith: Are you attracted to another man?",

        "Lily: Who would you like it to be?",
        "Katie: Mike?",
        "Mike: You're a liar.",

        "Keith: Well, you know, you obviously heard something that you don't understand. And I can only imagine what you're thinking.",
        "Lily: Well, what am I supposed to think, when you hustled that guy out of there so fast?",
        "Keith: Well, okay, for the record, that guy Joe, he is an old friend of mine from flight school. But he's not in town visiting anybody. He's here to collect some money that I owe him.",
        "Lily: For taking care of her?",
        "Keith: That would be the landlady. See, the apartment I had in Chicago, I couldn't get back there because I was here. So I asked him to close it up and pay the bill. And I told him I'd pay him back, and I haven't. So he obviously came to town in person to collect.",
        "Lily: Why didn't you just tell me that?",
        "Keith: That I stiffed a friend because I'm, you know, obsessed with putting Sweeny away?",
        "Lily: No, I would have understood that. Everything's been so crazy.",
        "Keith: I know, but it's still not right. I'm gonna pay him tomorrow.",
        "Lily: You closed up your apartment in Chicago?",
        "Keith: Yeah, I did. Well, J.J. is happy here. And I want him happy.",
        "Lily: Oh, J.J. That's very generous of you. He's very lucky to have you. I'll have an apple martini. What? What? What?",
        "Keith: Well, what did you think? That that guy Joe was some, you know, mob guy or something?",
        "Lily: No, I don't know. I just -- I made a horrible mistake listening to my mother. I can usually tune her out.",
        "Keith: Really, what did she have say?",
        "Lily: Oh, you don't want to know that.",
        "Keith: I do want to know. What'd she say?",
        "Lily: She had a very interesting conversation with Sweeny down at the police station. And she has you pegged as a murderer who's now after her heiress daughter.",
        "Keith: Your mother and Sweeny? Now there's an odd couple.",
        "Lily: They don't get any odder than that.",
        "Keith: No. Um, apple martini. I'll have a vodka soda. You know, your mother's not a fan. But the idea that she's judging me based on what that slimeball Sweeny has to say --",
        "Lily: Oh, you can't take this personally. Because she thinks everybody's after my money.",
        "Keith: Including Holden?",
        "Lily: Well, she thought that about him in the beginning. It took a long time for her to warm up to him. Now, God forbid, I'm attracted to another man.",
        "Keith: Are you attracted to another man?",
        "Lily: Yes, I am.",
        "Keith: Well, who would that lucky guy be?",

        "Margo: I hope you're hungry because -- where's Celia?",
        "Casey: She had to go get something.",
        "Margo: Oh, man, Case, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you again and mess up a date?",
        "Casey: No, she's gonna come back in a little bit.",
        "Margo: Okay, well here, I got you your favorite, cinnamon.",
        "Casey: Thanks.",
        "Margo: So is this gonna be weird for you, your dad and me at the dance? Are we gonna embarrass you then?",
        "Casey: No more than usual.",
        "Margo: Oh, you wise guy.",
        "Casey: A lot of kids' parents are gonna be there. I mean, it is your era, right?",
        "Margo: No. No, don't they teach you math in school? Or history -- or anything?",
        "Casey: Well, what was your era then?",
        "Margo: The '80s. Just anything past love beads.",
        "Casey: Love what?",
        "Margo: Never mind. You know what? I gotta get home and get ready. Okay?",
        "Casey: But the dance isn't until tomorrow night.",
        "Margo: I know, but it takes a long time for us old ladies to get ready. Oh, man!",
        "Casey: Sorry.",
        "Margo: I don't believe this.",
        "Casey: Hair dye?",
        "Margo: No, it's nice n'easy root touch-up. Just let it be.",
        "Casey: But your hair looks great, Mom.",
        "Margo: You know what? Lisa swears by this stuff and if Lisa swears by it, it's gotta be good. And you, stop looking at my roots.",
        "Casey: Well, maybe I'm gonna dye my hair, too.",
        "Margo: Well, you know, this could be the beginning of a whole new makeover for your old mom. You're not gonna recognize me tomorrow night.",
        "Casey: Sure I will. You'll be the one checking my friends' sodas for booze.",
        "Margo: Yeah, you got that right.",

        "Alison: Unless the dealer's stacking the deck.",
        "Will: Are you accusing me of letting you win?",
        "Alison: I'm accusing you of trying to keep an eye on me.",
        "Will: Why would I do that? You're a big girl.",
        "Alison: And you're exhausted. Come on, you're out of here.",
        "Will: You still look pretty wired, though.",
        "Alison: I'll play solitaire.",
        "Will: You know, if you want me to, I can crash on the floor.",
        "Alison: I've seen some pretty gross things crawl across that floor at night.",
        "Will: Well, I've slept in worse places.",
        "Alison: I'm gonna have to be alone eventually.",
        "Will: Okay, well, I have my cell phone on if you need anything.",
        "Alison: Okay. I'll speed dial you right after 911. I promise.",
        "Will: All right. Don't forget to lock the door. [Knock at the door] Are you expecting anyone?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Will: Okay, well, stay there. I'm gonna see who this is. What are you doing here?",
        "Celia: I was about to ask you the same thing.",
        "Alison: I was a little freaked so Will offered to give me some company. Isn't that sweet?",
        "Celia: Yeah, real sweet.",

        "Mike: You thought you could grill Jen's doctor for information, pass it along to Craig and we wouldn't find out about it.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. It was not like that.",
        "Jennifer: Dr. Schiller told us that you hammered her with questions.",
        "Katie: I asked a few questions, but I didn't intend to make a problem like this. It's not my fault that someone just left your file right in front of me.",
        "Jennifer: You read my file?",
        "Katie: I just took a look. I'm so sorry. I didn't know that Craig would react like this and ruin everything for you guys.",
        "Mike: Sure you did.",
        "Katie: No, I didn't. I did not tell him on purpose.",
        "Jennifer: So the subject of when my baby was due just kind of came up?",
        "Katie: Craig was positive that you were further along than you were. And when he said ten weeks, it was like a reflex -- I just corrected him. I didn't even know what I had said until I saw his face. And then I realized what I had done. By then it was too late. He was halfway to the airport to catch a plane to Las Vegas. I am so sorry. I didn't mean for any of this to happen. You have to believe me. But you know, if Jen had just told Craig the truth from the beginning maybe he wouldn't have been scared that you guys were trying to steal his baby.",
        "Mike: Okay, so now it's Jen's fault?",
        "Katie: No, it's not. I'm sorry. It is not Jen's fault. It is my fault. That is why I'm here tonight. I was here to admit it finally. I'm sorry I didn't tell you before this. I was just so scared.",
        "Mike: Scared of what?",
        "Katie: Of losing you -- both of you. Your friendship means the world to me.",
        "Mike: Katie, if you would have came to me right away, I would have been mad, but I would have understood.",
        "Katie: I know. I know. I'm sorry. I just didn't know how to tell you.",
        "Mike: So you stood by and watched as Craig hurt your so-called \"friends?\"",
        "Katie: I didn't mean to. Please, you have to forgive me. I don't even talk to Craig anymore.",
        "Jennifer: So does Craig know that we're getting married?",
        "Katie: I don't even know where Craig is.",
        "Mike: I don't believe you.",
        "Katie: Mike --",
        "Mike: You're a liar.",
        "Katie: Don't say that.",
        "Mike: You know what? Just go home. I don't have anything else left to say to you.",
        "Katie: Don't worry. I'm on my way out. You'll never have to see me again.",
        "Jennifer: Actually, I'd like you to stay.",
        "Katie: Just tell Mike again how sorry I am.",
        "Jennifer: You tell him.",
        "Katie: He won't talk to me.",
        "Jennifer: Well, Katie, I'm sure that you can find some way. Some project or some plan or some cheap trick to get to him.",
        "Katie: You must really hate me now.",
        "Jennifer: You know, I am you, Katie. We both want the same thing. We both want Mike's love.",
        "Katie: Not me. I love Henry, and I explained to you --",
        "Jennifer: About Craig. Yeah, I got that part. You told him about the baby by accident. But you know what I think? I think unconsciously, you knew exactly what you were doing. You thought that if Craig were in the picture, it could end things between me and Mike.",
        "Katie: I don't want Mike.",
        "Jennifer: Katie, everything you do is shallow and temporary, including marrying Henry and all of this ridiculousness. It's all to get Mike to fall in love with you again.",
        "Katie: That is not true, Jennifer. It used to be true, but everything changed when I married Henry.",
        "Jennifer: You know, I really don't get you and Henry. But I don't really care, because all your spying and all your tricks won't get you what you want. You and Mike are over, all right? Mike loves me, and we're a family, Katie. And that is the only truth that matters.",

        "Alison: Oh, I can't. I'm beat. Will, why don't you go?",
        "Will: Well, I'm pretty tired. You know what? They close soon, though. You should hustle.",
        "Alison: We'll have to take a rain check.",
        "Celia: Thanks for the skirt. Will, you sure you don't want to come?",
        "Will: No, I think I'm gonna stick around here. You know, check the deadbolt, make sure the bars are on tight.",
        "Celia: Then I guess I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Will: Bye, Celia.",
        "Alison: Bye. You don't have to check anything. This place is Hal Munson grade security.",

        "Keith: Yeah. Uh-huh. So, yeah -- there was this 20-foot tiger shark out there. So that's the last time I'm going skinny dipping in the ocean.",
        "Lily: That big, huh?",
        "Keith: Oh, huge. [Phone rings] Wait a minute. Oh, it's J.J. I should probably take this.",
        "Lily: Go ahead.",
        "Keith: I haven't got much of a signal, though.",
        "Lily: Take it outside. Go ahead, I'll order another round.",
        "Keith: Yeah.",

        "Holden: I saw his car in the drive when I dropped the girls off.",
        "Lily: Yeah, I know. I know. Why didn't you come in?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Lily: Do you have a problem with Keith?",
        "Holden: I'm not sure about that yet.",
        "Lily: Ah, I see. My mother strikes again. Are you on the bandwagon that Keith is a murderer who killed his own sister?",
        "Holden: Are you sure that he didn't?",
        "Lily: Yes. I am.",
        "Holden: I'm just saying I think maybe you ought to take it slow, get to know the guy a little bit better.",
        "Lily: Really? Did you take it slow when you had sex with Julia? Are there two sets of rules here?",
        "Holden: I'm thinking about the kids here.",
        "Lily: Were you thinking about the kids when you walked out on their mother?",

        "Celia: Doesn't mean he doesn't.",
        "Casey: Maybe he's just being nice.",
        "Celia: He's making the most of Aaron being in Seattle, that's what he's doing.",
        "Casey: Maybe Alison wanted him to be there.",
        "Celia: She wouldn't want him there if she knew that he was in that apartment before that break-in.",
        "Casey: Okay, I'll talk to Will.",
        "Celia: No, talk to Alison.",
        "Casey: No. Will should tell Alison.",
        "Celia: Will's busy playing Boy Scout, like he's this great guy.",
        "Casey: Why are you all over this?",
        "Celia: Because Aaron and Alison have been great to me. I owe them, Casey.",
        "Casey: Okay, fine. I'll talk to Will, but I'm not going to go behind his back to do it. He's gonna be the one to tell Alison, not me and not you. So drop it, okay? It's only fair. I don't feel like talking about this anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You were so right, Henry, I just should have told Mike sooner.",

        "Katie: I don't want new friends.",
        "Henry: Well, they've written us off. So we're gonna have to move on, you know?",
        "Katie: No, I can't move on. I can't live with Mike thinking that I'm secretly spying for Craig. And I can't live with Jennifer thinking that I'm only doing this to get Mike back.",
        "Henry: Who cares what they think?",
        "Katie: I do. Because they're wrong.",
        "Henry: How you gonna prove that?",
        "Katie: I've got you. Together we can do anything. We'll just show Mike and Jen that whatever they think they think about me, isn't really what they think at all. You are so wonderful. Thank you, Henry. I feel so much better already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: You feeling better?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, the shower helped. Mike, Katie still loves you.",

        "Jennifer: I don't know. But I'm just -- I'm scared, Mike. You know, of wanting all this too much. Wanting you and the baby. I'm happy, but I'm just -- I'm afraid that it won't last.",
        "Mike: Hey, look, Katie can't hurt us anymore. You're the only one I want to be with. That's not true. Actually you and this little fuzzy gray person who I hope gets your eyes. This is forever. Jen, the three of us are forever.",

        "Holden: I'm just asking you to be careful.",
        "Lily: Were you careful?",
        "Holden: Is this about revenge?",
        "Lily: No, it's not about revenge. It's about fun. I'm having a lot of fun with Keith. It's been a really long time since I've had any fun. And if you're really worried about the kids, don't be. Because they like Keith. Oh, or is that what's really bothering you?",
        "Holden: No, what's bothering me is that the guy isn't being straight -- you know what, just forget it.",
        "Lily: Yeah, let's forget it. Let's forget this conversation ever even happened.",
        "Holden: Yeah, you do that. And in between laughs over the next round of drinks, why don't you ask Keith about J.J.'s trust fund. Why don't you ask him what he did the very day that Julia died. I don't think you'll be laughing when you get all the facts.",
        "Keith: Here you go. Everything okay?",
        "Lily: He's just -- Holden's just trying to get to me. That's all.",
        "Keith: Is it working?",
