        "Dusty talks about moving in with Johnny, as Lucy is nearby listening. She isn't sure, but Dusty is able to convince her. Meg pretends to have a cold when Paul has to take Eliza to her appointment. Meg heads out after placing some doubt in Paul's mind and goes to bump into Dusty at the Lakeview. She sees him with Johnny and Lucy and hears from Johnny that Dusty is moving in. Dusty tries to get Meg to admit why she is with Paul, but she doesn't and tells him that it isn't his business. She starts to get upset, as Dusty offers her his handkerchief. Lucy watches Dusty and Meg interact. After Meg leaves, Lucy asks Dusty about her, as he admits he is having trouble forgetting her, which bothers Lucy. Paul calls Meg but gets no answer. Meg arrives home right before Paul and purposely places Dusty's handkerchief by her bedside table. When Meg leaves the room, Paul sees this. When she comes back, he throws her by asking her to go to Paris with him. She isn't sure, but when she sees the handkerchief is gone, she tells him due to her cold, she doesn't think she should travel. She offers to make all of his travel arrangements though. Later, Paul cancels his supposed trip to Paris, as a smiling Meg listens in on the extension. Craig and Jack butt heads, as Craig thinks his hatred is causing Jack to not look into any other theories over the killing of Caesar. When Craig learns of the time of death, he realizes he has an alibi \u0096 Parker. Jack refuses to let Craig manipulate or use his son to get him off. Craig sneaks in a call to Carly to ask her to bring down Parker. Carly initially refuses, but Craig won't give up. Jack and Craig are going at it again when Carly and Parker show up. Jack is angry, but Parker backs up Craig's story, but he can't say specifically of the time being exactly at 3PM, but it is close enough to that time. That is all Jack needs to decide that Craig is still guilty and pathetic for using a 16 year old, but everyone sees Craig's innocence. Carly tries to talk with Jack, but she can't sway him. Craig is happy that Carly believes him. Carly offers to help prove that Dusty was the one that set him up. An agitated Lucy tells Dusty that she is feeling like a glorified nanny and that everything that is going down is all about him. She stops short of declaring her feelings, but Dusty tries to comfort her by declaring how good of friends they are so Lucy storms off. Johnny is wondering where Lucy and Craig are, but Dusty hopes he is happy to just be with him. Carly sees Lucy afterwards; she needs her help because the two of them are the only ones that seem to believe in Craig's innocence. She wants Lucy to help her prove just that."

        "Paul: You were fine at breakfast.",
        "Meg: It just hit me out of nowhere. All of a sudden, I'm achy and congested. Look, would you mind taking Eliza alone?",
        "Paul: No, of course not. Why don't you come with us, and you can talk to the doctor yourself?",
        "Meg: No, look, it's just a cold. There's nothing a doctor can do. I just need to get into bed and get some rest.",
        "Paul: Okay. Are you sure?",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: All right, I'll go get Eliza ready.",

        "Lucy: Hey! Did you have fun on your play date after school?",
        "Dusty: He and Steve had a great time.",
        "Lucy: Yeah? What are you looking for?",
        "Johnny: Where's Daddy?",
        "Dusty: Oh, your other dad had to go away for a while. But I've been thinking. How would you like it if I came to stay with you and Lulu?",
        "Lucy: Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Hmm? You'd be here with all your games and artwork. I'd be able to play with you and tuck you in at night. Would you like that?",
        "Lucy: Sweetie, why don't you go put your stuff away, and go have a snack after that, okay?",
        "Dusty: He didn't seem too excited about my plan.",
        "Lucy: He misses our dad.",
        "Dusty: What's your excuse? Are you tired of me already?",
        "Lucy: Moving in here is kind of huge. Don't you think you should have talked to me first?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I guess I should have. I figured you'd be okay with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Mom? Mom?",
        "Carly: Hey. I'm right here. I was just doing some laundry.",
        "Parker: Yeah?",
        "Carly: Yeah. How was school?",
        "Parker: Weird.",
        "Carly: \"Weird\" how?",
        "Parker: I just -- I feel like I've been out living this whole life in an alternate universe while my friends just stood still.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I bet. That'll pass. Hey, did they like your new car?",
        "Parker: They love the car.",
        "Carly: And how are your teachers and your coach?",
        "Parker: Well, I've got massive homework, and coach actually gave me an extra hour of batting practice.",
        "Carly: Ooh. Do you feel like it's too much?",
        "Parker: No. No, it's cool. And things are cool with you, right? No one's threatening to haul you off to jail?",
        "Carly: You don't have to worry about me. Craig cleared me.",
        "Parker: Well, he's out now, too, right?",
        "Carly: No, they're still holding him.",
        "Parker: Since last night? Didn't he get a lawyer?",
        "Carly: They haven't officially charged him with anything.",
        "Parker: Well, what are the charges, anyway?",
        "Carly: They think that he was using our vodka shipments as a way to smuggle guns. And there's something else, but I'm sure it won't stick.",
        "Parker: What is it? Mom, tell me.",
        "Carly: One of the dockworkers, the man who was in charge of loading -- he was killed.",
        "Parker: Man. Did Craig do it?",
        "Carly: No. No, I really don't think he did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I've had enough of the questions. I've had enough of your stonewalling. I need to get out of here.",
        "Jack: That works for me. Are you ready to plead guilty?",
        "Craig: I didn't do anything, Jack. You obviously don't have enough evidence to charge me, so I demand to be released.",
        "Jack: Actually, the evidence is mounting.",
        "Craig: Good. Use it to go get the real killer/gun runner.",
        "Jack: Coroner pinned down the victim's actual time of death.",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Craig: I'll bite. What time did he die?",
        "Jack: You tell me.",
        "Craig: How would I know? I wasn't there.",
        "Jack: Where were you on Friday, April 24th, between 3:00 and 5:00 P.M.?",
        "Craig: 3:00 to 5:00 -- probably with Johnny. He's usually home from school by that -- did you say Friday the 24th, 3:00 to 5:00?",
        "Jack: That's exactly what I said.",
        "Craig: Well, what do you know? Thank you.",
        "Jack: What? What is it? Where were you?",
        "Craig: Not near the docks or your murdered victim, but I have the perfect witness who can vouch for me.",
        "Jack: Someone I'd actually believe?",
        "Craig: In a Tokyo minute.",
        "Jack: Okay, tell me who it is. I'll bring them in.",
        "Craig: Your son. Parker.",
        "Jack: Anyone else who can verify where you were?",
        "Craig: I don't need anyone else. Parker can clear this up with one phone call. Go ahead. Call him.",
        "Jack: I'll have someone else bring you down to your cell.",
        "Craig: Wait a minute. You're not even gonna call Parker and ask him?",
        "Jack: I'm not gonna let you manipulate my son into giving you an alibi for murder! Absolutely not!",
        "Craig: I didn't murder anyone! And Parker can prove it! Now let's just get him down here!",
        "Jack: No, I'm not gonna let you anywhere near my son, Craig! Forget about it!",
        "Craig: You don't like me. And fine, you have plenty of reasons not to, but you have no right to keep me here for a crime I didn't commit.",
        "Jack: All the evidence points to you.",
        "Craig: Parker is my alibi. You're an officer of the law. You're obligated to follow through.",
        "Jack: And I'll get around to it.",
        "Craig: Jack! I'm fighting for my life here!",
        "Jack: Are you saying that -- are you saying that you're desperate, Craig? You're willing to do anything to get these charges dropped? That much I knew.",
        "Craig: I'm telling you I'm innocent. I'm telling you to do your damn job.",
        "Jack: I am not gonna let you blackmail my son like you did countless other people in this town!",
        "Craig: Blackmail Parker? I would never blackmail Parker!",
        "Jack: Oh. Because you suddenly sprouted ethics? Is that it?",
        "Craig: No, because I'm innocent. What could I possibly blackmail that kid for? His life is an open book.",
        "Jack: Yeah, Parker's got a lot people he cares about. He's got Liberty, he's got his little sister. If you threaten them, he'll do anything you tell him to.",
        "Craig: If I was stupid enough to blackmail Parker, you know what he'd do? First thing, he would run to you, because he loves you. He respects you, obviously more than you realize. I wouldn't stand a chance. So can we just drop the power play and get him down here?",
        "Jack: Friday, April 24th, between 3:00 and 5:00 P.M. -- Where were you?",
        "Craig: I already told you. I was in my suite at the Lakeview.",
        "Jack: Anybody else who can put you there -- a maid, a waiter, masseuse?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Jack: Find another alibi, Craig. You're not using my son.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Cop: Lieutenant's on the phone for you, Jack.",
        "Jack: Take him down to his cell.",
        "Craig: If you don't mind, I'd -- I'd like a few minutes to myself, just to consider my options. Maybe we can make a deal.",
        "Jack: That's the best idea you've had all day. Man the door, Hanson.",
        "Cop: Sure thing, Detective.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: What's going to happen to him?",
        "Carly: Oh, I don't know. But it's not for you to worry about. You just focus on yourself. You focus on being 16 and happy.",
        "Parker: Well, you know what makes me pretty happy? Driving my car.",
        "Carly: I bet it does. After your homework. Go.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Hey, Jack. What's going on?",
        "Craig: Carly, it's me.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack's letting you make personal phone calls from the police station now?",
        "Craig: No, he thinks I'm calling my lawyer.",
        "Carly: I think you probably should.",
        "Carly: I need your help.",
        "Carly: Help how?",
        "Craig: I need you to bring Parker down here.",
        "Carly: Why?",
        "Craig: Because he's my alibi. Carly, are you there?",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig. And just when I was starting to think you might actually be innocent this time.",
        "Craig: I am innocent. I swear I am. And Parker can prove it.",
        "Carly: What's the scam, Craig?",
        "Craig: There is no scam. I just need Parker to tell the truth. Now, can you bring him down here? Carly, what are you thinking?",
        "Carly: That you ought to call that lawyer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens and closes]",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Meg: Hi.",
        "Paul: I thought you'd be in bed.",
        "Meg: I thought you would have left by now. But you know, this is good, because I forgot to tell you Eliza was rubbing her ear this morning. So if you could get the doctor to check that out, make sure she's not getting an infection.",
        "Paul: Okay. You going somewhere?",
        "Meg: No, of course not. I took a shower to make myself feel better.",
        "Paul: Did you put on perfume?",
        "Meg: Just my usual. [Chuckles] Did I lay it on too strong? My nose is still stuffed up. I can't smell a thing. [Sniffs] Oh, did you get Eliza all dressed up and ready to go? Because if you don't leave soon, you're gonna be late.",
        "Paul: Right. Yeah, I just came up to tell you that we were on our way.",
        "Meg: Okay. Well, give her a kiss for me. I've been trying to avoid her all morning. I don't want her to get my cold.",
        "[Meg sniffs]",
        "Paul: Yeah. Well, feel better.",
        "Meg: Thanks. I'll try.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: There was a legal opportunity for me to get my son back. I had to take it.",
        "Lucy: But doing it this way is --",
        "Dusty: My wife's dying wish was for me to raise that boy properly. I don't want to screw up. What's the problem with me staying here for a while?",
        "Lucy: I'm living here, too, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Well, if it's about privacy, I can stay on the couch. And I'll pick up after myself. I swear.",
        "Lucy: I'll make sure we have enough linens.",
        "Dusty: All right. I know I've been tough on you. If you want, I can move Johnny into my place, but I don't think it'll be good for him.",
        "Lucy: No, you're right. He's got to get used to this gradually. Maybe it's the best thing.",
        "Dusty: I know you feel guilty about your father taking the rap.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I do. And if it were anyone else asking me --",
        "Johnny: Can we go get some French fries downstairs?",
        "Dusty: French fries? You bet we can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hanson: Didn't you already make your phone call?",
        "Craig: It's my lawyer's receptionist. She's brand new. She cut me off. Had to dial again.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Hello?",
        "Craig: Cheryl! No -- no, no, no. It's all right. No need to apologize. First days on the job are always tough.",
        "Carly: Who is Cheryl?",
        "Craig: No, of course I don't mind being put on hold. Just don't cut me off again. We're good. Thanks. Why'd you hang up on me?",
        "Carly: Well, I didn't want you to waste your breath, Craig. I'm not bringing Parker down there.",
        "Craig: Would you just hear me out?",
        "Carly: No. I'm not going to involve him. I'm gonna let you use him like that.",
        "Craig: I'm not trying to use him. I just want him to tell the truth.",
        "Carly: The truth about what?",
        "Craig: That he was in my suite, getting a check for $50,000 at the time Cesar was killed.",
        "Carly: Are you sure?",
        "Craig: Parker blamed me for his life going down the tubes. I tried to cheer him up with a cash incentive, and he went out and bought a car. Jack blew a gasket, and you and I permanently parted ways. Trust me. The whole thing is etched into my psyche.",
        "Carly: Well, did you tell Jack about this?",
        "Craig: Of course I did.",
        "Carly: Well, then why didn't he call Parker?",
        "Craig: Because your ex-husband has it in for me. He's bound and determined to throw the book at me, and Parker's all I've got.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry. But you don't have Parker, after all. Because I'm not bringing him down there, Craig. If you were truly at the hotel, there must be some other way to prove it.",
        "Craig: Not without a lot more trouble and a lot more time than I have. I have to get to Johnny.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I just can't involve Parker in more drama. I can't.",
        "Craig: Carly, you're the only one that can help me!",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Jack: Well, that's just about it, there, Seymour.",
        "Carly: Who's Seymour?",
        "Craig: Oh, yeah. Just get over here as soon as you can. Thank you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Excuse me. Is Dusty Donovan in?",
        "Clerk: I saw him come in a little while ago. Is he expecting you?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Clerk: Would you like me to ring Mr. Donovan's room?",
        "Meg: No, it's all right. I'm not staying. Thank you. [Meg gasps] Hey, Johnny! Look at you! Don't you look happy! Hi, Honey!",
        "Dusty: Hi.",
        "Meg: Lucy, how are you?",
        "Lucy: Good, fine.",
        "Meg: So, what have you been up to?",
        "Johnny: My daddy's going to live with me and Lulu.",
        "Meg: Your daddy?",
        "Dusty: He's talking about me.",
        "Meg: Well, that sounds like fun.",
        "Lucy: Hey, you want to go get some French fries?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, we were just gonna get French fries.",
        "Meg: Oh, well, please, go ahead. Don't let me keep you.",
        "Lucy: Oh, no. It's all right. Stay and talk. We'll just be over there. Or come and find us. Or come meet us upstairs, if you want.",
        "Meg: So, you're all living together.",
        "Dusty: Craig got himself into trouble. I applied for custody, and I've got Johnny.",
        "Meg: Looks like you've got Lucy, too.",
        "Dusty: It sounds like who I live with almost matters to you.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: It doesn't. You can live wherever you want.",
        "Dusty: Can I?",
        "Meg: Look, I'm glad you got custody of Johnny. I know what it's like to be without your child.",
        "Dusty: What you sacrifice to get your child back.",
        "Meg: Right.",
        "Dusty: Is it too much for you?",
        "Meg: Would there ever be anything you wouldn't do to be with your son?",
        "Dusty: I would do what's necessary.",
        "Meg: Yes.",
        "Dusty: I'd explore every option.",
        "Meg: What are you saying?",
        "Dusty: You have options. You have me.",
        "Meg: Don't do this, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Why do you go out of your way to make yourself miserable?",
        "Meg: I am not miserable. I need to go home.",
        "Dusty: No. What's Paul gonna do if you're not home on time?",
        "Meg: This isn't about Paul.",
        "Dusty: What's he gonna do if he knows you even spoke to me?",
        "Meg: Nothing. He trusts me.",
        "Dusty: You can't stay with him.",
        "Meg: Stop telling me what to do. And stop making assumptions about my life, assumptions about Paul. You don't have a right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Oh, come on. Why is this doctor keeping us waiting? Don't look at me like that. It's not my fault. You know what, we'll call -- aw. We'll call your mom and find out. Maybe things have changed.",

        "Jack: You surprise me, Craig.",
        "Craig: How's that, Jack?",
        "Jack: Well, I expected you to run your usual M.O. lawyer up quick, bail yourself out, pay off 20 people to give you an alibi. Why are you still here?",
        "Craig: I'll tell you why, Jack. Because my son is no longer in my custody. So I can't just \"Lawyer up\" and bail myself out. I have to prove my innocence.",
        "Jack: Go ahead. Prove it.",
        "Craig: Fine. Call Parker.",
        "Jack: We're done here.",
        "Craig: Do you want him to be subpoenaed Jack? Because as soon as my lawyer gets back from New York, that's exactly the road we're gonna go down. You're just delaying the inevitable.",
        "Jack: And you're delaying going down to lockup. Hanson. Bring him back down to his cell.",
        "Hanson: Yes, Sir.",
        "Craig: You can't hold me here indefinitely without charges, Jack.",
        "Jack: Careful what you wish for.",
        "Craig: Hold on, there, Officer Hanson. Looks like the cavalry just arrived.",
        "Jack: Parker, I want you to go outside and wait in the car, okay, Buddy? I need to talk to your mom.",
        "Carly: No, Parker, please stay where you are.",
        "Jack: I am not gonna let you use our son to save this lowlife.",
        "Carly: Our son is gonna do what you've always taught him to do, Jack. He's gonna tell the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Tell me the real reason you're living with Paul.",
        "Meg: Because.",
        "Dusty: Because you love him.",
        "Meg: That's right.",
        "Dusty: Then why are you here? Who did you come to see?",
        "Meg: No one.",
        "Dusty: You came to the Lakeview to see no one?",
        "Meg: I had an errand to run.",
        "Dusty: What errand?",
        "Meg: I need to get out of here.",
        "Dusty: Did you come to see me?",
        "Meg: To see you? There is nothing left for me with you. You have Lucy and Johnny and a life with them. And I am happy for you. Why can't you be happy for me?",
        "Dusty: I would be, if you were really happy.",
        "Meg: I am.",
        "[Meg sniffles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How did he do -- how does he do it? How does he talk you into these things?",
        "Carly: Nobody talked me into anything.",
        "Jack: And you fall for it every single time.",
        "Carly: You're investigating a crime. I just found out that Parker might have some information.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you just happened to find out?",
        "Craig: I called her. Since we're being honest.",
        "Jack: And you let him talk you into using our son as an alibi.",
        "Carly: Do you want the truth or don't you?",
        "Jack: Parker, come here for a second. [Jack sighs] On the afternoon of Friday, April 24th, where were you?",
        "Parker: That was the day that Liberty told me that she wanted an annulment. And I was freaking out. And that afternoon, I went over to Craig's place.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Parker: I was mad. And I figured Liberty left me mainly because of stuff that he did.",
        "Jack: And you're sure of the date?",
        "Carly: Oh, of course he is. So are you. It's the day that Craig gave him 50 grand and he went out and bought that stupid car.",
        "Jack: I'd rather hear it from Parker, if you don't mind.",
        "Carly: I don't mind.",
        "Jack: What time did you see Craig?",
        "Parker: Around 3:00, I guess.",
        "Jack: \"Around 3:00\"? You're not sure?",
        "Craig: Don't badger the boy.",
        "Jack: I can handle it from here, Craig.",
        "Craig: Sorry. Apologies. I'll just be over here.",
        "Jack: Is it possible that you saw Craig before 3:00?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Maybe.",
        "Jack: That gives Craig plenty of time to pay you off, then go down to the docks and take care of Mendoza.",
        "Carly: Or not.",
        "Jack: I've heard enough.",
        "Carly: Oh, so have I. Jack, you gotta stop this.",
        "Carly: Think about what you're doing, Jack.",
        "Jack: I'm investigating a murder, Carly.",
        "Carly: This investigation is turning into something else. It's much more about how you feel about Craig than it is about what really happened.",
        "Jack: What really happened is that guns were being smuggled in crates belonging to Craig's company.",
        "Carly: Well, it's my company, too. I didn't know anything about those guns. Do you believe that?",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Carly: Then why can't you believe that Craig didn't know anything about them, either?",
        "Craig: Boy, she makes a good point, doesn't she?",
        "Jack: And on the day that a dockworker was murdered, he just happened to give our son a check for $50,000?",
        "Craig: And you believe that? That I planned for Liberty to dump Parker that day? No offense. And then manipulated him to show up at my suite, out of the blue, to give me a convenient alibi.",
        "Jack: You were his trustee for months. You never gave him a cent. And that just happened to be the day that you suddenly decided to be generous?",
        "Carly: Wait a second. Are you saying that Craig called Parker and told him to show up at a specific time?",
        "Parker: He didn't. I'm not lying, Dad. I swear.",
        "Jack: No, I don't doubt that, Parker. I don't doubt that, just like I don't doubt that Craig manipulated this whole thing just so he'd have a cover story.",
        "Carly: Jack, think this through.",
        "Jack: I have, Carly. Have you? Parker, thank you. Thank you for coming down here, and thank you for being more than honest. I appreciate that, but I really think you need to go home now.",
        "Carly: It's all right, Sweetheart. You take the car. I'll get a cab.",
        "Craig: What's the problem, Jack? You know your son. You know he was telling the truth. How can you ignore a viable alibi?",
        "Carly: It could prove that Craig is innocent. Don't you agree, Jack?",
        "Jack: No, I don't. In fact, I believe, more than ever, that not only was he smuggling those guns, that he did, in fact, kill Cesar Mendoza.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: You just tried to use a 16-year-old to protect yourself, Craig. You're grasping at straws. It's pathetic, really. And it's making you look guiltier than ever.",

        "Lucy: Well, my father's always setting up things like that. He's always doing it when -- me and Bryant, when we were little kids. He'd get us into the projection room at the movie or into the observation tower at the airport.",
        "Dusty: You're doing the right thing, Lucy.",
        "Lucy: I'm letting my father sit in jail for something he didn't do. And I put him there.",
        "Dusty: You were smuggling medicine, not guns.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, but it was my fault that the guns were there. It's my fault that Cesar was murdered.",

        "Jack: I'm not twisting anything. Craig set this whole thing up. How can you think he didn't?",
        "Carly: It's sloppy. There was too much left to chance. That's not Craig, and you know it.",
        "Jack: Maybe he finally made some mistakes, Carly.",

        "Carly: Oh, so it wasn't planned then? It just sort of happened?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Carly: Well, then why didn't Craig toss the guns and the body into the bay? Why did he leave all that evidence out there in the open?",
        "Jack: I'm thinking he was interrupted. What the hell is going on here? Since this is your defense, that Craig is too careful of a criminal to leave evidence behind? This is the guy you allow into your home, around our children?",

        "Carly: Not this time. He didn't do this, Jack. Don't lose sight of who you are because you're mad at him or 'cause you're mad at me. Keep looking for the truth.",

        "Carly: It's okay. Apology accepted. Tell me how I can help you.",
        "Craig: You still believe me. That's a lot right there.",
        "Carly: Well, as far as Jack is concerned, that's probably a mark against you. Do you still think Dusty set you up?",

        "Dusty: What's going on with you?",
