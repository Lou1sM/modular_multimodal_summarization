        "Paul: Hey. Wake up. Hey, sleeping beauty. Can I be your prince charming?",
        "Meg: You're no prince.",
        "Paul: Am I charming? [Meg groans] God!",
        "Meg: Close.",
        "Paul: So how'd I get so lucky, huh? How come you let me in your bed?",
        "Meg: Cause you, Mr. Ryan, are very, very sexy. And I love you.",
        "Paul: I love you.",
        "Meg: You and me here, it's a fairy tale.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm.",
        "Paul: How come?",
        "Meg: Because fairy tales are too good to be true. And you and me here -- well, I never thought we'd get here.",
        "Paul: So how's this fairy tale end? Do we ride off on a golden carriage?",
        "Meg: As long as the carriage is equipped with a big bed, I'm happy.",
        "Paul: See, I like the way you think.",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: I'm happy, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You're here.",
        "Dusty: Hal called me. He said you wanted to see me.",
        "Emily: I've had a lot of time to think about what I did to you.",
        "Dusty: And?",
        "Emily: I know it doesn't make anything better, but I have to say it. I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: Okay. Want to know why I'm here?",
        "Emily: I thought --",
        "Dusty: You thought I'd come 'cause I'm well trained? 'Cause you whistled?",
        "Emily: I never should have --",
        "Dusty: Should've what? Chain me up like a dog for weeks, threatening to shoot me? No food, no water.",
        "Emily: Dusty, I did things -- I did things to you that I never even would have even thought about doing.",
        "Dusty: You took me away from my family. If you were me right now and nobody was looking, what would you do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Nurse, did you ask the doctor about the entry in my ex-wife's chart?",
        "Nurse: Yes, Lieutenant, but patient information is confidential.",
        "Hal: The patient has been charged with kidnapping. That makes her my prisoner and makes me privy to any and all health information to determine how soon I get her out of this hospital and into a cell. Now, if I need a search warrant and a judge to get a straight answer, I will. Or you can save us both a lot of trouble and just tell me. I need to know if what is written in the prisoner's chart is true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Oh! Did you girls have a good time?",
        "Faith: We got new dolls. Can we go show Mommy?",
        "Holden: Sure. But if Mommy's resting, be quiet, okay?",
        "Faith: Okay.",
        "Emma: Go slowly.",
        "Holden: What is this?",
        "Emma: Here you go. This is some home cooking here so you won't have to order out for pizza.",
        "Holden: I guess the girls told you about that, huh?",
        "Emma: Yes, they did. They did. You know you can ask me to cook for you any time.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but Mama, you've had so much going on with Meg and Jack moving in.",
        "Emma: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- I always have time for my boy. So how's Lily doing?",
        "Holden: Well, she's fine, as long as Jade isn't around.",
        "Emma: Holden, why don't you just tell that girl to leave?",
        "Holden: Because -- because Luke is in love with her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I can't deal with this anymore. I'm gonna tell my parents that I'm gay.",
        "Jade: When?",
        "Luke: Today.",
        "Jade: Why now? Is this about your mom?",
        "Luke: Do you know what she said to me after she caught us arguing? She told me that she wanted me to be happy, no matter what that means.",
        "Jade: So, it's all good. We keep doing this boyfriend-girlfriend thing. It's fine.",
        "Luke: No, Jade, it's fake. I spent a whole year trying to get my mom and dad back together because I knew how much they loved each other. And that's the same love they have for me. So for me to hide who I am, it's wrong. It doesn't give them any credit. And how do I know that they won't understand if I don't give them a chance? I mean, I'm the one that's all hung up about being gay. I think that if I'm just honest with them, maybe they'll be okay.",
        "Jade: Well, I hope so, but -- how can you be sure?",
        "Luke: Jade, I'm doing this.",
        "Jade: Even though the moment you tell your mom, she's gonna throw me out?",
        "Luke: That is not my problem anymore, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Oh, Nick, great. Please, fix this, will ya?",
        "Nick: You made a mess of this, man. What, you couldn't find a mirror anywhere?",
        "Mike: No, man, I was afraid I'd run into Katie, and she'd blow a gasket.",
        "Nick: Yeah, a blown gasket's not a good look for a bride.",
        "Mike: Wait, what time is it?",
        "Nick: Ooh, you really are nervous, aren't ya?",
        "Mike: A little.",
        "Nick: What, about the wedding?",
        "Mike: Yeah, what else?",
        "Nick: Skeleton in the wall. I mean, Jack Snyder's been asking a lot of questions --",
        "Mike: I told Jack everything I knew, all right? He believed me.",
        "Nick: And you're sure about that?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Nick: All right, no worries, no worries -- except how long you gotta kiss your bride, all right?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",

        "Carly: You don't look happy. Is something wrong?",
        "Jack: There's just some new information about one of my cases. You ready to go?",
        "Carly: Well, why would a uniform come to talk to you here? It's about the skeleton, isn't it?",
        "Jack: Carly, if I get into this now, we're gonna be late for Mike and Katie's wedding.",
        "Carly: All right then, then we'll be late.",
        "Jack: Carly, come on. We really don't have time for this.",
        "Carly: If you found out something about a murder that took place in my home, then I have a right to know about it!",
        "Jack: Right now?! The murder happened more than a decade ago, Carly. You're just gonna get scared all over again.",
        "Carly: And so what I don't know won't scare me, is that it?",
        "Jack: Every time we talk about that skeleton, you get spooked.",
        "Carly: I wonder why.",
        "Jack: And I really don't need a phone call in the middle of the night to come over here and hold your hand.",
        "Carly: Well, if we still shared a bed, I wouldn't be scared in the middle of the night, Jack. I could just roll over and touch you and know that everything was okay.",
        "Jack: Do we have to do this right now?",
        "Carly: Yes! Because you decided you can't live with me anymore, I am charge of making sure this house is safe for me and the children. And if you know something about a person who died here, you damn well better tell me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Okay -- church, check. Dress, check. Flowers, check.",
        "Nancy: Cake?",
        "Katie: Check.",
        "Margo: You got the food and the champagne for the reception?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Oh, where's Tom? He's supposed to get the disposable cameras for the reception.",
        "Margo: Check! Would you please stop worrying. The only thing you have to do now is walk down that isle, and when the minister says, \"Do you take this man to be your\" --",
        "Katie: Oh, my God, that's it.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Katie: No, no, not what, who. I forgot the minister.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: We don't have a suspect yet, but we do have a new lead.",
        "Carly: Like what kind of lead? Like a witness?",
        "Jack: I am not gonna get into specifics with you. But we found something that might tell us who Maya Gold was with the last day of her life.",
        "Carly: Well, then you'll know who killed her and who buried her in -- in my basement. And if that person comes back here --",
        "Jack: Carly, they are not gonna come here. They are not gonna hurt you or the kids.",
        "Carly: That's it?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Thanks. So, I guess I'll see you at the church.",
        "Jack: Whoa, whoa, wait a second. Wait a second. I don't want you to be mad, okay? We were doing -- we were doing really well. And for a second there, I thought that we might get through a whole day without fighting about why we broke up.",
        "Carly: That's not what this was about, Jack. I just wanted to know --",
        "Jack: Oh, no? What was that dig about not being able to turn to me in the middle of the night? What was that?",
        "Carly: The truth.",
        "Jack: When you talk like that, Carly, about me not being here, it eats me up.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I don't want a fight either. But here we are, we're getting all dressed up at our home to go to a wedding, and we're not even going in the same car. It's like we're husband and wife, but not. Don't you miss us?",
        "Jack: Of course I do. I just think we ought to keep things civil.",
        "Carly: Civil. Like we've never seen each other naked? Like you don't know what I've got on under this dress? Like I don't know how you would take it all off?",
        "Jack: Carly, behave.",
        "Carly: Okay. Okay, well, then, I'll -- I'll see you at the church. Lock up for me, will ya, Snyder? Caught you looking, pal.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I see through you, Emily. Your tears, your apologies, it's all just part of your plan.",
        "Emily: Do I look like I got a plan?",
        "Dusty: You better, 'cause you're going on trial for attempted murder and kidnapping, and you're talking to the one guy who you know you gotta gain sympathy from, 'cause I'm the one guy who could put you in jail for the rest of your life.",
        "Emily: That's not why I asked you here.",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: Just so we're clear, I want you in prison, 'cause I can't get what I want from you if you're dead.",
        "Emily: What do you want?",
        "Dusty: Payback.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: So you think that if -- if Jade leaves that Luke will --",
        "Holden: Yes, that Luke will leave with her.",
        "Emma: Oh, I don't know, Holden. I really don't see that happening, I really don't. I mean, his mom is pregnant, she's not feeling well. You knowing how he loves his mama. I mean, I don't think he's about to leave.",
        "Holden: Normally, that would make perfect sense. But when it's Lily versus Jade, perfect sense goes right out the window.",
        "Emma: Holden, well, you know, he's a minor. Now, come on. Just lay down the law.",
        "Holden: I tried that. I tried it with his friend, Kevin.",
        "Emma: I'm glad you did. I mean, they were drinking together.",
        "Holden: Yeah, but I did it the wrong way. I ordered the kid out of his life. I don't want to do that with Jade. What if Luke gets sick again?",
        "Emma: Look, what would happen if you just had a talk with him? I mean, not just in passing, but a real conversation?",
        "Holden: Mama, there hasn't been time. Lily was in the hospital. Luke's been catching up on homework ever since he's been sick. And that's why I asked Jade to help out with the girls.",
        "Emma: Holden, talk to your son. Don't assume that this girl is the love of his life. He may surprise you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Luke, wait!",
        "Luke: Jade, I have got to do this -- right now.",
        "Jade: I'm not trying to stop you. I just -- I need some time.",
        "Luke: For what?",
        "Jade: To pack, and to get my stuff together. I just -- I can't see Holden. I don't want to see your mom. I don't want to see Faith or Natalie. I just -- I couldn't take it.",
        "Luke: Well, how much time do you want?",
        "Jade: One day. That's all I'm asking.",
        "Luke: No, Jade, you have one hour.",
        "Jade: Luke --",
        "Luke: Jade, I've got to do this right now before I -- look, just take care of yourself, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: What am I gonna do?",
        "Margo: You're gonna talk to Mike, 'cause maybe he knows somebody.",
        "Katie: He can't see me like this.",
        "Margo: Honey, do you want to get married or not?!",
        "Nancy: Eureka!",
        "Margo: All right, Gram, here we go. Man your phone, okay? Go. Talk to Mike.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Nick: Hey, did Jack say he had any new leads or anything?",
        "Mike: No. Why didn't I wear a watch? What time is it?",
        "Katie: Mike? Ooh, turn around. There's a problem.",
        "Mike: What is it?",
        "Katie: I forgot to hire a minister to perform the ceremony.",
        "Mike/Nick: What?",
        "Katie: Well, turn around. Do you want more bad luck? It kind of slipped through the cracks.",
        "Mike: Okay, okay. Um -- what should we do?",
        "Katie: Well, unless you happen to know a preacher who can marry us, we're sunk.",
        "Henry: Never fear, Coleman is here. I'll perform the ceremony.",
        "Katie: Um, you're not a minister.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I am, actually. I just got ordained over the internet.",
        "Katie/Mike: Is that legal?",
        "Henry: Uh-huh, yeah. I can perform funerals and christenings, revivals. This will be my very first wedding. Isn't that just so special?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Think. [Jade sighs] Hi, it's me. I -- could you come over? Yeah, I'll tell you when you get here. Please hurry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry about what I said before.",
        "Carly: You said a lot of things.",
        "Jack: I know that when you talk about the way things were, you're just being honest. But it hurts to remember what we had.",
        "Carly: And you may want to forget it all, Jack, but I don't. It was the very best part of my life, just like this will be for Mike and Katie.",
        "Jack: They'll have problems, too. Everybody does.",
        "Carly: And this will help them get through them. When it gets rough, they'll look back on this day -- the music, the flowers, their vows -- and they'll remember the one perfect moment when it was about nothing but what they felt for each other.",
        "Jack: Carly, I don't want to knock heads with you. So for my sake, for the kids' sake, can we please just --?",
        "Carly: Keep things civil? Sure, Jack. Whatever you want.",
        "Nick: Hey, Carly. Jack. Bride's side or groom's side?",
        "Katie: El Segundo Church of the Purple Haze? That's who ordained you?",
        "Henry: Well, it's a small congregation, but we're growing.",
        "Katie: You, a minister?",
        "Henry: Many are called, Katie, but few pay the $179.95. Give me this.",
        "Katie: What's going on here?",
        "Henry: Well --",
        "Katie: Wait, no. Let me guess. You came into a pile of money, and this is your way of evading taxes.",
        "Henry: Bubbles! Bubbles, no, I -- if I had a pile of money, would I be wasting my time in this penny-ante town? No, I'd be in Monte Carlo, playing blackjack with the Sultan of Brunei.",
        "Katie: You really want to do this?",
        "Henry: As your ex-husband, I think that you, Katie Peretti, deserve the best things in life. And yeah, I'd be honored to preside while you got everything you deserved and married the right guy this time.",
        "Katie: Thank you, Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Jade?",
        "Jade: I didn't know who else to call.",
        "Holden: Why, what happened? Are you sick?",
        "Jade: No. It's Luke and me.",
        "Holden: Jade, we already talked about this. What happens between you and Luke, that's your business. I can't tell him what to do.",
        "Jade: And you won't have to. It's all over. He broke up with me.",
        "Holden: When did this happen?",
        "Jade: A little while ago. Luke said we weren't even friends.",
        "Holden: Well, why did he break up with you? Did he give you a reason?",
        "Jade: Luke will explain it all to you. I'm sure he can't wait to tell Lily. The second that he does, she won't waste a minute throwing me out.",
        "Holden: I'm afraid you're right about that.",
        "Jade: Unless -- you could stop her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: If I could make things right, I would.",
        "Dusty: You want to make things right? You want to show me how sorry you are?",
        "Emily: Yes. Yes, I'm gonna take full responsibility. I'm making a full confession to the police.",
        "Dusty: You're gonna do a lot better than that. You're gonna go to the trial, get on the stand and tell the jury how Paul used you, manipulated you into doing his dirty work.",
        "Emily: You want me to testify against Paul?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. And if justice prevails, he'll be going to prison right alongside of you. That should make you happy, no? How about it? Do it, and I'll go easy on you when I testify. You'll still go to prison, but Paul will spend a lot more time there, believe me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Do you want to leave town?",
        "Meg: Do you?",
        "Paul: Uh -- you're important to me, and if staying here means losing you --",
        "Meg: Okay. Then we'll go. I'll be packed in ten minutes.",
        "Paul: Hold -- hold on a second. I didn't mean, like, right this minute.",
        "Meg: Why not?",
        "Paul: Well, there's -- you know, there's Emily's trial.",
        "Meg: Which will still go on.",
        "Paul: I'm sure Hal wants to file some charges against me or something.",
        "Meg: So we'll leave before he has a chance to.",
        "Paul: I'd really like to make things right with my sister.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I want to hang out with Holden, and my nieces and nephew. And you could spend some time with Will. See, that's another thing we have in common. We love our families. So, you know what? I'll make you a deal.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Meg: We'll stay here, not run, and show everybody that we were meant for each other.",
        "Paul: Why don't you just show me?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Meg: I think you should get that in case it's about Emily.",
        "Paul: Hello?",
        "Hal: Paul, it's me. I need you to get down to the hospital right away.",
        "Paul: Why? Did something happen with Emily?",
        "Hal: I'm not sure. Just get here as soon as you can.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Henry: If there's anyone stupid enough here who thinks there's any reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.",
        "Paul: This is Emily's chart. How'd you get this?",
        "Hal: Read it!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: That's the only reason? I thought that --",
        "Holden: You thought what?",
        "Jade: I thought that you started to like me, at least a little. But why should you? After I tricked you guys, pretending to be Rose's daughter --",
        "Holden: It's not personal.",
        "Jade: Yes, it is. I just want you to know, Holden, that I'm really gonna miss you. You've given me so much.",
        "Holden: I gave you a few bucks to tide you over.",
        "Jade: No, it's so much more than that. You made me feel safe. That's what you do. You make people feel like nothing in the world can hurt them as long as you're around. I've never felt that way, not once in my whole life, until I met you. You're the reason I don't want to go.",

        "Faith: Shh. Mommy's taking a nap.",
        "Luke: Oh. Well, where's Natalie?",
        "Faith: Sleeping in Mommy's room. Daddy's not here yet, but he'll be back soon. Want to play a game with me?",
        "Luke: Not now, sorry. What?",
        "Faith: You look sick.",
        "Luke: No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just -- I need to tell Mom and Dad something.",
        "Faith: Did you do something bad?",
        "Luke: No. No, I thought it was bad, but it's not.",
        "Faith: You can tell me.",
        "Luke: I know. That's why you're one of my favorite sisters.",
        "Faith: You always say that. Are you scared to tell Mommy and Daddy?",
        "Luke: Kind of.",
        "Faith: Its okay, Luke. They'll always love you.",

        "Emily: I need to stand up and own what I did, and I can't do that if I blame somebody else.",
        "Dusty: What is it about this guy -- to you?",
        "Emily: No. Dusty, no, it was me -- just me. And I know I could go to prison for a very long time --",
        "Dusty: Federal prison for kidnapping. Now if I tone down some of the things you did, maybe you can get a reduced sentence, be out by the time your kid goes to high school. I don't know.",
        "Emily: Or I could go to prison for the rest of my life. I know that. I can miss everything -- Danny's graduations, learning to drive, getting married, having babies of his own. And believe me, I get the irony. It's what I did to Jennifer. And now, it's payback time. But I'm the one who should get payback, nobody else.",
        "Dusty: If you put away Paul Ryan, it will give your son good reason to respect you someday.",

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the presence of God and this company to join this man, Michael Kasnoff, and this woman, Katie Peretti, in the bonds of holy matrimony, which is commended to be honorable, and therefore, is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently, discreetly --",

        "Jack: It's still circumstantial. I can't get an arrest warrant with that.",

        "Meg: No, we have no definite plans, yet.",

        "Mike: Um -- there's so much I want to say. And if this was a normal wedding, I would have been working on my vows for weeks. But given the lead time to this ceremony, we're talking a few hours, so hopefully my words can do justice for what's in my heart. I don't know why I'm worried. I mean, if I need an inspiration, all I need to do is look in your eyes. 'Cause what I see there goes beyond what everybody else sees. It goes beyond the kind of beauty that I've dreamt about my whole life. What I see is a courage and a strength -- and a stubbornness that's gotten me through some tough times. You don't give up, Katie. You don't know how. That is only one reason that I will love you until the day that I die. Only you could wake me up at 3:00 in the morning and make me laugh. You are my light in the darkness, and you are my most loyal friend. And you will always and forever be my snow angel.",
        "Katie: That was a magical night, wasn't it? But I think I fell in love with you long before that. I think I probably fell in love with you the day that my roof started leaking, and you came over to fix it. And I was panicking, and I didn't have any money, and you didn't care. I said that I would pay you by cooking for you, and you just said, \"sure.\" I mean, for all you knew, I couldn't boil water, but you were just so kind and calm and comforting, and gorgeous. But you made me feel safe. You saved me. You made me feel like everything was gonna be okay. 'Cause that's what you do, Mike -- you fix things. You make people feel like everything's gonna be okay. And I want to do that for you, too. So let's make a pact, okay? We'll do that for each other for the rest of our lives.",
        "Henry: Wow. If that's what you got off the top of your heads, I can just imagine what you would have said if you had time to prepare. Mike, as someone who has stood in your position before, let me just say --",
        "Mike: Henry, Henry, we got the church for an hour. That's it.",
        "Henry: Right. Right. So let's just move this sucker along. Break out the rings here.",
