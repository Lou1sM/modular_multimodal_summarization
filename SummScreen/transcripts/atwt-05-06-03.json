        "Carly tries to convince Rosanna to help her with the fashion show. Carly shows her phone records from Monte Carlo proving that she hadn't called Craig. Carly tells Rosanna that she would burn Craig's clothes if he had put her in the same position. Later, while Rosanna's trying to strike a match to a pile of Craig's suits and ties, he offers her a light. John shows Bob evidence that it was not his fault that the patient died. Bob still doesn't understand how he overdosed the man. Evelyn told Jack that if he didn't bring in Henry for questioning, he would be off of the case. Jack informed Katie to warn Henry to get out of town. After Rose told Mitzi that she didn't want the shop, Dusty called to have her come to the shop to discuss business. Rose was reluctant to show up, but when she did, she fell in love with the place."

        "Susan: Ali, I'm afraid I've got bad news.",
        "Alison: Don't tell me that. No bad news. Not today.",
        "Susan: Sweetie, I tried to reschedule my appointments, but I'm afraid at the last minute like this, it's impossible. I have to go in.",
        "Alison: But, I thought that we were going --",
        "Susan: I know. There's nothing I can do, baby. But that doesn't have to put the brakes on your fun. Here are the car keys. Here is the platinum card! Don't go crazy, okay?",
        "Alison: Oh, you're the best!",
        "Susan: I can trust you, right? Oh, sweetie. I'm just so happy to have my little girl home.",
        "Alison: Thanks. And not just for the card and the keys, but -- but for everything. You don't know how much it meant to me that everybody cared.",
        "Susan: I know. I know. [Doorbell rings] what a surprise!",
        "Rick: Do you think you can stand another one?",
        "Susan: Come in. Come in.",
        "Rick: Good morning, Alison.",
        "Alison: It was.",
        "Susan: Look who's here! Come on in, Rick.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Well, I thought that since this is my first day at Memorial and your first day back home, that we'd go out and celebrate. So I made breakfast reservations for three at the Lakeview. Now all I need is two beautiful companions.",
        "Susan: Isn't that thoughtful?",
        "Alison: Sorry, but I'm about to go to the mall.",
        "Susan: But wouldn't it be fun if we could all have breakfast together before?",
        "Alison: But I thought that you just said that you couldn't change around your schedule to go shopping with me.",
        "Susan: Breakfast takes an hour. And shopping with you, although I rank it up there among life's most fascinating adventures, is an all-day affair.",
        "Alison: Speaking of affairs.",
        "Susan: Come on, Ali. I want to celebrate your homecoming and Rick's big day.",
        "Alison: Thanks anyway, but I better get started. I'd rather starve.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Coffee -- black, please.",
        "Bartender: Long night last night?",
        "Dusty: Oh, like you wouldn't believe. Big project of mine just kicked into high gear. And now it's time to spread the news.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Mitzi: Am I the only one who hears the phone around here? I don't even know why I bother answering it because it's always for you.",
        "Rose: Just let it ring.",
        "Mitzi: Hello?",
        "Dusty: Mitzi? Hey, it's Dusty. Is Rose around?",
        "Mitzi: Uh, hi, Dusty. Actually, Rose is not --",
        "Rose: Dusty, I can't talk to you right now.",
        "Dusty: Is Paul over there?",
        "Rose: No. And no offense, I really don't want to talk to anybody today. So I'll call you later.",
        "Dusty: Rose, wait! Wait, wait. There's just something you gotta see.",
        "Rose: Whatever it is, I'll see it later. I'll call you later.",
        "Mitzi: So what gives?",
        "Rose: Nothing.",
        "Mitzi: Right. You know, the way you yanked that phone outta my hand, didn't seem like nothing. Seemed like something. Does the weird way you're acting have anything to do with the weird conversation I had with Paul last night?",
        "Rose: You had a conversation with Paul? What was weird about it?",
        "Mitzi: Well, I ran into him, and he was asking about you and Dusty. I'm not exactly sure what he was after, but it seemed like he was trying to figure out if there was anything between you and Dusty besides business. And judging from the way that you're acting, I would say it seems like monkey business.",
        "Rose: Hey -- you wanna be my friend? Wanna have my back? You know the pressure I'm under? Don't ask me any questions. Don't worry about the fight. Just help me win the fight.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Paul: Rose! Rose, open up! We need to talk right now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: If you'll read over the list, you will see Carly Tenney Snyder, Emily Stewart, Rose D'Angelo, Craig Montgomery -- it's obvious why Detective Snyder is dragging his feet. This isn't just a list of the suspects in my kidnapping case, it's a list of his closest friends and relatives.",
        "Evelyn: Well, perhaps Detective Snyder has too much of a conflict of interest to lead a thorough and an objective investigation of this kidnapping.",
        "Barbara: Which is why I'm asking you to reassign the case.",
        "Evelyn: Maybe what I should do is have it investigated by a completely different department.",
        "Jack: Internal Affairs? You're talking about getting IAB in on this? Well, you go right ahead, Evelyn. But until then, I'm handling this case.",
        "Barbara: You are not handling this case --",
        "Jack: Stop telling me how to do my job!",
        "Barbara: Somebody has to, Jack.",
        "Evelyn: Look, bring in Henry Coleman. Tell him we'll cut him a deal if he names names. Then put an APB out on Craig Montgomery. And I want you to bring in for questioning Rose D'Angelo, Carly Tenney Snyder, and Emily Stewart. Today, detective. I'll be waiting.",
        "Barbara: So will I.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I came to -- to show you this.",
        "Rosanna: What? What is this? This is a list of calls made from Monte Carlo over the past few days. And as you can see, there are no calls made from there to Craig's cell phone. And I also got one of the guys at the station to do me a favor. The last page is a list of the calls made from my cell phone.",
        "Rosanna: Well, good for you. Would you like a big gold star by your name?",
        "Carly: I'd like to bury the hatchet. We gotta do the nearly impossible here. I can't do it without you. You won't do it without me. We -- we have a fashion show in less than a week.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, no, I'm sorry. We had a fashion show. The minute Craig returns, he will be arrested and thrown in jail and that, as they say, will be that.",
        "Rosanna: The \"Monte\" will be gone from Monte Carlo.",
        "Carly: Well, then I guess that just leaves you and me then, doesn't it? So ditch the dirt and let's get to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey. We got a problem. Barbara doesn't like the way I'm handling her kidnapping investigation.",
        "Hal: Oh, boy.",
        "Jack: Yeah, so she's gone straight over our heads to the D.A. Now Evelyn's making noise about reassignment if I don't go after Henry Coleman like a rabid dog. Even talking about cutting him a deal if he gives up names like Emily, Rose and Craig.",
        "Hal: Just when we thought things were gonna blow over.",
        "Jack: I could wring Coleman's neck for opening his mouth. A confession? To Barbara? Now they can get Carly for conspiracy after the fact, Hal.",
        "Hal: We're in this way too deep to let Henry Coleman bring this down.",
        "Jack: Oh, right. So what do we do now?",
        "Hal: Simple. [Hal sighs] we do our jobs. We have to protect the women in our lives.",
        "Jack: We can't lose control of this investigation.",
        "Hal: You know, it sounds to me that without a statement from Henry Coleman, there really is no investigation. Just speculation.",
        "Jack: Right. Things happen all the time. It's unavoidable.",
        "Hal: Part of life.",
        "Jack: For instance, I can think of a half dozen reasons why Henry would never come down here to give us a statement.",
        "Hal: Well, whatever happens to that guy, I sure hope it happens fast.",
        "Jack: I'll check you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Katie!",
        "Katie: Alison? Hey! What are you doing here? You got out?",
        "Alison: Last night. Can you believe it?",
        "Katie: That's great. You gotta tell me how that happened.",
        "Alison: We'll talk about it over brunch.",
        "Katie: Oh, actually, I don't have time right now. I gotta get to work.",
        "Alison: Work?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I work at Memorial now. I was talking to Lucy and I'm gonna be late.",
        "Alison: Lucy's here?",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah. And Aaron. You okay with that?",
        "Alison: Maybe I should just go to Java until I figure that out.",
        "Katie: No, you know what -- it's a small town. You're going to run into them sooner or later.",
        "Alison: I guess.",
        "Katie: It'll be fine. Good luck.",
        "Alison: Thanks. I'll call you. Lucy! You can walk!",
        "Lucy: Alison, you escaped from prison!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Hello, hello, hello, hello. How are you?",
        "Kim: John, hi. I'm fine. How are you. Bob's secretary called. It seems he forgot his appointment book and she's afraid she's gonna double book him. Sometimes I have the feeling he'd forget his head if it weren't attached.",
        "John: Well, I'm sure he has a lot on his mind.",
        "Kim: I know. You're right. He was so upset when he came home last night.",
        "John: Losing a patient is never very easy. And under these circumstances I'm sure it's almost worse.",
        "Kim: These circumstances --",
        "John: That's why we're waiting for the autopsy report. I'm sure it will show that Bob was not at fault and everything will just snap back to normal.",
        "Kim: Something happened to one of Bob's patients and they think he's to blame?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I'll have the sunrise special, wheat toast and O.J.",
        "Barbara: You must have gotten to Rose before Paul did if you can afford the time to sit around feeding your face.",
        "Dusty: Ladies first. Have a seat. What happened between you and Detective Snyder?",
        "Barbara: Oh, don't you worry about officer Jack. He's gonna be a very busy boy for a while.",
        "Dusty: Good. 'Cause I don't like cops around my affairs -- business or personal.",
        "Barbara: Is there another personal affair I should know about?",
        "Dusty: You will. And it's only a matter of time now.",
        "Barbara: Well, then I guess breakfast is on me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: Hi. Come on in.",
        "Mitzi: Hi ya, Paul.",
        "Paul: Hi, Mitzi. You mind if we can get some privacy here?",
        "Mitzi: You bet. Hey, you kids have fun.",
        "Rose: You look mad. And I know why. I mean, I had to kick you out of here last night like that.",
        "Paul: I'm sure you were pretty tired after getting Dusty's spin on everything.",
        "Rose: I kicked him out, too. You saw it. I got him out first.",
        "Paul: Yeah. You threw us both out. Except the thing is, I'm your fianc\u00e9. I thought I might get some special consideration.",
        "Rose: It was a rough night, all right? Finding out my business partner was doing business with Barbara? Even though it was only a short-term thing, but still --",
        "Paul: Short-term? Rose, they've been in business together from the beginning!",
        "Rose: What? No. Barbara's money went into the account first. It had nothing to do with our business.",
        "Paul: Wait, wait. You're still planning on doing business with this guy after everything you just found out?",
        "Rose: Yeah. Why not?",
        "Paul: You refused money from Lily, from Lucinda, from me -- and yet, you're still gonna do business with a man who took money from a woman you despise? Who despises you? What are you thinking, Rose?",
        "Rose: I don't know! I don't know, okay? But whatever decision I make, it's gonna be from me! Not from you, not from Lucinda, not form Lily, not from Dusty. It's gonna be me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Yesterday, Bob made an error with one of his patient's meds. It could be a potentially fatal error.",
        "Kim: No!",
        "John: Bob prescribed 40 milligrams when he really meant 10. And of course, the nurse followed his written instructions. I don't know if what happened next could be related or not, but the patient went into cardiac arrest and we lost him.",
        "Kim: You think that the mix-up in dosage is responsible for death? I mean, John, that's what you're saying, isn't it?",
        "John: Look, we don't know if it is or not. Nothing is definite yet, so they're waiting on that report.",
        "Kim: Well, is there any way to speed that up?",
        "John: That's what I was just going to do. Try not to worry. All right?",
        "Rick: Hello, Kim.",
        "Kim: Oh, Rick. Hi. How are you doing? Oh, wait a minute. This is your first day here, isn't it?",
        "Rick: Yeah. Well, so far, so good.",
        "Kim: Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. Oh, wait a minute. Chris?",
        "Chris: Yeah. Hey, mom.",
        "Kim: Honey, I'd like you to meet Dr. Eric Decker. My son, Christopher Hughes.",
        "Rick: Please, call me Rick.",
        "Kim: He's new on staff here.",
        "Chris: I've heard a lot about you.",
        "Rick: Have you?",
        "Chris: I've studied your research. And I had a chance to catch you at a conference on aging a couple years ago.",
        "Rick: Ah. So you were the one!",
        "Chris: Actually, it changed my life. It helped me decide to specialize in pediatrics.",
        "Rick: Well, it's too bad that Oprah wasn't in the audience. I'd have my own talk show by now.",
        "Bob: Laughter in the halls? What's going on here?",
        "Rick: Hello, Bob. I think I've -- well, I think I've met the entire Hughes family.",
        "Bob: Oh, that's impossible. The woods are full of Hughes.",
        "Chris: Rick, we should grab lunch sometime.",
        "Rick: Yeah, that sounds good.",
        "Chris: Okay, I'd better get going. I don't want to be late for rounds.",
        "Rick: Thanks for reminding me.",
        "Chris: Good meeting you.",
        "Rick: Yeah, see ya. Excuse me.",
        "Bob: Mm-hmm. Uh-oh. What did I do now?",
        "Kim: I just heard about the patient who died yesterday. Why didn't you tell me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Before you guys call the cops, I didn't escape. They let me go. My sentence was reduced and they released me. I'm sorry to disappoint you.",
        "Lucy: No! I was just surprised to see you. That's all.",
        "Aaron: You want to sit down a minute?",
        "Alison: If that's okay with Lucy.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Sure. Sit.",
        "Alison: Well, it was really good to see you walking around again.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. All it just took was a little physical therapy -- a lot of Aaron.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm really happy for you. So how's your memory?",
        "Lucy: It's coming back. Little by little.",
        "Aaron: So when did they let you out?",
        "Alison: Last night.",
        "Lucy: What happened to your hand?",
        "Alison: It was cut. I was kind of involved in this stabbing thing.",
        "Aaron: A stabbing thing?",
        "Alison: I was the victim. I wasn't the one with the knife, don't freak. I'm okay now.",
        "Aaron: Good. Good.",
        "Alison: Well, I'll just let you guys go back to whatever you were doing. I just come for the fries.",
        "Lucy: We're really glad to have you home.",
        "Aaron: Good to have you home, Ali.",
        "Alison: Thanks. And -- I just wanted to say that I really am sorry for everything that I did and everything that I caused. I -- I'm really glad that you guys are together.",
        "Lucy: Are you?",
        "Alison: Yes, I swear. And I've more than learned my lesson. You don't have to worry about me anymore.",
        "Aaron: Take it easy, Alison.",
        "Alison: Hi. Can I have three large fries to go?",
        "Waitress: You know what? I'm sorry. The fryer's on the fritz. Can I get you something else, though?",
        "Alison: Do you have friends on the menu? Never mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Would you say something please?",
        "Rosanna: The only reason you want me to help you is to save your sorry spreading behind.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, we all have a lot at stake in the success of Monte Carlo. Especially you. You're the one who's holding the purse strings.",
        "Rosanna: And I don't care if I lose every penny. Who needs a fashion business? Craig and I certainly don't. He can find other things to occupy his time. And I certainly will be happy to occupy his other needs. You will land on your feet. You always do. Hopefully this time, it'll be a little further away from Craig.",
        "Carly: Don't you ever get tired of whining about the past? I'm gonna say this one more time. Craig and I had a very brief affair a very long time ago. It happened, it ended. And you're being jealous about absolutely nothing. The only connection remaining between Craig and myself is business, strictly business.",
        "Rosanna: Strictly business. That's why he plans and he schemes for you? That's why he's willing to break federal laws for you? That's why he ignores his obligations to his family and his friends whenever you get a hangnail.",
        "Carly: Okay, fine, Rosanna. You got me. Sometimes, somehow, we managed to be friends, too.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, friends. He's not your friend. He's obsessed with you. I would do anything for that man. I would give that man the world. But he doesn't want me. He just wants you. And I just want you gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So how long before you move in for the kill, so to speak?",
        "Dusty: Sooner than you think. So call your bank and tell them to prepare for a big withdrawal. I want cash. And I want it paid in full.",
        "Barbara: I never realized you had such a one-track mind.",
        "Dusty: It's all about the money.",
        "Barbara: You'll get your money.",
        "Dusty: Good, 'cause I want to wrap this up as soon as possible.",
        "Barbara: No more guilty pangs about my son?",
        "Dusty: Paul is not my friend anymore. There's nothing I can do about that right now.",
        "Barbara: He'll survive. And he'll be better for it. Now, I believe that this will take care of your breakfast.",
        "Dusty: I hope you're on your way to your bank.",
        "Barbara: I hope you can live up to your promises.",
        "Dusty: So do I. Come on, Rose. Call me back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I try to keep you from getting hurt, and you think I'm trying to take over your life. I love you, Rose. What is it going to take for you to believe that?",
        "Rose: Maybe I want to feel that no matter what happens, you'll always choose me. Without me having to ask you to do it.",
        "Paul: Look at that ring on your finger and say that again. Okay. I do feel a certain responsibility to my mother. But I have always chosen you. I have always defended you. Every single time!",
        "Rose: Oh, come on! Even Dusty says that you don't stand up to you mom!",
        "Paul: Because Dusty's got an agenda! He's a liar, Rose! Can't you see that --",
        "Rose: Maybe he's the only objective voice in all of this noise!",
        "Paul: Oh, okay. You want to hear an objective voice? Listen to this!",
        "Rose: What is it?",
        "Paul: It's a tape of messages left on my mother's voice mail.",
        "Rose: Come on! That could mean anything! Anyone with a computer can make up messages.",
        "[Answering machine tape]",
        "Dusty: Barbara, it's Dusty. The renovations on Rose's beauty shop are about to begin. I need that $25,000 fast. Where are you that you don't have your cell phone?",
        "[Machine beeps] Barbara, it's me again. Where are you? I've left you half a dozen messages. The money never showed up in my account. I need that money. Today. Call me.",
        "[Machine beeps]",
        "Rose: It's just one of Barbara's tricks. Dusty knows. He's not gonna lie to me. He knows what the roller palace means to me, and he knows what your mom has done to me -- to us! He would never lie to me about this!",
        "Paul: And I would?",
        "Rose: No! No, it's just that I know him. And I -- he's been there for me, and I trust him.",
        "Paul: And you have feelings for him. Don't you, Rose?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: He's coming back to clean up the mess I made.",
        "Carly: If I was his wife, he'd be coming back to a roaring bonfire piled high with those designer suits of his.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I want you to choose me. Unconditionally.",
        "Rose: What are you talking about? Dusty is your best friend! He is footing the bill for my future!",
        "Paul: Do you have feelings for him?",
        "Rose: Yeah. Yeah. I got feelings for Dusty. I'm grateful to him for what he's done for me. And the way that he has backed me up. Why are you making more of this than it is?",
        "Paul: Because there is more going on between you two than gratitude. It's the only thing that makes sense, Rose. I've been trying to figure out why we cannot seem to make that step -- that next step. We just get stuck in neutral --",
        "[talking over each other] --everything in your power to sabotage our relationship. You left for Italy, you dropped off the face of the earth, and then you come back to town and you set up shop with my best friend after refusing my help. And then you kidnapped my mother, and now you are defending bizarre financial dealings that Dusty has lied about from the beginning! What am I supposed to think, Rose?",
        "Rose: I love you. And I've made some mistakes. I've made some big mistakes. We all have. What do you want me to do?",
        "Paul: I only want one thing. You. I want you to choose me. Unconditionally. It's up to you.",
        "[Rose sobs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I -- I just don't understand why you'd try to keep something like that from me?",
        "Bob: This is precisely what I was trying to avoid. Now why would Chris run to you and tell you about this?",
        "Kim: Chris? Chris knew, too?",
        "Bob: Well, I didn't tell him. He overheard a private conversation. Well, if Chris didn't tell you, who did?",
        "John: I did. You know, I thought that you would have shared this with the most important woman in your life. Well, that's foolish of me, I suppose.",
        "Bob: Is that the autopsy report.",
        "John: Yes, it is.",
        "Bob: What does it say?",
        "John: \"The patient Crumly died of a cardiac arrest. The medication in question was mostly still in his stomach. Drug levels in his blood were practically nonexistent. The medication did not cause his death.\"",
        "Kim: Oh, thank God. Thank God.",
        "John: You were not responsible, Bob.",
        "Bob: You know, I still can't believe how I made the mistake with the dosage. The important thing is, the hospital is no longer liable and I will not be haunted by the thought that a patient died because of my negligence.",
        "John: How 'bout I buy you a cup of coffee?",
        "Bob: I thought you'd never ask.",
        "John: Yeah, come on.",
        "Bob: I'll see you at home.",
        "Kim: Okay, honey.",

        "Jack: Hey, Katie.",
        "Katie: Jack. Hey, what's up?",
        "Jack: I got a message for your roommate.",
        "Katie: For Henry?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I went by the cottage and nobody was there.",
        "Katie: Oh no. What did he do now? Actually, on second thought, I don't want to know. Just -- I don't know -- should I tell him to go down to the station if I see him?",
        "Jack: No. Don't do that. But you might mention to him that the cops are after him.",
        "Katie: Is he in trouble, Jack?",
        "Jack: Big time. And if I were Henry Coleman, I'd get the hell out of dodge, pronto. Mention that to him, too. See ya.",

        "Carly: Nobody really knows what's going on in Craig's head. And frankly, we're probably better off for that. But one thing that he has said over and over again is how much he loves you. And he hasn't said that about anyone else.",
        "Rosanna: So I'm the abandoned bride who didn't get to consummate her marriage. That's love?",
        "Carly: No, that's Craig. He's impossible and he's irritating and he's a child. But he's mad about you.",
        "Rosanna: He called me...",
        "Carly: Well, there you go. You see, I told you. I told you that he would.",
        "Rosanna: He said he's coming back to clean up the mess I made.",
        "Carly: Oh, please. The nerve of that guy. If I was his wife, he'd be coming back to a roaring bonfire piled high with those designer suits of his. Rosanna, if he's treating you like this just days after your wedding, the guy doesn't deserve you. So let him know that you don't need him. Be my partner. Help me with this fashion show.",
        "Rosanna: And explain to me what difference putting together a fashion show is going to make to Craig?",
        "Carly: I'm not talking about Craig. I'm talking about you. You see, that's another difference between us. I may fall apart inside, but I always come back swinging. Don't let Monte Carlo die. I think you need it more than you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Let me get this straight. Detective Jack Snyder is now advising that I leave town?",
        "Katie: Yes, in a roundabout, backward way.",
        "Henry: This is not good. This is not good.",
        "Katie: What kind of trouble are you in, Henry?",
        "Henry: You don't want to know. All right, I'm outta here, and you never saw me. [Door closes] here, some here. This place is crawling with cops already. You need to help me, Katie.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, I am broke, Henry.",
        "Henry: I know that. I don't want your money. I need your help. I need you to get me out of here.",
        "Katie: Oh. My pleasure. Wait here.",

        "Alison: Katie! I'm so glad to see you.",
        "Katie: Good to see you, too. I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk right now. I gotta go. I'll see you later.",
        "Chris: Alison.",
        "Alison: Chris, hi.",
        "Chris: I've got a break coming up. You want to grab a shake and some fries in the cafeteria?",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, I'd really -- really like that.",

        "Lucy: How weird was that, seeing Alison?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, I know. It was a total shock. You know, I kind of feel sorry for her. She looks so lost.",
        "Lucy: How does she do that? You're blamed for a crime that she committed, we're chased halfway across the country, I'm in an accident that lands me in a wheelchair for months, and we're back to feeling sorry for Alison.",
        "Aaron: She did say she wouldn't cause any more trouble for us.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, well, just because I feel sorry for her doesn't mean I trust her.",
        "Aaron: Maybe being locked up changed things.",
        "Lucy: I hope so. But my eyes are wide open this time. If she even tries to come between us, then forget it. Nobody is gonna do that again, not my father, not anyone.",
        "Aaron: So does that mean I have a few more hours left with you?",
        "Lucy: I'll call Rosanna and let her know. I have a voice mail.",
        "Aaron: It better not be another guy in your life.",
        "Lucy: It's my father. He said there's major changes in the works. Whatever that means.",
        "Aaron: I don't know. But I know this for sure -- no matter what your father or Alison or this whole world throws at us, we're gonna be ready for it.",

        "Mitzi: Rose? What happened? What did Paul say?",
        "Rose: He accused me of having feelings for Dusty.",
        "Mitzi: And what did you say?",
        "Rose: I tried to dance around it, but you know what? I don't think he bought it.",
        "Mitzi: Then it's true?",
        "Rose: No. No. Oh, no.",
        "Mitzi: Listen, you listen up before I have to slap some sense into you, okay? Listen, remember when we were in Atlantic City, we always used to date the wild guys, right? The guys who lived on the edge? Every minute pure excitement? But you know what? They played with fire, and we were the ones that got burned. And they got a real short attention span, Rose.",
        "Rose: Oh, don't you think I've been telling myself that thousands of times, over and over in my head? But this guy, when he looks at me, it's like he can see right through me. He knows what I'm thinking. He knows what I want.",
        "Mitzi: What do you want? You want to break Paulie's heart?",
        "Rose: No.",
        "Mitzi: For a couple of kicks? I mean, you could have a lifetime of happiness.",
        "Rose: Yeah. You're right. You know, who needs danger and excitement? Not knowing what's coming next? I mean, that doesn't last. Right? Paul's offering me -- I mean, what he's offering me, it doesn't come with an expiration date, and that's what I want, you know? I want forever, and that's -- I'm gonna prove that's what I want.",
        "Mitzi: How are you gonna do that?",
        "Rose: I've got it. I'm gotta get off the beauty shop. I gotta give it up. I don't have a choice. I gotta -- [phone rings] hello?",
        "Dusty: I tried waiting for you to call me back, but the suspense is killing me. Meet me at the beauty shop. You've got to see this.",
        "Rose: Look, I can't do that. But I have to tell you something. I am -- I am giving up the Roller Palace. I don't care if you sell it to the highest bidder, but we cannot be partners anymore. I can't do this anymore.",
        "Dusty: Rose, wait, wait, hold on. I know where this is coming from. Whatever decision you make, I'll respect that decision, but you have got to meet me down at the shop.",
        "Rose: Do we have to do it in person? Can't you just tell me over the phone?",
        "Dusty: No, because you have to see this thing in person. It's an emergency. Just do me this one favor, would you? And then you can say good-bye to everything you've ever worked for.",
        "Rose: All right, but my decision is final. No turning back, no changing my mind.",
        "Dusty: We'll see about that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: I've never seen a woman put away so much hospital food in one sitting.",
        "Alison: I practically grew up on it. I'm used to it. I'm immune.",
        "Susan: Alison. Hi. Were you looking for me?",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Chris: Alison and I were just having lunch in the cafeteria.",
        "Susan: Oh. Look, I know we got off to a rocky start this morning, but I promise you, we'll more than make it up at dinner. Okay?",
        "Alison: Sure, whatever. Whatever.",
        "Chris: Bye, Susan. Nice attitude.",
        "Alison: You know that new doctor? Rick Decker? My mom's so hung up on him that he almost moved into our house last night. My first night home, my first night of freedom.",
        "Chris: I'm sure she didn't do it on purpose.",
        "Alison: But she has known him for what? Maybe two weeks? And now all I hear is Rick this and Rick that. It's -- the whole thing just creeps me out.",
        "Chris: Give him a chance. All right, the guy's got a great reputation. He's done groundbreaking work in the field. And he seems like a really good guy.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, if he's such a hotshot, then how come he's stuck here, working in the boonies?",
        "Chris: A lot of great doctors get stuck here at Memorial.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, why is he so into my mom?",
        "Chris: What, is there some unwritten law that he can't be attracted to your mom just 'cause she's your mother?",
        "Alison: Chris, whose side are you on with this?",
        "Chris: Why do there have to be sides, Alison?",
        "Alison: You know, everywhere I've been today, even at home, I've felt like an outsider. Until I saw you and you smiled at me and for the first time in months, I was actually having a good time and nobody was judging me.",
        "Chris: The same way you're judging Rick and your mom?",
        "Alison: The same way that you're judging me! I don't need this. I don't need to put up with this. You know, the one thing that I needed most today was just to have a friend.",

        "Rose: All right, what's the big emergency? Did the pipes burst again?",
        "Dusty: You'd better see this for yourself.",
        "Rose: You know, I'm selling the place anyway. Let the next owners have the problem.",
        "Dusty: You're sure about that?",
        "Rose: Never been surer about anything in my life. What, do you see 133 pounds of confidence me",
        "Dusty: What do you think? Yes, I can. Something that sings in my blood is telling me",
        "Rose: It's beautiful. I was just born today",
        "Dusty: You like what they did or what?",
        "Rose: How in the world did you do this?",
        "Dusty: Well, I had the contractors pull an all-nighter.",
        "Rose: I don't believe it. I mean, it's amazing. It's absolutely -- yes I can, I have just found the key. Hate doors swing wide for me I was just born today it's just like my dream that I had, right there.",
