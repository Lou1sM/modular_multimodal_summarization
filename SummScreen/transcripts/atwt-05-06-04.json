        "Mike: Pilar, is Katie there?!",
        "Pilar: Mike, help! Please. She's trying to kill me!",
        "Katie: What?! Mike, Mike!",
        "Mike: Katie! Katie, come on!",
        "Pilar: She's trying to kill me.",
        "Katie: She's lying.",
        "Mike: Now, get off of her.",
        "Katie: This is all an act. She just admitted it.",
        "Mike: Are you all right?",
        "Pilar: I think so.",
        "Katie: Of course she's fine. Don't even listen to her. She just made this whole thing up, to make it look like I was attacking her.",
        "Pilar: I was so scared --",
        "Margo: Katie, could you please stop talking?",
        "Katie: Well, she was fine until you guys showed up and then she started screaming her head off.",
        "Mike: Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Katie: Of course she's all right. She was strong enough to pull me on top of her.",
        "Pilar: She came after me. Her eyes were wild.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on, Margo. Please, don't let her do this again -- don't let her get away with it.",
        "Margo: Katie, we saw you.",
        "Katie: But she just admitted everything to me. Just now. She said that the reason that she pretended to poison Mike was so that I would go crazy and everybody would think I was nuts. Mike, please, after everything we've been through, please say that you believe me.",

        "Lily: To Maryann Cottone.",
        "Dusty: To who?",
        "Lily: Maryanne Cottone, the first recipient for the Rose Foundation Scholarship.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: I feel like I'm four years old. Mom -- you're gonna be okay, right? You can't --",
        "Barbara: Honey, I'm not going anywhere at all. And I'd like to be able to tell you that everything's gonna be all right. But I can't. I don't know that and it wouldn't be fair to either one of us.",
        "Jennifer: I should have known. I could have helped you --",
        "Barbara: Honey -- you were a help. You and Will and Paul -- if I ever had any doubts about why I had to live, I just looked into the eyes of my children.",
        "Jennifer: Now with Paul taking over the company --",
        "Barbara: Honey, this is so much more than who owns what. This is about -- life and how much more of it I'm going to have. And when I lie awake at night and I think about what's coming and what's in store and I imagine the future, I -- I just think about what I want to see.",
        "Jennifer: What do you see?",
        "Barbara: I see you. In a stunning white gown, coming down the aisle and me and a corsage telling everyone in the world that I am the mother of the most beautiful bride. And I'll be dancing that night. I'll be dancing, and it will be the happiest night of my life. And if Walker comes back in here and tells me I have to walk through fire to get there, then that's what I'll do. And we both know how I feel about fire.",
        "Jennifer: I'll walk with you, Mom.",
        "Barbara: I know you will, sweetheart.",
        "Jennifer: I love you.",
        "Barbara: I love you, too. Now there is something you can do for me. All right?",
        "Jennifer: Anything.",
        "Barbara: I want you to march back to the hotel. And you make sure that Carly and Jordan have that show --",
        "Jennifer: I don't want to leave you, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Honey, honey. They're not gonna let you come with me when I go in for tests. There's nothing you can do sitting here in this room, so -- go on. Go back there. Jen --",
        "Jennifer: You think Paul's gonna let that happen?",
        "Barbara: Well, if he thinks he's gonna stop it, then you have to find a way around that, you know. You use the press, you use whatever you have to use. Carly and Jordan will help you.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. Okay. I will find them and help them pull it together. But then I'm coming right back.",
        "Barbara: Yes, you are. Thank you.",
        "Jennifer: Mom, after what Paul did tonight, do you think you'll ever be able to forgive him?",
        "Barbara: I don't know. I honestly just don't know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You've got your company. It's all here in black and white. The question is, do you still want it?",
        "Paul: So that was Mom's big secret, huh?",
        "Carly: Not what you expected?",
        "Paul: Don't act all superior. You were gonna stab Barbara in the back right alongside me.",
        "Carly: And I bowed out.",
        "Paul: Yeah? By choice or by chance?",
        "Carly: Both. I'm not proud of our little conspiracy. And I'm really sorry that Barbara found out what we were planning. Because you know something? This time she and I were starting to get it right. Barbara and I found something -- not friendship. It's not a girlfriend thing. Respect. Mutual respect. She's got class. And maybe I always resented her for that. Growing up, I always wanted to be a Barbara Ryan. I wanted to be the toast of the town, turn heads -- just count for something --",
        "Paul: Well, maybe this is still your chance.",
        "Carly: I'm here to help your Mother, not take her place.",
        "Paul: I could fight you, you know?",
        "Carly: You could try. I'd fight back.",
        "Paul: So you're Barbara Ryan's newest champion, huh? She has so many these days.",
        "Carly: Except the one she really wants. You know who she needs, Paul. It's not me. It's not Jordan. It's you.",
        "Paul: I don't know if she's gonna want me after today. I don't know why she couldn't just tell me, you know? She always has to be the martyr.",
        "Carly: Don't you get what she's done?! Are you so filled with revenge and guilt that it's gone right over your head?",
        "Paul: Come on! All of a sudden, my Mother wants to behave like a Mother. She doesn't even bother to tell me first, and I'm -- how I feel -- she looked so scared when she fell off that stage --",
        "Carly: Yeah, she's got a right to be scared. And for weeks, she's kept going in spite of it. She's held it all together. She's a brave woman.",
        "Paul: She is. I think I might have forgotten how brave. The tumor. Is it malignant, Carly?",
        "Carly: They don't know. She hasn't had a biopsy and nobody's saying the word. But it's out there. She refused treatment because she wanted you and Jennifer to have this show -- to have this triumph, to have this moment that she could share with you before reality came crashing down. She was fighting for her family. It's all ending up in pieces, anyway. So much for the best-laid plans.",
        "Paul: You know the thing I don't understand? My Mother has come to really rely on Jordan the last few months, so he must have known about her illness, right?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Paul: So isn't it a little odd that now is the time that he gets tight with Rosanna? What's the connection with those two? What's going on with them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justice of the peace: It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Cabot, Mr. Sinclair.",
        "Rosanna: I assume everything is in order.",
        "Justice of the peace: Per your request.",
        "Rosanna: You've arranged all the legal documents?",
        "Justice of the peace: We're a stickler for the details, Ms. Cabot. Your marriage is 100% valid in every state of this union.",
        "Rosanna: Good.",
        "Justice of the peace: By the way, we're running a special on 14-carat wedding bands.",
        "Rosanna: That's not necessary. We have our own rings.",
        "Jordan: Would you excuse us for a moment? I feel like I'm having an out-of- body experience. I mean, I'm here, but I don't believe that I'm really here.",
        "Rosanna: I know. It's okay. I feel the same way.",
        "Jordan: Yeah? Well, you seem pretty cool under pressure.",
        "Rosanna: Well, you're making it so much easier. You are. And here I am, I'm getting married to this wonderful man with a beautiful heart who is willing to sacrifice so much for a child he's never met. A girl could do worse, you know? And so could you, I might add. So shall we?",
        "Jordan: We're ready to begin.",
        "Justice of the peace: Then I ask that you continue to join hands and repeat after me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How could you do this?",
        "Dusty: Do what? I didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Lily: I don't want you anywhere near the Rose Foundation. Just stay away from the money.",
        "Dusty: Hey, hey, hey, just hear me out --",
        "Lily: I don't want to hear anymore lies, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Lies? There are no lies. Sit down. Please, sit down. [Lily sighs] Listen, I did -- I did make that wire transfer, and I probably should have told you. I certainly couldn't tell you in front of this FBI guy. I didn't think it would be a problem.",
        "Lily: Okay, okay, wiring money to a known crime syndicate, that's not a problem?",
        "Dusty: It's not what you think.",
        "Lily: It's not what I think? Where'd you get the money?",
        "Dusty: Big donation -- big donation that we got and -- I felt a little weird about it afterwards, so I looked into it.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm. What did you find?",
        "Dusty: I found -- well, I traced it to some outfit in Chicago. Some front for some small-time gambling operation. I got in contact with them and I told them to keep the money.",
        "Lily: So you returned the check?",
        "Dusty: No, I deposited the check. So they gave their account number and I did a wire transfer.",
        "Lily: To some offshore account?",
        "Dusty: Yes.",
        "Lily: Somewhere in the Cayman Islands.",
        "Dusty: I had no idea I was laundering money. Okay? I had no idea. And I certainly didn't know where the account was held.",
        "Lily: Are you sure about that?",
        "Dusty: Am I sure about what, Lil? I played it straight. Look, if you want me to hold onto every nickel that comes in, until I check the source, I'll do that for you.",
        "Lily: No, no, you know what -- that would take --",
        "Dusty: I know how long that will take.",
        "Lily: Okay. Let's just go back to the office and let Agent Fox handle the whole thing.",
        "Dusty: That's what I'm talking about. We'll talk to him, and he'll see that it was unintentional. Okay, I'll meet you over there. I'll settle up here.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Dusty: Lil? Hey -- [Dusty sighs] If you want me out of the foundation, just say the word.",
        "Lily: No. No. No, I don't want you out. We'll work this out together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Katie, I'm going to have to take you straight from here to the hospital.",
        "Mike: How long did you say she'd have to stay away?",
        "Margo: Until the doctors decide that she's no longer a threat to herself or anyone else.",
        "Katie: I'm not the threat here, Margo.",
        "Mike: Can she have visitors?",
        "Margo: That's at the doctor's discretion. Are you ready to go?",
        "Katie: Don't turn your back on her, Mike.",
        "Mike: Katie, wait.",
        "Katie: Being locked away, people thinking that I'm crazy, it's better than standing around watching you get hurt. And I know you don't believe that that's gonna happen. You don't believe anything I said tonight -- except maybe that I love you. I do love you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Jordan, its Jennifer. Oh, excuse me, have you seen Mr. Sinclair?",
        "Maid: Of 426?",
        "Jennifer: Yes.",
        "Maid: He left a little while ago.",
        "Jennifer: Do you know how long ago?",
        "Maid: Not long. I just passed them in the lobby.",
        "Jennifer: Them?",
        "Maid: He was with a woman.",
        "Jennifer: Do you have any idea where they went? Please, it's very important. I need to find him.",
        "Maid: I heard something about \"the palace of happiness.\"",
        "Jennifer: What is that? A Chinese restaurant?",
        "Maid: It's a wedding chapel down the strip.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Tell the other girls I'd like a dry run in 15, okay?",
        "Paul: You are evading.",
        "Carly: No, I'm working. I'll put Carolyn in front of Paula.",
        "Paul: So why's your sister so interested in Jordan?",
        "Carly: Why are you so interested in why she's so interested? It's one way to keep yourself from thinking about what you did to Barbara today. Your mother is sick and for all you know, you've taken away her will to live. If that's what you wanted, congrats. This day has been a great big success for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justice of the peace: And do",
        "Justice of the peace: And do you, Jordan, take Rosanna to be your lawful- wedded wife? Do you promise to love and cherish her from this day forward as long as you both shall live? Should I repeat the question?",
        "Jordan: I'm sorry, I need another moment with my fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan, what are you doing?",
        "Jordan: I listened to those words, Rosanna -- what they mean -- and none of them are true, not for us.",
        "Rosanna: We've been through this.",
        "Jordan: I know, but saying it and doing it are -- are worlds apart. I just thought I would have -- at a moment like this -- more than a passing acquaintance with the woman standing next to me.",
        "Rosanna: We're not getting married for the usual reasons, you know that.",
        "Jordan: I know, but can you be sure that this is gonna give you what you want? I mean, when all is said and done, there's no guarantee that this will give you your son back.",
        "Rosanna: No, but there is a guarantee if I don't do this, I won't get my son back. So I have to do whatever I can to bring him home, there's no choice.",
        "Justice of the peace: I got another happy couple waiting in the wings, folks. You want to finish up here?",
        "Rosanna: It's up to you. I need your answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Starziak, its Donovan. You're a big-time loser, because the feds are onto your little money scam. And as far as you and I go, we are done. You hear me? It's over.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Come on. Okay, I got a complete schedule of your therapy sessions you daily activities, and --",
        "Katie: Great, I'll weave you a basket.",
        "Margo: Oh, come on, Katie. This is for your own good.",
        "Katie: What about Mike's own good? If I can't help him, then nothing else matters.",
        "Margo: Don't -- don't say that.",
        "Katie: Pilar won. I lost. I won't be bothering you or anyone else anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: It's Frasier. F-r-a-s-I-e-r. She should have been checked in by now. No, I'll call back later.",
        "Pilar: I'm so sorry, Michael.",
        "Mike: Well, she's probably still in processing. I gotta go.",
        "Pilar: But you're too upset to drive.",
        "Mike: I'm fine.",
        "Pilar: Michael, please. You shouldn't be alone. Please, stay with me. Let me help you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Justice of the peace: I now pronounce you husband and wife. Mr. Sinclair, you may kiss your bride.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan? What are you doing?",
        "Jordan: Rosanna and I just got married.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Walker? Jennifer?",
        "Paul: No, Mom. It's me.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Paul: I wanted revenge.",
        "Barbara: So, how's it feel? Am I suffering enough to finally make you happy?",
        "Pilar: We're both alone. Why not be alone together?",
        "Rosanna: I've married Jordan Sinclair. Yes, I have the marriage certificate. When can I have Cabot?"
