        "Henry is trying to convince Vienna to keep the baby, but she is adamant that they can't go back on their word with Brad and Katie. Henry has changed his mind about the baby, and he makes a compelling argument why they should keep their baby, but Vienna doesn't think they can do this to their friends; they made a promise to their best friends. Vienna wants them to talk with Brad and Katie, but she wants to start with an apology for his behavior with the baby from the hospital. She wants them to look into their eyes and make a decision after they see their reactions. Katie and Brad wonder why the obstetrician that gave them news about their baby would be doing stand up comedy so they track him down; he admits that he was paid off by a woman. Brad and Katie got to the hospital to look at their medical files and the nurse tells them that Brad is not the baby's father. Brad and Katie assume there was a mistake at the hospital, but then they see in the file that the insemination didn't take and the unfortunate and devastating truth starts to sink in. Paul supposedly leaves on his trip to Paris, while Meg continues to weave her manipulation. She dresses up and goes over to see Dusty knowing Paul is watching her. She asks him to go to his room but when Dusty seems happy, she is there and knowing that she is using him, Meg bails. However, when she sees Paul near Dusty's room, she changes her mind and knocks on the door and when Dusty opens it, she kisses him passionately and pushes him back inside. Dusty knows something is going on with Meg's erratic behavior. She finally admits to what she is doing, but Dusty doesn't want to play games and goes outside to the hall but can't find Paul. Meg orders him to stay out of it because he is concerned with her safety as she antagonizes Paul. Later, Dusty tells Paul what Meg is doing in order to protect her. However, Paul calls Meg on her behavior and tells her that she humiliated him and went back on her word so he wants her out of his home and tells her that she will never see Eliza again. Meg pleads with him to change his mind. He wants prove she won't do this again, as he makes her beg. He tells her that he will let this go for now, as a furious Meg leaves and goes to confront Dusty. They argue about his interference and Meg tells him how he ruined everything. She leaves, as she tells Dusty that she no longer trusts him. Vienna and Henry go to see Brad and Katie to apologize and find Katie crying. Katie tells them that they know the truth. Henry and Vienna try to explain, but a devastated Katie and Brad don't understand how they could lie to them about this - of all things. Vienna wants Katie to still have their baby, but Brad and Katie don't want any part of that and Henry doesn't look too happy about that either. Katie is distraught and tells them that not only doesn't she not want their baby, she doesn't want them in their lives anymore. Vienna and Henry plead with them to remember their friendship, but Brad and Katie don't want them around anymore. Later, Vienna and Henry are crushed over losing their best friends, but try to find comfort in their baby. Meanwhile, Katie and Brad are crushed as well, as Katie tries to find solace in holding and comforting the baby from the hospital, as a distraught Brad looks on unaware as to how to help Katie."

        "Vienna: I don't think I heard you right. It almost sounded like you said you wanted to keep this baby.",
        "Henry: That's what I said.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no, no. That's not what you meant. It couldn't be. Because that means that you want to raise this -- this child together with me. You would be a father. And that word always gave you the hives.",
        "Henry: I know, I know. The idea's just grown on me, I guess.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God.",
        "Henry: No, listen to me. I want to be a father to this child. To our child. You and me and baby makes three.",
        "Vienna: Oh, God.",
        "Henry: I want -- I want to apply for pre-schools. I want skinned knees. I want rubber duckies. I want acne. I want SATs. I want to go broke paying for college. I want the whole ball of wax. I want it all.",
        "Vienna: Henry Coleman. I don't believe you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: This doesn't make any sense.",
        "Katie: This is Dr. Shmeglitz. I know it.",
        "Brad: Yeah, but Bob didn't recognize the face or the name.",
        "Katie: Which means he's not even a doctor, and he lied to us. But why?",
        "Brad: Well, there's only one way to find out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: So, you are sure you have everything -- your passport.",
        "Paul: I have everything I need. You don't need to worry about me. You need to take care of your cold.",
        "Meg: You know what, I'm gonna be fine. I just don't want you to forget something and then you have to come back here.",
        "Paul: If I have to come back, I come back. What's the big deal?",
        "Meg: You know what, if you forget something, just call me and I'll send it to you. What's express delivery for, right?",
        "Paul: You know, your mama takes such good care of both of us, and you're the only one that needs her help.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: Don't be. You're just being helpful, right?",
        "Meg: I overstepped my bounds. You and I don't have a personal relationship. You made that quite clear.",
        "Paul: Doesn't mean that we need to go at each other's throats. Why don't you come to Paris with me? Could be fun.",
        "Meg: Paul, we already talked about this. I mean, I would love to, but it would be the worst thing for this cold.",
        "Paul: Right. So, what are you gonna do with yourself while I'm gone?",
        "Meg: Well, I'm gonna try and get better. If I don't start making some headway, I'll probably end up in bed.",
        "[Giggling]",
        "Paul: Take care of yourself.",
        "Meg: Say good-bye to Daddy. Bye, Daddy! Bye! Daddy is going far, far away.",
        "[Eliza coos]",
        "Meg: Yeah. Yeah. Would you like to go on a little trip, Honey? Would you like to go see Grandma Emma? Huh? 'Cause Mommy has plans of her own this afternoon. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: You're only doing this because you're jealous.",
        "Henry: I'm not jealous.",
        "Vienna: No, I know you. You don't like it when Brad's touching me, but he -- he's not touching me. He's touching the mother of his child.",
        "Henry: That's the mother of my child -- that's the problem.",
        "Vienna: No, once we give Brad the baby, he's not gonna be touching me anymore, and you don't have anything to be jealous about.",
        "Henry: I'm not jealous! Maybe I am a little bit. But that's not why I want to keep the baby.",
        "Vienna: Then it's stress. It's stress. You're stressed because you're left out, because Brad and Katie and I, we've been all focused on the baby and not enough on you, right?",
        "Henry: God, you think I want to keep the baby because I want attention?",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no. I know that we hurt your feelings when we didn't tell you about the parenting class. I know that. But maybe if we -- we bring you more into it --",
        "Henry: Sweetie, no, no, no. Come on. You don't understand. I don't want to keep the baby because I'm jealous or because I feel left out. I want to keep it because I want to be a father to this child.",
        "Vienna: No.",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: Why? Why after all these months do you have this sudden change of heart?",
        "Henry: I don't know! I don't know, I just do!",
        "Vienna: No, no, that's not -- that's not good enough, Henry! It's not good enough! You've always told me that you have bad genes and you have no patience, you want nothing to change in our relationship together!",
        "Henry: I know, I know I know. I remember all that. I remember it.",
        "Vienna: And now all of a sudden, all magically, you want this baby? Then nothing you said was true.",
        "Henry: It is. It's all true. I love you. And I know that you love me. And I love the fact that there's a part of both of us growing inside of you.",
        "Vienna: That's beautiful, Henry.",
        "Henry: I know, it is, isn't it?",
        "Vienna: But when I said the same thing, you kept fighting me.",
        "Henry: I know. I know I did. And here we are. Something that wasn't supposed to happen in the first place. It's like you and me being together. Here we are. And all I can think about is a beautiful little girl with your beautiful blue eyes.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no. This is -- this is Brad and Katie's baby.",
        "Henry: No, it's not. It's not. It's ours. It's yours and mine. And something I don't even deserve. And I know -- I know I'm not gonna get candidate for father of the year or anything like that. I know it's not -- there's no way on earth this could possibly happen, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't give it a try. Say it's what you want, too.",
        "Vienna: Of course it is! This is what I've always wanted! But being Katie's surrogate was the only way I thought I could even get remotely close to it! But having a baby with you -- that's my dream!",
        "Henry: That's wonderful!",
        "Vienna: No! No, it's terrible!",
        "Henry: What do you mean, it's terrible? We're talking dreams come true here!",
        "Vienna: Don't you understand, Henry? It's too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: There he is.",
        "Brad: Hmm.",
        "Katie: I don't know. Maybe this is a mistake.",
        "Brad: Oh, there's been a mistake, and he's the one who's made it. Hey! Look, Honey! It's Dr. Shmeglitz! How you doing, Doctor? Are you at Yo's for a house call?",
        "Man: I'm sorry, my name is Samuel Litz.",
        "Katie: Oh, well, in that case, Sammy, we have a couple questions for you.",
        "Brad: Who are you, and why were you pretending to be our doctor? And if you don't come clean, you think you're gonna be doing stand-up tonight, you're not, because you're not gonna be able to stand up.",
        "Man: I don't know anything about your baby, okay? I only said what she paid me to say.",
        "Brad: \"She\"?",
        "Katie: Who is \"She\"?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey there, Johnny.",
        "Dusty: We address a woman who's talking to us, right, Buddy?",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Meg: It's okay. I would hate to interrupt an artist at work.",
        "Dusty: You look like a piece of art yourself. I hope Paul appreciates it.",
        "Meg: I'm not meeting Paul. I thought I'd make an effort. You know, you have to look nice for yourself once in a while, right?",
        "Dusty: That's right. Hey, Pal, look who's here. Hey, Johnny. Ready to play with Billy and Trey?",
        "Dusty: Do you have his blanket in case he gets tired?",
        "Man: Already in the car.",
        "Dusty: You have my home phone, right?",
        "Man: Mm-hmm. And I won't hesitate to call if he needs you.",
        "Dusty: Thank you. All right, Pal. Time to go. High five. Have fun.",
        "Meg: Wow, you are really protective of him.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, of course. Now that Craig's in jail, he needs me more than ever.",
        "Meg: So, where's Lucy?",
        "Dusty: She's working. Why?",
        "Meg: Well, um, I just wanted to talk to you, and I wanted to make sure that she wasn't waiting for you.",
        "Dusty: Won't Paul be looking for you?",
        "Meg: He's in Paris. And before you say anything, Eliza is with my mother, so we would have plenty of time to talk.",
        "Dusty: All right, I'm all ears.",
        "Meg: Can we go somewhere private?",
        "Dusty: Sure. Let's go to my room.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "[Elevator dings]",
        "Dusty: Can I offer you a drink?",
        "Meg: Uh, no. No, thanks.",
        "Dusty: What do you want to talk about?",
        "Meg: Um, well, I wanted to tell you that I appreciate everything you've done.",
        "Dusty: You could have told me that downstairs.",
        "Meg: Maybe. But I felt it was a little bit more personal. I wanted to tell you in private.",
        "Dusty: I'm listening.",
        "Meg: I know you care a lot about me and Eliza.",
        "Dusty: I always have. I always will.",
        "Meg: That means something special to me.",
        "Dusty: What's it mean?",
        "Meg: Well, I'm still trying to figure that out.",
        "Dusty: Maybe it means you realize living with Paul is a mistake.",
        "Meg: Well, that's not exactly --",
        "Dusty: That you're wasting your life on him. You and I belong together. Don't run from it anymore.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, this was a mistake.",
        "Dusty: Going back to Paul is a mistake. Hey, wait a second.",
        "Meg: No, you know what, I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: Forget something?",
        "Meg: Yeah. I forgot this.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Dusty: What are you doing?",
        "Meg: Nothing.",
        "Dusty: You're up to something. I want to know what it is.",
        "Meg: You want this, Dusty, you know you do.",
        "Dusty: I know you're up to something.",
        "Meg: Of course I am. That's why I came here.",
        "Dusty: Then why'd you have one eye on me and the other on the door?",
        "Meg: Paul's outside.",
        "Dusty: What? I thought he was in Paris.",
        "Meg: Well, he's not. I saw him in the hallway when I went out there.",
        "Dusty: I'll get rid of him.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no, Dusty, please.",
        "Dusty: You think I'm gonna let him spy on me, you're as crazy as he is. He's gone. If he was ever there in the first place.",
        "Meg: He was there, all right.",
        "Dusty: Do you know what Paul is gonna do if he thinks we're back together?",
        "Meg: I have everything under control.",
        "Dusty: Not if Paul's involved. You don't.",
        "Meg: You don't have to worry about me. Things are going exactly the way I want them to.",
        "Dusty: You wanted to push him? You want to push him to doing something drastic? Is that it?",
        "Meg: That's exactly what I want to do.",
        "Dusty: Don't you understand what he can do to you?",
        "Meg: I know exactly what he could do to me.",
        "Dusty: I can't let you do this anymore.",
        "Meg: You don't have a choice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Look at me. It's not too late. Okay? It's not. I know I've been a complete idiot, and I didn't know what I wanted when it was right there in front of me, but I do now. Can I get a do-over?",
        "Vienna: Of course you could. If it was up to me. But it's not up to us anymore. Too much time has passed. And Katie and Brad, they've grown too attached to this baby.",
        "Henry: Our baby.",
        "Vienna: No, it's theirs. That's what they're thinking. And we promised it was.",
        "Henry: And we go to them and we explain and we make them understand.",
        "Vienna: What do you want to do, just go over there and tell them, \"Oops, we made a boo-boo and the baby is ours and we're keeping it?\"",
        "Henry: No. I'm sure we're gonna have to put it better than that.",
        "Vienna: No. There is no better way. What you're talking is kidnapping.",
        "Henry: Excuse me?",
        "Vienna: No, this -- this baby has meant the world to Brad and Katie. Ever since they knew about it. Can you say the same? Huh? I -- I can't bear to think of how Katie will feel. She's been so happy and so excited ever since she found out, and just the thought of bringing this baby into their lives.",
        "Henry: I know, I know, I know. She's already got the nursery fully stocked.",
        "Vienna: It would break her heart. Both their hearts.",
        "Henry: What about our hearts?",
        "Vienna: No. No. I can't do this. Katie's my first female friend. I never knew I could have a friend like that. I can't do this to her. This baby belongs to Brad and Katie. The next one is ours.",
        "Henry: What are we supposed to do? Are we supposed to just give away our flesh and blood?",
        "Vienna: No, we're supposed to keep our promise. Just like we planned. And they will never know the truth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: I mean, I just don't get it. Why would some woman pay a comedian to pretend to be a doctor?",
        "Katie: You know, I don't even care anymore. The only thing I care about is that our baby is okay.",
        "Nurse: What exactly did you need to know?",
        "Brad: Okay, see, we all got tested -- me, Vienna Hyatt. She's the mother of the baby.",
        "Katie: He means our surrogate.",
        "Brad: Right, right. And we just want to make sure there was no genetic bad news.",
        "Nurse: The baby seems to be perfectly fine.",
        "Katie: Oh, thank God.",
        "Brad: See, look, I told you, there was nothing to worry about.",
        "Katie: Thank you so much. You have no idea what a load off this is. What? What's wrong?",
        "Brad: Nothing's wrong. She just said the baby was perfectly fine.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. You just saw something in that file, didn't you?",
        "Nurse: I really should get Dr. Hughes.",
        "Katie: No, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere. Not until you tell us that everything with our baby is okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You can't just go handing out babies like puppies from a litter -- one for them, one for us.",
        "Vienna: I feel the same way, but what's done is done. We have no choice.",
        "Henry: The hell we don't, Vienna! We keep the baby, or we give it to them? I know which one I choose!",
        "Vienna: Oh, yeah, yeah, now you do, but you had that choice earlier, but you just didn't take it!",
        "Henry: Well, I -- maybe I needed it to be real for me, okay? When I went in there and saw Brad crouching down, waiting to catch our baby -- my baby, I kind of lost it.",
        "Vienna: And that makes me love you even more.",
        "Henry: You see? You get me like I get you. We think alike. We have to keep this baby. We might be the only people that understand it.",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry, you're breaking my heart. If I had known that you could feel this way, I would never have offered to be Katie's surrogate.",
        "Henry: If I had known I could feel this way, I never would have let you volunteer in the first place. I'm so sorry, Sweetie, it took me so long to come around. But I'm here now, okay? Give me a chance to make things right.",
        "Vienna: What if they already are right? Think about it.",
        "Henry: I think about it constantly.",
        "Vienna: Well, think some more. We don't have to make any decision. We don't have to tell Brad and Katie anything yet. We can just go to their house and talk.",
        "Henry: Talk? What are we supposed to say? \"I'm sorry, you're gonna have to find someone else to carry your baby\"?",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no. You'll give them an apology for the way you acted in parenting class, and then we'll just take it from there.",
        "Henry: Okay, I owe them that much, at least.",
        "Vienna: No, you owe them a lot more than that. And when we're all together, look into their eyes and think about how much it would hurt for them to lose this baby, especially when we might be their only chance to have one.",
        "Henry: Vienna, that's not our fault.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but how can we take that away? How could we take that away from them? Especially when we know that we can have all the babies we want in the future?",
        "Henry: I'll think about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: There is no way I can't be that baby's father.",
        "Katie: Look again. You're just gonna have to look again.",
        "Brad: Look, I don't care what genetic profiles say -- I'm that baby's daddy.",
        "Katie: This was artificial insemination. There's no way Brad can't be the father. Unless there was some sort of mix-up at the lab.",
        "Brad: Did you mix my boys up with someone else's? 'Cause if you did, we're talking, like -- we're talking major lawsuit here.",
        "Nurse: I'll go get the doctor to explain things.",
        "Katie: My God. This is horrible. Some random donor is the father of our baby because of some hospital mix-up.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, let's -- let's not freak out until we know that's what happened.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. This cannot be true.",
        "Brad: Okay, look, I don't read doctor-ese, so --",
        "Katie: It says the artificial insemination failed.",
        "Brad: Then how can Vienna be pregnant?",
        "Katie: I think I know. I think we both do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: If Paul saw you in this room today, he's gonna make you pay.",
        "Meg: I told you, I can handle Paul.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you keep saying that. If you want my help, you got to fill me in on the details.",
        "Meg: Okay, look. Paul wants me to think that he's out of the country, which obviously, he's not. But he is watching my every move. What he doesn't know is that I'm letting him watch. But I'm only letting him see what I want him to see.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you're trying to drive him crazy, which isn't too tough to do.",
        "Meg: I want him to get pushed as far as he can by his jealousy. And when we're done, I'll have all the proof I need to get Eliza back.",
        "Dusty: Forget about it. It's too dangerous.",
        "Meg: What I do is not up to you, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I'm looking after you. And us, believe me.",
        "Meg: There is no us. Not anymore.",
        "Dusty: I'm not letting you put yourself in that kind of danger.",
        "Meg: It's not up to you. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey!",
        "Vienna: Your worries are over! I found Henry, and he feels terrible about it.",
        "Henry: Terrible! I behaved completely inappropriately. I'm very, very sorry. And I brought botbaby back to its rightful parents.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, get that thing away from me.",
        "Henry: What's wrong?",
        "Brad: Are you seriously asking that question?",
        "Katie: What's wrong is that we forgot who we were dealing with. We actually thought that you and Vienna were two people that we could trust.",
        "Henry: What's gotten into you?",
        "Brad: What's gotten into Katie? Why don't you ask what's gotten into Vienna? Because I think the answer to that question is pretty damn interesting. But you already know that, don't you, Henry?",
        "Henry: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Katie: Yes, you do! And you do, too, Vienna. You two have known for weeks what Brad and I just found out a few minutes ago.",
        "Vienna: What did you find out a few minutes ago?",
        "Brad: We looked at the medical records. You're not having my baby. You're having Henry's.",
        "Katie: Oh, God! Oh, I prayed that I was wrong, but I wasn't. I thought you two maybe were just as in the dark as we were, but you weren't, were you? You've known this whole time that you were pregnant with Henry's child?",
        "Vienna: No, no, no, no, not the whole time. In the beginning, it was --",
        "Henry: Let us explain.",
        "Brad: You had weeks to explain, Henry!",
        "Vienna: It didn't happen the way you think.",
        "Katie: I knew it, I knew it! I knew something was wrong! I knew that Henry was too over possessive of that baby, but I made all kinds of excuses. The truth was right there under our noses. But we could have never guessed, because you're our friends, our best friends. You were like family to us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Couldn't wait for him to get out of the country. I hope he stays away for good.",
        "Dusty: Why are we wasting time talking about Paul?",
        "Meg: You're right. Make love to me, Dusty.",
        "Paul: Again. Oh, yeah. What's the matter, Dusty? No more room service here?",
        "Dusty: I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong. It's not what it looks like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: We never wanted to lie to you.",
        "Vienna: Everything we did, we did it for you.",
        "Katie: No, you didn't. You're still lying to us. You didn't do this for us!",
        "Brad: You lived in our house and you lied to us. You smiled in our faces and you lied to us. You hired a stand-up comic to pose as our doctor so you could keep lying to us?",
        "Vienna: Brad, Katie, please let us explain. We didn't start it out as a trick. When I found out that I wasn't pregnant with your baby, I couldn't tell you. I couldn't tell you the truth.",
        "Katie: Why? You should have forced yourself!",
        "Vienna: I couldn't bear to see you devastated, and all of a sudden, we didn't mean it to happen, but I got pregnant with Henry right away, and --",
        "Katie: Oh, my God -- so this was just an accident? Brad and I try and try for months and we don't have a successful pregnancy, but you didn't even mean to, and you got pregnant? That's supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Vienna: I'm trying to tell you how it happened. And, yes, it was an accident. Henry didn't want the baby. And you and Brad, you wanted a baby so much, and I thought it was happening for a reason. And so we agreed that we would give this baby to the two of you, just as we planned.",
        "Katie: How could you do this to us? How could you ever imagine that letting us fall in love with that baby was a good idea?",
        "Henry: Listen, give Vienna some slack here, okay?",
        "Katie: No. Why?",
        "Henry: Because she loves you, and this is killing her just as much as it's killing you. If you want to blame anybody, blame me.",
        "Brad: All right, fine, you want blame, then you got it. Okay, you got it. But did you seriously think you'd be able to pass your kid off as ours?",
        "Vienna: It is yours. It is yours.",
        "Henry: We haven't decided that.",
        "Vienna: No, yes, we have. We're gonna keep our word, okay? We're giving this baby, our baby, to you, for you to raise as your own.",
        "Brad: Are you guys crazy?",
        "Katie: We wanted Brad's baby, not Henry's.",
        "Henry: I know. I know. And none of us wanted things to turn out this way.",
        "Vienna: We can still work it out.",
        "Katie: How are we supposed to do that?",
        "Brad: So what are we gonna tell little Brad when he comes out looking like Uncle Henry, you know, and when he figures out he's not good at football, but he's damn good at playing the ponies?",
        "Vienna: Tell him the truth.",
        "Katie: Would you please stop using that word?",
        "Vienna: No, many children are adopted. Many children are adopted. It doesn't make a difference.",
        "Katie: Vienna seems to be doing all the talking. What about you, Henry? You want us to raise your child?",
        "Vienna: Yes, of course he will -- tell them. Tell them!",
        "Henry: You know I'd do anything for you, Katie.",
        "Katie: But you wouldn't give us our baby, would you? Of course you wouldn't. Just as we wouldn't take it. But I don't blame Henry for getting attached to this baby, because I feel the same way.",
        "Vienna: Which is why you should have this one.",
        "Katie: No. Are you crazy? Even if you gave us that child, it would never truly be ours.",
        "Vienna: If you loved it, it would be yours.",
        "Katie: Maybe. Maybe if you told us all of this from the very beginning. Maybe if you told us when you lost -- when you lost our baby and got pregnant with Henry's, maybe it would have been okay then. But it's too late.",
        "Henry: Don't say that. Don't say that. You just need some time.",
        "Katie: No, we don't want your baby. And we don't want you in our lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I don't even know what you're talking about.",
        "Dusty: I know you were watching us when Meg came to my room. Nothing happened.",
        "Paul: Really? I'm supposed to believe you?",
        "Dusty: It's the truth.",
        "[Sighs]",
        "Paul: Is this some kind of pre-emptive move to get me to not believe what I saw with my own eyes?",
        "Dusty: What Meg wanted you to see? She's trying to push your buttons. Looks like its working.",
        "Paul: If Meg is scheming, you would never tell me about it.",
        "Dusty: If it would keep her safe, I would.",
        "Paul: Hmm. Oh, you're protecting Meg. Again. I guess the only real question is, are you protecting her by lying, or are you protecting her by telling the truth?",
        "Dusty: I'm here to tell you if you hurt Meg, it's gonna be the last thing you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You don't mean that. You don't mean that. You've been, like, my best friend forever.",
        "Katie: I thought you were mine, too.",
        "Henry: I am, I am, I am. Please. I love you so much, Sweetheart. So does Vienna.",
        "Brad: What you two did to Katie is so far from love.",
        "Henry: Don't, don't. Don't end our friendship over this. Not after everything we've been through together.",
        "Vienna: Please.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Vienna: Let us make it right.",
        "Henry: I know this is my fault. This is all my fault. And if I had just -- if I had been honest about my feelings about the baby in the first place, then I would have saved all this heartache. Okay, but you've got to understand, I never meant to hurt you.",
        "Katie: But you did. Don't you see that? You hurt us both. You let us fall in love with our baby, our baby that was never ours to begin with. You broke our heart.",
        "Vienna: It doesn't have to be this way, Katie. I'm willing to give up my own baby for you.",
        "Katie: But you lied about the most basic, the most sacred thing on earth. How do you come back from that?",
        "Henry: Bubbles, Bubbles, don't do this. Please, please, don't do this. Please.",
        "Brad: You heard my wife. I think it's really important that you two pack your stuff and leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Meg: Paul! What are you doing here? Did you miss your plane?",
        "Paul: You know perfectly well that I didn't go to France.",
        "Meg: Did you call to tell me there was a change of plans?",
        "Paul: There were never any plans to go to Paris. You know that, too.",
        "Meg: You're not making any sense. You're the one who told me you were going to Paris on business. You even invited me.",
        "Paul: Yes, I did. And you said no, didn't you? Because you wanted me to follow you. That's what you wanted, right? You wanted me to do something stupid and destructive so I'd get locked up again, and then you could keep Eliza all to yourself.",
        "Meg: You're wrong.",
        "Paul: Dusty told me all about your little scheme. Dusty. Do you remember Dusty? Dusty is the guy you swore you were never going to see again as long as you were here with me.",
        "Meg: I remember.",
        "Paul: Good. Pack up and get out. You may not be able to keep your word, but I can.",
        "Meg: You don't mean that.",
        "Paul: Yes, I do. Pack up and get out and say good-bye to Eliza, because you are never going to see her again.",
        "Meg: No, you can't do this!",
        "Paul: You think I'm stupid? Do you? I'm not stupid. I had one rule, and you broke it. Now get out.",
        "Meg: I swear to you, nothing happened between me and Dusty.",
        "Paul: Nothing? Nothing? All the late-night phone calls, the sexy underwear, that dress! You went to Dusty's room. All of that, that was nothing?",
        "Meg: That was nothing. Let me prove it to you. Please. What can I do to get you to let me stay here?",
        "Paul: You can beg.",
        "Meg: Please don't do this.",
        "Paul: Don't do what?",
        "Meg: You loved me once. How can you humiliate me like this?",
        "Paul: Every time you kissed him. Every time you touched him, you humiliated me. You knew exactly what you were doing to me.",
        "Meg: Nothing was going on.",
        "Paul: Prove it. Prove to me that nothing was happening. Prove to me that you're sorry for playing with my head. Prove to me that you belong here with me, that you deserve to be part of Eliza's life. No. You can't just look at me with those big, brown, beautiful eyes. You have to talk. I need words.",
        "Meg: I am begging you. Please believe me, nothing happened between me and Dusty.",
        "Paul: If I choose to believe you -- what's next?",
        "Meg: Please let me stay. Don't make me leave Eliza.",
        "Paul: No more. Do you understand me? No more. No more Dusty, real or pretend. Do you understand?",
        "Meg: I understand.",
        "Paul: Then I'll let it all go. For now.",

        "Dusty: I don't have much time. I got to pick up Johnny.",
        "Meg: Oh, oh, yeah. But you had time to talk to Paul, didn't you?",
        "Dusty: I told you, I'm not letting you get hurt.",
        "Meg: Oh, but you hurt me. What's the difference?",
        "Dusty: The difference is you're still alive.",
        "Meg: You think you saved me, Dusty? You just made matters worse. I had to beg Paul to let me stay at Fairwinds, to let me stay a part of my daughter's life. At least when I had a plan, I had hope. Now I don't have anything.",
        "Dusty: That's not true.",
        "Meg: Oh, no. No, thanks to you, I am back to square one. Now, not only does Paul not trust me, I am scared to make the wrong move in fear that he's gonna keep Eliza away from me. What am I gonna do?",
        "Dusty: You have options. You still have a say in what happens to you and your baby.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe I do, but I have to figure that out on my own, because I can't trust you. Not anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: This is what I was afraid of. Of losing our best friends. And we just did.",
        "Henry: I know. I can't bear the thought of it, either.",
        "Vienna: I was gonna go maternity shopping with Katie tomorrow.",
        "Henry: I'll go with you.",
        "Vienna: No. It's not gonna be the same thing.",
        "Henry: I know. I know how you feel.",
        "Vienna: You were getting close to Brad, too.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, I was finally teaching him about the finer gins in life. And Katie is -- Katie is a part of my life. She's always gonna be a part of my life. Just like this baby. And now we don't have to give it up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Listen to me.",
        "[Katie sniffs]",
        "Brad: We don't need them. There's other ways to be parents. I mean, there's tons of babies out there.",
        "Katie: I don't want to talk about other babies. I don't want to think about other babies. I just need to grieve for the one that -- that we didn't even know we lost.",
