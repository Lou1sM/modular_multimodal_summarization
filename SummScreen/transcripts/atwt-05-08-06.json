        "Katie and Mike are pronounced husband and wife, but before they can even make it back up the aisle, Jack is forced to arrest Mike. Margo is upset and confused; Nick thinks Jack has a personal vendetta against him; Mike and Katie are overwhelmed. The reception is then canceled while Mike accompanies Jack to the station. He explains they have a cabbie that can prove Maya was dropped off at Mike's house 1 month after he claimed to have last seen her. She admitted that after that stop she was going to be rich, and the man that opened the door at his house was dark haired. Mike can't explain it, but he is even more dumbfounded when Jack tells him the necklace that was buried with the body had his DNA on it. Katie is supposed to go home with Carly, but decides she can't leave Mike's side and rushes off to be with him. Carly tries to stop her, but Nick interferes and tells her to let her go to her husband. Hal tells Paul that Emily is pregnant, and then they are forced to tell Susan, who doesn't take it well. Paul is sure it is either a mistake or not his. Emily has been unstable for a long time and he doesn't know what she is capable of anymore. Susan tells him based on the hormone level, she is around three weeks pregnant. Paul realizes he is the father, but Susan is unimpressed and still wants him out of Emily's life so he can't ruin her life or her unborn baby's life. Paul is undeterred; he and Emily need to talk to work this out. Emily overhears Paul is still out in the hall, and goes outside to see them fighting about a problem. What is going on, she demands? Barbara tries to befriend Meg, but she also warns that Emily will stop at nothing to get Paul back. Meg vows that she will not let him get hurt; she will stop anyone who tries to do that. Hal sees Barbara and after exchanging unpleasantries this time, he tells her that they need to talk. Jade kisses Holden and Luke walks in and blows up at her. Later, he slowly starts to admit to him that everything with Jade was a lie, which appears to ring true with Holden, who is probably realizing his worst fears about his son are in fact true. When Lily comes in, Luke works up his courage to tell them the truth; he is gay!"

        "Margo: Jack, can we talk?",
        "Nick: No, he doesn't want to talk. He's doing it for his own reasons.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Nick: 'Cause this is personal, Margo. He's trying to get back at me.",
        "Carly: Oh, please!",
        "Mike: Baby, I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: For what? You didn't do anything wrong. Mike did not kill anyone!",

        "[Gasps]",
        "Jade: You believe in me?",
        "Holden: Of course I do. And instead of pining over Luke, what you need to do is start making plans for your future. Decide what you want to do and go for it.",
        "Holden: Jade!",
        "Luke: What the hell are you doing?",
        "Holden: Luke, she's -- she's just upset.",
        "Luke: Upset? Upset? This is how you act when you're upset?",
        "Jade: I don't know why I did that.",
        "Luke: Oh, the hell you don't. You are such a user.",
        "Holden: Luke --",
        "Luke: Dad, you have no idea what she's doing. Or why.",
        "Jade: Do you want me to tell him?",
        "Luke: No, I want you stay out of this.",
        "Holden: Luke, its okay.",
        "Luke: No, no, no. It's not okay. But this is my problem to deal with, by myself. And it is way past time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, it's me. I hope everything's okay at the hospital. I am bringing us home a little treat for later, so don't leave me waiting or the whipped cream will melt.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yum.",
        "Meg: Excuse me.",
        "Barbara: My son does not like whipped cream on his sundaes.",
        "Meg: Well, he's a big boy now, Mom. Things change.",
        "Barbara: You know, I could do without the Mom part, but a \"hello\" would be nice.",
        "Meg: Hello, Barbara. Have a nice night.",
        "Barbara: And what's your hurry, Meg? I take it from that phone call that my son is not at home waiting for you.",
        "Meg: He's taking care of something.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I see. That's fine, as long as the thing is not Emily Stewart.",
        "Meg: Paul and I are doing fine.",
        "Barbara: Good. Are you surprised?",
        "Meg: Yeah, considering our last conversation, you accused me of using Paul to get rid of Dusty, so, yeah, I don't really consider you my cheerleader.",
        "Barbara: But I am. I mean, I could be. I want to be.",
        "Meg: Why does that send chills up my spine?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Is this true?",
        "Hal: I just got confirmation from her doctor. Are you saying that you didn't know?",
        "Paul: I didn't. I swear. Believe me, the last thing I expected was for Emily to be pregnant.",
        "Susan: What are you doing here?",
        "Paul: I got a call.",
        "Susan: Not from anybody on staff, you didn't.",
        "Hal: It was me, Susan. I thought he should know about Emily's condition.",
        "Susan: What about it? Has there been a change? What's wrong? Hey.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Susan: Hi. Did you have a good nap?",
        "Emily: For a while. And then I heard him.",
        "Susan: Who?",
        "Emily: Paul. I can't even take a nap without dreaming about him.",
        "Susan: Well, it's no dream. He's here.",
        "Emily: What? Why? Mom, get rid of him. Make him go away.",
        "Susan: Emily --",
        "Emily: No, just listen to me. I don't want anything to do with Paul ever again.",
        "Hal: I don't think Susan knows.",
        "Paul: No, it doesn't look like it. Maybe it's a mistake.",
        "Hal: I double checked with Dr. Linn. Emily is definitely pregnant.",
        "Paul: I doubt she even knows herself.",
        "Hal: What makes you think that?",
        "Paul: Think about it. Hal, do you honestly think that Emily would throw herself off a cliff if she knew that she were pregnant? How could she not know?",
        "Hal: Must be a honeymoon baby.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Hal: Come on, Paul. You got Emily pregnant. She's carrying your child.",
        "Emily: Mother, make him go away.",
        "Susan: I will. I will, sweetie. But you've got to calm down.",
        "Emily: Why did he come back here? Why?",
        "Susan: I don't know. But he's not going to come in here. That you can be sure of.",
        "Emily: What's wrong with him? What, is he trying to make it harder? You know? I got it. I told him I got it. He's with Meg, I'm all alone, I know. Is he here to rub it in?",
        "Susan: Who knows what he thinks. But you have got to calm down now. Take deep, long breaths. Get that pulse under control, and then I can go out there and kick his butt down the hall.",
        "Paul: You think I'm the father?",
        "Hal: Who else?",
        "Paul: Who knows? God only knows what Emily's been up to these last couple of months.",
        "Hal: Well, I don't think she's had much time for dating, you jerk!",
        "Paul: Well, obviously, there was someone.",
        "Hal: Are you saying you never slept with her? Good God, Paul, the woman was sick and you knew it. What the hell were you thinking?",
        "Paul: What I was thinking was that Dusty was off somewhere dying, and I would do whatever I had to do to get her to trust me. It was the only way I could get her to lead me to him.",
        "Susan: Get out, Paul.",
        "Paul: I would love to. But right now, I can't.",
        "Susan: You need a hand? I'll call security.",
        "Paul: There's a chance -- I feel like I should be here.",
        "Hal: Take a look.",
        "Susan: How did you get Emily's chart?",
        "Hal: Just take a look.",
        "Susan: What? I looked at this an hour ago. There's nothing new.",
        "Hal: On the cover sheet.",
        "Susan: What? This is routine. Blood, allergies -- you didn't. You got her pregnant?",
        "Paul: Whoa. Maybe.",
        "Susan: Maybe?",
        "Paul: Susan, look, the odds are stacked squarely against it, but, yes, there is a slim chance that it's mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I owe you an apology.",
        "Meg: For?",
        "Barbara: Well, obviously, I was wrong about your involvement with Dusty. Clearly, you, too, were also Emily's victim just as he was.",
        "Meg: Not really.",
        "Barbara: Yes, yes. Emily framed you for murder and for kidnapping, she had you thrown in jail. And yet, you saved her life.",
        "Meg: Not really.",
        "Barbara: Jennifer told me what happened after Emily went over the cliff. You saved her life. You are a hero. I admire you.",
        "Meg: Okay, what do you want?",
        "Barbara: Oh, maybe just a few minutes of your company. Sometimes I get tired of being alone.",
        "Meg: I can imagine.",
        "Barbara: I'm sure you can. I'm sure you remember that you, too, were once the town pariah.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I suppose I do.",
        "Barbara: Okay. So let's sit. I also owe you a thank you.",
        "Meg: For what?",
        "Barbara: Reuniting my daughter with her son.",
        "Meg: Eventually.",
        "Barbara: Well, you could have kept the truth to yourself. I mean, you had Dusty. Jennifer was getting over her loss. You could have kept your mouth shut. You had made it all work. But no, you blew the lid off the whole mess -- voluntarily.",
        "Meg: That must confuse the hell out of you.",
        "Barbara: No, no. I recognize courage when I see it.",
        "[Meg laughs]",
        "Meg: Oh, come on.",
        "Barbara: No, I mean it.",
        "Meg: Right. What do you want from me?",
        "Barbara: Nothing.",
        "Meg: Then it's Paul. You want something from Paul, and you're going to use me to get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Whatever you and Jade are fighting about, I don't want it to put you back in the hospital. You're both very stressed out right now. You're saying things that you don't mean. You're doing things that you don't mean.",
        "Jade: I'm sorry, Holden.",
        "Luke: Oh, that is such a lie! She's not sorry.",
        "Jade: When did you get so cruel?",
        "Luke: This is all just act, Dad! She just doesn't want her free ride to end. She doesn't care what happens to me at all!",
        "Jade: That's not true.",
        "Luke: Dad, I have something that I need to talk to you about.",
        "Jade: You don't want to do this, Luke.",
        "Luke: Leave us alone.",
        "Holden: All right, go back to the house. I don't want you getting yourself all worked up about this.",
        "Luke: No, but I am worked up. But it doesn't have anything to do with her. This is all me. I need to talk to you and Mom right now.",
        "Holden: Go back to the house. I'm right behind you.",
        "Luke: Don't believe a word that comes out of this girl's mouth.",
        "Holden: Do you want to tell me what that was all about?",
        "Jade: You want me off the property.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, I think it's time.",
        "Jade: Well, can I just have a few minutes just to get my stuff together?",
        "Holden: I need to go see my son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: It's a vendetta, Margo.",
        "Margo: Oh, will you get over yourself? Jack is not that kind of cop.",
        "Mike: I asked you to tell me if it was okay to get married.",
        "Katie: You did? When?",
        "Jack: I asked you some things, too, Mike.",
        "Mike: And I answered them.",
        "Nancy: Do you know what this is all about?",
        "Kim: Well, not really. Katie?",
        "Katie: It's nothing. It's just a big mistake.",
        "Margo: Can we have a word here?",
        "Jack: There's a unit outside waiting.",
        "Mike: I'm not going to try and run.",
        "Jack: I meant, if you wanted to wait outside instead of in here with all these people.",
        "Mike: Okay, I can't leave her with this. Not yet.",
        "Jack: I'll be right back.",
        "Katie: So this must have something to do with the skeleton that was found in Jack and Carly's basement, but I didn't know that they had figured anything out. I mean, obviously, they're wrong if they think that Mike had anything to do with killing that person.",
        "Kim: Oh, of course he didn't!",
        "Bob: Well, obviously it's some kind of a mix-up.",
        "Kim: They're going to get it straightened out.",
        "Nancy: I'm just sorry it had to happen today.",
        "Katie: I know. I just -- I don't even know what to do.",
        "Mike: Katie. I want you to start the reception, go back to the house. Okay?",
        "Katie: No, no, we'll wait. I mean, then we can all go together.",
        "Mike: Baby, please take our guests back to the house.",
        "Nick: I can wait with Mike.",
        "Katie: No, we'll all wait. It's a big misunderstanding. Tom and Margo are going to figure it out. We'll all wait. Is that okay?",
        "Bob: Of course we'll wait.",
        "Kim: Absolutely. You know, the caterer will love it if it gives him some breathing room.",
        "Katie: Right. I did rush him a little bit, didn't I? And this will give him time to make the cake the way I wanted it.",
        "Henry: Maybe -- maybe Kim and Nancy should go ahead over and help supervise.",
        "Katie: We can all go together in a minute.",
        "Henry: I know, but Nancy -- she needs a martini and to get off her feet, even though she won't admit it.",
        "Mike: You know, he's right.",
        "Katie: Got it. Maybe -- could you go over to the cottage and make sure that everything's okay?",
        "Kim: Of course.",
        "Bob: Sure. Just give us a call and we'll uncork the champagne.",
        "Nancy: You make a beautiful bride, darling.",
        "Kim: We'll see you later, sweetheart.",
        "Katie: Thank you so much. You've all been so wonderful.",
        "Bob: We'll go out through --",
        "Kim: Okay.",
        "Bob: Okay, Mom.",
        "Mike: I'm so sorry.",
        "Katie: For what? You didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Margo: No, what is it, Jack? Because you better have a damn good reason for ruining my little sister's wedding.",
        "Jack: You think I wanted to ruin their wedding?",
        "Margo: Well, you did it today.",
        "Jack: Because there's an arrest warrant out on Mike.",
        "Tom: My office did not issue a warrant.",
        "Jack: Yes, they did, Tom. An hour ago. An ADA filed. They weren't too happy to hear about a possible honeymoon. Now, Mike and Katie weren't planning to go away, were they?",
        "Margo: No! I don't know. I mean, they planned this wedding in one day.",
        "Jack: Pretty impulsive, even for Katie, don't you think?",
        "Margo: Well, impulsive, yes. But suspicious? No. What's gotten into you, Jack?",
        "Tom: Look, if this is you covering your back, I don't blame you. But at least tell us.",
        "Jack: I am playing this by the book, yes, Tom. I'm also following the evidence.",
        "Tom: Okay, what do you got?",
        "Jack: That's a lab report. There's more.",
        "Katie: This is all gonna get cleared up. And then you and I are gonna go back home and have eternal spring hors d'oeuvres and champagne and wedding cake in our garden.",
        "Mike: I want you to do that no matter what.",
        "Katie: Would you stop it, Mike? This is a mistake. Or it's Jack just being super careful because he got in trouble before.",
        "Mike: You don't even want to ask?",
        "Katie: I don't have to. If there was something to tell, you'd tell me, right? See, I know my husband.",
        "Margo: Okay, but we're talking about Mike here. Mike Kasnoff. I mean, can you even imagine him doing such a thing?",
        "Jack: The Mike we know now, no way. But Mike back then?",
        "Tom: He was on parole.",
        "Jack: I can't imagine Mike stealing either, Margo. But he did. Truth is, we don't know what he was capable of.",
        "Henry: Okay, Lenny will take your call directly if you need him.",
        "Katie: Who?",
        "Henry: He's a bail bondsman and a lousy poker player, and he knows I'm good for the cash.",
        "Mike: You're what?",
        "Henry: If you need money for bail, for a trial, I got you covered.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Henry: I gotta go.",
        "Katie: Aren't you coming to the reception? We'll be there soon.",
        "Henry: Yeah, just give me a call when it gets started.",
        "Mike: Thanks, man. You already saved the day by performing the ceremony.",
        "Henry: It's my privilege. I'll see you guys soon.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Carly: What are you up to?",
        "Nick: Protecting my cousin from your ex.",
        "Carly: Nick, how many people have to tell you? Jack would never use Mike to try and get back at you.",
        "Katie: Oh, finally! Now can we please go celebrate?",
        "Margo: Mike, I'm afraid you're gonna have to go to the station with Jack. I'm sorry, honey.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Dad -- Dad, I am so sorry. This is all my fault.",
        "Holden: You are not responsible for Jade's behavior.",
        "Luke: No, I am -- I am. I'm the only reason that she's here. This whole thing it's just so -- I can't believe she tried to kiss you.",
        "Holden: You know what? People -- I don't know, they do crazy things after breakups. And how about you? I mean, this was your first real relationship. It must be tough on you. It was probably Jade's first real relationship as well.",
        "Luke: Dad, the only thing that's tough on Jade is finding another place to live. There was no breakup.",
        "Holden: Sure looks like a breakup to me.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but that's all what it was looks. There was no breakup because there was no relationship.",
        "Holden: Okay, so maybe Jade wasn't the one. You learn from experience. There will be other girls.",
        "Luke: No, Dad. There won't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I can't believe I missed it. But I wasn't looking for pregnancy.",
        "Hal: Emily didn't say anything?",
        "Susan: No. She doesn't know, I'm sure of it. Oh, there it is.",
        "Paul: Okay, there is no proof that that's my baby. And like I was saying to Hal, Emily's been very unstable lately. She's been acting very needy.",
        "Hal: Watch it.",
        "Paul: Well, it's true. There's no telling where she's been. Let alone who she's --",
        "Susan: Hey!",
        "Hal: Steady.",
        "Paul: All I'm trying to say to you is that Emily has taken a lot of risks lately. I mean, did you ever think that she would chain a man to a wall and watch as he bled to death?",
        "Susan: Do you think she slept with another man after you got married?",
        "Paul: No, of course not.",
        "Susan: Did you sleep with Emily after you got married?",
        "Paul: Once.",
        "Susan: That's all it took, pal. Her -- her hormone levels show a very, very early pregnancy. Three weeks at most.",
        "Paul: Are you sure.",
        "Susan: Yes! Unlike the two of you, I can read blood results.",
        "Paul: I'm a father.",
        "Susan: You got her pregnant. It takes a hell of a lot more than that to be a father.",
        "Paul: But --",
        "Susan: No buts! Just get out of here! She doesn't want you anywhere near her.",
        "Paul: That was before, Susan --",
        "Susan: This changes nothing. Go!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Holden: Luke has something that he needs to tell us.",
        "Paul: How about we tell Emily about this pregnancy together?",
        "Emily: Paul? What are you still doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: This whole thing with Jade was a scam.",
        "Holden: You mean, how she got here?",
        "Luke: I mean everything between us. We weren't in love.",
        "Holden: Maybe it wasn't --",
        "Luke: We never slept together. There was nothing between us.",
        "Holden: You told your mom and me that --",
        "Luke: I know. I lied. So, are you gonna ask?",
        "Holden: You said that you had something to tell me. So I assume you will.",
        "Luke: I don't need to, do I? Because -- because you already know.",
        "Holden: I don't know anything. I've wondered about a lot of things.",
        "Luke: But you never asked. Because you didn't want to know, and I understand that.",
        "Holden: Well good, because I don't. I love you. You're my son. That never changes.",
        "Luke: Yeah?",
        "Holden: Yeah. It's just you and me. Tell me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Here we go. I had that cute little barista make yours all over again and give you extra whipped cream.",
        "Meg: Thanks, I think.",
        "Barbara: Well, I enjoy taking care of people. I think it's probably why I love being a mom. It is the greatest job in the world.",
        "Meg: So I hear.",
        "Barbara: Thankless, but still the greatest.",
