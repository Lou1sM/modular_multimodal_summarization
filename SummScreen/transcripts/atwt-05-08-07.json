        "Emily: All I know is when Alison stepped off that elevator with Paul, every fiber in my body screamed danger.",
        "Dusty: She said they just bumped into each other?",
        "Emily: Yeah, she said that she chased him down to tell him what a rat he was. I'm the one who smelled the rat.",
        "Dusty: Why do you think she's lying?",
        "Emily: Because when I talked to Paul, their stories didn't match.",
        "Dusty: What did he say?",
        "Emily: Practically nothing.",
        "Dusty: So they're both hiding something.",
        "Emily: All I know is, the only response he had to all my questions was, \"Back off, Emily. Trust me.\"",
        "Dusty: So, how does your sister fit in?",
        "Emily: He says whatever they're working on, she won't get hurt.",
        "Dusty: If she's involved with Paul Ryan, she's gonna get slammed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Waitress: That's just nasty.",
        "Alison: Huh?",
        "Waitress: Around here, they don't go for getting back at customers by contaminating their food.",
        "Alison: Why don't you mind your business?",
        "Waitress: I'm just letting you know. If a manager sees you, it will get you fired.",
        "Alison: It's my coffee, okay? I'm not trying to poison anyone. And if I want your advice, I'll ask for it.",
        "Waitress: Table three's asking about their order.",
        "Alison: Well, I don't cook the food, I just serve it when it's ready, which it's not. So, either they can wait, or they can go back and yell at the kitchen themselves, but I'm not bringing it up with Jimmy. Hey, Jesse, it's me, Ali.",
        "Jesse: What's up, Sweetcakes?",
        "Alison: You feel like stopping by the diner? I miss you.",
        "Jesse: Oh, yeah?",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah. A visit from you would make me really perk up. And I'll make it worth your while.",
        "Jesse: Uhh, you know, I'm not in the mood for a burger, Baby, and I don't do house calls.",
        "Alison: Not even for me?",
        "Jesse: Sorry. No exceptions. You know where I am. You want what I got? Come for it.",
        "Alison: I'll be back!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. Then Alison starts blabbering about how Emily saw the two of you together.",
        "Paul: Well, it's just bad timing.",
        "Lucinda: What were you doing in the elevator? I thought you were going to be more careful.",
        "Paul: I didn't know that Emily was going to be downstairs.",
        "Lucinda: How did you explain what you were doing with her sister?",
        "Paul: I just told Emily that Alison and I were doing something, and that Alison was perfectly safe. Emily did have some questions.",
        "Lucinda: I bet she did, yeah.",
        "Paul: But I didn't give her anything.",
        "Lucinda: How did you get rid of her?",
        "Paul: I told her to trust me and to back off.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Lucinda: That's like a carrot on a end of a stick. We are never going to get rid of Emily now.",
        "Paul: Okay. Hey. Relax, okay? Emily has no idea why Alison and I are doing anything together, and your name never came up and neither did Craig's.",
        "Lucinda: Well, that's good --",
        "Paul: You got to give me some credit.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I just think the damn thing is inedibly sloppy. Because if Emily breathes a word --",
        "Paul: She won't.",
        "Lucinda: She does not owe you any loyalty, you know? Not anymore.",
        "Paul: I'm not so sure about that. But even if she does decide to talk, it doesn't make any difference. If we get done what we need to get done, then it'll all be over before everybody even bothers to listen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: From what Paul said, Rosanna was more than willing to help anyone who had a score to settle with you.",
        "Craig: I thought you didn't put much faith in Paul's version of things.",
        "Meg: When he comes to me --",
        "Craig: Oh, I see. But you're all ears when he's trashing me.",
        "Meg: Look, I didn't say I believed him. I'm just trying to fill you in. He has his own theory about Rosanna's accident --",
        "Craig: So, despite having hallucinations of the future, now, he's what? He's rewriting the past?",
        "Meg: He told me that Rosanna was the one who figured out you switched Gwen's baby for Jennifer's baby so you could keep Johnny, and she was going to bust you for it.",
        "Craig: What else?",
        "Meg: He said that's the reason you ran her off the road.",
        "Craig: She did that to herself. She was driving like a lunatic.",
        "Meg: And were you the reason she was panicking?",
        "Craig: I don't know.",
        "Meg: You know, we haven't talked about this before. But the way you're acting now, it looks like you do feel responsible for Rosanna's accident. And I'm just wondering, is that the reason why you don't want her to come home?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lynn: Put a hand on her, and you're a dead man.",
        "Katie: Is she kidding?",
        "Brad: I don't think so.",
        "Lynn: Look at you, Brad. Still so handsome. I knew I'd see you again. I just didn't know when or where. And all of a sudden, you show up here with TV crew and your sidekick.",
        "Katie: But we're just co-stars.",
        "Lynn: Do I care? I was talking to Brad. So I couldn't let you leave without saying hello.",
        "Brad: Well, maybe the hello would go better without the gun.",
        "Lynn: You still have that smart mouth even when you're not on TV. Maybe it's time someone shut it for you.",
        "Brad: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, but let's not get crazy. Why don't just you and I, let's just go somewhere --",
        "Lynn: You're not going anywhere, Sweetheart, until you pay for ruining my life. Did I say anyone could move?",
        "Brad: Okay --",
        "Lynn: Sit down, Sidekick!",
        "Katie: I'm Katie. And you are?",
        "Lynn: Locked and loaded. Sit!",
        "Brad: We will. We will. Just take it easy. Waving a gun around like that isn't real smart.",
        "Lynn: Yeah, I did a few things with you that weren't very smart. You seem very okay with that at the time.",
        "Brad: We were young. It was dark.",
        "Lynn: I was very dumb.",
        "Brad: Look, because we had some good times?",
        "Lynn: Does it look like I'm remembering anything good? After you left, my life feel apart.",
        "Katie: Who is she, and what did you do to her?",
        "Brad: Let me handle this.",
        "Lynn: You're going to handle me? Don't try anything, Brad. I'm warning you.",
        "Brad: No, no, no, no, no. I just meant that it's not her problem.",
        "Lynn: Oh, but it will be. You're getting ready to do a number on her, too, huh? Go on, Brad. Tell her how you operate.",
        "Brad: Katie doesn't need to hear this --",
        "Lynn: First, there's this sweet come on. Oh, but I think she does. She should know that loving you for even one day is enough to trash her whole world.",
        "Brad: It doesn't -- come on, Hon, I mean, how is that going to help you?",
        "Lynn: Hon? Oh, my God, you don't even know my name!",
        "Brad: Look, I remember your face. I mean, how can I -- how I can resist a gorgeous face like that? I know we had a thing.",
        "Lynn: A thing? What's my name? Say it!",
        "Brad: Jill.",
        "Lynn: Lynn. You called me Lady Lynn. What else have you forgotten?",
        "Brad: Look, I'm sorry.",
        "Lynn: Don't move!",
        "Brad: Okay, okay. Look, it's not personal. I just -- I have a horrible memory. Ask anybody.",
        "Lynn: You told me I was the most beautiful angel you'd ever seen.",
        "Brad: Well sure, look at you.",
        "Lynn: Don't. We were in deer's head inn, and I was playing darts. You came up to me because you heard me laughing. I was wearing a blue blouse that my husband gave me and my favorite pair of jeans. Any of this coming back to you?",
        "Brad: I wish I could say it was, but I'm not going to lie.",
        "Lynn: I guess you told enough lies to last a lifetime that night. How I made you believe in love at first sight. How the touch of my hand was like fire?",
        "Brad: Lynn --",
        "Lynn: That's right! Lynn. I told you that I wasn't interested. That I was married. You kept saying nothing was sexier than a woman who knew how to commit.",
        "Brad: It was one night.",
        "Lynn: So you do remember.",
        "Brad: We never saw each other again.",
        "Lynn: Yeah, was that how you planned it? When you took me to your pickup, and we made love, you were so tender. God, it didn't feel dirty. It felt wild and free and alive.",
        "Brad: So that's a good thing, right?",
        "Lynn: You already said good-bye to me!",
        "Brad: I guess we -- I thought we had an understanding.",
        "Lynn: Here's what I understood. We were falling in love. You said that you could see staying right here and living with me. Because certainty like this comes once in a lifetime.",
        "Brad: I probably meant that in the moment.",
        "Lynn: Yeah, and after that moment, I went and I told my husband I was leaving him for a man -- a man who knew how to love. I broke his heart for you, Brad. And you were gone by the time the sun came up.",
        "Brad: I didn't know. I didn't know.",
        "Lynn: And I didn't know what happened to you. I imagined all kinds of emergencies, tragedies. You didn't have my phone number, I didn't have yours. I moved out of my house, and I waited for you, because certainty like this comes once in a lifetime.",
        "Brad: You were that certain?",
        "Lynn: Yeah, until I read \"The Bridges of Madison County.\" I realized I had thrown away my whole life for a line in a book! I felt like such a fool. I was nothing to you but a one-night stand!",
        "Brad: Lynn? I'm sorry. I mean that. I was so messed up that the only thing I cared about was having a good time. I was such a selfish jerk. I'm not like that anymore.",
        "Lynn: So, I'm just part of some old life that you're trying to forget?",
        "Brad: No, I don't want to be that person anymore -- a user. You know, I understand if you want to get back at me, but I wouldn't hurt you that way now. I've changed.",
        "Lynn: You seem the same to me.",
        "Brad: No, I'm not. Look, I promise. I'm learning to look after other people. That's why I want you to give me the gun before there's an accident.",
        "Lynn: Do you think you're a better person now?",
        "Brad: I'm trying to be.",
        "Lynn: Why? Is she the reason?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Where's Alison right now?",
        "Emily: At the diner working the lunch shift.",
        "Dusty: You gotta get her to tell you what she's up to with Paul.",
        "Emily: How am I going to do that, Dusty?",
        "Dusty: You caught her in a lie. Call her out on it.",
        "Emily: Yeah, that's not going to be very easy.",
        "Dusty: Well, she's your sister. You'll know what to do.",
        "Emily: Yeah, you'd think. Things don't matter to Alison the way they used to. You know what? Maybe I could get her to open up if she believes that Paul spilled his secret to me?",
        "Dusty: You think?",
        "Emily: I don't know. It's worth a try, right?",
        "Dusty: Okay. And I'll see what I can do on my end.",
        "Emily: How? Why? What?",
        "Dusty: I'll tell you when I get the results.",
        "Emily: Okay, what, what -- we don't know what we're stepping into, okay? So, can you do me a favor? Can you watch your back?",
        "Dusty: You, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Jesse: You made good time.",
        "Alison: I didn't want to keep you waiting.",
        "Jesse: So, you're just thinking of me, huh? All my customers should be so considerate.",
        "Alison: Well, I really appreciate you going out of your way, Jesse. You're a special guy.",
        "Jesse: Are you coming onto me? 'Cause it won't help you get a better deal.",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no ulterior motives. Just being friendly.",
        "Jesse: Well, that's funny. Because the last time we did business, you weren't this friendly. And you know what else? And I don't like it when people blow hot and cold.",
        "Alison: Are you saying you don't trust me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: If Meg can get Craig to admit to attempted murder, then this whole thing is over, as you say, today. But if he doesn't rise to the --",
        "Paul: Look, why don't we burn that bridge when we get to it?",
        "Lucinda: I just don't want us to wing things, for heaven's sake. If Meg fails, then we haven't hurt Craig, and we're right back where we started.",
        "Paul: I have a back-up plan.",
        "Lucinda: Scuttle it. Scuttle it. If Emily knows -- she knows that you and Alison are hooked up doing something. She's going to poke around and poke around until she finds out what it is you're up to --",
        "Paul: So, I'll just have to come up with a cover story for Alison.",
        "Lucinda: That's a terrible idea. I mean, I don't know how many balls that girl can keep in the air at once. I think the girl is maxed out. It's Emily -- Emily concerns me.",
        "Paul: It's Meg that concerns me. She's with Craig right now. What if Craig figures out that she's wearing a wire?",
        "Lucinda: She can handle that.",
        "Paul: You and I both know firsthand what Craig is capable of if he feels wronged. He will demand his pound of flesh, and I don't want it to come from Meg.",
        "Lucinda: Then you better hope and pray that Craig spills before Emily finds out. Let me know, please, when Meg gets back with the wire. I want to finish this.",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Why should I feel responsible for what happened to Rosanna?",
        "Meg: It's obviously painful for you to talk about it.",
        "Craig: It was a painful event. It was hell seeing what happened to her. That doesn't mean that I caused it.",
        "Meg: I'm just telling you what Paul thinks. You can't be surprised that it's negative.",
        "Craig: You know what? Actually, this is not doing a whole lot for my state of mind, and maybe it'd be better if you just left me alone.",
        "Meg: Hey, hey, hey. You didn't leave me alone when I lost my job or my nursing license. You saw how guilt-ridden I was for causing that patient's death, and you refused to let me wallow in it. I'm just trying to do the same for you.",
        "Craig: But I don't feel guilty. I've just been on the receiving end of a few crank calls.",
        "Meg: That you thought could be from Rosanna.",
        "Craig: At first, but after the initial shock wore off, I realized how preposterous that is. Why dwell on it?",
        "Meg: Okay. But whoever those calls are coming from, they were designed to rattle you, and its working. You're not at the office. You're not running the company. Instead you're here tossing back drinks.",
        "Craig: I needed a little time to regroup.",
        "Meg: I understand. It's a lot to process, but I don't think what's getting to you is the idea that somebody's trying to gaslight you. I think it's that little voice in your head that says, \"This might actually be real.\"",
        "Craig: I didn't do anything to Rosanna. I certainly didn't try to kill her.",
        "Meg: And yet someone's pulling out all the stops to set you up?",
        "Craig: Like you said yourself, I have legions of enemies. It's why I trust no one.",
        "Meg: Including me. You know, I don't know why I try to understand you!",
        "Craig: All right, what is that? What is that about?",
        "Meg: I have been going out of my way to show you that I don't think the worst of you, and you're not returning the favor, and it's quite clear that you never will. And you know what? It's a relief because even if one ounce of what Paul says you did to Rosanna is true, then I don't wanna know. I don't wanna keep your secret or carry your burden. This is between you and your conscience, and it can stay that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Hi, is Alison here?",
        "Waitress: Nope, she took off.",
        "Emily: For the day?",
        "Waitress: Who knows? She does what she wants.",
        "Emily: Did she say where she was going, or who she was meeting?",
        "Waitress: She barely talks to me -- unless she wants help.",
        "Emily: Well, maybe she -- maybe she told somebody else.",
        "Waitress: That would be way too responsible for Alison. How well do you know her?",
        "Emily: Ah, I'm her sister, actually.",
        "Waitress: Oh, sorry. Look, I'm not trying to dis your sister, but Alison kind of comes and goes.",
        "Emily: She's done this before?",
        "Waitress: Wanna wait and see if she shows up?",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah, I'll wait for a while. Thank you.",
        "Waitress: Get yourself comfortable. I'll bring you some coffee.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jesse: So where you running off too?",
        "Alison: Where else? My brilliant career at the local diner. Every girl's dream.",
        "Jesse: Yeah, it does seem like a waste of a great high.",
        "Alison: Well, I'll try not to let the egg salad kill my buzz. Maybe you should stop by and see me in action one of these days.",
        "Jesse: Maybe some other time. [Cell phone ringing] What, you're not gonna answer that?",
        "Alison: It's my sister. Wonder, where I am? What am I doing? She never lets up, and I'm really not in the mood. Anyway, it's play time.",
        "Jesse: If you say so.",
        "Alison: Oh, I've earned it.",
        "Jesse: That ought to get ya where you're going? It's too bad you gotta party alone.",
        "Alison: Maybe I don't. Feel like joining me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Oh, come on, Meg. Call.",
        "[Knocking]",
        "Dusty: You got a minute?",
        "Paul: Actually, I'm late for something.",
        "Dusty: You meeting someone? Anyone I know?",
        "Paul: No, I don't think so.",
        "Dusty: What are you up to, Ryan?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lynn: No phone calls!",
        "Brad: How about -- how about you put the gun on table, Lynn?",
        "Lynn: That would be a no! Looks like your boyfriend can't talk his way out of this one, huh?",
        "Katie: No, we're just partners on the show. That's as far as it goes.",
        "Lynn: What I walked in on didn't look like work to me!",
        "Katie: Well, I don't know what it looked like, but I am not romantically interested in Brad at all.",
        "Lynn: You were about to kiss him!",
        "Brad: I made the first move if it matters.",
        "Lynn: So you are into her? Has he told you you're the only woman for him? That he can't think about anybody else? That's one of his favorite lines!",
        "Brad: Lynn, Lynn -- look! You believe people can change right? That they make mistakes, and they can learn from them?",
        "Lynn: Some mistakes can't be fixed.",
        "Brad: Okay, well, if you're talking about your husband, maybe it wasn't a mistake. I mean, if you were that unhappy with the guy, then maybe its better that you broke him, now you're free to fall in love.",
        "Lynn: What, are you a shrink? Is this something he learned from you?",
        "Katie: I barely know him!",
        "Lynn: But you're willing to risk getting shot to help him, huh? Meanwhile, what's he done for you?",
        "Katie: Reminding me not to take life so seriously?",
        "Lynn: I think it's time he gets very serious.",
        "Brad: I am. I am. Lynn, if we were to meet today for the first time, things would have gone down in a totally different way. I wouldn't hurt you like I did or walk out on you.",
        "Lynn: Yeah, well, you did. And I lost my house, my husband! My whole family thinks I'm a tramp!",
        "Brad: I wish I could make it up to you.",
        "Lynn: Maybe you can. I lost someone. Now it's your turn!",
        "[Gunshot]",
        "[Katie screaming]",
        "[Jack breaks into the room]",
        "Jack: You're under arrest!",
        "Officer: An attorney will be provided for you. Do you understand your rights?",
        "Lynn: I guess.",
        "Katie: Are you okay, Jack? You didn't get hurt, did you?",
        "Jack: No, no, I'm just glad that nobody else did, either.",
        "Officer: I'll be back to take your statement.",
        "Brad: I guess we should wait here.",
        "Jack: Yeah, they're not gonna take any time to process her, Brad.",
        "Brad: I owe you.",
        "Jack: Hey, timing's everything.",
        "Brad: Yours couldn't have been better.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I thought you were on your way to the airport.",
        "Jack: I was. I was halfway there when, I don't know, something told me to turn around. I don't know what you wanna call it. I'm just glad I got here in time.",
        "Brad: Well, you and me both. Okay, I'm gonna say something you'll probably never hear me say again. You were right, I was wrong, I shouldn't have taken -- I shouldn't have been so casual with those threats.",
        "Jack: When they mention death, I pay attention.",
        "Katie: Wait, hold on, you knew there was a threat against Brad?",
        "Jack: No, not exactly. Kim got a call from an angry woman. We didn't know if it was a bid for attention or the real thing.",
        "Katie: When did this happen?",
        "Brad: Right after we left to come here.",
        "Katie: Somebody called you and threatened your life?",

        "Katie: Thanks for the vote of confidence.",
        "Brad: Look, I'm sorry. I didn't take it serious. I never thought I could make a woman angry enough to wanna blow me away.",
        "Katie: Well, if I'd have known I could've told you not to underestimate yourself.",
        "Brad: Look, when the show was over, I thought everything was in the clear. You know, I never imagined that your life would be in danger, too.",
        "Katie: Oh, okay. And what about you, Jack? You thought I would be so fragile I couldn't handle something like this.",
        "Jack: No, wait. This was Bradington's call. I left the decision up to him.",
        "Katie: Oh, I think I hate this.",
        "Brad: Okay, look, you were so psyched about the show I was just trying to protect you. I promise. I promise you if any crazy lady is gonna pull a gun on me in the future, it's gonna be you and only you, okay?",

        "Paul: As usual, Emily is over-reacting. Alison's a lot tougher than she looks.",
        "Dusty: Why is she involved with you?",
        "Paul: Look, if Emily wants to know what Alison is thinking, Emily should just ask Alison. Why don't you get out?",

        "Paul: Dusty, would it really be so bad for Alison to have a little bit of money?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it would 'cause Alison's on drugs. She's using crystal meth like your sister used to, so if you're giving her money, that's where it's going. It's feeding her habit. Is that what you want?",

        "Alison: I cut my finger, and we didn't have any band-aids so I went to the pharmacy.",

        "Alison: Emily, hi.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Alison: No, I sliced myself real bad, and there was much blood I was afraid it was gonna drip into somebody's plate.",
        "Emily: Why didn't you call me? Let me see. Maybe you need stitches.",
        "Waitress: When exactly did this happen?",
        "Alison: You were in the back, and I figured I should just take care of it myself before customers start passing out, or otherwise I wouldn't have left without telling you.",

        "Emily: So, you nearly bled to death, but now you're okay.",

        "Emily: Well, she had to do your job and hers. What do you want? A hug? Why don't you pick up your phone? I tried calling you.",
        "Alison: Because when I'm doing nothing wrong, I get a little tired of you constantly checking in on me.",
        "Emily: I am so tired of you covering up what you're doing here. Did you cut your finger, or did you meet Paul to work on this little project of his?",

        "Dusty: She's helping you? She's helping you? You got her involved with Craig? Have you lost your mind?",
        "Paul: Well, there's no direct involvement. I mean, Alison hasn't been in the same room as Craig, and she never will be.",
        "Dusty: That's correct, 'cause from now on, Alison's off-limits to you. You got it?",
        "Paul: No, Dusty, you have to let me finish what I've started. I need Alison to do that.",
        "Dusty: Did you hear what I just said?",
        "Paul: Yes, I did, but you have to let me and Alison cooperate for just another little while longer.",
        "Dusty: Why is that?",

        "Emily: Were you with Paul?",
        "Alison: I've told you a million times, no! What are you gonna do next? Put me on a leash?",
        "Emily: Alison, I don't like this anymore than you do, but you're not giving me much choice here.",
        "Alison: Oh, please. You so get off on being superior. Why do you even ask me anything? You're still gonna just go behind my back and check on me anyway.",
        "Emily: You haven't given me a choice.",
        "Alison: So, you talked to Paul?",
        "Emily: Yes, I did. This morning. He told me what you two were doing.",
        "Alison: Now how could he do that when there's nothing to tell?",
        "Emily: Listen to me. I know. How far has it gone, Alison, and can you still get out if you want to?",
        "Alison: I guess.",
        "Emily: Okay, well then you need to. You need to because there are already too many people involved, and this cannot stay underground for long.",
        "Alison: So, Paul told you about the letters?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I mean, eventually, he did.",
        "Alison: He gave me his word he'd never mention them.",
        "Emily: See? That's how much you can trust Paul.",
        "Alison: No, it's you I can't trust. There are no letters. There never were. I'm so sick of this, Emily! You are constantly accusing me of lying, and then you go and tell lies whenever you want!",
        "Emily: Sorry, okay! You know, I'm sorry, it's just too bad. I talked to Paul, and he wouldn't give me any details. But he told me what the two of you are up to, he told me you're working together.",
        "Alison: And you'd take his word over mine.",
        "Emily: You cannot trust Paul! Do you understand me? You get involved with him, it's gonna come back to bite you, Alison.",
        "Alison: This is great. Paul almost drives you to commit suicide, and then he walks away from you and your dead baby, but you take his word over mine.",
        "Emily: No, I would rather your word, but you won't give it to me. Now, listen, you could try to push me away, you could try to change the subject, but I'm telling you right now it's not gonna work. Do you hear me?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.",
        "Emily: No, no, you say whatever you want, okay? But just so we're clear, whatever Paul did or didn't do to me, right now, he's not the one lying. So do I believe him? Yeah. Where's that leave you, Ali?",

        "Meg: Well, it's just a matter of time. Craig was close to admitting what happened. He wants to ease his conscience.",
        "Lucinda: Then why didn't he do it?",
        "Meg: Well, you heard him. He's afraid to trust me with something incriminating, but he will.",

        "Paul: The only mistake we could make is to stop. We keep going, we'll wear Craig down.",

        "Lucinda: Well, I mean, that's very tempting, the whole thought, but I don't think that's what we should do. Look, Meg can continue with her magic -- fine. But you and I, we have got to halt our activities.",

        "Lucinda: We don't want Craig tracing phone calls, pumping Alison -- we don't want that! So, we should do nothing for a few days and just wait.",
        "Paul: No. That gives Craig time to investigate, and that's exactly what he wants. It takes away our element of surprise, which is the only really strong weapon that we have.",
        "Lucinda: Wait a minute for heaven's sake. We have Meg.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but how long before Craig gets angry at her? Or suspicious? Or both? No, if this is gonna work, we're gonna do it my way, and we're gonna do it now!",
