        "Paul walked in on Rose and Dusty kissing. After an argument, they broke up. At the station, Jack gave Paul information showing that Barbara had been paying Dusty's way even before he came into town. Rose arrived to the opening of The Roller Palace late and shared a few kisses with Dusty. Paul came in with the information that proved she had been set up by Paul and Barbara. Carly heard thumps in the house while preparing dinner for Jack. He suggested that she leave the house. When they returned home, Henry Coleman was in the house hiding out because he didn't have the funds to leave town. After Sierra told Craig that she was taking Lucy and Aaron to Montega, he decided to bend and let the young couple see each other in Oakdale. This infuriated Rosanna so badly, she packed her bags."

        "Molly: Hey, Mike, it's me. I just wanted to let you know I'm at Al's picking up some dinner for us. And I'll see you soon. Bye.",
        "Waitress: Can I take your order?",
        "Molly: Yeah, thanks, Jill. I'm thinking two double cheeseburgers, bacon, avocado. On the rare side, okay? And extra mayo. A big heaping tin of fries.",
        "Brackett: Good evening, Mrs. McKinnon.",
        "Molly: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Brackett: I just wanted to have a little chat. Excuse us, please. Why don't we -- why don't we have a seat over in the corner? The bureau still wants you to be nice to Mr. Donovan. Our entire case hangs in the balance.",
        "Molly: Tell me again why that's my problem?",
        "Brackett: Because the FBI can choose to make your life easy or not.",
        "Molly: Meaning what?",
        "Brackett: Well, let's see. You've -- you've had an interesting life, Mrs. McKinnon. Accessory to robbery, lying to a police officer, jail time, an affair with a convicted felon.",
        "Molly: Are you threatening me?",
        "Brackett: \"Threaten\" is a strong word. But it would be unfortunate if this information were to make it to the Press.",
        "Molly: Press? You go ahead. Give it your best shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: There's no room for three in this marriage, so take your pick.",
        "Craig: Well, you're the one I married, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: Then why do I feel Carly and her truckload of baggage between us?",
        "Craig: That's a very good question. Why do you? I didn't bring her up.",
        "Rosanna: It's your fault. It's your timing, Craig.",
        "Craig: I came home for you, Rosanna. How many times do I have to say that?",
        "Rosanna: You had to come home just in time for Carly's big moment. You couldn't wait until after the Lakeview fashion show?",
        "Craig: Here are the keys to Monte Carlo. The company is yours.",
        "Rosanna: You're just gonna have your assistant make you a second set in an hour.",
        "Craig: No. Do you want it in writing? The company's yours.",
        "Rosanna: You're just gonna walk away?",
        "Craig: I am just going to walk away. You handle the fashion show, handle Carly. And when she takes her bows, you'll be up there with her. Because I am done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Come on in.",
        "Sharon: All right.",
        "Carly: There is still so much that needs to be done. The clothes need to be finished. And the run-through at the Lakeview needs to be prepped. And I still have to win back the most fabulous man on the face of the earth. A woman's work is never done. So, Sharon, tell me -- there's no reason that Ms. Cabot needs to know that you've been carrying around my groceries on her dime, is there?",
        "Sharon: Oh, what groceries?",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Sharon: Mm-hmm. All right. Well, I hope Detective Snyder enjoys his gourmet feast.",
        "Carly: Yes, I hope so, too. I think he will.",
        "Sharon: Good.",
        "Carly: I'll see you tomorrow.",
        "Sharon: All right.",
        "Carly: Thanks again.",
        "Sharon: No problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey! Get your filthy hands off her, or I'll kill you! I said, get your damn hands off of her!",
        "Rose: Paul, don't do this! Don't! You wanna yell at somebody, you yell at me! But don't do anything you're gonna regret! You gotta go. Just go.",
        "Dusty: Not when he's acting like this.",
        "Rose: Listen, I will see you at the opening later. Please, just go. Please?",
        "Dusty: No, I don't think it's a good idea.",
        "Rose: Please?",
        "Dusty: Okay. I don't know what to say to you.",
        "Rose: I know you don't want to hear this, but I'm sorry. You have no idea how sorry I am.",
        "Paul: You know, I've always known you could be unpredictable. But cruel? This is a new one.",
        "Rose: I never meant to hurt you. I -- I swear.",
        "Paul: And what exactly did you expect when you called me over to see that?",
        "Rose: I didn't invite Dusty. He just was here. And then I just -- I just didn't expect --",
        "Paul: You didn't expect what? You didn't expect what, Rose? To choose Dusty over me? That's exactly what you're doing, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You think my involvement in Monte Carlo is unhealthy? Fine, I am out.",
        "Rosanna: I get it. Carly was here giving me the hard sell this morning, and now you're here to finish me off. You think I wouldn't see through that?",
        "Craig: Carly knows nothing of my plans.",
        "Rosanna: And why should I believe you?",
        "Craig: Because I'm admitting I was wrong. I never should have left.",
        "Rosanna: But you did.",
        "Craig: Yes. And I am trying to fix things between us now so there's nothing in our way.",
        "Rosanna: By running to your ex-wife?",
        "Craig: Well, she knows Lucy. She knows the deal with Aaron. And you and I could have used some perspective.",
        "Rosanna: Which Sierra and only Sierra could give you?",
        "Craig: I was very angry. But I'm not now. And I just want to get back to where we were.",
        "Rosanna: Which was where?",
        "Craig: Which was so hopelessly in love that I'd be counting the seconds until we were alone.",
        "Rosanna: That's beautiful.",
        "Craig: It's the truth.",
        "Rosanna: Did Barbara buy this smooth apology?",
        "Craig: Where did Barbara come from?",
        "Rosanna: Well, obviously from your past. I did a little thinking and realized that when you were married to Barbara, you did the exact same thing to her that you are doing to me now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Oh, Mr. Brackett. You see, my escapades have already been on TV, in the papers, probably all over the internet by now. So the fact that you're threatening me with them is really funny. But it's no joke. Because from what I remember, it's illegal.",
        "Brackett: Sometimes we have to play hardball to get the job done.",
        "Molly: On what page of the FBI handbook does it say, \"when the case gets tough, start threatening the innocent\"? You know what? I can't wait to see what your superiors in Washington have to say when I call them to find out about this.",
        "Brackett: Okay, look, I apologize if I offended you. I'm just trying to do my job.",
        "Molly: Save the scare tactics for the drug runners, buddy.",
        "Brackett: I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Mrs. McKinnon. It won't happen again.",
        "Molly: Now why would a spook spook so easily? Unless -- yes. I need the number for the FBI offices in Springfield, Illinois.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, what do you think, baby girl? Do you think it's too much? You know, I was just thinking the same thing. I've got nothing to lose. [Muffled noise] Jack, is that you? Jack?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: What you just saw there -- I mean, the kissing? That's as far as it went. It's just that I got all these feelings that I can't quite figure out.",
        "Paul: Well, allow me to help you. You're hot for a second-rate con man, and you're too dumb to know it.",
        "Rose: I may not have that fancy education that you have, but I am smart when it comes to people, and I know people.",
        "Paul: Then how can you be so blind, Rose? Dusty's got secrets. Why else would he be bumming money from my mother? And that loan he got from her wasn't as simple as he made it sound. He's been working for her.",
        "Rose: You don't have any proof of that.",
        "Paul: Why would I lie to you? Why would I lie to you when it's obvious he's been lying to you the whole time?",
        "Rose: Yeah, well, this isn't about Dusty. This is about us.",
        "Paul: Is there even an \"us\" left to talk about?",
        "Rose: I don't know.",
        "Paul: All right. Well, here's another question I don't want the answer to. Do you love me?",
        "Rose: I loved you more than I thought I could possibly love anybody.",
        "Paul: \"Loved.\"",
        "Rose: Well, see, it's not that simple.",
        "Paul: You know, a year ago, all you wanted to do was get married. That's all I wanted, all I still want. What changed?",
        "Rose: Me. I knew it when I got off the plane from Italy. I knew it. Then I saw you. And we had this energy again. And I thought -- you know, maybe it was all in my head. You know, maybe I was the same old Rosie. But you know what? I'm not. And I am so sorry.",
        "Paul: So am I. Because Dusty is gonna break your heart. And this time, I'm not gonna be there to pick up the pieces.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You and Barbara are not even in the same universe. Where did that come from?",
        "Rosanna: One of the benefits of an excellent education is its emphasis on history, how patterns repeat.",
        "Craig: Well, there are no similarities between you and that -- that gargoyle.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then let me point out a few key patterns for you, hmm? Barbara and I both have an excellent education. We are both intelligent, educated women.",
        "Craig: Well --",
        "Rosanna: We both have powerful design houses. You stole her company so that you could launch Carly's --",
        "Craig: Hey, hey, you are so off!",
        "Rosanna: No, I'm not off.",
        "Craig: Yes!",
        "Rosanna: You didn't steal my company, but you conned me into creating one for Carly.",
        "Craig: Oh --",
        "Rosanna: Another similarity between Barbara and I is that you married us, you used us, and you left us.",
        "Craig: I did not leave us. I did not leave us. I needed some -- some time to cool off.",
        "Rosanna: You told Barbara that you loved her, and she believed you, and so did I. I suppose I should count myself lucky that I got out of this without being set on fire.",
        "Craig: I never hurt Barbara. That's a matter of public record, and you know that.",
        "Rosanna: Fine.",
        "Craig: You know that?",
        "Rosanna: Fine.",
        "Craig: Huh?",
        "Rosanna: I understand.",
        "Craig: Look, hey, listen. I never loved Barbara. Ever.",
        "Rosanna: What does that say about me?",
        "Craig: I have never loved any woman the way I love you. Not Carly, not Sierra. No one. And in the spirit of that love, I have forgiven you. So if you're not gonna forgive me, tell me now so I can go shoot myself.",
        "Rosanna: You don't get to do that. You don't get to say romantic things like that. It's not fair. Oh, don't. Don't.",
        "Craig: I'm just telling you what's in my heart.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. You win. I'll take over Monte Carlo and the show and the rest of it.",
        "Craig: The rest of it?",
        "Rosanna: This is it, though. No more \"get out of jail free\" cards. You screw up again, and I am gone for good.",
        "Craig: I do promise. I promise.",
        "Rosanna: No, no more promises, please. I'm tired of seeing that you're gonna break them.",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Craig: Sierra, Sierra.",
        "Sierra: The door was open. Sorry.",
        "Craig: No, listen. I think we're about to get lucky --",
        "Sierra: No, no, this'll just take a second. Just a second. Rosanna, you need to know that I did not come here to disrupt your life.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you, Sierra. And if you mean it, you will tell me that you are getting on a plane, to get out of here tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Jack? Jack, you can put down the nine millimeter. It's just me. Jack? [Cell phone ringing] hello?",
        "Jack: Hey, Carly, it's me. You all right?",
        "Carly: Uh -- yeah. I'm just surprised to hear your voice. I thought you were here.",
        "Jack: Where's here?",
        "Carly: Milltown. I used the spare key to bring you dinner. I hope that's okay.",
        "Jack: No, that's great. Actually, I was calling to see if you wanted to meet me at Al's, but it sounds like you're way ahead of me.",
        "Carly: So then you're not mad?",
        "Jack: Not at all. Tell me something -- why'd you think I was there?",
        "Carly: Well -- it's probably nothing. I -- I heard a thump.",
        "Jack: What kind of thump?",
        "Carly: I don't know. A thumpy thump. It's probably just a loose shutter or something.",
        "Jack: Probably. Hey, listen. Do me a favor. Come down to the station and wait for me here. I'd feel better.",
        "Carly: Really?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Hey, you never know.",
        "Carly: Okay, I'll see you there. All right, whoever's up there -- my husband is very big and very strong and very angry. And he carries a gun. And he's coming home. I'm losing my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Okay, so you're telling me that agent Delbert Brackett has been active in the Illinois field for five years? Okay. Great. No, no. My fact checker will be in touch if I need any more information. Thank you.",
        "Kim: Molly?",
        "Molly: Hey, Kim! Hi.",
        "Kim: Hi. When you called, you sounded so agitated. Is everything okay?",
        "Molly: No, I'm not agitated. I'm excited. I have this really big story, and I wanna tell you about it. I need to tell you about it, so have a seat.",
        "Kim: Okay, terrific. So -- what's up?",
        "Molly: I was just on the phone with the FBI. I'm investigating an agent named Delbert Brackett.",
        "Kim: Hold on. You said the FBI? Well -- how did this just happen to fall into your lap?",
        "Molly: Guilt by association. You see, they're asking me for my help in their investigation. But they're really after Dusty Donovan.",
        "Kim: Dusty?",
        "Molly: He's into some pretty shady stuff.",
        "Kim: Oh, no.",
        "Molly: But, then again, so is agent Brackett. Kim, he tried to blackmail me into prostituting myself.",
        "Kim: What?!",
        "Molly: He wanted me to lure evidence out of Dusty that the FBI might be able to use. And at first, I was completely freaked out by the whole thing. But then I got mad, because I realized it's illegal. And what kind of journalist would I be if I don't do something about it?",
        "Kim: Okay. Wait a minute now. What is this something you're planning to do?",
        "Molly: I'm going to call agent Brackett and tell him I'm gonna work for him.",
        "Kim: And you're going after Dusty or the FBI?",
        "Molly: Both. I am sick and tired of everybody else trying to tell me how to run my life. Those days are over. Oh, the good life to be free and explore",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: What's the matter with Rose? Why is she late like this, to her own party? She's very, very late. Paul can't keep her on a schedule? Is Paul with her?",
        "Dusty: What do you think, I got her under 24-hour surveillance? I have no idea.",
        "Rose: Hello, everyone. Sorry to keep you all waiting.",
        "Lisa: Rose, this place is so gorgeous! I want you to know -- here.",
        "Rose: Mm.",
        "Lisa: I want you to know that I'm going to be your very first client tomorrow. Be prepared to pamper me all day long.",
        "Rose: That is -- that is great.",
        "Lucinda: Rose, dear, the proprietress should be here for her guests. I don't know whether to be very angry with you or to be very concerned about you.",
        "Rose: Sorry, Ms. Walsh.",
        "Lucinda: And Paul -- is he going to be very late?",
        "Rose: Um -- I don't think he's gonna be coming. Excuse me. I need to talk to you.",
        "Dusty: More champagne, anyone?",
        "Rose: I think I'm hyperventilating.",
        "Lily: All right, look, Rose, just calm down, all right? And tell me what happened. You didn't fix things with Paul?",
        "Rose: Oh, I fixed it, all right. It's over. I didn't plan on it happening. You know, it just -- just came out. And when I said it, it just -- it felt like it was the right thing. For both of us.",
        "Lily: Were you at least able to leave Dusty out of it?",
        "Rose: As best as I could. It wasn't pretty.",
        "Lily: Rose -- hey. It's gonna be okay.",
        "Rose: This would be a great time for that twin switcheroo thing. You go out there and be me, and I'll go home with Holden. No good, huh?",
        "Dusty: Is everything all right?",
        "Lily: Rose and I were just in the middle of something, if you don't mind.",
        "Dusty: All right, I'll come back.",
        "Rose: No, no. I'll just be a minute, all right? Go out there and pretend to be me, but calm and sane. I'll just be a minute.",
        "Lily: For you.",
        "Dusty: What happened?",
        "Rose: It's over.",
        "Dusty: How's it feel?",
        "Rose: Horrible.",
        "Dusty: I wish there was something I could say to make you feel better.",
        "Rose: No. Don't -- please, just hold me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Whatever you got on Dusty and my mother, Jack, I want it now.",
        "Jack: I take it things didn't go too well with Rose.",
        "Paul: I caught 'em together, Jack. And they weren't talking.",
        "Jack: They were in bed?",
        "Paul: Not yet.",
        "Jack: Paul, I don't know what to say.",
        "Paul: No, I knew it. I knew there was something going on. I just -- I just ignored it. They were lying to my face, and I just let it slide. Because I'm a nice guy. I'm agreeable. I'm Paul Ryan. I'm nothing like the parents who named me Paul Steinbeck.",
        "Jack: I'm a nice guy, too. It -- it blows.",
        "Paul: Yeah, and what does it get you? It gets you lied to, cheated on, jerked around by everyone, even your mother and the woman you love. Well, not anymore.",
        "Jack: What do you want to do?",
        "Paul: I want to show the world what Dusty Donovan really is, and I want to watch Rose's face when it happens.",
        "Jack: I think I have what you need. With this, you'll be able to nail both Dusty and your mother.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: My mother's pilot is expecting three passengers for Montega in the morning. The third passenger is Aaron Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: The two of us just standing here, this is true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm taking 'em down, Jack. My mother, Dusty, whoever helped them. And then I'm taking Rose back.",
        "Sierra: After Craig walked out on you on your wedding day, I don't blame you for not believing in him. I wouldn't. And I had no idea that he hadn't contacted you. Otherwise, I never would have come.",
        "Rosanna: Yet you're still here.",
        "Sierra: I'm here for Lucy. Not for Craig. And certainly not to meddle in this disaster he's making of your marriage.",
        "Craig: You know, I am actually in the room.",
        "Rosanna: Go on, Sierra. You have my attention.",
        "Sierra: After our little chat about Lucy in your hospital room, I have to tell you that I didn't know what to expect.",
        "Rosanna: Did you think that I would break my promise to treat her as my own after the painkillers wore off?",
        "Sierra: Well, frankly, yes, I did. But I was wrong. Lucy told me what a good friend you've been to her and how you listened to her when she had no one else to trust. And how you helped her to see Aaron. And that not only made her happy, it made her well. And for that, I thank you.",
        "Rosanna: Well, how are you planning on thanking me? By swooping in to take her away at Craig's say-so?",
        "Sierra: I am just trying to clear up this situation for Lucy and Aaron once and for all. So I have made travel arrangements. My mother's pilot is expecting three passengers for Montega in the morning.",
        "Craig: Is Lucinda going with you? I'll be your friend for life.",
        "Sierra: Actually, my mother's just providing the plane. The third passenger is Aaron Snyder.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you remember when Barbara went to Chicago a few months ago? Will was still in the psych ward.",
        "Paul: She said it had something to do with designing a children's line. Why?",
        "Jack: Yeah. Well, it turns out our friend, Mr. Donovan was staying at the same hotel at the time.",
        "Paul: Mom would claim coincidence, but I wouldn't believe it.",
        "Jack: Take a look.",
        "Paul: She paid Dusty's hotel bills.",
        "Jack: Even the pay-per-view movies.",
        "Paul: She's unbelievable. You know, when I told her Dusty was back in town, she just acted so shocked. And when she crashed his welcome home party, she acted like she hadn't seen him in 15 years.",
        "Jack: I wish I could say that surprises me.",
        "Paul: Well, this is my mother we're talking about. Did you call the Lakeview?",
        "Jack: Guess who paid Dusty's last statement?",
        "Paul: It all makes sense now. Dusty was broke. My mother generously offered to bail him out. All he had to do was give my mother exactly what she wanted since Rose came into my life. And he went for it. The guy I thought was my friend agreed to do whatever it took to break up the happy couple.",
        "Jack: Paul, I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: You know, you would think I'd know just how far my mother was willing to go after all these years. Damn her. Her and Dusty both. I gotta go.",
        "Jack: Where?",
        "Paul: I'm taking them down, Jack. My mother, Dusty, whoever helped them. And then I'm taking Rose back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: I wish I could stay like this forever.",
        "Dusty: I'd love to stay like this, but I think your fans would be disappointed. I've been waiting for this night for a long time.",
        "Rose: The hug or the shop?",
        "Dusty: Both.",
        "Rose: Yeah, me, too. You gave me all this. You're my hero.",
        "Dusty: Even though I borrowed money from Barbara?",
        "Rose: Oh, especially since you borrowed money from Barbara. 'Cause every time she looks at me, she'll just twinge a little bit, knowing she's helping me succeed. I like that.",
        "Lucinda: I'll handle it, Lily. Rose, dear, your guests are getting concerned. Have you forgotten, darling? The show must go on.",
        "Rose: Yes, I know all about that. I'll be out there in two shakes. Ugh, I look as bad as I feel.",
        "Dusty: You look beautiful. So -- get out there and enjoy the night.",
        "Rose: Yeah, I better do that, huh? Before I wake up and find out it's all a dream.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, hey -- before we go, I just want you to know that -- you know, whatever happens after tonight between Paul and you, or Barbara, whoever -- this moment between us right now, it's real. I mean, the two of us just standing here. This is true.",
        "Rose: I'll remember that.",
        "Dusty: Thanks.",
        "Rose: Let's go party.",
        "Dusty: Let's go.",
        "Rose: Hello! Thank you, all of you, for staying around.",
        "Mitzi: Hey, where else would we be? We're here for you.",
        "Emily: Actually, Hal's here for the sushi.",
        "Rose: Ah, good, good. It's the good stuff. I'm sorry, everyone, for pulling a Garbo on you right there. But I'm back.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you are fast. You're in like Flynn. You don't even give a girl a chance to change the sheets.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Rose: You're not hitting on my partner, now, are you, Ms. Walsh? Attention, everybody! I have an announcement to make. I have to make a toast. To the man who never stopped believing in me. Who was crazy enough to make all my dreams come true. The man with the plan, Dusty Donovan. But I always knew",
        "[door slams]",
        "Barbara: Rose, Rose, Rose. Well. Congratulations! It looks like you and Dusty have done a real bang-up job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Any more noises from your intruder?",
        "Carly: Well, I think he was probably just a shutter. But -- thanks for asking me down here. You made me feel special.",
        "Jack: You are.",
        "Carly: Something's bugging you. What is it?",
        "Jack: Paul was just here. He and Rose are having some major problems, the kind that are way too familiar.",
        "Carly: Do you think they can get past it?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure. But what I did tell him is that, if they want it to work, they gotta figure out what forced them to make those dumb mistakes and work like hell to fix it.",
        "Carly: You're a wise man, Jack Snyder. Maybe just overly experienced.",
        "Jack: But that advice I gave him -- it's kind of like what we're doing, isn't it?",
        "Carly: Yeah. And I'm really glad, g-man.",
        "Carly: Thanks for looking' out for me.",
        "Jack: Goes with the job. Now, come on. Let's see if I've got a loose shutter or a thief.",
        "Carly: What if it is a burglar or something like that?",
        "Jack: I'll kick his butt six ways from Sunday.",
        "Carly: My hero.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: All right, Molly, standing on your own is good. That's good. But it sounds to me like you could be in a lot of danger.",
        "Molly: Kim, it sure beats crawling from bed to bed, hoping that some guy is gonna solve all my problems.",
        "Kim: Okay, so you called me because you need some kind of special recording equipment? Which -- I suppose I can come up with something like that.",
        "Molly: Oh, I love you. Thank you. Do you know how bad I wish you were my mom?",
        "Kim: Oh.",
        "Molly: The truth is, I need you here because I want to keep you in the loop. Just in case anything should go wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: As much as I'd like to throw you out of here tonight, I'm really not in the mood. So could you please just leave?",
        "Barbara: Oh, I am so sorry. I don't mean to interrupt you and your new -- partner. I just want to say hello to Paul. Where is my handsome son?",
        "Dusty: Barbara. Take it easy.",
        "Barbara: Rose -- oh, no. Don't tell me that you and Paul have broken up. I thought that you were so happy together.",
        "Rose: The fact that you know about it already proves that I made the right choice.",
        "Lucinda: Enough, enough, Barbara. Get the hell out of here, or we'll gang up on you and turn you into a blonde.",
        "[Barbara laughs]",
        "Barbara: A threat. How novel. That seems to be the latest craze in Oakdale. Why don't you just ask Emily? And Rose.",
        "Emily: Please, please, can I kill her now, Hal?",
        "Lily: This is my sister's property, and you're trespassing.",
        "Rose: She's not gonna listen to you. She doesn't listen to anybody. And I'm through asking. Now get out!",
        "Dusty: No, no, no.",
        "Paul: You've been set up, Rose.",
        "Barbara: Paul!",
        "Paul: So have I.",
        "Dusty: Paul, we know you're upset --",
        "Paul: Shut up, Dusty. It's been going on for months.",
        "Rose: What? What, what has? You're scaring me, Paul. What's going on?",
        "Paul: I told you they were working together, and I was right. They were at it before Dusty even came to Oakdale. These are copies of receipts from the Drake Hotel in Chicago and the Lakeview. She's paying his bills, Rose. She owns him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: The point was to have Lucy separated from that hairball, not have him join her in a tropical paradise! Why else would I agree to be separated from my daughter?!",
        "Sierra: I told you that I would straighten out the situation. That's what I've done.",
        "Rosanna: It appears you have no allies left, my dear.",
        "Craig: Sierra, I thought you were going to help me with this.",
        "Sierra: I am. I am forcing you to grow up.",
        "Craig: Oh --",
        "Sierra: Just because you think that this boy is wrong for our daughter doesn't make it so.",
        "Rosanna: Everyone in the world thinks that Lucy and Aaron deserve a chance to be together. Everyone but you.",
        "Craig: I would thank you not to join my ex-wife in this, please.",
        "Sierra: You wanted a solution, and this is the fairest one that I could come up with. Once again, I am sorry that I barged in, Rosanna. But we are leaving in the morning.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, apology accepted.",
        "Sierra: And, Craig, you better just pray that Lucy is the woman that we raised her to be. And maybe someday she will forgive you for this.",
        "Craig: Wait, wait, wait. I will give him a chance. I will let her see him. All right? But please do not make her choose between him and me.",
        "Rosanna: I don't believe this. You just offered to compromise on the same issue that made you leave me on our wedding night. Only new oust air sanitizer",
        "Rosanna: Do you know why I helped Lucy see Aaron for the past few months? It was for you. I thought that if I could help you see the light, then Lucy wouldn't remember you the same way I remember my father -- self-serving, manipulative and cruel. But do I get a compromise? No. I am accused of betrayal and abandoned to think about the mess I made, like some ill-mannered child?",
        "Craig: That's correct, yes. But we have moved on. And I think we can get past this.",
        "Rosanna: With your ex-wife as referee? I don't think so. Sierra, thank you so much for trying to help with Lucy. I appreciate it. But I cannot allow my husband to use you to undermine our relationship one more time.",
        "Sierra: I understand.",
        "Craig: I don't. Rosanna -- we were making headway on this.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, well, then let me put this in terms you can understand. Tonight, I am the one leaving you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, goldilocks. Mama bear and papa bear are home.",
        "Carly: Mama bear -- that's cute. Jack, there's somebody here.",
        "Jack: All right. Go outside. Call 911. Okay?",
        "Carly: Be careful.",
        "Jack: I will. Whoever's in here, I'm a cop with a loaded .45. So come out slowly.",
        "Henry: I thought Carly said you had a nine millimeter.",
        "Jack: What the hell are you doing here? You were supposed to get out of town!",
        "Henry: Look, I ran out of funds. I had nowhere else to go. So I guess I'm just gonna have to stay here until this whole legal bugaboo with Barbara Ryan sorts itself out.",
        "Carly: Is everything all right?",
        "Jack: Define \"all right.\"",
        "Henry: Mama bear. Good to see you.",
        "Carly: What are you doing here, Henry? The cops are on their way.",
        "Henry: Oh, Jack will call them off. Won't you, pal? Hmm? By the way, the French food is just fabulous, Carly. It really is. But I thought that pregnant women were supposed to avoid the soft cheeses.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kim: I think you need a lot more than recording equipment. I think what you need to do is call Jack Snyder. He used to be with the FBI. He will know who you should talk to about this rogue agent. Let them take care of it, and then you do the story.",
        "Molly: Kim, I can't let everybody else keep taking care of everything in my life. You know, there was a time when I was pretty tough, remember? Yeah. And I need to get some of that back.",
        "Kim: Then this is how it has to be. Not only do you keep me in the loop, you call me on a regular basis. You tell me every move you're going to make. I reserve the right to have you followed. Understand? I can be tough, too.",
        "Molly: Yeah, I know. I am going to make you so proud. And I'm gonna tell you something -- Agent Brackett and Dusty Donovan aren't gonna know what hit them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Give those to me, Paul. Give them to --",
        "Paul: Hey, hey, back up. Think about it, Rose. It all makes sense. Dusty was broke, so Barbara paid off his debts. All he had to do was break us up.",
        "Barbara: That is insane, Paul.",
        "Paul: You know what? You can shut your mouth, 'cause no one is listening to what you have to say, anyway. But as for your partner Dusty -- how about it, Dusty? True or false? Oh, come on, old pal. Just this once, be half the man you used to be and tell Rose the real reason why you've been coming on to her since the first step you took in Oakdale. Come on. Tell her the truth, man. I dare ya.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Let's just see what kind of business you're into, Mr. Donovan.",
