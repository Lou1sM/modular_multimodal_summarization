        "Mike and Jen are still reveling in their newfound peace without Craig, but Dusty is becoming agitated at Jen not following through on some work commitments. Mike goes to talk to Dusty explaining the pregnancy is making Jen extremely tired, and she is doing the best she can under the circumstances. He wants Dusty to give her some space, and to realize she will put in her 40 hours, but after that Dusty needs to respect the fact she has a life. Mike thinks he has gotten through to Dusty, but after their conversation, Dusty leaves a message for Carly asking for her help. After Celia and Casey have a big fight regarding her having told Allison about Will being in the apartment, she ends up leaving the 50's dance at Yo's they had been attending, and ends up on the same rooftop as Will, who is walking precariously close to the edge. At first Will is angry at Celia because he claims that Allison was the only one who understood him, and that he would never trash her apartment. He gets Celia to believe she made a mistake and wants to help correct it, but Will doesn't want her to because he says Allison is more mad at the fact he was pretending to be her friend, while all along he was setting things up in hopes they would become more. Celia and Will start to open up to one another about how each feels lonely much of the time. They bond, and Will opens up to her about his family, but in the end when Celia needs to leave, he begs her not to tell anyone about him being up on the ledge. Celia is unsure, but agrees to, if he promises to always know if he is lonely or sad that he can call her. Will tells Celia that he will talk to Casey and make things right for her. Later after talking to his mom about relationships, Casey calls and leaves a message for Celia to call so they can talk things out. As he walks back into the house from his porch, we see he is being watched. Holden and Lucinda discuss Keith, and Holden tells her that Keith's friend checks out, and he feels silly about airing his concerns to Lily who is obviously getting closer to Keith. Lucinda questions whether Holden is still in love with Lily, but Holden tells Lucinda that she needs to forget about Keith and focus on Les as Julia's killer, and to accept the fact he and Lily are no longer a couple. Meanwhile, Lily happens upon a meeting between a mysterious man, Vin, and Keith outside Yo's. Keith claims to not know the man, and tries to divert Lily's suspicions by suggesting he is on edge because he is becoming jealous of Holden's interest in Lily's love life. Later at Lily's house they end up passionately kissing, which they both pull back from, and decide to take things more slowly. After Keith has left for the night, and Lily is locking up, she sees Keith outside her house talking to the man, Vin, whom he claimed to have not known."

        "Jennifer: Will, where are you? I finally get a chance to call, and you are nowhere to be found. Well, call me -- mm, tomorrow. Call me -- call me tomorrow. 'Cause I'm heading to bed right now. Okay, I love you, baby brother. Bye.",
        "Mike: So, we're going to bed, huh? Any special plans? [Jennifer yawns] Jen? Jen?",
        "Jennifer: Mm. Mm. Just -- just a minute. I'm gonna take a nap first, okay?",
        "Mike: You can just sleep right here as long as you want.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, that's so sweet. I should marry you.",
        "Mike: No regrets about your mom taking over the wedding?",
        "Jennifer: No. Not yet, but it's only been about ten minutes.",
        "Mike: Mm. Okay.",
        "Jennifer: Mm-hmm.",

        "Dusty: I need you. It's been crazy since the press conference. Reporters want quotes from you.",
        "Jennifer: Well, that's terrific. But they can wait until I come in tomorrow.",
        "Dusty: Tonight, Jen. These guys are pushing deadlines and we need the PR.",
        "Jennifer: Dusty, I've dealt with this a hundred times. It doesn't matter how much they push, okay? They're not gonna go to print for at least another week.",
        "Dusty: The sooner they have it, the sooner they'll print it. If you weren't late today, Jen, they'd have their stupid quotes, and they wouldn't be bothering me.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, okay, okay. I'll be there.",
        "Mike: But you're too tired to go anywhere.",
        "Jennifer: I'll pull it together.",

        "Margo: Hey, dude, what's up? Why aren't you out doing the bop? The stroll? The bunny hop? The -- don't look at me like that. I didn't give '50s dances dumb names.",
        "Casey: Whatever.",
        "Margo: What's the matter? What's wrong? Where's Celia?",
        "Casey: She left.",
        "Tom: What, not feeling well?",
        "Casey: We had a fight.",
        "Margo: Why?",
        "Casey: Because she decided to try to totally ruin Will's life, that's why.",

        "Keith: All right, look, I don't need you to rattle me up here. I know what I've got to do. I haven't forgot.",
        "Vin: Yeah? Get to it, huh?",
        "Keith: I will get to it. All right? I just -- I can't talk to you right now. This is kind of a bad time for me.",
        "Vin: Yeah? Well, that's cool. It's a bad time for me, too. I got a lady to see. Your lady.",
        "Keith: Leave her out of this, okay? She's got nothing to do with it.",
        "Vin: What are you telling me, Morrissey? You keeping her in the dark, huh? What does she think, you're some stand-up guy who's fighting for truth, justice and the American way, when we both know you'd do anything just to get your hands on some cash. And we do mean anything, don't we, pal?",
        "Keith: All right. All right. All right. Just back off. You'll get your money, all right? But I'm telling you, if you mess things up for me here --",
        "Vin: What are you going to do, Keith? Huh? Kill me?",

        "Vin: Ah, like the flower. Nice.",
        "Lily: Thanks. Am I interrupting something?",
        "Vin: Nah, I just thought your friend might be able to help me out. Turns out he can't. Maybe you can.",
        "Lily: I don't understand.",
        "Vin: Oh, nothing heavy. Just a question I have to ask you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: What are you doing screaming at me?",
        "Celia: You scared me.",
        "Will: Why?",
        "Celia: I'm afraid of heights.",
        "Will: Okay, well, I'm not. So what are you doing on a rooftop?",
        "Celia: Are you telling me to leave?",
        "Will: Look, I don't know what you're doing up here. But I came up here to be alone. So, yeah, actually, I'd like it if you found someplace else to be right now.",
        "Celia: I have just as much right to be here as you.",
        "Will: Are you crying?",
        "Celia: No. It's the wind. It hurts my eyes.",
        "Will: Well, you don't like wind, and you're scared of heights. So, why are you up here?",
        "Celia: I was at the party at Yo's -- the '50s thing.",
        "Will: Mm-hmm. Casey told me about so what'd you do, leave him there?",
        "Celia: He was into the music. It just got too loud for me.",
        "Will: So why didn't you tell them to turn it down?",
        "Celia: What were you doing?",
        "Will: When?",
        "Celia: Just now when I got here.",
        "Will: Thinking.",
        "Celia: About what?",
        "Will: I don't know, stuff. That's what I do. I think about things, unlike some people who just jump to conclusions.",
        "Celia: I didn't think you were going to jump off the building.",
        "Will: Oh, come on, Celia. You came up here through the door, and you saw me standing on the ledge, and you thought I was going to kill myself 'cause I had some argument with Alison.",
        "Celia: You had a fight with Alison?",
        "Will: Don't act dumb.",
        "Celia: I'm not.",
        "Will: You knew what would happen if you went and told her that lie about me trashing her apartment. So you want to know how I'm really feeling right now?",
        "Celia: Broken-hearted?",
        "Will: No, mad as hell at you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Okay, give me the details. What did you dig up on Morrissey?",
        "Holden: Nothing.",
        "Lucinda: That cannot be. What about his disreputable friend?",
        "Holden: The guy in Keith's room was an old buddy of his from flight school.",
        "Lucinda: I don't care how they met. He had a gun.",
        "Holden: Which he is licensed to carry. He's a pilot.",
        "Lucinda: Are you sure of this?",
        "Holden: Jack was with me when Keith laid everything out. He also had an old photo of the two of them in uniforms.",
        "Lucinda: That does not prove a thing.",
        "Holden: Well, it's certainly proof enough for me. Because tonight I made a complete idiot of myself. In front of Jack, in front of the whole town practically.",
        "Lucinda: No, darling, you were just trying to protect your wife.",
        "Holden: Lily told me that she doesn't need any protection from Keith Morrissey. In fact, she seemed like she wanted to get as close to the guy as she could possibly get.",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Listen, it's getting cold out here. We should go back in.",
        "Lily: What was the question you wanted to ask me?",
        "Vin: I was hoping I could bum a cigarette. You got one?",
        "Lily: No, no, I don't smoke.",
        "Vin: Well, good for you. It's a nasty habit. I should have figured that out looking at the two of you.",
        "Lily: Do you guys know each other?",
        "Keith: No. No, no, no, we just met. So if you'll excuse us --",
        "Vin: Oh, hey, no problem. I gotta get going myself. But it was a pleasure talking to you. Maybe you and I will see each other again sometime, huh?",
        "Lily: He's odd, huh?",
        "Keith: He's an idiot.",
        "Lily: What? What is it? What did he say? What's got you so upset? What happened?",
        "Keith: Nothing. You know, sometimes you just get this feeling about people, you know? The guy was giving my the willies, you know? It's just -- and when you came out, I just, you know, wanted you to get back inside.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Keith: I don't know, this guy was bugging me. He just was hanging around bugging me, that's it.",
        "Lily: What's really wrong here?",
        "Keith: I just told you.",
        "Lily: Oh, come on, Keith. I'm your friend, you can talk to me. If something's bothering you, you can tell me. I'm not gonna judge you. I won't get offended. I thought you knew that already.",
        "Keith: I do.",
        "Lily: Then what is it?",
        "Keith: Well, now that you mention it, there is something.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Keith: Well, this -- what you just said. Friends. That's kinda bothering me.",
        "Lily: That was a serious answer? Our friendship bothers you?",
        "Keith: Yeah. Yeah, it does. That and your husband.",
        "Lily: Holden?",
        "Keith: You got another husband?",
        "Lily: Well, Holden and I are separated. And what he thinks about you doesn't matter to me.",
        "Keith: You believe that?",
        "Lily: Yes, I believe that. He just -- he's being overprotective because of the kids.",
        "Keith: I think that's because he's still in love with you.",
        "Lily: No. That's not true.",
        "Keith: It is true. He's in love with you, that's why he keeps coming after me.",
        "Lily: No, I don't think so. He comes here, he sees us together for the first time. He overreacted, but he won't always this way, trust me.",
        "Keith: Well, I think you're wrong. I think he's going to keep trying to dig stuff up on me. And eventually, he's gonna stumble on something and that's gonna turn you against me.",
        "Lily: We all have pasts. Trust me, there are things that I have done that I have no intention of telling you.",
        "Keith: Really?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Keith: Well, that makes you even more mysterious, which makes me even more crazy about you. However, I gotta tell you something. I can't always promise that, when it comes to Holden, I'm going to be so calm. Because I got a feeling that down the road there's gonna be a scene. And I'm probably gonna cause it, 'cause, you know, I just don't want him around you.",
        "Lily: Is that why that guy upset you-- Vin? You thought he that he was, what?",
        "Keith: Well, yeah, that, too -- the way he was looking at you when he shook your hand. I just didn't like that. I wanted to punch him in the nose.",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Keith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Wow. I've learned something else about you. You're jealous and have a temper.",
        "Keith: That's right.",
        "Lily: Well, me, too. I guess we're both flawed.",
        "Keith: So where does that leave us?",
        "Lily: I think we have more in common than we knew. Want to go to my house and talk about it? Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I understand you're with the \"L.A. Times.\" I told you, she'd be happy to give you a phone interview. Hold on, I think she's here. False alarm. I've got your number. I'll have her call you. Where's Jennifer, parking the car?",
        "Mike: No, she's home sleeping.",
        "Dusty: That's lovely. I haven't eaten yet.",
        "Mike: You're not pregnant. She is.",
        "Dusty: Okay, that takes care of what she is and what I'm not. What are you supposed to be?",
        "Mike: I'm the guy who's taking care of her. And starting tonight, you're going to be taking better care of her, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I'm sorry you guys had a fight.",
        "Casey: Yeah, me, too.",
        "Margo: But what exactly did she do to Will?",
        "Casey: It was bad. I mean, you think you know someone. And then they do something that's just so --",
        "Tom: So what?",
        "Casey: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Margo: Don't. Don't. Don't talk to us. But don't you think you should talk to Celia?",
        "Casey: Is that an order? Like when I was in kindergarten and wouldn't share my crayons kind of order?",
        "Tom: Hey, Case.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. It's just -- man, I thought Celia was nice and sweet and she's not. I thought I could trust her, and I can't. And the reason I'm mad at her is because I have a right to be. She's the one who messed up, not me. I'm going home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: Alison needed to know, and I needed to tell her because she's been good to me. She's been a real friend.",
        "Will: I thought I was your friend, too.",
        "Celia: Yeah, well, sometimes when you see things that you don't like, you have to say something.",
        "Will: Celia, I didn't do anything wrong!",
        "Celia: How come you didn't you tell her you were in her apartment after she left?",
        "Will: Because it wasn't that big of a deal. I left my keys there. And, yeah, so I accidentally broke a perfume bottle. That's it. I didn't trash her place.",
        "Celia: Who else could have done it?",
        "Will: I don't know. But I'm about the last person who would. Don't you get it? Alison's always been there for me. I'm not gonna show my gratitude to her by trashing her apartment and making her feel scared to be there.",
        "Celia: Maybe you didn't think about that. Maybe you thought you could just fly in and be a hero.",
        "Will: No, Alison has always believed in me, okay? She's the only person who -- she's the only person who gets me, all right? At least she was, until now. You know, I look around and I see people. And they have friends and family. My family? They definitely don't get me. But Alison -- Alison put herself on the line for me when no one else -- even my own brother, who sent me away. I could never hurt her. I could never do anything like that to her. Not ever.",
        "Celia: I guess I didn't -- I mean, I was wrong. Oh, my God. I was wrong. Will, I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Listen, I had a really good time tonight. Other than running into your disgruntled ex-husband.",
        "Lily: Yeah. So did I.",
        "Keith: Good. Well, I should get going. I've still got some unpacking to do.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Keith: Okay. Did I thank you for letting me stay in your grandfather's house?",
        "Lily: Yes, you did.",
        "Keith: Well, that's too bad.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Keith: Well, 'cause I think we were possibly talking two kisses, you know? A thank you kiss and a good night kiss.",
        "Lily: My mother always told me you can never say \"thank you\" enough.",
        "Keith: Well, in that case --",
        "Lily: You're welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Holden: Keith is no good. And he's certainly capable of hurting Lily.",
        "Lucinda: You still love Lily.",
        "Lily: Oh, that guy that was outside of Yo's.",
        "Keith: What about him?",
        "Lily: I realize I've seen him before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: She's moved him in onto your property.",
        "Holden: And I wish she didn't. But she certainly has the right to do that. She can offer Keith Cal's old place. And even if I wanted to go get a court order and have him evicted, it wouldn't do much good. Because the house is in her name. I don't have a leg to stand on.",
        "Lucinda: But your children will be in constant contact with him. Since when did you decide that there was no harm in that?",
        "Holden: I didn't. But I have to believe that Lily would not endanger our children.",
        "Lucinda: Well, of course she wouldn't if she were in her right mind. But she's rebounding from losing the love of her life. Come on, couldn't you just go back? I know that any feelings she has for the man would evaporate. I know it.",
        "Holden: Lucinda, we have been through this.",
        "Lucinda: Well, why don't you just go back to Lily and we won't go through it again. Oh, darling, I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. Forgive me. I won't badger you anymore.",
        "[Holden chuckles]",
        "Holden: Can I get that in writing?",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely. The little boy's trust fund?",
        "Holden: I don't know anything about that. I don't know what Keith is doing with it.",
        "Lucinda: Shouldn't you find out?",
        "Holden: Why? What's the point? Even if wants to get the money, maybe he has a good reason.",
        "Lucinda: For stealing from a baby?",
        "Holden: I don't know. Maybe he wants to get a house for himself and the boy. Maybe he wants to put the kid through private school, who knows?",
        "Lucinda: Maybe he just likes money. He wants money. That would explain somewhat his relationship with Lily. Maybe it's through her bank account. If the man had the nerve to kill his sister, what would stop him from hurting Lily?",
        "Holden: He didn't kill Julia. Not according to Jack.",
        "Lucinda: What does he know?",
        "Holden: He is a cop. And he also informed me we are conveniently forgetting something.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, and what is that?",
        "Holden: All the evidence in Julia's murder points to her ex-husband, not Keith.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Now what are your instincts telling you? What are your basic instincts telling you?",
        "Holden: My instincts?",
        "Lucinda: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holden: They're telling me that Keith is no good. That he is certainly capable of hurting Lily and that he is probably after the money.",
        "Lucinda: Then you should stop him.",
        "Holden: Those are just feelings. Not facts. And the only reason that I feel that way is because --",
        "Lucinda: Because you still love Lily. Yes, you do. You still love Lily.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Ay-yi-yi.",
        "Keith: I couldn't have put it any better.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry.",
        "Keith: That you just kissed me?",
        "Lily: No. That we have to stop. Oh! Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.",
        "Keith: I'm glad you just said that.",
        "Lily: It's --",
        "Keith: It's okay. I know, see -- we need to slow down a little bit. I know. I don't want to, you know, get you --",
        "Lily: Push things a little bit?",
        "Keith: That's right.",
        "Lily: Why? Why do we -- why do we want to do that?",
        "Keith: Because we want to take it slow so that, you know, this lasts.",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "Keith: Right. Well, you know what? I've got a long two minute drive.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Keith: So I should probably get going, you know?",
        "Lily: Traffic, I mean --",
        "Keith: Gridlock can kill you. Good night.",
        "Lily: I just remembered something.",
        "Keith: That I shouldn't be going?",
        "Lily: No, no, no. That guy --",
        "Keith: What?",
        "Lily: -- That was outside of Yo's.",
        "[Keith sighs]",
        "Keith: What about him?",
        "Lily: I don't think he just happened to run into you outside of that bar. I realize I've seen him before.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Celia: Will, I feel so terrible. I should've never opened my big mouth.",
        "Will: That's true.",
        "Celia: I'll talk to Alison.",
        "Will: No. It's too late for that.",
        "Celia: No, I need to fix it. I need to make things right.",
        "Will: Celia, you can't. So don't try.",
        "Celia: But you didn't trash her place. And now she thinks that you did.",
        "Will: What she thinks is that I was pretending to be something that I'm not. And that's one thing she's right about.",
        "Celia: What?",
        "Will: All right, I didn't trash her place, but I'm trying to me her get closer to me. Trying to get her to need me. It's so stupid I can't believe I did it.",
        "Celia: Stop, it's not stupid.",
        "Will: About her, I am.",
        "Celia: You wanted her to fall in love with you.",
        "Will: Is it that obvious?",
        "Celia: I wasn't sure at first. But after hearing you talk about her, yeah.",
        "Will: Well, you know. And now Alison knows, too. She also knows that what I want from her, she can't give me. And she can't deal with that, so I guess I'm out of her life.",
        "Celia: And you're okay with that?",
        "Will: No. But I will be after I think about it.",
        "Celia: Because thinking about things, that's what you do.",
        "Will: Right.",
        "Celia: So, what are we thinking?",
        "Will: We?",
        "Celia: You can talk to me. Just think out loud. But before you let those ideas bounce around in your head, can I borrow your coat?",
        "Will: We were thinking about my life these last few years, and how weird it's been.",
        "Celia: Tell me.",
        "Will: Okay. Well, after my parents got divorced, I spent a lot of time with my mom. My dad had a new son, and my brother was always fighting with Mom, and my sister was never around.",
        "Celia: But you had friends, right?",
        "Will: Not really. There was no time.",
        "Celia: Why not?",
        "Will: Because of my mom. I was the only one who really cared about her. She'd say things like, you know, \"I was her guy\" and I understood her.",
        "Celia: That's not fair. She was putting too much pressure on you.",
        "Will: Yeah. But you know what? I didn't feel bad about it, because it made me feel useful. You know? Like I had a purpose. And then some things started happening. That's when I realized something.",
        "Celia: What?",
        "Will: That my mom wasn't my friend. You know, and that she still had some really serious problems. And for all the times that she needed me to be there for her, she was never there for me. And that's when I realized I'm alone. I always have been. And I always will be.",

        "Mike: No, I insisted. Dusty, she's pregnant. She's exhausted. She can't work long hours right now.",
        "Dusty: She's the president of a company. As you know, she pulls in a major salary. She's begging me for another chance here.",
        "Mike: And you were right to give it to her. But for now, we all need to make sure she doesn't overdo it.",
        "Dusty: Tomorrow's schedule's totally screwed up because she was late for her own press conference today. You understand?",
        "Mike: That was a one-time thing.",
        "Dusty: Tonight makes it at least a two-time thing.",
        "Mike: You trying to tell me that she doesn't work hard here? Come on, she's here full time all day, every day. You know that.",
        "Dusty: When you're trying to build a multimillion dollar operation from the ground up, Mike, it takes more than 40 hours a week.",
        "Mike: Okay, well, you know what? That's going to have to be enough. Because Jennifer has a life outside this office with me. And she's going to enjoy that life and her wedding and everything else. All right, and you're going to have to deal with that. Do you understand?",

        "Tom: Well, if you're so worried then have a talk with him.",
        "Margo: I'm not going to talk with him. You talk to him.",
        "Tom: I'm not going to talk to him. Must I remind you in the parental bylaws, paragraph 8 section 17, it clearly states --",
        "Margo: Oh, I love when you talk like that.",
        "Tom: That you, the party heretofore known as Mom, handle all relationship conversations that occur on the day ending in the letter \"Y.\"",

        "Tom: Yeah, he trusts you.",
        "Margo: But this relationship with Celia, it's his first real relationship. And they're already having so many trust issues just right of the bat. What does that say about the \"heretofore mentioned Mom\"?",
        "Tom: This is not about you.",
        "Margo: Yeah, it is. I mean, I cheated on you, and it really hurt him. That's what it's about.",
        "Tom: He had a fight with his girlfriend. It has nothing to do with anything that you may or may not have done. You are a great Mom. Really.",
        "Margo: Can you say that again with feeling?",
        "Tom: I can.",
        "Casey: Do you guys have to do that right in the middle of everything? Isn't it like unsanitary or something?",

        "Margo: You could do it down here, honey.",

        "Casey: I'm cool.",
        "Margo: Okay. I guess I'm not supposed to bring up the whole Celia issue. So that's okay. I won't.",
        "Casey: She blew it. She really blew it.",
        "Margo: But you want clue me in here? Am I supposed to just, you know, sit back passively with my mouth shut or are you looking for advice?",
        "Casey: That depends. Are you just going to tell me that I'm wrong?",
        "Margo: No. You're my son. You're always perfect and always right.",
        "Casey: Well, in that case, then yes, I want your advice.",
        "Margo: You see how right you are? [Margo sighs] Why aren't you talking to Celia?",
        "Casey: I tried to talk to her, and then she just walked away.",
        "Margo: Was that right after you told her how wrong she was? Duh.",
        "Casey: So what, I'm supposed to call her, even though she was the one who was wrong?",
        "Margo: That depends on if you want to be right or if you want to be with her.",
        "Casey: Well, what if I want both?",
        "Margo: Can't happen. Honey, relationships are -- they're hard. And if you find somebody that you really like and you really want to be with, then they're not always going to behave the way you want them to. They're gonna argue with you, and they're gonna disappoint you. And they're gonna hurt you. I mean, look what I did to your dad and you.",
        "Casey: I don't even want to talk about that anymore. I mean, you and Dad now? It's awesome. I like it.",
        "Margo: I do, too. But it took a lot of work. Relationships take work.",

        "Will: No, I guess it's a little bit like that. But, you've got to admit, my life's a lot more miserable than yours.",

        "Will: You know that you can't tell him that you saw me up here. You can't tell anyone.",
        "Celia: Why not?",
        "Will: Because I got thrown out of Alison's life, and then I came up here. And whether or not you told anyone that I was, you know, on the ledge, they'd freak out.",

        "Will: But I already told you, nothing was going to happen, all right? I wasn't going to jump. Celia?",
        "Celia: Okay, let's just pretend that I don't believe you. What exactly were you doing on the edge of this building looking down?",
        "Will: Celia, I'm not suicidal.",
        "Celia: Are you sure?",

        "Celia: Will, that's awful.",
        "Will: All right, fine, but I've been to enough shrinks to know that sometimes people think thoughts like that. And it's okay. Celia, if you tell anyone that you saw me up here tonight, they'll send me back to the hospital, all right? And then I might as well be dead, because my life will be over.",
