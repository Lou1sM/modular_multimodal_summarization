        "Will: That's gonna be you in a couple of weeks.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, if Lisa still wants me to work here.",
        "Will: Well, she gave you the job.",
        "Gwen: I know, but she wanted me to start working like yesterday.",
        "Lisa: There she is.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Will: Hey, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: My brand new desk clerk. Don't say anything to Peg because she doesn't know she's gonna get the boot.",
        "Gwen: I don't want you to fire someone for me.",
        "Lisa: Oh, Honey, please. The register's been short, and, uh, she's outta here.",
        "Gwen: Okay, um, the thing is, I really actually hate to ask this.",
        "Will: She, uh, she had to get into the semester kinda late because of the whole demo thing, and she's got exams next week, so...",
        "Gwen: And now I've got a lot of studying that I need to do, but I could start the week after that. I can work full time, I can do a double shift, whatever you need.",
        "Lisa: Okay, don't you worry about a thing. Ah, you just go ahead and take care of your studies, and I will find somebody who can fill in until you are available.",
        "Gwen: Are you sure? Because, actually, I could maybe just do part-time.",
        "Lisa: Positive, it'll be just fine. Now you must focus on your studies. And the job will be here.",
        "Gwen: Okay, thank you so much.",
        "Lisa: You're so welcome. Now, listen, I want you both to go and study and I expect to see your names on the Dean's list.",
        "Gwen: Okay. Bye, thank you.",
        "Lisa: Uh-huh. Oh!",
        "Cleo: I'm so sorry.",
        "Lisa: No, it's really excuse me.",
        "Cleo: No, that was my fault.",
        "Lisa: No harm done.",
        "Cleo: Excuse me, are you Mrs. Lisa Grimaldi?",
        "Lisa: Yes, I am.",
        "Cleo: Oh, good, I wanted to make sure I was talking to the right person. My name is Cleo Babbitt. I'm looking for a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: The point is to solve for X.",
        "J.J.: I know you have to solve for X.",
        "Parker: Do you want me to help you or not?",
        "J.J.: You know, just forget it, okay? I'll fail math because I'm stupid.",
        "Parker: You're not stupid.",
        "J.J.: Well, I can't understand a word Ms. Marston says. We can't even read her handwriting on the board.",
        "Parker: Yeah, she's the worst. I had her last year, remember? Okay, so you wanna get X on one --",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "J.J.: It's your girlfriend!",
        "Parker: I don't have a girlfriend. Hey. That for me?",
        "Faith: Nope. J.J. ordered it. My dance club is selling them. It's a charity.",
        "Parker: What? Tap shoes for orphans?",
        "Faith: Very funny. I tried picking out a good one.",
        "J.J.: I bet she'll love it.",
        "Parker: Now who has a girlfriend?",
        "J.J.: I don't have a girlfriend. This plant is for Mom for Mother's day.",
        "Faith: And the card has how much --",
        "Parker: You ordered a plant for someone who walked out on you? Man, you are stupid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Wait a minute. You think Brad and I are together?",
        "Jack: Hey, its okay, I understand. You guys work together, you're friends -- things happen.",
        "Katie: To Brad, who would've gotten us both killed tonight if it wasn't for you.",
        "Jack: But the point is you guys got a great thing going. Everybody can see that. You're a huge hit.",
        "Katie: We're a hit because deep down inside, we can't stand each other.",
        "Jack: Whatever you want to call it, you guys have chemistry.",
        "Katie: We're an act! And okay, maybe Brad and I have gotten a little closer lately because he doesn't do so many things that drive me crazy. Yeah, I guess I started to think of him as --",
        "Jack: You don't owe me an explanation. But the last time we were at the farm I said some things, and maybe -- maybe I was too cautious. But we've both been kicked around and I didn't want to add to it. And it's right -- you're right for going after what you want. And if Brad makes you happy --",
        "Katie: Brad makes me laugh. He also drives me up a wall. He's the last guy I would go for. And just because you said you weren't interested, doesn't mean I'm gonna go throw myself to someone else.",
        "Jack: Oh, wait a second, I never said I wasn't interested!",
        "Katie: No, you just showed up here with a scowl on your face and barely said two words to me.",
        "Jack: Well, that's because when we were together in Oakdale the last time, you read me the riot act. Do you remember that?",
        "Katie: Because you and Brad were talking behind my back. It didn't exactly make me happy.",
        "Jack: So I thought -- I just thought I'd give you some space. And then Brad said that you two had gotten tight --",
        "Katie: What did he say? What exactly did he say?",
        "Jack: It doesn't matter.",
        "Katie: It might! If Brad's trying to get you to believe that he and I are something that we're not. I think there's a little sabotage going on here? Starting with Brad telling me that you would never be over Carly and I was just wasting my time.",
        "Jack: So if you and Brad --",
        "Katie: There is no me and Brad. We work together, that's it. You know for a detective, you're pretty dumb.",
        "Jack: So, wait a minute. When you and Brad, you went to that country inn to set-up the whole soiree for Henry and Vienna? You slept together, right?",
        "Katie: We slept -- together. Fully clothed on top of the bed. We had gotten drunk off of too much champagne, we played a board game, I beat the pants off him. It's just an expression by the way. His pants stayed on the whole time until the next morning when he took a shower and then the towel dropped --",
        "Jack: He was always so pathetic at board games.",
        "Katie: The point is I'm not interested in Brad, I never was and I never will be.",
        "Jack: So my brother was pulling my -- pulling my strings to get me to think what he wanted me to think.",
        "Katie: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.",
        "Brad: What?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cleo: I ran out of room in the job experience section.",
        "Lisa: Oh, well, it certainly does look thorough.",
        "Cleo: Yeah, I started working when I was 10 years old. My first job, I was a babysitter. And then I was a housecleaner. And then I mowed a lawn. And then after that I worked at a library. And a diner. And the Laundromat. Oh, I have, on the back I have all of my references and their phone numbers -- you can call them. But it's long distance. I hope that's okay. I come from Turlock, that's in California.",
        "Lisa: Oh, you're a long way from home.",
        "Cleo: Yeah, I was on my way to Chicago, but I just think it's so wonderful here and I'd love to stay. It's just that I need a job and I can do anything. I can be a chambermaid, or a waitress, or a desk clerk.",
        "Lisa: Well, okay, I can't promise anything, really, but I could start you in housekeeping on the housekeeping staff.",
        "Cleo: Really? That would be amazing. I'm a really good housecleaner. You won't regret it.",
        "Lisa: Then you just go right down the hall, you see right down there, go to housekeeping, ask them to give you a uniform. And I'll look this over, check out some of your references.",
        "Cleo: Okay, they love me a lot, you're gonna see. Thank you so much, Mrs. Grimaldi.",
        "Will: Was that --",
        "Lisa: Oh, hi, did you forget something?",
        "Will: Yeah, Gwen left her notebook here. Was that Cleo Babbitt?",
        "Lisa: You know her? Isn't that funny? I was just thinking about giving her a job here.",
        "Will: That would be a big mistake.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, Sage. Hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Sage: Jill and I had play date and now her mom's waiting for us while we pick up some food. Jill, this is my aunt Gwen.",
        "Gwen: Hey, nice to meet you, Jill.",
        "Jill: Same here. I better go check if our order's ready.",
        "Sage: Okay, I'll be there in a second.",
        "Gwen: Jill seems really nice. You guys having take-out tonight?",
        "Sage: No, it's for her family. After her mom dropped me off at the farm, they're gonna pick up her dad from work and drive out to the lake for a picnic.",
        "Gwen: Wow that sounds like fun. Hey, if Will and I put a bunch of goodies into a basket, do you think we could talk you, and Parker, and J.J. into joining us for a picnic of our own one night.",
        "Sage: Sure, I guess.",
        "Gwen: You know, Sweetie, I know that it seems like everybody has their mom and their dad, and they're all doing stuff together, but remember you still have your dad. And you have me and Will, and you've got your brothers, and your aunt Emma, and all your cousins.",
        "Sage: I know, but it's just not the same without Mommy. It's just, all my friends keep talking about Mother's day. Jill and her mom are going to a crafts workshop to make scrapbooks.",
        "Gwen: Does that sound like fun to you?",
        "Sage: Mommy used to let me help her put pictures in our albums. I loved it.",
        "Gwen: You know what? At Oakdale University, where I go to school, the art department is offering a whole series of workshops this summer, not just scrap-booking but jewelry making and a bunch of other stuff that you and I could do together. Should I sign us up?",
        "Sage: Really?",
        "Gwen: Absolutely. We could have a special date, just the two of us, once a week. Would that be cool?",
        "Sage: Totally.",
        "Gwen: Okay, it's a deal then. All right? Here's to a great summer.",
        "Jill: We better get this to my mom.",
        "Sage: Okay. See you soon, Aunt Gwen. Bye.",
        "Gwen: Bye.",
        "Jill: Nice meeting you.",
        "Gwen: It was really nice meeting you, Jill.",
        "Sage: Bye.",
        "Gwen: Bye, Sage.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yeah, you owe us one, don't you Brad?",
        "Brad: Hey, man, you're the detective here. You know, you know these things. I'm a civilian, and an optimist. I mean, look at me. One minute I'm unemployed, and the next I'm a TV star.",
        "Katie: This is an apology?",
        "Brad: The point is that after some time spent with the local P.D., I realized how dangerous the situation was. I almost got you killed, Katie. And you too, Jack. And just because I blew off the threats from that woman. I'm really sorry for putting at risk. And I just hope that you'll let me make it up to you.",
        "Jack: Oh, you'll make it up to us.",
        "Katie: One question, Brad. What exactly did you tell Jack about you and me?",
        "Brad: About you and me?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brad: Well, let me think. Don't take this the wrong way, but I think I might have told him that you finally came to your senses.",
        "Katie: About what?",
        "Brad: About us working together. You said so yourself. You thought the contest was a good idea. And look at the ratings, they are through the roof!",
        "Katie: This is not about work! What did you tell him about us, us?",
        "Brad: Us us?",
        "Katie: You let him think that we were together!",
        "Brad: No, no, never. No, all I said was --",
        "Jack: You said that you spent the night together, Brad.",
        "Brad: We did.",
        "Jack: And then when you got naked, everything changed.",
        "Brad: I thought we cleared this. My towel dropped, Katie got an eyeful. Just an accident.",
        "Jack: When you told me about it -- come on, you didn't make it sound like the two of you had sex.",
        "Brad: I never said we had sex. If that's where your mind goes, then maybe you need to think about that.",
        "Jack: Gee, I am thinking about it. Let me tell you, I'm not liking what I'm thinking.",
        "Katie: This whole thing started way before the towel thing, Brad. You told Jack that I needed time when you know I wanted to talk to him?",
        "Brad: Then why didn't you talk to him, Katie? Maybe because you did need time?",
        "Katie: That wasn't your call to make. You told him to go to Chicago.",
        "Brad: Not true. Not true. No, he had some work thing in Chicago. You had some work thing Chicago!",
        "Jack: Yes, but you were all for it, Brad. Come on.",
        "Brad: No, I've been all for you getting over your ex. I've been banging that drum since I got back into Oakdale and you know it.",
        "Jack: Except when it serves you to have me out of town. Right?",
        "Brad: What? Did I think it was a good idea for you to leave town? Yes, I did. Because you two kids are way too tongue-tied and way too scared to make a mistake. I thought it'd give you a chance to calm down. And then maybe you'd realize that Carly's not coming back and neither is Mike. And then maybe you'd give each other a chance and find some happiness. That's what life's about. Am I right? Am I right?",
        "Jack: Do you believe him?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Brad: Why would I lie?",
        "Jack: Because you wanted Katie for yourself. Don't deny it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: I am not stupid!",
        "Parker: You don't even know where mom is or if she's ever coming back.",
        "J.J.: She is coming back.",
        "Parker: Why? Because you bought a plant for her?",
        "J.J.: No, because she misses us.",
        "Parker: Dream on. She's got a whole new life. She doesn't need us anymore.",
        "J.J.: She does so need us. I know she misses us.",
        "Parker: Right, right, that's why she took off.",
        "J.J.: She would do anything in the world to be back here.",
        "Parker: Right, so that's why she took off. Because she needs us so much.",
        "J.J.: You're wrong. She's coming back.",
        "Parker: And then what? Okay, as soon as Jack or any other cop knows she's here, they'll arrest her and she'll go to prison. Is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Cleo Babbitt thinks she looks like -- no, I'm sorry.",
        "Will: You should've seen her that day. She was wearing a blonde wig and she was dressed in all of Gwen's clothes.",
        "Lisa: That's creepy.",
        "Will: Yeah, I know it wasn't her right away, but it fooled my mom.",
        "Lisa: Barbara saw her?",
        "Will: Yeah, she came over right before I got home, and Cleo neglected to mention the fact that she'd broken in and it wasn't Gwen.",
        "Lisa: Oh, Dear. You know how Barbara gets when she's angry with somebody.",
        "Will: Which is why I wanted to warn you.",
        "Lisa: What is this girl still doing in town?",
        "Will: I don't know. After I threw her out, she came back the next day with flowers, which is why we didn't call the cops 'cause Gwen felt sorry for her, and now she's here trying to get a job where Gwen works!",
        "Lisa: I see what you mean. Girl must be stalking her.",
        "Cleo: I'm not like that. I'm not. I didn't even know that Gwen was going to be working here. I just was responding to an ad that I saw in the paper. See? It says right there, applications accepted between 6:00 and 8:00 P.M. Mrs. Grimaldi, please, I'll a different shift. I'll work the graveyard shift. Gwen won't even know that I'm here. I'm a good worker. And I would never do anything to hurt Gwen. I'm her biggest fan.",
        "Lisa: I'm very sorry, Cleo. But I cannot hire you. It just simply wouldn't work.",
        "Cleo: Please, Mrs. Grimaldi, there's got to be a way that we can work this out.",
        "Lisa: There is no way. I'm sorry, but I cannot hire you as I've said. Look, Will's mother, Barbara, I think you've met her, lives here in this hotel. She happens to be a very, very dear friend of mine. And she was very upset that you tried to impersonate her daughter-in-law. And you broke in their house. Now, Will and Gwen are very close to me, they are like family. So, I am sorry, I cannot hire -- excuse me, I have to take this call.",
        "Cleo: But maybe we could talk about this another time.",
        "Lisa: We cannot talk about it again, I am very sorry, I cannot hire you, now go down the hall, leave your uniform with housekeeping. Be on your way.",
        "Cleo: Can I ask you something? What did I ever do to you that was so wrong?",
        "Will: Aside from breaking into my house and pretending to be my wife?",
        "Cleo: I already explained that --",
        "Will: Yeah, and I didn't call the cops, which was a big mistake because you showed up the next day.",
        "Cleo: But Gwen was so nice to me.",
        "Will: You lied to her.",
        "Cleo: That's not true. Everything that I said was the truth. I'm her biggest fan. She believed me.",
        "Will: Well, I don't.",
        "Cleo: But why? I mean, if Gwen trusts me --",
        "Will: She didn't see you wearing her clothes and that wig. You're a stalker, Cleo, and this is sick. This is your last warning, you get out of town and you leave us alone or I'm calling the cops.",
        "Cleo: I feel really sorry for you.",
        "Gwen: Actually, I have a big study group with me here. I'll just give you the list, it'll be easier, it's mostly coffees or stuff like that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I thought the takeout line was over here.",
        "Waitress: It is. We're just a little short staffed tonight. I'll be with you in a minute.",
        "Jade: Yeah, it's just, I got a lot of hungry kids waiting for dinner. So --",
        "Waitress: I'll just take your list. I'm sorry, I'll be right back.",
        "Gwen: Why can't you just leave me alone?",
        "Jade: Gwen, not everything is about you. Some of us who actually have to live in the real world have things to do.",
        "Gwen: Like sending me an e-mail from my sister?",
        "Jade: I already told Will --",
        "Gwen: No, I know what you told Will, and he didn't believe you either. You routed that email through Carly's account, but you were either, I don't know, too lazy or too stupid to cover your tracks.",
        "Jade: It wasn't me.",
        "Gwen: Well, it wasn't Carly. And you're the only one with a motive.",
        "Jade: Oh, a motive? Gwen, please, I don't want anything from you.",
        "Gwen: No? Then what's Cleo Babbitt doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: Well, I know that Mom isn't coming home right away. But when she does, well, yeah, well -- she'll probably have to go to jail. But that's why Faith said not to get her flowers, but to get her a plant instead.",
        "Parker: Oh, so this was your idea?",
        "J.J.: Well, she was right. And I'll just plant it in the garden so it can grow. And I don't care what you think! It's my present, not yours. Just get out of my way!",
        "Parker: Why would you do that to him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Admit it. Admit it, Brad! You've were using this whole misunderstanding to get closer to Katie.",
        "Brad: Did Katie and I get closer because you were too much of a bonehead to take the next step after you kissed her? Yeah. She needed someone to talk to. I was a friend -- I listened.",
        "Katie: And kept telling me that it wasn't over Carly.",
        "Brad: He isn't.",
        "Jack: That's not true.",
        "Brad: Then why'd you go to Chicago?",
        "Jack: Because you made it sound, Brad, like you had some kind of insider knowledge that she needed some space. You know? All right, all right, yeah, I was a bonehead for listening to you. But you gotta admit, you were less than honest. Less than honest, right now, when you said that you were giving us a chance to get together.",
        "Brad: How was I less than honest?",
        "Jack: I called you at the inn. Remember? You pretended I was Emma? Yeah, you wanted her to think that I didn't call.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I remember that. I asked you who was on the phone and you lied to me!",
        "Brad: I didn't lie to you.",
        "Katie: Excuse me?",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, okay. I didn't tell you it was Jack because you were already so upset about him. I didn't want to add to it. Know how you get Katie. You know how you get -- all those questions. Did he ask about me, why didn't he ask about me, what's wrong with me, why doesn't he like me? Come on you know exactly what I'm talking about.",
        "Jack: I was only keeping her at arm's length because of you.",
        "Brad: You want to blame me for all this? Be my guest. Make it my fault that two people who are supposed to be adults couldn't manage to take it to the next level. But the truth is, if you'd been ready? You would have made it happen, no matter what I did. And you know it.",
        "Katie: I cannot believe you're blaming us? You're the one with the agenda, Brad!",
        "Brad: At least I had one. You two were so hung up on your fears and your past and your insecurities, you couldn't get off square one. And that, my brother and my partner, is not my fault.",
        "[Pager beeping]",
        "Jack: Okay, I've got some business with the chief here in town.",
        "Brad: Which is my fault. Because I made love to a woman a long time ago who was all too willing and way too nuts. But you know what? I apologized for that. The rest of it? Is on you two.",
        "Jack: If Katie and I had issues --",
        "Brad: If? What are you talking about? You two are the poster couple how not to handle yourself after you get dumped. I know that's harsh and that Carly and Mike and whatever his name is -- the Australian guy did their share, but come on, be honest with yourself. Am I the reason -- am I really the reason why you're not popping a bottle of champagne and settling back on a bear skin rug?",
        "Katie: Please tell me you don't have a bear skin rug.",
        "Jack: No, but I think my brother does. I'll call you when I get back to Oakdale. And you -- don't think you're off the hook.",
        "Brad: Not since I was born, Jack. But like you said, you've got issues. What?",
        "Katie: You're jealous.",
        "Brad: I'm jealous? I'm jealous of Jack? He's got three kids, that are real cute, I'll give you that, but he's also got a balloon mortgage and a really bad pension --",

        "Brad: Happy? Okay, let me tell you something about my brother, all right. He's honest, he's responsible, he's smart, but happy? I don't think so. Because happy makes him scared. It's why he married Carly. It's why he's stuck in a dead-end job that takes him to the morgue once a week. And for some reason I can't possibly begin to understand, he loves it. So don't blame me if he's not happy.",
        "Katie: You're jealous.",

        "Katie: And I know what you told your friend Lynn. That I changed you. But that's because you were scared of getting killed, let's not pretend it's true!",
        "Brad: I don't know if you changed me but I'm definitely different, Katie. Look I turned down Vienna.",
        "Katie: Who was engaged to my best friend?",
        "Brad: That was after he dumped her at the altar. She was technically a free woman. But I could tell that she was still in love with him. And I said no.",

And, look, I know that I act a little funny sometimes, and fine, I'm not talented like Gwen, and I'm not good looking like you are, but I'm not bad.
