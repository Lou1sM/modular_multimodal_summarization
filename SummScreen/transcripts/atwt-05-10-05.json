        "Jen is worried after she oversleeps, but Mike assures her that after his talk with Dusty, he will be more understanding. Meanwhile, Dusty is at the Street Jeans office meeting with Carly in order to hire her to help out. Carly is not sure why they would be looking to hire another designer since Street Jeans is Jen's Company. Dusty explains that Jen is pregnant and getting married. Based on that information, Carly is more then happy to join the Company. Jen enters to find Dusty and Carly with their heads together. After Carly leaves, Jen lights into Dusty for making such a big decision without her. She is dead set against working with Carly, but Dusty tells Jen she had better figure out a way to get onboard, because they are hiring and keeping Carly. Later when Carly arrives back ready to work, Jen is the only one in the office, and tells a surprised Carly that she was not involved in the hiring decision, and has no interest in working with Carly. Casey and Celia reunite in front of Gwen, who is visibly bothered by their closeness. Casey even seals their reunion by asking Celia to the prom. Of course, she happily accepts. Will finds out from Mike that he and Jen are getting married and having a baby. His nonchalant reaction surprises Mike. Will runs into Casey and Celia at the diner and is rude to Gwen, and takes off in a huff. Celia makes an excuse to Casey, and leaves to go find Will. She later finds him on the roof, but soon Celia finds herself telling Will to stop feeling sorry for himself. Holden apologizes to Lily for his reaction to Keith, and ends up admitting to being jealous. Keith tries to put off Vin who is after Keith for the money he is owed. He sells his watch to pay Vin some of the money he is due. He runs into Holden right after and accuses him of following him. Lily is developing strong feelings for Keith, but is bothered by seeing him with Vin, and wondering if he is hiding something from her. She talks to Carly about her feelings, but Carly is unsure whether Holden is over Lily. Later, when Lily stops by Keith's with a picnic basket, she can't help but snoop. She comes across Julia's wedding band from when she was married to Jack hidden in a desk. She then hears Keith right outside the front door about to come in."

        "Mike: Morning, sleepy head.",
        "Jennifer: What are you doing up so early?",
        "Mike: Early? It's 9:00.",
        "Jennifer: What? Why didn't you wake me up? Now I'm going to be late!",
        "Mike: So? It's one of the perks of being the boss.",
        "Jennifer: No, being a boss means you have to set an example.",
        "Mike: Eh, come on. That's Dusty talking, not you.",
        "Jennifer: No, Mike, it's me talking. I have to prove to him that I can handle my job and being pregnant.",
        "Mike: You don't have to prove anything to anybody. You're the boss. You call the shots.",
        "Jennifer: Well, tell that to Dusty.",
        "Mike: Okay, I did.",
        "Jennifer: Well, he probably didn't hear you. Now, are you done in the bathroom?",
        "Mike: Depends.",
        "Jennifer: No, don't tempt me.",
        "Mike: I wanna tempt you. You drive me crazy. I wanna keep you here all day. All day.",
        "Jennifer: Well, unfortunately, you should've woken me up sooner. Now, you have to wait.",
        "Mike: Aw. Look, you're wrong about Dusty. I'm telling you, he heard me loud and clear. He's not going to be breathing down your neck anymore. I definitely set him straight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: See, this is really good. Strong, without calling attention to itself. I love all these classic influences.",
        "Carly: So, when did you learn all this fashion-speak? I'm impressed.",
        "Dusty: They say you're as good as what you know.",
        "Carly: I think they're right. So, excuse me while I catch up here. But, when did you become in charge of Street Jeans. Where's Craig? 7",
        "Dusty: Craig first left the company, and then he left town.",
        "Carly: Just like that? Are you sure he wasn't thrown out of town, tarred, feathered? That I would believe.",
        "Dusty: I don't know, and frankly, I don't care.",
        "Carly: Because you are in charge now?",
        "Dusty: You know it. And I'll tell you what -- I'm really interested in your input in our new line.",
        "Carly: You are, are you?",
        "Dusty: I am. Your work speaks for itself. When can you start?",
        "Carly: As soon as you tell me what's really going on here.",
        "Dusty: I beg your pardon?",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. Dusty, give me a little credit. I've been down the runway a few times. I know that Street Jeans is Jennifer's company. So, where is she in all this?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I've got it covered.",
        "Waitress: Five bucks says you only get his order.",
        "Gwen: Ten says I make him forget he's even hungry.",
        "Casey: Sorry, I'm not really ready yet.",
        "Gwen: Take your time. But, there was something I just wanted to talk to you about.",
        "Casey: Hey.",
        "Celia: Hey.",
        "Casey: Did you get my messages?",
        "Celia: All five of them.",
        "Gwen: Something to drink?",
        "Celia: Some orange juice, please.",
        "Casey: Yeah, that sounds good. So, what do you think? Can we get past what happened last night?",
        "Celia: I'm here, aren't I?",
        "Casey: So we're cool?",
        "Celia: Yeah, we're cool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vin: I thought you'd never get up.",
        "Keith: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Vin: I told you, Morrissey, I wasn't leaving. Not till I get what I came here for. So, let's get down to business, huh, while I'm still in a good mood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You scared me.",
        "Holden: I'm sorry. I probably should've knocked first. Old habits die hard. I'm sorry I scared you.",
        "Lily: No, I just wasn't expecting anyone, especially not you.",
        "Holden: From now on, should I call before I come? I wouldn't want to walk in on anything -- you don't want me to see.",
        "Lily: Like what?",
        "Holden: Like, for instance, you and your new pal, Keith.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Look, if you're here to start a fight, I'm really not interested, so you can just go.",
        "Holden: No, no, I'm sorry. That came out wrong. Kind of like last night. I -- that's why I'm here. I'm here to apologize.",
        "Lily: You want to apologize?",
        "Holden: Yeah, for everything I did to you in public. I reacted like a jealous husband, and next time it happens, I'll keep it to myself.",
        "Lily: Hold on a second. Let's just -- let's take a couple steps back. You're admitting that you're jealous of Keith?",
        "Holden: Yep. It was a little tough, seeing you in the arms of another guy.",
        "Lily: Whoa, wait a minute. So, this is --? How does this work here? You get to move on with your life, see anyone that you want to, but I can't?",
        "Holden: No, that's not what I'm saying. All I'm trying to say here is that I have been a little unfair to Keith.",
        "Lily: That's a polite way to say it.",
        "Holden: If I overreacted, I'm sorry. Couldn't help it. I just don't want you to get hurt, ever.",
        "Lily: You really think Keith could hurt me?",
        "Holden: Your mother seems to think that Keith could hurt you, and your mother has been getting to me lately.",
        "Lily: What has my mother been saying?",
        "Holden: You know what, just forget about it. If she wants to keep up with this crusade against Keith, she can do it. I'm not going to support her on it. So, am I forgiven?",
        "Lily: Forgiveness is a tall order, Holden.",
        "Holden: Well, just be careful, and try to take it slow.",
        "Lily: Like you took it slowly with Julia?",
        "Holden: No. That's my point.",
        "Lily: Okay.",
        "Holden: I don't want anybody to get hurt again. I don't want you to make the same mistake that I made. I don't want the kids to be hurt. I don't want you to get hurt.",
        "Lily: I'm looking after the children. I'm looking out for myself. I have to say, I'm doing a pretty good job at it, too. I just want to live my life. I just want to find a little happiness again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Look, you get out of here, you don't ever come back. Do you understand? When we meet, I'll tell you where, I'll tell you when.",
        "Vin: Amazing how some people think they're still in the driver's seat. Time to wake up, Morrissey. I'm behind the wheel now, not you.",
        "Keith: All right, look, I've got a score to settle, okay? Yeah, but, right now, I think it's important that you keep a low profile, all right? What if Lily was to come in here and see you?",
        "Vin: No skin off my back. I'm not the one's got something to hide. In fact, maybe I should invite her over. I still think she'd be real interested to hear the stories I could tell about you. About what you've done.",
        "Keith: Well, I don't think you should go anywhere near her.",
        "Vin: See, that's what I'm talking about. You're telling me what to do and you've got no juice, Keith. In fact, you've got nothing. Not even what you owe me. Now, I've been more than patient. If this was angel you was dealing with, or Jimmy, back in Chicago, you wouldn't even be talking. And you sure as hell wouldn't be standing.",
        "Keith: You know, this is just a lot of tough talk. It's nothing more than talk.",
        "Vin: All right, fine. How about this? Now that I know where your girlfriend lives, I can show up anytime. I can tell her whatever I want. I can do to her whatever I want.",
        "Keith: Listen, don't go anywhere near her, 'cause if you do, I will take you apart, and you know that I can do that. And I will do that.",
        "Vin: Well, I'm going to take that as a serious threat, pal --",
        "Keith: You should.",
        "Vin: On account I know what you're capable of, and just how far you'll go. So, you take this as a serious one. Give me what you owe me today, or I will bring down a world of pain on everything you care about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: When you didn't answer my calls, I figured you were pretty upset.",
        "Celia: I was, but not with you -- with myself. I shouldn't have stuck my nose into Will and Ali's business.",
        "Casey: True, but I shouldn't have come down on you so hard, either.",
        "Celia: You were right, I was wrong. And I get mad when that happens.",
        "Casey: Good to know. I'll try to watch out.",
        "Celia: I talked to Will, though. Told him I'd let Alison know he wasn't the one who broke into her place.",
        "Casey: You went to him? That was brave.",
        "Celia: He's not as scary as all that.",
        "Casey: He's a good guy. He's just a little hard to reach sometimes.",
        "Celia: So are you.",
        "Casey: What, hard to reach?",
        "Celia: No, a good guy.",
        "Gwen: Here you go. You two ready to order?",
        "Casey: No. Actually, we haven't even been thinking about food.",
        "Gwen: Well, take your time. I've got all day. Just give me a call when you're ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I can set you up in a beautiful office right away, if it's not too soon to get started.",
        "Carly: Shouldn't Jennifer be here? If this were my company, and I was hiring a new designer, I would want to speak with her myself.",
        "Dusty: Well, Jennifer has been somewhat detained.",
        "Carly: But she is behind this, isn't she?",
        "Dusty: She'd certainly be the first to admit she needs help.",
        "Carly: I thought Street Jeans was flying high.",
        "Dusty: Oh, it is. It is. Jennifer's just got a lot going on right now. That's what you're going to do, give her support so she doesn't feel so stretched thin.",
        "Carly: Well, it's not like she's got 500 jobs, you know? What's the problem here?",
        "Dusty: Well, I guess when you're pregnant and getting married, it can feel like --",
        "Carly: Wait a minute. Jennifer's pregnant?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I thought you knew. I thought everybody knew.",
        "Carly: No, I was out of town. I didn't know. So Jennifer and Mike are having a baby, and they're getting married. Wow, well, what else did I miss?",
        "Dusty: Do you see my point?",
        "Carly: Yes, I see your point. Of course she's going to need help. Is she working at home? Because I'd really love to go and congratulate her.",
        "Dusty: Wait a second. Let's close up here first. Can I count on you, or what?",
        "Carly: Absolutely. I'm in.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, I know I'm late, but I picked up this fabric. I know you're going to love it. Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi!",
        "Jennifer: So what's going on?",
        "Carly: A baby, you and Mike, and a wedding! You must be over the moon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Lily, the last thing I want to do is upset you. Or criticize you as a mom.",
        "Lily: You have to trust me. To live my life, to make my own choices. You chose to end our marriage, and I have worked very hard to come to grips with that -- that it's over. But I think I finally have.",
        "Holden: I understand.",
        "Lily: I really hope you do.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Holden: I'll get it. I'm on my way out.",
        "Lily: Holden? I am taking things slowly.",
        "Holden: Good. I just want you to be happy. I was just leaving.",
        "Lily: Hi, Keith.",
        "Keith: Hey, hi.",
        "Lily: They're beautiful.",
        "Keith: They should be. I picked 'em from your garden.",
        "Holden: I stopped by to tell Lily that I'm sorry about what happened at Yo's last night. The same goes for you. I was out of line.",
        "Keith: You don't have to apologize to me. I just want to be left alone and, you know, live a life here.",
        "Holden: Right. Take care, Lily.",
        "Lily: Yeah. You, too.",
        "Keith: You okay?",
        "Lily: I'm glad you're here. I was going to call you, but I was afraid I'd wake you up.",
        "Keith: You can wake me up anytime.",
        "Lily: I'll put these in some water.",
        "Keith: Okay. Maybe we can go get breakfast or something.",
        "Lily: I'd love that, but I've got a million things to do, errands.",
        "Keith: Ahh, there I go, jumping the gun a bit.",
        "Lily: No, no, no, it's not that. It's just -- we're just getting to know each other. It takes some, that's all.",
        "Keith: You're right. I want you to get to know me. I want you to see me as an open book.",
        "Lily: Good, because honesty is very important to me.",
        "Keith: Honesty is the best policy. I'll always be straight with you.",
        "Lily: Good. I'll be right back.",
        "Keith: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Hey, Will. What's up, man? Come on in. Can I get you something?",
        "Will: No, I'm fine. Is Jen still here?",
        "Mike: No, you just missed her.",
        "Will: She called me on my cell.",
        "Mike: Yeah, well, we've got some pretty exciting news. But she'd probably want to be the one to tell you.",
        "Will: Or you could. You guys share everything with each other, right? So, I'm here now, why don't you just tell me?",
        "Mike: We're getting married.",
        "Will: Wow. That's exciting. Hey, congratulations.",
        "Mike: Thank you, but there's more. We're also having a baby.",
        "Will: Talk about your one-two punch. That's big.",
        "Mike: Yeah, you get to be an uncle, and you get a new brother.",
        "Will: As long as nobody calls me Uncle Will, I'll be fine.",
        "Mike: You sure? I mean, look, I know this is a lot to take in all at once.",
        "Will: No, I'm fine. I'm happy for you and Jen. It's really cool. It's just, you know, it's kind of happening a little fast. That's all.",
        "Mike: My head's still spinning.",
        "Will: What about Jen? She's got her company, a wedding to plan and I guess morning sickness now, you know?",
        "Mike: Well, she's delegating. Your mom's going to be in charge of the wedding.",
        "Will: My mom? Wow, that's -- she's planning the wedding.",
        "Mike: Yeah, so be prepared. Look, man, I know Jen would love for you to be an usher.",
        "Will: Well, I guess if that's what she wants, then she'll ask me.",
        "Mike: Well, I'm asking you now. You up for it?",
        "Will: Okay.",
        "Mike: You sure everything's all right?",
        "Will: Yeah, everything's fine. It's just, you know, like you said, it's surprising. I gotta go. I'll see you later.",
        "Mike: Jennifer's at the office if you wanna stop by there.",
        "Will: Just tell her I came by here and I'll catch her later.",
        "Mike: All right. See you later, Uncle Will.",
        "Will: See you around.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: I had a real good time last night.",
        "Lily: Yes, yes, I did too, except for the Holden incident, of course. And that other guy.",
        "Keith: What guy?",
        "Lily: The guy. The guy that was outside?",
        "Keith: Oh, that boob. I don't know.",
        "Lily: He got under your skin.",
        "Keith: I mean, they're just bugging me out there, you know? Let's not even talk about it. You know, I didn't realize that you were such a great dancer.",
        "Lily: Oh, I love to dance, but I'm a bit out of practice. I was so exhausted I barely made it upstairs before I crashed. How about you?",
        "Keith: I was out like a light the minute I --",
        "Lily: Really?",
        "Keith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: You went straight home?",
        "Keith: Well, I tried to find an all-night flower store, but no luck.",
        "Lily: Right. That explains it.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? I should get going, too. I've got other things to do today.",
        "Lily: Full day ahead of you?",
        "Keith: Well, you know, I've got to move out of Lakeview, I gotta do some laundry, rob a bank, you know, just the day-to-day things. Maybe we can hook up later.",
        "Lily: Will that be before or after the bank robbery?",
        "Keith: After, so I could take you out --",
        "Lily: Oh.",
        "Keith: For a fancy --",
        "Lily: I see. That sounds dangerous and exciting.",
        "Keith: Just like you. See you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You look beautiful. When are you due? How do you feel? I hope you're not getting morning sickness. That can really sneak up on you.",
        "Jennifer: I can handle it.",
        "Dusty: And what's this great idea you were talking about?",
        "Carly: Okay, well, I just need a little while to take care of some things.",
        "Dusty: All right?",
        "Carly: All right. And then I'm all yours.",
        "Dusty: Can you start today?",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Carly: Yeah, if that's what you guys want. Oh, I'll take this outside. Jennifer, I'm really looking forward to this.",
        "Jennifer: What was that all about? It sounds like you just hired Carly.",
        "Dusty: I did.",
        "Jennifer: Behind my back?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Carly, look, I need to stop over.",
        "Carly: Yeah, all right. What's the matter?",
        "Lily: Can you come over now?",
        "Carly: Yes. Yeah, I'm on my way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I was gonna discus it with you before she came over, but, as usual, you're late.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, no, no. Don't try to throw this back at me. The fact that you even set up a meeting with her without my knowledge is outrageous.",
        "Dusty: Why? She's a good designer and you need help. Don't feel so threatened, all right?",
        "Jennifer: Threatened? Dusty, I built this company on my own, out of nothing. I'm not threatened by anyone, but I'll be damned if I let Carly Tenney design so much as even a sock for me.",
        "Dusty: It's already a done deal.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then undo it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Carly: If you're serious about pursuing something with Keith, lay your cards out on the table. Make sure he does the same thing.",
        "Lily: I don't want him to start thinking I don't trust him.",
        "Carly: Do you?",
        "Keith: Well, I want you to stop following me. I want you to leave me alone, 'cause I don't like it. I don't like it at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: As usual, you're overreacting.",
        "Jennifer: Overreacting? You hire someone behind my back, and I'm overreacting?",
        "Dusty: You're pregnant. Doesn't it make sense to hire some help around here?",
        "Jennifer: Hiring Carly is not my idea of help, okay? I don't completely trust her. And if you do, then I don't know if I can completely trust you.",
        "Dusty: Relax, I'm not trying to replace you. I'm trying to hold onto you.",
        "Jennifer: You've got a funny way of showing it.",
        "Dusty: Would you rather have Carly in here, taking care of your troubles? Or me, breathing down your neck all the time?",
        "Jennifer: None of the above! I would like for you to leave me alone and let me do my job! Well, I want you to tell Carly that there's been a big misunderstanding, and that we are not hiring anyone at Street Jeans.",
        "Dusty: I won't do that.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then I will.",
        "Dusty: You've got to stop being so stubborn.",
        "Jennifer: You are the stubborn one! You refuse even to give me a chance!",
        "Dusty: I've given you more than a chance. You can't even make your own press conference on time. I was answering questions yesterday, Jen, that I have no business answering.",
        "Jennifer: I got sick. I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: Sorry? What about this morning? You were an hour late.",
        "Jennifer: I overslept. It happens.",
        "Dusty: Apparently with you, it does, all the time.",
        "Jennifer: This is not a factory, Dusty. I'm not punching the clock, okay? Just because I'm not in the office, does not mean my mind is not working. I can do my job anywhere, anytime.",

        "Carly: Like what?",
        "Lily: I don't know, either he's done something wrong, or he's involved in something that he doesn't want anybody to know about. Here I am, I'm the one person defending him. To Holden and to my mother, and they keep telling me to be careful. That I don't know him. That I don't know what I'm getting myself into. And what if they're right? What if I don't know Keith as well as I thought I did?",

        "Gwen: Oh, no, we had a bad first date. I guess he's holding it against me. His loss.",
        "Casey: You gotta just roll with it when it comes to Will. He's still trying to figure himself out, you know.",
        "Celia: I don't like the way he looked when he left. Maybe we should go see if he's okay.",
        "Casey: Will's been through a lot, you know. He's working stuff out. And he needs to do it on his own.",
        "Celia: He seems so -- I don't know, lonely.",

        "Gwen: Sure thing.",

        "Celia: I just remembered, I lost a scarf Ali loaned me. If I don't give it back to her she's gonna kill me.",

        "Jennifer: Oh, please. You've been here, what, all of ten minutes? And only because Craig bailed out. You could never have the drive, or the passion, or the commitment to Street Jeans that I do. I love this company. And I'll be damned if I put up with your archaic belief that I can't maintain the same level of excellence I've always expected of myself just because I'm pregnant!",
        "Dusty: You can not. It's already been proven.",
        "Jennifer: I will not work with Carly Tenney. I don't like her, I don't trust her, and I don't want her around! Do you understand that!?",
        "Dusty: Then you gotta quit. 'Cause she's coming on board. [Phone ringing] End of story. Yes.",

        "Keith: Well, I'll tell you what I don't believe. That little apology earlier. That was for Lily's benefit. You're still suspicious of me, aren't you?",
        "Holden: Suspicious, no. Just cautious. I'm cautious of anyone who gets involved with my kids in any way? I will protect them at all costs and you need to know that.",

        "Carly: Why didn't you just ask him about the guy? It doesn't necessarily mean trouble. Maybe Keith is embarrassed to tell you who he is.",
        "Lily: Yes, but that -- that has been the case on a few other occasions, but it's -- I don't know. I don't know why I let my mother or Holden get to me. It's not fair to keith.",
        "Carly: No, Lily, Keith did not kill Julia. Lester Sweeney killed Julia. I can imagine Lucinda coming up with her crackpot theories, but Holden ought to know that. He ought to know that Keith never would have hurt her.",
        "Lily: Let's hope. Holden came by here earlier.",
        "Carly: Oh?",

        "Carly: Actually it was Dusty Donovan who asked me. But he assures me that Jen's on board. And she's pregnant, so she needs the help. And it couldn't have come at a better time.",
        "Lily: Well, that's great news. That's exactly what you need right now. That's wonderful. I hope it all works out.",
        "Carly: Me, too. All right, it won't if I don't get myself back there, so I gotta run. Are you gonna be okay?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I'm okay. I feel better now that I talked to you. I'm glad you're back. I missed you.",
        "Carly: Me, too. Me, too. Listen to me, I don't want to count you and Holden out just yet. But if you're serious about pursuing something -- anything -- with Keith, lay your cards out on the table. Make sure he does the same thing.",
        "Lily: I just -- I don't want him to start thinking I don't trust him.",
