        "Alison: Wouldn't it be better if I just read what you wrote, got a feel for it and then called Craig and just gave him the gist?",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Alison: A lot of actresses do that, you know? It's just -- it's a way to make the words your own. It's more spontaneous or something.",
        "Paul: We need to do this my way.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but my way's easier.",
        "Paul: You have to say what's on the page, okay? You don't get to add anything. You don't get to change anything. This is -- this is important.",
        "Alison: Whatever. But I think you should pay me more if you're going to be more demanding.",
        "Paul: Why are you so obsessed with money?",
        "Alison: This is a job, Paul.",
        "Paul: And I'm going to pay you.",
        "Alison: Okay. Whatever, sure. You're good for money --",
        "Paul: But you're always -- I don't know, you're pushing for more. And then, you want to get paid in cash, right away?",
        "Alison: Because if Craig Montgomery finds out you've messed with his head, you, Lucinda, and whoever else is involved might not be around long enough for me to collect my money.",
        "Paul: Who else do you think is involved?",
        "Alison: Nobody. I don't -- it was just a guess. I don't know anything about anything.",
        "Paul: Did Craig get to you? Did he offer you money?",
        "Alison: No! What is your deal? I just -- look, let's just get this over with. I've got places I've got to be.",
        "Paul: Where?",
        "Alison: I've just got to do this thing. At this -- this thing I just -- look, why don't you show me what you want me to say, okay?",
        "Paul: Where is it you have to go?",
        "Alison: I'm meeting a friend, okay? Is that all right with you?",
        "Paul: A friend? So, you're friends with your drug dealer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Craig remembering]",
        "Alison: I know you tried to kill me, Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Well, most of the time, I could just walk right in. You're new, aren't you?",
        "Maid: Yes, ma'am. And today, Mr. Montgomery's been, well --",
        "Meg: In a bad mood?",
        "Maid: I don't want to lose my job.",
        "Meg: Okay, I'll tell you what, if he yells at you, I promise I'll take full responsibility.",
        "Meg: Craig? Craig?",
        "Maid: I'll clean that up.",
        "Meg: Craig, are you all right? Tell me what's wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: Why do you keep doing that?",
        "Jack: I like kissing you.",
        "Katie: Well, why do you keep apologizing if you -- you're saying you're sorry and its conf -- you like kissing me?",
        "Jack: Oh, yeah.",
        "Katie: Then why did you say keep saying --",
        "Jack: Well, because I thought -- I was saying I'm sorry because I thought you were.",
        "Katie: But I wasn't.",
        "Jack: You pulled away.",
        "Katie: You make this so difficult.",
        "Jack: I'm not the one who pulled away.",
        "Katie: I needed a breath. Haven't you ever needed a breath? A breath is not rejection, it's a breath. It's -- it took me by surprise.",
        "Jack: Excuse me for having an impulse.",
        "Katie: It's a little inconvenient, isn't it? Being on a plane -- not really very private. You could've had the impulse at the hotel.",
        "Jack: I did.",
        "Katie: You did?",
        "Jack: I've been wanting to kiss you ever since the last time, and that was like --",
        "Katie: I know, it feels like weeks ago.",
        "Jack: Yeah. And then there was Brad at the hotel and everything. And I had to work.",
        "Katie: But just now -- you couldn't help yourself.",
        "Jack: What -- you want me to say it?",
        "Katie: What I really want is this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cleo: God, please -- I need a sign. Should I pack up my bags and go home like Jade told me to, or should I go out of this room and go back -- hello, Carly. Welcome home.",
        "Carly: I am sorry, you must have me confused with someone else.",
        "Cleo: Nope, not a chance. Actually, there is a little bit of a chance, cause you're a lot prettier in person than you are in your photographs, but then again, I'm really good with faces, so it's only a little bit of a chance. I'm really excited to see you. I thought you'd be in a disguise with the whole, you know, on the run thing, but I guess you're not.",
        "Carly: Oh -- um, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not who you think I am. Yeah. I must have one of those faces, I guess.",
        "Cleo: Okay. Let me help you with that, Carly.",
        "Carly: Don't call me that, okay?",
        "Cleo: Oh. Do you have an alias now? Does it start with \"C\" for Carly? Because I read somewhere that if you change your name, you should have it start with the same letter as your first name, that way if somebody calls you by your new name, you have a second to remember, go hey wait a minute, I changed my name.",
        "Carly: My name's not Carly, all right? It never was.",
        "Cleo: Okay, okay.",
        "Carly: But, don't feel bad, okay? You know, really -- it happens all the time. Just looking for my keys here. You know actually, as a matter of fact, it just happened the other day. A complete stranger came up to me and asked if I was the woman from some commercial. He said he was positive that he'd seen me on TV.",
        "Cleo: I didn't see you on the TV, but I would recognize you anywhere. Some people just don't look hard enough. By the way, can I say -- your daughter looks a lot like you?",
        "Carly: I was just leaving. They didn't clean the bathroom in there.",
        "Cleo: That's gross. Um, are you gonna try to get another room? I can save you a lot of trouble, because I happen to know that this place is at full capacity, but you can wait in my room while we call the front desk. Normally, you can't get maid service at this hour, but I happen to know that Trina Mae, the woman who cleans the rooms, is married to the guy who works the desk at night, and she probably just got distracted.",
        "Carly: You know -- I don't want another room. And I don't need Trina Mae to clean this one. I'm leaving.",
        "Cleo: But you just got here, Carly.",
        "Carly: Please, don't call me that, all right?",
        "Cleo: Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want me to call you Mrs. Snyder? I forget some people are formal like that. I don't mind, though. Anyways, I'm really good friends with your sister, Gwen. So I know all about your problems.",
        "Carly: I have to go now, okay?",
        "Cleo: But you're safe with me, really. If you need anything, I'd love to help.",
        "Carly: You seem like a very sweet girl.",
        "Cleo: Thanks. Everybody says that.",
        "Carly: But really -- I've got to go.",
        "Cop: Looks like no one's home in this one, Detective.",
        "Dallas: Then use the passkey we got from the manager. There's a good chance our perp is hiding out in one of these rooms.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: How long is this flight?",
        "Jack: When we get back to Oakdale, I still have to go to work, remember?",
        "Katie: How long do you have to work?",
        "Jack: I've got a couple of guys who owe me favors. Maybe I can get one of them to cover for me.",
        "Katie: What about your kids?",
        "Jack: I'll call Emma. What's one more night?",
        "Katie: Yeah, but -- what if -- okay.",
        "Jack: You see, this way -- we can go straight from the airport to your place. If you want.",
        "Katie: I want. I can't.",
        "Jack: Why not?",
        "Katie: Because up until about an hour ago, I didn't even think I had a chance with you. I thought -- we were done.",
        "Jack: That's before we found out what Brad was doing --",
        "Katie: Yeah, Brad wasn't the only thing that was keeping us apart.",
        "Jack: Who?",
        "Katie: No, it was us, too. We both got freaked when that kiss was so amazing, and we couldn't run from each other fast enough.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Katie: Why did we waste so much time doing that?",
        "Jack: Speaking for myself? There hadn't been anybody since Carly. I wasn't expecting to feel what I felt.",
        "Katie: I thought you were embarrassed.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Katie: That I was just there, and it had been a while for you, so --",
        "Jack: Oh, I knew who I was kissing, Katie.",
        "Katie: Yeah, you know me, but you've never been in a relationship with me. I can be a nightmare. I always do the wrong thing. I always end up hurting people, especially this last time when I ruined several lives but my own, including yours. So you should know that very well. What was the question?",
        "Jack: I think, I think we were talking about why we ran from this.",
        "Katie: I ran from this because after everything that's happened, I was just grateful to have your friendship. And then if things were gonna change, I thought we'd destroy that.",
        "Jack: The thing for me, what freaked me out -- you know what it was? Happiness. You make me happy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Are you on drugs or not?",
        "Alison: I swear I'm not. Now, show me what you want me to read.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm not so sure we should go through with this.",
        "Alison: You have to go through with this, Paul, no matter what. We've already started, you've already got Craig primed. If I don't go through with this phone call, the whole deals lost and you know it.",
        "[Paul sighs]",
        "Paul: I swear, Alison, if you are lying to me --",
        "Alison: Oh, don't bother with threats because you're not going to fire me. Like it or not, you need me now, even more than I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: There you go.",
        "Craig: Where's yours?",
        "Meg: I'm not thirsty.",
        "Craig: Oh, plying me with alcohol. Meg, you make me feel so cheap. Thank you for doing that --",
        "Maid: Millicent.",
        "Craig: Millicent, yes, thank you. She's new.",
        "Meg: She thinks you're scary.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Meg: Well, it seems you've been particularly in a bad mood tonight.",
        "Craig: Now that you mention it, I guess I have.",
        "Meg: And why's that?",
        "Craig: I was out with an old friend. At least I thought she was a friend. Until she accused me of trying to kill my wife.",
        "Meg: And that upset you?",
        "Craig: Oh, it infuriated me.",
        "Meg: I was wrong.",
        "Craig: Wow, was that fast, Meg. And what made you change you mind? Did you get another call from Rosanna too?",
        "Meg: Rosanna called you again? Okay, look, I've been going over what I do know in my head about the night of the accident. I know you two had an argument. She left in her car, you followed her in yours. She called Paul, upset. Your car hit hers, she crashed. She went into a coma, she didn't wake up.",
        "Craig: Well, you might be jumping the gun a bit on that last part, on the off chance that that mysterious caller is Rosanna. She could come walking though that door any moment.",
        "Meg: At least it sounds like you would be happy to see her.",
        "Craig: I would.",
        "Meg: Even if she could send you to jail?",
        "Craig: Oh, she could try. And knowing Rosanna, she probably would -- try. And I think that that could be almost fun. Rosanna righteously indignant trying to take me down. Boy, she could make me enjoy that. But, would you?",
        "Meg: What do I have to do with it?",
        "Craig: If Rosanna did come back, Paul would be right there at her side and you would lose him forever.",
        "Meg: But you'd still want me.",
        "Craig: Maybe, I would. Maybe I wouldn't. That depends.",
        "Meg: On?",
        "Craig: Do you believe I tried to kill my wife?",
        "Meg: I don't know what you did.",
        "Craig: All right.",
        "Meg: I don't know who you are. I would love to find out, Craig. You know, there are moments where I see glimpses of a man -- a man that I can't help but like. Look, I made a mistake before. You wanted me to listen to you and I couldn't. I'm ready to listen to you now.",
        "Craig: Meg! Do you really like me?",
        "Meg: There are moments. This isn't one of them.",
        "Craig: Maybe I could change that, if you'd stay.",
        "Meg: So, are you going to tell me what really happened to Rosanna that night?",
        "Craig: No, I'm not. I don't understand.",
        "Meg: I can't do this.",
        "Craig: You're still in love with Paul?",
        "Meg: No -- no. I just can't do this because -- I need you.",
        "Craig: You're not making any sense to me.",
        "Meg: Tonight I found out that I have a chance to go back to nursing.",
        "Craig: Well, that's great. The hospital's going to give you your job back.",
        "Meg: No, no. It's one of your neighbors. I worked as a private duty nurse for them once before and they want me to work for them again.",
        "Craig: Well, Meg, what's wrong then?",
        "Meg: I want it so much, but I can't, Craig.",
        "Craig: Why not? All right, let's start with something easier. You said that you needed me. What --",
        "Meg: You're the only one who understands me. I didn't mean for Sarah Shaughnessy's to die, but she did. She was my patient, it was my fault.",
        "Craig: It was a mistake, Meg.",
        "Meg: Like with you and Rosanna? How do you make that go away? How do you make guilt like that go away?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Ali, there's a lot on the line here.",
        "Alison: You don't have to worry about anything. I am 100% solid.",
        "Paul: All right. I'll go get you that script. We'll get this phone call over. You go back to doing whatever it is you have to go do.",
        "Alison: Yeah, hurry up, Ryan. Time is money.",
        "[Sniffing]",
        "Paul: The phrasing in the beginning is really important. Alison?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: No touching, no hand holding, nothing.",
        "Jack: Not until we land, okay?",
        "Katie: And we get out of the airport.",
        "Jack: You know, I know a couple of air marshals. Maybe they can find us an office some place. I know, airports. No airports. Very tacky. I can't believe I came up with that. Need a lift home?",
        "Katie: Maybe I should take a cab. Jack; running again, are we?",
        "Katie: I just -- I want to dive into this, like I do everything else.",
        "Jack: Dive. I say dive into it. Diving is good.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but that's what always gets me in trouble -- acting without thinking. I don't want to be reckless. Do you want to be reckless?",
        "Jack: Reckless. Do you know how long it's been since I've been reckless? I say reckless -- fantastic.",
        "Katie: I want this so bad. I want you right now.",
        "Jack: But we can't. We can't. We have to wait until we get back.",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jack: Until we get back to your place.",
        "Katie: Even then, we can't.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Katie: Because I'm still married to Mike.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cleo: Are the cops looking for you because you stole those diamonds?",
        "Carly: Just help me find the room key. Okay, it's gotta be here some place. Just help me find it. What are standing there for? Will you help me find the key? What? What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? What are throwing me in here for like a sack of potatoes? Huh?",
        "Cleo: You asked for my help.",
        "Carly: Yeah, to get the key -- to find my key so I could get back in my room.",
        "Cleo: And if you were in you room, what would happen? The cops would come and knock on your door and you wouldn't answer. They'd come in and where would be, Carly? You'd be --",
        "Carly: For the last time, do not call me Carly. That's not me --",
        "Hotel manager: I saw her just go into that room.",
        "Carly: They're coming for me.",
        "Dallas: Actually, we're looking for a man in connection with an assault. Caucasian, 6', blond hair, last seen wearing a red shirt and black pants, get a tattoo of a woman on his forearm. Have you see anybody fitting with description?",
        "Hotel manager: Yeah, I have.",
        "Dallas: Well, the suspect was last seen in the vicinity of this motel, so we're going to have to check every room. May we come in?",
        "Hotel manager: Sure, knock yourself out.",
        "Carly: He's going to search in here. He can't find me. He can't see me.",
        "Cleo: Go in the bathroom. And calm down.",
        "Carly: How is going in the bathroom going to help me? He's going to search in here.",
        "Cleo: If you stay in here, you might get caught. If you go out there, you're definitely going to get caught. So, just stay in the bathroom and stay quiet.",
        "Carly: And you don't think Dallas is going to search the bathroom?",
        "Cleo: I can handle that Dallas guy, trust me.",
        "Carly: And how are you going to do that?",
        "Dallas: Thanks for your cooperation. Here's my card. If you see anyone matching the description I gave you, please give me a call. Thanks.",
        "Carly: Why are you putting on a wig? We don't have time to play dress up here. Oh my God. You're my sister. You look so much like Gwen.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Gwen: Hi. Dallas, what are you doing here?",
        "Dallas: Gwen, you're pretty much the last person I expected to open that door.",
        "Gwen: What's going on?",
        "Dallas: A man assaulted him neighbor over on University Avenue, then took off running and we tracked him here. You haven't see a medium height white guy with a tattoo on his forearm, have you?",
        "Gwen: No, can't say that I have. He wasn't carrying a gun, was he?",
        "Dallas: He's unarmed, but he's pretty desperate not to get caught, so you need to be careful.",
        "Gwen: Will do. Thanks for the warning. I'll see ya around.",
        "Dallas: Gwen, I need to look in your room.",
        "Gwen: Why, he's not in here.",
        "Dallas: Well, I need to make sure of that. You don't mind if I come in, do you? How's Will?",
        "Gwen: He's good.",
        "Dallas: Why are you guys staying here?",
        "Gwen: We're not. I'm visiting a friend.",
        "Dallas: And your friend's in the bathroom?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, she's not feeling well.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Dallas: Ma'am, open the door, please.",
        "Gwen: Come on, is that really necessary? The guy's not in there.",
        "Dallas: This is why I'm having a hard time believing that. You're in a hotel room without your husband. You're acting nervous and protective. I've tracked a phone to this location, and there's something or someone behind that door that you don't want me to see. I don't know what that is. But either you get your friend to open the door right now, or I break it down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're not divorced yet?",
        "Katie: I guess I thought Mike would probably file the papers, since he was the one who left.",
        "Jack: But you are, you are, you are getting a divorce?",
        "Katie: Yes, it's just -- well, until now when you just kissed me, there didn't seem to be any rush.",
        "Jack: Because you were hoping he'll come back?",
        "Katie: I was.",
        "Jack: Well, good luck with that.",
        "Katie: I was hoping, but not anymore.",
        "Jack: Katie, I don't want to be the rebound guy. I don't think I've even been the rebound guy. And Mike is a friend of mine.",
        "Katie: Of course, I wanted him to come back. He was my husband. I loved him. I wanted a chance to make up for what I did to him.",
        "Jack: All right, but some how, now, that doesn't matter.",
        "Katie: Things have changed.",
        "Jack: Because we kissed?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I assumed that Mike and I would get back together or I would be alone. This didn't really seem to be an option, but you kissed me and I started thinking about the \"What ifs.\"",
        "Jack: I got a \"What if\" for you. What if Mike comes back?",
        "Katie: He won't. It took me a long time to accept that, but it's the truth.",
        "Jack: You still love him?",
        "Katie: You still love Carly?",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Katie: No hesitation.",
        "Jack: Come on, we got three kids together. Carly is in every single one of those kids. I mean, Sage will say something and I got to turn around and wonder if Carly walked in the room. And J.J., he loves to draw. And you know what? He's pretty darn good at it. Because Carly taught him. Parker, Parker. Wow, he wants to forget that his mother ever existed. But, I take one look at him and I see her stubbornness and her kindness and her aggressiveness --",
        "Katie: Why did I even ask this? That was such a stupid --",
        "Jack: I love those kids. I love those kids. How could I hate Carly? That doesn't make any sense. We made a family together. After that, I will always love her. But --",
        "Katie: I'm glad there's a but.",
        "Jack: Katie, it scares me.",
        "Katie: What you feel for her?",
        "Jack: What I did to her. I love those kids so much and if any one of then lied to me like Carly lied to me, I would never ever turn my back on them. I turned my back on Carly. What kind of thing is that to do someone you supposedly love?",
        "Katie: Your kids are innocent, Carly wasn't innocent.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? I took vows -- we took vows together. I made promises to her. And she believed that I would keep those promises. Why -- because I gave her my word. It doesn't get much more innocent than that. I'm the one who broke a promise.",
        "Katie: Yeah. I broke a promise too -- to Mike, when I slept with Simon. And until I'm not Mike's wife anymore, I just -- it feels wrong to be with someone else in that way.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: So, I guess we're on hold?",
        "Katie: I think we need to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Alison: Yeah, I was just --",
        "Paul: You got this really weird look on your face.",
        "Alison: I was just meditating. It -- I learned it in L.A. it helps you get into a role and mellow you out. You should try it sometime.",
        "Paul: You are the least mellow person that I know.",
        "Alison: Let me see what you got? It's really long. Do I really have to say all of this?",
        "Paul: Its six sentences.",
        "Alison: Seven.",
        "Paul: Okay. You need to get out.",
        "Alison: Wait a second, just let me look at --",
        "Paul: Rosanna didn't hesitate, ever. Okay? If you're even the tiniest bit nervous, Craig will know that you're not her.",
        "Alison: Okay, you're right. I'm sorry. I just freaked myself out. I'm sorry for being a diva.",
        "Paul: Just go, please.",
        "Alison: And let Craig get away with everything he's done? No, I can't. Look, just let me look at it and, I swear, I will out-act Meryl Streep. Okay? Just -- why don't we just do a read through and you can coach me on it? You won't be sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Nursing is what you were meant to do. Do it.",
        "Meg: What about what my dead patient was meant to do?",
        "Craig: A lot of people die before their time, Meg. My son, Bryant, for one. But do I honor him if I give up living just because he's gone?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Craig: Then why do you have to sacrifice your entire life for the death of one woman?",
        "Meg: Because I was responsible for that death. Because she would still be here with her husband and her family if I was paying attention to her instead of being wrapped up in my own selfish thoughts. When you hurt someone, you should do penance for that, shouldn't you?",
        "Craig: Who are we talking about here? Are we talking about you or me?",
        "Meg: Well, since you have nothing to feel guilty about, I assumed we were talking about me. Was I wrong?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Meg: I can leave -- you probably want to deal with this alone.",
        "Craig: Yes, but I certainly won't want to be alone when it's over, so stay. Please.",
        "Meg: All right --",
        "Craig: Hello?",
        "Alison: Hello, Craig.",
        "Craig: What do you want?",
        "Alison: The free ride you've enjoyed since you ran me off the road is about to end. Are you ready to pay, Craig?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So where do you want me to put these?",
        "Katie: Oh, just right there is fine.",
        "Jack: How are you going to get home?",
        "Katie: I'll just grab a ride with someone else when we're done taping. I can't believe I have to tape a segment with Brad right now.",
        "Jack: Where is everybody?",
        "Katie: Oh, we don't have a call for another hour.",
        "Jack: Katie, I could have taken you home. Yeah, maybe this was better.",
        "Katie: Maybe.",
        "Jack: So do you want me to stick around so you don't have to face Brad alone?",
        "Katie: I thought you had to work?",
        "Jack: I told you -- I told I could get someone to cover for me.",
        "Katie: No, I'll be okay. I can handle Brad.",
        "Jack: Ahh -- well maybe I should stick around and protect Brad from you?",
        "Katie: No bloodshed I promise. I better work.",
        "Jack: Hey you know, I was thinking.",
        "Katie: You were?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I do that sometimes. Maybe the two of us could do something that we haven't done together, yet.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I was thinking about that too. But I thought we talked about it on the plane and, after everything we talked about, I'm not ready.",
        "Jack: No, I'm not talking about -- I'm not talking about sex, okay. Oh -- wow -- this is really difficult. I haven't done this in a long time. I feel like I'm in high school.",
        "Katie: What is it?",
        "Jack: Do you want to date? Go on a date? With me?",

        "Dallas: Leave the door open, Gwen. Who's in the room?",
        "Cleo: It's my mom. She's started this new job and it got her stressed out she started drinking again.",
        "Dallas: Isn't she on parole?",
        "Cleo: Yeah, so if anybody see's her drinking, she'll be in violation and they'll send her back to jail. So -- I thought I could just stay with her here, until she was sober again.",
        "Dallas: Well if I don't actually see her drunk then I'm not obligated to say anything.",
        "Cleo: So maybe we can, forget about this whole thing. And my mom can go back to her job and her meetings.",
        "Dallas: I've got one problem with that.",
        "Cleo: What's that?",
        "Dallas: It says here that this room is registered to Cleo Babbitt. Who is she?",
        "Cleo: My mom has a flair for the dramatic. It's her alias.",
        "Dallas: You're a good daughter, Gwen.",
        "Cleo: I try, she doesn't make it very easy sometimes --well, I better get back in there.",
        "Dallas: One more thing. Has anyone checked into this room across the hall?",
        "Cleo: Yes.",
        "Dallas: Was it a man? Maybe my perp?",
        "Cleo: No, it was a woman.",
        "Cop: Any luck?",
        "Dallas: No, not yet. Thanks for your help, Gwen. And I'm sorry you're having to deal with your mother's problems right now. Is everything else okay otherwise?",
        "Cleo: Yeah, I've never been better!",
        "Dallas: That's good. When I think back to last summer --",
        "Cleo: Yeah, I'm glad we got to hang out and get to know each other so well.",
        "Dallas: Actually, I was thinking about the Slasher. And all those kids that died. How upset that made you.",
        "Cleo: Yes, that was really horrible. I'm glad we got to be friends though. I have to get back to my mom.",
        "Carly: Is he gone?",
        "Cleo: You're safe! Wasn't that cool?",
        "Carly: Yeah, that's one word for it. Thank you.",
        "Cleo: You're welcome! It was a piece of cake. I love being Gwen!",
        "Carly: Cleo, is it?",
        "Cleo: Yeah, it's Cleo Babbitt.",
        "Carly: Well, Cleo Babbitt, no offense, but before I get too chummy with you, you need to tell me who the hell you are and why you're walking around impersonating my sister.",
        "Cleo: It's like I told you. Gwen and I are friends in a funny kind of way.",
        "Carly: Well, I do know most of Gwen's friends.",
        "Cleo: Oh well, actually, we just kind of met. I saw her sing in Los Angeles and I knew there had to be a connection because we look so much alike.",
        "Carly: If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't have believed it. But really, you are her exact double.",
        "Cleo: Yeah, I guess you could say that resemblance is what brought us together.",
        "Carly: So, what -- so, you live here now? And you and Gwen hang out?",
        "Cleo: Well no, we're not really the best of friends, but, I mean, I think the world of Will and Gwen. I think they're really neat people.",
        "Carly: Yeah they are, they are neat. So tell me why you have all of this stuff that makes you look exactly like her, huh?",
        "Cleo: Oh, well, because at first I was the only one who saw the similarity. Nobody else thought that we looked alike, so I got all this stuff to kind of prove it to them. Like a goof, you know?",
        "Carly: Mmm -- and Gwen's okay with that?",
        "Cleo: I'm just glad that I still had this stuff here, so I could help you when you needed me.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I appreciate that. But why would you do that? Why would you lie to the police for me? You just met me.",
        "Cleo: Well, why wouldn't I? You're Gwen's sister. I really care about Will and Gwen. I'd do anything to make them happy. So -- do you need me to do anything else for you?",
        "Carly: No, no that's okay. Thanks.",
        "Carly: Are you hungry? Do you want me to hand deliver a message for you?",
        "Carly: No, just forget you ever saw me, okay?",
        "Cleo: But I'd really love to help.",
        "Carly: Why don't you just leave me alone! All right?",
        "Cleo: Okay.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I snapped at you, but it's just been a tough couple of months here.",
        "Cleo: Are you talking about that Australian guy? He's so handsome! But to be honest with you, I don't think he's as handsome as that guy you used to be married to, Jack, but then again I'm kind of into the straight arrow type. Not so much the jewelry thief. So I actually don't know who you are. I forgot. I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: Hey, I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been here to save me today. Thanks, Cleo.",
        "Cleo: You're welcome, Sis. I'm just kidding. Bye. There's no way I'm leaving town now. Yes!",

        "Katie: Going back to high school if we are going to do that, the first date you have kids.",
        "Jack: Right, I know, I know. What happens on a third date? It hasn't been that long.",
        "Katie: So we've held hands. We've kissed, we've -- you know, I mean.",
        "Jack: Okay, so what we do is we talk, we go to the movies, we go out to dinner. And then one day, when you're divorced, and when my kids have gotten used to us being together, we go on the third date. Unless, of course, you want to use me for sex, which is perfectly fine with me if that's the case.",
        "Katie: I don't know.",
        "Jack: Right. Okay, yeah, I'll see you later.",
        "Katie: Jack? Does later tonight work for you?",

        "Craig: Whoever you are, you are very imaginative. But you are not going to scare me.",

        "Craig: I didn't.",
        "Alison: You did. And I have proof that you switched the babies. Proof that came straight from the hospital. You should be afraid, Craig. You won't get away with this one. This time, I mean. [Alison laughs] You won't get away with --",
