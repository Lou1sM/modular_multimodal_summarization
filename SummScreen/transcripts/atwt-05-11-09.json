Henry and Vienna mourn the loss of their friendship with Brad and Katie, but they can't help but be happy about the prospect of having a baby. When Brad and Vienna run into each other, she learns again how devastated Katie is so Vienna goes to visit her. Katie doesn't want to talk, but when Vienna feels the baby move, Katie can't help but want to be involved. Katie suddenly decides the only way to make it ok again would be to still take the baby. Vienna is surprised but wants to make up for what happened and wants to make her friend happy so she agrees to talk with Henry. Brad learns of Katie's abrupt change of heart and isn't on board, but Katie finally convinces him that keeping the baby they originally thought was theirs will all turn out ok. Vienna tries to talk with Henry about it, but he is not agreeing to it. He feels horribly for Katie but he won't give up his child and his speech to Vienna is so moving, Vienna can't do it either in the end. Katie and Brad show up to tell them they assume the promise is still on for them to have their baby. Unfortunately, Henry and Vienna can't agree to it anymore, as Katie is again devastated, and Brad is angry. Later, Brad promises Katie that she will get past this, as Katie doubts it. Lucinda tries to show her support of Lucy while she tries to convince Lucy not to rely on Damian. Holden, Lily and Noah all want Luke to stay away from Damian, but Luke wants to get to the bottom of this and goes in search of him. Damian comes up with a plan to find out who the smuggler is and agrees to meet with him. Luke tries to talk with Damian, but he wants Luke to leave so he doesn't get in the middle of this. Luke won't leave easily so Damian is agitated and tells Luke to go away, but Luke doesn't go far. Fredo and Damian come face to face, as Damian promises he will stop him, as he holds a gun on him. Fredo and Damian fight and Fredo gets the best of him, but Luke rushes to the rescue. Luke and Damian almost get in trouble, as Noah shows up, and trains a gun on Fredo, and in the end, is forced to shoot him. Margo finds this chaotic scene at the pier and brings them all downtown. Lucy is set free when Fredo confesses, as everyone is thrilled, but Holden is convinced that Damian put Luke's life at risk again. Luke defends Damian, which upsets Holden. Later, Luke and Damian genuinely reconcile while Holden and Lily do as well, but Holden is convinced there will be more drama as long as Damian stays in town."

        "Kim: Unfortunately, you've had some twists and turns, I know.",
        "Katie: But we haven't given up.",
        "Brad: And we're lucky to be getting help from a friend.",
        "Katie: Our dear friend Vienna Hyatt, our surrogate mother.",
        "Vienna: Hello, everybody.",
        "Kim: Well, now, having a surrogate mother is quite common, but I think it's rare to have it happening this way.",
        "Brad: Hey.",
        "Kim: Do you want to explain how --",
        "Brad: How long have you been up?",
        "Katie: All night, I think.",
        "Brad: All night? Baby, I'm really worried about you.",
        "Katie: Can you not call me that, please?",
        "Brad: I know that you're upset that Henry and Vienna lied to us.",
        "Katie: They didn't just lie to us. They took our -- how could they not tell us that that wasn't our baby? They just sat back and watched. They watched us fall in love with this child that wasn't --",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Brad: I know.",
        "[Voice breaking]",
        "Katie: They let us make so many plans.",
        "Brad: I know, I know, I know. I know. I think that you would feel a lot better if you let yourself get some rest.",
        "Katie: I know. Every time I try, I just --",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Brad: What if I got you something to help you sleep. Would you take it? Okay, I'm gonna get dressed, go to the drugstore. All right? Love you.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Katie: Well, I'm sure our audience remembers how devastated I was when I found out that I couldn't have children.",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, we thought about hiring a surrogate, but that would be someone that we didn't know, and then Vienna just sort of volunteered.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Do you think Brad and Katie will ever forgive us?",
        "Henry: I hope to God they do, in time.",
        "Vienna: But what if they don't?",
        "Henry: They're our best friends, Vienna. They're not gonna stay mad at us forever.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but we broke their trust. We took away something so precious.",
        "Henry: We didn't intend to do that, okay? T -- that wasn't planned. They have to realize that eventually.",
        "Vienna: Yes, but every time they'll see that baby, they're gonna -- they're gonna remember that it was supposed to be theirs.",
        "[Both sigh]",
        "Henry: Can't think like that, because it's not theirs. It never was theirs. It's ours.",
        "Vienna: So you really want to -- you really want to keep him, becoming parents?",
        "Henry: Well, I'll admit to you the idea still scares the hell out of me, but, uh -- but I -- I think I'm ready. And there's no one I'd rather be a parent with than you. How about you? Are you ready?",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Vienna: This is all I ever wanted. I can only think of one thing that would make this more perfect.",
        "Henry: Which is?",
        "Vienna: Some new maternity clothes to model for you.",
        "Henry: Ooh. I'm getting a flashback to a very fashionable dressing room. If you find the credit card in my pocket, the store is all yours.",
        "[Both laughing]",
        "Henry: It's almost there. Oh! Wow.",
        "Vienna: Ah.",
        "Vienna: Brad, wait. Please, please. How's Katie?",
        "Brad: How's Katie? I mean, how do you think she's doing? You know, she's devastated. She feels like she did after she had the miscarriage. I mean, she won't eat. She can't sleep.",
        "Vienna: I'm so sorry. We never wanted to hurt either one of you.",
        "Brad: You should have told us the truth.",
        "Vienna: I didn't know how.",
        "Brad: You just say it, you know? \"The baby's not yours, Brad. It's Henry's. The insemination -- it didn't work.\"",
        "Vienna: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.",
        "[Vienna sighs]",
        "Vienna: We handled this all wrong.",
        "Brad: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, Katie -- that's all she ever wanted was a baby, and she finally thought her wish was gonna come true, and I just -- I don't know if she's gonna be able to get over this.",

        "Lucy: I never meant for my father to get into any trouble.",
        "Margo: Really?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. You don't believe me?",
        "Margo: Well, you deliberately used his company as a front, knowing that if anything went wrong, he'd take the hit, which he did. And coming here today doesn't change that, does it?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Lucinda: Darling, Margo.",
        "Margo: Lucinda, would you like a seat?",
        "Lucinda: What I would like is to take this poor girl home.",
        "Margo: Well, I'll leave you two alone, then, for a minute.",
        "[Lucy sighs]",
        "Lucinda: Come here. Let me look at you. Are you all right?",
        "Lucy: Yeah, I'm fine.",
        "Lucinda: I don't want you to worry. I talked to the lawyer again this morning. We're gonna get you out of here.",
        "Lucy: I don't know what he's gonna be able to do.",
        "Lucinda: Don't want you to give up hope!",
        "Lucy: I won't. And I don't regret what I did to help those people. It was worth it.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah. I'm sure you saved countless lives, Darling. But I'm curious about what your plan is to save your own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How did you guys sleep?",
        "Noah: I slept fine. Luke, on the other hand --",
        "Lily: Honey?",
        "Luke: I just couldn't stop thinking about Lucy smuggling medicine with Damian's help.",
        "[Luke laughs]",
        "Luke: Is she all right? Did you talk to her?",
        "Lily: She was in police custody overnight.",
        "Holden: Don't worry about it. Your grandmother's called in some heavy hitters to handle her case.",
        "Luke: Well, I don't think she's gonna need them.",
        "Lily: Why not?",
        "Noah: Tell them.",
        "Luke: Damian says he has a plan to help Lucy.",
        "Holden: Oh, great. Well, then Lucy better watch her back. Damian's the last person who should be riding to the rescue.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Put the word out. I'm looking to use my ships to make a little extra cash.",
        "Thug: Doing what?",
        "Damian: What do you think?",
        "Thug: You can't be serious.",
        "Damian: Look like I'm kidding to you?",
        "Thug: Since when are the Grimaldis into smuggling weapons?",
        "Damian: Since I said so.",
        "Thug: Look, I had no problem moving medical supplies, but this --",
        "Damian: I don't care. Just make it happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Katie remembering]",
        "Vienna: Well, Henry and I -- we've decided not to have children.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "[Katie remembering]",
        "Vienna: But it's always been a dream of mine to experience what it would be like to feel a --",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Vienna: -- A new life growing inside of me and giving birth. And -- and now I can do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Hi.",
        "Katie: I told you I didn't want to see you. What do you want me to say?",
        "Vienna: I saw Brad in Old Town, and I asked him how you were. I want you to know how badly I feel about this.",
        "Katie: I know you do. Why are you here?",
        "Vienna: Because we care about you. You're my sister. You're my Katya.",
        "Katie: I remember when you used to call me that, but a lot's happened since then.",
        "Vienna: I know, I know, and I don't expect things to change overnight.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I can't see you.",
        "[Vienna scoffs]",
        "Katie: Vienna?",
        "Vienna: It's just the baby.",
        "Katie: Are you okay?",
        "Vienna: I -- I just felt him move.",
        "Katie: He's moving now?",
        "Vienna: Yeah. Oh, my God. It still catches me off guard.",
        "Katie: Do you want to sit down?",
        "Vienna: Would you mind?",
        "Katie: No, no. Come in.",
        "[Vienna laughs]",
        "Katie: Does he move a lot?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, usually in the mornings.",
        "[Vienna laughs]",
        "Katie: Must be quite a sensation. What does it -- never mind?",
        "Vienna: Do you want to feel it?",
        "Katie: No, no. That's okay.",
        "Vienna: It's all right. Go on. Go ahead.",
        "Katie: I don't even know where he --",
        "Vienna: Here. Do you feel it?",
        "Katie: I do.",
        "[Vienna chuckles]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Luke, this is how he operates. He lets other people do his dirty work, like your cousin, and he keeps his hands clean.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but he used his own fleet to smuggle the medicine out of the country.",
        "Holden: So?",
        "Holden: Then he'll stay out of it and let Lucinda's lawyers handle it!",
        "Luke: Mom --",
        "Lily: I know you think I'd agree with you on this, but I don't. Damian's help always seems to create these situations that --",
        "Luke: That -- that what?",
        "Noah: That end with people getting hit by cars or stabbed or kidnapped or shot.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but, Noah, don't forget that he saved our lives!",
        "Noah: I know. But as your dad pointed out, he's the reason we were in danger in the first place. So maybe for now, before things get straightened out, staying away from Damian is not that bad an idea.",
        "Luke: I can't believe this.",
        "Noah: We're talking about smuggling guns here, Luke -- m-16s. Doesn't that sound a little dangerous to you?",
        "Holden: Look, we're not trying to deny you to find whatever it is you're looking for from Damian.",
        "Luke: I'm not looking for anything.",
        "Holden: Well, then, fine. Then you'll wait until Lucy's in the clear and we find out what's going on here.",
        "Luke: You want me to stay away him?",
        "Lily: We're just looking out for you, Sweetie.",
        "Noah: I need to get to work.",
        "Luke: I will go with you.",
        "Noah: Really?",
        "Luke: Its okay, isn't it?",
        "Noah: Yeah, sure.",
        "Holden: Luke --",
        "Luke: Hmm?",
        "Holden: -- Remember what we said.",
        "Luke: I will. What?",
        "Noah: You have no intention of staying away from Damian, do you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Damian: Grimaldi.",
        "Fredo: You're the guy that wants to move some things under the radar?",
        "Damian: I am. Can you help me out? Do you know where my shipping office is on Pier 13?",
        "Fredo: Oh, I -- I don't do offices.",
        "Damian: How about the docks? 20 minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Just offered you the use of the Grimaldi shipping fleet, just like that?",
        "Lucy: Basically.",
        "Margo: Why? Why would a man like Damian Grimaldi -- why would he get involved in anything humanitarian? Doesn't make sense.",
        "Lucy: He said he had made some really big mistakes in the past.",
        "Lucinda: Uh-huh.",
        "Lucy: I knew he was talking about Luke. He was doing this as a way to redeem himself.",
        "Lucinda: Be still my bleeding heart.",
        "Lucy: People he helped -- it really made a difference.",
        "Lucinda: And why isn't he helping you now? Why has he abandoned you?",
        "Lucy: Damian is the reason that I was able to come forward and clear my father's name.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah, I see that. I do see that. And Craig is free and Damian is free and you, my precious granddaughter -- you are here.",
        "Lucy: I don't blame Damian for that.",
        "Lucinda: Perhaps it's time you began to.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: You know, I've got a little while before I have to be on. Do you want to grab a bite, sit outside?",
        "Luke: Actually, I think I'm gonna take off.",
        "Noah: That quick, huh?",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: What?",
        "Noah: You're not gonna even pretend that you're not gonna go see Damian?",
        "Luke: I just want to talk to him.",
        "Noah: Talk to him?",
        "Luke: Yes.",
        "Noah: Fine. You want to go, go. I won't try to talk you out of it.",
        "Luke: Thank you.",
        "Noah: It's not like you'd listen to me anyway.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: Noah, it's not like I don't see what you all are saying. I'm getting a completely different side of the story from Damian.",
        "Noah: Does that surprise you?",
        "Luke: Well, the fact that I've spent so long not wanting to hear anything that he has to say makes me think that maybe I should just hear him out. It might help. I could get some answers.",
        "Noah: And if you don't?",
        "Luke: At least I tried.",
        "Noah: I don't know. Luke, I just -- I don't like it.",
        "Luke: I know you don't like it. But it's really, really, really, really important to me.",
        "Noah: Fine. But will you please be careful?",
        "Luke: Yes, I promise. I love you.",
        "Noah: Same here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: That was amazing.",
        "Vienna: I think he's tired himself out.",
        "Katie: I bet.",
        "[Vienna laughs]",
        "Katie: How are you feeling?",
        "Vienna: Better. Do you know why? Because just now, you almost had a smile.",
        "Katie: Did I?",
        "Vienna: Yes. When you felt the baby, you had a look on your face that I was afraid I would never see again.",
        "Katie: Maybe 'cause it felt like nothing had changed for a second there. I felt that connection still like he was still mine.",
        "Vienna: He was always supposed to be yours. I'm so sorry, Katie. If there's anything I could do to -- to change it, I would.",
        "Katie: You don't have to say that.",
        "Vienna: I do, I do, because this baby was always supposed to be yours and Brad's, not mine.",
        "Katie: So why -- when you found out what happened --",
        "Vienna: We were in shock. I'm sorry. We were in shock.",
        "[Vienna sighs]",
        "Vienna: We didn't know what to say, so we chose to say nothing. We didn't want anything to change.",
        "Katie: You didn't?",
        "Vienna: No, no. This was your baby. That -- that was always the plan.",
        "Katie: Could it still be?",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Katie: Could it still be the plan? Up until a couple days ago, you wanted us to have the baby, and you knew Henry was the father. The only difference was that Brad and I didn't know yet.",
        "Vienna: But -- but you told me that you didn't want this baby now.",
        "Katie: I know, but we had just found out the truth. We didn't know what to think. We just -- we were processing it. We didn't know what it meant. But this baby means everything to Brad and me. We don't want to lose him.",
        "Vienna: No, no. I know, I know, I know. Okay. I have to -- I have to think about this.",
        "Katie: Of course.",
        "Vienna: I'm going to have to talk to Henry about this before we decide anything.",
        "Katie: Henry will understand. I know it. I know he will.",
        "Vienna: I should go.",
        "Katie: But you'll call me as soon as you talk to Henry.",
        "Vienna: I will. Brad.",
        "Brad: Vienna. Do you want to tell me what's going on?",
        "Katie: I fixed it.",
        "Brad: Fixed what.",
        "Katie: Everything. I think we're gonna have our baby after all.",
        "Brad: That baby?",
        "Katie: Yes, our baby!",
        "Brad: Absolutely not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey! There's my gorgeously round strudel.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Henry: Where are your shopping bags?",
        "Vienna: I didn't go shopping.",
        "Henry: Oh, no. Where'd you go?",
        "Vienna: I went to see Katie.",
        "Henry: Why? Why did you do that?",
        "Vienna: I had to. I -- I was on my way to Fashions, and I ran into Brad. And I asked him how she was doing, and he told me that she was completely devastated.",
        "[Vienna sighs]",
        "Henry: Yeah. Here. Come here. Ay, ay, ay.",
        "[Vienna sighs]",
        "Vienna: You should have seen her. It was awful when she opened the door.",
        "Henry: Yeesh. I'm actually glad I didn't see her. You're a lot braver than I am.",
        "Vienna: She's in so much pain.",
        "Henry: She told you that?",
        "Vienna: No, she didn't. She was trying to be so brave. And then -- when the baby moved and --",
        "Henry: What, what, what, what? Whoa, whoa. Back up here. The baby moved?",
        "Vienna: Yeah. The baby moved, and I -- I could see that she was dying. She was dying to see what it felt like. So I took her hand, and I placed it on my stomach.",
        "Henry: Vienna, no. No, you didn't. No. No, no, no, no.",
        "Vienna: No, I -- I wanted to. I wanted her to feel better.",
        "[Henry sighs]",
        "Henry: Did it? Did it make her feel better?",
        "Vienna: No. I don't know.",
        "Henry: I think that we just need to give her a little bit of space.",
        "Vienna: No, no. I don't think that's what she wants.",
        "Henry: Sweetie, I don't want to see her suffer any more than you do. And I -- I would do anything -- anything to stop that. I would.",
        "Vienna: Do you really mean that?",
        "Henry: You know I do.",
        "Vienna: So you would reconsider giving them the baby?",
        "Henry: Giving them the baby?",
        "Vienna: Yes.",
        "Henry: Our baby?",
        "Vienna: Yes.",
        "Henry: No. Absolutely not.",

        "Luke: I'm looking for you.",

        "Damian: I'm waiting for someone.",
        "Luke: Well, then, I'll wait with you.",
        "Damian: No! You'll just be in the way.",
        "Luke: In the way?",
        "Damian: Yes. Yes, please, just -- how can I make you understand? I don't want you here, all right?! You have to go! Just leave me alone! Go!",
        "Luke: Okay. No, wait. Damian, what is going on?",
        "Damian: Excuse me?",
        "Luke: I just came here to talk to you.",

        "Damian: Well, then, maybe you should listen to them.",

        "Luke: No. I just can't believe that you and Damian were working together.",
        "Lucy: Well, there's something you should know about that. The reason Damian agreed to help me was because of you, Luke. He wanted to show you --",
        "Luke: That -- that he changed. Yeah. I've heard that.",
