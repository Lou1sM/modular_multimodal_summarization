        "Aaron promises Allison he'll help her buy a ceramic plate that she can pass off as her own, but she has to promise she'll learn how to work the pottery wheel. Jessica confronts Margo about Doc, Margo swearing she's not doing anything wrong. Doc sends her flowers thanking her for the nice evening. As Margo tries to go to sleep, she has a vision where she's talking with Doc, fully clothed, next to her on the bed. She tells him to leave and he does, Margo confident that she can forget about him; until she sees his picture in the paper. Doc is served legal papers during the break to his sportscast, attacking the guy who served him on live TV. Kim is livid and threatens his job, Jessica again coming to the Doc's rescue as his lawyer.",
        "Roseanna takes Carly with her to the \"Palace of Happiness\" to meet Craig. He shows up, and finds out that she married Jordan, threatening to never let her see Cabot again unless she annuls her marriage to Jordan. Jack then arrives and Roseanna begs him to make Craig tell her where Cabot is. Lucy shows up in Las Vegas and tells Paul that her father called her and told her to come, that they'd be a family again. Paul calls the number left on her cell phone from Craig's call and goes to the motel where Craig is staying. Pounding on the door, Dalma, the babysitter, finally lets Paul in and then promptly knocks him out by busting a lamp over his head. Jordan is surprised when Lucy shows up at his suite and tells him why she's there. They both go to the \"Palace of Happiness\" to see if Roseanna may annul his marriage to her and marry Craig instead. Once there, Lucy looks at her cell phone and tells everyone she thinks she knows where Cabot is. Meanwhile, the lamp Dalma broke over Paul's head catches fire and she flees, leaving him unconscious surrounded by flames."

        "Kim: \"A beginner's guide to pottery,\" \"Ceramics for Dummies\"?",
        "Alison: I'm just studying for class.",
        "Kim: I mean, why are you wasting your time with this? You already know all this stuff.",
        "Alison: That's very sweet, but --",
        "Kim: No, no, it's true.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm just a beginner, just like the rest of the class.",
        "Kim: You have a real talent for this, and I can't wait to see this blossom.",
        "Alison: It's really not that big of a deal.",
        "Kim: Well, I think so. You shouldn't underestimate your talent. Actually, between you and me, I have always wanted to know how to work with clay. I mean, people say that it's kind of therapeutic.",
        "Alison: Yeah, that's what they say.",
        "Kim: So anyway, Bob, of course, is gonna clean the garden shed out this weekend to make room for the wheel, and I've been thinking what I will do is clear some time out of my schedule, and maybe you can teach me, too. Should we give it a whirl? Shall we?",

        "Margo: Jessica, you gotta relax. I am not infatuated with anyone, let alone Doc Reese.",
        "Jessica: You already told me you were flattered by the attention.",
        "Margo: Well, that's a far cry from a full-blown infatuation.",
        "Jessica: So why are you blushing?",
        "Margo: I'm not blushing.",
        "Jessica: Really?",
        "Margo: All right, all right. You've done your job. You have warned me about the dangers of smiling at a man that's not my husband.",
        "Jessica: And you are ignoring me.",
        "Margo: Well, yes, with good cause. There's nothing to worry about. I'm a very happily married woman with a grown son out of the house and another kid warming up in the bullpen. And there's neither need nor time for any sort of fantasy life.",
        "Jessica: There's always time.",
        "Margo: What's -- what's wrong with flirting? Hmm?",
        "Jessica: Nothing. Unless you're flirting with disaster.",

        "Process server: Oh, I'm over here.",
        "Stage manager: Quiet on the floor, please! And we are back in five, four, three --",
        "Doc: Good evening, Oakdale, and good news to Chicago Bulls fans out there. Some key players will come off the disabled list just in time to make a big difference. Dare we dream of a seventh NBA championship? The doctor is in, after a brief word from our sponsors.",

        "Rosanna: Craig? Craig?",
        "Jordan: Who is that, your ex?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah.",
        "Jordan: What does he want?",
        "Rosanna: He's not picking up! Craig, where are you? It's Rosanna. What are you doing? Where is my baby, you bastard?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Hey. Hey, big man. I believe things are finally turning around. Hmm? 'Cause Daddy's taking care of business. Just like always.",
        "Dalma: What should Dalma do?",
        "Craig: Your sister said you served in the rebel army in your country, huh? Good. Good, because I'm entrusting you with my son here. I want you to defend him with your life.",
        "Dalma: Dalma is entrusting you with INS. You help me, I help you. And you pay.",
        "Craig: Yeah, don't I just. The money's in this envelope here, okay? Half now, half when I return. But you don't leave this room. Nobody comes in. You don't let anybody in that door except me. All right? Okay. And if anyone tries to take this boy, I want you to use that combat training. Use whatever means necessary. Understand that?",
        "Dalma: Dalma understand everything.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I can tell. All right. Cabot, Daddy's going to be home soon. All right? Daddy's gonna be back with Mommy. Remember Mommy? Crazy little blonde? Yeah. Yeah. Mommy's gonna be back. We'll all be a family again. Huh? Back to the way things were meant to be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: I know we've only been married for a couple of hours, but you're gonna have to talk to me sooner or later.",
        "Rosanna: Well, it's gonna have to be later. Okay? I promise.",

        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Jordan: Does he have your son? Is he threatening you?",
        "Rosanna: No! Look, everything is fine. Okay? Or, it will be, as soon as I meet with Craig. But it is imperative that I leave now.",
        "Jordan: Rosanna, I married you because you said it was the only way to keep Cabot safe from some unknown danger, and all of a sudden, the danger is just gone?",
        "Rosanna: Or it's been replaced by another. I can't really tell you anything that I don't know.",
        "Jordan: You're just as frightened as you were before.",
        "Rosanna: I will be fine. I will explain everything when I come back here with Cabot, but you have to let me leave now. Please. Thank you. You've been really understanding. Okay? And I swear this will all be worth it when I come back here with Cabot. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Jack, you're out of your jurisdiction here. Now, what is going on with Rosanna? Is she looking for Cabot?",
        "Jack: This isn't your problem, Paul. If she wanted your help, she would've asked.",
        "Paul: Well, did she ask you? Did she ask anyone?",
        "Press #1: Mr. Ryan that was an awesome show tonight. We need a statement.",
        "Jack: Yeah, don't you have a fashion show to worry about? You do your job, let me do mine.",
        "Paul: That's very nice of you, thank you, but I'm sure you'd much rather talk to Carly.",
        "Carly: Jack?",
        "Jack: Go. Do your interview. Dazzle 'em for the second time tonight.",
        "Carly: Okay.",

        "Rosanna: Hi, excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but can I talk to you for a second?",
        "Carly: Hey. Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: Listen, I'm sorry to interrupt your big night, but I need you.",
        "Carly: No, no, what's going on? Jack just said that Cabot is missing?",
        "Rosanna: Well, not for much longer. You got to come with me.",
        "Carly: Where?",
        "Rosanna: Craig has Cabot.",

        "Stage manager: And we are out. We're back in 30 seconds.",
        "Doc: Hey, actually, buddy. You're in my light just a little bit. Could you just move?",
        "Process server: Could I actually get your autograph, doc?",
        "Doc: Yeah, man. No sweat.",

        "Kim: I can't wait to see this thing in action. And you working on your latest creation -- ta-da!",
        "Alison: I don't work very well with people watching over my shoulder. And that's why I'm always staying so late, because I get really nervous, and then I have to keep starting over again.",
        "Kim: Well, that's all the more reason to have a wheel here at home. Then you can practice private and get over your stage fright. So what about it? Do you have this thing turned on?",
        "Alison: Not yet.",
        "Kim: So, how does it work? Shall we give it a crack? Oh, wait a minute. Listen -- hold on, just want to see the news. I don't want to miss that tonight. [Sounds of argument] Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Have you completely lost your mind?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry, I should've told --",
        "Kim: Oh, no! Tell me I'm not seeing what I'm seeing.",
        "Alison: Who is that?",
        "Kim: My sportscaster. This is Kim Hughes. Are you all dead in the control room? Cut to the commercial! I'm on my way in!",

        "Paul: I'm not trying to stop you from doing your job, Jack. I'm trying to help you do your job.",
        "Jack: You want to atone for your sins, go see a priest. But Rosanna and Cabot, they're not your problem. And you've got enough on your plate. Your mother's scheduled for brain surgery, you got this fashion show that's gonna be on the cover of everything, and you and Carly -- where'd she go?",
        "Paul: I don't know. She was just right here.",
        "Jack: Listen, I gotta run. If you see her, tell her I'm looking for her.",
        "Paul: Jack -- Lucy? Hi. What are you doing here?",
        "Lucy: I got this really weird message from my father telling me to get to Las Vegas right away.",
        "Paul: He told you that?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. And I tried calling Rosanna, but she left word at the Lakeview that she was coming here for the fashion show, so when I heard that, I thought I'd get down here.",
        "Paul: Is Craig here, in Las Vegas?",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Why?",
        "Paul: A family? There's no way Rosanna's gonna want anything to do with Craig, unless here's here with Cabot.",
        "Lucy: Cabot's here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Jack: Is my wife here?",
        "Jordan: No. I was hoping you were Rosanna.",
        "Jack: Is she missing, too?",
        "Jordan: She had to step out for a minute.",
        "Jack: One of the models said she saw Rosanna and Carly talking a few minutes ago. Now they're both missing. Do you have idea what's going on?",
        "Jordan: I wish I could help you.",
        "Jack: Well, that's exactly what you're gonna do. And you're gonna start by telling me exactly where she went.",
        "Jordan: She didn't tell me anything.",
        "Jack: But you have your suspicions, right?",
        "Jordan: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Then start talking. Rosanna dragged my wife into this scheme of hers. And I'm not going anywhere until I find out what's up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I think I'm starting to feel sick to my stomach.",
        "Carly: You and me both. Did I ever tell you that Jack once got married in one of these Las Vegas chapels?",
        "Rosanna: I wonder if Craig is here already.",
        "Carly: Rosanna, this is crazy. You're gonna be a bigamist, or whatever they call it, right? What if somebody finds out?",
        "Rosanna: Well, if I have to marry Craig and have it declared illegal afterwards, so be it. At least I'll have my son.",
        "Carly: Are you sure about that?",
        "Rosanna: Absolutely.",
        "Justice of the peace: Good evening, and welcome to the palace of happiness wedding chapel. I should inform you that a marriage between you ladies in the state of Nevada isn't -- Mrs. Sinclair? What brings you back so soon? Only one per customer, you know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Who the hell do you think you are to come in here and hand me some mess like this?",
        "Process server: I'm just a guy doing his job.",
        "Doc: No, no, you're not doing your job. You wanted my autograph, didn't you? How about I give you something a little more permanent?",
        "Process server: You do, and I'll sue you so fast --",
        "Doc: And I'll be your throat even faster!",
        "Kim: What the hell do you think you're doing? Get him out of here, now! And you -- this better be good, because you are fresh out of second chances.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Look, I am not trying to be the morality police. I'm really not.",
        "Margo: Oh, Jessica --",
        "Jessica: And I know you think this thing with you and Doc is just innocent fun.",
        "Margo: There is no thing between me and Doc!",
        "Jessica: But next thing you know, you'll meeting him for lunch.",
        "Margo: Uh-huh. I already turned him down.",
        "Jessica: And you're not even slightly perturbed that he would have the gall to ask you, given that you're a married woman?",
        "Margo: Guys are like that. He's a guy. They do that all -- okay, not all guys, no. But -- oh, Jessica, I get hit on all the time.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. I know some of those guys. \"Hey, baby, let's me take you out to dinner in 10 to 20, or maybe 5 if I get out on good behavior.\"",
        "Margo: Yeah, you know that guy, too. Okay, exactly. So a sports hero with a bad boy reputation -- what's so bad about that?",
        "Jessica: Even if the \"sports hero bad boy\" is in your kitchen cooking you dinner?",
        "Margo: You know what? I had one of the lousiest days of my career today, and I've had a lot of lousy days. But Doc -- he made me forget that I had to send my sister to an institution. He made me forget the look in her eyes. He made me laugh when I was tired. He made me dinner. He took care of me for a couple of hours. And listen, baby, I know that you're worried because you love me. But Jess, you're making too much of this.",
        "Jessica: I do love you. And I know a little too well how careful we have to be about whom we allow in our lives. [Doorbell rings] Yes?",
        "Delivery man: Margo Hughes?",
        "Margo: Yes. Yes, yes.",
        "Delivery man: These are for you.",
        "Margo: Oh, thank you.",
        "Delivery man: Good night.",
        "Jessica: Those are gorgeous.",
        "Margo: Uh-huh. \"Loved cooking for you. We should do it again. Thanks for the lovely evening. Doc.\"",
        "Jessica: I rest my case.",
        "Ben: Jess?",
        "Jessica: Huh?",
        "Ben: They have this enormous plasma TV in their bedroom. The thing's a work of art. And the clarity is -- I think I know what I want for my birthday.",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm. No television in the bedroom -- flat screen or otherwise. I will be all the entertainment you need.",
        "Ben: Let the entertainment begin.",
        "Tom: Stop it. Get a room.",
        "Jessica: I'd better get this man home. Thanks for dinner.",
        "Ben: Yeah, it was delicious.",
        "Tom: Easiest dinner party we've ever thrown, considering the cooking was already done. That Doc Reese is a surprise every minute, isn't he?",
        "Jessica: Mm-hmm. He certainly is.",
        "Ben: Talk to you later.",
        "Tom: All right, man.",
        "Ben: All right.",
        "Tom: See you.",

        "Margo: Good night, guys. Thanks for coming.",
        "Tom: Let him get the plasma.",
        "Ben: So, I was thinking.",
        "Jessica: Yes?",
        "Ben: Yes. We could go home. Or, we could go back to our hotel room --",
        "Jessica: Oh!",
        "Ben: Make sure we got our money's worth.",
        "Jessica: Yeah. [Cell phone rings] Oh, don't answer it.",
        "Ben: It's not me. I'm on vibrate.",
        "Jessica: Stay that way, I'll be right with you. Hello?",
        "Doc: This is Doc Reese. I need a lawyer. How fast can you get down to WOAK?",
        "[Jessica sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I don't know where Cabot is, and I don't know what Rosanna's up to. But I'm pretty sure that marrying Craig is not high up on her list of things to do while she's here in Las Vegas.",
        "Lucy: Well, then why would he call and say that?",
        "Paul: I don't know. But if Craig is here with Cabot, and he's trying to put his family back together again --",
        "Lucy: We need to find Rosanna.",
        "Paul: Hey, when your dad called, did he call you on your cell phone?",
        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Well, does it have a call log that records incoming phone numbers?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. It's right here.",
        "Paul: That one there, is that the number that your dad might have called from?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I think so.",
        "Paul: It's local. Mind if I call?",
        "Lucy: No. Go ahead.",
        "Paul: Hi. I was just wondering where you were located. Thanks. I'll take care of this. You go find Rosanna.",
        "Lucy: Where are you going?",
        "Paul: Doesn't matter where I'm going. You find Rosanna. 'Cause I got a feeling she's gonna need to talk to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Look, all I know is Rosanna got a call from her ex-husband to meet her somewhere, and she took off like her life depended on it.",
        "Jack: What did she say?",
        "Jordan: She said something about the baby, and that everything would be all right.",
        "Jack: I knew this was about Cabot from the second she came back to Oakdale.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, well, he's the reason Rosanna and I got married today.",
        "Jack: Come again?",
        "Jordan: Rosanna said that she needed me to make everything right. So now I'm stuck in this so-called marriage to a woman that I barely know, and she's running off to be with her ex-husband. Does this make any sense to you?",
        "Jack: It's beginning to. Did Rosanna rent a car?",
        "Jordan: Probably. They'd know downstairs. Why?",
        "Jack: Most new car rentals have that global positioning system.",
        "Jordan: Oh, so you can track her down by satellite.",
        "Jack: Yeah. I'm gonna check with the hotel rental agent, see if they can hook me up. If Rosanna comes back or calls, you call me and let me know.",
        "Jordan: Rosanna, where are you? [Knock on door] Hi.",
        "Lucy: Hi. I'm sorry. I must have the wrong room. I looking for --",

        "Lucy: Yeah.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, well, you have the right room, but she's just -- she's not here right now.",
        "Lucy: Oh. Okay. Well, I will just leave a message downstairs.",
        "Jordan: Hold on. Wait a second. You look familiar. What's your name?",
        "Lucy: Lucy. Montgomery. I'm her stepdaughter.",
        "Jordan: Montgomery. You're Craig's daughter.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Are you her assistant?",
        "Jordan: No. No. Actually I'm her husband.",

        "Justice of the peace: And how is your husband?",
        "Rosanna: That's precisely why I need to speak with you. You see, we have a problem. This is my sister.",
        "Justice of the peace: A pleasure.",
        "Craig: Hope you didn't start without me!",
        "Carly: Oh, oh -- Craig! I was afraid you wouldn't get here!",
        "Craig: Carly! I'm sorry I'm late.",
        "Carly: You know, Rosanna is gonna handle all the details. There are a million of them. So why don't we let her talk to the justice of the peace for a little while, okay?",
        "Craig: So, Rosanna. I found Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I know. And that's wonderful news. Why don't you give me a little time to make all the arrangements for the ceremony?",
        "Craig: I'll take care of all that.",
        "Carly: No, no. Let Rosanna do it if she wants to. You and I can talk.",
        "Justice of the peace: My wife can help you two get started on the paperwork. The marriage license applications are just outside and on the left.",
        "Craig: Oh, you thought -- no.",
        "Carly: Let's go take a walk. We'll talk, honey.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. We're not the ones getting married.",
        "Carly: No, what he meant by that is --",
        "Justice of the peace: But I was under the impression that it was you --",
        "Rosanna: It's a very confusing situation. Because it's one of those days, you know? Kind of a crazy day.",
        "Craig: Yes. One of those days that comes along once in a lifetime. Or in our case -- twice. No, thrice. No, we're the ones. You're looking at the once and future Mr. And Mrs. Craig Montgomery and Rosanna Cabot.",

And what I choose to do with my purchases is no one's business but my own.",
        "Jessica: And you chose to haul everything out to the driveway, douse it with lighter fluid, and set them ablaze?",
        "Doc: Whatever, whatever. Ask me what she chose to do with my Maserati when we got a divorce. My baby. She took it for a joyride, burned out the engine, ruined the paint, and if that wasn't enough, drove it into a lake. And then had the nerve to walk away without a scratch on her.",
        "Jessica: I'll -- I'll reach out to her attorney in the morning and see if we can settle this out of court.",

        "Jessica: There's more?",
        "Doc: Yeah, there's more. Those papers were served to me while I was on the air, and I'm sure you've heard the one about killing the messenger?",
        "Jessica: Yeah, the thing you're not supposed to do.",
        "Doc: That's what they say. I guess I shook things up around here, 'cause I took the guy down, and the stage manager couldn't react. We were on the air.",
