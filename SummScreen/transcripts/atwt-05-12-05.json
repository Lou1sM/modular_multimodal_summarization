Just, you know, to make that everything is good for the big surprise. So, you know, let me know, even if they're in the car with you. We can talk in code if need be, all right?",

        "Jennifer: Sorry that we're fighting? Well, I doubt that.",
        "Mike: What are you doing here?",

        "Keith: Why would I?",
        "Lucinda: Because he's my man! He works for me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Hey, wait a minute, you can't fire me.",
        "Manager: Why not? You earned it.",
        "Gwen: Because of those two bimbos?",
        "Manager: Paying customers they're called. Wave nicely.",
        "Gwen: Will it get me my job back?",

        "Manager: Then you're still at bat. With two strikes.",
        "Gwen: All right, I got it. That was too close.",
        "Celia: You nearly lost your job because you stood up for me?",
        "Gwen: Oh, come on, those two were way too hot and bothered about your personal life. They needed to cool down.",
        "Celia: Yeah, but you shouldn't have taken a chance with your job like that, Gwen. But thanks.",
        "Gwen: Don't mention it.",
        "Celia: What is their problem?",
        "Gwen: You know, they're born mean. It's genetic, incurable. Besides you were right. Lia's had a crush on Casey for months.",
        "Celia: Really? I was just saying that.",
        "Gwen: Watch her whenever she's around him. It's all over her face.",
        "Celia: How do you know that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: We should just go with a standard limo, man. Look at that. It's classic.",
        "Josh: Very old school, but what if we want room for more couples?",
        "Casey: Then they're on their own.",
        "Josh: Hey, check it out. A van.",
        "Casey: No way!",
        "Josh: No, no, no, no, wait. It's a whole retro thing. You know, shag carpet --",
        "Casey: Dude, I can imagine what's growing in that carpet. And those seats? That's definitely minivan territory. What are you thinking?",
        "Josh: I'm thinking that I'm already tapped out on dinner and tux.",
        "Casey: Fine, then I'll get transport.",
        "Josh: Yeah?",
        "Casey: Yeah, man, I want to do this right, not cheap.",
        "Josh: Oh, nothing's too good for Miss Montega? I don't blame you.",
        "Casey: Stop.",
        "Josh: I must salute. First shot out of the gate, and you bag the hottest girl in school as your prom date. And about time.",
        "Casey: Excuse me?",
        "Josh: We were starting to worry about you. Gina? The gorgeous Christy? And those are just the ones I heard about from my sister. All those girls at school crushing on you, and you were such a -- gentleman.",
        "Casey: That's what you think?",
        "Josh: Hughes, you could've been a player. But instead you're in your room with your mp3 player.",
        "Casey: Is that a joke? Dude, don't try that without professional help. Hey, Zak! Join the living, man. What are you listening to?",
        "Zak: The demo Gwen gave us of her band.",

        "Carly: Yeah, yeah, it's great, isn't it? I'm -- Carly Snyder.",
        "Janitor: Welcome.",
        "Carly: Thanks. Would you like me to get out of your way here?",
        "Janitor: Oh, no, that's okay.",
        "Carly: I don't mind. I can go.",
        "Janitor: I'll start on the other side of the building and when I come back, I'll bang my mop on the wall real loud I don't startle you.",
        "Carly: That's not necessary, really.",
        "Janitor: Yeah, it is. I don't want to get skewered.",
        "Jack: Sorry. Sorry.",
        "Janitor: That's okay. It's been that kinda night.",
        "Jack: What was that all about?",
        "Carly: Nothing.",
        "Jack: The guy seemed a little bent out of shape.",
        "Carly: What? No. I just -- he's not used to people here at this time of the day, that's all.",
        "Jack: Yeah. So why are you here?",
        "Carly: Well, a good reason. Really. Dusty didn't just want my advice. He wanted to offer me a job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Jennifer, I really don't know how many times you need to hear it, but I swear to you I am not trying to break you and Mike up.",
        "Jennifer: Then what are you doing here?",
        "Mike: You thought we were gone, so you decided to break in?",
        "Katie: No, I told you, I didn't break in.",
        "Mike: Okay, so why'd you let yourself in?",
        "Katie: It's a surprise. A really good one, but I -- it'll all make sense in the morning, I swear.",
        "Mike: Look, what you've done, it'll never make sense. Or be right.",
        "Katie: I should just go.",
        "Jennifer: Katie, wait. I want to talk to her alone.",
        "Mike: There's no point.",
        "Jennifer: I think that there is.",
        "Mike: After the day that you've already had?",
        "Jennifer: Exactly, all right. I need to settle at least one thing. Please, please, Mike.",
        "Mike: All right.",
        "Katie: Jennifer, I am so sorry I just showed up here. It was a monumentally bad idea --",
        "Jennifer: You weren't thinking. You don't want to harm us. Do you ever just get sick of saying it?",
        "Katie: Yeah, sometimes I do. But it doesn't mean it isn't true. I don't know -- I don't understand what I can say to make you believe me?",
        "Jennifer: There's only one thing that I want you to say, Katie!",
        "Katie: Good. Tell me. Anything, name it.",
        "Jennifer: I want you to look me in the eye and tell me that you're not still in love with Mike!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I always watch Lia and Ann when they're around. So I noticed how Lia looks at Casey.",
        "Celia: I'd be happy never to see those two again.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, me too. But we don't really have much choice. Hey, keep an eye out. Don't turn your back when they're in the room.",
        "Celia: I guess. But thanks for the entertainment.",
        "Gwen: Hey, thanks for saving my butt with my manager. I really didn't think.",
        "Celia: It happens.",
        "Gwen: No, it happens to me a lot. Like with Will, on that date? I'd would do anything to take that back. I really blew it. Look, I know you don't want to get in the middle of it -- but if you could just tell him that for me? Just so he knows.",
        "Celia: Sure.",
        "Gwen: Thanks. Um -- I better get back to work.",
        "Celia: I changed my mind. If we really want to get Will's attention, I have a much better idea.",
        "Gwen: And what's that?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Zak: Why are you so against Gwen's band for the prom? You didn't even hear them.",
        "Casey: Okay, fine, I'll listen to 'em. But still.",
        "Zak: Still what?",
        "Casey: I still think we should listen to the mix from the radio station.",
        "Zak: Why?",
        "Casey: I just do.",
        "Josh: You get more variety. With a band it's one sound. And with Gwen fronting, it's that constant attitude.",
        "Zak: So true. It's only three tracks. Not much to judge on.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I bet those are the only decent songs those guys have.",
        "Zak: All right, I gotta go.",
        "Josh: Later.",
        "Casey: All right, later, man.",
        "Will: Hey!",
        "Casey: Hey. What happened to you?",
        "Will: New day, new life. Whatever.",
        "Casey: Sign me up.",
        "Will: Yeah. I hope you mean that, 'cause I think it's time we should party.",
        "Casey: A party?",
        "Will: Yeah, seriously. Let's get some beer and just kick back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Come on, Katie, pick up.",
        "Alison: So, Henry, your party starts pretty soon?",
        "Henry: I hope so.",
        "Alison: And Jennifer's whole family's coming?",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, they've all been invited, so --",
        "Alison: Okay, well, if I have to make myself scarce, Peter will come out and he'll handle the bar.",
        "Henry: You're avoiding Will Munson.",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Yeah. Yeah, I saw you two earlier. You know, looked pretty awkward.",
        "Alison: It's beyond awkward. Sort of my fault, sort of his. I just don't need another thing to worry about.",
        "Henry: No. It's hard without Aaron?",
        "Alison: Yeah, but it's worse for him. His mother's dying. Can you imagine? And I -- I feel, like, totally shallow for worrying about my life, but -- it is my life, right? I just want the person I love to be home with me. That shouldn't be so hard.",
        "Henry: No, it shouldn't. It's what we all want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh, I just want to end this tension now, Jennifer. I want us all to be able to be friends again. I know that what I did, telling Craig about the baby, even though it was an accident, was very wrong.",
        "Jennifer: But at the same time you think that it was my fault because I should have told Craig the truth in the first place.",
        "Katie: But at least he's gone now. You and Mike can get married. You can raise your baby.",
        "Jennifer: There's still a question on the table.",
        "Katie: I love my husband.",
        "Jennifer: That's what you keep telling us.",
        "Katie: It's true.",
        "Jennifer: Well, it's also true that right up until you said I do, you were still praying for Mike to stop you.",
        "Katie: Things have changed.",
        "Jennifer: Have they?",
        "Katie: Yes. I don't know what -- whatever you believe about how my marriage started, things are different now. All I want is to be with Henry.",
        "Jennifer: You just can't say it, can you?",
        "Katie: I'm just trying to be honest. Okay, I think that's the best thing. That is the only way for all of us to remain friends.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then just be honest. Are you still in love with Mike?",
        "Katie: Yes. Yes, I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So both Jen and I will be working. So it'll be a full-time job, but it won't be that crazy 24/7 thing that happens when --",
        "Jack: Wait, you took the job?",
        "Carly: Yeah, it's the perfect gig. Haven't you heard me?",
        "Jack: Every word.",
        "Carly: Well, then --",
        "Jack: Every word in between, honey. Even with Jennifer here, it's still a lot of pressure.",
        "Carly: I can handle it.",
        "Jack: You're sure.",
        "Carly: Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure. And stop looking at me like that.",
        "Jack: Like what.",
        "Carly: Like you think you're gonna find and ace up my sleeve.",
        "Jack: I know that's not where you hide you aces.",
        "Carly: You want to search me?",
        "Jack: Why was that janitor afraid you were gonna skewer him?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: Don't. You've been pedaling ever since I walked in here.",
        "Carly: That's because I want you to love this job, too. I want you to be happy for me.",
        "Jack: I want to do that, too. More than anything in the world. You want me to repeat the question?",
        "Carly: No. No, I remember it.",
        "Jack: The janitor startle you?",
        "Carly: Yeah. So what?",
        "Jack: Did you think he was Les Sweeny?",
        "Carly: No. I mean, I -- I didn't --",
        "Jack: Baby? Oh, baby. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.",

        "Private investigator: Step in only if there's a threat to your daughter.",
        "Lucinda: Exactly, exactly. All right. Thank you very much. You may go now and send me the bill.",
        "Private investigator: You can count on that. But I want my gun.",
        "Lucinda: Mr. Morrissey, would you give the man his weapon.",
        "Private investigator: I'll charge you for those, too.",
        "Lucinda: What a whiner. A lot of good he'd do in a pinch. My heavens, he's incomp -- darling, you almost disarmed him yourself, with your own -- now what are you looking at me like that for? You know perfectly well why I hired him. And why I was close by when he told me where you were going.",

        "Lucinda: Oh, even you must see it now, darling. And he's up to his eyeballs in debt.",
        "Lily: He took a leave of absence from his job to care of J.J. Yes, bills pile up. He borrowed some money from a friend, that's it.",

        "Lucinda: Lily, he did not come down to the docks to see his buddy Joe! He is in debt! He's in debt to the mob! He bet, and then he borrowed from the wrong kind of people to pay off his loan. Gambling debts. Not rent, not shoes for the little boy, for his little feet, or whatever sob story he told you. Its ten thousands of dollars. Thousands of gambling debts.",
