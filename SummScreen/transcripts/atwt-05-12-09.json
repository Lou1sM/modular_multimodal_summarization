        "Alison: Ah, free at last! Let's go eat.",
        "Casey: To talk to you about.",
        "Alison: Okay, well let's talk about it after we clock out and are eating burgers at Al's.",
        "Casey: How about we grill at my place?",
        "Alison: With your folks?",
        "Casey: They're not going to be there.",
        "Alison: Meaning?",
        "Casey: Meaning whatever happens after the barbecue is between you and me.",
        "[Ali chuckles]",
        "Jade: I clocked us out.",
        "Casey: Thanks. How is Liebowitz?",
        "Jade: Uh, as annoying as ever. But I managed to get him to and from his appointment without killing him.",
        "Casey: Awesome. I guess we'll check you later.",
        "Jade: All right.",
        "Alison: Jade, we are having a barbecuing at Casey's. You in?",
        "Jade: Really?",
        "Casey: Yes, sure. Yes.",
        "Jade: Okay, sounds fun. Thanks.",
        "Casey: Why don't you want to be alone with me?",
        "Alison: I will be. Later. After I prove you wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: Wrong.",
        "Emily: It's a brilliant headline.",
        "Hunter: Unless you classify it as such, no one will ever know.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Hunter: You're using the wrong font.",
        "Emily: You need to back off, Hunter. Way off.",
        "Hunter: Which way?",
        "Emily: It's not where. Its how close!",
        "[Crash]",
        "Emily: You have the most literal mind of anyone I've ever met.",
        "Hunter: Thank you, Emily. I think that's the first compliment you've given me.",
        "[Emily chuckles]",
        "Emily: Well, you treasure it from right there.",
        "Hunter: If it makes you more comfortable, I can monitor your keystrokes from here.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. I am never going to grasp the conversion of the \"Online Intruder\" if you don't back off and let me figure out on my own.",
        "Hunter: You're not figuring it out. You keep making the same stupid mistakes over and over again. Did I say something wrong?",
        "Emily: You just called me stupid. You're dead meat.",
        "Hunter: Well, I hope you don't mean that literally.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Prove me wrong about what?",
        "Alison: You thought that fixing Jade up with that guy who works with Emily was a bad idea.",
        "Casey: It was.",
        "Alison: Why? He's cute.",
        "Casey: He's clueless! And why are you trying to fix Jade up with someone, anyway? I'm not interested in her.",
        "Alison: Okay, don't flatter yourself. Not everything is about you.",
        "Casey: Well, who's it about, then?",
        "Alison: Jade! She's single, and it she seems like she wants to meet someone. So, you know, I'm just trying to be nice.",
        "Casey: You are full of it. Okay? But I'm flattered anyway.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'll meet you both at your place later.",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: I will go find Hunter.",
        "Casey: Hey, find out if that sucker likes meat.",
        "Jade: Don't tell me Alison's trying to set me up with someone.",
        "Casey: You remember that guy that spilled a drink on you?",
        "Jade: That guy? No way in hell!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: I didn't call you stupid. I said, \"Your mistakes are stupid.\"",
        "Emily: Hunter, I swear to God, if you keep saying that, I'm going to kill you.",
        "Hunter: No, no, no, you're not stupid. You're pretty smart, actually -- for a digital illiterate.",
        "Emily: Okay, you need to take a walk. A very long walk. Go get a cup of coffee or something.",
        "Hunter: Didn't you hear what Lucinda said? She wants us to show her a digital prototype tomorrow.",
        "Emily: Fine. That's great. I'm okay with that. On one condition.",
        "Hunter: That being?",
        "Emily: You out of here, now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: We must have left that book over at the other place, your old place. Craig's place. Come help me pick out another one, okay? John? Johnny?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What did your lawyer say?",
        "Craig: He's petitioning the court. Still.",
        "Carly: You'll get Johnny back, Craig.",
        "Craig: When? Dusty could be leaving the country with him right now.",
        "Carly: No. Didn't your lawyer make it so that they can't travel?",
        "Craig: Hmm.",
        "Carly: Have a little faith, would you?",
        "Craig: I want to get Johnny back before Dusty does any more damage.",
        "Carly: Dusty loves that boy. What kind of damage could he possibly do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Johnny? Hey. What were you doing in there, huh? Playing hide and seek? What's wrong? Why didn't you come to me when I called you? Talk to me, Johnny. What's the matter, you can't talk?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Knocking on door]",
        "Emily: Go away, Hunter. It's too soon.",
        "Alison: It's not Hunter.",
        "Emily: Oh, that's the best news I've heard all day.",
        "Alison: What have you done with the wonder kid? I wanted to talk to him.",
        "Emily: I sent him away so I can concentrate. Then he proceeded to call me every five minutes checking on my progress.",
        "Alison: Overachiever?",
        "Emily: And then some. I did manage to keep him away though for two very mellow cups of tea. Thank God.",
        "Alison: Is he at Al's or Java?",
        "Emily: Al's. Wait, wait. What did you want him for?",
        "Alison: We're having a barbecue at Casey's this afternoon.",
        "Emily: That's it?",
        "Alison: Yeah, and I thought, you know, he and Jade might be good together.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Yeah, I think you'd have better luck palming Jade off on someone who wasn't raised by cyber wolves in a techno forest.",
        "Alison: Hey, he's not that bad.",
        "Emily: Yeah, maybe not. I mean, if you want to keep Jade away from Casey --",
        "Alison: I am not worried about Casey.",
        "Emily: No, I think that you should probably introduce her to someone who would know what to do with a woman if he actually had one.",
        "Alison: Okay, I'm just trying to be a decent human being here. I'm not jealous of Jade, or worried that she's going to steal Casey or anything like that. God, is that so hard to believe?",
        "Emily: Yeah. Actually, it is. Now, I got to get back to work. So, you forget about Jimmy Neutron.",
        "Alison: I think he's cute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Will you please just humor Alison? She's trying to be friendly.",
        "Jade: Friendly? She's hooking me up with a known loser to get back at me for sleeping with you.",
        "Casey: That is not true. Okay, maybe a little. And, yeah, the guy's kind of geeky. But he has potential. And we should give him a chance.",
        "Jade: We? You didn't get spilled on.",
        "Casey: This will be different. It's a barbecue.",
        "Jade: Even better, maybe he'll light me on fire!",
        "Casey: Come on.",
        "Jade: Look, its fine that Alison wants to make me non-threatening. Standard girl trick. I've even pulled it before. But I draw the line at being hooked up with that klutz.",
        "Casey: You got to eat, right, huh? So, what are you going to do this afternoon?",
        "Jade: Try on clothes I can't afford.",
        "Casey: So when this guy shows up and you're not there, what am I supposed to tell him?",
        "Jade: I don't know, you'll think of something. Oh, and hey, I hope the three of you guys have a wonderful time.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: Hi, Alison.",
        "Alison: Hey, Hunter. I was looking for you.",
        "Hunter: You were?",
        "Alison: Yeah, to invite you to a barbecue that we're having at Casey's.",
        "Hunter: Why?",
        "Alison: Why? Because you're new in town and I didn't think you knew a lot of people. So, you know, I thought you'd maybe want to come have a burger with us.",
        "Hunter: Thanks. I can't go.",
        "Alison: Why not?",
        "Hunter: Oh, because of your sister. She doesn't know the difference between a megabyte and a gigaflop. She needs a lot of help.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Are you sure about that? 'Cause I was kind of under the impression that she wanted a little time to work on her own.",
        "Hunter: Yeah, I'm sorry, but she's going to call any minute now begging me to bail her out. I can't leave her in the lurch.",
        "Alison: Okay. That's a shame. Another time.",
        "Hunter: When?",
        "Alison: I mean, I don't know when. \"Another time\" is an expression. You know, it doesn't mean I have an exact date in mind.",
        "Hunter: I knew that.",
        "Alison: Okay, then. So, I'll see you later. And that is also an expression.",
        "Hunter: Sometime in the not too distant future.",
        "Alison: Yes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I have a right to raise my child.",
        "Carly: Yes, you do. And more often than not, you make him feel safe and loved. There have been times where you've got it wrong.",
        "Craig: You're blaming me now?",
        "Carly: No. You and Dusty have both botched it with Johnny more than once. And he's a pretty good kid, too, despite what you've done, not because of it.",
        "Craig: Johnny's gotten attached to me. Dusty Donovan is hardly a family man, no matter what he feels for Johnny. I just don't want him to undo all my work.",
        "Carly: Is that what you're worried about? That Johnny will fall apart without you?",
        "Craig: I just don't want him to turn Johnny against me. He's all I've got.",
        "Carly: What about your other child?",
        "Craig: What other child?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Dusty, what happened?",
        "Dusty: We need to see a doctor.",
        "Lucy: I am a doctor.",
        "Dusty: Anybody but you.",
        "Lucy: Dusty, you gotta listen to me.",
        "Dusty: I want to see another doctor.",
        "Lucy: I am Johnny's sister, no matter what you think of me right now. I'm here. Let me take care of him. Christine.",
        "Nurse: Yes, Dr. Montgomery?",
        "Lucy: Would you mind taking him into that room, please?",
        "Nurse: Of course.",
        "Lucy: I'll be with you in just a minute. What happened?",
        "Dusty: I gotta be with him.",
        "Lucy: No, tell me what happened.",
        "Dusty: He wanted this one book. I couldn't find it. Then I couldn't find him. There was a crash in the bathroom, and there he was.",
        "Lucy: Oh, God. Was he bruised or cut? Did he hurt his head?",
        "Dusty: No, no, he was hiding. He seems fine. He's just not talking.",
        "Lucy: No sound at all?",
        "Dusty: I gotta get in there. I gotta be with him.",
        "Lucy: No, okay, all right, listen. Come with me to look after him. We'll get to the bottom of this. I promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know what hurts the worst? It's that my daughter betrayed me because she was pursuing the affections of that two-bit thug.",
        "Carly: You should try to forgive her.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Carly: Because you'll regret it if you don't.",
        "Craig: I'll take my chances with that one.",
        "Carly: Craig, have you forgotten how hurt you were when she was gone?",
        "Craig: We both know the real reason she came back here. It wasn't to reconcile with me. It was so she could use me and my company for her own purposes.",
        "Carly: Humanitarian purposes.",
        "Craig: She put a bull's-eye on my head, Carly, and on yours, for that matter.",
        "Carly: She was trying to send medicine to sick people.",
        "Craig: And if anyone was arrested for smuggling, it was going to be me. I actually have to admire the perfection. She could use me and stick it to me at the same time.",
        "Carly: But she came forward, didn't she? She wasn't going to let you go to jail for something you didn't do.",
        "Craig: Yeah, she just took her sweet time deciding I was worth saving, and in the meantime, I lost custody of my son to Dusty Donovan.",
        "Messenger: Delivery for Mr. Montgomery.",
        "Craig: Yes. Thank you.",
        "Carly: Is that it?",
        "Craig: I have my son back. Care to join me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Dusty, open up!",
        "Carly: All right, Craig, just calm down.",
        "Craig: Dusty! I've got a court order reinstating custody back to me! I'm taking Johnny home right now. Dusty!",
        "Carly: Excuse me. Have you seen Mr. Donovan?",
        "Maid: Oh, he had to take the little boy to the hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: How much work did you get done without me? Three paragraphs?",
        "Emily: Three perfectly formatted paragraphs.",
        "Emily: Okay, okay, you know what? You -- you're gonna get a lot more out of me if you let me figure this out on my own.",
        "Hunter: But if you don't know what mistakes you're making, how will you know how to correct them?",
        "Emily: Hunter, I'm used to flying solo here, okay? Give me a break. You need you to trust me, okay? I will get this, I promise. Just -- you gotta give me a chance, can you do that?",
        "Hunter: I guess it's hard for an old dog to learn new tricks.",
        "Emily: I am gonna pretend I didn't hear that.",
        "Hunter: How long do you want me to stay gone this time? 20 minutes?",
        "Emily: No, way more than that. Wait, hang on, I'm sorry. Alison stopped by. She was looking for you, something about a barbecue?",
        "Hunter: Yeah, that was awfully nice of her.",
        "Emily: Well, you should go. Eat. Mingle. Take the afternoon off. That's an order.",
        "Hunter: And you can't give me orders. You're not my boss. We're partners.",
        "Emily: Right, right. You see, that's the great thing about being a co-boss, though. You can take the afternoon off, if you want.",
        "Hunter: Hey, I don't know. I have an obligation to you.",
        "Emily: Consider it moot.",
        "Hunter: Are you sure?",
        "Emily: I am sure if you stay here while I'm trying to learn this, one of us will die.",
        "Hunter: I can find no fault with that premise.",
        "Emily: Okay, so go. Get a burger, get a life. Alison's got big plans for you, Hunter.",
        "Hunter: Really?",
        "Emily: Mm-hmm, go have some fun.",
        "Hunter: Oh, I don't have Alison's number.",
        "Emily: Well, you're in luck, Partner. It just so happens I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: I have some bad news.",
        "Alison: Me, too. You first.",
        "Casey: Jade's not coming. She doesn't want us to set her up.",
        "Alison: That's fine, because Hunter said no. He would rather torment my sister, even though Emily's doing everything she can to get him out of her hair.",
        "Casey: You better not expect me to be disappointed. Because I was hoping for a little alone time with you.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Casey: No.",
        "Alison: Hello?",
        "Hunter: Hello, Alison. It's Hunter. I got your number from your sister.",
        "Alison: Hunter? Hi.",
        "Hunter: Is that invitation still open for the barbecue or whatever?",
        "Alison: Sure. Did Emily give you the address?",
        "Hunter: I've already mapped it on my phone. She's been real anxious to get me out of the office, so she's been helpful.",
        "Alison: Just come around the patio when you get here. We will see you soon.",
        "Casey: What did you do that for?",
        "Alison: I already invited him.",
        "Casey: But now it's going to be a threesome, and not the good kind.",
        "Alison: I guess you better find Jade and talk her into coming.",
        "Casey: And why would I do that?",
        "Alison: Duh. Because if Hunter and Jade have alone time, so will we.",
        "Casey: Okay, okay. I'll be right back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Wow.",
        "Jade: What are you doing? Following me?",
        "Casey: No. I mean, yes. But it's for a cause.",
        "Jade: What, did something happen after I left work?",
        "Casey: I'm going to give the barbecue idea another pitch.",
        "Jade: Forget it.",
        "Casey: No, come on, Jade. This Hunter guy is coming, and we need a fourth. Just give him another chance, and if it doesn't work out, I will never try to fix you up again.",
        "Jade: That doesn't sound like a real big payoff for me.",
        "Casey: Okay, listen. Next time I have to drive, I will take cranky Mr. Liebowitz, and you can have one of my nice patients.",
        "Jade: Nope, still not good enough.",
        "Casey: I will take Mr. Liebowitz and Mrs. Moretti.",
        "Jade: Now you're talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hunter, hi. Thanks for coming. Come on in.",
        "Hunter: Where's everybody else?",
        "Alison: On their way, I hope.",
        "Hunter: Your sister said I should bring some candy as a hostess gift, so I did.",
        "Alison: Oh, thank you. Gummi worms?",
        "Hunter: Oh, should I have brought something different? I thought, I like Gummi worms, maybe you like Gummi worms. Maybe that's kind of weird.",
        "Alison: It is. But I happen to love these little critters. I have a secret stash of them at the hospital. Don't tell anyone, though.",
        "Hunter: It looks like we have a lot in common.",
        "Alison: We do. So by all means, help yourself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: You seem to be okay. You're not talking too much, though, huh? You know who I am?",
        "Johnny: You're Lulu.",
        "Lucy: That's right. Hey, why don't you let me talk to him for just a minute, okay? All right, what's wrong? What's bothering you so much you don't want to talk?",
        "Johnny: I'm scared.",
        "Lucy: Well, this has been a scary time. But hey, you and I don't have to run and hide anymore. You live right here in Oakdale. You're surrounded by people who love you, people who want to care for you. Will you let Nurse Christine help you get dressed?",
        "Johnny: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: Yeah? Give him a lollipop, okay? You know why he stopped talking, don't you?",
        "Dusty: I would have left him longer at Craig's place if I could have.",
        "Lucy: It's not that simple.",
        "Dusty: Maybe he just needs a few more weeks with me to get acclimated.",
        "Lucy: No, you did this. You and my father.",
        "Craig: What happened to Johnny?",
        "Dusty: He's okay. He's all right now.",
        "Craig: Then what's he doing in a hospital?",
        "Lucy: Look at you. This is what I'm talking about!",
        "Carly: Is Johnny okay?",
        "Lucy: He's fine. But all of this confusion and this fighting have taken a terrible toll on him. He stopped talking today.",
        "Craig: Why?",
        "Lucy: Is it any wonder? The two people who love him the most can't stop attacking each other. Instead of making him feel safe, you've made him want to hide out from the world. And it's gotta stop. Or you're gonna do the kind of damage that cannot be undone.",
        "Craig: I'm not interested in your psychological assessment.",
        "Carly: You should be.",
        "Craig: I want Johnny examined by a different doctor.",
        "Carly: Why? Lucy's his sister. Do you think he'd be more comfortable with somebody else?",
        "Dusty: She's right. Lucy's right.",
        "Craig: Don't you tell me about my son.",
        "Carly: Craig, stop it. Just calm down.",
        "Craig: I have a court order reinstating Johnny's custody back to me. He's legally mine now.",
        "Lucy: So are you just gonna take him right now, without any kind of explanation?",
        "Carly: What do you think is best, Lucy?",
        "Lucy: I think Dusty should take him home, since he brought him here.",
        "Craig: Why did I know that you'd side with him?",
        "Lucy: And Dusty, I think that you should take Johnny back to my father. It'll be better for him that way.",
        "Craig: All right. Deliver Johnny to me at the Lakeview in 30 minutes.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: Hey, is there something I can do to help?",
        "Alison: Yeah, do you want to grill the meat?",
        "Hunter: I don't grill.",
        "Alison: What, were you born in some other land, far far away?",
        "Hunter: No, right here in the U.S. of A.",
        "Alison: Were your parents vegetarian, vegan?",
        "Hunter: Do you know what happens when you grill meat? Scientifically speaking?",
        "Alison: Actually, no, science isn't really my strong suit. You could ask my teachers in nursing school. But I am getting better, so please enlighten me. What happens when you grill meat?",
        "Hunter: It creates heterocyclic amines.",
        "Alison: And those would be --",
        "Hunter: Carcinogens, when the fat molecules bond to the surface.",
        "Alison: Oh, okay. Well then, do you want to open a beer for yourself?",
        "Hunter: I don't drink.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I don't, either.",
        "Hunter: Really?",
        "Alison: Yeah. So what, is it just that you're not into putting toxins into your body, or do you have more of a sordid past, like me?",
        "Hunter: What did you do that was sordid?",
        "Alison: Maybe we'll talk about that some other time.",
        "Hunter: I shouldn't have asked.",
        "Alison: No, it's fine.",
        "Hunter: I tend to just say what comes my mind. It gets me in trouble sometimes.",
        "Alison: Well, you're not in trouble with me -- yet. Do want to put those Gummi worms in a bowl for me?",
        "Hunter: Sure.",
        "Jade: I let you off way too easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I should have taken Johnny out of town when I had the chance.",
        "Lucy: Would you rather have had this incident happen thousands of miles away? It would have been a lot more traumatic for him.",
        "Dusty: I understand, but handing him back over to Craig?",
        "Lucy: You have no choice. My father has a court order.",
        "Dusty: How do I just give him up?",
        "Lucy: By asking yourself the same question that my father is afraid to ask -- what's best for Johnny?",
        "Dusty: My wife didn't want Craig raising him.",
        "Lucy: Okay. But she's gone. You're here. You know this boy. You love him. Which means that you know that you and my father need to settle this. Because if you don't, Johnny's just gonna keep retreating further and further into himself. And before you know it, this little incident that happened today, it's not just going to be a temporary coping mechanism. It's going to be a wall that he hides behind for the rest of his life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Club soda, as requested.",
        "Carly: And what are we drinking to?",
        "Craig: Law and order. And that beautiful court document that returns my son to me. Long live justice.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'm not going to toast to that poor little child's heart being split in two. He loves you, Craig. But as far as he's concerned, he's got two fathers.",
        "Craig: In about a year or so, he'll forget that Dusty ever even existed.",
        "Carly: You are lying to yourself if you believe that.",
        "Craig: You're early. But you seem to have forgotten my son.",
        "Dusty: I'm not handing Johnny over to you. Not yet. Not until we settle this.",
        "Carly: Excuse me.",
        "Craig: There's nothing to talk about. The court order's clear.",
        "Dusty: It's clear that you can cut Johnny out of my life. But if you do, he'll suffer.",
        "Craig: Are you threatening me?",
        "Dusty: No, no. Like it or not, you and I are attached. I'm Johnny's connection to his mother. You're his biological father.",
        "Craig: Which means I have the upper hand, whether you like it or not. Legally speaking, you're out in the cold, Dusty. Live with it.",
        "Dusty: I don't think I can. And I won't go behind your back. I won't do it to Johnny. It's too stressful for him.",
        "Craig: All right, what are you asking of me?",
        "Dusty: I'm asking for a place in his life.",
        "Craig: You have a lot of nerve asking me for a place in my son's life. You were ready to let me rot in jail for a crime I didn't commit. You even manipulated my daughter to go along with it.",
        "Dusty: What about all the times you tried to make me disappear? It's been dirty on both sides.",
        "Craig: The difference is, Johnny's my blood. Not yours.",
        "Dusty: We hate each other, that won't change.",
        "Craig: Dusty, the only reason you're here, right now, is because you lost. Where's my son?",
        "Dusty: In the lobby.",
        "Craig: Hey, Johnny! Guess what? It's time to go home.",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Dusty: I took your advice. It didn't work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay, help me get them to talk to each other.",
        "Casey: How?",
        "Alison: Follow my lead. Hunter, you should tell Jade about how you're trying to bring the \"Intruder\" into the 21st century.",
        "Hunter: Oh, okay. Do you read the \"Intruder?\"",
        "Jade: No.",
        "Casey: Well, the burgers are done. Hunter, what do you want on yours?",
        "Alison: Ah, he doesn't eat them.",
        "Casey: Oh, vegetarian?",
        "Hunter: Because of the grill. Carcinogens.",
        "Casey: Oh, well. I made these one special for you, you know. Easy on the carcinogens.",
        "Hunter: That's impossible.",
        "Casey: And that was a joke.",
        "Hunter: Oh, right, hey!",
        "Casey: Oh right, hey!",
        "Hunter: I will -- I will have a burger.",
        "Casey: I like it. Live dangerously, grab a plate.",
        "Alison: Oh, and I hear that ketchup is a good carcinogen remover.",
        "Hunter: You know, I'll start with the ketchup, and see how it goes. Casey, the hamburger's good. You want one?",
        "Jade: Yeah, thanks. I think that one's yours.",
        "Hunter: Oh, my mistake. Oh, I am so sorry.",
        "Jade: It's okay. Five second rule.",
        "Hunter: What's that?",
        "Casey: Well, if the food hasn't been on the ground for more than five seconds, it's germ free.",
        "Alison: We know it's not scientific. And it's not supposed to be.",
        "Hunter: I gotta go. I promised Emily I'd be back to help her out in case she needs me.",
        "Alison: But you haven't even finished your burger.",
        "Hunter: I'll take it with me. Thanks again. It's really good. I'm not just saying that. Sorry I dropped yours.",
        "Jade: Don't ever do that to me again.",
        "Alison: Okay, you could do a lot worse. He's sweet.",
        "Jade: That guy is a human train wreck.",
        "Alison: Okay, maybe he's probably just nervous around pretty girls, so he drops things. I think it might be a lot better once you guys get used to each other.",
        "Jade: Was this really that fun for you, Alison? To put me in my place by setting me up with someone so hopeless?",
        "Alison: Okay, he's just shy. And seriously, I thought you might like him. I was just trying to be a friend.",
        "Jade: Yeah, well maybe you should stop trying to be a friend.",
        "Casey: How about a potato chip?",
        "Jade: No thanks. I'm suddenly not hungry.",
        "Casey: Well, we should do this more often.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: Should I stay or should I go?",
        "Emily: No, no. You stay. You look. Applaud.",
        "Hunter: It's good. That's very good. I'm impressed.",
        "Emily: So am I. So, how did the barbeque go?",
        "Hunter: Not so well.",
        "Emily: Oh, Lord. What happened? Details.",
        "Hunter: You know, at least I didn't burn down the house.",
        "Emily: So what'd you think of Jade?",
        "Hunter: I don't think she's my type. Your sister, Alison, sure is nice, though.",
        "Emily: Yeah, she likes you, too.",
        "Hunter: You know, I had this mishap when I was trying to get Jade a hamburger and Alison didn't even laugh. You two really are different.",
        "Emily: You think?",
        "Hunter: Is there a big age difference between you two?",
        "Emily: What do you consider big?",
        "Hunter: Like, do you two have different fathers or something?",
        "Emily: Yes, Hunter, we have different fathers. And different mothers, technically.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I'd offer to intervene, but you may have noticed my father isn't speaking to me. Probably want to be alone, huh?",
        "Dusty: Hold on a second. Just keep talking for a while, would you?",
        "Lucy: Okay, about what?",
        "Dusty: Not about Johnny. Just, you know. How'd you get out of jail.",
        "Lucy: Damian Grimaldi was helping me ship the medical supplies. He tracked down Fredo, and when they got their man, they let me go.",
        "Dusty: Damian Grimaldi? Why would you choose someone your family hates to help you out?",
        "Lucy: It seemed like a good idea at the time.",
        "Dusty: A good idea would have been to let your father sink.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I thought I didn't care about my father any more. But I found out that I do. I wish I didn't miss him so much.",
        "Dusty: Give it time. It'll pass.",
        "Lucy: It's hard to miss somebody, isn't it?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: When Dusty wanted to talk to you alone, did he say anything constructive?",
        "Craig: Dusty's big epiphany? He had the audacity to ask me to make a place for him in Johnny's life.",
        "Carly: And you turned him down?",
        "Craig: Of course I did.",
        "Carly: How could you do that?",
        "Craig: Don't preach to me.",
        "Carly: How can you give that little boy the best of everything, and then refuse to give him something that he needs just as much as he needs to run or play?",
        "Craig: You're starting to cross a line now, Carly.",
        "Carly: Dusty has been a part of that child's life since he was born. He's the only connection left to his mother. And you're going to deny him that?",
        "Craig: Dusty Donovan is a dangerous man.",
        "Carly: No, he's not endangering Johnny.",
        "Craig: He's dangerous because he would do anything to steal my son.",
        "Carly: Right. You know, Hal and I used to do that. We used to fight tooth-and- nail over Parker, we were both so afraid that one of us would be cut off from our child's life. It wasn't until we stopped fighting that I realized that Parker could need us both. He could love us both. More love in a child's life is not a bad thing.",
        "Craig: Yeah, your situation isn't the same as mine. It's one thing to dread losing a child, it's another to actually lose one.",
        "Carly: Do you want Johnny to resent you? Because he will. He will resent you for making Dusty stay away from him.",
        "Craig: I'll deal with that if and when it happens.",
        "Carly: Right. Because to come to an agreement now with Dusty would take a bit of generosity.",
        "Craig: Which you think I lack.",
        "Carly: I don't see you doing anything to help the situation.",
        "Craig: What if I did? Let's just assume for a moment that I am that generous of a guy. That I would make room for Dusty in Johnny's life. Just assume.",
        "Carly: Yeah?",
        "Craig: Is that guy someone that you could fall in love with? All right, maybe it's a dumb question. Here I thought you wouldn't go for me because of some lack on my part. But now I realize it's possible that you just think I'm too good for you.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm certain that's not it.",
        "Craig: Then what is it, Carly?",
        "Carly: Well, if you do go all generous and reasonable on me, maybe I wouldn't be able to help myself.",
        "Craig: You serious?",
        "Carly: I might be. You know, a bad girl like me can't help but love a good man.",
        "Craig: Excuse me.",
        "Carly: Who are you calling?",
        "Craig: A sitter for Johnny. And you come with me before I change my mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: I'd like to think that it'll pass with time, but it probably won't. My father will probably keep me away from Johnny, too. And I love him as much as you do, Dusty.",
        "Craig: May I have a word?",
        "Dusty: Sure.",
        "Craig: If you'll excuse us.",
        "Lucy: Certainly.",
        "Craig: I reconsidered what you said. We'll work something out. Have you're lawyer call my lawyer.",
        "Dusty: I'll do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I don't know why I let you lead me down this conversation.",
        "Hunter: Me either. But you've got my attention. How can you and your sister have a different mother and father?",
        "Emily: Okay, can you make sure this gets finished by morning?",
        "Hunter: Not until you explain.",
        "Emily: Fine. Fine. Technically, Alison is my sister and my daughter. I donated an egg to my mother, many years ago, when she was having trouble getting pregnant.",
        "Hunter: That's pretty cool. And scientifically revolutionary for the time.",
        "Emily: Well, I was very young when it all happened.",
        "Hunter: That's beautiful -- biologically speaking.",
        "Emily: I don't talk about it very often. I don't know, something tells me you're not a gossip.",
        "Hunter: I'm not.",
        "Emily: Let me guess. Ethics?",
        "Hunter: Opportunity. Who would I gossip with? But thanks for telling me.",
        "Emily: Eh, sure. You know what, I've had enough of the digital world. So can you finish up all this on your own?",
        "Hunter: Gladly.",
        "Emily: Thanks, Hunter.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Case, I don't -- okay, I don't think I'm ready.",
        "Casey: I've got an idea. How about we take the whole sleeping together idea off the table.",
        "Alison: Forever?",
        "Casey: For now. You know, we won't even have it as an option.",
        "Alison: Until?",
        "Casey: Until, in some clear-headed, non-passionate moment, we both agree otherwise.",
        "Alison: I like that idea.",
        "Casey: Okay. But I really want to make out with you.",
        "Alison: And why is that?",
        "Casey: Well, it's the way you flip those burgers.",
        "Alison: See? I know what boys like.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, you're pretty proud of yourself, aren't you?",
        "Craig: You should be proud of me, too. Opening the door to Dusty Donovan was like swallowing broken glass.",
        "Carly: I am proud of you, actually.",
        "Craig: Well, what happened? I thought I was generous Craig? The guy that you could fall in love with.",
        "Carly: What about your daughter?",
        "Craig: Don't push it.",
        "Carly: Well, I'll consider you a work in progress then.",
        "Craig: You must like me a little to let me off the hook that easily.",
        "Carly: You'll do. I'll see you around, Craig.",
        "Craig: See you around, Carly.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Carly: Be man enough to tell your daughter that you love her. To forgive her the way she's forgiven you.",
        "Lucy: You think that there's a chance that we could build something together?",
        "Paul: You want to be my wife? It has to be real, in every sense of the word."
