        "When Meg blatantly ignores a call from Dusty, Paul demands answers. Meg coyly tells him that she is there to stay and perhaps even marry again. Meanwhile, a worried Dusty talks with Holden and tells him that he should be worried about Meg's game. Holden goes to see Meg, and he offers her a place to stay so she can get out of Paul's house, but she tells him that she can't be away from Eliza. Carly tries to talk with Craig about reconciling with Lucy, but he won't hear of it. Lucinda is coaxing Lucy into telling Dusty how she feels, but she is too concerned about her father forgiving her. Lucinda thinks that she will forget about that if she has love and a baby of her own in her life. Carly calls Lucy over for lunch, as she has also invited Craig. Craig is none too pleased with the ambush and tells Carly so, who at least wants him to hear Lucy out. Lucy pleads her case, as Craig can't turn his heart back from stone. He doesn't want her in his life and he can't forgive her. A devastated Lucy leaves and Carly wants Craig to leave himself. She puts up with his lies, crimes and moral shortcomings because the one thing he had going for him was the love he had for his children; she doesn't understand how he would throw his child's love away. Craig is not convinced at first, but Carly really lays into him and reminds him all the people he loves who had to forgive him over the years. Craig is finally convinced and decides he and Carly should go find Lucy. Meanwhile, Lucy is meeting with Dusty to voice her pleasure that he and Craig may be working on custody arrangements for Johnny. She tells him that she can't take the pain of not being able to see her father or Johnny so she is going back to East Africa... unless there is a reason for her to stay. When Dusty can commit, Lucy sadly heads on her way wishing him well. Paul wants to know what Meg's game is with wanting to be married again, as Meg claims there is none. Paul wonders if she is going to be his wife with her mind, body and soul because anything less won't do. Meg can't make love to Paul and tells him that she doesn't love him anymore and they can't go back and pretend what has happened hadn't. Paul is furious, as Meg tells him that she is leaving. Paul promises her that would be a mistake, but she won't back down. Lucy shares a tearful goodbye with Lucinda and Johnny. Craig and Carly show up at Lucy's, but she is gone. Dusty tells them that Lucy left for East Africa, as Craig is visibly upset. Holden arrives to take Meg to his and Lily's house, as Paul promises that she will not see her child grow up. Meg promises that she will not stop fighting until she gets her daughter back, as Paul assures her that he won't let her. Meg sadly bids Eliza goodbye and heads out the door."

        "Meg: I'm sorry. What did you say?",
        "Paul: Don't play games with me.",
        "Meg: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Paul: Come on! First you do everything you can to make me think that you're having an affair with Dusty, and now you're working overtime to make me think that you're not. So just tell me, which is it?",
        "Meg: I'm not playing any games anymore. I am here with you, Paul, and I'm here to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, good morning, gentlemen.",
        "Craig: Hey.",
        "Carly: Enjoying your breakfast?",
        "Craig: We sure are. Here, join us.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Craig: I promised Johnny waffles this morning.",
        "Carly: Mmm, waffles. They look good.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I would have taken him all the way to Belgium for the real deal if he asked me.",
        "Carly: Johnny here is a world traveler. He may have been to Belgium already, huh?",
        "Craig: I've missed a lot of time with him. That's for sure.",
        "Carly: You're making up for it now?",
        "Craig: I almost didn't want to take him to school today. No.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Craig: No, you're not gonna play hooky this morning. I want you to get ready for school, okay?",
        "Johnny: I want Lulu to take me.",
        "Craig: Well, Lulu's busy this morning, so Daddy's gonna take you, all right? So, go wash your hands. Go on.",
        "Carly: Poor kid. How are you gonna explain to him that he's not gonna be seeing his big sister anymore?",
        "Craig: He'll adjust.",
        "Carly: No, he won't. We have to make peace with Lucy for Johnny's sake.",
        "Craig: You know where I stand. I'm not gonna discuss it.",
        "Carly: You're gonna regret this. It'll really start to bother you.",
        "Craig: Are you saying something?",
        "Carly: Your daughter needs you, and your son needs his sister.",
        "Craig: You see, your lips are moving, but there's no sound coming out.",
        "Carly: You have to take this more seriously!",
        "Craig: I am very serious. I will never forgive Lucy. Now drop it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Grandmother, hi.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, Honey, Honey. Oh! Oh, it's so good to see you smiling.",
        "Lucy: Well, I heard you had a good checkup this morning.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: I'm smiling, too. Oh, and I'm so happy, honey. I'm so happy that my girl is not languishing in police custody.",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Lucy: I prefer to think of it as being \"Held for questioning,\" but --",
        "Lucinda: Okay, whatever. Whatever. Just so long as you promise me that you have -- you're moving on from this sideline in smuggling.",
        "Lucy: Uh, well, yes, it's true. That chapter of my life is over. And I can never thank you enough for helping me. Thank you so much.",
        "Lucinda: All's well that ends well.",
        "Lucy: I don't know. I'm not sure that it has ended well. My father still won't talk to me.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Honey, what's wrong with that? Who wants to hear Craig drone on and on anyway?",
        "Lucy: Well, he'll never forgive me for going behind his back and siding with Dusty.",
        "Lucinda: Sweetheart, you can have a full, rich life without Craig Montgomery. Some people would say this is something to celebrate.",
        "Lucy: No. Not me. I miss Johnny. And as much as I hate to admit it, I miss my father, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Can we just be honest with each other, please? I know that you still love your daughter.",
        "Craig: Hey! Hands all clean? Show me. All right! High five! Let's get your stuff together. Get ready. Now, where were we?",
        "Carly: We were talking about Lucy.",
        "Craig: No. New subject. Actually, we should brainstorm about how to finesse this P.R. disaster at Midnight Sun.",
        "Carly: Wait. Now, why would I be involved in that? You bought me out.",
        "Craig: I was hoping you'd come on as a creative consultant. Could benefit us both.",
        "Carly: You may be right. Why don't you come over to my place for lunch today, and we will celebrate new beginnings?",
        "Craig: Oh. I like the sound of that.",
        "Carly: All righty then. How about 12:30?",
        "Craig: 12:30 it is. I'll see you later.",
        "Carly: Yes, you will. Now, where did I put that number?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Holden, you hear from Meg lately?",
        "Holden: No. Why?",
        "Dusty: Just wondering.",
        "Holden: I thought she was keeping her distance from you.",
        "Dusty: I'm worried about her.",
        "Holden: Well, maybe you should stop worrying about her.",
        "Dusty: You're worried about her, too. I know you are.",
        "Holden: The family is worried about her because she went back to Fairwinds.",
        "Dusty: She's not answering your calls, either, huh?",
        "Holden: No. She's keeping to herself. Want to tell me what's going on?",
        "Dusty: She's in way over her head with Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Before you go, I -- I just need to ask you something.",
        "Meg: Okay. Go ahead.",
        "Paul: What you said before, that you're here with me, you're here to stay -- what does that mean exactly?",
        "Meg: That was a simple sentence. \"Meg is here to stay.\"",
        "Paul: In what capacity?",
        "Meg: Why do we have to define it?",
        "Paul: 'Cause we do. Why are you here? What are you -- you're -- you're a boarder? You're a houseguest? You're -- you're what? You're a glorified nanny?",
        "Meg: Well, how about a wife?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Well, you should have nothing for him but contempt!",
        "Lucy: But you can't choose your parents.",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lucy: I was born loving him, and I always will.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I think you should find someone more deserving of your love.",
        "Lucy: Oh, God, please. Not another lecture about how I need a man.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, you do. Anyone can see it.",
        "Lucy: No, it's not true. I have a very busy life.",
        "Lucinda: And if you got a nice man, a man who really loved you and put you before everything else, maybe even if you had a little Johnny of your own -- oh, my heavens, there would be no need to reconcile with your dear old dad.",
        "Lucy: Thank you for the pep talk.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Lucy: I should go sign out.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: I got to go, too, honey. All right. If you need a shoulder, you got me. And just start looking for love where you can get it.",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Lucy: Thank you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lucy: Hello.",
        "Carly: Hi, Lucy. It's Carly.",
        "Lucy: Is everything okay?",
        "Carly: Yes, yes. Everything's just fine. Um, I was just wondering if you wanted to come by for lunch.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Why don't you just let me worry about my sister?",
        "Dusty: I don't think you're worried enough.",
        "Holden: What do you want me to do? Go over there and drag her out? She's not going to do what I want her to do.",
        "Dusty: Living with Paul is the worst mistake she could make.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. But she wants to be near her baby.",
        "Dusty: She's putting herself and her baby at risk.",
        "Holden: Okay, so what are you suggesting that we do?",
        "Dusty: You're her brother. Try to talk some sense into her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You say you want to be my wife, but why should I believe one word that you have to say to me when everything you have said to me lately has been a lie?",
        "Meg: Well, I'm being honest right now.",
        "Paul: You did everything you could to try and get me to think that you were sleeping with Dusty so that what, I would freak out, so that I'd go crazy, and then you could have Eliza all to yourself?",
        "Meg: Okay, look. Paul, we've both done a lot of damage to each other. But I honestly believe it's the best thing for Eliza I -- if both of her parents lived under the same roof. And if they were married, so much the better.",
        "Paul: Okay. So what does that mean to you, exactly?",
        "Meg: Well, we'd be raising Eliza together. Isn't that enough?",
        "Paul: Well, where does the marriage part fit in to all that?",
        "[Meg sighs]",
        "Meg: We could have a ceremony, if that's what you want.",
        "Paul: Great. After that, how married would we be?",
        "Meg: It depends how it goes.",
        "Paul: Meg --",
        "Meg: Look, I can't offer you any more than that right now!",
        "Paul: Well, it's not enough. Look, you want to be my wife again, it has to be real, in every sense of the word. You are all mine, body and soul, or you're nothing to me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Hi. Am I here early?",
        "Carly: No. No, you're right on time. Come on in. Lunch is just about ready.",
        "Lucy: It's really kind of you to invite me over. And really surprising.",
        "Carly: Well, I think we have something to celebrate, now that your legal troubles are over, huh?",
        "Lucy: I'll tell you when I have something to celebrate -- when my father finally forgives me. I don't suppose you could help me with that, could you?",
        "Carly: Uh, you know, I don't know. He -- he does have reason to be angry.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. So do you. My smuggling operation almost got you arrested. It affected your business.",
        "Carly: Now, just Craig's business now.",
        "Lucy: Still, it was an ordeal for everyone. And it was all my fault.",
        "Carly: Well, maybe we could try to move past it.",
        "Lucy: Well, I hope so. But I know that any kind of reconciliation with my father is going to take a long time.",
        "Carly: That's not necessarily true.",
        "[Timer rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, that's my timer. Uh, just excuse me for a second, okay?",
        "Lucy: Okay.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, would you get the door for me?",
        "Lucy: Sure. Hi, Daddy.",
        "Craig: Lucy, what are you doing here? Begging Carly to get me to forgive you? Because surely Carly isn't foolish enough to think that inviting us over here for lunch would be enough for that.",
        "Lucy: I imagine that's exactly what she thought.",
        "Craig: No. Carly knows exactly how I feel about you.",
        "Carly: Actually, it -- it was my idea. Lucy didn't know you'd be here.",
        "Craig: Well, if she's here, I'm going. We can have lunch another time, when it's just the two of us.",
        "Carly: No, no, no, Craig, come on, please. Don't go. Don't go until the two of you have worked this out.",
        "Craig: Is she paying you to be her mouthpiece or something?",
        "Carly: No, like I said, this was my idea. But let's let Lucy speak for herself.",
        "Lucy: Please, Daddy, at least hear me out.",
        "Craig: All right, fine. Say what you have to say. The sooner we get this over with, the better.",
        "Lucy: Okay. I know how much I hurt you by taking Johnny away when he was little.",
        "Craig: Aside from the years that I missed with him that I'll never get back, do you realize he still has nightmares from being on the run?",
        "Lucy: I know. I -- I thought I was doing what was best for him, but I was wrong.",
        "Craig: Well, if only your mistakes ended there.",
        "Lucy: I know. And I finally brought him back. I lied to you. I pretended that I wanted there to be peace between us. But I was still angry.",
        "Craig: Angry enough to use my company as a cover for your illegal activities?",
        "Lucy: You know I had nothing to do with those guns.",
        "Craig: I understand. You're just a drug smuggler. That's noble. How could you, Lucy? How could you leave me, and Carly for that matter, in jeopardy like that?",
        "Lucy: I guess I never thought that my operation would be discovered. But when it was, and the police started questioning you, that's when everything changed for me. I realized I didn't want you to suffer.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, you did let me suffer.",
        "Lucy: But not for long!",
        "Craig: No. Just long enough to stand by and watch me lose custody of my son.",
        "Lucy: I know. I'm sorry. When I saw how much that hurt you, I knew I had to come forward.",
        "Carly: You wouldn't have gotten Johnny back if it weren't for Lucy.",
        "Craig: I wouldn't have lost Johnny in the first place if it weren't for Lucy! Why would I give you the chance to do that to me again?",
        "Lucy: No, I swear, I will never come between you and Johnny again. I swear!",
        "Carly: Craig, can't you give her the benefit of the doubt?",
        "Craig: I could. Except she doesn't really care about me. She wants by buy time with Johnny.",
        "Lucy: No. I love Johnny, but you're my father, and I still love you. I never stopped loving you.",
        "Craig: That's easy to say now, but let me ask you something. What if Dusty had gotten permanent custody? What if your path to Johnny was clear? Something tells me you'd throw me overboard in a heartbeat.",
        "Lucy: No, I never would. Never again.",
        "Carly: She was willing to go to jail so you wouldn't be prosecuted, Craig.",
        "Craig: Sure. She just took her sweet time about it.",
        "Carly: I don't understand why you can't get past this! You're willing to negotiate visitation with Dusty, but you're gonna leave your own daughter out in the cold.",
        "Lucy: He gave Dusty visitation?",
        "Carly: Yes. I don't understand why he can't be equally as generous with you.",
        "Craig: I did what I did for Johnny, not for Dusty.",
        "Carly: Because you have it in you to be a good father! And if you can make a sacrifice for one of your children, why can't you make a sacrifice for the other?",
        "Craig: Because Johnny never broke my heart. I wish I could say the same for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Here you go.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Dusty, hi. Just the man I wanted to run in to.",
        "Dusty: If it's about the next board meeting, I'll e-mail you the agenda.",
        "Lucinda: No, it's not about business. It's personal. It's about Lucy.",
        "Dusty: I don't have time for that.",
        "Lucinda: No, please! Please make time. Lucy's in trouble.",
        "Dusty: I thought she just got out of trouble.",
        "Lucinda: Now, I don't mean that kind of legal trouble. She's in emotional trouble. Please, come.",
        "Lucinda: I'm -- I'm very worried about her.",
        "Dusty: Well, don't be. She's stronger than you think.",
        "Lucinda: Well, right now, she is desperate -- desperate for her father to forgive her. Now, I think that's one hell of a bad mistake, and I'm sure that you agree with me.",
        "Dusty: No comment.",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: I mean, I toss you a piece of red meat with Craig's name on it, and you don't snap it up? What's the matter? You okay?",
        "Dusty: No, I'm fine.",
        "Lucinda: All right. Well, Lucy is very vulnerable, and she needs someone to persuade her to forget about her father, the monster --",
        "Dusty: I'm not the right person for the job. I'm not. I don't want to deal with Craig anymore.",
        "Lucinda: Since when do you back away from a good fight?",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm trying to work out visitation rights with my son.",
        "[Lucinda gasps]",
        "Lucinda: Darling, are they expecting snow in hell?",
        "Dusty: As long as I can see my son.",
        "Lucinda: Look, I don't want to lose you as an ally, and I don't want Lucy to lose you, either.",
        "Dusty: Lucy wants to see my son happy. That's all I know.",
        "Lucinda: Your son, Johnny, is too little to know that his father is evil. Poor Lucy, she has delusions that father knows best. Come on! Do we want her -- do we want her to have her heart broken again?",
        "Dusty: If you think I have influence over Lucy's decision-making, you're wrong.",
        "Lucinda: No, of course you have influence! She respects you.",
        "Dusty: If she'd listened to me, Craig would be in jail, where he belongs.",
        "Lucinda: Na-uh. No. She took responsibility because that was her conscience. If she'd followed her heart, she would have sided with you because she still likes you.",
        "Dusty: I don't think so. That ended a long time ago.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, yeah? Really believe that? If you do, you're a blind fool.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Can you remember how great we were?",
        "Meg: Yeah, I do remember.",
        "Paul: Show me.",
        "Meg: Holden! Hey, uh, I wasn't expecting you.",
        "[Paul chuckles]",
        "Paul: I'm gonna wait for you upstairs.",
        "Meg: You should have called me. I would have met you somewhere.",
        "Holden: Looks like I got here just in time. Do you want to tell me what you're doing?",
        "Meg: You know what I'm doing. I am staying here so I could be with Eliza.",
        "Holden: What about Paul?",
        "Meg: Well, I -- I thought since I'm living here, we could give it a try, get closer.",
        "Holden: No, no, no. That's not gonna work out. There's no way. Paul is too dangerous.",
        "Meg: Not according to the judge, who gave him custody.",
        "Holden: That won't last forever.",
        "Meg: I don't have any more options, Holden. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.",
        "Holden: I'll tell you what you're supposed to do. You need to leave here right now, come stay with me and Lily. We will take care of you.",
        "Meg: And who's going to take care of Eliza? Paul? I am not leaving her with Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Please, Daddy, give me one more chance.",
        "Craig: No! No! I did that when you brought Johnny back, and look what it got me.",
        "Lucy: Thanks for trying, Carly, but my father's made up his mind, and no one's going to change it.",
        "Craig: At least we agree on that.",
        "Lucy: I should go.",
        "Carly: Oh, Lucy, wait.",
        "Lucy: No. I, uh -- I'm sorry. I just -- I can't do this.",
        "Carly: How can you be so cruel?",
        "Craig: Well, don't blame me. This is your fault. The next time I ask you not to do something, maybe you'll listen.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm quite sure there won't be a next time.",
        "Craig: Glad to hear it. Well, something smells good. What's for lunch?",
        "[Carly scoffs]",
        "Carly: We won't be having lunch, Craig.",
        "Craig: You invited me.",
        "Carly: And I -- I don't know why. I don't know why I thought that I could get you to open your heart.",
        "Craig: Listen, I appreciate the offer. I really do.",
        "Carly: You know, I thought I knew you. Of course. You lie and you cheat and you manipulate. That's a given. And, of course, you have no morals and an award-winning police record. I accept that. But you do have one redeeming quality, Craig.",
        "Craig: I'm waiting.",
        "Carly: You love your children. It's the best thing about you. So if you're gonna reject Lucy, if you're gonna throw her love away, I don't think I want anything to do with you. Please leave.",
        "Craig: Let me get something straight. Are you blackmailing me?",
        "Carly: You would think that.",
        "Craig: You just gave me an ultimatum. Either I forgive Lucy, or you withdraw your affections. Is that the deal?",
        "Carly: There is no deal. If -- if you're gonna be so heartless, I just don't want you here.",
        "Craig: There you go withholding again.",
        "Carly: You make it very hard for anyone to show you affection, Craig. Watch out that doesn't filter down to Johnny one day.",
        "Craig: Ohh. She hits below the belt.",
        "Carly: I'm just trying to get you to wise up. If you can't work things out with Lucy, how long before you have the same problems with Johnny?",
        "Craig: That won't happen.",
        "Carly: You want to bet?",
        "Craig: Oh, you know, you have so little faith in me.",
        "Carly: I wish I could believe in you. I wish I could get you to take a long, hard look at yourself.",
        "[Craig scoffs]",
        "Craig: Well, introspection is overrated.",
        "Carly: Not in this case. In fact, it's long overdue.",
        "Craig: Well, I guess I'm just not accustomed to having my own flesh and blood lie to me and use me.",
        "Carly: Children sometimes hurt their parents, Craig. It happens.",
        "Craig: Not like this. This is different.",
        "Carly: Because you won't let it go.",
        "Craig: Oh, believe me, I'm not dwelling on it. I have my hands full with Johnny.",
        "Carly: Right. And Johnny's a clean slate, right? You can start over with him. You can forget about all the mistakes you've made as a parent.",
        "Craig: I never said I was perfect.",
        "Carly: Do you know how much I'd love to start over with my children?",
        "Craig: Well, why attempt the impossible? Really, Carly, all I can do from now on is do my best.",
        "Carly: With Johnny. But to hell with Lucy. And what are you gonna say to him when Johnny asks you why you don't speak to his sister?",
        "Craig: I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.",
        "Carly: But by then, it may be too late. You can't erase Lucy, Craig. She'll always be there. She'll always be your daughter. She'll always need her father.",

        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Lucy: May I come in?",
        "Dusty: Please. What's up?",
        "Lucy: I heard my father made a deal for you to see Johnny.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Nobody saw that coming.",
        "Lucy: I'm happy for you. I really am. The only reason I took Johnny away in the first place was because you and my father couldn't stop fighting over him. But if you found a way to get along, then, God, that's the best thing that could happen to Johnny.",
        "Dusty: We'll see where it goes. I know you want to be a part of Johnny's life, too.",
        "Lucy: Yeah. I don't think that's in the cards for me right now.",
        "Dusty: Give it time.",
        "Lucy: I will, but -- but not at close range.",
        "Dusty: Now, what do you mean?",
        "Lucy: It's time for me to make some changes. If my father's not gonna forgive me for a long time, then why should I stick around?",
        "Dusty: Where are you gonna go?",
        "Lucy: Back to east Africa. They're desperate for doctors there. I can volunteer, do some good, for them and for myself.",
        "Dusty: Are you sure about this?",
        "Lucy: Yes, I am. Unless you give me a reason to stay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: If you stay here, you only weaken your case. Paul's lawyer will make him look like a saint for allowing you to move back in here after you lost custody. You need to play hardball, Meg.",
        "Meg: What do you mean?",
        "Holden: You need to go to court and tell them that Paul is unstable and that living here is untenable for you and for Eliza.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no. I have to do this my way. I can't be without Eliza, not even for a little while. I have to find a way to live here with Paul, okay? Please, please understand.",
        "Paul: Meg, you coming?",
        "Meg: Look, you should go. I'll be fine.",
        "Holden: No, you won't. You need to end this. You need to fight for your daughter. At least think about it.",
        "Paul: You know what? I'm not even gonna ask you what your brother said. Pretty sure I can guess.",
        "Meg: He doesn't understand why I'm choosing to stay here.",
        "Paul: We don't owe him an explanation, do we? As long as you and I understand what's going on, that's all that matters. Thought we could celebrate, you know? I, uh -- to us. You know what, Meg? I feel like your heart's just not in this.",
        "Meg: Well, give me a chance. I'm out of practice.",
        "Paul: Yeah, doubt that. You know, why don't you do for me what you did for him? Why don't you put on for me what you put on for him. Maybe that'll put you in the mood.",
        "Meg: How many times are you gonna make me say it? I did not have an affair with Dusty! I just bought those to make you suspicious!",
        "Paul: Right, right. Your pretend affair that never happened! You say you want to get married. Meg, are you gonna be my loving wife? You gonna go the extra mile for your husband?",
        "Meg: I can't make love to you and pretend that nothing has changed.",
        "Paul: Okay. Why not?",
        "Meg: Because it would be a lie.",
        "Paul: Right. So what do we do? 'Cause we got to start someplace, right? Unless you're still hung up on the one that got away.",
        "Meg: This isn't about Dusty! It's about you and me! We can't go back to the way it was, Paul!",
        "Paul: Then why are you talking about getting married? Meg -- why would you want to marry me unless there was a part of you that wanted to be all mine, body and soul?",
        "Meg: I -- I don't love you anymore, Paul. A -- and I can't go through the motions. I can't pretend to recapture what we had. I -- it's too difficult.",
        "Paul: Why would you even mention getting married then?",
        "Meg: I was wrong. I was wrong about that, and I was wrong to come and live here with you. I need to leave.",
        "Paul: If you think you're walking out of my house with my daughter, you are crazy!",
        "Meg: I know I can't take Eliza. She's gonna stay here for now. But I will go to court, and I will fight for custody, and I will win.",
        "Paul: The hell you will.",
        "Meg: I don't care how long it takes. I won't give up. But I will get Eliza back for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What are you asking me?",
        "Lucy: I'm not asking for a commitment or some kind of declaration. I just want to know if you think that there's a chance that we could build something together, in the future? If you thought there was a chance, then that would be enough reason for me to stay.",
        "Dusty: I care about you. I always will.",
        "Lucy: Oh. But not in that way?",
        "Dusty: I don't see it happening.",
        "Lucy: Okay, that's all I needed to know.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry.",
        "Lucy: No. Don't worry. You have nothing to worry about. I wanted an answer, and I got one.",
        "[Lucy laughs]",
        "Lucy: And now I have no reason to stay in Oakdale.",
        "Dusty: What about Johnny?",
        "Lucy: If my father won't let me see him, then it's gonna hurt too much to stay here.",
        "Dusty: He'll miss you.",
        "Lucy: I know. I miss him, too. He's very lucky to have you. Bye, Dusty.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Right, we're talking about Lucy.",
        "Craig: Yes.",
        "Carly: And all the terrible things she's done to you. But the terrible things you've done to her are off-limits, right?",
        "Craig: If this is the part where you tick off a litany of my crimes and misdemeanors, please don't bother.",
        "Carly: Let's just think back to all the times you've had to ask your loved ones to -- to give you another chance. And not just Lucy, but Bryant, and Sierra, and Margo, and Katie, and Rosanna. At one time or another, each and every one of them has had to forgive you for something terrible.",
        "Craig: That may be true, but --",
        "Carly: Well, how can you be so self-righteous, then? Be man enough to tell your daughter that you love her, to forgive her the way she's forgiven you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Lucy cries]",
        "Lucy: Hi, Grandmother. I need your help.",

        "Craig: What do you want me to say?",
        "Carly: Have I changed your mind?",
        "Craig: Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?",
        "Carly: Well, this isn't about me. It's about you and your daughter.",
        "Craig: Okay. You're right. If my daughter falls out of my life again because of my own stubbornness, I'll never forgive myself. Oh, don't look so smug. Come on. Hurry up. Let's go.",
        "Carly: To find Lucy?",
        "Craig: Just go before I change my mind.",
        "Carly: Okay, wait. You deserve that.",

        "Craig: James, do you know if my daughter is in a room upstairs?",
        "James: I'm sorry. Dr. Montgomery checked out this afternoon.",
        "Craig: She -- she what?",
        "Carly: Did she leave a forwarding address?",

        "Lucy: Yeah, yeah. My plane's leaving soon, but I just couldn't leave without saying goodbye to Johnny. Thank you. Sweetie, I'm gonna have to go away for just a little while. But I promise you that I will write to you, and I will send you pictures. Will you write to me? Send me drawings to put -- put them in my room?",
        "Johnny: Will you ever come back?",
        "Lucy: Oh, yeah. Of course I'm gonna come back. But I'll tell you what, in the meantime, I will set up a webcam to put on my laptop so that when we talk, we could see each other sometimes. And I'll tell you stories, and, um -- and I'll send you pictures of real lions. Would you like that?",
        "Johnny: I want to go with you.",
        "Johnny: Oh, baby, I know. Maybe someday, our dad will let you come and visit me when you're old enough. And I promise you that I'll come back to visit you. But you need to stay here right now. I love you. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.",
        "Johnny: I'll miss you, Lulu.",
        "Lucy: Oh, Baby, I'll miss you, too.",

        "Lucy: Come here. Okay. Listen, Doris is gonna take you back to school, and I want you to promise me that you will study hard so that you can be whatever you want to be when you grow up. And I love you. I love you. Go ahead.",

        "Lucy: Yeah. Yes, it is. And my plane is gonna leave soon, so I should really go.",
