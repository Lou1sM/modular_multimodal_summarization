        "Luke: All right, who wants the chocolate, chippiest pancakes ever to have been flipped?",
        "Natalie: I do!",

        "Faith: Sure. I'll have one.",
        "Luke: Great. All right, let's hear it for staff development day!",
        "Natalie: What is that?",
        "Faith: It's when the teachers have to take a class to learn more stuff to teach us.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but more importantly, is that school is only a half-day. The last half.",
        "Holden: Thanks for making breakfast, Luke. You really stepped up with your mom away.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, we all have to pitch in, right, girls? You know, I was thinking, that with Jack's crew hanging out here and all of us here at Grandma's house, we could -- we could make a sitcom. We could call it like, \"Pitching In.\"",
        "Lily: Well, I think you'd have to put that sitcom on hold because Mommy's home!",
        "Holden: Lily!",
        "Natalie: Mommy!",
        "Lily: Hi, Honey. Hi.",
        "Luke: I can't believe you're really here.",
        "Lily: Oh, hi, Baby. Hi. Hi.",

        "Susan: You've already started work. I always love when the three of us have coffee.",
        "Emily: I do, too. But I told you she stayed at a friend's house last night.",
        "Susan: Did she say who?",
        "Emily: Oh, yeah, you know, she told me. I don't -- I don't remember her name.",
        "Susan: Was it a friend from work?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I think so. I think -- look, you should be happy. Your daughter's making girlfriends. And that hasn't always been her best event.",
        "Susan: No. No, I'd just feel better if she slept in her own bed last night.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jesse: Keep my place warm, sexy. I'm going to see if I can score a bottle from the bar.",
        "Alison: Make it quick. I have a surprise for you and I know you're going to love it.",
        "Jesse: Keep your shirt on, or better yet, don't. I won't be long.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Isn't it beautiful outside?",
        "Will: Yeah, spectacular. It was a great idea to come study out here.",
        "Gwen: I just couldn't handle being in the library anymore. It's terrible.",
        "Will: I know. I think the fresh air is going to help with my panic attacks.",
        "Gwen: You really nervous about your Economics final? You're going to be fine. You've been studying like a lunatic. Besides, you recite formulas in your sleep. You think I'm lying? I snuggled up to you last night. You whispered numbers into my ear. It was incredible.",
        "Will: Oh, that's sexy.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, well, I'll quiz you later, huh?",
        "Will: Mmm.",
        "Emma: Hello. Hello, hello, hello.",
        "Gwen: Hey.",
        "Emma: Enjoying the sunshine?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, we're just studying for finals and stuff.",
        "Emma: Final exams. I knew there was a good reason for it.",
        "Gwen: For what?",
        "Emma: Sage just couldn't understand how you could forget about the summer plans. But I told her -- I told her you had a lot on your mind last night. But she was too upset --too upset to hear.",
        "Gwen: I haven't -- I haven't forgot about them though.",
        "Emma: Oh, she's okay now. She's all right now.",
        "Gwen: Well, was she really upset?",
        "Emma: Oh, she was inconsolable. But you know how kids are -- they just bounce right back. Listen, that was awfully nice of you to get her ice cream like that. It was very generous of you to take the time with all this studying that you have to do.",
        "Will: Yeah, Gwen and I have a lot of studying. That's why we were at the library all last night. What's this about ice cream?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Oh, she's here.",
        "J.J.: Who?",
        "Jack: Katie. Katie's going to have breakfast with us. She just pulled in the lot. I'm going to go tell her where we are.",
        "Parker: Okay. Great. Now we get to go on his dates with him.",
        "J.J.: Parker, Jack's not dating Katie.",
        "Parker: Oh, yeah?",
        "J.J.: She's just a friend.",
        "Parker: Right. That's why they were playing tonsil hockey last night.",
        "Sage: What's that?",
        "Parker: Hey, I'm just saying -- I know what I saw.",
        "Katie: Hi, everybody.",
        "Jack: Scoot over, Honey.",
        "Sage: Hi, Katie.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "J.J.: Is it true? Parker said he saw you two kissing last night?",
        "Sage: He didn't say that. He said they were playing hockey!",
        "J.J.: Well, is it true?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh!",
        "Cleo: Hi! I'm not in there.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I see that.",
        "Cleo: I'm an early bird. I pretty much always have been. So, you were looking for me?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yes, actually I was. After we talked last night, I was up for hours. I was wondering if you thought of a way for me to see Jack today.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Thanks, Emma. You blew my cover. I told Will I went to the library last night.",
        "Emma: I'm sorry. Well, I'm sure he'll forgive you for spending a few moments with your niece and your nephews.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, right? You will?",
        "Will: Yeah, of course.",
        "Gwen: Anyways, I'm really sorry that I upset Sage like that.",
        "Emma: Oh, listen, those things happen. I want to tell you, it was very nice of you to spend some time with them. You know, those kids, between you and me, can use as much family as they can get around them.",
        "Gwen: Well, maybe we can do it another time soon.",
        "Emma: Okay, great.",
        "Gwen: All right.",
        "Emma: Bye-bye.",
        "Gwen: Bye.",
        "Will: See ya.",
        "Emma: Good luck with the studying.",
        "Gwen: Thanks.",
        "Will: What was that about? You were at the library with me. You never left.",
        "Gwen: Exactly. But if she saw me eating ice cream with the kids --",
        "Will: Oh God, it's Cleo.",
        "Gwen: Obviously. And everybody thought that it was me.",
        "Will: She said she was going to leave.",
        "Gwen: Well, now we know that she's a liar.",
        "Will: And she's running around town impersonating you, to your family. Why didn't you tell Emma?",
        "Gwen: She's already concerned about Sage. I didn't want her to worry any more.",
        "Will: What -- this is out of control though. I mean, she's dressing up like you, and now, she's trying to live your life.",
        "Gwen: I know. But why would she go buy the kids ice cream? I don't understand that.",
        "Will: I don't know. Maybe she's planning something worse.",
        "Gwen: Hey, whoa, whoa. Who are you calling?",
        "Will: I'm calling the police. So, Emma doesn't find a boiling rabbit on her stove.",
        "Gwen: Wait a minute, don't do that just yet.",
        "Will: Why not? This is bizarre.",
        "Gwen: Because Will, we need to find out why she's doing this.",
        "Will: Let's let the cops find out.",
        "Gwen: Well, we'd find out a lot faster if I just went and talked to her.",
        "Will: Not necessarily. And I don't want you to take the chance.",
        "Gwen: Will, look, we've both talked to her. We know she's a little off. But she's not dangerous, okay? There's got to be a reason why she's impersonating me after she promised that she'd leave town. Let me go talk to her, see what I can find out. I don't get anything, we can go to the cops.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cleo: I'm really glad that you asked that. Because I've been up all morning doing research.",
        "Carly: What kind of research?",
        "Cleo: Well, I just started tracking down where Jack was. Anyways, the children's school starts late today, so he's having breakfast with them at Al's diner.",
        "Carly: You saw him?",
        "Cleo: Uh-huh.",
        "Carly: How does he look?",
        "Cleo: You could see for yourself.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. I don't know.",
        "Cleo: Why not? It worked with the kids. They didn't see you, and you got to see for yourself that they were okay.",
        "Carly: Well, that was at night. You know, this is broad daylight. I'm not supposed to be in town. Someone could recognize me.",
        "Cleo: Are you kidding? With everything that I have in this room? A good disguise is like one wig away!",
        "Carly: Yeah, Cleo, why do you have all this -- this costume stuff here?",
        "Cleo: What kind of girl doesn't like to play dress-up?",
        "Carly: Yeah, my Sage certainly used to. I would design these pretend ball gowns and we'd play for hours.",
        "Cleo: I bet you're a really good mom. Anyways, this would look really good on you. Wait -- you don't like it. I have a better idea. I bet this Jacket would look really nice on you.",
        "Carly: No, you know, I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Cleo: Come on. Don't be scared.",
        "Carly: Well, I'd be a fool not to be. I'm supposed to be thousands of miles away with a man who is wanted by every law enforcement agency from here to Sydney.",
        "Cleo: I actually understand that. One of my boyfriends used to steal cars. It used to drive me nuts because when we were in the car, he'd would never look at me. He'd just look in the rearview mirror to see if the police were coming --",
        "Carly: No, don't. You know what? Simon is not some car thief who I hooked up with. He happens to be a wonderful man.",
        "Cleo: Okay. Can I ask you a question?",
        "Carly: I guess so.",
        "Cleo: The police were really looking for you, right?",
        "Carly: Yeah.",
        "Cleo: And you got away with this amazing man, so what are you doing back in Oakdale?",
        "Carly: Well, you already know the answer to that. You took me to see them last night -- my children.",
        "Cleo: Really? Because I'm personally getting the feeling that it's more about your ex.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "J.J.: Well, did you kiss her or not?",
        "Jack: Uh, what's wrong with kissing? I happen to love kissing. See? I'm kissing Sage right now.",
        "J.J.: Parker says this is a date. Is it?",
        "Katie: A date? I don't know, Jack is it a date?",
        "Jack: I don't know. Let's take a little look around. Well, we got Al's diner and my three kids. Yeah, I smell romance in the air.",
        "Katie: The truth is your dad and I are just hanging out, having fun together. We don't really have to call it dating.",
        "Sage: Is my dad your boyfriend?",
        "Katie: Well, he's a boy and he's my friend.",
        "J.J.: We're not that stupid, you know.",
        "Katie: Yeah, I know. Okay, listen, the deal is your dad's just a really great guy and I don't think we have to label anything yet.",
        "Parker: So, you let every great guy who's a friend make out with you?",
        "Jack: Okay, Parker, now you're just being rude.",
        "Parker: I just asked a simple question.",
        "Jack: No, you got a problem with me. If you got a problem with me, be straight with me. Don't take it out on my friend --",
        "Parker: I didn't say I have a problem. Your wife left, you can do whatever you want.",
        "Waitress: Okay, kids. What's it going to be here, huh?",
        "J.J.: Um, I'm not that hungry anymore.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: It feels so good to have him in my arms again. Oh, I missed you so much buddy.",
        "Holden: He missed you, too. We all did.",
        "Lily: Why is everybody home from school?",
        "Luke: The whole school district has a half day. But weren't we supposed to pick you up at the clinic or something?",
        "Lily: That was the plan, but I got released a little early.",
        "Holden: Well, you should have called. We could have come to pick you up.",
        "Lily: And ruin my surprise?",
        "Holden: No, we love your surprise. We're just -- so surprised. You did finish the program, right?",
        "Lily: Yeah, absolutely. 100%. And I would have told you that when you picked me up, but then I got Natalie's Mother's day present. That was so beautiful.",
        "Natalie: Yay!",
        "Lily: I loved that picture of a little girl hugging her mommy. You know what? I was so excited, I had to come home and thank you in person. So, give me a big hug. This is the best Mother's day present in the world. Seeing you all together like this.",
        "Luke: But Natalie, I think we should head upstairs and get ready for school.",
        "Lily: Hey, look, I have to tell you something. I'm home, and I'm never going to leave again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jesse: I'm back, Baby. Now, what about this surprise you promised me.",
        "Alison: How about a little bump first?",
        "Jesse: No. I've been keeping you stoned all night. No more until you hook me up.",
        "Alison: You drive a hard bargain.",
        "Jesse: What is this? Home movies?",
        "Alison: Depends how you make yourself at home.",
        "Jesse: Whoa. Is that you?",
        "Alison: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jesse: Oh Baby, oh you are so hot!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Emily: Hello?",
        "Dusty: It's me. I was going to ask where you were, but I see you now.",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Susan: Oh, hi, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Morning. I just saw Alison.",
        "Emily: Oh, at the diner?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, the other day and she looks good. How is that working out for her?",
        "Susan: Well, it's not the greatest job in the world. She's a little bored. After all, she was managing that entire club before she left. I think she's going to find something much more challenging when she's settled in. Well, I'm sorry I can't stay longer. I'm seeing a patient in the hotel.",
        "Dusty: You make house calls?",
        "Susan: I don't mind. It keeps me connected, you know, to why I became a doctor in the first place.",
        "Dusty: That's why you're a beautiful woman.",
        "Susan: Bye, Sweetie.",
        "Emily: Bye, Mom.",
        "Susan: See you later. Excuse me, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Bye now. Why don't you want your mother to know?",
        "Emily: Alison didn't come home last night. I told my mother she slept over at a friend's, but the truth is, I don't know where the hell she is.",
        "Dusty: I do. She's inside.",
        "Emily: Did you see her?",
        "Dusty: I saw a guy coming out and I heard her voice.",
        "Emily: Well, are you sure it was her?",
        "Dusty: Yes. And I didn't want to bust in there without clearing it with you first. Did Lisa give you the key?",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah, I'm glad she didn't make a fuss about it.",
        "Dusty: She doesn't want any problems at her hotel.",
        "Emily: Right. You know, maybe we should -- maybe we should knock.",
        "Dusty: You think she's going to answer to us?",
        "Emily: Not a chance.",
        "Dusty: Rise and shine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I'm going to try and put him down, okay?",
        "Lily: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. He's ready for a nap. You haven't said anything, Faith.",
        "Faith: I don't know what to say.",
        "Lily: Can we just start with hi?",
        "Faith: Hi.",
        "Lily: Oh, I missed you so much.",
        "Faith: You did?",
        "Lily: Of course, I did. Of course. I loved your e-mails. But seeing your beautiful face, nothing compares to that. You are beautiful. You do know that, don't you?",
        "Faith: If I was beautiful, I'd be thin and pretty and I wouldn't be freaked out about food and you and Dad would have never had that fight.",
        "Lily: Okay, first of all -- first of all, thin does not equal beautiful. And second of all, your father and I were not fighting about you.",
        "Faith: But I heard you. You left because of me.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. Honey, I went into rehab because I was taking pills, and I was completely -- completely out of control. I was doing things that were bad for me and for our whole family.",
        "Faith: But if I hadn't been making myself sick --",
        "Lily: I still would have been taking the pills. But I am -- I'm so sorry if you thought that my problems were your fault. I owe you a huge apology.",
        "Faith: No, you don't. I told you, I don't think I'm the way I am because of you.",
        "Lily: No, I disagree with that. I think that the way I was acting was a huge effect on you. I thought I was -- I'm a terrible, terrible example.",
        "Faith: How?",
        "Lily: I was putting all this -- putting down on my myself about my weight. Made you think that was a grown-up thing to do. And then not eating, you thought that was okay too. Food was the enemy, you didn't want to eat, neither did I.",
        "Faith: But you didn't throw up like I did.",
        "Lily: And you didn't take diet pills. The both of us, were unhappy with the way that we looked and we tried to fix that with the diet pills were very bad -- very bad for me. Just like you making yourself sick was very unhealthy for you. I just didn't know how to stop.",
        "Faith: And now you do?",
        "Lily: I do. I'm not saying that it was easy. Because it's not. You know, what was even harder was learning to like myself again.",
        "Faith: I wish I could do that. I wish I could be normal and stop wanting to get rid of everything that I eat.",
        "Lily: Look, I'm not saying it's going to be easy for you either. But I can tell you one thing, it will be a lot easier if we do it together. As a family.",
        "Faith: I don't know.",
        "Lily: What? What is it?",
        "Faith: Before you left, you said that once everything was out in the open, things would get better, but they didn't. They just got worse.",
        "Lily: I know. And I'm so sorry, I thought that I could handle it. I thought I was ready, but I know now that I wasn't. But I realized I couldn't do it by myself. I needed a lot of support.",
        "Faith: And you got that in rehab?",
        "Lily: Yes. But the most important thing that I learned? Is that we all need help and we can't do it alone.",
        "Faith: Can you -- can you help me?",
        "Lily: If you let me.",
        "Faith: I want you to.",
        "Lily: Oh, Honey --",
        "Faith: Mom, I love you. I'm so glad you're home.",
        "Lily: Oh, I love you, too. Oh, I missed you so much.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why don't you bring one more plate of waffles, just in case?",
        "J.J.: No, it's okay, I don't want anything.",
        "Jack: Oh, come on, you might change your mind once you see them --",
        "J.J.: Stop --",
        "Katie: Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Don't worry about it. I got it. Here.",
        "J.J.: No, no -- stop trying to act like you're my mother!",
        "Jack: J.J., you're being out of line.",
        "Katie: It's okay.",
        "J.J.: No, no, no, why do you pretend like its okay for anyone just to move into our family? I don't need another mom, I already have one. And I'm not going to forget about her!",
        "Jack: J.J.! Come on -- J.J.!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, you don't have a problem getting personal, do you?",
        "Cleo: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cross the line -- it's just that you look like you could use a friend.",
        "Carly: Well, I'll admit it, it's been a long time since I've had one of those. I mean, of course, you know, I have my sister. But I don't want to involve her in all of this. It wouldn't be fair.",
        "Cleo: I could be a stand-in sister.",
        "Carly: Wow, well, thank you.",
        "Cleo: Okay, so what's the deal then? I mean, what's the real scoop?",
        "Carly: What scoop?",
        "Cleo: Well, about the diamond thief guy. Did he dump you or something?",
        "Carly: Oh, no. No, Simon was ready to start a whole new life with me.",
        "Cleo: But you didn't want to?",
        "Carly: No, I did, but -- you know, it's not always possible, starting over. You can't erase the past. And when you have a wonderful family, you can't just walk away and turn your back on them. It doesn't work.",
        "Cleo: I don't know about that. I think people can move on.",
        "Carly: But they remember. And I've got to think if I haven't forgotten everything, then neither have Jack and the kids.",
        "Cleo: So, you were sad when you went away?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, I tried not to show it, but Simon could see it.",
        "Cleo: Does he know that you came back here?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. Yeah, he's the one making it possible. That's why I said he's a wonderful guy. He promised me that he would figure out a way out of this mess.",
        "Cleo: How? By the way, this is too bright.",
        "Carly: You know, I don't know. He just told me to stay out of sight and wait until the time is right.",
        "Cleo: The time is right? What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Carly: I -- he said that I would know.",
        "Cleo: Well, it doesn't seem like you're doing a very good job of staying out of sight.",
        "Carly: I know -- I know, but I couldn't be this close and not see the kids. And of course, I have to see Jack.",
        "Cleo: But it's a big risk.",
        "Carly: It is. Because if Jack sees me before Simon has a chance to figure all of this out, then he'll make it so that I never see him or the kids again.",
        "Cleo: Well, then I'm your gal. I can make sure that you stay out of sight until you're good and ready. Ready? Okay. What do you think?",
        "Carly: Well, I think you're good, Cleo. No one will recognize me.",
        "[Knock on the door]",
        "Cleo: It's the manager. Go into the bathroom and stay there.",
        "Carly: No, no, no. I don't want miss seeing Jack.",
        "Cleo: No --",
        "Carly: I'll just run out. It's not a big deal.",
        "Cleo: Nobody can see you. Remember, the sooner I get rid of him, the sooner you can see Jack. So just stay in here.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Cleo: Quiet --",
        "Gwen: We've got to talk, Cleo. Can I come in?",
        "Cleo: Wow, Gwen! You're the last person that I expected to see at my door. This is -- this is really great.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I'll bet. You want to talk right here?",
        "Cleo: Oh, no, the room's really messy. The maid service here leaves a lot to be desired, if you know what I mean. Actually, you probably don't know what I mean. Because you probably stay in really nice places, like when you were out in Los Angeles. Anyways, I think the room is just going to gross you out.",
        "Gwen: Cleo, I don't care where we talk. We just -- we have to get a few things straight, okay?",
        "Cleo: Why? What happened?",
        "Gwen: You know what happened. You pretended to me to my nieces and nephews.",
        "Cleo: I just took them out for ice cream.",
        "Gwen: You took them out to ice cream as me, and you managed to get Sage really upset.",
        "Cleo: No, she wasn't upset at first, she was really happy when we went to go get ice cream and then I forgot this conversation that we'd had about the summer --",
        "Gwen: You couldn't remember the conversation, Cleo, because you never had the conversation. I'm the one who talked to Sage. It was me.",
        "Cleo: Emma's really nice, isn't she?",
        "Gwen: Yes, she's a real sweetheart, which is why taking advantage of her is really wrong. Cleo, this is not okay. It's sick. What's going on with you?",
        "Cleo: Nothing.",
        "Gwen: No? Then why are you acting like a psycho?",
        "Cleo: I'm not crazy. I swear, there's a perfectly good explanation for everything that I've done.",
        "Gwen: Well Cleo, I'm all ears. So, you can start talking.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hey J.J., hold on a second, wait. What is going on with you? After Carly left, I could always count on you being cool about everything. Parker acted out, not you. What changed? You used to get along with Katie.",
        "J.J.: Well, that was before I knew that Katie was gonna start moving in.",
        "Jack: It's not like that.",
        "J.J.: Then what is it like?",
        "Jack: She's a friend. We enjoy each other's company.",
        "J.J.: Wait, you're saying that she's not going to be your girlfriend? Ever?",
        "Jack: I have no idea. I don't know -- what, what -- something might change, but it might not.",
        "J.J.: Well, what about Mom?",
        "Jack: Your mom and I got divorced. Carly and I are divorced. And that happened long before she left. Even if she were here --",
        "J.J.: Well, I'm not going to forget about her, just because you have.",
        "Jack: No, I haven't forgotten. I haven't forgotten about -- you know what, you might not remember this, but you and Carly always didn't get along. Yeah, you thought that she, Carly, was trying to take your real mom's place. You even told her one time that you hated her. Then, you two started to get to know each other and little by little, things changed. And now, you consider Carly, for all intents and purposes, your mother. You remember that?",
        "J.J.: Yeah. But Carly's not dead.",
        "Jack: I know, I know. And Katie is not trying to audition to be your new mom or anything like that, all right? But you know something else? Change isn't always a bad thing. Sometimes it could be fun, and it's been a long time since we've had any kind of fun in our lives. Don't you think?",
        "J.J.: Well, we've been all right.",
        "Jack: Yeah, we've been getting along just fine, but having someone new around might ease things up a little.",
        "J.J.: Maybe for you. But not for me.",
        "Jack: How do you know unless you try? Think maybe you can give her a chance?",
        "Katie: You wanna go with the waitress? She'll show you all the different muffins, you can pick out whichever one you want.",

        "Parker: Isn't that what you want?",
        "Katie: I'm just trying to take things day by day. I'm really not applying for the step-mom job, okay?",
        "Parker: Good. Because we don't need another mom.",
        "Katie: Maybe so. But from where I sit? It looks like you could use another friend. Can I apply for that job?",

        "Holden: You say that like you're not sure.",
        "Lily: I guess being home I feel a bit fragile. At the clinic they said that that would happen. I'm home, but I'm still in recovery.",
        "Holden: I know that.",
        "Lily: I just don't want you to have too many expectations, because I have a month worth of therapy appointments and one of the doctors from the clinic spoke to Dr. Seidman about Faith.",
        "Holden: Well, that's good. I think she's coming along. And now that you're home, I think it's going to get even better.",
        "Lily: Yeah, we're all going to have to work together. You know that.",
        "Holden: Hey, I'm there.",
        "Lily: And it might mean some family counseling, you know.",

        "Alison: That's not true!",

        "Dusty: Do it.",

        "Gwen: That's not the point, Cleo! The point is, I didn't take the kids out for ice cream, I didn't forget my summer plans with Sage.",

        "Lily: It feels great to be home, but it is a little scary. You know, its one thing to make promises about how wonderful the future is going to be when you're tucked away in a rehab. To be home, it's a whole different world.",

        "Will: So are you saying she's put some other plan in motion?",
