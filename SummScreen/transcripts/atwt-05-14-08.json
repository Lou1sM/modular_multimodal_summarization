        "Jack: Faith and Natalie are on the bus with Sage. Parker and J.J. are on their bikes, racing to see which one gets there first.",
        "Carly: That's great. I think those kids all had a really nice time camping out in the backyard, huh?",
        "Jack: They did. Everyone seemed to get along, for once.",
        "Carly: And the two of us, for a little while.",
        "Jack: 'Til I figured out this whole sleepover was just a setup for Lily to spend so time alone with Holden.",
        "Carly: Oh, come on, Jack. They have been through so much. They deserve a chance to reconnect. That's all I was trying to do is help Lily!",
        "Jack: It's not your problem. You shouldn't do anything! Fixing their marriage isn't your job.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: You know something, Jack? That's not really what's bothering you.",
        "Jack: It's not?",
        "Carly: No. The truth is, you really enjoyed yourself last night. It was just like old times with Carly and the kids, and you just can't handle that, can you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You make me feel like I'm 17.",
        "Lily: Ooh! Make it sound like we're doing something illegal here.",
        "Holden: No. It was perfect. You're perfect.",
        "Lily: I know you wanted to wait, but I couldn't. It's been too long.",
        "Holden: Mm. I'll say. Every night that you were gone, I'd lie awake, thinking about you, missing you.",
        "Lily: Me, too. Feels like we're finally back on track. Just --",
        "Holden: What?",
        "Lily: I just don't want anything to ever come between us again.",
        "Holden: What could possibly come between us? There are no more secrets, right?",
        "Lily: Right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Alison: Chris?",
        "Chris: Hey! How's the star nursing student?",
        "Alison: Okay, I guess.",
        "Chris: All ready for your anatomy and physiology exam? Hope my tutoring gave you a bit of an edge.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was great. I'm psyched. But, really, thank you for helping me. I know how busy you are.",
        "Chris: Well, I -- I do have a full patient load today, but if you want to stop by the hospital for a last-minute review, I'll -- I'll adjust my schedule.",
        "Alison: No. I can't -- I can't ask you to do that.",
        "Chris: No, I don't mind, really. If you need me, I'm here.",
        "Alison: Thanks, but I think I'm all set for the exam. Seriously, I'm good.",
        "Chris: You sure? You're gonna ace this thing?",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah. You bet. Thanks for calling. Bye. Liar. You are so going to fail.",
        "Susan: Alison's under a lot of pressure at school right now. She doesn't need you adding to it.",
        "Chris: I've been tutoring Ali. That's all.",
        "Susan: I know. Emily told me. Ali hasn't been confiding in me since she started school, which makes me think that this nursing program is maybe too overwhelming for her.",
        "Chris: Well, it's challenging, definitely, but I wouldn't say it's overwhelming. In fact, you know, she's in great shape. This test she has today -- she's gonna knock it out of the park.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Brain stem, dienc -- dien-something. Okay, it's official. The four areas of my brain are not working. Okay. Cerebrum, brain stem, dien -- dien- something. I am so tired. Okay, just for a minute.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I fell back asleep, and when I opened my eyes, you were gone. What's all this?",
        "Holden: This is breakfast. I was gonna surprise you. Why did you get up?",
        "Lily: Mmm. I smelled bacon. This looks incredible. You really learned how to cook while I was gone, didn't you?",
        "Holden: And I would have proved it to you last night, but you insisted on introducing me to sushi.",
        "Lily: Mm. You liked it. Admit it. You liked it.",
        "Holden: Well, you know, it was, uh -- it was different. Definitely not my top ten list, though.",
        "Lily: I don't know if raw fish is an aphrodisiac, but it certainly did the trick for us.",
        "Holden: Let's be honest. It wasn't dinner that got us together. It was you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Did you hear what I said, Jack? Or don't you want to talk about it?",
        "Jack: Well, there's nothing to talk about, Carly. Being here under false pretenses reminds me of all the things I didn't want to be reminded of.",
        "Carly: Oh, I see. So, you're hurt because you thought you were here for one reason, and it turned out to be something else.",
        "Jack: Yep. The old bait and switch.",
        "Carly: I suppose that's similar to the night of Brad and Katie's engagement party when you came home with me, and we made love. And I was under the impression that it was a new beginning for us, but in reality, it was the end. And, yes, it does hurt when things don't work out like you expect.",
        "Jack: I thought we had gotten over this, Carly.",
        "Carly: Not remotely, Jack. Right after we slept together, you made it perfectly clear that you wanted nothing to do with me. And now, all of a sudden, you want to be a part of my life again.",
        "Jack: Wh --",
        "Carly: Dinners together with the children, barbecues in the backyard!",
        "Jack: No! I'm saying -- wait a minute! [Jack stammers] You asked me to stay here! How is that my fault?",
        "Carly: A few weeks ago, you were all about keeping your distance. Last night, you couldn't wait to stay over.",
        "Jack: On the couch.",
        "Carly: And you've been generously paying all of my household expenses.",
        "Jack: Well, I don't want my kids going to bed hungry. I guess that's just a funny thing about me.",
        "Carly: You've been volunteering to help me out at Metro.",
        "Jack: So you can get back on your feet financially.",
        "Carly: Is that the only reason? Tell me, Jack, why did it bother you so much that Holden was there, helping me at the club? He's been a very good friend to me. But I get this funny feeling that you don't want him around.",
        "Jack: So I'm jealous? Is that what you're saying? Is that what you're saying? Oh, that's a good one, Carly.",
        "Carly: I don't think it's funny. I think it's sad. You go on record saying we're over, its history, then you start working overtime to be involved in my life. Admit it, Jack. You have been sending me mixed signals, and I think it's time you stopped.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You sure you don't want to do this in bed?",
        "Lily: No! I want my husband to sit and have breakfast with me. After a perfect evening, we deserve a perfect breakfast.",
        "Holden: Well, like I said, you get all the credit.",
        "Lily: No, not for this. This looks unbelievable.",
        "Holden: No, us getting back together was all you.",
        "Lily: No, it wasn't.",
        "Holden: It wasn't planned. It just happened. But can we be honest?",
        "Lily: All right.",
        "Holden: I'm the one who's been dragging my feet. I just didn't want to rush into anything. I thought if we did, we might end up back in the same place, and I -- I didn't want to go there. I needed to make sure that things have really changed.",
        "Lily: Holden, I promise you, I have changed. You have my word.",
        "Holden: I believe you.",
        "Lily: I'm not sure I deserve that. But I hope last night means that you've started to forgive me for what I did with dusty.",
        "Holden: I'm getting there.",
        "Lily: I should have never slept with him. And I know it didn't make it better because it took me so long to get over him, but I am so sorry, and I just want to put all that behind us.",
        "Holden: I want that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Admit it, Jack. You have been sending me mixed signals.",
        "Jack: Can we stick to the subject? We are talking about how you helped Lily to set up Holden. But somehow you turned it into this accusation that I want to be a big part of your life again! Carly, the issue -- the issue is scheming to help Lily, it's not gonna work.",
        "Carly: I warned her that it might backfire, but at the end of the day, I was there for my friend! I'm sorry if you can't understand that!",
        "Jack: And I'm sorry that you can't understand that lying is never the way to go, especially in a marriage! And when Holden finds out, it's not gonna be pretty.",
        "Carly: Oh, I have heard this lecture way too many times, Jack! Why don't you just put a sock in it?!",
        "Jack: Whatever!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: No, I'll do that.",
        "Lily: No. No way. You cooked. I'll clean up.",
        "Holden: Listen.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: It's so quiet. It was amazing, wasn't it, last night and this morning -- just the two of us, alone?",
        "Lily: We lucked out, but it was exactly what we needed.",
        "Holden: I could really get used to this. But our kids -- they would miss us, so I'd better get over to Carly's and pick up Ethan.",
        "Lily: I'm sure Carly can watch Ethan a little bit longer.",
        "Holden: No, no. It's -- it's enough. Last night, six kids -- I need to go get him.",
        "Lily: But she had Jack to help her, and maybe it brought them closer.",
        "Holden: Eh, don't count on it.",
        "Lily: Oh, I just want Jack and Carly to have things work out the way things have worked out for us. They could just be as happy as we are.",
        "Holden: I don't think that's possible.",
        "Lily: Mm.",
        "Lucinda: Um -- oh. Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Um -- I'll come back later.",
        "Lily: No, Mother. It's -- its fine.",
        "Lucinda: But I just -- I brought all this stuff for the girls. That's all. I'll take my leave, and you two get back to doing whatever it was you were doing.",
        "Holden: You know what? Stay. I was just leaving. Keep Lily company. I'll see you in a bit.",
        "Lily: Bye, Honey.",
        "Lucinda: Hey. Is -- he winked at me! [Lucinda laughs] It's a miracle! How did it happen so fast?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Ali?",
        "Alison: Aaron, what are you doing here?",
        "Aaron: I was gonna ask you the same thing. I saw you in here, dead to the world. Figured you need a little caffeine fix. Here you go.",
        "Alison: Oh, you're a lifesaver.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, it was that or 911. You look like hell.",
        "Alison: Thanks a lot. Oh, God. Oh, God! Today's my anatomy and physiology exam.",
        "Aaron: What, did you pull an all-nighter?",
        "Alison: Yeah, but I got nowhere! I can't keep anything in my head! Oh!",
        "Aaron: Hey, hey, listen, listen, people always think that way before a test. Don't worry about it. You're gonna -- you're gonna do fine, you'll be great.",
        "Alison: No, Aaron, I won't. I'm gonna fail. And -- and then they're gonna kick me out of nursing school, and that's it! My life is over!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Chris, are you sure Ali's all right?",
        "Chris: She's fine.",
        "Susan: The last time I saw her, she seemed rather daunted by the amount of classwork. The nursing program here is no walk in the park. Brenda Manning is a real taskmaster.",
        "Chris: I'm sure she can handle whatever Brenda dishes out.",
        "Susan: Well, that's what she wants you to think. She -- Ali always acts tough. But like her sister, she can be fragile, and I'm -- I'm worried about her.",
        "Chris: I told you, I've been tutoring her. She's doing fine.",
        "Susan: Well, good, because the last time I offered to help her, she practically threw a fit.",
        "Chris: Don't take it personally. You know, I felt the same way when my dad would try to give me tips when I was in med school. Some point, you have to sink or swim without your parents showing up with a life jacket.",
        "Susan: All right. I -- I understand that. But Ali seemed really insecure about the A&P exam. But you're sure that -- that she's got it together?",
        "Chris: She's cool. Don't worry.",
        "Susan: Well, I'm her mother. Worrying is my job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I don't know my peripheral nerve from my posterior root!",
        "Aaron: Translation?",
        "Alison: From the neck up, I'm brain-dead.",
        "Aaron: No, come on. No, you're not. You've been studying for this 24/7. You probably know it backwards and forward.",
        "Alison: Well, I -- I mean, Chris has been helping me with the anatomy. I mean -- not like that. Not really. Okay, let's not go there.",
        "Aaron: Listen, if -- if Chris can help you out, that's great.",
        "Alison: No, it's not. I mean, he is way smarter than me. He's a doctor! And now he thinks I know my thorax from my clavicle, but I'm just -- I'm thick as brick!",
        "Aaron: No, you're not. You're smart. Come on.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, right. No, I'm hopeless. It -- I shouldn't even show up for the exam!",
        "Aaron: I think I know what you need.",
        "Alison: Coffee so I don't fall asleep five minutes into the exam?",
        "Aaron: No, you need to chill. So let's go somewhere.",
        "Alison: No -- where are we going?",
        "Aaron: You'll see. Come on.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Okay. Keep your eyes closed, okay? Take a deep breath. And relax. Better?",
        "Alison: Perfect.",
        "Aaron: Open your eyes.",
        "Alison: How did you know this was exactly what I needed?",
        "[They go on a motorcycle ride]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Hey, Guys!",
        "Carly: Hi!",
        "Holden: How's it going?",
        "Jack: Morning.",
        "Carly: Great. The kids are already at school. The big kids, anyway. Ethan's upstairs. He slept in.",
        "Holden: I hope the kids didn't keep you up last night.",
        "Carly: No, they were wonderful. And our kids had such a good time with them, didn't they, Jack?",
        "Jack: Yeah, they had a great time.",
        "Carly: And how about you? How was your time with Lily? Was it nice?",
        "Holden: Yeah, yeah. It was -- it was fine. How about you guys?",
        "Carly: It was nice.",
        "Holden: Okay with you, Jack, staying here?",
        "Jack: Not like I had a choice.",
        "Carly: Jack figured that I needed help, and he jumped in. Real lifesaver.",
        "Holden: Oh. Well, I'm glad the kids were good. Bet it was pretty noisy around here last night.",
        "Carly: It was. Bet it was quiet out at the farm.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Almost weird.",
        "Carly: But good, right? I mean, I'm sure it was nice to -- to be alone with Lily.",
        "Jack: I'm gonna go out back and put the tent away.",
        "Holden: You sure everything's okay around here?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Don't change the subject. I was talking about you and Lily, and how it was nice to be alone together.",
        "Holden: How did you know we were alone?",
        "Carly: She must have mentioned it.",
        "Holden: You talked to Lily about this?",
        "Carly: I just think that it's great. You two deserve some downtime.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Funny how that worked out.",
        "Carly: Well, it's a good thing though, right?",
        "Holden: I guess, as long as it wasn't a setup.",
        "Carly: Holden, I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Holden: Why do I get the feeling that you and Lily were in on this together? You know what? It makes a lot of sense. You agree to baby-sit. You ask Jack to help you out. And that leaves me and Lily at the farm, all alone together.",
        "Carly: That's just how it worked out.",
        "Holden: Really?",
        "Carly: Yeah, Holden, I swear, it's not what you think.",
        "Holden: I should have seen this one coming.",
        "Carly: No! You -- honestly, you are jumping to conclusions!",
        "Holden: And why shouldn't I? Jack, answer me this question. This was a setup, wasn't it? Lily and Carly -- they cooked up this scheme. Why am I not surprised?",
        "Jack: Sorry, Holden.",
        "Holden: You know what? It's not your fault. I should have known.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: It was a perfect evening.",
        "Lucinda: Oh --",
        "Lily: It's exactly what we needed.",
        "Lucinda: Honey -- oh! I am so glad. I am so glad. Ooh! What a relief. Although I got to say, that was some turnaround.",
        "Lily: Not really. Holden and I were bound to get back together eventually.",
        "Lucinda: Well, of course you were. But just as long as everything is open and aboveboard.",
        "Lily: Mother, why do you always have to think the worst of me?",
        "Lucinda: Well, Honey, I just want the euphoria to last. You know Holden. He's a stickler for honesty. That's what caused the estrangement in the first place. He thought he couldn't trust you anymore. I just want to make sure everything's on the up-and-up!",
        "Lily: Stop making a big deal out of this. Holden's happy. He loves me. He made me breakfast.",
        "Lucinda: Well, that's great, Honey, but omelet does not a rapprochement make. If the two of you are really going to start over together -- I don't mean to be preaching, but you've got to make sure that your proverbial slate is clean.",
        "Lily: Can you stop being so negative? Can you once just support what I'm doing?",
        "Lucinda: I don't want anything at all except for you to be happy, Darling. And I'm not preaching now. I'm begging you. I beg you, don't do anything that you'll regret.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Lily: Hey, Carly.",
        "Carly: Sorry, Lily. I'm afraid we have a problem.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Aaron: Your cell phone.",
        "Alison: What about it?",
        "Aaron: I'm turning it off.",
        "Alison: Okay. I don't think they're gonna work way out here anyway.",
        "Aaron: Well, I'm not taking any chances. You can't relax when you get text messages.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, I can't relax when I'm thinking about my exam, either.",
        "Aaron: Don't think about it.",
        "Alison: Chris really believes I can do this.",
        "Aaron: And don't think about Chris, either.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry. I know Chris is a sore subject for you.",
        "Aaron: I'm sorry -- sorry for giving you a hard time about him the other night. It's your business.",
        "Alison: No, it's okay. I decided not to dive into a relationship with Chris right now.",
        "Aaron: Really? What -- what changed your mind?",
        "Alison: A lot of things. You know, especially 'cause I'm so busy with schoolwork right now. So I've definitely decided to put the brakes on with Chris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Is it me, or is it more crazy than usual around here?",
        "Susan: Oh, definitely crazy, and the full moon isn't until next week.",
        "Chris: Can't wait.",
        "Susan: Oh, Chris, I hate to say this, but I think I need to thank you.",
        "Chris: For what?",
        "Susan: Tutoring Ali. It's way above and beyond.",
        "Chris: I'll do whatever I can to help.",
        "Susan: You and Ali seem to be the subject of a lot of conversations around here lately.",
        "Chris: So? Who pays attention to hospital gossip?",
        "Susan: If you're not a couple, what's to gossip about?",
        "Chris: Some people have nothing better to do. My advice -- don't lose sleep over it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I've been so stressed out about this exam, my brain is fried.",
        "Aaron: Okay, okay. Lie back and relax.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Aaron: Go ahead. Close your eyes. Okay. Now turn off all the static in your head. Just keep telling yourself it's gonna be okay. You'll get through this. Okay?",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Aaron: The brain stem, which continues down the spinal cord, has three distinct parts -- the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla. Consciousness is dependent on coordinating interaction between intact cerebral hemispheres. What?! No wonder you --",
        "[Alison falls asleep]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Brenda! How's the nursing program going?",
        "Brenda: Never a dull moment, but we have a bright group this year.",
        "Chris: Including Alison Stewart. She has her A&P exam today. Working really hard on the material. Tell me when you get her results.",
        "Brenda: I'm not sure there'll be any.",
        "Chris: What do you mean?",
        "Brenda: The test starts in five minutes, and no one's seen Alison. I can't say I'm surprised.",
        "[Chris calls Alison]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Chris: Alison, where are you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Aaron and Alison are sleeping]",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Don't say it. Don't you even think about saying it.",
        "Jack: I told you so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi, Honey. Hey, Sweetie! Mommy missed you! How's he doing?",
        "Holden: He's fine. Lucinda, could you take Ethan in the parlor, please? I need to speak to my wife.",
        "Lucinda: Absolutely. I'd love to take Ethan into the parlor. Let's go, honey. We're gonna play with your trucks! That will be a lot of fun! Okay, here we go. Fast, fast, fast.",
        "Lily: Holden, I'm so sorry. I can explain.",
        "Holden: Lily, how could you do this? I told you that we should wait, that we needed more time, but you wouldn't listen.",
        "Lily: Because there was something that we needed more than time. We needed to start acting like a couple again. We needed to stop thinking and talking and start feeling. And it was great, wasn't it?",
        "Holden: Yeah, it was great when I thought it was real.",
        "Lily: Of course it was real. How can you deny that?",
        "Holden: Yeah, but you couldn't let it happen in its own time, could you? You went behind my back. You got someone else involved. You had Carly help you get me into the sack!",
        "Lily: I made sure that we were alone for one night so that nature could take its course. What is so terrible about that?!",
        "Holden: You can't even admit that it's manipulation, can you?",
        "Lily: I took a shortcut! But can you honestly say that last night wasn't beautiful? I mean, you think it was wrong for us to spend the night in each other's arms and to wake up and to make love again?",
        "Holden: I told you that we needed to take time because we had a lot at stake here.",
        "Lily: But that's why last night was so important -- that it proved we can still make it.",
        "Holden: No. I don't think we can. Not this time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Why can't you just admit you know what you and Lily did was wrong?",
        "Carly: Oh, Jack, gee whiz. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that wanting Holden and Lily to be happy and be together is a crime. Do you -- you want to arrest me? Should I call a lawyer?",
        "Jack: This isn't a joke, Carly.",
        "Carly: No, it isn't. It's very serious. Last night could have been a turning point for two people that we care about. And not just for them, but for their children, for their whole family!",
        "Jack: And now I doubt that will happen.",
        "Carly: Go ahead and be all doom and gloom if you want to, but I intend to hope for the best, just like I dared to hope that you and I could stop fighting and start getting along! But obviously, that's not gonna happen, is it?",
        "Jack: I did. I had a good time with you and the kids last night. And that's what hurts even more -- realizing it wasn't what I thought it was. Don't worry. I won't let myself get fooled like that again. I'm going to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Ethan's playing with his truck. Didn't go well, hmm?",
        "Lily: I've ruined everything with Holden.",
        "Lucinda: No, I cannot believe that, Darling. There is something that you can do -- something to make things better with him.",
        "Lily: I don't see how. I want things to be better. I do. But at this point, I don't know how to make it better.",
        "Lucinda: You gotta try. Holden, Darling, you can say that this is none of my business, but I'd like to go on record here.",
        "Holden: Can I stop you?",
        "Lucinda: No!",
        "Holden: Good. Go ahead. I'm listening.",
        "Lucinda: Granted, Lily makes mistakes. Granted, she was not forthcoming. But she -- she's your wife, she's the mother of your children, and you know she loves the hell out of you.",
        "Lily: Mother, stop. I can fight my own battles.",
        "Holden: Lily, I don't want to fight with you anymore. Obviously, it does no good.",

        "Chris: Brenda, how's it going?",
        "Brenda: If you're gonna ask about Alison Stewart, don't bother.",
        "Chris: What do you mean?",
        "Brenda: She missed the exam. Alison never showed up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Aaron, wake up. What time is it? How long have I been asleep?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. I don't -- not -- I don't think it's too late. Why?",
        "Alison: Yes, it is! Oh, my God! I missed my exam! What am I gonna do?",
        "Alison: I am so sorry. I know I'm way too late, but is there any way possible I can please still take the exam?",
        "Brenda: No! You were told on your first day of class, no makeup tests. You miss the exam, you get a failing grade. There's nothing I can do.",
        "[Alison sobs]",
        "Aaron: Come on. I'll buy you a sandwich.",
        "Alison: I'm not hungry.",
        "Susan: Honey, what's wrong?",
        "Alison: Oh, Mom, you know, I don't -- I don't really want to talk about it, okay? You know what? Actually, I will take you up on that sandwich, okay? I gotta go. Bye.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Brenda, I need to talk to you about Alison Stewart.",

        "Aaron: It's my fault.",
        "Alison: No, it's not.",
        "Aaron: I never should have taken you out on my bike. I let you fall asleep.",
        "Alison: You were only trying to help.",
        "Aaron: I still should have been watching the time.",
        "Alison: It doesn't matter! Even if I had made it back for the exam, I would have failed anyway. I was so not ready.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Are you sure you can't cut Alison some slack?",
        "Brenda: I'm afraid not. Rules are rules.",
        "Chris: But it's not like she purposely bailed on the exam, and if she's willing to make it up.",
        "Brenda: It wouldn't be fair.",
        "Chris: Be honest. Haven't there been cases in the past where you've made exceptions? I thought so.",
        "Brenda: Why should I?",
        "Chris: Because that's what any reasonable person would do. Okay, if you need another reason, Alison's mother been a dedicated member of this staff for years, and I think the nursing program owes it to her.",
        "Brenda: I'm not sure Susan Stewart would want me to give her daughter special treatment.",
        "Chris: It wouldn't be special treatment. Come on, Brenda. Stop busting my chops here. Just give her a makeup test.",
        "Brenda: Do I have a choice?",
        "Chris: It will be our little secret. And you'll know you're doing the right thing.",
        "Brenda: I hope I don't regret it.",
        "Chris: You won't. Thanks, Brenda. You're the best.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Hughes is always doing favors for his girlfriend. I guess doctors can do anything they want around here, hmm?",
        "Brenda: That doesn't make it right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I don't feel well. I don't think I can eat.",
        "Aaron: That's 'cause your stomach's empty. You've had nothing but caffeine today.",
        "Alison: Well, the thought of a turkey club makes me sick to my stomach.",
        "Aaron: Well, you don't have a choice, okay? So pipe down.",
        "Chris: Ali, got a sec?",
        "Aaron: Hey, could you give her some space? She's kind of having a bad day today.",
        "Alison: It's all right, Aaron.",
        "Chris: Was it your fault she missed her exam?",
        "Aaron: No, I was actually doing her a favor. She was feeling really pressured, probably thanks to you.",
        "Chris: I'm the one that's helping her out, so why don't you just back off?",
        "Aaron: You know, maybe I won't, because maybe I know what's right for Alison right now.",
        "Alison: Stop it -- both of you, please!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Holden got into his truck, and he drove away. He was not carrying a suitcase, so I assume he's gonna be coming back.",
        "Lily: Thanks for the optimism.",
        "Lucinda: You two kids. You gotta do something about this fast.",
        "Lily: Obviously, if we could, we would.",
        "Lucinda: I can have another go at him.",
        "Lily: Thanks, Mother, but I made this mistake, and I gotta fix it. But it is not going to be easy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hey. Just wait, okay? Let's not do this. Lately, we -- we've confided in each other a lot. I've listened to you talk about Lily. I thought you really wanted to make things work.",
        "Holden: Not this way. Not by being tricked by my wife and her best friend.",
        "Carly: I -- I know you feel like you were set up.",
        "Holden: What would you call it, Carly?",
        "Carly: Maybe Lily and I went about it the wrong way, but in the end, Holden, everybody was happy. Can't you see that?",
        "Holden: You did the same thing with Jack. Didn't work out so well, did it? Didn't work out so well for Lily and me, either. Guess some people never learn.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: I got in a fight with Noah. I mean, I guess it's not a very big deal. We think we're over it by now and everything, but -- but he accused me of being jealous of him and Ameera.",
        "Holden: Is there a reason to be jealous?",
        "Luke: No. I mean, I know that the -- the wedding, the marriage is a sham and they're not really in love. I know all that, but -- I don't know. Sometimes it feels like -- like she takes up a lot of room in his life. And maybe -- in a way, maybe I am kind of jealous of just the way that he worries about her so much.",
        "Holden: That's part of what you admire about him, though, is that he would reach out to somebody and help them.",
        "Luke: No, I know. I do. I do admire that. I really do. But I feel like sometimes they have this whole secret life that I'm not a part of.",
        "Holden: Do you think they're keeping secrets from you?",
        "Luke: No, no. They're not keeping secrets. But it's just like -- well, for instance, the other day, I went over, and I walked in on Ameera, and she was -- she was on the phone. And she was talking to the prison, trying to get through to Colonel Mayer, you know? I asked her about it, and she totally stonewalled me. And then I tried to talk to Noah about it, and he acted like it wasn't a big deal, like it was something that he and Ameera can settle together and just -- I don't know. I just feel left out.",
        "Holden: Mm. Well, that's not good when people you're supposed to be able to trust decide to keep you in the dark.",
        "Luke: Yeah.",
        "Holden: You need to take a stand. You need to tell him what you want, and that you will not settle. It's the whole truth and nothing but, or else it's not worth it.",
        "Luke: Hmm. Well, do you maybe want to go do that for me?",
        "Holden: I can't. I've got enough on my plate. You're on your own.",

        "Alison: Aaron, I -- I really appreciate your help today. And you didn't make me miss my exam. I did that all on my own. But right now, I have to go work my shift at the hospital. So, do you think I could get a rain check with that sandwich?",
        "Aaron: Yeah, all right. Take care of yourself, okay? And, listen, if that pressure needle gets to that red zone and you need to unplug, call me.",
        "Alison: I will.",
        "Chris: I'm sure Alison will be fine. She can handle anything, and I'm gonna help her prove it.",

        "Brenda: So, Alison will be given a makeup exam.",
        "Susan: Brenda, I need to know. Are you doing this for my daughter because her last name is Stewart? Because I know Alison wouldn't want any special favors.",
        "Brenda: An exception was made, but not because of you, Susan. Alison has Chris Hughes to thank.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: Got good news for you, Alison. I convinced Brenda to give you a makeup test.",
        "Alison: No way. I can't believe it! How did you pull that off?!",
        "Chris: Brenda's made exceptions before and thought you deserved a break.",

        "Carly: I was in the neighborhood. I ran into Holden. I tried to apologize to him again.",
        "Jack: How'd he react?",
        "Carly: Not well. I don't blame him. I know that I need to mind my own business and just let -- let Lily and Holden work this out.",
        "Jack: I hope they can.",
        "Carly: I know. It's not easy. Look at us.",

        "Lily: Holden, when you made breakfast this morning, it was so sweet. I want things to go back to where they were then.",
        "Holden: You should try a new recipe -- one that doesn't include hiding the truth from me every chance you get.",
        "Lily: I thought it was best for us to get back together, no matter how we got there.",
        "Holden: Ends justify the means?",
        "Lily: I admitted I was wrong. I swear to you, I will do anything to prove myself to you again. I'll do whatever it takes, because if last night proved anything, it proves that we belong together.",
        "Holden: I used to think so, too.",
