        "Vienna: Oh, my God, I never thought I would say this, but I'm actually tired of shopping.",
        "Henry: What? When there are still so many stores with baby stuff in them? Come on! Bite your tongue, woman.",
        "Vienna: It's adorable to see how excited you are about all of this, but I barely saw any of the things, you were throwing them in the bag.",
        "Henry: All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, look, look. I have this cute little onesie.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God, \"Onesie.\" That's the cutest little word.",
        "Henry: Yeah, wait till you see it on our munchkin. That's gonna be cute. And I have this one that's got a deck of cards on it.",
        "Vienna: Are you teaching our baby to gamble already?",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Henry: No, Sweetheart. It says \"I have all the hearts.\"",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God. That is so cute. Oh, my God, this sweater is divine.",
        "Henry: And I've got a little hat in here. This has got a matching top and bottom.",
        "Vienna: Okay, let's stop.",
        "Henry: You've got to admit this is the height of baby couture!",
        "Vienna: It's enough.",
        "Henry: What? Hey. Hey, Katie.",
        "Vienna: Hey, Katie.",
        "Brad: Come on. Let's go.",
        "Henry: We're just getting some new outfits for the staff at Metro.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on, Henry. Knock it off. I saw the baby clothes. Don't lie to me again. It doesn't make me feel better.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well.",
        "Craig: Hi.",
        "Carly: If it isn't the most handsome guy I know. And his father.",
        "[Laughs]",
        "Carly: Hey, Sweetheart. You know, I made entirely too many chocolate chip cookies today? Would you please take a few off my hands for me? Thank you.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry to drop by like this. I picked him up from school, and he started asking about Lucy.",
        "Carly: Did you tell him she's gone?",
        "Craig: She told him she was taking a trip. But he keeps asking me when she's coming back.",
        "Carly: What did you say?",
        "Craig: What can I say? I say I'm not sure. But I'm sure that she'll write him a letter soon. The kid already knows what an evasion looks like when he sees one. Should have seen the look on his face.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig, that's tough.",
        "Craig: I just couldn't bear to take him back to the Lakeview, knowing that she's not there. And I really didn't want to go back there, knowing that she left town thinking that I'd never forgive her.",
        "Carly: Someday, she will know that you have forgiven her.",
        "Craig: You know, I've never been very good at looking forward to \"Someday.\"",
        "Carly: All right, well, then let's just concentrate on today, because you have an awful lot to feel good about.",
        "Craig: Such as?",
        "Carly: Such as the fact that you have been cleared of smuggling and murder charges. Such as the fact that you have called a truce with Dusty about Johnny. Such as the fact that you have custody of that little boy again.",
        "Craig: Now, that's significant.",
        "Carly: It's more than significant! It's worth a celebration! And you know something? I'm making a huge pot roast. Why don't we call your family and invite them over to have dinner with my family, huh?",
        "Craig: That sounds so -- normal.",
        "Carly: Yeah, well, normal is worth celebrating, too.",
        "Craig: You know, that doesn't crop up too much in my life. Let's do it. Bring on the pot roast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey, Parker.",
        "Parker: Hey.",
        "Liberty: Uh, haven't seen you at school lately.",
        "Parker: You were looking for me?",
        "Liberty: Let's not go through that again.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Yeah, right.",
        "Liberty: Um, I didn't see you around, and I got kind of worried, so I went to your baseball practice, and your coach said you hadn't been there all week. Are you sick or something?",
        "Parker: No. No, I just -- I didn't feel like going.",
        "Liberty: Doesn't sound like you.",
        "Parker: Stop it. Okay, you're not my mom. You don't care about what I do anymore, so just stop, okay?",
        "Liberty: You're wrong, Parker. I do care, and I always will.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi, Sweetie.",
        "Jack: Hey.",
        "Janet: Ugh. Did your work follow you home?",
        "Jack: No. The station's a madhouse. I couldn't hear myself think. And I had so much paperwork to do, so I brought it home.",
        "Janet: See, now? Even hotshot detectives have drudge work to go along with all the excitement.",
        "Jack: A lot more drudge work than excitement right now, Darling.",
        "Janet: Are you kidding me? You've been working on a big-time murder case. And an international gun-smuggling ring. I'd say that's way more exciting than working at Al's.",
        "Jack: I'd feel better if the case resulted in arresting Craig, but instead, I had to watch him walk out of the station a free man.",
        "Janet: Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that because he didn't commit a crime?",
        "Jack: Not those crimes, and not this time, but the guy's always hiding something, and it's almost always a felony.",
        "Janet: Sweetheart, I realize that you hate Craig. But he didn't do anything this time.",
        "Jack: Yeah, all right, maybe not this time. But he'll mess up soon enough, and when he does, I'll be right there waiting.",
        "Janet: All right, stop it, that's enough! Don't make me bring out the big guns!",
        "Jack: I like your big guns.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Jack: Come here. Mmm. No, no, you're right. There's no point in obsessing over Craig. What's done is done -- I can't change it.",
        "Janet: Till next time.",
        "Jack: You know me too well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Katie, I'm so sorry.",
        "Vienna: Katie, we never meant to upset you.",
        "Brad: We don't want any apologies, all right? We don't want anything from you. Not anymore. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Katie: Hello?",
        "Craig: Hello, Sunshine.",
        "Katie: What do you want, Craig?",
        "Brad: Is that your brother? No, give me the phone. He's the last person you need to speak with right now. Come on, Katie.",
        "Craig: Well, I've called to extend you an invitation. In view of the fact that I've been released from the Oakdale police station and I've got my son back, Carly has decided to create a wonderful dinner for my family and hers. And you happen to be one of my favorite members.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, I can't make it to dinner. I have to be at the studio. But congratulations. Especially about getting Johnny back.",
        "Brad: He had the nerve to invite you to dinner?",
        "Katie: He was happy, Brad. He's out of jail and he has his son back. He just wanted us to share in his happiness.",
        "Brad: Well, you did the right thing saying no.",
        "Katie: I'm just not ready to face everyone. Explain about the baby. That there is no baby.",
        "[Katie sighs]",
        "Brad: I know. I know. I mean, it's hard. You know, I have to admit that I'm not sorry about missing dinner with Craig. I mean, every day should be a Craig-free day, as far as I'm concerned. Why do you have to go to the studio?",
        "Katie: I don't know. Kim left me a message on my voice mail. She needed to see me.",
        "Brad: Well, I think it would be really healthy for you to throw yourself into work right now.",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Anything to make me stop feeling what I'm feeling.",
        "Brad: Come on. I'll walk you over there.",
        "Katie: No, you don't have to.",
        "Brad: Don't you know by now that I love you and that you are the center of my world, and as long as you're hurting like this, then I'm gonna be with you night and day, whether you like it or not?",
        "Katie: I like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Katie and the ox aren't coming.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Craig!",
        "Craig: Well, I would have been polite at dinner, but since he's not gonna be here, why restrain myself?",
        "Carly: Mm-hmm. And what about Margo?",
        "Craig: She's on board.",
        "Carly: Oh, good. Okay, well, Sage is at a sleepover, but Parker should be here soon, and I put some champagne in the fridge.",
        "Craig: I thought you weren't drinking, these days?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm not. I'm not gonna drink. But you do deserve to have a toast in your honor. You've come a long way.",
        "Craig: That almost sounds like a compliment.",
        "Carly: Well, you forgave Lucy. You're working things out with Dusty. You're really making some progress.",
        "Craig: Well, just think -- if you invited me to move in here, you could monitor my progress up close.",
        "Carly: Don't push your luck. Craig, could you help me out here, please?",
        "Craig: Sure. Oh, mushrooms, my favorite!",
        "Carly: No, I mean carrying the table, not lightening the tray.",
        "Craig: No problem.",
        "Carly: Craig.",
        "Craig: What is all this stuff, anyway?",
        "Carly: None of your business.",
        "Craig: As if that ever stopped me before.",
        "Carly: It's Parker's car insurance application. His temporary policy runs out any day, and I'm adding him to mine. But of course, he's been carrying around this paperwork in his backpack, never giving it to me.",
        "Craig: Insurance for a teenage boy. I don't envy that. That could bankrupt Warren Buffett.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Well, that's why he's paying for it himself.",
        "Craig: That makes sense. If he racks up points on his license, he'll have to pay the penalty. It's a good way to teach him responsibility. How is Parker, anyway?",
        "Carly: It's hard to tell, really. But I hope things will be a little more normal, now that he's going back to school.",
        "Craig: Well, no offense to Liberty, but high school is full of pretty girls. Once he takes a look around the halls, I think he'll get over her.",
        "Carly: I hope you're right.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Just because our marriage was annulled does not mean that I stopped caring about you.",
        "Parker: Great. And telling me that you didn't want to be married to me anymore was a great way of showing that you care.",
        "Liberty: I'm always gonna love you, Parker. Just not in the same way --",
        "Parker: I don't need your love.",
        "Liberty: Fine, fine, fine. Be mad at me, okay? But -- but just -- you need to just get on with your life.",
        "Parker: I am getting on with my life. And if it's not the way that you want me to, then tough.",
        "Liberty: You need to think about your future, Parker.",
        "Parker: I've heard it all before. You know that. It's pretty boring.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Well, here you go, Margo, one complete report.",
        "Margo: Thanks, Jack. I know this was a tough one for you -- case didn't turn out like you'd planned.",
        "Jack: Yeah, you got that right. I know Craig's your brother. And, okay, yeah, he was cleared on both counts. But he should have been in jail a long time ago.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know. Craig has made a lot of mistakes, and most of them criminal. And I've been as tough on him as anyone.",
        "Jack: I see a \"But\" coming here.",
        "Margo: But I've noticed a real change in him. He seems to be all about family, and it's not just lip service. He seems sincere.",
        "Jack: Key word there is \"seems.\"",
        "Margo: All right, all right. I've known him long enough to not trust him without verification, but this time, I think it's real.",
        "Jack: There is not a real bone in your brother's body.",
        "Margo: I think he's grown a few. And there's a really good reason -- Johnny. He wants to be a good father to that boy.",
        "Jack: I hope for Johnny's sake, he can pull it off.",
        "Margo: I think he can. A lot of the credit goes to Carly.",
        "Jack: You think Carly's giving him lessons on how to be a good parent?",
        "Margo: Believe it or not, I think they're a good influence on each other.",
        "Jack: No offense, Margo, but I've seen them together a lot more than you, and those two are a train wreck looking for a place to happen.",
        "Margo: Well, then I guess I will witness some of it tonight, because Craig has invited me over to Carly's for a family dinner.",
        "Jack: Craig's -- Craig's family now. Oh, I don't believe this.",
        "Margo: Come on. It doesn't mean anything.",
        "Jack: No, it means Carly's hell-bent on making my worst nightmare come true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Hi, Libby-Loo!",
        "Liberty: Hey.",
        "Janet: Hey, did you ace that geometry test?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, sure.",
        "Janet: What do you mean, \"Yeah, sure\"?",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Janet: Are you listening to me?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, no, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry. Ugh.",
        "Janet: No, you're not fine. What's going on?",
        "Liberty: Parker is ditching school, and I feel like it's my fault.",
        "Janet: Why? Are you hanging out with him again?",
        "Liberty: Mom, no. I'm like, little miss perfect attendance these days.",
        "Janet: Yeah, that's what I thought. So, listen, I know it's not a good thing that Parker's ditching school, but you can't blame yourself for that.",
        "Liberty: I know. I just thought he was coming around when his mom was in all that trouble and I was helping him get through it. But as soon as he had to accept that we weren't getting back together, he just froze me out again. He's ruining his life, Mom, and it's because of me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi. How was your day?",
        "Parker: It was okay.",
        "Craig: How was baseball practice? Did it end early or something?",
        "Parker: Uh, we just did some hitting and fielding today. No biggie.",
        "Craig: Did you knock one out of the park?",
        "Parker: Once or twice, yeah. And you know what, it actually really took it out of me, so I think I'm gonna go upstairs and chill out for a while, if that's okay.",
        "Carly: Yeah, okay. Well, I want you to know that Margo and Johnny are having supper with us.",
        "Parker: I'm not hungry.",
        "Carly: I'm making pot roast.",
        "Craig: Smells awfully good, doesn't it?",
        "Carly: Well, at least say hi to Johnny, all right? He's upstairs. He's playing video games.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: Ah.",
        "Margo: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hello.",
        "Margo: Here.",
        "Carly: Oh, thanks. Nice.",
        "Craig: Margo, always such a pleasure.",
        "Margo: Especially when it's outside of my police station, huh?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Margo: Okay. Well, thank you so much for inviting me, Carly.",
        "Carly: You're very welcome. Excuse me. I'm gonna put these in some water.",
        "Craig: So, what do you think, sis? Can we make it through one simple family gathering without resorting to handcuffs?",
        "Margo: Here's hoping.",
        "Craig: Here's hoping it's the first of many.",
        "Margo: Only time will tell, Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Feels like so long since I've been here. What's going on?",
        "Brad: Joe, what gives?",
        "Joe: It's for the reality show.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. With everything that's been happening, I forgot to tell Kim this wasn't happening anymore.",
        "Joe: We're supposed to get footage of Vienna, too.",
        "Katie: Well, I don't know where Vienna is, and I really don't care.",
        "Brad: Yeah, now is not a good time, Joe. Can you please stop shooting?",
        "Joe: Katie, I can't get a clear shot of your face.",
        "Katie: Yeah, 'cause I don't want you to.",
        "Brad: Joe, I'm trying to be nice here. Can you please stop shooting?",
        "Katie: What part of \"This is not happening\" don't you understand?",
        "Joe: But the deadline for the reality show --",
        "Katie: There is no reality show anymore because there's no baby anymore!",

        "Henry: Vienna, can I get some more cocktail napkins? I'm almost out over here. Earth to Vienna.",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Henry: Hey, cocktail napkins.",
        "Vienna: Oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Henry: Still thinking about Katie, huh?",
        "Vienna: The tears in her eyes when she saw us looking at the baby clothes -- I can't bear it.",
        "Henry: I know, I can't, either.",
        "Vienna: My heart goes out to her. If I knew that I couldn't get pregnant --",
        "Henry: I'm worried about her, okay? When did wanting to be a mother turn into some obsession?",
        "Vienna: No, wanting a baby is not an obsession. It's perfectly normal. And besides, it's our fault that she's in this position. I just -- I just wish there was something we could do.",
        "Henry: I know, Sweetie, I do, too. I'm afraid it's out of our hands now.",
        "Man: Pardon me for listening, but I think I can help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: It's gonna be okay.",
        "Katie: No, it's not. I don't know how I'm ever gonna get over this.",

        "Henry: You really handle private adoptions?",
        "Vienna: Okay, this client of yours who is looking for someone to adopt her baby, what is she like?",
        "Man: The mother's young and healthy. Dad's an Ivy Leaguer.",
        "Henry: This could be the answer.",

        "Carly: Craig, would you do the honors?",
        "Craig: I'd be delighted.",
        "Margo: Wow, champagne. How festive. At my house, we're lucky if we use utensils.",
        "Carly: Well, Craig's been through a lot. I thought he deserved a toast. And champagne is a lot more festive than cola, which is the only other drink I have in my house.",
        "Craig: Well, I think the first toast should go to Carly. Carly, I never would have gotten through these tough times if not for you. You believed in me when nobody else did. Present company included.",
        "Carly: Remember, we're celebrating. We're not judging.",

        "Margo: Oh, saved by the cell. Lucky me. Excuse me. Hughes.",
        "Brad: Hey, Margo, it's Brad. I'm at the studio, and Katie's in really bad shape, and I think you're the only person that can get through to her right now.",
        "Margo: Why? What happened?",
        "Brad: It's a really long story, and I don't want to get into it on the phone. Can you just -- can you come here now, please?",
        "Margo: Well, I'm having dinner with my brother.",
        "Brad: I forgot about that. Okay, look, don't say anything to Craig, because he's the last person that Katie needs butting in right now.",
        "Margo: I understand. I'll be right there. I'm sorry. Something's come up.",
        "Craig: It can't wait till after dinner? Cops have to eat, too.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, this cop's gonna eat on the run. Enjoy your lovely meal, and congratulations, Craig. And we'll take a rain check, okay? Sorry. Bye!",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "Craig: Bye. Hmm. Well, so much for the family dinner.",
        "Carly: Hey, now. Don't think you're gonna get out of celebrating that easily. We'll just have to drink this champagne ourselves, that's all. Cheers.",

        "Janet: Yes. I need you to meet me at Carly's.",

        "Carly: Well, I guess we'll have a little more bubbly while we wait. What shall we toast to this time?",

        "Carly: Yeah.",

        "Jack: Where?",
        "Parker: I don't know. Wherever.",
        "Jack: Parker, I checked the odometer of your car before I came in here. You've put 500 miles on it.",
        "Carly: 500 miles?! Where are you going?",
        "Parker: I told you, I don't know! I just drive around!",
        "Carly: Why are you doing this, Parker?",

        "Katie: You warned me. It's not like you didn't warn me. But I refused to listen to you. I should have never trusted Henry and Vienna. I was such a fool!",
        "Margo: No, you are not a fool.",
        "Katie: Just totally desperate.",

        "Katie: It's not that easy.",
        "Brad: We're on the list at the major agencies, and we still have to be screened, interviewed, approved.",
        "Katie: Even when we jump through all their hoops, there's no guarantees. It could take years, Margo, and even then, it's a lot of luck involved, and when it comes to me and babies, let's face it, I'm anything but lucky. I could wait forever for nothing, and I can't do it. I can't do this anymore!",

        "Margo: Because, Katie, you didn't have the perfect childhood, you know? You were so young when your dad -- when your dad died. And then, you know, you were on the road, on tour with Mama for all those years.",
        "Katie: It wasn't so bad.",
        "Margo: Yeah, but it wasn't what you wanted. It wasn't the two parents and the house, little picket fence, the backyard, the dog. Or rabbit. There's nothing wrong with wanting the family of your dreams. And it'll happen.",
        "Katie: You really think so?",
        "Margo: Yeah, when you least expect it -- boom! Look, Baby, what you got to do is you got to go home, you got to get some rest, and everything will be better in the morning.",

        "Craig: Having a car isn't what's keeping him from going to school.",
        "Jack: Maybe not, but it certainly makes skipping out a hell of a lot easier.",
        "Craig: He's acting out because he's angry, Jack, and that has as much to do with you as anyone.",
        "Carly: He does have a point. Instead of being so consumed with Craig and a phony smuggling charge, maybe if you had paid a little more attention to what Parker was going through, it would have helped.",
        "Jack: Well, I'm not the one that Parker lives with, am I? Maybe if you had stayed off the bottle like you promised, you would have noticed that our son wasn't going to school!",

        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Brad: You didn't change your mind about the baby again. I mean, if you think -- if you think you're gonna jerk Katie and I around again, I mean, you can get the hell out of here right now.",
        "Henry: Brad, no, no, of course not. Listen to me. Listen to me. I found a lawyer who specializes in private adoptions.",
        "Brad: But we're already on the list at all the top agencies.",
        "Henry: I know, but that takes a long time. He's got a pregnant client who is ready, willing, and able to give up her child now.",
        "Brad: Who is she?",
        "Henry: I don't know. I didn't get a name. But here's the lawyer's number. And he says it's everything you could want in a birth mother.",
        "Brad: Does he know anything about the father? Because there's no way that Katie and I can handle any more nasty surprises.",
        "Henry: He didn't go into details, but apparently the father graduated from Harvard.",
        "Brad: Harvard? Really?",
        "Henry: Brad, don't even worry about that. Nurture always trumps nature, yeah? All you have to do is give the kid a steady supply of sports and never let him near a book, and you'll be fine.",
        "Brad: Okay, well, how pregnant is she?",
        "Henry: Apparently she's ready to pop. That's why we need to move on this pretty fast. I mean, if Katie could get a baby, that'd be the best thing in the world for her right now.",
        "Henry: Yeah, that's why you should talk to her about it today.",
        "Brad: I don't know. I don't know.",

        "Craig: She is at that. I got to hand it to you, Jack, you've always had great taste in wives.",
        "Jack: Let's go.",
        "Carly: What are you gonna do?",
        "Jack: What needs to be done, Carly.",
        "Carly: What exactly does that mean?",
        "Jack: That if you can't get your act together, I'm gonna have to take over where Parker's concerned, and I'm not gonna let Craig throw piles of money at a kid who clearly can't handle it.",
        "Craig: That's not what I've done.",
        "Jack: Spin it any way you like, Craig. I really don't give a damn.",

        "Parker: You ratted me out! Is this just another great way of showing me how much you care?",
        "Liberty: I care, Parker. I was just so worried, and how was I supposed to know that my mom and your dad were gonna go rushing over to your house?",
        "Parker: Come on, you knew exactly what would happen the minute you told your mom that I was cutting class.",
        "Liberty: Hey, I just didn't want you to mess up your life, Parker! I didn't know what else to do! Are you okay?",
        "Parker: Well, I was fine, but not anymore. Thanks to you, everyone's on my back.",
        "Liberty: Because you're not fine. And the people who love you know it and want to help you, Parker. Ditching school doesn't solve anything. It just digs a deeper hole for you to fall into. And, Parker, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna let that happen.",

        "Brad: I know, I was suspicious, too, as I barely let Henry through the door. But then I started thinking. It's not like he and Vienna hired this guy. They met him by accident.",
        "Katie: And he just happens to handle private adoptions?",
        "Brad: He overheard them speaking, came up and introduced himself. He's got a client that's ready to give birth any second.",
        "Katie: Why does she want to give up the baby?",
        "Brad: I don't know. But as long as the baby's healthy and she's sure she wants to give it up, I mean, I just -- I don't think it really matters why.",

        "Carly: Nothing about this is funny.",
        "Craig: Then don't say things like that about yourself. You're one of the brightest, most loving mothers I've ever met. There's no way that you can predict the outcome of what your kid's gonna do, because kids lie.",
        "Carly: Is that supposed to make me feel better?",
        "Craig: No, it's supposed to make you get a grip on things. That's just the way life is. You can't control it.",
        "Carly: Well, Jack thinks I should.",
        "Craig: No, he doesn't. He may have been lashing out at you, but the person he had his sights set on was me. I hate to admit it, but this time, Jack Snyder was right.",
        "Carly: You really think Jack was justified in going after you like that?",
        "Craig: Well, the man's right. Once every millennium or so, he's right. You said it yourself, Carly. When I gave Parker that money, it was like I was rewarding his bad behavior. It was a mistake. And if you ever tell Jack that I admitted I was wrong, I'll deny it to my dying breath.",
        "[Carly chuckles]",
        "Craig: I may have said that Parker wasn't skipping school because of the car, but I know full well that having the car wasn't helping matters at all.",

        "Craig: I just wanted to give him a distraction after things fell apart with Liberty. It goes to show you, there is no quick fix when it comes to raising a child.",
