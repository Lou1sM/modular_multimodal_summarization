        "Alison tackled Barbara to the ground in the Lake View Lounge to keep her from seeing the fashion show designs. In all of the commotion, Hal came in and Barbara walked in and accused Carly of stealing all of her ideas. Rosanna believed Barbara's lie even though Carly denied stealing Barbara's ideas. Another patient died at Memorial. Chris questioned Dr. Bob about what happened because the lady was fine when Chris left the room. Chris confided in Dr. Decker the problems Bob has gone through recently with memory. Molly met with the Fed and told him that she would get the goods on Dusty. Meanwhile, Dusty was in his suite getting a check from Lily for the shop. Dusty signed the check over to one of his \"business associates\", but it wasn't enough money.

        "Molly: Hi. Listen, I just want to tell you I can't stay long. Because my cousin -- she's a fashion designer, and she has a really big show today. I need to be there.",
        "Brackett: Then let's not waste time. What have you learned about Dusty Donovan?",
        "Molly: He came to Oakdale with an agenda. Barbara Ryan, she hired him to split up her son and his fianc\u00e9e. And it worked. So he's not gonna be around long. Is this not the kind of information the FBI is after?",
        "Brackett: No, no, it's a start. How much did he get and where's he going?",
        "Molly: I don't know.",
        "Brackett: Can you find out?",
        "Molly: I'll do my best.",
        "Brackett: This creep got to you. Didn't he, Mrs. McKinnon?",
        "Molly: He was sleeping with me on the side while he was seducing another woman and getting paid for it. So, yeah, you can say I'm not happy about that.",
        "Brackett: Well, you stick with me. Together, we'll make sure he pays for what he's done. Hmm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Yes, I did call this morning. But -- all right. All right. Will you just please tell Spangler I gotta talk to him right away? [Knocking at door] who is it?",
        "McCann: Special delivery. I hear you've been trying to reach the big man.",
        "Dusty: Yeah. I'm having trouble raising the money. I want to talk to him face to face.",
        "McCann: It doesn't work that way, Donovan. We call the meetings, not you.",
        "[Knocking at door]",
        "Lily: Dusty? It's Lily.",
        "Dusty: Give me two minutes. Come here.",
        "McCann: Don't get cute.",
        "Dusty: Hey. Thanks for coming.",
        "Lily: Look, I only came here because I wanted to make something very clear to you. We're not friends anymore. When I said I want you away from my family, I mean it -- and me.",
        "Dusty: That's fine. I'm not trying to change your mind.",
        "Lily: Then what? Why did you ask me here?",
        "Dusty: I need you to do something for me. And if you agree, we'll never see each other again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hal: Look, I know that the temptation here is to worry. But it is entirely possible that Paul just changed his flight plan and landed someplace else.",
        "Rose: Yeah, you're right. It's a free country, especially when you're up there. But he's human, you know? And down here with some of the things that have happened to him, I just don't know if he was in the right state of mind to be at the controls of an airplane.",
        "Hal: No, no. Don't do that. Don't get ahead of yourself.",
        "Emily: Hey, can you guys talk some other time? I don't want you to miss Carly's big moment. Are you okay, Rose?",
        "Rose: Yeah. I'll be with Ms. Walsh if you hear anything, okay?",
        "Emily: Actually, I wanted to tell you something before you sat down. Alison overheard me talking to Carly about Barbara's kidnapping.",
        "Hal: Does that mean she knows of your involvement?",
        "Emily: No, I don't think so. I mean, thank goodness she didn't hear any details. But she's pressing me for information.",
        "Hal: And what did you tell her?",
        "Emily: Nothing. But you know Alison. She's taking it personally.",
        "Hal: All right, just don't let her get to you. The last thing we need is Alison to get involved in this mess.",
        "Emily: Don't I know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okay. Once again, I really want to thank you all for being here. It makes me so happy to be able to preview these clothes right here at home in Oakdale and in front of friends and some family. So, sit back and relax and prepare to be amazed as we unveil for you the premiere line of Monte Carlo.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I have to stop her, Jack. If Barbara walks into that fashion show, Carly will get hurt.",
        "Jack: -- By you, Craig. You're under arrest for assaulting Barbara. Not only that, I now have the evidence to book you for kidnapping her, too.",
        "Craig: Fine, fine, fine, fine. Arrest me in an hour. But, Jack, for Carly's sake, help me keep Barbara away from that show.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Help! I'm being attacked!",
        "Alison: Keep it down, will you? I'm not going to let you make trouble for my sister.",
        "Barbara: I'm not going to stand for this. I'm not gonna be mauled by some teenage delinquent.",
        "Alison: You're not going anywhere! Not till the fashion show's done!",
        "Hal: Alison, get off of her!",
        "Barbara: She's attacked me. Arrest her, Hal.",
        "Alison: No one's going to jail, especially my sister!",
        "Barbara: Would someone get her off of me!?",
        "Hal: Get off. Get her off.",
        "Alison: You don't want to mess with me! I stopped a murder all by myself!",
        "Barbara: Who ever let you out of jail, anyway, little girl?",
        "Craig: Barbara? Are you all right? I'll take you to the hospital.",
        "Barbara: Why? So you can kidnap me again?",
        "Craig: Hal, she's in shock. Let me take her.",
        "Jack: No, you're not going anywhere. You're staying right here.",
        "Barbara: Why is he here, anyway? Why isn't he behind bars or in handcuffs?",
        "Alison: Is there anyone you don't want to arrest, lady? What's your problem?",
        "Jack: Right there.",
        "Craig: Where are you going?",
        "Jack: I'm gonna go see Carly in the spotlight, Hal. Can you keep an eye on him, please? I'll be right back.",
        "Barbara: I'm going with you, Jack.",
        "Craig: You're not going anywhere.",
        "Barbara: Why are you so eager to keep me out of there, Craig?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Imagine a warm summer night -- a thousand stars sprinkled all around it. Picture that, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll be seeing the inspiration for my designs.",
        "Barbara: Wait a second. The stars and night? That's my idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gordo: It's a beautiful restaurant. They've got music on the weekends. We'll have a great time.",
        "Katie: Hold this for me?",
        "Gordo: How about a movie? Your choice.",
        "Katie: Paper clip.",
        "Gordo: You like bowling? I know these lanes where they've got it all -- big- screen TV, pool tables, margaritas, wall-to-wall rock 'n' roll with digital audio --",
        "Katie: Thank you for your help.",
        "Gordo: That's it? Don't I even get a \"I'd love to, but I have plans\"?",
        "Chris: The full-court press isn't working, Gordo. Time to take it somewhere else.",
        "Rick: It was very good, doctor. I wish all my interns had your persistence.",
        "Gordo: Thanks a lot. Guess she doesn't look at a guy unless he's wearing a tool belt and a hard hat.",
        "Katie: Gordo, you could have a cement mixer strapped to your head and I still wouldn't walk to the water machine with you.",
        "Chris: You're on your own.",
        "Gordo: Dr. Hughes.",
        "Bob: Mm-hmm?",
        "Gordo: Could you sign off on a protocol for me?",
        "Bob: Let me see the chart. Start the patient on diphenhydramine. And see how that works.",
        "Gordo: Dr. Hughes -- the patient has scleroderma.",
        "Bob: I'm aware of that.",
        "Gordo: Well, don't we usually go with dipyridamole for that?",
        "Bob: I gave you my opinion. Are you questioning me?",
        "Gordo: Sorry, sir.",
        "Rick: Diphenhydramine, dipyridamole. You know, it's funny -- just the other day, I got those mixed up myself.",
        "Gordo: Are you telling me Dr. Hughes intended to prescribe dipyridamole?",
        "Rick: Exactly. Excuse me, Bob, I wanted to go over that rotation schedule with you. You have a minute?",
        "Bob: Sure.",
        "Gordo: Did you see that? The old man is losing it, and his staff is covering for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: It's not complicated. It's not illegal or anything like that. I just want you to buy me out of my partnership in the Roller Palace.",
        "Lily: You want me to give you money? After what you did to Rose?",
        "Dusty: I know I was wrong, but I need the --",
        "Lily: Wrong? We went over this already. Rose -- this is beyond wrong. Rose and Paul were engaged, and you tried to break them up. And you succeeded. That's more than wrong.",
        "Dusty: All right, I'm not the nice guy I used to be. I'm trying to fix things.",
        "Lily: No, you know, it sounds like you want some money in your pocket before you leave town.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, that's part of it, but I'm still trying to fix things.",
        "Lily: You know what? Forget it. I don't know why I came here.",
        "Dusty: Wait a second, this is your sister's dream. You understand? It's her dream. And she'd rather give it up than have me involved or Barbara involved. You can prevent this from happening by investing your money. That's all I'm saying.",
        "Lily: No, because Rose never wanted me or Lucinda involved in the Roller Palace. Why would she feel differently now?",
        "Dusty: Because it's real to her. She's seen it with her own eyes. This is her dream. Now, help her hold onto it, please.",
        "Lily: You know Rose. She wouldn't want me waving my checkbook to make everything better.",
        "Dusty: She trusts you. That's real important to her right now. Especially right now.",
        "Lily: All right. How much?",
        "Dusty: I've got the partnership agreement right here. Where is it?",
        "Lily: Oh, boy. Let's see.",
        "Dusty: It's all good.",
        "Lily: Take money to get a woman to fall in love with you. Now you're taking money to make sure she never sees you again. This can't possibly be worth it, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I'm trying to do the right thing.",
        "Lily: No, you know, the right thing, that was over. When you disappointed everybody that cared about you. I hope that gives you a lot of sleepless nights.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Dusty: She's gone. I am endorsing this to Spangler. You see that?",
        "McCann: You're still short.",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna get the rest. I need a few days.",
        "McCann: You've had months. What's -- what's different now?",
        "[Dusty remembering]",
        "Dusty: Special Agent Del Brackett? Well, well, well. You're working with the feds. Everything's in place now. The money's there. I just gotta pry it loose.",
        "McCann: You got 48 hours. Make them count.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: This first creation can be worn to an intimate dinner, or that annual gala at the local country club. It incorporates our theme with style and grace.",
        "Hal: You should be at the hospital. Get out of here before I have to charge you with assault.",
        "Alison: I'm worried about Emily.",
        "Hal: I'll watch out for her. Go, go, go.",
        "Carly: This next gown features sparkles scattered generously over a simple, body-hugging, floor-length sweep of silky black crepe.",
        "Craig: Get out of the -- stay out of there, Barbara. The risk is too great.",
        "Barbara: The risk of what, Craig?",
        "Craig: Have you looked at a mirror recently?",
        "Barbara: No.",
        "Craig: Man, your eyes are all bloodshot. Your skin is bad. You could be seconds away from a grand mal seizure.",
        "Hal: You were told to stay put.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Highlighted by sparkles on the skirt --",
        "Barbara: Just hush up. I'm trying to listen.",
        "Carly: -- Wrapping around the hips and across the back. The sweep of sheer fabric over the right shoulder provides a look that is truly out of this world.",
        "[Applause]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: That's my design she's describing. That's my design in there.",
        "Hal: Making a scene's not gonna help.",
        "Barbara: Neither is staying here. Now, just get out of my way!",
        "Craig: Barbara --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: And now here's Amy -- -- wearing a heavenly creation that will turn any event into a night to remember.",
        "Jack: I thought you should know I'm arresting Craig for assaulting Barbara.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, well, I couldn't hope for better news. Make sure there's plenty of public embarrassment, would you? If he's gonna keep hitching his wagon to Carly's star, he deserves nothing less.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Well, there it is, ladies and gents, Monte Carlo's premiere fall line. It has been my pleasure to present it to you.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Emily: To Carly, her best collection ever. We love you, Carly.",
        "Hal: Barbara, stop. Stop.",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God.",
        "Kim: Listen, I don't know what's wrong, but at least wait until the press have left the scene.",
        "Barbara: Why should I do that?",
        "Kim: Because you've had enough bad publicity, for heaven's sakes. You don't need to be the whole story.",
        "Barbara: Would you just leave me alone?",
        "Kim: No, I won't.",
        "Barbara: A crime has been committed. I have been robbed, and I'm not going to stand here --",
        "Lucinda: A crime, you've been robbed? Oh, don't -- don't retaliate now. We couldn't bear it. It's too hard.",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Barbara: This look is all mine. It was stolen from me by Carly Tenney.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Yeah, well, I just wanted to tell you that seeing you the other day just made me think of all the good times we used to have together. And to top it off, you looked as gorgeous as ever.",
        "Molly: It was really nice seeing you, too.",
        "Dusty: Yeah? I say we do it again soon.",
        "Molly: You know, it's really funny you would say that, because I was just about to suggest the same thing.",
        "Dusty: My suite at the Lakeview?",
        "Molly: When do you want me?",
        "Dusty: As soon as you can get here.",
        "Molly: I won't waste a minute. Perfect. Whatever game you're playing, Dusty, I'm going to find out what it is.",
        "Dusty: Perfect. I need a big score, Molly girl. And you are about to be it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gordo: I'm not saying that Dr. Hughes's mind isn't what it used to be. But last week, he performed a colonoscopy on a water cooler. [Laughter] that was nothing. Yesterday, he told a cadaver that her chances for recovery were 50%.",
        "Katie: Knock it off, Gordo, you're not funny.",
        "Gordo: Maybe you should work on your sense of humor. Then there was the case of the mysterious 40 milligrams. Or was it 44? Or 444? Let's ask Mr. Crumly. Oops, I forgot. Mr. Crumly's dead. What's the matter? I thought I was on a roll.",
        "Chris: It must be me. You know, I could leave if you've got more material.",
        "Nurse: We'd better go to our meeting.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, Chris. I tried to stop him.",
        "Chris: It's not your fault.",
        "Katie: I've got to deliver some papers.",
        "Chris: Do you have any idea what my father has done for this hospital? No. You can only dream about it, Gordo, because you'll never come close.",
        "Gordo: Hey, you know me, Chris, I'm just fooling around. Nobody's gonna take me seriously.",
        "Chris: Bull. You were insinuating that the chief of staff had something to do with the death of a patient. My father was not responsible for Mr. Crumly's death.",
        "Gordo: It's about more than one isolated case. It's about people sticking their heads in the sand around here.",
        "Rick: You handled that very well, Chris.",
        "Chris: Rick, did you --",
        "Rick: Every word. Hey, Chris, listen, there's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's okay to worry and defend your father. Now, listen, if you -- if you want to talk to me about something, I'm here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Lady, you are out of your mind. Those dresses are my creation, not yours.",
        "Barbara: You no-talent slut. You've already committed every offense in the book, you might as well add plagiarism to the list.",
        "Rosanna: Now, wait a minute, Barbara. I know for a fact that Carly has been working on those designs for weeks.",
        "Barbara: Oh, yes, I'm sure she's been quite busy. You've seen concepts that are mine, the overall look, the detail. The coincidence is too close, Carly.",
        "Craig: Well, congratulations, Barbara. You've managed to turn another public event into a showcase for your deterioration.",
        "Hal: Back off, Craig. You're not even supposed to be here.",
        "Craig: This is my company. I have a right to defend it from slander.",
        "Barbara: Well, Craig, I do know why you didn't want me here. You knew that I would recognize this work as my own.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, Hal seems to be off duty. Are you gonna call somebody to get rid of her?",
        "Barbara: You and your little tramp have been working overtime, haven't you, Craig? You had me locked up, while she stole the best work of my life.",
        "Rose: Everything this woman says is a lie. Even your son knew that. That's why he got on a plane and got the heck out of dodge.",
        "Barbara: Your turn is coming, Rosie. And so is yours, Emily. I'll see the two of you and Henry Coleman in jail along with your spineless leader here.",
        "Craig: Accusations are easy, Barbara. It's proving them where you always seem to fall a little short.",
        "Barbara: Oh, I have proof, Craig. I just never realized it.",
        "Craig: All right. Well, here's a stage. Why don't you use it?",
        "Barbara: The proof is up in my suite. Hal, would you please come with me so I have a witness?",
        "Hal: I'll do anything to end this.",
        "Barbara: You stay right here. And everyone else, too. The fun and games is over. I'll see you all in jail by tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: I have something really important that I need --",
        "Dusty: No. What would a nice girl like you be doing working for the FBI?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Barbara's right. The whole concept for the line is hers.",
        "Carly: It's done, finished.",
        "Craig: It was a coincidence.",
        "Carly: I'm not taking credit for somebody else's ideas, especially when they come from Barbara Ryan.",
        "Craig: Forgive the interruption, ladies and gentlemen. And drink up while the champagne is still cold.",
        "Rosanna: Carly, I have to ask. Is there any truth in Barbara's accusation?",
        "Carly: Well, you saw what I went through to get those designs out. How could they possibly not be mine?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. Craig could have seen them before he had her kidnapped, and then he could have shown them to you and destroyed them.",
        "Craig: Rosanna, why are we even having this discussion?",
        "Jack: Carly doesn't have to steal from another designer. She has respect for the business. And she doesn't have to.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Craig: Yes. And this is Barbara. She couldn't find the scissors this time, so she tried something else. Hmm?",
        "Rosanna: She said she had proof.",
        "Craig: She's got nothing. Hal's probably up there trying to convince her to stay put.",
        "Rosanna: Are you certain about that?",
        "Craig: She's a madwoman. She is deluded.",
        "Barbara: You wanted proof! Here it is. I drew these from memory a few weeks ago. I wanted my son to see the work that had been stolen from me while I was kidnapped. So you take a look, Rosanna. And then you decide which one of us is lying.",
        "Rosanna: Barbara's right. The whole concept for the line is hers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Katie. How've you been?",
        "Katie: Alison. Hey, I heard you were working here.",
        "Alison: Today's my first day. Do I look okay? I got sort of messed up on my way over here.",
        "Katie: What do you mean messed up?",
        "Alison: I got into a fight with Barbara Ryan at the Lakeview.",
        "Katie: Are you kidding? You're not kidding. What happened?",
        "Alison: Well, she was about to make trouble for my sister. There was this fashion show going on in the dining room.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, I heard about that. My brother filled me in. Barbara didn't get inside, did she?",
        "Alison: I don't know. When I left, she was still in the lounge.",
        "Katie: Oh, good. If she saw those clothes, it would be a major mistake. But I'm not going to worry about that. My brother can fend for himself.",
        "Alison: Have you seen Chris? He was going to introduce me to the nurses' aides supervisor.",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, the infamous Mrs. Krebs. Come on, I'll introduce you.",
        "Alison: Um, Katie, no offense or anything, but I think I'd kind of rather wait for Chris.",
        "Katie: Okay. But I saw him earlier. He's not having a great day.",
        "Alison: Is he all right? Maybe I should page him.",
        "Katie: No. You know what? Let's take a little walk. I'll explain how everything works around here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: It's not easy for me to talk about this. You know, he's my father, and I love him a lot.",
        "Rick: Chris -- Chris, anything you say is not gonna go farther than the two of us.",
        "Chris: I'm worried about him, Rick. He just hasn't been as sharp as he usually is.",
        "Rick: Frankly, I got the same impression.",
        "Chris: How? What happened?",
        "Rick: Well, before you showed up at the nurses' station, I overheard Bob get confused about a medication. Now, he tried to cover, but it was obvious to me that he lost focus.",
        "Chris: He's just been putting in a ton of hours these last few months. Is there any chance it could just be fatigue?",
        "Rick: As opposed to Alzheimer's?",
        "Chris: I've been avoiding that word, even to myself.",
        "Rick: I'm sure you have. But the truth is, he may be suffering from one of many, many disorders that are far less serious.",
        "Chris: What do you think I should do?",
        "Rick: My opinion is, you should start testing right away.",
        "Chris: You know, I suggested that he get a checkup. And he promised he'd make an appointment. I just -- I don't think he's done it yet.",
        "Rick: Well, that makes sense. People -- people as capable as Bob are usually the last to seek help.",
        "Bob: Oh, Dr. Hughes? There's something in Mrs. Palmer's case I'd like you to observe. Dr. Decker, join us if you'd like. No pressure.",
        "Rick: Chris, stay in touch, huh? Now, if there's anything I can do to help you or your family, please let me know. And don't take this on yourself.",

        "Molly: Dusty?",
        "Molly: Yes, I'd like to speak to Agent Brackett. Okay. Well, can you at least leave him a message, because I have something really important that I need --",
        "Dusty: Now, what would a nice girl like you be doing working for the FBI?",
        "Molly: The FBI? Dusty, is that some kind of joke?",
        "Dusty: I really hope so. But I found Agent Del Brackett's card in your purse.",
        "Molly: Yeah. Because Del Brackett is somebody that I went to high school with. Dusty, he's an old friend. I ran into him downtown, and I was trying to set up lunch with him.",
        "Dusty: Beautiful. It sounds so nostalgic. But we both know you're lying to me.",
        "Molly: Okay. You're right. I am only here to get information on you.",
        "Dusty: Why would you want to do something like that?",
        "Molly: I didn't -- at first. But the FBI can be very persuasive. And then when I found out what you did to Paul and Rose, it made me sick. So you know what? I thought, \"what the hell?\"",
        "Dusty: What the hell, huh? I had my reasons for what I did. Reasons that I can't explain to you.",
        "Molly: You don't have to, because I know. Yeah, you were laundering money for some syndicate in Chicago. And the deal went sour. You owed a lot of money. Couldn't pay it back, so you sold your soul to Barbara Ryan.",
        "Dusty: That's pretty nice homework. But you don't know half of it. You don't know half of it.",
        "Molly: Careful. Are you sure you want to keep talking? Don't forget why I'm here.",
        "Dusty: You're here to listen to me. I owe a man in Chicago a lot of money. And he doesn't have a lot of patience.",
        "Molly: You have Barbara's money. Give him that.",
        "Dusty: Barbara stiffed me.",
        "Molly: She did? That's good. Good for her. You know what? That's probably the first positive thing she's done in years.",
        "Dusty: Gosh, I'm so glad you're amused. But this guy, Spangler, he doesn't have your sense of humor, sweetie.",
        "Molly: Spangler?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Charley Spangler. Used to be a friend of mine. Not anymore. And when he finds out the FBI's on my trail, he's gonna kill me for sure.",
        "Molly: No. That would be really stupid, because then he'd never see his money.",
        "Dusty: No, he's gonna make an example of me so the next guy doesn't feel like welshing.",
        "Molly: What are you gonna do?",
        "Dusty: I'm asking you for your help.",
        "Molly: Don't.",
        "Dusty: Hear me out. Just hear me out.",
        "Molly: What?",
        "Dusty: It's simple, baby. All I want you to do -- is tell the feds I'm not worth it. You give them no information -- no information. Keep them away from me, as far as you can.",
        "Molly: You got nerve. Which is part of your charm.",
        "Dusty: Will you do it?",
        "Molly: You have played me for a fool from the first minute we met. Why would I do anything to help you?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause I -- I took a look at my life, and I don't like what I see. And I kind of thought that you would know what that feels like.",
        "Molly: I do. But that doesn't mean it's my job to help you become a better person.",
        "Dusty: I also thought that maybe you would care about what happens to me.",
        "Molly: All right. I will tell Agent Brackett something.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",
        "Molly: No. I said that I would help you, nothing else.",
        "Molly: Hi, Agent Brackett, it's me. I need to see you right now.",

        "Chris: What's that?",
        "Alison: You not being here to welcome me to the hospital. I'm sure that you had a very good reason. And I'm willing to hear you out.",
        "Chris: Alison -- I'm sorry. It's been a really tough day.",
        "Alison: Is there anything I can do to help?",
        "Chris: I wish there were. So, what do you think of the job so far?",
        "Alison: I haven't done anything yet. Of course, my day was pretty exciting before I got here.",
        "Chris: Why is that?",
        "Alison: I got into a fight with Barbara Ryan.",
        "Chris: Alison, you're on probation.",
        "Alison: It wasn't my fault, I swear. She was asking for it, Chris.",
        "[Pager beeps]",
        "Chris: Okay, hold on. All right, you can tell me the rest later. But in the meantime, please, could you try to stay out of trouble just for a few hours? You'll end up back in jail again.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah, he wants me.",
        "Katie: Out of the way. Out of my way. My feet are killing me.",
        "Alison: What's wrong?",
        "Katie: It's these shoes.",
        "Mrs. Krebs: Mrs. Frasier, what are you doing?",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. But whoever invented these shoes needs to be shot or at least have to wear them for 24/7.",
        "Mrs. Krebs: Mrs. Palmer's due to have her blood pressure checked. Physician ordered it to be done every four hours. And for heaven sakes, wash your hands.",
        "Alison: Do you want me to do it?",
        "Katie: Yes. Second door on the right.",
        "Alison: Any special instructions?",

        "Alison: Hello, Mrs. Palmer. I need to take your vital signs. Is everything okay? Mrs. Palmer? Mrs. -- Help -- there's something really wrong with Mrs. Palmer. You need to get here right away. Mrs. Palmer? Mrs. Palmer? It's okay.",
        "Katie: Come on, Alison, you don't need to be in here. Let's go. Come on.",
        "Alison: You should've seen her, Katie. She was dying right in front of me.",

        "Barbara: Did you hear that, Carly? Your sister -- the money behind your company -- agrees that you stole my ideas.",
        "Carly: It isn't true, Rosanna. You know that. You know that I would never do that.",
        "Barbara: The show's over, folks! The designer's about to be arrested. You couldn't come up with anything on your own, could you? So you had Craig kidnap me and then you stole my designs. Well, you know what? You're not gonna get away with it, Carly. Come on, Hal, arrest them all.",
        "Kim: All right. All right, Barbara, you've had your say. It's time to leave.",
        "Barbara: You have no idea what they did to me, Kim. They kidnapped me. They locked me away in a cabin. They soaked me to the skin. They fed me through a doggie door. But the worst of all --",
        "Emily: You know, it's sad.",
        "Barbara: -- They stole my ideas!",
        "Emily: Her mind has finally snapped. You really ought to get help this time.",
        "Rose: Oh, you know, I think the damage is done, honey.",
        "Carly: I don't care what you drew or when you drew it. I didn't steal anything.",
        "Barbara: You've stolen men. You've stolen money. You have nothing of your own, so you had to take from everyone else. It's become a way of life for you, Carly. And it's gonna stop right here.",
        "Carly: I'm not gonna listen to this anymore.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: We need to talk about this.",
        "Bob: I agree. I cannot believe that her condition deteriorated that quickly.",

        "Spangler: Well, you should've been trying to pay me instead.",
        "Dusty: I know that. You're gonna have your money real soon.",

        "Dusty: Yeah. I'm getting away, as far as I can get, you know?",
        "Spangler: How do you plan on paying for it?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna pay you off first. And if my plan goes down the way I expect it to go down, we're gonna have a little money extra for a plane ticket. You understand what I'm talking about, Charley? But it's got to be like the old days where we work together. Work with me. You remember that?",
        "Spangler: Who's the pigeon?",
        "Dusty: A girl named Molly McKinnon.",

        "Brackett: How did that happen?",
        "Molly: He found your card in my purse.",
        "Brackett: Oh, and you just came clean, just like that?",
        "Molly: No, I denied it. But he's not buying it, and I don't want to do this anymore. You know what? He's not worth it. You should spend your time getting somebody else.",
        "Brackett: Are you on the level about this?",
        "Molly: Of course I am. Why would I lie?",
        "Brackett: Oh, I don't know. Maybe you and Dusty Donovan kissed and made up. Maybe you changed your mind about wanting him to pay for his crimes.",
        "Molly: Agent Brackett, you've just insulted me for the last time. Don't contact me again.",
        "Brackett: I'm sorry, Mrs. McKinnon, but the people in my business don't do things that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nancy: Sprayed you with water and fed you through a doggie door? Who would do that to you, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Well, you see Craig did that because he wanted to make Carly a star. He has a thing for her. He can't help himself.",
        "Rosanna: I believe this issue has been thoroughly explored. Nothing more will be accomplished today. Except for arresting my husband.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Is Barbara right? Did you really feed me her ideas?",
        "Craig: Whether it's the sky, the night, they're ideas. They don't belong to anybody.",
        "Carly: Will you tell me the truth?",
        "Craig: Carly, do you remember the shape you were in? I had to tell you something to inspire you, otherwise we would have been sunk before we even started.",
        "Carly: You ruined me, Craig. Don't you see that? Any chance that I had for success is gone. It's done, finished.",
        "Craig: Nobody has to know that. It was a coincidence.",
        "Carly: I'm not taking credit for somebody else's ideas, especially when they come from Barbara Ryan.",
        "Craig: Carly -- Carly, the designs are yours. The work is yours. Any resemblance to Barbara's sketches is coincidental. Huh? That's the story. We stick to that, we get out of this.",
        "Jack: So Barbara was right. You two were in this together.",
