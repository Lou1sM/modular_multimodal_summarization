        "Katie: Oh, mmm, well I don't have friends everywhere.",
        "Jack: Well, when we go out on a romantic date, instead of having dinner, we take a trip to the farm for some more Snyder family fun, or when for breakfast, you get a healthy does of bad attitude from my kids, you never lose your sense of humor.",
        "Katie: Do you know how easy it is to get a guy to buy you dinner?",
        "Jack: Well, when you look like you do, probably pretty easy.",
        "Katie: Do you know how hard it is to find a guy who actually takes care of other people?",
        "Jack: Yes, I am a totally wonderful human being. That said, have you noticed that, well, for lack of a better term, our relationship, has been rather public?",
        "Katie: Public?",
        "Jack: My main recollection of the first kiss was that one minute you were in my arms, the next there were about 40 people in the kitchen.",

        "Katie: At least they're more mature than Brad.",
        "Jack: Yes, but have you noticed something? There's almost nobody here. We're completely alone.",
        "Katie: You're right.",
        "Jack: And what are we doing? We're having coconut cream pie at a diner. That officially makes me an idiot.",
        "Katie: So what are you saying, we should go somewhere more private?",
        "Jack: Where we would be -- totally alone?",
        "Katie: I like the plan. You and me, alone. I wonder what would happen.",

        "Gwen: All right, thank you for checking.",
        "Margo: Look, I don't mean to pry, but you do seem pretty upset. So, is there something I can help you with?",
        "Will: Well, it's kind of official, but it's kind of not -- but it mainly concerns Jack.",

        "Margo: Mm-hmm. I'll put them off.",
        "Jack: No, it's okay. There's something I got to talk to you about, anyway. See you in a bit. Oh, you have every right to lose that sense of humor. This is asking way too much.",
        "Katie: It's okay. When you're -- can we say \"Dating,\" cause we just told your kids we weren't dating, didn't we?",
        "Jack: Yes, well it'd be true. Cause every time we try to date it never works.",
        "Katie: Right, okay. I'll go with that. So when you're trying to date a detective, you have to expect some interruptions. Actually, I'll walk over there with you, I want to talk to Margo.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it might not take too long. Really. Hold on a second. Nan, how late are you working tonight?",
        "Waitress #1: Oh, I'll be here 'til eight.",

        "Waitress #1: Right.",
        "Jack: Okay. All right. Thanks for the pie.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Jack: Ready? Why are you smiling?",
        "Katie: Well, I was just thinking -- if I have this much fun with you when things are going wrong -- imagine how much fun it will be when things go right?",
        "Jack: Well, it'll never happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: It sounded like someone fell in there. Is something wrong?",
        "Dusty: Why don't you take your mother to some tea, and I'll take care of Harry.",

        "Dusty: Scary Harry.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Something of a mean drunk.",
        "Susan: Sounds like he needs a doctor.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no. I don't want to get you guys involved. It could get ugly.",
        "Emily: Yeah, okay.",
        "Susan: Well, be careful.",
        "Emily: Oh yeah, he'll take care of everything.",
        "Susan: I'm sure he will.",

        "Dusty: Or what? You gonna call the cops?",
        "Alison: I hate you!",
        "Dusty: You're so strung out, you can't make a fist, and it's going to get worse. I'm gonna try to get you through it, but I'm in no mood for your crack- head attitude. Not a word of it. You got it?",
        "Alison: You're scaring me.",
        "Dusty: Well, that's good. Somebody should.",
        "[Door chain rattling]",
        "[Alison panting]",
        "Alison: What are you looking at?",
        "Dusty: Not much.",
        "Alison: This is fun for you, isn't it? Nothing you like better than being superior.",
        "Dusty: You're not leaving this room until you're totally straight.",
        "Alison: You know what? I'm not Emily. I don't need your help.",
        "Dusty: You need all the help you can get, Sweetheart.",
        "Alison: You sit there, passing judgment, like you're better than me. Well, you don't know anything about me. You don't know what it's like, and you don't know what I've been through.",
        "Dusty: I know that there are people in this world with real problems. So, when I look at you, someone who's been handed everything -- makes me sick, you know? Maybe its better you shut your mouth.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: It's nice that you found a way to pass the time, you and Dusty, while you were waiting for your source to sober up.",
        "Emily: You're enjoying this, aren't you?",
        "Susan: Yes, I am. I have something to needle you about, and you know how much fun that is for me.",
        "Emily: Oh, I know.",
        "Susan: Yeah. And I like Dusty. And it's a very nice, and rare feeling for me to be happy about the man that you're involved with.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. I think you're overstating the case.",
        "Susan: Am I?",
        "Emily: Mother, there's nothing going on. It's nothing.",
        "Susan: Didn't look like nothing. [Imitating Dusty] \"Oh, Susan. I didn't see you there.\" It was like you were two 17 year olds, and I caught you in the rec room.",
        "Emily: Will you stop already?",
        "Susan: I will, if you'll allow me one little maternal remark?",
        "Emily: Fine, keep it brief.",
        "Susan: I look you, and I see how well you're doing at work. And, how close you and Dusty have become. And, I'm not worried about you any more. You're all right, you're back.",
        "Emily: Well, I am. Thank you. And I owe a lot of that to you. And to Dusty.",
        "Susan: Don't shortchange yourself. And I have to hand it to Dusty, for forgiving and forgetting -- but you faced up to what you did, and you changed. And change is hard. Take it from me.",
        "Emily: I know. I know. I just don't want you making too much out of me and Dusty, okay? Really.",
        "Susan: You know me, I don't push.",
        "Emily: Mmm, never.",
        "Susan: So long engagement, short? It's not too late for a June wedding.",
        "Emily: Oh you -- would you believe it's Dusty? I've got to take this.",
        "Susan: I gotta go.",
        "Emily: Okay.",

        "Susan: I love you too.",
        "Emily: Hey, how's it going?",
        "Dusty: Pretty intense. Your mom still there?",
        "Emily: She just left. How's Ali?",
        "Alison: Tell her to get me something to freaking eat!",
        "Dusty: She's right on schedule, she's hungry for something sweet. Can you pick up some candy and cake?",
        "Alison: I'm starving here!",
        "Emily: I'll be right up.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Emily: Dusty? I can't -- I don't know how to thank you.",

        "Alison: I don't think I can make it through this.",
        "Dusty: Come on, let's take a walk. A little walk.",
        "Alison: I'm so cold.",
        "Dusty: I know. The food's gonna help.",
        "Alison: You know what'll help? If you just leave me alone.",
        "Dusty: That not going to happen. And there's nothing you can do about that.",

        "Katie: Great!",
        "Jack: No, J.J.'s got a soccer game.",
        "Katie: I'm there.",
        "Jack: No, Katie. Our first date is not, I repeat, is not going to be at a middle school soccer game. I have some standards.",
        "Katie: What if I wear a cocktail dress?",
        "Jack: A cocktail dress --. Oh, now I'm just getting depressed.",
        "Katie: I'm not.",
        "Jack: No, aw Katie -- why? Why? Yeah, because you've been sitting around pining for the life of a suburban mom.",
        "Katie: All right, in all seriousness, Jack, this is really sad. I've haven't had anything to look forward to in a really long time. So, we know we're going to get out time together. I'll just spend every minute looking forward to it.",
        "Jack: That's one way of looking at it.",
        "Katie: I like it.",
        "Jack: Yeah, like it's a good thing, instead of a thing that sucks.",
        "Katie: All right, Margo's not here, and you need to work, so I'm going to go. See you at the soccer game, and at that soccer game we will find some time to have a date.",
        "Jack: Yes. No. But it won't be a date. It won't be a date, because we are going to have a date, and it's gonna be special.",
        "Katie: I know it will. All our time together is special -- so far.",
        "Jack: Yes, come here.",

        "Cleo: Did you see Jack?",
        "Carly: From a distance. He was in the diner, I couldn't get too close.",
        "Cleo: Why not?",
        "Carly: The waitress saw me and pointed me out to him.",
        "Cleo: Well, did you at least get to see the kids?",
        "Carly: No. No, which is probably a good thing. Because if the waitress saw me, then they may have seen me and -- oh, this is such a mess.",
        "Cleo: Well, I mean, I know you didn't sleep very well last night. Did you eat anything today?",
        "Carly: No, Cleo. It's very nice of you to help me out, but I do not need a nurse, okay? I'm fine.",
        "Cleo: You're a liar.",
        "Carly: Well, that's how I do things.",
        "Cleo: So, what are you thinking?",
        "Carly: That it was pretty stupid to think things would change just because I saw Jack.",
        "Cleo: But you do want to speak to him, right?",
        "Carly: I want to know what he's thinking, but I think any conversation might be cut short when he sees me and slaps handcuffs on me.",
        "Cleo: You really think that's what he would do?",
        "Carly: Well, due to a long series of very self-destructive decisions, I haven't left him with much of a choice.",
        "Cleo: Well, I'm really sorry, Carly. I wish there was something I could do to help.",
        "Carly: That's why I'm here. I think there is.",
        "Cleo: How?",
        "Carly: Gwen and Jack happen to be good friends. I guess they bonded over having to deal with me.",
        "Cleo: But, you want me to --",
        "Carly: Yeah, and I promise, this would be the last time I would ever ask you. But look, Cleo, I need to know what Jack is thinking. And I think that he might tell Gwen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, are you reading her her rights, Detective Snyder?",
        "Katie: Margo. I actually came to see you.",
        "Margo: Oh, did you? Well, you probably couldn't see me, since Jack was right there. Gwen and Will are waiting for you in the interrogation room. Or maybe I should tell them it's going to be a minute?",
        "Jack: No. No. Hey, listen, there's been a report that someone's been dealing drugs at Al's. Nan's going to be there 'til 8:00, I told her we'd send over a sketch artist.",
        "Margo: Well, that's very efficient of you.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, seeing I'm here three hours before my shift starts, I'd say I was. Thank you for this morning. It was great.",
        "Katie: No problem.",
        "Jack: And for being so cool with the kids. Yeah. Chief.",
        "[Margo sighs]",
        "Katie: What was that all about?",
        "Margo: This is not a television station. We do not chat for a living. It was very unprofessional.",
        "Katie: It wasn't planned.",
        "Margo: Right, it seemed pretty spontaneous",
        "Katie: Let's get out of here.",
        "Margo: I'm working.",
        "Katie: That is why I came by at this time. This is when you usually take your lunch hour, and I want to talk to you and make sure you're okay about Casey, and how you're making it through. I'm sorry that I'm happy when you're not.",
        "Margo: You know what? I analyze you. Not the other way around.",
        "Katie: All right, come on. I'll make you a BLT.",
        "Margo: No, we'll pick it up from Al's. That way it'll taste good.",

        "Jack: I'm sorry, I'm not following you.",
        "Gwen: It's about last night.",
        "Jack: Yeah, last night you took Sage and the boys out for ice cream after the movies, that's when Sage got all upset at you.",
        "Gwen: Jack. That's just it. It wasn't me.",
        "Jack: What are you talking about?",
        "Gwen: Will? You want to tell him?",
        "Will: Last week, this kinda weird thing happened. I came home one night, and there's this girl there.",
        "Jack: She broke in?",
        "Will: She said she didn't have to, the door was open, but the point is, is she decided to make herself at home. She's wearing all of Gwen's clothes. She had a wig on like Gwen's hair. And then she tried to pass herself off to me as Gwen.",
        "Jack: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Will: I wish I were.",
        "Gwen: And that's what she was doing last night. I figured it out when I was talking to Emma this morning.",
        "Jack: Damn it. Yeah, this is Detective Snyder, I need to make sure that my kids are okay -- right now!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's too much to ask, isn't it?",
        "Cleo: Just tell me why you want me to do this.",
        "Carly: I did.",
        "Cleo: No, I mean exactly why. What is it that you need to know?",
        "Carly: Well, I need to know what Jack would do, if I tried to stay on here. And, you know, if there's any hope of me seeing my children.",
        "Cleo: And how am I supposed to ask him that?",
        "Carly: Well, you just -- you start by asking him about the kids --",
        "Cleo: But, if I say anything about you coming back, he's going to think that you talked to Gwen. And then I'm going to get Gwen in trouble.",
        "Carly: Right.",
        "Cleo: And the next time that they talk, they're going to know that something was wrong.",
        "Carly: Well, you're right. You're absolutely right. It just, you know, when it comes to my kids, I don't always think clearly.",
        "Cleo: I mean, helping you see your kids, that's one thing, Carly. But I mean, going to get Jack and trying to get personal information out of him --",
        "Carly: I know. Cleo, you know something, you're perfectly right. And I'm sorry. It was way out of line to ask.",
        "Cleo: Yeah. Anyways, I'll do it.",

        "Dusty: Your sister says you're good with words.",
        "Alison: Huh?",
        "Dusty: A woman who has sex to do drugs, to get out of jail -- what the perfect word for her?",
        "Alison: Resourceful. Wow, you really are the man of her dreams. Just what Emily's always wanted -- a nice, white knight who isn't interested in getting it on? She's always really loved lap dogs.",
        "Dusty: You're a charmer, you know that?",
        "Alison: I'm a lot of things. But I'm not an uptight, neurotic ice queen like my sister. And I think you're a lot more interested than you're letting on.",
        "Dusty: You want to put that back on?",
        "Alison: There have been a lot of men who've paid their hard-earned money to see what you're seeing for free.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, you got the shakes. Can't wait for the nausea. What a turn on.",
        "Alison: You know, you're not as smart as you think you are. I don't have to sleep with you to get what I want.",
        "Dusty: Oh, no?",
        "Alison: I just have to make a little deal. Like, you let me go -- and I don't let Emily find me naked in an unmade bed. You let me go -- and, I don't tell her I slept with you. You let me go, and she gets to keep her white knight image of you.",
        "Dusty: You'd do that to her?",
        "Alison: In a heartbeat.",
        "Dusty: You'd do that to yourself?",
        "Alison: Put me down! Get your damned hands off of me! What are you doing?",

        "Jack: And no one, I mean no one, picks them up except for me or my aunt, Emma Snyder, okay? Thank you very much. Ed, do me another favor, make sure they don't know about this. They've been through enough already. Thanks.",
        "Gwen: You really think she'd take the kids?",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, I'm going to take that chance. Like you did.",
        "Will: Huh?",
        "Jack: Huh? You find a strange woman in your living room dressed as your wife, and you don't think that's big deal.",
        "Will: I felt sorry for her. And I thought it was a really pathetic thing to do, so --",
        "Jack: Yeah, there are a lot of pathetic people out there, Will. And a lot of them need help before they try do harm to other people.",
        "Gwen: Jack, she's didn't seem violent. I mean, when I told her off this morning, she got really upset.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's great, so she knows that you know that she did this. Yeah, you wouldn't want me to have the element of surprise on my side when I go to track her down.",
        "Gwen: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute. Hold on one second. Why are you so mad at us? I mean, we came to you as soon as we found out what she did --",
        "Jack: No, you didn't! You let her go so she could ratchet up to the next level of crazy.",
        "Gwen: She didn't seem crazy, Jack.",
        "Jack: Why, Gwen? Because she was dressed up as you instead of -- who, Napoleon?",
        "Gwen: You know what, all I'm trying to say is that I think there is a reason behind this. I think she wants something.",
        "Jack: Like my kids! I'm sorry. I am. I've -- it's been a pretty rough time. Okay? And Sage was a mess last night, when she thought had let her down. That's why she was on edge. That's why I'm on edge. I didn't mean to take it out on you. And I am sorry.",
        "Will: I get it, you know. I thought I was trying to scare her off, and maybe I just let her loose.",
        "Jack: Yeah, no. All right. That's behind us. Do you her name? Do you know where she might be from? Where she might be?",
        "Will: It's Cleo Babbitt. I think she's from California. And she's staying at the Wagon Wheel.",
        "Jack: Okay, next time you see her guys, don't look at her, don't talk to her, just call me.",
        "Will: Jack. The truth is -- hey, I'm sorry, all right. But I thought when I scared her off the first time, she wasn't going to be stupid enough to try it again.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well I'm not going to give her that chance.",

        "Carly: I now I'm repeating myself, but you really are the strangest person I've ever met.",
        "Cleo: Yeah, everybody says that.",
        "Carly: You just made a very convincing argument about why this is a stupid and dangerous idea. And then you agree to do it. And Cleo, I -- I owe you. So if there's ever anything that you need --",
        "Cleo: Right now, I pretty much need you to be quiet.",
        "Carly: What -- what is it? What are you -- you gonna to listen to music?",
        "Cleo: To Gwen. I listen to her sing -- and she just flows into me.",

        "Katie: All right, just rewind a little bit. I thought you were happy about me and Jack, you were the one that said I should go for it.",
        "Margo: No, no, I never said that. I can't stand when people say go for it.",
        "Katie: Whatever, okay, you said we seemed happy.",
        "Margo: Katie, it was one kiss! And now you're talking dealing with his kids' schedules, and you're going to soccer games.",
        "Katie: His kids are the most important part of his life.",
        "Margo: Yeah, I know -- I know, I'm the one who has kids here. I know how hard this is for Jack. I know what he's going through. And you come along, and you're like a breath of fresh air.",
        "Katie: So what's wrong with that?",
        "Margo: You, Katie. You're going about ninety miles an hour.",

        "Alison: I know I'm beautiful.",
        "Dusty: No, you don't. People who do what you do don't think they're beautiful.",
        "Alison: I'm a star.",
        "Dusty: You're lucky you're not in jail. Your sister's gonna be here soon. Dry off. Put on that robe. And stop breaking her heart every chance you get.",

        "Katie: Really? I guess it just slipped my mind.",
        "Margo: Yeah, with Jack, it's going to be different, because it's not just Jack, it's his kids too, and they're vulnerable. And I know this, because I'm going through it right now, that with children, the fallout is sometimes down the road. Now, Parker is already in therapy --",

        "Katie: Okay. I get your point. He has his kids depending on him, and I need to be responsible and think for the both of us.",
        "Margo: Yeah. That's all I'm asking, is that you think about this. You really think about this one.",
