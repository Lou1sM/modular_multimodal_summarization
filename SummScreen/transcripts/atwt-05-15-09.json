        "Damian: I just spoke to Luke and Noah. My fleet has been cleared to sail again, so I told them if they still wanted to put together a cruise for the foundation to just say the word, and they did.",
        "Lily: That's wonderful!",
        "Damian: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Wow. They must be so excited.",
        "Damian: They are, they are. It was nice to be able to give them some good news for a change.",
        "Lily: What about the plans for the children's program at the dude ranch?",
        "Damian: It's still an option for later in the summer.",
        "Lily: You've done so much for them already. If there's anything that I can do, I mean, just let me know.",
        "Damian: Actually, there is. You can come with us.",
        "Lily: Where?",
        "Damian: On the cruise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Oh, there she is! Hello, Eliza.",
        "Paul: What are you doing here? What are you doing here?",
        "Barbara: You've gotten so big. I came by to see my granddaughter. Is that all right?",
        "Paul: What do you want?",
        "Barbara: Good morning to you, too, Paul.",
        "Paul: You could have called first.",
        "Barbara: Why?",
        "Paul: Because that's what polite people do.",
        "Barbara: Am I intruding?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Okay. Let's take this from the top, all right? Good morning, Paul! Would it be all right if Eliza came outside with her nana for a walk, or do you and Meg have plans today?",
        "Paul: Meg's not here.",
        "Barbara: When is she coming back?",
        "Paul: Meg's not here because she's gone, and if I believe everything she said, she's not coming back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Thank you for coming with me to see Bonnie. It really helped me out. Just in case I forgot something.",
        "Holden: That's what big brothers are for. And for the record, you did fine. You did fine on your own.",
        "Meg: Really? I thought I was all over the place.",
        "Holden: No, no, not at all. You gave Bonnie all the facts -- everything that she needs to use against Paul when you go to court.",
        "Meg: I hope so.",
        "Holden: I know it was tough to have to relive all that stuff. Just remember why you're doing this.",
        "Meg: For Eliza.",
        "Holden: That's right. To bring her back where she belongs.",
        "Meg: I just wish it was all over.",
        "Holden: Well, Bonnie said it's gonna take some time to prove that Paul set you up to look like an unfit mother, but once she does, the judge will have no choice but to restore custody.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: How much time are we talking about? I need my daughter, Holden. You don't know what it's been like to wake up and not have her there.",
        "Holden: No, I know it hurts.",
        "Meg: I just want to be with her so badly.",
        "Holden: You can't be. Not now.",
        "Meg: So, how am I supposed to stay away?",
        "Holden: You have to. She's with Paul now. If you even step foot in that house, everything that you have done will have been for nothing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Did you hear what I said?",
        "Carly: Yeah, I heard you, Jack. You don't have to raise your voice.",
        "Jack: I didn't. I'm just -- I'm just frustrated that I'm stuck here. I wanted to be the one to tell him.",
        "Carly: Well, don't worry about it. I can handle it.",
        "Jack: So, you're clear on everything, what you have to tell him? Because he's not gonna take this well.",
        "Carly: I said I can handle it. He's up. I got to go.",
        "Jack: Let me know how it goes.",
        "Carly: Good morning. Can I get you a glass?",
        "Parker: Don't worry about it.",
        "Carly: Parker, we need to talk, Honey.",
        "Parker: Okay, fine. I promise, I will use a glass next time.",
        "Carly: No, no, it's not about that. It's about your car.",
        "Parker: What about it?",
        "Carly: I need for you to give me the keys.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Carly: Your father and I have talked about it.",
        "Parker: Wait. You talked about what?",
        "Carly: Until you can shape up around here and your grades improve, and you can get to school on a regular basis --",
        "Parker: What, on a bus?",
        "Carly: Yes, Parker, on a bus. I'm sorry, but your driving privileges have been suspended.",
        "Parker: No, no, you can't do this. It's my car. I bought it.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. You bought it?",
        "Parker: Yes, with my own money, which means that you can't just take it away from me.",
        "Carly: I'm not negotiating with you, Parker. Give me the keys now!",
        "Parker: No. I'm not giving you the keys, and you can't make me.",
        "Carly: Parker! Hey! I'm talking to you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You know, this cup of coffee should be on the house.",
        "Janet: Why? Did you do something special I don't know about?",
        "Craig: Something extraordinary.",
        "Janet: I'm almost afraid to ask.",
        "Craig: But you should.",
        "Janet: All right, fine. What did you do?",
        "Craig: I agreed with your husband.",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. Turns out Jack was right. I was wrong to give that money to Parker from his trust fund.",
        "Janet: Get out!",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm. I never should have let him try to buy himself some happiness. I can see that now.",
        "Janet: Well, good for you.",
        "Craig: You don't really mean that, do you?",
        "Janet: No, not really.",
        "Craig: I don't get any points at all?",
        "Janet: It's a little late for your insight, Craig, because that flashy little sports car has made it, what was it? 50,000 times harder for Jack to try and help Parker get on with his life.",
        "Craig: Such a pessimist, Mrs. Snyder. You know, sometimes these things have a way of working out on their own.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: He left, Jack. What should I do now?",
        "Jack: Well, what did he say when you asked for his keys?",
        "Carly: He said, \"You can't make me!\"",
        "Jack: Do you know what I would have done if he had said that to me?",
        "Carly: Well, he didn't. You weren't here. He said it to me.",
        "Jack: Okay, sit tight. I'll find someone to cover for me, and I'll be right there.",
        "Carly: Okay.",
        "Parker: Where is it?",
        "Carly: Where is what?",
        "Parker: My car.",
        "Carly: In the driveway?",
        "Parker: No. No, it's not out there. So you're gonna tell me what you did with it -- now.",
        "Carly: I thought your car was in the driveway.",
        "Parker: You know it's not. Where is it?",
        "Carly: I don't know.",
        "Parker: You're lying. You didn't want me to have it, so you got it towed, didn't you? You had no right to do that!",
        "Carly: Parker, listen to me. I did not take your car.",
        "Parker: I don't believe you.",
        "Carly: Why would I have asked for your keys if I had taken your car? That wouldn't make any sense, would it?",
        "Parker: Okay, fine. Then if you didn't, then Dad did.",
        "Carly: No, he wouldn't do something like that.",
        "Parker: Yes, he would! He's a total control freak!",
        "Carly: Well, I've been talking to your father about this, and he didn't say anything about taking your car!",
        "Parker: Yeah, right, like he'd tell you.",
        "Jack: Great. You're here. Give me the keys, and tell me where your car is.",
        "Parker: Wait, you don't know where it is, either?",
        "Jack: Why would I know that?",
        "Carly: It's not outside.",
        "Jack: You don't know where your car is?",
        "Parker: If I did, I wouldn't be here right now.",
        "Jack: Watch the way you talk to me.",
        "Parker: Well, it didn't just disappear, Dad!",
        "Jack: It would if it's been stolen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Thanks. Okay, you just sit there and wish for things to happen. See how far that gets you.",
        "Craig: I wish for another cup of coffee.",
        "Janet: You're not gonna think it's so funny when it happens to your kid.",
        "Craig: What does Johnny have to do with this?",
        "Janet: You don't think that he's gonna be Parker's age some day? And with this attitude you've got going on right now, you're in for a world of trouble because kids need guidance. They need boundaries. And you'd better make damn sure they know why they're there, otherwise you're gonna end up raising a confused, scared little boy who acts out every time things don't go his way.",
        "Craig: So you think that's what's missing in Parker's life -- boundaries?",
        "Janet: To say the least.",
        "Craig: I agree with you. I agree with all of you. In fact, I have seen the light and the error of my ways, and I am fully aware that what Parker needs is for us to get him off the road and back into school.",
        "Janet: Drink this. You're giving me a headache.",
        "Craig: See? Wishes do come true. The coffee.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: I hate this. I feel like I'm abandoning my daughter.",
        "Holden: No, you're not. You're not abandoning her.",
        "Meg: Well, maybe one day you can tell her that because I'm not sure I'll be able to.",
        "Holden: Don't worry. Everything's gonna turn out fine. Everything's gonna be the way it should be. She won't even remember this period in her life because she will be with you, where she is supposed to be.",
        "Meg: I hope you're right.",
        "Holden: Until everything gets settled, you should probably try and find a way to keep busy. What about work? Have you thought about taking a shift at the hospital?",
        "Meg: No, no, no. I'm not ready. Right now I can't think of anything except getting my daughter back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: So, what did you do, Paul?",
        "Paul: Why do you automatically assume that Meg leaving was all my fault?",
        "Barbara: Wasn't it?",
        "Paul: Maybe she did something so unforgivable that I had to throw her out. Did you think of that?",
        "Barbara: I can't imagine you ever throwing her out, no matter how angry you were with her.",
        "Paul: You're right. I asked her to stay.",
        "Barbara: And she refused? Then tell me what happened.",
        "Paul: I'm not gonna talk about this with you.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you can't just let her go. You need her. Eliza needs her.",
        "Paul: No. We're better off without her.",
        "Barbara: So, that's it? You're just gonna let her walk away?",
        "Paul: She walked out on Eliza, too. Don't forget that.",
        "Barbara: And that's the part I can't wrap my brain around. Why would she do that?",
        "Paul: I don't know. Why does she do any of the things that she does? Why was she sleeping with Dusty?",
        "Barbara: You think she's sleeping with Dusty?",
        "Paul: I don't know. She's not sleeping with me.",
        "Barbara: She's not sleeping with Dusty, and if she's not sleeping with you, you can still fix that.",
        "Paul: I don't want to fix anything. Mother.",
        "Barbara: You know what? You have to think about Eliza. I'm sure she's missing her mom right now.",
        "Paul: She's fine.",
        "Barbara: I'm sure she's rather scared and feeling rather alone.",
        "Paul: She's not alone. She has me.",
        "Barbara: And you're alone, and Meg's not here, and you're alone, and Meg is the best thing that ever happened to you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, she doesn't feel the same way about me.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you can start over. You can put it back together. You can still be the man that Meg always knew that you're capable of being!",
        "Paul: Stop! I don't want to prove myself to anybody, and Meg wasn't the best thing that ever happened to me! Eliza was! And as long as I have her, Meg will never really leave me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yeah. Okay, thanks. Well, that was my friend Billy from auto theft.",
        "Parker: Did he find my car?",
        "Jack: He's got an address and a positive I.D. yep.",
        "Parker: That's great. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Jack: It's not good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: The number of volunteers we'll need -- oh -- is going to be huge. Someone's gonna have to supervise them, organize their schedule.",
        "Lily: And you want that someone to be me?",
        "Damian: Would you have any objections?",
        "Lily: Hmm, working on a cruise. Gee, that's a tough one. I'm in!",
        "Damian: Fantastico!",
        "Lily: I can't wait to tell Luke and Noah.",
        "Damian: They'll be thrilled.",
        "Holden: Thrilled about what?",
        "Damian: My ships have been cleared to sail again, so I'll be able to contribute one of them to the special cruise Luke and Noah are sponsoring.",
        "Lily: I told you about that, Holden. It's the trip for seriously ill children and their families.",
        "Holden: Right. Sounds like a great idea. When do the ships set sail?",
        "Damian: We haven't set a date yet, and we still have to put together the crew.",
        "Lily: We were just talking about that.",
        "Damian: Yeah. These children will need constant medical attention, so our first priority will be to hire a complete medical staff.",
        "Holden: That sounds like it might be perfect for you.",
        "Meg: Me?",
        "Holden: Yeah. It's not the same as working in the hospital, but --",
        "Meg: But it'll keep me away from Paul, right?",
        "Holden: I didn't say that.",
        "Meg: You know, why don't I just skip town? I don't have a daughter to take care of anymore, so why not? And there will be plenty of children around. I'm sure I'll barely miss her.",
        "Lily: Meg, that's not what Holden meant.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. I know you're right. I haven't been myself. I'm sorry.",
        "Holden: It's okay. It's all right.",
        "Meg: No, no, it's not. It's not. You know, I should go.",
        "Holden: Meg!",
        "Lily: Holden, let her go.",
        "Damian: I should get going, too. I'll be in touch, Lily.",
        "Lily: Yes. Thanks. Thanks for stopping by.",
        "Damian: Holden.",
        "Holden: Damian.",
        "Lily: You can breathe now. He's gone.",
        "[Holden sighs]",
        "Lily: I guess I don't need to ask how Meg's meeting with Bonnie went.",
        "Holden: She's scared to death about how long she might be separated from Eliza while Bonnie prepares her case.",
        "Lily: I feel terrible for her.",
        "Holden: Yeah, so do I. That's why I suggested the cruise thing. I mean, I wanted to help her. I didn't mean to hurt her.",
        "Lily: Of course not. She knows that. It's a shame that she won't go, though, because it would be great to have her there with us.",
        "Holden: You're going, too?",
        "Lily: I was going to tell you.",
        "Holden: Really? When? Before or after you set sail with Damian?",
        "Lily: You're not being fair.",
        "Holden: You're going on a cruise with Damian, and you want me to be fair?",
        "Lily: I don't think it's such a big deal. It's Luke's foundation that's sponsoring the cruise. I'd be there in an official capacity.",
        "Holden: Does Luke know you're going on this cruise?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Holden: Was this your idea?",
        "Lily: You're trying to turn this into something it's not.",
        "Holden: It was Damian's idea, wasn't it?",
        "Lily: Who cares whose idea it was? I'd be working. And I'm not just there to make sure things run smoothly. Luke's gonna be there. I can keep an eye on him.",
        "Holden: Who's gonna keep an eye on you?",
        "Lily: You're making it sound like Damian has some sort of ulterior motive for asking me to be there.",
        "Holden: Am I not supposed to have a problem with my wife sailing in to the sunset with her ex?",
        "Lily: What are you afraid is going to happen, Holden? What? You think I'm gonna sleep with Damian?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Damian: Meg.",
        "Meg: Damian, hey.",
        "Damian: I don't mean to bother you.",
        "Meg: No, you're not.",
        "Damian: I just wanted to apologize just in case I somehow contributed in upsetting you back at Holden and Lily's.",
        "Meg: No, it's not your fault or Holden's. I've pretty much been like this all morning.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry to hear.",
        "Barbara: Meg, I've been looking everywhere for you. I need to talk to you. Hello, Damian. I heard you were back in town. Nice to see you.",
        "Damian: Nice to see you, too.",
        "Barbara: Thank you. Meg.",
        "Damian: I should get going.",
        "Barbara: Yeah.",
        "Damian: Ciao.",
        "Barbara: Ciao. I was just at Fairwinds, and I need to know what's going on. Paul said you moved out.",
        "Meg: I had to. I couldn't stay in that house anymore.",
        "Barbara: And what about your little girl? She needs you.",
        "Meg: Did you see her? Is she all right?",
        "Barbara: She's fine. But I'm sure she misses her mommy.",
        "Meg: Not as much as I miss her.",
        "Barbara: Oh, Honey, then there's something you can do about that. You can go back to Paul. You can move back in.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, I can't!",
        "Barbara: He is miserable without you.",
        "Meg: Well, he's brought that onto himself with his jealousy and paranoia. He's created the situation, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Does he have reason to be jealous?",
        "Meg: Excuse me?",
        "Barbara: He thinks you're having an affair with Dusty.",
        "Meg: And you believed him?",
        "Barbara: No, no, I didn't think it was true.",
        "Meg: It's not true. He's punishing me for something that's all in his head.",
        "Barbara: You know, I don't understand something here. I thought the two of you were making progress. I thought you were working on your family.",
        "Meg: Our family is dead, and I am gonna use every resource possible to keep Eliza away from him.",
        "Barbara: You're gonna kill him. Don't you have any compassion?",
        "Meg: Why? Why? He's never shown me any. He made me beg just so that I could stay in the same house with my daughter. Does that remind you of anyone, Barbara?",
        "Barbara: Paul is not James.",
        "Meg: Isn't he? I know you love your son, but Eliza is your granddaughter. Do you really want her growing up like that? She needs to stay away from him.",
        "Barbara: Okay. I think you're right. What can I do to help?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I don't see it. Are you sure it's here?",
        "Jack: Maybe Billy was wrong.",
        "Parker: Oh. Oh, there it is. That's my car.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Craig: Hey.",
        "Carly: I thought you might be the police.",
        "Craig: Police? I'm intrigued. What did you do?",
        "Carly: It's not me. Parker's car has been stolen.",
        "Craig: Stolen? Oh, no.",
        "Carly: He's very upset. Jack is with him now. They're out looking for it.",
        "Craig: Well, I wish them luck. Hey, on the upside, though, without a car, Parker's options will be seriously limited. Who knew it would be so easy to get him back on the straight and narrow?",
        "Carly: Why do I get the feeling the answer to that question is you?",
        "Craig: Me?",
        "Carly: Craig, what the hell have you done? Start talking.",
        "Craig: What do you want me to say?",
        "Carly: Oh, how about something new and unusual, like the truth?",
        "Craig: The truth? Okay. I saw a problem, and I did what I had to do to solve it. How's that?",
        "Carly: You think what you did solved anything?",
        "Craig: Yes, I do. Parker had way too much freedom with that car.",
        "Carly: Thanks to you.",
        "Craig: I'm well aware it was my fault, Carly. I apologize for that. I never should have given him the money for that car, which is why I felt it was my responsibility to make things right.",
        "Carly: By stealing it?",
        "Craig: He never has to know it was me.",
        "Craig: Really? And what happens when he gets it back?",
        "Craig: He won't. I've seen to that.",
        "Carly: What did you do?",
        "Craig: I've helped the boy. That's what I've done.",
        "Carly: Oh, Craig. You honestly believe that, don't you?",
        "Craig: Yes, I do. Look, you'll see. Without that car, things will get back to normal for Parker.",
        "Carly: Craig, he's gonna agonize over what happened to it!",
        "Craig: I've done everyone a favor here, Carly. You know it, I know it, and one day you'll thank me for it.",
        "Carly: No, no, no. You really want to do me a favor? Just promise me that you will never try to help me or anybody in my family ever again. Hi. Are you okay?",
        "Parker: No. I found my car.",
        "Carly: Where is it?",
        "Parker: In a chop shop. It's been completely stripped. There's nothing left.",
        "Carly: Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Honey.",
        "Parker: It's okay. I'll just get a new one.",
        "Craig: How do you plan to do that, Parker?",
        "Parker: I'm gonna collect on my insurance.",
        "Carly: No, you're not.",
        "Parker: You're gonna stop me from doing that, too?",
        "Carly: No. Parker, you can't collect insurance that you don't have, and your temporary insurance expired like three hours ago now, and you never bothered to give me the new paperwork.",
        "Parker: Okay. Then I'll just get the money from my trust fund. When can you write me a check again?",
        "Craig: Oh. I'm sorry, Parker. I'm not going to do that.",

        "Janet: What are you doing here? I thought you got called in to work.",
        "Jack: I did.",
        "Janet: What? But you missed me so much you couldn't stay away? All right. Not so much.",
        "Jack: Parker's car was stolen last night. We found it in a chop shop on Vendor Street.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God.",
        "Jack: Mm-hmm.",
        "Janet: Was there anything left?",
        "Jack: It was stripped to the frame.",
        "Janet: Oh, man.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Parker's pretty bummed out. But on the bright side, it's one less battle we have to contend with.",
        "Janet: Hmm.",
        "Jack: \"Hmm\" what?",
        "Janet: Well, it's interesting 'cause Craig was in here earlier, and we were talking about Parker and the car, and Craig said that things have a way of working themselves out.",
        "Jack: He said that?",
        "Janet: He did. He did. You don't think -- he couldn't have --",
        "Jack: He totally could have. And I'm gonna kill him.",

        "Parker: It's my money.",
        "Craig: Not until you're 21 it's not, Parker. You asked me to look after you. That's what I'm doing.",
        "Parker: Well, I need a car.",
        "Craig: No, you don't. You got along just fine without one before. Now, right now is not the time, considering the markets, to take your money out of your trust.",
        "Parker: Well, I don't care about the markets.",
        "Craig: Well, fortunately for you, I do. Believe me, if I thought it was the right thing to do, I'd do it, but I'd prefer that there would be money for you there in the future. Now --",
        "Jack: Well, isn't this sweet.",
        "Carly: Jack, don't start, okay? Parker's upset enough about the car.",
        "Jack: I don't blame him. I'd be upset, too, and he's probably gonna be more upset when he finds out the truth.",
        "Parker: What are you talking about?",
        "Craig: Jack, you don't need to make this any worse than it already is.",
        "Jack: Me? No. I wouldn't dream of such a thing. I'd like to leave that up to you.",
        "Parker: Do you know something about what happened to my car?",
        "Jack: Go on, Craig. Tell him. You're his buddy. You're his pal. I'm sure he'll understand.",

        "Meg: How do I know I can trust you?",
        "Barbara: Because I'm Eliza's grandmother. I would do anything for her.",

        "Barbara: Yes, anything. Now, obviously you have something in mind. Why don't you tell me what it is?",
        "Meg: Eliza is just a baby, and she needs to be protected.",
        "Barbara: I agree with you.",
        "Meg: I want you to move into Fairwinds with Paul so you can keep an eye on her and make sure she's okay.",
        "Barbara: I don't think Paul would do anything to hurt Eliza.",
        "Meg: Paul started a fire with her in the house! Don't tell me what he wouldn't do! What if he has another breakdown?",
        "Barbara: Look. If you were there -- if you were there, Meg, you could be taking care of her.",
        "Meg: I thought you said you wanted to help.",
        "Barbara: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.",
        "Meg: If I went back in that house, I would be putting my own sanity at risk, and what good would that do for Eliza -- having two parents who couldn't function? I thought you said you wanted to do anything for her. Did you mean that?",
        "Barbara: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Meg: Then this is what I'm asking you to do.",
        "Barbara: Okay. I will move into Fairwinds with Paul and my granddaughter.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: You're sure there's no other way --",

        "Meg: What I want you can't give me.",
        "Damian: You want your daughter back.",
        "Meg: And until that happens, I have this awful feeling that I can't escape.",
        "Damian: Maybe you can. Maybe there is something I can do for you after all.",

        "Holden: What if I came home and told you that I was going on a cruise with Carly?",
        "Lily: Are you kidding? I'd poke so many holes in that boat, it would never leave the dock! This is different. Damian and I have been over for a long time.",
        "Holden: I know that, but sometimes that's just not enough.",
        "Lily: Are you talking about what happened with Dusty?",
        "Holden: No, no.",
        "Lily: Our marriage is different now. We are stronger. We're more connected. At least I feel like we are.",
        "Holden: And I feel the same way. Do I believe that you're gonna sleep with Damian? No, I don't.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Holden: But if you're gonna be away with him for days on end, my mind, it's gonna go there whether I want it to or not.",

        "Craig: Despite what you believe or what you'd like Parker to believe, I've done nothing wrong here.",
        "Parker: Prove it. Do you know anything about what happened to my car or not?",
        "Jack: Parker, come with me. Okay, what I'm about to tell you is not gonna be easy for you to hear, but ultimately, I think you're old enough to handle the truth.",
        "Craig: Careful, Jack. You've already accused me of one crime I didn't commit.",
        "Jack: I know I'm not gonna find any evidence, Craig. You covered your tracks or, I don't know, maybe you paid someone to do it for you, but it doesn't really matter.",
        "Craig: Because you were gonna accuse me anyway.",
        "Jack: I didn't have to! You know what your problem is, Craig? You like to run your mouth. Did you honestly think that Janet wouldn't put it together?",
        "Parker: Put what together?",
        "Jack: Your car wasn't stolen, Parker.",
        "Carly: Are you sure?",
        "Jack: Carly, I wouldn't have said anything if I wasn't.",
        "Craig: That's funny. I thought you just said you have no evidence to back up your accusation.",

        "Craig: No, I did not.",
        "Parker: You're gonna give me the money to get a new one.",
        "Craig: You want a car, then get a job, Parker. I'm not giving you anymore money from your trust fund.",
        "Parker: Fine. Arrest him.",
        "Carly: Parker, come on.",
        "Parker: He stole my car, and he wrecked it! I want him arrested!",
        "Jack: Parker, as much as I would love to throw him in jail, I can't.",
        "Parker: Why not?",
        "Jack: Because there's no physical evidence that he's responsible for any of this.",
        "Parker: But you know he did it, right? Come on. At least make him give me the money. He owes me.",
        "Jack: Parker, your money's in the trust, and you put Craig in charge of it. I do not have the power to make him hand it over to you.",
        "Parker: You can, right?",
        "Carly: What? I can what?",
        "Parker: Well, you two are together, right? He's into you. Please just tell him to! Mom, please help me!",
        "Carly: I think -- I think I am helping you by letting this happen.",
        "Parker: You don't care about me. None of you do. You're all against me!",
        "Jack: Parker, that's not true. We're all on your side, believe it or not. It's gonna take you a while to figure that out. Come on. I'll give you a ride to school.",
        "Parker: The day's almost half over!",
        "Jack: Great! Then you can make at least half your classes.",

        "Meg: So, when you were separated from Luke, how did you get through it?",
        "Damian: I learned how to distract myself. I found ways to occupy my time.",
        "Meg: Yeah. I heard about the organization you and Lucy were involved with.",
        "Damian: Yeah, well, that got a little messy toward the end, but the satisfaction I felt from helping people whose problems were bigger than my own -- well, I don't have to tell you. You're a nurse. You know what that's like.",
        "Meg: Did it work?",
        "Damian: I won't lie to you. It didn't erase the pain of being away from my kid.",
        "Meg: I can't imagine anything would.",
        "Damian: But it did help to fill some of the void.",
        "Meg: I know what you're doing.",

        "Meg: You are trying to convince me to come and work on your cruise.",
        "Damian: Well, in all fairness, it's not my cruise. It's Luke's.",
        "Meg: Yes, right. It's just your ship.",
        "Damian: One of my ships, yes. And, you know, many people would agree there are worse places to work at. These kids we're doing the cruise for, they're going to need the best medical professionals we can get, and I think they will benefit from you being there.",
        "Meg: Damian.",
        "Damian: And I think you will, too. Did I mention the boat has a pool?",

        "Paul: If you're here for another playdate with Eliza, you're too late. I just put her down.",
        "Barbara: Well, actually, I was thinking how wonderful it would be if I could be here when she woke up.",
        "Paul: She's a very heavy sleeper.",
        "Barbara: I don't think you understand what I mean.",
        "Paul: I don't think you understand what I mean. I don't want you here.",
        "Barbara: Honey, just listen to me, all right? After I left, I got to thinking, and I got to thinking about -- well, about the fact that now that Meg's not here how big this house is for you and Eliza, all these rooms, just the two of you.",
        "Paul: It's not just the two of us. We have servants.",
        "Barbara: Well, yes, but it's got to be a little bit like me at the Lakeview. You know, rattling around, making dinner for one.",
        "Paul: You're lonely?",
        "Barbara: Yes, I am. And I don't have to be. And neither do you. I was thinking how wonderful it would be if maybe I moved in here with you and Eliza.",
        "Paul: No, no.",
        "Barbara: I could help you out with the baby.",
        "Paul: No, no, my God, forget it.",
        "Barbara: I could take her on walks. I can give her baths. I know how difficult it is to be a single parent, Paul.",
        "Paul: It's not difficult. Everything's fine.",
        "Barbara: Today maybe.",
        "Paul: And I told you, Meg is going to come back for Eliza eventually.",
        "Barbara: Paul, Meg's not coming back.",
        "Paul: Sure, she is.",
        "Barbara: No, Honey, she's not, and it's time you faced reality.",
        "Paul: Do you know something I don't know? Look at me. Oh, you used to be so much better at this.",
        "Barbara: I ran into her in Old Town --",
        "Paul: Oh, you ran into today?",
        "Barbara: And I asked her why she left, and she said she didn't want to talk about it.",
        "Paul: She didn't want to talk about it.",
        "Barbara: No, she didn't.",
        "Paul: Why did she send you here? To spy on me?",

        "Meg: Well, I was thinking of starting out a little bit smaller, maybe as a nurse on the cruise.",
        "Lily: Are you sure?",
        "Meg: Yes. Damian convinced me to give it a try. In fact, I was thinking of talking to Bob and getting the hospital involved. You know, I should give him a call.",
        "Lily: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Holden: I guess you said all the right things to her, huh?",
        "Damian: Oh, I think she just needed time to think it over, that's all.",
        "Lily: Actually, I've been doing some thinking, too, and it's probably best if I don't go.",
        "Damian: What?",

        "Jack: Well, when I got there, Craig was doing his usual buddy-buddy routine.",
        "Janet: Oh, well, that was his first mistake.",
        "Jack: Right. And I tried to get him to admit what he'd done, but he wouldn't, so I had to be the one to tell Parker the truth.",
        "Janet: Ooh. Craig must have loved that.",
        "Jack: He was falling all over himself tonight. Parker knew he was lying. So Parker got mad at Craig. He got mad at us because we wouldn't give him the money to replace the car. It was a total nightmare.",
        "Janet: That sounds exhausting.",
        "Jack: It was.",
        "Janet: So, where's Parker now?",
        "Jack: Back at school. I drove him there, walked him to his classroom myself. I'm officially that parent now.",
        "Janet: Oh, Honey, you were born that parent. What are you gonna do about Craig?",
        "Jack: Nothing I can do. He covered his tracks. And the last thing I want to get involved with is another pointless case.",
        "Janet: So you're gonna let this go?",
        "Jack: I have to.",
        "Janet: Oh, good. Oh, good. Good. Because the important thing is, the car's gone, and that's a good thing for Parker.",
        "Jack: Well, there's another good thing for Parker. He can't stand Craig now, and that could end up benefiting all of us.",

        "Carly: It was not your place to intervene. Why can't you ever see that?",
        "Craig: I gave Parker money to buy a car. You didn't want the car here. Now the car is gone. What is the bloody problem?",
        "Carly: Well, for starters, he hates you now.",
        "Craig: So what? If it gets him back on track, I think I can live with that. Besides, he's 16. Next week he'll hate somebody else.",
        "Carly: Most likely me. What is all that? You're supposed to be in school. You just turn yourself around right now before I call your father.",

        "Holden: What did I do?",
        "Lily: Your sudden change of heart. You couldn't be more obvious.",
        "Holden: I saw how excited Meg was. I realized that it was a good cause, and I thought you should be a part of it.",
        "Lily: Oh, and the fact that Meg and I will probably be sharing the same room, that didn't have anything to do with it?",
        "Holden: Well, maybe a little bit.",
        "Lily: Unbelievable! What are you gonna do, bribe her to babysit me?",
        "Holden: That's a good idea. I might do that. Hey!",
        "Lily: I should be seriously insulted by this.",
        "Holden: You should be flattered.",
        "Lily: Flattered?",
        "Holden: Yeah. 'Cause I think my wife is so beautiful that any man would be a fool not to go after her.",

        "Carly: I don't answer to you, Craig, and you're not my husband. You're not his father. Why are you even here?",
        "Craig: Because I care about you.",
        "Carly: Well, who asked you to? I didn't. I know Parker didn't. You just put yourself in the middle of everything, and you actually -- you actually believe that you're helping!",
