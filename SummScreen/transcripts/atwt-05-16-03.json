        "Susan: Ali! I'm so sorry. I just heard what happened.",
        "Alison: Bad new travels fast.",
        "Susan: What a horrible thing to happen on your first night on the job.",
        "Alison: My first? You mean my last.",
        "Susan: Look, sweetie, I know you're upset. And that's understandable. But what happened tonight is just a very small part of what happens here.",
        "Alison: Mom, I may not know exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life, but watching people die is certainly not one of them. I quit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: When you asked me to observe her case, Mrs. Palmer was fine. I left you alone with her, and now she's dead. What happened in here, dad?",
        "Bob: I won't have any more information about what happened to Mrs. Palmer until we do an autopsy.",
        "Chris: Yeah, but you've got to have a suspicion, a hunch.",
        "Bob: No. No, I haven't been back in that room -- why am I explaining this to an intern?",
        "Chris: Dad?",
        "Bob: What are you suggesting?",
        "Chris: I'm not suggesting anything. I'm just trying to figure out how a woman whose stats were completely normal just suddenly -- died.",
        "Bob: Go ahead, say what you're thinking. You think I killed that woman.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spangler: Let me get this straight. You want me to work to earn the money you owe me?",
        "Dusty: You and I made a great team. We scored money hand over fist. Remember that?",
        "Spangler: I'm more the executive type now.",
        "Dusty: Charley, this thing's a sure bet. If you decide you want to get your hands dirty one more time, we can get a lot more money than what I owe you. Believe it.",
        "Spangler: What'd you say this tramp's name was?",
        "Dusty: Molly McKinnon. She's a widow. Her late husband had a lot of money. And if things go down the way I expect, we can grab a big chunk of that.",
        "Spangler: Well, what's gonna convince Mrs. McKinnon to hand over that kind of money to a shady character like you?",
        "Dusty: She'd do it. She'd do it to save my life, which is where you come in. All you gotta do is set me up to be murdered.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: What good could I possibly be to you knowing that my cover's blown? Dusty already knows that I've leaked information to you. So I think that pretty much concludes my business with the FBI, don't you think? Yeah, don't call anymore, Mr. Brackett. What? Excuse me?",
        "Brackett: You have been too close to Dusty Donovan to just drop this.",
        "Molly: Do I need me to explain myself again? I'm out.",
        "Brackett: I don't think so. The bureau reserves the right to call on you again if and when we see fit. Understood?",
        "Molly: I have nothing more to say to you on the subject of Dusty Donovan. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm already late for an engagement at the Lakeview.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I know this all sounds strange, but all of it is true.",
        "Nancy: But a conspiracy, Barbara? Why?",
        "Barbara: Because Carly and Rose and Emily wanted my career, my son, my dignity.",
        "Lisa: Oh, Barbara, those are pretty potent accusations.",
        "Barbara: But they all had something to gain by helping Craig.",
        "Kim: And Craig himself? Barbara, you jumped to conclusions about Craig once before, and you ended causing yourself and your entire family an awful lot of heartache.",
        "Barbara: Because I accused him of the wrong thing. Craig is not a murderer, but he's always been a thief. And he's so in love with Carly that nothing will stand in his way -- not his decency, his morals, his common sense or even the law. I tried to warn you, Rosanna. I did. I don't want to say I told you so, but, you know, Craig and Carly will stop at nothing to get what they want. And the rest of us have to stop letting them get away with it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: The designs are yours. The work is yours. Any resemblance to Barbara's sketches is purely coincidental. That's the story. We stick to that, we can have this. Huh?",
        "Jack: So Barbara was right. You two are in this together. What the hell have you done?",
        "Craig: Keep your knickers on, Jack. No crime's been committed. Any resemblance of Barbara's sketches to our designs is purely coincidental. Right, Carly? Tell him, Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Go ahead. Go ahead, say it. You think I killed that woman.",
        "Chris: I don't think that you killed anyone. I'm just -- I was hoping that you could have some insights.",
        "Bob: Oh, you want my insights? Well, if I believe that to be true, this would be a first, wouldn't it?",
        "Chris: Dad, don't you think you're being a little oversensitive?",
        "Bob: Oversensitive? Every time I turn a corner in this hospital, the interns and the nurses, well, they just clam up. Ever since Mr. Crumly died, they talk and there's gossip. But they don't share the talk with me, because they think I'm responsible for his death.",
        "Chris: Dad, there's always going to be speculation.",
        "Bob: And now my own son has joined the people who think I'm losing it.",
        "Chris: That's not true. I just asked you to ease up on your schedule and to go in for a checkup.",
        "Bob: Because you think I've become incompetent?",
        "Chris: No, because it's the wise thing to do. You tell patients 100 times a day to get some rest and get a checkup. You don't think they're all losing their mind, do you?",
        "John: Bob, would you order an autopsy for Mrs. Palmer?",
        "Bob: Yeah, sure. Let's do that. Let's find out what went wrong. Huh?",
        "Chris: Dad, come on.",
        "John: Are you gonna blow up at me, too?",
        "Chris: No.",
        "John: Then why do you look out of sorts?",
        "Chris: I'm just worried about a friend. Alison Stewart.",
        "John: Well, what about her?",
        "Chris: Well, it was her first day on the job, and she had to deal with the death of a patient. It's a heck of a way to start work.",
        "John: This undying concern of yours for a nurses' aide is not gonna interfere with your duties, is it?",
        "Chris: No.",
        "John: And you would tell me if there was something else bothering you?",
        "Chris: Of course. If you'll excuse me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Alison, stop! Honey, I know you're upset, but you can't just walk off the job because something happened that frightened you.",
        "Alison: Oh, yeah? Just watch me.",
        "Susan: Alison, seeing a patient die is a very difficult thing for any of us. I'm not saying it isn't.",
        "Alison: I'm not even supposed to think about stuff like dying for at least 80 years. I'm -- I'm just gonna hand over my I.D. badge and just call it a day, okay?",
        "Susan: No, it's not okay.",
        "Katie: I was thinking Alison just needs some time away from here. Maybe one of us should drive her home.",
        "Alison: Hello? I'm standing right here.",
        "Susan: Honey, I would drive you home, but I haven't completed my rounds. And aren't you on for another hour or so?",
        "Katie: Yeah. But --",
        "Chris: I could drive her.",
        "Alison: Excuse me, but she can drive herself, thank you very much.",
        "Susan: No, you can't get behind a wheel when you're this wound up. Let Chris drive you. I'll see you at home later. Cheer up. Everything's gonna look better in the morning.",
        "Alison: Don't you dare say it's gonna get better, too.",
        "Chris: Alison, wait. Okay, the first time you see somebody die, it's like this terrible thing. Trust me, I know. But then you get to see a baby being born. And it's like the biggest miracle in the world. Then you start to figure it out. That's just how life goes. Things cease to be this great thing or this terrible thing. You know, we get born, we get old, and we die. And the cycle starts all over again.",
        "Alison: Well, Krishna, it can start all over again without me.",
        "Chris: No. But Alison --",
        "Alison: No, forget it. You know, this is all your stupid idea anyway. Why don't you just mind your own business?",
        "Chris: Alison, wait, I'm supposed to drive you home!",
        "Alison: I can drive myself, thank you very much!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Spangler: You want me to put a contract out on you? What do you -- a death wish?",
        "Dusty: I just want you push all the right buttons. And you make sure Molly McKinnon comes up with the goods. She's smart, Charley, so you've got to be convincing.",
        "Spangler: How smart can she be spending good money to keep you alive?",
        "Dusty: She and I -- she and I got close.",
        "Spangler: You think you're such a stallion in the sack that she won't sell you down the river, huh? Huh?",
        "Dusty: Charley, she's got a soft spot for me. She tries to hide it, but -- I think she likes me.",
        "Spangler: Touching.",
        "Dusty: Charley -- we'll have our money by tomorrow night. We can get out of this town by sundown. What do you say?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Where's Jack? He'd better be back there arresting his wife, or your department's going to see a lawsuit the likes of which you've never seen.",
        "Hal: Barbara, come with me. I know this is going to be hard for you, but your hysterics are not helping.",
        "Barbara: I have never been so humiliated in my entire life.",
        "Hal: Let us sort this out.",
        "Barbara: You and your men have had enough time to solve all the crimes in the western hemisphere. Now when are these people gonna get arrested, huh?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So let's hear it, Carly. Is there something you need to tell me?",
        "Craig: Jack, Barbara just destroyed what should have been a shining moment for Carly. Can you blame her if she'd not exactly --",
        "Carly: No. I promised Jack that I wouldn't lie to him again. And I'm sticking to it. What Barbara said is true, Jack. Her designs were plagiarized.",
        "Jack: Oh, dammit, you two. I could have helped you. I could've have kept you out of trouble, but you had to keep me in the dark, Carly, again.",
        "Carly: No, no, Jack. You don't understand what I'm trying --",
        "Jack: No, you know what? Save it. Save it.",
        "Craig: Do you have any idea of the disaster you just created?",
        "Carly: Would you give me a break? If you are looking for someone to blame for all this, take a look in the mirror.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Now I want to see a police van outside, ready to haul away all these criminals.",
        "Jack: Attention, everybody. I'm sorry, folks, but the Lakeview is closed for the time being.",
        "Lisa: Closed?",
        "Jack: I'm sorry, Lisa.",
        "Lisa: For what reason?",
        "Jack: It's now a police investigation.",
        "Rosanna: So you're shutting down the rehearsal?",
        "Jack: That's right. Carly just admitted that the designs worn by the models were, in fact, stolen from Barbara.",
        "Barbara: What have I been saying all along?",
        "Jack: The show's over. The dining room is now closed. Unless you'd like to accompany me to the police station, I suggest you depart. Except you. You three stay put.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Kim, hey, did I miss it? Carly will kill me.",
        "Kim: I think Carly has other things to worry about at the moment.",
        "Molly: Don't tell me something went wrong.",
        "Kim: Well, you find Carly and let her explain it to you. Jack has just asked everybody to leave.",
        "Molly: Where's my cousin?",
        "Carly: Every time -- every time I almost make it -- every time that Jack and I almost get there --",
        "Molly: Carly, Carly, hold on! Hey, hey, what's going on? Stop! What?",
        "Carly: It's over, Molly. My dream, everything -- over. And Jack --",
        "Molly: What did he do?",
        "Carly: Jack thinks that I stole Barbara's designs, which I didn't. I didn't know anything about it. I didn't have anything to do with it.",
        "Molly: Okay, calm down. Did you tell him that?",
        "Carly: He wouldn't give me a chance. And I thought that we trusted each other from now on, Molly. I thought that things were going to be different between us, better, you know? But I've lost everything. I've lost everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay, you can stop it now. I've had enough punishment to last a lifetime, don't you think? I can't take anymore of this. I just --",
        "Rick: Alison?",
        "Alison: Do you always sneak up on people like that?",
        "Rick: No, I -- I -- thought you heard me come in. Are you okay?",
        "Alison: I was fine until you showed up. Just leave me alone.",
        "Rick: Do you want to talk?",
        "Alison: There's nothing to talk about.",
        "Rick: Okay, let's talk about nothing.",
        "Alison: Why don't you just get lost.",
        "Rick: I am lost. I'm trying to figure out why a great kid who's been through something any adult would find difficult to deal with feels she has to be like superwoman and stick it out alone.",
        "Alison: Who are you, Dr. Phil?",
        "Rick: No, just somebody who works at the same place you do and still hasn't gotten used to seeing what you saw today.",
        "Alison: You know about that? Well, it wasn't even like she was really sick or anything. She just -- she just fell over like she was going to sleep, only she wasn't sleeping. And -- and then all those buzzers and alarms and nurses flying in and out -- and for what? She was already -- it's not even like I knew her, Rick. It -- but just thinking about being here one minute, and the next -- just --",
        "Rick: A pretty tough first day on the job, huh?",
        "Alison: Well, yeah. And don't you dare say it's gonna get any better.",
        "Rick: Well, you never get used to seeing people die. It would be kind of weird, huh?",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, it doesn't matter, because I'm never going back there.",
        "Rick: Whatever you decide, I gotta tell you this, though. You're a heck of a lot braver than I was the first time I saw a patient die.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: Why? What did you do?",
        "Rick: I ran into the bathroom and -- well, let's just say it wasn't very pretty.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Rick: Cross my heart and -- I think I better quit while I'm ahead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "John: Dr. Hughes, can I talk to you for a minute? It's kind of important. This is Mrs. Palmer's chart. There's been a mistake.",
        "Bob: I don't see anything out of the ordinary.",
        "John: The patient was supposed to receive blood pressure medication at 6:00 in the morning. The notation in the box says \"P.M.\" I don't have to tell you there's a big difference.",
        "Bob: Of course, 12 hours could be a matter of life or death.",
        "John: She was your patient, wasn't she?",
        "Bob: Well, the notations are mine, John. Is that what you're getting at?",
        "John: If it's your notations, then it's your error. Now this, unlike Mr. Crumly's case, will not be resolved so easily in your favor.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Well? Don't keep me in suspense forever. What do you think?",
        "Spangler: I'm in. But don't you dare cross me, or this fake murder might end up a little more real than you want.",
        "Dusty: Cross you? Charley, c'mon. You know me.",
        "Spangler: Yeah. I do. So don't try anything.",
        "[Spangler clears throat]",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Spangler: Don't you think you ought to lay out your game plan?",
        "Dusty: I got everything under control. Don't worry about it.",
        "Spangler: So share.",
        "Dusty: All right. I need you to do me a favor.",
        "Spangler: See, I -- I knew you would have an angle.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, no, Charley, no, you gotta hear me out on this. [Dusty sighs] I need you to work my face over. I want you to take a deep breath. And I -- I want you to give me a few good punches to the face. Don't get weak on me. Just make it count, Charley. Make it count.",
        "Spangler: If this is part of your game plan, I -- I like it already.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm taking you to the station again for questioning. I hope we can do this with as little embarrassment as possible. And I'm not going to handcuff you. I trust you will follow instructions and not give me any grief. Do we understand each other?",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Rose: Yeah, of course, yeah.",
        "Jack: Do we understand each other, Craig?",
        "Craig: Yeah, yeah, whatever, Jack. Let's get this on the road.",
        "Rose: Don't be too hard on Carly, okay? She had nothing to do with this.",
        "Jack: Stop defending her. She admitted that she and Craig stole Barbara's designs.",
        "Emily: She couldn't have said that, Jack.",
        "Rosanna: Why not? What's the truth, Craig? Do you think you can manage to utter one honest sentence before you're taken away into long-overdue custody?",
        "Craig: Well, Jack, you weren't listening, as usual.",
        "Jack: Carly said the designs were plagiarized.",
        "Craig: She never said she stole them. She said plagiarized. And she had no idea until a few minutes ago. She had no clue that the theme of her show had its genesis in Bar-bar's so-called mind.",
        "Jack: That doesn't make any sense. How could Carly steal Barbara's ideas and not know it?",
        "Craig: I saw some of Bar-bar's designs, and I remembered, then I destroyed them.",
        "Jack: But Carly still had to draw them.",
        "Craig: Exactly. You remember when she was blocked? From all that grief you were putting her through, I might add.",
        "Jack: Get to the point, Craig. Get to the point.",
        "Craig: The point is I fed her a few thematic ideas -- twilight, a strapless gown here, a sparkle there. But the drawings were all Carly's, 100% -- the fabric choices, the silhouettes. Just the -- the theme of the overall show was -- not hers.",
        "Rosanna: You low-life, plagiarizing idiot!",
        "Craig: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.",
        "Rosanna: Is it always your intention to humiliate me? To shut me out of Monte Carlo and play me for the fool with Carly -- that's one thing. But to put me in the center of this despicable, illegal charade -- it's unforgivable.",
        "Craig: Rosanna -- Rosanna!",
        "Jack: Carly really didn't know?",
        "Craig: Well, Jack, if you really loved her, you might have stuck around and let her explain.",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Hal: Everybody's cleared out. Where's Carly?",
        "Jack: I have to find her. Listen, can you take these three down to the station and hold 'em till the D.A. gets there, please?",
        "Hal: Come on, let's go. You, too, Craig.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Do you have any idea how hard I worked on these, Molly?",
        "Molly: What are you doing?",
        "Carly: I slaved for these! I -- I went against doctor's orders. I put my relationship with Jack on the line. And all for something that wasn't even really mine! Well, I'm --",
        "Molly: Honey, what are you doing?",
        "Carly: I'm gonna get rid of it, Molly.",
        "Molly: What are you looking for? Stop!",
        "Carly: I'm going to wipe it out, Molly!",
        "Molly: Don't you do that!",
        "Carly: I'm gonna wipe it out. All of it out!",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Molly: Craig fed you an idea or two. It was your designs. It's your fashions. Carly, it's your fabrics. Stop it!",
        "Jack: Hey, what's going on, Carly? What the hell are you doing? Give me that.",
        "Carly: No!",
        "Jack: This stuff is toxic. Carly, stop it!",
        "Carly: It's not the only poison in the room, is it, Jack?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I have a life, a married life, and you are not my husband. It is not your job to worry about keeping my dreams alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: What are you talking about? No time to do what?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna be dead by midnight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Carly coughing]",
        "Jack: We need to sit her down.",
        "Molly: Carly, here, sit. Honey, just sit down. It's going to be fine. It's going to be fine. Deep breath.",
        "Jack: Molly, could you get her some water, please?",
        "Molly: Yeah, sure, of course.",
        "Carly: I worked so hard, Jack. I -- I risked my health, and for what? I thought the designs were mine. Craig set it up like we were having some kind of brainstorming session. He'd throw out an idea, and I'd draw it. I didn't know.",
        "Jack: I know.",
        "Carly: I had no idea.",
        "Jack: I know. I know. Craig told me.",
        "Carly: And you believed him? Oh, good. That's great. So I'm only innocent because Craig said I'm innocent.",
        "Jack: No, hey, hey, I didn't know what you meant, Carly. How could I? You sounded like you were confirming it. You said that Barbara's designs were stolen.",
        "Carly: You know me. You know that I would never steal another designer's work, Jack. I have way too much pride.",
        "Jack: But then I saw you two together, and he was saying, \"stick to the story.\"",
        "Carly: You could have asked what he meant. You could have seen by the look in my eye that all -- all I needed was a chance to explain to you. But you weren't looking, were you? You weren't listening.",
        "Jack: I'm not always perfect.",
        "Carly: And I'm not always flawed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: Alison, sweetie. I couldn't stop thinking about how -- how awful you must feel. I flew through my rounds so I could get home. How are you doing?",
        "Alison: I'm okay now.",
        "Susan: You are? You were so upset at the hospital. Have you two been having a talk?",
        "Rick: We've been exchanging war stories.",
        "Susan: Oh. Tell you what -- I'm gonna go upstairs. I'm gonna change my clothes, and then I'm gonna take you out and treat you to something special.",
        "Alison: Just you and me?",
        "Susan: Sure. You and me.",
        "Alison: Fries and a vanilla milkshake?",
        "Susan: Well, you drive a hard bargain, but, okay, the works. I'll be right back.",
        "Alison: Listen, I just wanted to say thanks.",
        "Rick: For what?",
        "Alison: Well, I know I was kind of a brat the first time we met. But tonight it was like -- I don't know, like you were saying that you wanted to forget about all that.",
        "Rick: It's forgotten.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well -- well, thanks.",
        "Rick: Alison, I'd like for us to be friends.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, don't get your hopes up.",
        "Rick: Why, you think you'd rather hate me?",
        "Alison: Hate you? I don't even know you.",
        "Rick: Well, exactly. If you don't hate me, what's with the attitude? You wanna know what I think?",
        "Alison: Do I have a choice?",
        "Rick: No. You hate that your mom dropped her fathead boyfriend in your lap and said, \"deal with it.\" Am I close?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hey. I thought that was you. Shouldn't you be at home getting some much needed sleep like every other half-dead intern?",
        "Chris: Yeah, I'm not sure sleep is in the cards tonight. Your shift is over, huh?",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, finally. This day has felt like a week. Did you just lose your last best friend, or does it just look that way?",
        "Chris: I might have.",
        "Katie: You want to talk about it? You know, you and I used to be pretty good friends before -- well, before we weren't.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I remember. You know, it's funny how someone you think is in that category can just up and flake out on you.",
        "Katie: You mean like Gordo? Oh, I felt so terrible about that whole scene this afternoon. I mean, all that stuff he was saying about your dad? At the very least, he should respect the head of the hospital.",
        "Chris: Yeah, I can't waste my time being mad at Gordo. I'm too worried about my dad.",
        "Chris: I overheard him talking to John Dixon today. It was clear. My dad made a mistake with the dead woman's meds.",
        "Katie: Another mistake?",
        "Chris: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God.",
        "Chris: I know. I'm not saying that it had anything to do with her death. Probably not --",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Chris: But how could he make another mistake so soon? You know, I asked him to go see a doctor for a checkup. He said that he would, but it's obvious that he needs more than a little blood work and an EKG. He needs a specialist.",
        "Katie: What? Won't he listen to you?",
        "Chris: No, I'm still the little kid who's supposed to go to him for help, not the other way around. It's so frustrating. I can't even get my own dad to go see a doctor.",
        "Katie: Well, maybe you can't -- but I think I know someone who can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bartender: You sure you don't want a shot of something in that?",
        "Molly: No, Lloyd. It's not for me. So water's fine. Thanks.",
        "Jack: You can cancel the drink. Carly already took off.",
        "Molly: What? Don't tell me something else happened?",
        "Jack: No. She -- she couldn't take it, Molly. She couldn't take me anymore.",
        "Molly: I am so sorry. And here I thought everything was looking up between the two of you.",
        "Jack: No, they were. But I messed up. I waited till she needed me most and I picked that moment to let her down. No wonder she took off.",
        "Molly: Would you stop it! Stop talking like one little misunderstanding is the end of the world for the two of you.",
        "Jack: You didn't hear her, Molly. She sounded pretty final.",
        "Molly: It always sounds that way with you guys. One little thing and it's like the sky is falling. Listen, just go find her. Apologize to her. Hold her. Kiss her. Love her. [Cell phone rings] yeah?",
        "Dusty: Molly? I'm in trouble. I'm in so much trouble. I don't know what to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: How could I do that, John? How could I write \"P.M.\" For \"A.M.\"? You know it doesn't matter what the post-mortem says. Something's not right with me. You know, Chris and Kim wanted me to have another checkup, and I've just been too stubborn, I've put it off. Too much pride, I guess. This is the first time in my career that I've ever put my ego before my concern for my patients.",
        "John: Come on. That's not true. You've worked to the bone to give your patients everything you've got. Let's not jump to conclusions here, okay?",
        "Bob: I have to take full responsibility for this mistake, no matter what happens. I think it's time that I think about stepping down as head of this hospital.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: Alison, if you want to hate me, fine. You want to mutter four-letter words under your breath whenever my name comes up? Great, go ahead. You want to throw darts at my picture? I don't care. But please, please, please -- don't take it out on Susan.",
        "Alison: I get it. My mom put you up to this talk, didn't she?",
        "Rick: No. Nobody put me up to anything. I just don't want to see her hurt. Susan loves you, Alison. All she wants is for the two of you to get along. I mean, hate me all you want -- but please, if you can find it in your heart? Be nice to your mom.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rose: I'm glad they didn't fingerprint us, you know. It's not good for the manicure.",
        "Barbara: Good, get those jokes out now, girls. I hear where you're going is pretty grim.",
        "Emily: Will you please do something about her, Hal.",
        "Hal: All right, everybody please just sit tight, wait for the D.A. Barbara, why don't you come up to my office. I'll get you away from the uproar.",
        "Barbara: Oh, that's very nice of you, Hal. I just want to know when Evelyn gets here. Oh, and Rose, I'm sure you'll be quite colorful when you go down in flames.",
        "Hal: Come on, I'm not gonna let you miss a thing.",
        "Emily: Carly, oh, honey, are you okay? Oh, dear.",
        "Craig: You want me to apologize?",
        "Carly: What could you possibly say that would make up for the hell you've turned my life into?",
        "Craig: I wanted your life to be glorious, Carly. I wanted you standing right up front when Monte Carlo made it big.",
        "Carly: Well, I was out front. You got that part right. I was center stage when the biggest opportunity of my life blew up in my face! Thank you, Craig! Thank you so much for that!",
        "Craig: I did try.",
        "Carly: Yes. Why exactly did you try? I don't really understand that. Why go to such extremes to keep me in that company? You could have hired a different designer. But instead you lied, you broke the law and then you worked so hard to cover your tracks. Why?",
        "Craig: So you could have your dream.",
        "Carly: My dreams are none of your business, Craig! I have a life, a married life. And you are not my husband. It is not your job to worry about keeping my dreams alive!",
        "Craig: Yeah, but you are more then a housewife, Carly. You have -- you have a greatness in you.",
        "Carly: Rosanna was right about you. You have some weird, strange, obsessive infatuation with me and you're letting it get you all twisted up.",
        "Craig: I'm sorry --",
        "Carly: No, I don't want you to apologize, Craig! If you apologize then I would actually have to spend time deciding whether or not I'm going to forgive you. And, see, here's the thing. I have spent more than enough time on you already. And I would really like it if from now on you and I would have no connection at all whatsoever.",
        "Craig: Carly --",
        "Carly: Just forget about me, alright?! Lose my number! Okay? Throw out my sketchpads! Rent my work space to some other designer! I don't want you! I don't want your help, I don't want your business, and I don't want your friendship, Craig! I hate you! I hate you for what you've done to me!",
        "Jack: Carly, honey -- I am so sorry.",
        "Carly: I don't want to hear it anymore, Jack.",
        "Jack: Listen. Listen to me, please. I made a mistake today, a big one. I want to make it up to you. I want to start all over. Just tell me what it would take for you to forgive me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: I said that Molly's on her way up. Well, maybe you'd understand me if didn't do such a number on my jaw, Charlie. [Knock on door] she's here. I'll keep you posted.",
        "Molly: Hey, you sounded really-- oh, my God. What happened to you?",
        "Dusty: No, don't. Just don't.",
        "Molly: Dusty, come on. What is going on? Let me see.",
        "Dusty: It's all right. It's all right. Just -- it's over, you know.",
        "Molly: What are you talking about? What is \"over\"?",
        "Dusty: Everything. I'm just so tired of running from the truth. Everything's just up. There's no time. I'm out of time.",
        "Molly: What are you talking about? No more time to do what?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna be dead by midnight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rick: You think you can do that? Take it easy on her and take the rest out on me?",
        "Alison: It's not that I don't love my mom. I do. But she didn't even tell me she had a boyfriend, much less that he was moving to town and coming to live with us.",
        "Rick: Alison, I told you that it's a lot to take in. And when I think of it, I could have been a lot more compassionate, too. Maybe you can forgive me?",
        "Alison: Maybe.",
        "Rick: Well, that's a start, huh?",
        "Alison: So what now? I give you a big hug and tell you how much I've always needed a father figure? You can call me \"princess\" and I'll call you \"daddy\"?",
        "Rick: No, you're not the princess type. But you are fun. And most of the time, I like a good joke.",
        "Alison: Is this one of those times?",
        "Rick: Sure. But does everything have to be a joke with you, Alison? Don't you believe in happy endings?",
        "Alison: Why should I? I've never had one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: No, Jack. My head is swimming with apologies and regrets and I can't -- I just need to clear my mind.",
        "Jack: I meant what I said about starting over. Move in with me. I'll throw out the divorce suit.",
        "Carly: If you wanted to throw out the divorce suit, Jack, you would have done it months ago.",
        "Jack: I thought that's what you wanted.",
        "Carly: I am so sick of people trying to give me what they think I want! You and Rosanna and Emma and Mike and Emily and Rose and Craig! Yanking at me and pulling at me, until I feel like I'm going to come apart! And what about this latest fiasco? What do you think that Barbara's gonna do, huh? I'll bet she can't wait to tell the press that I stole her designs. And here I thought that I had just created some of the best stuff ever. And now -- it's completely over. Do me a favor, all of you. The next time any one of you gets the urge to help me, don't!",
        "Barbara: You're not letting her walk out of here, are you? These people tortured me so she could steal my designs!",
        "Evelyn: Who's being charged in the abduction of Barbara Ryan?",
        "Barbara: All of them! Rose D'Angelo, Emily Stewart Munson, Craig Montgomery -- and Detective Jack Snyder.",
        "Hal: Barbara --",
        "Evelyn: You want to press charges against Detective Snyder?",
        "Barbara: Detective Snyder refused to investigate the crime because he was protecting his wife. And now, he's let her walk out of here. I want them all arrested!",

        "Rosanna: Leaving your victory party so soon? I would have thought you'd want to stick around and thank all the wonderful friends who lied to their lovers, compromised their ethics, manipulated their families and broke law after law to get you what you wanted.",
        "Carly: What do you want from me, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: I want you out of this town. I want you away from my company, away from my husband. And the sooner the better.",
