        "Emily tries to convince Paul to forget about Rosanna and what went wrong in their marriage to make her leave. She wants Paul to get back out into the dating world, but Paul is dead set against romance. Emily wants to convince him he is a catch, and she promises to help him find the woman of his dreams. They end up becoming buzzed and having a really fun time, but after Emily leaves Paul pulls out his wedding band when he was married to Rosanna to look at it. Holden's doubt of Keith intensifies when he runs into Les at the Police Station. Holden seeks out Jack who is having lunch with Carly. Holden comes in demanding Jack look into Keith, as Julia's murderer, but Jack will have none of it, because he is sure that it was Les. He is angry with Holden for suggesting they let Les off after what he did to Carly and JJ, but Holden just wants him to reconsider him for Julia's murder. Carly supports Keith as well, and is a little curious as to why Holden is so jealous, and suggests he call Lily. Meanwhile, Lily and Keith have set up camp for the night in the woods near a place Keith used to play as a child. They continue to bond some more. There bonding turns passionate as they kiss every chance they can get. When Lily excuses herself for a moment, Holden calls her cell phone and Keith turns the phone off, as he lays out the sleeping bag for Lily and him. Craig has seen Rosanna in Bangkok and convinces a woman to let him in to see her. Rosanna is shocked to see Craig, but wants him to leave. Craig is confused at what she is doing there, and does not want to leave her there. She finally explains she is there because James has Cabot. Craig is amazed thinking Cabot had obviously died in the fire. She explains the events leading up to her trying to make a call to Paul, which James found out about, which caused him to leave her there and leave with Cabot. Craig promises to help get her out of there, and to help her get Cabot back, as we hear James outside the door, back to get Rosanna."

        "Emily: Hey. What ya drinking?",
        "Paul: Oh, we drinking? You made it sound like this is some kind of an emergency.",
        "Emily: Well, actually, it is. Because, you see, if I don't find out what you want to drink and sit you down and force you to remember what it's like to have a little bit of fun --",
        "Paul: Wow. Have you been talking to my mother?",
        "Emily: No. You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Paul: Because it sounds like you're on some kind of a mission.",
        "Emily: I am.",
        "Paul: Okay. Look, I appreciate all of this --",
        "Emily: What, you're not going to let me cheer you up?",
        "Paul: No, I am. I am cheered up. This is about as cheered up as I get.",
        "Emily: All right. I know you've been busy with your family and things. But it's time to concentrate on you, Paul, and what you want to do with the rest of your life.",
        "Paul: Well, how about sleeping?",
        "Emily: I'm not going to let you sleep the rest of your life away, no.",
        "Paul: I've been thinking, maybe I could work. Maybe 18, 19 hours a day.",
        "Emily: Paul, I know what happened with Rosanna. It's hard on you, but if you would just put yourself out there.",
        "Paul: What do you want me to do? Register with a dating service?",
        "Emily: I want you to consider having dinner with friends. And then eventually -- someday -- maybe dinner with somebody who's more than a friend. Rosanna is gone. It's time to move on.",
        "Paul: What if -- now I know that she's hurt you --",
        "Emily: What about how she hurt you?",
        "Paul: What if there's something wrong? Because I've been feeling like I should get on a plane and go find her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Ladies never let me down.",
        "Q: You've done very well for yourself.",
        "Craig: Thank you, Q. What time is it?",
        "Q: Dawn. We played all night. And now, if you will excuse me, I have a few things to attend to. Give our guests one last drink and then see them out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Mom, yes, I know how to light the grill. Yeah, I'll clean up, too. [Doorbell rings] Mom, all right. I've got to go, they're here. Okay? I told you -- Celia, Will and this other girl from school. All right? So have fun with Dad. I've got to go.",
        "Celia: Coffee crunch or cherry vanilla?",
        "Casey: Score.",
        "Celia: I'm going to put these in the freezer.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Celia: Is Will here?",
        "Casey: He called, he said he's running late.",
        "Celia: But he's coming?",
        "Casey: I guess.",
        "Celia: And your mom?",
        "Casey: She's out. It's just us.",
        "Celia: I'm going to fix my hair.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Casey: Hey. Will's not here yet.",
        "Gwen: Can I come in? Or do you want me to wait outside? Does it bother you that I'm here?",
        "Casey: Why should it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Hello.",
        "Carly: Hey -- hey. I was just going to order something and bring it over to the station.",
        "Jack: I got somebody to cover for me. We can eat here.",
        "Carly: You sure?",
        "Jack: Oh, let me think. Would I rather have dinner alone with my beautiful wife, or hunched over a desk, fielding phone calls every five minutes with guys trying to bird-dog my fries. Tough one.",
        "Carly: You just don't want me to the station.",
        "Jack: And what if that's true?",
        "Carly: I love you for it.",
        "Jack: I promise you, Les will be outta town as soon as I can make it happen.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "Jack: And in the meantime, I want you to stay away from the station. Just focus on you and me and the kids.",
        "Carly: And my new job.",
        "Jack: And your new job. And it'll all work out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: Danny -- is Jack around?",
        "Cop: Sorry, Holden. He's out with the wife. Can I help?",
        "Holden: I've been hearing some stuff about Keith Morrissey. I've been hearing that he has these mob connections, and I was just wondering if Jack --",
        "Les: Mob connections? That's the least of it. Keith Morrissey's a murderer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: Well -- now, I swear there was a cabin up here, because I used to sneak in and out of it when I was a kid. I don't know what happened. Somebody must've burned it down. They didn't tell me about it. So, we flew all this way up here, I guess -- I'm sorry.",
        "Lily: No, no. It's not your fault.",
        "Keith: Well, if we leave now, we can get back to Oakdale.",
        "Lily: What are you talking about? No, no, no, we're not going anywhere.",
        "Keith: Lily, listen, we -- there's no water, there's no cabin, where're we gonna sleep?",
        "Lily: I thought I saw some camping equipment in the plane?",
        "Keith: Oh, yeah, well, that's for emergencies. I got a little tent and supplies, you know, whatever I need.",
        "Lily: Perfect! Yeah, we'll set up a tent right over here. Ah, the trees will make a good windbreak, and we can watch the sunrise.",
        "Keith: You're serious?",
        "Lily: Oh, yeah. You got an ax? We're gonna need some firewood.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: I heard that Keith was a gambler. And that he was into some loan shark for a lot of money. But a murderer?",
        "Jessica: My client has nothing more to say on the subject.",
        "Holden: Jess, do you really think that Keith Morrissey killed his sister, or are you just trying to raise the issue to create reasonable doubt?",
        "Jessica: I didn't raise the issue, Holden, and I'm not going to discuss it. But I will say that, though my client is no saint, the prosecution's case is problematic.",
        "Les: The man looked me in the eye and he admitted to planting bee pollen in my car, just like he planted that cell phone.",
        "Holden: Maybe. I can see Keith planting evidence to help the state's case. But, c'mon. A murderer?",
        "Les: Oh, man. Have you ever had somebody come after you for money? They will kneecap you just as soon as look at you. Now, Keith, he needed the money. That's why he killed his sister and he's gotta get his hands on J.J.'s trust fund. And then he pins it on me. The guy's home free.",
        "Jessica: Les, I have half an hour. Are you gonna hold a press conference or are we gonna get to work?",
        "Les: You're the boss. Hey, buddy, just know this. Keith Morrissey? That's a dangerous man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Nice house.",
        "Casey: Thanks.",
        "Gwen: I didn't know you were rich.",
        "Casey: I'm not.",
        "Gwen: I'm just saying not everybody gets born into a setup like this.",
        "Celia: Hey. Gwen, what's up?",
        "Casey: Celia -- hey, you want to help me with the grill?",
        "Celia: Sure. Will should be here any minute.",
        "Gwen: Not a problem. If I want to powder my nose, how many choices do I get?",
        "Celia: I know, there's like five bathrooms, right?",
        "Casey: There's one right around the corner. So what do we do if Will doesn't show up?",
        "Celia: He'll be here. And if he doesn't show up, it's fine. You'll get to know Gwen. You're going to really like her. Hey, Will. Gwen's here --",
        "Casey: You sure you're okay with this?",
        "Celia: Why wouldn't he be okay with it?",
        "Casey: I'm just asking.",
        "Will: It's just dinner. It's no big deal.",
        "Celia: We should get the grill going.",
        "Casey: Yeah, all right.",
        "Gwen: Hey, you need some help?",
        "Casey: No, we've got it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You want to find the woman who drugged me, tried to have your brother sent back to the hospital, walked out on your marriage, and had you evicted from your home? The woman is sick.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, exactly. She must have had some kind of a breakdown, because the woman that I married would never have done that. And, I don't know, I wished I handled things differently. I wished that I tried to help her.",
        "Emily: She didn't want your help. She wanted to trash her life and then yours and then mine, and then get outta town.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but why? We were happy. Why would she sabotage that?",
        "Emily: Because that's what she's used to. I mean, she married Craig Montgomery, for crying out loud.",
        "Paul: What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Emily: Plenty. I think when a woman marries a guy like Craig, it's because somewhere deep down, she doesn't believe she deserves anything better. And then you come along, and treat her like a queen, she didn't know what to do with it. She had to get out.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I don't buy it.",
        "Emily: You don't have to buy it, but you have to accept what happened and move on.",
        "Paul: Acceptance is not all it's cracked up to be. I mean, we didn't accept that you broke into the house and tried to haunt Rosanna --",
        "Emily: Excuse me, that was different.",
        "Paul: How? You did something that didn't make any sense, so we looked into it. We looked into the facts and we discovered that, guess what, you've been drugged, you've been hypnotized.",
        "Emily: You think that Rosanna was drugged?",
        "Paul: No, I'm just saying that it doesn't make any sense. And until it makes sense, I can't move on.",
        "Emily: Okay. We don't know why she did what she did. I'll give you that. Maybe she had a breakdown. Maybe she has an agenda. Who knows, who cares? She had a choice. And she chose to sacrifice your marriage. And now here you are, you are lonely and you miss her, and you are trying your damndest to rewrite history. But I was there. I was there the day you were evicted, and you were furious. So, you know what? Hold onto that. Don't torture yourself with the \"what ifs,\" because she's gone. And if you're lucky? She will never come back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Say, Q -- can you show me somewhere where I could freshen up? I want to look nice for my new passport?",
        "Q: I'll have Mya accompany you to our guest suite.",
        "Craig: All right, thank you.",
        "Q: If you would please show our friend to the guest suite. Until we meet again.",
        "Craig: Q, it's been a pleasure.",
        "Mya: Our guest suite is right this way.",
        "Craig: Yes, all right, but I'm not interested in your guest suite. I'm interested in that little room right here. How much do you think it'll take to get in?",
        "Mya: I don't know what you mean.",
        "Craig: Oh, I think you do, Mya. You're unhappy. You're real unhappy. Now I want to get in and you need money. The question is how much.",
        "Mya: Why do you want to go into that room?",
        "Craig: 'Cause I know the lady you've got in there.",
        "Mya: Can you help her?",
        "Craig: Just so we understand each other. I go in and talk to the lady, and you talk to no one. Okay? You'll get the rest later. Thank you. Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: You stay away from me.",
        "Craig: What are you doing here?",
        "Rosanna: As if you didn't know.",
        "Craig: I don't. I didn't know you were in Bangkok, and this place isn't exactly your style. Are you all right?",
        "Rosanna: Why?",
        "Craig: Because it sure looks to me like you're in trouble. Are you?",
        "Rosanna: If I was, you'd do what?",
        "Craig: I would help you. So -- so all right. Be inscrutable. And have a nice, decadent life.",
        "Rosanna: Did James send you?",
        "Craig: James Stenbeck?",
        "Rosanna: Never mind. Just go.",
        "Craig: Is he holding you here?",
        "Rosanna: No. No, I'm here of my own free will.",
        "Craig: No, you're not. You're terrified.",
        "Rosanna: If this is some sort of test --",
        "Craig: What would I have to do with James Stenbeck? All right, now come on, let's get out of here. There's just one girl here. I can buy our way out.",
        "Rosanna: I can't.",
        "Craig: Why not?",
        "Rosanna: Because Cabot is here. James has him. He's alive.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: So who knew Casey had the life? He's like the perfect all-American boy in the perfect all-American family in the perfect all-American house.",
        "Will: Is there a problem with that?",
        "Gwen: No. I'm just saying nobody I know actually lives like this. So how'd you get to be his best friend?",
        "Will: Because I'm such a freak?",
        "Gwen: Give it a rest, Will, it's not like I'm Hilary duff. Let me get that.",
        "Casey: I've got it.",
        "Celia: So, I heard a rumor.",
        "Casey: Yeah, about who?",
        "Celia: You.",
        "Casey: Me? What're they saying?",
        "Celia: That you're a player.",
        "Casey: Not true.",
        "Celia: Well, tell it to your girlfriend. And I don't mean me.",
        "Casey: I don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Celia: Your secret lover? Did you think I wouldn't find out?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: You got a minute? Hey, Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Hey, have a seat. What's up?",
        "Holden: I've been talking to Les.",
        "Jack: I'm gonna take a walk with Holden.",
        "Carly: Why? No. I'm not gonna faint just because I heard Les' name. Besides I would very much like to know what he had to say.",
        "Holden: Les seems to think that he's getting railroaded, and Jessica agrees.",
        "Jack: Jessica is his attorney, Holden. She's paid to agree.",
        "Holden: Yeah, I know that. But I have been thinking about some of the things that he said, and I think that -- I think that maybe you got the wrong guy. I think that maybe you need to reopen the investigation.",
        "Jack: I'll see you at home, okay?",
        "Holden: Carly, I know how you feel about Les --",
        "Jack: He tried to kill her, Holden. And he tried to kill J.J., and he did kill Julia. And you want me to reopen the investigation?",
        "Holden: Not into the assault or the kidnapping. He's gonna do time for that. But I don't that he killed Julia. It's too convenient.",
        "Jack: For who?",
        "Holden: Keith. Keith needed the money. Lucinda has got papers showing that he tried to withdraw money from J.J.'s trust fund.",
        "Jack: What are you doing here?",
        "Holden: I'm trying to --",
        "Jack: -- To do my job for me. It's done. We got the right guy.",
        "Holden: What if you got the wrong guy? What if the murderer is still out there?",
        "Jack: You're talking about Keith.",
        "Holden: He's dating my wife.",
        "Jack: Oh, okay, I see.",
        "Holden: No, you don't see. And if Keith did kill Julia, I want him to pay for it. And I sure as hell don't want him anywhere near my family!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Look at this.",
        "Keith: I can't believe you just found that. That's my little treasure box.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Keith: I buried that when I was a kid. I kept all my little secret things in there and I buried it up here so that nobody could get at it. Let me see this. Oh, yeah. Deck of cards. Pick a card, any card.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Keith: Let's see, what else do I -- oh. Here's my shooter.",
        "Lily: Shooter? Oh.",
        "Keith: I won this off this kid, jerry. I thought he was gonna beat me. This is my airplane.",
        "Lily: Cute.",
        "Keith: Well, you know, my first jet ride and the stewardess took me up to the cockpit and the pilot, he gave me this plane.",
        "Lily: Oh. Is that when you decided you wanted to learn how to fly?",
        "Keith: No, no. My uncle used to take me up in a crop duster, I was hooked then. But that was the first time I was ever on a jet.",
        "Lily: So, what else you got in there?",
        "Keith: Oh, just stuff.",
        "Lily: No, no, no, come on. Let me see. Let me see.",
        "Keith: No, just stop.",
        "Lily: I want to check it out. I want to see what kind of boy you were. Come on, I'm sure you were adorable. Let me see. That was yours, too?",
        "Keith: Sure was.",
        "Lily: So -- so, you were a scary little boy?",
        "Keith: I'm still scary.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Holden: She's not picking up.",
        "Rosanna: Craig, you should just get out of here while you still --",
        "Craig: I am not going to let James Stenbeck steal that little boy. I will do everything I can to get Cabot back and that's a promise.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Keith: I bought this knife when I was 14 years old. It was the summer that the insane asylum burnt down. They got all the inmates back, except this one guy. And he had run the local tavern and he had a string of brown-haired girls. And then one day -- one day, he just went cuckoo. They never told us kids what happened to those brown-haired girls. However, they looked for him all summer. They had the dogs up here. You could hear them yapping. I would sit up here with my knife waiting, listening for his footsteps, for his hand to grab me by the neck!",
        "[Lily screams]",
        "Lily: Oh, you're terrible!",
        "Keith: I am.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: She's with Keith. They took off together and I have no idea where.",
        "Carly: What? Don't look at me. I didn't know anything about it.",
        "Holden: But you know that she's been seeing him.",
        "Jack: So that's the issue? Right, Holden?",
        "Holden: The issue, Jack, is that he may be a murderer.",
        "Jack: Holden, come on.",
        "Holden: Just talk to Les.",
        "Jack: I know what he's gonna say. Holden, he's gonna say that he didn't do it. That's what they all say.",
        "Holden: Look, I know the guy's a punk, but I don't think that he's capable of murder.",
        "Carly: He tried to kill me.",
        "Holden: Carly, I'm not trying to minimize what you went through, but murder?",
        "Carly: He had his hands around my throat.",
        "Jack: And this conversation is over.",
        "Holden: Talk to Les.",
        "Jack: And what if I don't?",
        "Holden: Then I'll understand. It's okay. I'll just go to Tom.",
        "Jack: No, you're not gonna jam up my case. You got that? You keep your nose out of it. Just stay out of it, Holden. [Cell phone rings] Yeah? [Jack sighs] Yeah, okay, I'll be right there. I've got to get back to the station. Do you want me to give you a ride home?",
        "Carly: No. No, that's all right. I'll have some coffee.",
        "Jack: Do you think you can keep my wife company without making her want to throw a plate at you? I mean it, Holden. Stay out of it. Lay off the Les thing.",
        "Holden: Do you really think that I don't have any reason for concern here?",
        "Jack: No, what I'm saying is, find another way to make sure your wife isn't seeing anybody else.",

        "Casey: What lover?",
        "Celia: Is something burning?",
        "Casey: Damn.",
        "Celia: It's okay. It's just a little charbroiled. I like it like that.",
        "Casey: Well, I wanna know who's talking about me.",
        "Celia: Calm down.",
        "Casey: No. If someone's lying about me, I wanna know.",
        "Celia: It's just Lia.",
        "Casey: Lia?",
        "Celia: Yeah, she has a crush on you.",
        "Casey: Oh, her.",
        "Celia: Yeah, her.",
        "Casey: She's had a crush on me since, like, pre-K. It's nothing. Trust me.",
        "Celia: Good.",
        "Casey: Why, were you worried?",
        "Celia: A little.",
        "Casey: Don't worry, I'm not a player.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I would be better if -- oh, boy. Maybe it would be better if Rosanna never came back, but -- you know, logical -- logical doesn't always translate. It's not -- I don't know.",
        "Emily: That's what I'm trying to you. If you would just put yourself out there, it would prove to you that there are other women in the world, not just Rosanna.",
        "Paul: Right. Here's to the other fish in the sea. May they be fortunate enough to swim past my net?",
        "Emily: What, are you kidding me? You're a catch.",

        "Emily: Well, not now. Thanks a lot. But you will, and we used to have fun. We used to have a lot of fun together.",
        "Paul: Yeah, but you're married now.",

        "Rosanna: Well, at first I thought this was all about Barbara because he wanted me to get all the charges against her dropped, and I did. And then I thought it was about Paul because he forced me to leave him, and -- well, I thought he was using me to hurt his son. But then, suddenly, he asked me to marry me and set up house with him. And I thought, well, of course, it's ridiculous. But I had to along with it, because he said he said that he would disappear with Cabot if I didn't. But it was torture -- him lurching around, trying to woo me, so I tried to call Interpol --",
        "Craig: And he got wind of that?",
        "Rosanna: And that's when he stuck me in here and took off with Cabot. And I don't know what he's going to do now, and if I try to cross him, he's going to kill Cabot, I know he will.",

        "Jessica: And my client has every right to defend himself, Jack. He's been thrown in jail, denied bail, and why? Because he hurt your wife? Look, I'm not making excuses for his behavior in that instance, but I'm here to see that he's treated fairly regarding this murder charge. The state has no case and you know it.",

It's obvious how much that child loves him. And Keith has been terrific about letting him stay with us. I'm not saying that he's perfect. Maybe he has a bad temper. Maybe he's having some financial problems, but murder? Come on.",
