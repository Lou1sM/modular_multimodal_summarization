        "Gwen: \"We need to talk about the biology exam you missed. Come see me ASAP so we can go over your options for extra credit.\"",
        "Will: What did I do with it?",
        "Maddie: Gwen?",
        "Gwen: Hey, Maddie.",
        "Maddie: Hey. I need to talk to you.",
        "Will: Maddie! Hi. Did I, by chance, leave anything at the library?",
        "Maddie: Like what?",
        "Will: Like a biology book or something.",
        "Maddie: You know, I didn't see anything, no.",
        "Will: Oh, okay. Well, are you here to see me?",
        "Maddie: Actually, I came to talk to Gwen. But if you two are in the middle of something --",
        "Gwen: Actually, could we maybe meet later?",
        "Will: No, it's fine. Stay, talk. I'm gonna go get some studying done.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but -- Will, where are you going?",
        "Will: I gotta go study. I've got work to do. I'll see you later. Okay?",
        "Maddie: Gwen, you look worried. Did I interrupt something?",
        "Gwen: No, no, no. I just need to talk to Will, but it'll keep. What's going on?",
        "Maddie: Okay. Hypothetically -- are guys turned off by girls who make the first move?",
        "Gwen: Well -- whoa. I -- wait, did something happen with Casey?",
        "Maddie: He's repulsed by me.",

        "Casey: Dad, I need to talk.",
        "Tom: So you said. What's going on?",
        "Casey: Well --",
        "Tom: Oh, girl problems.",
        "Casey: Huge.",
        "Tom: Anything to do with Chicago?",
        "Casey: Chicago?",
        "Tom: Yeah, you know, you missed the bus, spent the night with Gwen.",
        "Casey: Well, I didn't spend the night with Gwen. I mean, yeah, we were together and it was night, but we didn't \"sleep together\" sleep together.",
        "Tom: Are you sure?",
        "Casey: You think I'm lying to you?",
        "Tom: Hey, Case --",
        "Casey: No! I called you guys like every minute to let you know where I was. I mean, what does it take?",
        "Tom: Okay. I'm sorry. I misunderstood.",
        "Casey: I need your help here, Dad. I don't need you on my case.",
        "Tom: Okay. And I happen to be in a very helpful mood. So what's going on?",
        "Casey: How do you say no to a girl?",

        "Librarian: Hey. Need help finding a book?",
        "Luke: Actually, I'm here for Jade Taylor. Well, I just need her mailing address. I want to send her this.",
        "Librarian: Oh, if you want to give that to Jade --",
        "Luke: Oh, well, if you don't want to give me the mailing address, you can send it. I mean, I'll give you money, of course. It's just that she was staying with my family, and then she moved, and she forgot --",
        "Jade: Luke, hi. You came to see me?",
        "Luke: I thought you left. What are you doing here?",
        "Jade: Where was I supposed to go? I didn't have any money.",
        "Luke: Well, anywhere but here.",
        "Jade: Well, see, the thing about here is I actually have a job. It's not much, but it's better than starting somewhere else on the couple of bucks your dad gave me.",
        "Luke: But you are leaving, right?",
        "Jade: Not anytime soon. Deal with it.",

        "Lily: Hi, sorry I'm late. How'd it go?",
        "Lucinda: Hi, honey. Hi, honey. I'm clean.",
        "Lily: Oh, that's the best news I've heard. That's wonderful.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, it is.",
        "Lily: Good.",
        "Lucinda: This thing -- you want to burn it, or shall I burn it?",
        "Lily: No, you do it.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, okay. I look okay?",
        "Lily: You look beautiful.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, thank you, honey. I beat it. [Lucinda laughing] I beat it. I knew I was going to stay on this earth long enough to raise my newest grandchild.",
        "Lily: I thought that was my job.",
        "Lucinda: You can help, darling. But, hey, if you want something done right --",
        "Lily: Are you saying I'm not a good mother?",
        "Lucinda: You're a wonderful mother. That's a silly question to ask. Of course, I'm better, but -- what's wrong?",
        "Lily: Come on, let's go celebrate your good news. Let's go, let's go. Come on.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no, no. I want to know what's made you lose your sense of humor. Oh, something more with wretched Jade and Luke?",
        "Lily: No, Jade's out of the picture.",
        "Lucinda: My heavens, it's a wonderful day all around.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucinda: Who dumped whom?",
        "Lily: Uh -- uh -- it turns out they weren't actually together. Can we go? Please?",
        "Lucinda: I thought you found them in flagrante delicto, baby.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: That's what they wanted me to think.",
        "Lucinda: I don't understand.",
        "Lily: They had a deal together that Luke would cover for Jade so she could stay in town and she would cover for Luke.",
        "Lucinda: Cover what?",
        "Lily: Can we talk about this another time? Please?",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I'm looking at you and you need to talk about it now. What is it? [Lily sighs] What?",
        "Lily: Luke thinks he's gay.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Ohh. Oh. Of course.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Jack, don't stick up for her. She is the one who started this mess by going through Nick's Jacket.",
        "Jack: This has nothing to do with Carly. That St. Christopher medal didn't just get up and walk out of the evidence locker on its own. Did it, Nick?",
        "Nick: Look, I'm not denying the fact that I have a medal that just looks like the one that went missing. But I'm not going to go in there and take it.",
        "Katie: If their grandfather gave all the boys in the family the same medal, then that explains everything.",
        "Nick: Yeah, Jack just thinks that's too much of a coincidence. Don't you, Jack?",
        "Jack: Well, since the medal happens to be a key piece of evidence in the murder charges against your cousin, no, coincidence doesn't cut it for me.",
        "Carly: What are you going to do?",
        "Katie: That's none of your business.",
        "Jack: Hey, wait a second. What happened here has nothing to do with Mike. That doesn't change anything for him. He's still a primary suspect in an ongoing murder investigation, and beating up on Carly isn't going to change any of that.",
        "Katie: Well, are you trying to get Mike convicted of this murder?",
        "Carly: No. I want Nick to stay out of Jack's case.",
        "Katie: What you want is your husband back, but you're stepping over two innocent guys to do it! And you're buying right into it, Jack!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: Listen, I'm not bothering anybody. I'm just trying to work a job and save up some money and put my life back together.",
        "Luke: How? By working another scam?",
        "Jade: It's called an honest job. You ever have one, rich boy? It's actually lucky Lily forced me into getting this job, because it turns out I like it.",
        "Luke: Yeah, right. So, um, where are you living?",
        "Jade: What's it to you?",
        "Luke: Well, you said you didn't have any money. Look, I just want to make sure that my mom steers clear.",
        "Jade: Lily could care less about where I'm staying.",
        "Luke: No, Jade, I'm serious. When she sees you, she gets really upset.",
        "Jade: Not as upset as she gets when she sees you. I bet every time you walk into a room, all she can think is, \"my baby boy is gay. What did I do to deserve this?\"",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: This doesn't surprise you about Luke?",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lucinda: Nope. Not really. Oh, get rid of this. Darling, nothing really computed in his -- lately -- you know, his -- silly boy, the drinking and the self-destructive behavior. And after you and Holden got back together, I would have thought that this kid would have been happy, or happier.",
        "Lily: I know, that's what I thought, too.",
        "Lucinda: And then, he was so secretive. Poor kid. And so protective of that boy -- is he the --",
        "Lily: Who, Kevin?",
        "Lucinda: Kevin. When I found them passed out at my place, Luke wasn't so worried about being punished, he was about never seeing that boy again.",
        "Lily: I didn't realize that.",
        "Lucinda: And, honey, all this stuff with Jade. I mean, I never -- why would Luke condone her lies? You know? Anyway. Okay, I think it's good. And I'm glad. I'm glad that we know what the kid has been going through. He told you himself?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucinda: That's good. Now, it's going to be better for you and better for him. All right? And do I look okay?",
        "Lily: You look great.",
        "Lucinda: Then let's go.",
        "Lily: Wait, wait, wait, wait. My son is gay. How can you be so calm?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: He obviously thinks I'm hideous, or ridiculous, or both.",
        "Gwen: No. No, no, no. He doesn't.",
        "Maddie: Well, I never should have kissed him like that.",
        "Gwen: Okay, well, you guys have kissed before.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, not like that. Okay, I probably did it all wrong, too. Who am I kidding, Gwen? I mean, I am not sexy enough for Casey Hughes.",
        "Gwen: Maddie, you're gorgeous.",
        "Maddie: I'm cute. And I'm perky. And worst of all, I have zero experience. And Casey knows that I don't know what I'm doing.",
        "Gwen: That is probably what he likes best about you.",
        "Maddie: How? Okay, before me, he only liked cool blondes with bad reputations who knew their way around the back seat of a car.",
        "Gwen: Oh, like -- like me?",
        "Maddie: No! I didn't mean like you. I meant like Lia. Like, ew, Lia. Or --",
        "Gwen: Maddie, its okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's there. Casey and I had a kid together. It's not exactly something that, you know, you can erase.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, now that you mention it.",
        "Gwen: Wait, is that -- is that why you're here? You think that Casey's backing away because of what happened with me?",
        "Maddie: I came to you because once upon a time, you and Casey had a thing. And that makes you an expert, kind of. And I'm a really good student. I can learn really quickly.",
        "Gwen: You want me to show you how to --",
        "Maddie: Gwen, please, I just need a clue. Okay? I need to know how to turn Casey on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: And you're trying to say no to --",
        "Casey: Maddie.",
        "Tom: So you're breaking up with her?",
        "Casey: No, I'm really into her, but I don't want to blow it. You know?",
        "Tom: No, I don't have a clue.",
        "Casey: Well, I was usually the one who pushed for more. You know?",
        "Tom: Keep talking.",
        "Casey: Well, it's like if a guy pushes and a girl says no, fine, whatever, you move onto the next one.",
        "Tom: Oh, so, that's how that whole thing works.",
        "Casey: Well, it used to and then, bam! There's Maddie. And she's, like, this totally different girl and it's different with her because I like her. You know? I wanna -- I want to keep things going with her.",
        "Tom: Okay, so you want to take this to the next step?",
        "Casey: It's like this. I've had some experience with stuff, but Maddie hasn't, and she's the one who wants to take it to the next step.",
        "Tom: And you don't?",
        "Casey: Of course, I do, Dad. She's hot.",
        "Tom: Okay --",
        "Casey: But I don't want to make a mistake by going too far too fast.",
        "Tom: Are you trying to score points here?",
        "Casey: With Maddie?",
        "Tom: No, with me and your mom, trying to show us how much you've changed and grown up so we'll ease up on the restrictions?",
        "Casey: That's what you think this is about?",
        "Tom: I think you'd do almost anything to get us to trust you again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You went hunting for that medal so you'd have an excuse to come to Jack!",
        "Jack: That's enough!",
        "Katie: No, but she is making this worse!",
        "Mike: Hey, hey! It's okay. All right, Nick's not in trouble. Right?",
        "Jack: Not yet.",
        "Carly: Thanks for defending me.",
        "Jack: I couldn't help myself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You think I'm making this stuff up? Like I would go out of my way to talk to my dad about not having sex with a girl?",
        "Tom: I want to believe that you've changed.",
        "Casey: And I want to believe that you've turned back into my dad. I mean, lately it's like you're Mr. D.A. all the time, treating me like I'm some criminal that's guilty of something. I mean, I know I've messed, but you know, I want to make things right with Maddie. And I'd really appreciate it if you would just --",
        "Tom: Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I mean that. Okay? You just -- you kinda caught me by surprise here.",
        "Casey: I'm trying to do right thing. You know? That's why I wanted to talk to you. I don't want to mess things up with Maddie like I messed things up with Gwen, you or Mom. I mean, the way she looks at me it's like I'm this great guy. It makes me want to be with her and everything, but she doesn't know as much about sex as I do.",
        "Tom: And what do you know?",
        "Casey: That sometimes, no matter how smart or careful you are, that bad things can happen. And, you know, I really like Maddie. I wouldn't want it to just be a one-night thing.",
        "Tom: You've come a long way, haven't you?",
        "Casey: It doesn't feel like it. I mean, before, when I was stupid, it was much easier. But now -- dealing with girls is really hard.",
        "Tom: Yeah, I've heard that.",
        "Casey: So, what do I do?",
        "Tom: Tell Maddie what you just told me. That you care about her and respect her and you don't want things to get out of control, and she'll understand.",
        "Casey: You don't know Maddie. I mean, she's smart and everything, but she doesn't get girl stuff. Like, she doesn't even know she's hot. What's up with that?",
        "Tom: You know, I don't know.",
        "Casey: So if I try to let her down easy, she'll think there's something wrong with her, that I'm not that into her.",
        "Tom: Or she maybe she'll be happy and relieved that you care enough about her to take things slowly.",
        "Casey: Maybe with another girl, but not with Maddie.",
        "Tom: No, I think you need to talk to her. I think she might just surprise you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Um, I'm not the one you should be talking to.",
        "Maddie: Yeah but, Gwen, you're my friend.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, but my experience with Casey isn't exactly something that I like to think about. You know, what happened to Casey and I, having a baby, neither of us was ready for --",
        "Maddie: I'm sorry -- I shouldn't have even brought that up -- it's just that -- I love him.",
        "Gwen: Maddie, and he is crazy about you.",
        "Maddie: See? That's it right there, that is the problem. He's crazy about me, he likes me a lot, he thinks I'm cute. I want more than that. Gwen, I want him to want me!",
        "Gwen: He will. Don't worry.",
        "Maddie: How can I not worry when obviously I'm doing something wrong and I don't even have a clue what it is? Why else would he walk away from me at the library?",
        "Gwen: Okay, here's a clue. You're at the library! It's not the most ideal place for making out.",
        "Maddie: Okay, that's what Casey said, too.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, you should believe him. Will and I tried. You know, you need to find a place that's private. And then you'll see how much he's into you.",
        "Maddie: Are you sure?",
        "Gwen: I'm positive.",
        "Maddie: Okay. So I'll find a place -- I'll make a list --",
        "[Maddie sighs]",
        "Gwen: Okay -- now I need to -- I kind of need to ask you something.",
        "Maddie: Okay. Hey, candles -- scented or unscented?",
        "Gwen: Scented. Did you know that Will missed his Bio test?",
        "Maddie: I think you should talk to Will about that.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. You're right. I'll do that.",
        "Maddie: Oh, I can get a cheap motel.",
        "Gwen: Okay, that's sleazy. Do you know why Will missed his test? Okay. Right, something I should probably talk to Will about.",
        "Maddie: Right. Gwen, I'm really glad that you're gonna go talk to Will. If Casey loved me a fraction as much as Will loves you -- well, I wouldn't be needing this list.",
        "Gwen: And make sure to put protection on your list.",
        "Maddie: Oh -- I don't even need to write that one down. That's top priority. All right, thank you. Thank you --",
        "Gwen: You're welcome. Okay --",
        "Maddie: Bye --",
        "Gwen: Bye \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: That woman makes me so angry! Why would she try to set Nick up again? Especially knowing what it will to do you.",
        "Mike: It's okay.",
        "Katie: What if Nick gets in trouble no",
        "Nick: I won't. Jack's got no proof.",
        "Katie: So you're not angry?",
        "Nick: I want to rip somebody's throat out. But I can't. Anything I say or do, Jack's going to get more suspicious. And at the end, it can hurt Mike.",
        "Mike: All right, I've had enough of this place.",
        "Nick: Let me go write a note to Hal, and then we can get out of here, okay?",
        "Katie: Are you sure you're not in trouble?",
        "Nick: That's why I'm gonna go cover my butt with the lieutenant. All right? Then we can go.",
        "Mike: It's okay.",
        "Katie: I was so happy when that St. Christopher medal went missing. Without it, they have no case against you. And then Carly had to butt her little nose in.",
        "Mike: Hey, calm down.",
        "Katie: Maybe I should just go to the gym and work off some of this frustration or something.",
        "Mike: I'd go with you, but I want to talk to Nick.",
        "Katie: About what?",
        "Mike: I want to make sure he's not more worried than he's letting on.",
        "Nick: Are you ready?",
        "Mike: Yeah.",
        "Katie: Actually, yeah, I am gonna go to the gym -- can you go with Nick back to the house -- I'll meet you guys there.",
        "Mike: Sure.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I know you're probably mad at me --",
        "Jack: Probably?",
        "Carly: But you know that Nick is the person who took that medal from the evidence room. If we can come up with some way --",
        "Jack: Stop, stop. My case against Mike is not your problem.",
        "Carly: But if I can help you --",
        "Jack: We have to stop doing this, Carly. We have to stop finding excuses to be in each other's lives.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Katie: You and I have a score to settle.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Mike: You think the only way to get me out of this is to steal evidence? You think I'm guilty, don't you?",
        "Gwen: How does it work if you don't ever tell me what you're thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Looking in Nick's jacket was my civic duty. It had nothing to do with you.",
        "Jack: Really? Nothing to do with me.",
        "Carly: Okay, a little. Okay, a lot. But I hate to see the way that this case is getting to you.",
        "Jack: Every case gets to me, Carly.",
        "Carly: No, not like this one. You don't believe that Mike killed that woman any more than I do. And there's nothing you hate more than seeing the wrong guy behind bars.",
        "Jack: You helping me. You helping me. I hate that more.",
        "Carly: It was an impulse. I saw his jacket there and I -- I'm sorry. And the next time, I promise you, Jack, I will think before I act.",
        "Jack: Well, how about you don't act at all?",
        "Carly: But --",
        "Jack: What happened -- what happened the last time you interfered in one of my cases, Carly?",

        "Mike: Maybe if Jack actually saw you wear it, he'd back off.",
        "Nick: I doubt that. But at least I got my clasp fixed.",
        "Mike: How did Carly get that medal from you?",
        "Nick: I went to Hal's house. And she showed up with her son. I helped her kid get a kite out of a tree.",
        "Mike: Do you wear it that often?",
        "Nick: Not since the clasp broke. You know, you're lousy at this.",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Nick: This trying to ease information out of me. Just ask me what you want to know.",
        "Mike: Did you take that St. Christopher medal out of the evidence room?",

        "Lucinda: I know, but darling you're trying to change years of traditional hopes and dreams for your kid into less traditional ones. And you can't accomplish that in a couple of weeks.",
        "Lily: It didn't take you very long.",
        "Lucinda: I'm flexible, baby, now. And also, I've had experience, I raised you. And for heaven's sake, do you think that your life -- your life is the life that I wanted for you? [Lucinda chuckles] But would I change you, would I change it? I wouldn't. I wouldn't -- not for anything.",
        "Lily: Thank you. What if Luke goes into the wrong place at the wrong time? He could get hurt.",

        "Lily: Grateful? Grateful, for this?",
        "Lucinda: Grateful because you are who you are and you can handle this. And he came out to you honestly. Also, he got Jade out of your house.",

        "Lucinda: I do think it's weird though that he would think that pretending to be a enamored of Jade would hurt you less than revealing he's gay. Don't prove him right about that.",

        "Jade: You are so lying.",
        "Luke: What do you even know about this? You don't know anything.",

        "Jade: But I bet it didn't exactly make it nice around the house when you came out of the closet.",
        "Luke: Yeah, like my life was so much better when I was pretending to be hooking up with you? I mean, regardless of what my parents think, I'm not upset that I told them the truth. However, I am upset that I ever got involved with you. Here's your stuff.",

        "Gwen: Nothing! What? You're mad at me because Casey fell asleep on my shoulder?",
        "Will: You could have told me!",

        "Gwen: Okay, so you just lock it all up inside, and I don't get to know what's real and what not. How is this gonna to work, Will? We're married. How does it work if you don't ever tell me what you're thinking?",

        "Will: I told you I didn't want to stay there.",
        "Gwen: No, then you said you changed your mind! We both decided it made sense to take the free room and board until we graduated and your mom gave you your trust fund!",
        "Will: But it isn't free, Gwen! Nothing is when you're dealing with my parents. Which is why I told you to stay away from them. And then you go and take this job with Casey that came straight from my mother!",
        "Gwen: What? You agreed to that, too! You can't do that, Will! You can't say that you're okay with everything, and then go ahead and wreck the whole deal by skipping out on tests and stuff.",
