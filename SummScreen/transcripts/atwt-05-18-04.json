        "Katie: Dr. Tanner called the police on Henry? Isn't that a little extreme?",
        "Nurse Showcroft: The man left a psychiatric hospital without being released, and he stole my employee I.D. to do so. Dr. Tanner was obligated to file a police report.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but Henry could be on the grounds right now. I mean, he loves the outdoors. He could be sitting under a tree communing with nature! Isn't it a little early to sic the dogs on him?!",
        "Nurse Showcroft: Ms. Frasier, you seem a bit agitated. Would you like me to speak to the doctor about adjusting your medication?",
        "Katie: No, no, no! I'm cool. I'm mellow. I'm sure wherever Henry is, he's doing just fine. Hi, Dylan.",
        "Dylan: Hi, Katie! This is my Mom.",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Mother: You must be special to rate that smile.",
        "Katie: Oh well, Dylan and I are pals. Right, buddy? He's very good at drawing birds -- he loves it. He even made me one to go in my room.",
        "Dylan: Katie's nice to me.",
        "Mother: Thank you.",
        "Katie: Oh, it's easy. Dylan's very cool. Listen, I was wondering -- could I borrow your cell phone? My brother, Henry, was visiting earlier. And we got in a fight. And, well, it's his birthday. So, I feel really bad.",
        "Mother: Oh, that's terrible.",
        "Katie: So, can I use your phone?",
        "Mother: I would -- but they confiscated it at the door.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cop: Doctor, this guy who escaped -- is he dangerous?",
        "Doctor: How can one tell? He's only been a patient for a short while. I do know one thing -- Henry is seriously delusional.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Russ: Why are you pretending to be a lawyer?",
        "Henry: I am a lawyer. And a very good one, if I do say so myself.",
        "Russ: Yeah, well, if you're so good, why were you hanging out with that crazy blonde who came after me with a baseball bat, huh? I'm calling a cop!",
        "Henry: Don't be so hasty, Russ. May I call you Russ?",
        "Russ: What do you want?",
        "Henry: Well, I just thought you could use a visitor, a pal.",
        "Russ: I don't have to talk to you. I've got rights!",
        "Henry: Do you have a clue? Here you are, locked up, looking at years of jail time for assault charges. Aren't you just a little bit curious? Don't you want an update on what's going on in the outside world? Maybe what your friend Pilar has been up to?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Where did you get this?",
        "Pilar: I didn't mean for you to see it.",
        "Mike: Well, that's obvious. Where did it come from? Who took this picture?",
        "Pilar: I did. Last night after we'd made love.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: But you saved the baby's life, Lucy. And Paul's. From all accounts, the fire was just out of control. If you hadn't acted quickly --",
        "Lucy: If I had listened to Daddy --",
        "Lucinda: Oh, I'm just so upset that you have to be disappointed by your father yet again.",
        "Lucy: I never should have believed him.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. Don't you do that? Don't you dare take this upon yourself. Sweetheart, please, I can't bear to see you so miserable. Why don't we call your Mom? You always feel so good after you talk to your mother.",
        "Lucy: Well, actually, I've been thinking -- you know, it's been a really hard year and --",
        "Lucinda: And what?",
        "Lucy: I thought it might be nice to spend time with Mom again.",
        "Lucinda: You want to visit her?",
        "Lucy: Well, except for you, there's really nothing left for me in Oakdale. So, I've decided to move back to Montega.",
        "Craig: No!",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: I can't believe it, it's finally official. Cabot is yours. You must have flipped when these people showed up with the adoption papers.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, I did.",
        "Jordan: This is great! Look at you, you're totally blown away. Well, I guess when you've been waiting for something for months and months to happen -- I'm really happy for you, Rosanna.",
        "Carly: I'm gonna give you guys some privacy.",
        "Jordan: We've got to celebrate. I am gonna order up the best bottle of champagne that the Lakeview has, my treat.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, I think you should hold off on that.",
        "Jordan: Is there a problem?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Jordan: Well, you told me that once you got the adoption papers, Cabot would be legally yours.",
        "Rosanna: Well, it turns out -- you have to sign them, too.",
        "Jordan: Me? Why do I have to sign anything?",
        "Rosanna: Because -- conditions have changed. You have to adopt Cabot, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mother: I wish I could help you. I could ask the nurse to let you use their phone.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, I already tried that. Nurse Showcroft doesn't really like me very much.",
        "Mother: She's kind of bristly. Dylan doesn't like her at all.",
        "Katie: Maybe there's another way. Hey, Dylan, can I borrow a piece of paper and a crayon?",
        "Dylan: Sure.",
        "Katie: Thank you. Maybe when you leave, you could give my brother Henry a call?",
        "Mother: Sure.",
        "Katie: Oh, great. Thank you so much. And don't be worried when they answer the phone. He's at the Oakdale Police Department.",
        "Mother: The police department? Why?",
        "Katie: He's -- interrogating a witness about a crime. So, just let them know to tell Henry that -- Henry Coleman -- that his sister Katie needs him desperately. He needs to come here.",
        "Mother: I'll call as soon as I leave.",
        "Katie: Okay. Thank you so much. Oh, Henry, please don't get caught.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Tanner: His name is Henry Coleman.",
        "Cop: Description?",
        "Dr. Tanner: He's tall -- I think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You know, I've been locked up recently. All alone, looking at those four concrete walls with \"I love Mona\" written on them. And you start to wonder -- who is Mona? Where can I get her number? What do you dream about, Russ?",
        "Russ: I got nothing to say to you.",
        "Henry: Why? Because Pilar is looking out for you?",
        "Russ: Why would she? She's my ex. We hate each other.",
        "Henry: Right. That's right. Now, you attacked her, and that's why you got arrested.",
        "Russ: Right.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on. Come on, Russ. We all know the attack was a fake, and that you and Pilar were working some kind of scam.",
        "Russ: You don't know anything.",
        "Henry: Yeah? Oh, really? How did she pitch this to you? I'm really curious. Was it something like -- \"oh, Russie-pooh, you know, don't worry. It will all be swell. You're just gonna spend a few days in a cage, until the D.A. and Mike and the cops all believe that I'm in mortal fear for my life.\" Is that how she played it for you?",
        "Russ: I'm going to be out of here real soon.",
        "Henry: Yeah, right. Hey, a few days have turned into weeks, Russ. When is she going to get you out?",
        "Russ: This is none of your business.",
        "Henry: Oh, come on, man. You have priors. You have parole violations. You're looking at what? I don't -- 15, 20 years?",
        "Russ: I'm not going down. She promised! I mean, my lawyer promised.",
        "Henry: Oh, man, you have been had, buddy boy. You have been had. While you're in here eating gruel and sharing showers with Bruno and Burto and Boris, that one, she is out there sharing showers with someone else. Hmm, Mr. Kasnoff?",
        "Russ: So -- so what?",
        "Henry: Oh, oh -- so you really -- you really do have something for her. That's so sweet. You know, I think we should sit down here, buddy boy. Because, it only gets worse.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: I didn't take it for show and tell, Michael.",
        "Mike: Then, why?",
        "Pilar: I wanted -- I don't know -- a lucky charm, I guess.",
        "Mike: A what?",
        "Pilar: I woke up in the middle of the night, and for the first time in ages, I felt safe. For the first time, no nightmares. I didn't feel the need to jump out of bed and check the doors and the windows to see if they were still locked.",
        "Mike: When you stayed here before --",
        "Pilar: I always felt afraid. At first, of Russ. And then --",
        "Mike: Katie?",
        "Pilar: That moment felt so good. I wanted it to last. I wanted to freeze it in time, feel that way forever. So --",
        "Mike: You took a picture.",
        "Pilar: I thought that maybe if I looked at it, I would remember and feel like I did last night. Like nothing could ever hurt me again.",

        "Carly: Hi. I'm here to see Barbara Ryan. Could you tell me how she's doing and if she can have visitors?",
        "Jennifer: Mom's doing very well.",
        "Carly: Oh, good hi. I'm glad to hear it. Do they know if the surgery was successful?",
        "Jennifer: The tumor is benign.",
        "Carly: Oh, Jennifer, that's wonderful.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, it is.",
        "Carly: Can she see?",
        "Jennifer: Well, they won't know until the swelling goes down. It might take a couple of days.",
        "Carly: Right. Well, I just came by to bring her some flowers. And I thought I'd pop in and visit her.",
        "Jennifer: Actually, Paul's in with her right now. And she's sleeping.",
        "Carly: Oh, okay. Well, I don't want to disturb her. Could you just see to it that she gets the flowers? And tell her I'll come by tomorrow and check on her. And if there's anything that I can do --",
        "Jennifer: Well, you know, since you offered -- tell me, how's your sister and her new husband?",

        "Jordan: No, no! I'm not signing anything.",
        "Rosanna: I know you're upset.",
        "Jordan: What are you trying to pull here, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: I didn't know anything about this.",
        "Jordan: You're the one who laid it all out. I marry you, you get the baby.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and I'm so grateful.",
        "Jordan: Oh, but not grateful enough to tell me that I would have to adopt him, huh? Or, did you just leave that out because you know I would never go for that?",
        "Rosanna: I didn't know anything about it!",
        "Jordan: Have them redo the papers and take my name off!",
        "Rosanna: Jordan, look, the deal is that Cabot has to be adopted by a mother and a father.",
        "Jordan: The deal with who?! I never agreed to any of this.",
        "Rosanna: I know. And I know you're upset. And I'm sorry. I know it's unfair. But, if I don't get you to sign these papers, they're going to come and they're gonna take Cabot away. And I can't survive that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: This is a private conversation, Craig.",
        "Lucy: I really don't want to talk to you right now.",
        "Lucinda: How did you know that we were in here, anyway?",
        "Craig: I saw the bat mobile parked across the street with Fenwick napping. Now, I think I'd like some time alone with my daughter.",
        "Lucinda: Come on, don't you see, she doesn't have anything to say to you. She's -- you've upset her quite enough already. She's told me all the sordid details on what you've been up to. Contemptible.",
        "Craig: I didn't do any --",
        "Lucinda: Kidnapping the baby?",
        "Craig: I didn't --",
        "Lucinda: Making a situation where Lucy has to choose between you and Rosanna? What on earth were you thinking of?",
        "Craig: I was thinking of getting my family back. All right? Now, do you want Lucy to go back to her Mother?",
        "Lucinda: If she wants to.",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, she's all I have.",
        "Lucinda: Whose fault is that?",
        "Craig: Will you go away and give me some privacy here?",
        "Lucinda: No, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Craig: Yeah, okay, of course. All right, well, let's do this then. If she wants me to stay, you go. If she doesn't want me to stay, then I will go. All right?",
        "Lucinda: Knock yourself out. Please.",
        "Craig: Yes. Lullaby -- we have to talk. Now, you can despise me. You can yell at me. You can spit at me. But first, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to tell your banshee Grandmother that this is okay. Hmm?",
        "Lucy: It's all right, Grandmother.",
        "Craig: I knew you couldn't stay mad at me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You know, it's happened to the best of us. Even me, you know? You meet a beautiful girl, you fall hard. And then she takes you to some one-horse town, and then she hooks up with some other honey and the next thing you know, you're looking at 25 years to life.",
        "Russ: I'm beating this rap!",
        "Henry: Why would Pilar let you do that and mess up her game? You get sent up, Kasnoff never learns the truth. And there's no upside to her for you getting out of here.",
        "Russ: But, I'm innocent! I didn't attack her. Oh, my God. It's not supposed to go down like this.",
        "Henry: I know, I know. I know. So let's just put on the brakes.",
        "Russ: All right, what are you offering?",
        "Henry: You tell me what I need to know. You tell me what Pilar is working out with Mike, I'll post your bail.",
        "Russ: Today?",
        "Henry: Within the hour. Or you could stay here, waiting for Pilar like you've been doing. And waiting. And waiting. And waiting. And waiting, until that big yellow bus from the Statesville prison comes by and just takes you away.",
        "Russ: That shows what you know. I'm not even goin' to trial!",
        "Henry: Says Pilar, huh? Yeah, well -- let me tell you something, Kemo-sabe. You know, the rumor is around town, that she and Kasnoff are making off for the Caribbean. Yeah. You know, there might even be like a tropical wedding in the future. I think they're gonna leave this town, and you, and never look back for one moment.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Tanner: Hair color? Hmm -- well, I wouldn't call it brown. But then, I wouldn't call it blonde, either.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Buddy, bottom line is, I am here. Pilar is not. Just tell me what I want to know, and you know what? By tonight, you could drinking some beers. Maybe even enjoying some female companionship. But if you count on Pilar -- I'm telling you --",
        "Cop #1: You Henry Coleman?",
        "Henry: Yes.",
        "Cop #1: Someone called here with a message for you.",

        "Pilar: I guess you needed it as much as I did.",
        "Mike: Look, you're a beautiful woman. All right? I care about you. But I'm -- I'm not ready for anything.",
        "Pilar: Michael, I'm not ready for more, either.",
        "Mike: I just -- I don't know how far it will go.",
        "Pilar: I'm not asking for promises. Maybe we'll never make love again. Maybe we will. But I won't be confused about why it happened. We needed each other. We reached out to each other, and I'm thankful. I don't need to push for more.",

        "Carly: I don't think discussing Rosanna's marriage with you is such a good idea.",
        "Jennifer: Why? Do Jordan and Rosanna have something to hide?",
        "Carly: Why do you say that?",
        "Jennifer: The marriage isn't real, Carly. Can't be. The morning of the wedding, Jordan, he came to me. He told me that he had made mistakes. That Rosanna was out of his life. And then hours later, he was suddenly married to her. And I saw him afterwards. He did not look happy, Carly. So, something is going on -- something that I don't understand.",
        "Carly: You're reading things into this that just aren't there.",
        "Jennifer: Look, Jordan said the marriage was not what it seems, Carly. I know that he was trying to tell me that there's still hope for us.",
        "Carly: If he said that to you --",
        "Jennifer: No, he said it.",
        "Carly: If Jordan gave you hope -- I'm sorry, Jennifer, but it's false hope. No matter how he feels about their marriage, as far as Rosanna is concerned, it's for real and it's for keeps.",

        "Rosanna: Neither do I. But do you want me to lose Cabot?",
        "Jordan: No, of course not.",
        "Rosanna: Well, then, sign the papers.",
        "Jordan: Sure. As long as you can tell me that it's temporary. Okay, here's the deal. I'll sign these adoption papers, and then we get an annulment. And then we draw new papers up that give you sole custody of Cabot. Okay? What's the problem?",
        "Rosanna: It's not insurmountable.",
        "Jordan: I asked what the problem was.",
        "Rosanna: We can't get an annulment. Not yet.",
        "Jordan: Why not?",
        "Rosanna: Because, according to the adoption agreement, custody of Cabot isn't finalized until after we've been married two years.",

        "Jennifer: And you think I don't know? Carly, my first boyfriend died in a car crash. I broke Bryant Montgomery's heart, and since then I've had my heart broken at least half a dozen times. I know all the lines, all the games. Jordan is not playing me.",
        "Carly: Okay, maybe the guy meant what he said when he said it. But that was before he put a ring on my sister's finger. The fact is, Jordan and Rosanna are married. You're gonna have to accept that and move on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Do you see? The way it's written, we're locked in for two years.",
        "Jordan: Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Rosanna: I'm not! Until the papers were delivered today, I expected to be Cabot's only parent! That's what I wanted. That was supposed to be the deal.",
        "Jordan: The deal? The deal with who? This mysterious, powerful guy. Who is this guy, Rosanna?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. The only person that I've been dealing with is, Annabelle Fettle, a representative. The other side of the adoption is closed.",
        "Jordan: Yeah? And that other side is controlling my life. It's deciding who I should marry, when I should marry, that I should adopt a baby, and I have no idea who he is or why! Why me? Why now? What am I supposed to do next?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. I don't know. But whatever you want, I'll give it to you. Just tell me what you need.",
        "Jordan: I need answers, Rosanna. That's what I need.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, I'll give -- I'll give you answers. I'll find out who this person is and what they want. And why they're doing it to you. I'll find out everything. And once Cabot's adoption is secured, I will tell you.",
        "Jordan: And I'm just supposed to commit two years of my life based on the hope that you're gonna find out who did this to us? And when you do, that there will be a way out of this? I'm sorry, Rosanna. I can't do it.",
        "Rosanna: You know what? After all we've been through, this is just one little thing. Sign the papers, and we'll figure out the rest.",
        "Jordan: No. It's just one thing after another, and another and another. If I don't sign, you lose your son. If I do sign, I don't stay with you for two years, you'll lose your son. What's next? What am I supposed to do?",
        "Rosanna: Just -- just sign the papers so I can keep Cabot, and we'll figure out a loophole.",
        "Jordan: And what if you can't? What about Cabot?",
        "Rosanna: Then we're keeping him safe.",
        "Jordan: It's my name, Rosanna, on adoption papers. That makes me that child's father forever. What if something happens to you?",
        "Rosanna: I've already provided for that. Cabot would go to Jack and Carly.",
        "Jordan: Oh, yeah, that's great. That's great. And what happens when Cabot has questions about where he came from?",
        "Rosanna: Well, we'll tell him the truth.",
        "Jordan: Oh, the truth? Yeah, okay, that will be really great. \"Well, let's see, kid. You never really knew who your real dad was, and your mom basically sold you. And you did have an adoptive dad for a little while, but you don't want to know who he was. And yeah, sure, sure, I raised you for a couple of years, but I never really wanted to. I just was trying to make Rosanna and some mysterious stranger happy.\"",
        "Rosanna: Cabot will be loved. He will have everything he needs.",
        "Jordan: Take it from somebody who knows. What he'll have is questions -- questions for the rest of his life. And you want me to be a part of that? I'm not gonna stay with you for two years. I am not going to be some kid's dad and then walk away from him.",
        "Rosanna: I swear, you won't have to do that. I swear, I just -- sign the papers, and we'll figure a way out. This is just for the time being, okay? Just buying time. Please?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: What the hell do you think you're doing, threatening me like that?",
        "Russ: It got you down here, didn't it?",
        "Pilar: It's not safe for us to be seen together. Didn't we agree that you'd sit tight while I worked on Michael?",
        "Russ: Yeah, and how long is that supposed to go on?",
        "Pilar: Once I have the plan in place --",
        "Russ: Yeah, I heard about your plans -- how you're taking off to some island with Kasnoff, and you're just gonna leave me hanging! Well, you can just forget about that, 'cause it's never gonna happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Henry, what are you doing?!",
        "Henry: Boy, did I miss this place. I never thought I'd say that.",
        "Katie: You need to get out of these clothes now. They know that we stole the I.D. They've been looking all over for you. Dr. Tanner even went to the police.",
        "Henry: I know. I dodged him. Don't worry about it. I even got past the front desk, so we're home free.",
        "Katie: Okay, still, well, just get rid of these clothes now.",
        "Henry: Okay. Don't you want to hear about Russ?",
        "Katie: You spoke to him? What did he say about Pilar? Never mind! Just get out of these clothes! Hurry, get rid of them!",
        "Henry: Okay. Whoa, easy, easy, easy! Hey, don't sully the whites here! Um, listen -- whoa, wait a second! I am a physician, okay, with degrees from Harvard, Yale and Johns Hopkins, and I will not be treated in this manner!",
        "Dr. Tanner: Henry, you've been misbehaving.",
        "Nurse Showcroft: You defaced my badge!",
        "Henry: Well, yeah. It didn't -- it didn't really do you justice, that picture. I'm sorry. You know, the photographic technique was just awful. It was horrible. But you know what? Thanks for the loan. I had a wonderful walk around the grounds. I feel very invigorated. I want to take a little swim now, I think. Toodles.",
        "Dr. Tanner: You've caused us a great deal of trouble, Henry. You'll have to be punished.",
        "Henry: You know, tough love is overrated.",
        "Dr. Tanner: Guards, take him to the alone room.",
        "Henry: No, not solitary. Not -- I'm a people person, guys.",
        "Dr. Tanner: You'll have all privileges suspended until you get with the program.",
        "Henry: Can't we talk about this?! I make a mean martini! Can we do dinner?",
        "Dr. Tanner: And now you, Ms. Frasier.",
        "Katie: Yes, doctor?",
        "Dr. Tanner: Complicity in another patient's escape is a very serious matter.",
        "Katie: Yes, doctor.",
        "Dr. Tanner: I'd hate to report this to the court, opening you up to criminal charges. I'd prefer to settle this between us.",
        "Katie: Sure. Me, too.",
        "Dr. Tanner: So tell me, did Mr. Coleman succeed?",
        "Katie: At what?",
        "Dr. Tanner: Whatever you two were hoping to accomplish with his escape.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucy: Okay. Daddy, we'll do this one more time.",
        "Craig: That's my girl!",
        "Lucy: You'll do whatever I ask?",
        "Craig: Why do I get the feeling I'm about to be hit up for something big? You want Aaron back? Done. You want a sport car? Maybe. But I am a constantly changing, evolving man, so sweetness, name your terms.",
        "Lucy: Let me go. Can you do that, for me?",
        "Craig: You set me up. You just want to leave me cold turkey? You know how dangerous I am when I'm unattended, huh? So is this -- is this a trick? I say yes, you say you'll stay? Is that what this is?",
        "Lucy: And just take care of you? You're the father. The taking care of part, that's your job.",
        "Craig: Well, I can do it a lot better if you move home with me to Fairwinds. That's what you're looking for, isn't it -- home? You don't have to go to another country, sweetness. Home is always right here with me.",
        "Lucy: Just let me go.",
        "Craig: Let me get one thing straight, okay? You were never last. You were always like breath, like sky. And maybe I got a lot of things wrong. But I know that the best thing that I am is your father, and no one will ever love you as much as I do.",
        "Lucy: Hello? Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was my mother's private line. This is Lucy. Is she there? Yes, well, could you just tell her I called?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: Who said anything about going to the Caribbean? Who have you been talking to?",
        "Russ: Are you taking off or not?",
        "Pilar: Of course not! I am still working on Michael, and I am almost there.",
        "Russ: You have been almost there for weeks!",
        "Pilar: I promised to take care of you, and I will. But I already took one big risk today going out to Deerbrook to see Katie, and I shouldn't be seen with you. Don't call me again.",
        "Russ: Hold it. You didn't answer my question. How long?!",
        "Pilar: Don't push me.",
        "Russ: Hey, you can shove the attitude, lady. You get me out of here, now, and you deliver the money you promised, or I start spilling my guts.",
        "Pilar: That would be stupid. The police and the D.A. will never believe you.",
        "Russ: Yeah, you're right. That's why my first call is gonna be to your boyfriend, Michael.",

        "Mike: Hey!",
        "Katie: Have you ever tried this in dirt? It doesn't work quite as well.",
        "Mike: Dirt angels. Only you, Katie.",
        "Mike: Margo, its Mike. Hey, I was wondering, have you heard how Katie's doing? Yeah, it's probably too soon. A message? Uh, no, it's probably better to make a clean break, right? Thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dr. Tanner: You can do yourself a lot of good by cooperating.",
        "Katie: There's really nothing to tell, doctor. I'm kind of tired. Can I go back to my room?",
        "Dr. Tanner: Very well. I'll have a little chat with your personal therapist. You can trust that we'll be discussing this matter again. In the meantime, you are to have absolutely no contact with your friend, Henry. Understood?",
        "Katie: Nurse Showcroft?",
        "Nurse Showcroft: It's time to go back to your room.",
        "Katie: How's Henry? Is he okay?",
        "Nurse Showcroft: If you truly cared about him, you should have told us where he was. Actions have consequences, Ms. Frasier. Now, do I need to call the security guards back to take you to your room?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Carly, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but I'm going to take your advice in the spirit in which it was given.",
        "Carly: And how's that?",
        "Jennifer: You're looking out for Rosanna, furthering her agenda. You don't care about my feelings, or Jordan's.",
        "Carly: I'm just trying to be straight with you, Jennifer. You know what a good guy Jordan is. Guys like that don't break their marriage vows. Just don't set yourself up to be disappointed. Jordan is going to honor his vows and stay married to my sister.",
        "Jennifer: After the tricks that you and Rosanna pulled to rope him into that marriage? I don't think so. Thanks for the advice, Carly, but I'm going to get my answers from Jordan.",

        "Rosanna: Would you like to hold him?",
        "Jordan: Don't try to manipulate me with the baby.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry, but he's all I have. The birth mother is gone now. So if he gets taken away, he's going to go to somebody that he doesn't know. You've experienced that. Can you let it happen to him?",
        "Jordan: You wanted time. You've got it. Two weeks -- two weeks, Rosanna, and I am out of here.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Molly: You put your partner in danger, Dusty. It's time to let them know exactly what's going on.",
        "Lucy: Aaron, I'm about 16 seconds away from having a total nervous breakdown. I can't do this anymore! I just can't!",
        "Carly: You got a problem. I talked to Jennifer last night. She's not giving up on Jordan -- not by a long shot."
