        "Katie: Hey, you're up.",
        "Mike: Well, so are you.",
        "Katie: I was just waiting for the coffee to brew. I was going to bring you some in bed.",
        "Mike: Oh, thank you.",
        "Katie: Why are you dressed?",
        "Mike: It's late. Why are you still in your pajamas?",
        "Katie: I called in sick to work.",
        "Mike: Are you? What's wrong?",
        "Katie: Nothing you can't fix.",
        "Mike: Oh, I get it.",
        "Katie: So I told a little white lie so we could spend the day together. What? What's the problem? You got something better to do?",
        "Mike: No, definitely not something better. But I kind of made plans.",
        "Katie: Mike!",
        "Mike: You should've told me you were staying home today! I told Nick I'd go fishing with him.",
        "Katie: Fishing?",
        "Mike: Yeah, fishing.",
        "Katie: Since when do you fish?",
        "Mike: I fish.",
        "Katie: Oh, okay. Whose idea was this?",
        "Mike: Nick's just trying to take my mind off things.",
        "Katie: Doesn't he know that's my job?",
        "Mike: I'll make it up to you later, I promise.",
        "Katie: Oooh, I can't wait. There's nothing sexier than a man coming home smelling like trout.",
        "Mike: I'll let you wash it off me.",
        "Katie: That's an idea I can get behind.",
        "Mike: All right, you're not mad?",
        "Katie: No, I think it'll be good for you and Nick to spend some time together.",
        "Mike: We used to go fishing all the time when we were little kids. It'll be fun.",
        "Katie: And it'll give you a chance to talk, too. Maybe find out what's behind the st. Christopher medal.",
        "Mike: You're not starting to suspect he took it, are you? Since when?",
        "Katie: I'm not suspecting. I'm just, you know, wondering.",
        "Mike: Come on, you used to be his biggest supporter --",
        "Katie: I know. That hasn't exactly changed. It's just --",
        "Mike: Whoa, whoa, whoa, come on. What happened? Has somebody been planting doubts in your head?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hello? Is anybody home?",
        "Gwen: Carly. Sorry, hey.",
        "Carly: Hi. I was just dropping something off for you. I didn't think I'd catch you.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I had a free period this morning. We're going to go over in about a half hour. I just have to finish up some dishes.",
        "Carly: Would you like some help?",
        "Gwen: No, no, I'm almost done.",
        "Carly: This is what I brought for you.",
        "Gwen: What is it?",
        "Carly: Open the bag and find out.",
        "Gwen: Oh, wow. Wow, you got this for me?",
        "Carly: I made that for you.",
        "Gwen: It's amazing. I love it.",
        "Carly: Do you like it?",
        "Gwen: Yeah!",
        "Carly: I felt so badly about missing your big number at Crash. So I made you this dress so you can wear it at your next big gig.",
        "Gwen: No, that's incredible. I mean, you didn't have to do this.",
        "Carly: Yeah, I did. I realized that I've been spending way too much time doing the things I'm not supposed to and not nearly enough time focusing on the people that really count. Like you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: We didn't have the last one on your list, but here are the rest.",
        "Will: Thanks.",
        "Jade: So either you are a Biology nut or you have a lot of studying to do.",
        "Will: Well, I've got a ten-page paper to write and I don't even know what it's going to be about.",
        "Jade: Lucky you.",
        "Will: Yeah, better part is that it's due tomorrow.",
        "Maddie: Oh, great, I finally found you.",
        "Will: Maddie, now is really not a good time. I'm in serious crunch mode.",
        "Maddie: So am I.",
        "Will: Do you see these books? They're not for pleasure reading.",
        "Maddie: I just have to talk to you about something. I need, like, two seconds.",
        "Will: Okay, about what?",
        "Maddie: Am I hot?",
        "Will: What?",
        "Maddie: Attractive, sexy, hot. Am I hot? I mean, I need to know. Please be honest with me. Am I the type of girl that you would sleep with?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: What a glorious day.",
        "Dusty: Summer's coming early this year.",
        "Jennifer: The sooner the better.",
        "Dusty: Well, I'm in no rush. I want things to go nice and slow for a while.",
        "Jennifer: Does that mean that you are content with the way things are right now, Mr. Donovan?",
        "Dusty: At the moment, I don't think life can offer anything more perfect.",
        "Jennifer: Neither do I.",
        "[Johnny laughs]",
        "Dusty: Johnny agrees, too.",
        "[Jennifer giggles]",
        "Jennifer: Well, we could stay here all day if we wanted to, because I packed sandwiches. We could have a picnic.",
        "Dusty: You did?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. Okay, you're crazy if you think I didn't notice that.",
        "Dusty: Notice what?",
        "Jennifer: You checking your watch like you've got someplace to be.",
        "Dusty: No, I didn't.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, you did. You don't have to work, do you? Because you promised. You said no work for a week.",
        "Dusty: No work. I've just got to take care of a little something. I can meet you back here.",
        "Jennifer: A little something, like what?",
        "Dusty: You don't want to know. It's going to spoil your day.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, now you have to tell me.",
        "Dusty: No, trust me.",
        "Jennifer: Hey, you trust me and tell me where you think you need to be.",
        "Dusty: Emily's getting out of the hospital today. She's going to be arraigned in about an hour.",
        "Jennifer: And you feel you need to be there?",
        "Dusty: I need to be there to make sure she gets locked up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I don't know about this, Henry.",
        "Henry: Do you trust me?",
        "Emily: Do you want the honest answer or the polite answer?",
        "Henry: Okay, can you pretend to trust me? Because I promise you, this is going to work.",
        "Hal: Coleman, what are you doing here?",
        "Henry: I'm just visiting a friend. You keep trying to make that against the law.",
        "Hal: In your case, I wish I could. Good morning, Emily.",
        "Emily: Unless you're here to drop the charges against me, I really don't see what's so good about it.",
        "Hal: I'm sorry that I have to do this.",
        "Emily: Are you? Really? Or are you secretly thrilled that you get to see me get what's coming to me?",
        "Hal: Just the opposite, believe me.",
        "Emily: Yeah, right. So where's the police escort, hmm? Is there a swat team waiting for me down the hall?",
        "Hal: No, it's just me. I will be escorting you by myself.",
        "Henry: Is that supposed to make her feel better?",
        "Hal: Coleman, you stay out of this, because the only reason you're not going to jail with her is because she refuses to name you as an accomplice. Now I have to cuff you. Sorry. It's protocol.",
        "Emily: Yeah, what a surprise, Mr. By-the-book.",
        "Hal: All right, let's go, come on.",
        "Cass: Not so fast, Lieutenant.",
        "Henry: Finally. What took you so long?",
        "Hal: Cass Winthrop. Look, if you're here as Emily's attorney, you've wasted a trip. You can talk to her at the police station once she's been processed.",
        "Cass: I'll talk with her right here, if you don't mind. My client's not going anywhere.",
        "Hal: Listen, Winthrop, I'm a patient man, but my patience is running out. And I'm not about to stand here and listen to some slick speech about the violation of your client's rights. The department has given Emily ample time to heal from her wounds. And even though we could've insisted she be treated in a state facility, we generously allowed her to stay here.",
        "Cass: And we really appreciate that. But there are other mitigating circumstances.",
        "Hal: If you're talking about her pregnancy, that's been taken into consideration as well. She will be carefully monitored the entire time she's in custody. But if you're lobbying to keep her here indefinitely --",
        "Cass: I don't need to do any lobbying. I have a court order.",
        "Hal: When did you get this?",
        "Emily: What does it say?",
        "Cass: Your arraignment is postponed.",
        "Hal: On what grounds?",
        "Cass: So that the judge can have a chance to consider an insanity adjudication.",
        "Hal: You've got to be kidding me!",
        "Cass: Do I look like I'm kidding? I think you'll find it's all in order.",
        "Hal: Don't get your hopes up about this. This is just going to delay things. You're still going to prison.",
        "Cass: But not today. So would you kindly remove those handcuffs?",
        "Emily: Thank you.",
        "Tom: Oh, good, I'm glad I caught you before you left.",
        "Emily: What are you doing here?",
        "Tom: I brought Daniel. I thought it would be better for him to say good-bye to you here, rather than the police station.",
        "Emily: Daniel's here?",
        "Tom: He's outside with your mother. How much time before the arraignment?",
        "Hal: More than you think.",
        "Tom: What is this?",
        "Cass: It's a court order for postponement to consider an insanity adjudication. I'm just waiting on a call from the judge.",
        "Tom: Well, I was hoping you wouldn't resort to something like this, Emily. I guess you're just going to make it ugly for everybody.",
        "Hal: You're wasting your breath, Tom. Emily obviously thinks she can actually beat this by pleading insanity.",
        "Emily: No, that's not what I'm trying to do.",
        "Cass: Emily, let me handle this.",
        "Emily: No, I need to make this very clear to everyone. I can't let them think that I'm not capable of taking responsibility for what I did.",
        "Cass: Emily, please.",
        "Henry: Listen to your lawyer, Em. It's what you're paying him for.",
        "Emily: No. Henry, I know I did horrible things, I know that. I can't pretend I didn't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Do you really want to put yourself through this again? Seeing Emily again?",
        "Dusty: I want to know she's going to jail.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then you don't have to worry, because my dad's going to make sure that that happens. And in the meantime, you don't need to put yourself through that pain again. Why would you do that? You promised me that you were going to try to put this behind you.",
        "Dusty: I know. You know, when I was chained up, most of the time I didn't know whether it was night or day?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I know.",
        "Dusty: And I remind myself of that because, you know, I don't want to die anytime soon. So when a person who almost kills me is going to go to court for it, I need to be there.",
        "Jennifer: I'm not going to be able to talk you out of this, am I?",
        "Dusty: No. Tell me you get it. Who are you calling?",
        "Jennifer: The sitter, so she can stay with Johnny. Because I'm going with you. We're going to close the door on Emily together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Whoa, Maddie, you can't ask me stuff like that. It's weird.",
        "Maddie: It's a simple question. Am I hot enough for you to want to sleep with me?",
        "Will: I can't answer that. I'm married!",
        "Maddie: I'm not asking if you actually want to sleep with me, I'm just seeing if you would.",
        "Will: What's the difference?",
        "Maddie: I'm talking in the abstract. Okay, let me go back a little bit. So lately, Casey and I have been getting a lot closer and I've been wanting to, you know, take it to the next level.",
        "Will: You mean have sex.",
        "Maddie: Yeah. That.",
        "Will: So what's the problem?",
        "Maddie: That's what I'd like to know.",
        "Will: Wait, so you're saying --",
        "Maddie: Exactly.",
        "Will: -- That Casey doesn't want to? Because I can't believe that.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, believe it.",
        "Will: Okay, so what happened?",
        "Maddie: Okay, so I was talking to Gwen about it and she had pointed out that Casey and I haven't had many opportunities to be alone together. So I decided to make that priority number one. So I found out that Lisa was going out of town for a few days and, well -- you know I'm living with Lisa now, right?",
        "Will: Right, right, yeah.",
        "Maddie: So I thought to myself, \"perfect. Here's my chance.\" I got the room all nice and super-romantic. Candles, everything. So then Casey came over and one thing leads to another. And it was just heading, you know, in the right direction. And then all of the sudden, Casey just sits up, gives me this really weird look and is out the door.",
        "Will: What did he say to you?",
        "Maddie: Nothing. That's what's so weird. He just picked up and left.",
        "Will: I'm sorry, Maddie. That's not Casey.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, tell me about it. I just -- I wish I knew what I did wrong.",
        "Will: You probably didn't do anything wrong.",
        "Maddie: Well, then why else would he leave? I mean, we both know he's not a virgin. Sorry. I don't mean to bring up a sore subject, but we know he's been with a girl before.",
        "Will: Yeah. We know that.",
        "Maddie: So I came to the conclusion that he doesn't like me.",
        "Will: Maddie, you're crazy. He's -- he's crazy about you.",
        "Maddie: Obviously not enough. I don't know. Maybe I should just cut my hair and dye it blonde. Guys obviously seem to like that. You do.",
        "Will: Yeah, that's why I'm working my butt off and I'm buried in schoolwork because I'm attracted to a hairdo.",
        "Maddie: Oh, I know that that's not the only reason why you love Gwen, it's just -- Will, I feel like such a loser. I mean, you're his friend. Tell me what I should do.",
        "Will: Trust me, Maddie. I'm the last person you should be asking for romantic advice.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: Will and I had our first real fight since we got married.",
        "Carly: Oh, I'm sorry. That first one is always tough.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, we -- we talked it through and made up and all.",
        "Carly: But --",
        "Gwen: But I still think he's hung up about Casey and me working together.",
        "Carly: You mean he's jealous?",
        "Gwen: Yeah, can you believe it?",
        "Carly: Well, that depends. Does he have a reason to be?",
        "Gwen: No! Of course not. I mean, Casey -- Casey and I, we're friends. We had to go to Chicago. We had to find these bands for the club. We missed the bus. We ended up having to spend the night.",
        "Carly: And so Will just started thinking the worst.",
        "Gwen: Yeah. And I mean, we -- we did clear it up, but I still think that he still gets jealous every time I've got to do something with Casey.",
        "Carly: Well, I can sympathize with that. Jack doesn't even live with me anymore, and he still turns absolutely green whenever he sees me anywhere near Nick.",
        "Gwen: What do you do about it?",
        "Carly: I try to avoid Nick when I can.",
        "Gwen: Well, I can't really avoid Casey. We work together.",
        "Carly: Maybe you ought to rethink that and find another job. Unless you want your marriage to end up like mine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: All right, I admit, I had a conversation with Carly about Nick.",
        "Mike: Carly?",
        "Katie: I know, I know, consider the source. But she said a lot things that made sense.",
        "Mike: Come on, you know much Carly hates Nick. She blames him for her marriage falling apart.",
        "Katie: I know. I know. So, every word out of her mouth could have just been her trying to get back at him. But I don't know -- a couple things got me thinking.",
        "Mike: Like what?",
        "Katie: Like the fact that Nick would cut off his arm for you. And you would do the same for him. That's just how close you two are. So if he thought you were in really, really bad trouble and there was no other way out -- would he draw the line at breaking the law? I don't know.",
        "Mike: Look -- okay, if he were gonna break the law, he wouldn't be so stupid about it. He wouldn't just blatantly steal from the evidence room when he knows that he's the first person people are going to suspect.",
        "Katie: I know, but people do stupid things for noble reasons.",
        "Mike: He told me to my face he didn't do it. I believe him. The one he has is his.",
        "Katie: You're positive?",
        "Mike: I was with him when he took it to the jewelers to get it fixed.",
        "Katie: That doesn't prove anything.",
        "Mike: You know what, baby? Let this go. I need you to believe in Nick as much as I do.",
        "Nick: All right, you ready to hit the lake? Oh -- you guys are talking about me. Am I causing trouble for you two again?",
        "Mike: You're not causing trouble.",
        "Nick: But you would tell me if I were, wouldn't you?",
        "Katie: Of course.",
        "Nick: Listen, I get it. You guys just got married. You want the place to yourself and no annoying houseguests.",
        "Mike: You're not a houseguest. You're family. You're always welcome here. Isn't that right, baby?",
        "Katie: Absolutely. So, you guys go have fun. Bring back dinner. I'll get the frying pan ready.",
        "Mike: Okay? All right, let's go. We won't be long.",
        "Katie: Okay. I'll just cuddle up with Snickers and watch some movies.",
        "Nick: All right, I'll see you later, Katie.",
        "Katie: All right, mister, looks like it is just you and me. Whoa, whoa, hey! Relax, relax! What is your problem? Look what you made me do, Snick.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I don't know. I think quitting my job is a little extreme.",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right. You and I are in completely different situations. With Jack and me, I was so obviously wrong. But you haven't done anything wrong, have you?",
        "Gwen: No. No, not that I know of.",
        "[Gwen remembering]",
        "Gwen: Casey? Casey, wake up. I think they're closing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gwen: I love Will, Carly. He's my whole world.",
        "Carly: Well, then you don't have anything to worry about.",
        "Gwen: I hope so. Want some?",
        "Carly: Yeah, thanks. You seem at home here.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, that's part of the problem. It drives Will crazy that it's so comfortable in a place he can't stand living.",
        "Carly: Because of how he feels about his family.",
        "Gwen: He hates them.",
        "Carly: Even Hal? I thought he and Hal were pretty close.",
        "Gwen: Well, hate's too strong of a word for Hal, but -- he doesn't trust his father. He doesn't want to take anything from him.",
        "Carly: So he resents having to live here.",
        "Gwen: Big time. But unfortunately, staying here is the only way that we can finish school.",
        "Carly: Well, then it is absolutely the right thing to do.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I mean, as long as we can hold it together and Will doesn't start giving up on our marriage.",
        "Carly: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Gwen: If it happened to you, it can happen to anyone. I mean, you and Jack loved each other so much.",
        "Carly: And if love were all it took, then Jack would be back home with me and the kids. I guess it proves that what they say is true. Sometimes love isn't enough.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: Look, you're married. You and Gwen are happy. So, obviously you know what you're doing.",
        "Will: It doesn't mean I'm ready to give somebody advice.",
        "Maddie: Well, somebody has to help me figure this out. I mean, everybody's always saying how women are this big mystery, and it's obvious what guys want. Well, you know what, I have no clue what the deal is with Casey. He's the mystery. I'm the open book.",
        "Will: All I know is, Casey's really into you, and if he's hesitating, then maybe he's just second guessing what he thinks you want.",
        "Maddie: Maybe --",
        "Will: The best thing to do is to just go talk to him. You know, sit down and be honest and figure out what you both want.",
        "Maddie: You think?",
        "Will: Yeah, definitely. Now, I really gotta get down to work on this report.",
        "Maddie: What's the topic?",
        "Will: I don't know yet. But it's got to be ten pages.",
        "Maddie: Ew --",
        "Will: Yeah --",
        "Maddie: Well, when's it due?",
        "Will: Friday.",
        "Maddie: That's tomorrow. How much do you have? Uh-oh.",
        "Will: Yeah, uh-oh is right. And if I don't finish this report, then I don't graduate. And if I don't graduate, then I'm not gonna be able to face Gwen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Cass: Emily, as your attorney I have to advise you to keep your personal observations to yourself, at least until we can confer about what our strategy --",
        "Hal: What he's trying to say is anything that you say can be used against you in court. That's what he's trying to say.",
        "Emily: I don't care -- I don't care if you use it against me, okay? I'm ready to pay for what I did. I'm glad I got arrested. I deserved it. I did a lot sick things. I know that. And there's no excuse.",
        "Cass: Emily, stop right there.",
        "Emily: No, no, I need you all to understand something. Something happened to me. That day that Paul dumped me -- our wedding day, it's like I -- it's like I disappeared. It's like I walked into this -- this fog. And I tried -- I tried to act normal, but that's all it was, it was an act. I'm telling you, I was the farthest from my true self as I could possibly be.",
        "Hal: So, now you're trying to tell us that you didn't know what you were doing?",
        "Emily: How could I? How could I? Come on, you know me. You were married to me. We have a child together. Do you two honestly believe that in my right mind I was capable of pulling out a gun and shooting Paul in the back or kidnapping and torturing another human being? I can't do this anymore. I can't lie to you guys. I can't lie to myself. I just -- [Emily sighs] I'm telling you, there's something wrong with me -- I can feel it. And I just want to get better. Whatever it takes.",
        "Henry: As possibly her only friend at the moment, I can vouch for that.",
        "Tom: If we need you to vouch for anybody, we'll let you know. Now, that was quite a performance, Emily. Who put you up to it? Your lawyer or Henry?",
        "Emily: It's not a performance. I swear to you. I'm being truthful for the first time in a very long time.",
        "Tom: Well, I don't know about you, Hal, but I'm not buying it. I'm gonna call the judge and see if I can get him to deny this postponement.",
        "Cass: Oh, come on, you can't do that.",
        "Tom: Watch me. I want you arraigned today, Emily. I want you in jail.",

        "Dusty: Because I've been talking to your father. He's been keeping me up to date. I'm supposed to meet him over here this morning so we can walk over to the courthouse together.",
        "Jennifer: So, this has been on your mind a lot?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, does that surprise you?",
        "Jennifer: It surprises me that you never told me that you were talking to my dad.",
        "Dusty: I'm talking to your dad because, unlike you, I can't forgive people so easily and move on.",
        "Jennifer: I thought -- I don't know, I thought that what you were most worried about was protecting Johnny and me. But this sounds like payback.",
        "Dusty: Until Emily's locked up, you're not safe. So, I am looking out for you and Johnny. And a little payback never hurts.",

        "Gwen: Well, I agree. But I think that will is, you know, afraid that I pushed him so hard so that he'll get his trust fund.",
        "Carly: Did you?",
        "Gwen: No. Will doesn't even think that his mom will give it to him, anyway. Which is why I think it's even more important that we go to college, so we can get jobs that actually pay something.",
        "Carly: Well, he can't be mad at you for thinking like that.",
        "Gwen: I hope not. You know, it all comes back to living here, though, to pull it off. Which is the part that he really chokes on.",

        "Will: So, any suggestions on how I should tackle this paper?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, look at the chapter headings and see what jumps out at you. And if you think it's interesting, read the first few paragraphs and then move on to the next book and gather about five sample topics and whichever one has the most resource material -- get cracking.",
        "Will: There's like seven books here. That could take all day.",
        "Maddie: Think about it this way. By this time tomorrow, it'll be done and out of the way.",

        "Daniel: You have to do that in here, in the hospital?",

        "Carly: Well, good. Because I promised Jack that I'd stay out of things from now on, and I want to keep that promise.",

        "Jade: Oh, come on, it can't be that bad. It's only Biology. I know a lot about Biology. On a personal level, anyway.",

        "Jade: Will, if you want a paper, you can get a paper. All you have to do is write your name at the top of the page.",

        "Emily: What does that mean?",
        "Hal: It means that you'll be staying in this hospital for the next 30 days and not going to jail today.",

        "Hal: Dusty -- you shouldn't be here. Jen, you either.",
        "Dusty: Well, we are here. What's going on? Emily's going to a psych ward and not to jail? Hal, how did you let this happen?",
