        "Casey: Good. You got my message.",
        "Alison: Uh, yes. \"Yo's is a no -- more space at my place.\" That's pure poetry, Baby.",
        "Casey: Come on. You liked that. I worked hard on that, and you're impressed.",
        "Alison: Oh, yes. You've swept me right off my feet -- except I thought you were gonna take me to lunch.",
        "Casey: Have a little faith, Lady. Food will be served.",
        "Alison: Okay, for the record, handing me one of your protein bars and saying, \"Here you go,\" will not count.",
        "Casey: Yes, duly noted.",
        "Alison: And what about our plans to do something after lunch?",
        "Casey: I -- I thought we could do it here.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Casey: I didn't mean it that way. For once, seriously. But, uh, there is a chance we could get a little dirty.",
        "Alison: Well, there always is that with you.",
        "Casey: I got a surprise for you.",
        "Alison: Really?",
        "Casey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: Where?",
        "Casey: It's in my pocket.",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm so out of here.",
        "Casey: No, come on, come on, come on. Just -- it's in my back pocket. I won't bite. Yes!",
        "Alison: A paintbrush?",
        "Casey: Yes, I thought it would be fun if we kicked back and paint the planters outside. What do you say?",
        "Alison: Those planters out there?",
        "Casey: Yep.",
        "Alison: Yeah?",
        "Casey: Yeah.",
        "Alison: I'm so out of here.",
        "Casey: But --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: That was -- that was quite a feat. You slapped me and managed not to spill a drop.",
        "Carly: Well, I hope you're not expecting an apology, Craig. Because you are, without a doubt, the world's most aggravating man.",
        "Craig: I'm surprised you can feel aggravation at all, what, with all the vodka you just sucked down.",
        "Carly: Excuse me. I am not drunk. Get out of my way!",
        "Craig: Carly, would you look at yourself? You can barely stand up!",
        "Carly: You tripped me! And you're even gonna deny it, are you?!",
        "Craig: What would be the point?",
        "Carly: You want to make me look bad -- so that I'll feel less than. Well, who needs you?",
        "Craig: You're right. Who needs me when you still have half a bottle of vodka left?",
        "Carly: Jealous?",
        "Craig: Give me that.",
        "Carly: When did you suddenly turn into Jack -- standing there, judging me? You think I don't know what that look means? I was married to that look.",
        "Craig: I'm trying to help you, Carly.",
        "Carly: Go to hell. I don't want your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Okay, I got to head back to the station.",
        "Janet: Are you still picking Parker up after school?",
        "Jack: That is the plan.",
        "Janet: See? There was a silver lining to Craig getting rid of Parker's car after all.",
        "Jack: Don't start.",
        "Janet: I'm not!",
        "Jack: Hey, listen. I'm all for spending time with Parker. I just wish it were under different circumstances.",
        "Janet: I know, baby.",
        "Jack: And I want him to see that it's never too late to get his life back on track.",
        "Janet: He's lucky to have you.",
        "Jack: I'm the lucky one.",
        "Janet: Don't you forget it.",
        "Jack: Impossible.",
        "Janet: Mmm.",
        "Jack: Parker? Hey. Whoa. What -- what are you doing? School's not out yet.",
        "Parker: It is for me.",
        "Jack: You care to explain that?",
        "Parker: It's simple. I quit.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You've had a rough day. I get that.",
        "Carly: You should. You caused it.",
        "Craig: I understand why you'd want to take the edge off.",
        "Carly: I think I deserve that.",
        "Craig: I think you do, too.",
        "Carly: Then why are you coming down on me, then?",
        "Craig: Because this is becoming a problem.",
        "Carly: You want to know what the problem is, Craig? You. You're the problem. And you've been the problem since you showed up here.",
        "Craig: Okay, you want to lash out at me because Parker quit school or because he's furious with me because I took his car to a chop shop or because all the fighting with Jack has finally pushed you to the edge, go right ahead. Have at it. I'm right here.",
        "Carly: And why is that exactly? Why are you here? Why? Is it to drive me completely insane?",
        "Craig: I'm here because I'm crazy about you. And I'm not just gonna stand by and watch you ruin your life.",
        "Carly: There's the door. Stroll on out.",
        "Craig: At the rate you're going, you're not only gonna destroy yourself -- you're gonna take down every single person who cares about you.",
        "Carly: I don't have a problem. What I have -- what I've had all day is more stress than any normal person should have to contend with. And obviously I didn't handle it very well.",
        "Craig: Well, I'm glad you could see that.",
        "Carly: But let's not start referring to it as a problem.",
        "Craig: Do you really believe it isn't?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Craig: Well, judging from the way I saw you start drinking all that vodka just now --",
        "Carly: I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing, okay? I was upset. I was yelling at you. I wasn't thinking.",
        "Craig: Okay, let's just say I believe that.",
        "Carly: I don't know why you wouldn't.",
        "Craig: Let's just say that I didn't just watch you shoot down five shots of vodka.",
        "Carly: All right! Message received, okay? It's my mistake. But come on. You're acting like I couldn't stop.",
        "Craig: Could you?",
        "Carly: What kind of question is that? Of course I can any time I want.",
        "Craig: Well, okay, then.",
        "Carly: Where are you going? Craig? What are you doing?",
        "Craig: You said you could stop. I believe you. You obviously don't need this.",
        "Carly: No, don't -- don't do that.",
        "Craig: What? You just said to me --",
        "Carly: I know what I said! I don't need this.",
        "Craig: Okay. Then pour it out.",
        "Carly: No, I -- what I mean is I don't need you treating me like I'm a child.",
        "Craig: Does it feel like I'm taking away your favorite toy?",
        "Carly: Oh, shut up.",
        "Craig: Is that what it feels like? Like you're being punished?",
        "Carly: I don't need you hovering, okay? Would you just leave?",
        "Craig: No.",
        "Carly: Go!",
        "Craig: No, Carly. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're dropping out of school?",
        "Parker: I don't want to go anymore.",
        "Jack: Well, what are you gonna do now?",
        "Parker: I don't know. I guess I'll figure it out when I have to.",
        "Jack: Well, I think that time is now. You know, it's not so easy out there. With the economy as bad as it is, college graduates are having a tough time finding work, let alone high-school dropouts.",
        "Parker: I don't need to find a job right away. I have my trust fund.",
        "Jack: Which you can't touch until you're 21, Parker. That's a long way off.",
        "Parker: That's five years!",
        "Jack: Five years is a long time. Did you expect us to support you until then?",
        "Parker: That's up to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey!",
        "Casey: Come on! It could be fun!",
        "Alison: No! Paintball is fun. Painting your plant whatever --",
        "Casey: Planters, planters.",
        "Alison: Is not!",
        "Casey: Why are you such a hard sell?",
        "Alison: Because you hijacked our date so you could put me to work!",
        "Casey: Just for a few hours.",
        "Alison: And then what?",
        "Casey: And then we could do anything you want. I promise. Cross my heart. Swear.",
        "Alison: Fine. I'll help you.",
        "Casey: Yes!",
        "Alison: Gosh. But to speed this stupid process along and avoid any unnecessary delays, like talking, I will be wearing this.",
        "Casey: And nothing else.",
        "Alison: Go on. Get out of here. Oh, man.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Alison: This is Emily's. I must have grabbed hers by mistake when I left.",
        "Casey: Oh, do you want me to grab mine?",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no. I'll just give her a call and see if she's, you know, nearby. We can switch or something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Emily: Hello? Hey, Ali. Yeah, I noticed. I almost blew out my eardrums driving to work this morning. What are you listening to, anyway?",
        "Alison: The Dash.",
        "Casey: The Dash rocks!",
        "Alison: Anyway, I'm at Casey's. Are you around?",
        "Emily: Well, I'm at the office, but I can messenger it over to you. Consider it done. Bye.",
        "Hunter: You're sending something to Alison?",
        "Emily: And if you say one word about me using the messenger service, I'm gonna make you sit outside.",
        "Hunter: You don't need to use a messenger service.",
        "Emily: Okay, that's, like, eight words. I'm gonna make you leave the building.",
        "Hunter: Oh, that's sarcasm, right? You know, I could bring it to her.",
        "Emily: Hunter -- oh, Hunter. You're an editor now. You don't deliver packages. You deliver deadlines.",
        "Hunter: It would get me out of the office.",
        "Emily: She's at Casey's.",
        "Hunter: I know the way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I'm not kicking you out. I'm not grounding you. As far as I'm concerned, right now you -- you're better off at home.",
        "Parker: Well --",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Parker: Nothing. I just -- I didn't think you'd be so cool with this.",
        "Jack: Oh. I am far from cool with this. In fact, I think that dropping out of school is just about the dumbest decision anyone could ever make. But having said that, I'm not gonna make you do something you don't want to do.",
        "Parker: You're not gonna make me go back.",
        "Jack: If that's what you want, I'm not gonna stop you. But know this. If you do this, you're gonna have to figure things out on your own, Parker.",
        "Parker: I will.",
        "Jack: We'll see. Does your mother know about this?",
        "Parker: Yeah, I told her.",
        "Jack: Yeah, what did she have to say about it?",
        "Parker: I didn't really stick around to find out.",
        "Jack: No, of course not.",
        "Parker: Well, she was just gonna yell at me.",
        "Jack: What did you expect her to do, Parker?",
        "Parker: Okay, you know what? Can I just go now?",
        "Jack: Listen. Parker, listen to me. Listen. I'm still your father. So if you need any help, if that's what you decide that you want -- I'll always be here for you. Okay? That's all I wanted to say.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Hey, Hunter.",
        "Hunter: Oh. Bringing you -- this!",
        "Alison: Oh, you are my hero. Now I don't have to listen to Casey talk anymore.",
        "Casey: Hey, don't believe her, Hunter. She can't enough of me.",
        "Alison: Oh, the dream is still alive for you, isn't it, Case?",
        "Casey: Ooh.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Hunter: Your phone is ringing.",
        "Casey: Yes. Yes, you're right. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Hello?",
        "Hunter: I didn't know you liked to paint.",
        "Alison: I don't. Anyway, thank you for bringing this, and, let me get you Emily's.",
        "Hunter: Oh, I don't think she's in a hurry to get it back.",
        "Alison: Oh, still, she's probably expecting it, so here you go. So, how are things going at work? You guys getting along better?",
        "Hunter: Well -- I started agreeing with her more like you suggested, and she seems to be responding well.",
        "Alison: Well, that's good, right?",
        "Hunter: Well, and that's when I know she's wrong.",
        "Alison: Hmm. Well, I guess, uh, Case and I should probably get back to painting.",
        "Casey: Uh, listen, I can't.",
        "Alison: Why not?",
        "Casey: I'm sorry. That was Jade on the phone, and I have to --",
        "Alison: No, no, no, no, no. You -- you are not ditching me for her.",
        "Casey: No, never. I would never do that. I'm ditching you for Mr. Liebowitz.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Casey: I made a promise to Jade the other day, and I --",
        "Alison: You can't be serious!",
        "Casey: You told me to take this job.",
        "Alison: Well, I'm not painting this stupid thing by myself.",
        "Casey: You don't have to. 'Cause we got him here. Here. Have a paintbrush.",
        "Alison: Casey.",
        "Casey: No, it's okay. It's okay. I'll be right back. I promise. See you!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Why won't you just leave me alone?",
        "Craig: Because I'm your friend, and I wouldn't be much of one if I were to abandon you in the state you're in.",
        "Carly: I am not in a state, Craig! I'm just feeling -- hi. You're back.",
        "Parker: So?",
        "Carly: Uh, Parker, you know, we -- we need to talk about -- about what happened earlier.",
        "Parker: I'm not changing my mind. I'm not going to school.",
        "Carly: You can't just expect me to accept that.",
        "Parker: Why not? Dad did.",
        "Carly: You -- you spoke to your father about this?",
        "Parker: Yeah. And he's cool with it.",
        "Craig: Jack couldn't possibly be cool with you quitting school.",
        "Parker: Why is he here? You know, you should probably tell Sage to lock up her bike in case he decides to steal that next.",
        "Carly: Wait, Parker, what -- what exactly did your father tell you when you told him that you had left school?",
        "Parker: He said that he would support me until I'm 21 and I get control of my trust fund.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God. I can't believe he would do that.",
        "Parker: You don't believe me, you should talk to him yourself.",
        "Carly: I plan to.",
        "Parker: Whatever. You know what? I'm out of here.",
        "Carly: No. Parker, please don't leave again! Parker?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: You missed a spot.",
        "Alison: Where?",
        "Hunter: There.",
        "Alison: Thank you.",
        "Hunter: Would you like to go out with me?",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Hunter: On a date?",
        "Alison: Uh -- yeah, I know what you're asking, but I -- I can't.",
        "Hunter: Why not?",
        "Alison: Isn't it obvious?",
        "Hunter: Oh, we could finish painting first?",
        "Alison: No, I'm already dating someone. Casey.",
        "Hunter: Oh, you're dating Casey.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I mean, I thought that was pretty clear. I mean, I'm here and painting, and I make fun of him all the time.",
        "Hunter: You never said anything.",
        "Alison: But I didn't think I had to.",
        "Hunter: But you invited me to Yo's and to that barbecue. Remember?",
        "Alison: Yeah, but, Hunter, the barbecue is here at Casey's house.",
        "Hunter: Why did you invite me, then?",
        "Alison: Because I thought you might be interested in Jade.",
        "Hunter: Jade can't stand me. And besides, I'm -- I'm interested in you.",
        "Alison: Hunter, I'm -- I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression.",
        "Hunter: No, no. It's -- its okay. Just sometimes I miss things that are right in front of me.",
        "Alison: Hunter, look out! Oh. Are you okay?",
        "Hunter: Oops. Yeah. This just proves my point. I should go.",
        "Alison: No, you don't have to. It's --",
        "Hunter: Yes, I do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: You can't do this, Carly.",
        "Carly: Not if I can't find my keys.",
        "Craig: You don't want to talk to Jack now, trust me.",
        "Carly: This really is none of your concern, okay?",
        "Craig: Don't you think it would be wise just to let things settle down a little bit first?",
        "Carly: I really want to know what Jack was thinking, telling Parker that he would never have to go back to school, and he criticizes me! I'm the one who's failing the children, right?!",
        "Craig: You don't know that's what Jack said.",
        "Carly: So Parker's a liar, then?",
        "Craig: No. I didn't say that.",
        "Carly: And I suppose if he is, that means that he takes after me. He is a good boy.",
        "Craig: Yes, he is. I know he is.",
        "Carly: And I am not gonna lose him because Jack refuses to put his foot down.",
        "Craig: Well, maybe Jack has finally realized that tough love isn't gonna work with Parker.",
        "Carly: And what is, then? Giving up? I'm not gonna do that. Got 'em.",
        "Craig: No, no. Carly, you're not going.",
        "Carly: Hey, let go!",
        "Craig: No!",
        "Carly: Get your hands off me right -- let go!",

        "Janet: Um, sit down, please.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I just walked through the door.",
        "Janet: This is serious. Just sit down. We need to talk.",
        "Liberty: Okay. What's up? Huh?",
        "Janet: Parker quit school.",
        "Liberty: What?",
        "Janet: Yeah. And there was an incident with his car.",
        "Liberty: What happened to his car?",
        "Janet: Well, to make a long story short, Craig had it stripped, and then he ditched it.",
        "Liberty: What?!",
        "Janet: Yeah. And this morning, uh, Jack took Parker to school, and when Jack left, Parker turned around and cleaned out his locker.",
        "Liberty: Are you kidding?",
        "Janet: Now, Sweetie -- oh, don't get that look on your face. This is not your fault!",
        "Liberty: Yes, this is my fault, Mom, because I told you guys that he was using his car to skip school, and that's what started all this, right? I have got to talk to him.",
        "Janet: No. That would be a \"No.\" No.",
        "Liberty: Mom.",
        "Janet: No, Sweetheart, listen. There is nothing you can do to help him.",
        "Liberty: Mom, I know why he's doing this.",
        "Janet: This isn't about you. Parker has problems.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I know about his problems, Mom. I was married to him.",

        "Liberty: Hey! You picked up. That is a good sign.",
        "Parker: Well, I almost didn't.",
        "Liberty: Are you busy?",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Liberty: Because I'd like to talk to you.",
        "Parker: About what?",
        "Liberty: How about I just tell you when I see you?",
        "Parker: Well, I just saw you go into Al's diner, and I'm not coming there.",
        "Liberty: Fine. Just say \"Yes,\" and I'll meet you at Java. Please?",

        "Carly: I despise you.",

        "Craig: What are you gonna do, Carly -- slip out the back door? Then what?",
        "Carly: Why can't you just leave me alone?",

        "Carly: Like what?! I'm fine!",
