        "Alison: Hi, Aaron, it's me. Where are you? Call me as soon as you get this, 'cause I need to know if you can't get that anniversary plate for Chris' parents, then I have to go shopping for one during my lunch break. So just call me. But I'm sure that you can pick out something perfect. You are such a doll for helping me. Thank you so much. Just call me.",
        "Chris: Ali?",
        "Alison: Hi!",
        "Chris: Who's this \"doll\" you were talking to? Should I be getting jealous?",
        "Alison: Oh, that was just my ceramics teacher. I was just thanking her for helping me -- giving me extra time and helping me smooth out all the rough spots.",
        "Chris: Tell me about it over lunch?",
        "Alison: I would love to, but I have to put another coat of glaze on that plate that I'm making for your parents.",
        "Chris: Okay, well, I can't wait to see it.",
        "Alison: Neither can I.",
        "Chris: All right, hey, I'd better finish up on my scout work, but I'll see you later.",
        "Susan: Hi.",
        "Alison: I didn't know that you were there.",
        "Susan: I guess we're both full of surprises. I didn't know you were making pottery.",

        "Lily: Mmm, what are we drinking to?",
        "Holden: How about to having you all to myself?",
        "Lily: Oh. I know there's a little more to running away with me than just having a cup of coffee.",
        "Holden: Oh, really?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Holden: Maybe you ought to fill me in.",
        "Lily: I want dusty to know that he is off the hook for having the Rose Foundation audited by the IRS. I want him to know that there are no hard feelings.",
        "Holden: That's -- awfully generous of you.",
        "Lily: And I want you by my side when I tell him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Molly: Morning, Metro. How may I help you?",
        "Starziak: Put Donovan on the phone.",
        "Molly: He's not in yet. May I give him a message?",
        "Starziak: Tell him an old friend of his is -- wants to talk to him.",
        "Molly: Is this the moron that was in here throwing his weight around the other night?",
        "Starziak: You're real mouthy, you know that? Give my friend a message. Tell him I'm watching Lily Snyder and her hubby having coffee.",
        "Molly: What the hell's that supposed to mean?",
        "Starziak: Just give him the message. He'll know what it means.",
        "Dusty: You look great in red. Is it a beautiful day out or what?",
        "Molly: Dusty, your brain donor friend that was in here the other night --",
        "Dusty: What's the problem?",
        "Molly: -- Just called to say that he's been stalking Lily and Holden.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Molly: You're putting your partner in danger, Dusty. It's time to let them know exactly what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Is someone there?",
        "Paul: Hello, Mummy. How are you feeling?",
        "Barbara: I am much stronger, thank you.",
        "Paul: Great. Did you eat?",
        "Barbara: Oh, I opted for breakfast in a bag.",
        "Paul: Oh, intravenous cuisine. My favorite.",
        "Barbara: Well, until something better is on the menu. That way, I will look fabulous in my new designs -- which reminds me, we do have something to talk about business-wise.",
        "Paul: Okay. What?",
        "Barbara: We have to figure out what we're going to do about this Jordan Sinclair mess.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Yes, Annabelle, the adoption papers are signed. No, you can't have them. Not until I see him. Because I have some questions, which I believe deserve to be answered. I have to go. I'll call you later. You were up early.",
        "Jordan: Yeah, I try to get a couple miles in every morning. Helps clear my head.",
        "Rosanna: I thought that's why they invented the cappuccino.",
        "Jordan: How's Cabot doing?",
        "Rosanna: He's down for his morning nap. More coverage on the fashion show?",
        "Jordan: No, no, no, the big news today is the CEO of Cabot Motors marrying a nobody from nowhere. It's a keeper. Oh, and this one -- this is something Cabot can be proud of some day.",
        "Rosanna: Just try to ignore it.",
        "Jordan: I did. I stopped by the front desk to tell them that they could forward my calls and my mail to your suite, and the desk clerk winked at me and said, \"nice work.\" Nice work. Not only do I have the entire Ryan family hating me, but the rest of the world now thinks that I'm a gigolo. I'm gonna go take a shower.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan -- is there anything I can do?",
        "Jordan: Just solve the mystery and set me free. You only have two weeks, remember?",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "[Knock at door]",
        "Rosanna: Carly --",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Carly: Is Jordan here?",
        "Rosanna: He's taking a shower. Why?",
        "Carly: You got a problem.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I know. Is there something new?",
        "Carly: I talked to Jennifer last night. She's not giving up on Jordan -- not by a long shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: It was not money laundering. It was a mistake, and I believe him. And the accountant believes him, and the IRS believes him.",
        "Holden: Fine. Then I'm not gonna lecture you. But what if this isn't the last time? What if his checkered past keeps following him around?",
        "Lily: Then we keep clearing it up until it goes away. The Rose Foundation was set up for people who need second chances, even if they've made mistakes, even if everybody else has given up on them.",
        "Holden: Dusty's been given more than his fair share of second chances.",
        "Lily: I know. But I have faith in him. I do. And I have faith in the Rose Foundation. We can change people's lives. We don't need a public scandal.",
        "Holden: You're right. And you know what else?",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Holden: You know how good it is to see you happy again?",
        "Lily: Does that mean I can bend you to my will?",
        "Holden: Maybe.",
        "Lily: Hmm? Okay. I want you to come to Metro, talk to Dusty. Oh, come on. Okay, all right. Come with me to Metro. Just stand next to me. I'll talk to him.",
        "Holden: You know what? I have a million things to do at the stables. I got the vet coming today.",
        "Lily: Oh, come on.",
        "Holden: I gotta interview this trainer.",
        "Lily: This is just gonna take a few minutes. Dusty needs to see the two of us there together, so he knows that we believe in him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Nothing's gonna happen to Lily and Holden, all right?",
        "Molly: Oh, you think so? 'Cause that's not the message I was getting from that knuckle-dragging gorilla on the other end of the line.",
        "Dusty: Without all the drama, what did he say?",
        "Molly: He said that he was watching lily and Holden having coffee.",
        "Dusty: That's it?",
        "Molly: That's not enough?",
        "Dusty: Well, that's not really doing anything, is it?",
        "Molly: Dusty, I heard him the other night when he was in here with you. He said that if you didn't want to do business as planned with him that he was gonna go lean on Lily. And now he's stalking her.",
        "Dusty: I'm handling it.",
        "Molly: How?",
        "Dusty: Nothing's gonna happen to Lily, okay?",
        "Molly: How can you say that? How can you say nothing's gonna happen to Lily? That phone call was proof that he can get to Lily whenever he wants to. And what about the kids?",
        "Dusty: I said I'm handling it! My way! I know what I'm doing, all right?",
        "Molly: People that know what they're doing don't usually need to raise their voices -- especially at people that are just trying to help.",
        "Dusty: Okay, maybe I didn't need to raise my voice. I apologize for that. Maybe I don't need to do a lot of things. You know? I'm a better guy these days. The foundation's a big part of that. I'm not gonna screw it up, and nothing is gonna happen. Okay?",
        "Lily: Good morning, all.",
        "Dusty: Good morning. What are you guys doing here so early?",
        "Lily: We just wanted to let you know that we spoke to the accountant, and the situation with the IRS is under control. We convinced them you didn't do anything wrong by returning that check back to the donor, so no money laundering charges, and the Rose Foundation is safe.",
        "Dusty: You're kidding me?",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Dusty: Did you hear that? That's fantastic. That's great news.",
        "Holden: Yeah. Yeah, we both wanted you to know that, in spite of everything that's happened, we both put it behind us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You need to focus on your recovery. All right? Leave everything else to me. If it gets to be too much, I can always ask Jennifer for help.",
        "Barbara: And how is she going to do that when Jordan has broken her heart?",
        "Paul: Okay, I think you're blowing things a little out of proportion.",
        "Barbara: No, I'm not. I just got off the telephone with her, and she thinks that there's still a possibility that she and Jordan have some kind of a future together after he's married someone else.",
        "Paul: I'm not sure what that marriage is about, but I don't think its love.",
        "Barbara: Well, whatever it is, Jen deserves to know.",
        "Paul: Mom, I'll see you later.",
        "Barbara: Where are you going?",
        "Paul: I'm gonna go pay a visit to the happy couple.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Jordan is a married man. Jennifer has to realize that means game over.",
        "Carly: I suggested that. And she suggested that I keep my helpful advice to myself.",
        "Rosanna: It's not as if they were dating , for heaven's sake.",
        "Carly: So how did Jordan take the news that he has to be married for two years or you lose Cabot?",
        "Rosanna: Not well. But he signed the papers.",
        "Carly: Well, that's good.",
        "Rosanna: Well, not so good. He's given me two weeks to find a loophole or he's walking.",
        "Carly: Two weeks?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, and he's only given me that much because he's curious to know how he got wrapped up in this whole mess.",
        "Carly: Oh. I wonder how much Jennifer knows about the situation.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean? Jennifer's not supposed to know anything.",
        "Carly: She was acting very uppity and entitled when it came to Jordan.",
        "Rosanna: What? Jennifer cannot know the real reason that we got married. No one can know. I made that very clear to Jordan. Hey, what is your problem? What have you done? What have you told Jennifer?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Holden: They started the audit because you issued a rose foundation check to a Cayman Islands account.",
        "Dusty: I know. It won't happen again.",
        "Lily: The man from the IRS said if you ever get another check that seems a little \"iffy,\" just give it to the accountant and send it back.",
        "Dusty: Right. There's a lot to know about this foundation business.",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dusty: I'm an idiot, but I'm catching on slowly. And this guy Starziak is a thing of the past.",
        "Lily: Well, just keep a close eye on everything, and we'll have the accountant do the same.",
        "Dusty: Yep.",
        "Lily: All right.",
        "Dusty: Yep. It's great news. Thank you. Too early for champagne or what?",
        "Lily: Oh, I don't know --",
        "Holden: Actually I have to get going. If you guys want to have a little toast, go right ahead.",
        "Lily: No.",
        "Molly: I'm still trying to figure out what there is to celebrate here.",
        "Dusty: Anyway, thank you for stopping by and giving me the news.",
        "Lily: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: I appreciate it.",
        "Lily: Okay, I'll call you this week.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Lily: All right.",
        "Dusty: Have a good one.",
        "Molly: Wait a minute. He's lying to you guys.",
        "Lily: Lying about what?",
        "Dusty: Stay out of this.",
        "Holden: No, Molly, go ahead. I want to hear what you have to say.",
        "Molly: His old pal Starziak is not a thing of the past, and Dusty knows it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I feel like I haven't seen you in months.",
        "Alison: It hasn't been that long, Mom.",
        "Susan: And every time I call you, you're never home, or I get your voice mail. The other night, I waited until 10:00 to call you, and still no answer.",
        "Alison: Okay, so, then I finally grow a work ethic, and my Mom still isn't proud of me and she still complains.",
        "Susan: You're working nights?",
        "Alison: No, I -- I'm taking my ceramics class.",
        "Susan: Your ceramics class? You?",
        "Alison: Well, Chris believes in me, and him and his parents even bought me a potter's wheel.",
        "Susan: Honey, I raised you, I love you, but one thing I know about you, you are not artistic.",
        "Alison: How can you say that?",
        "Susan: If you've tapped into some heretofore untapped talent, I couldn't be happier. Bravo for you. But from that old familiar look on your face, when you were talking to Chris --",
        "Alison: And I love Chris. And everything I do is for him, and for us, and for our future together.",
        "Susan: Oh, I'm sure you feel that way, but if you're doing anything to upset his family or to make them misunderstand --",
        "Alison: I'm not, Mom, and I won't. And I have to drop off these menus or no one's getting their lunch today, okay?",
        "Susan: Thank you for spending five whole minutes with your Mother.",
        "Alison: Mom --",
        "Susan: And I do love you.",
        "Alison: Aaron, I'm about 60 seconds away from having a total nervous breakdown. I can't do this anymore, I just can't!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Is there a reason why you're giving me the third degree about Jennifer?",
        "Rosanna: Well, yes, Carly spoke to her yesterday. How did she find out that this marriage was just a formality?",
        "Jordan: I don't know. Why don't you ask your spy?",
        "Carly: I certainly was not spying.",
        "Rosanna: Carly is a loyal sister who knows if you speak to the wrong person and give that person too much information, this adoption could be jeopardized.",
        "[Cabot crying]",
        "Carly: Oh, I'll -- let me get him.",
        "Jordan: Look, Rosanna, Jennifer's world was crashing in on her yesterday. Her mother just had brain surgery. No one knows if she's ever gonna be able see again, no one knows what's going to happen to the company that she created, or the family that needs her. I was just -- just trying to give Jennifer some hope.",
        "Rosanna: What did you say to her?",
        "Jordan: I told her that I hoped that she wouldn't lose faith in me.",
        "Rosanna: Well, why didn't you tell her that this marriage was just a complete sham? Why didn't you just kneel down and propose to her right then.",
        "Jordan: Look, I think you need to remember something. I'm the one doing you a favor. I'm not getting anything out of this arrangement. So, I would appreciate it if you would get off my back and keep your sister out of my personal life.",

        "Paul: Hey.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, Paul.",
        "Paul: Hi, Jordan. How's Cabot?",
        "Rosanna: Uh, Cabot's fine. Everything's fine. I'm in the middle of something.",
        "Paul: Oh.",
        "Rosanna: Can I --",
        "Paul: Uh, yeah, sure. I'll get out of here, I'm sorry.",
        "Jordan: No, no, no, you stay. I'm out of here.",
        "Paul: All right. I didn't mean to interrupt. I'm sorry, maybe I should've called.",
        "Rosanna: No, it's okay.",
        "Paul: I just wanted to drop this off. It's a welcome home gift for Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, thank you. Everything's fine. Really, it's fine. Thank you so much.",
        "Carly: Well, look who's awake.",
        "Paul: Hey, there you are. Hey, Cabot. Remember me?",
        "Rosanna: Wait. Don't touch him.",

        "Paul: I would like for Cabot and I to be friends. I don't think that he's formed any really foul opinions of me just yet.",
        "Rosanna: I'm sorry. I was overreacting. I -- I just can't stand the thought of losing Cabot again.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I can -- everything's okay now, Rosanna. You've got your baby back, got a brand-new husband.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, yeah, it's okay, but there are a lot of unknowns. Jordan is afraid that he's gonna lose his job now that we're married.",
        "Paul: Why would he think that?",
        "Carly: Well, you know about Jennifer's enormous crush.",
        "Paul: Yeah, we talked about that. So what?",
        "Rosanna: Apparently, Barbara was all for it. And now, Jordan is bracing himself for her to go into mama lion mode.",
        "Paul: And retaliate by firing Jordan? I don't think she would do that.",
        "Carly: Are you sure about that?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I'm -- I think she would be upset for Jennifer, but I don't think that she would take it out on Jordan, no.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I would appreciate it if you could guarantee that. Make sure that Jordan doesn't suffer any professional repercussions for his personal choices.",
        "Paul: Okay, I'll try.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I'd do anything to be friends with you again. If you need anything, and I mean anything at all, please call me.",
        "Carly: So, what's really going on with Jordan?",
        "Rosanna: Well, he's furious with me. And understandably, I think.",
        "Carly: And you want to get back in his good graces by saving his job?",
        "Rosanna: He wasn't interested in being married to me in the first place. He's getting nothing he wants out of this bargain.",
        "Carly: Huh, except access to gazillions.",
        "Rosanna: Small consolation when what he really wants is love.",
        "Carly: So this thing with Jennifer is a two-way street.",
        "Rosanna: She's all he wants, apparently. That and answers to his questions.",

        "Jordan: What do you mean?",
        "Barbara: I asked you to refrain from having a personal relationship with Rosanna Cabot. You give me your word, and then you turn around and take her hand in marriage.",
        "Jordan: Well, I was hoping I could tell you about that myself.",
