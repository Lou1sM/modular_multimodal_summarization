        "Jennifer: Mom, if I trip and fall and break my ankle and Dad has to carry me down the aisle --",
        "Barbara: Honey, nobody and nothing is going to stop this wedding from happening. Now open your eyes. Do you like it?",
        "Jennifer: Oh. Oh, my gosh. Mom, this is beautiful. Where on earth you found all the time to do all this --",
        "Barbara: I'd do anything for you. Don't you know that by now? Your wedding gown is in the dressing room. And there are no tears allowed, because the makeup and hair artists are gonna be here any moment.",
        "Jennifer: And the horse-drawn carriage?",
        "Barbara: Who told you? No, I think you can make it down the stairs to the living room on your own.",
        "Jennifer: Thank you so much, Mom. I really did want a beautiful wedding and you've made it happen. You and Katie.",
        "Barbara: Yes, yes. Katie was very involved.",
        "Jennifer: These are so beautiful.",
        "Barbara: I'm sure those must be from Lucinda. Is it my imagination or is it really hot in here?",
        "Jennifer: Oh, it is a little warm. And we don't want these beautiful flowers to melt. They're from Katie. Isn't that so sweet?",
        "Barbara: Yes. A little too sweet.",
        "Jennifer: What did you say?",
        "Barbara: I said this suite must have a thermostat.",
        "Jennifer: Right over there.",
        "Barbara: Oh. Oh, so it is. I'll turn it down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You can let go of my hand.",
        "Mike: Oh, I'm a little nervous. Not about marrying your sister. It's just -- I'm a behind-the-scenes kinda guy. You know, standing up here in front of all these people -- dressed like this --",
        "Paul: I do. That's all you gotta say. I do.",
        "Mike: All right, fine. I can't believe your mother got this place together so fast. Of course she had a lot of help from Katie. Did you know Jen asked her to be the matron of honor?",
        "Paul: You're Katie? I'm sorry, I didn't mean it to sound like that.",
        "Mike: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Paul: But you're saying that Katie Coleman is --",
        "Mike: Jen's matron of honor.",
        "Paul: Wow. That's awfully civilized. Don't you think?",
        "Mike: I thought so. But Jen's a real lady. I'm proud of her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Call one of your competitors, then. Those rose petals better be delivered within the hour or you will be facing a lawsuit. Oh, yes, I'm very serious. You have no idea how much this wedding means to me. This is going to be the most important day of my life. This is America. Roses are never out of season. You want me to come down and strip the petals myself? Okay. So they will be delivered? Thank you very much. Henry. Hey, hon. Okay, what do you think? Pink or gray?",
        "Henry: We need to talk.",
        "Katie: Just, whatever comes to your head. Pink or gray? Ah, forget it -- I'll figure it out while I'm getting ready.",
        "Henry: Katie --",
        "Katie: Hey, why aren't you dressed?",
        "Henry: Because I'm not going to this wedding. Neither are you.",

        "Carly: Margo, this can't be happening. Jack said he was gonna make sure that les was transferred, but he shouldn't have gone with him.",
        "Margo: Well, he did.",
        "Carly: Well, stop him.",
        "Margo: It's a little late for that, Carly. They're already en route.",
        "Carly: No. Not again.",
        "Margo: Hey, you know what? It's gonna be fine. Jack's gonna be fine. This is not like last time. Jack's just along for the ride. He's got two armed guards with him.",
        "Carly: No, Margo, you don't understand. Something terrible is gonna happen. I can feel it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Guard #2: Forget him. He's not goin' anywhere. [Loud bump] What the hell was that?",
        "Guard #1: A tire blew. Hang on!",
        "[Talking over each other]",
        "Guard #1: Hold on.",
        "Guard #2: Hold on.",
        "Les: Watch it, watch it!",
        "[Tires squealing]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I don't understand. Why did Jack have to go? Couldn't they have sent somebody else?",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you knew.",
        "Carly: Knew what?",
        "Margo: Jack asked to be sent on this transport. He just wanted to make sure that Les was put away for good this time. No problems.",
        "Carly: He did it for me.",
        "Margo: Um, yeah, that's the impression I got. I asked him about it. I said, \"I think you're too close to this, Jack, and maybe you should send somebody else.\" But he insisted.",
        "Carly: He shouldn't have gone. It's much too dangerous.",
        "Margo: Carly, it's really -- it's gonna be okay. Look, this is routine. We do it all the -- sometimes twice a day. Do you want to sit down?",
        "Carly: No!",
        "Margo: Okay.",
        "Carly: I'm fine.",
        "Margo: All right. You don't seem fine.",
        "Carly: I don't know, Margo. Ever since Les attacked me -- I can't seem to shake it. I feel his hands around my throat. And I see that look in his eye. And I can't concentrate. I try to work but my mind just goes to bits. I almost clobbered some poor janitor the other night.",
        "Margo: Have you talked to somebody about this?",
        "Carly: No. Not yet. I thought -- I thought once Les was transferred that I'd be able to get some rest. But I can't because now that I'm worried Jack is gonna get hurt.",
        "Margo: Jack is not going to get hurt. George, how's the prisoner transport going?",
        "Cop #1: So far so good.",
        "Margo: There, you see? He's gonna be fine.",
        "Tom: Hey.",
        "Margo: Hey.",
        "Tom: You almost ready? Hey, Carly.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Margo: Um, can I catch up to you?",
        "Carly: The wedding -- I'm sorry, I forgot. Tom, you look so handsome. You should go and have a really nice time.",
        "Margo: Are you sure?",
        "Carly: Yeah. You were right. What happened with Starziak -- Jack had no backup. This is different. He'll be fine.",
        "Margo: He will be.",
        "Carly: Right.",
        "Margo: I know it.",
        "Carly: I'm just gonna go and get myself together.",
        "Margo: Carly, will you please call me if you need me.",
        "Carly: Of course.",
        "Tom: What was that all about?",
        "Margo: Oh, just a little nervous spouse syndrome.",
        "Tom: Feel like telling me about it?",
        "Margo: Not at all. I feel like going and playing with you. Let's go.",
        "Tom: All right.",
        "Carly: Come on, Jack. Pick up.",

        "Barbara: Honey, I turned that thermostat down, and my room is nice and cool. I don't know why it's still so hot in here.",
        "Jennifer: It's like a sauna.",
        "Barbara: I'm sorry, I really am.",
        "Sierra: How's the bride?",
        "Barbara: The bride is roasting. There must be something wrong with the thermostat. Where's your mother?",
        "Sierra: Um, she's at a board meeting. But I'm sure she'll be back soon. You know, why don't I just take a look at that?",
        "Barbara: I turned it down 20 minutes ago, and it's still like an oven in here. Honey, do you wanna change rooms with me?",
        "Jennifer: I will be fine.",
        "Barbara: No, you're not gonna be fine. You might be fine now, but the minute your makeup gets on it's going to slide off. I'm going to find Lucinda's housekeeper.",
        "Sierra: Huh, hmm.",
        "Jennifer: She's, um -- she's got a lot on her mind.",
        "Sierra: Oh, listen, if Lucy was getting married, I'd be tearing the house down.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, we've all been a little stressed. I'm sorry about that. Especially over the past couple weeks.",
        "Sierra: No, don't be silly. Come on, it's your wedding. You deserve to take as much time as you want. And thank god, you are marrying the right man. Mike will be a great father. Unlike Craig. I know I have spent half my life trying to change him and the other half trying to help my children cope.",
        "Jennifer: You did it, didn't you? Whatever happened to get rid of Craig. You -- you were part of it.",
        "Sierra: You know, it is awfully hot in here. I think I'll go find your mother, and we'll get that thermostat fixed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: The boy cleans up.",
        "Will: Yeah, sort of. So, what exactly do ushers do?",
        "Paul: I think it's pretty self-explanatory. You greet the guests as they come in. You escort them to their seats.",
        "Will: Right. So, we're doing the whole groom's side, bride's side thing?",
        "Paul: I don't know -- you'll have to ask Mom.",
        "Will: Mom. Right.",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Will: I just don't know how she does it. Or how the heck you'd fall for it again.",
        "Paul: This isn't about mother, this is about Jennifer. She's got a lot on her mind. She's got Street Jeans, the pregnancy, this wedding. She needed all of our help, will. Even Mother.",
        "Will: Yeah, and Mom took advantage of that.",
        "Paul: Well, maybe Jen took advantage of her. Hey, if Mom's gonna plan this fabulous wedding for her, why not?",
        "Will: Why not? You give that woman an inch and she'll cut out your heart.",
        "Paul: Friend of yours?",
        "Will: Sort of.",
        "Celia: Hey, Will.",
        "Will: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi. I'm Paul, Will's big brother.",
        "Celia: Celia.",
        "Paul: Celia. Beautiful name for a beautiful girl.",
        "Will: So, you made it.",
        "Celia: All the way from the pool house. Your brother's nice.",
        "Will: Yeah, he is. Celia, you look really --",
        "Barbara: Honey, you made it.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Barbara: Now where'd you get this tie?",
        "Will: Mom, its fine.",
        "Barbara: Well, it is now. And who's your pretty friend?",
        "Will: Celia, this is my mother. Mom, this is Celia.",
        "Celia: Nice to meet you.",
        "Will: Her and her brother are staying with Miss Walsh.",
        "Barbara: She and her brother.",
        "Will: Thanks.",
        "Barbara: Lovely dress, honey. Really pretty.",
        "Celia: I wish it were one of yours, Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: Oh, and charming, too.",
        "Will: Is there something you wanted?",
        "Barbara: He always can read my mind. Yes, there is something that I need. I need to find the housekeeper. The thermostat is broken up in your sister's room and it's sweltering in there. Poor little thing is gonna melt.",
        "Will: Sure.",
        "Barbara: So, Celia -- pretty name. Unusual. Where are you from?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: What are you doing?",
        "Gwen: I break it, I buy it. Believe me, I cannot afford it. So, what are you doing? Trying to put me in debt for the rest of my life?",
        "Casey: No. I just thought you were supposed to be working.",
        "Gwen: I'm working. You want one? I won't tell.",
        "Casey: No, thanks. Have you seen Celia?",
        "Paul: So, you were saying you were the best man at Katie's wedding? And now Katie's the matron of honor at your wedding?",
        "Mike: Funny how things work out, huh?",
        "Paul: Yeah, I guess. Can I -- excuse me, I'm sorry. Can I take a couple?",
        "Gwen: Absolutely.",
        "Mike: Thank you.",
        "Paul: To a better man.",
        "Mike: No. I just didn't want to lose a friend.",
        "Paul: Okay. Well, then, to friends.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Henry, we can't skip the wedding. We promised we'd be there. I'm the matron of honor.",
        "Henry: I'm sure they'll manage to get along without you.",
        "Katie: But why? I don't understand. I thought you wanted them to get married.",
        "Henry: Oh, I did. I do. They will. Thanks, in part, to all your noble efforts on their behalf. They'll probably name their firstborn Katie.",
        "Katie: I don't want them to name their firstborn Katie. All I want --",
        "Henry: What? What do you want?",
        "Katie: To see this through. I made a commitment.",
        "Henry: To me. You made a commitment to me.",
        "Katie: Which is all the more reason that we need to be there for the wedding, so that I can prove to you --",
        "Henry: I don't need to see Jennifer and Mike get married. I need to see you in the seat next to me on a plane.",
        "Katie: To Honolulu?",
        "Henry: We never had our honeymoon. I think it's time, don't you?",
        "Katie: Henry, this flight leaves in two hours. The wedding doesn't start till 6:00, and then there's the reception.",
        "Henry: And if you love me, you'll skip the wedding and you'll get on that plane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Well, your mother must miss you terribly.",
        "Celia: She misses me, but she trusts Mrs. Walsh and Ms. Esteban. And my brother, Rafael. We e-mail her every day.",
        "Barbara: Oh, well that's very nice. But it's not the same. I mean, you children grow up so quickly. I know if I was separated from Will for a week or two, it'd just break my heart. We depend on each other. He's my guy. We share everything. So if I'm down, he brings me flowers. And if he's upset or he has a nightmare -- and believe me, we've had enough of those in our family -- I just come running.",
        "Will: Mom?",
        "Barbara: Yeah, hi, honey, we were just talking about you.",
        "Will: Yeah, I heard.",
        "Barbara: Did you find the housekeeper?",
        "Will: No. I didn't.",
        "Barbara: Well, then I've gotta do something about that thermostat. So, if you excuse me. It was very --",
        "Celia: Nice meeting you.",
        "Barbara: Lovely to meet you, honey.",
        "Will: I'm sorry.",
        "Celia: Oh, you should hear my mom talk about Rafi. Nobody's good enough for her son. It's hilarious.",
        "Will: Yeah, it's real funny.",
        "Celia: You mean you're not the smartest, handsomest one on the planet?",
        "Will: Well, all that stuff's true. Celia, I wanted to say before -- you --",
        "Casey: There you are. Wow -- you look hot.",
        "Celia: Really?",
        "Casey: Really. You're burnin' me up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sierra: Oh, sorry. Hey.",
        "Mike: Hey.",
        "Sierra: The guests are starting to arrive. You might want to take refuge in the library.",
        "Mike: All right. Have you seen Katie and Henry?",
        "Sierra: No, I haven't. You know, I've been so busy trying to get the thermostat fixed in Jennifer's room.",
        "Mike: What's wrong?",
        "Sierra: It's like a sauna in there. I don't know, she's going to wilt.",
        "Mike: Oh, all right.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, it's freezing. Mom must have turned on the air conditioning. [Knock on door] Oh, great. Come in! Please tell me that you can fix this, because I have to get married in an hour and I've gotta get ready.",
        "Mike: You look pretty good to me. You need a handyman?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: You want me to walk out on Jennifer and Mike, or you'll fly off to Honolulu without me?",
        "Henry: No, I wouldn't want to go without you.",
        "Katie: Okay then, Henry. Let's just see this wedding through, and then we'll go to Timbuktu if that's what you want.",
        "Henry: It's not about taking a trip. This is -- this is -- can you, please -- can you just do this for me?",
        "Katie: And let everyone down?",
        "Henry: You mean Mike?",
        "Katie: And Jennifer. She did ask me to be the matron of --",
        "Henry: Of honor, I know, you've told like me 20 times, now.",
        "Katie: Why are we fighting?",
        "Henry: Because I'm sick of this wedding, okay?",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Henry: And you're not. You're thrilled -- you can't wait to walk down the aisle and look into Mike's eyes.",
        "Katie: Mike is not gonna be looking at me.",
        "Henry: No?",
        "Katie: No. He's going to be looking at Jennifer.",
        "Henry: Is that why you told the florist this is the most important day of your life?",
        "Katie: Oh, Henry, I was just trying to get his attention so that he would come through with the rose petals.",
        "Henry: And once more, Katie saves the day.",
        "Katie: Can we talk about what's really going on here?",
        "Henry: I don't know. I don't know. Can we?",
        "Katie: Well, obviously you're angry. And I don't know, I'm sensing a little jealousy?",
        "Henry: Katie, for the last few days, you have spent every waking hour sticking your nose into another woman's wedding. You have picked out the music -- and the food -- and the cake. And you've gotten yourself into the wedding party. Why?",
        "Katie: So that you can finally see that I --",
        "Henry: No, you were hoping that Mike will look over there, see you standing there, and realize he's made a terrible mistake.",
        "Katie: That is not true.",
        "Henry: You were hoping that he will stop the wedding and that he will turn to you, and that he will say -- he will say, \"You know what? I've been wrong this whole time. I love you and I want you back.\" That's why you're doing all this, Katie. That's what all this is for. So Mike will realize that he's still in love with you.",

        "Cop: Probably. They just left a little while ago.",
        "Carly: And it's what, about a 20-minute ride on the interstate?",
        "Cop: They take route 39.",
        "Carly: Oh, 39. Right. That's --that's faster, right? All right, well, I'm just gonna run to the store and I'll be right back, then. Thanks. [Phone ringing] Come on, Jack. Answer your phone.",

        "Lily: You cannot control the weather. And the last time we landed, we were held over for six hours.",
        "Keith: It's lucky we didn't run out of fuel. I wish I could say -- I can't really say that about the food.",
        "Lily: Right. Which is why I would like you to sit down, please, and let me make you something to eat.",
        "Keith: Listen, this Sweeney thing is really bugging me. The fact that some guy in an orange jumpsuit is running around the police station making calls -- what kind of a station is that down there? That's a lawsuit there.",
        "Lily: Which is why I think you should just listen to me. Have something to eat. You're exhausted and you're hungry. Trust me, you'll be in a much better mood. Would you do that for me? Pretty please?",
