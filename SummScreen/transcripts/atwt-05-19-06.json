        "Pharmacist: I can't take these back.",
        "Maddie: Why? They are unused and I have the receipt somewhere.",
        "Pharmacist: You'll just have to keep them for next time.",
        "Maddie: I doubt that there is going to be a next time, at least not until June 10th, 2010. Look, can't you at least give me store credit or like -- no?",
        "Pharmacist: I can't.",
        "Maddie: Fine, I'll have to sell them on e-bay.",
        "Pharmacist: I'm sorry ma'am, store policy. We can't take back --",
        "Maddie: You know, never mind, never mind. I'll just -- I'll keep them, thanks.",
        "Casey: What ya got there, Mads?",
        "Maddie: Nothing.",
        "[Maddie groans]",
        "Casey: Looks like you got every angle covered. You got different sizes, scents, flavors.",
        "Maddie: You know what? You don't have to make fun of me.",
        "Casey: I'm not.",
        "Maddie: I get it, all right? I get it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: I have to hand it to you, Will, you must be some kind of a genius if you can crank out a ten-page paper overnight.",
        "Will: I'm no genius.",
        "Jade: Well, so why don't you just get smart, and think about your options?",
        "Will: Online?",
        "Jade: Yeah, online. All you have to do is pick out a topic, click on a paper and buy it.",
        "Will: Buy it? I don't think so.",
        "Jade: Yeah, it's easy. Watch. Okay. All you have to do, is download it and print it out.",
        "Will: And if I'm caught turning in work that isn't mine, I get expelled.",
        "Jade: Then don't get caught. The trick is you just have to change the words around a little bit, make it sound more like you.",
        "Will: I bought it.",
        "Jade: Yeah, and you buy books too, don't you? What's the difference? Just change the words around a little bit. Take some lines from that stack of books over there that you haven't read. And there you go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey, Meg, it's me. Are you there? Meg? Look, I know you are there because you turned your cell phone off. I wanted you to know that I meant what I said last night. Jessica is drawing up the papers and as soon as I deliver them, it's official. I filed for divorce. I'm relinquishing all claims of Emily's child. Meg? Alright, I'm gonna deliver them right now. It's over. It's just you and me in the Fiji Islands, if you're still willing. I love you. Jessica.",
        "Jessica: Paul.",
        "Paul: Yeah, your office said you might be here. You didn't happen to bring those relinquishment papers with you, did you?",
        "Jessica: Um, yeah, yeah. I have the papers and the divorce decree. I could have messengered them to you.",
        "Paul: Nah, I was in the neighborhood. I just, I want this to be over as soon as possible.",
        "Jessica: Look Paul, this is permanent. So, if you think there's any part of you that cannot honor this agreement, I need to know now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Meg plays Paul's message]",
        "Paul: I filed for divorce. I'm relinquishing all claims on Emily's child. Meg? Alright, I'm going to deliver them right now. It's over. It's just you and me in the Fiji Islands, if you are still willing. I love you.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Jack: Going to Fiji?",
        "Meg: Me? No, I'm not going anywhere. It's a joke. Paul's idea of a joke.",
        "Jack: Sounded pretty serious to me. It's hard, isn't it?",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Jack: Loving someone who always breaks the rules. Makes you question if it's worth it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Katie, if this about Jack --",
        "Katie: Now this is about me. And Mike's case. I'm starting to think that maybe Nick had more to do with that evidence disappearing than I originally thought.",
        "Carly: And you're telling me this because.",
        "Katie: Because I said some things that I regret. And I'm sorry. It's mostly because I didn't want to listen to what you had to say, I wanted to believe that we had been handed a miracle. But you were right. Evidence doesn't just disappear. And if Nick's the one who took that St. Christopher medal out of the evidence room,",
        "Carly: Then he and Mike could both be in serious trouble. What changed your mind? Is that?",
        "Katie: It has to be Mike's. I just found it in a box with all of his stuff from when he was a kid.",
        "Carly: But he forgot where he put it? Did you ask him about it?",
        "Katie: I wanted to, but I couldn't. Nick was here.",
        "Carly: All right, wait a minute. If that medal belongs to Mike, then whose medal was stolen from the evidence room?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Let's go.",
        "Dusty: Go where? She kidnapped me.",
        "Hal: None of the charges have been dropped. Emily is simply being observed and evaluated so a judge can determine her state of mind.",
        "Dusty: To release her.",
        "Tom: No one's releasing her.",
        "Dusty: She's spending 30 days down the hall in a private room, she had me chained to a wall.",
        "Emily: I know I did, and it was wrong. And I will never forgive myself.",
        "Dusty: I thought you said you were taking responsibility for what you did.",
        "Emily: I am taking responsibility.",
        "Cass: Emily, I have to caution you --",
        "Dusty: Here we go. First, the doctors, now the lawyers. You play the system like a pro, kid.",
        "Emily: I'm not trying to avoid punishment. I know I hurt you. But I'm telling you I wasn't thinking clearly.",
        "Dusty: Should I play the violin now for you.",
        "Jennifer: Can't we just go?",
        "Tom: I understand your frustration. This is procedural. And all above board.",
        "Dusty: You think the state's attorney will think it's above board? A confessed kidnapper getting special treatment from the district attorney and the chief of detectives, her ex-husband and father of her child? I don't think so, gentlemen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: So, there it is. A ten-page paper on eco-systems. It's a good topic, right? It's current. It's up to the minute?",
        "Will: I don't know anything about eco-systems.",
        "Jade: So read the paper. Do you have a credit card?",
        "Will: I don't know about this, Jade.",
        "Jade: Fine. Read dozens of books, stay up all night taking a ton of notes, trying to get ten pages typed, and footnoted, well, by when is your class?",
        "Will: Fine, you win.",
        "Jade: Why do you look so unhappy? You just bought yourself an A. Done.",
        "Will: Now what?",
        "Jade: Your paper should be printing out, about now. Is that fast enough?",
        "Will: This is good.",
        "Jade: So maybe you want to dumb it down a little bit.",
        "Will: I can't believe this. You really saved my life.",
        "Gwen: Saved your life? What'd you do, write his paper for him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Look, I know I hurt your feelings last night, running out like that? It was a dumb thing to do.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, well, I practically ambushed you. No wonder why you ran.",
        "Casey: That's not why. I mean, I could see you went to a lot of trouble. Okay, it was a little --",
        "Maddie: What?",
        "Casey: Maddie, you're the kind of girl that -- okay fine, if you had the choice between dating Fred Astaire or Vin Diesel -- see what I mean?",
        "Maddie: Casey, this isn't about Fred Astaire or Vin Diesel, this is about you and me.",
        "Casey: That's what I want to talk to you about.",
        "Maddie: Don't even bother. I know what you're going to say. I'm a great girl, Maddie, but forget it. You're not interested in dating -- a virgin!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What I did to you was horrific. I can't even believe it.",
        "Dusty: Oh, believe it, Sweetheart. You tried to kill me.",
        "Cass: I don't think that's one of the charges.",
        "Dusty: Chained up for weeks, no food or water, with a very happy finger on the trigger. Don't twist the story, Counselor.",
        "Emily: But I'm not --",
        "Dusty: I won't let you.",
        "Emily: I'm not denying it, Dusty.",
        "Cass: And you're not admitting it either.",
        "Emily: But he's right. I did terrible things.",
        "Cass: The question is why. And with an underlying psychiatric disorder, culpability is diminished.",
        "Emily: My confession stands. But you're right, I need to find out why I did what I did. So I can fix it because I'm already a mother of one child and I'm have another child on the way. I owe it to both my children.",
        "Dusty: You're keeping the child?",
        "Jennifer: Does Paul know?",
        "Dusty: Of course he does. It's his idea!",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Dusty: Who's raising Daniel right now? You? And who's going to raise the new one? Hal? For old time's sake? Or Pauly boy, let me guess.",
        "Emily: No, Paul won't have nothing to do with raising this child.",
        "Cass: Emily! The child will be provided for while his mother is indisposed.",
        "Dusty: Indisposed, you mean passed around until Mommy gets out of the nut house.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, we are going, now. Don't do this to yourself.",
        "Dusty: She's not gonna spend one day in jail.",
        "Jennifer: You don't know that, okay. It's all procedural, you heard Tom.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I heard him. He's in on it.",
        "Jennifer: Emily still has to stand trial.",
        "Dusty: Emily's pregnant. And they're not going to let her go to jail.",
        "Jennifer: You don't know that.",
        "Dusty: Oh yeah I do. They got it all planned. Your brother knew. He knew that the best way to keep Emily out of jail is to give her a kid. That's what he did.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay, look, I'm not trying to minimize what it is that I'm giving up. But Emily has a huge problem.",
        "Jessica: If she has a problem, why would you want her to raise your child? Why would you want her to make all the decisions in your child's life. I'm saying that if you share custody, you can mitigate her influence. But if you sign these papers, it's over. It's irrevocable. Emily will have total control.",
        "Paul: How? From a jail cell? Susan's gonna raise this child.",
        "Jessica: That remains to be seen.",
        "Paul: Okay, look Jessie, I appreciate your concern. I really do, but bottom line is if I relinquish custody, I get a new start. And right now, that is all that matters. That matters right now more anything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Do you really need to go to Fiji to start over?",
        "Meg: Why not, Jack? Why not Fiji? Or Barcelona? Or Paris or even Bay City?",
        "Jack: Do you have to have Paul there too?",
        "Meg: Look, I know you don't like him.",
        "Jack: You're right, you're right, it's not my business. Okay, it's just -- I've been there before. The place where someone's always promising that things are going to be different this time. Only they never are. Because once you think you are on solid ground, it moves. And you're constantly looking over your shoulder, doubting everything she says, and people get hurt, you get hurt, the kids get hurt. Is that what you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Mike and Nick were both given a Saint Christopher medal by their grandfather. Mike thought he has lost his --",
        "Carly: So when Jack found a medal in the basement with the body --",
        "Katie: Mike had no way of proving that it wasn't his.",
        "Carly: How did you find this?",
        "Katie: I bumped into the shelf, and this box fell. It has all of Mike's stuff from when he was a kid. Pictures and baseball cards, and that.",
        "Carly: Could Nick have put it in there?",
        "Katie: I don't think so.",
        "Carly: Okay, so we're assuming that this medal is Mike's.",
        "Katie: Which means that the medal that was found with the body --",
        "Carly: Isn't Mike's.",
        "Katie: Carly, I don't know what to do.",
        "Carly: Well, you gotta call Jack. You have to call Jack. He'll listen to you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You can't compare Paul to Carly.",
        "Jack: Why not? They're both willing to break the law if it suits them. If they're running scared or if they're covering their tracks. Think about how you felt when you found out Jennifer's baby was alive.",
        "Meg: I wanted to tell her.",
        "Jack: Then Paul convinced you not to. And every lie you told just meant another lie.",
        "Meg: You're talking about me, not Paul.",
        "Jack: No, I'm talking about what happens when somebody gets next to Paul. Look at Emily, he took her so far over the line, she can't find her way back. And look at you, planting false evidence to prove that Paul was dead.",
        "Meg: Okay, so he has a tendency of getting in over his head.",
        "Jack: And who drowns, Meg? You.",
        "Meg: I had a choice, Jack. The difference is, I always knew what I was doing and why. Paul has never lied to me. Can you say the same about Carly?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: But what if I'm wrong? What if that somehow is the same medal that was stolen from the evidence room? Then I've really gotten Nick in to trouble and Mike will never forgive me.",
        "Carly: So Nick would had to have taken his medal out of his Jacket and put it in a box of Mike's old stuff.",
        "Katie: Wait a second, no he said he took his jeweler to get the clasp fixed.",
        "Carly: Did he mention which jeweler he uses?",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Carly: Do you have yellow pages?",
        "Katie: I do. Okay, okay, jewelers, jewelers -- there's got to be 50 here.",
        "Carly: Alright, let's get started.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: You're talking to the wrong girl. The stuff I know about eco-systems couldn't save a frog. I just helped Will look up some stuff online. The rest is up to him.",
        "Will: I was just finishing up a little research.",
        "Gwen: Cool. Can I see?",
        "Will: Let me finish with it first.",
        "Gwen: What's it on?",
        "Will: Eco-systems.",
        "Jade: Yeah, he just needed a topic that was relevant and that stuff is always in the news because of global warming.",
        "Will: Have you guys met? This is Jade, she works in the library. Gwen, my wife.",
        "Gwen: Hi. I think I've seen you around. Not at our school. Where do you go?",
        "Jade: I graduated last year.",
        "Will: She's been here for a little while. She was living with Luke's family. But it didn't really work out.",
        "Gwen: So where are you at now?",
        "Jade: I'm still figuring that out.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, I've been there. You know? Maybe we could help her out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Listen, I know that what she did to you was terrible. But you are alive and we're together. And doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what happens to her or Paul. They can't ruin this for us. Only you can do that. Please don't say anything.",
        "Dusty: What makes her so special?",
        "Jennifer: If she is mentally ill --",
        "Dusty: She knows what she's doing.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, you're right.",
        "Dusty: I just can't forget, you know.",
        "Jennifer: I know. It's too soon. I was just hoping that we could just get back to you and me.",
        "Dusty: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Jennifer: But that's the thing. You don't see it. Every time you see Emily or Paul, you get so caught up in your anger that you just disappear. You know, this morning I called down to the front desk before I left my suite to check and to see if Paul was in the lobby. Because I didn't want to see him. My own brother, I was so afraid of what you might do.",
        "Paul: Has Emily left?",
        "Dusty: Yeah she left.",
        "Paul: For the station or for the courthouse?",
        "Jennifer: No, she's not going to be arraigned quite yet. They're taking her to the psych ward for observation.",
        "Paul: They're what?",
        "Jennifer: Apparently her attorney arranged for her to be evaluated.",
        "Paul: When did this happen?",
        "Jennifer: Just now.",
        "Paul: I have some papers for her to sign.",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I'll bet you do.",
        "Jennifer: If you hurry, you can probably catch them. Her attorney is still with her.",
        "Dusty: You two find a name yet? How about Victim? Because with you as parents, that's what he'll be.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Jennifer: I'll make you a deal then, if you hold onto that thought. And think about you and me, and Johnny, in the future, I will let go of my brother for good.",
        "Katie: Once we get that medal --",
        "Carly: Then we'll know for sure, if Nick is a liar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: That's seven.",
        "Katie: Oh, great, only seven?",
        "Carly: Oh, but look, this one is right down the street from the police station. Feinstein's fine jewelry.",
        "Katie: Yes, I hope you can. My husband, Nick Kasnoff? He dropped a St. Christopher medal to be repaired. K-a-s-n-o-f-f. You have it? Great.",
        "Carly: Ask if he can deliver it.",
        "Katie: Would it be possible for you to deliver it to the house? I wanted to surprise my husband with it. It means a lot to him.",
        "Carly: Tell him you'll make it worth his while.",
        "Katie: And of course I'll pay you extra for your trouble. Okay, thank you. Oh no, is the address is on the receipt? Okay, great. Thank you, Mr. Feinstein. Once we get that medal --",
        "Carly: Then we'll know for sure if Nick's a liar.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: You know, it's not easy finding an affordable around here. We went through it --",
        "Gwen: No, I think, more than once. Actually if Will's dad hadn't come through, we probably would still--",
        "Will: How about your old place, at Burt's garage?",
        "Gwen: Yeah.",
        "Jade: And you left because?",
        "Will: Well, that's a long story. But it wouldn't affect you.",
        "Jade: Oh, well, then I'll check it out.",
        "Gwen: It's at the end of town.",
        "Jade: I know where that is.",
        "Will: It's not gorgeous. But it's all I can think of.",
        "Jade: I'm sure it's okay. I'll survive. I always do.",
        "Gwen: So, you're going to knock Glick's socks off with this Bio paper?",
        "Will: I just want to pass.",
        "Gwen: You will. And then we graduate and we get to move out and we get to find a place of our own. You've really worked hard. And I'm so proud of you.",

        "Maddie: Casey --",
        "Casey: We need to talk.",
        "Maddie: I have nothing more to say to you.",
        "Casey: Well, good. Then you can shut up and hear me out.",
        "Maddie: Why? Like I'm not humiliated enough?",
        "Casey: Why would you be? You're looking at me like I'm stupid again. I hate that.",
        "Maddie: Add it to the list.",
        "Casey: Look, we need to clear things up.",
        "Maddie: Why? I'm not living with you anymore. Okay, school's almost out. If we're careful, we won't have to see each other ever again.",
        "Casey: I don't want that. Do you?",
        "Maddie: Okay, do you remember opening night of crash? And you told everybody that I was your girlfriend and we danced and kissed.",
        "Casey: Yeah. Not in that order, yeah.",
        "Maddie: The point is, I was really happy.",
        "Casey: So was I.",
        "Maddie: Then you went to Chicago with Gwen and spent the night with her --",
        "Casey: I fell asleep in a diner.",
        "Maddie: With your head on her shoulder -- and don't tell me that it meant nothing, Casey, because ever since you have been back, you've been different.",
        "Casey: No, I haven't.",
        "Maddie: You still have a thing for her, Casey. And I'm just -- and I'm like Susan Hayward in \"Back Street.\"",
        "Casey: Who the hell is Susan Hayward?",
        "Maddie: The other woman.",
        "Casey: What other woman?",
        "Maddie: The point is --",
        "Casey: No, no, it's my turn. You've had enough of your points. Number one, Gwen is my business partner, that's it. Number two, all I want from her are play lists and an occasional set if she feels like singing. Number three, you are my girlfriend.",
        "Maddie: Well then why do you keep pushing me away? It's like you don't even want to be near me.",
        "Casey: Because -- okay, yeah, I have been avoiding getting physical. And it's not because I don't want to, because I do. I'm just -- I'm scared.",
        "Maddie: Of me?",
        "Casey: No, of what could happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: It's time to see the doctor, Mrs. Ryan.",
        "Emily: What? I'm sorry. Can you please call me Emily.",
        "Nurse: Are you all right, Emily?",
        "Emily: They must have dropped off the sonogram when we made the transfer. Can't tell if it's a boy or girl yet. I'm secretly hoping for a girl though, you know? Because I already have a boy. She's going to have to be a very strong little girl. Because I have to give her away, you know. I don't know how to do that. How do you give away a part of yourself?",
        "[Emily sobs]",
        "Nurse: The doctor's waiting, Emily.",

        "Paul: Whatever name this child winds up with, I won't have anything to do choosing it.",
        "Jennifer: Paul, I think just go.",
        "Paul: No, this is important. I've signed away any claim to this kid.",
        "Jennifer: What?",
        "Paul: It's the only solution. I don't want Emily to have this baby. But she's going to have it, and the way I can distance myself is to relinquish paternity.",
        "Jennifer: Paul --",
        "Paul: I've already signed the papers. Dusty, you have something to say?",
        "Dusty: I guarantee you and Emily will be raising that kid side by side before the year is out.",
        "Jennifer: You're talking about an innocent child, a baby, just like Johnny.",
        "Dusty: I'm sorry -- yeah, I'm sorry -- sorry I let him get to me.",
        "Jennifer: He didn't do anything to you. He was looking for Emily.",
        "Dusty: He came in here ten minutes after she got shipped to the ward.",
        "Jennifer: My brother has signed away the rights to his child. That should be enough to prove to you that this isn't some grand conspiracy. And I know that it's hard -- I know. But if you don't let it go, you are gonna spoil everything that we have worked for.",
        "Dusty: You know, Red, when I was just about dead, much worse than the thought of dying was the thought of you finding me like that. So I'd close my eyes and I'd smell your hair.",
        "Jennifer: I'll make you a deal then. If you hold onto that thought and think about you and me and Johnny and the future -- then I will let go of my brother, for good.",
        "Dusty: I can't ask you to give up your brother.",
        "Jennifer: You're not -- you're not asking me. I'm volunteering.",
        "Dusty: Well, give it some time.",
        "Jennifer: No, honey, there's no time. Every time I hear you talk about what happened, I realize that you're never gonna forget what you suffered. And the only way to put it in the past is to put some major space between you and Paul.",
        "[Dusty sighs]",
        "Dusty: I'm -- I'm not gonna let you do that. You're gonna end up hating me for it.",
        "Jennifer: I could never hate you. I love you. And you have been hurt, and I need you to know that I am on your side. So I'm going to ask Paul -- I'm gonna tell Paul that we cannot have any more contact. But I need you to trust me, okay, when I say that you have to let go of this anger. Because it's only gonna make you bitter, and you don't want that. You want to come home, to me and Johnny, and have a life. So no more brooding over Emily and Paul. I just want you to concentrate on the future. I'm gonna go check on the sitter. I have to pick up Johnny. I love you. I'll talk to you later. You think about all that.",

        "Jeweler: I hope that the repair will satisfy Mr. Kasnoff.",
        "Katie: Oh, yes, I'm sure he'll be pleased. Thank you so much, again, for bringing it by here. Keep the change.",
        "Jeweler: Thank you, Mrs. Kasnoff.",
        "Katie: Looks the same to me. Is there any way you can figure out if that's the one you found in Nick's Jacket pocket?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yes, actually, it is. I remember this little notch in the side.",
        "Katie: So this one, the one I found in Mike's box --",
        "Carly: Must be Mike's. And so the medal that Jack found with the body --",
        "Katie: Had to be Nick's. He wasn't trying to clear Mike, he was trying to cover for himself.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Look, Jack, I'm sorry for what I said about Carly. I know it's a lousy situation, and you still love her, and you love the kids.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I do, and it's hard. Which is why I was trying to hedge you off. I don't want you going down the same road.",
        "Meg: Coffee? You know, Snyders like rules. [Jack laughs] And manners, and knowing what goes where and why. And it better damn well be there the next time we check. It's what keeps us safe, and saves us from, God forbid, disappointing Mama. Do you have any idea how low I felt when I lost my nursing license? I just wanted to crawl into the woods, and if I died, I wouldn't have cared.",
        "Jack: You lost your license the same way I lost my badge, by keeping a bad situation from getting worse when what I should have done --",
        "Meg: What? What, Jack? Let your wife go to jail? You tried to protect her, just like I tried to protect Paul.",
        "Jack: But why?! Why do they always need protection?! Why can't they, for once, just follow the rules?!",
        "Meg: Because they can't! They haven't learned them. They had parents like James Stenbeck and Ray Tenney, not people like Mama. They didn't grow up going to church and watching things grow. They just tried to survive from one moment to the next. And that's how they still live. They're afraid of the things that we count on. You know, when I found Paul in the snow, I wanted to call an ambulance, but he was terrified. He doesn't trust anyone but me, and Carly doesn't trust anyone but you and maybe her kids. They need us, Jack, just like we need them.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Meg: Because all that caring's gotta go somewhere. And besides, we're fun. They need us. We're home. Without us, they're lost. And the sooner you understand that and go back to your wife, the sooner you'll be happier.",
        "Jack: Sounds like someone's going to Fiji.",

        "Maddie: How could you be scared of sex? You've already been there.",
        "Casey: I know, and look what happened. I got Gwen pregnant, and I didn't even know it. I acted like a total jerk and lost my best friend. My parents almost wrote me off. I couldn't go to the college that I wanted to go to since I was like 9. And I hurt almost everybody around me, including you. And my son -- my son died, and I didn't even get to hold him. I never even knew him. So yeah, I'm a little gun shy.",
        "Maddie: Well, when you put it like that. Yeah, it's a lot.",
        "Casey: And it's not you. I mean, Maddie, I've wanted to get close to you since, like, forever. But I just -- I don't want to blow it. I mean, Gwen and I are kind of friends. My parents are, like, back on my side now. And Will is starting to relax a little. And you and me, it feels great.",
        "Maddie: I know, and I feel it, too. That's why I bought the condoms.",
        "Casey: But they're not foolproof. Which is not to say that we can't, you know, one day. I'm just -- I'm not ready to take that kind of risk. Not now.",

        "Maddie: Okay. All right. I understand. Thank you for talking to me about it.",
        "Casey: All right, good, because I've got to run back to crash, babe. There's this band, they called from Chicago. They said they were gonna fax a contract in. But the guy sounded a little spaced out on the phone, so I want to make sure they got there.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, okay, go ahead.",
        "Casey: You're sure?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It's your job. I understand. I'll see you later.",

        "Gwen: Nothing. I -- I just can't believe how far we've come. And now, we're graduating. That -- sorry -- that reminds me. Aren't you gonna need a cap and a gown?",
        "Will: Oh, that.",
        "Gwen: I found it in the trash. I thought that maybe you had given up.",

        "Carly: Yeah. Yes, didn't you tell me that that had Mike's DNA on it?",
        "Katie: Well, here's what the report said. I wrote it down. \"The DNA markers are consistent with Michael Kasnoff.\"",

        "Dusty: I'm a duck who promises never to take your mother for granted. And never to sweat the small stuff. I'll keep my mouth shut about your brother and Emily from now on. Just -- you know, my mind might go there from time to time, but I'll work on it. And if I see them, I'll just stay away from them, let you handle it.",
