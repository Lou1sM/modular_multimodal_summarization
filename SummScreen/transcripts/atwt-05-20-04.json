        "Chris: Ali, I didn't mean to do that. I am so, so sorry.",
        "Aaron: Yeah, well, I'm a hundred times sorrier.",
        "Alison: I always ruin everything.",
        "Chris: Don't say that. Okay, you made something beautiful.",
        "Alison: That ended up a million pieces of dried up dirt.",
        "Chris: Why did you grab for it like that?",
        "Alison: Because I didn't want you to show your parents until it was finished.",
        "Chris: But I told you, it was perfect just the way that it was.",
        "Aaron: You know, Chris, maybe she just wanted to make it really nice. Like, wrap it up for you.",
        "Alison: Yeah, with a card and everything! I just wanted to make it really special. The whole presentation, because it was a present.",
        "Chris: They would have loved it.",
        "Alison: But you know, it wasn't even that good. And everyone else in my class is so much better, so, maybe this is, like, an omen, or something. I was thinking about quitting, anyway.",
        "Aaron: Something like that.",
        "Chris: Alison, you have to make another one.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Chris: No, because if you don't, I am going to feel terribly guilty.",
        "Alison: But there's no time.",
        "Chris: This one took no time at all.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Chris: That's my girl. I gotta take this. Thank you.",
        "Aaron: You know, Ali, that's my rent sitting in your hand.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Aaron: Look, I don't want to make things any worse for you, okay?",
        "Alison: I know, its $100, and I'll pay you back as soon as I finish paying back Metro, and after I make a new plate.",
        "Aaron: What, you're gonna do it yourself?",
        "Alison: I have no choice. And neither do you, Aaron, you've got to help me. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: It's time.",
        "Ben: Hey, where'd you come from?",
        "Jessica: I just took another ovulation test, and I still might be fertile.",
        "Ben: Look, your hormones could just be acting up.",
        "Jessica: Well, it's worth a try, right?",
        "Ben: I only have a 15-minute break coming to me.",
        "Jessica: That's plenty of time.",
        "Ben: It'll take us that long just to get home.",
        "Jessica: So, why do we have to go home?",
        "Ben: What are you talking about?",
        "Jessica: An empty broom closet, an empty office, an unoccupied hospital bed.",
        "Ben: You're crazy, do you know that?",
        "Jessica: Yes, I am. I'm crazy about you, and I want to be the mother of your child. So, I don't need soft music and wine and poetry, okay? I just need a little of your time and some privacy. You can give me that, right?",
        "Ben: What if somebody walks in on us while we're --",
        "Jessica: Hey, it's a hospital. Almost everyone who works here has taken biology 101. They'll understand.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: So, where's your ex and her lawyer? Huh? They're not here yet?",
        "Doc: No, they're not. But you are.",
        "Margo: Jessica sent me. She had to stop at the hospital. Some sort of emergency. I don't know what it was. I guess she wanted me to chaperone you.",
        "Doc: If she thinks I need one.",
        "Margo: Yeah, based on your past behavior. And, there's going to be fireworks with an ex in the room, I assume.",
        "Doc: Actually, it's not my ex that's gonna set me off. It's gonna be her lawyer and the money they're after. Which is why I wanted my attorney, but instead, I got a detective. A beautiful detective, mind you, but still a detective.",
        "Margo: Well, I guess Jessica wanted me here as much for me as for you.",
        "Doc: Okay, now what does that mean?",
        "Margo: Because she loves me.",
        "Doc: That's not hard to see why.",
        "Margo: Because maybe she wanted me to see you in action. With a woman that you've had a personal relationship with. As sort of a caution. Not that I need it.",
        "Doc: If you didn't, you wouldn't have rushed over here to see me. This is the best assignment you've had in ages, isn't it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: Well, I don't know what possessed you to protect my job, Paul. But I'm grateful. I promise you, I will dedicate myself to it and B.R.O. It will be my first priority.",
        "Paul: If I had a new wife and new baby, I would make them my first priority.",
        "Jordan: Of course.",
        "Paul: So, what's it going to be?",
        "Jordan: I think I can handle both.",
        "Paul: Great, see that you do.",
        "Jordan: Don't worry, I will. Jen --",
        "Jennifer: Hi, I'm fine. Don't let me keep you.",
        "Paul: That was chilly.",
        "Jennifer: How's Mom?",
        "Paul: She's back to her old self. Tirelessly defending her young, no matter how misguided.",
        "Jennifer: What do you mean?",
        "Paul: She tried to fire Jordan, you know, to protect your honor.",
        "Jennifer: She -- she did?",
        "Paul: Oh, don't worry about it. I hired him back.",
        "Jennifer: What gives you the right to think you decide who does and does not get to make emotional decisions? I don't get it! You've been out to fire him since the day he started. And now -- now, after what he did to me, all of a sudden you think Jordan Sinclair is a big asset to B.R.O.? Do you hate me or what?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: You wanted time? You've got it. Two weeks. Two weeks, Rosanna and I am out of here.",
        "Rosanna: Can I see him now?",
        "Prison guard: Nope.",
        "Rosanna: What?",
        "Prison guard: Mr. Stenbeck said no.",
        "Rosanna: He can't do that!",
        "Prison guard: A prisoner has the right to refuse to see anyone he wants.",
        "Rosanna: No, I have to see him. He has to talk to me. He's about to ruin my life.",
        "Prison guard: I'm real sorry, lady, but he doesn't seem to care.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Here we are, all together. Marilyn, you're looking a bit puffy.",
        "Marilyn: All that crying over you. It's gonna come in handy if we go to court. The jury's gonna love me.",
        "Doc: Uh-huh. This sap must be your ambulance chaser?",
        "Margo: Doc --",
        "Sturmer: You can address me as Mr. Sturmer, Mr. Reese. I specialize in the redistribution of marital assets. As one of the most successful in my field, I've never felt the need to chase a single ambulance.",
        "Doc: Yeah, okay. I'm impressed. Good for you.",
        "Sturmer: Ms. Griffin, I presume. This is Marilyn --",
        "Margo: No, no -- excuse me. No, I'm -- I'm Margo Hughes.",
        "Doc: No, actually, she's Detective Margo Hughes. So behave yourselves.",
        "Marilyn: What crime has he committed now?",
        "Doc: I haven't committed a crime yet, but don't you tempt me.",
        "Margo: I'm just here as a friend. Ms. Griffin's running a bit late. So it's very nice to meet you.",
        "Doc: Yeah, you'll be reconsidering that statement here in a second.",
        "Marilyn: As a friend, huh?",
        "Margo: Well, yes. Why?",
        "Doc: Let the reconsidering begin.",
        "Sturmer: Ms. Griffin and I chose this setting in order to create a situation where a friendly discussion could take place.",
        "Doc: Yeah, a friendly discussion about my money.",
        "Sturmer: It's best not to begin this process as enemies.",
        "Marilyn: No, we aren't beginning this process as enemies. We began our marriage as enemies. He started sleeping around on me before our honeymoon was over.",
        "Doc: And that's a lie.",
        "Marilyn: You met her on our honeymoon!",
        "Doc: Listen, that's something completely different.",
        "Marilyn: He burnt my brand-new sable coat.",
        "Margo: He what?",
        "Doc: She deserted me!",
        "Marilyn: Everyone knew you were sleeping with her.",
        "Doc: Her husband didn't know I was sleeping with her!",
        "Marilyn: He deserved to know!",
        "Sturmer: Marilyn -- we're not here to discuss the causes of your divorce but to settle a legal action involving the destruction of property.",
        "Marilyn: That's right. And that little bonfire you had is gonna cost you. I added up the retail value of my clothes to the amount I'm seeking. That fur coat that went up in flames? I'm gonna love watching you pay for it twice. Now, are you his new girlfriend?",
        "Margo: What? No. I'm a happily married woman, thank you very much.",
        "Marilyn: That's the way he likes them.",
        "Margo: You know what? You got to stop talking to me right now.",
        "Marilyn: You know, the wedding ring is like the sparkly lure that he's always swimming for. Right, Doc?",
        "Sturmer: Back to the matter at hand --",
        "Marilyn: Hell, if they ain't married, where's the challenge? Who cares if you made the big play if the other team isn't any competition? I was a happily married woman before he started wearing me down. Wasn't I, Doc?",
        "Doc: If that's what you say. Really wouldn't know.",
        "Marilyn: No. You wouldn't, would you? 'Cause you don't know me. And you don't know her. Nor do you really care to. But he's working on you, Detective, isn't he? Well, honey, you're just his entertainment this week.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bob: Well, your mother's been taken in for a C.A.T. scan. She's doing great. How about you two? You holding up all right? I know it's difficult when a parent is ill. But her prognosis is very good.",
        "Paul: It is kind of a tense time.",
        "Bob: Of course it is. Well, listen, relax. Take a break. That's what Barbara's gonna have to do. She needs sleep. And the only way she'll get that is with privacy.",
        "Jennifer: Well, we'll do that. Thank you, Uncle Bob. I could use the rest myself.",
        "Bob: Good. Well, I'll call you just as soon as I get the results from the scan.",
        "Paul: Thanks. I'll see you later?",
        "Jennifer: No. You'll explain to me your reasons for rehiring Jordan right now.",
        "Paul: You know, for weeks, everybody's made an objective case as to why Jordan should stay at B.R.O., Mother, especially, needing him around. Okay, now, she's not gonna be in the office. So I decided that I would let her interests guide me, rather than be guided by my own anger. Because we both know where that got us.",
        "Jennifer: I didn't deceive Mom, you did.",
        "Paul: Fine. Where it got me. Listen -- Mom fired Jordan because of you, Jennifer, not because of herself. She needs Jordan around now more than ever.",
        "Jennifer: I'll do anything for Mom. But it's not gonna be a picnic having Jordan and me in the same office. So don't expect miracles.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Kiss Cabot for me, okay? Kiss the baby. Thank you.",
        "Jordan: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Jordan: I got your message. Where've you been?",
        "Rosanna: I had an errand to run.",
        "Jordan: Any news?",
        "Rosanna: We hit a snag.",
        "Jordan: Oh. What do you mean, \"a snag\"?",
        "Rosanna: I need more time.",
        "Jordan: I gave you two weeks. And that's final. I almost lost my job at B.R.O. Because of this marriage fiasco.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean? What happened?",
        "Jordan: Well, Jennifer is Barbara's daughter. And Barbara doesn't like to see her children hurt. So she fired me.",
        "Rosanna: That wasn't supposed to happen.",
        "Jordan: And then, to my shock, Paul rehired me.",
        "Rosanna: Did he say why?",
        "Jordan: I didn't ask him. I just thanked him. So now, since I still have a job -- thanks to Paul Ryan, of all people -- I'm gonna get back to it. Two weeks, just as we agreed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Nurse: Mr. Ryan? You have a phone call.",
        "Paul: Thank you. Hello.",
        "Rosanna: Hi. It's Rosanna. I heard you saved Jordan's job.",
        "Paul: Yes?",
        "Rosanna: Did you do that for me?",
        "Paul: I said I would do anything I could to try and help you.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I want you to trust me again. And safeguarding your husband's job seemed like a small price to pay.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I appreciate that more than I could say.",
        "Paul: Well, you're welcome. You were really there for me, Rosanna, when Rose died. I've -- I've behaved -- well, I -- I owe you. I know that.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm gonna push my luck and ask you for another favor.",
        "Paul: Anything you need. What is it?",
        "Rosanna: Let's put it this way. It won't be as easy as the last one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Okay, so that was a little unromantic.",
        "Ben: A little?",
        "Jessica: Okay, a lot.",
        "Ben: You know, this is the part of becoming a father that I'm actually supposed to enjoy.",
        "Jessica: Do you know what I'm gonna enjoy? Do you know what is the most romantic thing I can think of?",
        "Ben: What's that?",
        "Jessica: You holding our baby.",
        "Ben: And then it's gonna come time to change the diapers, and that little baby's gonna be all yours.",
        "Jessica: It's a deal. Oh, what time is it? I gotta go.",
        "Ben: Wait, wait, wait -- you late for something?",
        "Jessica: A meeting with Doc Reese and his ex-wife. Margo's there refereeing but that's no guarantee.",
        "Ben: Of what?",
        "Jessica: That they haven't already managed to kill each other.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Marilyn: He really got to you, didn't he? The naive detective.",
        "Margo: There is nothing going on between the two of us.",
        "Marilyn: Oh, please. I know him. And it's only a matter of time till he gets you between the sheets.",
        "Margo: You know, there is a very thin line between beauty and disfigured for life. And I am about to push your nose right over it, girl!",
        "Marilyn: No, no, not the face!",
        "Margo: Whoa, whoa, whoa -- oh, Marilyn, Marilyn -- girl, you had a little work done there?",
        "Marilyn: So what if I had?",
        "Margo: Well, so, I'm just wondering how did you pay for that. Considering you're squealing poverty. Because if you billed it to Doc here, then that is technically stealing, isn't it, counselor?",
        "Sturmer: Well --",
        "Doc: Good detective work, Detective. That's why I brought her along. Now, why don't we have a look at those financial records now?",
        "Marilyn: We don't have to show you anything!",
        "Doc: Too late, baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nurse: Can the pieces be glued back together?",
        "Chris: No. That's okay. She's gonna make another one. But thank you anyway.",
        "Bob: What was that?",
        "Chris: Promise not to tell Alison?",
        "Bob: Tell her what?",
        "Chris: That was your anniversary present. But she's gonna make you another one. So you have to promise not tell Mom and you have to act very surprised when you get it.",
        "Bob: She gonna make another one? Isn't that a lot of work?",
        "Chris: Well, she's very invested in this, Dad. And you know, it's not just about the pottery, but it's about pleasing you guys. Okay, she -- she was acting crazy. You know, she wanted it wrapped something about the perfect presentation. She grabbed the plate from me and it dropped. You know, but honestly, I think this has become more of a way for her to prove to you and Mom that she's good enough for me.",
        "Bob: Well, she did get off to kind of a rocky start with us. She's a sensitive kid. I'm sorry -- young woman.",
        "Chris: That's fine. She's just been so stressed about everything lately. And I've been so consumed with work, I haven't had a chance to calm her down.",
        "Bob: Maybe I can arrange something.",
        "Chris: Arrange what?",
        "Bob: I'll give you an hour or two. Something for Alison. Sort of -- sort of a thank you in advance.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: It says that you're supposed to \"measure the volume of clay to predict the size of the piece that you're about to throw.\" Just forget it. This is too technical.",
        "Aaron: I think what it says is that it should look right. Like that. What do you think? Does that look like it can be plate?",
        "Alison: Well, is it going to be a big plate or a small plate?",
        "Aaron: I don't know. Who cares?",
        "Alison: Okay. \"Aim for the center of the wheel and firmly slap or throw down the clay.\" So, yeah, I guess that's why they call it \"throwing the pot.\" Okay. So it here goes.",
        "Aaron: That was a pretty good start.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Honeymoon over already?",
        "Jordan: Pardon me?",
        "Jennifer: Didn't expect the newlywed to be back at work so soon.",
        "Jordan: Well, I'm sure you already heard -- but I was almost fired today. So, since I still have my job, I thought coming in and working would be a step in the right direction.",
        "Jennifer: You married money, Jordan. You don't have to earn it. So go yachting in the Caribbean or something. It won't change anyone's opinion of you if you quit now or in three months.",
        "Jordan: Whether you know it or not, I do have loyalty -- to this company and the people that comprise it. I actually do care --",
        "Jennifer: About the company and the people who comprise it?",
        "Jordan: Can you not make fun of me?",
        "Jennifer: Then tell me the truth and stop talking in riddles. Do you love her?",
        "Jordan: We're married.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, I got that. But what were you suggesting when you said \"it isn't what it seems\"? If your marriage isn't what it seems, then what is it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Rosanna: Thanks so much for coming. Can I offer you something to drink? Red wine? White wine?",
        "Paul: No, no.",
        "Rosanna: Whatever?",
        "Paul: Look -- if you've got a favor, I'd like for you to ask it now.",
        "Rosanna: Do you want some water?",
        "Paul: No. You're making me really nervous. What's the favor?",
        "Rosanna: I know this is strange, but you're the only person I can turn to.",
        "Paul: For what?",
        "Rosanna: I don't think he'll talk to anybody else.",
        "Paul: Who's he?",
        "Rosanna: Look, just promise me something -- okay? Promise me that you will consider this? That you won't walk out.",
        "Paul: I'm willing to consider anything, Rosanna. But you've got to tell me what it is that I'm considering.",
        "Rosanna: Will you talk to your father for me?",
        "Paul: No. Absolutely not. Talk -- Rosanna, talk to him about what?",
        "Rosanna: About my baby. About Cabot.",
        "Paul: You think my father's behind Cabot being here? And this whole thing with Jordan?",
        "Rosanna: Maybe. I -- I don't know.",
        "[Paul laughs]",
        "Paul: Rosanna -- if James Stenbeck is behind this, I don't think I can help you. I don't think anybody can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Rosanna: You said that I could call on you at any time if I needed you. I need you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: If it'll make you feel any better, why don't you just hit me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look, I can't lose my baby again. All I need you to do is to convince James to see me. You don't have to do anything else. Just help me get a meeting with the man. He may not even be involved. Just -- please, just get him -- get him to talk to me.",
        "Paul: May not be -- listen, if something -- if something funny's going on, James Stenbeck is your number-one suspect. I mean, this kind of stuff really just makes his day. He's the one, right? He's behind all of this. I can't believe I'm surprised. After all the things that he's done in my lifetime alone, you'd think I would stop being shocked. What does he want from you?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know. We had a deal and now, suddenly, everything's changed. All the rules have changed.",
        "Paul: Sounds like my dad. All right, tell me. Tell me everything.",
        "Rosanna: Okay, but before I go into it, you have to understand that my life and my baby's life are at stake here. No one can know that Stenbeck is involved.",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. Okay. While I was away, after I lost Cabot, he sent an emissary, Annabelle Fettle. She came to see me.",
        "Paul: What, the adoption lady?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Paul: How long has she been working for him?",
        "Rosanna: I don't know.",
        "Paul: Well, that might be a good thing for you to find out.",
        "Rosanna: Look, all I know is that James said I could get Cabot back if I married Jordan Sinclair. And if I didn't that Cabot would disappear off the face of the earth.",

        "Jennifer: You wanted me to wonder, didn't you? If you hadn't have said, \"it isn't what it seems,\" then I would've just thought you married for the money. But it's not fair to just drop a statement like that and then walk away.",

        "Jordan: Two weeks. Okay? Just please -- just give me two weeks.",
        "Jennifer: I don't think you're gonna get much out of the marriage in two weeks, Jordan. You might want to hold out for a year, maybe two, if you want the really big bucks. And if you think that I'm gonna hang around and be the warm body that you turn to after you leave Rosanna's bed, you're wrong.",

He talked me into listening to him, and -- getting revenge, and I was supposed to get back at her for the way that she humiliated me, or the way that he thought that she humiliated -- or that I thought that -- is any of this making any sense?",

For my own sanity, for the safety of the people around me. He's at the root of every bad thing that I have ever done to anybody. I mean, when I decided that I was gonna get my revenge on Craig, I didn't think about you. I didn't think about what would happen to you, that you could lose Cabot the way that you did. I wasn't thinking about that at all because my father was behind the whole thing. He was poisoning me. And now, you're asking me to -- to give him a chance to reawaken all of that.",
