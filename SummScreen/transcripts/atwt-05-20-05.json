        "Rosanna: What about him?",
        "Mya: A man like that shouldn't be around children. And for him to have your baby --",

        "Rosanna: Because he's a monster who's decided that I am never gonna see my child again. Craig is gonna get me and Cabot out of here.",
        "Mya: How will he do this?",
        "Rosanna: I've given him access to certain resources.",
        "Mya: Friends?",

        "Mya: You trust this man's promises?",

        "Bank officer: Nevertheless, without her authorization --",
        "Craig: Well, why would I have all of her account numbers and access codes and all the other pertinent information if I wasn't an authorized party?",
        "Bank officer: As you yourself admitted, this is highly irregular.",
        "Craig: I have satisfied every possible security precaution. Time is of the essence here, man, so can we get on with this transaction, please? Now, now -- now, that isn't necessary. I've done everything that is required.",

        "Katie: Sounds like fun. I can't wait.",

        "Barbara: She's also a grown woman with a husband. A very attentive husband at that, who will make sure that nothing happens to her.",
        "Mike: Okay, but she's running late. And for her to not even call -- this just doesn't make sense.",
        "Barbara: You know what? I'm sure there's a very simple explanation that we will find out, eventually. In the meantime, a lot of people have worked very hard for this evening for Jennifer and for you, so let's not ruin it. Alright, Mike?",

        "Mya: Perhaps your friend will come back to get more information.",
        "Rosanna: No, no. What if he can't. What if the bank thinks he's trying to steal the money, and they have him arrested?",

        "Mya: I can't! Okay, forgive me, but like you, I have a little boy. If Q catches me, he'll kill my son.",
        "Rosanna: Then what am I gonna do?",
        "Mya: Have faith. You said your friend was a diabolical liar. That means he's clever, no?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, you're right. He's clever. Resourceful. If anyone can find a way out of this, Craig can. He will. You're right. I'm sure he will.",

        "Mya: Why does he hate you?",
        "Rosanna: Because he thought he could force me into marrying him, and that I could pretend my flesh didn't crawl at the thought of him. I just couldn't touch him.",

        "Craig: Yes, and strange things have happened.",
        "Rosanna: Really?",
        "Craig: Suffice to say, I was then framed for something I didn't do and forced to leave the country.",
        "Rosanna: Why?",
        "Craig: Well, because I wanted to be a father to my child, and Jennifer and her babbling followers couldn't accept that.",
        "Rosanna: So that's how you figured out my password. You know that losing Cabot would just be more than I could bear.",

        "Carly: You know something, Jack? I've been a cop's wife now for a while, and I know that I should be used to it. But when I heard you were on that transport van with Les Sweeny, all I could think of was Starziak, and how you went over that bridge.",
        "Jack: Hey, I'm okay, babe. I'm here, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Carly: When I was standing on that bridge, I felt so helpless. And I couldn't protect you. You don't know what that feels like.",
        "Jack: Of course I do, you kidding me? It's the same way I felt when I came home and I found out what Les did to you. Same way I felt when J.J. broke his leg. And when I heard what happened to Parker, him almost drowning in the pond, honey -- I wish I could always be there, so I could keep you all from harm.",
        "Carly: You can. You stay safe. You stay alive. Because I cannot go through losing you again, Jack. I need you. We all need you. I just thank God that I got there when I did.",

        "Jennifer: When I was a little girl, I used to dream that I would marry a man who was as honest and as brave as my father. And as handsome as a fairy tale hero. As true as the day is long. But then, when I grew up, of course -- I told myself that it was just a dream that couldn't come true. But then I met you. I never knew what love was until we met. But now, after all the laughter, and all the tears, and all the bumps in the road, I now know exactly what love is. It's you. You've opened up my heart. Taught me to trust. Taught me that no matter what happens in life, true love never dies. If I had a star for every time you made me smile, I'd hold the universe in my hands. I will cherish you, and everything that you are, and everything that you've given me. And I know that, no matter what the future holds, that we'll always get through it, together. I love you.",
        "Mike: I love you. I guess I'm going to be the optimist in the family, because I always knew we'd be standing here one day, one way or another. There's no way in the world that I could ever let you go. I don't know how or when it happened, but you're part of me, Jen. Part of my life, my future, my everything. I love the way you think. I love the way you dream. Your beauty, your courage -- not a day goes by, I won't name in only nothing you are the love of my life, and the peace in my heart. The girl of my dreams. Thank you for saying yes to the adventure that's ahead of us. I can't wait.",
