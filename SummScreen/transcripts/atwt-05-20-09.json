        "Katie tries to comfort Vienna, as they wait to see the doctor. Noone can find Henry, who is at a poker game trying to win Brad and Katie back their money they lost with the lawyer. Vienna learns devastating news \u0096 her baby didn't survive. Katie admits to Brad it is her fault. Brad goes looking for Henry, who hides from him when he shows up at a poker game thinking he is there to punch him out. Brad and Katie take home a distraught Vienna, who is leaning on Katie for support. Katie continues to wrestle with the fact that Vienna tripped going after her. Henry finally shows up at Brad and Katie's with a gift for the baby and all of their $10,000, as Vienna has to break the news to him. Henry is shocked, as he walks Vienna back to bed. He comes back out and wants to know what happened, as Katie explains again. An angry Henry blames Katie for this, as she tries to talk to him. He isn't interested in listening because she clearly didn't want them to have a baby once she found out she couldn't have theirs. Brad tries to calm him down and remind him that Katie is devastated too, as this incites Henry more because it is always about Katie. He and Vienna just lost their baby and he has to worry about Katie's feelings. A furious Henry takes Vienna home, as Brad and Katie try to stop him, but he has nothing to say to them. Katie tells Brad that everything Henry said was true, as Brad tries to comfort her. Henry and Vienna try to comfort one another in their grief. When Vienna goes to sleep, Henry watches his taped video to his baby-to-be, as emotions get the best of him. Meg, Dusty and Damian arrive at Fairwinds only to find Paul has left with Eliza. When Meg realizes he is trying to withdraw a large sum of money and has taken his passport, she becomes distraught. Dusty goes in search of Paul and what bank he is trying to get money from while Damian stays behind with Meg and tries to comfort her. Paul is one step ahead of Dusty and is able to elude him when he heads to an airstrip to charter a plane one-way. Meg realizes that Paul would never fly commercial because he has a pilot license and when Dusty comes back and tells them that Paul has withdrawn his money and is probably headed out of town, Meg is near inconsolable. Damian promises to use his contacts at the airstrip to see if he can stop him while Dusty and Meg talk with Bonnie, who warns them to let the police and she do her job. Since Paul has custody and technically, he hasn't done anything wrong yet, they have to tread lightly, but based on the fact that the babysitter is talking to police, she can file for an injunction to stop Paul from taking any trips. They have to do it by the book, as Dusty is sure they will be too late if they go that route. Paul charters a plane, but before he can leave, Damian comes looking for him and Paul is forced to flee. He ends up leaving his car abandoned to find another means of transportation. Damian gives Meg the news of another dead end and she is more upset thinking she caused Paul to run by her actions. Dusty goes to see if the police have anything new, as Meg and Damian go to where he saw Paul's car abandoned. Bonnie thinks Dusty is causing a distraction because of how he is acting and advises him to not continue on the way he is going. Meg and Damian find Paul's car, as Meg has another set of keys. She becomes emotional when she finds Eliza's bib in the backseat. Damian promises she will get Eliza back, and that no harm will be done to her. Meg promises that she will never forget or forgive Paul this time. While walking down a street, Paul sees a woman walking nearby who resembles Rosanna, but he thinks his eyes are playing tricks on him. The woman seems to notice Paul and ducks out of the way, but when Eliza gets fussy, Paul chalks it up to an illusion. Rosanna secretly watches Paul walk away."

        "Meg: Paul? Paul!",
        "Damian: Paul!",
        "Meg: He's not here.",
        "Dusty: It's a big house. He might be anywhere.",
        "Meg: His car wasn't in the driveway, Dusty, and he's not picking up his phone -- I know what that means.",
        "Damian: You want to check upstairs?",
        "Meg: I can't believe this is happening again. He knew it. He knew it -- he knew it was just a matter of time before he would be forced to give Eliza back to me, and he took off!",
        "Damian: I'm sorry, I feel this is all my fault. I never should've left him alone with her.",
        "Meg: It's not -- it's not your fault. This is what Paul does. He runs.",
        "Damian: Then he's a coward.",
        "Meg: You know, I thought this would be all over when we found the babysitter, and now, God only knows where he's gone. What?",
        "Damian: You know, I'm sure this drawer wasn't open, uh, when I was here before. It looks like Paul went through it in a hurry. What does he keep in here that he might need?",
        "Meg: His passport.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What do you say, baby girl? Take you for a ride in an airplane, huh? We'll go up, up, up -- up, up, and away. Just you and me. Yeah, we'll go someplace no one will ever find us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Paul's not upstairs.",
        "Meg: His passport's gone.",
        "Dusty: Well, Eliza doesn't have a passport, does she? He can't take her anywhere out of the country without a passport.",
        "Meg: He knows people, Dusty. He's had passports faked before, he's not gonna hesitate to do it again.",
        "Damian: So you're certain he's planning on leaving the country with her.",
        "Meg: Yes. We need to get to the airport and stop him.",
        "Damian: Wait, wait. Something tells me he hasn't gotten there yet.",
        "Dusty: Why not?",
        "Damian: Because when I was here before, he was on the phone with the bank.",
        "Dusty: You said Paul's babysitter was trying to shake him down for more money, how much?",
        "Damian: $50,000. But it didn't sound as if he was having much luck getting it.",
        "Meg: And once he knew Sally was arrested, why would he go ahead and go to the bank anyway?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause he needs $50,000 in cash for himself. Cash, so he's not traced.",
        "Damian: What bank does Paul use?",
        "Meg: Oakdale National. But he could have accounts all over town that I don't know about.",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna go to every bank until I find him. Call Jack, bring him up to speed. I'll call you when I know something.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Where's Henry? Why -- why isn't he here yet?",
        "Katie: He's coming, he'll be here soon. Are you okay, has the pain stopped?",
        "Vienna: Yes, that's a good sign, isn't it? That's a good sign, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I think it is, I think it should be, yeah.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, at first, I was so scared because the pain was so sharp, and now I feel that there's nothing to be worried about, nothing to be worried about.",
        "Katie: And the doctor said he'll be in any minute to do the sonogram.",
        "Vienna: Right, and then we can have another picture of Sven for his baby book -- right?",
        "Katie: Right. Okay, you're going to be okay. I will be right outside, I'll come right back in when the doctor's done, okay?",
        "Vienna: Promise?",
        "Katie: I promise -- okay?",
        "Brad: How is she?",
        "Katie: She's trying to convince herself that everything's going to be okay, and I want to believe her, but I'm so scared.",
        "Brad: Well, I just saw the doctor go in.",
        "Katie: They're gonna do a sonogram. Did I tell you that she's not in pain anymore?",
        "Brad: Well, that's a -- I mean, that's a good thing, right?",
        "Katie: I don't know. Oh, I just keep thinking if Vienna had not come by the studio --",
        "Brad: Katie.",
        "Katie: If I hadn't gotten so mad and walked away from her --",
        "Brad: Don't do that.",
        "Katie: And just let her apologize, she wouldn't have followed me and fallen!",
        "Brad: Why are you doing this to yourself?",
        "Katie: You didn't hear it, you did not hear the fall, it was horrible! If anything happens to that baby --",
        "Brad: Nothing is going to happen to the baby.",
        "Katie: How do you know?",
        "Brad: I just do. All right, now? You have to believe that, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: That, gentlemen, is what they call a royal flush.",
        "Man: Come on, man!",
        "Henry: It's a pity to see grown men cry. Especially you, Bruno.",
        "Bruno: Take the money.",
        "Henry: Ah! Ah, yes, come to papa. I do believe today is going to be my lucky day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: They won't put out an APB.",
        "Damian: Why not?",
        "Meg: They said it's not against the law for Paul to leave the house with Eliza.",
        "Damian: Yeah. What about Jack, were you able to talk to him?",
        "Meg: He's on a stakeout. They said they would try to get word to him if they can.",
        "Damian: Then I suggest you call your lawyer. You know, maybe there's something in the custody agreement that says that Paul can't take Eliza across state lines without permission.",
        "Meg: That's not gonna stop him, Damian. He's taken off with her before, he's not gonna think twice about doing it again. And this time -- this time, he's gonna take precautions to make sure that he doesn't get caught!",
        "Damian: All right, uh -- Dusty's looking into the banks. Maybe you're right. Maybe we should go to the airport. If Paul's already on his way, we could cut him off before he gets there.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no, he's not gonna take a commercial flight. He's a pilot, he's gonna -- he's gonna get his own plane and fly it himself. And God only knows where he'd go.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: It's Dusty. Hey, did you find him?",
        "Dusty: Not yet. I'm still checking out banks. Anything on your end?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Dusty: Don't give up, we're going to find them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Okay, baby girl, come on, let's -- why -- why don't you let Daddy hold on to the green stuff, okay? You hold on to the envelope. You ready? Yeah! Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Bonnie's on her way.",
        "Damian: Good. Maybe she'll be able to make more headway with the police than we could.",
        "Meg: Dusty, why are you back? I thought you were looking for Paul.",
        "Dusty: I was five minutes too late.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Dusty: You re right, he went to the bank.",
        "Damian: How much did he take?",
        "Dusty: All of it.",
        "Meg: Was Eliza with him?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Oh, God.",
        "Dusty: I know where he's going.",
        "Damian: Where?",
        "Dusty: To an airport to charter a plane.",
        "Meg: We thought the same thing.",
        "Dusty: There's an airfield off of Route 31.",
        "Damian: I know it.",
        "Dusty: Let's get over there.",
        "Damian: No, I'll go, you stay here with Meg.",
        "Meg: Damian.",
        "Damian: Look, I have a few contacts. They may be able to -- to help me once I get there.",
        "Meg: You don't have to do this.",
        "Damian: I want to.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Damian: If Paul is there, he won't get away. I won't let him leave the country with your daughter, I promise.",
        "Dusty: Meg.",
        "Meg: We have to find them, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: I know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I need to charter one of your planes, one-way. You think you can make that happen?",
        "Mr. Byrd: Depends upon where you're going.",
        "Paul: No offense, but I already have a travel agent.",
        "Mr. Byrd: My planes don't come cheap.",
        "Paul: I think that ought to cover it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: I know this isn't what you want to hear, but the police are right.",
        "Dusty: Right about what?",
        "Bonnie: Technically, Paul hasn't broken the law.",
        "Meg: Bonnie, he could be leaving the country with Eliza right now.",
        "Bonnie: But there's no evidence to suggest that he's done anything more than take Eliza with him to run some errands.",
        "Meg: Y-you think he's just running errands? He emptied out his bank account! His passport is gone!",
        "Bonnie: Look, the bottom line is, at this point in time, Paul still has custody. He is well within his rights to travel with Eliza if he chooses to do so.",
        "Meg: Oh, okay, okay, so you're saying there's nothing we can do to stop him?",
        "Bonnie: There are no grounds for the police to hold him on, Meg.",
        "Meg: Bonnie, if we don't stop him, he's going to disappear with my daughter.",
        "Dusty: Damian caught him trying to pay off his babysitter again. This guy should not have custody of her to begin with.",
        "Bonnie: I know that, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: Then let's do something about it.",
        "Bonnie: Look, hey, I am on Meg's side here, try to remember that. This woman, the babysitter?",
        "Meg: Sally.",
        "Bonnie: Has she given her statement to the police?",
        "Meg: Yes. She told them that Paul paid her to leave Eliza with him, and that was the day that he started the fire at the farm.",
        "Bonnie: Now, does Paul know about this?",
        "Meg: Yes, he found out from Damian that she was in police custody, and soon after, that's when he disappeared with Eliza.",
        "Bonnie: All right. I can file an immediate injunction to keep him from leaving town with the baby while the custody situation is under review. Given that he's run off with Eliza before, it won't be hard to prove that he's a flight risk.",
        "Meg: And then the police will go after him?",
        "Bonnie: Yes, once the papers are filed, yes.",
        "Dusty: We can't wait that long.",
        "Meg: Where are you going?",
        "Dusty: I'm gonna find Paul.",
        "Bonnie: No, you're not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: There he is, there, there, that's my baby right there, right? Did I say something wrong? It's not a boy, it's a girl, I'm having a girl? No, wait, turn it back on. I want to see my baby. Turn it back on. I want to see her again.",
        "Doctor: I wish there were something more I could do here.",
        "Vienna: Wh-what do you mean? What do you mean?",
        "Doctor: The ultrasound shows there's no fetal heartbeat.",
        "Vienna: No, of course there is, of course there is! I-I-I -- of course there is, I just -- I just saw --",
        "Doctor: Vienna, Vienna, you've lost the baby.",
        "Vienna: No! No, no, no, no, it was right there, I just saw him right there, I just saw him -- it's your machine. Just get another machine.",
        "Doctor: I am so sorry.",
        "Vienna: Get a new machine! No. No. No, no. No. My baby's not dead. No, no!",
        "Katie: Oh, my God.",
        "Brad: Katie, I'm -- I'm sorry, I -- I really --",
        "Katie: Tell me this isn't happening, please, tell me this isn't happening!",
        "Brad: I wish I could. I mean, these things -- I mean, you know more than anyone how unfair it is, but, I mean, these -- these things happen.",
        "Katie: No, not this, this is not happening. Where is Henry? She needs him right now! Where is he?",
        "Brad: I'll call him again.",
        "Katie: No, don't call him, go, you've got to go find him, go find him and bring him back here, now.",
        "Brad: Okay, I will, I promise, I promise.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. Okay.",
        "Vienna: Please!",
        "Katie: Vienna? I'm sorry, Honey, I'm so, so sorry.",
        "Vienna: Gone. My baby's gone.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Vienna: Why?",
        "Katie: I'm so sorry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'm in.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Henry: Ignore that.",
        "Brad: Henry, come on, man, I know you're in there, open up.",
        "Henry: Really ignore that.",
        "Brad: Henry?",
        "Henry: Listen, Dodge, um, I'm not here.",
        "Dodge: Yeah, you are.",
        "Henry: No, I mean, could you go to the door and tell this guy that I'm not here. Uh, this guy means to do me bodily harm, okay? And if he breaks my fingers, I can't finish the game. And since -- since this hand is gonna make someone very, very rich, could you please go and get rid of him? Please?",
        "Brad: Is, uh, Henry Coleman in here?",
        "Dodge: Sorry, there's no Henry Coleman in here.",
        "Brad: Well, the bartender downstairs says that he's here. Look, I don't care about your game, I just -- I really need to talk to him, it's urgent.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh, why did this happen? One moment, I'm having Henry's baby, and then the next --",
        "Katie: I know, I'm so sorry.",
        "Vienna: I did everything right, didn't I? I-I exercised, I had my vitamins. I -- I did my diet --",
        "Katie: You did everything.",
        "Vienna: I read all the books!",
        "Katie: I know, it's not your fault, none of this is your fault.",
        "Vienna: Oh, my God, I can still feel him.",
        "Katie: Do you need anything?",
        "Vienna: I feel, no, I feel him, if I put my hands on my belly, I feel him.",
        "Katie: There's nothing I can do?",
        "Vienna: No. Why did this happen? Why, why, why did it happen? It was the shoes, my shoes, I shouldn't have worn the high heels, I shouldn't have worn the high heels.",
        "Katie: No, no, it was just an accident.",
        "Vienna: Why did I do that? The stupid shoes!",
        "Katie: It was a horrible, horrible accident.",
        "Vienna: Where's Henry? Where's Henry? Why isn't Henry here?",
        "Katie: He's coming.",
        "Vienna: Why --where is he? I don't understand, where is he?",
        "Katie: He'll be here as soon as he can, okay?",
        "Vienna: Oh, I've never needed Henry more than I need him now.",
        "Katie: I know, I know, Sweetheart. I know you do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dodge: See? I told you, Henry's not here.",
        "Brad: All right, well, if he comes up here --",
        "Dodge: I'll give him the message.",
        "Henry: Thank you, Dodge. I literally dodged a bullet. Remind me to get you some pepparkakor sometime.",
        "Dodge: You should know, that guy said it was urgent.",
        "Henry: Yeah, urgent to break my knees. You know what's urgent to me? Winning this hand. Because 10 grand can buy me a lot of forgiveness.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Bonnie: The best thing you could do right now is nothing.",
        "Meg: Damian's already gone out to the airfield. What if he finds Paul?",
        "Bonnie: If he finds Paul, you tell him to call the police.",
        "Dusty: They're not interested in helping us.",
        "Bonnie: Well, now you have me, so let me do my job.",
        "Dusty: What do we do in the meantime?",
        "Bonnie: Stay put. If I need your help, I'll let you know.",
        "Dusty: I'll keep my phone on.",
        "Bonnie: I know it must seem like we're spinning our wheels here, but we're not. Getting the judge to sign this injunction is the first step.",
        "Meg: I just want my daughter back.",
        "Bonnie: I know. I want that for you, too. Keep an eye on him for me, will you, okay?",
        "Dusty: I can't believe she wants us to sit tight while she sorts through this red tape. You okay?",
        "Meg: This was my fault.",
        "Dusty: Your fault, how's that?",
        "Meg: Because I left, Dusty. I walked out that door, and I left her behind.",
        "Dusty: You did what you thought was best for your daughter.",
        "Meg: Only it wasn't, was it? It was a terrible mistake. I handed her right to him. And I could end up paying for that for the rest of my life.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mr. Byrd: You don't want to tell me where you're going?",
        "Paul: That money you're holding is all the information you need, is that clear? Great. Can I go see the plane now?",
        "Damian: Danny Byrd? Damian Grimaldi, Grimaldi shipping. I hear from friends of mine that you are the go-to guy for private planes in the area, and that your rental policies are, shall we say, quite discreet?",
        "Mr. Byrd: What do you want?",
        "Damian: Your cooperation. I'm looking for a man and a baby, a little girl. I think he might be coming around, trying to rent one of your planes. Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it. All you have to do is keep him here and on the ground. Do we have a deal?",
        "Damian: What do you mean, he's gone? The man gave you a small fortune to hold one of your planes for him, and I doubled it for you to keep him here.",
        "Mr. Byrd: The guy didn't waste any time, what can I say?",
        "Damian: The hell with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Sorry about your airplane ride, Sweetie. Daddy blew a bunch of cash on that, but don't worry, I still have enough money left to buy us a cheap, used car. And I'm gonna use that car to get the hell out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Katie?",
        "Katie: Yes, I'm right here. Hi. Hey...",
        "Vienna: I'm not pregnant anymore?",
        "Katie: No, no, you're not.",
        "Vienna: This just doesn't seem real.",
        "Katie: I know. Do you want something to drink? The doctor says that you should probably drink some water.",
        "Vienna: No. I just want my baby back. I woke up this morning and everything was perfect. And now I just -- I feel empty.",
        "Katie: I know. I know, Sweetheart, it's a horrible, horrible feeling. But you're gonna get through this. You hear me? You are gonna get through this fine.",
        "Vienna: I was so happy. I was so happy, Henry was so happy. Where is Henry? Where is Henry? Why isn't he here?",
        "Katie: I -- I don't know. Brad's looking for him.",
        "Vienna: But I want my Henry.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Vienna: I need him here.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Brad: Hey.",
        "Vienna: Is Henry out there with you, is he outside, Henry?",
        "Brad: No, I'm sorry, I -- I'm sorry, I couldn't find him.",
        "Vienna: I don't understand. Where is he?",
        "Katie: It'll be okay.",
        "Brad: I talked to the doctor.",
        "Katie: You did?",
        "Brad: Yeah, well, he, you know, he says, uh, as soon as you get enough rest, you can come home with us.",
        "Vienna: Home?",

        "Vienna: And Henry?",
        "Brad: I -- I'm sure he'll find us, I left messages for him all over.",
        "Vienna: Thank you.",
        "Brad: Vienna, you don't have to thank us.",
        "Vienna: I do. You've been so good to me. And you stayed here. I used to be --",

        "Meg: Damian, what happened at the airfield?",
        "Damian: Paul was there.",
        "Meg: Did you see him? Did you see Eliza?",
        "Dusty: Did you call the police?",
        "Damian: There was no reason to. You were right, he was trying to rent a plane. But he must've seen me and gotten scared off.",
        "Meg: Okay, so where is he now?",
        "Damian: I don't know. But at least I know he hasn't gotten off the ground.",
        "Dusty: That means he can't be too far away.",
        "Damian: I agree. I think I might've found his car.",
        "Meg: Where?",
        "Damian: Abandoned on the side of the road, near the airfield.",
        "Meg: Okay, well, I need to go see it.",
        "Dusty: Go ahead, and I'm gonna go down to the police station and try to light a fire under these guys.",
        "Meg: Okay, listen, don't do anything that's gonna have you thrown into jail, okay? I need you to listen to Bonnie.",
        "Dusty: Don't worry, don't worry about me, focus on getting your daughter back.",
        "Damian: He cares about you a great deal.",
        "Meg: He just hates Paul more than I ever could.",
        "Damian: I said he cares about you , Meg. Paul has nothing to do with that. Come on, we should go.",

        "Henry: Ah, thank goodness, you're still here.",
        "Brad: Aww, man, where have you -- where have you been? We've been trying -- I've been looking for you, I mean, I really freaked out.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no, I know, I've been sort of incommunicado, here, but when you hear the reason why -- forget about hearing, why don't you take a look. Here, hold Mr. Fuzzy. Okay, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it. Take a gander at that.",
        "Brad: Okay, what -- money?",
        "Henry: It's 10 grand, it's all yours.",
        "Brad: Mine?",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, I wanted to square things with you and Katie. Katie, Katie! Yeah, here.",
        "Katie: What? Why are you giving us money?",
        "Henry: Because, I wanted -- I wanted to pay back the money that that shyster lawyer took from you.",
        "Katie: You don't have to do that.",
        "Henry: Yes, I do! Yes, I do, I'm the one -- I'm the one that put you guys into contact with him. And, sure, I was just trying to do a good thing, but -- but I should've checked his credentials, I should've looked at the degrees up one side and down the other. But I got ahead of myself, I jumped the gun, because I knew how much you guys wanted a baby and I just wanted to give that to you, and --",
        "Katie: Henry --",
        "Henry: No, I -- I want to tell you right now, I promise both of you that's it, I will never, ever interfere again, I promise. I am sorry, I am so sorry. I know that this won't make up for all of it, but maybe it can be a start.",
        "Brad: Okay, we don't care about the money, I mean, we really -- we don't.",
        "Henry: Uh, well, I do. Keep it. I mean, I got some extra left over, I bought Mr. Fuzzy here.",
        "Katie: You got that for the baby?",
        "Henry: Well, yeah, he's not exactly the kind of teddy I normally bring to bed with me, if you know what I'm saying.",
        "Katie: Henry, listen, we need to talk to you.",
        "Henry: You're right, that was a bad joke, and I'm sorry. I know -- I know you guys are -- are upset, and -- and I know that, Vienna knows that, and -- and you have every right to be.",
        "Katie: It's just -- it's not that.",
        "Henry: If you guys could just find it in your hearts somewhere in the future to forgive us -- this baby means so much to Vienna and me.",
        "Vienna: Henry.",
        "Henry: Hey -- hey, what are you doing here?",
        "Vienna: The baby's gone.",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Katie: Vienna had a miscarriage.",
        "Brad: Yeah, that's why we were trying to find you.",
        "Henry: Miscarriage, what?",
        "Katie: It all happened so fast -- she came by the studio to talk to me, to apologize, but I'd just found out that the adoption was fake, and so I was freaking out, I walked away, she tried to follow me, and I guess she tripped over one of the floor lamps and she fell --",
        "Henry: Okay, I got it, I got it.",
        "Katie: We've been trying to get a hold of you.",
        "Henry: Come on, come on, let's get you off your feet. Let's go back to bed, here.",
        "Katie: Did you see his face?",
        "Brad: C'mere, c'mere, c'mere.",
        "Katie: Vienna was right, it broke his heart.",
        "Brad: Oh, you know, he's here, he's here, Honey, you know, he's here, and he's with her, they're -- they're gonna get through this.",
        "Katie: Oh, God.",
        "Henry: How in the hell did this happen?",
        "Katie: It was like I said, she came by the studio --",
        "Henry: You know, she was fine when I left her, and so was our baby, and then she went to see you.",
        "Katie: It was an accident, Henry, it was a horrible, horrible accident. I'm so sorry.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'm -- sorry, Katie, it doesn't sound like an accident to me at all.",
        "Henry: She went there to see you.",
        "Katie: I know.",
        "Henry: Yeah, she brought you gifts, t-shirts -- did you see them?",
        "Katie: She tried to give them to me.",
        "Henry: And you didn't want them?",
        "Brad: Henry.",
        "Katie: I had just found out that the lawyer was a fake, I -- I was upset and reeling, I just wanted to be alone.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay, I can understand how you must've felt that way. Did you think for a second how Vienna felt? You think it was easy for her to come to you, knowing that you blamed her for everything?",
        "Katie: No, I know, I know it wasn't easy, Henry.",
        "Henry: I mean, did that -- she was begging you to forgive her, that's all she wanted.",
        "Katie: I know, and I -- I wish -- I wish, at the time, I was able to see past my own feelings, but I just -- I couldn't, I'm sorry.",
        "Henry: You're sorry?!",
        "Katie: Yes!",
        "Henry: Yeah, so, why did you walk away, then? She just wanted a couple of seconds, a few minutes, of your time!",
        "Katie: I don't know! I didn't know she was going to follow me.",
        "Henry: You didn't know she was going to follow you? She's been following you for days, we both have, we've been trying to put our friendship back together. You know what I think happened?",
        "Brad: Henry.",
        "Henry: No. I think that she was so concerned about you, and she was so focused on your pain, that she wasn't thinking about herself, or our baby, and that's why she didn't see the lamp, that's why she fell.",
        "Brad: Hey, Henry, why don't -- why don't we just sit down.",
        "Henry: I don't wanna sit down right now.",
        "Katie: Henry, please, just let us help you.",
        "Henry: Help me? Why, have you forgiven us, is that why you want to help now?",
        "Katie: What happened today was devastating to all of us.",
        "Henry: You, always got the right words. Where was that compassion when it could've done some good?",
        "Henry: Vienna lost the baby because of you. It's your fault, and don't tell me you're sorry when I know that you're not.",
        "Katie: Don't say that!",
        "Henry: No as soon as you found out that this child wasn't yours, you cut us off.",
        "Katie: That is not true.",
        "Henry: You just shut us out!",
        "Katie: That is not true!",
        "Brad: Okay, all right, all right, all right. All right, all right, listen, listen to me, listen to me, like, I really understand, okay, you're upset right now, and what happened is beyond awful, but you don't wanna take it out on Katie, you just need to take some time and just cool down.",
        "Henry: I need to what? I need to take some time, Brad? How much time am I supposed to take, here? How much time to get over the death of my unborn child? Should I take, like, a day? Should I pencil it in next Tuesday, what? How about never, Brad!",
        "Brad: You know what? Take however much time you need, but -- all right? Hey, you don't wanna treat Katie like this. Come on, look at her. She's suffering, too. She's your best friend. There is no way that she would want this to happen to you or Vienna -- that she would wish this on you. I mean, you -- you know her better than that.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know her. It's always all about you.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Henry: My baby is gone, and Vienna is shattered, but I gotta watch what I say because we can't upset Katie.",
        "Katie: No, no, no. You say -- say -- say whatever you want need, it's okay.",
        "Henry: No, it's not okay, this is real, and this is the real deal, okay, so why don't you just admit it? That, when you found out that we weren't gonna give you this child, that you didn't want us to have him either.",
        "Katie: What?!",
        "Henry: Come on.",
        "Vienna: Where are we going?",
        "Henry: I'm taking you home. Easy.",
        "Katie: Where are you going?",
        "Vienna: Henry says -- he says we're leaving.",
        "Katie: Well, if you need anything, anything, anything at all, please, please call us.",
        "Brad: Here, Henry, you -- you take this, I mean, here, the important -- the money, it's not important to us.",
        "Vienna: What money?",
        "Henry: Don't worry about it, Sweetie.",
        "Katie: Here, let me just get --",

        "Bonnie: These things take time, Dusty.",

        "Dusty: What the hell are they waiting for? This guy's gonna leave the country with a baby girl!",
        "Bonnie: You need to step back and calm down. You're acting like you're the only person concerned about this. The police have been briefed, they know what they have to do as soon as they're given the orders.",
        "Dusty: How long is it gonna take?",
        "Bonnie: I can't give you a number.",
        "Dusty: That's not good enough.",
        "Bonnie: You know what? That's the best answer I can give you right now. You know what? Let me ask you a question, Dusty -- do you care about Meg?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, of course I do.",
        "Bonnie: Then start acting like it.",
        "Dusty: What's that mean?",
        "Bonnie: You're distracting! There is a child out there whose welfare is at stake, who's been taken by an extremely unstable father.",
        "Dusty: You're telling me? What are they doing? Who-who's letting this happen?!",
        "Bonnie: You want my opinion?",
        "Dusty: Yes, I do.",
        "Bonnie: Well, you and Meg have made some pretty poor choices over the past few months.",
        "Dusty: I see, right, it's our fault, yeah.",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, well, all I'm saying is that you both knew that Paul was a loose cannon, and you kept egging him on.",
        "Dusty: Paul shouldn't have custody in the first place.",
        "Bonnie: And we're doing everything we can to rectify that.",
        "Dusty: Well, do it faster or he's gonna get away. Damian already stopped him once.",
        "Bonnie: Damian saw him?",
        "Dusty: That's right. Paul tried to charter a plane, Damian kept it from happening.",
        "Bonnie: Wait, from the airfield on Route 31?",
        "Dusty: Yes, he also saw Paul's abandoned car on the side of the road nearby. You don't know this?",

        "Dusty: Start?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah -- now all of you need to stay out of this. And I meant what said, Dusty. If you go hunting for Paul yourself, you are only going to make this worse for Eliza and for Meg, so back off.",

        "Meg: Well, he could be anywhere. He could've gotten on the bus, he could have hitched a ride into town, he could go back to the airfield. He could be anywhere!",
        "Damian: Meg, you can't think like that.",
        "Meg: Why not? He has my daughter! I have a right to think that way.",
        "Damian: What are you doing?",
        "Meg: I have, uh, his car key. I have his car key! You know, maybe -- maybe there's a clue inside that'll tell us where he is.",
        "Damian: Okay. His decision to ditch the car may have been last-minute. You may not find anything.",

        "Brad: When she came by, what?",
        "Katie: I mean, I know that she's not responsible for what that pig of a lawyer did to us. In my head, I know that.",
        "Brad: Look, I know you do. We both knew that.",
        "Katie: But when she came by -- all I could think was, \"She's pregnant.\"",
        "Brad: She was.",
        "Katie: No, you don't understand. All I could see is Vienna carrying this child. And, God help me, I hated her, I -- I just, I hated her for being able to be pregnant when I couldn't. And for a second there, I did, I wished she wasn't. I wished she wasn't. Oh.",
        "Brad: Listen to me, listen to me -- listen to me, I don't care what you were thinking, or how long you thought it -- you did not make this happen.",
        "Katie: I just couldn't look at her anymore.",
        "Brad: Well, who could blame you? You have been through hell, trying to have a baby of your own. You're not made of steel I mean, you got your breaking point, this was it.",
        "Katie: No, it wasn't, it wasn't, I was jealous. I was jealous that they were happy and they have the one thing that I wanted. And Henry was right, if I could have just found a little compassion, I just would have apologized to her, and let her apologize to me, I would not have walked away, she would not have fallen, and she --",

        "Henry: Get some sleep. I'll be here when you wake up.",
        "Henry: I'm going for honest, here. The most honest thing that I can tell you, little buddy or buddina, is that, from the moment I found out that you were mine, something started to change, and-- life without you, whoever you are -- I thought I knew what love was. But I didn't know how to love with my whole heart until you and your mom taught me how. It's so much more than I could've imagined.",
