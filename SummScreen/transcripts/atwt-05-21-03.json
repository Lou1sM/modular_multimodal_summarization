        "Margo: How'd it go in court?",
        "Hal: Henry, Rose and Emily were all charged with kidnapping.",
        "Margo: Well, I thought Craig was going to get Barbara to drop all \r\ncharges.",
        "Hal: That's why I've stopped listening to Craig.",
        "Margo: So everyone makes bail?",
        "Hal: Almost.",
        "Henry: Just because I didn't make bail, doesn't mean you can leave me \r\nhere to rot. We were in this \r\ntogether. So let's help me \r\nout here, all right?",
        "Emily: Excuse me. If we were in this together, how come you ratted us \r\nout to Barbara?",
        "Henry: She made a very generous offer. Kidnapping does not pay like it \r\nused to. Okay?",
        "Cop: Okay, say good-bye to the nice ladies.",
        "Henry: Just one more quick question here. How soon do you think you can \r\nget the money?",
        "Rose: I gotta consult my financial adviser. But first I gotta hire one, \r\nwhich is never gonna happen. \r\nSo good-bye.",
        "Henry: Wait. Maybe I'm not making myself clear here. I will not last a \r\nweek in that jail.",
        "Cop: Now!",
        "Henry: Look, they have one bar of soap for every 12 men in there.",
        "Rose: I gotta go. I gotta go home.",
        "Emily: Take a hot bath, huh?",
        "Rose: Take a hot bath. And then I gotta do a few things that I don't \r\nwant to do.",
        "Emily: Like what? What do you mean?",
        "Rose: I'm gonna have breakfast with Lily. And I'm sure she's gonna be \r\nall over me about this whole \r\nkidnapping Barbara thing. \r\nAnd then -- I don't want to \r\ntalk about it.",

        "Margo: Any idea on how you plan to beat this?",
        "Craig: Well, after Barbara drops the charges, the D.A. will have no \r\nchoice but to drop the case.",
        "Margo: Now, remind me. Barbara is dropping these charges why?",
        "Craig: 'Cause my lawyer's a very persuasive man. He'll present her with \r\nsome attractive options. \r\nShe'll back off.",
        "Margo: And that lawyer's Marshall Travers?",
        "Craig: I needed a shark.",
        "Margo: He's a rapist.",
        "Craig: He knows Barbara. He's the best man for the job. Hey, I don't \r\nlike him any more than you \r\ndo.",
        "Margo: You're free to go, Craig. Make it quick.",
        "Craig: Quick is the order of the day. I need to find Rosanna, get my \r\nwife back.",
        "",
        "Barbara: What are you doing? Soliciting clients door to door?",
        "Marshall: I wanted to thank you for your tip last night. I talked with \r\nCraig Montgomery, and he \r\nhired me to represent him.",
        "Barbara: Oh, you're here to make a deal?",
        "Marshall: Obviously, we can dispense with the formalities. Craig wants \r\nyou to drop the charges \r\nagainst him and his \r\nco-defendants. In exchange, \r\nhe's offering a sizable \r\nfinancial settlement.",
        "Barbara: I was held hostage for days by Craig and his merry band of \r\nkidnappers. Money can't make \r\nup for that. I will not rest \r\nuntil they're all in jail.",
        "Marshall: Prosecute my client, and I'll get him off. Make a deal with \r\nhim, and you may get what \r\nyou want.",
        "Barbara: How do you know what I want?",
        "Marshall: I know you, Barbara. This isn't about justice. It's about \r\nrevenge.",
        "Barbara: Okay. Okay. I'll listen. But know this -- if we make a deal, \r\nit will be on my terms.",

        "Dusty: It's rush hour. You know, she and your boy probably got stuck in \r\ntraffic.",
        "Spangler: Maybe. And maybe she changed her mind about coming to your \r\nrescue.",
        "Dusty: What's your boy's name again? McCann?",
        "Spangler: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: How long's he been working for you?",
        "Spangler: Why?",
        "Dusty: 'Cause she's carrying a briefcase full of money. Hypothetically, \r\nhe could overpower her and \r\ntake it.",
        "Spangler: So you think he double-crossed me?",
        "Dusty: Nah. You said that, I'm just talking.",
        "Spangler: Well, here's something else I'm saying, okay? And you'd \r\nbetter listen good. Okay? If \r\nmy phone doesn't ring soon \r\n-- then I'm gonna figure \r\nit's you pulling the \r\ndouble-cross. And then I \r\nwill hurt you, Dusty. I will \r\nhurt you until you die.",

        "Molly: I'm sorry I'm late. My banker's not used to me withdrawing so \r\nmuch cash at one time.",

        "Mike: What's going on? Who is this guy?",
        "Molly: You heard the man, Mike. Mr. -- Stu and I just met, but we \r\nreally hit it off.",
        "McCann: You got a problem with that? I'll be right back, honey. Be sure \r\nto holler if this guy gives \r\nyou trouble.",
        "Molly: Stuie, I -- don't you think you need to stay here? Because we \r\nhave to get to our \r\nappointment on time. \r\nRemember?",
        "McCann: Isn't that the cutest thing? The way she can't stand having me \r\nout of her sight?",
        "Mike: Whoa, whoa. What are you doing with that guy?",
        "Molly: Don't you remember? We decided that I could take care of myself.",
        "Mike: Right. Well, from what I'm seeing, I'm not real sure about that.",
        "McCann: I'm all set. Did you miss me, baby?",
        "Molly: You know I did. Mike, it's really good to see you. Bye.",
        "McCann: That guy's still watching. I think you better kiss me.",

        "Lily: Right, right. I'm just glad you're all right, Rose. I'm sorry you \r\nhad to spend the night in \r\njail.",
        "Rose: You're not gonna tear into me for kidnapping Barbara? That's why \r\nI love you. That and posting \r\nmy bail.",
        "Lily: I'd say time, but it's not gonna happen again, is it, Rose? Well, \r\nlet's order.",
        "Rose: You know, actually, my -- my appetite's gone south. I've got a \r\nvery busy day. I've gotta \r\nget right there and -- I \r\ngotta do what I gotta do.",

        "Rose: I don't get it.",
        "Lily: Dusty asked me to buy him out of his part of the shop. And I \r\nagreed. So the shop is \r\nyours. These papers make it \r\nofficial.",

        "Spangler: Do you remember when we were first starting out together? \r\nHuh? You thought we were \r\nfriends? I never liked you. \r\nBut I thought you were going \r\nsomewhere, so I stuck \r\naround. The only place you \r\never went was down.
