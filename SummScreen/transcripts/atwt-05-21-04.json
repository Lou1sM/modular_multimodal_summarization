        "Margo: Jessica, I do not have a thing for Doc Reese. I mean, he's -- he's -- he's funny, he's fun. He makes me laugh. There's nothing more to it than that. Why? Why are you so suspicious?",
        "Jessica: As I recall, it was not his sense of humor that got your attention when you first laid eyes on him.",
        "Margo: Well, yeah, he's cute. And I noticed that. But do you really think that I would do something so stupid?",
        "Jessica: Tell me you haven't thought about it. Tell me that you have not fantasized about sleeping with Doc Reese.",
        "Doc: All right, a toast -- to Detective Margo Hughes, my one-woman S.W.A.T. team.",
        "Margo: And to Doc Reese, who always seems to need one -- a S.W.A.T. team, that is.",
        "Jessica: Okay. I won't be having any, thank you. I have to meet Ben. Sorry I was late for the meeting, but you will get my bill.",
        "Doc: Come on, that wasn't on the house?",
        "Jessica: I'm not a bartender. And this wasn't happy hour. Margo, take care.",
        "Margo: I will.",
        "Doc: What did I do now?",
        "Margo: Jessica thinks that I like you more than I should.",
        "Doc: And what do you think?",
        "Margo: Not a chance.",

        "Aaron: I got your message. What's up?",
        "Alison: I'm in trouble, Aaron.",
        "Aaron: Alison, I already told you. We have that plate thing under control. Look, I'm gonna call the lady that made the last one, and she'll make a new one so you can give it to Chris's parents. Can you relax?",
        "Alison: It's not that. Aaron, Chris has the night off so he made a reservation at Metro tonight -- for us. Only I'm supposed to be working tonight.",
        "Aaron: Oh, no.",
        "Alison: So what am I gonna do?",
        "Aaron: I -- I don't -- where's Chris right now?",
        "Alison: He's inside getting dressed.",
        "Aaron: Okay, we have some time.",
        "Alison: So, what? Just so I pack my bags and take the first bus out of here?",
        "Aaron: No, no. Time to make a plan. Okay, I just came up with something.",

        "Jennifer: How did you know?",
        "Barbara: I can smell your shampoo a mile away.",
        "Jennifer: Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.",
        "Barbara: Its okay, I've slept long enough. So, how are you feeling? Better?",
        "Jennifer: Aren't I supposed to ask you that?",
        "Barbara: Perhaps. But I have been asked that question so many times since I've been in this hospital, I'm tired of answering it. So why don't you? I know how hurt you were when you found out that Jordan had married Rosanna.",
        "Jennifer: I'm fine, Mom. Really. And besides, there's -- there's nothing that you can do about it. So, Jordan and I just need to deal with it ourselves.",
        "Barbara: I see. So, have you seen him lately? Run into him?",
        "Jennifer: Actually, just a few minutes ago.",
        "Barbara: How'd it go?",

        "Jordan: Is Rosanna here?",
        "Carly: Oh, no -- hi. No. She had to go out.",
        "Jordan: Do you know where she went? I need to talk to her.",
        "Carly: She had an appointment. That's all I can tell you. You might want to try to sleep through this, Cabot. I have a feeling it's not going to be fun.",
        "Jordan: And I have a feeling that you know where your sister went. So why don't you tell me.",
        "Carly: She just -- had to see somebody. That's all. Somebody that she thinks might have something to do with all of this confusion about Cabot.",
        "Jordan: Oh, well, I wish she had told me. I should probably be there, too. Don't you think?",
        "Carly: What? No, no -- Rosanna's taking care of it. Why are you so wound up?",
        "Jordan: Something is finally beginning to thaw between Jennifer and me, thank God. But there is a limit to how much progress I can make if I am still married to Rosanna.",
        "Carly: Okay, I understand that you want to make progress with Jennifer. But you can't just pretend that your marriage doesn't exist.",
        "Jordan: Rosanna and I were supposed to get divorced as soon as she got Cabot back. Now, suddenly, I am expected to stay married to her for two years and I am Cabot's legal parent. It's -- I didn't sign on for that, Carly. It's -- it's just too much to ask.",
        "Carly: Rosanna's not exactly happy about it, either.",
        "Jordan: Well, then, whoever she is talking to, I hope that they can get us the hell out of this. Because I gave her two weeks. I am not waiting a minute longer.",

        "Prison guard: Mr. Stenbeck will see you now.",
        "Paul: Don't let him get to you.",
        "Rosanna: Your father should be worried about me getting to him.",
        "Paul: That is just not the way you want to go into this.",
        "Rosanna: Well, we had an agreement and he changed it. That makes me angry. And James Stenbeck is going to hear about it.",
        "James: A little something for the new mother?",
        "Paul: Don't expect a thank-you card.",
        "James: Feisty today, are we, son? Feisty, but as usual, your show of spirit is misdirected.",
        "Rosanna: Mr. Stenbeck, my name is Rosanna Cabot.",
        "James: You can forgo the etiquette. I know who you are, Mrs. Sinclair, and why you're here.",
        "Rosanna: And will you help me?",
        "James: In ways you can't possibly imagine.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: So that's your idea? To tell Chris that I've been working at Metro?",
        "Aaron: Look, Alison, you're gonna be busted anyway. At least this way, you came clean.",
        "Alison: Well, I can't do that. I can't tell Chris that I've been lying to him.",
        "Aaron: You are out of options, honey. If you love him --",
        "Alison: Of course I love Chris. My whole life is Chris!",
        "Aaron: Then make that life an honest one. All right? Because if you don't --",
        "Alison: Then we could wind up like you and Lucy.",
        "Aaron: If I -- if I never lied to Lucy, we would still be together -- to this day.",
        "Alison: Yes, and I know that I'm taking a chance. But Chris is so proud of me. And so is his parents. And I can't just pull the rug from underneath everybody all at once. I have to ease my way out of it.",
        "Chris: Alison. You out here?",
        "Aaron: Look, I'm outta here.",

        "[Alison sighs]",
        "Chris: Hey -- what you were doing out here?",
        "Alison: I was just gonna clean up. I can't be creative in a messy workplace.",
        "Chris: Alison, stop. Okay, I know that you want to fix that plate for my parents' anniversary. But tonight is about you and me, spending time together having fun. So forget about it for one night, okay? You'll be brilliant tomorrow.",
        "Alison: Maybe I won't.",
        "Chris: Hey, what's going on?",
        "Alison: Do you remember when you said that you didn't want me working at Metro?",
        "Chris: Are you still thinking about that job?",
        "Alison: Well, yeah.",
        "Chris: Why, Alison? I mean, you've already moved on to other things.",
        "Alison: Just because --",
        "Chris: Listen, Alison, I know that you gave up working at Metro for me. Okay? But maybe I didn't say it enough at the time, but it made me realize that falling in love with you is the best thing that ever happened to me. Okay? I am more happy now than I ever have been in my entire life, and I want to enjoy every minute with you.",
        "Alison: Okay, so can we just bag Metro and spend the night in bed together?",
        "Chris: If we leave now, there will be plenty of time for that when we get back.",

        "Doc: You and Jessica been friends a long time?",
        "Margo: Yeah, why?",
        "Doc: She knows you pretty well. Maybe she sees something you don't see.",
        "Margo: And maybe -- just maybe -- she just doesn't see why I like you so much -- where she still obviously doesn't like you so much.",
        "Doc: Okay -- you go right ahead.",
        "Margo: What? Go right ahead and what?",
        "Doc: Fool yourself, fool Jessica -- but you're not gonna fool me. Because I'm not buying it.",
        "Margo: Just what are you trying to get me to admit here, Doc?",
        "Doc: I just want you to admit that we're friends. That we enjoy each other's company. And maybe -- just maybe -- there might be a hint of something else going on there, too.",
        "Margo: You just don't know when to give up, do you?",
        "Doc: No. Don't know when. Don't know how.",
        "Margo: Guess what? I love my family very much, and I wouldn't do anything to hurt them.",
        "Doc: Good. That's what I want to hear.",
        "Margo: What?",
        "Doc: Because when we do stop dancing around and get down to business, you'll be real careful not to get caught.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Rosanna doesn't like this any more than you do. She's working on it. You just have to be patient.",
        "Jordan: Two years patient? I -- I don't think so.",
        "Carly: Well, how about two hours then? Maybe she and Paul can convince whoever it is --",
        "Jordan: Paul? Paul? What does he have to do with this?",
        "Carly: Oh -- nothing.",
        "Jordan: No, no --",
        "Carly: Never mind.",
        "Jordan: Damn it, Carly, I have a right to know.",
        "Carly: Rosanna asked Paul to go along with her. It seems that he has a connection to this person.",
        "Jordan: A connection? What does that mean? Is he in on this?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Jordan: Tell me what is going on. Where is Rosanna, and why did Paul have to go with her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: We had a deal. I kept my end of the bargain. I expect you to keep yours. I want you to do that, Mr. Stenbeck, for me, now. Without delay.",
        "James: Mm-hmm. Has your child been returned to you?",
        "Rosanna: Yes, he has.",
        "James: But -- well, then, I do expect a thank you. \"Thank you, Mr. S.\" I may be incarcerated, but I still have feelings.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you, Mr. Stenbeck. Thank you very much, for returning my child to me. But our agreement was that I have sole custody of Cabot. And, instead, you are expecting me to share parental rights with Jordan Sinclair.",
        "James: It never -- it never ceases to amaze me. How people hear only what they want to hear.",
        "Rosanna: What are you talking about?",
        "James: Your stipulation was that Craig Montgomery no longer have any claim on Cabot. You never mentioned anyone else.",
        "Rosanna: That's because no one else was involved. Until you put Jordan's name on the adoption papers.",
        "James: Which I did for your own good.",
        "Paul: How do you figure that?",
        "James: Being a single parent can be a trying experience. But with young Jordan by your side, that road will be traveled easier.",
        "Rosanna: Mr. Stenbeck, I am a woman who can't have children. Cabot came into my life, I felt like he came from my own body. And I lost him and you brought him back to me, and forever I will be grateful to you. But what I need now is to build a life -- with no complications, with no axes waiting to fall. And you have the power to give me that, and so I'm asking you, sir, please -- I'm begging you -- take Jordan's name off the adoption papers, please? Let my baby and I go in peace.",

        "Aaron: Alison, hey, how ya been? Haven't seen you in here for ages.",
        "Alison: I'm just kind of busy.",
        "Aaron: Oh.",
        "Chris: You got a table for us, Aaron? I called ahead for a reservation.",
        "Aaron: Oh, yeah. I got a great table right down here.",
        "Tom: Oh, what are they doing? Offering a special tonight for people named Hughes?",
        "Chris: Alison and I finally got a night off. Do you want to join us for a drink?",
        "Tom: I'm sure you guys would rather be alone. Margo will be here any minute.",
        "Chris: Well, good. Then we won't have to put up with you for too long. Problem with you?",
        "Alison: No, no. It's no problem.",
        "Aaron: So let me show you to --",
        "Waiter: Alison, you look hot! Do we have a new dress code?",
        "Waitress: Hey, girl, you early or am I late?",
        "Tom: Friends of yours, I assume?",
        "Aaron: The last time Alison was here -- you know that whole incident in the ladies' bathroom. And with -- what's her name, that girl that works at the hospital --",
        "Chris: Tish.",
        "Aaron: Tish, right. And, you know, whenever you dunk somebody's head in the toilet -- of course people always talk about it. You know, they're still yapping about it here. You know?",
        "Alison: Would you guys just excuse me, please?",
        "Chris: Alison --",
        "Aaron: You know, Margo's right over there if --",
        "Tom: Oh, thanks.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Does this approach actually work? I mean, with anyone over the age of 18?",
        "Doc: You win some, you lose some. But Doc is always in the game.",
        "Tom: Hey, you didn't forget about our dinner, did you?",
        "Alison: Um -- Molly?",
        "Molly: Hey, Alison. Why aren't you dressed for work?",
        "Alison: Well, I kind of need the night off.",
        "Molly: You're asking me this now? Are you sick? Well, then, the answer's no.",
        "Alison: But I'm on a date with Chris. And we hardly ever get to see each other, and he wanted to take us out tonight.",
        "Molly: You didn't tell him you had to work, Alison?",
        "Alison: Well, he doesn't know that I work here. But I'm gonna tell him. I'm planning on telling him soon. So if you just let tonight slide, then I just can make sure that I do it right. And you know what else would be great, is if you didn't mention any of this to Chris.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Now, I don't mean to pry. And you can tell me that this is none of my business. But I don't quite understand how you're making progress with him when you just socked the guy in the jaw?",
        "Jennifer: Well, I realize I was going to have to face him every day at work. So I just took all my anger, put it in my fist and got rid of it.",
        "Barbara: Honey, you had a right to be angry.",
        "Jennifer: Maybe I did. But I just -- I don't want to be, Mom.",
        "Barbara: Why? Are you holding out some kind of hope that he's gonna come back to you?",
        "Jennifer: No, I don't believe that. Okay, maybe I do.",
        "Barbara: Oh, honey --",
        "Jennifer: And maybe it's stupid. Maybe I'm just asking to get hurt. But giving up on him doesn't seem right, either. So I'm not gonna do that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: What are you doing?",
        "Jordan: What does it look like I'm doing? There's gotta be an address here, phone number --",
        "Carly: Oh, come on. Stop it! These are Rosanna's private things.",
        "Jordan: She's my wife, remember? Rich or poor, sickness and health?",
        "Carly: Hey, would you calm down? You're not getting yourself anywhere.",
        "Jordan: I am a father to a child who I don't know. I am married to a woman who does not love me. I can't do anything about it, and I can't get answers about what happened. How calm would you be?",
        "Carly: Okay, look, I'll -- I'll tell you. But you have to promise me that you're not gonna breathe a word of it to anybody.",
        "Jordan: Who is Rosanna seeing?",
        "Carly: A man named James Stenbeck.",
        "Jordan: I know that name. That's Paul's father.",
        "Carly: Yes, right. That's him. Rosanna thinks that he might have arranged for you to be her husband and to be the father of Cabot.",
        "Jordan: Why? What does it have to do with him?",
        "Carly: That's what Rosanna's trying to find out.",
        "Jordan: Stenbeck -- isn't he -- he's a psycho, right? I mean, I've read about him -- he's -- he's been in and out of jail. He devises schemes that destroy people's lives.",
        "Carly: That's the one.",
        "Jordan: So this is even worse than I thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "James: Your husband's a lucky man. You're intelligent, beautiful, very rich -- and you have depth.",
        "Paul: Give her an answer. Are you gonna take Jordan's name off Cabot's adoption papers or not?",
        "James: After all the trouble I went through to get his name on the papers? I'd have to be out of my mind.",
        "Rosanna: Why? Why? Why does Jordan have to be Cabot's father?",
        "James: I'm an old-fashioned man. I believe a child needs two parents.",
        "Rosanna: But why Jordan?",
        "James: The genes. Chromosomes. DNA. Don't you get it that Jordan's Cabot's father? Hey, hey, don't blame me -- blame biology.",
        "Paul: Do you expect us to believe that Jordan is Cabot's real father?",
        "James: If you had learned anything from me, Paul, you would have already figured that out all on your own.",
        "Rosanna: How -- how is this possible?",
        "James: Well, you have a woman holding an egg. A man, a little swimmy thing -- I'm assuming you don't need a lesson on that, do you? I mean, from a purely scientific perspective, Jordan is more entitled to Cabot than you are.",
        "Rosanna: No -- no.",

        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Chris: Alison -- what are you doing?",
        "Alison: Well, Molly was short a waitress. So I told her I would help out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Knowing how much I loved Cabot, you manipulated me into marrying Jordan Sinclair, which is what you wanted all along.",
        "James: I'm impressed.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Molly: Alison, look, it's not personal. Okay? I would love to help you out. But I have a club to run here, and I need you to work tonight.",
        "Alison: What about the girl, Kaya? The one who works lunch? Can't you call her and see if she could come in?",
        "Molly: No, she's in Cincinnati visiting her parents. I am sorry, Alison, but it has to be you.",
        "Alison: What if I refuse?",
        "Molly: Then you're fired. Table six is ready to order, okay? And push the sea bass. We got 30 pounds of it in this morning.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Doc: Sorry I tied up your wife, Tom, but I was just thanking her for saving my skin.",
        "Tom: Really? How'd she do that?",
        "Margo: Oh, you don't -- you don't want to hear about it.",
        "Tom: Well, sure I do.",
        "Doc: I tell you what, you're gonna love this. I had a meeting today with my ex-wife and her lawyer -- since my lawyer was delayed a little bit, she sent Margo to hold my leash.",
        "Margo: I was just gonna fill in for Jess till she showed up.",
        "Doc: Well, all of a sudden, my ex starts spouting off at the mouth, hurling insults at me and Margo.",
        "Tom: She's insulting Margo? What about?",
        "Doc: Well, one thing you have to know about my ex-wife is, she doesn't really need a reason. That broad can go from zero to ugly in about ten seconds. So Margo, here, threatens to pop her one in the face.",
        "Margo: I wasn't going to. I just -- I just wanted to shut her up.",
        "Doc: And scared about six years off the woman's face-lift. Anyway, bottom line, I'm off the hook for a lot of money, and I owe it all to -- your magnificent wife.",
        "Tom: Well, I guess that explains the champagne.",
        "Doc: Hey, you gotta celebrate the victories, Tommy. Any good coach would tell you that.",
        "Tom: Well, you're right, Doc. It was -- it was a good story. Are you ready?",
        "Margo: I'll be right with you, okay?",
        "Tom: I'll be at the table right over there. Nice seeing you, Doc.",
        "Doc: You, too, Tom.",
        "Margo: Don't you ever do that to him again.",
        "Doc: What?",
        "Margo: Don't play innocent. It doesn't work with me. Here's the new game plan, Doc. From now on, there will be no more innuendoes, no more come-ons, no more smiles, winks, or whatever else you've got planned for me in that sports bag. You got that, Doc? Because this little game we've been doing -- it isn't fun anymore. We're going to put an end to it, right now.",

        "Ben: What's the matter?",
        "Jessica: Can we just find some place where we can be alone and just do what we need to do?",
        "Ben: Whoa, whoa -- let's not lose our sense of romance here, okay? We want to have a baby. I understand, but we have to stay on schedule. But there are worse things.",
        "Jessica: Yeah, there are worse things. Like, what if nothing happens? What if we've already waited too long?",
        "Ben: Is that what's bothering you? You're worried this isn't gonna work?",
        "Jessica: Sweetheart, I know we just started trying. But the longer it takes, the worse our chances are gonna be.",
        "Ben: Right, right. And if you get all tense over this, it's only gonna make it harder for you to get pregnant. So, come on, take a deep breath, relax -- okay? Maybe even try to enjoy this a little bit.",
        "Jessica: I can't. I can't. I can't relax. Honey, why didn't I meet you 15 years ago? Why didn't we get married before Marshall Travers came to this town? And I know -- I know there are no answers.",
        "Ben: So maybe we need to ask different questions. Do we need a baby? Or do we want one?",
        "Jessica: Want one. Desperately.",
        "Ben: Right. And having a baby with you is gonna be one of the highlights of my life. But we don't need a baby to make us happy. That we can do for each other.",
        "Jessica: I know, you're right. But I just -- I just feel like there's something more we could be doing.",
        "Ben: Yeah. Well, you know, I'm open to experimentation. Look, I'll give Dr. Schiller a call.",
        "Jessica: No. Dr. Schiller, I think, has taken us as far as she can. I want to start talking to an expert in fertility.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jordan: This is getting out of control now, Carly. If James Stenbeck is involved in Cabot's adoption, I have to know why.",
        "Carly: So does Rosanna. But maybe James isn't involved. And if that's the case, then he's not gonna be able to give her any answers, is he?",
        "Jordan: Well, then, maybe I'll just go ask him myself.",
        "Carly: That would be a mistake.",
        "Jordan: No. My mistake was getting involved in something that I thought was a good cause. But I don't have to let this go on indefinitely. I'm not gonna sit around for two years while my whole life --",
        "Carly: Nice. Good going. You woke him up. Oh, come here, sweetheart. No, no -- nobody is mad at you. Nobody's mad at all. We're happy, we're happy. Aren't we happy?",
        "Jordan: I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm just frustrated.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Carly: Oh, I've got to get that. It might be Jack. Here. Here, just hold him for me until I'm off the phone. [Phone rings] Hello? Oh, yes, hi. I thought it might be you. How are you, honey? No, I'm at Rosanna's. Sage is over at Emma's because Rosanna needed a baby-sitter fast. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe a couple more hours.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're lying! There's no way that Jordan is Cabot's real father.",
        "James: Now, why would I lie when all you have to do to prove me wrong is a simple DNA test? I'm telling the truth.",
        "Paul: I have a horrible feeling you might just be.",
        "James: And what's so horrible about finding the perfect home for Jordan's son? A loving mother with untold resources. His real father to take him to the park, to sporting events.",
        "Rosanna: I'm not gonna take your word on this. I want proof that Jordan is Cabot's father.",
        "James: That's your job.",
        "Rosanna: Look, even if it is true, why should you care about Jordan? Why should you care about Jordan's child?",
        "James: I promised Jordan's parents that I would look after him. And when I learned that he had been a bit careless, I felt it my duty to make things right.",
        "Rosanna: So you've been involved since the beginning?",
        "James: Your previous husband is an interesting, intelligent man. Driven. But when he wants something very badly, he -- well, his judgment suffers.",
        "Paul: It was you. You made sure that Craig found Cabot and then Craig bought -- brought Cabot to Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: And you gave me just enough time to love him and arrange for me to lose him.",
        "James: I would have, but my enterprising son here jumped in ahead of me. As usual, Paul, your timing, not good.",
        "Rosanna: And knowing how much I loved Cabot, you manipulated me into marrying Jordan Sinclair, which is what you wanted all along.",
        "James: I'm impressed.",
        "Paul: You're not gonna get away with it. Rosanna's lawyers have figured out a way to get out of this contract.",
        "James: As usual, Paul, you're one step behind. Now you can appreciate my frustration with him.",
        "Paul: What's he talking about?",
        "Rosanna: If the contract is canceled, Cabot has to go back to the adoption agency.",
        "Paul: No. No, there's gotta be something we can do.",
        "James: The best thing you can do, Mrs. Sinclair, is to hurry home and tell Jordan the happy news. That's your only option. I suggest you make the most of it.",

        "Aaron: Did -- did Ali ask you for the night off?",
        "Molly: Yes, and I told her she couldn't have it.",
        "Aaron: Is there any way I can change your mind?",
        "Molly: Too late.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: I'm so sorry that took so long. Just had to clear some things up with Doc.",
        "Tom: Yeah, looks like Doc Reese is electing himself the new president of your fan club.",
        "Margo: Well, you know, we hardly know each other. He's just very enthusiastic.",
        "Tom: Really? First time I ever felt like I was intruding on my own wife.",
        "Chris: Maybe you should have left the two of them alone.",
        "Margo: You know, you guys, just drop it. Really, someone's gotta to explain to me what women find so fascinating about Doc Reese, because I personally just don't get it.",
        "Alison: Okay. Two rum and cokes and some chips -- and now let me tell you about today's specials.",
        "Tom: Okay.",
        "Chris: Alison -- what are you doing?",
        "Alison: Well, Molly was short a waitress. So I told her I would help out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ben: I really think that we're way ahead of ourselves on this. Before you start taking any fertility pills, we need to give this some time.",
        "Jessica: And wait for my biological clock to wind down completely? I mean, I just think if I'm on the hormones, then we'll have all the bases covered.",
        "Ben: You don't just walk down to your corner drug store and pick up fertility pills. You have to go to a specialist and take tests. And then -- and then they put you on a certain kind of protocol.",
        "Jessica: I know. I've done the research.",
        "Ben: Oh, really? Since when?",
        "Jessica: Since Dr. Schiller told us we might have trouble getting pregnant.",
        "Ben: Oh, well, here I thought we were doing this together.",
        "Jessica: Come on, don't be upset. Sweetheart, I just -- I just -- I just want to get control of this situation.",
        "Ben: Look, there's no such thing as total control in this kind of a situation. We're talking about creating a life, Jessica. There's a certain amount of uncertainty that goes with that.",
        "Jessica: I know that. And I wish I could be more patient. I'm just getting tired of talking about this.",
        "Ben: Okay, then don't.",
        "Jessica: And there's something else.",
        "Ben: Okay, so what else is going on? Maybe I can make that right.",
        "Jessica: I'm almost starting to dread having sex.",

        "Carly: I love you, too, Jack. He wasn't gonna bite you, you know?",
        "Jordan: My name might be on those adoption papers, but I am a long way from wanting to be a parent. I don't want to get attached to him, Carly. Because I'm not gonna be in his life much longer.",
        "Rosanna: Hi. How'd he do without me?",
        "Carly: Oh, fine. He missed you, but we had a lot of fun. How'd it go?",
        "Paul: We're still trying to figure it all out.",
        "Jordan: Well, if you're waiting for me to leave, don't bother. 'Cause I'm very, very interested in what Paul's father had to say.",
        "Rosanna: You told him?",
        "Carly: I just said that you were trying to find out if jambs had anything to do with this.",
        "Rosanna: Well, we still don't have any answers. Mr. Stenbeck was very uncooperative. He didn't tell us anything at all about you and Cabot.",
        "Jordan: Oh, come on, Rosanna. Didn't Stenbeck say anything? I mean, didn't you ask him why he put my name on Cabot's adoption papers?",
        "Rosanna: I asked. He refused to give me an answer.",
        "Jordan: Oh, so I guess the whole trip was a complete waste?",
        "Paul: My father's not somebody you pressure into anything. If he doesn't feel like talking, there's not a whole lot you can do about it.",
        "Jordan: Oh, well, that's just great. If Stenbeck isn't gonna tell us anything, how -- how are we gonna fix this?",
        "Rosanna: At the moment, I have no idea.",
        "Jordan: Well, maybe this will help you figure it out. I gave you two weeks to take my name off the adoption papers and start working on our divorce. If you're not gonna do something about it, I will. Excuse me.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Okay. Maybe dread is too strong a word. It's just -- sweetheart, I love you, and I want this to be easier. I want it to be fun. I want it to bring us closer together. Instead, it's starting to feel like work.",
        "Ben: Yeah, I know. Look, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna start by bringing a little more peace into your life. You know, some soft music, candles in the bedroom, oils in the bath -- maybe even take some time off of work.",
        "Jessica: Oh, now, wait a minute, sweetheart. I can't --",
        "Ben: I'm not finished. Okay? Once we get you chilled out, then we are going to make this like a game, okay, where we make up some rules. And we're gonna keep it fun. And we are going to pour all of our love and get you pregnant, and we're not gonna stop until your belly's out to here and we're arguing about what our baby's name's gonna be. Now, any questions?",
        "Jessica: Just one -- I haven't scared you off from wanting a baby?",

        "Chris: But you and I are supposed to have dinner.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, I mean, sometimes, Chris, you have to be flexible.",
        "Chris: Why do I feel like there's more going on here than you're telling me?",
        "Molly: Alison, can I talk to you for a second? I promise she'll be right back.",

        "Molly: Right. Alison, that's actually what I would like to speak to you about. Thanks for the offer, but we're not gonna need you after all.",
        "Alison: Oh, well, any time. Thanks, thanks.",
        "Molly: Listen, you know, I think we should have a chat sometime. Just about everything that's happening. Okay?",
        "Alison: Okay, I'll call you.",
        "Molly: Enjoy your evening.",
        "Alison: Okay, so now you have me all to yourself.",

        "Alison: No, no, I didn't mean it -- mean that.",
        "Tom: No, no, it's not a problem, Alison. I think that Margo and I would prefer to be alone anyway. May I escort you to your table?",
        "Margo: Oh, it would be my pleasure.",
        "Alison: Wouldn't it be great to be like that?",
