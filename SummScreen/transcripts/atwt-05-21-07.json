        "Dusty: It's okay. She's asleep.",
        "Emily: Oh God, I'm sorry.",
        "Dusty: For what?",
        "Emily: Uh, drooling on your -- drooling on your shirt.",
        "Dusty: Oh, that's okay. I'm used to that. I guess your mom was right.",
        "Emily: About what?",
        "Dusty: She said we'd be spending the night together.",
        "Emily: Yeah, on a chair next to my detoxing sister.",
        "Dusty: And you slept like a baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I could not stop thinking about you last night.",
        "Katie: Are we still on for tonight?",
        "Jack: That's why I'm here.",
        "Katie: Please tell me you're not gonna cancel.",
        "Jack: No, not a chance. I just wanted to fly something by you. But that can wait. This can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Henry, thank God.",
        "Henry: What? Hey, hey, hey! I'm glad to see you too, but go easy there.",
        "Vienna: I need you desperately.",
        "Henry: Sweetheart, I know the feeling but I don't think the breakfast crowd will approve!",
        "Vienna: No, no! Henry, this is serious. I woke up this morning and there was something around my neck.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Yeah, I slept. I am -- I'm so grateful to you for staying with me last night. I could never have handled Alison all by myself. Really. I would have fallen asleep and she would've snuck past me and ended up on the street, strung out and lost. And if you say a word to my mother about spending the night together --",
        "Dusty: It might cheer her up.",
        "Emily: Yeah, see but -- I'm worried about what happens when we tell her we actually -- you know, broke up.",
        "Dusty: I guess we can't break up. I'm just playing by your rules, pal.",
        "Emily: Oh, see now pal I like. I can handle pal.",
        "Dusty: You can handle anything. And you know it. Except for sleeping in your eye make-up.",
        "Emily: I'm a mess aren't I?",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah, awful. Just awful.",
        "Emily: Alison? Honey? Honey, it's okay. Wake up.",
        "Alison: Where am I?",
        "Emily: You're in the Lakeview. Me and Dusty are here. It's okay? Look. Right here. What is it? What is it?",
        "Alison: I was on set. With Lance. And he wanted me to -- this guy. And I didn't want him, but he made me. He made me!",
        "Dusty: You don't have to do that again, Alison.",
        "Alison: He made me.",
        "Dusty: I know. But Lance is in Vegas. You're here and it's over. It's all over. Emily, can you get me some water. Glass of water and a wet towel. It's okay. It's okay. You had a bad dream and it's over now. It's all over.",
        "Emily: Here.",
        "Dusty: Look at me. Come on. Come on. Come on. You need water. Sit up. Come on sit up. Sit up. You've got to wash that junk out of your system. You know?",
        "Alison: I heard you.",
        "Emily: Alison just drink the water, please. Just drink the water.",
        "Alison: What do you want from me? You lock me in here and all I was doing was trying to have a little fun.",
        "Dusty: No! You're here because you sold yourself to a dealer to get high.",
        "Alison: Are you going to let him talk to me like that?",
        "Emily: Alison, he's trying to help you, okay? You nearly killed yourself on that window ledge yesterday.",
        "Alison: I was trying to get away from him!",
        "Dusty: Drink your water.",
        "Alison: I didn't ask you!",
        "Emily: Alison, listen to me. You were lucky Dusty was here. He saved your life. Now I'm not asking you to thank him right now, okay? But I am asking you to take a good look at yourself. Will you please? Look at yourself! This is no way to live your life! You are strung out and dependent. Listen to me, you are a beautiful, smart girl. You've got so much to live for when you're off the drugs! And we're gonna help you do that. But you have to let us help you, and if you don't -- if you don't, I'm telling Mom. And you're going away to a real rehab. So you tell me, what's it gonna be?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Henry --",
        "Henry: Yeah.",
        "Vienna: My neck.",
        "Henry: Your neck, yes, your neck. Wow. Look at that. Looks like a great copy of the crown jewels of Leonia.",
        "Vienna: No, it's not a copy.",
        "Henry: You're saying -- what are you saying?",
        "Vienna: I know my diamonds, Henry, and these are for real.",
        "Henry: Well, that's sensational, but that doesn't mean they're the crown jewels.",
        "Vienna: No, it's the same necklace.",
        "Henry: It can't be the same necklace. Simon had a fence break up the necklace and sell the stones.",
        "Vienna: All I know is that I went to bed last night not wearing anything and I woke up this morning -- viola.",
        "Henry: What? While you were asleep?",
        "Vienna: Yes. Someone must have broken into the room and put it on my neck.",
        "Henry: Now that's scary.",
        "Vienna: No, it's terrifying.",
        "Henry: Yes, it is. But on the bright side -- the bright side -- if those really are the crown jewels, then the prince can't prosecute you.",
        "Vienna: Unless he thinks that I stole them and I've been hiding them the whole time. And now he's going to throw me into jail.",
        "Henry: Oh, he's not going to throw you into jail.",
        "Vienna: But what am I going to do? I can't tell him that, \"Oh, this is what happened.\" He's not going to believe that.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is a bit of a stretch.",
        "Vienna: But you believe me, don't you?",
        "Henry: Well, remember I'm a poker player, so I can tell when someone is lying. And you're not lying. Wow. Which means that somehow someone broke into your suite and fastened the crown jewels of Leonia around your neck.",
        "Vienna: Oh Henry, I know that you don't love me but, right now, it feels like you do.",
        "Henry: Vienna, Vienna, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. Don't -- don't say a word. Let's just pretend I didn't say anything. See? I'm fine.",
        "Henry: What are you going to do?",
        "Vienna: Well, I don't know!",
        "Henry: Okay.",
        "Vienna: I don't know. I need your help. I can't do this alone.",
        "Henry: You know, I once spent two months on a deserted island looking for just one diamond.",
        "Vienna: Oh, well, you can have these. They're yours.",
        "Henry: No, no, no, no, no. I think those have caused enough trouble already. Although -- no. No, no, no, no. There's only one thing we can do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Yeah, you know, as much as I would like to stay right here -- the crew is starting to show up.",
        "Katie: It's okay. They won't care if we're happy. What?",
        "Jack: It's just a long time since I've made anybody happy.",
        "Katie: No, that is not true. You've been making me happy for weeks.",
        "Jack: Okay, listen, I've got to go, 'cause there's -- there's some stuff I got to do.",
        "[Jack clears his throat]",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Jack: Little tying up of loose ends of my own before we meet up tonight.",
        "Katie: Which is why you came by here?",
        "Jack: What am I thinking? Yeah, I made a -- I made a reservation at La Fortuna.",
        "Katie: In Chicago?",
        "Jack: If that's a problem, let me know.",
        "Katie: No, that is not a problem. That's great. I've always wanted to go there. Apparently, the food is unbelievable, and it's really classy and beautiful.",
        "Jack: Yeah. That's good. That's good, because, um, you see, um, it is in Chicago, which means it's a bit of a drive. And that's not the problem. It's just, it's gonna be late, and -- Emma's got the kids, so that's not an issue. I just thought we might want to stay overnight.",
        "Katie: I would love to stay overnight with you. And I really appreciate you making it so private and special.",
        "Jack: It is very special.",
        "Katie: I know. For me, too. Mmm. How am I gonna get through a whole day?",
        "Jack: I'm gonna go. I am. I'm gonna go.",
        "Katie: Okay -- no, wait.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Oh! Wait a minute. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Uh, Snyder?",
        "Henry: Coleman here. Before you hang up, this is a bona fide emergency. If I don't see you in the next half-hour, we're gonna have a full-blown, international incident.",
        "Jack: Okay, all right. Henry, I'll meet you at the station in 15 minutes, okay?",
        "Henry: Roger. Over and out.",
        "Jack: Right. I gotta go.",
        "Katie: Okay. I'll see you later.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Brad: Hey. You're in early.",
        "Katie: Not really. Uh, we have the drum corps from the high school coming by today for the buildup to Memorial Day. Did Kim talk to you about that?",
        "Brad: Yeah, sure. Um, countdown, hometown stuff.",
        "Katie: Yeah. I was a cheerleader in high school, so I was just wondering if I could do --",
        "Brad: You want to do the interview? No problem.",
        "Katie: Great. Thanks.",
        "Brad: And Katie --",
        "Katie: Hmm?",
        "Brad: Is there -- you know, is there anything else going on that you want to tell me about? Anything at all?",
        "Katie: No. No, not that I can think of.",
        "Brad: Well, I brought you this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I am so sorry, Officer. I must have drifted off.",
        "Bay City Cop: Yeah. Clerk tells me you were here when he opened up.",
        "Carly: Uh, because I have a bus to catch.",
        "Bay City Cop: I'm sorry, Lady, you're not going anywhere.",
        "Carly: Why not?",
        "Bay City Cop: I think you know why not. This town don't allow vagrants.",
        "Carly: Of course not. Of course you don't. Cause vagrants are a menace. And I for one truly appreciate your -- your vigilance. But the thing is with me, is that I -- I missed my bus last night. And then the ticket window closed, and I wasn't sure when the next bus was gonna be pulling through. And I was afraid to leave, you know, so I -- I guess I fell asleep. I'm sorry. I'll be out of your hair just as soon as the bus comes in.",
        "Bay City Cop: There's no bus, Lady. You know why?",
        "Carly: No, why?",
        "Bay City Cop: Because you didn't buy a ticket.",
        "Carly: No, I guess technically, I didn't buy a ticket. But --",
        "Bay City Cop: No buts. You've been lying to me. You know what we do to pretty ladies that lie to cops in this town?",
        "Carly: You buy 'em a cup of coffee?",
        "Bay City Cop: Sure, why not? We always have a pot in the station. Let's go. You're under arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I didn't mean to get addicted. I was just trying to have fun and partying. After Aaron dumped me, I needed a little fun in my life. Then I don't know what happened. I lost my job. I started using to, you know, feel better. And then I ran out of money, and I owed the dealer. And he had this way for me to pay him back. And that's when he turned me on to Lance. And then it was all candy, all the time. Then all of the sudden, I -- I just needed it, to do what I was doing, to not feel sick like I did last night.",
        "Dusty: Look, the worst is over physically. You've got to stay away from that stuff and never look back. You got to toughen up mentally. You get a craving, you gotta let the moment pass. You do your job, you go home and you rest. You make your meetings. That's it. That's your regimen for the next couple of weeks.",
        "Alison: Weeks?",
        "Emily: Whatever it takes, Alison.",
        "Dusty: No more partying and no contact with people who party. You understand? Say it.",
        "Alison: I understand. Is he always like this?",
        "Emily: Yeah, he is.",
        "Alison: I'm really sick.",
        "Dusty: Drink.",
        "Alison: No, I'm serious. I'm sick. Oh.",
        "Emily: You probably don't have anything left in your stomach, Sweetheart.",
        "Dusty: Today's the last rough day. The shower's gonna help.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Alison: A hot one? By myself this time?",
        "Dusty: How you doing?",
        "Emily: Better. Think she's gonna make it?",
        "Dusty: I don't know.",
        "Emily: Oh, God.",
        "Dusty: She's got a good shot. She's got you.",
        "Emily: I just don't want to lose her.",
        "Dusty: You're not gonna.",
        "Emily: She's just so stubborn.",
        "Dusty: That can be good, you know? She's gonna put it behind getting sober. And you're good with her, you know? Tough. She needs that.",
        "Emily: Well, believe it or not, I'm actually a pretty good mother. Not that Alison's my daughter. I mean, she could've -- she could've been. You know the story, right?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. The egg came from you, but your mother carried the baby. I know. Is that right?",
        "Emily: Yeah. You know all my secrets, don't you?",
        "Dusty: I guess you trust me.",
        "Emily: You've seen me at my worst.",
        "Dusty: And your best.",
        "Emily: You know, when Jenny died, my Jenny, I went back looking through all my old photo albums, cause I just wanted to look at Alison when she was little, just remember what she was like. Cause she's my -- she's my sister, you know, but she'll probably be the only daughter I'll ever have really.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Swedish fish?",
        "Brad: They're your favorite, right?",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Brad: Well, I would have got you jawbreakers -- which are my favorite, by the way -- but I was thinking of you, and I want to apologize.",
        "Katie: For lying to me and your brother?",
        "Brad: You just don't let a guy off, do you?",
        "Katie: Keep the fish.",
        "Brad: Katie, Katie, I am sorry, okay? I am truly, honestly, totally, completely sorry, okay? Just -- will you just hear me out? Just hear me out.",
        "Katie: Why should I?",
        "Brad: Only cause I bought you the gummy fish, okay? We're friends -- or we were. And that's what I'm sorry about, okay, is that I blew it. I mean, we were having -- we were having some good times. All right, remember the inn -- it was fun, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah, yeah, it was fun. But then --",
        "Brad: Okay, and working together. I mean, I know we're still doing that, but it's different now. You go stalking off to your dressing room I go to mine. And you know, it's weird, you know? I want to get past this. May I stand up now?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brad: Listen, for a while there, we were listening to each other. I was there for you, you were there for me. I really liked it. I miss that, and I think that you miss that, too. All I'm just -- I'm just saying -- I'm just saying, can we be friends?",
        "Katie: Sorry.",
        "Brad: Why not?",
        "Katie: Because you lied to me and to Jack, and I'm never gonna believe another word that comes out of your mouth.",
        "Brad: So how am I gonna get through to you if you don't trust me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: She came to me right away, Jack, as soon as she woke up.",
        "Vienna: I swear, I had nothing to do with this. I just woke up, and there they were.",
        "Henry: She hasn't seen them since they were stolen.",
        "Vienna: I had nothing to do with stealing them. I was a pansy.",
        "Henry: Patsy. You were a patsy.",
        "Jack: Vienna, I don't think you stole these jewels.",
        "Vienna: Oh, thank God. We were so afraid that you wouldn't believe us.",
        "[Henry laughs]",
        "Henry: You were afraid? I knew we could trust Jack. We can trust you Jack, right?",
        "Jack: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Henry. Odds are, this is someone's idea of a practical joke.",
        "Henry: Really? It's a pretty expensive joke.",
        "Jack: If the stones are real.",
        "Henry: Look, she says they were real, they're real. You can trust her.",
        "Jack: I guess there's one way to find out. Dallas? Yeah, could you take these into the lab for analysis? Also, the specs are on file. Also, get a hold of the Leonian embassy. Tell them we might have something here of interest. No promises, but as soon as we can authenticate, we will be in touch, okay? Make sure the lab doesn't lose sight of those diamonds. Thank you. Um, as far as your involvement, you've cooperated. I believe your story. So, no worries.",
        "Henry: Jack -- uh, Jack?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Henry: Uh, I know this may be a sore subject, but have you given any thought to who may be responsible for this?",
        "Jack: We know that Simon Frasier stole those jewels, with help from Carly. They're both wanted for grand larceny.",
        "Henry: Right, right. Exactly. But someone broke into her room while she was sleeping. And she's a very light sleeper.",
        "Vienna: Unless I've had a little bit too much champagne. But I swear, I haven't had a drop.",
        "Henry: So the point is that there's only one person I know who could get hold of the jewels, break into her room, put them around her neck.",
        "Vienna: Simon Frasier. And if Simon is back --",
        "Jack: -- So is Carly.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: You think that I'm a vagrant?",
        "Bay City Cop: Lady, you were sleeping on a bench.",
        "Carly: Yeah, because I missed the bus!",
        "Bay City Cop: Let's go.",
        "Carly: No! Please -- please, you don't understand. You can't arrest me. Please don't arrest me!",
        "Bay City Cop: I'll bite. Why not?",
        "Carly: Because I'll never see my children again! Please, please, don't!",
        "Bay City Cop: Okay, that's enough. [Carly sobs] Pull yourself together.",
        "Carly: Thank you. You're right. You're absolutely right. I didn't buy a ticket. But it's only because I got here so late, and the ticket window was closed, and I didn't have any place else to go.",
        "Bay City Cop: Once you're booked, I'll give social services a call.",
        "Carly: Oh, please. No, please. Please, you don't understand. I will lose my children. You cannot arrest me. My husband -- my ex-husband, he already won't let me see them. He's violating the custody agreement already, and there's nothing I can do about it until I get back to Chicago.",
        "Bay City Cop: You live in Chicago?",
        "Carly: Well, outside. I can't actually afford the city. All I wanted was to spend a little time with my children. I even called my husband, and he said that he would bring them to the motel. And I waited there, but they didn't show up. So I went to the house, and he had -- he packed them up, and he sent them off to his parents in Minneapolis. He slammed the door in my face, and he's never gonna let me see them! [Carly sobs] I came here because I couldn't afford another night at the motel. I thought I could catch a bus, you know, but it was late, and I couldn't get a ticket.",
        "Bay City Cop: What time is this bus?",
        "Carly: It should be here within an hour.",
        "Bay City Cop: And you'll be on it?",
        "Carly: If you'd let me go.",
        "Bay City Cop: I'll let you go this one time.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Bay City Cop: With a warning. You get yourself a job, hire yourself a lawyer and get your kids back, all right? They need their mother.",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yes, I think you're right about that, Officer.",
        "Bay City Cop: All right then.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Bay City Cop: No, you keep that.",
        "[Carly sighs]",
        "Carly: Now what?",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Employee: Can I help you?",
        "Carly: Yeah. When's the bus to Oakdale?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: It's a little early to speculate, Vienna, but you're in the clear. If the jewels are real, I'm sure the prince will drop his case. As far as Simon and Carly are concerned, they're fugitives, Henry. Why would they come back and risk that? It doesn't make any sense. Do you have anything from the lab yet?",
        "Dallas: I just dropped them off.",
        "Jack: Okay, then tell them to put a rush on it and put a fresh APB out on Simon Frasier and Carly Snyder.",
        "Dallas: Okay.",
        "[Phone rings]",
        "Jack: Excuse me. Snyder?",
        "Rachel: Detective, this is Rachel Cohen. I thought we had an appointment.",
        "Jack: We do. I'm sorry. I'll be right there. I gotta go.",
        "Vienna: But -- but what about the diamonds?",
        "Jack: We can't do anything unless we hear from the lab.",
        "Vienna: But when will we know?",
        "Jack: I don't know that, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: But there has to be something we can do.",
        "Jack: There's nothing I can do, okay? I'm sorry, I am. It's just, until we hear back from the lab, or we get lucky enough to grab Simon and Carly and bring them in here, my hands are tied. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go see a realtor about selling my house.",
        "Vienna: He's upset.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. It's not easy putting out an APB on the mother of your children.",
        "Vienna: Yes. It's not easy when you love someone, and they don't love you back. You should go.",
        "Henry: Where?",
        "Vienna: Well, someone needs to tell Katie that Simon might be back in town. And who better than their best friend?",
        "Henry: That's -- that's very -- that's very thoughtful of you.",
        "Vienna: Well, I've become very fond of Katie. You know that.",
        "Henry: Yes. I -- I didn't think of it.",
        "Vienna: Well, you would. You've just been too busy protecting me. I'm fine. You heard Jack. If those diamonds are real, I'm free home.",

        "Katie: Don't even bother. I don't have anything to say to you.",
        "Brad: I have something to say to you. I've been thinking about what you said, about not being able to trust me, and you're right, you've got a point. I haven't been completely honest with you.",
        "Katie: I'm so glad you could admit that. Excuse me.",
        "Brad: Okay, will you just --",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brad: Ah! Will you just hear me? Just hear me out! I didn't mess with you and Jack just for fun. I couldn't stand watching you two get close.",
        "Katie: Why?",
        "Brad: Because I'm jealous. There, I said it. I'm jealous. I'm jealous, I'm jealous, I'm jealous.",

        "Katie: No, just stop. Stop, stop, stop, please, just stop. I know that that's hard for you to admit. You're not the kind of guy who would come clean with a woman. But you and me? It's not gonna happen.",

        "Dusty: So your dealer friend Jesse's not gonna bother you anymore.",
        "Alison: What do you mean?",
        "Dusty: He stopped by for his money. His money?",
        "Dusty: Apparently, the party wasn't on him. That said, he knows he's not getting paid. If he goes near you again, I'll break his neck.",

        "Dusty: Drug dealing?",
        "Alison: Murder.",
        "Dusty: It would look like an accident.",
        "Alison: Well, that would then make me an accessory, right? Forget it.",

        "Emily: Are you sure?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I mean, I'm not hungry, so I might as well just go.",

        "Alison: And do what with it, water the plants? Kidding.",

        "Dusty: Well, she had a rough night. You too. You should go home and get some sleep.",
        "Emily: Oh, are you kidding me? I'm wired. I'm so wired. Do you believe her when she says she's committed to staying clean?",
        "Dusty: Why do you keep asking me this?",
        "Emily: Because I'm worried about my sister, Dusty.",
        "Dusty: She's gonna be fine. Is that what you want to hear?",
        "Emily: Yes, actually, that is what I would like to hear.",

        "Susan: Not another word. Except, I'm hoping that you'll let me do something for the two of you. Please?",

        "Susan: You know me. I don't like to pry. I saw that.",
        "Emily: Mother.",
        "Susan: Look, we're all adults here. And it's obvious to me that you and Dusty have a very special connection.",

        "Susan: Alison. I didn't know you were working this morning.",
        "Emily: Well, one of the waitresses was sick. So, they asked her to fill in, what's her name again?",
        "Susan: Oh, I hope it's not that awful stomach virus that's been going around. Baby, you don't look well.",
        "Alison: I'm fine. I just stayed up really late.",

        "Katie: Yes, I do! You are fun and you're good looking and sweet when you want to be. And funny, but I've dated a million guys like you. Well, not a million, but enough to know that's not what I want. I want a guy who calls when he says he's going to call. And shows up. And listens.",
        "Brad: I listen.",
        "Katie: No, you don't. You just want what you want, and I just -- I want --",
        "Brad: My brother.",
        "Katie: Yeah. I like Jack. I really like him and I know he likes me, too. And I think we have a real shot. And if you're any kind of friend or any kind of brother, then you'd be rooting for us.",

        "Katie: Well, next time, tell him to look somewhere else.",
        "Henry: What, no sparks?",
        "Katie: Oh, no. There's sparks. Just not with him. Henry, I think Jack and I can really make this work. It's so exciting. His kids are coming around now and I filed for divorce from Mike, so it's all coming together. And tonight, he's taking me to Chicago. We're going to have dinner and spend the night. I'm so excited. Would you say something, please?",

        "Realtor: I'll be in touch.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Yes, I'm looking for the number to Oakdale Cleaners. No, not the laundry, the housecleaning service. On Maple, I believe. Yeah, that's it. Right. Thank you. Oakdale Cleaners? Oh, I'm sorry. I must've misdialed. Yeah, all right, bye.",

        "Dusty: How about some coffee?",
        "Susan: No, I have to get to the hospital, actually. I know it's selfish of me, but I really thought that if she got in touch with some of her old friends, then she'd want to stay here.",
        "Emily: I think she does want to stay.",
        "Susan: Is that what she told you?",
        "Emily: Well, she hasn't said much of anything, but I know she's happy to be home.",

        "Dusty: Susan, what was it you mentioned earlier? You said that you wanted to do something for us.",
        "Susan: Oh yes, I almost forgot. I'd really, really, really like to take the two of you to dinner tonight. Just an early dinner so I can toast you and then you two can go off and do whatever it is you kids do.",
        "Emily: So, we toast, we eat, and you don't ask any questions cause you don't like to pry --",
        "Susan: I won't ask questions if you don't want questions. But I have to admit, that I am very curious about something. Given your history, how on earth did the two you ever get together?",

        "Vienna: Well, I can't go into details, but it's a police matter. But the prince, he might drop the nasty lawsuit against me.",
