        "Noah: My father escaped?",
        "Luke: Statesville's a maximum security prison. How could he get away?",
        "Officer Lewis: Let me ask the questions.",
        "Noah: He could be anywhere -- that's what you're saying?",
        "Officer Lewis: I'm not saying anything, Sir. What I'd like to know is, have you heard from your father in the past 24 hours?",
        "Noah: No.",
        "Officer Lewis: Do you have any idea what he was planning?",
        "Noah: What? Are you saying I'm a suspect?",
        "Luke: Noah and Colonel Mayer don't speak, Officer Lewis.",
        "Officer Lewis: So, you said you went to visit him recently?",
        "Noah: That was just so he could meet -- that was -- he wanted to make amends or something. Things didn't end so well for us, and he hasn't contacted me since. Now, can you please tell me how he escaped? I mean, did he hurt someone?",
        "Officer Lewis: No. He disappeared during a routine cellblock transfer.",
        "Noah: How does a prisoner just disappear?",
        "Officer Lewis: We think he had outside help.",
        "Luke: Ameera?",
        "Officer Lewis: Who's Ameera?",
        "Noah: My wife.",
        "Officer Lewis: And she knew your father? Then I'll need to question her, too. Where is she?",
        "Luke: We actually don't know. She disappeared this morning.",
        "Noah: I think she was kidnapped.",
        "Luke: Kidnapped? What?",
        "Noah: Luke -- Luke, it makes perfect sense. My father might be responsible.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Crap.",
        "Chris: Is there any kind of system to this?",
        "Alison: Yeah, getting all the facts from this paper into my brain.",
        "Chris: How's it working?",
        "Alison: How do you think?",
        "Chris: The offer to help still stands.",
        "Alison: What are you -- some kind of masochist?",
        "Chris: Med school wasn't that long ago. I remember how overwhelming it could be sometimes. And I care about you. You can say no, Ali. I'm just offering to help you review the material, not bribe Brenda to put you on the honor roll.",
        "Alison: I just -- I just want to graduate. I want this more than anything I've ever wanted in my whole life. And I don't want to admit it because, if I fail --",
        "Chris: You won't fail. I'm willing to take my life in my hands and tutor you again on one condition.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: How many times is that?",
        "Casey: Since last night or since we just locked the door?",
        "Emily: Who said youth is wasted on the young?",
        "Casey: You make me never want to stop.",
        "Emily: I know. Don't stop.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Okay, so, what is this one condition?",
        "Chris: I know you've been getting a hard time from the other nursing students.",
        "Alison: Yeah, most of them hate me. And I don't think Brenda's too nuts about me, either, ever since you did whatever you did to get her to give me that makeup exam.",
        "Chris: Brenda and I have an understanding.",
        "Alison: Yeah. Well, that doesn't mean she isn't gonna try to make my life miserable in the meantime. Oh, and my mother, she also doesn't approve.",
        "Chris: So we can't study here. We need complete privacy, like my place.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer Lewis: How long has your wife been missing?",
        "Noah: Just since this morning.",
        "Officer Lewis: That's hardly missing. She could be anywhere -- out shopping, taking a walk.",
        "Noah: She would have let me know, Officer. She's very traditional. She's Iraqi. She met my father when he was serving in Iraq.",
        "Officer Lewis: So she and your father had a relationship prior to your marriage? That makes her a person of extreme interest. I'll put out an APB.",
        "Noah: There's no way she's helping my father. If she's with my father, it's not by her own will.",
        "Luke: You don't know that for sure.",
        "Noah: Luke.",
        "Luke: Well, what about the letter?",
        "Officer Lewis: What letter?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Paul, hi.",
        "Paul: Hi. Sofie, have you seen my mom? I brought by the investment check for your jewelry line.",
        "Sofie: Oh, you're being so generous.",
        "Paul: Yeah, generosity's got nothing to do with it. My mom thinks you're gonna be big. That translates into dollars into my bank account. You know, you do well -- I do well.",
        "Sofie: Oh, not at the rate I'm going. I mean, your mom's been great about showing me the ropes. She knows what she's talking about, but this whole starting a business thing -- I don't know if I can do it.",
        "Paul: You're gonna do fine. My mom wouldn't waste her time or my money if she thought you were some kind of a lost cause.",
        "Sofie: Oh, wait. Before you go, can I ask you some advice on ordering? Because I have to -- I have to call distribution today, or I won't have anything for the sample sale. But I'm used to making one piece at a time. So do I order 10 clasps or do I order 50? Because if I order 50, then -- then, you know, it works out cheaper. But if I'm not gonna use them -- please, Paul, I need your help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: Hey, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Hi, Honey. Oh, don't you look lovely? You're so springy.",
        "Lisa: Well, thank you. Thank you. You look a little pale, Honey. Everything okay?",
        "Barbara: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm -- I'm just working real hard with Sofie on her jewelry.",
        "Lisa: Oh, well, as soon as you get me those pieces, I am putting them right there in the window.",
        "Barbara: Well, they won't be there very long 'cause she's gonna sell out. She's that good.",
        "Lisa: I'll bet. I'll bet. I certainly trust you on that. Honey, I really hope that you're -- that you're taking care of yourself, not doing too much all at once. Because with this business and everything, a new business, you know, you really -- it's time-consuming.",
        "Barbara: I know. I know.",
        "Lisa: Your health comes first.",
        "Barbara: I know, and I'm doing everything that the doctor is telling me to do, but helping Sofie just takes my mind off things, stops me thinking about speech therapy and radiation treatments. Its better medicine than anything those doctors can give me -- I'll tell you that. And it makes me feel like me, not just some cancer patient.",
        "Lisa: Well, that's certainly well-said, my friend. Well, if you need me, you want to just get together --",
        "Barbara: I'll call you. I'll call you.",
        "Lisa: Okay.",
        "Barbara: Get to work.",
        "Lisa: I will.",
        "Barbara: Got customers in there.",
        "Lisa: I know.",
        "Meg: Barbara.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You know what? I think my mom can help you with this. Barbara's been in business for -- well, for a long time, and she's probably really good at ordering.",
        "Sofie: Well, I don't want to lean on her too much while she's sick.",
        "Paul: She can handle it. She's made of iron.",
        "Sofie: Not so much, Paul. I mean, that's what she wants people to think.",
        "Paul: Well, I just -- look, she can help you. There's a reason that I'm a silent partner, you know. When it comes to the nuts and bolts of an operation, the clasps and everything, well, it -- it kind of makes me a little nuts.",
        "Sofie: Okay, well, just one more question. Please. Well, I have to order wholesale. I know you're supposed to get a discount. Do you have any idea how much?",
        "Paul: 10%. You can ask for another 5% as an incentive. You tell them that you're gonna give them a lot of business in the future.",
        "Sofie: Oh, I hope so.",
        "Paul: Sofie, you can't \"Hope so.\" You need to be strong with these people.",
        "Sofie: Thank you. You know, you're a great coach. I feel better already.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Would you like to put your head down?",
        "Barbara: Don't be ridiculous. I'm fine.",
        "Meg: Barbara, you almost collapsed. And if I hadn't been there to grab you, you could have really hurt yourself.",
        "Barbara: I just tripped over something. I lost my bearings -- that's all.",
        "Meg: Look, your pulse is weak, okay? And you're still a little pale. Please, let me take you to the hospital to get checked out.",
        "Barbara: No. No, I don't need that. I just -- I should have eaten some lunch.",
        "Meg: Well, yeah, you need to eat. You're in the middle of radiation treatment.",
        "Barbara: I know that. Look, I think I just overdid it with some shopping. I'm gonna go home and lie down.",
        "Meg: So, are you sure I can't convince you to go to the hospital?",
        "Barbara: Not to the hospital. I can't stand that place anymore. Could you do me a favor?",
        "Meg: Yeah, anything.",
        "Barbara: Would you get me home to the Lakeview?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Mm. Oh, I'm so glad I fired you. Makeup sex is unbelievable.",
        "Casey: How many times do I have to remind you I quit? Too bad that some things are easier to quit than others.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Tom: Emily? I know you're in there. Come on.",
        "Emily: It's Tom!",
        "Tom: Open up!",
        "Casey: Dad!",
        "Emily: Shh! Shh! [Clattering] Hang on! I'm on a call! [Exhales sharply] Ever hear the expression \"Call first\"?",
        "Tom: What, now you keep your door locked during business hours?",
        "Emily: Uh, no, no. I just don't have an assistant to shoo away unwanted visitors.",
        "Tom: Oh, that's right. Margo told me Casey quit.",
        "Emily: I fired him, actually. It wasn't working out. No chemistry.",
        "Tom: It's probably for the best. I mean, Casey working here was just trouble waiting to happen.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Yeah, I don't know if going to your place is such a good idea.",
        "Chris: Why not? Only helping you study. And where else can we go that no one will see us?",
        "Alison: Good point.",
        "Chris: Like I said before, I believe in you, and I have the whole night free to just beat you over the head with \"Gray's anatomy.\"",
        "Alison: Well, how can I resist?",
        "Chris: You can't. You ready to go?",
        "Alison: Maybe we should leave separately.",
        "Chris: Okay. Yeah, I'll go first, order up some brain food. See you soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Have a seat, Tom.",
        "Tom: Are you okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'm fine. Why?",
        "Tom: I don't know. You seem flustered, almost distracted.",
        "Emily: Look, I have a deadline, no assistant. I don't have time to talk, so what do you want?",
        "Tom: Well, actually, it's about Daniel. He -- he really wants to go to sailing camp this summer with a bunch of his friends from boarding school.",
        "Emily: Yeah, yeah. He told me. He told me all about it, including how much it's gonna cost.",
        "Tom: Oh, come on. You know I'll share that with you, I mean, if you approve. I think it'd be really good for him, yeah. I mean, it's gonna be demanding, but he will be outdoors with a lot of his friends.",
        "Emily: Right. And next year, he's gonna want his own boat.",
        "Tom: Oh, I know what you're thinking. Yeah, he will be mixing with a lot of rich kids from wealthy families, but, come on, we both know Daniel has a good head on his shoulders. I don't think he'll get distracted by the wrong things.",
        "Emily: Which is good -- which is good, because we don't -- we don't want our son growing up too fast, right?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Officer Lewis: What's this about a letter?",
        "Noah: Actually, it's just a letter that my father sent a few months ago. I found it with my wife's things. I was surprised that she had it, but she and my father were very close in Iraq. She -- she thinks that he saved her life.",
        "Officer Lewis: I'll need to see this letter.",
        "Noah: There's -- there's nothing in it about any escape or anything like that. If my father had even hinted about something like that, I would have told the authorities. My father belongs in jail. He's dangerous.",
        "Officer Lewis: Dangerous and most likely armed at this point.",
        "Noah: I know. That's what I'm afraid of. I mean, if he kidnapped Ameera --",
        "Officer Lewis: Don't worry. There's a major manhunt under way. I'll put your wife on the bulletin just to be on the safe side, but I'll need a recent photo.",
        "Luke: Oh, here you go.",
        "Officer Lewis: We've got a unit watching the place, in case Mayer shows up. In the meantime, if you hear from him, call this number.",
        "Luke: What's wrong with you? Why didn't you show him the letter Ameera left?",
        "Noah: I don't want to get her in trouble. You know, she may have already been kidnapped by my father.",
        "Luke: Yeah, but what if she wasn't? What if she went with him willingly, and she's helping him get away?",
        "Noah: She wouldn't have done that, Luke, no matter what you think.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Did you take your meds? I'll get them. I need you to rest -- no heroics.",
        "Barbara: I promise.",
        "Meg: You're not doing nearly as well as you let on, are you? You know, radiation treatment is debilitating, even for someone as strong as you. You know, maybe you should look at some outside care before you're done.",
        "Barbara: Absolutely not. If I -- if I need anything, I call downstairs -- they bring it up.",
        "Meg: So, in other words, you are too proud to ask for help.",
        "Barbara: I don't want everyone in the world knowing I have cancer. It's bad for business.",
        "Meg: So is passing out in public. You need help.",
        "Barbara: I have Sofie.",
        "Meg: Sofie's not here. And besides, she's not a nurse or even a nurse's aide. You need someone full time.",
        "Barbara: I am not gonna have some stranger roaming around here, alarming my family.",
        "Meg: Well, then you make that clear to whoever you hire. It won't be a problem.",
        "Barbara: No, it won't, not if you take the job.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Sofie, just so we're clear, I'm making an investment in your company.",
        "Sofie: Right. Silent partner. Got it. But that doesn't mean we can't be friends, does it?",
        "[Exhales sharply]",
        "Paul: You okay?",
        "Sofie: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I guess I got so busy that I forgot to eat. I'll pick up a pretzel at the newsstand.",
        "Paul: Come on, don't do that. Let's go. I'll buy you lunch.",
        "Sofie: Okay. Thank you. I'll -- I'll just leave a note for Barbara.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Why would you want me to work for you? We don't even like each other.",
        "Barbara: Exactly, which is why I can count on you to tell me the truth, not sugarcoat my prognosis. Tell me what the effects of treatment will be. That would mean a lot to me.",
        "Meg: Well, thank you for the offer, but it won't work.",
        "Barbara: Think about it.",
        "Meg: I am thinking, and I'm thinking this is a ploy to get me back with Paul.",
        "Barbara: Excuse me? I am fighting for my life here, and I'm asking for your help as a nurse.",
        "Meg: Can you give me your word that Paul didn't set this whole thing up?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: You know, it's really weird being waited on in a place where I used to do the waitressing?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, I'm sure once your jewelry starts selling, you'll be eating here all the time. It's the only -- only place in town for a great, big power- business lunch.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Sofie: You know, Barbara wants to have a kickoff party for the jewelry line. Maybe I'll do it here.",
        "Paul: That's a great idea.",
        "Sofie: Oh, but I don't know what I would wear. But, you know, I do like the dress that your mom got me for the party at Metro, so maybe I'll wear that.",
        "Paul: Are you joking? Sofie, you can't be photographed wearing the same thing twice. Here, you know what? You should -- you should go and buy yourself something pretty, you know? Get yourself some shoes, too, if you feel like it -- whatever you want.",
        "Sofie: Seriously?",
        "Paul: Yeah, Sofie. You're in the fashion industry now. It comes with the territory.",
        "Sofie: Ah, I feel like Cinderella. [Laughs] But now all I have to do is find my prince.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: There's no way Ameera could be helping my father.",
        "Luke: How do you know that? They had some sort of secret. Maybe this is it.",
        "Noah: If Ameera breaks the law and gets caught, her visa would be revoked, and she could get deported. She wouldn't jeopardize that. Plus, the state department guy said there were no red flags. Everything she said about my father checked out. He took care of her and her mother, and that's the end of the story.",
        "Luke: And yet, somehow, the story hasn't ended.",
        "Noah: Damn it, Luke! We have no reason to be suspicious of her!",
        "Luke: See, I disagree about that, Noah. I don't think it's a coincidence that Ameera disappears, and your father escapes from prison on the exact same day.",
        "Noah: Neither do I. He took her somewhere, and I know it! I can't let Ameera become another one of his victims. Considering that he killed my mother and nearly killed you, why don't you feel the same way?",
        "Luke: What proof do you have that Ameera's in trouble? She left you a note saying she was basically fine.",
        "Noah: Well, maybe she didn't write it.",
        "Luke: It was her handwriting.",
        "Noah: But she talks about getting our marriage annulled. I mean, that's not something Ameera would say. I've never even heard her use that word.",
        "Luke: So what? You think your father made her write the letter?",
        "Noah: Maybe.",
        "Luke: Or maybe they wrote it together. She has secrets. She was hiding something -- even you admitted that.",
        "Noah: If she's with my father, it's because she trusts him, which means she's in way over her head, and we have to help her.",
        "Luke: No. All we can do is let the cops handle this.",
        "Noah: No way. I'm gonna try and find her, and I want you to help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Chris: What's the password?",
        "Alison: Very funny. Let me in, Chris.",
        "Chris: You got it your first time. Quick, before anybody sees you.",
        "Alison: Get over yourself.",
        "Chris: Did anybody recognize you in the elevator?",
        "Alison: You know, it's a good thing you decided to become a doctor instead of a stand-up comedian.",
        "Chris: You're right. There's no laughing in study hall. Make yourself comfortable. I didn't have time to pick up any food. Want to order?",
        "Alison: Nope. I am here for work -- that is all. Can we please start with the skeletal system?",
        "Chris: Oh, bones we got. Okay. Pop quiz.",
        "Alison: The carpal bones.",
        "Chris: Which are?",
        "Alison: Pisiform, triquetrum, capitate, hamate, lunate, scaphoid, trapezoid, and trapezium.",
        "Chris: Jackpot. Shall we move on to ligaments?",
        "Alison: Oh, I'm -- I'm still learning them. Can we just stick with bones today?",
        "Chris: What's this?",
        "Alison: I said bones. And that is the xiphoid process.",
        "Chris: Ribs.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, there are seven sets of true ribs attached to the sternum by cartilage. Five sets of false ribs that are not attached to the sternum, but to the ribs above.",
        "Chris: What's different about the bottom two ribs?",
        "Alison: What do -- what do you mean?",
        "Chris: Come on, Ali. You know this. It's the easiest one yet. What's different about these two ribs?",
        "Alison: Okay, maybe I just shouldn't have come here.",
        "Chris: Why? What's going on?",
        "Alison: I just -- I need to go, okay?",
        "Chris: Ali, wait. Don't leave.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: So, each pair of kids has their own boat for the whole session, so it's not just about sailing. They learn responsibility.",
        "Emily: That's good. Responsibility's good.",
        "Tom: Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Emily: Yeah, I'm okay. I'm -- I'm all right. You know what? I'm -- I've been sitting here so long. I've got a deadline. Why don't you just leave this with me, and I'll get back to you?",
        "Tom: Sure, I can do that. Do me a favor -- don't wait too long, because the spots fill up.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Tom: Oh, one more thing.",
        "Emily: Yeah.",
        "Tom: It's about Casey.",
        "Emily: Casey? What about him?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: I meant what I said before about Paul. He doesn't really know how I've been feeling, and I want it kept that way.",
        "Meg: Someone in your family needs to know what's going on.",
        "Barbara: Paul has enough to worry about right now.",
        "Meg: And you're not afraid I'll tell him the truth?",
        "Barbara: I think you're the last person that would go running to Paul with anything.",
        "Meg: He loves you. He would want to know the truth.",
        "Barbara: And it's a mother's job to protect her children.",
        "Meg: That goes both ways, you know. Give him the opportunity to help you.",
        "Barbara: Paul needs to help himself right now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Sofie: Oh, I can't eat all this.",
        "Paul: Sure, you can. You have to. You need to keep up your strength for dress shopping.",
        "Sofie: Will you come with me? You used to be in the fashion business.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that was a long time ago, Sofie.",
        "Sofie: But you know what you like, right?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter what I like. You need something that's gonna make you feel like a million bucks. And I'm sure you'll look beautiful in whatever you choose.",

        "Meg: I'm gonna call downstairs to the restaurant and order up some juice.",

        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Barbara: Is that a yes?",
        "Meg: All right, I'll work for you. But that means I give the orders, so you need to stay there and rest.",
        "Barbara: Well, I can't do that right now. I have to go see Sofie. She's expecting me.",
        "Meg: No. Excuse me, excuse me. You are in no condition to do that.",
        "Barbara: I have no choice, Meg.",
        "Meg: If you don't want people to know how sick you are, then you need to come up with an excuse.",

        "Sofie: Are you sure you don't want to come with me? You are paying for it. [Cell phone ringing] Oh, sorry. Just a second. Hi, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Sofie, glad I caught you. Listen, I've got to head out to New York in a last-minute business trip, and I'll be back very soon. I'll see your samples.",
        "Sofie: How soon?",
        "Barbara: We're boarding, and I'll call you when we land. Got to go.",
        "Paul: What was that all about?",
        "Sofie: Your mom is at the airport on her way to New York.",
        "Paul: Really? Did she say why?",
        "Sofie: Some kind of last-minute business.",
        "Paul: Well, come to think of it, there's something I got to take care of, too. I'll see you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Now, don't get me wrong. I think Casey probably learned a lot working with you. I just didn't see it lasting.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Can I make a confession, Tom? After the guy the temp agency sent me, I almost wish I hadn't fired him. In fact, you know, I would be willing to give Casey his job back if he was interested.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Barbara: Hi, Honey.",
        "Paul: You don't sound like you're at the airport.",
        "Barbara: Oh, we're about to take off. I will talk to you later, when I land, okay? Got to go. Bye.",
        "Paul: Excuse me. You haven't by any chance seen Barbara Ryan this afternoon, have you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: You get some rest, and I'll be back to check on you later, okay?",
        "Barbara: Thanks. Thanks, Meg.",
        "Meg: Just doing my job.",
        "Paul: Which one of you is gonna tell me what's going on?",
        "Meg: I ran into Barbara in Old Town, and she had a bunch of shopping bags. So I gave her a hand home. Yeah, I got to go.",
        "Paul: How sick are you?",
        "Barbara: I just needed a little uninterrupted time to rest.",
        "Paul: Why did you tell Sofie that you were getting on an airplane? Why didn't you just call me to say that you needed some time alone?",
        "Barbara: Because you have enough to worry about right now.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Barbara: Who are you calling?",
        "Paul: I'm calling the hospital.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no! Please put that thing down. I don't want to go to the hospital. Meg is gonna take good care of me.",
        "Paul: Meg?",
        "Barbara: I hired Meg as a private nurse to help me until the end of my treatment.",
        "Paul: Mom, you can't stand Meg. Why would you choose her?",
        "Barbara: I did it for you.",

        "Noah: She left her cell phone.",
        "Luke: Maybe that's because she doesn't want you to call her.",
        "Noah: Or maybe she left it on purpose. All these calls are to me, except this one to Statesville that you overheard and this number I don't recognize. Where's 718?",
        "Luke: I think its New York.",
        "Noah: Should I call it?",
        "Luke: No, no, no. Wait. Let me do something first.",

        "Chris: I wasn't coming onto you, Ali. I promised you this would be about school. Are you just uncomfortable being here because of what happened the other night?",
        "Alison: You mean what didn't happen? Yeah, maybe.",
        "Chris: I don't know how to convince you it didn't bother me.",
        "Alison: Well, it bothered me, Chris. And it's why I didn't even want to come here tonight.",
        "Chris: Well, because you don't want people gossiping about us or because you go nuts whenever I get anywhere near you?",
        "Alison: Okay, I'm leaving.",
        "Chris: I think you have a problem.",

        "Tom: So, Casey comes back to work for you. Do you really think our families could peacefully coexist?",
        "Emily: Tom, this isn't about families. This is my business -- my business and Casey's business. He's a grown man. He can make his own decisions.",
        "Tom: A grown man? By the way, have you heard from him?",
        "Emily: No, why?",
        "Tom: He didn't come home last night. Margo and I are a little worried.",
        "Emily: Well, I'm sure he can take care of himself. Casey's a big boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: I knew there was no way we could mix work and a relationship without it blowing up in our faces. And when I tried to set some boundaries, well, your answer to that is to start touching me.",
        "Chris: Believe me, if I touched you the way I want to --",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Chris: Okay, you know what? Fine. I got the message. All right? You're focused on school. And for the record, I think that's a great thing.",
        "Alison: Don't be condescending.",
        "Chris: I'm not! Damn it, Ali! I just can't seem to win with you these days. I touched you, yes, but it was not sexual -- it was clinical. You overreacted.",
        "Alison: I know clinical, and it was not that.",
        "Chris: You have some things you need to work out. Maybe it's post-traumatic stress or something.",
        "Alison: Meaning what? You think I need therapy?",
        "Chris: You know what? I think that's a great idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: Well, I have an appointment with a client, so I really gotta go. Do me a favor -- look over the brochure tonight, 'cause Daniel kind of has his heart set on it.",
        "Emily: Well, apparently, you do, too.",
        "Tom: Come on, it's not about me. We can -- we can work this out for his sake.",
        "Emily: Well, it was never a question about that, was there?",
        "Tom: No, no. I just -- I just wanted to be clear.",
        "Emily: Okay.",
        "Tom: Are you aware that Daniel worships you and needs your approval? He really wants you more involved with his life.",
        "Casey: That was so close!",
        "Emily: This has to stop -- right now.",
        "Casey: What has to stop?",
        "Emily: This! This. All of it. You -- you hiding half-naked under my desk, sucking my toes while I'm trying to talk to your father.",
        "Casey: You were so turned on by it.",
        "Emily: Yeah, well, it has to stop, okay? Listen to me. It has to stop. I am a mother. I am a mother. my God, Daniel is your half-brother. Do you have any idea how -- how horrible this is? This could blow up in our face, and I cannot do this. I cannot self-destruct yet again.",
        "Casey: What's so destructive? That I'm younger than you? Who cares? We're great together.",
        "Emily: Based on what -- your vast experience with women?",
        "Casey: So teach me.",
        "Emily: Oh, God. Get dressed. You're distracting me. Go.",
        "Casey: Oh, stop. You still want me.",
        "Emily: No. No! No.",
        "Casey: Why not?",
        "Emily: I cannot do this anymore. \"Why not?\" Because I have responsibility to my son -- Daniel. My God, he's the only right thing in my life. My son and this paper, and if I -- do you have any idea what would happen if Tom found out that I slept with you? He would take my son away from me, and I can't let that happen. So just stop, okay? I cannot be with you anymore.",

        "Chris: There's worried and not handling it.",
        "Alison: Why? Because I don't fall at your feet?",
        "Chris: Stop it Ali, all right? I'm worried about you. First, I thought I was just reading too much into your behavior, but --",
        "Alison: My behavior?",
        "Chris: I thought you were overwhelmed with school and worried about trying again with me, but then you sabotaged yourself by sleeping through that test. And the way you jumped when I just touched you -- there's something going on, and I think you need to deal with it before you seriously blow something you really care about.",
        "Alison: I see. So you think I'm crazy.",

        "Sofie: Fine. Fine, I guess.",
        "Lisa: Good, good. Well, I'm -- actually, I'm talking about your jewelry. You see, I ran into Barbara a while ago, and I told her I was going to fix -- just dedicate a whole window just to your things as soon as I get some of the pieces. Is this -- is this one yours?",
        "Sofie: Oh, yeah, yeah. It's one of the older ones.",
        "Lisa: Oh, that is so lovely.",
        "Sofie: Thank you.",
        "Lisa: Yes, it really is. I could sell that just like that. You're gonna be such a success.",
        "Sofie: Oh, I hope so. But, you know, it's not just Barbara I'm doing business with. Paul's invested a lot in the company, too.",
        "Lisa: Paul? Well, he certainly knows a good investment when he sees it.",
        "Sofie: Yeah, well, I think it's more than that.",
        "Lisa: Are you saying that it's personal?",
        "Sofie: Well, he did give me his credit card to buy a dress for the press party, so that sounds kind of personal, right? I think he really cares about me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Meg is the best nurse there is, but if this is some kind of a trick to get her to spend more time around me, Mom, it's just not gonna work.",
        "Barbara: I need a nurse. I want you and Meg back together. Don't you see how those two things kind of overlap?",
        "Paul: Well, it's not just an accident, Mom. I don't believe that. Nothing just happens around you.",
        "Barbara: If that were true, I wouldn't be stuck here on a couch in the middle of the day. Don't you see that?",
        "Paul: You cannot manipulate Meg. It's why she fell out of love with me in the first place.",
        "Barbara: Did you see her reaction when she opened the door, and she saw you there? She's still crazy about you. She just needs a little nudging -- that's all.",
        "Paul: No, no, Mother. No more -- no more \"Nudging.\"",
        "Barbara: Life is too short. And if you find someone that you want to be with, you've got to do everything you can to be with them. Trust me on this, okay? Trust me. Regret is a tragic waste of time.",

        "Luke: Noah, are you kidding? We need to hand this over to the police.",
        "Noah: We can't. If we show this to the cops, they'll know that Ameera left me, and they'll want to have her deported. I'm not gonna put her life at risk, and I'm not gonna let you do the same.",

        "Emily: No. No, if you want your job back, it's yours. But you have to be professional. Can you work for me without benefits?",
        "Casey: It won't be easy. You know, every time I look at you, I just think about --",
        "Emily: Well, don't. Don't. It's wrong on so many levels.",
        "Casey: Yeah. The chair level, the floor level.",
        "Emily: I'm not joking, okay? I'm serious. I can't risk losing my son. Besides which, having sex with one's assistant is -- is really not a good idea.",
        "Casey: Okay, define \"Good.\"",
        "Emily: Will you stop?",
        "Casey: You were saying \"Don't stop\" a minute ago, you know? Look at you. You're all hot and bothered, and I haven't even touched you. What happens when I get that urge again?",

        "Noah: Fine. You go, talk to the cops. I'll just -- I'll stay here in case Ameera calls.",

She did have an ulterior motive in hiring you as her nurse. She very much wants to see the two of us back together. And while I appreciate the sentiment, I don't think I can support something so underhanded.",
