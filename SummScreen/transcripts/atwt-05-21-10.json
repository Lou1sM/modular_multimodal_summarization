Once Parker is taken down to be booked, Carly tells Jack that she will never forgive him for not doing more to protect Parker.

        "Carly: I know you think I made things worse, but I was -- I was lying for Parker to keep him out of jail.",
        "Jack: He's not going to go to jail.",
        "Carly: How can you say that? That is -- it's a serious possibility here, Jack.",
        "Jack: Come on, we can't think like that, though.",
        "Carly: Okay. Okay. We can't fight like this anymore, all right?",
        "Jack: I don't want to either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Didn't you hear me? I said I did it. I'm the one that knocked Gabriel out.",
        "Margo: Parker, just -- just slow down and take a deep breath and don't say anything more.",
        "Parker: Margo --",
        "Margo: No, you have a right to an attorney. I can't let you do this alone. I'll get your mother and father down.",
        "Parker: Why? It's not going to change the truth.",
        "Margo: Parker, I am trying to talk to you.",
        "Parker: I'm the reason that Gabriel could die. I knocked him out. I left him in Monte Carlo before the fire broke out. I'm confessing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker's not in his room.",
        "Jack: His bike is gone.",
        "Carly: Okay. All right, let's not panic. Maybe he needed some air. Maybe he wanted to avoid hearing the two of us self-destruct.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: How long has the doctor been in there with Gabriel?",
        "Nurse: Just a few minutes. He'll let us know if there are any changes.",
        "Lily: Thank you. I really appreciate it.",
        "Nurse: Sure.",
        "Lucinda: Oh.",
        "Lily: Mother.",
        "Lucinda: What a shock to see you here.",
        "Lily: [Sighs] I'm making up for the both of us.",
        "Lucinda: What do you mean by that?",
        "Lily: Mother, that boy is fighting for his life because of what we did.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know what orb you have been inhabiting, but we had nothing to do with what happened in there.",
        "Lily: We kept the secret from Craig about Gabriel being his son for years -- you, me, Sierra. Because of what we did, this is what happened to him.",
        "Lucinda: I totally disagree with you. As you well know, Craig is responsible for everything that has happened in there, because that is what Craig does. He hurts people that get close to him, and he does it time after time.",
        "Lily: That is not true.",
        "Lucinda: Isn't it? What about Bryant? I mean, chasing Lucy out of town? And now this poor kid, Gabriel -- he's the next one on the list, after your sister. And me -- what about me? He had his hands around my throat. He was going to snap my neck like a chicken.",
        "Lily: Look, we can't undo what we did to that boy, but we can try to make something good out of this horrible situation. We owe him that.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, all right. So we can visit him in the hospital, pay his hospital bills. Are we supposed to give him sponge baths? Darling, what is it you want us to do?",
        "Lily: Well, for starters, I told Margo that Craig knew Gabriel was his son before the fire. That way she could see there was no way Craig knowingly intended to harm anyone, least of all his son.",
        "Lucinda: You did what?",
        "Lily: You heard me.",
        "Lucinda: You vouched for -- on the record?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Lucinda: [Groans] Why did you do that? Why? With Craig in jail, 99.9% of our problems are solved.",
        "Craig: It surely would be better for you if I were locked away somewhere. That much is true.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Good afternoon. Al's Diner. Can I take your order?",
        "Dusty: Yes. I'd like a Janet on whole wheat. Hold the mayo.",
        "Janet: [Laughs] How long did it take you to come up with that one?",
        "Dusty: I'm very spontaneous.",
        "Janet: So I've heard.",
        "Dusty: So, you ready?",
        "Janet: For what?",
        "Dusty: Our date.",
        "Janet: Dusty --",
        "Dusty: You suggested we start over with a date.",
        "Janet: I told you I'd think about it.",
        "Dusty: I figured you already had.",
        "Janet: Well, Dusty, I'm at work.",
        "Dusty: I know. Your shift's over in 10 minutes. I'll be right over.",
        "Janet: Wait! Dusty, for the -- [Groans] Ew. Oh. I can't go out looking like this. [Scoffs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: He's not picking up. Where are you going to look for him?",
        "Jack: I'm not sure yet.",
        "Carly: I'm going to come with you, okay?",
        "Jack: Carly, please, just stay here in case he comes home.",
        "Carly: No, I'm coming!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: It's Margo. Hey, Margo, what's up?",
        "Margo: Jack, I need you to come down here.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it's not really a good time right now.",
        "Margo: Your son is here. He just confessed to fighting with Gabriel and leaving him unconscious on the floor before the fire started.",
        "Jack: I'll be right there.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: Parker's at the police station with Margo.",
        "Carly: Oh, my God.",
        "Jack: He's confessed.",
        "Carly: Oh, no. Oh, we have to be with our boy.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You look beautiful.",
        "Janet: [Gasps] So do you. I mean, the flowers -- the flowers are just beautiful. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Are you nervous?",
        "Janet: Not in the least.",
        "Dusty: Good. This is a special day.",
        "Janet: I hope so.",
        "Dusty: Oh, yeah. You got to trust me.",
        "Janet: I want to give it a shot.",
        "Dusty: Good.",
        "Janet: So, where are we going on our big date?",
        "Dusty: I can't tell you.",
        "Janet: Why not?",
        "Dusty: It'll ruin the surprise.",
        "Janet: Well, we can't have that, can we?",
        "Dusty: I'll tell you this much. We're going to look back on May 21st, and we're going to say this was the beginning of our time together.",
        "Janet: Oh, my God.",
        "Dusty: What? What did I say?",
        "Janet: Did you say that today is the 21st?",
        "Dusty: Yes. Why?",
        "Janet: I'm sorry, Dusty. This isn't going to work.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Call the security guard.",
        "Lily: No, I'm not going to call security. Craig isn't going to attack you in the middle of the hospital. Are you, Craig?",
        "Craig: No, I'm not. Believe me, Lily, if I wanted your mother dead, she'd be out of your misery already.",
        "Lucinda: Oh! Look at that. He's threatening me.",
        "Craig: No, I'm not, Lucinda. You have nothing to fear, not from me.",
        "Lucinda: Really?",
        "Craig: Really. You see, I've given it some thought, and I think the harsher penalty for you would be to die alone, unloved, in your mansion on the hill of old age. Which, by my calculation, shouldn't be too much longer.",
        "Lily: Craig, I'm just as culpable in this as my mother.",
        "Craig: Yes, you are, but at least you tried to make amends. Your mother, on the other hand, is proud to keep a father and son apart for two decades!",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I am. I'm rather proud. I'm proud that that kid was kept out of your orbit for all those years. Think of the mess that he'd be if he'd been around you.",
        "Craig: That's almost profound. Why don't you ask Gabriel if he agrees with you? Lucinda, you didn't just play God with my life, but with his, as well.",
        "Lucinda: I don't know what goes on inside that kid's mind.",
        "Craig: And thanks to you, old woman, neither do I.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, but I do know -- I do know that he would be a more full-blown con artist than what he has exhibited so far if he had been around you and had you as a role model all these years.",
        "Lily: Oh, Mother, for God's sake, please stop adding fuel to the fire.",
        "Lucinda: I'm not going to back off just because he tells me to. That poor kid in there, the one that you want to call son -- he actually deserves a happy life. But he won't have a chance, not with you near him.",
        "Craig: Doctor, how is he doing?",
        "Doctor: You're paying the medical bills, Ms. Walsh. If you'd like a report, we can speak privately.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I think that's a good idea. Let's speak privately.",
        "Lily: No. Answer his question.",
        "Doctor: And who are you?",
        "Craig: I'm Craig Montgomery. I'm Gabriel's father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Parker, don't say a word.",
        "Parker: I already did, okay? I know what I'm doing.",
        "Carly: Parker! Seriously, Margo, without a lawyer here?",
        "Jack: Margo, what are you thinking?",
        "Margo: Your son came in on his own, asked to make a confession. I told him he needed an attorney present.",
        "Parker: She did. I just -- I don't need one.",
        "Carly: Parker!",
        "Jack: Well, he is not saying another word until we get an attorney.",
        "Parker: Dad --",
        "Margo: Fine, fine.",
        "Jack: No, no! You are not going to say another word until we get this handled. Do you understand me?",
        "Parker: No! I'm not doing this your way anymore. I want to tell her the whole story right now. What difference does it make if I have a lawyer?",
        "Jack: It makes a big difference, Parker!",
        "Parker: I don't care. I don't need one. I'm not doing what you guys want me to anymore, okay? I'm doing this my way now.",
        "Carly: No, it is not okay. None of this is okay. Come here.",
        "Parker: Mom, what are you doing?",
        "Carly: What were you thinking?",
        "Parker: Why did you come down here?",
        "Carly: Margo called your father. She told him that you admitted to knocking Gabriel out.",
        "Parker: Because I did.",
        "Carly: It was an accident, Parker! You just had a fight!",
        "Parker: And he could still die, accident or not. This is exactly why I didn't want you here.",
        "Carly: Excuse me?",
        "Parker: You're making this so much worse. Just let me do it, okay? Just let me confess and get it over with.",
        "Carly: Listen to me, Parker Snyder. You will confess over my dead body. Parker, I know you're feeling guilty about what happened to Gabriel, but I am telling you this right now. There will be no signed confession.",
        "Parker: Mom, I already told her. It's too late.",
        "Carly: No, it isn't. Without a signed confession, Margo has nothing. She might try to act like she does, but she doesn't. Now, you are going to come back out there with me, and you are not going to say another word. She can't force you into making a statement. Do you understand?",
        "Parker: Stop asking me if I understand you. Yes, I understand.",
        "Carly: Parker, you didn't set the fire. You didn't do anything wrong. Please, you've got to stop talking to Margo. I'm your mother. I'm trying to take care of you here.",
        "Parker: This is ripping you and Dad apart.",
        "Carly: You heard us fighting at the house, didn't you?",
        "Parker: It's hard not to.",
        "Carly: And that's why you came here to confess.",
        "Parker: You want to protect me, and so does Dad, but you guys can't agree on how you're going to do that, so you're fighting 24/7.",
        "Carly: Parker --",
        "Parker: I can't be the reason that Gabriel dies, and I will not be the reason that you and Dad break up.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Here's your case file on Gabriel Caras. You knew that Craig didn't leave him there to die, but you wanted me to think so -- so that I wouldn't look at your son. How long has Parker been involved in this, huh? How much of that evidence did you rewrite to throw suspicion off of your son?",
        "Jack: No, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a second, wait a second! On my word, I did -- I had no idea that Parker and Gabriel got into a fight until recently! I certainly didn't suppress evidence, and I didn't hold a thing back!",
        "Margo: You held back the truth.",
        "Jack: I was dealing with it, Margo.",
        "Margo: How? By keeping it to yourself, by protecting Parker and throwing everything at my brother?",
        "Jack: Your -- your brother deliberately started a fire! That's arson!",
        "Margo: Listen. I understand what you're going through. I do. I understand the agony you're feeling about your son. I've gone through it, too, myself, Jack. But you are not just a father. You are an officer of the law, and you deliberately sabotaged this investigation.",
        "Jack: No, no, it is so much more complicated --",
        "Margo: It is not so much more complicated, Jack. You are off the case.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: So Gabriel's off the ventilator and breathing on his own? Is he awake?",
        "Doctor: Not yet, but I'm hopeful that's coming.",
        "Craig: I don't know how to thank you, Doctor.",
        "Lucinda: I'll bet.",
        "Craig: Thank you. I'd like to sit with him for a while, maybe be there when he wakes up.",
        "Lily: Maybe that's not such a great idea.",
        "Craig: I want him to know that I'm here for him, that I'm not walking away.",
        "Doctor: Your son is a very, very strong man.",
        "Lucinda: No thanks to the sperm donor.",
        "[Craig sighs]",
        "Lily: [Sighs] Are you okay?",
        "Craig: I am now. It sounds like he's going to be okay. He's going to make it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Today's my father's birthday.",
        "Dusty: I didn't know that.",
        "Janet: No, of course not. How could you? I was planning a really big party for him this year to make up for the ones we missed.",
        "Dusty: Now you can't.",
        "Janet: [Sighs] That man hurt me more than anybody else ever did. We were just starting to find our way back into each other's lives.",
        "Dusty: But you think it was too late.",
        "Janet: I'd be lying to you if I said I didn't. I'm just mourning a man I was just starting to get to know again.",
        "Dusty: And you blame me.",
        "Janet: Oh, Dusty, I'm not really big on blame. I just -- I'm not over his death yet, or the way it happened.",
        "Dusty: Not a good way to start a first date. I'm sorry.",
        "Janet: So am I.",
        "Dusty: These flowers need water. And I'm not sure you should be alone.",
        "Janet: Oh, please. [Sniffles] I'm kind of a buzz kill right now, right?",
        "Dusty: You're my friend, Janet. Put these in water for me. I appreciate it. Thank you.",
        "Janet: They really are beautiful flowers.",
        "Dusty: Well, the more beautiful they are, the more TLC they need. Shall we try again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Don't you need to get back to your cave and hang upside down?",
        "Lucinda: You're a little, little man, Craig.",
        "Craig: I don't want you anywhere near my son when he wakes up.",
        "Lucinda: I don't take directions from arsonists and would-be murderers.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Craig: Margo, what great timing. I have incredible news.",
        "Margo: No, no, no, no. Me first. Parker confessed.",
        "Craig: Excuse me?",
        "Margo: He confessed to fighting with Gabriel before the fire started. Craig?",
        "Craig: Margo, I can't remember the last time I had two amazing things happen to me on the same day in the last 30 years. Can you meet me at Java so we can talk?",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way. Be there in 10 minutes.",
        "Craig: Parker Snyder just confessed to knocking out Gabriel and leaving him there.",
        "Lily: What? Are you serious?",
        "Craig: Yes, which means I'm no longer a suspect. So despite your best efforts, I will have an opportunity to get to know my son. Make sure she doesn't go into his room. I approve his visitors from here on in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Carly: He did it for us.",
        "Jack: What?",
        "Carly: He confessed for us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: We should go.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, why don't you go along, okay? I don't feel like chatting.",
        "Lily: Well, neither do I, but we should listen to what Craig said and go.",
        "Lucinda: The nerve of him, throwing us out when you're the one that's paying the bills.",
        "Lily: Mother, please.",
        "Lucinda: [Sighs] I got my car. I'm okay. He's waiting for me. You go ahead.",
        "Lily: Don't get any ideas.",
        "Lucinda: Honey, I'm fresh out. [Sighs] I mean, I've done everything I can do for that poor boy. And if fate decrees that Craig be part of his life in the future, there is nothing I can do to stop that.",
        "Lily: Are you okay?",
        "Lucinda: I'm fine.",
        "Lily: Love you.",
        "Lucinda: Oh. Oh. Hi. Hi, there. Hello. Young man, you gave us all quite a scare. But don't try to say anything. Take it easy. Take it easy. You know, you've had a terrible ordeal, and you need rest. [Laughs] I'm so pleased that you've come through, Gabriel.",
        "Gabriel: Do I know you?",
        "Lucinda: I'm Mrs. Walsh. I was a friend of your dear mother's.",
        "Gabriel: How?",
        "Lucinda: Let's not talk about that right now. All you have to do right now is listen, okay? Your mother was a wonderful, sweet, dear woman. May God rest her soul. Now, we cannot say the same for your father, can we? Lidia Caras deserved much better than the likes of Craig Montgomery. Wouldn't you agree with me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: They're taking him off the ventilator, and the doctor says he should be waking up soon. He called him my son, and he told me he is a very, very strong young man. He's just like me, Margo. He's a fighter. He's a survivor.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, really, what choice did he have?",
        "Craig: And now that Parker's confessed to being the one that knocked Gabriel out and left him there, I'm totally off the hook.",
        "Margo: You know, I really hate to rain on your ticker-tape parade, but you know, you're still facing indictment for arson and insurance fraud and the extortion and grand theft. But other than that, you're totally off the hook.",
        "Craig: Can I have at least five seconds of relief?",
        "Margo: Honey, you know, if this was just about Gabriel's recovery, yes. The answer would be yes.",
        "Craig: I guess I'm not making myself clear. I welcome these hurdles, Margo.",
        "Margo: You welcome these hurdles?",
        "Craig: Yes, because once I jump over them and get to the other side, I have a second chance with my son. I get a do-over for all the mistakes that I made going all the way back to the ones that I made with Bryant. People like me don't get lucky like that very often. So I'm happy. I'm grateful. Please, be happy and grateful with me.",
        "Margo: I hear you. I do. And I am happy. I am.",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Margo: But you know that there is like an army of people out there who would lay money down that you're going to screw up the second chance.",
        "Craig: Yeah, I know. Let them. I'm going to prove them all wrong.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: What?",
        "Dusty: Let's talk about it.",
        "Janet: About you and me? Dusty, what more is there to say?",
        "Dusty: About your father.",
        "Janet: What about him?",
        "Dusty: Well, I know it's been a long time since you celebrated a birthday with him. What was it like when you did?",
        "Janet: I barely remember. I was pregnant with Liberty and out of the house. I was just a kid myself.",
        "Dusty: You got to remember something.",
        "Janet: [Scoffs] Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Dusty: I'm just asking. What were his birthdays like?",
        "Janet: [Sighs] Okay. Well, it wasn't just his birthdays that were special. It was the whole Ciccone family. If it was your birthday, nothing else on that day mattered. And if a baby was born, that day was cause for a big celebration in the Ciccone house.",
        "Dusty: Tell me.",
        "Janet: [Sighs] For every child that was born, my father would go out to the backyard, and he would plant a tree. [Voice breaking] And every year on that child's birthday, he would take a picture of the tree and the kid, and he'd show them how much they had grown.",
        "Dusty: That's nice.",
        "Janet: Oh. \"The family orchard\" -- that's what he called it. And when I went back for his funeral, I went out to the backyard to look at the orchard, and there was -- [Voice breaking] A brand-new baby tree that had been planted. I'm sorry. And I asked my brother Eddie about it.",
        "Dusty: It was for Liberty?",
        "Janet: Yeah. He planted it for her after he met her in the hospital last winter.",
        "Dusty: I'm glad you found out about it.",
        "Janet: Me, too. I wonder if he would have told me, though, because he was so private about so many things. Oh -- and I know he would have wanted to get to know this new little baby. [Voice breaking] And I know he would have planted a tree. But now he can't.",
        "Dusty: Well -- your father's not the only one who had ideas, you know?",
        "Janet: What are you talking about?",
        "Dusty: Come with me. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: He heard us fighting at the house.",
        "Parker: All you guys do now is fight about me. I had to tell the truth. I got tired of lying.",
        "Jack: What you did took a lot of courage. It was very brave.",
        "Parker: I still feel like a coward for not coming forward sooner, but I couldn't let you guys break up because of a lie that you were telling to protect me. I had to tell the truth.",
        "Jack: Are you kidding me? I am very proud for what you did today. Coming forward on your own -- that took a lot of guts.",
        "Parker: So, what happens now?",
        "Jack: I'm not totally sure. I know one thing, though. We're doing this by the book from now on. We'll get an attorney, all of us on the same page. Okay?",
        "Parker: Are you going to lose your badge?",
        "Carly: Parker, don't spend a moment thinking about that, okay?",
        "Jack: Your mother's right. No, what you should be focused on right now is you and you alone.",
        "Parker: What about you guys?",
        "Jack: What about us?",
        "Parker: You aren't going to break up because of this, are you?",
        "Carly: We are a united front from here on out, the family, and that's that. Right?",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "Parker: I'm so sorry.",
        "Jack: Don't be sorry anymore. Just be honest. We all will be.",
        "Cop: I have to take him downstairs for processing.",
        "Carly: No, this is -- Jack, this is crazy. It's your case. Can you find a way to just stop this for now until we get a lawyer and figure out what happens next?",
        "Jack: It's not my case anymore.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: Margo took me off it.",
        "Parker: It's okay. I'm ready.",
        "Carly: No. Oh, Parker -- oh, Sweetie.",
        "Parker: I'm okay. I'm okay, Mom, really.",
        "Jack: Here, Buddy. All right. You be strong. He'll be okay, all right? This is just procedure. Okay, I know you're upset. I am, too.",
        "Carly: No, you're not.",
        "Jack: It makes me sick what this could mean for him.",
        "Carly: You should have thought of that before. This is all your fault, Jack, and I will never forgive you for it.",
        "Jack: This is exactly how we ended up here today -- fighting and blaming each other -- so much so that Parker felt he had to come in and confess to make us stop.",
        "Carly: Which you congratulated him for doing.",
        "Jack: Yes! Our son walked in here, Carly, and he confessed because he has his own moral compass.",
        "Carly: He is not a criminal! He didn't do anything wrong! He had a fight! He made a mistake! He didn't do anything even remotely life-threatening to Gabriel! He's our son, and because of you and your moral compass, we're going to lose him!",
        "Jack: Oh, excuse me, I think we're leaving out a huge piece of the puzzle here, like how you kicked me out so you could cover up a lie you forced our son to tell. Maybe I could have helped Parker if you told me what was happening a little sooner.",
        "Carly: And if I told you sooner, you could have guilted him into confessing a little sooner then!",
        "Jack: You know what? I can't talk to you. I'm going to go call an attorney. Parker is going to be processed, and then he's going to come back up here. Wait for him, okay?",
        "Carly: Oh, don't worry. I won't abandon our son.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Craig, I mean, you've said yourself that you've blown every chance you've ever had to be a good father.",
        "Craig: I do all right with Johnny.",
        "Margo: Yes, yes, you do all right with Johnny, but -- and I hope that you get a chance to do all right with Gabriel, as well. I hope that you've learned your lesson.",
        "Craig: I have.",
        "Margo: Amen. But, you know, this sudden epiphany that you've had after a really, really bonehead move is just -- has all sorts of ramifications beyond just getting caught, you know?",
        "Craig: I know, I know, but -- it's been complicated from the start, Margo.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, you want to hear my theory on it, hmm?",
        "Craig: Now you ask for permission?",
        "Margo: Yeah. So I think that when Gabriel came to Oakdale, it was at the request of his dying mother to go and meet the father that he never knew. And before he got a chance to tell you who he is, he caught on to what you were doing -- and what you do, Craig, is you lie and you cheat and you steal, and you try and cut every corner to get what you want.",
        "Craig: Well, it's not something I'm proud of, but --",
        "Margo: So instead of finding this man who was learning from his mistakes, like a mistake he made 20 years ago in Montega --",
        "Craig: I didn't know about him.",
        "Margo: -- He found a man who was lying and cheating and stealing from a young man's trust fund to try and hold on to a woman who didn't even want to be with him. So I think Gabriel was just trying to be like his father. But unfortunately, that's the only side of you that he knew. So if you think that you want to have a productive relationship with this boy, then you've got a lot of repair work to do.",
        "Craig: I know.",
        "Margo: Because if Gabriel is recovering, then this is a gift, Craig. And please, I don't want you to look this gift horse in the mouth. Please don't throw away this prize.",
        "Craig: Remind me again why I asked you out for coffee.",
        "Margo: Well, to bribe me to go and meet my nephew.",
        "Craig: Gee, maybe I can bribe you to say some nice things about me.",
        "Margo: I'm going to try.",

        "Dusty: You have to wait. Don't be so impatient.",
        "Janet: I can't help it. I hate surprises.",
        "Dusty: Oh, people say that, but they really don't mean it.",
        "Janet: No, I really mean it. I spent 20 years avoiding surprises. [Janet sighs] We're at the back of my apartment complex.",
        "Dusty: Surprise.",
        "Janet: What's going on?",
        "Dusty: This is in honor of the Ciccone tradition and your father's birthday.",
        "Janet: Oh, Dusty, that is so sweet. We're not exactly dressed for planting.",
        "Dusty: You just don't like to work.",
        "Janet: Excuse me?",
        "Dusty: You like sitting back and giving orders. I know your type.",
        "Janet: Oh, you have obviously never dared a Ciccone woman.",
        "Dusty: Take it easy.",
        "Janet: Give me that. Come on. I'll do the heavy lifting.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no. No, you're not. You're pregnant.",
        "Janet: I'm not shoveling snow.",
        "Dusty: Just get the hose and be quiet, okay?",
        "Janet: [Groans] This is a barrel of laughs.",
        "Dusty: Women!",
        "Janet: Men! You're not doing it right. You're putting too much dirt in the hole.",
        "Dusty: Same amount that came out of the hole, Sweetheart.",
        "Janet: Einstein, that's because there's a tree in it now. Oh, my goodness.",
        "Dusty: Now you can water it.",
        "Janet: Oh, can I?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Oh, I'm sorry! I slipped! I'm sorry! Sorry!",

        "Craig: Thank God.",
        "Margo: That's wonderful.",
        "Lily: I left, but the hospital called me because I'm the contact person and everything. I hope you're okay with that.",
        "Craig: Yes, yes, of course. Of course, I'm all right. Lily is footing the hospital bill.",
        "Margo: Well, that is really generous of you.",
        "Lily: After everything we've done, it's the least we could do. So, what are you waiting for? Go say hello to your son.",
        "Craig: Ooh. I think I need you with me, Sis.",
        "Margo: Oh, no, come on. My questions can wait 15 minutes.",
        "Craig: Margo, I mean I can't do this alone.",
        "Margo: Okay. Come on. Go. Come on. Hi. Gabriel, I'm Margo. I'm Craig's sister. I'm also a detective with the Oakdale police department. Do you know where you are? Yes? Good, good, good. Now, I know that you've been through a lot, and so I don't want to take up much of your time, but I do have to ask you a couple of questions. Do you remember what happened to you?",
        "Gabriel: I remember everything.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: That wasn't supposed to happen.",
        "Dusty: Neither was the water fight, but fun.",
        "Janet: Thanks. Oh, I got it. Whoo-hoo! [Sighs]",
        "Dusty: Pretty good, right?",
        "Janet: My father would approve.",
        "Dusty: Now, that says something.",
        "Janet: Hey, I know I've been a pain in the butt today, but I love the fact that you did this for me.",
        "Dusty: You're easy to do things for, Janet.",
        "Jack: What's all this?",
        "Dusty: Nice timing, Jack.",
        "Janet: Uh, we are planting a tree in remembrance of my father's birthday. Dusty actually planted it for the baby.",
        "Jack: Oh, that's nice.",
        "Janet: Is something wrong?",
        "Jack: Yeah, a lot, actually.",
        "Janet: What is it?",
        "Jack: Well, without telling anybody, Parker walked into the station this morning and confessed.",
        "Janet: Confessed to what?",
        "Jack: Getting in a fight with Gabriel before the fire. That's why the kid was on the floor in Monte Carlo when the fire started.",
        "Janet: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, now I'm on my way to the lawyer's office. Of course, he did all this on his own without an attorney present, so I got to move pretty fast. But then I started thinking that Liberty should probably hear about this before she finds out from anybody else, you know?",
        "Janet: Oh, thank you for thinking of her.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I know. Well, given her relationship with Parker and everything -- she was worrying about Gabriel, so --",
        "Janet: She is not home right now, but I promise you, Jack, I will tell her the minute I see her.",
        "Jack: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Janet: Wait -- how is Parker?",
        "Jack: He's handling this beautifully, actually. I'm proud of him.",
        "Janet: How are you?",
        "Jack: I don't quite know how to answer that.",
        "Janet: Well, you and Carly will get through it together.",
        "Jack: Yeah, I should -- I should probably get going. I got a lot of stops to make.",
        "Dusty: Janet, why don't you go with Jack, help him deal with all this?",
        "Janet: Really? You sure?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Jack, do you want me to come with you?",
        "Jack: I would very much appreciate that, yeah, if --",
        "Janet: Yeah. Just give me, uh -- give me 10 minutes to clean up and get ready and -- and I'll be right with you.",
