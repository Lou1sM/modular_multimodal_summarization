        "\r\nBonnie: Hello there, boys and girls. My name is Bonnie McKechnie. \r\nWhat's my real job, you ask? Well, I am the co-owner of the hottest club in \r\nOakdale. Hello there. I'm Bonnie Louise McKechnie, Duchess of Glasgow, \r\nbut all of you may call me Bonnie. What up, lil' homies? My name is Baby \r\nBonBon. You know what I'm sayin'? Fo'shizzle. And I'm up in here for \r\nstraight almost cappin' my moms, you know what I'm sayin'? Of course you \r\ndon't. Neither do I. Okay, come on, Bonnie. You can do this. You can \r\ntotally do this. ",

        "\r\nBoy #1: Before I met Ms. McKechnie, I thought reading was a real drag. \r\nBut then, she introduced me to \"Little Women,\" and I got so into it, it's my \r\nnew favorite thing. Now I'm reading all of Shakespeare. ",
        "Girl: After just two weeks with Ms. McKechnie, je parle francais \r\nparfaitement! Merci, mademoiselle! ",
        "Boy #2: I used to think girls were lame and stupid. But after spending \r\nsome quality time with a female role model like Bonnie, I have a whole new \r\noutlook. ",
        "Bonnie: Do you know, when I first got started, I was actually scared to \r\ndeath. But I am so grateful that I've had the opportunity to make a real \r\ndifference in your lives, as you have most certainly made a difference in mine.\r\n\r\n",

        "Isaac: Where were you at just then? ",

        "\r\nRosanna: I distinctly remember you saying you were going to back off. ",
        "Craig: Well, there are extenuating circumstances. ",
        "Rosanna: Mm, that came up between here and the car? ",
        "Craig: I was returning the phone call from my attorney. ",
        "Rosanna: What part of \"I'm not bailing you out again\" did you not \r\nunderstand? ",
        "Craig: Well, but this isn't a bail out, exactly. It's more of a business \r\narrangement. ",
        "Rosanna: Ah. This should be good. ",
        "Craig: Barbara Ryan wants to make the deal to keep me and half of \r\nOakdale out of prison. ",

        "Rosanna: I would think the only thing Barbara wants from Monte Carlo \r\nare bankruptcy papers. But if she wants to design again, no problem. Fine \r\nwith me. Fun to watch the two of you kill each other. ",
        "Craig: She doesn't want to design for Monte Carlo. She wants to own \r\nMonte Carlo. ",

        "Barbara: And you understand why I need those documents immediately? ",
        "Marshall: Not entirely. Why the rush? ",
        "Barbara: Because I want to be on the 6:30 flight to Paris, which means I \r\nhave to be at O'Hare at 4:00. ",
        "Marshall: You're going after Paul tonight? ",
        "Barbara: I would have gone after him a lot earlier had it not been for Craig\r\n\r\nand his plagiarizing posse. I have to tell Paul about this, tell him that we \r\nhave \r\nsomething to work for. I can offer him something. I mean, working together \r\non Monte Carlo will begin to heal us. I know that. ",
        "Marshall: Would you like some advice from someone who's managed to \r\nalienate everyone he cares about? One grand gesture isn't going to erase what\r\n\r\nwent down with you two. Making amends takes time. ",
        "Barbara: Shouldn't you be drafting a letter of intent? ",
        "Marshall: In case I miss you, is there any contact information while you're\r\n\r\nin Paris? ",
        "Barbara: I'll get it to you when I have it. It was a pleasure doing business\r\n\r\nwith you, Marshall Travers. At least, it was today. \r\n",

        "\r\nHal: I held off on telling you this, hoping it was a mistake. They found \r\nPaul's plane. It went down in the Atlantic. ",
        "Rose: What do you -- when you say it went down, you mean he's made an \r\nemergency landing, right? ",
        "Hal: The Canadian authorities found the wreckage off the coast of \r\nNewfoundland. ",
        "Rose: Wreckage? Oh, Hal -- ",
        "Hal: No, no, no, no. No, come on. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? \r\nThe Canadians are treating this as a search and rescue. The crash was very \r\nclose to land. ",
        "Rose: What, so you're saying that he could've, like -- he could have swam \r\nright there, right into the shore? He was that close to the shore? ",
        "Hal: Well, yeah, it's conceivable. ",
        "Rose: Well, he's a good swimmer. He is. He's even got one of those \r\ncertificates at home. ",
