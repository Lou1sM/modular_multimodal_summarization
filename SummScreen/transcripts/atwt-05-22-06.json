        "Katie starts to question Nick's role in Mike's case. Carly and Katie join forces to find information out on Nick. Katie pretends to be Nick's wife in order to get the necklace Nick brought to the jewelers. Katie finds out from Eli, the forensics scientist, the DNA they found on the necklace, could be from a close relative. Katie takes her concerns to Jack, who tells Katie that Nick has an airtight alibi the night of the murder. Nick goes to pick up his necklace at the jewelers only to find out his \u0091wife' picked it up. Mike finds Carly waiting for Katie inside his house and is immediately suspicious, but Carly covers for the most part. Dusty asks Jen to marry him, and she happily accepts. Lucinda offers to throw them an engagement party. Later, Dusty suggests he adopt Johnny, and Jen again is overjoyed. Emily finds Paul looking at her ultrasound picture; he claims he stopped by to bring her the divorce papers to sign. When she asks about the papers to relinquish his parental rights, Paul secretly takes those papers out of the pile, and claims Jess didn't have them ready. Emily is nervous Paul may be changing his mind. Henry comforts her and promises to help find out what Paul is up to. Susan and Meg have some words as she is clearing Emily's stuff out of Paul's apartment. Meg is there to surprise Paul because she has decided she wants a life with him. Paul arrives home shocked that she is there. He seems preoccupied by thoughts of the parental rights papers. Meg asks if Emily signed the papers; Paul lies by omission by answering that Emily signed the papers he put in front of her. Meg believes they are free to go anywhere the want now. Paul comes back to reality and tells Meg he is happy she came back; he had been envisioning his life without her in it and he realized his life would have been very empty without her. Henry makes a call to Jess' office and finds out that Paul picked up both sets of papers earlier that day. Emily is panicked about why Paul lied to her; Henry promises they will figure out what Paul is up to."

        "Katie: Here's what the report said. I wrote it down. \"The DNA markers are consistent with Michael Kasnoff.\"",
        "Carly: What does that mean, \"consistent\"?",
        "Katie: I don't know. It was enough to arrest him at the time. But now --",
        "Carly: Well, we're just going to have to find out. The question is, how do you and I interpret a DNA test?",
        "Katie: We ask an expert.",
        "Carly: Like who?",
        "Katie: Eli King.",
        "Carly: Well, who's that?",
        "Katie: He works at Memorial. He works in the -- um, genetics lab. And he does forensics for the Oakdale Police Department. At least he used to.",
        "Carly: No, no, that's right. I remember Jack talking about him. He said he was an excellent witness.",
        "Katie: Perfect, let's go.",
        "Carly: Wait, go where?",
        "Katie: To Memorial. We'll have him look at the test and interpret it for us.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, no, no. Wait a minute. I can't do that.",
        "Katie: Why not?",
        "Carly: Well, you were at the police station. You heard what happened. I was told in no uncertain terms to stay out of it.",
        "Katie: Oh, right.",
        "Carly: I can't risk getting caught.",
        "Katie: Okay, you're right. I can handle this on my own. Don't worry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: What do you think, buddy? Can I ask your mom to marry me? You on board? If you are, I need your help. Okay, just give us a sec.",
        "Jennifer: Oh, yeah, don't mind me.",
        "Dusty: If I do this right, I only have to do it once. Right? I love you, Jen. I can't imagine a single day without you and Johnny. [Baby fussing] Come here. You make me be the best that I've got in me. And I pray to God I can be the same for you.",
        "Dusty: For now.",
        "Jennifer: Are you're sure?",
        "Dusty: Will you marry me?",
        "Jennifer: Yes!!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: What are we celebrating? Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Meg: What are you doing here, Susan?",
        "Susan: Cleaning out drawers, for you, I presume. The rest of Emily's things.",
        "Meg: Oh. Did you find it all?",
        "Susan: I wouldn't be surprised if I take this stuff to the hospital and Emily looks at it as if she never saw it before. As if it belonged to somebody else, because -- it does.",
        "Meg: Hospital?",
        "Susan: Oh, that's right. You don't know. Emily was committed to the psych ward for evaluation.",
        "Meg: She's not being arraigned?",
        "Susan: Huh, no. The judge thought that she needed help before she needed any punishment. Oh, I'm sorry if that's a buzz kill for you and Paul.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You can't tell much from that. Not yet.",
        "Paul: Well, you must be able to tell something.",
        "Emily: You know have to know how to look, what to look for. I can see that that's my child in there.",
        "Paul: I brought the divorce papers. I -- you know, I didn't want to just dump them here and then leave.",
        "Emily: Thanks.",
        "Paul: Here, you can sign them now if you want.",
        "Emily: I need a pen.",
        "Paul: All you gotta do is sign and it's all over.",
        "Emily: It's pretty simple, right? Jailhouse wedding only lasted a couple of days. All we have to do is erase those days.",
        "Paul: Yep.",
        "Emily: At least on paper.",
        "Paul: That's right. [Paul sighs] I'm surprised to see you here.",
        "Emily: It's only observation.",
        "Paul: You must be relieved.",
        "Emily: Don't worry. I'm gonna be locked up. Okay? Either here or in a jail. Don't worry about it.",
        "Paul: I don't mean it like that. Come on. You okay?",
        "Emily: Why do you ask? Really, you don't have, you know, go through the motions of asking about me, pretending you care.",
        "Paul: I'm not. I really want you to get better.",
        "Emily: I will. And this is a good start. Where are the other ones?",
        "Paul: What other ones?",
        "Emily: The other papers -- giving up your rights to my baby. Don't you have them too?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: Yes?",
        "Jennifer: Yes. If you want to. If you want to get married.",
        "Dusty: I do. You're surprised?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, a little. Honey, I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Dusty: That's good.",
        "Jennifer: And I'm still going to cut Paul out of my life.",
        "Dusty: For your own sake, I hope.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah. But also because I'm not going to let him or Emily cause you anymore grief. But all that'll happen whether you marry me or not. I don't want you -- I don't want you to feel like you have to prove anything.",
        "Dusty: Are you trying to get out of it already?",
        "Jennifer: No, no. I don't want to become a chore or an obligation. I don't want you to feel trapped.",
        "Dusty: I don't.",
        "Jennifer: I want it to be a choice always. Always I want you to feel you want to be there. 'Cause there's a reason you never got married before. I mean, you like your freedom.",
        "Dusty: I do, but it gets old.",
        "Jennifer: But it's -- it's a huge part of who you are and I don't want to change that. I love you like this. Okay? So, you -- I want you to do whatever is right for you and then that will be what is right for me.",
        "Dusty: You sure about that?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Okay, you got it.",
        "Jennifer: Good.",
        "Dusty: Jennifer?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah?",
        "Dusty: Will you marry me?",
        "Jennifer: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Don't make me ask again.",
        "Jennifer: No, that's -- that's my final answer.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What do you want, Susan?",
        "Susan: I want a whole and healthy daughter again. Paul has twisted her so many ways that it's a miracle she didn't -- she didn't break before this.",
        "Meg: So, this is all Paul's fault? He made her do these terrible things?",
        "Susan: You know he did. He used you, too.",
        "Meg: Emily's a sick woman. Paul didn't create that.",
        "Susan: No, but he used it. Didn't he? To get what he wanted at the time. Now, he's going to be here tonight, celebrating, drinking champagne. While my daughter sits in the psych ward wondering if she's ever going to get to raise the baby she's carrying. Does that sound right to you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm a little distracted today.",
        "Emily: Yeah, I know the feeling. Trust me. So, do you have the relinquishment papers?",
        "Paul: Jessica will have them soon.",
        "Emily: Soon?",
        "Paul: Yeah, a couple days.",
        "Emily: Why the delay?",
        "Paul: I -- I don't know.",
        "Emily: So you were wrong? This is not over?",
        "Paul: I'm really sorry.",
        "Emily: No, you said you wanted this to be over, the sooner the better. This was your idea, this whole thing. You couldn't wait to be separated, officially separated from me and my baby.",
        "Paul: I don't know why the divorce papers are here and everything else took longer. Maybe the family court takes a few days, you know, because the decision is so final.",
        "Emily: So, wait, wait. What are you saying? You have to come back now?",
        "Paul: Well, I can have them sent by messenger if that's what you want.",
        "Emily: I want -- I want this to be over, just like you do. But there's nothing I can do to make that happen, only you can. This is your job. So please, just get it done!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Eli, hey, wait up! Katie Peretti. Remember?",
        "Eli: Yes! You threw out my hair and skin cell samples.",
        "Katie: They told me to clean the lab.",
        "Eli: Not after that.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Eli: You -- working here again?",
        "Katie: No, no. Don't worry. I just -- I have a question about a DNA. Do you have a minute?",
        "Eli: Sure.",
        "Katie: Okay, would you be able to look at two samples and tell what it means if it says they're consistent with a match.",
        "Eli: Sure.",
        "Katie: Great! Let's go to the police computer.",
        "Eli: Whoa, whoa. You want me to look at tests the police department ordered?",
        "Katie: Yeah. You just have to look at them, you don't have to do anything.",
        "Eli: Except lose my job for browsing through evidence. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Katie, it's about time!",
        "Mike: Hi.",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Mike: Hi. Why are you in my house?",
        "Carly: Just waiting.",
        "Mike: For Katie, yeah, I heard that.",
        "Carly: Well, I'm happy to see you, too. So I guess the fish weren't biting.",
        "Mike: Not really. How'd you know I went fishing?",
        "Carly: Katie said something.",
        "Mike: You've seen her today?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, just a little while ago.",
        "Mike: Where is she?",
        "Carly: She had to go out.",
        "Mike: And she left you here?",
        "Carly: No, not exactly. We left at the same time. But then I remembered that I'd forgotten something, so I came back, and the door was open.",
        "Mike: Mm-hmm. What'd you forget?",
        "Carly: To invite you and Katie to dinner. I figured since you can't have a real honeymoon, you might as well have a night out. Huh?",
        "Mike: Uh-huh. Well, I'll check with her when she comes back. What night?",
        "Carly: Huh?",
        "Mike: This dinner invitation. What night would you want us to come?",
        "Carly: Whenever you want. Whenever is good for you is good for me. So, just talk to Katie, and let me know. Okay? I'll see you later.",
        "Mike: Okay, how did you really get in here?",
        "Carly: Through the door.",
        "Mike: Katie would never leave the door unlocked. You're here trying to get the goods on Nick, aren't you? You trying to set him up again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Eli, I know it's a big deal. I know I'm asking a lot.",
        "Eli: You are.",
        "Katie: But it's not for me, it's for Mike.",
        "Eli: Who?",
        "Katie: Mike Kasnoff.",
        "Eli: The contractor?",
        "Katie: Yeah, you must remember him. He built the whole new wing the hospital. He built your new lab.",
        "Eli: Yeah, he's a good guy.",
        "Katie: Yeah, a good guy who would never stuff a dead girl in a wall and leave her there for 20 years, right?",
        "Eli: Doesn't seem the type, no.",
        "Katie: He isn't! But the police think that they have some DNA.",
        "Eli: DNA that makes Mike look bad?",
        "Katie: Maybe. But it doesn't seem 100% definite. And there's nothing I can do until I know what they really have. I just want to understand it. I swear, it's like I said before. You just have to read the tests and interpret them for me. You have access to the work done by the police department, don't you?",
        "Eli: Yes.",
        "Katie: Computer access.",
        "Eli: As a matter of fact, yes. I do forensics, so I'm authorized.",
        "Katie: Please, can you please just help me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nick: Hi, I'm here for a pickup. Nick Kasnoff. It's a St. Christopher's medal. Is there a problem?",
        "Clerk: I'm afraid so. It's not here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Let me ask you something. Do you honestly think Emily should be having a baby right now?",
        "Susan: When I honestly think, \"Is that her husband who didn't love her, shouldn't have slept with her?\" And if she wants to have this baby, I can't judge her for it.",
        "Meg: And you'd be happy to raise it?",
        "Susan: Oh, yes. And I'm happy to know that that baby will never have to know what a rotten father it had.",
        "Meg: You know, you just can't give him credit for doing the right thing, can you? I mean, he's doing what you and Emily and everybody wants, and still you find a way to hate him for it.",
        "Susan: I hate that whatever Paul does, he never has to pay the price. Because for some reason, he's always able to convince some woman to take care of him, and to take the fall for him.",
        "Meg: That's not true.",
        "Susan: Oh, no? He had you standing by while my daughter's clothes were still hanging in the closets. By the way, you can tell Emma to give me a call when it's time to clean your things out of here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You know, when I was locked up, all I could think about was you and Johnny. I'd miss you every second.",
        "Jennifer: Shh. No more of that.",
        "Dusty: And you are never, ever an obligation to me. You're the reason I wake up in the morning.",
        "Jennifer: Well, then let me wake up next to you for the rest of my life.",
        "Dusty: Done.",
        "[Lucinda gasping]",
        "Lucinda: Oh, wow. Oh, what --",
        "Dusty: Hi there.",
        "Lucinda: What's obstructing my path?",
        "Jennifer: Can we?",
        "Dusty: Yeah, sure. Go ahead.",
        "Lucinda: Hey.",
        "Dusty: Hey.",
        "Lucinda: Hi there.",
        "Dusty: How are you?",
        "Lucinda: How are you doing?",
        "[Lucinda gasping]",
        "Jennifer: Uh, Lucinda, we're -- we're engaged.",
        "[Dusty laughs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I don't mean to make things harder for you.",
        "Emily: I'm trying to look forward. When I think about carrying this baby, I feel better. I feel like there's hope in my life for the first time since New Year's.",
        "Paul: Well, that's great.",
        "Emily: I want a life without you, whatever life that is, just me and my baby. That's what you want, right?",
        "Paul: I want nothing but what's best for you, truly.",
        "Emily: Okay, so that means I go my way, you go your way. We cut all ties. You give up your right to this child, legally, permanently.",
        "Paul: I'll -- I'll send you the papers as soon as Jessica gets them back. You take care of yourself.",
        "Emily: Oh, God.",
        "Henry: Nice digs. Wow, this is way better than that bare mattress, no- furniture suite you had booked at the state pen.",
        "Emily: Oh, you're here. Oh.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'm here.",
        "Emily: How did you get in here?",
        "Henry: Well --",
        "Emily: Dr. Felicia Goldberg?",
        "Henry: Yeah, well, they don't look at the pictures too closely around here. Thank goodness. How -- how are they treating you?",
        "Emily: I'm fine.",
        "Henry: Well, you don't look fine.",
        "Emily: Paul was here.",
        "Henry: Ah, that -- that'll ruin the day.",
        "Emily: It could be worse than that.",
        "Henry: What did he do?",
        "Emily: Nothing, at least not yet. But I'm telling you, if Paul changes his mind about wanting to give up this baby, I could be in big trouble.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hi. I -- I have some questions about Emily Stewart.",
        "Nurse: You mean Mrs. Ryan?",
        "Paul: Yeah. [Paul laughs] Yeah, you've been told that she's pregnant, right?",
        "Nurse: Yes. It's in her chart.",
        "Paul: Are you all set up for prenatal care? Everything you can do to make sure she's healthy, make sure the baby's healthy.",
        "Nurse: Of course. Are you from the court or a family friend?",
        "Paul: Neither. I'm the father.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Meg: Tell me Emily pulled a fast one.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Meg: So she signed?",
        "Paul: Everything in front of her, yes.",
        "Dusty: I want to make it legal.",
        "Jennifer: You want to adopt Johnny?",
        "Katie: This is Mike's medal.",
        "Jack: There's only one problem, Katie. Nick has an airtight alibi for august 29th, 1993.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Did you find the test?",
        "Eli: Yeah, they ran a comparison between Kasnoff and a sample off a piece of jewelry?",
        "Katie: Right.",
        "Eli: It's a small sample, so there's not enough tissue for a full work-up.",
        "Katie: So the test could be invalid?",
        "Eli: No, it doesn't mean that. It just means that there's a reason why they could only classify it as \"consistent.\"",
        "Katie: It couldn't be wrong?",
        "Eli: No. No, an incomplete sample won't give you a false match, it'll give you a limited match. It could still be Mike's DNA.",
        "Katie: No, it's not. What are the other possibilities?",
        "Eli: Someone in the family. Blood relation.",
        "Katie: How close a relation?",
        "Eli: Mm, from the markers I saw, pretty close. Parent, sibling, aunt or uncle, first cousin. But no more distant than that.",
        "Katie: Oh, boy.",
        "Eli: It seems I've hit a nerve.",
        "Katie: Maybe. Thank you, Eli, so much.",
        "Eli: This helped?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Eli: I have to be getting back.",
        "Katie: Okay. Thank you again.",

        "Carly: I did not break into your house to spy on Nick.",
        "Mike: Then why did you break in?",
        "Carly: Nobody said I did.",
        "Mike: Carly, it's me. I've seen you work even longer than Jack has.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Yes?",
        "Katie: I found Eli.",
        "Carly: Good. And?",
        "Katie: He looked at the test, and get this. The DNA is definitely from someone in Mike's family. Somebody close, like a brother or a cousin.",
        "Carly: Well, that's no surprise.",
        "Katie: Maybe not to you, but I'm sick about it. I mean, I want Mike to be cleared, but it will kill him to find this out about Nick. I got to take it to Jack.",
        "Carly: He's at the farm today.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Carly: Friend of Jack's. So, I'll see you later.",

        "Nick: It's a St. Christopher medal. I dropped it off here a few days ago.",
        "Clerk: Under your name?",
        "Nick: Yes, Kasnoff. I spoke to an older man. He said it'd be ready by today. I think it was the owner.",
        "Clerk: I'll get him.",

        "Lucinda: I don't know who's glowing more. Hey, kid. Maybe he is. Johnny Donovan. Aw, it's a family.",
        "Dusty: Well, this'll make it official.",
        "Lucinda: No, I'm gonna make it official. I'm gonna throw you an engagement party.",
        "Dusty: Oh --",
        "Jennifer: No, Lucinda, you don't have to do that.",
        "Lucinda: Well, I know. I --",
        "Dusty: It's not necessary.",
        "Lucinda: I want to do it.",
        "Dusty: It's not necessary.",
        "Lucinda: No, I want to throw a big, beautiful bash, okay? And it doesn't have to be necessary. I want to do this because it's not necessary. It's fun!",
        "Jennifer: That's really nice of you. You know, I'm gonna take Johnny for a little stroll.",
        "Dusty: Okay, we'll be here.",
        "Jennifer: All right.",
        "Lucinda: We'll be here.",
        "Jennifer: Okay, honey. All right.",

        "Lucinda: Yeah. Absolutely.",

        "Lucinda: Oh. Forgot. The young doctor -- you know, he's so cute. He told me I got to get out of my ivory tower and get fit.",
        "Dusty: You look great.",
        "Lucinda: I'm clean.",
        "Dusty: How are you feeling?",
        "Lucinda: I'm clean. I'm clean. I had my -- I had my check-up. Knock on wood, everything's fine, so it's a good day!",
        "Dusty: Isn't it? It is. You don't have to throw that party at your house?",
        "Lucinda: What?",
        "Dusty: Your house. You gonna throw it at your house?",
        "Lucinda: Oh. I see what you mean. You mean, the place where you almost -- almost proposed to my granddaughter?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Lucinda: Darling, she got married in my house. So, you see, it evens it out, the whole thing.",
        "Dusty: Small town.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, tell me about. So small, I mean, if I let that bother me, I'd never be able to set foot out a door, for heaven's sake. So, banish ghosts. Let's have a party, dum-bah-da-da. You got a ring?",
        "Dusty: No. I didn't want to jinx it, yet.",
        "Lucinda: Why? Hey, wait a moment. This is on a more serious note, darling. You didn't jinx it before. What you did was probably the best and the finest thing that you have ever done in your life, to let Lucy go. And you happy now?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. Completely.",
        "Lucinda: Well then, this is the right one for you. Hey. Hey. I'm really so happy for you.",
        "Dusty: Thank you, darling.",
        "Lucinda: I am.",
        "Dusty: Thank you.",

        "Henry: I thought Paul was out of the family picture.",
        "Emily: Yeah, so did I. I mean, that's what he swore to me. And then he shows up today with the divorce papers, but not a word about the parental rights papers. And when I asked him about it, he -- he got really strange.",
        "Henry: Oh, well, Em, I hate to break it to you, but the guy's always been strange.",
        "Emily: No, Henry, this -- this was different. He was in my room when I got here. He was looking at the picture, the sonogram picture.",
        "Henry: Okay. Okay, and so he couldn't decide which end was up. I mean, there's just a little blob here. You can't really bond with the little guppy.",
        "Emily: Unless you know it's yours.",
        "Henry: Em, I think you're reading too much into this. What did he say when you asked him about the papers?",
        "Emily: He said that Jessica was working on them. It was gonna take a couple of days, blah, blah, blah. But I couldn't get him to actually repeat the fact that he definitely wanted to give up the baby.",
        "Henry: What, did you give Paul a quiz?",
        "Emily: Sort of. Yeah, it was a test, and he knew it. Oh, God, Henry.",
        "Henry: No, steady, steady, steady.",
        "Emily: I'm in trouble here. I'm like a sitting duck sitting here.",
        "Henry: How? How's that?",
        "Emily: Because I'm either gonna be locked up in here or in a jail cell when I give birth to this baby. And unless he gives up his rights, he could get control of my child.",
        "Henry: Even if you designate your mother as the guardian?",
        "Emily: She's not gonna win over the biological father! Paul could come in and take away my baby! Oh, my God. And then Paul and Meg Snyder end up raising my child?!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Hey, Paul, it's me. Could you give me a call as soon as you get in?",
        "Paul: Hi. Are you --?",

        "Paul: Are you calling me?",
        "Meg: Ah, yeah.",

        "Meg: Surprise.",
        "Paul: I'll say.",
        "Meg: Really, 'cause that's funny. 'Cause you're super said you told him one day, I'd be knocking at your door.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, everybody's got a dream. Does this mean what I want it to mean?",
        "Meg: Um, I'm not sure now.",
        "Paul: Why not?",
        "Meg: Susan was here. She said Emily's not going to jail?",
        "Paul: That -- that doesn't change anything.",
        "Meg: No? You took the papers to her?",
        "Paul: Yeah, of course.",

        "Carly: I don't.",
        "Mike: Then what are you up to?",
        "Carly: Do you really want to know?",
        "Mike: Yes.",
        "Carly: I was trying to talk Katie down.",
        "Mike: Oh?",
        "Carly: She's upset, and she didn't want you to know. She knew I'd understand, so she called me. She's scared for you, Mike.",
        "Mike: I know. Well, if she got you over here to cry on your shoulder, why'd she leave you alone?",
        "Carly: She -- she went to work out.",
        "Mike: At the gym?",
        "Carly: You know, I don't know. Maybe.",
        "Mike: Carly --",
        "Carly: What? I didn't feel the need to grill her. She said that going for a run might clear her head. And I waited here, because I thought when she comes back, she might want to talk some more.",
        "Mike: All right. There's a trail she takes around the block. I'm gonna go check for her. All right, if she comes back, you call my cell?",
        "Carly: You got it. Ooh. Oh, Katie, you better work fast.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: This one is Nick's, the one that was found in his jacket. This one is Mike's.",
        "Jack: Where'd you find that?",
        "Katie: At home, in a box full of Mike's stuff from when he was a kid. This is the one with the DNA on it.",
        "Jack: There's a lot of those medals in circulation, Katie. That doesn't prove a thing.",
        "Katie: Well, I'll testify, Jack. I'll say that I found this at home with Mike's stuff.",
        "Jack: Even if a wife's testimony would hold weight, it doesn't change the forensics.",
        "Katie: The evidence doesn't say that it's definitely Mike's DNA. It says it's consistent with Mike's DNA.",
        "Jack: That's just because they tested a small sample.",
        "Katie: Or because it's not Mike, but a relative -- like a first cousin.",
        "Jack: Well, when did you decide that Nick was a bad guy?",
        "Katie: Well, I still don't want to believe it, Jack, but I know what I saw. This is Mike's medal. And I know how Nick's behaving.",
        "Jack: There's only one problem, Katie. Nick has an airtight alibi for August 29th, 1993.",
        "Katie: You're sure?",
        "Jack: Yeah. He was in a program called the wilderness journey. It was about 50 miles outside of Oakdale.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Jack: It was a treatment program for troubled teens, Katie. They're supervised night and day. The kid wouldn't have a way back to Oakdale even if he wanted it.",
        "Katie: So I guess I'm back to square one.",
        "Jack: I'm sorry. You really thought it was Nick?",
        "Katie: I hated to think it. But he is acting like a guilty man.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeweler: Yes, of course, I remember, Mr. Kasnoff. You brought in a lovely old St. Christopher. Nice, classic design, solid craftsmanship. We don't see that very often --",
        "Nick: Yeah, I don't see it at all! I'm sorry. I just want to know what happened to my property.",
        "Jeweler: I was just about to tell you. Your wife has it.",
        "Nick: My wife?",

        "Jennifer: Here, will you hold him a second? I have something in my shoe. Thank you.",
        "Dusty: Hey. You conking out on me? You feeling tired? 'Cause there's something else we need to settle.",
        "Jennifer: What's that?",
        "Dusty: Well, if he's gonna be calling me Dad, that's -- that's what I'll be, but I want to make it legal.",
        "Jennifer: You want to adopt Johnny?",
        "Dusty: Yeah. What?",
        "Jennifer: Do you know how many times that I have wanted you to be Johnny's father instead of Craig?",
        "Dusty: Well, let's make it true. And besides, I'm the only Dad he knows, so -- end of story.",
        "Jennifer: Oh! So is this how it's gonna be, hmm? You do amazing things and make me wonder how I'd ever lived without you.",
        "Dusty: Basically.",

        "Meg: Paul, don't tell me Emily pulled a fast one?",
        "Paul: No.",

        "Meg: You're free.",
        "Paul: I'm a single man. But that's not really fair, because, well, we weren't really married to begin with. So --",
        "Meg: Still, I mean, it's a relief. You're free to go.",
        "Paul: Yeah. Go, as in?",
        "Meg: As in leave. You know, what you said, that's why I'm here. We could go anywhere we want now together. Unless you've changed your mind?",
        "Paul: No. You just kind of caught me by surprise, that's all.",
        "Meg: Well, get used to it. Champagne?",
        "Paul: You sure this is what you want?",
        "Meg: I want to be with you, wherever that will take us. You know, I must be crazy, but you really got me hooked on this whole fiji idea. Is there really an islan where it could just be the two of us?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Just the two of us.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Come here. Listen, even if Paul all the sudden decided that he wanted the kid, what makes you think that Meg would sign up for that?",
        "Emily: Henry, of course she would, in a heartbeat. She was a nurse. Come on, she'd tell herself it was a mercy mission, that Paul's poor, innocent, little baby got stuck with a nut job for a mother. Oh, God, I can hear her now. She's gonna turn my own child against me. Henry, I just know it!",
        "Henry: No, that's not gonna happen! All these -- okay, these worst-case scenarios, it's just your mind running away from you. Why don't you focus on what you know for sure.",
        "Emily: I know that Jessica is working on the papers. That's what Paul said. But something about -- I just don't believe him. I have this instinct.",
        "Henry: Your instincts have been a little AWOL lately, right? Listen, you know what? Let's just chase this down, okay? Why don't you let Uncle Henry place a little phone call over to the law offices of Jessica Griffin and find out what's going on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Oh, boy, am I glad you're back.",
        "Katie: Wish I shared your enthusiasm.",
        "Carly: What happened?",
        "Katie: An alibi.",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Katie: I went to Jack with the other medal and my theory about the dna test, and he said that Nick has an airtight alibi for the day of the murder.",
        "Carly: So there's no way it's him?",
        "Katie: I guess not.",
        "Carly: Well, as much as I would love to help prove Mike innocent, I'm sort of glad to retire from the detective business. Oh, and you'd better be careful, because he's back.",
        "Katie: Who?",
        "Carly: Mike. He found me here.",
        "Katie: Oh, no!",
        "Carly: No, no, no. Don't worry, I covered for you. I told him that you needed a shoulder to cry on, and so you called me, and then you went out for a run.",
        "Katie: A run?",
        "Carly: Yeah, so he's out right now looking on your trail, or something. But don't worry, because if he asks you, just say that you went to the gym instead and that you showered there.",
        "Katie: Okay, got it.",
        "Carly: What? Well, don't look so down. It's a good cover. It'll work.",
        "Katie: This is exhausting.",
        "Carly: Yeah, that's true. And if you cleared Mike, it'd be worth it. I still can't believe that Nick is off the hook.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jeweler: Mrs. Kasnoff wanted to surprise you.",
        "Nick: She did?",
        "Jeweler: I delivered the medal to your house on my way home from work. So try to look surprised.",
        "Nick: Oh, I am.",
        "Jeweler: I mean, when she gives it to you.",
        "Nick: No, no, no, don't worry. I'll look very surprised. She won't suspect a thing.",

        "Jennifer: Well, he seems to be doing better.",
        "Dusty: He knows a great moment when he sees it.",

        "Dusty: You think so?",
        "Jennifer: Ah, he was smart enough to be born right when you could catch him.",
        "Dusty: So, you still got to go, or what?",
        "Jennifer: No. I want to stay right here, right in this moment.",
        "Dusty: It only gets better from here.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Paul, what's wrong?",
        "Paul: Nothing. I told you, you just kind of caught me off-guard. I didn't expect to see you, that's all.",
        "Meg: What happened to everybody's got to have a dream?",
        "Paul: I guess I started to wonder about what it would be like if I woke up. I made myself imagine what life would be like without you.",
        "Meg: How was that?",
        "Paul: It was empty. I'm really glad you're here.",
        "Meg: Well, then start looking like it. Here you go.",
        "Paul: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Meg: Was it rough with Emily?",
        "Paul: She didn't make any trouble.",
        "Meg: But it was still sad?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Meg: Well, her family will take care of her. You're free, Paul. You don't have to be responsible for her life anymore.",
        "Paul: No, I know. I know. I know. And you're here.",
        "Meg: Okay, a toast. To a new life, roaming the world together, you and I.",
        "Paul: To a new life together.",

        "Henry: Paul. He picked up the divorce and relinquishment papers this morning from Jessica.",
        "Emily: He had them both?!",
        "Henry: That's what the secretary said.",
        "Emily: Well, why did he lie to me about the papers? Why did he say he didn't have them?",
        "Henry: I don't know. I don't know, but we're gonna find out. And whatever Paul has up his sleeve, we're gonna stop him.",
