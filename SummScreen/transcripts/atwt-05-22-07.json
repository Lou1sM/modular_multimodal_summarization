        "Susan: So, is tomorrow night enough notice for dinner? And we could invite Alison to join us and make it a family celebration.",
        "Dusty: What happened to Alison, anyway?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lance: That's a cute outfit.",
        "Alison: What are you doing here, Lance?",
        "Lance: I was going to ask you the same thing, Baby. This place is a pit.",
        "Alison: It's a diner. And I needed a job.",
        "Lance: You actually work here?",
        "Alison: It's temporary. I told you, I was working out family issues.",
        "Lance: Geez, you're slumming it, Honey, and I need you back in Vegas. Hell, I need you period.",
        "Alison: Not now. I just started my shift.",
        "Lance: So quit. You don't belong in some greasy spoon. Plus, I'll have work that make much better use of your talents. And this outfit is giving me all kinds of ideas for new projects.",
        "Alison: I can't talk about this right now. I have to go. I have customers waiting.",
        "Lance: Well, in that case, just give me a table in your section.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I'm so relieved it's you, Madeline. I keep expecting the police.",
        "Maddie: Why? Are you in trouble?",
        "Vienna: Well, I may be out of trouble. If the necklace I was wearing when I woke up belongs the prince of Leonia.",
        "Maddie: Does that mean that he'll stop trying to get your money?",
        "Vienna: Well, if it is the crown jewels, there's nothing to sue me for.",
        "Maddie: Wow. So that means that you can be free?",
        "Vienna: I could. I could get my little jet back, and travel, and visit my friends. I could get my old life back.",
        "Maddie: But you don't really want that, do you? You don't want to leave Henry, right?",
        "Vienna: He doesn't care whether I stay or go.",
        "Maddie: Maybe he thinks that once you're free, you'll want to leave.",
        "Vienna: He knows better. He knows my heart. If he cared, if he really loved me, it wouldn't have been you knocking on that door, it would've been Henry.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: If Simon is responsible for slipping the jewels around Vienna's neck while she slept --",
        "Katie: Of course it was Simon. Who else do we know who can pick any lock in the world?",
        "Henry: Yeah, good point. And I'm pretty sure we can rule out easing his conscience.",
        "Katie: Why would he do it? Why would he risk getting caught?",
        "Henry: Well, I'm pretty sure he didn't do it to clear Vienna's name.",
        "Katie: You think this was for Carly?",
        "Henry: Yeah. If the jewels are returned, it can seriously cut down on the charges against her.",
        "Katie: Yeah, but not get rid of them completely.",
        "Henry: No, not get rid of them. But it may mean she can come back home. How do you think Jack would feel about that?",
        "Katie: I really don't think it would change things for him. Jack and Carly were divorced long before she ran off with Simon.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah, ending the marriage doesn't end the feelings, as you know very well.",
        "Katie: Yes, well, I paid a big price for that. I'm never going to open myself up to Simon again.",
        "Henry: Yeah, but this is different. Jack and Carly have children, they have to come in contact --",
        "Katie: Why are we even speculating about this? We don't know that Simon and Carly are back.",
        "Henry: Denial is not a river in Egypt.",
        "Katie: Wait, where was Jack when you talked to him? Was he at the police station?",
        "Henry: No, actually, he was on his way to Milltown to see a realtor about his house.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly.",
        "Carly: Hello, Jack. I didn't follow you here, if that's what you're thinking.",
        "Jack: I wasn't.",
        "Carly: Right. Why would you?",
        "Jack: You're back.",
        "Carly: Yes. I'm back.",
        "Jack: I've thought about all the things I would say to you if I ever saw you again. But, I can't remember a word.",
        "Carly: Maybe that's best, huh?",
        "Jack: You okay?",
        "Carly: That's tough to answer.",
        "Jack: Keep it simple. Yes or no.",
        "Carly: You know I don't do simple.",
        "Jack: You look -- good.",
        "Carly: So do you. You know, you're not the only one who's surprised that I'm here. I stopped believing this moment would ever happen.",
        "Jack: What changed?",
        "Carly: Everything, nothing. I realized that I couldn't split myself in two. It's good to see you, Jack. To be home. It's not as hard as it thought it would be.",
        "Jack: Stop, right there.",
        "Carly: I'm sorry. I don't mean to push. It's just being in this house.",
        "Jack: You weren't supposed to come back.",
        "Carly: I know. But staying away stopped being an option, Jack. I missed the kids so much it was killing me.",
        "Jack: Killing you? Well, at least you've got your priorities straight. Carly comes first. The rest of us are much further down the list.",
        "Carly: No, I didn't mean --",
        "Jack: How about the fact that you leaving nearly killed the kids? Did you think of that?",
        "Carly: Every day. Every minute.",
        "Jack: Not a note. Not so much as letter or an anonymous package, Carly. They felt abandoned. After all, if your own mother splits -- if she can't love you, who can, right?",
        "Carly: I love them more than anything.",
        "Jack: Yeah, that's why you chose your boyfriend over them.",
        "Carly: Oh God. God, Jack, I am so sorry.",
        "Jack: You don't get to be sorry. You get to be gone. You and Simon, you opted for a life on the run. How'd you rationalize that, anyway? Well, you -- just tell yourself that stealing from the rich wasn't actually a crime? Did you get to help yourself to whatever you wanted, it doesn't matter who got hurt?",
        "Carly: I guess I deserve that.",
        "Jack: Yeah. You walked out that door with Simon. And you did it because leaving him was harder than leaving your own kids.",
        "Carly: No. No, that's not --",
        "Jack: It is done, Carly! It is done! You think I'm going to let you drop in, trash our lives, and walk out again!",
        "Carly: That's not what I'm doing. I'm not leaving this time, Jack. I'm back for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, Jack is meeting with a realtor to sell his house? The same house that he shared with Carly. I think that's a pretty good sign that he's moving on.",
        "Henry: Yeah, maybe. Maybe he wants to stay out on the farm and he doesn't want to worry about the upkeep on two different places. Where are you going, Katie? Katie? Look, you're not planning on tracking down Jack at his old place, are you?",
        "Katie: Well, I'm not going to sit here and paint grim scenarios where I get kicked to the curb again.",
        "Henry: Honey, I am just trying to put a smidgen of reality into the situation --",
        "Katie: I know, but I'm not going to run from this because of something that hasn't happened yet.",
        "Henry: Okay, okay, calm down. I only bring it up because Vienna thought that you should know and be prepared in case you ran into him.",
        "Katie: Vienna's worried about me and Simon?",
        "Henry: Yes, she's -- the last time he passed through your life, it was a train wreck.",
        "Katie: I know. But I'm over him now. She's still having a problem with him?",
        "Henry: No, not anymore.",
        "Katie: Then why is she worried that my past is going to come back to haunt me?",
        "Henry: I don't know. Why are you being so defensive?",
        "Katie: Just be careful, Henry. I'm not hung up on some old love, but if Vienna thinks I am, it might be because she's still hung up on hers. I got to go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I don't want you to leave, Vienna. I finally feel like I have a sister again.",
        "Vienna: That's so sweet, Madeline. I wish we could be sisters forever.",
        "Maddie: I didn't mean to make you sad. Sorry. Actually, if it makes you feel any better, I came over for fashion tips.",
        "Vienna: Oh. Oh, you want my advice?",
        "Maddie: Yes, I do. I decided to go to the prom after all.",
        "Vienna: Aha, that's marvelous. So, did they let Casey out of prison so he could attend the party?",
        "Maddie: I wish. No, I'm going with my friend Luke. I figured even if Casey can't take me, I should go to my own prom. It's all a part of being a senior, so --",
        "Vienna: You know if Casey really loves you, he wouldn't want you to deprive yourself.",
        "Maddie: I know. That's what I thought. So, I got a dress, but I don't know what to do with accessories and shoes, and gloves, and a shawl -- I don't know if I need all of it --",
        "Vienna: No, we'll figure it all out. You are going to look so beautiful that Luke won't even be able to resist you.",
        "Maddie: Yeah, he will.",
        "Vienna: He will?",
        "Maddie: Well, the reason why Luke and I are teaming up is because neither of us can go with the guy that we want to be with.",
        "Vienna: I know that feeling all too well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Do you see who's in there? My sister.",
        "Lance: And the boyfriend. That guy that came with her to Vegas.",
        "Alison: Dusty's not her boyfriend.",
        "Lance: You know, I need to tell the two of them to leave you alone, back off.",
        "Alison: They're sitting with my mother.",
        "Lance: That's your mom? She's hot. Maybe why you and your sister turned out so good. But you know, Ali, Mommy can't tell you what to do anymore, all right? You need to tell your family they can't make you stay here.",
        "Alison: They're not making me do anything.",
        "Lance: I don't buy it. They must have something on you. Otherwise, why would you be here?",
        "Alison: Whatever they've done, it's because they want to help me.",
        "Lance: Do what? Just get old and burned out before you're 25? What's gotten into you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Susan: I don't care what you say, you're worried about her --",
        "Dusty: Susan --",
        "Susan: And I am too. The minute I saw her, I could tell that she wasn't feeling well.",
        "Dusty: She's fine.",
        "Susan: But then, why all the fuss?",
        "Dusty: I think Alison's been taking this job a little casually. And Emily got it for her, so Emily feels responsible.",
        "Susan: This isn't going to be career choice.",
        "Emily: She's not in the bathroom.",
        "Alison: Nothing's gotten into me. I'm the same as I've always been, which means I don't want to make any trouble with my family.",
        "Lance: They look pretty harmless.",
        "Alison: And none of them would give you the seal of approval.",
        "Lance: Yeah, that's nothing new.",
        "Alison: Come back in an hour. And they'll be gone by then, okay?",
        "Lance: All right, we'll play it your way. For now.",
        "Dusty: What's going on, Ali cat?",
        "Alison: Just getting some air.",
        "Dusty: He was here, wasn't he?",
        "Alison: So, what are you accusing me of now?",
        "Dusty: I saw you talking to someone.",
        "Alison: So what?",
        "Dusty: I told Jesse what would happen if he came near you again. Did he try to hook you up?",
        "Alison: It wasn't Jesse. It was just a customer. Okay? Do I pass inspection?",
        "Susan: Alison --",
        "Emily: Alison, where have you been? We were getting a little worried about you, sweetie.",
        "Dusty: It's all right. She just needed some air.",
        "Susan: Honey, are you sure you're feeling okay?",
        "Alison: Will you stop hovering, I'm fine.",
        "[Beeper goes off]",
        "Susan: Oh, that's mine. Oh, got to go. It's the ER. Okay, are we on for dinner tomorrow?",
        "Emily: Yeah, sure thing.",
        "Susan: Oh, good. Good. And since you're not working, I expect you to join us. I won't take no for an answer.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Susan: Okay. It's going to be so much fun. Okay, I'll make the reservation, and I'll let you know all the details.",
        "Emily: Okay, can't wait.",
        "Alison: And the condemned ate a hearty meal.",
        "Emily: Okay, wait one minute. Were you really outside getting air, Alison?",
        "Alison: God, Emily. Do you have to second guess everything I do?",
        "Diner Manager: Are you working or not, Alison?",
        "Alison: It turns out that I can't stay. I'm sorry, but I have to take off.",
        "Emily: What, why?",
        "Diner Manager: You told me you would cover for Leslie.",
        "Alison: I know you're in a bind, and I wish I could help, but I forgot I have an appointment to go to.",
        "Diner Manager: Beautiful, I'm down two.",
        "Emily: All right, whoa, whoa -- what appointment are you talking about, Alison?",
        "Alison: Detox doesn't take care of cravings, Em. Okay, sometimes I really need those meetings and now, is one of those times.",
        "Emily: Oh, okay, all right, you go. I understand.",
        "Alison: Thanks for taking the leash off. I'm going to go change out of my uniform.",
        "Emily: All right, all right.",
        "Dusty: You trust her to walk out of here? She's going to look for a fix.",
        "Emily: If that was the plan, why would she tell us she's leaving?",
        "Dusty: Because addicts always cover up the agenda, which is to score and get high.",
        "Emily: No, you saw her. You saw the torture she went through trying to clean. Why would she put herself through that again?",
        "Dusty: Because she's an addict. We're talking in circles.",
        "Alison: I forgot to ask, I need a favor.",
        "Dusty: If it's money, the answer's no.",
        "Alison: It's not, but thanks for the trust.",
        "Emily: What do you need, Alison?",
        "Alison: My meeting's in Old Town. And I was wondering if you guys would mind walking me over there?",
        "Emily: Not at all.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Maddie: I'll never forget you, Vienna. And I promise I will bring all of this back.",
        "Vienna: I'm being very sentimental. The police haven't even told me I'm free to go.",
        "Maddie: You do know that if you are free, you don't have to go, though.",
        "Vienna: No, I think I do. Staying here and knowing that Henry doesn't want me, that's torture.",
        "Maddie: I know. I understand. I do really think that he loves you.",
        "Vienna: I need to start packing. [Cell phone rings] Oh, it's my friend, Nicky. She wants me to spend the summer with her at the Aegean. It's her family's yacht.",
        "Maddie: Oh, that'll be nice. But take it, I have to go anyway. But please, promise me that you will say good bye if you end up leaving. Okay?",
        "Vienna: I will.",
        "Maddie: Thank you.",
        "Vienna: Hi, Nicky. I was going to call you.",
        "Maddie: Finally. What took you so long?",
        "Henry: What?",
        "Maddie: If you would have waiting any longer, Vienna would already be at the airport.",
        "Henry: What, she's leaving?",
        "Maddie: Yeah, isn't that why you're here? To stop her?",
        "Henry: No, I just came by to thank her for some advice she gave me about Katie.",
        "Maddie: Forget about Katie. Okay, you need to go in there and tell Vienna how much you love her, before you lose her for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Jack's not here.",
        "Katie: Actually, I was looking for you.",
        "Margo: Oh, wow. I guess the word got out that we have the crown jewels or something very much like them.",
        "Katie: Well, I did hear that the missing necklace mysteriously appeared around Vienna Hyatt's neck. Do you have any other details?",
        "Margo: We don't have Simon.",
        "Katie: Are you looking for him?",
        "Margo: There's an APB out on him and Carly.",
        "Katie: Good. Good, I hope you catch them and they end up in jail where they belong.",
        "Margo: Even if that involves a stop off here for arraignment, possible trial?",
        "Katie: It doesn't matter to me where they end up.",
        "Margo: Really? So having Simon and Carly here, in lockup, in this station, that's not going to bother you?",
        "Katie: No, it won't. Margo, my feelings for Simon were wiped out the last go- around.",
        "Margo: Well, good. Good, then why are you here? Why are you so curious about whether we brought them in?",
        "Katie: Well, I would like a little warning, if the two people that almost ruined me and Jack are back in town to drag us back into the past, just when we're about to take a step forward together.",
        "Margo: You think that's going to happen?",
        "Katie: I don't know. It doesn't have to. At least, not on my part. I mean, I know that if Simon came back here, I would steer clear of him. I just don't know what Jack will do. I mean, hopefully he won't let Carly try and destroy him and the kids again.",
        "Margo: Well, I would imagine if Carly came back, it's to make amends, don't you think?",
        "Katie: Forgiveness? For everything she's done, I don't think that's going to happen.",
        "Margo: But you don't know for sure.",
        "Katie: Well, I do know that Jack has done a lot to get over her. And if I were him, I would --",
        "Margo: Aha! But, my darling, you are not Jack. Don't get me wrong. You know I want nothing more than to have things to move on for you and Jack. But Honey, you can't close your eyes because something might happen that you don't want to see.",
        "Katie: Like what?",
        "Margo: Well, no matter how far Carly travels, no matter what she does, she's always going to be a part of Jack. And as much as he would like to forget about her, he's not going to. Not ever.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: You're planning on moving back here?",
        "Carly: I guess you didn't expect that.",
        "Jack: No. Not really.",
        "Carly: I've thought about it for awhile.",
        "Jack: And you decided this was possible, how? Carly, you're a wanted felon.",
        "Carly: Well, I know there are legal problems, issues --",
        "Jack: Oh, and you expect them to vanish? So you and Simon, you can set up household and have the kids over on weekends for popcorn and sleepover, is that it?",
        "Carly: I just know that I need to be with them.",
        "Jack: Right. And all Simon has to do is some slight of hand that leaves Vienna wearing a stolen necklace, and we're supposed to assume that the stolen crown jewels just miraculously reappeared, case solved.",
        "Carly: Is that how he did it?",
        "Jack: You didn't know?",
        "Carly: He promised me that he was going to fix things, but he didn't tell me how. So, I didn't know what the plan was until you just told me.",
        "Jack: And you expect me to believe that?",
        "Carly: It's the truth.",
        "Jack: Where is he, Carly? Is he hiding? Waiting for you to give him the all- clear?",
        "Carly: I don't know where he is. I haven't talked to him in a while.",
        "Jack: How am I supposed to believe that? You risked everything, Carly. You took a chance that you might spend the rest of your life in jail because you couldn't go a day without him.",
        "Carly: There's a reason that I don't know where he is.",
        "Jack: Right. And that reason is that he's afraid we'll pressure you into giving him up.",
        "Carly: No. Simon and I aren't together anymore. I came back alone.",
        "Jack: So what happened? Did Simon decide you were a liability? Or did he move on to a new partner in crime? Someone who's, maybe I don't know, a better fence?",
        "Carly: Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Jack, but we were actually fine together.",
        "Jack: Then what happened? Was being tied to one woman too much for him to handle?",
        "Carly: I left him, okay? I couldn't pretend to be somebody I wasn't. And Simon saw what it was doing to me. What being away from the children was doing to me, and so, finally he asked me if I would like to come back without him.",
        "Jack: He gave you permission to leave him? What a prince.",
        "Carly: This wasn't easy for anyone, Jack.",
        "Jack: You don't have to tell me that.",
        "Carly: Right. But he could see, that in so many ways, I'd just stopped living.",
        "Jack: No fun for him?",
        "Carly: He promised that he would make it right so I could come back.",
        "Jack: So, after practically destroying your life and the lives of our children, he still gets to be the hero.",
        "Carly: He returned the jewels to fix this for me.",
        "Jack: Yeah, unfortunately, there are some holes in his plan.",
        "Carly: Like what?",
        "Jack: Like he's still a thief and you're still an accessory. Come on, Carly, did you honestly think you'd be free to go back to playing Mommy to the kids you walked away from?",
        "Carly: Is that too much to hope for? I'm still their mother. They still love me.",
        "Jack: This is not going to end in joint custody. Or a welcome home party. This time you're going to face what you've done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: You're contradicting yourself here. On my wedding day, you didn't want me to marry her. You wanted me to wait for the right person and true love.",
        "Maddie: Well, right, but now I know that Vienna is the right person for you. You love her, Henry. You're just too afraid to admit it.",
        "Henry: I've given up on love. It's much easier that way.",
        "Maddie: Coward.",
        "Henry: Definitely.",
        "Maddie: So you're going to lose Vienna now because you don't want to lose her down the line? Does that make any sense?",

        "Maddie: No. You're wrong, okay? Because if you lose Vienna now, it's always going to hurt. I mean, look at me and Casey. Okay, we love each other, but we can't be together. Whereas, you and Vienna, in spite of everything, she still loves you. And there's a chance there. She still loves you and she's just waiting for you to come around. All you have to do is knock on the door.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and then apologize. And then, god knows what else.",

        "Dusty: Well, that's the upshot. The downside is your mother planning this engagement party for us.",
        "Emily: Oh, come on, it's not that bad. Okay, she's going there. And I don't know how to stop her.",
        "Dusty: Why don't we tell her the truth? You guys put a lot of energy into protecting your mother, huh?",
        "Emily: Yeah, we do. I know we do. And no matter how messed up things get for me or Ali, we know how important it is to keep my mother from one more disappointment. I think that's why Ali and I never really share anything with each other. Being alone is the best way to keep secrets, you know.",
        "Dusty: There's a problem with being alone, you get lonely.",
        "Emily: And when we did, when we did, we found comfort in the worst possible places. I can't give up on my sister. I mean, she's my little sister. And I have. I mean, when she left town with Aaron, I knew they weren't in a good place, and I just -- I ignored it. I acted like she fell off the face of the planet.",

        "Lance: Wait a minute, you're not knocked up, are you?",
        "Alison: No, but I'm cleaning up my act. Which means no more candy, no more dates with strangers, and no more movies. Which is why I can't see you and which is why you need to go back to Vegas.",

        "Luke: Yeah, but we are going the non-traditional route. Therefore, I insist on seeing your dress. And I bet you are going to look beautiful. And I bet that every single guy is going to wish he went with you. What? Did I say something wrong?",

        "Katie: So, it's a fake.",
        "Margo: No, no, not so fast. It was rebuilt by one of the best. The stones and most of the diamonds are from the crown jewels. So, to the naked eye, the difference is negligible. It certainly lets the prince save face, doesn't it?",

        "Carly: At the time, it seemed like the only choice I had.",
