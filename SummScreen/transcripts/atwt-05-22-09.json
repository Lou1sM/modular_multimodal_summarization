        "Vienna: Henry?",
        "Henry: Hey, hey, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: Hi.",
        "Henry: You were so still, I thought you were asleep.",
        "Vienna: What time is it?",
        "Henry: It is 4:00 in the afternoon.",
        "Vienna: It's so late.",
        "Henry: How do you feel? Do you want to get up?",
        "Vienna: No, no.",
        "Henry: Do you need, like, a pillow or anything? Do you hurt anymore?",
        "Vienna: Just my heart.",
        "Henry: My sweet baby.",
        "Vienna: There are no pills for losing a baby, are there?",
        "Henry: No. Maybe we could -- let's distract ourselves.",
        "Vienna: Distract ourselves.",
        "Henry: Yes. Let's put on some clothes, go out, and have just a great dinner. Have some champagne.",
        "Vienna: Henry, thank you for trying, but I'm sorry. It's just too soon for me. What's that?",
        "Henry: You don't need to think about that. I'll tell you about it later.",
        "Vienna: No. I want to know.",
        "Henry: While you were sleeping, I got the baby's things together, and I'm going to take them over to the hospital for the pediatrics department.",
        "Vienna: You're getting rid of them?",
        "Henry: Well, we don't need to live with these painful reminders, do we? I mean, got to get on with life.",
        "Vienna: I suppose.",
        "Henry: Hey, we were perfectly happy before you got pregnant, and there's no reason we can't be again.",
        "Vienna: Convince me.",
        "[Vienna laughs]",
        "Vienna: I guess you missed one.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Starving yourself is not gonna help Henry and Vienna.",
        "Katie: I just wish there was something we can do for them.",
        "Brad: There's nothing that you can do. Remember when we were going through it? We just needed time alone to be sad.",
        "Katie: That's it.",
        "Brad: What's it?",
        "Katie: The material my doctor gave me when I miscarried. I'm gonna take it over to Vienna.",
        "Brad: No. Bad idea.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: I wasn't hanging out in a bar getting loaded, Jack. I got into it with Parker, and some of the things he said to me -- I felt like I was gonna lose it, and I had a drink.",
        "Jack: In front of Parker.",
        "Carly: No, not in front of Parker.",
        "Jack: So, after Parker left, and after the argument was over, that's when you started drinking?",
        "Carly: Stop making it sound like I was getting sloshed! I didn't have that much! I told you I was upset! I was trying to calm down!",
        "Jack: Yeah, and Parker was upset, too, when he showed up at the counseling session. The counseling session you missed.",
        "Carly: I was on my way there when I was pulled over.",
        "Jack: Because you were driving drunk!",
        "Carly: I was not drunk!",
        "Jack: According to the breathalyzer, you were, Carly. Exactly how many drinks did you have?",
        "Craig: Remember, Carly, you have the right to remain silent.",
        "Jack: Craig, what are you doing in here? I asked you to stay out of this!",
        "Craig: I was prepared to do that until you started bullying your ex-wife, and that, Detective, you have no right to do.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: Okay, so, you're cooking for us, which means that you're not expecting my mom home in time for dinner.",
        "Janet: That just means I like to cook.",
        "Parker: She's been drinking.",
        "Janet: Parker, please. Wait, wait, wait. We don't know that for sure.",
        "Parker: Okay. Then, did you finish this bottle? 'Cause I didn't.",
        "Janet: No.",
        "Parker: Then she's drunk, okay? Do you know where she is? She's probably sleeping it off somewhere.",
        "Janet: I honestly don't know where she is.",
        "Sage: I'm home. Tara's mom dropped me off.",
        "Janet: Don't say anything.",
        "Parker: Why not? She's not stupid. We have to tell her the truth. We're in here, Sage.",
        "Janet: Parker, please, don't.",
        "Sage: Why are you here? Where's Mom? What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Unless you want me to tell your boss that Carly needs to be processed by an officer with a degree of objectivity, you need to dial it down.",
        "Jack: Facts are facts, Craig!",
        "Craig: You can either be her ex-husband or the officer investigating the case. What's it gonna be?",
        "Jack: While you're waiting to be arraigned, you can sober up in lockup.",
        "Carly: You got to be kidding me!",
        "Jack: O'Neal.",
        "O'Neal: What do you need, Jack?",
        "Jack: Take Ms. Tenney down to lockup.",
        "Carly: Oh, don't do this. Oh, come on. Jack, don't do this! Help me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Do you remember when we lost our baby? You didn't want to see or talk to anyone.",
        "Katie: We know exactly what they're going through and how hard it is, how much it hurts. We can't just stand by and do nothing.",
        "Brad: Okay, okay, okay. All right. All right. Help them from a distance. Send them an e-mail.",
        "Katie: What do I say?",
        "Brad: That if there's anything that we can do, we're here for you.",
        "Katie: Okay. I guess it's better than nothing, and maybe some of this material is online so I can link it to the e-mail.",
        "Brad: Great, great. You want me to fix you something else to eat?",
        "Katie: Yeah, soup. Oh, my laptop's not here.",
        "Brad: What, did you leave it in the car?",
        "Katie: No. I left it at work, and I really don't want to go there and answer questions about what happened.",
        "Brad: I'll go.",
        "Katie: Would you?",
        "Brad: Yeah, I'll go. You leave it in your office?",
        "Katie: On my desk.",
        "Brad: Okay. I'll be right back. Don't even think about eating my sandwich.",
        "Katie: It'll be here when you return.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Well, it's official. I'm as depressed as you are.",
        "Vienna: That's a relief.",
        "Henry: It's a relief?",
        "Vienna: When I saw you packed everything up, I felt like you couldn't wait to forget.",
        "Henry: No. I just thought if I -- I thought if I acted okay, I'd be okay.",
        "Vienna: Doesn't always work like that.",
        "Henry: No. There's not really an alternative, is there?",
        "Vienna: Well, we'll give ourselves some time, and then, little by little, we'll find a way to deal with what happened.",
        "Henry: You want to talk about it?",
        "Vienna: Oh, Henry.",
        "Henry: I don't understand what's the matter with me. Before, I couldn't live with a baby, and now I can't live without one. I never met Sven or Inga. I don't know why I should be so concerned about this bundle that I've never held in my hands.",
        "Vienna: I don't know, but we just do. Why don't we just hold each other and keep talking for a while?",
        "Henry: I need to get these out of here so I can think. I'll be back soon.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Oh, come on! What, is it illegal for your stepmom to come over and cook you dinner or something?",
        "Sage: Parker, what's really going on? Where is Mom?",
        "Parker: She's got some stuff to do. It's typical. But there's an upside. We get to eat lasagna.",
        "Sage: Well, it does smell good.",
        "Janet: Are you hungry?",
        "Sage: I'm starving.",
        "Janet: Go wash up. Thank you for not saying anything.",
        "Parker: She's just a kid. She shouldn't have to worry about Mom.",
        "Janet: She's lucky to have an older brother that protects her.",
        "Parker: Yeah. I just wish my mom thought that way, too. But, no. No. Nothing's gonna stand in her way of having a good time, not even her kids.",
        "Janet: Sweetie, she's just going through some problems right now.",
        "Parker: No. Her only problem is that she's a drunk with lousy taste in men.",
        "Janet: Hey! It's not always about you, Parker. Your mother isn't just your mother. She's a human being. Can't you try and have a little compassion for her?",
        "Parker: Well, how about you stop trying to act like my mother in her place.",
        "Janet: Oh, you better be damn glad I am not your mother.",
        "Parker: Why?",
        "Janet: Because if I were your mother, there is no way I would put up with that crappy attitude!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Thank you.",
        "Margo: She's allowed visitors, but she goes back to the cell when you two are done.",
        "Carly: So, where's Jack?",
        "Craig: Haven't seen him since they took you to lockup.",
        "Carly: Well, good. Let's get me out of here before he comes back.",
        "Craig: How do you propose I do that, Carly?",
        "Carly: Call a lawyer. Pull some strings.",
        "Craig: And then what?",
        "Carly: Well, then I get out of that disgusting cell, and I go home to my children in my own bed.",
        "Craig: Carly, we need to talk.",
        "Carly: Talk? Talk about what? I don't belong here! You know that!",
        "Craig: Do I?",
        "Carly: I am not a drunk, and Jack is on some insane power trip making me stay here.",
        "Craig: I kind of see Jack's point.",
        "Carly: What? You know that I don't belong in jail!",
        "Craig: I also know you don't belong on the road.",
        "Carly: Okay. I should not have gotten behind the wheel. I know that. But I told you, I got in to it with Parker, and it set me off.",
        "Craig: You also told me that you can stop drinking anytime.",
        "Carly: I can! I will. I was just taken off guard today. I wasn't ready.",
        "Craig: Carly, there's always an excuse. There's always someone to blame. It's Jack, its Parker, or the cop that pulled you over.",
        "Craig: Have a drink?",
        "Carly: I wasn't gonna say that. I can stop. When I'm ready.",
        "Craig: You have to face this, Carly. You're never gonna be ready. You're not gonna stop drinking until you get professional help.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Carly's sobering up in the drunk tank.",
        "Janet: Oh, I figured.",
        "Jack: Why?",
        "Janet: Okay. Don't get mad.",
        "Jack: That's not a good way to start.",
        "Janet: When you called me from the therapist's office and asked me to come check on Carly, I came here, she wasn't home, and then Craig showed up.",
        "Jack: Craig was here?",
        "Janet: Yes, and it's a good thing that he was here because he let us in with his extra key, and that's when we came inside and we saw an empty bottle of vodka on the kitchen counter.",
        "Jack: Why didn't you call and tell me that?",
        "Janet: I was going to, but Craig asked me to just keep quiet just for a few minutes, just until he could call Carly and find out what really happened.",
        "Jack: Wait a second. Wait a second. Since when do you take orders from Craig Montgomery?",
        "Janet: It wasn't an order. It was a favor.",
        "Jack: So, you just blindly do whatever he says without giving it a second thought?",
        "Janet: Just for a little while. It was just 15 minutes.",
        "Jack: What else are you keeping from me, Janet? Because you knew I was there. You knew I was waiting to hear what was going on with Carly.",
        "Janet: I know how crazed you get when she messes up. I didn't think it was a big deal.",
        "Jack: It is a big deal. You know exactly how I feel about Craig Montgomery, and you took his side over me. I guess I know where your loyalties lie. Where are you going? Where are you going?",
        "Janet: I just got on your kid about that mouth of his. It is disrespectful the way he talks to people! Now I know where he gets it! I wasn't being disloyal, Jack. I would call it understanding.",
        "Jack: Of Craig?",
        "Janet: No. Of Carly. I didn't know what happened for sure. I didn't know if she'd taken that bottle of vodka and dumped it down the sink. I didn't know if she was just having a bad day.",
        "Jack: Well, what were your instincts telling you?",
        "Janet: That she was drunk somewhere. I was just trying to give her the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Jack: Right, and you didn't think I would. That's why you didn't tell me.",
        "Janet: It was a lousy 15 minutes. I didn't think it was too much to ask, and I certainly didn't think it would put my marriage on the line.",
        "Jack: It didn't. Stop. It just put me in a foul mood.",
        "Janet: Well, get over it, Jack. Get over it! Come on. Stop taking it out on me. I'm not the problem here. I'm not the one that got Carly drunk.",
        "Jack: I'll get over it as soon as you get over withholding information from me, okay? Next time, please don't.",
        "Janet: Well, if there is a next time, I'm gonna do what I feel is right, just like I did today.",
        "Jack: It's just that everything is spinning out of control, Janet. First Parker, now Carly. I don't know what to do!",
        "Janet: I know, baby. I know. We'll figure it out, okay? We'll figure it out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I have some questions.",
        "Carly: No. I don't want to talk any more. I don't want to answer any more questions. I want to go home.",
        "Craig: Fine, don't let me stop you.",
        "Carly: What is it you'd like to know?",
        "Craig: You ever thought about cutting back your drinking?",
        "Carly: You know I have. I've thought about it a lot. Anything else?",
        "Craig: You ever been annoyed by people who criticize your drinking?",
        "Carly: Yes.",
        "Craig: You ever felt guilty about your drinking habits?",
        "Carly: I suppose so. Is there a point here?",
        "Craig: Have you ever had trouble remembering what you did when you were drinking?",
        "Carly: Well, who hasn't, really? Where are you getting these questions, anyway?",
        "Craig: I did some research. It turns out if you answer yes to just one of these questions, you could have a problem, but if you answer yes to two or more, you definitely have a problem.",
        "Carly: Okay, wait. Whoa. If you are calling me an alcoholic, you're out of your mind.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Is Henry here?",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. He's not here.",
        "Katie: How are you doing?",
        "Vienna: I keep holding my breath. Did you do that after you lost your baby?",
        "Katie: I cried a lot.",
        "Vienna: When the baby was inside of me, sometimes I just kept myself so quiet, so still, and I could feel the tiniest little movement, and in my head, I pictured the small hands just reaching and the tiny, little toes curling.",
        "Katie: So you keep holding your breath.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, I just want it to come back 'cause I can't believe it's gone.",
        "Katie: I'm so sorry, Vienna.",
        "Vienna: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry for what Henry said, and in spite of it, this wasn't your fault, Katie.",
        "Katie: If I didn't walk away from you, you wouldn't have fallen. I'm so sorry.",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. No. This could have happened outside on the curb, or even here alone. You wouldn't have been here to take care of me and hold me.",
        "Katie: So you forgive me.",
        "Vienna: There's nothing to forgive. Nothing. Life works in mysterious ways.",
        "Katie: But it's so hard to accept, I know. Especially when you started dreaming about what it'll be like to feed your baby, rock him to sleep.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, first words, first steps. How did you get through it?",
        "Katie: I don't know. My doctor gave me these, actually. I wanted to share them with you.",
        "Vienna: Did they help?",
        "Katie: This one did especially.",
        "Vienna: You had a memorial for your baby?",
        "Katie: It was nothing formal, just Brad and me, we just needed a chance to grieve and say out loud how much we loved our baby.",
        "Vienna: Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Hey.",
        "Brad: Hey.",
        "Henry: I'm looking for Kim.",
        "Brad: She's on location, shooting a remote. Why do you need Kim?",
        "Henry: I want to give her a heads-up.",
        "Brad: About?",
        "Henry: I plan on suing the station for what happened to Vienna.",
        "Brad: That's crazy.",
        "Henry: While I'm at it, I'm gonna sue Katie, as well.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: I knew about your father, so I should have known that this could happen to you. I never should have pushed you to come in to the vodka business with me.",
        "Carly: Feeling guilty, are we?",
        "Craig: An emotion I am decidedly unfamiliar with, but, yes, I am feeling a little blameworthy right now.",
        "Carly: Blameworthy enough to get me out of here?",
        "Craig: Maybe. If you admit you have a problem.",
        "[Carly growls]",
        "Carly: I admit that I have a bad habit which could become a problem if I'm not careful.",
        "Craig: You just don't get it.",
        "Carly: No, I do. I do get it, and I know that I have to wean myself away from something that's gotten a little out of control. I also know that I will never be anywhere close to being an alcoholic.",
        "Craig: Carly, you already are an alcoholic!",
        "Carly: Don't call me that!",
        "Craig: Wake up! You got arrested!",
        "Carly: I know, and it did wake me up! It worked! It worked!",
        "Craig: I so want to believe you.",
        "Carly: Follow that instinct. Now will you please call a lawyer, pay a fine, or do whatever you have to do to get me out of here?",
        "Craig: No. I won't. I'm not asking much, just a promise.",
        "Carly: I promise. Can we go now?",
        "Craig: I'm serious, Carly. Promise me you'll get help.",
        "Carly: Okay. I will.",
        "Craig: You'll go to A.A.?",
        "Carly: What? And share my personal business with a bunch of drunks? Hardly.",
        "Craig: You just told me that you'd get help.",
        "Carly: I will go and see a psychologist.",
        "Craig: You're better off with an alcohol-treatment program, and if you're convicted of a D.U.I., they're just gonna make you go anyway. So why don't you start now?",
        "Carly: Because it's not necessary, Craig. Now, I told you that I would go to therapy, and that's gonna have to be good enough, okay? So please call whoever you have to call so I can go home to my kids.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Why don't we get the kids to pack a couple bags? Let's take them back to the farm with us.",
        "Jack: You sure?",
        "Janet: That's what you want to do, isn't it?",
        "Jack: Well, I sure as hell don't want to leave them alone with Carly right now.",
        "Janet: You can't, not if she's drinking. It'd be dangerous.",
        "Jack: Well, what about Liberty? Are you okay with Parker and Liberty being in the same house?",
        "Janet: We'll deal with it, okay? And if Liberty gets uncomfortable, we'll just ship her off to her dad's for a couple of days.",
        "Jack: Thank you. Thank you for doing this for me.",
        "Janet: It's for us, Baby. For our family. I love your kids. Most of the time.",
        "Sage: That lasagna was good.",
        "Janet: There's more where that came from.",
        "Jack: Hey, what do you guys think about packing up a couple of bags and coming out to the farm and hanging out with us for a couple of days?",
        "Sage: Why?",
        "Jack: I need a reason to hang out with my kids?",
        "Sage: What about Mom?",
        "Jack: She needs some time to herself.",
        "Janet: Sage, why don't I help you pack your bag? Here. Daddy, grab that. Thank you.",
        "Jack: What is it, Parker?",
        "Parker: Is Mom hurt? Is she in the hospital?",
        "Jack: No. She's fine.",
        "Parker: Is she in jail? Don't worry. Sage asks me, I'll lie. I'm getting pretty good at it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Something precious was taken from Vienna and me, and that needs to be acknowledged.",
        "Brad: It has been. Katie and I, we feel horrible about what happened. I mean, our hearts go out to you.",
        "Henry: That's supposed to make it better?",
        "Brad: No. No, Henry. But, you know, the baby that Vienna was carrying around, we thought that that was our baby.",
        "Henry: Yeah, I know. And when you found out that wasn't the case, you almost took my head off.",
        "Brad: I know. I did. I'm sorry. I freaked out. I was angry that Katie was hurting.",
        "Henry: She wasn't just hurting, Brad. She was furious and jealous, and that's when Vienna fell, and that's when we lost the baby, and somebody has to pay for that.",
        "Brad: You're an idiot. You know that?",
        "Henry: Why? Why, because I want to hold Katie accountable? Is that why?",
        "Brad: Because you think that when we found out that baby wasn't ours, our feelings just got cut off and we stopped caring. We love that baby, too, and you want Katie to pay, she's paying every minute of every day. A child that she thought was hers died. If you don't think that she cares about it, then shame on you for ever calling yourself her friend.",

        "Vienna: I want to have a ceremony for my baby. I want to have it today.",
        "Katie: I think that's great.",
        "Vienna: Yes. Thank you for suggesting it.",
        "Katie: Okay. I'll just leave this stuff for you.",
        "Vienna: Thank you. Are you okay?",
        "Katie: I don't know how to say this. Your baby, I thought of as mine for so long. I mean, I don't have any right to ask.",
        "Vienna: I know. You want to be a part of the ceremony.",
        "Katie: Only if you would want me there. If you don't, Vienna, I totally understand.",
        "Vienna: We have a saying in Sweden, \"Where there's a place for hearts, there's a place for bottoms.\"",
        "Katie: What does that mean?",
        "Vienna: It means that where there's love, there's space. Thank you for loving my baby. I'd love for you to be there.",
        "Katie: Okay. Okay. Where do you want to do it? Do you want to go to the church? I could talk to the pastor.",
        "Vienna: No, no. I think we should do it in the park by the water. By the water. I'm just gonna get changed, and then I'm gonna call Henry.",
        "Katie: Okay. Is there anything I could bring?",
        "Vienna: I'll get the flowers, but could you --",
        "Katie: How would white ones be?",
        "Vienna: Perfect. Perfect.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Vienna: I'll see you at the park.",

        "Craig: Just remember your promise.",
        "Carly: Like you'd let me forget. Parker, Sage?",
        "Craig: Guess no one's home.",
        "Carly: The lights are all on. Maybe they had dinner at the Lebos'. Do you smell that?",
        "Craig: Smell what?",
        "Carly: Lasagna.",
        "Craig: Oh, didn't I tell you Janet was here when I got your message?",
        "Carly: No, you didn't tell me Janet was here when you got my message.",
        "Craig: Sorry.",
        "Carly: Here, in my house? Oh, yes. She was here. She cooked. She cleaned.",
        "Craig: She left a note.",
        "Carly: No, that's from Jack.",
        "Craig: What's it say?",
        "Carly: He took the kids to the farm.",
        "Craig: Great, then they're well taken care of. You want to go ahead and get something to eat?",
        "Carly: No. No wonder he wasn't there when you bailed me out. He was too busy stealing my kids.",
        "Craig: I'm sure he's just planning to keep them overnight.",
        "Carly: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He threw me in the drunk tank. This isn't a sleepover. Jack is staking his claim. Come on. Let's go.",
        "Craig: Where?",
        "Carly: We have to go to the farm right now and get my kids back!",

        "Henry: This is for everything I wanted to teach you. Good things.",
        "Vienna: And then we give a thank you. Thank you for letting me be your mother for a little while. I will love you my whole life.",
        "Henry: Thank you for asking me to be your dad. I wish I'd been better at it.",
        "Katie: Hey.",
        "Vienna: Katie.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I saw you with the flowers. I didn't want to interrupt.",

        "Henry: What's with the balloons? You think this is a party or something?",
        "Vienna: Henry.",
        "Katie: They're supposed to -- they represent the baby's spirit.",
        "Vienna: And we're supposed to release them into the air.",

        "Craig: Carly, it's one night.",
        "Carly: No, it isn't. This is Jack we're talking about. He was so angry. I need to talk to him. I need to see him and prove to him that I'm okay now.",
        "Craig: No, no, no. Maybe you should just give him a little time to calm down, and maybe you should take some time to prepare.",
        "Carly: For what?",
        "Craig: Your kids are gonna have questions. Have you thought about what you're gonna tell them?",
        "Carly: I'll tell them the same thing I told Jack, that an overzealous policeman pulled me over.",
        "Craig: And are you gonna tell them that you were drinking? Because if you don't, Jack certainly will.",
        "Carly: I will tell them that I had a drink and I shouldn't have.",
        "Craig: What about the part that you have an ongoing problem that you need to take care of?",
        "Carly: I'll tell them whatever I have to tell them.",
        "Craig: Oh, you mean like you did with me. Carly, did you mean anything you said back at the station?",
        "Carly: Of course I did. Yes, I did. I just don't have time to argue with you right now. I can't think about anything but my kids. I can't get myself together if they're not here. I can't do anything if they're not home with me! Now would you take me to the farm? Okay. I'll call a cab.",

        "Henry: What do you expect me to say to that?",
        "Vienna: That you forgive her. It wasn't that long ago since you and I asked Katie and Brad for forgiveness.",
        "Henry: Yeah, and they didn't give it to us.",
        "Katie: And I was wrong. I was just hurt. I was too hurt to realize that we are friends -- best friends.",
        "Henry: Not anymore.",
        "Vienna: How can you say that?",
        "Katie: It's okay. Its okay, Vienna. I understand. I've been there. Here. Say good-bye to the baby for me.",
        "Vienna: How can you blame Katie and not me?",
        "Henry: It's not your fault.",
        "Vienna: She didn't trip me. I fell. It's not her fault. It was my fault. It was an accident. It happened. You said it yourself, we have to let it go.",
        "Henry: That doesn't mean I can do that.",
        "Vienna: Let it go, Henry. Let go of the pain and the sorrow. That's not how we want to remember our baby, okay? You remember all our dreams and our hopes? Think about how happy we were and let the rest go with love.",

        "Carly: No, I'm good. Jack. I know that I made a mistake, a big mistake, and I'm sorry. I want my kids back.",
        "Jack: You keep apologizing, Carly, but you keep drinking. So where does this stop?",
        "Carly: Now. Here and now. As a matter of fact, I've decided to go to A.A. isn't that right, Craig?",
        "Craig: Yes. We've discussed it at length.",
        "Carly: And I mean it, Jack. I really mean it this time.",
        "Jack: I just need time to think.",
        "Janet: The kids are already settled upstairs. Maybe they should just stay.",
        "Sage: Mom!",
        "Carly: Hi! Hi, Sweetie.",
        "Sage: I thought I heard you. What happened to you?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Tell us.",
        "Carly: Well, I had too much to drink, and then I got in the car.",
        "Sage: You're not supposed to do that, ever.",
        "Carly: I know. You're absolutely right. But I got lucky, and a policeman pulled me over, and he brought me to the station, and that's where I've been all this time. It was so stupid and wrong, and I am never going to do it again. I promise you that.",
        "Sage: Good. So, can we go home with you? Daddy doesn't mind. Do you?",
        "Jack: I'd rather you stay here for a few more days.",
        "Sage: But I don't have all my stuff here, and I forgot to bring the blue shirt that I have to wear tomorrow. Why can't we just go home with Mom?",
        "Jack: I'm trusting you.",
        "Carly: You won't regret it.",
        "Jack: Call me after school, okay, Honey?",
        "Sage: I will. Come on. Let's go get our stuff.",

        "Brad: Hey, I just got your message. I mean, I'm sorry I couldn't be there. How did it go?",
        "Katie: I couldn't stay. Henry didn't want me there. He hates me.",
        "Brad: No, no. Henry does not hate you.",
        "Katie: Brad, he hates me.",
        "Brad: Okay. He may hate you right now, but he will get over it.",
        "Katie: When?",
        "Brad: What did he say?",
        "Katie: That he doesn't want to see me or talk to me.",
        "Brad: That's it?",
        "Katie: Isn't that bad enough? Oh, I feel worse than I did before. I got to go lie down.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: I feel a little better now. Don't you?",
        "Henry: No, not really.",
        "Vienna: Yeah, but do you know why you don't feel better? Because you've lost enough without even losing your best friend.",
        "Henry: Well, I'm sorry. I just -- every time I see Katie and Brad, I just think about the child that we're not gonna have.",
        "Vienna: Not necessarily.",
        "Henry: What do you mean?",
        "Vienna: I know this is too soon to even talk about, but we got pregnant very easily. We can do it again.",
        "Henry: No, no.",
        "Vienna: I thought you wanted a baby, that you were not afraid anymore.",
        "Henry: No. I didn't want to have a child before because I thought it would be a big hassle that I couldn't deal with, but I figured out the untold truth.",
        "Vienna: Children are a blessing?",
        "Henry: That having a child is to live in fear, and to lose a child is to live in pain, and that I'm -- I'm too much of a coward to do that. I'm sorry. No more kids. I'm sorry, Vienna. I can't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: I just hope I did the right thing, letting them go home with Carly.",
        "Janet: For all her faults, she loves those kids more than anything, and getting arrested tonight probably scared her to death, huh? Things will turn around.",
        "Jack: I hope so.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Okay. Why don't you go on upstairs and start your homework, and I'll be up in a few minutes, okay?",
        "Sage: Okay.",
        "Carly: Parker, it's not gonna happen again. I promise.",
        "Parker: I've heard that before.",
        "Carly: I hate to have Parker so down on me.",
        "Craig: Then prove him wrong.",
        "Carly: How?",
        "Craig: By actually going to A.A.",
        "Carly: Me at an A.A. meeting. Never saw that one coming.",
        "Craig: Did you mean it, though, Carly? Are you really gonna go?",
        "Carly: I'll give it a try. So, shouldn't you be getting home to Johnny?",
        "Craig: Oh, my son has a previous commitment.",
        "Carly: He's 5.",
        "Craig: Yes, and being my son, he is predicatively very popular. He has a sleepover with a friend from school tonight at my place.",
        "Carly: Oh. You want to miss that?",
        "Craig: I know. The running, the tussling, the screaming. It's a sacrifice. But I'm afraid Johnny's babysitter is going to have to have all the fun because I'll be spending the night on this lumpy thing you call furniture.",
        "Carly: And why will you be sleeping on my couch?",
        "Craig: To protect you from things that go bump in the night.",
        "Carly: Like wanting a drink.",
        "Craig: I'm here for you, baby.",
        "Carly: I'll go to a meeting tomorrow, okay? I made a promise to my kids. I intend to keep it.",
        "Craig: I'll remind you of that in the morning.",
        "Carly: You assume I'll need reminding.",
        "Craig: I know you will.",
        "Carly: You are so annoying.",
        "Craig: So you keep telling me.",
        "[Carly laughs]",
        "Carly: Okay. Well, I'm gonna go upstairs, and I'm gonna wash this awful day off of me. Hey. Thank you for everything you did today.",
        "Craig: No problem. Now go kiss your kids and get some rest.",
