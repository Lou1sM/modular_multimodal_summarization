        "Mrs. Krebs: Yes, I was. ",
        "John: Did you happen to see or talk to Dr. Hughes at all that day? Did \r\nhe\r\nseem to be acting in any kind of unnatural way before or after he lost his\r\npatients? Try to remember. It's very, very important. Did he seem confused\r\nor disoriented to you? ",
        "Mrs. Krebs: I'm sorry, I worked Pediatrics that day. I don't remember\r\n\r\nseeing Dr. Hughes. ",

        "Craig: Houdini was child's play compared to what this trick cost me.\r\n",
        "Sierra: Yeah, I spoke to Rosanna. She filled me in about the selling of\r\n\r\nMonte Carlo to Barbara. ",

        "Sierra: Good for you. But how about for Rosanna? ",
        "Craig: I told her Monte Carlo was just a shell, and I didn't want \r\nanybody\r\nelse to go down with me. She agreed. ",
        "Sierra: I think you're leaving out the best part. ",
        "Craig: Rosanna didn't spare any details, huh? ",
        "Sierra: Not a one. ",
        "Craig: Are the walls closing in around me or is it just me? ",

        "Craig: Aaron Snyder is no bargain. ",
        "Sierra: You know, this isn't about Aaron. This is about Rosanna and you\r\n\r\nletting her know that you love her and respect her. You need to tell her that\r\n\r\nshe was right. Look, she -- she was willing to sell Monte Carlo for basically\r\n\r\nnothing just because you asked her to. So maybe, just maybe, you need to put\r\naside your stubborn pride to get a second chance with your wife. ",

And he was -- he was mean. It was like the life was\r\ntaken out of him right there -- right there, that very moment. ",
        "Dusty: He was hurt. ",
        "Rose: Yeah. Because of something I did to him. And something you did\r\n\r\nto him. That we both did to him. He's dead because two people that he loved\r\nand trusted the most broke his heart. ",
