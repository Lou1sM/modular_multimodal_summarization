        "Katie finds out Nick is on to her when she goes back to the jewelry store to return the necklace. Nick tells Mike about what Katie did; he tells Mike he thinks that Carly is corrupting Katie. Mike promises to get to the bottom of it. Mike and Katie fight about the methods she chose to use to find out about Nick and his connection to Mike's case. Katie promises she is done playing detective, plus she found out from Jack that Nick had a solid alibi because he was at the Wilderness Treatment Program for Troubled Teens during that block of time the murder took place. Something looks to be bothering Mike after she says this, but he keeps it to himself; he later calls his brother Mark to ask him a question about Nick's time at the treatment center. Will has reservations about turning in a bought term paper; Jade talks him down. Gwen shows up with Will's Biology teacher wanting to talk to him about his extra credit paper. Will is ready to confess when the teacher commends him on a job well done. Gwen thanks Jade for helping her husband research his paper. Maddie is upset again about her and Casey's relationship; Gwen counsels her. Later, Jade offers to get Will the answers to his Calculus exam. Meg is ready to sail into the sunset with Paul, or at least to the Fiji Islands. Paul cannot bring himself to tell Meg about not giving Emily the papers relinquishing his parental rights. Imagine his horror when she finds out from Henry. Meg is furious and punches Paul in the stomach, who is pleading with her not to leave him. She is devastated after everything he lied to her. He tries to explain he was trying to figure things out in his head before he told her. She thinks he was trying to figure out a way to ask her to help him raise his and Emily's child. Paul wonders if it wouldn't be that bad of an idea to raise a child together if he decided to go that route? Meg doesn't think she could raise his child with Emily. Henry reports back to Emily that they had a successful mission. He spilled the beans in front of Meg who knew nothing. Emily is excited because she feels Paul will have to make a choice, and for once she hopes and believes he will pick Meg."

        "Mike: Hey, what's up with all the cloak and dagger stuff? Why couldn't we just meet at home?",
        "Nick: Because I didn't want to run a chance of Katie being there.",
        "Mike: Would that be a problem?",
        "Nick: Yeah. Look, Mike, this isn't gonna be easy for you to hear.",
        "Mike: What's Katie done?",
        "Nick: Remember this morning when you told me I'd always be welcome in your house? And she chimed right in?",
        "Mike: Yeah, right before we left to go fishing.",
        "Nick: Yeah, well, she didn't mean it, Mike. It was a lie.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Hi.",
        "Jeweler: Mrs. Kasnoff, it's good to see you again.",
        "Katie: Oh, you remember me. Excellent. Listen, I have decided not to surprise my husband after all. I think it'll just be best if he comes and picks this up himself, like he originally planned. And I would appreciate it if you didn't tell him that I had you drop it off at the house.",
        "Jeweler: I'm afraid it's too late for that. Your husband already knows.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: There you are.",
        "Jade: Hey, Will, what's up?",
        "Will: I'm freaking out about the paper.",
        "Jade: Why?",
        "Will: Because it's, like, stolen.",
        "Jade: It's not stolen. You bought it off the web.",
        "Will: Yeah, but it's cheating. What if I get caught?",
        "Jade: How would that happen?",
        "Will: I don't know. Glick reads it and he figures out that it's not mine. Or he reads and remembers it from someone else who had the same bright idea.",
        "Jade: Listen, the only way that people end up getting caught is they get nervous and start second-guessing themselves.",
        "Will: I can't believe I let you talk me into this.",
        "Jade: Wait a minute. So this is my fault? If you're so worried about getting in trouble, then don't hand it in.",
        "Will: It's too late. I already did.",
        "Jade: Okay, so, it's out of your hands. What's the problem?",
        "Will: Because if I get caught, then I'll get expelled and I won't graduate. And Gwen's never gonna forgive me.",
        "Jade: I don't know what to tell you, Will. If you can't pay the time, don't do the crime.",
        "Will: Those your words to live by?",
        "Jade: Look, you changed some things, right? You cut some stuff. You added some stuff.",
        "Will: Yeah.",
        "Jade: Okay, so relax. No one's gonna know you didn't write it.",
        "Gwen: Hey, Will, you're never gonna believe this. But guess who showed up looking for you.",
        "Mr. Glick: Mr. Munson --",
        "Will: Hey, Mr. Glick.",
        "Mr. Glick: I wanted to talk you about this extra credit paper you turned in.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What do you mean, \"We'll stop Paul?\" You mean you and me, together?",
        "Henry: Yeah, that's what I mean.",
        "Emily: You're offering to help me?",
        "Henry: That I am.",
        "Emily: The police have your money, you know that. I mean, I have no control over what happens to your money.",
        "Henry: Emily, will you -- shh, I'm not talking about the money.",
        "Emily: So, what, you're doing this out of the goodness of your heart?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I'm doing it out of the goodness -- is that so hard for you to believe?",
        "Emily: Actually, no. Now that I know you actually have a heart.",
        "Henry: Oh, that's funny. I got it in oz, from the wizard. I wish he'd given me a brain a brain.",
        "Emily: No, I'm the one in need of that, thanks.",
        "Henry: No, no -- just a momentary lapse of reasoning, that's all.",
        "Emily: I'm gonna get better, you know that?",
        "Henry: I do, and I'm gonna help you. Because I am not just a fair-weather friend. I'm there on rainy days, too. So, let's see, first thing on the agenda -- let's figure out why Paul did not sign those papers.",
        "Emily: I already know why. He wants in on his child's life. I'm telling you, all it took was one look at that sonogram picture, and his daddy instincts kicked on in.",
        "Henry: Daddy instincts -- I have a hard time picturing Paul with even a single paternal gene in his entire body. Be that as it may, let's say he wants to take a shot at fatherhood, I have a feeling that Meg is gonna do everything she can to stop him.",
        "Emily: You do?",
        "Henry: Yeah, I do. They're just -- look, they're just starting off. If I were the new girlfriend, I wouldn't want to be saddled with your baby. No offense.",
        "Emily: You know what, maybe you're right. Maybe Meg was the one who pushed Paul into drawing up those papers.",
        "Henry: Which means she doesn't know that he is chickening out. So, when she finds out, there's going to be hell to pay.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: What's wrong?",
        "Meg: Nothing. For the first time in ages, things seem to be actually right. We're finally free of all things Emily. Can you believe it?",
        "Paul: Yeah, it's amazing.",
        "Meg: I owe you an apology.",
        "Paul: For what?",
        "Meg: For doubting you. I mean, I knew you would be able to go through with the divorce, but when it came to giving up all rights for your child, I was afraid that you'd do a u-turn at the last minute. So I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: Don't be. You were right to have doubts.",
        "Meg: I was?",
        "Paul: Yes. Meg, you were right to not trust me.",
        "Meg: Why would you say I was right not to trust you? Emily did sign the papers, didn't she?",
        "Paul: Just like I said, you know -- I mean, I, I -- I handed her the divorce papers, and she signed them in all the right places.",
        "Meg: So you did exactly as you promised. What's not to trust?",
        "Paul: Just about everything I've ever done.",
        "Meg: Hey. That's ancient history. I am looking at the new and improved Paul Ryan. Aren't I?",
        "Paul: I hope so. Look, I know that I let you down, and not just once. Lots of times. But for what it's worth, my intentions were always good.",
        "Meg: Good?",
        "Paul: Pure, even.",
        "Meg: Pure?",
        "Paul: No, I like noble.",
        "Meg: Noble.",
        "Paul: Noble's better.",
        "Meg: You know, I can live with noble.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Meg: You know, what matters is that you didn't let me down this time. You came through for me. For us.",
        "Paul: I did the very best I could.",
        "Meg: So, I guess this means we're going to Fiji after all.",
        "Paul: Yeah. I mean, if you're still up for it.",
        "Meg: No, no. Actually, I'm not up for it. Are you kidding me? Of course I'm up for it. I can't wait to get out of this town and just lie on the beach with you and a Mai Tai.",
        "Paul: A Mai -- sounds like paradise.",
        "Meg: Yeah. And to think I once told my cousin Jack we'd never make it to paradise. Thank you for proving me wrong.",
        "Paul: My pleasure.",
        "Meg: I'm so glad Emily didn't give you a hard time about signing the papers -",
        "Paul: Ah, no, stop. Look, I don't want to hear about Emily. I don't think we should talk at all, really.",
        "Meg: Hey.",
        "Paul: What are you doing?",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Henry: Paul? Paul, are you in there?",
        "Meg: Is that Henry?",
        "Paul: Yeah, just ignore him. He'll probably go away.",
        "Meg: Whoa, whoa, wait. What's he doing here, anyway?",
        "Paul: I have no idea.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Henry: Paul, if you're in there, open up. It's very important. I think you know what I mean.",
        "Meg: He doesn't seem to be going away.",
        "Paul: All right. I'll get rid of him. What do you want?",
        "Henry: What do you think, Paul? My bad. Seem to be interrupting something, here. Hey, don't mind me. I'll just wait until you're finished.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Will: Mr. Glick, I can explain that.",
        "Mr. Glick: I certainly hope so. I'm amazed you were able to turn in such an excellent paper in so little time. Maybe we can share of your techniques with some of your fellow students who aren't doing so well?",
        "Will: So, does that mean I'm going to pass?",
        "Mr. Glick: With flying colors. This paper went a long way towards offsetting the missed exam.",
        "Will: Really?",
        "Gwen: Isn't that fantastic?",
        "Will: Yeah. That's one word for it.",
        "Mr. Glick: You seem surprised.",
        "Will: Uh, yeah -- yeah, I kind of am --",
        "Mr. Glick: Look for yourself.",
        "Will: You thought it was that good?",
        "Mr. Glick: It's the best work you've done since you came back to school.",
        "Gwen: I knew you'd turn things around.",
        "Mr. Glick: This just goes to show, it's never too late to challenge yourself. Good work, Mr. Munson. I'll see you in class.",
        "Gwen: I'm so proud of you.",
        "Jade: I better leave you two alone.",
        "Gwen: Oh no. Wait, hold on. Don't go anywhere. We both know you had a lot to do with this. Didn't she, Will?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Why would you tell Nick that I had been in contact with you? I thought I made it clear that I was trying to set him up for a surprise.",
        "Jeweler: Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry. But when he came in to pick up the medal and it was already gone, I really didn't have much choice but to explain the situation.",
        "Katie: I just wish I knew how I was going to explain the situation!",
        "Jeweler: I don't think it'll be a problem. Your husband didn't seem upset.",
        "Katie: Oh no, Nick's very good at hiding his feelings. As well as his agenda. Oh, Mike. Oh no. I've got to get to Mike before Nick does!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Wait a minute. Katie claimed to be your wife?",
        "Nick: Yeah. She told the jeweler that it was a surprise for me. And that's how she got him to deliver the St. Christopher medal to your house. And who do you think put her up to this?",
        "Mike: Carly.",
        "Nick: Yeah. Carly wants to prove that I stole that medal out of the evidence room.",
        "Mike: But that's what I don't get. Carly knows now we both got medals from our grandfather. The one in your wallet belongs to you. You didn't steal it.",
        "Nick: Yeah, but she wants everybody to believe I pulled a fast one, all right? Now she's playing detective.",
        "Mike: Okay, okay. But why did Katie get involved? She's on our side. She's not going to believe Carly's lies again.",
        "Nick: Just don't let Carly mess up things between you and Katie.",
        "Mike: I won't. I just need to get to the bottom of this. If I find out that Katie is working against you, I'll straighten her out.",
        "Nick: Just as long as you don't think that I'm guilty, then I'm cool.",
        "Mike: Look, you told me you didn't take the medal from the evidence room, Nick. That's good enough for me. We're family, all right? I've got your back and I know you've got mine.",
        "Nick: Always. But still, I don't want to ever have you make a choice between your wife and your cousin. Maybe it's time for me to move out.",
        "Mike: No. No way. I'll straighten this out with Katie, don't worry. Is that your partner in crime?",
        "Katie: My what?",
        "Mike: Was that Carly on the phone?",
        "Katie: No, I was leaving you a message.",
        "Mike: Why? Are you trying to tell me what you had to get Nick's St. Christopher medal?",
        "Katie: I see Nick doesn't waste any time.",
        "Mike: Katie, I thought you were out of this. How could you let Carly drag you back into this mess?",
        "Katie: Why do you think Carly's involved?",
        "Mike: Come on, Katie. I saw her here, earlier. She convinced you to get Nick's St. Christopher medal out of the jewelry shop so you could prove it was the same one that disappeared from the evidence room.",
        "Katie: No. The only thing I'm trying to prove is that you're innocent. That there's no way you killed that woman and then walled her up in Carly's basement.",
        "Mike: That's not the only thing you're doing here. Hey, Carly doesn't give a damn about me. For her, this is all about Nick. Katie, she's using you to help her discredit him.",
        "Katie: There's something about this entire mess that doesn't make sense, and if you don't believe me, then I'll show you. Explain to me why I all of a sudden have two of them?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jade: All I did was help Will find some of the research he was looking for. I just pointed him in the right direction. He did the rest.",
        "Gwen: But he was so freaked out about getting it done on time. You must've said something to make him think he could pull it off.",
        "Jade: No, he already had his motivation. He kept telling me that he didn't want to let you down, that he had to finish it for you.",
        "Gwen: Well, that's so sweet. But the more important thing is, you didn't let yourself down.",
        "Will: No, stop --",
        "Gwen: I'm really proud of you.",
        "Will: No, really. It's just an extra credit report. I don't know why everybody's making such a big deal about it.",
        "Gwen: Well it is a big deal. Do you think Mr. Glick makes a point of going to all his students, to tell them what a good job they did?",
        "Jade: She's right. You should be really happy.",
        "Will: Yeah. Okay. Fine.",
        "Mrs. Stacell: Jade, could I please have a word with you?",
        "Jade: Yeah, sure.",
        "Mrs. Stacell: Would you kindly explain what this is doing here?",
        "[She takes Jade's bookbag off the top of a bookcase]",
        "Gwen: I can't wait to finally read this thing.",
        "Will: No, don't bother. It's just going to bore you to tears. I don't know what Mr. Glick was raving about.",
        "Gwen: Why can't you give yourself a pat yourself on the back once in a while? You did a good thing.",
        "Will: No, I didn't. I don't feel like I did. You know.",
        "Gwen: I think we should celebrate.",
        "Maddie: Celebrate what?",
        "Gwen: Will aced that extra credit report he had to do for Bio.",
        "Maddie: No way.",
        "Gwen: Yeah, look -- see yourself.",
        "Maddie: This is a joke, right?",
        "Gwen: Why would you say that?",
        "Maddie: Because there's no way that Will could've done this in one day.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Uh-oh. If you're here, it's gotta be bad news. What, Dusty talked to the judge and convinced him to skip my 30 day evaluation and throw my butt right into jail?",
        "Hal: No, nothing like that. Not that he didn't try. You'll be staying here, at least for the time being.",
        "Emily: So what's the bad news?",
        "Hal: Oh, I just came to drop off the court papers approving your evaluation.",
        "Emily: You didn't have to come to my room to do that, you know.",
        "Hal: Okay, so I wanted to see how you were doing. If you needed anything.",
        "Emily: You don't want me here. You want me in jail. I know that. You're checking up on me. You're hoping against hope that I'll slip up, and you'll be able to revoke my evaluation period.",
        "Hal: Can you blame me for being suspicious?",
        "Emily: No. Not really. All the horrible things I've done, it's going to be a long time before anybody trusts me again. A very long time.",
        "Hal: Now you see? That sounds pretty sane to me. Not like a person who needs to be put under a psychological microscope.",
        "Emily: I am not trying to beat the system, I swear to you. I meant that.",
        "Hal: Hard for me to believe I'm talking to the same woman who shot Paul in the back, locked dusty away in a farmhouse and almost killed him.",
        "Emily: I'm trying really hard to get back to the person you used to know. I need to get well. I know that. For the sake of my children.",
        "Hal: That's another thing that's hard for me to believe. Are you bound and determined to have this baby?",
        "Emily: Well, you think I should?",
        "Hal: I think you need a little repair work first, Emily. You don't want to be having the baby for the wrong reason.",
        "Emily: You mean, to hold onto Paul.",
        "Hal: Precisely.",
        "Emily: You get that thought out of your head. Trust me, it wasn't until I realized that things were really over between me and Paul that I could actually decided to keep this child.",
        "Hal: So it really is over between you and Paul?",
        "Emily: As far as I'm concerned, it is. If anyone is having a problem letting go, it's him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Henry, why are you here?",
        "Meg: If you're here to pick up something of Emily's, her mother's already picked the place clean.",
        "Henry: No, no, no. I'm here to pick up something of Paul's, that he neglected to give to Emily in the hospital. I'm sure that was just an oversight.",
        "Paul: There's nothing here that Emily needs. Now gulp your drink down and get lost.",
        "Henry: Gulp? Paul, my goodness. You don't gulp down a martini, you take your time with it. Time is something that I happen to have plenty of, as much time as you --",
        "Meg: What are you talking about, Henry?",
        "Henry: You haven't told her? Why doesn't that surprise me?",
        "Meg: Told me what?",
        "Paul: Henry, get out of here.",
        "Henry: Not without the relinquishment papers. They're as important to Emily as much as the divorce papers were important to you.",
        "Meg: You said Emily signed everything that needed to be signed, Paul. What's going on?",
        "Henry: What's going on is that Paul is having second thoughts about turning his back on his little baby.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up, on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Maddie: Sure didn't help him get this \"A.\" He did that all on his own.",
        "Gwen: Oh, is that it? You're mad because Will picked up an \"A,\" and you didn't have anything to do with it?",
        "Katie: I was trying to keep you out of prison for something you didn't do, and if you don't get that, then you don't get me.",
        "Emily: Paul's gotta make a choice.",
        "Henry: Yeah, yeah. For the good of the baby, and keep little miss Meg happy.",
        "Paul: You and I can raise this baby together.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What's going on, Paul?",
        "Paul: I never said that Emily signed the relinquishment papers. I just only mentioned the divorce papers.",
        "Meg: You knew I was talking about both when I asked you! Paul --",
        "Paul: I can explain.",
        "Meg: You know what? Forget about it!",
        "Henry: Man, that is one ticked off woman.",
        "Paul: Henry, finish your drink.",
        "Henry: Well, thank you. Whoa, hey, Paul, aren't you forgetting something? She needs those papers, like, yesterday, okay?",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Paul: Meg? Please, give me a second. I can explain all of this.",
        "Meg: Don't even waste your time.",
        "Paul: Where are you going?",
        "Meg: I'm going away from here. I should've known. This was just a dream. [Paper tearing] Get out of my way.",
        "Paul: Not until you hear me out.",
        "Meg: How many times do I have to hear the same empty words, Paul?",
        "Paul: I was going to tell you everything, I swear to you.",
        "Meg: Then why didn't you?",
        "Paul: Because you looked so happy.",
        "Meg: Oh, so it's my fault you lied to me? Oh, oh, I see.",
        "Paul: No.",
        "Meg: I see. Get out of my way!",
        "Paul: No, please, look. Emily and I, we're through, okay? Emily and I are divorced.",
        "Meg: It was never about Emily. It was always about the baby. I knew you wouldn't be able to walk away.",
        "Paul: You said yourself that you had reservations about being with a guy who could just cut a child out of his life. That's what I was thinking about.",
        "Meg: Stop trying to turn this back on me. I am not going to let you do that.",
        "Paul: Meg, we can work this out.",
        "Meg: No, no, we can't! We can't, Paul! That's what I always talk to you about. Look, if you want to be a standup dad and take care of your child, well, congratulations. But I am not going to be the woman to stand next to you when you do that. Especially not when you lied to my face about it.",

        "Katie: Well, how well do you really know him? Until he came back to Oakdale, you barely talked to him.",
        "Mike: I know he's not a killer. Okay? And he would never let me take the rap for something I didn't do.",
        "Katie: No, you're right. I don't think he would do that.",
        "Mike: Then what's all this about?",
        "Katie: Maybe he stole the medal from the evidence room to make your case go away. But wouldn't that protect you both?",
        "Mike: There's one thing you're forgetting. My DNA was on the medal found on the corpse. How do you explain that?",
        "Katie: The geneticist I talked to said that it could be yours, it could be --",
        "Mike: What?",
        "Katie: There's a guy at the hospital that I knew when I was a nurse's aide there. He also works for the Oakdale Police Department sometimes.",
        "Mike: You got a geneticist involved in my case without even saying anything?",
        "Katie: Just listen to what he said. The medal has your DNA on it, or it could be your brother's or your first cousin.",
        "Mike: This is ridiculous.",
        "Katie: Just step back and think about it for a second, Mike. It makes sense!",

        "Katie: Are you yelling at me?",
        "Mike: How could you let Carly poison your mind like this?",
        "Katie: This has nothing to do with Carly, honey. I had my own questions so I went out and got my own answers. And I'm sorry that you don't like them, but I did it for you!",
        "Mike: Behind my back. Why didn't you just come to me when you found the second medal?",
        "Katie: I was about to, but then Nick walked in. I didn't want to tip him off. I mean, if he is guilty, then he would've freaked out!",
        "Mike: For the last time, he's not!",
        "Katie: Okay. But just look at it from my perspective. If the roles were reversed and you knew that there was evidence on a corpse that wasn't mine, you would do anything in your power to protect me.",
        "Mike: Of course. But would stop short of pinning a murder on an innocent man!",
        "Katie: I wasn't trying to hurt Nick. I was just trying to help my husband.",

        "Katie: When I found your medal in that box, I can't tell you what a strange feeling it gave me. I was thrilled and sick to my stomach at the same time. Thrilled because I knew you weren't going to prison and I wouldn't have to lose you. At the same time, I was just so scared.",
        "Mike: Because you started doubting Nick?",
        "Katie: Yeah. I didn't want to. I swear I didn't want to. But all this evidence started building up and it just made sense. Then I had to wrap my mind around the fact that the guy that's been living here the past couple of months could be a murderer.",

        "Mike: And Jack took that as proof of Nick's innocence, right?",
        "Katie: Right. He said it's an airtight alibi. So you are right about your cousin. He didn't do it.",
        "Mike: That's what I've been trying to tell you all along.",
        "Katie: I know. But there's something about this that still doesn't make sense.",

        "Katie: We've got two St. Christopher medals, neither of which can be placed at the scene of the crime. Then whose medal was on the dead body?",

        "Mike: Just next time, come to me first, please.",
