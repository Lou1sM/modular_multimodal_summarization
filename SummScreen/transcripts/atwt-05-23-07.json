        "Paul: Yeah. I'm hoping to get you drunk and convince you to take your clothes off again.",
        "Meg: Yeah. Hello?",
        "Craig: I need a nurse.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry that was my past life.",
        "Craig: But I've been hurt.",
        "Meg: What's wrong? What happened?",
        "Craig: A beautiful woman broke my heart when she blew me off last night.",
        "Meg: I was exhausted, Craig. You called too late.",
        "Craig: Well, can I entice you to come see me in the light of day?",
        "Meg: Well, that depends on how you plan to behave.",
        "Craig: I'll be a perfect gentlemen. We can meet here in my office. I'll be sure they'll have plenty of assistants around, so I can't do anything unseemly.",
        "Meg: You haven't said what you want.",
        "Craig: Wow, you are really making me work for this, aren't you?",
        "Meg: Look, if you don't think that I'm worth the effort, then --",
        "Craig: I have something to tell you and it's important.",
        "Meg: All right. I'll be right there.",
        "Paul: You're going.",
        "Meg: Yeah, he says he has something to tell me. Something important.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, who cares what Craig thinks is important. This vendetta is over.",
        "Meg: Said who?",
        "Paul: You stayed with me last night.",
        "Meg: I stayed with you because I wanted to, Paul.",
        "Paul: But today you don't?",
        "Meg: Of course I do. I love you. That's not going to change. But I'm not giving up doing what needs to be done with Craig. It's not over, Paul. Not by a long shot.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: You're late.",
        "Lucinda: I know. I know, I know. I'm sorry, Darling. Well, we're here, I'm ravenous. Would you like a spot of lunch?",
        "Lily: Um, actually I'm meeting the children and Holden. But I wanted to give you this.",
        "Lucinda: What is this?",
        "Lily: It's a prospectus. Mm-hmm.",
        "Lucinda: Of what?",
        "Lily: Oh, well, Craig's not just going to hand you back the company. And I don't want you pulling another scheme like the one with Rosanna. So I spoke to some of your advisors and we came up with a business plan.",
        "Lucinda: For whom?",
        "Lily: For us. The two of us. We can start a new company, from the ground up. Together.",
        "Lucinda: Like hell we can.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: I don't know. Just going to have to take a chance on this lantern working. I think it will work. What about your flashlight? Hey, that's good. That's good.",
        "J.J.: What's going on?",
        "Emma: Well, it's such a warm day. I thought maybe we could -- we could all go camping in the backfield.",
        "J.J.: Well, what time does Dad get home? He can show us the summer triangle.",
        "Emma: I don't think your daddy's going to be able to join us. He's got a date tonight.",
        "Sage: Daddy's got a date! Daddy's got a date!",
        "Parker: Is it a real one?",
        "Emma: I didn't know there was another kind.",
        "Parker: Well, there's the kind when he takes all his kids with him.",
        "J.J.: Well, is he going with Katie?",
        "Emma: Yes! Yes, he is.",
        "Parker: It's about time.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: Have a seat. I'll be right in. Hey.",
        "Katie: Hey. I came over here as soon as I heard something was going on with the missing diamonds.",
        "Jack: Yeah, it looks like we found them.",
        "Katie: Looks like you found Carly, too.",
        "Jack: Actually, she found me.",
        "Katie: What about Simon? Was he with her?",
        "Jack: No, he's still at large. Apparently they split up.",
        "Katie: So, she came back alone?",
        "Jack: Looks that way.",
        "Katie: For how long?",
        "Jack: She says she's here for good.",
        "Katie: So, is Carly under arrest? I mean, that's why you brought her in, right?",
        "Jack: Yeah, I've got a lot of legal untangling to do, so I don't know how anything is going to play out. First thing's first, they got to find out if these jewels are real.",
        "Katie: They are. I was here when Margo got the confirmation. Apparently, the necklace that Vienna found around her neck is almost a perfect reconstruction of the one she was wearing the night of the robbery. Margo's talking to the prince right now.",
        "Jack: Okay.",
        "Katie: So what does that mean exactly -- for Carly?",
        "Jack: I don't know, Katie. All I know is that Carly's here, Simon's gone, and I've got a lot of sorting out to do. But I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything, okay? Unfortunately, we're going to have to postpone our plans tonight. I'm sorry. I really am.",
        "Margo: Jack, sorry to interrupt, I just got off the phone with his royal highness -- so we've gotta talk.",
        "Katie: You've got work to do. I'm -- I'll -- I'm just going to go.",
        "Jack: Yeah, Katie -- wait. Try not to worry, okay?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: I thought this was all settled, Darling, I really did. I thought -- no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no we're not going to do that.",
        "Lily: What about using your imagination? And your courage?",
        "Lucinda: I'm going to use my imagination and my courage for Worldwide and to bring Craig to heel, okay?",
        "Lily: You swore after Craig took over Worldwide, you would start a new company. One that was so dynamic it would devour him whole.",
        "Lucinda: That was in the heat of the moment. I'm not going to let that thief take my company away from me. I'm not going to let it happen!",
        "Lily: What if it's not up to you anymore? I mean, you tried to manipulate him, I tried to reason with him, it didn't work. Let's stop beating that dead horse! Reinvent yourself. That's what you said.",
        "Lucinda: It's wonderful that rehab has brought out this side of your personality, Darling. I think my advice to you is go home, focus on your family and your health. Leave Craig to me.",
        "Lily: How? After using Rosanna to try to push him over the edge, you have a tough act to follow, Mother.",
        "Lucinda: You don't want to know, Darling. You just don't want to know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Did you hear me last night when I said that I don't want to lose you?",
        "Meg: Yes and did you hear me when I said that you wouldn't?",
        "Paul: Keep up this nonsense with Craig and I will lose you.",
        "Meg: I have been working for weeks to try to get him to confide in me and after that phone call it was really clear that -- that I've succeeded. And now is the time to bring him down. To trap him.",
        "Paul: So what's your plan?",
        "Meg: Well, it hasn't changed. I'm going to get him to confide in me. I want him to tell me why he freaked out about Rosanna. Look, he said he had something to tell me. Maybe he's finally going to confess what actually happened the night he ran her off the road.",
        "Paul: That's not a plan. That's like a wish. Craig is dangerous. I just -- I want it -- I want it over.",
        "Meg: And it will be. As soon as he tells us exactly what we've been trying to get out of him.",
        "Paul: Yeah, if you don't have a wire, you can't prove anything? And you're obsessing.",
        "Meg: And you're trying to control me again. I thought you said things would be different this time.",
        "Paul: No, it is different, but you can't see it because you're consumed with this ridiculous vendetta.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I got to go -- he's at the office waiting.",
        "Paul: Hold on, just stay.",
        "Meg: I can't, okay? He's gonna get suspicious!",
        "Paul: So what? Will you just stand here for a second, and breath -- and think? And think about what we shared last night. How long has it been since we -- really let our guard down around each other?",
        "Meg: A long time.",
        "Paul: Yeah, a long time. Last night it felt to me like we were starting over.",
        "Meg: I know, and we will. It's just --",
        "Paul: There's no just, no buts, no plotting. No more scheming. You were lying in my arms, and you felt like you could begin again.",
        "Meg: We will. I mean, we are.",
        "Paul: I'm gonna take a shower. And you stay here and you think about what I said. Or you stay here and eat some of that fruit. Or you could stay here and open up that champagne and we can toast to what's really important. Us.",
        "Meg: Paul, the door.",
        "Lucinda: Paul, it's me. I need to talk to you.",
        "Meg: Hi, Lucinda -- Paul's in the shower.",
        "Lucinda: Hi Darling. My, don't you look absolutely stunning, today!",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Lucinda: Wow, if Craig saw you, he couldn't resist.",
        "Meg: Well, he did call, as a matter of fact.",
        "Lucinda: Did you make a date?",
        "Meg: I did, but Paul did a pretty good job of talking me out of it.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no, no, don't listen to him.",
        "Meg: I love Paul, Lucinda. And what he said made a lot of sense.",
        "Lucinda: But you can't stop now! Not after you've made all this investment in this.",
        "Meg: Paul's convinced that we'd be better off if we just left Craig alone.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, hear yourself, Darling. Paul this, Paul that. Paul -- come on! It's you! What you think! Stand up for what you believe and act!",
        "Meg: Stop pushing me, Lucinda.",
        "Lucinda: All right, Darling, but look, all Craig wants to do with me, is to humiliate me. I know that. With Paul? His life -- his life is in danger if Craig want to retaliate. So, if you like your guy, if you love your guy, you go! Go and see what Craig is -- he's up to! Oh.",
        "Paul: I hope you saved me a strawberry \u0096",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: So, you spoke to the prince?",
        "Margo: Bottom line is -- since the jewels turned out to be genuine, the prince is no longer interested in pursuing you or Simon.",
        "Carly: Oh, thank God.",
        "Jack: Are we going to get something official?",
        "Margo: After he has his press conference. Announces his decision. But as far as he's concerned the case is closed. A courier from the consulate is coming over to pick up the necklace now. It's in the lab so I'm going to go try it on. Unless of course you need me for anything else here.",
        "Jack: No. No, I've got it. Thanks Margo.",
        "Margo: Yep.",
        "Carly: Well, I can't tell you how relieved I am that this is over.",
        "Jack: Where do you think you're going?",
        "Carly: You know, I don't know. I checked out of my room at the Wagon Wheel. I suppose I could go back there, but if it's all right by you, I'd like to go to the house, just for a day or two, you know, until I figure things out. I could really use a nice, long, hot shower and a bed without lumps. Well, you heard Margo, she just said that the prince dropped the charges, Jack.",
        "Jack: That doesn't mean that you're free to go, Carly. You're still under arrest.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I spent all morning trying to get Meg to give up with insanity with Craig and you talk her into going over there.",
        "Lucinda: It was necessary.",
        "Paul: Do you have any idea what Craig's going to do to her if he finds out that she's been playing him?",
        "Lucinda: He won't.",
        "Paul: You don't know that. You wind Meg up and you send her over there without a single thought about her safety.",
        "Lucinda: Look, she's a very smart lady. If she thought there was a problem, she wouldn't have gone. You're acting like a jealous lover.",
        "Paul: That's ridiculous.",
        "Lucinda: Well, if you love her -- if you love her, respect her for the smart and resourceful girl that she is.",
        "[Paul sighs]",
        "Paul: You know, I do respect her, but it doesn't matter how smart and resourceful she is if she's dead.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: These are for you.",
        "Meg: They're beautiful. What's the occasion?",
        "Craig: New beginnings.",
        "Meg: Well, everybody deserves a fresh start.",
        "Craig: Well, you of all people know the kind of hell that I've been through lately. Even though that those phone calls weren't actually from Rosanna, they did take their toll. They gave me a lot of -- well, I've been thinking.",
        "Meg: About?",
        "Craig: About Lucinda. About Paul. And you.",
        "Meg: Why are you lumping me in with those two?",
        "Craig: Oh, I'm not. I'm actually drawing the distinction between their treachery and your loyalty.",
        "Meg: My loyalty? I don't understand.",
        "Craig: If I confess something to you, would you forgive and let us start over?",
        "Meg: Well, that depends what you confess.",
        "Craig: I had a private detective follow you.",
        "Meg: Last night?",
        "Craig: Mm-hmm.",
        "Meg: And?",
        "Craig: And he reported to me that you went to your mother's farm, just as you said you would.",
        "Meg: Did he also tell you what I had for dinner, or what time I brushed my teeth, or where I went when I slipped out of the house?",
        "Craig: Look, it won't happen again. But after I saw you and how angry you got with Lucinda and Paul over what they had done to me, I had to make sure that that was real. Look, as soon as the private eye reported to me, I just felt like kicking myself for doubting you. I mean, I realize that you would never be in collaboration like that with Paul. But, that kind of deceit, it's just not in your nature.",
        "Meg: Why are you so sure? Why don't you implant me with one of those microchips --?",
        "Craig: No, please Meg, don't be angry. I didn't have to tell you, but I did because I do want us -- I want us to start over. You have always been honest with me and I have distrusted you. You have offered me you friendship and I have pushed you away. I am not gonna push you away anymore. And I want to tell you, I finally believe that you are on my side.",
        "Meg: Well, you can't be anymore wrong, Craig. I am not your friend and I am certainly not on your side.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Well, I don't be needing this, or this. Or any of these.",
        "Margo: Hey, it's me!",
        "Katie: I was just house cleaning.",
        "Margo: No, you were just freaking out.",
        "Katie: No, I wasn't. I was just facing reality. That I'm not going on a romantic date to Chicago tonight because my date's wife is back in town.",
        "Margo: Your date's ex-wife and yes, you were freaking out.",
        "Katie: No, I wasn't. I just want to know why she came back.",
        "Margo: Well, maybe because she has three kids who live here.",
        "Katie: She didn't care about those kids when she ran off with Simon. And why isn't she still with him?",
        "Margo: Well, I -- I don't know. You know, things -- there's a lot still to come out.",
        "Katie: What did the prince say about the charges?",
        "Margo: I don't know. There's -- we're still sorting some things out.",
        "Katie: Margo, just tell me. Is Carly going to jail or not?",
        "Margo: The prince is dropping the charges.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Is this personal, Jack?",
        "Jack: You know me better than that. Are you kidding me? I told you back at the house, even without the grand larceny charges, there's still a lot of issues, you've got aiding and abetting a fugitive, and escaping from police custody.",
        "Carly: But you let me go.",
        "Jack: You weren't supposed to come back, Carly! That was part of the deal, remember? You leave me no choice, this is what I have to do.",
        "Carly: What you have to do. So, it's about your career?",
        "Jack: My career? No, this is about the kids. Who's been -- they've been living with one parent doing the job of two, with one lousy paycheck to live off of. But you're right, I let you escape once. And do you have any idea the hell I paid trying to explain that to people?",
        "Carly: I was very grateful, Jack.",
        "Jack: I don't care about how grateful you are. This isn't about that. I don't want your gratitude. We've been down this road before, Carly. I can't get thrown off the force. I won't do that to the kids.",
        "Carly: I'm not asking for any special treatment, okay? I know that I have done enough damage --",
        "Jack: Don't, don't, don't. Stop! Don't. Come on, let's go.",
        "Carly: Jack! I need a favor. I only came back here for one reason -- the kids. Please, let me see them. Reason -- the kids. Please, let me see them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: What's going on? You have gone out of your way to convince me to trust you.",
        "Meg: Yeah, well that was a big mistake.",
        "Craig: Meg, what is it? What's happened? You were part of it. You were part of that plot with Paul, weren't you?",
        "Meg: You know, this is so like you, Craig. I tell you I can't be your friend and you refuse to believe that's me talking. You think its Lucinda or Paul or some kind of boogey man --",
        "Craig: No, I want to know what to happened to change things between last night and today.",
        "Meg: I've changed! I've had a lot of time to think about what kind of friends I want in my life.",
        "Craig: Oh, I see. I can't be one of those?",
        "Meg: You just admitted you had a private detective following me. And before that, you show up at the farm, unannounced, demanding that I come clean. And then, I even had to nearly strip naked to convince you that I wasn't wearing a wire. Is that how friends behave? Is that how they check up on each other, by -- by laying traps?",
        "Craig: Why did you take my side against Lucinda and Paul?",
        "Meg: After they concocted that hoax, I saw what it did to you. And I reflexively ran to the underdog. Nurse Meg to the rescue. I just chose the wrong side.",
        "Craig: Oh, I see. And Lucinda and Paul, that's the right side?",
        "Meg: Why does it have to be you or them? Maybe -- maybe I finally decided to pick my own side. Maybe, I want to be discriminating about who I give my time and my energy to.",
        "Craig: I see, and that could not possible include me.",
        "Meg: How am I supposed to ignore what you did to my brother and my sister-in- law? I told you how I saw good in you, and then you turned around and you swindled the company from Lily. Look around you, Craig, you're in an office of a company that you stole out of sheer revenge. How can I forget that?",
        "Craig: You didn't have a problem with that yesterday.",
        "Meg: You love to tell me how I have principles. Well, if that's true, how can I, in good conscience, be a part of this? I'm sorry, Craig, but I can't stand by your side anymore.",
        "Craig: I have been betrayed by everyone I have ever believed in. Do you know how hard it was for me to get here? Do you know how hard it was for me to admit that you could be my friend?",
        "Meg: Yes, I think I do.",
        "Craig: Too good to be true, wasn't it? You and I on the same page. You should go.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry, Craig.",
        "Craig: Just go.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: I don't believe this! She lies, she steals, she abandons three defenseless children, yet, she walks.",
        "Margo: So, you're upset that the mother of Jack's children isn't going to prison?",
        "Katie: No, no. God, I didn't mean for it to sound like that. It's just --",
        "Margo: I know, no, you didn't sound like that. You just sound like a woman who is flipping out because she's really beginning to care for someone.",
        "Katie: I do. These clothes -- these clothes, I bought them because I was finally, after so long, looking forward to something. I had dreams again that this first casualty will turn into a second romantic date, which will turn into a little bit of this, if you know what I mean. My life is going in such a positive direction, but with timing from hell, Carly comes back and Jack has to cancel.",
        "Margo: Well, he didn't cancel his relationship with you. It's just a date. And Carly is under arrest and Jack is the arresting officer.",
        "Katie: I know. But you know her. You know she's gonna use that to get him to feel sorry for her again.",
        "Margo: He can't stop his feelings for her. It doesn't mean he's gonna fly back into her arms, Katie.",
        "Katie: I hope not.",
        "Margo: No. They were divorced before she left.",
        "Katie: Yeah, that does help.",
        "Margo: And there are outstanding O.P.D. charges against her. So, she probably will go to jail.",
        "Katie: For how long?",
        "Margo: I don't know. For a while. Just take a deep breath, okay? Breathe deep, okay? Relax and let it go.",
        "Katie: It's okay. I'm not -- I am not gonna go off the deep end.",

        "Katie: If I didn't see when he brought her into the interrogation room, he made sure that she didn't see me.",
        "Margo: Oh, you are really too much into that.",
        "Katie: Am I really? He turned her back to me so she wouldn't see me. Why would he do that? I'll tell you why. Because he doesn't want her to know we're together.",

        "Carly: They're why I'm here. I'm still their mother.",
        "Jack: Yeah. You're also why Sage cried herself to sleep for months. And why Parker is now sullen and suspicious. And why J.J. hovers over a Mother's day plant like it's got magic in it. It may be good for you, it'd be very bad for them.",
        "Carly: I know they want to see me, Jack.",
        "Jack: I am not going to let you erase all of the progress we've made so you can get a glimpse of them before I take you down to lock up. I am not going to do that to them, Carly. So, please, let it go.",
        "Carly: I can't. Could you?",
        "Jack: What would it change? Is it going to change the fact that you chose Simon over them?",
        "Carly: No, it won't change anything I've done. But, I know in my soul that they need to see me. They need to see that I never forgot them. That I never went one day, one hour without thinking about them. And if Parker's having a tough time, maybe it's because he doesn't believe that I love him as much as I do.",
        "Jack: He knows that you love him. I'm told him. I've told him all of that --",
        "Carly: Let me tell them, then, myself! Let them hear it from me.",
        "Jack: Why? Why? So, they can just turn around and say good-bye again?",
        "Carly: They need to see me, Jack. And even if they're angry, they need to able to tell me to my face.",
        "Jack: You sure you're ready for that?",
        "Carly: Being angry doesn't mean that you've stopped loving someone. Can you honestly tell me that my children don't still love me?",

        "Lucinda: Oh, but you have the stomach for what Craig did to Lily?",
        "Meg: I hate what Craig did, but I can't change it with dirty tricks. Or I'll end up hurting myself.",
        "Lucinda: This is your doing.",
        "Meg: No, this is my doing. I'm ready to focus on what matters. I've been sneaking around, trying to see the man I love because I've been pretending to be a friend to a man I hate. What's wrong with that picture?",
        "Lucinda: But Darling, clearly -- I mean, obviously, you're not uncomfortable with deceit. But, for heaven's sake, it's such a pity when we were so close to getting Craig to admit the truth.",
        "Meg: And what about the quality of my life? The time I lost? The love I've ignored? I -- I nursed you during your cancer, Lucinda. You, of all people, should know that you need to grab what's precious. And Paul is precious to me. And I can't lose him.",
        "Lucinda: My cancer?",
        "Paul: Okay, Lucinda, stop. It's over. Meg's made up her mind. It's over.",
        "Lucinda: All right. He's going to speak for you from now on?",
        "Meg: Yes, he is, because he's saying exactly what I feel. It's over. I'm sorry.",
        "Lucinda: You're no more sorry than I am.",

        "Meg: That's kind of weird, that's what Craig -- you were there, weren't you?",
        "Paul: Yeah. I didn't leave until I knew you were safe.",
        "Meg: So, you heard everything?",
        "Paul: Yeah, you were great. There's no way Craig would have suspected that you were playing him.",
        "Meg: Well, even if he does, he doesn't have proof. God, that's a quite a relief. It feels like this heavy weight's been lifted off. It's over, isn't it?",

        "Katie: Margo. I really am okay. I get it. I understand that there are adjustments to make, but with Carly back in town, the kids may be a little distant with me. But, that's okay. I can handle that. And I'm not naive. I understand that Jack will always have feelings for Carly. There will always be a place in his heart for her. But, that doesn't mean, necessarily, that he's going to go running back to her, right?",
        "Margo: Hmm, isn't it the same for you?",
