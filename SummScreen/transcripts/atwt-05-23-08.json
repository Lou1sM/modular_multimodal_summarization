        "Lily: I know what got you guys up this morning -- the smell of my famous blueberry pancakes!",
        "Faith: Actually, me and Nat are going to Mary's house. Her mom said that she'd take us to Al's for breakfast. We kind of promised.",
        "Natalie: You're not mad, are you, Mommy?",
        "Lily: No, I'm not mad. You certainly can't break a promise. You guys go. Go. Have a great time at Mary's.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: I hope you're hungry. Seems like nobody else wants a home-cooked meal in this house.",
        "Holden: You made enough for an army, huh?",
        "Lily: Yeah, I -- I guess I went a little overboard.",
        "Holden: I think you went a lot overboard. And I think has to stop. And if you're trying to make up for what happened last night -- don't do it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Luke: Noah! Finally. Didn't you get my messages?",
        "Noah: Hey, yeah. I'm sorry it took so long for me to call. I just wanted to let you know I'm fine. Did you give the police the information we got from Ameera's cell?",
        "Luke: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They wrote it all down. Where are you, anyway?",
        "Noah: New York.",
        "Luke: We agreed.",
        "Noah: I know. I'm sorry. I just -- I got a weird call from Ameera.",
        "Luke: Saying what? Telling you to go to New York?",
        "Noah: She didn't say where she was, but -- but she didn't sound right, and then the line just went dead.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "Luke: Well, you could've waited for me or at least called and told me what you were doing.",
        "Noah: No, Luke. Okay? Who knows what kind of trouble Ameera's in because of my messed-up family? I didn't want to risk anything else happening to you.",
        "Luke: Look, Noah, if you're involved, I'm involved. Don't you get that? Noah? Noah!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: Would you like a cup of tea? I remember how you take it.",
        "Colonel Mayer: No. Thank you. I didn't bring you here to cook for me.",
        "Ameera: You said you needed my help.",
        "Colonel Mayer: I do.",
        "Ameera: You must know that there's -- there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. What is it that you need?",
        "Colonel Mayer: You were always such a generous person, Ameera. That's one of the things I remember most about spending time with you and -- your mother. Do you have fond memories of me from that time?",
        "Ameera: Of course. You were like a father to me.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Then can I hope to still have your trust?",
        "Ameera: My mother and I would have never survived if we hadn't trusted you.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Well, I'm asking you to trust me again, Ameera. And I'll be able to answer all your questions in just a little while.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Jack: Not now, Carly, and definitely not here.",
        "Carly: No, Jack, I just came --",
        "Jack: No, I know why you came. You came to give me the business about last night. I pushed your buttons, and you probably think it was my fault --",
        "Carly: At I think is at you should shut up and -- and take this. It's something you need to see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: So now even making breakfast for my family is wrong?",
        "Holden: No, trying to push Faith to forgive you before she's ready -- that's what's wrong.",
        "Lily: That's not what -- I was just trying to do something to tell her how sorry I am for last night. I didn't mean to embarrass her in front of her friends.",
        "Holden: Lily, you can't make things go faster than they're meant to.",
        "Lily: I am trying, Holden. I am trying so hard to get this marriage back together. But it doesn't seem like you're trying at all. It seems like you've already given up.",
        "Holden: No, that's not true.",
        "Lily: Well, could you meet me halfway? Because it feels like you're just pushing me away every chance you get.",
        "Holden: Lily, I told you, I need time. I mean, how many ways can I say it? I need time.",
        "Lily: I know you do, and I will give you all the time you need.",
        "Holden: You know what? You say that, but then the minute I don't do something you asked me to do, you blow up at me in front of our daughter. That's not the way things get back on track.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Yeah, you like that, don't you?",
        "Brad: Oh, you know I do. Don't stop.",
        "Katie: Sure you can handle it?",
        "Liberty: Okay, ew!",
        "[Brad groaning]",
        "Katie: Oh, Liberty! Hi!",
        "Liberty: Hey, you guys should really consider getting a room.",
        "Katie: We have a room. We have a whole house, actually.",
        "Brad: We have a whole house.",
        "Katie: Your father made breakfast. Have something.",
        "Brad: The most important meal of the day.",
        "Liberty: It's crispy.",
        "Brad: Is there any other way?",
        "Katie: Why don't you have something a little more substantial before you go out and do whatever it is you're gonna do today?",
        "Brad: As long as there's no boys involved.",
        "Katie: Hey, no lectures. We agreed on that, right?",
        "Brad: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: Janet said she had everything under control?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Liberty: Under control? My mom? Seriously? Dream on. That is why I have decided to come live with you guys.",
        "[ Brad coughs ]",
        "Katie: Liberty, you know we want you here. I mean, your room's just sitting there, waiting for you to fix it up.",
        "Liberty: I have been thinking of some really great ways to, like, pimp it out or --",
        "Brad: Pimp it out?",
        "Katie: We'll talk about decorating ideas later. I'm just wondering, why do you want to do this now?",
        "Brad: I mean, you said you wanted to spend as much time as you could with your mom. I mean, wouldn't that be a lot easier if you were living at the Lakeview?",
        "Liberty: Really? Living at the Lakeview? Okay, the Lakeview is like a hotel, not a home. I can't even have my friends come over there.",
        "Katie: You can always go to your friends' houses and hang out.",
        "Brad: As long as their parents are there, too.",
        "Brad: What's wrong? What?",
        "Liberty: It's my mom. She's really not helping. Like you said before, I wear too much makeup, and she lets me skip school.",
        "Katie: And you're complaining about that?",
        "Liberty: All right. I'm not stupid, okay, Katie? I know that I'm really not supposed to just get away with everything that I do. Parents are supposed to stop you, right? My mom doesn't. God, and the way that she looks and the way that she acts -- why wouldn't I make out with guys at parties?",
        "Brad: She has a point",
        "[Brad clears throat]",
        "Liberty: I don't know. I'm supposed to have a good influence, right? And my mom so isn't that.",
        "Katie: All right, let's cut to the chase. You two had a fight, didn't you, and that's why you want to move in here -- to punish her?",
        "Liberty: Yeah, well, no. My mom -- my mom and I fight all the time, but I don't move away. That's not what this is about.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: How did you even take these? Didn't see you with a camera.",
        "Carly: You're not the only one with undercover skills.",
        "[Jack laughs]",
        "Jack: Oh, look at that. I don't believe it. You actually got one of Parker smiling. The party did start off pretty well, didn't it? I'm sorry it didn't end that way.",
        "Carly: Me too.",
        "Jack: Well, thank you for these.",
        "Carly: Oh, no, keep them. I got doubles.",
        "Jack: You know, I thought when you first came in here that --",
        "Carly: You thought that I was coming for round two? I did think about it. But I decided to give you a reminder instead of some beautiful reasons we have to keep the peace.",
        "Jack: Thank you.",
        "Carly: You're welcome.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: What happened?",
        "Noah: I lost the signal. I think this spot's better.",
        "Luke: Where exactly are you?",
        "Noah: I'm at that address in Brooklyn that we got off Ameera's cell, but it's all boarded up. It looks abandoned. I'm not really sure what else to do.",
        "Luke: Well, that's easy. Come home.",
        "Noah: No, I can't. I want to try one more thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I know I lost control last night, but I can't stand this being together, not being together.",
        "Holden: I hate living like this, too.",
        "Lily: Then help me, Holden. Help us get out of this. Tell me how I can stop feeling so hurt and rejected when you can't even stand to dance with me at a party.",
        "Holden: Lily, I wasn't rejecting you. The timing -- it just wasn't right.",
        "Lily: Well, when is it gonna be right? How long is it gonna take?",
        "Holden: I don't know.",
        "Lily: You know what? I thought I could wait, but I feel you pull away from me -- physically, emotionally -- and I get so scared that if I don't do something, then I might lose you.",
        "Holden: All I'm asking here is that we take the time that we need to build that trust between us again, but we can't do that if you think that I'm rejecting you every time I --",
        "Lily: You don't want to be with me.",
        "Holden: No, no, when I say that I need space. The best thing for us to do is to just take it one day at a time. I think that that would be the best thing for all of us.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: And how long until we're too far apart to ever come together again?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: That guy from the state department.",
        "Luke: Coyle?",
        "Noah: Yeah, he might know something about why my father might have taken Ameera.",
        "Luke: You don't know that Ameera was taken to begin with.",
        "Noah: Luke, I know that something's not right, okay? That note, Ameera's call -- he might have some answers.",
        "Luke: So, are you gonna call him?",
        "Noah: The reception's not really so good here, and -- and, well, I need to stay here in case Ameera's somewhere nearby.",
        "Luke: Do you want me to call him?",
        "Noah: I know you think I'm overreacting.",
        "Luke: No, I know you're overreacting.",
        "[Luke chuckles]",
        "Luke: But if there's anything I can do that will bring you home sooner, I'm all for it. I'll track Coyle down and let you know what he says.",
        "[Luke sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Hello. I came by to see how you're doing this morning.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Carly: I don't need to ask.",
        "Lily: I pushed too hard again, first with the fight last night and then with breakfast this morning.",
        "Carly: Your husband wouldn't dance with you. Anybody would've been hurt.",
        "Lily: Yeah, but that's no excuse for the scene I made, I mean, especially in front of all those kids.",
        "Carly: Lily, don't beat yourself up. You're human.",
        "Lily: I can't give in to every impulse I have, Carly. I mean, Holden sleeps with me -- I'm over the moon. He won't dance with me -- I lash out. I have no emotional middle ground anymore.",
        "Carly: I remember going through that with Jack.",
        "Lily: How did you get through it?",
        "Carly: You know what? I don't think that you really want to go there.",
        "Lily: Oh, oh, I am willing to try anything at this point.",
        "Carly: Are you willing to say goodbye to Holden and mean it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh, ooh. Ooh, you have magic in those hands.",
        "Henry: That's so very true. Yeah, you need more than a massage, though. I'm gonna get you some more help around here.",
        "Vienna: No, Henry. We can't afford it.",
        "Henry: I'm putting my foot down, Vienna. I'm hiring another waitress.",
        "Vienna: I love it when you put your foot down. It makes my knees go weak.",
        "Henry: Ooh. I'm gonna put a notice up in the window, then, right now.",
        "Vienna: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. There's plenty of time for that later, after I've thanked you.",
        "Henry: Careful. Careful. Careful. Ohh.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: So, what did you two fight about?",
        "Liberty: I told you, Katie, it's really not about the fight. It's just about the fact that she's not the mom that I need her to be.",
        "Brad: We both know it would be better for Liberty to live with us than at the hotel -- excuse me -- just so we can keep an eye on her.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, that's true, but --",
        "Liberty: Great! I can bring my stuff by this afternoon.",
        "Katie: Oh, no, I didn't say --",
        "Liberty: Thank you so much, Katie! Thank you so much.",
        "Katie: Oh, I -- you're welcome.",
        "Liberty: I swear you will not even know that I'm here.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Katie: Okay. Can you get that, Hon?",
        "Brad: Okay, but I would rather watch my two girls bonding.",
        "[Liberty giggles]",
        "Janet: Good morning.",
        "Brad: Hi, Janet.",
        "Janet: Hi. Hi. Don't you two look cozy? Honey, why aren't you dressed yet what's going on?",
        "Liberty: Hey, Mom. Check you out. You're the only one here not in PJs.",
        "Janet: Oh. Right. Right. Well, all right. Then get up. Get dressed. I am taking you home.",
        "Liberty: I'm not going anywhere with you.",
        "Janet: Oh, well, you know, when I said, \"Take you home,\" I didn't mean \"Home\" literally. I mean, for goodness' sakes, you have got the day off, I've got time to kill, and I thought, \"The stores out there are screaming the Ciccone chicks' names,\" huh? And guess what? I already got started without you. You remember that leather skirt that you saw that you loved? Guess what. I got it for you. I did! Leather boots, too! Here, try 'em on.",
        "Liberty: Mom, you know, that's really sweet and nice of you and all, but don't you think that skirt's a little short? You know, I really don't think Dad would approve.",
        "Janet: Since when did your father decide what you're gonna wear?",
        "Liberty: Since I decided to live here with them.",
        "Janet: You what?",
        "Brad: Why don't you go get dressed? Your mom and I -- we all -- need to talk.",
        "Janet: I let her spend one night with you and this happens? You talk her into leaving me?",
        "Katie: No, it was Liberty's decision.",
        "Janet: You let a kid that age make a decision that big? What's the matter with you?",
        "Brad: Janet, Janet, just -- listen, think about it, okay? Getting maid service at the Lakeview is no kind of life for a kid. Don't you think she'd be better off being in a place where she has to pull her weight a little?",
        "Janet: Oh, my God. Are you trying to take my baby away from me?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: I just got back and you're asking me to leave already?",
        "Carly: Or ask Holden to leave. I told you you weren't ready.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "Lily: It feels like giving up to me.",
        "Carly: I only know that as long as Jack and I were living in the same house but not really married, I was on the same emotional roller coaster that you're on right now, feeling like if I breathed the wrong way, I'd lose him. Finally, when I couldn't stand it anymore, I asked him to leave.",
        "Lily: And now it's over between you.",
        "Carly: It was already over, Lily. Jack leaving just made it official. I'm not saying that would happen with you and Holden, but it is a way for you to find out where you stand.",
        "Lily: I don't think I can do it.",
        "Carly: Then don't. You have to be able to accept that things may not change between the two of you for a long time. Can you keep going like this?",
        "Lily: No. If last night showed me anything, it's that I can't make my kids pay for my mistakes.",
        "Carly: It's important that you decide what you want, not Holden. Call me anytime you need me. You know I never sleep. Hi.",
        "Holden: Hi. You look like you're feeling better.",
        "Lily: Yeah. I'm feeling a little more together.",
        "Holden: Oh. Maybe talking to Carly did some good.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Brad: Nobody is taking anyone away from anyone. You want to help me out here?",
        "Katie: Well, you'll be able to see Liberty whenever you want.",
        "Janet: No, no, that's not the point, because once I move out of the Lakeview and into something I can actually afford, it'll be too far away.",
        "[Janet scoffs]",
        "Brad: I will pay for the Lakeview as long as you want so you will still be nearby.",
        "Janet: Really, Bradley?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Oh, I always knew you were a good guy. Thank you so much! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Ohh!",
        "Katie: You're welcome, Janet.",
        "Janet: Oh, yeah, Katie, you too. Thanks. You know, I know having a teenager around is kind of tough on the whole honeymoon thing, with the loud music and the worrying, and it must be kind of a buzzkill on the love life.",
        "Katie: Oh, we'll be fine, right, Honey?",
        "Brad: Yeah.",
        "Janet: Listen, I got to -- I really need to compose myself. Do you have a -- can I --?",
        "Brad: Yeah, it's right through there, on the corner.",
        "Janet: Thanks.",
        "Brad: You know, I think that went well.",
        "Katie: Are you out of your mind?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Luke: Agent Coyle, thank you so much for meeting me.",
        "Coyle: You said something about Winston Mayer's son being in New York? When did that happen?",
        "Luke: The night before last. Ameera disappear, so Noah went to find her.",
        "Coy: But why New York?",
        "Luke: Well, Ameera left her cell phone, and we did a reverse search on one of the outgoing calls, and it led to an address in Brooklyn. Noah went to check it out.",
        "Coyle: But there's no reason to think that has anything to do with Mayer.",
        "Luke: Well, Noah thinks that the Colonel kidnapped Ameera or at least forced her to leave.",
        "Coyle: That doesn't make any sense. An escaped convict isn't gonna take the time to kidnap some girl. If Ameera's in New York, it's because she wants to be.",
        "Luke: Yeah, well, you're probably right. But don't you think there's a possibility that whoever Ameera went to see might know something about Colonel Mayer?",
        "Coyle: We've already run down all of Mayer's friends and acquaintances, and nobody lives or works in New York. But thanks for keeping me in the loop, and if you hear anything more, let me know.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Ameera: You don't need to wait on me.",
        "Colonel Mayer: Nonsense. I brought you here. I made you wait. It's the least I can do.",
        "Ameera: Can you -- can you at least tell me how much longer we have to wait?",
        "Colonel Mayer: I'll answer all your questions as soon as it's safe, Ameera. I will. Drink your tea.",
        "Ameera: As soon as it's safe? Are we in danger now?",
        "Colonel Mayer: You have nothing to worry about, Ameera. I will protect you.",
        "Ameera: Noah thinks --",
        "Colonel Mayer: I don't care what my son thinks! I sacrificed everything for him -- everything! And he turns his back on me! But you -- you would never do that, would you, Ameera? You understand loyalty. You understand making sacrifices. Drink -- drink your tea.",
        "Ameera: Colonel? I feel --",
        "Colonel Mayer: You're just a little tired. Come on. Rest, Ameera. Rest. And I will take care of you. Just rest.",

        "Holden: Hey, those new fence posts are supposed to be delivered this afternoon while I'm in town. Can you sign for them?",
        "Lily: I'd hoped we'd have a family picnic. The kids don't have school today.",
        "Holden: Maybe some other time.",
        "Lily: Sure. Some other time.",
        "Holden: So, can you sign for them?",
        "Lily: I don't think so. I don't plan on being here, Holden. I'm taking the children, and I'm moving back home. And I don't want you to come with us.",
        "Holden: So, you decided to pack up the kids and move them out without even discussing it with me?",
        "Lily: I need to focus on being the mother that they need me to be, and I can't do that if I'm constantly worried about disappointing you. They need a mother who has some semblance of control over her life and her emotions.",
        "Holden: And this is control -- moving them at the drop of a hat?",
        "Lily: Well, it's better than being a mother who embarrasses herself and them, and that's who I've become.",
        "Holden: They need a father, too.",
        "Lily: I'm not moving to the end of the world, Holden. I'm just moving back to our home. You should be happy. You're finally gonna get all the time and space that you want.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Noah: Did you reach Coyle?",
        "Luke: I did.",
        "Noah: Did you find out anything?",

        "Noah: What happened?",
        "Luke: It was like he wanted to find out what I know and dismiss it at the same time.",
        "Noah: You think he knew more than he was letting on?",
        "Luke: Maybe, maybe not. But it's too dangerous for you to be there, Noah. The most important thing is for you to get on the next plane and come back home and we can talk about it when you get here. Noah? Noah?",

        "Colonel Mayer: Why shouldn't it?",
        "Coyle: Any reason why you didn't tell me your son's in New York?",

        "Holden: We don't force this upon the kids. We let them do what they want to do. They have to decide.",

        "Katie: Liberty is totally welcome here, but that doesn't mean you have to give her mother unlimited access to our bank account.",
        "Brad: It is not going to be like that.",
        "Katie: How do you know? You start by paying Janet's bills at the Lakeview. Where does it end?",
        "Brad: I just feel like I owe her something for all those years for taking care of Liberty by herself. I mean, I wasn't there.",
        "Katie: Okay, and that is why I love you. And that is why you're so easily played.",
        "Brad: Can we just go back to the love part?",

        "Vienna: Why shouldn't I be happy? I have my darling Henry, and now -- now he's insisting on hiring someone to help me around here.",
        "Jack: Wow. You work together, you live together, and you're still on speaking terms. You guys certainly seem to have the secret.",
        "Vienna: The only secret we have is love. Can I help you?",
        "Janet: Yeah, hi. I saw a sign in the window saying you were looking for some help.",
        "Vienna: Yes, we are. What kind of experience do you have?",
        "Janet: Oh, well, that's a loaded question. [Janet laughs] Okay. Well, as far as work experience goes, I was a waitress. I was a line cook at my Cousin Gino's. That was actually the name of the restaurant. I don't actually have a Cousin Gino. I've got an Uncle Vinny, but he's in the Army, and that's a story for a different day. Anyway, what else? I was an assistant to an Illinois Senator. Oh. That -- that didn't work out so well.",
        "Vienna: No, a girl can never trust a politician.",
        "Janet: Boy, you got that right. Hey, listen, I am a really, really hard worker, and I wouldn't let you down. I really need this job, so what say you go out there and you tear down that sign and give me a shot?",
        "Vienna: No, I don't think so. I think your first job should be tearing down that sign as our new employee.",
        "Janet: Really? Oh, oh, thank you! Thank you so much! You won't regret this. I promise.",
        "Vienna: I know I won't. I have great instincts about people. So, welcome to Al's Diner, Miss-",

        "Brad: Okay, you can go. Keep your cell phone on! I'm getting pretty good at this dad thing.",

        "Jack: Well, hey, listen, I'm sorry. All I did was introduce myself. I don't see how I'm to blame.",
        "Janet: Before you opened your trap, I had a job. Once you closed it, I didn't have a job. Do you see anyone else around here to blame?",

        "Janet: I'm talking about I tried to go down to Al's Diner to get a job so that I could pay my way around here.",
        "Brad: Well, that's very nice of you.",
        "Janet: Uh, yeah, I thought so, too -- until your brother opened his big mouth and got me fired before I even waited my first table.",

        "Katie: What? What happened? How did you run into Janet?",
        "Jack: Well, I was eating at Al's, and apparently I said something that made Vienna fire her or not hire her or something.",
        "Katie: Janet was trying to get a job at Al's?",
        "Jack: Yeah. I didn't mean to step on her toes or anything, so if there's anything I can do --",
        "Katie: No, no, nothing. You actually did something good. You helped me out.",
        "Jack: Is there a reason you didn't want this Janet woman getting a job at Al's?",
        "Katie: Um, I just don't want this Janet woman getting a job anywhere in Oakdale. She's just one of those people who insinuates herself into everything, and it has to stop.",
        "Jack: Are you worried that there are still sparks between Brad and Janet?",
        "Katie: God, no. No! That doesn't mean I want her hanging around. I mean, don't get me wrong -- Liberty is a great kid. But that doesn't make her mother have a right of my family or Brad's either.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: What don't you want Vienna to hear?",
        "Brad: Janet said that Vienna gave her a job, then took it back, and I know that she thought she was being loyal to Katie, but the truth is Katie wants Janet to have a job, to make money, to be busy -- out of our hair.",
        "Henry: So, wait, wait, wait. Giving Janet a job will help you and Katie?",

        "Lily: No. No, it doesn't mean that at all, Sweetie.",
