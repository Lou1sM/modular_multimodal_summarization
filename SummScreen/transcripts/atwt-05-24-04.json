        "Margo and Tom go to Deerbrook to find out why Henry committed himself and mostly why he stole an id and left the grounds. They ask to speak with Katie, but are forbidden to do so \u0096 until Katie sneaks out of her room. She begs Margo and Tom to get Henry out of there. Sgt. Musgrove approaches Katie and tells her she's being watched and that the alien that's watching her stole his hat. Margo and Tom get Henry out, Margo now curious as to why Pilar visited Katie in the hospital. Russ threatens Pilar that he's going to spill the beans if she doesn't get him out of jail. Pilar tries to tell Mike that she wants to just let Russ go, Mike firmly against it. He talks her back into prosecuting him, Pilar receiving another call from Russ in the meantime. He tells her that she has until the morning or he's going to talk. Pilar lies, telling Mike it was the manager at the Wagon Wheel and that if she doesn't pick up her check in person, he's going to tear it up. Mike reluctantly lets Pilar go alone.",
        "Barbara confides in Walker that she's terrified to have her bandages removed in front of her children, not wanting to upset them further if she can't see. He takes them off for her and she can see, Barbara wondering why God would give her back her vision after all the heartache she's caused. Her and Walker embrace. Later, she receives flowers and asks the nurse to read the card, thinking they're from Walker, but instead they're from James. Jordan and Jennifer enjoy a passionate kiss, Jordan telling her everything. Jennifer worries about Cabot, but Jordan tells her that it's not their problem and when the two weeks is up, they can finally be together. He leaves, Jennifer calling Paul and telling him to come to BRO so they can talk about Jordan. Paul tells Jennifer that he knows nothing about the mysterious entity that is behind Roseanna and Jordan's marriage, Jennifer doubting him out loud. Paul then reassures her that Roseanna wants out of the marriage as much as Jordan does and is drawing up the paperwork as they speak. Before Paul went to see Jennifer, he and Roseanna discussed the situation, Paul finally convincing her to draw up whatever legal documents she needs and have Jordan sign them. He also advised her to leave town with Cabot and disappear. She still wanted to know if James was telling the truth about Jordan's paternity, so Paul arranges for Walker to come over to take the samples for a paternity test. Walker is suspicious as to why she doesn't want to take all the legal precautions, but gathers the data anyway. Just as he's about to leave, he warns Roseanna that she needs to tell her husband about the test and the monetary threat that instigated it. Jordan walks in at that moment and asks what Roseanna needs to tell him."

        "Tom: You know what? I'm not feeling the love. I thought dinner for two someplace other than the kitchen was supposed to lead to romance.",
        "Margo: Oh, well, nothing says love like the smell of a squad room, huh?",
        "Tom: You're a twisted woman.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well, that's why you love me, huh? Hey, you want a nightcap?",
        "Tom: 10:00 coffee? No, I'll pass. What are we doing back here anyway?",
        "Margo: Messages, Mr. District Attorney -- messages from Henry Coleman, but nothing. Your mother. My mother. My mother.",
        "Tom: She knows about Katie?",
        "Margo: No, no, no. She's got a gig on an Alaskan cruise ship, so she couldn't make it here even if she wanted to. Well, if Mohammed won't come to the mountain, the mountain will drag him in kicking and screaming.",
        "Tom: And you know what? I didn't hear that. Just cause.",
        "Margo: How about my sister Katie for just cause? There's gotta be a reason that Henry Coleman is being invisible.",
        "Tom: Maybe he got himself a real job. [Margo laughs] What? I'm an optimist.",
        "Margo: No. There's gotta be a reason that Henry Coleman is laying low.",
        "Cop: You lookin' for Henry Coleman, Detective?",
        "Margo: Yes.",
        "Cop: We had a shrink in here asking about him. He says he's AWOL from some hospital.",
        "Margo: That hospital wouldn't happen to be Deerbrook?",
        "Cop: Yeah. That sounds right.",
        "Tom: Deerbrook?",
        "Margo: Deerbrook.",

        "Nurse Rockwell: Lights out in five.",
        "Katie: Not until I see Henry.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: And you can see him, dear -- in 48 hours.",
        "Katie: Just at least tell me if he's okay.",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: Sergeant P. Mitchell Musgrove reporting for duty, ma'am.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Go to your room, Mr. Wellington.",
        "Katie: Just -- maybe I could just take a peek. I promise I won't stay long.",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: Is Captain Destiny in his tent?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Captain who?",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: I have an important communiqu\u00e9.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: I said go to your room. And you might as well do the same thing, because you are not going to see Mr. Coleman this evening. He is a very sick man. He left the grounds without permission.",
        "Katie: But he left because he was helping me!",
        "Nurse Rockwell: And now he's earned himself 48 hours in isolation. And that's the rules, no exceptions.",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: But he needs to know I found the agent! Agent 62904 from Planet Zarcon.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: It's time for evening meds. Let's go.",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: And he's watching you!",
        "Katie: Who? Who's watching me?",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: 62904! He's active in our quadrant.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: I will tell security to impound his spaceship. But now it's off to bed, Buzz Lightyear. You, too. March.",
        "Katie: No. I'm not marching anywhere until I see Henry.",

        "Pilar: Hello.",
        "Russ: You were supposed to get me out of here, remember?",
        "Pilar: I'm working on it, Russ. I am, but Mike insists on testifying.",
        "Russ: Oh, yeah? Well, I can insist, too. How would you like to see your plan to get busted wide open?",
        "Pilar: No! Please, Russ. It won't be much longer.",
        "Russ: I'm hanging up, Pilar.",
        "Pilar: Russ, no! Tonight I will talk to Mike.",
        "Mike: This place looks great. What's the occasion? Are you okay?",
        "Pilar: Michael, we need to talk -- about Russ.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Walker: You paged?",
        "Barbara: I hope I didn't disturb you.",
        "Walker: No, no, no, not at all. Are you okay? Any pain?",
        "Barbara: No, no. Nothing like that. It's just, I've been thinking. Jennifer and Paul want to be here tomorrow when these bandages come off. And if I still can't see, I don't want them here when I find out. I want to be able to fall apart by myself. I don't want to have to be brave.",
        "Walker: I understand.",
        "Barbara: So we'll take them off tonight, while I'm alone?",
        "Walker: I'll take the bandages off, Barbara. But I'm not gonna let you deal with this alone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Sorry, he's a little cranky. A tooth is coming in. It started happening while he was away.",
        "Paul: You have so much to deal with. I'm so sorry that this all got more complicated for you.",
        "Rosanna: Maybe James is lying. Maybe Jordan isn't his biological father.",
        "Paul: He's not lying.",
        "Rosanna: How can you be sure?",
        "Paul: I'm sure because I'm in the middle of it now. And that's exactly where James wants me to be. He set this whole thing in motion, Rosanna -- the wedding, the adoption papers, right up to this big knockout punch. He knew that you were gonna call me and that I'd get you in to see him. Obviously, he wanted to see the look on both of our faces when he dropped the bomb about Cabot being Jordan's son.",
        "Rosanna: Well, why didn't he just reunite Jordan with his son then?",
        "Paul: And pass up the chance to wreak so much havoc in so many lives? You don't know my father. Look, we gotta move fast on this. I mean, get a DNA test if you feel like you need confirmation, but we gotta move quickly on this, Rosanna.",
        "Rosanna: If Jordan finds out that Cabot is his biological child, then I won't have a legal leg to stand on. He could just walk out the door with him!",
        "Paul: I swear to you, by the time Jordan knows the truth, there won't be a thing he or my father can do about it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Jordan: I just don't know if this is fair.",
        "Jennifer: It's only unfair if you don't really care about me. And I think you do.",
        "Jordan: Of course I do.",
        "Jennifer: And you don't love Rosanna.",
        "Jordan: No, no. The marriage is a lie.",
        "Jennifer: Then why did you marry her?",
        "Jordan: Jen, there were a thousand reasons not to do it, but there was only one good reason to go through with it. And it wasn't love. You have to believe that. Being with you is all I ever wanted from the moment that I saw you.",
        "Jennifer: Then you have to leave her. Tell Rosanna it's over, tonight.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Tom: This is the day room, right?",
        "Margo: Yeah. But there doesn't seem to be anyone here.",
        "Tom: Let's go see if there's somebody on the floor. Oh.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Can I help you?",
        "Margo: Yes. We were told that Katie Frasier was supposed to be here.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Oh, I'm sorry, it's past visiting hours.",
        "Margo: Oh, I'm her sister, Margo Hughes.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: You do realize that Mrs. Frasier isn't approved for family visits.",
        "Tom: Is she in her room?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: All of our patients are down for the night.",
        "Margo: Well, then, you'll have to make an exception.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Any visits must be preapproved by Dr. Tanner.",
        "Margo: You know, I think we have a little lack of communication here, Nurse Rockwell. I am Detective Margo Hughes, and this is my husband, District Attorney Thomas Hughes.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Then you two should know how it works with involuntary commitment. Your sister has been given a sedation. I'm sure she's asleep by now.",
        "Tom: Why was she sedated?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Mrs. Frasier insisted on seeing another patient. She became quite agitated.",
        "Margo: Wait. What other patient?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: I can't release that information.",
        "Margo: Uh-huh. Was he early 30s, about 6'2\", 175, hazel eyes, sandy hair, sly smile, speaks faster than the speed of light? Huh?",
        "Tom: Probably goes by the name Henry Coleman. How long has he been here?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: He was admitted the same day as your sister. Now, he is a very sick man. He suffers from delusions --",
        "Margo: Well, yeah, he's a con man. But crazy? I don't know. That's debatable. Okay, so if Henry is here, he's here because Katie is here.",
        "Tom: Yeah, I think we'd like to see him.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Well, you'll have to come back after the mandatory isolation period.",
        "Margo: What mandatory isolation period?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: He left the grounds. He stole an I.D. Badge and went on a little unauthorized field trip.",
        "Tom: Perhaps you misunderstood my wife. We would like to see him tonight.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: It's out of the question.",
        "Tom: Okay. Then I'll be back with a court order.",
        "Margo: And I'll be back with a couple of men in case it's still \"out of the question.\"",
        "Margo: Now would you bring us Henry Coleman?",
        "Tom: Or we could turn the place upside-down looking for him.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Pilar: The assistant district attorney called earlier to talk about my testimony.",
        "Mike: Is that what got you upset?",
        "Pilar: Do you know how it feels to have your character constantly questioned? First with Katie accusing me of wanting to hurt you. And now with this trial.",
        "Mike: I don't see how they're connected.",
        "Pilar: My attorney said it would be rough for me in court. She said Russ' attorney will paint me as a liar, or worse.",
        "Mike: The jury will see through that.",
        "Pilar: The jury doesn't know me the way you do! I'm finally happy again, Michael. To be given this second chance with you -- I don't want anything to ruin this for us.",
        "Mike: Putting away Russ won't ruin anything.",
        "Pilar: And what happens when he's released?",
        "Mike: We'll worry about that when the time comes.",
        "Pilar: You're not listening! Maybe there's another way. Maybe we can make a deal with him.",
        "Mike: What kind of deal?",
        "Pilar: We could refuse to testify. And in return, we could get Russ to swear that he will never come near us again.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: Are you finally ready to tell me why you married a woman you don't love?",
        "Jordan: Yes. Yes. I don't want us to keep any secrets from each other anymore, Jen. Rosanna told me that the only way for her to get her son back was if she married me -- me, nobody else.",
        "Jennifer: That doesn't make sense.",
        "Jordan: I know. She convinced me that if people didn't believe that we were getting married for all the right reasons, that the deal would be off and her son would be gone. I wanted to tell you before the ceremony, but she begged me not to.",
        "Jennifer: You two hardly even knew each other. Why you?",
        "Jordan: I don't know.",
        "Jennifer: Okay. Well, she has her son. You know, and a lot of single women adopt children.",
        "Jordan: Wait, wait, wait. It gets weirder. When she got the final set of adoption papers, my name was already on it. I had to sign on as Cabot's legal parent.",
        "Jennifer: So first her husband, then her baby's father?",
        "Jordan: And if that wasn't bad enough, there was a codicil to the agreement that Rosanna and I had to stay married for two years for her to keep legal and binding custody of the baby.",
        "Jennifer: Two years? Two years?! Whose rules are these, Rosanna's?",
        "Jordan: No. I don't think she has any more control over it than I do. She keeps going on about some mysterious and powerful figure, I don't know. You know what? And I'm tired of feeling guilty about someone else's baby.",
        "Jennifer: You know what? Rosanna has an army of lawyers. Why can't they just help her figure out who this mysterious person is?",
        "Jordan: Well, they're gonna have to. Because I am through with this. I gave her an ultimatum. I gave Rosanna two weeks to nail down custody of Cabot. Because after that, I am gone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Look at us. My hands won't stop shaking. You're as steady as a rock.",
        "Paul: I don't know about that. I've fought this battle with James my entire life.",
        "Rosanna: But if James wants Jordan to know the truth --",
        "Paul: Well, James would want to do it on his clock. And that's good. That gives us some time. Not a lot of time, but that does give us some time.",
        "Rosanna: Jordan's name is already on the adoption papers.",
        "Paul: So we'll draw up some new papers. Have your lawyer draw up an annulment and a document dissolving all of Jordan's parental rights. And then you go to Jordan and you tell him that you reached some kind of compromise with the person who set all this up. And then Jordan is now free to go.",
        "Rosanna: Won't he question the sudden turnaround?",
        "Paul: Well, he might at first, but we've got an ace in the hole. That's Jennifer. Jordan is starting to have feelings for her. So you -- you do this huge mea culpa. You say you've been grossly unfair and you can't live with yourself anymore and you have to make things right and let him go.",
        "Rosanna: What if James gets to him first?",
        "Paul: He won't. Because you are going to contact a lawyer that you know and trust. You're gonna shore up your legal rights to Cabot and -- this is the hard part -- you've got to get your travel documents together.",
        "Rosanna: What are you saying? You're telling me to run?",
        "Paul: Yes. As far and as fast as you can. And this time, Rosanna, there'll be no turning back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Spanish]",
        "Margo: That was pretty smooth, right? Court order?",
        "Tom: An army of men?",
        "Margo: Got her going though. Got her going.",
        "Tom: So Henry's here because that's where they're keeping Katie.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm. But what's up with that little day trip, huh?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: I've paged Dr. Tanner. You can take up your request with him.",
        "Margo: Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Well, we make a pretty good tag team, huh?",
        "Tom: Oh, don't talk wrestling unless you can back it up.",
        "Margo: Okay. Let's get back to Katie. Now if Henry's here because of her --",
        "Tom: Then my guess is it's connected to Mike by proxy.",
        "Margo: And to Pilar by association.",
        "Katie: Margo?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: Forget it. No deals. You don't negotiate with a guy like Russ Terry.",
        "Pilar: Mike, please. He'll go away. I know he will.",
        "Mike: How do you know?",
        "Pilar: We'll prosecute if he doesn't.",
        "Mike: The D.A. won't touch him again if we let him walk now. Then what?",
        "Pilar: Russ is a coward. He won't bother me as long as you're around.",
        "Mike: He broke in here. He assaulted you. He's guilty. I was a witness. Russ Terry doesn't have a prayer of getting off.",
        "Pilar: But he has friends, Mike! People owe him favors!",
        "Mike: Is that it? Have these friends threatened you?",
        "Pilar: You don't see any other way but your way!",
        "Mike: You can't go around the law.",
        "Pilar: The law isn't perfect! I know you want to protect me, but I have to do what I feel is right for me. I'm sorry if you don't like it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Any words of advice?",
        "Walker: Be patient.",
        "Barbara: Oh, we both know how good I am at that.",
        "Walker: Just because your eyesight doesn't come back right away doesn't mean it won't in time.",
        "Barbara: But that wouldn't be a good sign, would it?",
        "Walker: It's not necessarily bad. I want you to take a couple deep breaths. Now, if you see anything, it's probably gonna be blurry at first. Your eyes are gonna take time to adjust to the light. You ready?",
        "Barbara: I'm ready.",
        "Walker: Now, remember, it's still early in your recovery. Anything?",
        "Barbara: I'd forgotten how handsome you are, Dr. Daniels. Especially those dimples. Oh, my God! Thank you!",
        "Walker: Ben's the real hero.",
        "Barbara: Oh, no, you were with me every step of the way.",
        "Walker: Let's take a look.",
        "Barbara: How do they look?",
        "Walker: Beautiful.",
        "Barbara: Is that your professional opinion?",
        "Walker: Yep. I'm gonna note it on your chart. What is it?",
        "Barbara: Who am I that God would answer my prayers? After everything that I have done, everything that I have been through, to have my health and my children, even my business.",
        "Walker: What does a man have to do to get on that list?",
        "Barbara: You didn't let me finish.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: What if Rosanna can't fix things in two weeks?",
        "Jordan: That's not my problem.",
        "Jennifer: But I mean, it sounds like she's pretty afraid that this powerful person is calling all the shots. You know, I wonder if my dad could help. You know I should talk to him --",
        "Jordan: No, no, no. That's not a good idea.",
        "Jennifer: Well, why not?",
        "Jordan: Well, what am I gonna say -- \"oh, hi. Lieutenant Munson, I'm crazy about your daughter, but -- oh, I forgot to tell you that I'm married and I had to adopt my wife's son\"? That's not the impression that I want to make.",
        "Jennifer: Yeah, but he might be able to find out who this mysterious stranger is. I mean, do you really think this person even exists?",
        "Jordan: I don't know what to think. I mean, I can't trust anything that Rosanna says. And now that Paul's involved, too, it's --",
        "Jennifer: Paul's involved?",
        "Jordan: Well, yeah. Yeah, he and Rosanna are friends again.",
        "Jennifer: She hates him!",
        "Jordan: No, no, no. Not since he saved Cabot from the fire. And you know, Paul has never really been my biggest fan. And now, if he and Rosanna are aligned, I just don't get a good feeling about it. So we have to be careful.",
        "Jennifer: I want to help.",
        "Jordan: No, you can't help. I have asked all the questions 100 times over. I never get a straight answer, and neither will you. All I care about now is results. And Rosanna has two weeks to deliver. And once she does that, I will be free, and we can be together. That's -- that's all that I want.",
        "Jennifer: I want that too, but --",
        "Jordan: Jen, Jen -- just let me handle this, okay? Promise me that you won't go running for the exits.",
        "Jennifer: I'm part Ryan. We don't shock that easily. But we do like to be right. And I have never been more right than I am now.",
        "Jordan: About what?",
        "Jennifer: About the kind of guy you are. You sacrificed yourself for that baby. And maybe I should be angry, but mostly, I'm just very happy.",
        "Jordan: Good. I want to make sure that you stay that way. Okay. From now on, it's just you and me. Nobody else matters.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: I'm at Rosanna Cabot's suite at the Lakeview. You can call me back on this number -- this is my cell -- or you can reach her through the switchboard here. Thank you. Thank you so much. Right. Dr. Daniels is gonna call back.",
        "Rosanna: I really hate involving anybody else.",
        "Paul: Walker can keep a secret. Trust me.",
        "Rosanna: So he'll do the DNA test?",
        "Paul: All we can do is ask. You're gonna need a DNA sample from Jordan.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I can get that. I'll use his toothbrush or something.",
        "Paul: Don't ever think about this. You gotta start thinking past this test, beyond that, to your new life, your new identity. Think about Cabot. Never again are you gonna miss his tooth coming in or -- you'll be there for his first steps. He's gonna call you \"Mama.\"",

        "Paul: Hello?",
        "Jennifer: Paul, it's me. I really need to talk to you.",
        "Paul: Jen, I'm in the middle of something. Can I call you back?",
        "Jennifer: I need you to come to the office right now. It's about Jordan.",
        "Paul: Okay. I'll be right there. [Paul sighs] That was Jennifer. She wants to talk to me about Jordan.",
        "Rosanna: Do you think Jordan told her everything?",
        "Paul: Oh, I hope so. I hope that the two of them are so into each other that he can't see past the stars in his eyes.",
        "Rosanna: What if James gets to him first?",
        "Paul: By the time James plays his ace, you'll be long gone. Jordan can mount all the legal challenges he wants. You'll be off somewhere raising Cabot in peace. And I'll be here, watching your back.",
        "Rosanna: But James will come after you.",

        "Katie: I'm fine.",
        "Tom: The nurse said they sedated you.",
        "Katie: No, I haven't taken a single pill since Henry got here.",
        "Tom: Katie, why is Henry at Deerbrook?",
        "Katie: Because he was worried about me, so he checked himself in.",
        "Tom: But they said he sneaked out. Where did he go?",
        "Katie: If I tell you that, you're gonna think he's crazy. That's how it works, right? Everybody's crazy except for Pilar. She's the one with criminal friends and fake poison, but I'm the loop job.",
        "Margo: Will you just tell us about Henry, please.",
        "Katie: Well, he's a doll to be in here, but Margo, you got to get him out of here. I'm scared. I'm afraid for him. He can't make it in here, and now that he's on Rockwell's bad side --",
        "Margo: Wait a moment. Why did he con his way out of here? Where did he go?",
        "Katie: He can tell you himself. But don't arrest him.",
        "Margo: Why would I arrest him?",
        "Katie: He's got a lead, and I just don't want you to charge him with tampering with official whatever.",
        "Margo: You know, Katie, I'm worried about you. I'm worried about both of you.",
        "Katie: I'm fine. I just -- if Nurse Rockwell finds out that I'm not in bed, she's gonna stick me, and there's nothing I can do to outsmart a needle. Just talk to Henry, and when you do, please, don't be a cop. Just be my sister.",
        "Margo: All right, all right. I will.",
        "Katie: Okay, thank you!",
        "Margo: All right. Who was that?",

        "Nurse Rockwell: Yes.",
        "Tom: Could I have a look at that, please?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: I'm sorry.",
        "Margo: Would you just give him the damn chart! Henry, Henry, do you know who you are? Do you know who you are? Do you know who I am? Henry?",
        "Tom: Honey, you're not going to believe this. Mr. Coleman, he's a voluntary patient.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: That's right.",
        "Tom: Means he can sign himself out any time he wants.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: When he is well. That does not include unauthorized trips.",
        "Margo: Well, I think that Mr. Coleman would like to sign himself out. Now don't you, Mr. District Attorney?",
        "Tom: I think he's definitely ready.",
        "Margo: That is what you want to do, isn't it Henry?",
        "Nurse Rockwell: You have no authorization to speak for this patient.",
        "Tom: You get me a set of release papers with Mr. Coleman's name on it ready to sign.",
        "Nurse Rockwell: Dr. Tanner will never allow this.",
        "Tom: If Dr. Tanner has a problem with a sane, able-bodied patient checking himself out of this institution, you tell him he can take that up with the district attorney.",
        "Margo: Just get the release papers, and also, would you get a cup of coffee for Mr. Coleman -- black. I think he could use it, don't you?",

        "Walker: Pleased to meet you, Ms. Cabot.",
        "Rosanna: Very nice to meet you. Please, call me Rosanna.",

        "Rosanna: No, no, he's not. Um, he called you for me.",
        "Walker: Oh. Paul said he needed a favor.",
        "Rosanna: Yes, yes. He was calling for me -- to do a favor for me. Won't you sit down, please?",
        "Walker: Sure.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, so I have something I need to ask of you -- a favor. I'm not exactly sure how to ask.",
        "Walker: Well, is it a health issue?",
        "Rosanna: Well, in a manner of speaking. Um, I have an adopted child, a child that I love very much, and it turns out recently someone has made a claim that they are his biological father.",
        "Walker: You don't know if it's true?",
        "Rosanna: No, I don't. I've had a lot of experience with people trying to extort money or favors from me. And I'd simply like to find out whether this claim has merit.",
        "Walker: Well, that shouldn't be difficult. I'm sure your lawyers can get a court order for a paternity test.",
        "Rosanna: No. Uh, you don't understand. My son and I would prefer not to have any publicity. We'd like to handle this matter privately.",
        "Walker: Well, if you want my recommendation, I would do a full DNA study. But somehow you're gonna have to get this man's permission.",
        "Rosanna: No, I hope you don't mind. I feel this is more preemptive. I'd like to screen his DNA without his knowledge. Would you do that for me?",

        "Jennifer: Jordan told me everything! The marriage is a sham, and he's getting out.",
        "Paul: Is that his version or Rosanna's?",
        "Jennifer: Well, you tell me. I hear you and Rosanna are buddies again.",
        "Paul: I see he didn't leave out any of the details.",
        "Jennifer: He told me that Rosanna begged him to marry her so she could get her baby back.",
        "Paul: What does this have to do with me, Jen?",
        "Jennifer: I want to know what Rosanna really wants from Jordan.",
        "Paul: Rosanna already got everything she wants from Jordan.",
        "Jennifer: But why did she have to marry him? Why not you or Craig even, or anyone else?",
        "Paul: I have no idea.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan told her that he wants out. Now, is she gonna let him go?",
        "Paul: Don't you think that Jordan should be having this conversation with Rosanna?",
        "Jennifer: He has! She knows where he stands.",
        "Paul: Well then, what's to worry about? Jen, look, I'm gonna tell you this because I love you, and you're my sister, and I don't think Rosanna wants this all over town. But she plans to cut Jordan loose as soon as possible.",
        "Jennifer: Are you sure about that?",
        "Paul: Yes. Rosanna told me herself. Jordan did a lot for Rosanna. Rosanna owes him. She knows that. But my guess is that he'll be a free man before you know it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Little bit more, please -- please? How is he going to sign a release paper if he can't even sip coffee?",
        "Margo: Don't worry. He'll sign, he'll sign.",

        "Henry: You -- you ladies come here often?",
        "Katie: Oh, no, Henry, please be okay. Please be okay. I don't know what I would do if I --",
        "Margo: It's all right, it's all right. We'll get the drugs out of his system.",
        "Katie: What did they give him?!",
        "Tom: I read it on the chart, but I didn't recognize it.",
        "Katie: Oh God, I did this to you. I'm so sorry. Is he going to be okay? Do you think he's gonna be okay?",
        "Margo: He's gonna be fine, Katie. Would you just tell us what you and Henry were up to?",
        "Katie: Us? Your friend Pilar's the one who's been making the rounds lately.",
        "Margo: What, you've seen Pilar?",
        "Katie: She's seen me.",
        "Margo: What, here? Why?",
        "Katie: You mean why would she come visit someone she's so afraid of that she jumps into Mike's arms every time she thinks I'm in the neighborhood?",
        "Margo: Well, what did she want?",
        "Katie: To twist the knife. She showed me a picture of her and Mike in bed together. And no, I'm not imagining it. You can check the visitor logs or the security cameras. She was here.",
        "Margo: Why would she do anything so cruel?",
        "Katie: Because she's evil, Margo! I don't even care if you don't believe me anymore. Please, just get Henry out of here! He'll tell you where he's been and what he's been up to and the biggest clue is right under your nose, but you think I'm so far off the deep end that you won't listen to me. I mean, I could sit here and tell you everything that's in my heart, but you'll still give me that look like, \"poor Katie, I hope the doctors can help her.\"",
        "Margo: All right, what clue?! And I didn't say I didn't believe you.",
        "Tom: There is no evidence that she's done anything.",
        "Katie: There's plenty of evidence if you look in the right places.",
        "Henry: Bubbles?",
        "Katie: Oh, I'm here, Henry. It's me. You're gonna go home now, okay? You're going to see Snickers and Faux. Back to the cottage, okay?",
        "Henry: Home?",
        "Katie: Yeah. You guys, just get him out of here and make sure he's okay. But most importantly, listen to him before it's too late. I still don't know what Pilar has planned for Mike. And let me tell you, it could be worse than this stay in the funny farm.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Mike: I believed you. I saw what that guy did to you, and I supported you.",
        "Pilar: And I will always be grateful.",
        "Mike: I watched Katie get hauled off to a mental hospital because she thought you and Russ were out to get me. Okay, I told her she was sick --",
        "Pilar: She is sick! This has nothing to do with Katie.",
        "Mike: The point is, I have backed you up on everything! Okay, I have put myself on the line. But now you want me to forget that Russ threatened to kill you? I can't do that.",
        "Pilar: I'm sorry.",
        "Mike: Pilar, you don't even have to look at him in the courtroom. But if you don't stand up to him now, it's all been for nothing.",
        "Pilar: All right. I'll do it, for you.",
        "Mike: No, no, do it for yourself. Once we testify against Russ, he can't hurt you. You've got to believe that.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Walker, this man has no interest in me or my son. He's simply trying to take advantage of my family.",
        "Walker: I would still need a sample.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I could get you a toothbrush or a hair brush.",
        "Walker: The problem with doing it this way is that you tie your hands. I mean, anything we learn, you can't use in court.",
        "Rosanna: That's okay. I'm not interested in going to court.",
        "Walker: You sure?",
        "Rosanna: Yes. Cabot is asleep. You could get his sample now.",
        "Walker: All right. This shouldn't disturb him.",
        "Rosanna: Great. Oh, sorry about that. Those are my husband's. We're still getting used to whose things go where.",
        "Walker: Newlyweds?",
        "Rosanna: Yes.",
        "Walker: Does your husband know that you contacted me?",
        "Rosanna: You know, he doesn't. And if you don't mind, I'd like to keep it that way.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jennifer: There's still something else that I don't understand. Jordan says the marriage and the adoption were somebody else's idea, not Rosanna's, and supposedly she was just going along with what she was told. Well, if that's true, who's pulling the strings?",
        "Paul: I don't know.",
        "Jennifer: Does Rosanna know?",
        "Paul: If she knows, she hasn't mentioned anything to me. Rosanna has Cabot back. It's everything she ever wanted. She's not going to go asking questions or looking for problems where none exist.",
        "Jennifer: Don't you find all this a little convenient, Paul -- wedding, baby, annulment, an interested party who put it all together that doesn't have a face or a name?",
        "Paul: Convenient? No, I don't find any of this convenient for anybody. Look, Rosanna got in your way. Deliberately or not, I don't know. But she's basically a good person, and she's trying to put her life back together, and she's trying to fix it so that Jordan and she can get out of this marriage with everything they both ever wanted.",
        "Jennifer: All he wants is his freedom!",
        "Paul: And you, obviously.",
        "Jennifer: Jordan said that there was a document stipulating that they had to stay married for two years.",
        "Paul: Mm-hmm. Rosanna's lawyers are working on that. They're drawing up an annulment right now. Come on, nobody's going to force anybody to stay married. That's insane.",
        "Jennifer: Why should I believe you, Paul? You lied to Mom about B.R.O. for months. And up until about five minutes ago, you couldn't stand Jordan. And now you're acting like he's the best thing that ever happened to me.",
        "Paul: Jennifer, after everything that happened with Rose, the last thing I will ever do is judge who belongs with who. I want you to be happy. And if being with Jordan is what makes you happy, then I want you to be with him.",
        "Jennifer: Come on, Paul. There's got to be more to it than that. If you really want me to be happy, you'll tell me what it is.",

        "Pilar: Can't you just mail my paycheck?",
        "Russ: Kasnoff's around?",
        "Pilar: Yes. I understand.",
        "Russ: Well, did you get him to back down?",
        "Pilar: Not yet. I need more time.",
        "Russ: Time's up, Pilar. Tomorrow morning, I'm grabbing the first cop I can find, and we're gonna have us a nice little heart-to-heart talk. Sleep tight!",
        "Mike: What was that about?",
        "Pilar: The manager of the Wagon Wheel. He wants me to pick up my last paycheck. He said if I don't come, he'll tear it up.",
        "Mike: Fine. You don't need his aggravation.",
        "Pilar: No, I earned that money. I'm not giving it up to anyone.",
        "Mike: All right, I'll drive you.",
        "Pilar: No, I'll -- I'll be fine.",
        "Mike: I don't want you around that sleaze bag.",
        "Pilar: I can take care of myself. I have my phone if I need you. I won't be long.",

        "Both: As in \"good man.\"",

        "Margo: Good, then we'll be happy to take him off your hands, all right?",
        "Tom: Honey, I'm going to bring the car up front, all right?",
        "Henry: Bartender, toss me my keys.",
        "Tom: Nah. You stick with me, Henry. I'm the designated driver tonight.",
        "Henry: Another round for everybody!",
        "Nurse Rockwell: I'll walk the patient to the car. It's hospital procedure.",
        "Margo: Just, I want you to tell my sister that everybody loves her. She is a wonderful, wonderful girl. I don't think she knows how much all of us love her.",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: Where are they taking Captain Destiny?",
        "Katie: Oh, uh, he got an honorable discharge, Sergeant. You should probably get back to your room. If nurse -- where's your helmet?",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: He took it.",
        "Katie: Who took it?",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: The Zarconian intruder.",
        "Katie: The guy who's supposedly watching me? Oh, it's okay. It's okay, don't worry. We'll find it tomorrow, okay.",
        "Sgt. Musgrove: But without my helmet, I am not protected!",
        "Katie: Oh, it's okay. I'll protect you. You don't have anything to be afraid of anymore.",

        "Nurse's aide: These just arrived for you, Ms. Ryan.",
        "Barbara: Oh, they're gorgeous. Why don't you put them right there so I can just look at them. And if you wouldn't mind reading the card for me, because things are a little fuzzy.",
        "Nurse's aide: Sure.",
        "Barbara: I think I know who they're from anyway.",

        "Jennifer: Oh, well, maybe you're doing the plotting for her these days.",
        "Paul: My copy of \"Paranoia for Dummies\" is officially retired. Is that a smile? Are you gonna smile? You can smile, Jen. Everything's great. Mom's getting better. You're falling in love. At least that's what it looks like to me. Okay, look, I admit it. I was jealous of the guy. He shows up, and all of a sudden, Mom can't pick out a fabric swatch without talking to him. But I'm past that. I've moved on. And after everything that Jordan did for Rosanna, I gotta give it to him. He showed real character.",
        "Jennifer: And anyone in our family is a good judge of character?",
        "Paul: Jennifer, we are wired to expect the worst. But don't let that keep you from what's best for you.",
        "Jennifer: So you think Rosanna is ready to let him go?",
        "Paul: All right, if you don't believe anything that I ever say to you, believe me when I tell you this. Rosanna doesn't want to be tied to Jordan any more than he wants to be tied to her.",

        "Walker: This toothbrush, Rosanna, isn't his? You're not trying to rule him out as the biological father?",
        "Rosanna: No. Why would I do that? I've told you, Cabot is adopted. Why would I have a problem being married to his biological father?",
        "Walker: I don't know. I just somehow sense it could be.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no. This challenge is coming from someone whose sole purpose is to extort money from me and from my family.",
        "Walker: Well, your motives are your business. But whatever it's about, I would talk to your husband about it.",
