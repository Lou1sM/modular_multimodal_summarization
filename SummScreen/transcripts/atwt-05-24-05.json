        "Carly comes to the station to bring Jack his lunch and they touch upon Les, but a guard interrupts them to speak to Jack about the van accident that killed Les. The guard is sure he heard two pops before the tire blew. Jack listens, but is sure it is nothing. Later when he tells Carly, she is less inclined to blow it off. She thinks Keith had a lot to gain by Les dying. Jack and she disagree about this, but are later interrupted by Keith who tells them that he has decided to stay in Oakdale, but wants JJ to live with Jack and Carly from now on. Carly baits Jack into telling Keith about what the guard said, but Jack changes the subject. After they have an argument about what is Carly and Keith's business when it comes to police information, but Jack later apologizes, and they head off to give JJ the good news. Keith and Lily decide to move forward with their relationship as Keith decides to move to Oakdale. Lily discusses her new relationship with Luke, who questions it because he believes Holden still loves her, but agrees to support her as long as Lily takes it slow. Meanwhile, Dusty meets with Lucinda because she wants his help to get rid of Keith because she is worried about his owing money to the mob. Dusty tells her that he doesn't want to get involved, to Lucinda's ire, but later goes to Lily's house to warn her that she is in more trouble then she may realize. Emily and Paul further discuss his inability to let go of memories and items he kept throughout his relationship with Rosanna. Emily wants Paul to get rid of them and move on, so they prepare to set the items on fire. James continues to taunt Rosanna with her losing her son because of her behavior towards him. He takes her up in a plane and tries to push her out of a door in front of Cabot, but Craig stops him by hitting him from behind. Rosanna and Craig toy with killing James, but in the end Rosanna can't go through with it. Craig has paid off the pilot as well as James' nanny, and they turn the plane around, and the police end up taking James away. However, James leaves Rosanna with more threats that no jail could hold him and he will always find her. Craig offers to take her and Cabot away for good, but Rosanna turns him down, promising she knows what she now has to do."

        "Carly: Here's your lunch. I threw in an extra pickle and a cookie that Sage decorated. She was very cute.",
        "Jack: Oh, thank you. As cute as her mommy? Hmm? It was great to go walking with you this morning. It's great to have you out and about again.",
        "Carly: Maybe that's because I finally got a good night's sleep.",
        "Jack: No more nightmares?",
        "Carly: Nope. I haven't pictured Les lurking in the shadows since he died in that crash.",
        "Jack: He's gone for real this time, honey. >From here on out, things are just gonna get better and better.",
        "Carly: Thanks, g-man.",
        "Guard #1: Can I talk to you a minute, Detective?",
        "Jack: Sure. Why don't you wait in the interrogation room? And so it begins.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Jack: What can I do for you?",
        "Guard #1: Well, you've done a lot already. You pulled me from that crash, detective. Saved my life.",
        "Jack: That's nothing you wouldn't have done for me. I'm just glad I got there in time. It's crazy to think how much damage can come from a simple blowout. I mean, I guess no matter how much time you devote to maintenance, you just can't count on everything.",
        "Guard #1: That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Something's been bugging me all night.",
        "Jack: About the accident?",
        "Guard #1: If it was an accident.",
        "Jack: What do you mean?",
        "Guard #1: Right before the tire blew, I'm pretty sure I heard something. It sounded like two loud pops.",
        "Jack: So, you're saying you don't think the accident was an accident at all?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Keith: Hi.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry I didn't return your call. I was -- I was in the shower.",
        "Keith: Well, I -- I should have called.",
        "Lily: No, no, no. No, it's okay. Come on. Come on in. Come on.",
        "Keith: Shower, huh?",
        "Lily: Yeah. Can I get you something? Coffee, iced tea?",
        "Keith: Um, well, you could probably use a little coffee.",
        "Lily: Me?",
        "Keith: Yeah.",
        "Lily: Why?",
        "Keith: Well, because, um -- I don't think you slept. Your light was on all night.",
        "Lily: I had a lot to think about. I told Holden that we should move ahead with the divorce.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lucinda: Okay, good morning. Have a seat. Coffee is on the way.",
        "Dusty: Is there any reason we're not doing this at your office?",
        "Lucinda: Yes, as a matter of fact. This is one room where I can be sure that no one's gonna overhear us.",
        "Dusty: Is this is about Street Jeans?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, no. Nothing about the jean factory.",
        "Dusty: What's going on?",
        "Lucinda: I need your advice.",
        "Dusty: You want my advice? You want my advice?",
        "Lucinda: I'm a realist, so I accept the fact that there are areas where your expertise surpasses mine.",
        "Dusty: Mm-hmm. Okay. Hit me, I'm ready.",
        "Lucinda: I want to know how to get rid of someone, for good.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Emily: Hi.",
        "Paul: Hi.",
        "Emily: I got your message, something about picking up some flowers?",
        "Paul: Yeah, the honeymooners couldn't deal with it, so Lucinda dumped all this stuff on me. I got rid of most of them, or a lot of them, anyway. I mean, you should have seen this place an hour ago.",
        "Emily: It must have looked like Easter Sunday around here.",
        "Paul: It looked like a funeral home. Pick out which ones you want, and put them in your car.",
        "Emily: Wait, wait. Clearly, you did not call me over here just to pick up flowers. Something's obviously going on. You're gonna tell me what it is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Baby crying]",
        "Rosanna: Cabot! Cabot? It's Mommy, sweetheart. Where is he? Where is my baby?",
        "James: Do you think I would expose a child of mine to a woman who has so little self-respect? Get up.",
        "[Rosanna sighs]",
        "Rosanna: I heard him. What have you done with him?",
        "James: Little Jimmy is safe, happy and healthy, in the arms of his nanny.",
        "Rosanna: I heard him crying.",
        "James: You know, you've been sleeping on a damp floor. Maybe you've been having nightmares. Or maybe you've just lost your mind. [Clapping] Get her ready.",
        "Rosanna: Ready? Ready for what?",
        "James: Well, darling, there's no fun unless there's a little mystery.",
        "Rosanna: What are you doing with me? I have a right to know.",
        "James: You have a right to know, so you can leave a trail of breadcrumbs for your pathetic ex? Even the dimwitted Montgomery realizes that you're more trouble than you're worth.",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean?",
        "James: Well, now, think. What is four feet wide and six feet deep, and causes everyone grave concern?",
        "Rosanna: I thought you were taking me to a work camp?",
        "James: Well, no, you see, those plans are changed, because my friend realizes that you really fit for the kind of work that he had in mind. So I refunded him fully.",
        "Rosanna: Where are you taking me?",
        "James: To meet someone.",
        "Rosanna: Who?",
        "James: Your maker.",
        "Rosanna: No. Help! Somebody help! Don't! Don't! Help! Please, help! Somebody help me!",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: You're kidding me, right?",
        "Lucinda: No. Never been more serious in my life.",
        "Dusty: Hiring a killer is not in my job description.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, please. I don't want you to kill Keith Morrissey, just --",
        "Dusty: Oh, gosh. I get it. Okay, you're not happy about Lily's new squeeze?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, repugnant phrase.",
        "Dusty: I mean, you're a busy lady. It surprises me you have time to chase guys out of your daughter's life.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, I would move heaven and earth to protect my little girl.",
        "Dusty: From what?",
        "Lucinda: A criminal.",
        "Dusty: Who?",
        "[Lucinda sighs]",
        "Lucinda: Okay, background. Keith Morrissey is heavily in debt to the mob.",
        "Dusty: The mob?",
        "Lucinda: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: What do you know about the mob?",
        "Lucinda: Don't you patronize me.",
        "Dusty: I mean, are you sure you're not jumping to conclusions about this guy, Keith?",
        "Lucinda: I wouldn't be who I am today if I didn't have a healthy respect for research. Now, I have hired private investigators. They assure me that Vincent Dibello --",
        "Dusty: Vin Dibello?",
        "Lucinda: You -- you heard of him?",
        "Dusty: Lily's boyfriend Keith is mixed up with Vin Dibello?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, thank you. Thank you. He's been seen. He's been spotted on her estate. That's where --",
        "Dusty: Does Lily know about their association?",
        "Lucinda: Lily, she's blinded by lust. I don't know, the novelty of having a man after -- I don't -- I don't know. But she just sees no danger. But I can feel the vibes from you. I gather you do?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jack: So, you're sure you heard these sounds before the tire blew out?",
        "Guard #1: I can't be 100% positive. I was pretty shaken up from the crash. But I keep going over it in my mind, and right before it blew, and we went over that embankment, I heard sounds. You know? Like two loud popping sounds. I don't know. Seems too coincidental to me.",
        "Jack: All right, listen. I'm gonna look into it. In the meantime, just leave your cell phone number with the front desk.",
        "Guard #1: Thanks, Detective. For everything.",
        "Carly: Hey.",
        "Jack: I thought you went home.",
        "Carly: Jack, that guard -- he was from the crash, wasn't he?",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Well, you two certainly seemed pretty intense. What's going on?",
        "Jack: Nothing.",
        "Carly: It didn't seem like nothing to me. Jack? Look at me. Is something going on?",
        "Jack: He thought he heard something before the tire blew.",
        "Carly: He thought he heard what?",
        "Jack: Now, he doesn't know. Which is understandable. I mean, he went through a very traumatic experience. And when that happens, you don't know what's real, and what isn't. It's not gonna amount to anything, I don't think.",
        "Carly: So why can't you tell me what he said, then? Jack?",
        "Jack: He said he might have heard two popping sounds.",
        "Carly: Before the tire blew?",
        "Jack: Yes.",
        "Carly: Well, he must think it means it's something pretty important, if he came all the way down here to tell you.",
        "Jack: He thinks that the blowout and the crash were not an accident.",
        "Carly: You're thinking what I'm thinking, aren't you?",
        "Jack: I don't know, Carly. What are you thinking?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: See, the thing is, it's not really a done deal just yet. Holden and I are still talking.",
        "Keith: What about?",
        "Lily: About us, and the kids. We want to make sure we're doing what's right for everyone involved.",
        "Keith: So, I guess that kiss was a little out of line there.",
        "Lily: Well, no, no. We just have to understand. I've got to think about Luke and Faith and Natalie. What's right for me may not be what's right for them.",
        "Keith: Well, I don't know, if you didn't think it was right for them, you probably wouldn't have said anything to Holden, huh?",
        "Lily: No, that's -- that's just it. See, there's -- there's one part of me that's ready to move on. And there's this other part of me that's trying to hold on to this family with everything that I've got.",
        "Keith: I understand. You don't want to hurt your kids if you don't have to.",
        "Lily: No. And you've been so great. So understanding. And I've just been -- oh, all over the map.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? Listen, Lily, I never -- I'm not gonna throw my two cents in here, okay? 'Cause I said I wasn't gonna pressure you. And I meant that.",
        "Lily: You're right. I don't know how you're gonna figure all this out while I'm trying to figure out how to end my marriage. I'm agonizing over that.",
        "Keith: Right. But then again, I mean, I don't want to be in some kind of a holding pattern.",
        "Lily: I know, I know, I know. I don't want to complicate things for you. I mean, you're taking a chance just to be with me.",
        "Keith: Well, you know what? You're 30,000 feet in the air, or you're tellin' someone that you're falling in love with them. It's all scary, okay?",
        "Lily: Mm-hmm. So, what can I do to make it easier?",
        "Keith: Well, you could just give me a sign, you know? I mean, I told you how I felt.",
        "Lily: And I haven't told you how I felt.",
        "Keith: Well, not really.",
        "Lily: Mm-mm.",
        "Keith: I mean, I could go back to Chicago with J.J. or I could stay right here, and I could start a whole new chapter in my life. With you.",
        "Lily: You would do that?",
        "Keith: You just give me the word.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: You're right. It's not just about the flowers. It's --",
        "Emily: Yeah, I had a feeling it was something else.",
        "Paul: Well, the -- it is kind of about the flowers. I mean, the flowers are from Jennifer's wedding, and I -- I mean, I look at this junk, and I -- I just keep thinking about how every couple is supposed to have that \"happily ever after\" when they get married. And Rosanna and I, we didn't even make it to our first anniversary.",
        "Emily: Yeah, that was Rosanna's fault, not yours.",
        "Paul: Okay, it doesn't help to blame anybody, Emily.",
        "Emily: The only way you're gonna get past all this, Paul, is if you put yourself out there a little bit. I know it sounds, you know, like it's gonna feel funny, and it might feel very forced at first. But it's the only way you're gonna get new memories. You have to get new memories to make up the old memories.",
        "Paul: Funny you should mention memories, right? Because I was just -- I was looking at all this stuff, and -- this is from our wedding.",
        "Emily: Oh, Paul. You kept an empty bottle of chardonnay?",
        "Paul: Well, no. It's not just any bottle of chardonnay.",
        "Emily: You cannot hold on to these things. Listen to me, you will be trapped in the past. You -- wait a minute. Is this a first edition?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Rosanna gave it to me for Valentine's Day.",
        "Emily: Wow. Looks like this moving on thing is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: What's going on?",
        "James: You see, Little Jimmy and I are inseparable. You know, wherever I go, he goes. Wherever he goes, I go. Because that's -- that's the way I'm gonna raise him. The old fashioned way. Because basically, I'm an old-fashioned man.",
        "Rosanna: There's nothing you could do to me, no punishment worse than knowing you'll be raising my son.",
        "James: Don't worry about her. She won't be giving us any trouble much longer.",
        "Pilot: The plane is ready for boarding, sir. I've charted the course you requested.",
        "James: Over the gulf?",
        "Pilot: Yes, sir. Toward the South China Sea.",
        "James: Very good. I promise, you won't feel a thing.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: If you want me to ask you to stay --",
        "Keith: I don't want you to ask me. I just want to know that you want me to stay. I mean, you do, don't you?",
        "Lily: You know I do.",
        "Keith: How would I know that? Well, now I know.",
        "Lily: You want more?",
        "Keith: Absolutely.",
        "[Luke clears his throat]",
        "Luke: Sorry, I didn't know you were here.",
        "Keith: Oh, that's okay. I got to go, anyways.",
        "Lily: I'll walk you to the door.",
        "[Lily clears her throat]",
        "[Keith whistles]",
        "Keith: Uh, listen, that settles it. I'm gonna stay here. I'm gonna commute from O'Hare. And I promise you, I will get a grip on those damn greyhounds.",
        "Lily: You don't have to prove yourself to me.",
        "Keith: I want to.",
        "[Lily sighs]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Keith.",
        "Jack: Keith, what?",
        "Carly: You think Keith had something to do with that transport van crashing, don't you, Jack?",
        "Jack: I never said that.",
        "Carly: What if he intentionally crashed it to get rid of Les?",
        "Jack: Well, honey, what -- there's no -- there's no evidence of that. At all. And why? Why would Keith kill Les when the guy's going to jail for the rest of his life?",
        "Carly: Only if he was convicted. Maybe Keith was afraid that the trial would go another way. And if he knew that Les didn't really kill Julia, maybe he wanted there to be no trial at all.",
        "Jack: You really believe that?",
        "Carly: What? You said yourself that Les had been ranting for days, telling you that Keith was framing him? Well, maybe he was right, and Keith tried to kill him to shut him up.",
        "Jack: Let's not get carried away here.",
        "Carly: What? But the guard said --",
        "Jack: No, what the guard said -- it doesn't really matter what the guard said, honey. Don't forget, I was there, too. I don't remember any unusual sounds.",
        "Carly: Well, that doesn't mean he was wrong. Maybe you just didn't hear it.",
        "Jack: It's possible, but not very likely. And you're starting to sound like Lucinda Walsh.",
        "Carly: Lucinda Walsh happens to love her daughter. She wants to protect her. I love Lily, too, and if she should --",
        "Jack: Okay, I want to put the kibosh on this before this thing gets out of control, okay?",
        "Carly: What?",
        "Jack: You're doing it again. You're putting yourself in the middle of a situation that doesn't concern you.",
        "Carly: This concerns me. Lily concerns me.",
        "Jack: The last time you put yourself in the middle of Lily's life, you wound up in jail, Carly! Stop it. Focus on us right now -- you, me and the kids. Everything else is beside the point. Drop it, please. Let it go.",
        "Carly: Come on, Jack. This nothing like the last time, and you know it. And we both know what this is really about. You think I don't know what you're afraid of? You're afraid that if we push this, if we make trouble for Keith, you will lose J.J.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: I'm just curious. Why this?",
        "Paul: In vino veritas. This is the bottle from the night that Rosanna and I realized how we really felt about each other.",
        "[Paul remembering] You. Me. Me. You.",
        "[Laughter] It's not bad, you know? Uh-uh.",
        "Rosanna: Yay, us.",
        "Paul: Yay, us. You.",
        "Rosanna: Let's take this show on the road.",
        "Paul: Oh, I don't know about that.",
        "Rosanna: Why not?",
        "Paul: But never let it be said that Rosanna Cabot and Paul Ryan did not make beautiful music together.",
        "Rosanna: Amen, brother.",
        "Paul: Cheers.",
        "Rosanna: Cheers. Bottoms up. Mm. Ah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: You ever wonder if it wasn't the truth? You know, Rosanna might have been faking it? I'm sorry. I -- I don't mean to sound cruel. But, given everything we know now, I can't help but wonder if it was just a big act.",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter now. Maybe, but it's over now. I need to get rid of this stuff.",
        "Emily: Then what are you waiting for?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, don't do this, please. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, please, I'm begging you. Please, not in front of Cabot. Oh, God!",
        "James: That's the best reason you're now gonna quit screaming.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!",
        "James: Give us a smile, Rosanna. Something we can remember you by.",
        "[Rosanna screams]",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Announcer: Coming up on \"As the World Turns\" --",
        "Rosanna: I should just kill him for what he did to me and my child.",
        "Craig: So, do it.",
        "Carly: Why didn't you tell Keith what the guard said about the crash?",
        "Jack: How is it, after all these years of being with a cop, you have no idea when to keep your mouth shut about internal police business? Stay out if it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Dusty: So who's your beef with? Keith? Or this guy that he's hanging out with?",
        "Lucinda: You lie down with dogs -- fleas the dog gets -- you know what I'm saying.",
        "Dusty: Listen, Keith is in debt. So what? He's got some questionable associates? That doesn't mean he's dangerous.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, but Les Sweeney -- he swore until the day that he died that Keith Morrisey killed his sister. And killed her for money.",
        "Dusty: Sweeney's not a real reliable source.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, great. So, since he's gone to meet his maker we'll never know the truth.",
        "Dusty: Bottom line, I'm not getting rid of Keith Morrisey for you. And I gotta say, you bringing me down here to pitch something like this -- it's -- it's beneath you.",
        "Lucinda: Um, just for your information, Dusty, there is absolutely nothing beneath me when it comes to my family. Now, if Morrisey cannot repay his debt to the mob -- how long do you think it's gonna take before they come and threaten Lily, who can pay. And we know its open season, now, even on women. This is the way they operate.",
        "Dusty: I'm outta here, okay?",
        "Lucinda: Hey, honey. You loved her. You were kids together. You loved her.",
        "Dusty: Sweetheart, this is between you and your daughter.",
        "Lucinda: Yeah, but she doesn't listen. She needs a man. She doesn't listen to me.",
        "Dusty: Lucinda. I'm sorry.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, you are sorry. You're a sorry fellow. And when something awful happens to Lily -- something that you could have prevented -- are you going to feel sorry then?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Can I get you some breakfast?",
        "Luke: Don't do that.",
        "Lily: What?",
        "Luke: Act like I need you to take care of me. I've been taking care of myself for a long time now.",
        "Lily: Oh, so, you're upset because I left town without telling you, and -- I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: I'm not upset. I'm just -- I don't know. I just think it was kinda weird that you didn't say anything.",
        "Lily: You were in Washington.",
        "Luke: Hello. I have a cell phone. You could have called me, or sent me a text message. Hi, bye -- anything.",
        "Lily: Okay, all right, I get it. You're absolutely right. I should have told you where I was going.",
        "Luke: Or who you were going with.",
        "Lily: Now you know. How does that make you feel?",
        "Luke: I don't know -- I just think its kinda fast.",
        "Lily: I thought you liked Keith.",
        "Luke: I liked him for getting you out of jail. I didn't realize that you two were --",
        "Lily: Close.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I guess.",
        "Lily: Well, we started out as friends. And then my feelings for him started to change.",
        "Luke: What about Dad?",
        "Lily: I'll always love your father, you know that.",
        "Luke: But not enough to want to move back in with him?",
        "Lily: Okay, I know. I know how hard this is for you, believe me.",
        "Luke: No, it's -- I feel like I've been having the same conversation over and over again. First with Dad, now with you.",
        "Lily: I'm sorry.",
        "Luke: Maybe it's my fault. Maybe the way I acted when Dad was with Julia -- blowing up and running off -- maybe -- maybe it messed things up.",
        "Lily: Don't say that. It's not your fault. What happened between your father and me is absolutely not your fault.",
        "Luke: Then whose fault is it?",
        "Lily: It's no one's fault. It's never one person's fault when a marriage breaks up. It's hundreds of things over a long period of time.",
        "Luke: I know all that, but when you love somebody and they make mistakes, you're supposed to forgive them, aren't you?",
        "Lily: This isn't about forgiveness.",
        "Luke: But Ddad hurt you.",
        "Lily: And I hurt your father. And if all we do is blame each other over and over again, when is it just gonna end?",
        "Luke: You know, he hates that you're with Keith.",
        "Lily: I hated that he was with Julia. But things -- it's hard to accept this, but things, everything -- everything has to change.",
        "Luke: Why can't they just change back to normal? Dad still loves you. He worries about you.",
        "Lily: No, that's your grandmother talking. She has filled his head with these ideas about Keith because she doesn't want me to divorce your father.",
        "Luke: Dad asked me if there was anything about Keith that made me nervous.",
        "Lily: He asked you that?",
        "Luke: Yeah. He just, he wanted to know if there was anything that didn't seem right.",
        "Lily: You know, this is ridiculous. I can't believe he put you in the middle of this.",
        "Luke: He was just asking.",
        "Lily: Keith is a good person. And you're gonna hear some other things about Keith, that doesn't mean that they're true.",
        "Luke: What other things?",
        "Lily: Like he's -- in trouble. That he's in debt.",
        "Luke: Well, is it true?",
        "Lily: It is true. Yes, it's true. But your grandmother, of course, blows everything out of proportion. I've talked to Keith about this, and he's going to pay back all the money that he owes.",
        "Luke: So that's why he has you, huh?",

        "Jack: This isn't about J.J. It's about us.",
        "Carly: Jack, that van might have been sabotaged. And if it was, Keith is the only person who would benefited from Les' death.",
        "Jack: Or that guard didn't hear what he thought he heard, honey. Come on. Listen, I had him leave his number with the front desk. But you gotta believe me, he told me himself that he wasn't sure what happened.",
        "Carly: So you're just going to let it go?",
        "Jack: If I thought there was any merit to what he said, yeah, I'd follow up on it, honey. But as far as I'm concerned, the case is closed. Drop it.",
        "Keith: I'm sorry. I'm not interrupting anything?",
        "Jack: Uh, no. I don't know. Would you give us a minute, please, Carly?",
        "Carly: Yeah, sure",
        "Keith: Actually, stick around, Carly. This involves both you two.",
        "Jack: All right. What's it about?",
        "Keith: Well, you know, since Sweeny was never brought to trial, there's no official closure.",
        "Jack: There's a problem with that?",
        "Keith: Yeah, there is a problem. Everybody knows that Sweeny did it, but he was never nailed for it.",
        "Jack: He's dead, Keith. I'd say that's about as nailed as a guy can get.",
        "Carly: I'm confused. What does this have to do with Jack and me?",
        "Keith: Well, my plans have changed and I just wanted to bring you two up to speed.",
        "Jack: This about J.J.?",
        "Keith: Yeah, it is. You know, I told you I was gonna go back to Chicago when my sister's killer was brought to trial. Well, I've changed my mind.",
        "Carly: You're staying in Oakdale?",

        "Craig: Yes. Everything is under control. You're gonna get what I owe you when we land. All right, everything's going to be okay.",
        "Rosanna: Why didn't you tell me that you were on the plane?",
        "Craig: Well, I didn't wanna chance being discovered. If James had found out, we might all be at the bottom of the sea now.",
        "James: Oh, oh.",
        "Rosanna: I should just kill him for what he did to me and to my child.",

        "Keith: Yeah, yeah. I think it's the best situation. I mean, why uproot him any more then he's already been uprooted? If you know what I mean.",
        "Carly: Yes, yes. I think -- I think it's a really wonderful decision. And we're gonna take excellent care of him, I promise.",

        "Jack: Nothing. Nothing that concerns you.",
        "Keith: No? What, does it have something to do with Julia?",
        "Jack: No. Carly heard some police business, but it has no bearing on the case. No, tell me, did you tell J.J. that he's gonna be staying with us?",
        "Keith: No, I haven't I thought I'd let you do the honors. I know it's what he really wants.",
        "Jack: Well, I gotta tell ya -- I know how difficult it was for you to do. I mean, especially if you're gonna be staying in Oakdale and everything. But, I really appreciate it.",
        "Keith: Pleasure.",
        "Carly: Why didn't you tell Keith what the guard said about the crash?",
        "Jack: How is it, after all these years being with a cop, you have no idea when to keep your mouth shut about internal police business?",
        "Carly: You should have just said it, and then you could have seen how he reacted.",
        "Jack: He just told me that J.J. can stay with me! With us! I can't get two minutes of happiness here?",

        "Luke: And he makes you happy?",
        "Lily: Yes. He makes me happy. But I -- you have to know something. My priority is you and your sisters. So, if this doesn't work for you, then forget it.",
        "Luke: No, I'm not gonna act like I did with Dad. Get all mad because you found somebody, and then make things worse. No. I want you to be happy. I want you to have a life. It's just that --",
        "Lily: What? Say it.",
        "Luke: Do what you always tell me. Take your time. Keith's not going anywhere, he lives in our backyard.",

        "Luke: Is that true?",
        "Lily: Yeah, it's true. But that doesn't mean we're getting back together, okay? And just so you know, Keith is not pressuring me. I'm with him because I want to be with him.",

        "Luke: If it's what you want, then I guess I'm happy for you.",

        "Paul: You're right. It's a cry for help. Please, Emily, help me. Please, kick me in the pants.",
        "Emily: I'm really sorry, but at the risk of sounding like a broken record --what is all that stuff doing in your home besides --",
        "Paul: It's taking up space, gathering dust and breaking my heart. You're right. I can -- I can -- I can do this. I can -- out with the old, right? And in with whatever. I can do this.",

        "Dusty: No. I saw Luke on the way in. He didn't seem happy.",
        "Lily: No. But he's okay. We had a great talk. Long talk. I mean, he's so mature, but this is so much for him to process. And he really believes that I deserve some happiness in my life. So he's gonna be okay. I'm gonna be okay.",
