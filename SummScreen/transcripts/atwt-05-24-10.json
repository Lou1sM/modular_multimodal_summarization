        "Gabriel accuses Craig of hitting him, starting the fire and leaving him for dead, as Margo and Lily are stunned while Lucinda doesn't look that surprised \u0096 more smug. Craig is stunned, as he pleads with Gabriel to tell the truth, but he isn't interested in Craig's pleas. Craig forces everyone out of the room while he begs Gabriel to tell the truth; he even explains that Lily and Lucinda kept the news about him being a father all these years; he wants to make up for this, but Gabriel will not listen. Margo and Lily try to get Craig to open the door, but he won't so Margo is forced to call for an officer. Once inside and still not changing his story, Craig is taken to jail. Lucinda talks with Gabriel in private and praises his lies for the greater good. Craig implores Margo to listen to his side promising he would never hurt his own child, but his pleas fall on deaf ears, as Margo can't take anymore lies from him. Jack and Janet hang out, as he awaits the lawyer's call back. Jack wrestles with Parker's situation, as Janet figures out that Carly knew about Parker's lies and didn't tell Jack. Carly stands by Parker, as he is in jail, but she is still convinced he did nothing wrong and that he shouldn't talk anymore. When Liberty calls her, she tells her to come to the station thinking she might convince Parker to reconsider. Liberty has no idea why Parker is there and only wants to make up by offering to go with him to a concert with her so they can get their friendship back on track. Parker tells her that he can't go, as Liberty finds out Parker has been arrested. Parker finally admits that he hit Gabriel and left him unconscious. Liberty is very upset to hear this, as they argue. Carly shows up to find Jack with Janet and she isn't happy to find them talking about Parker and is even less thrilled when Janet judges the choice she made to keep Parker from talking with Jack. They are interrupted by Margo's call and her news about Craig. They all head to the station happy to tell Parker. They tell Parker and Liberty the news, as Parker isn't sure how to feel. Liberty is still angry with him and the fact that he is now off the hook doesn't change that he lied to her. Carly, Jack and Parker head home, as Carly wants to cook him all of his favorites, but Parker is more concerned about his parents being ok. Carly asks Jack to stay for dinner, but he wants to head back to the station first to take care of something. Janet and Liberty talk about Parker and his actions against Gabriel, as Liberty is mad that he lied to her and that he is jealous. Janet defends a bit of Parker's actions, but thinks they also may need space since Parker may still have some unresolved feelings for her. Liberty wants to go see Gabriel, but Janet isn't thrilled to hear this. Gabriel blackmailed Craig and took Parker's money, but Liberty defends him saying that she won't turn her back on someone with no family considering they know firsthand how that feels. A furious Jack confronts Craig promising if he could, he would kill him for what he put Parker through. Craig appeals to Jack to think about if this makes sense; he would never throw Parker under the bus or hurt his own son. Jack doesn't believe that, as Craig makes an admission of love for Carly that would cause him never to put her through losing Parker, as Jack seems a bit swayed by his defense. Craig asks Jack to think about what he said, as Jack seems to be thinking about his words."

        "Lucinda: Did you hear what I just heard?",
        "Lily: That can't be true. Craig tried to kill his own son?",
        "Lucinda: I'm shocked, I'm shocked.",
        "Craig: Gabriel, that's not true. Tell Margo the truth.",
        "Gabriel: I am.",
        "Craig: But I didn't even see you the day of the fire. I didn't hit you. I didn't leave you to die.",
        "Gabriel: Yeah, what else would you say?",
        "Margo: Okay, Gabriel, you said that before Craig knocked you out, he said that you would never get out alive.",
        "Craig: I never said that. I never even saw him!",
        "Margo: Craig, please, for your own good, please just shut up.",
        "Lucinda: Do you see now how right we were to keep the kid away from him all these years?",
        "Lily: Craig looked me in the eye and swore to me he had nothing to do with any of this.",
        "Lucinda: You believed him?",
        "Margo: Please. Gabriel, I care about what happens to you very much because you are my nephew and because it is my job. Now, I need you to tell me everything that happened, everything you remember, and I need you to tell me the truth. Did Craig try to kill you?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: It's gonna be all right, Parker, I promise you. When your dad gets back, when we hear what the lawyer has to say --",
        "Parker: What difference is that gonna make?",
        "Carly: It's gonna make all the difference in the world. I'm bringing you home with me, Parker, today.",
        "Parker: Look, Mom, I -- I know that you're trying to make me feel better. But just please stop, okay, because I know that that is not gonna happen.",
        "Carly: Yes, it is.",
        "Parker: I am glad I confessed, okay, because keeping what happened a secret and letting Craig take the blame for my fight with Gabriel, it was wrong.",
        "Carly: You hit him, and you left him there. That's true. But Craig is the one who started the fire, Honey. Craig is the one who nearly killed that boy.",
        "Parker: Okay, okay. But how long do you think that I'm gonna be in jail?",
        "Carly: Not for one second.",
        "Parker: Mom --",
        "Carly: Parker, not for one second.",
        "Parker: What are you gonna do?",
        "Carly: Anything I have to do.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: Just a sec. Hello, Liberty.",
        "Liberty: Hey. I don't mean to bother you, but I've been trying to reach Parker, and his phone just keeps rolling straight to voicemail.",
        "Carly: Yeah. He had to shut his phone off. But I know he wants to talk to you. He -- he's right here.",
        "Parker: Hello.",
        "Liberty: Dude, what is up? Where are you?",
        "Parker: I'm at -- I'm at the police station.",
        "Liberty: Oh, okay. I was worried. Your phone is never off. Anyway, don't move. I'm coming over.",
        "Parker: Wait. No, no, no, Liberty, you can't.",
        "Liberty: I have a surprise for you.",
        "Parker: I've got one for you, too.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: The lawyer will call you when he's out of court.",
        "Jack: This waiting around -- it's killing me.",
        "Janet: Really? Couldn't tell.",
        "Jack: You didn't have to leave Dusty to hold my hand.",
        "Janet: I didn't. And that is not what I am doing.",
        "Jack: Of course you are.",
        "Janet: No. Come on. You'd do the same thing for me. And I appreciate you coming all the way down here to tell Liberty in person what's going on with Parker, 'cause I know you got a lot on your plate right now, and to think about my daughter's feelings in the middle of all that is very --",
        "Jack: Janet, what are you talking about? Liberty is my niece.",
        "Janet: I know that. I know. But you need to worry about you right now, and Parker. I know you're scared about him.",
        "Jack: I can't tell you how proud I was of him for coming to the station and doing what he did, even though it could mean -- I just --",
        "[Jack sighs]",
        "Jack: Carly doesn't understand why I feel that way.",
        "Janet: Well, she's just scared about her son.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, maybe she should have been a little more scared a little earlier. Never mind. It's just been a -- it's been a hard time.",
        "Janet: You know, there is one thing I find surprising, knowing Parker -- why he didn't come to you sooner with the truth.",
        "Jack: Well, he would have, but somebody talked him out of it.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Craig: Margo, I did not try to kill Gabriel.",
        "Margo: Craig, don't, don't.",
        "Craig: He doesn't know what he's saying!",
        "Margo: Please don't do this!",
        "Gabriel: I remember the smoke. I -- I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move. You made sure of that.",
        "Craig: But I never hit you! I didn't fight with you, and I didn't leave you to die in a fire!",
        "Gabriel: Get him away! Get him away from me! This guy tried to kill me!",
        "Margo: Craig, stop it!",
        "[Gabriel coughing]",
        "Margo: Craig -- Craig, get out of the way.",
        "Craig: He can't breathe!",
        "Margo: Come on.",
        "Lucinda: Perhaps he should have thought of that before he set him on fire.",
        "Lily: I'm gonna get some help.",
        "Margo: Please just --",
        "Craig: Gabriel, look -- look at me. Try to relax. Try to relax.",
        "Margo: God, will you get out of the -- Nurse! Get out of the room! Nurse! Nurse, he started coughing, and he can't breathe. He can't stop.",
        "Nurse: Okay, okay, okay. Try and stay calm. Stay calm.",
        "[Gabriel breathing heavily]",
        "Nurse: Get some air into your lungs, and exhale slowly.",
        "Gabriel: I'm okay. And we're not done.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Parker: I really wish that you hadn't put me on the phone with Liberty.",
        "Carly: I know you feel like you've done something wrong, but you haven't. And the more you act like things are normal --",
        "Parker: She's gonna be so upset with me.",
        "Carly: Yes. No, she'll be upset. Look where we are. Look what's happened. But we're gonna fix it.",
        "Parker: No. No, she's gonna be upset because of Gabriel. She looks at him as some sort of like wounded animal, like it's her position to take care of him and save him, like he's all alone in the world.",
        "Carly: That has nothing to do with you, does it? You were a very good friend to her when she needed one, so let her be your friend, okay? Let her help you.",
        "Parker: Mom, you don't get it. When she finds out that I'm the --",
        "Liberty: Hi. Is Jack selling policemen ball tickets and you two wanted to be first in line or something?",
        "[Carly laughs nervously]",
        "Parker: No. We were -- we were just talking.",
        "Liberty: Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to bust this up or anything, but can I borrow Parker for a few minutes and go get a cup of coffee at Java?",
        "Parker: No, I -- I actually -- I can't get coffee.",
        "Liberty: Five minutes. That's all. I swear.",
        "Carly: You know what? Parker has to wait for his dad here, but I will certainly give you two some -- some privacy to talk.",
        "Liberty: Were you in the middle of something? You look weird.",
        "Parker: No, no. We're just -- we're just talking. But my dad's gonna be back here really soon, so --",
        "Liberty: I am so sorry that things are so weird between us.",
        "Parker: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Liberty: No, it's so not okay. You're the best friend anyone has ever had, ever. You were always there for me, even when I was sick. And I'm starting to feel so much better, like you have no idea.",
        "Parker: That's -- that's really great.",
        "Liberty: I know. So great that I got us these to celebrate -- Paramore, Giants stadium, sold out, front row. Don't ask. Okay, they were handing them out to sick kids in the cancer ward, and I played sicker. Come on. If I can't joke around with you, who can I --",
        "Parker: No, it's -- it's just that I -- I actually tried to get us tickets to the same show.",
        "Liberty: But you couldn't, right? Because it's totally sold out, and you can only get them if you have a hookup like me. Cancer finally came in handy for once. Oh, my God. What is wrong with you?",
        "Parker: Well, I actually -- I had the hookups, too, but I couldn't get them because there was something wrong with my credit card. And this actually happened on the same day that the fire broke out at Monte Carlo.",
        "Liberty: Okay. But what does that have to do with --",
        "Parker: Look, okay, you know what? You need to get somebody else to go with you. I -- I can't.",
        "Liberty: What is this? What's going on?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Janet: Who would tell Parker not to tell you the truth?",
        "Jack: Just forget I said anything.",
        "Janet: All right.",
        "Jack: It's just that everyone has a different idea about how to do what's best for your kid.",
        "Janet: Yes, I know. When Liberty was sick, I had people coming out of the woodwork telling me how I should deal with it.",
        "Jack: Right, and sometimes parents disagree, yes?",
        "Janet: I hope that doesn't happen with us when this little guy is born.",
        "Jack: It won't, as long as you do everything I tell you to do.",
        "Janet: Yeah, right.",
        "[Janet laughs]",
        "Janet: Keep dreaming.",
        "Jack: Hey. What are you doing here? I thought you were gonna wait at the station with Parker.",
        "Carly: I thought you were getting him a lawyer.",
        "Jack: I -- I'm waiting for him to get out of court and return my call.",
        "Carly: And while you're waiting, you thought you'd spread the word?",
        "Janet: I'm really sorry about what's going on, Carly.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Janet: Jack came down here so he can tell Liberty in person what was happening with Parker.",
        "Carly: Well, he doesn't have to, because she's with Parker now.",
        "Janet: She's at the station?",
        "Carly: Yeah. She called me, looking for him.",
        "Jack: Did he tell her?",
        "Carly: Well, that's why I left Parker at the station, to answer your first question, so I could give them some privacy. I know he was feeling nervous about telling her what happened. I reminded him that he hasn't done anything wrong.",
        "Jack: Well, he didn't do it on its own. That's true.",
        "Carly: Could we not do this now?",
        "Jack: Are you going to admit the crushing pressure that was on that kid?",
        "Janet: Wait a minute. You knew the truth? Carly, you are the one who told Parker not to tell Jack?",
        "Carly: You gonna weigh in now?",
        "[Janet scoffs]",
        "Janet: Only you.",
        "Carly: Excuse me?",
        "Janet: Only you could make a bad situation worse for your own kid.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lily: Maybe we should override Gabriel's wishes and ask his father to leave.",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry. I can't override a patient's request.",
        "Lucinda: Nor should you, Dear. I mean, if -- if this is justice, this is right, because justice should be served cold.",
        "Lily: That's revenge, not justice.",
        "Lucinda: Sometimes it's the same thing.",
        "Margo: Gabriel, I need you to be very clear about this, and I need you to let him speak. When Craig came back into the office and found you there after you fought with Parker Snyder --",
        "Craig: I never came back and found him there.",
        "Margo: Craig, please. When you saw Craig again, what happened?",
        "Gabriel: He said that I wouldn't get out alive. I told him that he was full of it. And then I saw him reach for something on the desk. I turned my back to him, and everything went black.",
        "Craig: That never happened.",
        "Margo: Why do you think that Craig would want to harm you?",
        "Gabriel: To shut me up because I knew too much.",
        "Margo: About what?",
        "Gabriel: I knew he was stealing from Parker's trust fund, lying to Carly. And if I was out of the picture, he could continue to get away with it. You just did what you had to do.",
        "Craig: Yes. I was furious with him for blackmailing me. But, Margo, never in a million years could I think that I could get away with what I was doing by killing him. And I never threatened him!",
        "Lucinda: Like you never threatened me?",
        "Craig: Shut up, Old Woman!",
        "Margo: What?!",
        "Craig: You know me! You know I could never do something like that!",
        "Margo: No, Craig, I don't know anything right now! I'm trying to put a -- stop. What are you -- Craig, let go! Stop it! Craig! Craig, open up this door! Open it up! You're only making things worse!",
        "Craig: No, you did that, didn't you, Gabriel? And I want to know why.",
        "Margo: Craig, what the hell is wrong with you?! Open the door!",
        "Craig: I need time with my son, Margo.",
        "Gabriel: Don't call me that, okay? I'm not your son.",
        "Nurse: I'll call security.",
        "Margo: Well, we're gonna need much more than a hospital guard for this. See if you can get him to open the door before I call someone down here to kick it in.",
        "Lily: We've got to do something.",
        "Lucinda: No, Darling, we have to do nothing.",
        "Lily: Craig, listen to me! Think about how this looks!",
        "Craig: I know you hate me, and I know why. Gabriel, lying to the police, telling Margo that I attacked you, that I said I wanted you to die --",
        "Gabriel: Well, isn't that why you locked us in here, huh -- to finish me off?",
        "Craig: You don't believe that.",
        "Gabriel: Well, what else could you want with me?",
        "Craig: You grew up without a father, and you have every reason to hate me for abandoning your mother.",
        "Gabriel: Oh, God, how big of you to admit that you treated her like dirt.",
        "Craig: I didn't know that she was pregnant with you. And I didn't want you hurt even after you came here and you were --",
        "Gabriel: And blackmailed you?",
        "Craig: Gabriel, please, just listen to me.",
        "Gabriel: How can you say you didn't want me hurt, huh? When I hurt my hand, you didn't give a damn then. You made jokes. You didn't even want to send me to the hospital.",
        "Craig: That's hardly the same thing! But yes, okay, I acted like an ass!",
        "Gabriel: Oh, that's not your fault now either, is it?",
        "Craig: You want to know the truth? Those two women -- they're the reason that I didn't even know that you existed. You want someone to blame? You blame them.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Liberty: Hey. Will you just tell me what's going on here?",
        "Parker: I'm trying to, okay? But I -- I just don't know how to. And I really can't go with you, okay, not after what I've done.",
        "Liberty: What are you talking about? Look, I know things have been kind of sketchy between us since the whole Gabriel thing went down.",
        "Parker: It's about Gabriel.",
        "Liberty: Parker, you were my wingman through all of this, the whole time I was sick, okay? You're my best friend. So whatever this thing is between us, we'll get past it.",
        "Parker: You don't get it, okay?",
        "Liberty: No, I do, I do. It bugged you that I was spending so much time with Gabriel and that I even liked him in the first place. But we'll deal with that later, okay? Why can't we just go to the concert and see a band --",
        "Parker: You're not listening to a single word I'm saying, okay? I can't go!",
        "Cop: I know your dad, and I know this is hard, but you need to sit still. I didn't cuff you out of courtesy to him. Don't make me change my mind.",
        "Liberty: Parker, what is he talking about? Cuff you for what?",
        "Parker: I was booked.",
        "Liberty: Booked? You mean arrested? What for?",
        "Parker: Assault. It was me. I'm the one that hit Gabriel. I left him unconscious at Monte Carlo before the fire broke out.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Carly: Now, don't you judge me. Parker's my son. What's going on with him happens to be none of your business.",
        "Janet: I disagree.",
        "Carly: I'm sure you do.",
        "Janet: Jack got kicked off the case. He's in hot water with Margo because of all this. That's not fair to him.",
        "Carly: Well, you know what? Jack's not your husband anymore, so what goes on with him isn't your business!",
        "Jack: Ladies -- Ladies, please, please!",
        "Janet: Yes, he is my business!",
        "Jack: We're all on edge! I get it, I get it.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Jack: It's Margo. Hey, Margo. Okay. I -- I, uh -- I don't understand. Okay. I'll be right there.",
        "Carly: Is Parker okay?",
        "Jack: Gabriel woke up.",
        "Janet: Oh, thank God.",
        "Carly: That's a -- that's a good thing, right?",
        "Jack: Well, I think so, because when he did, he told Margo that Craig was the one that hit him and left him for dead.",
        "Janet: What does that mean?",
        "Carly: That means my son is coming home.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Margo: Okay. He still in there?",
        "Lily: I tried to get him to listen to me, but he's ignoring me.",
        "Margo: Well, he can't ignore this. Pry it open.",
        "Lucinda: Okay. Excuse me.",
        "Craig: We don't have much time, Gabriel, but I know you don't want to do this.",
        "Gabriel: No, you don't know anything about me.",
        "Craig: I know you're my son. I know you came to Oakdale to find me. I'm sorry I let you down, and I'm not nearly the man that you'd hoped your father would be, but don't lie to the police to get back at me. That's no way to make things right between us.",
        "Gabriel: It's too late.",
        "Margo: All right, Craig. Cuff him. You're under arrest.",
        "Craig: You can fix this, Gabriel. You can.",
        "Margo: Just stop.",
        "Craig: I know you hate me, but don't throw away the chance to get to know your own father.",
        "Margo: Please, stop. Come on, come on. Let's get him out of here. Come on. Go.",
        "[Gabriel coughing]",
        "Lily: I don't like this. He needs the nurse. I'm gonna get the doctor.",
        "Gabriel: So, is that how you wanted this to go?",
        "[Lucinda laughs]",
        "Lucinda: Bravo. Good cough. I couldn't have done better myself. Truly, Gabriel, your performance was exceptional. And why should that surprise me?",
        "Gabriel: I don't know. I mean, you barely know me.",
        "Lucinda: But I know who fathered you. And, of course, I'm sure all your lovely attributes you owe to your dear departed mother. On the other hand, your ability to lie, my heavens, this apple did not fall far from the fatherly tree.",
        "Gabriel: Okay, whatever. I mean, did I pull it off or what?",
        "Lucinda: With flying colors.",
        "Lily: Is he better?",
        "Lucinda: Much, much.",
        "Doctor: You'll have to wait outside.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, okay. Of course. Well, I've had my fill of this place for one day. Let's go home.",
        "Lily: I can't leave yet.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, Lily. I know you're hell bent on wrapping yourself in a cloak of guilt, but we've done nothing wrong. He's awake now. He's telling the truth. There's nothing more we can do.",
        "Lily: I said I can't go, okay?",
        "Lucinda: Lily, listen, you heard what the boy told Margo. Craig tried to kill him. We have a right to keep Craig away from the kid all these years.",
        "Lily: Look, I know that Craig turned out to be as dangerous as you and Sarah thought he was.",

        "Lily: I can tell that you loved her very much and you feel very protective of her, and that's admirable. Any mother would be proud to have a son like you. But here's the thing.
