        "Barbara goes to meet Paul hoping to persuade him to bring Eliza home but Lisa overhears she is going to the airport and informs Meg and Damien who follow Barbara. Paul spots Meg and Damien at the meeting place and despite all of Barbara's attempts to persuade Paul that she didn't say a word to Meg and Damien Paul tells Barbara that she betrayed him and she will never see him again. Barbara yells at Meg and Damian for ruining her attempt to persuade Paul to bring Eliza home. Barbara also decides to have a talk with Lisa about her spying for Meg and Damian. Paul tells Rosanna that he and Meg are divorced and he couldn't bare it if the court took away Eliza which he says is his only reason for living. Paul asks Rosanna to allow him to stay at the Co-op while he figures out his next step. Rosanna refuses to allow Paul to stay because she thinks that Paul should take the baby back home to Oakdale. Rosanna is also afraid that Paul will complicate her simple life at the co-op farm."

        "Alison: I know. It's crazy, right? I'm not the one who decides these things, but, you know -- but whatever.",
        "Casey: Hey, you.",
        "Alison: Hey.",
        "Casey: What's up?",
        "Alison: Nothing.",
        "Casey: Okay. Out with it.",
        "Alison: What?",
        "Casey: I know you, and this is not a \"Nothing\" smile.",
        "Alison: I do not smile like that.",
        "Casey: Yes, you do. You smile like this.",
        "Alison: Stop it!",
        "Casey: Not until you tell me what's going on. Go on. Tell him.",
        "Alison: Okay, fine, but stop smiling like that. It's not that big of a deal. I just -- I found out that I'll be getting an award at graduation.",
        "Casey: Are you serious? What award?",
        "Alison: Most improved student.",
        "Casey: That's fantastic! I'm so proud of you!",
        "Alison: Why? It just means that I totally sucked when I first started, and now not so much.",
        "Casey: Hey, I never got the most improved student award.",
        "Alison: Stunning omission.",
        "Casey: So, what are you gonna do to celebrate?",
        "Alison: I was just gonna go over to Java and get a cup of coffee. Do you want to come?",
        "Casey: I wish I could, but I got to take Mrs. Lieberman home after her appointment.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, another time. Maybe you'll get most improved driver.",
        "Casey: I'm working on it.",
        "Alison: All right. Well, see you later. Hey, what about Mrs. Lieberman.",
        "Casey: I took her home an hour ago.",
        "Alison: Hunter, hey.",
        "Hunter: Alison, hello.",
        "Alison: What happened to you the other day?",
        "Hunter: Lots of things.",
        "Alison: I mean when I invited you to meet me and Casey for lunch at Al's. You never showed. We waited for you. What happened?",
        "Hunter: I just got hung up on some things.",
        "Alison: At work?",
        "Hunter: Mm-hmm.",
        "Alison: Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. You know what? Don't let Emily run you too ragged. Not everybody has a work ethic.",
        "Hunter: Hers is bizarrely effective.",
        "Alison: True, but will you do me a favor for next time? If you're not gonna make it, just call. I was worried about you.",
        "Hunter: Oh, I will. I'm sorry I made you worry.",
        "Alison: It's okay. Just don't do it again.",
        "Hunter: I won't. Hey, I should be getting back to the office. Emily's got a thing about her coffee.",
        "Alison: A thing?",
        "Hunter: She likes it hot or not at all.",
        "Alison: Just like her men.",

        "Emily: I've been waiting for like 15 minutes for that cup of coffee, you know. What are you doing here?",
        "Casey: Sorry to say, but I don't come bearing coffee.",
        "Emily: I can see that. What do you want? I'm a little busy right now.",
        "Casey: It'll be fast. I just need to talk to you.",
        "Emily: About?",
        "Casey: Alison.",
        "Emily: Oh, fantastic. That shouldn't be awkward at all, now, should it?",
        "Casey: It doesn't have to be.",
        "Emily: What is it?",
        "Casey: As you know, your sister is graduating the nursing program soon, right?",
        "Emily: Yes, I know. I got the \"Save the date\" card.",
        "Casey: Well, she's gonna receive an award.",
        "Emily: An award?",
        "Casey: Yes.",
        "Emily: For what?",
        "Casey: Most improved student.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. That's great. I had no idea. I wish she had told me.",
        "Casey: She barely told me. I don't think she would have told me if her friend didn't push her to.",
        "Emily: Yeah. Typical Alison. Do something fantastic and doesn't want to take credit for it.",
        "Casey: Yeah. It's, like, the opposite of most people.",
        "[Emily laughs dryly]",
        "Casey: That wasn't a dig. It's just that I think we should do something really nice for her.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. We?",
        "Casey: Yes. You, me, your mom, Ali, like a celebratory dinner.",
        "Emily: No, no.",
        "Casey: Why not?",
        "Emily: Forget it!",
        "Casey: Why not?",
        "Emily: I don't know, Casey. I guess I just don't want to sit down with not only my mother but my sister and her new boyfriend who happens to be my ex- husband.",
        "Casey: Okay. You know what? This is about Ali, okay? For one night, can it not be about you?",
        "Emily: Excuse me?",
        "Casey: Ali's done something really great here, and I want her to know that we see that.",
        "Emily: Fine. Fine.",
        "Casey: Good.",
        "Emily: All right. So, it's got to be early because my mom's on duty tonight.",
        "Casey: No problem.",
        "Emily: All right. I guess I'll make the reservation at the Lakeview, and I'll tell my mother.",
        "Casey: Great, great. I'll get Ali there. She's gonna be psyched.",
        "Emily: Or not.",

        "Paul: So, did you make a decision yet?",
        "Barbara: Paul?",
        "Paul: How'd you guess? So, are you gonna help me or not?",
        "Barbara: How could I possibly say no? You said that if I didn't, I would never see you or Eliza again.",
        "Paul: Yeah, that was kind of the point. I was gonna make it impossible for you to turn me down. So, can you get me the money?",
        "Barbara: Yes. Where shall I send it?",
        "Paul: No. I need for you to bring it to me?",
        "Barbara: Where?",
        "Paul: There's an airfield, a private airfield, not far from here.",
        "Barbara: Near where?",
        "Paul: You know what? Just get the money, go to the airport. I'll call you, tell you where to go.",
        "Barbara: You make it sound like you don't trust me.",
        "Paul: I don't.",
        "Barbara: Honey, I am on your side here.",
        "Paul: You'd better be, 'cause let me tell you one thing. If you sell me out to Meg or to the police, you'll be the one to pay the consequences, not me.",
        "Barbara: I would never do that! Paul? Paul?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: Damian.",
        "Damian: Hey. I hope you don't mind my dropping by. I don't mean to intrude.",
        "Meg: No. You're not intruding. Come on in, please.",
        "Damian: Thanks. I thought you wanted to know that I spoke to Lisa earlier.",
        "Meg: And?",
        "Damian: And she said that she's keeping an eye on any clues that Barbara might be in touch with her son again, but so far --",
        "Meg: Nothing.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry.",
        "Meg: It's not your fault.",
        "Damian: But I'm sure he'll contact her. We just need to be patient.",
        "Meg: Do you really think Barbara's gonna be the one that leads us to Eliza?",
        "Damian: Yeah. I think the odds are heavily in our favor. Yes.",
        "Meg: And what if we're wrong? I mean, even if Paul does call her, I think Barbara's gonna manage to keep it from Lisa.",
        "Damian: You still think Paul's mother will do anything to protect her son?",
        "Meg: Yes, yes, and Lisa does, too. I mean, when push comes to shove, I think Barbara's never gonna tell us that she heard from him, and then we're right back where we started, no closer to finding Eliza.",
        "Damian: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get you all wound up.",
        "Meg: No, no. It's okay. Believe it or not, I'm glad you came. Its nice having somebody to talk to instead of holding it all in.",
        "Damian: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Meg: You could say something encouraging.",
        "Damian: All right. Well, I believe Barbara loves her son very much, but I would imagine she loves her granddaughter, too. Yes?",
        "Meg: Yeah, she does.",
        "Damian: Then I can't believe she'd let Paul take your daughter away for long. I promise you, Meg, one way or another, we're gonna find your child, and we're gonna bring her home.",

        "Rosanna: Paul, what are you doing here? I thought you left.",
        "Paul: Yeah, I tried. Some other car stuff. I had to spend the night.",
        "Rosanna: Wow. That's terrible. I hope Meg wasn't up waiting for you all night.",
        "Paul: Oh, no. She totally understood.",
        "Rosanna: Well, good. Do you want some more food for your ride back to Oakdale?",
        "Paul: No, but I need to ask you a favor. Could you watch Eliza just for a few hours?",
        "Rosanna: Paul, I'm working. I can't babysit for you.",
        "Paul: Look, I just gave her a bottle, okay? She's not gonna be any trouble at all. She'll probably sleep the entire time that I'm gone.",
        "Rosanna: Look, what's going on?",
        "Paul: Nothing. I got to meet a guy at an airport.",
        "Rosanna: And you can't take Eliza with you?",
        "Paul: No. That would -- I couldn't risk it.",
        "Rosanna: You couldn't risk it?",
        "Paul: Well --",
        "Rosanna: Paul, you know, I knew something was off.",

        "Rosanna: Don't lie to me.",
        "Paul: I'm not lying.",
        "Rosanna: Paul, I know you. You're running from somebody or something. Now, what is it? What's going on? What did you do?",

        "Lisa: Barbara.",
        "Barbara: Lisa.",
        "Lisa: Honey, I've been so worried about you. Honey, I do wish you'd let me stay with you last night.",
        "Barbara: That's very sweet of you, but I just needed some time to be alone.",
        "Lisa: I know. But do I dare ask, did you hear from Paul?",
        "Barbara: No, and I don't expect to either.",
        "Lisa: Oh, no, no. Don't say that, Barbara. Please don't. He needs you, and so does your grandbaby.",
        "Barbara: Well, I wish it was enough to convince him to bring her home.",
        "Lisa: Well, when you talked with him last night or yesterday, didn't he give you some clue of where you might be?",
        "Barbara: Not that I picked up on. You know, it's not that I don't want to know. I'd give anything to know where they are right now, but I don't. I have no idea, Lisa, and, you know, I have an appointment, and so I really need to be going.",
        "Lisa: Well, wait, wait. This appointment that you have, can you promise me and swear to me that has nothing to do with Paul? Come on, baby! Please trust me! I'm your friend!",
        "Barbara: It has nothing to do with Paul. And, Lisa, I've got to go or I'm gonna be late.",
        "Lisa: Okay, but just call me, okay? Call me.",
        "Barbara: I promise. I'll call you.",

        "Damian: We'll get Eliza home safe and sound. All we need is one small lead.",

        "Lisa: Damian, its Lisa.",
        "Damian: Lisa. Did you talk to Barbara?",
        "Lisa: Yes. And she's headed for the airport. I know she's going to see Paul.",
        "Damian: Oh, Lisa, thank you so much. You have no idea how much this helps. Barbara's on her way to the airport.",
        "Meg: Did Lisa say where she was flying to?",
        "Damian: No, but I have contacts who can find out for us. Remember what I said?",

        "Hunter: Are you leaving?",
        "Emily: Yes, Hunter, I am leaving. Occasionally, I have a life outside of the office. You ought to try it sometime.",
        "Hunter: Well, where are you going? I mean, just in case I need to get in touch with you.",
        "Emily: Alison is getting an award when she graduates from nursing school.",
        "Hunter: She is?",
        "Emily: Yes, so we're gonna take her to dinner at the Lakeview. So I'm gonna go there, make a reservation, and, I don't know, make sure they do something nice for her.",
        "Hunter: You should get her a cake.",
        "Emily: A cake.",
        "Hunter: Yeah. Cakes are celebratory. Oh, God. I think it's so great you're doing something for Alison's party.",
        "Emily: No, no, no. This is not a party, it's a gathering. It's Casey and my family, which is basically my mother. My mother. Oh, I got to call my mother. Hold this.",
        "Hunter: What about Alison's father, too?",
        "Emily: I don't think anyone would bother to call the great Dr. Larry McDermott and tell him the good news.",
        "Hunter: Why not?",
        "Emily: It doesn't matter, okay? Just -- I got to go. Okay, don't screw things up. You are officially off duty.",

        "Casey: No. It's just that something suddenly came up.",
        "Alison: Casey, you did this? Wait. You can't just go switch shifts around on me.",
        "Casey: Yeah, well, clearly, I can, and I just did.",
        "Alison: Well, can you change it back?",
        "Casey: No. Too late.",
        "Alison: Casey, I take my job really seriously. I have a responsibility to the patients. I can't just go --",
        "Casey: Ali, shut up! I'm trying to surprise you. Why do you make everything so impossible?",
        "Alison: What are you talking about?",
        "Casey: We're gonna go out to dinner with your family, celebrate your award -- you, me, your mom, Emily.",
        "Alison: You and Emily at the same table? You call that a celebration?",
        "Casey: It's gonna be interesting.",
        "Alison: Try a disaster.",
        "Casey: Hey, it'll be a story we can tell our kids. You know, remember that time we went out --",
        "Alison: Okay. Whoa. We've been officially dating a week. Slow down the whole kids thing.",
        "Casey: Oh, I see. We're gonna have to do this the hard way, aren't we?",
        "Alison: Casey! Oh, my God! What are you doing? Put me down!",
        "Casey: Will you sign her out for me?",
        "Nurse: You got it.",

        "Emily: I don't care. Up. Let's go.",
        "Hunter: What's this?",
        "Emily: A gift for Alison.",
        "Hunter: Did you get her a cake?",
        "Emily: Yes. It's in that tiny, little box. You'd better pray I get these articles up and running before my dinner.",
        "Hunter: Look, I'll take care of it.",
        "Emily: You should have taken care of this before.",
        "Hunter: They haven't been sent in yet.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. Unbelievable.",
        "Hunter: But I did use my time wisely.",
        "Emily: Well, I guess you get a gold star now, don't you?",
        "Hunter: I got a present for Alison.",
        "Emily: You what? You were supposed to stay here.",
        "Hunter: Oh, I did. I ordered it online.",
        "Emily: What did you get her?",
        "Hunter: Well, you know how you said that you hadn't gotten in touch with Alison's father?",
        "Emily: No. I didn't say that.",
        "Hunter: So, I used our database, and I tracked down a Dr. Larry McDermott in Chicago, Illinois, and I sent him an invitation to Alison's dinner.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: Grandma! Hey, what's up?",

        "Casey: Do you have anything in my size?",
        "Lisa: Don't be so silly.",
        "Casey: No. I would like to get a new dress for the pretty lady for tonight.",
        "Alison: What? No. You are not buying me a dress.",
        "Casey: Why not?",
        "Alison: 'Cause you can't afford it.",
        "Casey: It's a graduation present, and I have a family discount, right?",
        "Lisa: Yeah.",
        "Alison: Casey, you are going overboard with this.",
        "Casey: Grandma, can you back me up here? Not only is she graduating nursing school. She is getting an award. Now, doesn't that deserve a new dress?",
        "Alison: It's really not that big of a deal, and I keep trying to tell him that, but he refuses to listen.",
        "Lisa: No, Darling. Anytime you get a big award, it's a big deal, and I think I have just the one for you.",
        "Casey: Yes.",
        "Alison: You don't have to do this.",
        "Casey: Let me have a little fun, please.",
        "Alison: Well, why is your fun always at my expense?",
        "Casey: Technically, it's at my expense.",
        "Lisa: Here, try this on. You'll look stunning.",
        "Casey: So, Grandma, this family discount, it's really big, right?",
        "Lisa: Oh, the biggest.",
        "Casey: Thank you. You're the best.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: What were you thinking?",
        "Hunter: That I'd be doing something nice for Alison.",
        "Emily: By inviting Alison's father to dinner?",
        "Hunter: Well, you said it was a family celebration.",
        "Emily: Larry McDermott is not family, Hunter!",
        "Hunter: He's Alison's father.",
        "Emily: No, no! What he is is a deadbeat loser who hasn't been part of Ali's life for 18 years! He is the absolute last person Ali would want there tonight!",
        "Hunter: Oh, I didn't know.",
        "Emily: No kidding.",
        "Hunter: Look, it was just w-w-w-when you said that you hadn't bothered to track down Alison's father --",
        "Emily: Well, you took that to mean that no one had gotten around to it?",
        "Hunter: It could have meant a lot of things.",
        "Emily: It didn't mean \"Hunter, send the man an invitation,\" for God's sake!",
        "Hunter: I'm sorry. I really am.",
        "Emily: Can you take it back?",
        "Hunter: I can apologize to Alison if you think that would help.",
        "Emily: Oh, my God. The invitation, Hunter. Can you take it back? Can you delete it or retrieve it or something?",
        "Hunter: No.",
        "Emily: What the hell possessed you to do this?",
        "Hunter: It's just Alison's always been so nice to me. You know, most people just dismiss me or ask me to fix their computers. I just wanted to do something nice for her.",
        "Emily: For God's sake, next time send her a card or a pi\u00f1ata!",
        "Hunter: Okay. So, what should I do? Should I maybe try to warn her?",
        "Emily: Don't do anything.",
        "Hunter: Are you sure?",
        "Emily: Yes, I'm sure. Larry hasn't shown up for Alison in the past 18 years. I doubt he's gonna turn into father of the year at this late date.",

        "Paul: You double-crossed me.",
        "Barbara: No, I didn't. I've done everything you asked me to do.",
        "Paul: You weren't followed?",
        "Barbara: Followed? By whom?",
        "Paul: Meg and Damian. I just saw them!",
        "Barbara: That's impossible. No one knows that I'm here.",
        "Paul: Nobody?",
        "Barbara: Nobody knew where I was going. I didn't see anyone when I left, ex-- except --",
        "Paul: Except?",
        "Barbara: Oh, my God. I know what happened. I'm sorry, Paul. I'm sorry. This is not my fault.",
        "Paul: I don't care. It's too late.",
        "Barbara: No, no. Go somewhere else. Tell me where to meet you.",
        "Paul: No! You had your chance, and you blew it! I'm done! You are never hearing from me again!",
        "Barbara: Paul, don't do this! Paul!",
        "Paul: Goodbye, Mother!",
        "Barbara: Where are you? I know you're here! Paul saw you! Do you have any idea what you have done? Damn you!",
        "Meg: What we've done? You promised you weren't gonna help him!",
        "Barbara: I wasn't helping him, but thanks to you, you have ruined everything!",
        "Meg: What exactly did we ruin, Barbara, Paul's big escape?",
        "Barbara: No. He was going to talk to me until he saw the two of you.",
        "Meg: Well, you should have told us what you were doing.",
        "Barbara: Why? So you could plan something like this? You scared him off, Meg!",
        "Damian: That wasn't our intention, Barbara.",
        "Barbara: He trusted me. He wanted to see me.",
        "Meg: And we trusted you! You promised us that you would tell us as soon as you heard from him!",
        "Barbara: And he told me that if I told anyone that he had been in contact with me, he would disappear for good. I couldn't take that risk.",
        "Damian: What did he want?",
        "Barbara: Money.",
        "Meg: And you were gonna give it to him?",
        "Barbara: Yes! No!",
        "Meg: Well, what is it?",
        "Barbara: I wanted to talk to him. I wanted to convince him that bringing Eliza home was the best thing.",
        "Meg: You thought you could reason with him? That was your plan?",
        "Barbara: I thought I could get him to listen to me!",
        "Meg: I thought you wanted to help us.",
        "Barbara: Why do you think I'm here?",
        "Meg: Honestly, I think you're here because you want to help Paul get away with my daughter.",
        "Barbara: She's my granddaughter, and I did what I had to do!",
        "Meg: You had a choice, Barbara, and you chose Paul over Eliza!",
        "Barbara: If you had heard him on the phone and heard how desperate he was --",
        "Meg: I don't care!",
        "Barbara: Well, maybe you should! You know better than anyone how Paul reacts when he's cornered, and look what we've done to him. We've scared him off now. There's no telling what he's gonna do.",
        "Damian: Where is Paul now?",
        "Barbara: I don't know.",
        "Damian: Why don't you try to get him back on his cell?",
        "Barbara: Sure. I'll try. He said I wouldn't hear from him again.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Meg: What is that? Do you hear that?",
        "Damian: It's a cell phone.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Wait.",
        "Casey: What? Did you forget something?",
        "Alison: No. I just -- I need a minute.",
        "Casey: Okay. Come here. What's wrong?",
        "Alison: Nothing.",
        "Casey: Nothing's wrong?",
        "Alison: Yeah, and I think it's sort of making me freak out a little.",
        "Casey: You're stressing out over nothing?",
        "Alison: Yeah. Is that a little weird.",
        "Casey: A little.",
        "Alison: How do I explain this? For the first time in my life, I can honestly say that everything is good.",
        "Casey: Is that a bad thing?",
        "Alison: It's just, it's a new thing.",
        "Casey: You've never been happy before?",
        "Alison: Not like this. And, you know, I just got this little award, but you've turned it into this thing.",
        "Casey: Well, should I not have done that?",
        "Alison: When I was growing up, my mom and Emily, you know, they both had these amazing, time-consuming careers, and I was just always sort of there. You know, people only paid attention to me when I screwed up. So I'd just keep messing things up so that someone, anyone, would notice me.",
        "Casey: I don't think you're the first person to take that approach.",
        "Alison: Probably not, but I perfected it. And now for once, I've done something that is actually worth being proud of.",
        "Casey: Hello. What have I been telling you?",
        "Alison: I know, and I want to thank you for that.",
        "Casey: For what?",
        "Alison: For taking the time to make me say that and for even just saying it yourself.",
        "Casey: I've been saying it for a long time. Now it's time for everybody else to say it. You know, you've really been kicking butt lately.",
        "Alison: Yeah, I have.",
        "Casey: It feels good, doesn't it? Perhaps maybe I should try it.",
        "Alison: You should. It's amazing.",
        "Casey: Does this mean we can go eat?",
        "Alison: Yeah.",
        "Casey: Good. I'm starving. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Meg: What is that?",
        "Damian: A disposable cell. Paul probably has a dozen of these.",
        "Meg: So, what do we do now?",
        "Damian: I don't know, but I think it's safe to say that if Paul was here, he's gone now.",
        "Meg: Well, I didn't see a plane or a car. He must be on foot.",
        "Damian: We don't know what direction he ran off in, so it's gonna be almost impossible for us to track him.",
        "Meg: Okay. Well, what about those small towns that we drove through on our way here? He might be hiding out in one of them.",
        "Damian: Maybe. But he knows we're here, so he's gonna be keeping an eye out for us.",
        "Barbara: And if he sees you first, he'll run again.",
        "Meg: So, what are you saying? We should just give up?",
        "Damian: No. I think we should go back to Oakdale and tell the police what we know.",
        "Barbara: I think Damian's right.",
        "Meg: And what if he calls again? What are you gonna tell him?",
        "Barbara: Nothing.",
        "Damian: Meg, the police can canvas this area faster than we can, and if they do find Paul, then we can be back here in no time at all.",
        "Meg: Okay. You know what? You both keep talking about Paul, but Eliza is here, too! How can you ask me to leave when we are so close to her?",
        "Damian: Meg, we're not doing Eliza any good standing around here in the middle of nowhere. We need the police to help us find her.",
        "Barbara: The police can be very discrete, and that's what we need. We don't want Paul feeling cornered.",
        "Meg: I don't care what Paul feels.",
        "Barbara: If Paul feels safe, chances are he'll stop running.",
        "Meg: You'd better pray to God that he keeps my daughter safe, because if anything happens to her --",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Hey. Is she asleep?",
        "Rosanna: She just went down.",
        "Paul: I hope she wasn't any trouble.",
        "Rosanna: No. She was a perfect angel.",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, she gets that from me. Possible.",
        "Rosanna: How was your meeting?",
        "Paul: Complicated.",
        "Rosanna: So, I suppose you'll be headed back to Oakdale now?",
        "Paul: I promised you an explanation. Do you want to hear it now?",
        "Rosanna: You know what? I thought about it, and I realized that whatever it is that you're doing here, it's really none of my business, and when you leave here, I'm probably never gonna see you again. So have a nice life, you and Eliza both.",
        "Paul: The truth is I have no place to go. The cleaning products on the left cost sixty-two fourteen",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean you don't have anyplace to go?",
        "Paul: I think you know what I mean. I don't have anyplace to go.",
        "Rosanna: You do have a home in Oakdale, don't you? Meg is there, your wife, waiting for you. Right?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, Meg and I, we're kind of having some problems.",
        "Rosanna: Really? What kind of problems?",
        "Paul: Well, marriage is difficult.",
        "Rosanna: No kidding. Maybe you're just having a hard time right now. Maybe you should go back and deal.",
        "Paul: A little late for that. We're divorced.",
        "Rosanna: Oh.",
        "Paul: And we're kind of not seeing eye to eye right now on some of the bigger issues.",
        "Rosanna: So, she's who you're running from.",
        "Paul: No. Are you kidding? I begged her to stay. She ran out on me.",
        "Rosanna: Please don't tell me you kidnapped this baby.",
        "Paul: No. I didn't kidnap the baby. I have full custody of Eliza.",
        "Rosanna: You do?",
        "Paul: Yes. Look, I don't need Meg's permission to be here. The court declared her an unfit mother.",
        "Rosanna: Meg Snyder, an unfit mother? How did you pull that off?",
        "Paul: Well, she endangered Eliza's life. It's a matter of public record.",
        "Rosanna: What did she do?",
        "Paul: It doesn't matter what she did. I was awarded custody, and I have every legal right to be here right now.",
        "Rosanna: Okay. So, why are you hiding from Meg?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Okay, raise your glass. I want to make a toast. To my little -- to my sister, a young, beautiful woman of grace and integrity, and I know that we've had our share of differences over the years.",
        "Alison: That's putting it mildly.",
        "Emily: Very mildly. But I have always, always loved you, Ali. I've always been proud of you. Never more than I am right now.",
        "Alison: You're gonna make me cry.",
        "[Emily laughs]",
        "Emily: Too bad. To Alison.",
        "Casey: To Alison.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry. Can you excuse me for a minute?",
        "Casey: Yeah, sure. Yeah.",
        "Emily: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Paul: Look, I'm sorry if I led you to believe that Meg and I were doing okay.",
        "Rosanna: You mean you're sorry that you lied to me? Believe me, I'm not surprised.",
        "Paul: I never lied to you about Eliza.",
        "Rosanna: You know, why don't we just have it out? You know, tell me what's going on. What happened with you and Meg?",
        "Paul: She just wasn't the person that I thought she was.",
        "Rosanna: What does that mean?",
        "Paul: It means that I thought she'd love me forever, and I thought that I would be the only one that she would ever need, and that turned out to not be true.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I'm sorry.",
        "Paul: Oh, come on. You're not a little pleased? You don't think this is something that I deserve?",
        "Rosanna: No, I didn't say that. I didn't say that.",
        "Paul: Okay, look. I know that I am the last person in the world who should ever ask anyone to be perfect, and I know that I didn't make things easy for Meg.",
        "Rosanna: Or for yourself.",
        "Paul: But she let me think that she was somebody that she just wasn't. She let me think that she was somebody that I could trust, that she would love me and understand me no matter what.",
        "Rosanna: Really, I'm so-- it must have been very hard on you when it ended.",
        "Paul: It was. She was -- I thought I was losing everything. And then we started to fight over custody.",
        "Rosanna: And the court sided with you?",
        "Paul: Yeah. Eventually, yes.",
        "Rosanna: It's very unusual for them to pick the father over the mother.",
        "Paul: Well, you know, lawyers and judges and social workers, they all just did what they thought was best, and that's why, you know, for the moment, I have full and legal custody.",
        "Rosanna: For the moment. You mean Meg's still fighting for custody?",
        "Paul: Yeah.",
        "Rosanna: That's why you're here. That's why you're hiding from Meg. You know, that's crazy. You're not helping your case by disappearing like this.",
        "Paul: Well, I haven't broken any laws, you know, and if they can't find me, then they can't take Eliza away from me.",
        "Rosanna: What are you talking about? Do you hear yourself? Do you hear the way you're contradicting yourself?",
        "Paul: I do. You don't understand. I've never loved anyone like I love this child.",
        "Rosanna: Paul, of course I understand. Come on, believe me. I do. But that doesn't mean that I should get involved.",
        "Paul: But I need your help.",
        "Rosanna: I can't help you, Paul.",
        "Paul: Yes, you can. You can let us stay here, with you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Barbara: Thank you for bringing me home from the airport.",
        "Damian: Of course.",
        "Barbara: If you can just understand the position that I was in.",
        "Meg: You put yourself in that position when you agreed to help Paul.",
        "Barbara: No, no, no. I did it to buy time. I thought that if I could just meet with him face-to-face I could convince him to bring Eliza back. I'm as worried about her as you are.",
        "Meg: Then why aren't you terrified that he still has her?",
        "Barbara: Because he's my son. You can't expect me to turn my back on him.",
        "Meg: You can't protect Paul and tell me that you're worried about my daughter at the same time.",
        "Barbara: You expect me to choose between them? I can't do that!",
        "Meg: Then it was a mistake for me to trust you. That won't happen again.",
        "Barbara: Well, maybe if you had trusted me more, I could have convinced Paul to do the right thing today!",
        "Meg: Barbara, he only contacted you because he wanted something from you! You have no control over him, and you can't keep letting him call the shots. It just empowers him.",
        "Barbara: Well, I'd rather that he feels empowered than running scared.",
        "Damian: All right, look. We all want the same thing here, and that's to bring Eliza home. Let's try to remember that.",
        "Barbara: Yes, that's right.",
        "Damian: Now, Barbara, if Paul calls again, will you please --",
        "Barbara: I will let you know. I promise.",
        "Meg: Just like you promised last time? I don't care how Paul justifies what he's doing when he spoke to you on the phone, but you and I both know that as long as Eliza's with him, her life is in danger. It's Eliza that needs to be rescued, not Paul.",
        "Barbara: You and I are gonna have a little talk, my friend.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Hunter: I know you said you didn't think Alison's father would show up, but I thought, on the off chance, if he does, I could stand guard.",
        "Emily: Stand guard? You? You have the intimidation factor of a zygote.",
        "Hunter: Look, I won't interrupt Alison's celebration. I promise. I'll stay right here, okay?",
        "Emily: Here? Alone? At the bar? Watching us? Because that's not weird or creepy.",
        "Hunter: Think about it.",
        "Emily: I have thought about it. It's weird and creepy.",
        "Hunter: If I see Larry coming through the lobby, I can stop him before he comes and upsets everyone.",
        "Emily: You don't even know what he looks like!",
        "Hunter: I looked him up on the web.",
        "Emily: Oh, for God's sake. Listen to me, Hunter. The man is not coming, okay? And the only one who's upsetting everyone is you.",
        "Casey: What do you think that's all about?",
        "Alison: I have no idea, but I think Emily just called Hunter a goat.",
        "Casey: A goat?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I could be wrong about that.",
        "Casey: Come on. You don't think he came here on purpose?",
        "Alison: What? Why?",
        "Casey: He works with Emily. He knew we were gonna be here.",
        "Alison: Oh. He probably feels left out.",
        "Casey: Yeah, because he was.",
        "Alison: You know, I'm gonna ask him to join us.",
        "Casey: No, no. Please, don't.",
        "Alison: Come on. We're the only friends he has here.",
        "Casey: I thought you said you didn't want to encourage him.",
        "Alison: Well, I think we can handle being friends.",
        "Casey: But what if he asks you out again.",
        "Alison: Oh, are you jealous?",
        "Casey: Of Poindexter? No, no.",
        "Alison: Good, 'cause you have no reason to be.",
        "Emily: I want you to leave now.",
        "Alison: Emily, stop. Hunter doesn't have to leave.",
        "Hunter: No. Emily's right. I shouldn't be here. I'm sorry I interrupted your celebration.",
        "Alison: You didn't, and I would like you to join us, please.",
        "Hunter: Okay.",
        "Alison: All right. So, we just need one more chair, and then we'll be fine. Oh, my God.",
        "Casey: What?",
        "Alison: That man in the doorway.",
        "Casey: What about him?",
        "Alison: It's my father.",
        "Alison: What is he doing here?",
        "Emily: I'm gonna kill you.",
        "Casey: I'm gonna ask him to leave.",
        "Alison: No.",
        "Larry: I hear congratulations are in order. May I give my daughter a hug?",
        "Alison: Don't.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Lisa: I just don't understand why you are so mad at me.",
        "Barbara: Oh, knock it off! You probably thought you were helping, didn't you? Spying on me and reporting back to Meg and Damian.",
        "Lisa: Well, all right. Yes. Yes, I did. I don't know what in the world were you thinking, helping Paul to escape with that precious baby.",
        "Barbara: I was trying to bring my granddaughter home, and now, thanks to your interference, that may never happen.",
        "Damian: What did Jack say when you spoke to him?",
        "Meg: He said he was arranging for a team to search the area right away.",
        "Damian: See? The police will be able to cover a lot of ground. Paul is not gonna get away.",
        "Meg: What if Barbara's right? What if this makes Paul more desperate and then he ends up doing something drastic?",
        "Damian: I don't believe Paul will ever put Eliza in harm's way.",
        "Meg: I don't either, but I know he loves her, but I just feel that the longer this goes on, the more it's gonna impair his judgment, and he'll lose the ability to keep her safe.",
        "Damian: You can't think like that, Meg. Paul is not gonna do anything to endanger his child. We came so close to finding him today. It's just a matter of time now.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rosanna: So, you want to stay here.",
        "Paul: Well, for the time being, yeah.",
        "Rosanna: Paul --",
        "Paul: Look, I have no money, and I have no way of accessing any of my accounts without tipping Meg off about where I am, and I have no way to leave.",
        "Rosanna: Well, what happened at the airport?",
        "Paul: I thought I was gonna get some money.",
        "Rosanna: And?",
        "Paul: And it fell through. Look, if I leave, they'll catch me, and they'll take away from me the only reason that I have for living.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I think that the best thing that you can do for Eliza is to just take her home, okay?",
        "Paul: I am her home.",
        "Rosanna: I think you need to consider very, very carefully about what you are doing to this child.",
        "Paul: I have considered everything very carefully, and she is very happy with me. You've seen that for yourself. Okay, and if I go back to Oakdale, then they'll reverse the custody agreement, and they'll take Eliza away from me, and I don't think I could stand that.",
        "Rosanna: Do you think that if you just say all the right things and play me just right that I'll just give you what you want?",
        "Paul: I'm not playing you. I'm telling you the truth. Look, it's for like a week, you know? I'll do whatever I have to do around here to earn our keep to cover the expenses of having us here.",
        "Rosanna: Paul, this is a co-op. We don't hire outside workers.",
        "Paul: I don't mean to put you on the spot.",
        "Rosanna: No. I think that's exactly what you mean to do.",
        "Paul: And if it was me alone, you know, I would never ask you for anything.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, really?",
        "Paul: But my little girl, okay, she needs some food, and she needs somewhere warm and safe where she can sleep, and I don't have anywhere to go, and I don't have anybody to turn to except you.",
        "Rosanna: Sorry, Paul. The answer's no.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Emily: What have you done now, Hunter?",
        "Hunter: Okay. I ran in to Alison's father at Java, and I told him where to find her.",
        "Alison: Wait.",
        "Casey: He's hurt you enough for a lifetime. Don't let him keep doing it.",
        "Paul: Don't you want to wipe the slate completely clean? I'll tell you what. You help me now, and we're even."
