        "Katie: I don't get it. The lighting looked so good on set, right? It's -- we can't use this. I'm gonna have to call Chris.",

        "Katie: Chris, its Katie.",
        "Chris: Hey, how are you?",
        "Katie: Not good. Are you busy?",
        "Chris: Well, I'm working.",
        "Katie: When do you get off?",
        "Chris: Well, soon. Why?",
        "Katie: I need a favor. Some of the footage we shot for Lisa's show just didn't come out.",
        "Chris: You're kidding me.",
        "Katie: I think we need to reshoot it.",
        "Chris: Well, Katie, I am a doctor, not an actor. Didn't we shoot that show live? I mean, why would we have to do it again?",
        "Katie: Because I want to give Lisa a DVD copy of the show, and during the broadcast, some of the scenes got messed up. So I was just wondering, maybe, can you drop by the studio after your shift?",
        "Chris: You're sure you can't use any of that stuff that we shot before?",
        "Katie: It really won't take that long.",
        "Chris: Okay, okay. I will -- I'll come over as soon as I'm done here.",
        "Katie: Great. You're the best. Thanks. Okay. We'll need to be totally set up. Thanks.",

        "Casey: I heard you in the hallway.",
        "Alison: It's this new monitor. It's, like, frozen. I don't know what its problem is.",
        "Casey: You want me to take a look?",
        "Alison: Yeah. I mean, if you don't mind.",
        "Casey: Okay.",
        "Alison: I already did that.",
        "Casey: Okay. Did you try resetting it? I'm sorry. I had to ask. I mean, it has to be the controls or the wire or something.",
        "Alison: Meaning you have no clue.",
        "Casey: Yep. Have you tried hitting it?",
        "Alison: It costs $30,000.",
        "Casey: It's already broken. It's not gonna hurt it.",
        "Alison: No, I'm not gonna hit it. I'll just call purchasing, and they'll have to deal with it.",
        "Casey: I'm sorry I couldn't help.",
        "Alison: No, no, no. Thank you for trying. Casey?",
        "Casey: Yeah?",
        "Alison: I'm sorry about butting into your relationship with Vienna.",
        "Casey: It's fine. It's okay.",
        "Alison: I know, it's none of my business.",
        "Casey: No, it's cool. It's not really a -- it's more of a casual thing than a relationship thing.",
        "Alison: All right. So, we're okay?",
        "Casey: Yeah, fine. Can I ask you something, actually?",
        "Alison: Yeah, of course.",
        "Casey: Why are you so sure I can't trust her?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Vienna: Oh, come on. Come on, please. I'm gonna close my eyes, and when I open them, you're gonna be positive. Counting to five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, damn it!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Henry: Hey, Liebchen. I've got applesauce and white bread, crackers, all kinds of things that won't upset your stomach.",
        "Vienna: Oh, you're so sweet, Henry.",
        "Henry: Are you still having the morning sickness?",
        "Vienna: Yeah, a little bit.",
        "Henry: Here, try the crackers now. That worked last time.",
        "Vienna: No, that's really not what's gonna make me feel better.",
        "Henry: Okay. Well, I got other stuff in here.",
        "Vienna: It's not in the bag, either.",
        "Henry: Did I forget something?",
        "Vienna: No.",
        "Henry: Why don't I go back to the store?",
        "Vienna: No, no, no. It's not in the store, either. It's right here. Here.",

        "Emma: Here you go, Mr. Prager.",
        "Meg: It has to make a difference, right? Emily left my baby alone in a car while she went chasing after some criminal. I mean, the judge has to realize that she can't be trusted.",
        "Emma: Of course, he will. More coffee, Mr. Prager?",
        "Prager: No question the incident will adversely affect Mr. Ryan's case, but you still have issues of your own.",
        "Emma: Yes, but what she has in her favor is that she's Eliza's mother.",
        "Meg: And Paul is her father.",
        "Emma: Yes. But Emily's the one that's going to be alone with her when Paul is not around. I mean, the judge has to realize that the baby's not safe there.",
        "Meg: Mama.",
        "Emma: Now, this is not an isolated incident with Emily. Emily Stewart has a long, long history of reckless behavior.",
        "Prager: I will need conclusive evidence to present to the judge.",
        "Emma: Well, we -- we don't actually have any evidence.",
        "Prager: Well, then let's hope that the judge is in a sympathetic mood. I will let myself out.",
        "Emma: He makes it seem as if what Emily did doesn't matter.",
        "Meg: Well, we have to make it matter.",
        "Emma: You know, Eliza, your baby, is -- her well-being is in question, and it feels as if there's nothing we can do about it.",
        "Meg: Maybe there is.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emily: Yes, yes. Okay. We're gonna go to the pediatrician just for a quick little check-up, okay? And then we'll go to the zoo. We'll go to the zoo and see all the baby ducks, just me and you. Does that sound fun? Okay. Hi.",
        "Paul: Hey. Where you going?",
        "Emily: Pediatrician and then the zoo.",
        "Paul: I have a meeting.",
        "Emily: That's okay. Looks like it's just gonna be you and me, huh?",
        "Paul: Well, I could cancel the meeting. That way I can go with you.",
        "Emily: You don't have to do that.",
        "Paul: I want to.",
        "Emily: You really don't trust me alone with her, do you?",
        "Paul: Of course I trust you alone with Eliza. I just want to go with you, that's all.",
        "Emily: I know it was stupid of me to leave her in the car alone like that. It was a mistake, okay, and it never would have happened if Carmody hadn't held me at gunpoint.",
        "Paul: And it never would have happened if you hadn't gone chasing after him and left Eliza alone in the car.",
        "Emily: I don't know how many times I can say I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It will never happen again.",
        "Paul: That's right. It won't. Because the next time you go chasing after a gun-toting lunatic, you're gonna at least call me first or maybe a babysitter.",
        "Emily: I'm sorry, okay? I don't want to scare you like that ever again.",
        "Paul: It's not just that. This plays right into Meg's hands.",
        "Emily: I know. And the fact that Meg can use this now to take Eliza away from us is the worst part of it.",
        "Paul: That's not gonna happen.",
        "Emily: I hope not. I just love her so much, Paul.",
        "Paul: I know you do.",
        "Emily: I love that she's part of our family. You know, I want to keep it this way.",
        "Paul: Me, too.",
        "Emily: And that's why I'm gonna prove to the judge that I am the best mother for her.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Emma: Meg, I hope you're not thinking of playing any tricks on Emily.",
        "Meg: No tricks, Mama. I swear.",
        "Emma: Because you heard what Mr. Prager said. Your case is shaky enough as it is already.",
        "Meg: I am not gonna play any tricks. Who was it who said that, if I wanted my daughter back, I should think more like Emily?",
        "Emma: Think like her so you could outsmart her, not to get down in the dirt with her.",
        "Meg: Well, that seems to be where the fight is.",
        "Emma: Well, you had better stay above it, because that is her territory, not yours.",
        "Meg: I have to do something.",
        "Emma: Well, you had better be careful. You don't want to give the judge any more reasons to doubt you.",
        "Meg: I don't intend to.",
        "Emma: What do you intend on doing?",
        "Meg: Behave as responsibly as I can and show the judge that I'm getting my life together again.",
        "Emma: And how are you going to do that?",
        "Meg: I'm gonna start by getting my job back.",
        "Emma: Well, you told me before that you tried, and that you didn't think that you would be able to pass the psychiatric evaluation.",
        "Meg: I thought you were on my side.",
        "Emma: Sweetheart, I am!",
        "Meg: Okay, then please support me.",
        "Emma: Well, what are you going to do about passing the evaluation?",
        "Meg: I'm not gonna take it.",
        "Emma: You told me your friend said you had to.",
        "Meg: She said that hospital policy requires that every employee take it.",
        "Emma: Well, then, Sweetheart, you have no choice.",
        "Meg: Not unless I go to the man who sets policy.",
        "Emma: You mean Bob Hughes?",
        "Meg: Mm-hmm. He likes me. He knows me. Maybe he could waive the evaluation for me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Casey: You keep telling me not to trust Vienna, but you never tell me why.",
        "Alison: I did tell you why. She's committed to Henry.",
        "Casey: That's no secret.",
        "Alison: And sooner or later, they'll get back together, and then she'll be done with you.",
        "Casey: Yeah, probably.",
        "Alison: And that doesn't bother you?",
        "Casey: Why should it? I mean, we're just having fun, which is fine with me.",
        "Alison: Yeah, but she's involved with someone else.",
        "Casey: Yeah. I -- I agree with you. That's her problem, not mine.",
        "Alison: I -- I just can't believe this doesn't bother you.",
        "Casey: Because getting involved with women has worked out so well for me in the past?",
        "Alison: Some day it will.",
        "Casey: I -- I don't think you're the person to be telling me that.",
        "Alison: You're right. I'm sorry.",
        "Casey: No, look. All I'm trying to say is I'm not looking for a lifetime commitment here.",
        "Alison: What are you looking for?",
        "Casey: I think you should call maintenance and have them fix this. Talk to you later.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Katie: Oh, what am I doing?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Alison: Just forget it!",
        "Chris: Forget what?",
        "Alison: This thing refuses to work. I'm just gonna call someone.",
        "Chris: Did you try hitting it?",
        "Alison: That's what Casey said.",
        "Chris: And?",
        "Alison: I don't want to break it.",
        "Chris: It's already broken.",
        "Alison: Casey said that, too.",
        "Chris: Do it.",
        "Alison: No, you do it. You're the boss' kid, not me.",
        "Chris: Okay.",
        "Alison: Let me see. You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Chris: Well, I am Chris Hughes, and that's how I operate. You're welcome.",
        "Alison: Oh, Chris. About our date.",
        "Chris: Oh, you need to postpone?",
        "Alison: No. I was thinking that maybe we should go see a movie.",
        "Chris: Oh, I thought we were gonna start off with pizza and fun conversation.",
        "Alison: Well, how about an upgrade? There's this movie I really want to see.",
        "Chris: Chick flick?",
        "Alison: No, actually, it's a horror movie. It's that one with the guy with the electric ax.",
        "Chris: Electric -- really? You were never into that before.",
        "Alison: No, I know. I really got into it when I was with -- I was in nursing school.",
        "Chris: Yeah, yeah, I can see that. Okay.",
        "Alison: But, I mean, if you're not up for the gore.",
        "Chris: Alison? Gore, it's my business. Okay? Yeah.",
        "Alison: Okay. Then I'll see you when I get off.",
        "Chris: Okay. Oh, actually, I have to go over to WOAK Katie wants to reshoot some of the scenes we shot for Lisa's show. I don't know, some DVD thing, okay?",
        "Alison: Okay. Then I'll just come meet you there, if that's all right.",
        "Chris: Sounds great. Sounds great.",
        "Alison: Okay.",
        "Chris: All right.",
        "Alison: All right.",
        "Casey: Hey, Baby. It's me. I just walked past the storage closet and couldn't help thinking of you. Call me when you get this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Henry: Maybe this isn't such a good idea.",
        "Vienna: Why not?",
        "Henry: This early in the pregnancy? I mean, who knows what could happen?",
        "Vienna: Oh, nothing could happen.",
        "Henry: Yeah. We don't want to take any chances, not after last time.",
        "Vienna: That is so sweet, Henry, but I spoke to the doctor, and he said it's perfectly safe.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Vienna: They'll go away.",
        "Henry: No, but it -- it could be important.",
        "Barbara: Is this a bad time? I can see you're busy. So, I just wanted to drop this off.",
        "Vienna: Is it finished?",
        "Barbara: Not quite. I am out of the wedding dress business. You'll have to find someone else.",
        "Vienna: This is a little sudden, isn't it?",
        "Henry: We can find another seamstress.",
        "Barbara: I'm sure you will.",
        "Vienna: Well, maybe it's for the best anyways, given our creative differences. In fact, I think I'll go in a totally different direction.",
        "Barbara: Good luck with that.",
        "Henry: Barbara --",
        "Barbara: I have an appointment.",
        "Vienna: Now, where were we?",
        "Henry: How could you be so ungrateful?",
        "Vienna: What?",
        "Henry: She did all this work, and you just dismiss her?",
        "Vienna: She didn't do that much work. And it certainly wasn't good work, and she probably worked off an old pattern or something.",
        "Henry: It's not old. It's vintage.",
        "Vienna: Oh, who cares?",
        "Henry: I thought you did. You're the one that picked it out. You said it was perfect. You said it was everything that you wanted.",
        "Vienna: Well, I changed my mind.",
        "Henry: What? So you couldn't at least say thank you?",
        "Vienna: For what? She didn't finish the dress, and she threw it in my face.",
        "Henry: That's not true.",
        "Vienna: Why are you defending her?",
        "Henry: I'm not. I'm trying to be fair.",
        "Vienna: Not to me, you aren't. What are you doing?",
        "Henry: I'm gonna give this back to her. Maybe some other bride would like it.",
        "Vienna: Who cares about another bride?",
        "[Cell phone beeping]",
        "Casey: Hey, Baby. It's me. I just walked past the storage closet and couldn't help thinking of you. Call me when you get this.",

        "Henry: Barbara. Oh, sorry. Is Ms. Ryan in? Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Can I see this? What happened to this? Uh, I don't think this was meant to be thrown away. This meant a lot to Ms. Ryan.",
        "Maid: It was in the trash.",
        "Henry: Okay. Well, can I hold on -- I'm gonna hold on to this. My name's actually on it right here. See?",

        "Casey: Hear what?",
        "Chris: Me and Alison. We're just -- well, we're gonna go out for a little bit. Probably just a movie. Not a big deal or anything like that.",
        "Casey: Hey, it's cool. You know, it's cool.",
        "Chris: Are you sure? Because I know you two --",
        "Casey: No, it's over. It's over, and I'm actually seeing someone else.",

        "Chris: No problem. What scene are we reshooting, and do I need a breath mint?",
        "Katie: No, no, you don't. Just take Chris to makeup and wardrobe, and as soon as you're finished, we'll shoot.",
        "Chris: Okay, okay. Can I talk to you first?",

        "Katie: See? If you had listened to me from the very beginning, you'd be on your tenth date, not your first.",
        "Chris: That's very true.",
        "Katie: Great. Well, I'm really happy for both of you.",

        "Meg: That could have cost Eliza her life.",
        "Emily: Oh, will you stop exaggerating.",
        "Meg: I am not exaggerating anything. I don't want you taking my daughter anywhere on your own.",

        "Alison: What are you doing?",
        "Emily: Nothing. I came by to the doctor's office, and she was there.",
        "Alison: So you decided to goad her?",
        "Emily: No.",
        "Alison: Hey, the last thing Eliza needs is a public shouting match between her mother and her stepmother.",
        "Emily: Yeah. No kidding. I'm not the one who started the fight.",
        "Alison: Does it really matter? I mean, haven't we had enough of our own family fights to know that they end badly for everyone?",
        "Emily: Okay. The only way this can end badly is if the judge gives custody to Meg, and if that happens, it will be war. Come on. I got to take you home. I'll see you later.",
        "Alison: Bye.",
        "Nurse: Alison, we have a problem. These drugs are missing, and they weren't signed out.",
        "Alison: Are you sure no one took them?",
        "Nurse: I asked everyone.",
        "Alison: Okay. Well, we better find out where they are. I mean, if the wrong person takes them, this could be really serious. Come on.",
