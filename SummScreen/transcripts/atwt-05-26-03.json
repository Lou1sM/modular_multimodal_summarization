        "Alison: Did you find Mr. Goff?  \r\n",
        "Katie: No.  I've checked every room in this entire wing.  This is insane.  \r\nHe has to be somewhere.  What about the waiting rooms?  \r\n",
        "Alison: I already checked them. This is crazy. Katie, I only left him \r\nalone for like two minutes. I'm dead. I'm dead.\r\n\r\n",

        "Alison: Nothing.  \r\n",
        "Susan: Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.  Katie?  One of you has to tell me.  \r\nPlease?  \r\n",
        "Alison: I did something really terrible. I lost Mr. Goff.\r\n\r\n",
        "Bob: Did I hear you right?  Did you say you lost a patient?  \r\n",
        "Alison: I'm really sorry, Dr. Hughes.  I -- I left Mr. Goff right outside of his \r\ndoor in his wheelchair.  And I went inside to help Katie change the sheets.  \r\nAnd when I came out, he was gone.  \r\n",
        "Katie: And Mr. Goff is Dr. Dixon's patient.  \r\n",
        "Bob: Oh, great.  That's all I need.  \r\n",

        "Dusty: Are you busy, or are you ticked off?  \r\n",
        "John: A little bit of both.  What kind of game were you running on Paul, \r\nhuh?  He was one of your best friends.  \r\n",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I had my reasons.  You gotta trust me on that.  \r\n",
        "John: Trust you?  Fine, fine.  Fine, you tell me the reasons you hurt a friend \r\nlike that.  \r\n",
        "Dusty: I had problems.  I had problems, and there was only one way out.  \r\n",
        "John: Well, I guess molly's right.  You run with a rough crowd, huh?  I didn't \r\nwant to believe her.  What the hell happened to you?  \r\n",
        "Dusty: What is this?  Look at the disappointment on your face.  I'm just -- I \r\ndidn't want to let you down, that's for sure.  \r\n",
        "John: You should worry more about letting yourself down.  \r\n",
        "Dusty: You have no idea.  \r\n",
        "John: Well, then you tell me, okay?  You help me out here.  What is it?  \r\nGambling debts?  Drugs?  You stabbed your friends in the back -- \r\n",

        "Stanley: Went right to reception.  He was looking for some friend.  So, back \r\nto Chicago?  \r\n",
        "Spangler: Actually, I'm in the mood to do a little fishing. I'm dying to \r\nfind out what makes Rose D'Angelo so irresistible to our pal Dusty.\t\r\n\r\n",

        "Jack: All I'm asking you to do is clear up a few inconsistencies in your \r\nstatement.  \r\n",
        "Rosanna: Well, why don't we clear up yours first?  Like the fact that you, \r\none of Oakdale's finest, have just been released from jail for being an accessory \r\nto kidnapping after the fact.  \r\n",
        "Jack: Are you finished?  \r\n",
        "Rosanna: How dare you interrogate me.  I haven't committed any crime.  \r\n",

        "Susan: Do you wanna tell him or should I?  Alison misplaced a patient, \r\nMr. Goff.  \r\n",
        "Myrtle: Did you tell Dr. Hughes about my shoulder?  \r\n",
        "Alison: I only let him alone for like two minutes.  And when I came back, he \r\nwas gone.  \r\n",
        "Rick: Well, has anyone checked the men's rooms?  \r\n",
        "Alison: No, that's a really great -- \r\n",

        "Myrtle: After he looks at my shoulder.  \r\n",
        "Susan: Right.  Well, you'd better wait in your room for him.  \r\n",
        "Myrtle: You're right.  These halls are full of germs.  Take me back to my \r\nbed, honey.  \r\n",

        "Rick: No, nothing yet.  But I haven't finished looking.  \r\n",
        "Alison: Maybe you should talk to Myrtle -- Mrs. Scott, I mean.  She said that \r\nshe saw Mr. Goff leaving.  \r\n",

        "John: You don't want to tell me about these lowlifes you're involved with?  \r\nOkay, that's your business.  I can't make you.  But maybe I can make you stop \r\nfor a minute and think about all the people you're hurting.  \r\n",
        "Dusty: You don't think I think about that?  I think about it all the time.  I did \r\nwhat I had to do.  I'm having trouble sleeping.  \r\n",
        "John: Hmm.  \r\n",
        "Dusty: Especially now.  \r\n",
        "John: Especially now?  Why?  What are you talking about?  \r\n",

        "Chris: One of your patients, Jeffrey Goff -- he's unaccounted for.  \r\n",
        "John: The man's had huge doses of narcotics for his pain. He could wander \r\nout on the street and get himself killed. Come on! Don't just stand there. See \r\nif you can find Mr. Goff. Is anybody running this hospital?! I gotta call \r\nBarbara.\u00a0\r\n\r\n",
        "Dusty: No, no, wait a second.  \r\n",
        "John: Listen to me. You're not a kid anymore. You are a man. You start \r\nacting like a man, huh? You've always known the right thing, Dusty. So you \r\nremember that, and you do it.\r\n\r\n",

        "Rose: Yeah, right, to him.  You know, I don't if I'm really ready to talk about \r\nthis memorial service.  I'm gonna have my sister call you tomorrow.  Thank you \r\nfor your time.  I'm sorry.  We're closed.  \r\n",
        "Spangler: You sure you can't make an exception?  It's kind of an emergency.  \r\n",

        "Spangler: The thing is, my little girl is graduating high school tomorrow.  \r\nShe just told me that if I didn't get a trim, I'd embarrass the heck out of her.  \r\nShe says to me, \"Pop, you can't show up all shaggy-like, or else I'll just die.\" \r\n",

        "Rose: Yes.  It's my palace, and you are my first customer.  So, a little off the \r\ntop?  \r\n",
        "Spangler: Whatever you think.  \r\n",
        "Rose: Okay.  It looks -- it looks good to me.  But I'll try to make your \r\ndaughter proud.  You just stay there, and I'll do all the work.  \r\n",

        "Spangler: Really?  \r\n",
        "Rose: Yeah.  I thought I had the world by the tail.  A hotshot, vice president \r\njob.  I was dating this great guy.  I was supposed to have it all.  But it didn't \r\nwork out.  \r\n",
        "Spangler: Hey. Don't cry, pretty lady. I didn't mean to make you cry. \r\nJust tell me what's wrong. Maybe I can help.\r\n\r\n",

        "Craig: About what?  \r\n",
        "Jack: Rosanna said the last time she saw Carly was at the station.  I have an \r\neyewitness that will swear that Rosanna was outside Hal and Emily's watching \r\nCarly through a window after that.  \r\n",
        "Rosanna: Oh, yes.  And then what did I do?  Drag her into the bushes and \r\nbeat her with a stick?! \r\n",
        "Jack: That's what I'm trying to find out!  \r\n",
        "Craig: Jack, Carly has disappeared on more than a few occasions.  And \r\nusually it's because she has problems with you, nothing else.  \r\n",
        "Jack: If you're suggesting that Carly left of her own free will, timing's a little \r\noff, don't you think, Craig?  She's almost eight months pregnant.  She wouldn't \r\njeopardize her child like that.  \r\n",
        "Craig: Exactly, Jack.  She's a little stressed.  She had a particularly bad \r\nfashion show.  And you didn't exactly stand by her.  You assumed she had \r\nstolen her work from somebody else.  \r\n",
        "Jack: When, in fact, the only person who was stealing anything was you.  \r\nWhy don't you call that team of lawyers you keep on contingency and tell them \r\nto be ready?  \r\n",
        "Rosanna: Why don't you go to hell?  \r\n",
        "Jack: 'Cause if Carly doesn't show up soon, you'll be answering more \r\nquestions, Rosanna.  And it won't be in the comfort of Emma's Kitchen!  \r\n",

        "Rosanna: My God, I sell my multimillion-dollar company for $1 to get all of \r\nyour collective butts out of jail.  And then what happens?  You all just worry \r\nabout Carly.  Aw.  \r\n",
        "Craig: No, I'm not worried.  So she decides to lay low for a little awhile.  \r\n",
        "Rosanna: She didn't exactly make that decision on her own. I -- I kind of \r\nencouraged her to get out of town. And for once, I think my stupid sister took \r\nmy advice.",
